METHOD FOR PROCESSING CONTROL INFORMATION IN A<br>
WIRELESS MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to wireless (radio) mobile communication systems,<br>
and in particular, relates to a method for processing control information allows the<br>
operations of a mobile terminal to be simplified and permits efficient use of resources<br>
for the mobile terminal.<br>
Background Art<br>
To support broadband wireless (e.g., WiMAX) access, there are different types of<br>
broadband wireless air interfaces, such as cellular 3G technologies (e.g., UMTS,<br>
WCDMA, etc.), and multi-carrier based multiple access techniques (e.g., OFDMA,<br>
OFDM-TDMA, OFDM-CDMA, etc.). Frequency division multiplexing involves sub-<br>
channelization, of which at least four types (OFDM, Flash OFDM, sOFDMA and<br>
OFDMA) exist.<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) involves the splitting of a<br>
radio signal into multiple smaller sub-signals that are then transmitted simultaneously<br>
at different frequencies to a receiver. OFDM refers to a form of multi-carrier<br>
transmission where all the sub-carriers are orthogonal to each other. Certain TREE<br>
standards and 3GPP standards are related to various aspects of OFDM.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show a typical frame that is used in OFDM. One frame has a time<br>
duration of 10 ms (milliseconds) and consists of 20 sub-frames, each having a time<br>
duration of 0.5 ms. Each sub-frame may consist of a resource block (RB) that contains<br>
data or information, and a cyclic prefix (CP) that is a guard interval needed for con-<br>
ventional OFDM modulation (but not needed for OFDM with pulse shaping, i.e.,<br>
OFDM/OQAM). The sub-frame duration corresponds to the minimum downlink TTI<br>
(Transmission Time Interval).<br>
Figure 3 shows a basic downlink reference-signal structure consisting of known<br>
reference symbols. Namely, a mapping of physical channel symbols in frequency<br>
domain is shown. In other words, channel-coded, interleaved, and data-modulated in-<br>
formation (i.e., Layer 3 information) is mapped onto OFDM time/frequency symbols.<br>
The OFDM symbols can be organized into a number (M) of consecutive sub-carriers<br>
for a number (N) of consecutive OFDM symbols.<br>
Here, it is assumed that 7 OFDM symbols exist per sub-frame (when the CP length<br>
is short). In case of a long CP or a different frame structure, this basic downlink<br>
reference-signal structure would be slightly different.<br>
Reference symbols (i.e., first reference symbols) are located in the first OFDM<br>
symbol of every sub-frame assigned for downlink transmission. This is valid for both<br>
FDD and TDD, as well as for both long and short CP. Additional reference symbols<br>
(i.e., second reference symbols) are located in the third last OFDM symbol of every<br>
sub-frame assigned for downlink transmission. This is the baseline for both FDD and<br>
TDD, as well as for both long and short CP. However, for FDD, an evaluation of<br>
whether the second reference symbols are need should be made.<br>
Figure 4 shows an exemplary structure of an Evolved Universal Mobile Telecom-<br>
munications System (E-UMTS). The E-UMTS system is a system that has evolved<br>
from the UMTS system, and its standardization work is currently being performed by<br>
the 3GPP standards organization.<br>
The E-UMTS network generally comprises at least one mobile terminal (i.e., user<br>
equipment: UE), base stations (i.e., Node Bs), a control plane server (CPS) that<br>
performs radio (wireless) control functions, a radio resource management (RRM)<br>
entity that performs radio resource management functions, a mobility management<br>
entity (MME) that performs mobility management functions for a mobile terminal, and<br>
an access gateway (AG) that is located at an end of the E-UMTS network and connects<br>
with one or more external networks. Here, it can be understood that the particular<br>
names of the various network entities are not limited to those mentioned above.<br>
The various layers of the radio interface protocol between the mobile terminal and<br>
the network may be divided into L1 (Layer 1), L2 (Layer 2), and L3 (Layer 3) based<br>
upon the lower three layers of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) standard model<br>
that is known the field of communication systems. Among these layers, a physical<br>
layer that is part of Layer 1 provides an information transfer service using a physical<br>
channel, while a Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer located in Layer 3 performs the<br>
function of controlling radio resources between the mobile terminal and the network.<br>
To do so, the RRC layer exchanges RRC messages between the mobile terminal and<br>
the network. The functions of the RRC layer may be distributed among and performed<br>
within the Node B, the CPS/RRM and/or the MME.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show an exemplary architecture of the radio interface protocol<br>
between the mobile terminal and the UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access<br>
Network). The radio interface protocol of Figures 5 and 6 is horizontally comprised of<br>
a physical layer, a data link layer, and a network layer, and vertically comprised of a<br>
user plane for transmitting user data and a control plane for transferring control<br>
signaling. The radio interface protocol layer of Figures 5 and 6 may be divided into L1<br>
(Layer 1), L2 (Layer 2), and L3 (Layer 3) based upon the lower three layers of the<br>
Open System Interconnection (OSI) standards model that is known the field of com-<br>
munication systems.<br>
Particular layers of the radio protocol control plane of Figure 5 and of the radio<br>
protocol user plane of Figure 6 will be described below. The physical layer (i.e., Layer<br>
1) uses a physical channel to provide an informatioa transfer service to a higher layer.<br>
The physical layer is connected with a medium access control (MAC) layer located<br>
thereabove via a transport channel, and data is transferred between the physical layer<br>
and the MAC layer via the transport channel. Also, between respectively different<br>
physical layers, namely, between the respective physical layers of the transmitting side<br>
(transmitter) and the receiving side (receiver), data is transferred via a physical<br>
channel.<br>
The MAC layer of Layer 2 provides services to a radio link control (RLC) layer<br>
(which is a higher layer) via a logical channel. The RLC layer of Layer 2 supports the<br>
transmission of data with reliability. It should be noted that the RLC layer in Figures 5<br>
and 6 is depicted in dotted lines, because if the RLC functions are implemented in and<br>
performed by the MAC layer, the RLC layer itself may not need to exist. The PDCP<br>
layer of Layer 2 performs a header compression function that reduces unnecessary<br>
control information such that data being transmitted by employing Internet protocol<br>
(IP) packets, such as IPv4 or IPv6, can be efficiently sent over a radio (wireless)<br>
interface that has a relatively small bandwidth.<br>
The radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowermost portion of Layer 3<br>
is only defined in the control plane, and handles the control of logical channels,<br>
transport channels, and physical channels with respect to the configuration, re-<br>
configuration and release of radio bearers (RB). Here, the RB refers to a service that is<br>
provided by Layer 2 for data transfer between the mobile terminal and the UTRAN.<br>
As for channels used in downlink transmission for transmitting data from the<br>
network to the mobile terminal, there is a broadcast channel (BCH) used for<br>
transmitting system information, and a shared channel (SCH) used for transmitting<br>
user traffic or control messages. As for channels used in uplink transmission for<br>
transmitting data from the mobile terminal to the network, there is a random access<br>
channel (RACH) used for transmitting an initial control message, and a shared channel<br>
(SCH) used for transmitting user traffic or control messages.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
Before sending data to a particular mobile terminal, an indicator (which informs in<br>
advance that a notification message for a multicast and broadcast service will be<br>
transmitted) is transmitted through a separate (distinct) channel. In addition to this<br>
channel, the mobile terminal must also receive other channels, such as a broadcast<br>
channel used to periodically transmit system information. As there are a large total<br>
number of channels that a mobile terminal should receive due to transmissions through<br>
separate (distinct) channels according to each type of purpose, problems related to<br>
more complicated mobile terminal operations and a waste of mobile terminal resources<br>
occur.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
The present invention has been developed in order to solve the above described<br>
problems of the related art. As a result, the present invention provides a method for<br>
processing control information such that the operations of a mobile terminal can be<br>
simplified and permits efficient use of resources for the mobile terminal.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
One aspect of the present invention is the recognition by the present inventors<br>
regarding the problems and drawbacks of the related art described above and explained<br>
in more detail hereafter. Based upon such recognition, the features of the present<br>
invention have been developed.<br>
In the related art, it can be said that the system information is always fixed or non-<br>
flexible. Such fixed format allows a mobile terminal to easily detect and properly read<br>
the system information transmitted from the network.<br>
In contrast, the features of the present invention allow at least some portions of the<br>
system information to be dynamically (or flexibly) changed. Appropriate indicators are<br>
included such that a mobile terminal can properly detect and read the dynamic<br>
(flexible) system information. As a result, additional system information may be added<br>
as desired in order to support technical evolution and advancements, which thus allows<br>
for future enhancements or continued expansion of currently used system information.<br>
It should be noted that the features of the present invention are related to issues<br>
regarding the long-term evolution (LTE) of the 3GPP standard. As such, the 3GPP TS<br>
25.813 (LTE TR) and its related sections or portions thereof, as well as various<br>
developing enhancements thereof pertain to the present invention. Such enhancements<br>
and evolution have resulted in the use of a particular prefix (the letter E) when labeling<br>
various network entities (e.g., eNode B), protocol layers, channels, and the like.<br>
However, it can be clearly understood that such labeling and other terminology are<br>
merely exemplary and thus may be altered (or later clarified) as a result of ongoing or<br>
future discussions.<br>
Figure 7 is a diagram to explain the features of the present invention by showing<br>
where the control information and resource blocks may be located within each sub-<br>
frame with respect to frequency and time.<br>
The structure (format) of a sub-frame in relation to the frequency domain and the<br>
time domain can be understood from Figure 7. Namely, a single sub-frame has a time<br>
duration of 0.5 ms with 7 OFDM symbols (portions) therein.<br>
In the first portion of the sub-frame, control information (i.e., L1/L2 control in-<br>
formation, FCCH, SCCH, etc.) is included, while resource blocks (RBs) that may be in<br>
the form of one or more chunks may be located in the remaining portion of the sub-<br>
frame. Here, a resource block may occupy the entire time duration of the sub-frame<br>
(excluding the time duration for the control information) or some partial time duration<br>
thereof. Also, each resource block (RB) may use a particular frequency range (i.e., a<br>
particular number of sub-carriers).<br>
The frequency axis can be referred to as a scalable cell bandwidth, which typically<br>
has a frequency range of 1.25 ~ 20 MHz. A plurality of sub-carriers exists in the<br>
scalable cell bandwidth. Of this frequency range, a so-called center frequency (of ap-<br>
proximately 10 MHz) is mainly used in transmitting system information.<br>
In the related art, such system information is considered to be fixed. Although this<br>
allows the terminal to easily read the system information, addition of new system in-<br>
formation is not possible. In contrast, the present invention allows for at least part of<br>
the system information to be flexible (or dynamic).<br>
To do so, the present invention divides (or separates or distinguishes) the system in-<br>
formation into primary system information (e.g., Master Information Block: MIB) and<br>
non-primary (or secondary) system information (e.g., System Information Block: SIB).<br>
The MIB is transmitted in a static manner (e.g., via a BCH for fixed manner<br>
transmission), while the SIB is transmitted in a dynamic manner (e.g., via a downlink<br>
SCH for dynamic manner transmission). Here, transmission in a dynamic manner<br>
means that different frequency ranges and time durations can be used.<br>
For each frame, the MIB contains information about where each SIB is located.<br>
Namely, the particular frequency range (i.e., sub-carriers) and particular time duration<br>
(i.e., symbols) for each SIB is specified to allow the terminal (UE) to properly read the<br>
appropriate SIBs. For example, the MIB may indicate that a particular UE (e.g., UE<br>
#11) should read a particular resource block (e.g., RB #3). Here, the RB #3 can also be<br>
expressed as the information located at certain sub-carriers and certain symbols (e.g.,<br>
at sub-carriers #13~60 and symbols #3~5).<br>
In a similar manner, for each sub-frame within one frame, the control information<br>
(located in the first portion) contains information about where each resource block<br>
(RB) is located. Namely, the frequency range and particular time duration for each RB<br>
is specified to allow the terminal (UE) to properly read the appropriate RBs.<br>
The above concepts generally depicted in Figure 7 will be explained in more detail<br>
in the following description with reference to Figures 8 through 11.<br>
Figure 8 is a diagram used to explain a control information transmission and<br>
reception method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
network transmits a frame control channel (FCCH) at every particular period (i.e., a<br>
first period). Hereafter, the particular period is referred to as a frame.<br>
It should be noted that the FCCH may also be described in different terms. Namely,<br>
the control information transmitted by the network may be called L1/L2 control in-<br>
formation, FCCH, SCCH, or the like. Hereafter, such control information will mostly<br>
be referred to as FCCH, merely for the sake of explanation (although control in-<br>
formation and SCCH are also described).<br>
As shown in Figure 8, a MIB (Master Information Block) is repetitively transmitted<br>
at every second period, which is different that the above-mentioned first period. The<br>
MIB includes scheduling information for a SIB (System Information Block) that<br>
transmits system information and other resource blocks (RBs) for each type of control<br>
information. Namely, the MIB provides scheduling information related to which<br>
frequency and what time is used to transmit each type of control information, such as<br>
multiple SIBs, and the like. The second period may set to be greater than the first<br>
period. The MIB may be transmitted in the first frame of the period in which the MIB<br>
is to be transmitted.<br>
Here, the FCCH that is transmitted in each frame can inform about whether the data<br>
transmitted in the corresponding time duration (frame) is a common control message, a<br>
control message dedicated for a particular mobile terminal, common data, or data<br>
dedicated for a particular mobile terminal. Also, the FCCH informs about which<br>
frequency and what time within the frame that a control message or data of the control<br>
information is transmitted.<br>
The mobile terminal periodically receives the FCCH at every first period. If the<br>
FCCH of a particular frame indicates the transmission of a MIB, the mobile terminal<br>
receives the MIB at the corresponding frequency and time in accordance with the<br>
scheduling information included in the indicator information transmitted through the<br>
FCCH. By referring to the MIB, the mobile terminal can obtain scheduling information<br>
for particular messages, particular indicator messages, and the like. Through such<br>
scheduling information, the mobile terminal can determine which frequency and what<br>
time was used to transmit a particular SIB or the like. According to such scheduling in-<br>
formation, the mobile terminal can receive a message with respect to the SIB, and the<br>
subscribed service that is should receive.<br>
The MIB may include either a mobile terminal identifier or a service identifier, or<br>
may include an indicator that indicates such an identifier.<br>
Figure 9 is a diagram used to explain a control information transmission and<br>
reception method according to another exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention. A cell that supports broadband frequencies with a bandwidth of 10 or 20<br>
MHz, can provide a system bandwidth of narrowband frequencies for a mobile<br>
terminal operating in narrowband frequencies such as 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, or the like.<br>
In this case, as shown in Figure 9, a central bandwidth of the broadband frequencies is<br>
typically used for the system bandwidth. Here, the MIB, the SIBs, and the like should<br>
all be transmitted in the system bandwidth. However, SIBs that transmit particular<br>
system information may be transmitted outside of the system bandwidth.<br>
The FCCH (or other type of system information like L1/L2 control information,<br>
SCCH, etc.) transmitted in each frame indicates whether the data transmitted in the<br>
corresponding time duration (frame) is a MIB, an SIB, or the like. Also, the FCCH<br>
informs about which frequency and what time within the frame that each message or<br>
data is transmitted. The FCCH may be transmitted upon being diyided into an FCCH<br>
for system bandwidth and an FCCH for non-system bandwidth. Accordingly, a mobile<br>
terminal that only receives the system bandwidth may receive the FCCH for system<br>
bandwidth to obtain information of each data or message that is transmitted via the<br>
system bandwidth. Also, a mobile terminal that receives the non-system bandwidth<br>
may receive the FCCH for non-system bandwidth to obtain information of each data or<br>
message that is transmitted via the non-system bandwidth.<br>
In other words, the concepts shown in Figure 9 are for handling the situation for<br>
mobile terminals in idle mode.<br>
The network (system) supports the cell bandwidth of 20 MHz, while a mobile<br>
terminal typically can only support a 10 MHz bandwidth range. Thus, the L1/L2<br>
control information needs to be transmitted in certain units (a frequency range) such as,<br>
a range of 10 MHz, 5 MHz, or the like. As a result, there may be three scenarios for the<br>
frequency ranges used by the mobile terminal for reading data. Namely, of the 20 MHz<br>
scalable cell bandwidth, the mobile terminal may read one of three frequency ranges,<br>
i.e., the lower 10 MHz, the upper 10 MHz, or a middle (intermediate) 10 MHz thereof.<br>
For mobile terminals in RRC connected mode, because the particular cell in which<br>
the connected mode mobile terminal is located is known, any one of the three 10 MHz<br>
ranges and appropriate switching among these three 10 MHz ranges is possible.<br>
However, for a mobile terminal in idle mode, because the particular cell in which the<br>
terminal is located cannot be known, only one of these three 10 MHz ranges can be<br>
used (typically, the intermediate 10 MHz range is used). Meanwhile, the bandwidth<br>
outside the intermediate 10 MHz range can be used for transmitting and receiving<br>
resource blocks for mobile terminals in connected mode.<br>
Here, although the above exemplary embodiment with reference to Figure 9 is<br>
described for 10 MHz ranges, it is contemplated that the 20MHz scalable cell<br>
bandwidth could also be divided up into 5 MHz units.<br>
Figure 10 is a diagram used to explain constituting information of control in-<br>
formation (i.e., an FCCH) according to an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The FCCH provides to the mobile terminal, various types of control in-<br>
formation related to data and control messages transmitted during the corresponding<br>
period (i.e., during the corresponding frame). Here, the FCCH is shown to be<br>
comprised of five different FCCH portions. However, this is merely exemplary, and<br>
the number of FCCH portions may vary accordingly.<br>
Referring to Figure 10, the first FCCH portion is a FCCH MAP that informs about<br>
the frequency and time of the FCCH transmission, a length of the FCCH information,<br>
radio resource parameters needed for receiving the FCCH information, and the like.<br>
Such FCCH MAP may be always included in each frame. In the present invention,<br>
each frame may include all types of FCCHs or may include only portions thereof. The<br>
FCCH MAP may inform about whether or not the remaining four types of FCCH<br>
portions (excluding the FCCH MAP) are transmitted in the corresponding frame.<br>
The second FCCH portion is a FCCH Idle Mode (DL) that includes control in-<br>
formation needed on order to receive downlink control information when the mobile<br>
terminal is in idle mode. This second FCCH portion may be included in a cor-<br>
responding frame when control information to be transmitted on the downlink exists in<br>
the frame. The control information related to common control messages such as the<br>
MIB, SIB, etc. may be included in this second FCCH portion. Also, the MIB, SIB, etc.<br>
may be included in this second FCCH portion.<br>
The third FCCH portion is a FCCH Idle Mode (UL) that includes control in-<br>
formation needed in order to transmit uplink control information when the mobile<br>
terminal is in idle mode. This third FCCH portion may include information that is<br>
needed for uplink random access transmissions. When the mobile terminal transmits a<br>
random access message, the network may transmit a response to the ransom access<br>
message via this third FCCH portion. Also, the third FCCH portion can be used to<br>
inform that a response to the random access message is being transmitted in the frame<br>
that is used to transmit the third FCCH portion, and to do so, the third FCCH portion<br>
includes control information related to such response to the random access message.<br>
The fourth FCCH portion includes control information needed in order to receive<br>
downlink control information when the mobile terminal is in active mode. This fourth<br>
FCCH portion may include control information of an downlink shared channel (SCH)<br>
that is transmitted in a corresponding frame.<br>
The fifth FCCH portion includes control information needed in order to transmit<br>
uplink control information when the mobile terminal is in active mode. This fifth<br>
FCCH portion may include control information of an uplink shared channel (SCH) that<br>
is transmitted in a corresponding frame.<br>
The mobile terminal periodically receives the FCCH MAP and may check to see<br>
whether the corresponding frame contains any data or information that is wishes to<br>
receive. After receiving the FCCH MAP, when the mobile terminal is in idle mode,<br>
only the second and third FCCH portions are received. When the mobile terminal is in<br>
active mode, only the fourth and fifth FCCH portions are received.<br>
In order to inform about the control information that is needed for multicast and<br>
broadcast transmissions, the network may add and transmit other FCCH portions as<br>
needed.<br>
Figure 11 shows a data reception method for a mobile terminal according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Figure 11, the SCCH<br>
channel (i.e., control information) is transmitted using a respectively different<br>
frequency and time from those of the SCH, and is transmitted once per each sub-frame.<br>
One sub-frame is 0.5 ms in duration and the SCCH channel is transmitted by using one<br>
or two symbols that constitute the corresponding sub-frame. A single sub-frame<br>
consists of 6 or 7 symbols, and respectively different symbols constitute respectively<br>
different time periods (durations).<br>
In Figure 11, the SCCH channel that is transmitted in a single sub-frame, transmits<br>
control information related to a SCH channel of the corresponding sub-frame. The<br>
control information transmitted through the SCCH channel may comprise a mobile<br>
terminal identifier (identity), a multicast service identifier (identity), and a logical<br>
channel identifier (identity). The logical channel identifier may inform whether the<br>
data transmitted in a sub-frame of the corresponding SCH channel is data for a mobile<br>
terminal dedicated channel (e.g., DCCH or DTCH) or data for a common channel. In<br>
particular, if the data is for a common channel, the logical channel identifier informs<br>
about the type of common channel (i.e., BCCH, PCCH, MCCH, MTCH, or CCCH).<br>
The mobile terminal may receive the SCCH channel in a periodic manner or at<br>
every sub-frame. To do so, the base station (eNode B) transmits period information to<br>
the mobile terminal. Then, the mobile terminal may receive the sub-frames of the<br>
SCCH channel in a periodic manner according to the period information provided from<br>
the base station.<br>
The mobile terminal obtains the logical channel identifier through the received<br>
SCCH channel, and by means of the obtained logical channel identifier, the mobile<br>
terminal can determine whether the data transmitted via the SCH channel is data for a<br>
dedicated channel or data for one of a BCCH, PCCH, MCCH, MTCH or CCCH (i.e., a<br>
common channel).<br>
If the logical channel identifier indicates a common channel, the mobile terminal<br>
receives the sub-frame of the corresponding SCH channel to thus receive the data of<br>
the common channel.<br>
It should be noted that Figures 1 through 11 show exemplary embodiments for a 10<br>
ms frame having twenty 0.5 ms sub-frames. However, the features of the present<br>
invention are clearly applicable to other techniques that employ other frame sizes. For<br>
example, a frame size of 5 ms may be used, and to support LTE (Long Term<br>
Evolution) techniques, a frame size of 0.5 ms may be used.<br>
Regarding the effects of the present invention, the wireless network can, in advance,<br>
inform (through a single indicator channel) about the transmission of common control<br>
information (such as particular messages, system information, or the like). A radio<br>
mobile terminal can periodically receive the single indicator channel to thus receive the<br>
common control information by using the control information of the indicator channel.<br>
By using such procedures, the operations of the mobile terminal may be simplified and<br>
mobile terminal resources can be used more efficiently.<br>
Additionally, as the present invention provides information about where each<br>
resource block (RB) is located with respect to the frequency and time domains, system<br>
information, control information, and the like can be processed in a dynamic and<br>
flexible manner, to thus support various enhanced capabilities. Also, when frequency<br>
selective scheduling is performed, improved adaptation to channel changes can be<br>
achieved.<br>
