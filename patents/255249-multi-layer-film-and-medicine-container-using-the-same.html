				<td>DESCRIPTION MULTI-LAYER   FILM  AND  MEDICINE   CONTAINER  USING  THE   SAME<br>
TECHNICAL   FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a multi-layer film which suppresses adsorption of a medicine and a liquid medicine, and a  medicine  container  using  the  same.<br>
BACKGROUND  ART<br>
For  use  in  continuous   infusion,   some  medicines  are administered in the state of beingmixed with an infusion solution. For use  in continuous  infusion,  it has been studied to previously form  a  medicine   for  injection  into  an  aqueous   dilute  solution (namely,   pre-mixing).<br>
Bottles and ampuls made of chemically stable glass have hitherto been used as a medicine container which accommodates an infusion solution. Recently, for the purpose of weight reduction of the medicine container and improvement in handling property, infusion bags and infusion bottles made of a pharmaceutically acceptable plastic have widely been used. Among various known pharmaceutically acceptable plastics, polyethylene is remarkably superior in handling property because of its high safety and flexibility in the form of a film, and is also,easily disposable because no toxic gas is evolved during incineration. Therefore, polyethylene is widely used as a material of the medicine container .<br>
However, since a certain medicine such as nitroglycerin is easily adsorbed into polyethylene, a problems such as decrease in content of the medicine arises in case of administration of mixed  injection,   which  interferes  with  pre-mixing.<br>
Japanese  Published  Unexamined  Patent  Application   (Kokai Tokkyo Koho Hei)  No.  5-293159 proposes a medicine container which uses   a  cyclic  olefin  polymer   for  the  purpose  of  suppressing adsorption  of  a  medicine.<br>
However, the cyclic olefin polymer has characteristics such as less adsorption of nitroglycerin but has drawbacks such as hardness andbrittleness, thereby causing a problem thatproperties such as strength and flexibility of the medicine container are deteriorated.<br>
Furthermore, since the cyclic olefin polymer is inferior in miscibility and adhesion with the other resin, the medicine container is likely to be delaminated and lowered in strength. In case the cyclic olefin polymer and the other resin are bonded using an adhesive resin, a problem such as dissolution into a medicine  arises.    Therefore,   the  safety  is  not   secured.<br>
Therefore,  an object of the present invention is to provide a  multi-layer  film which  is  superior  in  strength,   flexibility, heat  resistance,  and safety suited for use  as a medical material, and also suppresses adsorption of a medicine and a liquid medicine, and  a  medicine  container  using  the  same.<br><br>
DISCLOSURE   OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
To achieve the object described above, the multi-layer film of   the  present   invention  comprises:<br>
a surface layer having a thickness of 10 to 50 µm made of an ethylene- aαolefin copolymer having a density of 0.935 to 0.950 g/cm3,<br>
a flexible layer having a thickness of 100 to 200 µm made of an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.860 to 0.930   g/cm3,<br>
a barrier layer having a thickness of 10 to 80 µm made of a mixed resin containing 60 to 95% by weight of a cyclic olefin polymer and 5 to 40% by weight of an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer having  a  density  of  0.900   to  0.965  g/cm3,   and<br>
a seal layer having a thickness of 5 to 80 µm made of an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.910 to 0.950 g/cm3.<br>
o<br>
To achieve the object described above, themedicine container f the present invention is characterized in that the multi-layer film of the present invention is used so that the surface layer constitutes   the  outer  surface  of  the  medicine  container.<br>
In  the multi-layer  film of  the present  invention,  as  shown in.  the  medicine  container  comprising  the   film  of   the  present invention,  the surface layer is used so as to constitute the outer surface.     That  is,   the  seal   layer  of  the  multi-layer   film constitutes  an  innermost  layer  of  the medicine  container  and  is<br>
directly contacted with a medicine accommodated in the container. As the material of the seal layer, an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer, which is often used in a conventional medical container and exhibits an adsorption ability to nitroglycerin, is used. However, the thickness is set to a small value ranging from 5 to 80 µm and, moreover, the barrier layer containing a predetermined proportion of the cyclic olefin polymer is provided on the outer surface  of  the  seal  layer.     On  the  outer  surface  of  the  barrier<br>
layer,   the   flexible   layer  made  of   the  low-density  ethylene-α-olefin copolymer and the  surface  layer made  of  the high-density<br>
ethylene-α-olefin  copolymer  are  provided  in  this   order.<br>
According to the multi-layer film with such a layer configuration and the medicine container using the same of the present invention, it is made possible to suppress adsorption of the medicine by the barrier layer and to impart excellent strength and excellent flexibility by the seal layer covering the barrier layer, the flexible layer and the surface layer while maintaining the  miscibility  with  the  barrier  layer.<br>
In the multi-layer film of the present invention and the multi-layer film used in the medicine container of the present invention, the flexible layer preferably comprises: (a) a material obtained by mixing an ethylene- a-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.860 to 0.930-g/cm3 with 20%: by weight or. less of a high-density polyethylene having a density of 0.940 to 0,970  g/cm3,   or<br>
(b) a laminate of a layer made of an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.860 to 0.930 g/cm3 and a layer made of a material obtainedbymixing an ethylene- α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.860 to 0.930 g/cm3 with 20% by weight or less of a high-density polyethylene having a density of 0.940 to 0.970 g/cm3.<br>
By  using  the  material   obtained  by  mixing  the  ethylene-α -olefin  copolymer  having  a  predetermined  density  with   the high-density polyethylene,   as  shown  in  (a) ,   and  the  laminate  of the  layer  of  the  ethylene-α-olefin  copolymer  having   a predetermined  density  and  the  layer  of  the  high-density polyethylene,  as shown in  (b) ,  the heat resistance can be improved without  impairing  the  flexibility  of  the  multi-layer  film   (and the  medicine  container  using  the  same).<br>
In the multi-layer film shown in (a) , the ethylene- α -olefin copolymer having a density of 0.860 to 0.930 g/cm3 used in the flexible layer may be a mixture of an ethylene- α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0 . 860 to 0. 910 g/cm3 and an ethylene- α -olefin copolymer having a density of 0.910 to 0.940 g/cm3. By using the above mixture as the material of the flexible layer, the flexibility of  the  multi-layer  film  can  be   further  improved.<br>
In the multi-layer film of the present invention and the multi-layer film used in the medicine container of .the present invention, the ethylene-α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.860  to   0.930  g/cm3  used  in  the   flexible  layer   is  preferably<br>
obtained by polymerizing using a metallocene catalyst.    Similarly, the ethylene- α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.900 to 0.965 g/cm3  used  in  the  barrier   layer  is  preferably  obtained  by polymerizing  using  a  metallocene  catalyst.<br>
As described above,  by using those obtained by polymerizing<br>
using the metallocene catalyst as the ethylene- a-olefin copolyirier used in the flexible layer and the barrier layer, the gas barrier properties and moisture barrier properties can be improved while satisfactorily maintaining the flexibility and impact resistance of  the  multi-layer   film   (medicine  container  using  the  same).<br>
Since the multi-layer film of the present invention is used in a medical pliable plastic container such as medicine container, it  preferably  has  a  total   thickness  of   130  to  300   µm.<br>
Since the multi-layer film of the present invention is used in a medical pliable plastic container such as medicine container, the thickness of the seal layer is preferably set in order to lower the adsorption ability of the medicine accommodated in the container and to improve various characteristics (for example, durability) of the container. Specifically, the thickness of the seal layer is preferably set within a range from 5 to 40 µm in case of attaching great importance to the effect of preventing adsorption of the medicine, while the thickness of the seal layer is prefer ably set within a range from 4 0 to 80 µmincaseof attaching more   great  importance  to   the  durability  of  the  container.<br>
BRIEF  DESCRIPTION  OF  THE   DRWAINGS<br>
Fig.  1  is  a  front  view showing an  embodiment  of  a medicine container  10  according  to  the  present  invention.<br>
BEST  MODE   FOR  CARRYING   OUT   THE   INVENTION [Multi-layer  film]<br>
The  multi-layer   film  of   the  present  invention  will  be described  in  detail  below. (Barrier   layer)<br>
As described above, the barrier layer in the multi-layer film of the present invention is made of a mixed resin containing 60  to  95%  by  weight  of  a  cyclic  olefin  polymer  and  5  to  40%  by<br>
weight of an ethylene- a-olefin copolymer having a density of 0. 900 to 0.965 g/cm3, and the barrier layer has a thickness of 10 to 80   µm.<br>
Examples  of  the  cyclic  olefin polymer  used  in  the  barrier layer  include  copolymer  of  ethylene  and  dicyclopentadines, copolymer  of  ethylene  and  a  norbornene  compound,   ring-opening polymer of cyclopentadiene derivative,  ring-opening copolymer of various  cyclopentadiene  derivatives,  and hydrogenated polymers or  copolymers   thereof.    Among  these  polymers,   a  hydrogenated copolymer of ethylene and a norbornene compound or a hydrogenated ring-opening   (co)polymer  of  one  or  more  cyclopentadiene derivatives  is  preferably  used to  impart  high  strength  and  good gas   and  moisture  barrier  properties  to  the  multi-layer   film.<br>
Examples  of  the  resin  include  polymer  having  a  repeating unit   represented  by  the  following  general   formula   (1)   and  a repeating unit represented by the  following general  formula  (1' ) and a polymer having a repeating unit represented by the following general   formula   (2).<br><br>
(Formula removed) <br><br>
In the formulas (1) and (1' ) , Rl, R1', R2 and R2' are the same or different and represent hydrogen, a hydrocarbon group, or a polar group such as halogen, ester, nitrile or pyridyl, and R1, R1', R2 and R2' may be combined with each other to form a ring; m and m' represent an integer of 1 or more; and n and n' represent 0  or   an  integer  of  1  or  more.<br><br>
(Formula removed)<br><br><br><br>
In the formulas (2), R3 and R4 are the same or different and represent hydrogen, a hydrocarbon group, or a polar group such as halogen, ester, nitrile or pyridyl, and R3 and R4 maybe combined<br>
with  each  other  to  form  a  ring;  x  and  z  represent  an  integer  of 1  or  more;   and  y  represents   0  or  an  integer  of  1  or  more.<br>
The polymer having repeating units representedby the general formulas  (1)  and  (1')  is obtained by polymerizing one or more kinds of monomers using  a  known polymerization method or hydrogenating the ring-opening polymer thus obtained using a conventional method. Specific  examples  of  the  polymer  include  hydrogenated  polymer manufactured by ZEON CORPORATION  [tradename:  "ZEONOR®",  specific gravity:  1.01,  melt  flow  rate   (MFR)  :  70  g/lOmin.   (190°C),   glass transition-temperature   (Tg) :   100°C]   and polymer manufactured  by Japan Synthetic Rubber Co.,  Ltd.  under  the trade name of "ART ON®" . The  polymer  having  a  structural  unit  represented  by  the general  formula  (2)  is  obtained by the  addition copolymerization of one,  two or more kinds of norbornene monomers and ethylene using a  known method,  or  hydrogenating the  resulting polymer  according to a conventional method.    Specific examples of the polymer include polymer manufactured by Mitsui Chemical Co.,  Ltd.  under the trade name  of  "APEL®  6509"   [specific  gravity:   1.02,  MFR:   40  g/10  min. (190°C),   glass  transition  temperature   (Tg):   80°C]   and  polymer manufactured  by  Ticona  GmbH  under  the  trade  name  of  "Topas®". Among  the  resins  including  the  polymer  having  structural units  represented  by  the  general   formulas   (1),    (,1')   and   (2), hydrogenated resins are superior in heat resistance,  transparency and stability,  in addition to gas barrier properties  and moisture barrier  properties,   because  they  are   saturated  polymers.<br><br>
The  cyclic  olefin  polymer  used  in  the  present  invention preferablyhas a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 70°Cor higher, and more preferably from 80 to  150°C.    Regarding the range  of  the molecular  weight,   the  number-average  molecular  weight  <mn>   as measured by gel permeation chromatography  (GPC)  using cyclohexane as  a  solvent  is preferably within a  range  from 10, 000  to  100, 000, and more preferably from 20, 000 to 500,000.     Incase an unsaturated bond  remained  in  a molecular  chain  of  the  cyclic  olefin polymer is   saturated  with  hydrogenation,   the  hydrogenation  ratio   is preferably  90%  or  more,   more  preferably  951  or  more,   and particularly  preferably  99%  or  more.<br>
In the barrier layer, when the proportion of the cyclic olefin polymer is less than 60% by weight, the effect of preventing adsorption of the medicine is lowered. On the other hand, when the proportion of the cyclic olefin polymer exceeds 95% by weight, the flexibility of the entire multi-layer film is deteriorated and also adhesion between the barrier layer and the other layer is  deteriorated.<br>
As described hereinafter,  all layers other than the barrier layer  in  the  multi-layer  film  of  the  present  invention  is  made of   an  ethylene-α-olefin  copolymer,   or  contains  the  ethylene-α-olefin  copolymer as  a'main  component.     Therefore,   the  entire remaining resin other than the cyclic olefin polymer  among resins<br>
constituting the barrier layer is preferably an ethylene- α-olefin copolymer.<br>
In the barrier  layer,  when the proportion of  the  ethylene-<br>
a-olefin copolymer is less than 5% by weight, adhesion between the  barrier  layer  and  the  other  layer  is  deteriorated..    On  the<br>
other hand, when the proportion of the ethylene- α-olefin copolymer exceeds 40% by weight, the effect of preventing adsorption of the medicine is lowered because the proportion of the cyclic olefin polymer  is  reduced.<br>
The ethylene-α-olefin copolymer used to form the barrier layer has a density within a range from 0.900 to 0.965 g/cm3. When the density of the ethylene-α-olefin copolymer used to form the barrier layer is less than 0.900 g/cm3; there arises a problem that the heat resistance of the multi-layer film is deteriorated. On the other hand, when the density exceeds 0.965 g/cm3, there arises a problem that the multi-layer film becomes hard and also transparency  is  deteriorated.<br>
The  ethylene-α-olefin  copolymer  used  to  form  the  barrier layer is not specifically limited as  far as it satisfies the above range of the density,  and conventionally  known various  ethylene-a-olefin  copolymers   can  be  used.    Specific  examples  thereof include  copolymers  with   a-olefin  having  3  to  12  carbon  atoms, such  as  propylene,   1-butene,   1-pentene,   1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene,   1-heptene,   1-octene,   1-nonene,.  1-decene, 1-undecene,   1-dodecene  or  the  like.    The  ethylene-α-olefin copolymer  is  more  preferably  linear  in  view  of  the  flexibility and  strength.<br>
The  ethylene-α-olefin  copolymer  used  to  form  the  barrier layer  is particularly preferably produced by using a metallocene<br>
catalyst. When using the ethylene-α-olefin copolymer produced by using the metallocene catalyst, as described above, gas barrier properties and moisture barrier properties can be improved while satisfactorily maintaining the flexibility and impact resistance of  the  multi-layer  film.<br>
The  thickness  of  the barrier  layer  is  set within  the  above range taking account of the balance between the effect of preventing adsorption  of  the  medicine  and  the   flexibility  of  the  entire multi-layer film.    When the thickness of the barrier layer is less than  10  µm,   the  effect  of preventing  adsorption of  the  medicine is  lowered.    On  the  other  hand,  when  the  thickness  exceeds  80   p. m,  the flexibility of the entire multi-layer film is deteriorated. The  thickness  of  the  barrier  layer  is  particularly  preferably within  a  range   from  10   to  50   µm. (Flexible   layer)<br>
As  described  above,  the  flexible  layer  in  the multi-layer<br>
film  of  the  present  invention  is  made  of  an  ethylene-α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.860 to 0.930 g/cm3,  and the flexible<br>
layer  has   a  thickness   of  100  to  200   µm.<br>
In the formation of the flexible layer, an ethylene- α-olefin copolymer having a density within the above range is used so as to impart high flexibility to the multi-layer film and the medicine container using  the  same.    The  ethylene-α-olefin copolymer used<br>
herein is the same as those described as for the ethylene- α-olefin copolymer used to form the barrier layer, except that it has a different  density.<br>
The density of the ethylene- α-olefin copolymer used to form the flexible layer is particularly preferably from 0. 8 90 to 0. 910 g/cm3 within the above range so as to further improve the flexibility of the multi-layer film. The copolymer preferably has MFR of 0. 5 to 4.0 g/10 min. (190°C) and also preferably has a melting point of   105   to   120°C.<br>
The ethylene-α-olefin copolymer used to form the flexible layer is particularly preferably produced by using a metallocene catalyst. When using the ethylene-α-olefin copolymer produced by using the metallocene catalyst, as described above, gas barrier properties and moisture barrier properties can be improved while satisfactorily maintaining the flexibility and impact resistance of  the  multi-layer  film.<br>
As the ethylene- α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.8 60 to  0.930  g/cm3  used  to  form  the  flexible  layer,   a  mixture  of  an<br>
ethylene-α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.860 to 0.910 g/cm3 and an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0. 910 to 0. 940 g/cm3 may be used. By using the mixture, the flexibility of  the  multi-layer  film  can  be  further  improved.<br>
The resin "used to form theflexible layer (and the flexible layer) may be an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.860 to 0.930 g/cm3 alone,  or a mixture of the above ethylene-<br>
a-olefin copolymer and 20% by weight or less of a high-density polyethylene having a density of 0.940 to 0.970 g/cm3 as shown in   (a)  .<br>
As shown in (b) , it also may be a laminate of a layer made of the above ethylene-α-olefin copolymer and a layer made of a material obtained by mixing an ethylene- a-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.860 to 0.930 g/cm3 with 20% by weight or less of a high-density polyethylene having a density of 0.940 to 0.970 g/cm3.<br>
Also in case of mixing with the high-density polyethylene or forming the laminate, the density of the entire flexible layer is set within a range from 0.860 to 0.930 g/cm3, similar to the case  of  using  the  ethylene-α-olefin  copolymer  alone.<br>
In case the mixed resin (a) or the laminate (b) is used as the resin used to form the flexible layer (and the flexible layer) , the heat resistance can be improved without deteriorating the flexibility  of   the  multi-layer  film.<br>
The high-density polyethylene, which is mixed with the above ethylene- α-olefin copolymer or laminated with the copolymer, may be  a  homopolymer  or  a  copolymer  with  a-olefin.<br>
The   ratio  of   the  thickness  of  the  respective  layers<br>
constituting  the  laminate   (b)   is  not  specifically  limited  and<br>
•arbitrary ra tip can be selected.    The conf igu.ration'of the laminate<br>
is not specif ically limitedbut includes,  for example,  three-layer<br>
structure  comprising  a  layer  made  of  a  mixture  of  an  ethylene-<br>
a-olefin  copolymer  and  a  high-density  polyethylene  as  an intermediate  layer,<br>
The thickness of the flexible layer is set within the above range so as to impart proper flexibility of the entire multi-layer film. When the thickness of the flexible layer is less than 100 µm, the flexibility of the entire flexible layer is deteriorated. On the other hand, when the thickness exceeds 200 (ii, the thickness of  the  entire  multi-layer   film  is  too  large.<br>
The thickness of the flexible layer is also set within the above range even if the flexible layer is made of the laminate. The thickness of the flexible layer is particularly preferably within  a  range  from  130  to  180  µm.<br>
(Seal   layer)<br>
As described above, the seal layer in the multi-layer film of the present invention is made of an ethylene- α-olefin copolymer having  a  density  of  0.910  to  0.950  g/cm3,   and  the  seal  layer  has<br>
a  thickness  of  5  to  80  µm.<br>
In the formation of the seal layer, an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer is used so that the resulting seal layer endures sterilization under high temperature conditions (with the blocking resistance) and is easily heat-sealed and is also pharmaceutically acceptable and does not contain a component which is dissolved when contacted with the medicine. The- ethylene-α-olefin copolymer  used  herein  is  the  same  as  those  described  as  for  the<br>
ethylene- α-olefin copolymer used to form the barrier layer,  except<br><br>
that  it  has  a  different  density.<br>
The density of the ethylene- α-olefin copolymer used to form the  seal   layer   is   set  within  the  above  range   in  view  of   the sealabilty.<br>
The thickness of the seal layer is set within the above range taking account of the balance between the sealability and the adsorption ability of the medicine. When the thickness of the seal layer is less than 5 µa, the sealability is deteriorated. On the other hand, when the thickness exceeds 80 urn, the medicine is likely to be adsorbed into the seal layer and, therefore, the effect of preventing adsorption of the medicine of the entire multi-layer   film  is   lowered.<br>
As  described  above,   when  using  the multi-layer  film  of  the<br>
present invention  in a medical pliable plastic  container  such  as<br>
medicine container,  the thickness of the seal layer is preferably<br>
set within a range from 5 to 40  µm in case of making a great account<br>
of a fact that adsorption ability of themedicine to be accommodated<br>
in the container is deteriorated,  while  the thickness of the seal<br>
layer  is  preferably  set  within  a  range  from  40  to  80  µm  in  case<br>
of making  a  great  account  of  a  fact  that  various  characteristics<br>
(for  example,   durability)   of  the  container  are  improved.<br>
(Surface   layer)<br>
As described above, the surface layer in the multi-layer film of the present invention is made of an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer having a density of 0.935 to 0.950 g/cm3,  and the surface<br>
layer  has  a  thickness  of  10  to  50  µm.<br>
It is required for the surface layer that it is a layer serving as an outer surface layer when a medicine container is formed of this multi-layer film and also has a high.mechanical strength (especially/ tensile strength) and excellent heat resistance, and therefore an ethylene- α-olefin copolymer having a density within the above range is used. The ethylene-α-olefin copolymer used herein is the same as those described as for the ethylene- α-olefin copolymer used to form the barrier layer, except that it has a different  density.<br>
The density of the ethylene- α-olefin copolymer used to form the surface layer is preferably from 0.935 to 0.945 g/cm3, and more preferably about 0.940 g/cm3, within the above range so as to further improve the mechanical strength (especially, tensile strength) and heat resistance of the surface layer. Furthermore, the copolymer preferably has MFR of 1.5 to 2.5 g/10 min. (190°C) and  also  preferably  has  a  melting  point  of  120  to  130°C.<br>
The thickness of the surface layer is set within the above range taking account of the balance between the mechanical strength (especially, tensile strength) , heat resistance and thickness of the  entire  multi-layer  film.<br>
(Method  of  producing  multi-layer-  film)<br>
The multi-layer film can b.e produced by using conventionally known various methods such as water-cooling coextrusion inflation method,   coextrusion  T-die  method  and  the  like.<br>
Since the multi-layer film of the present invention is used in a medical pliable plastic container such as medicine container, the  total  thickness  is  set  within  a  range  from  180  to  300  αm  in the production of the multi-layer film.    When the total thickness is  less  than  130   µm,   the  strength  of  the  medicine  container  is likely to be lowered.    On the other hand,  when the total thickness exceeds  300   µm,   the   flexibility  of  the  medicine  container   is deteriorated  and  the  handling  property   is   likely   to  be deteriorated.<br>
[Medicine  container]<br>
The medicine container of the present invention will be described below with reference to Fig. 1 showing an embodiment of  the  medicine  container.<br>
Fig. 1 is a front view showing an embodiment of a medicine container (liquid medicine bag) using the multi-layer film of the present  invention.<br>
Amedicine container 10 shown in Fig. 1 is producedby cutting two multi-layer films of the present invention using a conventional method, laying the respective multi-layer films so that each seal layer constitutes an inner layer, heat-sealing a peripheral portion 22 of the multi-layer film, and attaching a port member 20 to the peripheral  portion  22  using  a  means  such  as  heat   sealing.<br>
The method of producing the medicine container of the present invention is not limited to the above method and the medicine container may  also be  formed,   for  example,  by heat  sealing  after<br>
forming into a tube so that the seal  layer of  the multi-layer film faces  inside.<br>
As the conditions for heat sealing of the multi-layer film, the temperature within a range from 130 to 200°C can be employed. In the case of a film having a thickness of about 250 µa, sealing can be completed in a short time such as about 0.5 to 6 seconds at  a  temperature  within  the  above   range.<br>
It is preferred to use, as the port member 20, a resin having excellent fusibility with the seal layer in the multi-layer film, e.g. those made of polyethylene. In case of the port member 20 made of polyethylene having a melting point of about 120 to 130°c, heat sealing may be conducted by pre-heating the port member for several seconds and heating at about 140 to 170°C for about 0.5 to  5   seconds.<br>
Pref erredexamples of themedicine, whichcanbe accommodated in themedicine container, include isosorbide nitrate, nicardipine hydrochloride,   midazolam  and  edaravone,   in  addition  to  the above-mentioned nitroglycerin.    These medicines are liable  to be adsorbed  into  a  medicine  container  made  of  polyethylene   and adsorption  can  be  prevented  by  accommodating  in  the  medicine container  composed  of  the  multi-layer  film  of  the  present invention.<br>
The form of the medicine, which can be accommodated in the medicine container of the present invention includes, for example, powder,   in  addition  to  the  above-mentioned  aqueous  solution.<br>
In the form of the medicine container of the present invention, for example, two or more chamber partitioned with a communicatable partition wall is formed, in which one chamber can accommodate a powdered medicine, while the other chamber can accommodate a solution  of  the  powdered  medicine.<br>

[Evaluation  test] (Test  Example  1)<br>
Each medicine bag  (medicine container)  obtained in Examples 1  to  7  and  Comparative  Examples  1  to  2  was  filled  with  100  mL  of a 0.00 5% nitroglycerin solution,  subjected to steam, sterilization under  high  pressure  at  106°C  for  40  minutes,   and  then  stored  at 60°C for 2 weeks.    During the storage,  the containers were allowed to  stand in  the  state of being laid on the horizontal  surface  and the  contact  area  between  the  nitroglycerin  solution  and  the containers  was   controlled  to  about   160  cm2.     Then,   the concentration of nitroglycerin in the solution after  storage  for 2  weeks  was  measured by  high-performance  liquid  chromatography (HPLC)   and  a  ratio  of  the  resulting  concentration  to  an  iaitial concentration   (0.005%)   was  determined  and  taken  as  a  retention ratio   (%)  .<br>
As a control,  a glass ampul was filled with 100 mL of a 0 . 0.05% nitroglycerin  solution  and  a  retention  ratio   (%)   after  storage under  the   same  conditions  was  determined.     Furthermore,   a difference  (point)  between the retention ratio  (%)  of this control and the  retention  ratio of  the Examples  and Comparative Examples<br>
was  determined.<br>
(Test  Example  2)<br>
In the same manner as in Test Example 1, except that a 0 . 005% isosorbide nitrate solution was used in place of the nitroglycerin solution, steam sterilization under high pressure and storage at 60GC for 2 weeks were conducted. Then, the concentration of isosorbide nitrate in the solution after storage for 2 weeks was measured by HPLC and a ratio of the resulting concentration to an initial concentratio was determined and taken as a retention ratio   (%)   in  the  same  manner  as   in  Test  Example   1.<br>
In the same manner as in Test Example 1,  a control test using a glass  ampul  was  conducted and  a  difference  (point)  between  the retention  ratio   (%)   of  this  control  and  the  retention  ratio  of the  Examples   and  Comparative  Examples  was  determined. (Test   Example   3)<br>
With  respect  to  the  medicine  bag   (medicine  containers) obtained  in  Examples  8  to  10  and Comparative  Example  3,   the  same test  as  in  Test  Example  2  was  conducted.<br>
The  above  results  are  shown  in  Table  3.<br>
(Table removed)<br>
As shown in Table 1, the multi-layer films used in Examples 1 to 7 and the medicine bags of Examples 1 to 7 correspond to the multi-layer film and the medicine container using the same of the present   invention.<br>
As is apparent from the results of the retention ratio shown in Table 3, according to the medicine containers of Examples 1 to 7, the adsorption amount of the medicine could be held down to the minimum.. For example, the adsorption amount (retention ratio) was the same as or slightly more than the case of using the glass ampul. Furthermore, all of the medicine containers of Examples  1  to 7  had a sufficient  strength suited for use as  the<br>
medicine container,  and excellent  flexibility and excellent heat resistance.     Since  the  medicine  container   (especially  a   seal layer)   is made mainly of  an  ethylene-α-olefin  copolymer,   it  was superior  in  safety  suited  for  use  as   a  medical  material.<br>
On the other hand, in Comparative Example 1 wherein the barrier layer has a small content of the cyclic olefin polymer and Comparative Example'2 wherein the seal layer which is directly contacted with the liquid medicine is too thick, the adsorption amount.of   the  medicine  was  very  large.<br>
As shown in Table 2, the multi-layer films used in Examples 8 to 10 and the medicine bags of Examples 8 to 10 correspond to the ntulti-layer film and the medicine container using the same of   the  present   invention.<br>
As is apparent from the results of the retention ratio shown in Table 3, according to the medicine containers of Examples 8 to 10, the adsorption amount of the medicine could be held down to the minimum. Moreover, since the seal layer had a sufficient thickness, the medicine container itself was remarkably superior in  durability.<br>
On the other hand, in the medicine container of Comparative Example 3 wherein the seal layer is too thick, the adsorption amount of  the  medicine  was  very  large.<br>
. As'-is apparent from the above results, the multi-layer film and the medicine container using the same of the present invention can be  suited tor use  as  a medical material  for accommodating  and<br>
storing  a  medicine  and  a   liquid  medicine,   especially  in  the application where a medicine,  which is likely 'to be adsorbed into polyethylene,   such  as  nitroglycerin  is  pre-mixed.<br>

The multi-layer film can suppress adsorption of a medicine by the barrier layer and is suited for use as a material for the production of a medicine container because of its excellent strength and excellent   flexibility.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
