Application No. 200710181372.9, filed on Oct 20, 2007, both of which are hereby<br>

Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a wideband radio access technology, and in<br>
particular, to a method and apparatus for responding to a scanning request.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WIMAX) system, also called<br>
an 802.16 wireless metropolitan area network (MAN), can cover data communication<br>
areas of 25 to 30 miles.<br>
The WIMAX technology is based on wideband radio standards among 802.16<br>
series proposed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). So far, the<br>
IEEE 802.16 series include seven standards: IEEE 802.16, IEEE 802.16a, IEEE 802.16c,<br>
IEEE 802.16d, IEEE 802.16e, IEEE 802.16f, and IEEE 802.16g. EEE 802.16, IEEE<br>
802.16a, and IEEE 802.16d are fixed radio access air interface standards, while IEEE<br>
802.16e is a mobile wideband radio access air interface standard. WIMAX uses IEEE<br>
802.16e as the air interface protocol.<br>
IEEE 802.16e is compatible with earlier IEEE 802.16d. IEEE 802.16e and IEEE<br>
802.16d are the same in physical layer implementation mode, and have the following<br>
difference: IEEE 802.16e has extended orthogonal frequency division multiple access<br>
(OFDMA) to meet different carrier bandwidth requirements. To support mobility, IEEE<br>
802.16e introduces a lot of new features in the media access control layer (MAC). By<br><br>
introducing new technologies such as orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM)<br>
and multiple input multiple output (MIMO), the radio access technology develops towards<br>
higher capacity, wider coverage and mobility for a wideband radio system. The radio<br>
access technology coexists with and supplements the 3G network technology. Thus, the<br>
IEEE 802.16e technology has been a hot topic in the industry since its emergence.<br>
Based on IEEE 802.16e, WIMAX proposes a new enhanced technologyâ€”IEEE<br>
802.16m. Currently, IEEE 802.16m specifies the following requirements: Mobile objects<br>
at the speed of 350 kilometers per hour are supported; the maximum downlink data<br>
transmission rate should be over 350 Mbps; the uplink data transmission rate should not be<br>
smaller than 200 Mbps; the bandwidth ranges from 5 MHz, 10 MHz, 20 MHz to 40MHz;<br>
and a maximum of 4x4 MIMOs can be used. When a 20 MHz bandwidth is used and<br>
communications are based on time division duplex (TDD), IEEE 802.16m requires that<br>
the downlink data transmission rate should be 40 Mbps and the uplink data transmission<br>
rate should be over 12 Mbps. In addition, IEEE 802.16m requires that the link layer access<br>
duration and handover delay should be less than 10 ms and 20 ms. Furthermore, IEEE<br>
802.16m should be compatible with IEEE 802.16e.<br>
The WIMAX system consists of base stations (BSs) and mobile stations (MSs). A<br>
BS communicates with an MS through electromagnetic waves transmitted and received by<br>
a radio transceiver. Each BS has a unique base station identity (BS ID), which is a 48-bit<br>
field. Each BS has its coverage, and may communicate with each BS in its coverage. Each<br>
BS sends a neighbor cell broadcast (MOBNBRADV) message to BSs and MSs in a<br>
certain area on a timed basis, and stores the MOBNBRADV message. The MSs receive<br>
and store the MOB_NBR_ADV message. The MOBNBRADV message comprises BS<br>
IDs of the BSs in a certain area, where the BS IDs are arranged in sequence in the<br>
MOBNBRADV message. Each BS may communicate with multiple MSs in its<br>
coverage at the same time. However, one MS can communicate with only one BS at the<br>
same time, and the BS is the serving BS of the MS. As the MS keeps moving, the MS may<br><br>
go through coverage areas of muhiple BSs. In this case, the serving BS of the MS may be<br>
changed. During the movement, the MS may use a different BS that meets communication<br>
quality requirements as its serving BS to continue its communications. This process is<br>
known as handover. To ensure the continuity of communications and reduces possible<br>
interruptions of communications due to the handover, the MS needs to detect the signal<br>
quality of each adjacent BS to determine a target BS for handover when maintaining<br>
normal communications with the current serving BS. This detection process is called<br>
scanning. In this way, the MS may be handed over to a new BS with better communication<br>
quality when handover is required. Thus, the scanning process is a key step to ensure<br>
smooth handover.<br>
FIG 1 shows a scanning process in the prior art. The scanning process message<br>
includes a mobile scanning response (MOBSCNRSP) and a mobile scanning request<br>
(MOBSCNREQ). A MOBSCN-RSP message shall be transmitted by the BS either<br>
unsolicitedly or in response to a MOBSCN-REQ message sent by an MS. By sending the<br>
MOB_SCN_RSP message, the BS notifies the MS receiving the MOBSCNRSP of the<br>
scanning start time, scanning type and BS ID of a BS to be scanned.<br>
Both the MOB_SCN_RSP message and the MOBSCNREQ message include BS<br>
ID information. By carrying the BS ID information in the MOB_SCN_RSP message, the<br>
BS notifies the MS receiving the MOB_SCN_RSP message of which BSs are to be<br>
scanned. By carrying the BS ID information in the MOB_SCN_REQ message, the MS<br>
notifies its serving BS of which BSs are to be scanned. The MOB_SCN_RSP message and<br>
the MOBSCNREQ message also carry a scanning type field. Each BS ID in the<br>
MOBSCNRSP message and the MOBSCNREQ message corresponds to a scanning<br>
type.<br>
In the prior art, the BS ID information in the MOBSCNRSP message and the<br>
MOBSCNREQ message is divided into two parts. The first part of BS ID information in<br>
the MOBSCNREQ message corresponds to the BS IDs included in an<br><br>
MOBNBRADV message sent by the serving BS of an MS that sends the<br>
MOBSCNREQ message, and the second part is the IDs of BSs that are unsolicitedly<br>
scanned by the MS but not included in the MOBNBRADV message. One part of the BS<br>
ID information in the MOBSCNRSP message corresponds to the BS IDs included in an<br>
MOB_NBR_ADV message of a BS that sends the MOBSCNRSP message, and the<br>
second part is full base station identities (Full BS IDs) sent by the BS, where each full BS<br>
ID is represented by 48 bits. Among the second part of BS IDs in the MOB_SCN_RSP<br>
message, some are sent by the BS to respond to the MOBSCNREQ message, and some<br>
are unsolicitedly scanned by the BS but not included in the MOBSCNREQ message.<br>
Among the BS IDs in the scanning message, the part included in the<br>
MOB_NBR_ADV is represented in BS Index mode in IEEE 802.16e. That is, each of the<br>
BS IDs is represented by its sequence in the MOBNBRADV message. The second part<br>
in the scanning message is represented in Full BS ID mode.<br>
The number of BS IDs in the MOBNBRADV message is usually smaller than<br>
255. Thus, only 8 bits are needed in BS Index mode, while 48 bits are needed in Full BS<br>
ID mode. Compared with the Full BS ID mode, the BS Index mode saves 40 bits per BS<br>
requesting the scanning.<br>
IEEE802.16e uses the Full BS ID mode rather than the BS Index mode to represent<br>
the second part of the BS IDs because these BS IDs are not included in the<br>
MOB_NBR_ADV<br>
FIG 2 shows a format of an MOB_SCN_REQ message in the prior art.<br>
The MOB_SCN_REQ message is composed of fields, each of which is represented<br>
by a number or letter. The following describes each field.<br>

the BS IDs mapped by field II.<br>
When the value of field 5 is 0, fields 6-9 and field A are nonexistent.<br>
Field A includes repeated contents of fields 7-9 in turn. The number of repetitions<br>
is equal to the value of field 5.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
During tiie implementation of the present invention, the inventor discovers at least<br>
the following problems in the prior art:<br>
Because one part of the BS IDs in a scanning process message may correspond to<br>
the BS IDs in the MOBNBRADV message, this part of the BS IDs is represented in BS<br>
Index mode in the prior art. When the BS IDs are represented in BS Index mode, each BS<br>
needs 8 bits only; when the BS IDs are represented in Full BS ID mode, each BS needs 48<br>
bit. Thus, if the first part of the BS IDs is represented in BS Index mode, the utilization<br>
rate of air interface resources is improved. However, the second part of the BS IDs is still<br>
represented in Full BS ID mode, which consumes high air interface resources. Because the<br>
air interface resources are valuable, how to improve the utilization rate of air interface<br>
resources is still an urgent problem to be solved for the wideband radio access system.<br>
The technical solution of the present invention is hereinafter described in detail<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings. It is evident that the embodiments are only<br>
exemplary embodiments of the present invention and the present invention is not limited<br>
to such embodiments. Other embodiments that those skilled in the art obtain based on<br>
embodiments of the present invention without creative work also fall in the scope of<br>
protection of the present invention.<br>
For better understanding of the objective, technical solution and merits of the<br>
present invention, the present invention is hereinafter described in detail with reference to<br>
accompanying drawings and exemplary embodiments.<br>
First embodiment: After receiving an MOBSCNREQ message from the MS, the<br>
BS sends an MOBSCNRSP message to the MS, responding to the scanning request of<br>
the MS.<br><br>
Among the BS IDs in the MOBSCNRSP message, the first part corresponds to<br>
the BS IDs included in the MOBNBRADV message sent by the BS; the second part is<br>
sent by the BS to respond to the MOBNBRREQ message; the third part is the BS IDs<br>
that the BS intends to scan and that are not included in the MOBSCNREQ message.<br>
The second part of the BS IDs is already carried in the MOBSCNREQ message and is<br>
sequenced. For the second part of the BS IDs, the first embodiment optimizes the<br>
MOBSCNRSP message as follows: A BS ID sequence indication field is set to map the<br>
second part of the BS IDs. The BS ID sequence indication field may be set in BS Index<br>
mode or in BS Bitmap mode. In BS Index mode, the BS ID sequence indication field is set<br>
to a BS Index field; in BS Bitmap mode, the BS ID sequence indication field is set to a BS<br>
Bitmap field.<br>
The second part of the BS IDs sent by the BS to respond to the MOBSCNREQ<br>
message may be set in two modes. First, the BS responds to all BS IDs carried in the<br>
MOB_SCN_REQ message, where all the BS IDs include BS IDs mapped in Full BS ID<br>
mode and in other modes; second, the BS responds to the BS IDs that are mapped in Full<br>
BS ID mode and carried in the MOBSCNREQ message.<br>
The following describes the method provided in the first embodiment based on the<br>
first mode.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a scanning process in which the BS responds to an MOBSCNREQ<br>
message sent from the MS according to the method provided in the first embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Step 401: The MS sends to the BS an MOB_SCN_REQ message in which the<br>
carried BS IDs are arranged in sequence. For example, if the MOB_SCN_REQ message<br>
carries a total of three BS IDs, the BS IDs are arranged as follows: BS IDI, BS ID2, BS<br>
ID3.<br>
Step 402: After receiving the MOB_SCN_REQ message from the MS, the BS<br>
sends an MOB_SCN_RSP message to the MS, where the MOB_SCN_RSP message maps<br><br>
all the BS IDs carried in the MOBSCNREQ message in BS Bitmap mode or BS Index<br>
mode.<br>
The BS Index mode provided in the first embodiment is the same as that in the<br>
prior art except for the following difference: The sequence in BS Index mode provided in<br>
the first embodiment is the sequence of the BS IDs that are already carried in the<br>
MOBSCNREQ message. In BS Index mode, the BS IDs carried in the<br>
MOBSCNREQ message are mapped as follows by using the BS Index field: Each BS<br>
ID has an index to indicate the sequence, and is identified by the index. For example, if the<br>
index of a BS ID is 1 in the MOB_SCN_REQ message, I is used to identify the BS ID in<br>
the MOB_SCN_RSP message. In BS Index mode, the value of the BS Index field is set to<br>
the index to map the BS ID. In the first embodiment, only 8 bits are needed to map a BS<br>
ID in BS Index mode. In contrast, 48 bits are needed in Full BS ID mode in the prior art.<br>
In this embodiment, a BS Bitmap field is set in the MOBSCNRSP message to<br>
represent the second part of the BS IDs in the MOB_SCN_RSP message in BS Bitmap<br>
mode. The BS Bitmap field maps the BS ID. Preferably, the number of bits in the BS<br>
Bitmap field is equal to the total number of BS IDs in the MOBSCNREQ message.<br>
Each bit in the BS Bitmap is mapped to a BS ID among all the BS IDs. The sequence of<br>
bits in the BS Bitmap field is mapped to the sequence of all the BS IDs. For example, the<br>
first bit in the BS Bitmap field is mapped to the first BS ID among all the BS IDs. Each bit<br>
in the BS Bitmap field uses 0 or 1 to indicate whether to request to scan a BS represented<br>
by the BS ID that is mapped to the bit. For example, if a bit in the BS Bitmap field is set to<br>
1 according to an agreement, the BS requests to scan a BS represented by the BS ID that is<br>
mapped to the bit.<br>
In practical applications, the number of bits in the BS Bitmap field may be smaller<br>
than the total number of BS IDs. In this case, a bit in the BS Bitmap field is mapped to<br>
multiple BS IDs among all the BS IDs. That is, when the MOBSCNRSP message has<br>
one or multiple BS IDs, the bit mapped to multiple BS IDs is set to an agreed value. The<br><br>
number of bits in the BS Bitmap field may also be greater than the total number of BS IDs.<br>
In this case, multiple bits in the BS Bitmap field are mapped to a BS ID among all the BS<br>
IDs. When the number of bits in the BS Bitmap field is smaller or greater than the total<br>
number of BS IDs, the BS Bitmap field may be used with reference to the scenario where<br>
the number of bits in the BS Bitmap field is equal to the total number of BS IDs in the<br>
MOBSCNREQ message. A reserved bit may also be set in the BS Bitmap field, which<br>
is not used to map all the BS IDs.<br>
To map the BS IDs, the BS Bitmap field may map all the BS IDs or part of the BS<br>
IDs that the MS requests to scan. For the specific mapping method in these two modes,<br>
refer to related descriptions of embodiments of the present invention. For the mapping<br>
between the BS index field and the BS IDs, refer to related descriptions of the mapping<br>
between the BS Bitmap field and the BS IDs.<br>
Compared with the Full BS ID mode in the prior art in which 48 bits are needed,<br>
only one bit is needed to map a BS ID in BS Bitmap mode.<br>
In the preceding first mode, the index in BS Index mode is the index of the BS ID<br>
among all the BS IDs.<br>
When the BS Index mode is used in the second mode, the index of a BS ID is the<br>
index of the Full BS ID among all the BS IDs mapped in Full BS ID mode in an<br>
MOB_SCN_REQ message. Preferably, when the BS Bitmap mode is used, the number of<br>
bits in the BS Bitmap field is equal to the number of BS IDs mapped in Full BS ID mode<br>
in the MOBSCNREQ message. In the preceding second mode, the BS Index mode and<br>
the BS Bitmap mode may be used with reference to the first mode, and will not be further<br>
described.<br>
Preferably, a carrying indication field is set in a current MOBSCNRSP message<br>
to indicate whether the MOB_SCN_RSP message comprises BS IDs that are already<br>
carried in an MOBSCNREQ message. This indication field may use one of six bits<br>
reserved in the current MOB_SCN_RSP message, one of other fields in the current<br><br>
MOBSCNRSP message or a new field with a variable length. The carrying indication<br>
field is optional. Without the carrying indication field, the MOBSCNRSP message may<br>
also use the BS Bitmap mode or BS Index mode directly.<br>
FIG 5 shows a format of an MOBSCNRSP message in BS Index mode.<br>
Compared with FIG. 3, FIG. 5 has the following differences: An MSR Ind field is<br>
inserted between field 3 and field 4; fields 19-22, field D and field F are inserted between<br>
field B and field E. The following describes each field shown in FIG. 5.<br>
Fields 1-3, fields 4-14, field A, field D between field 14 and field A, and field E<br>
shown in FIG. 5 are the same as those fields with the same labels and relative positions<br>
shown in FIG 3 in terms of contents and meanings. Compared with the fields with the<br>
same labels and relative positions shown in FIG. 3, fields 15-18, field B and field D<br>
between field B and field 18 shown in FIG. 5 have only the following difference: The BS<br>
IDs in those fields shown in FIG. 5 are BS IDs that a BS intends to scan, that is, the third<br>
part of BS IDs.<br>
In FIG. 5, field 19 is used to map the number of BS IDs that are already carried in<br>
the MOB_SCN_REQ message and should be carried in the MOBSCNRSP message,<br>
that is, the number of the second part of BS IDs. Field 19 is 8 bits long; field 20 is an<br>
index of the BS ID in the MOBSCNREQ message and is 8 bits long; field 21 is a<br>
reserved field of 1 bit; field 22 indicates a scanning type of the BS ID mapped in field 20;<br>
field D between field 22 and field F is 24 bits long and is present only when the scanning<br>
type is scanning type 2 or scanning type 3; field F is used to repeat the contents in fields<br>
19-22 and field D, and the number of repetitions is equal to the value of field 19.<br>
The MSR Ind field is the carrying indication field, which is used to indicate<br>
whether the MOBSCNRSP message comprises BS IDs that are already carried in the<br>
MOBSCNREQ message. For example, when the value of the MSR Ind field is agreed to<br>
be 1, the MOBSCNRSP message comprises BS IDs that are already carried in the<br>
MOBSCNREQ message. If the value of the MSR Ind field is agreed to be 1, fields<br><br>
19-22, field F, and field D between field F and field 22 are present; otherwise these fields<br>
are nonexistent.<br>
FIG 6 shows a process of setting the format of an MOBSCNRSP message.<br>
Step 601: Set fields 1-3, the MSR Ind field, and fields 4-6.<br>
Step 602: Judge whether the value of field 2 is a non-zero value; if so, proceed to<br>
step 603; otherwise, go to step 610.<br>
Step 603: Set fields 7-10.<br>
Step 604: Judge whether the value of field 10 is a non-zero value; if so, proceed to<br>
step 605; otherwise, go to step 606.<br>
Step 605: Set fields 11-14, field A, and field D between field A and field 14.<br>
Step 606: Set fields 15-18, field B, and field D between field B and field 18.<br>
Step 607: Judge whether the value of the MSR Ind field is 1; if so, proceed to step<br>
608; otherwise, go to step 609.<br>
Step 608: Set fields 19-22, field F, and field D between field F and field 22.<br>
Step 609: Set field E.<br>
Step 610: The setting process ends.<br>
For the method for setting each field shown in FIG 6, refer to related descriptions<br>
of embodiments of the present invention, and the method will not be further described.<br>
In FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, the carrying indication field MSR Ind may use one of six bits<br>
reserved in the MOB_SCN_RSP message. In practical applications, the MSR Ind field<br>
may use one or multiple bits among other bits or a new field with a variable length in the<br>
MOBSCNRSP message.<br>
When the second part of the BS IDs in the MOB_SCN_RSP message is<br>
represented in BS Bitmap mode, the diflference between the format of the<br>
MOBSCNRSP message and that shown in FIG. 5 is as follows: Fields 19-22 shown in<br>
FIG 5 are replaced with the BS Bitmap field; field D between field F and field 22 shown<br><br>
in FIG. 5 is replaced witii the BS Bitmap scanning type field; and field F is present only<br>
when the BS Bitmap scanning type field comprises scanning type 2 or scanning type 3.<br>
For the method for setting the BS Bitmap field, refer to related descriptions of<br>
embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Bits in the BS Bitmap scanning type field indicate a scanning type. Starting from<br>
the initial bit of the scanning field, every 3 bits indicate a scanning type. The sequence of<br>
scanning types corresponds to the values and sequences of bits in the BS Bitmap field.<br>
This is described in detail with reference to FIG. 7.<br>
The BS Bitmap field in FIG. 7 is 5 bits long, and indicates that the number of BS<br>
IDs carried in the MOBSCNREQ message is 5. The first bit in FIG. 7 corresponds to the<br>
first BS ID in the MOBSCNREQ message, and the rest of bits correspond to the rest of<br>
BS IDs in the MOBSCNREQ message in turn. In FIG 7, when the value of a bit is 1,<br>
the BS requests to scan a BS represented by a BS ID that is mapped to the bit, and the bit<br>
corresponds to a 3-bit scanning type field. Scanning types that correspond to each bit<br>
whose value is 1 in the BS Bitmap field are arranged in the sequence of the bits. As shown<br>
in FIG 7, the values of the second bit and the fourth bit in the BS Bitmap field are I. Thus,<br>
the scanning type that corresponds to the second bit is represented by the first 3 bits in the<br>
BS Bitmap scanning type field, while the scanning type that corresponds to the fourth bit<br>
is represented by the second 3 bits in the BS Bitmap scanning type field. In the BS Bitmap<br>
scanning type field shown in FIG. 7, 0, 1 and 2 indicate that the bit is bit 0, bit 1 and bit 2<br>
in the 3 bits.<br>
If the second part of BS IDs in the MOBSCNRSP message uses the BS Bitmap<br>
mode, the process of setting the MOBSCNRSP message is similar to that shown in FIG<br>
6 except that step 608 is changed as follows:<br>
Set the BS Bitmap field, BS Bitmap scanning type field and field F.<br>
In this embodiment, the MOBSCNRSP message is optimized. For BS IDs that<br>
are already carried in the MOBSCNREQ message, the BS Index mode or BS Bitmap<br><br>
mode is used in the MOBSCNRSP message to map the BS IDs. In BS Index mode, only<br>
8 bits are needed to map each BS ID; in BS Bitmap mode, at least one bit is needed to map<br>
each BS ID. In current Full BS ID mode, 48 bits are needed to map each BS ID. Thus, the<br>
method provided in this embodiment of the present invention may greatly improve the<br>
utilization rate of air interface resources.<br>
Second embodiment: A message ID field is set in a scanning process message to<br>
identify each scanning process message, so that the MOB_SCN_REQ matches the<br>
MOBSCNRSP message. When multiple scanning processes are available at a time, the<br>
message ID field may specify which MOBSCNREQ message matches an<br>
MOBSCNRSP message. Thus, the message ID field may be used to match the<br>
MOB_SCN_REQ message with the MOBSCNRSP message. The message ID field may<br>
be named "Configuration change count for MOBSCNREQ", "Transaction ID" or<br>
"Sequence Number". The length of the message ID field may be 1-32 bits or more. The<br>
message ID field may be a new field with a variable length, an existing field, or one or<br>
multiple bits of an existing field in the scanning process message.<br>
The following gives an example to describe how to use the message ID field.<br>
Supposing the message ID field is 2 bits long, the message ID field may match four pairs<br>
of scanning process messages because 2 bits may represent four numbers, that is, 0-3. The<br>
specific matching method is as follows: A message ID field is set in an MOBSCNREQ<br>
message and an MOBSCNRSP message; when the value of the message ID field in the<br>
MOBSCNRSP message is the same as that in the MOBSCNREQ message, the<br>
MOBSCNRSP message matches the MOBSCNREQ message. For example, when an<br>
MS sends an MOBSCNREQ message, the MS sets the ID field in the MOBSCNREQ<br>
message to 1; after a BS receives the MOB_SCN_REQ message, the BS sends an<br>
MOB_SCN_RSP message, and also sets the message ID field in the MOB_SCN_RSP<br>
message to 1, which specifies that the MOBSCNRSP message matches the<br>
MOB_SCN_REQ message with the ID 1.<br><br>
A message ID field is added to a scanning process message to specify which<br>
MOBSCNREQ message matches an MOBSCNRSP message. In this case, errors may<br>
be avoided when the method provided in the first embodiment of the present invention is<br>
used to scan. The reasons are as follows: If the message ID field is not included in the<br>
scanning process message, the MOBSCNRSP message matches a latest<br>
MOBSCNREQ message that the MS sends according to the prior art; however, after the<br>
MS sends an MOBSCNREQ message actively, a BS does not receive the message due<br>
to transmission errors; in this case, the BS sends an MOBSCNRSP message to the MS<br>
actively, but the MS cannot judge whether the MOBSCNRSP matches the<br>
MOBSCNREQ message or is sent by the BS actively. In this embodiment, the<br>
preceding errors are avoided because a message ID field is used to match the scanning<br>
process messages.<br>
After a message ID field is added to the scanning process messages, the preceding<br>
errors are avoided and multiple scanning processes may be initiated by the MS or BS. The<br>
following describes this embodiment in detail, supposing the MS initiates multiple<br>
scanning processes.<br>
FIG. 8 shows multiple scanning processes initiated by an MS after a message ID<br>
field is added.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the MS sends two MOBSCNREQ messages to a BS. The<br>
message ID field is set to 1 in one MOBSCNREQ message and to 2 in the other<br>
MOB_SCN_REQ message. The BS sends two MOBSCNRSP messages. The message<br>
ID field is set to 1 in one MOBSCNREQ message and to 2 in the other<br>
MOB_SCN_REQ message. After receiving the MOBSCNRSP messages, the MS may<br>
know that the MOB_SCN_RSP message with the message ID field 2 matches the<br>
MOB_SCN_REQ message with the message ID field 2, and that the MOB_SCN_RSP<br>
message with the message ID field 1 matches the MOBSCNREQ message with the<br>
message ID field 1. Thus, when an MS sends multiple MOBSCNREQ messages, the<br><br>
MS may judge which MOBSCNREQ message matches an MOBSCNRSP message<br>
according to the message ID field. The initiating of multiple scanning processes by the MS<br>
may be: initiating multiple scanning processes by the MS at the same time, or initiating<br>
multiple scanning processes in sequence by the MS.<br>
Third embodiment: A mode indication field is further set in a scanning process<br>
message to indicate whether the scanning process message uses the BS Bitmap mode or<br>
BS Index mode. The mode indication filed is used to indicate which mode a current<br>
scanning process message uses. Subsequent scanning process messages will use the mode<br>
indicated by the mode indication field. It should be noted that a message may use either<br>
the BS Index mode or the BS Bitmap mode only. The message can select a proper mode<br>
according to the actual situation. The mode indication field may be a format indication bit<br>
(FMT bit), a field including multiple bits, or a bit in the mode indicafion field.<br>

scanning request.<br>
The apparatus comprises a receiving unit, a sending unit, and a sequence indicating<br>
unit, where: the receiving unit is adapted to receive an MOB_SCN_REQ message; the<br>
sending unit is adapted to send an MOBSCNRSP message; and the sequence indicating<br>
unit is adapted to map an information unit in the receiving unit.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus further comprises an information unit, which is adapted to<br>
store BS IDs in the MOB_SCN_REQ message received by the receiving unit. The<br>
information unit may further include a mode indication unit, which is adapted to indicate a<br>
structure of the sequence indicating unit.<br>
The information unit may further include a carrying indication unit, which is<br>
adapted to indicate whether the receiving unit includes the information unit.<br>

Bitmap unit.<br><br>
The BS Bitmap unit comprises a subunit, whicii is adapted to map tiie information<br>
unit. The location of the subunit corresponds to the sequence of the BS ID in the<br>
MOBSCNREQ message. The subunit is set to indicate whether the scanning message<br>
comprises the BS ID of the sequence. The number of subunits may be equal to the number<br>
of information units or number of Full BS IDs in the information unit.<br>
The apparatus provided in this embodiment further comprises a<br>
reception/transmission identifying unit, which is adapted to match the MOBSCNRSP<br>
message sent by the sending unit with the MOBSCNREQ message received by the<br>

The information unit comprises a carrying indication unit and a mode indication<br>
unit, and the sequence indicating unit comprises a BS Bitmap unit and a BS Index unit.<br>
The receiving unit 910 receives an MOBSCNREQ message, and stores the BS<br>
ID in the MOBSCNREQ message in the information unit 912; the<br>
reception/transmission identifying unit 911 in the receiving unit stores the message ID<br>
field in the MOB_SCN_REQ message.<br>
The carrying indication unit 920 receives a message from the receiving unit 910<br>
and judges whether the information unit 912 exists; if so, the carrying indication unit 920<br>
sends carrying indication information to the sequence indicating unit 930; after receiving<br>
the carrying indication information, the sequence indicating unit 930 receives the message<br>
from the receiving unit 910; the sequence indicating unit 930 is adapted to: map BS IDs in<br><br>
the information unit 912, obtain BS ID sequence indication information after tiie mapping,<br>
and send the BS ID sequence indication information to the sending unit 940. The sending<br>
unit 940 receives the BS ID sequence indication information, and sets the message ID field<br>
in the reception/transmission identifying unit 941 of the sending unit to a value that the is<br>
same as or corresponds to the value of the message ID field in the reception/transmission<br>
identifying unit 911 of the receiving unit. Then, the sending unit 940 sends an<br>
MOB_SCN_RSP message externally, where the MOB_SCN_RSP message carries the BS<br>
ID sequence indication information and the message ID field.<br>
The sequence indicating unit 930 may use the structure of the BS Bitmap unit 931<br>
or BS Index unit 932. The mode indication unit 950 sends mode indication information to<br>
the sequence indicating unit 930 to indicate whether the sequence indicating unit 930 uses<br>
the structure of the BS Bitmap unit 931 or the BS Index unit 932. It should be noted that<br>
only the BS Bitmap unit 931 or the BS Index unit 932 is available.<br>
In practical applications, there may be one or multiple information units 912.<br>
When there are multiple information units 912, each of the information units is arranged in<br>
a sequence same as that of BS IDs in the MOBSCNREQ message.<br>
The BS Bitmap unit 931 comprises a subunit, which is not illustrated in FIG 9.<br>
The location of the subunit corresponds to the location of the information unit 912. The<br>
subunit is set to indicate whether the MOB_SCN_RSP message comprises contents of the<br>
information unit.<br>
The BS Index unit 932 is set according to the location of an information unit<br>
among all the information units 912 that stores BS IDs that the apparatus 900 wants to<br>
carry in the MOBSCNRSP message. The number of BS Index units 932 is equal to the<br>
number of BS IDs that the apparatus 900 wants to carry in the MOB_SCN_REQ message<br>
and that are also included in the MOBSCNREQ message.<br>
In FIG. 9, the units 920, 950, 911 and 941 are optional units.<br><br>

The following further describes the system provided in this embodiment with<br>
reference to FIG. 10.<br>
In FIG. 10, 1000 represents the BS; 1001 represents the MS; 1060 represents the<br>

represents the sending unit of the BS; 1041 represents the reception/transmission<br>
identifying unit in the sending unit 1040 of the BS; and 1050 represents the mode<br>
indication unit.<br><br>
The internal structure of the BS 1000 shown in FIG. 10 corresponds to that of the<br>
apparatus 900 shown in FIG. 9 according to the last two digits of the numbers in the<br>
drawings and so is the mapping relation between the units. That is, the last two digits of<br>
the BS 1000 are the same as those of the apparatus 900 in the drawings, and so are the<br>
internal structures of the units represented by the numbers in the drawings and mapping<br>
relation between the units.<br>
In FIG. 10, the sending unit 1060 of the MS 1001 sends an MOBSCNREQ<br>
message to the receiving unit 1010 of the BS 1000, where the MOBSCNREQ message<br>
carries a message ID field generated by the reception/transmission identifying unit 1061;<br>
the receiving unit 1070 of the MS 1001 receives an MOB_SCN_RSP message from the<br>
sending unit 1040 of the BS 1000, and stores a message ID field carried in the<br>
MOB_SCN_RSP message in the reception/transmission identifying unit 1071; the<br>
reception/transmission identifying unit 1071 receives the message ID field from the<br>
reception/transmission identifying unit 1061, and judges whether the message ID field<br>
carried in the MOBSCNRSP message is the same as or corresponds to the message ID<br>
field sent from the reception/transmission identifying unit 1061; if so, the<br>
MOBSCNRSP message matches the MOB_SCN_REQ message; otherwise, the<br>

According to the preceding solution, an MOBSCNRSP message is optimized.<br>
For BS IDs that are already carried in an MOB_SCN_REQ message, the MOB_SCN_RSP<br>
message provided in embodiments of the present invention is represented in BS Index<br><br>
mode or BS Bitmap mode. The sequences used in BS Index mode and BS Bitmap mode<br>
are sequences of the BS IDs in the MOBSCNREQ message. When the<br>
MOBSCNRSP message is represented in BS Index mode or BS Bitmap mode, each of<br>
BS IDs that are already carried in the MOBSCNREQ message is represented by 8 bits<br>
or 1 bit only. In contrast, 48 bits are needed in Full BS ID mode in the prior art. Thus, the<br>
method provided in embodiments of the present invention can greatly improve the<br>
utilization of air interface resources.<br>
In embodiments of the present invention, a message ID field is further set to match<br>
the MOB_SCN_RSP message with the MOB_SCN_REQ message, so that the MS or BS<br>
can initiate multiple scanning processes without errors during the matching between the<br>
MOBSCNRSP message and the MOB_SCN_REQ message.<br>
In embodiments of the present invention, a mode indication mode is further set to<br>
indicate whether a current scanning process message uses the BS Bitmap mode or BS<br>
Index mode, which can achieve the compatibility between the BS Bitmap mode and the<br>
BS Index mode. Thus, different modes may be selected according to different scenarios,<br>
and the utilization of air interface resources may be maximized.<br>
Through the preceding description of embodiments of the present invention, it is<br>
understandable to those skilled in the art that embodiments of the present invention may<br>
be implemented by hardware or by software in combination with a necessary hardware<br>
platform. Thus, the technical solution of the present invention may be made into software.<br>
The software may be stored in a non-volatile storage medium (for example, a CD-ROM, a<br>
USB disk, or a mobile hard disk), and include several instructions that instruct a computer<br>
device (a personal computer, a server, or a network device) to execute the method<br>
provided in each embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Although the present invention has been described through several exemplary<br>
embodiments, the invention is not limited to such embodiments. It is apparent that those<br>
skilled in the art can make various modifications and variations to the invention without<br><br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The invention is intended to cover the<br>

Dated this 29* day of December 2009<br><br><br>
A method for responding to a scanning request comprises these steps: A base station<br>
(BS) receives a mobile scanning request (MOB_SCN_REQ) from a mobile station (MS);<br>
the BS responds to the MOB_SCN_REQ message and sends a mobile scanning response<br>
(MOB_SCN_RSP) to the MS, where the MOB_SCN_RSP message comprises a base<br>
station identity (BS ID) sequence indication field that maps BS IDs carried in the<br>
MOB_SCN_REQ message. An apparatus for responding to a scanning request comprises a<br>
sequence indicating unit. The method and apparatus may improve the utilization of air<br>
interface resources.</td>
