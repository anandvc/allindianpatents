<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
<br>
The present invention relates to microcapsules comprising fat-soluble active substances having a low content of free surface fat, a process for preparing such microcapsules as well as their use and products comprising the microcapsules.<br>
<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
<br>
Products comprising fat-soluble active substances encapsulated in a hydrocolloid matrix find wide spread use in all kinds of human and animal products, such as food, food supplements, beverages, pharmaceutical, agricultural and veterinary products and personal care products. The purpose is to protect the oxidation sensitive active substance from oxygen and other substances, which attack the substance in order to avoid off-flavour and loss of physiological activity, e.g. during transport, and to increase the shelf life of the products.<br>
<br>
When encapsulating fat-soluble active substances an important and acknowledged quality parameter is the content of free surface fat. If the product is not substantially free of free surface fat, e.g. if the content of free surface fat in a product comprising polyunsatutared fatty acids (PUFA's) is more than 1-2 %, the quality of the product is significantly impaired and the product will quickly deteriorate through oxidation. PUFA-products complying with this quality parameter normally can not hold more than 25-30 % of active substance. Besides, products comprising an increased content of fat-soluble active substance must traditionally be produced by using also an increased amount of hydrocolloid.<br>
<br>
Hogan et al in J. Agric. Food Chem. (2001) Vol 49, No. 4, pages 1934-1938, describes microencapsulating properties of sodium caseinate when used in emulsions of soy oils. The effect of increasing the oil/protein ratio on protein load is tested, and it appears that increasing the oil/protein ratio from 0.25 to 3.0 resulted in a progressive decrease in microencapsulation efficiency.<br>
<br>
Vega et al in Jour. Dairy Sci. (2006) Vol. 89, No. 2, pages 383-401 describes emulsions with oil-to-protein ratios ranging from 0.25 to 5. Surface fat was reduced from 30 % to less than 5 %, when lactose was added to an emulsion containing 30 % oil.<br>
<br>
Vega et al in Int. Dairy Jour. (2007) Vol. 17, No. 6, pages 683-695 describes spray drying of an anhydrous milk fat emulsion stabilized by caseinate or milk protein isolate with trehalose or lactose as encapsulants. The solvent extractable surface free fat values for the spray dried emulsions are determined, and it appears that the higher oil-to-protein ratios, the higher surface free fat.<br>
<br>
WO 94/01001 describes microencapsulated oil and fat products, wherein a ratio oil-to-caseinat between about 2.25:1 and 2.75:1 is used. The resulting products hold e.g. 25 % fat or oil.<br>
<br>
WO 01/74175 describes encapsulated oil products with a rather high content of oil of up to 60%. The resulting products have a high content of free surface fat and/or a relatively high content of hydrocolloid.<br>
<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide microcapsules having both a high content of fat-soluble active substance and a desirable low content of free surface fat as well as a new process for preparation thereof. <br>
<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide microcapsules with a high content of fat-soluble active substance wherein a corresponding increase in the content of hydrocolloid is avoid.<br>
<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide microcapsules having storage and transportation stability as well as mechanical strength and improved performance during the further processing into tablets, extrudates and the like.<br>
<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a microcapsule comprising at least one fat- soluble active substance selected from provitamins, vitamins and esters thereof, monounsaturated fatty acids, oils comprising polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), carotenoids and benzoquinones embedded in a matrix comprising a hydrocolloid and optionally one or more other matrix components, wherein the content of active substance(s) is from 30 to 60 % of total weight of the microcapsule, and wherein the ratio between said fat- soluble active substance(s) and said hydrocolloid is at least 4:1.<br>
The invention further relates to a process of preparing a microcapsule, which process comprises the steps of<br>
<br>
•	providing a solution or dispersion of said hydrocolloid and said optionally other matrix components,<br>
<br>
•	adding to said solution or dispersion said at least one fat-soluble active substance selected from provitamins, vitamins and esters thereof, monounsaturated fatty acids, oils comprising polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), carotenoids and benzoquinones,<br>
<br>
•	treating the mixture thus obtained to prepare a solution or dispersion of said at least one active substance in said matrix,<br>
<br>
• finely dividing and drying the mixture thus obtained to prepare a mass of particles each containing said at least one active substance embedded in said matrix,<br>
wherein said at least one active substance and said hydrocolloid are used in a ratio of at least 4:1.<br>
<br>
It has surprisingly been found that by using a high oil-to-hydrocolloid ratio in the preparation of the microcapsule, it becomes possible to include a much higher amount of fat-soluble active substance in the final product, and at the same time still maintain a low content of free surface fat. If for instance the product is a PUFA-product, an amount of at least 30 %, 40 % PUFA or even 60 % can be included in the product while simultaneously keeping the content of free surface fat as low as 2 % or even 1 %. In most cases the content of free surface fat is less than 1 %, e.g. less than 0.5 % or less than 0.3 %, 0.2 % or 0.1 % of the total weight of the microcapsule.<br>
By the conventional process used until now attempts to include a higher amount than 25-30 % fat-soluble active substance often lead to an undesirable substantial increase in free surface fat.<br>
By the process of the invention it has also surprisingly become possible to increase the amount of active substance without increasing the amount of hydrocolloid correspondingly. By the conventional process used attempts to include a higher amount of active substance also required the use of higher amounts of hydrocolloid. Thus, the process used for preparing the microcapsules of the invention is cost-efficient.<br>
When the amount of free surface fat decreases the encapsulation efficiency improves, because less free fat on the surface of the microcapsule is subjected to oxidation. Therefore, the microcapsule becomes more<br>
mechanically and chemically stable during storage, transport and further processing into tablets and extrudates or use in food mixes.<br>
<br>
The term "microcapsules" as used herein means particles each comprising a matrix material having embedded therein a plurality of solid or liquid micro particles or solute molecules. Microcapsules usually have a mean diameter of about 5 mm or smaller, e.g. between 1 mm and 0.05 mm, such as between 0.6 and 0.1 mm. They can also have a diameter e.g. between 2 mm and 0.01 mm, such as between 1.5 mm and 0.2 mm.<br>
<br>
The term "dispersion" as used herein covers both an emulsion meaning a mixture comprising liquid particles (e.g. oil droplets) dispersed in a liquid medium, e.g. water/aqueous solution, or a suspension meaning solid particles dispersed in an liquid medium, e.g. water/aqueous solution.<br>
The terms "free surface fat" or "free fat" as used herein means the fat that is readily extractable by organic solvent under specified conditions. This fat is susceptible to oxidization. The free fat is located on the particle surface, as fat globules just below the particle surface or in contact with capillaries or as dissolution fat almost touching already extracted fat globules. The free surface fat as defined in connection with the invention is determined as described in the example.<br>
<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Test method: Determination of free surface fat<br>
Principle: The microcapsules are dispersed in petroleum ether, whereby the amount of fat which is not encapsulated dissolves and is determined by means of weight analysis. Free fat is expressed as the extracted amount of fat in relation to the weighed amount of product.<br>
Method: Weigh 10.00 g (± 0.50 g) product into a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask.<br>
Add 50.0 mL petroleum ether to the flask and shake for a few seconds. Decant the petroleum ether into a counterbalanced 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask through a Whatman No. 4 paper filter, which has been moistened with petroleum ether.<br>
Repeat the procedure with another 50 mL petroleum ether and again with 2 x 10 mL petroleum ether.<br>
<br>
Evaporate the entire amount of petroleum under nitrogen at max. 40°C and place the flask in an incubator at 105°C for one hour and allow to cool in a desiccators.<br>
Weigh the flask in grams (4 decimals).<br>
Calculate the content of free fat (%) in the samples by the following equation:   <br>
m1	=	Weight of flask (g)<br>
m2	=	Weight of flask with free fat (g)<br>
EX sample	=	Weighed sample (g)<br>
