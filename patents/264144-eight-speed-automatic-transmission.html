BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed automatic transmission uses a<br>
combination of planetary gear arrangements, friction clutches and fixed<br>
interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical<br>
arrangement of the planetary gear sets generally are dictated by packaging, cost<br>
and desired speed ratios.<br>
1<br><br>
Docket No. P001112-PTT-DLT<br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved automatic transmission configuration which exhibit<br>
improved performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency,<br>
responsiveness and smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced<br>
size and weight, is essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for a cost-<br>
effective, compact and multi-speed transmission.<br>

input member, an output member, four planetary gear sets and five torque<br>
transmitting devices. Three of the planetary gear sets are simple and one<br>
planetary gear set is compound. Each of the plurality of planetary gear sets has<br>
first, second and third members: a sun gear, a ring gear and a planet carrier<br>
having a plurality of planet gears rotatably disposed thereon. Three of the torque<br>
transmitting devices are clutches and two of the devices are brakes. Eight<br>
embodiments of the transmission having different arrangements of the planetary<br>
gear sets, clutches and brakes are disclosed.<br>
[0007] It is thus an aspect of the present invention to provide an eight<br>
speed automatic transmission.<br>
[0008] It is another aspect of the present invention to provide an<br>
automatic transmission having four planetary gear sets.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0034] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0035] Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, in Figure 1 an eight speed<br>
automatic transmission 10 according to the present invention is illustrated in a<br>
lever diagram. A lever diagram is a schematic representation of the components<br>
of an automatic transmission wherein the three fundamental mechanical<br>
components of a planetary gear set, the sun gear, the planet gear carrier and the<br>
ring gear are represented by nodes. The relative lengths of the bars between the<br>
nodes of a given planetary gear set represent the ratios between the gears of the<br>
gear set. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the nodes of the<br>
various planetary gear sets are illustrated by horizontal lines and torque<br>
transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are represented by nesting or<br>
interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one side of the device is grounded.<br>
Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be<br>
found in SAE Paper 810102 entitled "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in<br>
Transmission Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is fully incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>

Docket No. P001112-PTT-DLT<br>
[0036] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft 12, a first simple<br>
planetary gear set 30, a second compound planetary gear set 40, a third simple<br>
planetary gear set 50, a fourth simple planetary gear set 60 and an output shaft<br>
14. The planetary gear sets 30, 40, 50 and 60 are connected between the input<br>
shaft 12 and the output shaft 14. The first simple planetary gear set 30 includes a<br>
first sun gear 32, a first planet gear carrier 34 that rotatably supports a first<br>
plurality of pinion or planet gears 36 and a first ring gear 38. The second<br>
compound planetary gear set 40 includes a second sun gear 42, a second planet<br>
gear carrier 44 that rotatably supports a second plurality of pairs of pinion or<br>
planet gears 46A and 46B and a second ring gear 48. The third simple planetary<br>
gear set 50 includes a third sun gear 52, a third planet gear carrier 54 that<br>
rotatably supports a third plurality of pinion or planet gears 56 and third a ring<br>

fourth planet gear carrier 64 that rotatably supports a fourth plurality of pinion or<br>
planet gears 66 and a fourth ring gear 68.<br>
[0037] The lever diagram of Figure 1 illustrates the common or shared<br>
mechanical components and architecture of the various arrangements of the<br>
automatic transmission 10 illustrated in Figures 2A through 9A. Thus the<br>
following explanation of the interconnections between the planetary gear sets,<br>
clutches and brakes applies to the family of transmission arrangements disclosed<br>
herein. The input shaft 12 is always coupled to the first planet carrier 34 of the<br>
first planetary gear set 30. The output shaft 14 is always coupled to and driven by<br>
the planet carrier 54 of the third planetary gear set 50. A first shaft, quill or<br>
7<br><br>
Docket No. P001112-PTT-DLT<br>
interconnecting member 72 always couples the third ring gear 58 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 50 to the fourth planet carrier 64 of the fourth planetary gear<br>
set 60. A second shaft, quill or interconnecting member 74 always couples the<br>
first sun gear 32 of the first planetary gear set 30 to the fourth sun gear 62 of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 60. A third shaft, quill or interconnecting member 76<br>
always couples the second sun gear 42 of the second compound planetary gear<br>
set 40 to the third sun gear 52 of the third planetary gear set 50. A fourth shaft,<br>
quill or interconnecting member 78 always couples the first ring gear 38 of the<br>
first planetary gear set 30 to the second planet carrier 44 of the second<br>
compound planetary gear set 40. A fifth shaft, quill or intermediate member 80 is<br>
connected to the second sun gear 42 of the second planetary gear set 40.<br>
[0038] The automatic transmission 10 includes a plurality of torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms or devices including a first clutch 82, a second clutch<br>
84, a third clutch 86, a first brake 92 and a second brake 94. The first clutch 82<br>
is always disposed between the first planet carrier 34 of the first planetary gear<br>
set 30 and the input shaft 12 through fifth shaft, quill or intermediate member 80<br>
to the second sun gear 42 of the second compound planetary gear set 40. The<br>
second clutch 84 is always disposed between the first ring gear 38 of the first<br>
planetary gear set 30 and the second planet carrier 44 of the second compound<br>
planetary gear set 30 which are always coupled by the fourth shaft, quill or<br>
interconnecting member 78 and the second sun gear 42 of the second<br>
compound planetary gear set 40. A third clutch 86 is disposed between the<br>
second ring gear 48 of the second planetary gear set 40 and the third ring gear<br>
8<br><br>
Docket No. P001112-PTT-DLT<br>
58 of the third planetary gear set 50 and the fourth planet carrier 64 of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 60 which are always coupled by the first shaft, quill or<br>
intermediate member 72. The first brake 92 selectively connects the fourth sun<br>
gear 62 of the fourth planetary gear set 60 and the first sun gear 32 of the first<br>
planetary gear set 30 which are always coupled by the second shaft, quill or<br>
intermediate member 74 to ground. The second brake 94 selectively connects<br>
the fourth ring gear 68 of the fourth planetary gear set 60 to ground<br>
[0039] The transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the<br>
input shaft 12 to the output shaft 14 in eight forward speed and torque ratios and<br>
one reverse speed and torque ratio as indicated in the truth table of Figure 1A.<br>
Each of the eight forward speed and torque ratios and the reverse speed and<br>
torque ratios is attained by engagement of a combination of three of the torque<br>
transmitting devices, i.e., the first clutch 82, the second clutch 84, the third clutch<br>
86, the first brake 92 and the second brake 94.<br>
[0040] With reference to the truth table of Figure 1A, it will be<br>
appreciated that reverse gear is attained by activation or engagement of the first<br>
brake 92, the second brake 94 and the third clutch 86. Neutral is attained by<br>
activation or engagement of the first brake 92 and the second brake 94. It should<br>
be noted, however, that although the first brake 92 and the second brake 94 are<br>
engaged, they are not carrying torque.<br>
[0041] First gear is attained by activation or engagement of the first<br>
brake 92, the second brake 94 and the first clutch 82. Second gear is attained by<br>
activation or engagement of first brake 92, the second brake 94 and the second<br>
9<br><br>
Docket No. P001112-PTT-DLT<br>
clutch 84. Third gear is attained by activation or engagement of the second brake<br>
94, the first clutch 82 and the second clutch 84. Fourth gear is attained by<br>
activation or engagement of the second brake 94, the second clutch 84 and the<br>
third clutch 86. Fifth gear is attained by activation or engagement of the second<br>
brake 94, the first clutch 82 and the third clutch 86. Sixth gear is attained by<br>
activation or engagement of the first clutch 82, the second clutch 84 and the third<br>
clutch 86. Seventh gear is attained by activation or engagement of the first brake<br>
92, the first clutch 82 and the third clutch 86. Eighth gear is attained by activation<br>
or engagement of the first brake 92, the second clutch 84 and the third clutch 86.<br>
[0042] Referring now to Figure 2, the automatic transmission 10<br>
includes a housing 20 including or defining a first or front end wall 22, a second<br>
or rear end wall 24, and a third side wall 26. The third side wall 26 interconnects<br>
the first end wall 22 and the second end wall 24 to provide or define a space or<br>
cavity 28 in which the planetary gear sets 30, 40, 50 and 60 and the torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms such as the clutches 82, 84 and 86 and the brakes 92<br>
and 94 are located. Further, the space or cavity 28 has a plurality of Zones A, B,<br>
C, D, E, and F in which the clutches 82, 84 and 86 and the brakes 92 and 94 will<br>
be specifically positioned in accordance with the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0043] As shown in Figure 2 and throughout the several views, Zone A<br>
is defined by the area bounded on the left by the first end wall 22, on the right by<br>
a planetary gear set FF in a first or forward position, on the bottom by a reference<br>
line "L" which is a line that is parallel and preferably coaxial with the input shaft<br>
7<br>
10<br><br>
Docket No. P001112-PTT-DLT<br>
12 and the output shaft 14 and on the top by a reference line "M" which is a line<br>
that extends along the outer diameters of the planetary gear sets and is parallel<br>
to the reference line 'L" Zone B is defined by the area bounded on the left by the<br>
planetary gear set FF, on the right by a planetary gear set SM in a second,<br>
middle position, radially outward by the reference line "M" and radially inward by<br>
the reference line "L" Zone C is defined by the area bounded on the left by the<br>
planetary gear set SM, on the right by a planetary gear set TM in a third, middle<br>
position, radially outward by the reference line "M", and radially inward by the<br>
reference line "L" Zone D is defined by the area bounded on the left by the<br>
planetary gear set TM, on the right by a planetary gear set RF in a rear or fourth<br>
position, radially outward by the reference line "M", and radially inward by the<br>
reference line "L". Zone E is defined by the area bounded: on the left by the<br>
planetary gear set RF, on the right by the second end wall 24, radially outward by<br>
the reference line "M", and radially inward by the reference line "L". Zone F is<br>
defined by the area bounded on the left by the first end wall 22, on the right by<br>
the second end wall 24, radially inward by the reference line "M" and radially<br>
outward by the third side wall 26. Since the positions of the planetary gear sets<br>
30, 40, 50 and 60 will change within the transmission cavity 28 in the different<br>
embodiments, the positions have been generically identified as FF, SM, TM and<br>
RF in Figure 2 to define the Zones A, B, C, D, E and F. However, the Zones<br>
described above will not change and will remain the same throughout the several<br>
views.<br>
