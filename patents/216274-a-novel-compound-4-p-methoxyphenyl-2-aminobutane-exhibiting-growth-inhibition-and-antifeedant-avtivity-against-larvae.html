Background and Prior Art.<br>
The plant Taxus wallichiana. which also known as Himalayan yew is now<br>
considered to be one of the most needed plants for commercial exploitation as it<br>
contains the anticancer drug Taxol. Taxol, a highly oxygenated diterpenoid<br>
molecule and potent anticancer drug was first isolated from the stem bark of Taxus<br>
brevifolia. Thereafter, it has also been isolated from other Taxus plants including<br>
the Himalayan yew Taxus wallichiana.<br>
The applicants have been 'working on different parts of Taxus wallichiana<br>
collected from different parts of India for the isolation of taxol, its important<br>
analogues and precursor 10-deacetyl baccatin HI (DAB). During the course of<br>
investigation, the applicants have isolated a major compound from tfie leaves of<br>
Taxus wallichiana, identified as 4-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-butan-2-ol having structural<br>
formula (2). This compound can be obtained with a yield of 0.2% from the leaves<br>
of Taxus wallichiana. Accordingly, the applicants have developed a simple and<br>
cost effective processing technology for isolation of this compound from the<br>
leaves of Taxis wallichiana. The process of isolation of the compound comprises<br>
the steps of defatting air dried pulverised Taxus leaves with aliphatic hydrocarbon<br>
solvents, extracting the defatted leaves with chlorinated solvents and polar<br>
solvents successively, concentrating the chlorinated solvent soluble fraction to a<br>
residue and treating the residue with aqueous solution of alkali and isolating the<br>
compound from the a l k a l i soluble fraction by acidifying it and extracting u<br>
ethyl acetate. to obtain the compound having structural formula (2).<br>
The compound (2) was not found to be active in bioassay studies for evaluation<br>
of growth inhibition and aiUifeedam activity. The compound of formula (2) was<br>
obtained with high yield (0 2°b). its conversion into other structural analogues<br>
through a series of chemical reactions. In the course of this investigation, the<br>
applicants prepared a new molecule represented by formula ( 1 ) from the<br>
compound represented by formula (2) The compound having structural formula<br>
(1) shows significant activity as a growth inhibitor and antifeedant.<br>
The compound having formula(l) was evaluated as feeding deterrent and growth<br>
inhibitor against 4th instar larvae of Spilarctia Obliqua. This insect attacks more<br>
than twenty cash crops including urd, mong, arhar, mint and coleus etc.<br>
Compound having formula (1) is non hazardous in nature and thus is ecologically<br>
safe and environmentally sound for its use as an agrochemical.<br>
Objects<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide a new molecule, 4-(pmethoxyphenyl)-<br>
2-amino butane, represented by structural formula (I) and<br>
represented by molecular formula CnHpON.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of a<br>
biologically active compound represented by structural formula ( I ) with higher<br>
yields, from a readily available starting material isolated from the plant Taxu.s<br>
waUichiana.<br>
Yel another object of (he invention is to provide an insecticidal composition<br>
comprising an effective amount of the new molecule 4-(p-methoxy phenyl-2-<br>
amino butane and an adjuvant.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides novel molecule 4-(p-methoxyphen\0-<br>
2-amino butane.C|iHi?ON. represented by the structural formula (1) as slumn<br>
herein below.<br>
= 4-(p-methoxyphenyl)-2-amino butane<br>
The compound exhibits growth inhibitory and antifeedant activity. The process for<br>
the isolation of the novel compound comprises the steps of:<br>
a) isolating a phenolic molecule represented by structural formula (2) from the<br>
leaves of Taxus wallichiana by known methods,<br>
b) treating the compound having formula (2) in aqueous mineral acid at 25-<br>
100°C for 2-10 hours to obtain a phenolic halide derivative,<br>
c) converting the phenolic halide derivative into its methyl ether by treating it<br>
with a methylating agent to obtain a methyl ether halide,<br>
d) reacting the methyl ether formed with azide to obtain an azido derivative,<br>
and<br>
e) hydrogenating the azido compound thus formed by catalytic hydrogenation<br>
in the presence of a catalyst in lower aliphatic alcohol to obtain a<br>
compound having structural formula (1 ).<br>
The aqueous mineral acid used in step (b) may be selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid and hydroiodic acid. The<br>
methylating agent used in step (c) may be selected from methyl iodide or dimethyl<br>
sulphate.<br>
The a/.ide, used in step (d) is sodium n/idc or trimcthyl silyi a?.ide.<br>
The catalyst used in the hydrogennlion process is selected from palladium charcoal<br>
and platinum oxide. The lower alcohol used as medium to dissolve the a/ide<br>
derivative in the hydrogenation process may be methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol.<br>
As mentioned earlier, the compound 4-(p-methoxy pheny!)-2-amino butane<br>
exhibits antifeedant and growth inhibiting activity against certain insects,<br>
especially the larvae of Spilarctia Obliqua.<br>
Hence, the compound has potential use as an insecticide, and would have wide<br>
spread applications in insecticidal compositions. Without wishing to be bound by<br>
any theory, the Applicants state that an insecticidal composition comprising an<br>
effective amount of the compound 4-(p-methoxy phenyl)-2-amino butane and an<br>
adjuvant in an amount sufficient to enhance the activity of the composition may<br>
be prepared. In practice, it is found that the novel compound 4-(pmethoxyphenyl)-<br>
2-amino butane per se may also be used to control insects in<br>
fields, though it is recommended that the compound be mixed with augmenting<br>
adjuvants such as distilled water, acetone or such other solvents before use. The<br>
insecticidal compositions may be sprayed or applied in the soil for control of pests.<br>
Further, the said insecticidal composition may be effectively used for the control<br>
of insects/their larvae such as Spilarctia Obliqua. In practice, the compound is<br>
found to be very useful 'in controlling phytopathogenic insects and mites.<br>

The spectral characteristics of the molecule are as follows :<br>
The El mass spectrum of the compound showed its M* at M/Z 179, thus<br>
confirming its molecular formula as CnH]7ON, and other diagnostic fragment<br>
peaks at M/Z 162, 147, 121, and 91 IRA/ max (KB r) 3360, 2940, 1610, 1515, 14501,<br>
1 030 and 850 Cm'1.<br>
The molecule "hals been prepared from a readily available starting material 4-(phydroxyphenyl)-<br>
butan-2-ol having formula (2) isolated from the plant Taxus<br>
wallichiana.<br>
of the Novel molecule for antifeedant activity<br>
The compound having formula ( I ) was evaluated as feeding deterrent and growth<br>
against 4'1' in star larvae of spilarctia obliqua i^'hai hairy caterpillar)<br>
Tim insect attacks more than twenty cash crops like urd. moong. arhar, mint and<br>
coicus etc Several synthetic insecticides like quinalphos. Phosphamidon and<br>
synthetic pyrethroids are commercially used to manage this insect pest. But. the<br>
insect is developing resistance towards some of these insecticides. Therefore, it<br>
has now become imperative to search for new ecologically safe, environmentally<br>
sound and non-toxic chemicals to manage this pest.<br>
With compound having formula (1) insect feeding deterrency and growth<br>
inhibition was tested by diet-mix method. In this method, 4-(p-methoxyphenyl)-2-<br>
aminobutane the compound having formula (1) was dissolved in acetone to make<br>
various concentrations ranging from 1000 to 5000 ppm. Test solution was mixed<br>
in the artificial diet of the insect so that each gram of diet contained 60-300 j^g of<br>
the compound (1). 4th in star larva (newly molted) starved four hours, was<br>
weighed and released on treated artificial diet in thirty replications. In control,<br>
only solvent acetone was mixed and azadirachtin at 1000 ppm concentration was<br>
taken as standard for feeding bioassay. After 24 hours, number of fecal pellets<br>
produced were counted, and the data were analyzed for % feeding deterrency.<br>
Some experiments were continued for next 24 hours and weights of the larva were<br>
taken daily. After 3 days, experiment was discontinued and weight gain or loss<br>
was analyzed for % growth inhibition.<br>
Diflubenzuron at 5 ppm was taken as a standard in case of growth inhibitory<br>
assay. The test result of compound having formula (1) in terms of its feeding<br>
deterrency and growth inhibition as compared to standards azadirachtin and<br>
diflubenzuron are given in table I.<br>
As it appears from the table 1. compound having formula (1) is less active as a<br>
feeding deterrent agent as compared to azadirachtin. However, the new molecule<br>
(1) has several other advantages over azadirachtin which include.<br>
(a) Compound having formula (1) is a very small molecule (molecular weight<br>
179), structurally as compared to azadirachtin which is a large molecule<br>
with many chiral centres, molecular weight 720; therefore, the molecule (1)<br>
can be synthesized easily as compared to azadirachtin, the synthesis of<br>
which would never be commercially viable.<br>
(b) Unlike azadirachtin which is photosensitive i.e., it decomposes on exposure<br>
to sun light, compound having formula (1) is not sensitive to light (both UV<br>
and sunlight). Therefore, compound (1) can be used under field condition<br>
in contrast to azadirachtin which can not be used under field condition till<br>
to date.<br>
In terms of growth inhibitory properties, compound having formula (1J is<br>
less active than the standard compound diflubenzuron. However, many<br>
insects arc developing, resistance to this particular compound and ihcrctore<br>
higher doses are required to k i l l the insects as compared to 5 ppm ;»s<br>
mentioned in table I Ultimately i t s effectiveness w i l l be stopped<br>
Therefore, compound having formula (1) which is structurally different<br>
from diflubenzuron will be useful against diflubenzuron resistant insects<br>
Also, diflubenzuron contains fluonne atoms in its molecule and therefore it<br>
is prone to be carcinogenic and environmentally hardazous on microbial<br>
activation. Due to its different structure as compared to diflubenzuron,<br>
compound having formula (1) will be ecologically non hazardous and<br>
environmentally sound.<br>
From the foregoing, it will be clear that the compounds of the invention<br>
have extremely high controlling effects against various types of<br>
phytopathogenes insects, mites etc and thus are useful as active ingredients<br>
of agricultural and horticultural insecticides, miticides etc.<br>
Advantages<br>
1. The chemicals and reagents that are used to prepare the active compound<br>
are not expensive and thus the process is cost effective and viable for<br>
commercial production.<br>
2. All the steps in the process are straight forward; no extreme reaction<br>
conditions are necessary to be maintained for preparation of the active<br>
compound and thus the process will be commercially viable.<br><br><br><br><br>
