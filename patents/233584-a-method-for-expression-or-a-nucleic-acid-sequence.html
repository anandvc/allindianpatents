				<td>The present invention relates as a method for enpresion of a<br>
nerlate need .  <br>
The present invention relates to clean synthetic vectors, intended notably for use for genetic transformation in the field of plant biotechnology.<br>
In general, the vectors are known in the field of biotechnology and genetic manipulation. The vectors which are currently used most commonly for genetic transformation, and in particular in the field of plant biotechnology, present several disadvantages in their use, however. In actual fact, and notably for plant transgenesis, use has often been made of a vector called pBin!9 (Frisch et al., 1995). The nucleotide sequence of this binary plasmid pBinl9 is entirely known. The problem, however, is that this plasiuid is of large size (11.8 kbp) and that it contains useless elements (more than half of p8in!9) which are intolerable from a regulatory point of view, or even detrimental to good replication. Moreover, the selection cassette of this plasmid is located near the right border of the T-DNA. Thus, when the T-DNA is broken after the selection cassette, it will not be possible to make any selection in order to retain solely the plants possessing the expression cassette of the desired gene.<br>
The expressions used in the description and the claims have the following meaning :<br>
- "vector" means an expression system, for example DNA-coated projectiles, nucleic-acid-based transit vehicles, nucleic acid molecules adapted to deliver nucleic acid, and autonomous self-replicating circular DNA, for example plasmids, cosmids, phagemids, etc. If a micro-organism or a recombinant cell culture is described as host of an "expression vector", this can also include extrachromosomal circular DNA 'such as for example mitochondria! or chloroplast DNA}, DNA which has been integrated into the host chromosome(s), where the vector can be either replicated in a stable manner by the cells during mitosis as an<br>
autonomous   structure,   integrated  into  the  genome   of  the  host,   or htained  in  the  nucleus or cytoplasm of  the host.<br>
usually the vectors used for the genetic transformation exist in the form of plasmids. In this case, the "plasmid" is a molecule of autonomous circular DNA capable of replication in a cell. If a micro-organism or recombinant cell calture is described as the host of. an "expression" plasmid, this comprises both extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules and DNA which has been integrated into the host chromosome's). If the plasmid is maintained by a host cell, the plasmid is either replicated in a stable manner by the cells during mitosis as an autonomous structure, or integrated into the genome of the host;<br>
-	"clean"  means  that  the  vector  comprises  only  sequences<br>
that    are    indispensable    for    its    functionality    and    carries    a<br>
nucleic   acid    sequence   which   comprises    only   elements    that    are<br>
indispensable   for the  expression  of the  host  cell;<br>
-	"nucleic  acid" means  DNA or RNA ;<br>
-	"nucleic    acid   sequence"   means   a   single-    or   double-<br>
stranded   oligomer   or   polymer   of   nucleotide   bases   read   from   the<br>
5'     end    towards     the     3'     end,     and    comprises     self-replicating<br>
plasmids,    genes,   DNA   or   RNA   polymers,    which   may   or   may   not   be<br>
infectious,      and     DNA,      or     RNA,      either     functional      or      nonÂ¬<br>
functional.     In    the    nucleotide    notation    used    in    the    present<br>
application,     unless     specifically    stated,     the    left    end    of    a<br>
single-stranded  nucleotide  sequence  is  the  5'   end;<br>
"derived nucleic acid sequence" means that the sequence derives directly or indirectly from the sequence referred to, for example by substitution, deletion, addition, mutation, fragmentation, and/or synthesis of one or more nucleotides;<br>
"promoter" means a nucleic acid region which is upstream of the translation initiation codon and which is involved in the recognition and binding of RNA polymerase and ether transcription proteins;<br>
-	"plant   promoter"   is   a   promoter   capable   of   initiating<br>
transcription  in plant  cells;<br>
"constitutive promoter" is a promoter capable of expressing nucleic acid sequences operationally bound to said promoter, in all or practically all the tissues of the host organism/ during the whole development of said organism ;<br>
-	"tissue specific promoter" is a promoter capable of<br>
selectively  expressing  nucleic  acid  sequences  operationally<br>
bound to said promoter, in certain specific tissues of the host<br>
organism;<br>
"operationally bound" means the binding of a functional or regulatory element, for example a promoter, to the nucleic acid sequence, or gene, to be expressed which codes for  protein to be produced, in such a way that this element influences the transcription of the bound nucleic acid sequence;<br>
"expression cassette" means nucleotide sequences capable of directing the expression of a nucleic a:id sequence, or of a gene, coding for a polypeptide to be produced in a host organism compatible with such sequences. Such cassettes include at least one promoter and a transcription termination signal, and optionally other factors necessary or useful for the expression ;<br>
-	"heterologous sequence" or "heterologous nucleic acid<br>
sequence" means a sequence originating from a source, or from a<br>
species, foreign to the environment thereof, or if it originates<br>
from the same environment, which has oeen modified relative to<br>
its original form. The modification of the nucleic acid sequence<br>
can take place for example by treatment of the nucleic acid with<br>
a restriction enzyme in order to generate a nucleic acid<br>
fragment which can be operationally bound to a promoter. The<br>
modification can also take place by means of techniques such as<br>

acid  sequence,  called  a  reference  sequence,  preferably  a<br>
sequence identity of at least 50%, more preferably a sequence identity of at least 75%, and more particularly a sequence identity of at least 90% with the reference sequence. The percentage of sequence identity is calculated on the basis of a comparison window of at least 6 r.ucieotide bases. The determination of a comparison window can be carried out using sequence alignment algorithms to determine a homology with a reference sequence, for example the local homology algorithm, the homology alignment algorithm, and the similarity search algorithm, these algorithms existing also in computerized form, known by the names GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA and TFASTA. The percentage of sequence identity is obtained by comparing the reference sequence with the box and/or the nucleic acid sequence;<br>
"situated" means the position on a nucleic acid sequence of an identified element, such as a "box", a restriction site, or a codon having a particular function. The position which is given by a figure refers to the position of the start of the element in the nucleic acid sequence, in the direction of reading of the latter, i.e. in the direction 5'-&gt;3';<br>

be alleviated, anc notably presenting a high replication rate iative to the existing vectors most commonly used. Furthermore, the applicant has suÂ°Ceeded at the same time in producing a range of vectors in such a way as to be able to choose the one which it is convenient to use according to the application envisaged and the environment of its use, and thus in such a way as to be able to better control the rate of expression of a gene to be expressed, coding for a polypeptide to be produced.<br>
In addition, in some of the vectors according to the invention, each of the functional elements or components can be isolated by simple enzymatic digestion.<br>

These results show that the synthetic plasmids are replicated in Escherichia coli, the presence of the origin of replication "ori ColEl" in the right orientation (Ndel site of "ori ColEl" near "ori RK2") allows the yield to be increased by a factor of 5, whereas no effect is shown for the reverse orientation of "ori ColEi", treatment with chloramphenicol contributes an additional factor of 1.6.<br>
11.2. Synthetic binary plasmids.<br>
The synthetic binary plasmids pMRTlliS and pMRTlllS are evaluated relative to the controls pBin!9 and pBIOC4 . The plasmid pBIOC4 differs from pGA492 (An, 1986) by the deletion of virtually all the coding sequence of the pGA492 car gene and by the conversion of the Hindlll site into an EcoRI site. It was obtained by double digestion by SacI and Seal followed by the action of the enzyme T4 DNA poiymerase (New England Biolabs; and ligation of the modified plasmid (20 no) in a reaction medium of 10 Âµl in the presence of 1 Âµl of T4 DNA ligase  10 buffer<br>
16 hours. The bacteria, Escherichia coli strain DH5Î±, which had previously been made competent, were transformed (Hanahan, 1983). The plasmid DNA of the clones obtained, selected on tetracycline at 12 mg/1, was extracted by the alkaline lysis method (Birnboim and Doly, 1979) and analysed by enzymatic digestions. The Hindlll site of the plasmid DNA of the clone selected were then modified into an EcoRI site with the aid of a phosphorylated Hindlll-EÂ°CRI adaptor (Stratagene). To do this, 500 ng of plasmid DNA of the clone selected were digested by Hindlll, depnosphoryiated by the enzyme calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and coprecipitated in the presence of 1500 ng of Hindlll-EcoRI adaptor DNA, 0.1 volume of 3M sodium acetate, pH 4.8, and 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol at -80Â°C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 1200C g for 30 min., the precipitated DNA was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, recovered in 8 Âµl of H2O, held at 65Â°C for 10 min., then ligated as described earlier. After inactivation of the T4 DNA ligase at 65Â°C for 10 min., the ligation reaction mixture was digested by EcoRI, purified by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, electroeluted, precipitated with absolute ethanol, centrifuged at 12000 g for 30 min., washed with 70% ethanol, dried, then<br>
iigatsd and introduced into Escherichia Â°Cli strain DH5Î±, and treated as described earlier.<br>
Primary cultures of the recombinant bacteria possessing the plasmids mentioned above were prepared from 500 ml of each of the respective "glycerol-stocks" in 10 ml of LB medium supplemented with kanamycin at 50 mg/1, except for pBI~&gt;C4, which was selected on tetracycline at 12 mg/1, at 37Â°c for 16 hours. After that, 250 ml of each of the primary cultures were cultured in 100 ml of LB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic at 37Â°C for 23 hours. The cultures were then centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min. The plasmid DNAs were extracted with the aid of the "QIAFilter Plasmid Midi kit" (QIAGEN) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendationr and quantitatively determined<br>
with the spectropnotometer. The quantities of plasmids obtained determined as  94.2 mg,  113 mg,  37.2 mg and 45.6 mg respectively for pMRTlllS, pMRT1119, pBin!9 and pBIOC4.<br>
These results show that the synthetic binary plasmids are replicated in Escherichia coli, and that the yield of pMRT1119 is increased by the factors 3 and 2.5 respectively, relative to the pBin!9 and pB10C4 controls.<br>
Furthermore, these synthetic plasmids are replicated in Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404.<br>
12. Evaluation of the synthetic plasmids by transgenesis<br>
12.1. Transformation of tobacco<br>
12.1.1. Stable transformation of tobacco<br>
The transformation of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. var. PBD6) was carried out by infecting foliar discs isolated from 6-week-old tobacco seedlings in vitro with recombinant agrobacteria in accordance with the method described by Horsch et al. (1985).<br>
All the in vitro cultures are prepared in a controlled environment chamber in which the light intensity is 200 uE.m-2.s-l, the photoperiod 16 hours light/8 hours darkness, and the temperature 25Â°C.<br>
Except for the initial coculture stage, the regeneration, development and rooting stages were performed on different selective media supplemented with a bacteriostat, namely augmentin at 400 mg/1, and a selective agent, namely kanamycin at 200 or 100 mg/1.<br>
The different stages and the media used are as follows:<br>
After primary culture of the agrobacteria in 5 ml of 2YT medium (bacto-tryptone 10 g/1, yeast extract 5 g/1, NaCl 5 g/1, pH 7.2) supplemented with CaCl2, with a final concentration of 6 mM, and with appropriate antibiotics, at 28Â°C for 48 hours, a culture is performed in 10 ml of 2YT medium, supplemented with CaCl2 and antibiotics, at 28Â°C for a period of one night. The culture is then centrif uged at 3000 g for 10 min. and the bacteria are resuspended in 10 ml of liquid -MS30 (M0404 at<br>
4 .A g/i, marketed by SIGMA, supplemented with sucrose, 30 g/i,<br>
The coculture is performed by placing the foliar explants cut from the leaves of the seedlings in vitro, about 1 cm2, in contact with the suspension of agrobacteria, diluted 1/10, in liquid MS30 for 20 min. The explants so treated are then rapidly dried on filter paper ar.d placed or. a solid coculture medium (CM) (MS30, Benzyl Amino Purine (BAF) 1 mg/1, Indole-3 Acetic Acid (ANA) at- 0.1 ng/1, agar at 8 g/1) for 48 hours in the controlled environment chamber.<br>
The treated explants are then placed on a solid regeneration medium (solid CM, augmentin 400 at mg/1, kanamycin at 200 mg/1) . The expiants are pricked out on the same medium after 2 weeks.<br>
After 2 weeks the shoots are pricked out on a solid development medium (M0404 at 4.4 g/i, marketed by SIGMA, supplemented with sucrose 20 g/1, pK 5.7 (liquid MS20), augmentin at 400 mg/1, kanamycin at 100 mg/1, agar at 8 g/1).<br>
After 2 weeks, the transformed seedlings are pricked out on a solid rooting medium identical to the development medium. Rooting takes 2 to 3 weeks, after which the seedlings are removed to the growth chamber in Giffy pots for 10 days (photoperiod 16 hours light/8 hours darkness, 23Â°C, 70% relative humidity), then placed in the greenhouse.<br>
12.1.2. Evaluation of the synthetic plasmids used in transformation of tobacco<br>
The recombinant agrobacteria (Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404) containing the synthetic binary plasmid pMRTlllS or the control binary plasmid pBin19 were used to transform the tobacco Nicotiana tabacum L. var. PBD6.<br>
The results showed thar the number and growth of the<br>
seedlings which develop in the presence of the selective agent<br>
(kanamycin}  are similar for the two binary plasmids tested.<br>
These observations indicate that the synthetic binary plasmid is<br>
perfectly functional in transgenesis of tobacco.<br>
12.2. Transformation of maize<br>
12.2.1.	Genetic transformation of maize calli<br>
The genetic transformation of maize, whatever method is employed (electropcration, Agrobacterium, microfibres, particle gun) , generally requires the use of cells that are ur.differentiated in rapid divisions, having retained the ability to regenerate whole plants. Cells of this type make up the friable embryogenic callus (called Type II) of maize.<br>
These calli were obtained from immature embryos of genotype HI, II or (A188 x B73) in accordance with the method and on the media described by Armstrong (Maize handbook, 1994, Freeling M and Walbot V (eds), pp 665-671). The calli so obtained were multiplied and maintained by suÂ°Cessive subcultures every 2 weeks on the starting medium.<br>
Seedlings were regenerated from these calli by modifying the hormonal and osmotic equilibrium of the cells in accordance with the method described by Vain et al. (1989). These plants were then hardened off in the greenhouse, where they, can be crossed or selfed.<br>
12.2.2.	Genetic  transformation  of  maize  with  the<br>
particle gun<br>
The production and regeneration of the cell lines needed for transformation are described in 12.2.1.<br>
The procedure which uses the particle gun for genetic transformation is described by Finer et al. (1992). The target cell3 are callus fragments with a surface area of 10 to 20 mm2. These fragments were placed on a starting medium supplemented with 0.2 M mannitol and 0.2 M scrbitol for 4 hours before bombardment.<br>
The tungsten particles (M10) and transformation plasmids were coprecipitated in accordance with the protocol described by-Klein (1987). The particles thus coated were projected towards the target cells by means of the particle gun in accordance with trie protocol of Finer et al. (1992).<br>
The bombarded calli were placed in darkness at 27Â°C. After 24 hours, the first subculturing took place, followed by subculturing every 2 weeks for 3 months on a starting medium to<br>
the appropriate selective agent to select only the transformed calli had been added. These calli were then grown in the presence of the selective agent in order to regenerate transformed seedlings, as described in 12.2.1. The seedlings obtained were hardened off and transferred to the greenhouse, where they can be crossed or selfed.<br>
12.2.3. Genetic transformation of maize by Agrobacterium tumefaciens<br>
The technique used is described by Ishida et al. (1996). Immature embryos 1.0 to 1.2 mm in length (9 to 14 days after pollination) were washed in the LS-inf medium, then immersed in the suspension of agrobacteria, prepared as described by Ishida et al. (1S96), vortexed for 30 sec., and incubated at ambient temperature for 5 min. The immature embryos so treated were cultured on LS-AS medium in darkness at 25Â°C for 3 days, then transferred to LSD 1.5 medium supplemented with phosphinothricin at 5 mg/1 and cefotaxime at 250 mg/1, in darkness at 25Â°C for 2 weeks, and finally placed on LSD 1.5 medium supplemented with phosphinothricin at 10 mg/1 and cefotaxime at 250 mg/1, in darkness at 25Â°C for 3 weeks. The Type I calli thus generated were isolated, fragmented and transferred to LSD 1.5 medium supplemented with phosphinothricin at 10 mg/1 and cefotaxime at 250 mg/1, in darkness at 25Â°C for 3 weeks. The Type I calli which proliferated were then isolated and placed on LSZ medium supplemented with phosphinothricin at 5 mg/1 and cefotaxime at 250 mg/1, subjected to a photoperiod of 16 hours light/8 hours darKness at 25Â°C for 2 to 3 weeks. The regenerated seedlings were then transferred to 2 LSF medium subjected to a photoperiod of 16 hours light/8 hours darkness at 25Â°C for 1 to 2 weeks, and then transferred to the growth chamber and greenhouse.<br>
13. Influence of the vector backbone on gene expression Stably transformed tobacco plants were obtained for the synthetic binary plasmids pMRT!204 bearing the wild-type nptll gene (16 plants) and pMRT1206 bearing the mutated nptll gene (12 plants), and also for the control vector pBI121 sold by Clontech which corresponds to plasmid pBIN19 bearing the wild-type nptll<br>
gene and containing the expression cassette "P35S - uidA - poiyA  (11 plants) .<br>
The influence of the synthetic vector backbone and that of the control was evaluated by ELISA analysis of protein extracts using the NPTII ELISA kit sold by 5 Prime -&gt; 3 Prime. The analysis enabled a quantification of the NPTII protein produced fin micrograms, pg) with respect to tne amount of soluble extracted protein(in milligrams, mg).<br>
The proteins were extracted in "Tris-HCl 25 mM pH7.8 ; Fhenylmethylsulfonylfiuoride 1 mM" buffer from tobacco leaves ground in liquid nitrogen. After centrifugation for 10 minutes at 10000 g and 4Â°C, the extracted soluble proteins contained in the supernatant were measured according to Bradford's method (A rapid and sensitive method for the detection of microgram quantities of proteins utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding. Anal. Biochem. (1976)72, 248-254).<br>
The antibodies used for ELISA quantification were rabbit polyclonal antibodies specifically recognizing the coating NPTII protein and biotinylated anti-KFTII anitbodies for the detection of the NPTII protein.<br>
The results of the analysis shown in Figure 23 indicate that :<br>
â¢	for the wild type nptll gene cassette and different plasmid<br>
backbones, the quantities of NPTII obtained with the synthetic<br>
binary plasmid pMRT1204 are greater by a factor of 6.7 than<br>
those obtained with the original pBIN19 binary plasmid, which<br>
demonstrates the efficiency of the synthetic vector.<br>
	for an  identical plasmid backbone,  i.e.  synthetic binary<br>
plasmids pMRT1204  and DMRT1206,  but with different nptll<br>
genes, i.e. Wild type and mutated nptll, the quantities of<br>
NPTII  obtained  in  the wild type gene differ from those<br>
obtained for the mutated nptll gene by a factor 1.2.<br>

10 Âµg of plasmid pMRT1335 was digested with Agel and Kpnl. The thus digested vector fragment was isolated by electropnoresis on 0.6% agarcse gel, purified using a "Concert Rapid PCR Purification System" kit and taken up in 50 Âµl water.<br>
The DNA insert fragment corresponding to the expression casssette "L5-gus-poiyA35S" (3.4 kbp) was obtained by digestion with Xhol of 10 Âµg plasmid pMRT1336, purified using a "Concert Rapid PCR Purification System" kit, taken up in 50 Âµl water, subjecting this to the action of 20 units Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 12 Âµl 500 mM pH7.5 Tris-HCl 500 mM MgC12, 6 Âµl 1M dithiothreitol, 6 Âµl each of 10 mM dNTP in a reaction volume of 120 Âµl at 37Â°C for 30 minutes, then, purified using a "Concert Rapid PCR Purification System" kit, and taken up in 50 Âµl water, and finally digested with Kpnl. The thus prepared DNA insert fragment was isolated by electrophoresis on a 0?8% agarose gel in TEB buffer, purified using a "Concert Rapid PCR Purification System" kit, taken up in 50 Âµl water, digested with Agel, purified using a kit as above and take nup again in 50 Âµl water.<br>
The PCR ligation reaction was carried out with 100 ng of<br>
vector fragment derived fron. pMRT1325 and 100 ng of DNA insert agment prepared as described above in reaction mixture of 20 Âµl in the presence of 2 Âµl T4 lOx DNA ligase buffer (Epicentre Technologies), 2 Âµl 2.5 mM ATP and 4 untis T4 DNA ligase (Epicentre Technologies). The reaction is comprised of 180 cycles eaca including 2 steps, the first at 10Â°C for 30 seconds and the second at 30Â°C for 30 seconds in a "GeneAmp PCR System 9700" thermocycler.<br>
Previously prepared competent. Escherichia coli DH5Î± bacteria, were transformed (Hanahan, 1983). The plamsid DNA of the obtained clones, selected on LB media supplemented with kanamycin (50 mg/1), was extracted according to the alakline lysis method and verified by enzymatic digestion and sequencing. The resulting plasmid was designated pMRT1342 (Figure 29). Its complete sequence is given in the sequence listing under SEQ.ID57. 20. Production of recombinant agrobacterie<br>
The binary plamsids were transferred into the Ag.obacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 strain according to the technique described by Holsters et al. [Holsters M., Dewaele D., Depicker A., Messenf E., Van Montagu M. et Schell J. (1978). Trahsfection and transformation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Mel. Gen. Genet. 136, 181-187.]. The plasmid DNA of the obtained clones, selected on LB media supplemented with rifampicine (50 mg/1), was extracted according to the alkaline lysis method, modified by the addition of lysozyme (25 mg/mi) in the cell lesuspension buffer. The plasmid DNA obtained was analysed by enzymatic digestion. The agrobacteria clones obtained were used for plant genetic transformation.<br>
