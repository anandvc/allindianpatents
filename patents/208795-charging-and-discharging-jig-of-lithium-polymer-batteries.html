				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a charging and discharging jig for lithium polymer batteries, and more particularly to a charging and discharging jig for lithium polymer batteries for charging and discharging electricity in/from the lithium polymer battery by installing a plurality of insulators, voltage-measuring polar plates and current-passing polar plates on an upper surface of upper and lower moving stands, which move to opposite directions each other, and by using a means of pressing the insulators, the voltage-measuring polar plates and the current-passing polar plates at both sides of the lithium polymer battery, wherein, though more than one lithium polymer battery is not assembled for charging and discharging, other lithium polymer batteries may charge and discharge electricity, wherein any interference due to a wire can be prevented during movement of the upper and lower moving stands because the voltage-measuring and current-passing polar plates are directly contacted with a circuit board without any wire, so that it is simply assembled and dissembled and repaired, wherein the voltage-measuring polar plates and the current-passing polar plates are arranged in zigzags to prevent interference between them,  so<br>

BACKGROUND ART<br>
A conventional charging and discharging device is configured to have an upper moving stand combined to a cylinder at one side, a lower moving stand combined to a cylinder to the other side to move to an opposite direction to the upper moving stand, and a plurality of polar plates combined above the upper and lower moving stands moving to opposite directions.<br>
That is, in such a configuration, if the cylinders at one and the other side are activated to push the upper and lower moving stands to a center, the polar plates combined to the upper and lower moving stands press the electrode of the lithium polymer battery at both sides so as to then charge or discharge electricity to/from the lithium polymer battery.<br>
However, to charge or discharge electricity in such a way, there is required a preparatory operation of inserting a plurality of lithium polymer batteries to a holder.<br>
At this time, if the lithium polymer batteries are combined with the charging and discharging device with any of the lithium polymer batteries being not assembled to the holder, there is caused a problem that the polar plates combined at the upper and lower moving stands are contacted each other so that<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
all of the batteries are recognized to exist.<br>
In addition, because such a conventional charging and discharging device has wires for supplying power to each polar plate combined to the upper and lower moving stands as much as the number of the polar plates, it may spoils the beauty and be frequently broken down due to interference during movement of the upper and lower moving stands.<br>
Moreover, it is very inconvenient and takes long time to change inner parts and assemble or disassemble the device because of entangled wires like a web and the structural complex of the device.<br>
Particularly, because arranged in several lines in serial, the polar plates combined to the upper and lower moving stands may cause interference each other, so deteriorating efficiency of charging and discharging as well as spatial utilization.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is designed to overcome the above problems of the prior art, and an object of the invention is to provide a charging and discharging jig of lithium polymer batteries in which polar plates are installed without wire so that it enables to charge and discharge electricity to/from other lithium  polymer batteries  though  at  least  one  lithium  polymer battery  is  not<br>
-3-<br><br>
assembled, so preventing interference due to the wire during movement of the upper and lower moving stands, simplifying the repairing work owing to easy assembling and disassembling, improving charging and discharging efficiency by preventing the interference among the polar plates, and increasing the spatial utilization.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a charging and discharging jig for lithium polymer batteries comprising a plurality of insulators combined to an upper moving stand, which reciprocates by operation of a cylinder fixed to support member at one side;<br>
a plurality of voltage-measuring polar plates and current-passing polar plates combined to a lower moving stand, which reciprocates by operation of a cylinder fixed to a support member at the other side, in order to charge or discharge electricity by pressing an electrode of the lithium polymer battery with moving to a direction opposite to movement of the insulators; and<br>
means for fixing the voltage-measuring polar plates and the current-passing polar plates to the lower moving stand.<br>

Also, the housing 202 is made of insulating materials.<br>
On the other hand, a third embodiment of the present invention is described in detail with reference to the accompanying FIGs. 19 to 24.<br>
A charging and discharging jig for lithium polymer batteries according to the third embodiment of the present invention includes a support 121 for combining a plurality of curved voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and current-passing polar plates 128, a support member 311 formed independent of the  support   121,  and  means  for  combining  the  support  member  311   to  the<br>
- 11 -<br><br>
support 121.<br>
In this embodiment, the support combining means includes a plurality of pressing protrusions 313 protruded below both side walls 312 of the support member 311, and a plurality of pressing holes 302 formed on the support 121 so that the pressing protrusions 313 are pressed therein.<br>
And, the support member 311 includes a connecting wall 315 for connecting upper portions of both side walls 312 so that a space 314 is formed between both side walls 312, and a plurality of openings 316 formed at an upper side of the connecting wall 315 so that the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 are combined to, and exposed through, the upper side of the connecting wall 315.<br>
In addition, the charging and discharging jig for lithium polymer batteries of this embodiment may include a blocking wall 317 for blocking upper portions of the openings 316.<br>
The charging and discharging jig for lithium polymer batteries of the third embodiment may also include a blocking plate 318 integrally formed with an upper rear side of both side walls 312 to block upper portions of the openings 316.<br>
Now, operations of the charging and discharging jig for lithium polymer batteries   according   to   the   first   embodiment   of   the   present   invention   are<br>
- 12 -<br><br>
described.<br>
First, after a plurality of the lithium polymer batteries 151 for charging and discharging are clamped to the holder, the lithium polymer batteries 151 descends down to be positioned between a plurality of the insulators 107 combined to the upper moving stand 106 and a plurality of the voltage-measuring and current-passing polar plates 125, 128 combined to the lower moving stand 116, as shown in FIGs. 3 and 5.<br>
And, if pushing a start button of the charging and discharging device of the present invention, the cylinders 101, 111 combined to the support members<br>
102,	112 at one and the other sides are activated to move connecting members<br>
103,	113 to a center.<br>
Moving rods 105, 115 combined to the connecting members 103, 113 slide in a fixed member 104 to push the upper and lower moving stands 106, 116 to opposite directions.<br>
Therefore, the electrode 152 of the lithium polymer battery 151 is interposed between the insulators 107 and the voltage-measuring and current-passing polar plates 125, 128 combined to the upper and lower moving stands 106, 116, as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
If the electrode 152 of the lithium polymer battery 151 is interposed, the current supplied to the circuit board 118 may be charged to the electrode 152 of<br>
- 13 -<br><br>
the lithium polymer battery through the lower surface 130 and the upper surface 129 formed on a plurality of the current-passing polar plates 128, or discharged in a reverse order.<br>
In addition, a plurality of the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 play a role of measuring a voltage of electricity flowing through the lower surface 127 to the upper surface 126.<br>
And, if the charging or discharging of the lithium polymer battery 151 is completed, the cylinder 101, 111 are reverse-activated to return to an original position and wait for a next process, as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
On the other hand, a plurality of the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and a plurality of the current-passing polar plates 128 maintain to be inserted into the insert grooves 122 formed at both sides of the support member 121 as shown in FIGs. 6 and 7, and if the charging or discharging is progressed with at least one lithium polymer battery 151 not being inserted to the holder, the current cannot pass therethrough because the voltage-measuring and current-passing polar plates  125,  128 are directly contacted with the insulators<br>
107.<br>
Therefore, it may solve the conventional problem of recognizing that there exists the battery in connection with an inner charging and discharging circuit though not having the battery.<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
In addition, because a plurality of the voltage-measuring and current-passing polar plates 125, 128 are supplied with the circuit board 118 in direct contact, there is no need for a wire, and because of charging or discharging electricity in contact with the circuit board 118 without a wire, the interference due to the wire during movement of the upper and lower moving stands 106, 116 can be eliminated, and its repair can be more simplified owing to each assembling and disassembling.<br>
And, by providing the insulating plate 117 between the circuit board 118 and the lower moving stand 116, the circuit board 118 is insulated from the lower moving stand 116, so preventing the current from flowing to the lower moving stand 116.<br>
In addition, owing to the bending portions 141, 142 formed on the lower surface of the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the lower surface 130 of the current-passing polar plates 128, as shown in FIG. 8, the polar plates 125, 128 are more securely pressed to the circuit board 118 so that the lower surfaces 127, 130 are not shorted.<br>
And, a plurality of the positioning protrusions 124 formed to both bottom sides of the support 121 is inserted into the guide holes 134 formed to the circuit board 118 and the insulating plate 117, as shown in FIG. 9, so that the support 121 may be combined to a correct position on the circuit board 118.<br>
- 15 -<br><br>
In addition, to the upper surface 126 of the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the upper surface 129 of the current-passing polar plates 128, the straight opening 143 shown in FIG. 10 or the inclined opening 144 or the tiered opening 145 as shown in FIGs. 11 and 12 are formed so that the upper surface 126, 129 of the voltage-measuring and current-passing polar plates 125, 128 contacted with the electrodes 152 of the lithium polymer batteries 151 may elastically press the electrodes.<br>
Therefore, the charging and discharging can be secured performed by reliable contact points.<br>
On the other hand, the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 are installed on the lower moving stand 116 in zigzags, as shown in FIG. 1, so as to prevent interference between the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 and improve charging and discharging efficiency and spatial utilization.<br>
However, two of the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 are configured to be curved rectangular in the first embodiment, and the rectangular curved portions are bent through the plating work when the two voltage-measuring and current-passing polar plates 125, 128, but the plating work cannot bend a plurality of the voltage-measuring and current-passing polar plates 125, 128 identically.<br>
- 16 -<br><br>
Therefore, the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 completed by the plating work may have an error, which causes great deviation in the contacting pressure when contacting with the electrodes 152 of the lithium polymer batteries 151.<br>
That is, when operating the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 to contact with the electrodes 152 of the lithium polymer batteries 151 at the same time, some of them are contacted ahead, while others are contacted later.<br>
The ones contacted ahead are contacted with higher pressure as much, while the others contacted later are contacted with lower pressure as much.<br>
Therefore, there is a problem of inferior contact because electric resistances are not regular due to the difference of contact time as above.<br>
And, though it is guessed that such a problem would be solved by uniformly plating the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128, to execute plating the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 uniformly is nearly impossible in the current<br>
technological level.<br>
Therefore, such a technique has a problem that it has weak reliability owing to the inferior contact in aspect of electric contact.<br>
The second embodiment of the present invention solves such a problem.<br>
- 17 -<br><br>
That is, in the present invention, the first state of the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128, not combined in the housing 202, is considerably curved left, as shown in FIG. 14 as an imaginary line.<br>
And, if inserting the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 into the housing 202, they maintain the state spread right, as shown in FIG. 14 as a real line.<br>
That is, if the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 are inserted into the housing 202, the elastic unit 215 shows elasticity so as to continuously exert force to return toward the imaginary line, which is its origin position.<br>
However, because the upper hooks 214 formed to the contact pins 213 above the elastic unit 215 are in contact with an upper portion of the through hole 203 of the housing 214, the polar plates 125, 128 cannot return to their original position, but protrudes the contact pins 213 through the through holes 203 of the housing 202.<br>
Therefore, if the support 121 moves together with the insulators 107 so that the electrodes 152 of the lithium polymer batteries 151 contacts with the contact pins 213 of the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128, as shown in FIG.  15, the contact pins 213 and<br>
- 18 -<br><br>
the upper hooks 214 slightly moves in the housing 202.<br>
If the contact pins 213 move backward in contact with the electrode 152 of the lithium polymer battery 151, the elastic unit 215 also moves right to give stronger elastic force to the contact pins 213, so securely pressing the electrode 152 and therefore ensuring more stable charging and discharging.<br>
Particularly, after combining the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 to the housing 202, the contact pins 213 have very small protruding deviation.<br>
And, minute deviations, which may be generated in the above state, can be easily solved by matching with the manufacturing deviations during manufacturing the housing 202.<br>
That is, owing that the housing 202 is an inject-molded material, the deviation can be minimized, and the reason is that the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 are curved right to exert sufficient force, and though the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 are shaped with deviation when the force is not exerted, the deviation is decreased when the force is exerted in advance.<br>
Therefore, because the contact pins 213 of the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 are contacted with the electrodes 152 of the lithium polymer batteries 151 with a regular pressure, the<br>
- 19 -<br><br>
contact inferiority can be minimized owing to the regular electric resistance at the contact portions.<br>
On the other hand, in the second embodiment, the elasticity of the elastic unit 215 is regulated by the side hooks 216 formed at both upper sides of the elastic unit 215.<br>
That is, the side hooks 216 are formed at both upper sides of the elastic unit 215 as shown in FIG. 18, and the side hooks 216 are contacted with both sides of the through holes 203 of the housing 202 to regulate elasticity.<br>
Therefore, because the side hooks 216 are formed at both sides of the elastic unit 215, it is possible to lower a height of the housing 202, which would be effectively applied to the case that the electrode 152 of the lithium polymer battery 151 has short length.<br>
And, the elastic unit 215 of the present invention has a curved shape, so utilizing the elasticity effectively and minimizing pressure and vertical movement of the contact pins 213.<br>
That is, in some cases, the contact pins 213 may be elongated or lifted when being pressed, so thereby pushing the electrode 152 of the lithium polymer battery 151 upward.<br>
Therefore, to prevent the contact pins 213 from ascending when pressed, a portion fixed by the support 121 is positioned on a perpendicular line to the<br>
- 20 -<br><br>
connect pins 213 if possible, and the elastic unit 215 has a curved shape, so minimizing the phenomenon that the connect pins 213 is lifted up.<br>
And,  the  housing  202   is   made  of insulating  materials   so   as   to   be insulated from the connect pins 213.<br>
Therefore, the second embodiment of the present invention has advantages of preventing the contact inferiority during the charging and discharging of the lithium polymer battery 151 and improving the reliability, so giving effects more than expectation.<br>
However, the second embodiment also has some problems. That is, in the charging and discharging jig having such a superior configuration, because front and rear surfaces of the housing 202 are blocked with only the through holes 203 being perforated so that the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 are exposed, it is very difficult to assemble the curved voltage-measuring and current-passing polar plates 125, 128, which results in problems of low work efficiency and therefore<br>
deteriorated productivity.<br>
In addition, the elastic unit 215 should give desired elasticity after combining the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 to the through holes 203 of the housing 202, but because the voltage-measuring polar plates  125 and the current-passing polar plates  128 in<br>
- 21 -<br><br>
this embodiment are assembled with compulsory bending, the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 do not show desired elasticity after assembling, so causing contact inferiority.<br>
The third embodiment of the present invention is proposed to overcome such problems.<br>
That is, the support 121 in the third embodiment is combined with the curved voltage-measuring and current-passing polar plates 125, 128 as shown in FIGs. 19 and 20.<br>
And, the support member 311   is combined to the support  121  by  a<br>
combining means.<br>
That is, the pressing protrusions 313 formed at a front of the support member 311 are inserted into the pressing holes 302 formed at a front of the support 121 in advance, and at this time with inserting the support member 311 in a slightly inclined state as shown in FIG. 20 as an imaginary line, the pressing protrusions 313 formed at a rear of the support member 311 are inserted by pressure into the pressing holes 302 formed at a rear of the support 212, as shown in FIG. 20 as a real line.<br>
Therefore, by combining the support member 311 to the support 121 in a manner of inclining and then erecting the support member 311, the connecting wall 315 connecting the both side walls 312 of the support member 311  are<br>
- 22 -<br><br>
combined without contact with the voltage-measuring polar plates   125 and the current-passing polar plates 128.<br>
And, after combining the support member 311 to the support 121, upper ends of the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 are naturally exposed through the openings 316 formed on the connecting wall 315 of the support member 311 so that the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128 may maintain their initial elasticity.<br>
Therefore, it may prevent the contact inferiority caused by the difference of elasticity exerted by the voltage-measuring polar plates 125 and the current-passing polar plates 128, and very easily combine the support 121 to the support member 311 with a very securely assembled structure.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in FIGs. 21 and 22, the connecting wall 315, which may be weakened, is reinforced by blocking the upper portion of the opening 316 with the blocking wall 317.<br>
In addition, as shown in FIGs. 23 and 24, the jig may include the blocking plate 318 formed to integrally connect an upper side of the opening 316 and an upper rear of both side walls 312 so as to reinforce the connecting wall 315, which may be weakened.<br>

And, in the third embodiment, the support combined with a plurality of the curved voltage-measuring and current-passing polar plates and the support member having the openings to expose the upper end of the voltage-measuring and current-passing polar plates are separately manufactured, then combined by a combining means to improve assembling of the curved voltage-measuring and current-passing polar plates, thereby giving the useful effects of increasing productivity owing to improvement of the work efficiency and preventing the contact inferiority by always maintaining the original elasticity after assembling the voltage-measuring polar plates and the current-passing polar plates.<br>
