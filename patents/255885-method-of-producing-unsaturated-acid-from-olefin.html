Description<br>
METHOD OF PRODUCING UNSATURATED ACID FROM<br>
OLEFIN<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a process of producing unsaturated acids from<br>
olefins via fixed bed partial oxidation in a shell-and-tube heat exchanger type reactor.<br>
Also, the present invention relates to a fixed bed shell-and-tube heat exchanger-type<br>
reactor used for the above process.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	A process of producing unsaturated acids from vapor phase C3 ~ C4 olefins by<br>
using a catalyst is a typical process of catalytic vapor phase oxidation.<br>
[3]	Particular examples of such catalytic vapor phase oxidation include a process of<br>
producing acrolein and/or acrylic acid by the oxidation of propylene or propane, a<br>
process of producing methacrolein and/or methacrylic acid by the oxidation of<br>
isobutylene, t-butyl alcohol or methyl-t-butyl ether, a process of producing phthalic<br>
anhydride by the oxidation of naphthalene or orthoxylene, and a process of producing<br>
maleic anhydride by the partial oxidation of benzene, butylene or butadiene.<br>
[4]	 Generally, catalytic vapor phase oxidation is carried out by charging one or more<br>
kinds of granular catalysts into a reactor tube, supplying feed gas into a reactor through<br>
a reaction tube, and contacting the feed gas with the catalyst in the reactor tube.<br>
Reaction heat generated during the reaction is removed by heat exchange with a heat<br>
transfer medium, whose temperature is maintained at a predetermined temperature.<br>
The heat transfer medium for such heat exchange is provided on the outer surface of<br>
the reaction tube so as to perform heat transfer. The reaction mixture containing a<br>
desired product is collected and recovered through a duct, and then sent to a purification<br>
step. Since the catalytic vapor phase oxidation is a highly exothermic<br>
reaction, it is very important to control the reaction temperature in a certain range and<br>
to reduce the size of the temperature peaks at hot spots generated in reaction zones. It<br>
is also important to accomplish heat dispersion at a point to be subjected to heat accumulation<br>
due to the structure of the reactor or that of the catalyst layer.<br>
[5]	The catalysts that may be used to perform partial oxidation of olefins include<br>
composite oxides containing molybdenum and bismuth, molybdenum and vanadium,<br>
or mixtures thereof.<br>
[6]	Generally, (meth)acrylic acid, a final product, is produced from propylene,<br>
propane, isobutylene, t-butyl alcohol or methyl-t-butyl ether (referred to as 'propylene<br>
or the like', hereinafter) by a two-step process of vapor phase catalytic partial<br><br>
2<br>
WO 2006/098601	PCT/KR2006/000979<br>
oxidation. More particularly, in the first step, propylene or the like is oxidized by<br>
oxygen, inert gas for dilution, steam and a certain amount of a catalyst, so as to<br>
produce (meth)acrolein as a main product. Then, in the second step, the (meth)acrolein<br>
is oxidized by oxygen, inert gas for dilution, steam and a certain amount of a catalyst,<br>
so as to produce (meth)acrylic acid. The catalyst used in the first step is a Mo-Bi-based<br>
oxidation catalyst, which oxidizes propylene or the like to produce (meth)acrolein as a<br>
main product. Also, some acrolein is continuously oxidized on the same catalyst to<br>
partially produce (meth)acrylic acid. The catalyst used in the second step is a MoV-based<br>
oxidation catalyst, which mainly oxidizes (meth)acrolein in the mixed gas<br>
containing the (meth)acrolein produced from the first step to produce (meth)acrylic<br>
acid as a main product.<br>
[7]	A reactor for performing the aforementioned process is provided either in such a<br>
manner that both the two-steps can be performed in one catalytic tube, or in such a<br>
manner that the two steps can be performed in different catalytic tubes, respectively.<br>
US patent No. 4,256,783 discloses such a reactor.<br>
[8]	Meanwhile, (meth)acrylic acid producers have made diversified efforts to improve<br>
the structure of the above reactor so as to increase the production yield of (meth)acrylic<br>
acid obtained from the reactor; to propose the most suitable catalyst to induce<br>
oxidation; or to improve operating conditions of the process.<br>
[9]	As a part of such prior efforts, the high space velocity or the high concentration of<br>
propylene or the like supplied into the reactor is used.. In this case, there is a problem<br>
in that oxidation occurs rapidly in the reactor, making it difficult to control the<br>
resultant reaction temperature. There is another problem in that hot spots are generated<br>
in the catalyst layers of the reactor and heat accumulation occurs in the vicinities of the<br>
hot spots, so that the production of byproducts, such as carbon monoxide, carbon<br>
dioxide and acetic acid increases at high temperature, thereby reducing the yield of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid.<br>
[10]	Furthermore, when (meth)acrylic acid is produced by using propylene or the like to<br>
a high space velocity and high concentration, reaction temperature increases<br>
abnormally in the reactor, thereby causing various problems, such as the loss of active<br>
ingredients from the catalyst layer, or a reduction in the number of active sites caused<br>
by the sintering of metal components, resulting in degradation in the quality of the<br>
catalyst layer.<br>
[11]	Accordingly, in the production of (meth)acrylic acid, control of the reaction heat in<br>
the relevant reactor is the most important to ensure high productivity. Particularly, both<br>
the formation of hot spots in the catalyst layers and the heat accumulation in the<br>
. vicinities of the hot spots should be inhibited, and the reactor should be effectively<br>
controlled so that the hot spots do not cause the so-called runaway phenomenon of the<br><br>
3<br>
WO 2006/098601	PCT/KR2006/000979<br>
reactor (runaway: a state in which the reactor cannot be controlled or the reactor<br>
explodes due to a highly exothermic reaction). Therefore, it is very important to inhibit<br>
the generation of the hot spots and heat accumulation in the vicinities of the hot spots<br>
so as to extend the lifetime of catalysts and to inhibit side reactions, and thus to<br>
increase the yield of (meth)acrylic acid. To achieve these objectives, many attempts<br>
have been steadily made.<br>
[12]	Meanwhile, in order to operate the above processes more effectively, the reaction<br>
system should be designed in such a manner that it is suitable for oxidation with<br>
excessive heat generation. Particularly, in order to inhibit the deactivation of a catalyst<br>
caused by excessive heat generation, it is necessary to establish an efficient heat<br>
control system capable of controlling extremely high temperatures at hot spots, heat<br>
accumulation in the vicinities of the hot spots, and a runaway phenomenon. To provide<br>
an efficient heat control system, many studies have been made to establish a circulation<br>
pathway of molten salts by mounting various baffles (e.g., US patent No. 3,871,445),<br>
to design an oxidation reactor integrated with a cooling heat exchanger (e.g., US patent<br>
No. 3,147,084), to provide a multi-stage heat control structure using an improved heat<br>
exchanger system (e.g., Korean patent application No. 10-2002-40043, and PCT/<br>
KR02/02074), and to control the structure of a catalyst layer and the reaction<br>
temperature, so as to be suitable for an improved heat exchange system (e.g., Korean<br>
patent application No. 10-2004-0069117).<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[13]	In view of the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, the present<br>
inventors have made improvements in a fixed-bed shell-and-tube heat exchanger type<br>
reactor of producing unsaturated acids from olefins. An objective of the present<br>
invention is to provide a fixed-bed shell-and-tube heat exchanger-type reactor of<br>
producing unsaturated acids from olefins, which comprises a catalyst layer with no<br>
need for a layer of inactive materials, which has been packed in the reactor prior to a<br>
catalyst layer in a second-step reaction zone, by controlling the activity of an inlet<br>
portion of the catalyst layer of the second-step reaction zone and/or by controlling the<br>
second-step reaction zone in a multi-stage manner.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[14]	According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a shell-and-tube<br>
heat exchanger type reactor that can be used for a process of producing unsaturated<br>
acids from olefins via fixed-bed catalytic partial oxidation, which comprises at least<br>
one reaction tube, each including at least one first-step catalyst layer, in which olefins<br>
are oxidized by a first-step catalyst to mainly produce unsaturated aldehydes, and at<br><br>
4<br>
WO 2006/098601	PCT/KR2006/000979<br>
least two second-step catalyst layers, in which the unsaturated aldehydes are oxidized<br>
by a second-step catalyst to produce unsaturated acids, wherein a first catalyst layer of<br>
the second-step catalyst layers, disposed right adjacent to the first-step catalyst layer,<br>
has an activity corresponding to 5 ~ 30% of the activity of the catalyst layer having a<br>
highest activity among the second-step catalyst layers. There is also provided a method<br>
of producing unsaturated acids from olefins by using the same reactor.<br>
[15]	As used herein, the term 'activity' refers to the percent ratio of the conversion of<br>
unsaturated aldehydes into unsaturated acids in a relevant catalyst layer, divided by the<br>
conversion in the catalyst layer having the highest activity under the same conditions.<br>
Description of Drawings<br>
[16]	FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing the structure of a pilot reactor having one<br>
reaction tube, and the structure of a catalyst layer inside the reaction tube, wherein both<br>
the first-step reaction and the second-step reaction are carried out in one reactor<br>
according to Example 1 of the present invention.<br>
Mode for Invention<br>
[17]	Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained in more detail.<br>
[18]	The present invention provides a shell-and-tube heat exchanger type reactor that<br>
can be used for a process of producing unsaturated acids from olefins via fixed-bed<br>
catalytic partial oxidation, the reactor being an integrated reactor, in which a first-step<br>
reaction of mainly producing unsaturated aldehydes from olefins and a second-step<br>
reaction of producing unsaturated acids from the unsaturated aldehydes are carried out<br>
sequentially in one reaction tube. The present invention makes an improvement in the<br>
second-step reaction zone.<br>
[19]	(1) Catalyst Layer in Second-Step Reaction Zone<br>
[20]	The present invention is characterized in that the first catalyst layer of at least two<br>
second-step catalyst layers, disposed right adjacent to the first-step catalyst layer, has<br>
an activity corresponding to 5 ~ 30% of the activity of the catalyst layer having the<br>
highest activity among the second-step catalyst layers.<br>
[21]	In general, the inlet portion (herein, the second catalyst layer of the second-step<br>
catalyst layers) of the second-step reaction zone has a high concentration of unsaturated<br>
aldehydes and oxygen, thereby causing a severe reaction. Thus, the inlet<br>
portion contributes to the total conversion of the unsaturated aldehydes to a degree of<br>
40% or higher. Therefore, it is preferable to control the reaction in the inlet portion of<br>
the second-step reaction zone in such a manner that the peak temperature of the<br>
catalyst is significantly lower than the calcination temperature of the catalyst.<br>
[22]	The temperature of unsaturated aldehyde-containing gas produced from the firststep<br>
reaction generally ranges from 300 °C to 380 °C, which is the same as the<br><br>
5<br>
WO 2006/098601	PCT/KR2006/000979<br>
temperature of the first-step catalyst layer. The temperature of the second-step catalyst<br>
layer suitably ranges from 250 °C to 350 °C. Therefore, the unsaturated aldehyde-<br>
containinggas produced from the first-step reaction should be cooled so that the<br>
temperature of the gas is adjusted to the reaction temperature of the second-step<br>
reaction zone. For this, an inactive layer formed of inactive materials has been<br>
introduced between the first-step reaction zone and the second-step reaction zone<br>
according to the prior art. However, according to the present invention, a catalyst layer,<br>
which has the activity of the second-step catalyst but a significantly lower catalytic<br>
activity, for example by mixing inactive materials with the second-step catalyst, is<br>
introduced into a reactor. By doing so, it is possible to reduce the temperature of the<br>
unsaturated aldehyde-containing gas produced from the first-step reaction, while<br>
decreasing the load of conversion of the unsaturated aldehydes in the second catalyst<br>
layer of the second-step catalyst layers, in which unsaturated acids are produced to a<br>
full scale.<br>
[23]	In other words, according to the present invention, at least two second-step catalyst<br>
layers are disposed right adjacent to the first-step catalyst layer with no use of an<br>
inactive layer, wherein the first catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers<br>
performs pre-reaction of a part of the unsaturated aldehydes into unsaturated acids, so<br>
that the second catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers can perform the<br>
reaction of producing unsaturated acids from unsaturated aldehydes to a full scale<br>
under mild conditions with a reduced load of conversion of unsaturated aldehydes. Par-ticularly,the first catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers causes the un-<br>
saturatedaldehyde-containing gas produced from the first-step reaction to have a<br>
temperature and a pressure, suitable for the reaction conditions of the second catalyst<br>
layer of the second-step catalyst layers. For example, the unsaturated aldehyde-<br>
containinggas (reaction product of the first-step reaction) present at about 300 °C can<br>
be adapted to the reaction temperature of the second-step reaction zone, which is lower<br>
than the above temperature by about 30 ~ 50 °C, by virtue of the first catalyst layer of<br>
the second-step catalyst layers. Therefore, it is possible to prevent excessive heat<br>
generation in the second-step reaction zone and to extend the lifetime of the second-<br>
step catalyst.<br>
[24]	Additionally, when the load of conversion of the unsaturated aldehydes in the<br>
second catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers decreases, it is possible to suf-<br>
ficientlyincrease the temperature of a heat transfer medium in the shell space cor-<br>
respondingto the second catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers, resulting in<br>
an increase in the conversion, and thus an increase in the yield of unsaturated acids.<br>
[25]	Herein, it is preferable that the first catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers<br>
shows a drop of the load of conversion of unsaturated aldehydes (i.e., conversion of<br><br>
6<br>
WO 2006/098601	PCT/KR2006/000979<br>
unsaturated aldehydes into unsaturated acids, caused by the first layer of the second-<br>
step catalyst layers) of 5 ~ 30%.<br>
[26]	Also, it is preferable that the first catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers<br>
has a catalytic activity corresponding to 5 ~ 30% of the catalytic activity of the catalyst<br>
layer having the highest activity among the second-step catalyst layers, so that the<br>
aldehyde-containing mixed reaction gas introduced into the second catalyst layer of the<br>
second-step catalyst layers can be cooled to a temperature suitable for oxidation.<br>
[27]	The unsaturated aldehyde-containing gas, which is a reaction product obtained<br>
from the first-step reaction zone (i.e., gas containing unsaturated aldehydes, oxygen,<br>
nitrogen, steam, unsaturated acids, acetic acid, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and a<br>
small amount of byproducts), has a temperature higher than the HTS (heat transfer salt)<br>
present at the inlet of the second-step reaction zone by 20 °C or more. Hence, the first<br>
catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers should be designed so as to inhibit an<br>
excessive exothermic reaction. For this reason, it is preferable for the first catalyst<br>
layer of the second-step catalyst layers to have a catalytic activity corresponding to 5 ~<br>
30% of the catalytic activity of the catalyst layer having the highest activity among the<br>
second-step catalyst layer.<br>
[28]	For example, when mixing catalyst particles with inactive material particles to<br>
provide the first catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers, it is possible to use the<br>
catalyst particles to an amount of 5 ~ 30 wt%.<br>
[29]	Methods of reducing the activity of the first catalyst layer of the second-step<br>
catalyst layers include: a method of mixing the same catalytically active component as<br>
used in another catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers with inactive materials<br>
and packing the resultant mixture into the first catalyst layer; a method of forming the<br>
first catalyst layer by using a catalyst having a catalytically active component or a<br>
composition, different from the active component or the composition used in another<br>
catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers; a method of forming the first catalyst<br>
layer by using a catalytically active material having different particle sizes or volumes,<br>
or catalyst pellets having different particle sizes or volumes; or a method of modifying<br>
catalyst calcination temperatures. When the first catalyst layer of the second-step<br>
catalyst layers is mixed with inactive materials, the catalytically active component may<br>
be mixed with inactive material powder before pelletizing the catalyst. Otherwise, the<br>
pellets of inactive materials may be mixed with catalyst pellets. In the latter case, the<br>
catalyst pellets include not only catalysts comprising catalytically active components<br>
alone but also supported catalysts comprising catalytically active components<br>
supported on some carriers. The shapes of such catalyst pellets include a spherical<br>
shape, hollow cylindrical shape, cylindrical shape or other particle shapes.<br>
[30]	The inactive materials that may be used in the first catalyst layer of the second-step<br><br>
7<br>
WO 2006/098601	PCT/KR2006/000979<br>
catalyst layers include alumina, silica alumina, stainless steel, iron, steatite, porcelain<br>
and various ceramic products. The pellets of such inactive materials may take the form<br>
of spheres, cylinders, rings, rods, plates, iron nets and agglomerates with a suitable<br>
size. If desired, inactive materials having different forms may be used in combination<br>
at an adequate mixing ratio.<br>
[31]	Meanwhile, the first catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers preferably has<br>
a length corresponding to 5 ~ 50% of the length of the reaction tube of the second-step<br>
reaction zone.<br>
[32]	The first catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers is the layer having a<br>
reduced catalytic activity so as to prevent degradation in the thermal stability caused<br>
by an excessive reaction heat, which is generated by chemical reactions in the catalyst<br>
layer. However, it is preferable for the first catalyst layer to provide a conversion ratio<br>
of reactants to a degree of 5% or more, in order to ensure the effect of stabilizing the<br>
temperature in the second catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers. The length<br>
of the first catalyst layer depends on the activity of the corresponding catalyst In order<br>
to provide a conversion ratio of about 5% by the first catalyst layer, based on the total<br>
conversion ratio of the second-step reaction, the first catalyst layer should have a<br>
length corresponding to at least 5% of the length of the reaction tube of the second-step<br>
reaction zone, with the proviso that the first catalyst layer has an activity as disclosed<br>
herein. However, when the length of the first catalyst layer is too long relative to the<br>
total length of the second-step catalyst layer, the overall activity of the total catalyst<br>
layer decreases, which may result in a significant decrease in conversion ratio.<br>
Therefore, it is preferable that the first catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers<br>
is less than 50% of the length of the second-step reaction zone. In other words, highactivity<br>
catalyst layers of the second-step catalyst layers, except the first catalyst layer,<br>
should be provided to a proportion of at least 50%, so as to obtain a conversion ratio of<br>
at least 95%.<br>
[33]	As described above, the catalyst layer according to the present invention avoids a<br>
need for an inactive layer for cooling between the first-step reaction zone and the<br>
second-step reaction zone, and makes it possible to reduce the length of the catalytic<br>
reaction tube. Therefore, the reactor according to the present invention is very costefficient.<br>
[34]	(2) Partition for Dividing First-Step Reaction Zone from Second-Step Reaction<br>
Zone, and Placement of First Catalyst Layer of Second-Step Catalyst Layers<br>
[35]	The composition, temperature and pressure of feed mixture to the second-step<br>
reaction zone, namely, those of a resultant product in the first-step reaction zone in<br>
which unsaturated aldehydes are mainly produced from olefins, depend on those of<br>
feed mixture to the first-step reaction zone. Hence, it is preferable to change the<br><br>
8<br>
WO 2006/098601	PCT/KR2006/000979<br>
temperature condition of a heat transfer medium in the second-step reaction zone in<br>
order to establish new optimal process conditions flexibly depending on variations in<br>
the external environment and feed mixture conditions.<br>
[36]	According to another aspect of the present invention, the shell space of the reactor<br>
is divided axially by using a partition into two shell spaces, wherein one of the shell<br>
spaces mainly comprises the first-step reaction zone and the other of the shell spaces<br>
comprises the second-step reaction zone. Herein, the first catalyst layer of the secondstep<br>
catalyst layers, corresponding to the inlet portion of the second-step reaction zone,<br>
is packed into the reaction tube in such a manner that it includes the whole sections of<br>
the partition, by which the shell space of the first-step reaction zone is divided from<br>
that of the second-step reaction zone. Considering the cost needed for the construction<br>
of the reactor, it is preferable for the first catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst<br>
layers to occupy the first-step reaction zone by at most 500 mm. Retention time cor-responding to about 500 mm may reduce the load of conversion of unsaturated<br>
aldehydes to about 10%. When the first catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst<br>
layers, which has a low catalytic activity according to the present invention, is<br>
disposed in the reaction tube at a position corresponding to the portion having the<br>
partition, by which the shell space of the first-step reaction zone is divided from that of<br>
the second-step reaction zone, it is possible to prevent a local temperature increase<br>
caused by an incomplete heat transfer at the portion having the partition.<br>
[37]	(3) Multi-stage Heat Control for Second-Step Reaction Zone<br>
[38]	According to the present invention, the catalyst layer is formed with no use of a<br>
cooling layer that has been packed into the reactor prior to the catalyst layer of the<br>
second-step reaction zone. For this reason, it is preferable to perform the heat control<br>
of the second-step reaction zone in a multi-stage manner, besides controlling the<br>
catalytic activity of the first catalyst layer of the second-step reaction zone.<br>
[39]	To perform such multi-stage heat control, it is preferable to further divide the shell<br>
corresponding to the second-step reaction zone into at least two shell spaces by using<br>
partitions, and to set the temperature of the heat transfer medium supplied to each shell<br>
space in an independent manner.<br>
[40]	By doing so, it is possible to set an optimal temperature depending on the activity<br>
of the catalyst packed into the reaction tube of the relevant shell, and thus to increase<br>
the yield. Also, it is possible to inhibit heat accumulation at a hot spot and to prevent a<br>
so-called runaway phenomenon by virtue of the aforementioned multi-stage heat<br>
control.<br>
[41]	It is preferable to set the temperature of the heat transfer medium in such a manner<br>
that the temperature of the reaction mixture at the beginning of the first catalyst layer<br>
of the second-step catalyst layers is higher than the temperature of the heat transfer<br><br>

medium circulating in the fiist shell space of the second-step reaction zone by 20 ~ 70<br>
°C . This makes it possible to inhibit an excessive exothermic reaction and to provide a<br>
sufficient catalytic activity. On the other hand, it is preferable to set the temperature of<br>
the heat transfer media of the subsequent shell spaces high enough to increase the<br>
conversion of the unsaturated aldehyde as high as possible.<br>
[42]	Reference will now be made hi detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention. It is to be understood that the following examples are illustrative only and<br>
the present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
[43]	Example 1. Use of Mixed Catalyst Layer and Multi-stage Heat Control<br>
[44]	The following experiment was carried out in a pilot reactor having one reaction<br>
tube, in which both the first-step reaction and the second-step reaction are performed.<br>
The reaction tube had an inner diameter of 26 mm. The first-step catalyst layer and the<br>
second-step catalyst layer were packed into the reaction tube to a height of about 3570<br>
mm and about 3125 mm, respectively. The catalyst packed into the first-step reaction<br>
zone was a first-step oxidation catalyst based on molybdenum (Mo) and bismuth (bi).<br>
Preparation of the catalyst is disclosed in Korean Patent No. 0349602 (Korean Patent<br>
Application No; 10-1997-0045132). Each of the three catalyst layers packed into the<br>
second-step reaction zone was comprised of a second-step oxidation catalyst based on<br>
molybdenum (Mo) and vanadium (V). Preparation of the catalyst is disclosed in<br>
Korean Patent No. 0204728 or 0204729.<br>
[45]	The second-step catalyst layers were formed by using three catalyst layers that<br>
have different activities, increasing when viewed from the inlet to the outlet (see US<br>
Patent Nos. 3801634 and 4837360: Control of Catalytic Activity). The first catalyst<br>
layer of the second-step catalyst layers, which was the inlet portion of the second-step<br>
reaction zone, was comprised of a mixture of 20 wt% of the same catalytic substance<br>
as used in the third catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers and 80 wt% of an<br>
inactive material. Therefore, the first catalyst layer had an activity corresponding to<br>
about 20% of the activity of the third catalyst layer. The second catalyst layer of the<br>
second-step catalyst layers had an activity corresponding to about 87% based on the<br>
activity of the mird catalyst layer.<br>
[46]	The three catalyst layers of the second-step reaction zone had a height of 500 mm,<br>
700 mm and 1925 mm, respectively, along the axial direction. The mixed layer as the<br>
first catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst layers was packed into the reaction tube<br>
corresponding to the shell space of the second-step reaction zone to a height of 250<br>
mm, and the remaining height (250 mm) of the first catalyst layer was packed in such a<br>
manner that the remaining part covered the partition (partition for dividing the firststep<br>
reaction zone from the second-step reaction zone) and some part of the shell space<br>
of the first-step reaction zone.<br><br>
10<br>
WO 2006/098601	PCT/KR2006/000979<br>
[47]	The second-step reaction zone was divided into two independent shell spaces by a<br>
partition disposed at the border between the second catalyst layer and the third catalyst<br>
layer. Each of the molten salts filled into each of the shell spaces was individually set<br>
at a temperature of 275 °C and 270 °C .<br>
[48]	Starting materials injected into the second-step reaction zone (at the position of the<br>
partition for dividing the first-step reaction zone from the second-step reaction zone)<br>
included acrolein, acrylic acid, oxygen, steam and nitrogen gas. More particularly, the<br>
starting materials included 5.5% of acrolein, 0.9% of acrylic acid, 5.0% of oxygen,<br>
1.0% of byproducts including CO and acetic acid, and the remaining amount of<br>
nitrogen gas. The space velocity in the second-step reaction zone was 1500 hr-1<br>
(standard temperature and pressure, STP). Herein, the space velocity of acrolein as a<br>
hydrocarbon reactant supplied to the second-step reaction zone had a space velocity of<br>
81 hr-1 (STP) and the mixed feed gas had a pressure of 0.4 kgf/cm2 G.<br>
[49]	In the second-step reaction zone, two catalyst layers except the first catalyst layer<br>
(mixed layer) showed temperature peaks at a temperature of 309.4 °C and 321.7 °C<br>
along the axial direction. When propylene was introduced into the first-step reaction<br>
zone to an amount of 7.0%, yield of acrylic acid was 86.2%. Yields of byproducts, i.e.,<br>
CO (carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide) and acetic acid were 8.51% and 1.80%, respectively.<br>
[50]	The reaction mixture that reached the first catalyst layer of the second-step catalyst<br>
layers along the axial direction showed a temperature of 316 °C, which was different<br>
from the temperature of the first heat transfer medium of the second-step reaction zone<br>
by41°C.<br>
[51]	Comparative Example 1: Experiment with No Use of Mixed Layer and Multi<br>
stageHeat Control<br>
[52]	The shell space of the second-step reaction zone was a single non-divided shell<br>
space. Additionally, a cooling layer formed of inactive particles was disposed between<br>
the first-step reaction zone and the second-step reaction zone. The cooling layer was<br>
packed into the reactor to a height of 500 mm. More particularly, the cooling layer was<br>
packed into the second-step reaction zone to a height of 250 mm, and the remaining<br>
part of the cooling layer was packed into the reaction tube ranging from the partition to<br>
the first-step reaction zone. The second-step catalyst layers included two different<br>
kinds of catalysts, which were the same as used in the second catalyst layer and the<br>
third catalyst layer of Example 1, respectively. Both catalyst layers were packed to a<br>
height of 700 mm and 2000 mm along the axial direction. The heat transfer medium<br>
was set at a temperature of 270 °C under an isothermal condition. Except the foregoing,<br>
the experiment was carried out in the same manner as described in Example 1. Additionally,<br>
the two kinds of catalysts, which were used in Example 1, were used in this<br><br>
11<br>
WO 2006/098601	PCT/KR2006/000979<br>
Example to the same total amount.<br>
[53]	In the second-step reaction zone, two catalyst layers showed temperature peaks at a<br>
temperature of 318.2 °C and 305.2 °C along the axial direction. Yield of acrylic acid<br>
was 84.4%. Yields of byproducts, i.e., COx (carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide) and<br>
acetic acid were 10.4% and 2.03%, respectively.<br>
[54]	Comparative Example 2: Experiment with No Use of Mixed Layer and Multi<br>
stage Heat Control<br>
[55]	Comparative Example 1 was repeated, except that the heat transfer medium was set<br>
at a temperature of 275 °C.<br>
[56]	In the second-step reaction zone, two catalyst layers showed temperature peaks at a<br>
temperature of 325.1 °C and 324.9 oC along the axial direction. Yield of acrylic acid<br>
was 82.9%. Yields of byproducts, i.e., COx (carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide) and<br>
acetic acid were 11.4% and 2.42%, respectively.<br>
[57]	<discussion><br>
[58]	It can be seen from the above results of Example 1 and Comparative Examples 1<br>
and 2 that Example 1 provides a higher yield of acrylic acid, compared to the other<br>
Examples by about 2% or more, and shows the first peak at a significantly stable<br>
temperature. Yield of acrylic acid relates directly to the productivity, and thus is very<br>
important. Additionally, the first peak temperature is important because it relates to the<br>
lifetime of the catalyst. Reactions carried out in the second catalyst layer of the second-<br>
step reaction zone according to Example 1 and the first catalyst layer of the second-<br>
step reaction zone according to Comparative Examples 1 and 2 contribute the total<br>
acrolein conversion by 50% or more. Although the above catalyst layers are relatively<br>
short, they provide a relatively high conversion. In these layers, the compositions of<br>
acrolein and oxygen are high, resulting in a severe reaction. Thus, in these layers, it is<br>
preferable to control the reactions in such a manner that the peak temperature of the<br>
catalyst is significantly lower than the calculation temperature of the catalyst.<br>
According to Example 1, the peak temperature is 309.4 °C. This indicates that the<br>
reaction is carried out at a temperature significantly lower than the reaction tem-<br>
peratures in Comparative Examples 1 and 2 (318.2 °C and 325.1 °C ). Therefore,<br>
because the reaction is carried out at the Met portion of the catalyst layers, having a<br>
high conversion load, under a milder condition, it is possible to extend the lifetime of<br>
the catalyst.<br>
[59]	Additionally, Example 1 uses a mixed layer comprising a diluted catalyst in the<br>
inlet portion, and thus permits a pre-reaction in a catalyst layer having a significantly<br>
lower catalytic activity. Hence, it is possible to reduce the load of conversion of<br>
acrolein into acrylic acid in the second catalyst layer to a certain degree. Because a part<br>
of acrolein is preliminarily converted into acrylic acid under a mild condition provided<br><br>
12<br>
WO 2006/098601	PCT/KR2006/000979<br>
by the diluted mixed catalyst layer, the second catalyst layer can have a significantly<br>
lower load of conversion of acrolein, compared to the loads of Comparative Examples<br>
1 and 2 with no use of a mixed layer. Also, it is possible to obtain a higher conversion<br>
by increasing the temperature of the heat transfer medium in the first shell space along<br>
the axial direction, resulting in an increase in the yield of acrylic acid. In Example 1,<br>
the first heat transfer medium has a temperature of 275 °C, which is higher than the<br>
corresponding temperature of Comparative Example 1 by 5 °C. However, the peak<br>
temperature of the catalyst layer according to Example 1 is lower than the cor-<br>
responding temperature of Comparative Example 1 by about 9 °C. This is because the<br>
mixed layer allows the reaction to be performed partially.<br>
[60]	In Comparative Example 2, the temperature of the heat transfer medium in the shell<br>
space of the second-step reaction zone is same as the corresponding temperature of the<br>
first shell space of the second-step reaction zone in Example 1 (275 °C). However, due<br>
to the lack of the mixed layer in the inlet portion, acrolein reacts severely with oxygen<br>
under a high concentration, so that the peak temperature increases to 325.1 °C. Such<br>
reaction performed at a high temperature may result in a drop in the lifetime of the first<br>
catalyst layer having a high load of conversion.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[61]	As described above, according to the present invention, there is provided a<br>
structure of catalyst layers, a heat control system and a processing condition, adequate<br>
to an improved reactor for producing unsaturated acids via two-step oxidation of<br>
oleftns. Thus, it is possible to obtain a final product in a stable manner even under a<br>
high load reaction conditions. Additionally, use of the heat control system prevents the<br>
generation of a hot spot or inhibits heat accumulation at the hot spot. Therefore, it is<br>
possible to obtain a high productivity of unsaturated acids and to extend the lifetime of<br>
a catalyst.<br><br>
