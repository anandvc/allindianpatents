METHOD AND  DEVICE  FOR  THE  WATERPROOFING  OF  JOINTS  AND CRACKS IN HYDRAULIC WORKS, CONCRETE AND MASONRY STRUCTURES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention refers to the waterproofing of hydraulic structures  such as roller compacted concrete dams  (RCC dams),  concrete, gravity dams  and masonry gravity dams, embankment  dams  with  a  concrete  waterproofing upstream facing,  canals,  tunnels,  reservoirs and similar,  and of concrete and masonry structures in general. In particular, this invention concerns a method for the waterproofing of contraction and/or construction joints, deteriorated joints and/or cracks, here in after referred to also as joints" or * cracks" in the concrete or masonry lining or body of hydraulic structures as well as  in the concrete and/or masonry structures of  the type previously referred to, having a surface in contact with water or a surface with points and/or cracks through which water seepage can occur; the  invention  alsc  relates  to  a  layered waterproofing covering device for joints, cracks and the like, obtained by the waterproofing method mentioned above.<br>
According to well known concepts, in the construction of hydraulic structures, for example of concrete dams or roller compacted concrete dams, or in the construction of embankment dams, both earthfill and rockfill, it is necessary to provide a proper waterproofing of the upstream face in order to prevent water seepage from the reservoir, which represents an economic loss and which can compromise the integrity and the stability of the dam body itself.<br>
The constructive methodology of dams and hydraulic structures, or of concrete or masonry structures of any type, has therefore to take into account the shrinkage and<br><br>
thermal expansion phenomena, and the movements due to settlement or to other causes which the hydraulic structure or the concrete structure can undergo over time, for example at variation in hydraulic load on the upstream side of a dam, which can cause the opening or widening of the joints of the concrete waterproofing liner, or the formation of dangerous cracks through which seepage of water could occur.<br>
In particular, in the design and construction of RCC dams it is necessary to consider the deformations induced by the hydration process of the concrete because, after reaching the maximum hydration heat, the decrease of the temperature of the dam body until it reaches a stable condition, is accompanied by contraction phenomena of the concrete volume, which can cause cracking.<br>
Therefore, in these hydraulic structures it is necessary to provide proper contraction joints in order 10 avoid that uncontrolled cracking can occur.<br>
The contraction joints generally create preferential lines for the formation of cracks in the upstream face of the dam, due to the contraction of the concrete, which develop vertically parallel to the slope.<br>
The contraction joints also undergo some movements, generally to a lesser extent, even after the concrete has reached its equilibrium temperature. These movements can be caused by the variations of the water lever in the reservoir, by seismic phenomena, or by other causes.<br>
In general, joints and/or cracks represent a discontinuity<br>
in the concrete or masonry waterproofing liner of the upstream face of a dam or of any hydraulic structure or<br><br>
3<br>
other structure. Therefore this discontinuity must be treated so as to avoid possible water seepage.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
The traditional systems which are at present adopted for the waterproofing of joints and/or cracks usually foresee the use of synthetic or copper material, the so-called 'waterstops", arranged in single or double rows, embedded in the concrete as it is being cast during the construction of the hydraulic structure or other structure, and therefore they interfere with the constructive process.<br>
In general, the employment of the known waterproofing systems, besides interfering with the constructive process, makes it quite difficult to intervene for any maintenance or repair operation, when joints deteriorate. As a matter of fact, these systems generally do not provide a proper waterproofing, durable over time and capable of compensating movements or settlements that should occur in the body of the hydraulic structure or of the concrete and/cr masonry structure, without losing their fundamental waterproofing characteristics.<br>
While the contraction joints in RCC dams or the construction joints in concrete dams or similar hydraulic works represent a discontinuity induced in the concrete waterproofing liner, and therefore waterproofed since the construction of the hydraulic work itself, other casual discontinuities can occur during operation, when, for any reason, the concrete or the masonry crack, or the waterstops waterproofing the joints deteriorate over time or for accidental causes.<br>
Therefore,  this cracks or deterioration,  if not properly<br><br>
4<br>
protected and checked,  can	cause water seepage,  with<br>
damaging    consequences.	DE-A-19518732    shows    a<br>
waterproofing  system  where	a  membrane  is  in  direct<br>
contact  with  an  underlying	metal  strip,  without  any<br>
protection substrate.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The general object of this invention is to provide a method for the waterproofing of joints and/or deteriorated joints and/or of cracks in the concrete liners of hydraulic structures such as dams or similar structures, and in concrete and/or masonry structures, which can remedy the inconveniences of waterproofing systems previously in use.<br>
More in particular, an object of this invention is to provide a waterproofing method as referred to above, which is quite independent from the constructive process of the hydraulic structure or masonry structures and which can be applied subsequently.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method for the waterproofing of joints and/or cracks as mentioned above, which has such a high degree of elastic deformability and of independence of its components, that it can follow any movement which should occur in joints or cracks, subsequent to the movements of the dam body or the hydraulic structure to be protected and/or repaired, without losing the waterproofing and mechanical resistance  characteristics.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a waterproofing of joints, cracks and the like as previously defined, which is external to the hydraulic structure or other type of structure and which therefore allows control and repair interventions after its installation.<br>
The invention is also aiming to employ a membrane in<br><br>
5<br>
elastically yieldable synthetic material/ for the waterproofing of contraction joints, construction joints, cracks and the like, in particular in the upstream faces or in existing surfaces which get in touch with water in hydraulic structures such as RCC dams, concrete dams, embankment dams having a concrete upstream face, tunnels, water conveyance structures, reservoirs and similar hydraulic structures.<br>

We will describe here below the general principles of the method  for  the  waterproofing  of  joints  and/or  cracks according to the invention, by means of a waterproofing membrane,  referring as an example to a roller compacted concrete  cam,  without  intending  this  example  in  a restrictive way, since the waterproofing method described can be applied to any concrete and/or masonry structure; for the aims of- this invention,  waterproofing membrane" means a strip of prefixed width, obtained from a synthetic, waterproofing and elastically yieldable material, such as PVC, ??, PE and similar synthetic material.<br>
CONTRACTION JOINTS OF RCC DAMS<br>
Figure 1 shows a front view of the upstream face 10 of an RCC  dam  consisting  of  superimposed  layers  of  roller compacted concrete; during the construction of the layers, contraction joints 11 are formed, which extend vertically, parallel to the slope of the upstream face, for the whole height of the dam body.<br>
As shown in figure 2, the _contraction joint 11 prolongs inside the concrete body of the single layers 10, so as to constitute a preferential line for cracking.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD<br>
As shown in the two above-mentioned figures/ the method for the waterproofing of joint 11 foresees the use of a strip of waterproofing membrane 13, of suitable width, obtained from  a - sheet  cf  flexible  and  elastically  yieldable<br><br>
9<br>
material/ with a low permeability, which is installed on the whole vertical development of joint 11 so that it entirely covers it, if needed prolonging it in correspondence with the dam heel in order to allow the connection with the waterproofing system of a curb or a foundation beam, as it will be further explained.<br>
Strip 13 of waterproofing material is installed external to the upstream face 10 in order not to interfere with the construction of the dam.<br>
In order to adequately support the waterproofing membrane 13 and to avoid the membrane to be damaged by puncturing or intrusion in the crack, according to this invention it is foreseen to previously install a suitable support element for supporting the membrane 13 which prevents the intrusion of the same membrane 13 into the joint 11 under the thrust of the hydraulic load of the water impounded in the upstream reservoir, or due to any movement of the dam body.<br>
The support element for supporting the waterproofing membrane must be executed in such a way as to be able to follow the maximum allowed opening movements of the contraction joint 11 under the maximum foreseen hydraulic load, and the subsequent closing movements, without interfering with the strip of the waterproofing membrane.<br>
The support element can consist of one or more rigid plates in steel or another kind of material, connected to the concrete body of the upstream face, and placed across joint 11 so as to allow relevant movements.<br>
More precisely,  in the example shown in figures 1 and 2,<br>
the support element consists of two plates 14 and 15, partially overlapped;  each plate  is  fastened at  spaced<br><br>
10<br>
apart points, alone only one lateral edge, by means of anchoring rods, respectively 16 and 17, so as to allow free sliding of the two plates one over the other during the opening and closing movements of joint 11, while allowing support of membrane 13.<br>
The two supporting plates 14 and 15 consist of one or more shaped portions, axially aligned, which extend for the whole length of joint 11.<br>
In order to prevent the waterproofing membrane 13 from any failures or puncturing actions caused by the supporting plates 14 and. 15, and in order to grant the independence of movement between the support plates and the same membrane, one or more protection and sliding substrates are interposed, between the supporting plates and the waterproofing membrane 13, said substrates being fastened to the concrete body of the upstream face 10, on both side of the supporting plates 14, 15.<br>
More precisely, as shown in figures 1 and 2, immediately over the supporting plates 14 and 15, a transition substrate 13 of considerable thickness is provided, for examples having a weight from 0.5 to 3 Kg/m, comprising a synthetic sheet material, preferably a geotextile witn great mass per unit area; over the transition substrate 25 a second sliding substrate 19 is overlapped, in geosynthetic material, for example constituted by a strip of the same material used for the membrane 13 waterproofing the joint, in order to grant a free sliding movement of the same membrane in respect to the joint. Both the protection substrate 18 and the sliding substrate 19 are fastened at spaced apart points to the concrete existing surface 10 by means of anchoring rods 20.<br><br>
11<br>
Therefore  the  two  substrates  18 and 19 have a double function,  namely:  the protection layer or layers 18,  in geotextile  or  other  suitable material,  avoid  that  the mutual sliding of the two supporting plates 14 and 15 interferes with the waterproofing strip 13, damaging it for example because of the puncturing action of the edges of the plates themselves,  while the sliding substrate 19, besides  constituting  a  further  mechanical  support  and additional protection for strip 13 of the waterproofing membrane, allows also a free sliding of the membrane over substrates 18 and 19 and over the supporting plates 14 and 15 during the dilatation and contraction movements of joint 11.<br>
As shown in the enlarged section of figure 2, strip 13 of the waterproofing membrane is watertight fastened against the concrete existing surface of the facing, along its lateral edges, in a way totally independent from the substrates 18 and 19 and the supporting plates 14 and 15.<br>
For this purpose, metal profiles 21 have been applied along the lateral edges of membrane 13; these profiles tightly press the edges 13' of the membrane against the surface of the upstream face 10, also foreseeing the interposition of a suitable watertight gasket 22.<br>
The face or surface on which the watertight fastening is constructed is previously regularised by the application of proper material 22', such as epoxy resins and similar.<br>
The metal profiles 21 are fastened by means of threaded rods 23 anchored in the concrete, on which the blocking nuts 24 are screwed with interposition of suitable washers.<br>
In this way a continuous watertight line is constructed<br><br>
12 along the two edges of the waterproofing membrane 13.<br>
As previously described, the waterproofing method employs, as a waterproofing - element, a flexible synthetic, elastically yieldable, in form of a strip comprising one or more sections suitably welded one to the other, which extends for the whole length of the contraction joint 11; the waterproofing membrane 13 is preferably composed by a geocomposite consisting of a low permeability synthetic geomembrane coupled to a geosynthetic material having different properties. Therefore only the waterproofing geomembrane is exposed to the action of the reservoir, while the coupled geocomposite is suitably protected and constitutes a further antipuncturing and supporting layer which increases the dimensional stability of the geomembrane itself.<br>
The flexibility and the elasticity of the synthetic geomembrane and of the system by which it is fastened to the dam concrete face, over joint 11 to be protected, are such as to allow the membrane to elastically deform along its entire extension, following the opening and closing movements of joint 11 under the maximum foreseen hydraulic load, or due to other causes.<br>
As shown in figure 2, over the waterproofing membrane 13, slightly detached from it, it is possible to add an additional protection which substantially consists of a shield 25 which extends for the entire length of the waterproofing membrane and beyond its lateral edges, for example a steel slab separately and independently fastened to the upstream face by means of anchoring rods 26, slab 25 being supported by means of spacers and bolts 28 that can be screwed on the threaded end of the rods.<br><br>
i3<br>
In order to allow the protection shield 25 a sliding movement independent from the movement of the protection membrane, on one side of shield 25 the anchoring rods 26 are placed through^holes 29, which are oval-shaped or have . larger dimensions/ to allow a relative movement in transverse and/or longitudinal direction in respect to the protection shield 25.<br>
Connection to the foundation beam<br>
As previously described, the membrane 13 for the waterproofing of the joint can be extended in correspondence of the dam heel so as to allow the connection with the waterproofing system of a curb or a foundation beam, as schematically represented in the example of figures 5 and 6 of the attached drawings.<br>
The connection is executed by extending and positioning membrane 13 over the foundation beam 30 to which it is fastened by means of proper mechanical anchoring profiles.<br>
The flap 13" of the membrane is extended on the beam 30 for a brief stretch of 30-40 cm, in any case so long as to be sufficient to overlap on area 31 where the waterproofing of a joint in the foundation foeazn may have been executed, for example by injection into a proper sump of epoxy resins or similar, or by waterstops in PVC or similar.<br>
As shown in figures 5 and 6, flap 13" of the membrane is watertight anchored along its three edges by aeans of metal profiles 32 which are fastened by means of anchoring rods 33. A ballast 34 can be placed on the folded part 13" of the waterproofing membrane, upon previous interposition of further protection synthetic material 35, in order to allow a close contact between the waterproofing membrane and the<br><br>
14<br>
grout curtain.<br>
The flap 13" of the membrane can be physically connected to material 31 waterproofing the beam joints, for example by means of an adhesive 36 or by welding, according to the material employed.<br>
With this configuration, the waterproofing of the joint is connected with the beam at the dam heel, achieving a continuity between the waterproofing of the joint on the upstream face, the waterproofing of the foundation beam, and the grout curtain that is generally provided in the foundation beam towards the underlying ground.<br>
The upper fastening of membrane 13 is similar to the lateral ones which have already been described.<br>
Other applications<br>
The waterproofing method for joints, previously described, beside being suitable for waterproof the contraction joints in RCC dams, can also be employed for restoring waterproofing in correspondence of deteriorated construction joints of concrete dams, or of cracks which should occur over time, for different causes, in the faces of concrete dams, or in the concrete face of embankment dams, or in the faces of other concrete or masonry structures.<br>
The waterproofing method results substantially identical to the previously described one and can be applied both at the<br>
end of construction of the dam, and as a rehabilitation intervention to waterproof joints of existing hydraulic structures, as well as cracks produced by the deterioration of concrete. Should the waterproofing not be extended over<br><br>
15<br>
the foundation beam, the perimeter fastening of the membrane ' at bottom is similar to the one adopted for watertight fastening the lateral edges.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 of the attached drawings show the perimeter anchorage 37 at the bottom of a waterproofing membrane 13 should this membrane not reach the foundation beam 30 or the heel of the hydraulic structure. In this case it is possible to connect the waterproofing obtained with membrane 13 in the above-mentioned way, to a pre-existing joint 39 which has deteriorated, or to a crack, by means of injecting a sealing material 38 into a hole which has been put in contact with the crack or the defective joint 39.<br>
From what has been said and shown in the attached drawings, it will therefore be evident that we have provided a met hoc for the waterprocfing of joints for roller compacted concrete dams, concrete dams, or embankment dams with a concrete upstream face, and for the waterproofing of deteriorated joints and/or cracks in concrete and/or masonry structures.<br>
Hence, what has been said and shown with reference to the attached drawings has been given as a mere example of the general principles of the invention and of some of its preferential constructive configurations; other modifications or variants can be made without departing from what claimed.<br><br>
