				<td>The present invention relates to advance toothbrush. In modern era, people stress and adopt the concept of reuse. During continuous use often the bristles get damaged, hence requirement of a new toothbrush is always an obvious solution. Moreover toothpaste is to be kept always handy while using any toothbrush. The purpose of the invention is to provide a readymade arrangement so that toothbrush and toothpaste can be accommodated in a single assembly. PRIOR ART<br>
Different type of toothbrushes is available in the market. Many of these are patented. Many of the advance toothbrushes can be studied from patents viz., US5842487, US4717278,US5181531,US5425590,US5439014,US5746532,US5911532,DE3312392,D El 000391 ,US4521128,US5913632,US5100252,US5066155,US4291995,US6056469,US 6062233 etc. Advantages over prior art:<br>
1	Advance toothbrush can be made from any of metal, plastic or rubber so that it<br>
will be  more durable, more attractive from the existing one.<br>
2	Advance toothbrush is made from many parts; which can be replaced whenever<br>
needed.<br>
3	In advance toothbrush the portion of brush called head which is having bristles<br>
can be detached from the neck, and the most common problem occurring with the<br>
brushes is same i.e. their    bristles got damaged.<br>
4	In advance toothbrush   any existing toothpaste can be filled as per demand.<br>
5	Advance toothbrush can be filled number of times with desired toothpaste.<br><br>
6	The bristles portion i.e. head of advance toothbrush can be made up in   number<br>
of designs, so that consumer may use brush of its choice and convenience.<br>
7	In advance toothbrush    brush and toothpaste are provided in a single assembly,<br>
this eases the consumers a lot as no need to carry separately both.<br>
8	As desired materials can be used in advance toothbrush, hence it is more eco<br>
friendly; this advance toothbrush      is based on the philosophy of 'long and<br>
continuous use' and not on 'use and throw'. Its outer and inner parts can be<br>
dismantled, maintained and replaced.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Advance toothbrush is very much different from existing toothbrushes especially from handle. This toothbrush can be held like in conventional toothbrush from its handle, peculiarity of handle being empty from inside and being capable of being filled with toothpaste. During use a knob which is at one end of the handle when rotated in a particular direction, the inside placed piston will push toothpaste (this is in concurrence with injection working), toothpaste ejects out of T portions of toothbrush after passing through a hollow portion of the tube.<br>
A threaded rod is attached to above-mentioned knob; this rod infact converts rotary<br>
motion provided into reciprocating motion of the piston, the piston being integrally fixed<br>
to said rod.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
.An advanced toothbrush comprising: pipe shaped hollow handle having front and<br>
rear ends; said rear end being open and threaded from outside and front end having<br>
reduced conical diameter and threaded from inside;<br>
said rear end having a removable cover M; said cover M being threaded from inside<br>
and removably attached to rear-end C; said pipe shaped hollow handle having a<br>
threaded rod I passing through a piston K and said cover M;<br>
said piston    is in transition fit with pipe shaped hollow handle so that    it can<br>
reciprocate;<br>
one end of said threaded rod being supported in a partition (E) having plurality of<br>
holes(F); and other end of said rod is fixed to a rotatable knob at the other end such<br>
that the piston is reciprocable in the hollow handle on rotation of said knob (H);<br>
said front end is detachably attached to a brush R having a hollow tubing S extending through the bristles of said brush<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Further features &amp;advantages of the invention become clear from the following description &amp;drawings Fig.l: Perspective view, showing advance toothbrush in full detail<br><br>
Detailed description:<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to the non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Handle of advance toothbrush is made hollow. This handle can be made from any material either metal or plastic or using combination of both materials; can be made in many shapes viz. round, elliptical, triangular, rectangular, square, hexagonal, octagonal. It can be made from similar and dissimilar from inside and outside. The handle (A) is having two ends, front end (B) can be attached to detachable brush (R) and from front end toothpaste can be filled inside advance toothbrush. At front end handle is tapered inwards so that front face is of small diameter and this small diameter face i.e. face B has threads on its inner sided. Its rear end is made open and is threaded outside. This handle has been provided with lock (O), which can be slide in a slot so as to control rotation of knob (H). This locking arrangement (D) can also be provided by some other suitable locking arrangement. The handle (a) has a stopper placed at front end, which serves as a partition at the front end. A desired number of holes can be made in the partition (E); from these holes of partition toothpaste ejects out and can be supplied to toothbrush through its front end (B). at rear end of toothbrush a knob (H) is fixed and a thin rod, which is threaded throughout its length, is integrally attached to the said knob. The rod is tightened on the knob with the help of a screw (J). This rod (C) has a piston (K) fixed over it, which can reciprocate inside said hollow pipe with the help of threads. Pistons dimensions provide a transition fit to hollow handle. The hollow handle at its rear end has a cover (M). whose threads are inwards. This cover M can also be tightened at end c with the help of a special clip or any other suitable technique can also be used for tightening cover with rear end(C) of hollow pipe. For example in one of another embodiment this cover will not have threads at periphery then it can be tightened with a clip at rear<br><br>
end(C). The rod (I) can be fixed over cover M with the help of a special bush and nut. This threaded rod at the front end of hollow pipe at the partition (E) will be rotatable w.r.t center (G) of the partition and this portion of rod (G) is without threads and this hole can act as a bush for rod (I).<br>
The hollow pipe handle can be attached with detachable brush (R). The detached brush can be tightened with the outer threads on detachable brush (R) and inner threads on hollow pipe (B). One rubber seal (P) can also be placed between two threaded parts, so that no leakage occurs. This detachable brush ® is made up of an annular pipe. The inside pipe (S) will carry the toothbrush as supplied from hollow handle due to pressure building&amp; this inside pipe (S) can be made from rubber or plastics and it will have openings (T) at the outer surface of the brush and number of openings can be as many as desired.<br>
It will be evident to those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the details of the foregoing illustrated embodiments and that the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
