				<td>Receiving-Silo (busker) and/or filtering devtce for combustible dusty material<br>
The invention pertains to a receiving Silo and/or a filtering device for combustible dusty materials of the nature indicated in the specification of the patent.<br>
Pressure releasing devices in form of explosion doors (bleeder valve) or rupture or safety discs are inserted everywhere there, where combustible dusty material are stored (Silos, bunker etc.) or are moved around (filtering equipment). They should, in case of developing explosions, release the container and the housing from pressure and protect them from damages in this manner.<br>
In case of similar filtering devices the combustible dusty materials are sucked and pressed with the help of under-pressure (vacuum) (or with toe help of over pressure) in the filter container, the air tratrsporting the dusty materials (for exssple coal dust) exits then through filter elements whereas the dust deposits as rllter cakes at the filter elements and is removed from time to time with the help of the freely blowing equipment or similar things from the filter elements and is conveyed in a Silo.<br><br>
In case of large filter devices with explosion-protection the filter<br><br>
   devices    conventionally     consist    of    filter-containers    and    housings<br>
 in   rectangular   form,    which   both   in   the   roofing   range   as   well   as<br>
laterally are  equipped  with  explosion doors  contiguous  to  (bordering<br>
on)    the   filter   elements.    These   known   filtering   devices   are   very<br>
Contd........P/2.<br><br>
:: 2 ::<br>
expensive, since they on the one hand on the ground of the poor resistance to pressure thrust from rectangular housings require appropriate housing wall thickness and on other hand require a multitude of explosion doors (bleeder valves).<br>
Moreover, filtering devices are also known, which consist of a container with round cross section, which is attached directly on a bunker (bunker attachment filter). These containers themselves are, however, not equipped with pressure releasing devices, but the bunker prevailing there-under. Alternately, such container can be designed also for the maximum pressure and do not display any releasing or discharging devices.<br>
The task of the invetion is, therefore, to further develop to such an extent a silo and a filtering device according to kind (class), that it is suitable with maximum low construction cost to absorb the developing mechanical requirements and guarantee simultaneously a safe pressure release.<br>
The problem is solved in case of a filtering device of the nature indicated in the introduction thereby, that at least one pressure releasing element is attached in the container cover, specially in the middle range, where the container space underneath of at least one pressure releasing element is limited by a tubular element essentially attached vertically in the container, in which the tubular dusty material supply enters.<br>
Contd	P/3.<br><br>
3<br>
A Silo and a similar filtering device, in accordance with the Invention, may be realised with substantially nominal (low) constructive cost and, as a result, expenditure since, at first, on the ground of the round container-cross-section and thereby of the conditioned conductive container resistance properties only relatively low container wall thickness are required.<br>
Besides that, the filtering device is provided with an effective, but similarly low expensive pressure releasing device, since, other than in case of known filtering devices of comparable capacity with rectangular form the at least one pressure releasing element must be attached only in the cover range of the container, however, additional pressure releasing devices at the container lateral walls are dispensible (needless). This is possible, therefore, since the dusty material is supplied (led) in the required special manner, so that in case of any pressure thrusts the dusty material aimed directly in direction at the least to a pressure releasing element is led and do not arrive any more in the range of the filter element, so that a safe decoupling is guaranteed.<br>
In order to utilise the space of the container optimally it is advantageously provided, that the filter elements are attached in the range between tubular (the pipe shaped) element and the container outer wall.<br>
Moreover, it is advantageously provided, that the container underneath the  range  receiving  the  filter  elements  is  developed  in  a<br>
Contd	P/4.<br><br>
•	•  4 •	• <br>
•	•     •	•<br>
funnel-shaped manner. That the dusty material loosened as filter-cake can then be led off especially easily from the filtering device and for example, can be led towards a silo attached subsequently.<br>
In this formation it is preferably provided, that the tubular (pipe shaped) dusty materials supply enters in an inclined manner compared with the vertical in the funnel-shaped range in the container enters and in vertical position lead concentrically in the tubular (pipe shaped) element.<br>
In order to develop the container cover as far as possible material and weight-saving and despite that adequately resistant against pressure thrust, It is provided specially advantageously, that the container cover is developed in sandwich-structured-manner.<br>
For this purpose it is provided in totally specially advantageous development, that the container cover displays a top and a bottom cover layer, which «TP jointed with upwards narrowing funnel shaped cover elements, where the upper and the lower cover layer display in the range of the funnel shaped cover elements recesses (notches), along which the cover layers are connected with the cover elements in a rotating manner.<br>
This development of the container cover offers fully special advantages. On the ground of the sandwich nature of structure there occur only at the lower cover layer of the pressure container compressive stress, whereas the upper cover layer is stressed to traction,<br><br>
:: 5 ::<br>
which is relatively uncritical. The lower cover layer, which must be dimensioned rather thickly on the ground of compressive load application corresponding, there displays, however, only a very small surface, since this is penetrated by the multitude of the funnel-shaped cover elements, that means, only the range between the lower ends of the funnel shaped cover elements opening towards the inside i of the container builds the lower cover layer and i s equipped with relatively small but adequately dimensioned plates or similar things. For the upper cover layer it is possible on the ground of the pure tensile stress, as against that, plates with<br>
:i<br>
essentially smaller wall thickness are used.<br>
Moreover it is provided advantageously that the funnel shaped cover elsaent stretches itself upto beyond the upper cover layer.<br>
A modified execution exists, in accordance with the invention, therein, that in the centre of the cover at similar Silo and filtering dev ices a range na narrowing itself outwards and above, truncated cone shaped, the upper cover layer projecting is provided, which is surrounded by concentric, transversely arranged (tilted) plate bands in such a manner, that a triangular framework develops itself cross<br>
sectionally as sandwich in the cover.<br>
This transversely set (tilted), individual, sandwich forming, truncated cones replacing plate bands result In an optimal power lead into in case of a possible explosion within the containers.<br>
Contd	P/6.<br><br>
:: 6 ::<br>
Thus the power directed outwards against the tilted (transversely set) plate bands raise on the ground of the revolving circular form, the plate bands directed in opposite directions, gyrating, tilted (transversely set) can further lead and compensate the power exercised on it optimally, in the same manner.<br>
Further developments, in accordance with the invention, exist therein, that the cover is equipped with a vertical, straight outer border wall and/or that at the outer border wall a the upper cover layer extending outwards, rotating and a right-angle-triangle building plate band is attached.<br>
With the later development it is possible to continue with the sandwich construction practically above the silo and filter border, which is especially then appropriate, when the devices are comparatively small in diameter and similarly revolving recconnsissance herder or working platform should be arranged, which then can be made available in the cover range through enlargement.<br>
The centric, truncated cone encircled by the plate bands carry, for<br>
example, the above mentioned explosion doors (bleeder valve), it<br>
can also in case of other formation, carry somehow of a little other<br>
silo formation, a filtering head. If latter is the case, It can be<br>
appropriate, to arrange the explosion door	eceentrically<br>
at the cover, as this is provided in the Invention in further developments, similarly.<br>

A filtering device in accordance with the Invention, for combustible dusty materials is indicated, in general, with 1 in the drawing. This filtering device 1 displays at first a container 2 with a round<br>
Contd	P/8.<br><br>
::  8  ::<br>
cross     section.     The     diameter     of     such     a     container    2     can     lie, examplewlse,   in the order of magnitude from 5  to  10m.<br>
In the cylindrical container 2 a vertically stretched pipe-shaped element 3 is attached centrally, which is fixed to upper side at the container cover indicated, in general, with 4. At a (perforated) floor (attachment) 5 in the range between the pipe-shaped elements 3 and the container-outer-wall a multitude of pipe shaped filter elements are attached in a hanging manner (suspended), as these are known, underneath the filter element 6 the container 2 is developed in a funnel shaped manner, this funnel shaped range is indicated with the reference digit 2a. The bottom end of the funnel-shaped range 2a builds a dusty material supply 7, on whose development it does not depend in particular that the dusty material can be led into (supplied)  from here,  for example,  to a silo or similar things.<br>
Towards supply of the dusty material in the filtering device 1 preferably with the help of air (vacuum suction), a pipe-shaped (tubular) dusty material supply is provided, which enters centrally in the pipe-shaped element 3 in the container 2. This pipe-shaped dusty material supply displays a first range 8, which inclined opposite to the vertical in the funnel shaped range 2a of the container 2 enters in this and penetrates the container wall and continues itself in a vertically stretched range 9, which is led centrally in the pipe-shaped range 3.<br>
On the ground of this formation there enters the dusty, material led under  under-pressure   (vacuum)   through   the  dusty material   supply  8,9<br>

in the direction of the arrow head 10 at first from the end of the dusty material supply 9 in the tubular (pipe shaped) element 3 and is there diverted in the direction of the arrowhead no. 10, since the pipe-shaped (tubular) element 3 is locked (closed) laterally and upwards. The further flow follows then in the direction of the arrow head no.11 to the filter element 6, where the dusty material collects itself as filter cake at the filter outer sides, whereas the transporting air enters in the filter element 6 and is carried away in the usual manner.<br>
In order to loosen the product, that means, the dusty materials, as filter cakes from the filter elements 6, a multitude of compressed air supplies 12 are provided In an as such known manner, at the container outer side through the circumference of the container 2 in a divided manner with which it is possible to loosen the filter cakes from the filter elements 6, upon which this then exits in the funnel-shaped range 2a of the container and as product can be 1 ed off through the dusty material exhaust 7. Externally at the container 2 in the range of this compressed air supplies 12 also a rotating operating platform 13 can be provided.<br>
Essentially for the filtering device 1, in accordance with the invention is, beyond that, the formation of the container cover 4, which is developed fully specially preferred in the sandwich nature of construction. For this purpose the container cover 4 displays an upper cover layer 14 and a lower cover layer 15, which themselves<br>
Contd	P/10.<br><br>
•• 10 ••<br>
••      •• <br>
are jointed with one another upwards narrowing funnel-shaped cover elements 16. There the externally closed (reference digit 16a) build the cover elements 16 a part of the cover wall, that means, that the upper and the lower cover layer 14, 15 display recesses (notches), along whose the cover layers 14, 15 are connected in a rotary manner with the funnel-shapped cover elements 16.<br>
Since the funnel-shaped cover elements 16 narrow themselves upwards, their lower range is surfacewise very large, that means,, the recesses 15a of the lower cover layer 15 take a large part of the surface of the cover layer 15, so that the actual cover layer 15 takes only a small surface between the funnel-shaped cover elements 16. Since the lower cover layer 15 can absorb essentially the pressure stresses and therefore must have considerable wall thickness, tots formation is specially advantageous, since the lower cover layer 15 has only a small surface, that means only a small surface between the lower ends of the cover element 16 must be accordingly and adequately dimensioned, which can happen in a simple manner, for example* from small plate pieces, which can be welded with the lower border of the cover elements 16.<br>
The upper cover layer 14 displays, in fact, between the recesses for the cover element 16 a larger surface than the lower cover layer 15, it can, however, be dimensioned from plates of smaller wall thickness, since it must be able to absorb essentially only the tensile  stresses.  As a  result,  a specially advantageous cover<br>
Contd	P/ll-<br><br>
development of the filtering device 1 is readily available, which on the ground of its sandwich construction with the additional funnel-shaped cover elements 15 with extraordinary physical properties requires only a small weight and a relatively small material application. The container cover of a dirt diversion 18 is surrounded at the upper side.<br>
Of further essential advantage of this cover formation of the container 2 is, that in the same manner in the centre of the container 2 above the tubular (pipe shaped) element 3, a preferably two or more pressure discharging elements can be attached in form of explosion doors, these are indicated with 17 and is integrated in the sandwich roof construction of the container cover 4. These explosion doors 17 are only necessary in the range of the tubular (pipe shaped) element 3, and, intact, on the ground of the formation of the dusty material supply 8,9 and of the tubular (pipe shaped) element 3* If there enters naaely a pressure and/or flame thrust in the dusty material, then on the ground of the formation of this exclusively in the direction of the arrow head 19 from the dusty<br>
material supply 9 discharge and in the range of the tubular (pipe<br>
flowing in<br>
shaped) element 3 above enter and axrive then, without/any further ranges of the container 2 to flow, direct to the explosion door 17 prevailing thereon, which take care adequately of opening and for the pressure discharge.<br>
In figure 4 in enlarged representation the attachment of the perforated floor attachment 5 is shown, in which the not represented<br>
Contd	P/12.<br><br>
:: 12 ::<br>
filter element are restored. The floor 5 lies outside on a rotating collar 20 of the container outer wall, which serves simultaneously as stiffeaing of the container 2, and Inside on a rotating collar 21 of the tubular element 3. Above these collars 20, 21 at the container outer wall as well as at the tubular element distanced from one another mounting angles 22, 23 are attached. In case of floor 5 lying on the collars 20, 21 these can be fastened by driving In of wedge fillet 24 between the mounting angles 22, 23 and the floor 5. Additionally the floor 5 is suspended In Its middle range with flexible wires 25, in order to avoid a sag (sagging, slack), these ropes 25 are fastened at another end at tubular element 3. If there develops in the container 2 a pressure wave upwards, then it is possible to detach easily the floor 5 front its anchorage and raise upwards, without that larger damages take place.<br>
Corresponding cover formations according to the earlier description follow from the figures 5 to 7 where the figure 5 is also called sire representation of a cover essentially according to the control fig.2, however, with a concentric, upwards protliberated (turned upside down) (reverse dram) cylindrical cone shaped, attachment 26, which is attached to the corresponding mounting collar.<br>
A somehow another changed execution of the container cover show the figure 8 and 9, here the container cover, Is Indicated in general with 4a. The essential difference as opposed to the form of execution according to 2 and 5 to 7 exist therein that here the cover 4a of the container 2 achieves its sandwich construction thereby, that around central cylindrical pin. Indicated with 26a concentrically,<br><br>
••  13 •• <br>
••     •• <br>
tilted, rotating plates 28, 29, if necessary, a plate band 30 extending the cover 4a outwards and further rotating are provided, which in case of necessity, can be provided with reinforcing elements, where the top outer wall of the cover 4a is built from the circulating vertical border plate 31.<br>
The central truncated cone 26s can carry, reeognisably, a filter and a filter candle, indicated in general with 32 or also one or several explosion doors, where in the represented example according to figure 8 the explosion door indicated with 17a is attached eccentrically on a pipe 33 at the cover 4a.<br>
The rotating plates 28 to 30 build around the central truncated cone 26 cross sectionally a frame work like construction, but without any beam (bearer) and without bottom cover layer 15, wherefrom it results, that somehow the pressure brought over the plate 29, during an inner explosion in the silo 2 raise itself reciprocally because of the rotating form of the plate or of the rotating arrangement. If a space is required for operating personnel and if the cover surface is too small, the cover can be extended outwards, this happens again with a rotating plate 30, which receives a partial range of the upper plate. This range is indicated in figure 8 with 34, a handrail or a rotating grid is indicated and carries the reference digit 35.<br>
