				<td>The present invention relates to a novel process for the conversion of steroidal carboxylic acids to carbothioate derivatives such as fluticasone propionate via novel intermediates.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In the preparation of 17ß-carbothioic acids, salphur has generally been introduced under anhydrous conditions; either by the use of hydrogensulfide (US4335121, US4578221) or by employing the salt of hydrogensulfide, generated in situ from the reaction between sodium hydride and hydrogensulfide (US4188385, US4335121, US4578221).<br>
In US2002/0133032 Abbott claim a process towards fluticasone propionate starting from flumethasone. The process consists of 5 steps, of which the final two can be performed as a one-pot reaction, and the product is obtained in an overall yield of 51 %. Abbott also claims that a 6a-chloro-9a-fluoro-impurity present in commercial grade flumethasone necessitates an elaborate purification of flumethasone prior to use.<br>
In the preparation of fluticasone propionate, the introduction of the CH2F-moiety has been accomplished by the reaction of the carbothioic metal salt with a dihalomethane derivative, preferably a fluorohalomethane. Glaxo first made use of bromochloromethane, followed by halogen exchanges (US4335121). They later moved on to bromofluoromethane (W002088I67, W002100879, W00212265, W00212266), first mentioned by PhilUps etal. (J. Med. Chem., 1994, 37,3717-3729). The Israeli company Chemagis (IL109656) utilised both bromo- and chlorofluoromethane. Chlorofluoromethane was later used by Abbott as well (US2002/0133032).<br>
Summary of invention;<br>
The problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide a new method for the preparation of steroidal carbothioic acid and derivatives thereof such as fluticasone propionate, especially a method in which a number of the relevant method steps may be performed as a continuous one-pot synthesis. This denotes a method where relevant synthetic steps may be performed in situ without change of solvent or isolation of the individual intermediates.<br>
The present invention provides a method which comprises A) reacting a steroidal carboxylic acid or a salt thereof with a coupling agent alone or in conjunction with a coupling enhancer, and B) reacting the product of step A) with a nucleophilic agent comprising a sulfur atom.<br><br>
The solution is based on the identification by the present inventors that by employing novel in situ generated esters, such as 17ß-carboxy- imidazoryl-, succinimidyl- or triazolyl esters of formula (III), as intermediates, an increased threshold against competing hydrolysis reactions was achieved. The reduced level of hydrolysis further raises the efficiency regarding the formation of the end steroidal carbothioate product and removes the need to work under strictly anhydrous conditions. The preferred steroidal carbothioate end products are defined by formula (I) herein. When RIO of formula (I) is a fluoromethyl group this represents fluticasone propionate.<br>
The intermediate (such as an ester of formula (III)) is very suitable for use in a method for the conversion of a steroidal carboxylic acid to a steroidal carbothioic acid or a carbothioate. As explained above, an advantage of the method described herein relates to the possibility of performing relevant method steps in situ.<br>
The increased stability of the intermediates (such as compounds of formula (III)) against competing hydrolysis reactions, removes the need to work under anhydrous conditions. This makes it possible to avoid the use of hydrogensulfide gas, allowing instead the use of hydrosulfide salts, either as solids with crystal water or as solutions of the desired sulfide salt in water. Further it sets the stage for an in situ process where relevant steps may be performed in one-pot The present invention also discloses a novel process for the preparation of e.g. fluticasone propionate. By employing the method described herein, three out of five steps may be performed in one-pot, thus yielding fluticasone propionate in an overall yield of 89% (see example 3 herein).<br>
Coupling agents and enhancers have primarily been used in peptide chemistry where the need to activate carboxylic acids in order to facilitate peptide couplings has been recognized for decades (Handbook of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Activating Agents and Protecting Groups, ed. A. J. Pearson and W.R. Roush, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999).<br>
Within the field of steroids the use of coupling agents have also found use, especially in the preparation of carbothioic acids and esters of the androstane series (e.g. US4188385, US4198403, US4335121)). However, in these cases coupling enhancers were not used, and as a result some of the activated intermediates suffered the disadvantage of being prone to competing reactions, e.g. hydrolysis, resulting in a reduced yield of the final product. In US6197761, Glaxo made use of coupling enhancers. In example 16, a novel oxo-tetra-hydrofuranoyl amide was prepared by activating the androstane 17ß-carboxylic acid with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in conjunction with l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-amuiopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). However, it is not<br>
disclosed in this reference that the carbothioic acid can be obtained by adding a nucleophilic agent to an activated carboxylic group.<br>

The method as described herein relates in a presently preferred embodiment to the conversion of androstane 17ß-carboxylic acids to 17ß-carbothioates such as e.g. fluticasone propionate via novel in situ activated 17ß-carboxylic acid intermediates. In a preferred embodiment of the method the 17ß-carbothioic esters are prepared by reacting an acid of formula (II) with a coupling agent in conjunction with a coupling enhancer. The terms "coupling agent' and "coupling enhancer" are herein used to refer to chemical reagents that facilitate the formation of a reactive intermediate of<br>
formula (III) where Z represent a group with the structural formula (D) or formula (E). Such intermediates may be formed between androstane I7ß-carboxylic acids and a carbodiimide derivative such as l-ethyl-3-ß-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (a preferred example of a coupling agent) in combination with suitable coupling enhancers. Suitable coupling enhancers as used herein can for example be represented by the structures of formula (D) and formula (E) as described above.<br>
The coupling agent and the optional coupling enhancers are preferably water-soluble so the reactions could be effected in aqueous solutions if preferred.<br>
Presently considered the best mode of the invention:<br>
Compounds of formula (III) as defined hereinbefore may be prepared by treating a compound of formula (II) with EDC in combination with a compound of formula (D). The resulting 17ß-carboxy tmidazolyl ester, which may be isolated if required, is treated with a nucleophilic agent (a sulfur source) that displaces the active ester group to form a compound of formula (IV), In one embodiment of the invention R9 may represent optionally substituted C1-6 alkyl groups like e.g. methyl, ethyl or a isopropyl group (preferably substituted with a halogen atom), or a 5-6 membered heterocyclic ring containing either oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur, the said heterocyclic ring being optionally substituted by a oxo group on either of the ring carbons. Compounds of formula (IV) may readily be isolated. la another embodiment of the mvention, R9 represent a hydrogen atom or a salt. Preferred examples of salts include alkali metal salts; e.g. Li, N~a or K, alkaline earth metal salts; e.g. Ca or Mg, tertiary amine salts; e.g. pyridurium, triethylammonium or diisopropylethylamine salt, or quaternary ammonium salts; e.g. tetrabutylammonium salt. Such compounds of formula (IV) may be isolated if necessary. Subsequent addition of an electrophilic agent leads to the formation of compounds of formula (I) as depicted hi scheme 1, wherein R10 is a C1-6 haloalkyl, a fluoro-, chloro-, or bromomethyl group, a diffuoromethyl or a trifluoromethyl group, or a 2-fluoroethyl group.<br>
Preferably the nucleophilio agent is a hydrogen sulfide or a salt thereof or more preferably a hydrated sulfide salt such as sodium hydrosulftde hydrate.<br>
Preferably the electrophilic agent is chlorofluoromethane or more preferably bromofluoromethane.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present method, compounds of formula (III) as defined hereinbefore may be prepared by treating a compound of formula (II) with EDC in combination with a compound of formula (E). The resulting l7ß-carboxy succmimidyl ester which may be<br>
isolated if required is treated with a nucleophilic agent that displaces the active ester group to form a. compound of formula (IV) as defined hereinbefore. Subsequent addition of a electrophilic agent conclude tine synthesis towards compounds of formula CO as depicted in scheme 1, wherein R10 is a C1-6 haloalkyl, a fluoro-, chloro-, or bromomethyl group, a difluoromethyl or a trifluorometliyl group, or a 2-fluoroetiiyl group. The formation of compounds of formula (I) may take place hi a one-pot reaction starting with compounds of formula (II) without isolation of the intermediates of formula (III) and (IV) if e.g. sodium hydrosulfide hydrate is used as the nucleophilic agent.<br>
The use of a coupling enhancer in combination with a carbodiimide forms an active ester intermediate of formula (III) with increased stability and reactivity. These intermediates have an increased threshold against competing hydrolysis reactions. The reduced level of hydrolysis raises the efficiency regarding the formation of products of formula (I) (scheme 1, see below) where RIO is defined as hereinbefore.<br>
Surprisingly, we have found that the use of these novel I7ß-carboxy succinimidyl- and 17)3-carboxy imidazolyl esters of formula (III) reduce the cycle time, increase the yield and enhance the purity of the final product of formula (I).<br>
