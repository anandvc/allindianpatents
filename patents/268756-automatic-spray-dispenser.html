figure 4.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring to figure 1, the housing 1 has a first part substantially in the form of a back plate 2, and a second part in the form of a front cover 3.  As shown, the<br><br>
cover -3 has an aperture 4 to enable release of a spray material when the housing is in use. The aperture 4 is preferably of sufficient dimensions to enable the spray material to pass therethrough without contacting the .housing 1. This is desirable so that the spray material does not, over time, stain, corrode, or otherwise adversely effect the housing 1. The housing 1 is adapted to receive and hold the spray dispenser 5 which is shown in figure 2.<br>
Referring to figure 2, the spray dispenser 5 has a spray emitting portion in the form of a spray head 6, and also has a spray material storage portion in the form of a canister 7 of a substantially cylindrical shape. The spray head 6 and the canister 7 are preferably detachable so that when spray material within the canister 7 is exhausted the canister 7 can be replaced with a new one. The spray head 6 has a switch 8 which can be activated to render the spray dispenser 5 operational. When the spray dispenser 5 is operational the spray head 6 receives a supply of spray material from the canister 7, and releases it as a horizontal spray from an outwardly protruding nozzle 9. As shown, the nozzle 9 may incorporate a short length of tubing 9a for releasing the spray. In other embodiments of the invention the arrangement may be such that the spray is vertical rather than horizontal. When the spray dispenser 5 is fitted to the housing 1 the nozzle 9 is aligned with the housing's aperture 4 so that the spray material can spray outwards of the housing 1 without obstruction by the housing.<br>
The spray head 6 is preferably capable of automatically dispensing periodic metered doses of the spray material as a spray (eg a mist) into the atmosphere surrounding the housing 1. The spray head 6 may have a battery or other<br><br>
power source to energise its internal components. The internal components may include a solenoid valve (not shown) to regulate the flow of spray material from the canister 7 to the spray head 6, and electronics to regulate the opening<br>
and closing of the valve in terms of timing and quantity of release of the spray<br>
» material.  The electronics may be arranged such that the spray dispenser 5 will<br>
shut down after a predetermined time - ie so that it does not run continuously at times when it is not needed. Preferably the spray dispenser 5 can also be shut down manually. Optionally the spray head 6 may be programmable to influence the working of the electronics.<br>
Referring to .figure 3, the back plate 2 may be secured to a wall in an elevated position. As shown, the back plate 2 has a looped portion 10 (eg a partial or complete ring) for receiving a hook 11, the hook 11 forming part of the spray dispenser 5. The hook is shown in more detail at figure 2b. The back plate 2 also has a protruding stabilizer 12 positioned below and spaced from the looped portion 10. When the spray dispenser 5 is fitted to the housing 1 the hook 11 is hooked into the looped portion 10. The lower part of the spray dispenser 5 butts freely against the stabilizer 12 to maintain the spray dispenser 5 in a substantially vertical orientation. The cover 3 can then be clipped or otherwise fastened to the back plate 2 to substantially encapsulate the spray dispenser 5. If desired, the spray dispenser 5 can be removed from the housing and used independently of the housing.<br>
The housing 1 and the spray dispenser 5, when fitted together, may be secured in an elevated fashion against an inside or outside wall of a building. The spray head 6 can then be set to deliver a spray into the surrounding atmosphere as<br><br>
desired. The spray may be of an aerosol type, and may be an insecticide for killing or repelling insects, a perfume, an odor neutraliser, a medicine, or essentially any other suitable substance. In some embodiments of the invention the spray may even be a non-visible gaseous material, and thus the term "spray" as used herein should be interpreted broadly to include this possibility. In some embodiments of the invention the spray dispenser 5 may be adapted to release a spray of more than one substance, each substance being sprayed either simultaneously or consecutively.<br>
Preferably the housing 1 substantially hides the spray dispenser 5 from view when in use, except that the nozzle 9, or a part thereof, may be visible. In some cases the switch 8 may be accessible from outside of the housing 1. The housing 1 cap. also be locked so that the spray dispenser 5 cannot be removed and/or readily damaged by unauthorised people.<br>
The housing 1 may be formed or coloured (eg by painting) to match the decor of the building with which it is used. Preferably the housing 1 is portable, and is such that it can be secured to (eg by way of screws or the like) and subsequently removed from the building when it is desired to use it elsewhere.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention the housing 1 may have a door to enable access to the spray dispenser 5. The housing 1 may be formed from a plastic, metallic, wooden, or any other suitable material. In some cases the spray dispenser 5 may be powered by a DC supply via a transformer connected the building's main supply.<br><br>
An advants-30 of. the invention as described with reference to the accompanying drawings is that the spray dispenser can be readily removed from the housing 1. The spray dispenser 5, or a part thereof, is thus not integral with the housing 1.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention the housing for the spray dispenser may be used with a recess in a wall. The spray dispenser can thus at least partially fit within the recess and be substantially hidden from view by way of the front cover. The front cover may or may not be flush will the wall's outer surface.<br>
Referring to figure 4, there is shown an alternative spray dispenser and'housing combination. In this alternative arrangement the spray dispenser 13 has a spray head 14 and a spray material containing canister 15 (only part of which is shown). The canister 15 can be screw fitted to the spray head 14, and subsequently removed and replaced when the spray material has been exhausted. The housing 16 for the spray dispenser 13 includes a back plate 17 having a pair of horizontally spaced upwardly projecting hooks 18 (only one or which is shown). When in use, the plate 17 is fastened in an elevated position, for example to a wall. •<br>
Referring to figure 5, the spray dispenser 13 includes a bracket 19 having a vertically oriented aperture 20 and one horizontally oriented aperture 21. The bracket 19 is formed such that it can hang on the back plate 17 by hooking the upwardly projecting hooks 18 through the vertically oriented aperture 20. As shown, the horizontally oriented aperture 21 of the bracket 19 is formed within a shelf 22 of the bracket 19. The spray head 14 can be arranged on the shelf<br><br>
22 such that a downward fitting 14a (see figure 4) of the spray head 14 protrudes through the horizontally oriented aperture 21.- The canister 15 can then be screw fitted to the downward fitting of the spray head 14 to maintain the bracket in tight combination with the rest of the spray dispenser 13. The housing 16 has a front cover which can be detachabfy fitted to the backing plate 17 to substantially conceal the^spray dispenser 13. The spray dispenser 13 can be removed from the housing 16 by removing the front cover of the housing 16 and unhooking it from the hooks 18 of the backing plate. The spray head 14 and the canister 15 can subsequently be unscrewed from one another to fit a new canister, etc.<br>
With further reference to figure 4, the spray dispenser 13 can emit a spray through an outward aperture 23 in the front cover of the housing 16. The spray head 14 is preferably near enough to the aperture 22 to enable the spray to pass therethrough without contacting the face of the front cover of the housing 16. This is facilitated by the front cover recessing back towards the spray head 14 as indicated at 24. The arrangement ensures that the spray material does not stain or otherwise undesirably compromise the appearance of the housing 16. Preferably the spray head 14 is sufficiently spaced from the front cover of the housing 16 so that any drips of spray material from the spray head 14 can fall under gravity within the housing - ie so that they do not run down the exterior of the housing 16. The spacing of the spray head 14 from the front cover, and the dimensions of the outward aperture 23, will depend on the shape of the spray which is produced as it leaves the spray head 14.<br>
