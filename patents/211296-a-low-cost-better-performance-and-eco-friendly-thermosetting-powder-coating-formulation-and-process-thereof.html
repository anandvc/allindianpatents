COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
( See Section 10)<br>
1. TITLE OF INVENTION<br><br>
PROCESS OF PREPARATION OF QUINAPRIL HYDROCHLORIDE<br>
2. LUPIN LIMITED, of 159, CST Road, Kalina, Santacruz (East). Mumbai - 400 098, State of Maharashtra, India, an Indian Company.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
PROCESS OF PREPARATION OF NOVEL CRYSTALLINE FORM OF QUINAPRIL HYDROCHLORIDE.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparation of a novel crystalline form of quinapril hydrochloride of formula(I). The present invention further relates to the preparation of amorphous form of quinapril hydrochloride, of high purity and conforming to pharmacopoeia] specifications, by the use of the novel crystalline quinapril hydrochloride as an intermediate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The chemical species, (3S)-2-[(2S)-2-[[(lS)-l-(Ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl]aminoJ-l-oxopropyl]-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-isoquinolinecarboxylic/acid is known generically as quinapril . Its pharmaceutical ly acceptable salts, specially the hydrochloride salt is represented by formula (I).<br><br><br>
HC1     (I)<br><br>
Quinapril hydrochloride (I) and its pharmaceutic ally acceptable salts are active as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and thus are commercially valuable antihypertensive agents.<br>
US Patent No. 4,344,949 (Hoefle et. al.) inter alia describes a process for the preparation of quinapril hydrochloride comprising reaction of ethyl ester of (S,$)-ct-[( 1 -carboxyethyl)amino] phenylbutanoic acid with the benzyl or t-butyl ester of (S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-isoquinoline carboxylic acid in the presence of 1-hydroxy benzotriazole, employing standard peptide bond forming methods.<br>
The benzyl or t-butyl ester group of quinapril thus obtained is removed by catalytic hydrogenation or by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid.  Quinapril hydrochloride is<br><br>
isolated either by solvent precipitation with diethyl ether or by lyophilisation of the aqueous solution.<br>
The above method is summarised in scheme (I).<br><br><br>

(I)<br>
Scheme-I: Synthesis of quinapril hydrochloride as disclosed in US Patent No. 4,344,949<br>
Other methods for preparation of quinapril hydrochloride are disclosed by Barton et. al. in GB Patent No. 2,095,252, by Patchett et. al. in EP Patent No. 0,065,301 etc.<br>
However, all the reported methods for synthesis of quinapril suffer from a serious drawback in that the product obtained by all the methods is invariably contaminated with varying amounts of an impurity identified as the diketopiperazine derivative of formula (II), leading, most often to product not conforming to pharmacopoeial specifications.<br><br><br>
The^diketopiperazine impurity is formed either during removal of the carboxylic acid protective group or it could be formed during drying of quinapril hydrochloride.<br><br>
O	COOC1H5<br>
The above impurity once formed is difficult to remove by conventional separation techniques, including fractional crystallization.<br>
Regulatory authorities all over the world are becoming very stringent about the purity of an approved drug or a drug candidate awaiting approval. Especially there is a growing concern about the nature and level of impurities present in such molecules.<br>
Pharmaceutical manufacturers throughout the world, constantly strive to produce drug molecules that go beyond pharmacopoeial specifications i. e. compounds having extra pharmacopoeial specifications.<br>
US Patent No. 4,761,479 (Goel et. al.) discloses a method wherein quinapril hydrochloride obtained from the reaction mixture is crystallized from a solvent selected from acetonitrile or acetone to give a crystalline form of quinapril hydrochloride possessing a characteristic X-ray (powder) diffraction pattern and high bulk density.<br>
The abovementioned patent also mentions that the crystalline material thus obtained contains equimolar amounts of acetonitrile/acetone as part of the crystal lattice. The patent further mentions that the solvent(s) present in the crystal structure can be removed under vacuum at a temperature of about 50° C. However during this unit operation the crystallinity of the substance is lost due to desolvation during drying, and an amorphous material is obtained which is claimed to be free of impurities, specially the diketopiperazine compound of formula (II).<br>
Even though, the US Patent No. 4,761,479 discloses the use of acetonitrile and acetone for crystallization, the former is preferred since, unlike acetonitrile, acetone cannot be removed from the crystal lattice, even on prolonged drying.<br>

Canadian Application No. CA 12,293,705 Al (Llagostera et. al) describes a process for purification of impure quinapril hydrochloride through a two-step process, comprising first crystallisation of the impure material from toluene followed by another crystallization using a class III solvent as categorized by International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH). The patent also mentions that initially a solvate of quinapril hydrochloride with toluene is formed, which is subsequently substituted by a solvate of the class III solvent used for the second crystallisation. This patent like the aforesaid US Patent No. 4,761,479 also claims that amorphous quinapril hydochloride is obtained on desolvation of the solvate of the material with the class III solvent through drying. Among the class III solvents disclosed, ethyl formate and methyl acetate are the preferred ones.<br>
However, the abovementioned two methods for purification of impure quinapril hydrochloride utilise solvents which have low flash points eg. the flash point of acetonitrile is 2°C, that of methyl acetate is -16° C, whereas that of ethyl formate is -20° C, rendering their use on commercial scale a hazardous proposition. Moreover, the method disclosed in the later patent i. e. Canadian Application No. 2,293,705 Al involves a two-step purification, which makes the entire operation not only time consuming but costly.<br>
The need, therefore, exists for a method for obtaining quinapril hydrochloride of high purity which addresses the shortcomings associated with the prior art methods.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the main aspect of the present invention there is provided a simple, industrial method for preparation of quinapril hydrochloride of high purity.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a simple and industrial method for purification of quinapril hydrochloride comprising crystallisation of impure quinapril hydrochloride from a nitroalkane solvent to give a novel crystalline form of quinapril hydrochloride associated with a solvate of the solvent utilised for crystallisation.<br><br><br>
According to further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for obtaining an amorphous form of quinapril hydrochloride, in high purity, free of impurities and conforming to pharmacopoeial specifications from the novel crystalline form of quinapril hydrochloride associated with the solvate of the nitroalkane solvent.<br>
According to further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for preparation of amorphous form of quinapril hydrochloride, in high purity, free of impurities and conforming to pharmacopoeial specifications comprising removal of the solvent from the novel crystalline form of quinapril hydrochloride associated with the solvate of the nitroalkane solvent by subjecting the said crystalline form to drying under vacuum.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, quinapril hydrochloride can be synthesized by two methods, as summarized in Method-I and Method-II.<br>
Method-I:<br>
The first step of Method-I consists of condensation of N-[l(S)-carboethoxy-3-phenylpropyl]-(S)-alanine (III) with the para-toluene sulfonate salt of the benzyl ester of (S)-l,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (IV) to give the benzyl ester of (S, S, S)-2-{2-{(l-ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl)amino]-l-oxopropyl]-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-isoquinoline carboxylic acid or quinapril benzyl ester which is isolated as the maleic acid salt (V).<br>
Typically, N-[l(S)-carboethoxy-3-phenylpropyl]-(S)-alanme (III) is converted into its acid chloride by reacting with either PCI5 or PCI3 or SOCI2, but preferably with PCI5 in a non-polar or polar solvent, such as those selected from chlorinated hydrocarbons like dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane; aromatic hydrocarbons like toluene, xylene or aliphatic hydrocarbons like hexane, heptane etc. A non-polar solvent is preferred as the acid chloride precipitates out from such solvents and can be easily isolated by filtration.<br>

Method-I: Preparation of quinapril hydrochloride<br>
The acid chloride is prepared by treating the acid (III) with PC15, using hexane as a solvent, the molar ratio of PCI5 used being in the range of 0.9 moles to 1.5 moles, but preferably in the range of 1.0 mole to 1.2 moles.<br>
The reaction temperature employed can be between -5 to +15° C and for a period of time between 2-5hrs, but preferably the temperature is in the range of 0-10° C and reaction time between 3-4 hours.<br>
The acid chloride thus obtained is then condensed with the free base of the benzyl ester of (S)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (IV). The free base is obtained by treatment of the organic or inorganic acid salt of (S)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-<br>
7<br><br>
carboxylic acid (IV) with an organic or inorganic base like trialkyl amine, alkali hydroxide etc.<br>
Preparation of compound (V) is then effected in chlorinated solvents like dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform etc comprising by addition of the acid chloride of compound (III) to the solution of compound (IV) in the presence of an organic base, such as selected from tri ethyl amine, diethylamine, tertiary butylamine, and dicyclohexylamine at temperatures ranging from -30° C to 0° C, but preferably at -15 to-20° C and subsequently raising the temperature in the range of 10-40° C, but preferably 20-30° C. The compound (V) is isolated by washing the organic layer with water and formation of its salt with an organic or an inorganic acid.<br>
In a specific embodiment, a solution of the acid (III) in hexane is reacted with stoichiometric amounts of phosphorous pentachloride at a temperature between 0-10°C, with agitation for 3 hrs. The acid chloride thus formed is isolated by filtration.<br>
A solution of the acid chloride thus obtained is dissolved in dichloromethane and added to the free base of compound (IV). The free base of (IV) is obtained by treating the corresponding p-toluenesulfonate salt with an equimolar amount of organic base, like triethyl amine.<br>
The condensation between the free base of compound (IV) and the acid chloride of compound (III) is carried out in a chlorinated solvent eg. dichloromethane. The acid chloride is added to the free base at -15° C in the presence of an equimolar amount of an organic base eg. triethyl amine The reaction is then carried forward to completion at room temperature by agitating for a period ranging from 30 to 90 minutes. The reaction mixture is worked up by successively washing the reaction mixture with hydrochloric acid, followed by water and finally with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution.<br>
Quinapril benzyl ester thus obtained is isolated as its maleate salt by treating the quinapril benzyl ester with maleic acid at room temperature in a alkyl acetate solvent, preferably ethyl acetate.<br><br><br>
The second step comprises hydrogenolysis of quinapril benzyl ester maleate salt (V) thus obtained in the presence of Pd/C catalyst and concentrated hydrochloric acid.<br>
The hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ester (V) can be carried out in an alcoholic solvent, such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol in presence of concentrated hydrochloric acid or a solution of hydrogen chloride in the same alcohol, with hydrogen gas at a pressure ranging between 10-70 psi and at a temperature between 10-40° C.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the hydrogenolysis reaction is carried out on the free base of quinapril benzyl ester (V), which in turn is obtained from the maleate salt (V) by treatment with aqueous ammonia at slightly alkaline pH of 7.5-8.5. Hydrogenolysis is carried out using ethanol as a solvent and in presence of concentrated hydrochloric acid at a pressure ranging between 40-60 psi and room temperature.<br>
The molar ratio between the benzyl ester of quinapril (V) and hydrochloric acid can be equal or greater than the stoichiometric ratio (larger amount of hydrochloric acid in the reaction mixture leads to increase in the diketopiperazine impurity (II), arising due to cyclisation of quinapril hydrochloride under acidic conditions).<br>
The catalyst is removed by filtration and the filtrate evaporated at low temperature, preferably below 30° C as higher temperature could lead to formation of more amounts of the diketopiperazine impurity (II).<br>
Method-II:<br>
The second method comprises of reacting N [l(S)-carboethoxy-3-phenylpropyl]-(S)-alanyl carboxyanhydride (VI) with the free base of the benzyl ester of (S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (IV).<br>
The free base of (IV) is obtained by treating the organic or inorganic acid salt of (S)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (IV) with an organic or inorganic base like trialkyl amine, alkali hydroxide aqueous ammonia etc in a mixture of water and chlorinated solvents like 1,2-dichloroethane, dichloromethane chloroform etc. The pH of the mixture is adjusted between 8.0 -9.0 at a temperature between -15 to +15°C, but preferably between 0-10°C. The reaction mixture is then stirred at room temperature, for<br>
9<br><br>
15 to 45 minutes, but preferably between 25-35minutes. The organic layer containing the free base is separated.<br><br><br>

Method-II: Preparation of quinapril hydrochloride<br>
The compound, N [l(S)-carboethoxy-3-phenylpropyl]-(S)-alanyl carboxyanhydride (VI) is dissolved in chlorinated solvents like dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane or chloroform, but preferably in dichloromethane at room temperature. This mixture is then added to the free base of (IV) dissolved in dichloromethane, at a temperature between 20 to 45°C, but preferably at 25 to 35°C. The reaction mixture is agitated for a period between 1 to 5 hours, but preferably between 2 to 4 hours for the reaction to go to completion.  A mixture of an aqueous solution of an inorganic base like sodium<br>
10<br><br>
bicarbonate, sodium carbonate and an organic base like triethyl amine, dicyclohexyl amine etc is added to neutralize the reaction mixture. The organic layer is separated and concentrated and the residue is diluted with an alkyl acetate preferably ethyl acetate. The resultant mixture is stirred at a temperature between 30 to 50°C, but preferably between 35 to 45°C. The product is isolated as a maleate salt as described in method -I.<br>
In a specific embodiment, (S)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (IV), is dissolved in a mixture of water and dichloromethane at 5 to 10°C, and treated with aqueous ammonia solution, at the same temperature. The organic layer is separated and treated with N[l(S)-carboethoxy-3-phenylpropyl]-(S)-alanyl carboxyanhydride (VI), dissolved in dichloromethane at 25-3 5°C, the resultant mixture is stirred for 2-4 hours, at the same temperature till the reaction goes to completion. The reaction mixture is then neutralized with a mixture of aqueous sodium carbonate and triethyl amine and stirred for 2-4 hours. The organic layer is separated and concentrated, the residue is diluted with ethyl acetate. The mixture is then treated with a mixture of maleic acid dissolved in ethyl acetate to obtain benzyl quinapril ester as the maleate salt as described in method-I.<br>
The benzyl ester quinapril maleate salt is then converted by catalytic hydogenolysis to quinapril hydrochloride, as in method -I.<br>
The residue of quinapril hydrochloride (I) thus obtained is made anhydrous by addition of dry dichloromethane. The resulting mixture is distilled to remove water as an azeotrope. This procedure is repeated until the moisture content of the mixture is less than 1.0%.<br>
The amount of the diketopiperazine impurity (II) present in the quinapril hydrochloride thus obtained varies between 2.0-5.0% by weight of the quinapril hydrochloride.<br>
Purification of the impure quinapril hydrochloride thus obtained is effected by crystallisation from a nitroalkane solvent from which a crystalline form of quinapril hydrochloride falls out. The nitroalkane solvent is selected from nitromethane, nitroethane, and nitropropane. Among these, nitromethane is preferred since it is less costly and readily available.<br>
11<br><br>
The nitroalkane solvents like acetonitrile belong to Class II solvents as categorised by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH). However, unlike acetonitrile these solvents have higher flash point eg. that of nitromethane being 44° C as compared to 2° C for acetonitrile, -16° C for methyl acetate and -20°C for ethyl formate, rendering them easier and safer to handle during commercial manufacture.<br>
The crystallisation is carried out by addition of the nitroalkane solvent to the anhydrous residue of impure quinapril hydrochloride, obtained as per the method described hereinearher at room temperature. The mixture is stirred for 10-15 minutes to get a clear solution. The solution is seeded with pure quinapril hydrochloride and then cooled to a temperature ranging between -15 to +15° C, preferably in the range of 0 to +10° C and agitated at the same temperature for a period of 1-3 hours, preferably 2.0 hrs, to allow the nitroalkane solvate of quinapril hydrochloride to crystallize out. The crystalline solid is filtered out at room temperature.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the impure quinapril hydrochloride is dissolved in nitromethane at room temperature. The amount of nitromethane used can be between 5-10 times by volume, of the weight of the impure material. The solution is seeded with pure quinapril hydrochloride at same temperature and cooled to 5-10° C. The crystalline solvate is allowed to crystallize out at a temperature between 5-10° C and the crystalline material filtered off at room temperature.<br>
The quinapril hydrochloride to nitroalkane solvate ratio was determined on the basis of 'HNMR &amp; HPLC and was found to be having a equimolar ratio.<br>
These novel crystalline solvates quinapril hydrochloride with the nitroalkane solvents possess distinct X-ray (powder) diffraction patterns and these are summarized in Table-I.<br><br><br>
