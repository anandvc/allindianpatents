COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
A PROCESS FOR PREPARING COMPOSITION SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION OF GASOLINES<br>
BP OIL INTERNATIONAL LIMITED,   a British  company,   of Britannic House, 1 Finsbury Circus, London EC2M 7BA, United Kingdom,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
WO 00/77130<br><br>
PCT/GB00/02282<br><br>
which comprises having present in said gasoline at least 10% of component (a) as defined above.<br>
In a third aspect the present invention provides use in a spark ignition combustion engine of an unleaded gasoline fuel of MON at least 80 which comprises at least 10% of 5      component (a) as defined above to reduce emissions of exhaust gases.<br>
In a fourth aspect the present invention provides an unleaded composition having a Motor Octane Number (MON) of at least 80 comprising at least 2 or at least 5%, in particular at least 10%, such as 5-70% (by volume of the total composition) of component (a), which is a substantially aliphatic hydrocarbon refinery stream, of MON<br>
10      value of at least 85, at least 70% in total of said stream being branched chain alkanes, said stream being obtainable or obtained by distillation from a refinery material as a cut having Initial Boiling Point of at least 15°C and Final Boiling Point of at most 160°C, said Boiling Points being measured according to ASTMD2892, and as component (g) at least 5% of at least one paraffin, aromatic hydrocarbon compound or olefinic<br>
15      hydrocarbon of bp60-160°C, with not more than 5% of the total composition, e.g. less than 1%, of hydrocarbon of bp more than 160°C, especially compounds with at least 2 hydrocarbyl rings such as naphthenes, and preferably less than 5% e.g. less than 4% of triptane or 2,2,3 trimethyl pentane. All boiling points quoted herein are at atmospheric pressure.<br>
20	In a fifth aspect the present invention also provides an unleaded composition<br>
having a Motor Octane Number (MON) of at least 80 comprising at least 5% in particular at least 10%, such as 5-70% (by volume of the total composition) of component (a), which is at least one branched chain alkane of MON value of at least 90 and of boiling point in the range 15-160°C e.g. 15-100°C, said alkane being preferably<br>
25      present in amount of at least 10, 20 or 30% (especially 10-50%) of the total saturated content of said composition, and as component (g) at least 5% of at least one paraffin, aromatic hydrocarbon compound or olefinic hydrocarbon of bp60-160°C, with not more than 5% of the total composition, e.g. less than 3%, of hydrocarbon of bp more than 160°C, especially naphthenes and preferably less than 5% e.g. less than 4% of triptane or<br>
30     223 trimethyl pentane.<br>
In a sixth aspect the present invention provides an unleaded blend composition having a Motor Octane Number (MON) of at least 81 or 85 and Research Octane<br><br>
WO 00/77130<br><br>
PCT/GB00/02282<br><br>
Number (RON) of at least 91 or 94 which comprises component (a) a total of at least 15% by volume of the blend composition of at least one branched chain hydrocarbon, which is an alkane of 8-12 carbon atoms with 3 methyl or ethyl branches (hereinafter called a compound (A)) there being a minimum of at least 10% by volume (of the blend 5    . composition), of at least one individual compound (A) and component (g) at least one liquid hydrocarbon (e.g. paraffin, aromatic hydrocarbon or olefin) or mixture thereof of bp60-160°C having a MON value of at least 70 and RON value of at least 90, the total amount of component (g) being at least 20%, with the preferred proviso that the blend composition contains less than 5% of 223 trimethyl pentane, and especially less than 1 or<br>
10     0.5%, and especially less than 0.5%, in total of 223 trimethyl butane and 223 trimethyl pentane.<br>
In a seventh aspect of the present invention provides an unleaded blend composition of MON value of at least 81 or 85 and RON value of at least 91 or 94 which comprises component (a) as defined in the previous paragraph and as component<br>
15      (g) at least 20% in total of one or more refinery streams (e.g. such as those described<br>
below in relation to any of (b) to (e) below)), such that the blend composition contains in total at least 70% of saturated hydrocarbons.<br>
In the first aspect the substantially aliphatic refinery stream contains at least 90% aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g. at least 95%) and at most 10% in total (e.g. at most 5%) of<br>
20     nonaliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cycloaliphatics e.g. cyclopentane, cyclohexane,<br>
alkenes such as linear or branched, ones e.g. butenes, pentenes, hexenes, heptenes and octenes, and possibly, but preferably not, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene. The MON value of said stream is at least 85, e.g. at least 87, or 90 or 92, in " particular less than 100, e.g. 85-96 or 87-95, such as 87-90 or 90-95. The RON value of<br>
25      said stream may be 0.5-3.5 especially 1.0-3.5 or 0.5-2.5 units above its MON value, such as RON values of 88-98, or 89.5-96. In said stream at least 70% in total are branched chain alkanes, there being 1 or at least 2 e.g. 2-10 of such alkanes; especially present are 2-4 such alkanes, each in amount of at least 10% or especially 20% e.g. 20-60% in said stream. Thus the stream may contain at least 70% isopentane, or at least 10% (e.g. 10-<br>
30     40%) of each of 2,3dimethyl butane (e.g. 20-40%), isopentane, 2,3 dimethyl pentane<br>
(e.g. 20-40%) and 2,4 dimethyl pentane (e.g. 20-40%), or at least 10% (e.g. 10-40%) of each of 2,3 dimethyl butane, 23 and 24 dimethyl pentanes (e.g. 20-40%), and isooctane<br><br>
WO 00/77130<br><br>
PCT/GB00/02282<br><br>
(e.g. 20-40%). Streams containing less than 30% isopentane e.g. 5-25% isopentane may be preferred, especially if the composition contains at least 5% of triptane or 2,2,3 trimethyl pentane. The total of branched chain alkanes in said stream is at least 70% such as 70-85%, the remainder if any being linear alkanes such as n-butane, n-pentane 5      and/or non aliphatics as described above.<br>
The aliphatic refinery stream is usually derived from a refinery material which is an alkane conversion product, made by reacting one or more alkanes or alkenes, e.g. of 3-5 carbon atoms, especially branched compounds, such as reaction of an alkane, and an alkene e.g. isobutane and isobutene. Examples of such a conversion product are<br>
10     alkylates, which may be made by such a reaction. Alkylates are known refinery products, see e.g. Our Industry Petroleum, by British Petroleum Co., London, 4th Ed. Publ. 1970 page 187. Acid catalysts are usually used in such reactions. These may be soluble " catalysts such as protic acids e.g. hydrogen fluoride or sulphuric or phosphoric acids, or insoluble catalysts such as zeolites or heteropoly acids from Mo or W. The alkylates<br>
15     usually have a boiling range with IBP of at least 15°C and FBP in the range 170-210°C, e.g. 175-190 or 185-205°C. The refinery stream foruse in the compositions of the invention is preferably made as a distillation cut frornsaid material e.g. alkylate, the cut being at 15-60 (e.g. 30-60), 60-80, 80-90, 90-95, 95-100, 100-103, 103-106, 106-110, 110-115, 115-125, 125-140 or 140-160°C; a blend of different cuts may be used e.g. 15-<br>
20     60, with at least one of 60-80, 80-90, 90-95 and 95-100 or 60-80 with at least one of 80-90, 90-95, 95-100, 100-103 or 103-106°C or a combination e.g. 80-106 or 90-106°C. Preferably the cut is of product distilled from alkylate over a-temperature range of 15-160° or 15-140°C, especially 15-100 or 30-1000 OR 60-1600C .60-140 e.g. 60-100 or 90-125°C. Cuts with temperatures inThe range15-160°C especially 90-125°C or<br>
25      15-100°C such as 60-100°C have been found to give unleaded gasolines which-on<br>
combustion gave reduced total hydrocarbon emissions and reduced carbon oxide, e.g. CO2 emissions, compared to those from whole alkylate or in particular cuts above 160°C. The cut from alkylate above 160°C can be used in jet fuel, diesel or kerosene, while the cut from alkylate from 160°C or 100°C downwards can be used in gasolines. Cuts of 60-<br>
30      160°C can be used in summer gasolines because of their reduced Reid Vapour Pressure. Cuts below 100°C can also be used to boost the volatility of unleaded gasolines_e.g. to help provide gasolines with % evaporated at 100°C values of at least 46.<br><br>
WO 00/77130<br><br>
PCT/GB00/02282<br><br>
Advantageously the cut has a boiling range of at least part of 90-106°C, e.g. 90-95, 95-1.00, 100-103 or 103-106°C, as these give optimum octane rating coupled with good emissions. These cuts may be used as such in the compositions and gasolines of the invention but may be mixed with at least one cut of higher bp e.g. 106-110, 110-115, 5      115-125 or 125-140°C such as 106-125°C (preferably in proportion of 5:1 to 1:30 or at least one cut of lower bp e.g. 60-80 or 80-90, such as 60-90°C (preferably in proportions of 9:1 to 1:9 such as 5:1-1:1).<br>
Preferably however the cut in at least part of bp 90-106°C is used as sole or main component (a) in the compositions, gasolines and uses of this invention with component<br>
10      (g); these can provide clean high octane unleaded gasolines, in particular ones free of<br>
oxygenate, with RON value of at least 97 and MON value at least 86 with low emissions. Example of such compositions and gasolines are those with RON, 97-99.5 or 97.5-99, MON 86.5-89, RVP 55-65 kPa e.g. 55-60 kPa, % evaporated at 70°C, 12-35%, % evaporated at 100°C 46-62%, % evaporated at 150°C 95-100%, % evaporated at 180°C<br>
15      97.5-100% density 0.715 to 0.74 e.g. 0.72-0.738 kg/1, benzene 0.5-1.5% e.g. 0.5-1%, aromatics 16-28% e.g. 16-23%, olefins 3-14% such as 4-12%. They may be made from mixtures of butane 0 or 0.5-6.6%, full boiling range alkylate 1-25% e.g. 5-20%, light hydrocrackate 0 or 15-25%, full range steam cracked spirit 10-45% naphtha 0 or 0.5-5%, full range catalytically cracked spirit 0 or 1-5% 2,2,4 trimethylpentane 0 or 0.5-25%<br>
20     such as 0.5-5%, and alkylate cut(s) usually in total amount 25-45%. The amounts of the<br>
latter may be cut bp (90-95, 95-100, 100-103, 103-106°C) used alone 25-45%, or blends<br>
of one or more of those cuts 1-40% (in total in overall composition) and 5-40% of cuts<br>
up15- 60,60-80 (especially 3-15%) op 100-1 10,110-150, 115-125(especially 7-40%<br>
          e.g. 7-20%). 25	In addition the remaining cuts i.e. those above and below the 90-106°C cut<br>
especially those boiling in part of the 15-80°C range and those boiling in part of the 106-125°C range, can be combined e.g. in proportion 5:1-1:5, and the combination used as component (a) in composition, gasolines and uses of this invention with component (g); these can provide clean lower octane unleaded gasolines, in particular ones free of<br>
30      oxygenates, with RON values of at least 92 and MON values of at least 80 also with low emissions. Example of such compositions and gasolines made from a blend of high and low bp cuts are those with RON 92-98 e.g. 92-95 or 95-98, MON 80-88 e.g. 80-84 or<br><br>
WO 00/77130<br><br>
CT/GB00/02282<br><br>
84-88, RVP 50-65 kPa e.g. 50-55 or 55-60 kPa, % evaporated at 70°C, 12-35%, % evaporated at 100°C 46-62%, % evaporated at 150°C 94-100%, % evaporated at 180°C 97.5-100%, density 0.715 to 0.74 e.g. 0.72-0.738 kg/1, benzene 0.5-1.5% e.g. 0.5-1%, aromatics 13-28% e.g. 13-20%, olefins 3-14% such as 3-10%. They may be made from 5      mixtures of butane 0 or 0.5-3%, full boiling range alkylate 10-40% e.g. 15-30%, foil range steam cracked spirit 15-50% e.g. 15-35%, naphtha 0 to 10-20%, and alkylate cut(s) usually in total amount 25-45%. The amounts of the latter may be 5-25% (in total of the overall composition) of one or more of cuts of 15-60, 60-80 and 80-90°C and 10-30% in total (of the overall composition) of cuts of 106-110, 110-115, 115-125°C<br>
10      especially 110-125°C.<br>
By this means, substantially all the alkylate can be converted into 2 clean fuel products of higher and lower octane level.<br>
Thus in a further aspect the present invention also provides a process for preparing at least 2 clean compositions suitable for production of gasolines, which comprises<br>
15      fractionating a reaction product comprising a majority of isoalkanes e.g. isomerization or alkylation product e.g. of bp 15-160°C to produce a first cut boiling in at least part of the range 90-106°C, and a second cut boiling at a temperature lower than said first cut and third cut boiling at a temperature above said first cut, blending said first cut as component (a) with component (g) as defined above to produce a first high octane<br>
20     unleaded gasoline composition of RON at least 97 and MON value at least 86 with low emissions on combustion, and incorporating said second and third cuts as component (a) with component (g) as defined above to produce at least one second high octane unleaded gasoline composition of RON at least 92 and MON value at least 80 with low emissions on combustian In both cases these gasolines can be25     need of oxygenate octane booster.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of producing fuels which comprises distilling said reaction product e.g. alkylate to produce a first cut above 160°C and a second cut below 160°C, and mixing said first cut with other liquid hydrocarbon blend ingredients to form a jet fuel, diesel or kerosene, and mixing said second cut with other<br>
30     liquid gasoline blend ingredients to form motor gasoline.<br>
Component (g) present in the compositions of the invention is usually at least one paraffin, aromatic and/or olefinic hydrocarbon of bp less than 160°C. Examples of said<br><br>
WO 00/77130<br><br>
PCT/GB00/02282<br><br>
components are components (b)-(f) below, each of which or 2 or more of which may be present.<br>
In the second aspect of the invention, examples of the branched chain alkane (usually of 4-12 e.g. 4-8 carbons) which is component (a) are iso alkanes of 4-8 carbons, 5      in particular isobutane, isopentane and isooctane, and dimethyl alkanes, such as 2,3-dimethyl butane. The branched chain alkane usually has at least one, preferably two methyl groups on carbon atom 2 in the alkane chain. The branched alkane usually provides at least 30% e.g. 30-80%, such as 50-80% of the total saturated content of the composition or of the total saturated content of the alkylation cut, the remainder being<br>
10      substantially other branched chain alkanes not meeting the specified definition e.g. of bp of 100-160°C, or lower MON value and/or linear hydrocarbons e.g. of 4-8 carbons as described above. Small amounts of cycloalkanes as described above may also be present in the saturate content.<br>
The compositions of the invention usually contain less than 5% triptane or 223<br>
15     trimethyl pentane, especially less than 4.9% or 1%, and in particular are substantially free of triptane and 223 trimethyl pentarie (e.g. with less than 0.5% or 0.1% in total of both if present). However, if desired and especially with cuts boiling above 60°C e.g. 60-160 or 60-100°C, triptane and/or 223 trimethyl pentane may be present in amount of at least 5 or 8% such as 5-20% in the composition.<br>
20	In the composition of the invention, component (g) may be component (b) which is<br>
at least one saturated liquid aliphatic hydrocarbon having 4 to 12, 4-10 such as 5-10 e.g. 5-8 carbon atoms. In another embodiment component (b) is contained in at least one of isomerate, full range alkylate with FBP more than 170°C, straight run gasoline, light reformate, light hydrocrackate and aviation alkylate. Preferably the composition<br>
25      comprises at least one of an olefin (e.g. in amount of 1-30% e.g. 8-18%) and/or at least one aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g. in amount of 1-50%, especially 3-35%) and/or less than 5% of benzene. The composition may preferably comprise 5-40% component (a), less than 1% benzene and have a Reid Vapour Pressure at 37.8°C measured according to ASTMD323 of 30-120kPa. .The composition is usually an unleaded motor gasoline base<br>
30     blend composition.<br>
The branched chain alkanes e.g.compounds A may be alkanes of 8-12 carbon atoms (especially 8-10 or 8 or 10 carbons) with 3 methyl and/or ethyl branches. Methyl<br><br>
WO 00/77130<br><br>
PCT/GBOO/02282<br><br>
branches are preferred. The compounds usually have their longest chain of carbon atoms, hereinafter called their backbone chain, with 4-6 chain carbon atoms (especially 4 or 5) to which the methyl, and/or ethyl branches are attached. Advantageously, especially in relation to the first to tenth groupings as described further below, there are 5      no branched groups constituting the branches other than methyl or ethyl, and, in the<br>
backbone chain of carbon atoms, there are especially no linear alkyl groups of more than 2 carbons nor 1,2 ethylene or 1,3 propylene groups in the chain, and especially no methylene groups in the chain except as part of an ethyl group; thus there are especially no n-propyl or n-butyl groups forming part of the backbone chain. Preferably, when in 10      the,composition there is at least one compound (A) alkane of 9-12 e.g. 9 or 10 carbons, there is usually as well less than 50% or 10% of an 8 carbon alkane compound (A).<br>
The compounds can have 1 or 2 methyl or ethyl groups attached to the same<br>
carbon atom of the backbone chain, especially 1 or 2 methyl groups and 0 or 1 ethyl<br>
groups. The carbon atom in the backbone at which the branching occurs is non-terminal<br>
15      i.e. is an internal carbon in the backbone chain, especially the 2, 3 and/or 4 numbered<br>
carbon in the backbone. Thus advantageously the compound has geminal methyl<br>
substituents on position 2, 3 or 4 carbon atom, especially position 2, but in particular<br>
position 3.	 <br>
In a first grouping of compounds A, there is one pair of geminal methyl branch 20      substituents, and they are on position 2.<br>
In a second grouping of the compounds A there is 1 pair of geminal methyl branch substituents on a 4-6 carbon chain backbone. The compounds of the second grouping advantageously have a MON value of at least 100.<br>
In a third grouping of the compounds, there is one geminal methyl branch grouping 25      i.e. -CMe2- on the backbone, while on one of the adjacent carbon atoms of the backbone, there is a methyl or ethyl branch, especially a methyl branch.<br>
In a fourth grouping of the compounds there is one pair of geminal methyl branches on the 2 position backbone carbon and there is a methyl branch on the 3 position backbone carbon. Such compounds usually have a RON value of at least 111. 30      Advantageously the compounds are of 8 or 10 carbon atoms.<br>
In a fifth grouping the compound A has 3 methyl or ethyl substituents on different back bone carbon atoms, especially on vicinal carbon atoms.<br><br>

PCT/GBO0/02282<br><br>
In a sixth grouping the compounds have a linear backbone chain of 4 or 6 carbons and have 3 methyl branches, one pair of which is one geminal group (CMe2) especially in the absence of a 1,2 ethyl group in the backbone.<br>
In a seventh grouping, the compounds have a linear backbone chain of 5 or 6 carbons and have 3 branches one pair of which is in one geminal group, are usually liquid at 25°C and generally have a RON value of greater than 105. Especially there are only methyl branches; such compounds usually have a MON value of at least 101.<br>
Advantageously in an eighth grouping the compounds A contain 1 chain carbon atoms with geminal methyl branches, with one branch on the vicinal carbon atom to the geminal one, and any ethyl -C- chain group in the backbone chain has 5 carbon atoms i.e. is (Ethyl)2CH or Ethyl CMe2-.<br>
. A particularly preferred sub-class (ninth grouping) for the compound A is alkanes with 3 methyl or ethyl substituents which are (i) on vicinal internal carbon atoms, with a total of 4, 5 or 6 carbon atoms in said substituents.<br>
Or (ii)    with a total of 3 carbon atoms in said substituents and a one terminal CHMe2 group.<br>
Or (iii)   with a total of 3 carbon atoms in said substituents and contain only secondary internal carbon atoms in the longest carbon atom chain.<br>
Among this sub-class are preferred (i) and (ii) and especially with geminal methyl groups on an internal chain carbon atom.<br>
In another aspect of the invention there is provided an unleaded blend composition having a MON value of at least 81 or 85 and RON value of at least 91 or 94, which comprises component (a) a totai of at ieast 15% of one or more branched alkane compounds A1 of 8-12 carbons (especially with 4-6 backbone carbon atoms), with 3 methyl or ethyl branches and at least 2 backbone carbon atom which are secondary and/or tertiary carbon atoms, (subject of course to there being not more than one tertiary backbone carbon atom) with the proviso that if there are only 2 such carbon atoms, then one is tertiary, there being a minimum of at least 10% (by volume of the composition) of at least one individual compound A1, and component (b) of nature and in amount as described herein, with the preferred proviso as described above. In the above component A1, which may be the same or different from A, there may thus in a tenth grouping be in the backbone internal (i.e. non-terminal) carbon atoms which are (i) 1 tertiary and 1 sec,<br><br>
WO 00/77130<br><br>
PCT/GB00/02282<br><br>
in particular (ii) with the tert and a sec. carbon vicinal or (iii) 1 tertiary 1 sec. and 1 primary especially with vicinal tert and sec. carbons or vicinal or non-vicinal sec. carbons or (iv) 3 sec. carbons, with at least 2 e.g. 3 vicinal. The compounds A1 usually are free from 2 primary internal backbone carbon atoms on vicinal carbons i.e. as in 1,2-ethylene 5      group. Preferably any primary internal backbone carbon atoms are not between, e.g. adjacent on both sides to, a tert. and/or sec. carbon on the one hand and a sec. carbon on the other hand. Especially at least the said 2 backbone carbon atoms above in compounds A1 are vicinal.<br>
In another category, the eleventh grouping is of compounds A1 which contain<br>
10     (with proviso that they only have 3 branched groups )(i) as one end of the backbone a group of formula CHR"R2 where each of R1 and R2, which are the same or different is a methyl or ethyl group or (ii) as one end of the backbone a group of formula CR1  R2R3 where R1 and R2 are as defined above and R3 is methyl or ethyl. Preferred are such compounds A which have both (i) and (ii), especially when the CHR R group is<br>
15      CHMe2 when the compound has 8 carbons or a backbone of 5 carbons and when all internal carbon atoms in the backbone chain are secondary or tertiary (subject to a total of 3 branched groups).<br>
The compounds A or A1 may have a boiling point at 1 bar pressure of 129-150°C 110-129°C, or 90-109°C. In particular the boiling point is preferably at least 105°C e.g.<br>
20      105-175°C, with the proviso that compound A or A1 is Not 223 trimethyl pentane or is at least 112°C such as 112-175°C.<br>
In another category the compounds A or A1 may have 3 methyl and/or ethyl branches on a 4-6 carbon backbone, and especially a ratio of carbon atom in branches to carbon atoms in the backbone chain of at least 0.55:1 e.g. 0.55-0.9:1 such as 0.63-0.9:1.<br>
25      The compounds usually have 9 carbons, unless the above ratio is at least 0.63 or 0.75. Preferred compounds are 223 trimethyl pentane (A3), 224 trimethyl pentane (isooctane) (A4) 22 Me2 3 ethyl pentane (A5), 233 trimethyl pentane (A6) 24 dimethyl 3 ethyl pentane (A8), and 234 trimethyl pentane (A9). The branched hydrocarbon may also not be 224 trimethyl pentane and/or 223 trimethyl pentane.<br>
30	The compounds A and A1 are either known compounds and may be made<br>
according to the published literature, or are novel and may be made by conventional methods known per se in the literature (e.g. as described in Kirk Othmer Encyclopaedia<br><br>
WO 00/77130<br><br>
PCT/GB00/02282<br><br>
of Chemical Technology 3rd Ed. Publ. Wiley). Examples of suitable methods of preparation are known carbon-carbon coupling techniques for making alkanes. The technique may involve reactions of one or more usually 1 or 2 alkyl chlorides, bromides or iodides with an elemental metal of Group I A, II A, IB or IIB of the Periodic Table in 5      Advanced Inorganic Chemistry by F.A.Cotton + G.wilkinson, Pub. Interscience New York 2nd Ed. 1966, especially sodium, magnesium, or zinc. The alkyl halide is usually a branched chain one of 3-6 carbons, in particular with methyl or ethyl branches, and especially with the halogen atom attached to a CMe2 group in one of the alky) halides. Preferably a halide is of formula MeCMe2X or EtCMe2X, where X is CI, B or I and the<br>
10      other halide is a secondary halide e.g. of formula RR"CH-X where each of R and R1 is methyl or ethyl, such as isopropyl or sec butyl or sec amyl halide or a primary, branched alkyl halide e.g. of formula R11CH2X, where R11 is a branched alkyl group 3-5 carbons with methyl or ethyl branches, such as isopropyl, isobutyl or isoamyl. Alternatively both halides can be secondary e.g. of formula RR"CHX, as defined above and R11IRrvCHX<br>
15     where Rin is methyl or ethyl and R™ is as defined for R!1, such as isopropyl or. one caii be secondary (as above) and one can be primary e.g. methyl or ethyl halide. The methods of coupling optimum for any particular compound A or A1 depend on availability of the precursor alkyl halide(s) so that in addition to the above kinds, coupling via methyl or ethyl halides with branched alkyl halides of 6-9 carbons may also<br>
20     be used. The alkyl halide(s) can react together in the presence of the metal (as in a Wurtz reaction with sodium), or one can react first with the metal to form an organometallic compound e.g. a Grignard reagent or organo zinc, followed by reaction of the organometaiiic with the other aikyi haiide. If desired the Grignard reagent reaction can be in the presence of a metal of Group IB or IIB, such as silver, zinc or<br>
25      copper (especially high activity copper). If desired the Grignard reagent from one or<br>
both alkyl halides can be reacted with the latter metal to form other alkyl metallic species e.g. alkyl silver or alkyl copper compounds, which can disproportionate to the coupled alkane. The Grignard reagent(s) can also react with a cuprous halide to form alkyl copper species for disproportionation. Finally an organometallic compound, wherein the<br>
30     metal is of Group IA or IIA e.g, hi orMg can be coupJed by reaction with a cuprous complex to give a coupled alkane.<br>
The above organometallic reactions are usually conducted under inert conditions,<br><br>
WO 00/77130<br><br>
PCT/GB00/02282<br><br>
i.e. anhydrous and in the absence of-oxygen e.g. under dry nitrogen. They are usually performed in an inert solvent e.g. a dry hydrocarbon or ether. At the end of the reaction any residual organometailic material is decomposed by addition of a compound with active hydrogen e.g. water or an alcohol, and the alkanes are distilled off, either directly or after distribution between an organic and aqueous phase.<br>
Examples of preparations of highly branched alkanes are described in F L Howard etal, J Res. Nat. Bur. Standards Research Paper RP1779, Vol 38 March 1947 pp 365-395. The disclosures of is document is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The crude alkanes made by the above processes may be used as such in the blends of the invention or may be purified further e.g. by distillation first.<br>
If desired the compounds, especially of 8 carbon atoms may be obtained by fractional distillation of refinery streams e.g. straight run gasolines, or alkylation products e.g. of isoalkanes of 3-5 carbons with alkanes of 3-5 carbons (as described above)<br>
Other known methods of making the alkanes A or A1, are reaction of alkyl metallic compounds e.g. Grignard reagents with carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes, ketones, esters, or anhydrides to form branched chain carbinols, which are dehydrated to the corresponding olefin, which is hydrogenated to the alkane. Thus 2,3,4-trimethyI pentane may be made from isopropyl magnesium bromide and methyl isopropyl ketone (followed by dehydration and hydrogenation), and 2,2-dimethyl 3 ethyl pentane, from ethyl magnesium chloride and di isopropyl ketone.<br>
The present invention also provides an unleaded formulated motor gasoline which comprises said composition of the first to seventh aspects of the invention and at least one gasoline additive e.g. motor or aviation gasoline additive.<br>

The amount of compound A4Hf"present is usually at least 10% of the composition. Total amounts of trimethyl pentanes in the blend are preferable less than 69% of the blend; but advantageously at least 26% (especially when the amount of aromatics is less than 17%. If a 9 or 10 carbon alkane is (a), then the<br>

These are substantially aliphatic blends and gasolines of high octane numbers, without the use of oxygenates such as MTBE, and also substantially saturated.<br>
Other high octane blends and gasolines of the invention especially in the fifth to seventh aspects can have,MON values of 80-95 e.g. 85-95, RON values of 90-100 e.g. 15     95-100, ROAD values of 85-97, compound A or A1 contents of 30-60% e.g. 30-50% (comprising 1 or 2 compounds A or A1, medium naphtha contents of 5-30% and contents of total oleflnic fraction such as steam cracked spirit of 30-50% and 1-5% butane, the blends containing 10-25% aromatics e.g. 12-18% aromatics, 4-14% olefins e.g. 6-12%, and 60-90% such as 70-80% saturates. These high octane materials are 20     obtained without the use of oxygenates.<br>
Further blends and gasolines of the invention can have MON values of 84-90, RON values of 93-98, ROAD values of 86-94, and contain compound A or A1 in amount of 15-35%, total naphtha of 40-65% and oleflnic fractions such as steam cracked spirit of 15-45% and 0 or 1-5% butane, with aromatic contents of 5-25% such as 10-18% olefin 25     contents of 2-14% and saturate contents of 70-90%.<br>

The present invention also provides a blend comprising component (a) and usually 30     at least one motor gasoline additive, e~.g. as described above, in particular with the blend comprising not more than 5% in total e.g. less than 1% of hydrocarbon of bp more than 160°C, and preferably less than 5%, e.g. less than 4% of triptane or 223 trimethyl<br><br>

PCT/GBOO/02282<br><br>
pentane. Examples of component (a) are described above, but it is preferably an alkylate cut, in particular a cut of 15-100°C.<br>
, The invention can provide gasolines e.g. motor or aviation gasoline, in particular of 91, 95, 97, 98 RON values, with desired high Octane Levels but low emission values on 5      combustion in particular of at least one of total hydrocarbons, NOx, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, especially of both total hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide. Thus the invention also provides the use of a component (a) particularly a compound A or A1 e.g. A3, 4, 6 or 9 or an alkylate cut of 15-160°C e.g. bpl5-100°C especially 15-60°C or 90-106 in unleaded gasoline e.g. motor or aviation gasoline of MON at least 80 e.g. 80 to<br>
10     less than 98, e.g. as an additive to or component therein, to reduce the emission levels on combustion, especially of at least one of total hydrocarbons, NOx, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide especially both of total hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide. The invention also provides a method of reducing emissions of exhaust gases in the combustion of unleaded gasoline e.g. motor or aviation gasoline fuels of MON of at least 80 which<br>
15      comprises having at least 10% component (a), in particular a compound A or A1 e.g. A3, 4, 6 or 9 or an alkylate cut of bp 15-160°C or 15-100°C especially 15-60°C or 90-106°C present in the fuel which is a gasoline of the invention. The invention also provides use of an unleaded gasoline of the invention in a spark ignition combustion engine to reduce emissions of exhaust gases. The compositions of the invention may be<br>
20     used in supercharged or turbocharged engines, or in normally aspirated ones. The component (a), preferably a compound A or an alkylate cut of bp 15-160°C or bp 15-100°C especially 15-60°C or 90 to 106°C can reduce one or more of the above emission levels better than amounts of alkylate or a mixture of aromatics and oxygenate at similar Octane Number and usually decrease the fuel consumption as well.<br>
25	Automobile exhaust emissions vary very much depending on the vehicle<br>
technology and whether the engine is hot or cold, even with engines whose exhaust gases pass through a catalytic converter before reaching the outside environment. In a cold engine, the effects of friction, lubricants and the nature of fuel vapourisation among others, differ from those with a hot engine in an unpredictable way, and it is with cold<br>
30     engines that most tailpipe emissions are produced, because of enriched fuelling and, for those vehicles with catalytic converters, because the catalytic converter becomes increasingly effective at reducing emissions when it becomes hot. For the latter vehicles<br><br>
WO 00/77130<br><br>
PCT/GB00/02282<br><br>
as well, a Lambda sensor upstream of the converter controls the fuel/air ratio entering the engine, but this is not effective with a cold engine (resulting in an unregulated fuel/air ratio). It is only after the cold start period that the sensor quickly becomes effective, (resulting in a regulated fuel/air ratio), even when the catalyst is not yet hot enough to be 5      effective. Thus cold start operations are different from hot running operations and yet contribute to a large amount of tailpipe emissions. The period of cold start relates to a period of time or distance, which may vary, depending on how the car is driven and/or ambient conditions e.g. up to 2 km or 4 or 2 rnin, or a temperature at which the engine coolant (e.g. radiator water temperature) is below 50°C. The car engine may also be 10     deemed cold if it has not been operated for the previous 4hr before start, usually at least 6hr before start.<br>
Gasolines of the invention with component [a], especially one which is a stream<br>
obtained by or obtainable by distillation as a cut of B.Pt. 15-100C, give reduced<br>
emissions on cold start compared to base fuel.<br>
15	Thus the present invention also provides of method of reducing emissions of<br>
exhaust gases in the combustion of unleaded gasoline fuels of MON of at least 80 e.g. 80 to less than 98 from cold start of a spark ignition combustion engine, which comprises having a component[a] present in the fuel which is a gasoline of the invention. In the compositions, gasolines, methods and uses of the invention the component (a) is 20     preferably used in an emission-reducing effective amount, in particular at cold start.<br>
The gasolines of the invention may be used in internal combustion spark ignition engines. They may be used to power moving vehicles on land and/or sea and/or"iri^thb air, the invention also provides a method of moving such vehicles by combustion of a gasoline of the invention. The vehicle usually has a driver and especially means to carry 25      at least one passenger and/or freight.<br>
The engine sizes for motor gasoline use are usually at least 45cc e.g. 45-10000cc e.g. at least 200cc, such as 500-10000cc, in particular 950-2550, such as 950-1550, or 1250-1850cc, or 2500-10000cc such as 2500-5000 or 5000-9000cc. The engines have at least 1 cylinder, but preferably at least 2 or 3 cylinders, e.g. 3-16, especially 4-6 or 8 30     cylinders; each cylinder is usually of 45-1250cc e.g..200-1200cc, in particular 240-520cc or 500-1000cc. The engines may be 2 stroke engines, but are preferably 4 stroke. Rotary engines e.g. of the Wankel type may be used. The motor engines may be used to<br><br>
WO 00/77130<br><br>
PCT/GB00/02282<br><br>
power vehicles with at least 2 wheels e.g. 2-4 powered wheels, such as motor bicycles, tricycles, and 3 wheeled cars, vans and motor cars, in particular those vehicles legislated for use on a public highway but also off road e.g. 4 wheeled drive vehicles, sports cars for highway use, and racing cars, including drag racing cars and track racing cars. Power 5      from the engine will preferably be connected to the driving wheels via a gearbox and clutch system, or other form of drive train system, to achieve the transition from a stationary to a-mobile state. The engine and drive train will best allow a range of actual vehicle road speed of between l-350km/h, preferably between 5-130km/h and allow for continuous variation of speed thereof. The road speed of the vehicle is usually reduced<br>
10      by a braking mechanism fitted to the vehicle, the braking being generally applied by friction. The engine may either by air or water cooled, the air motion induced by a moving vehicle being used to directly, or indirectly cool the engine. The vehicle comprises a means to facilitate a change of vehicle direction, e.g. a steering wheel or stick. Usually at least 10% of the vehicle distance travelled is carried out at greater than<br>
15      5km/h.<br>
The engines using aviation gasoline are usually in piston driven aircraft, i.e. with at least one engine driving a means for mechanically moving air such as at least one propeller. Each engine usually drives at least one propeller driving shaft with 1 or 2 propellors. The aircraft may have 1-10 propellers e.g. 2-4. The aircraft engines usually<br>
20      have at least 2 cylinders, e.g. 2 to 28 cylinders, each of which is preferably greater than 700cc in volume, such as 700-2000cc e.g. 13 lOcc. The total engine size is usually 3700-50000cc e.g. 3700 to 12000cc for single or twin engined passenger light aircraft, 12000 to 45000cc for 2 or 4 engined freight or airline use (e.g. 15-200 passengers, such as 50 to 150 passengers). The engines may have an engine power to weight ratio of at least<br>
25      0.3Hp/lb wt of engine, e.g. 0.3-2Hp/lb, and may have a power to cylinder volume of at least 0.5 (Hp/cu.in) e.g. 0.5-2. Cylinders may be arranged in rows, V formation, H formation, flat ("horizontally opposed") or radially around a common propeller drive shaft. One or more rows/circles of cylinders may be used, e.g. flat 2, flat 4, flat 6, V12, 2 or 3 circles of 7 cylinders etc. Every cylinder has one and more preferably at least two<br>
30     spark plugs. A gear system may optionally be used to drive the propeller and or a supercharger. Alternatively, an exhaust turbo charger may also be present. Exhaust outlets may be individual or run into a common manifold and preferably point in the<br><br>
WO 00/77130<br><br>
PCT/GB00/02282<br><br>
opposite direction to forward flight. Fins may be present on the exterior of the engine for air cooling. Greater than 90% of the distance travelled by the engine, when in use, is usually spent at 500 feet or more above ground level. Typically, during greater than 90% of the time when the engine is running, the engine operates at above lOOOrpm e.g. 5      between 1000 to 3500 rpm.<br>
The aircraft usually has at least one tank having a capacity of at least 1001, especially with a total capacity of at least 10001.<br>
The gasolines of the" invention may be made in a refinery by blending the ingredients to produce at least 200,0001/d ay of gasoline such as l-10milJion 1/day. The<br>
10     gasoline may be distributed to a plurality of retail outlets for motor gasoline, optionally , via wholesale or bulk outlets e.g. holding tanks, such as ones of at least 2 million 1 capacity e.g. 5-15 million 1. The distribution may be by pipeline or in tanks transported by road, rail or water, the tanks being of at least 50001 capacity. At the retail sites e.g. filling station, the motor gasoline is dispensed to a plurality of users, i.e. the drivers of<br>
15     the vehicles, e.g. at a rate of at least 100 or 1000 different users per day. For aviation use, the gasoline is usually made in a refinery to produce at least 1000 barrels per day (or 100,0001/day) such as 0.1-2 million 1/day. The avgas is usually distributed by tanker by road, rail or water, or pipelines directly to the airport distribution or holdifig tanks, e.g. of at least 300,0001 capacity, from whence it is distributed by pipeline or tanker (e.g. a<br>
20      mobile refuelling bowser to fuel a plurality of aircraft, e.g. at least 5/day per tank; the aircraft may have one or more on-board tank each of at least 1001 capacity.<br>
The aviation gasolines of the invention comprising component (a) preferably have RVP of 38-49 kPa, 10-40% evaporated at 75°C, at least 5.0% evaporated at 105°C at least 90% evaporated at 135°C and the sum of temperature of 10% evaporated with that<br>
25     of 50% evaporation greater than 135°C.<br>
The present invention is illustrated in the following Examples. Example 1<br>
An alkylate of IBP 31.9°C and FBP 191.3°C was a refinery grade product obtained commercially by HF catalysed reaction of refinery grade isobutene and isbbutane. This<br>
30      alkylate was then distilled according to ASTMD2892 to give a series of cuts at the temperatures below in Table 1 with the analyses give in % w/w for their main components (present in at least 1% w/w).<br><br><br><br>
WO 00/77130	PCT/GB00/02282<br><br>
Examples 2 and 3<br>
A base Fuel was blended from 3.0 parts butane, 22.0.parts full range alkylate (as used as feed in Ex. I) 40 parts catalytic reformates-4 0 parts bisomer.75 parts of this base 5      fuel were blended with 25 parts of alkylate cut J to give blend Ex.2, and also separately with 25 parts of alkylate cut K to give blend Ex.3, and 25 parts of heavy reformate to give Comp. Blend.<br>
3 Formulated gasolines were made, each containing one of the above blends and a 15mg/l of a phenolic antioxidant 55% minimum 2,4 dimethyI-6-tertiary butyl phenol 15% 10     minimum 4 methyl-2, 6-ditertiary-butyl phenol with the remainder as a mixture of<br>
monomethyl and dimethyl-tertiary butyl phenols. The gasolines of Ex.2 and 3 meet the European 2005 specification without use of oxygenates.<br>
In each case the gasolines were tested for MON and RON, and their Reid Vapour Pressure at 37.8°C. The results are shown in table 2, which also shows these properties 15      for alkylate cuts A-M. The distillation properties of the blend Ex.2,3 and comp. Blend were tested according to ASTM D86 and shown in Table 3.<br><br><br><br><br>
Example 4<br>
The emission characteristics on combustion of the formulated gasolines of comp. 5      Blend, Ex.2 and 3, and the cuts A-N were compared.<br>
The fuels were tested in a single cylinder research engine at a speed/load of 50/14.3 rps/Nm with a LAMBDA setting of 1.01, and the ignition setting was optimized for the comparative blend. The emissions of CO, C02, total hydrocarbons, Nox, were measured from the exhaust gases. The results were averaged. The results were as follows as<br><br>
WO 00/77130	PCT/GBOO/02282<br>
shown in Table 4 expressed as the change in emissions compared to comp. Blend and in addition the percentage gravimetric change in the Fuel Consumption.<br><br>
As the research engines were not fitted with catalysts in their exhausts, the reductions in emissions provide an indication of the benefits of reduced emissions downstream of the exhaust catalyst before any exhaust catalyst has heated up and became operable; this corresponds to cold start condition. 10     Examples 5 and 6<br>
Blends are made in the manner of Ex.2 and 3 from the base Fuel (75 parts) and cut A (25 parts) to give Ex.5 and separately with combined cuts B-E (25 parts) to give Ex.6. Formulated gasolines are made as in Ex.2 and 3. They give reduced emissions compared to the Comp. Blend.<br><br>

A blend is made up with the following ingredients, steam cracked spirit 32.0%, full range alkylate (as the feed to Ex. 1) 30%, cut A-E 10%, Reformate 11.0%, toluene 16.0%, butane 1.0%. A formulated gasoline also contains 15mg/l of the antioxidant of 5      Ex.2/3. The properties of the fuel are as follows in Table 5<br><br>
10	This gasoline also gives reduced emissions.<br>
Examples 8-11 and Comparative Ex. A<br>
Various unleaded blends were made up with each of compounds A4, A6, A9, 225<br>
trimethyl hexane in each case blended with various refinery streams as shown in Table 5,<br>
as well as Comp Ex. A with heavy reformate.<br>
15	6 formulated gasolines were made, each containing one of the above blends and<br>
15mg/l of the phenolic antioxidant used in Ex.2-3.<br>
In each case the gasolines were tested for MON and RON, and their Reid Vapour<br><br>

Pressure at 37.8°C. The results are shown in table 5, which also shows their analyses and distillation profile (according to ASTM D86).<br>
The emission characteristics on combustion of the formulated gasolines of Ex. 8-11<br>
and Comp. A were determined.<br>
5	The fuels were tested as in Ex. 4 in a single cylinder research engine at a<br>
speed/load of 20/7/2rps/Nm with LAMBDA setting of 1.01, and the ignition setting was optimised for the comparative blend A. The emissions of CO, C02 total carbon oxides, total hydrocarbons, Nox were measured from the exhaust gases as was the Fuel Consumption (expressed in g/h"Whr). The results were averaged and compared to the 10     comparative Ex.A. The degrees of change were as given in Table 6.<br>
