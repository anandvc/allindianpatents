				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to rotary regenerative heat<br>
exchngers generally used as air preheaters and more specifically<br>
to rotary regenerative heat exchangers having a semi-modular<br>
rotor construction.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A rotary regenerative heat exchanger is employed to transfer<br>
heat from one hot gas stream, such as a hot flue gas stream, to<br>
another cold gas stream, such a combustion air. The rotor<br>
contains a mass of heat absorbent material which first rotates<br>
through a passageway for the hot gas stream where heat is<br>
absorbed by the heat absorbent material. As the rotor continues<br>
to turn, the heated absorbent material enters the passageway for<br>
the cold gas stream where the heat is transferred from the<br>
absorbent material to the cold gas stream.<br>
In a traditional rotary heat exchanger, the cylindrical<br>
rotor is disposed on a verticl central rotor post and divided<br>
into a plurality of sector-shaped compartments by a plurality of<br><br>
radial partitions, referred to as diaphragms, extending from the<br>
rotor post to the outer peripheral shell of the rotor. These<br>
sector-shaped compartments are loaded with modular heat exchange<br>
baskets which contain the mass of heat absorbent material<br>
commonly formed of stacked plate-like elements.<br>
The rotors of such heat exchangers are either formed as non-<br>
modular rotors or as modular rotors. The nonâ€”modular rotors<br>
comprise as series of diaphragm plates each attached to the rotor<br>
post and extending out to the rotor shell thereby dividing the<br>
rotor into sectors. Further, each sector is divided into a number<br>
of compartments by stay plates extending between the diaphragms<br>
at spaced intervals. The modular heat exchange baskets are then<br>
loaded axially into these compartments from the top end. The non-<br>
modular rotors are field labor<br><br>
intensive because all of the heat transfer surface is field installed.<br>
Further, more structural welds are reauired to field assemble non-modular<br>
rotors. The result is more total time to field install the heat exchanger<br>
rotor structure.<br>
Modular rotors are composed of a series of shop-assembled<br>
sector modules which are then field-assembled into a complete rotor.<br>
Each sector module has a diaphragm plate on each side with these two<br>
diaphragms being joined by stay plates. The heat transfer surface of the<br>
sector modules is also shop installed. When these modules are<br>
assembled into a rotor in the field, the diaphragm plates of adjacent<br>
modules are joined together to form a double plated diaphragm. Although<br>
the modular rotors require less time to field-install than non-modular<br>
rotors, they require twice as many individual diaphragm plates which take<br>
up gas flow area and allow less heat transfer area for the same size rotor<br>
and post diameter. Also, they are component intensive because of all the<br>
parts necessary to pin the adjacent modules to each other at diaphragm<br>
locations.<br>
Most modular and non-modular rotor desians contain stay plates<br>
as previously described. The stay plates reinforce the rotor structure and<br>
support the baskets. Because the baskets are inserted axially and must<br>
fit in the stay plate compartments, the baskets must be undersized for<br>
easy installation and removal. Undersizing involves providing a gap<br>
around the perimeter of each basket. This reduces the free area of the<br>
basket available for heat transfer flow and creates flow bypass gaps<br>
around the baskets. The result is decreased air preheater efficiency and<br>
the selection of larger air preheaters for any particular performance<br>
requirements.<br><br>
In U.S. 5.615.732.. a rotor having a semi-modular construction is<br>
described. The rotor is fabricated from a combination of shop assembled<br>
sector modules and field assembled components in a way to eliminate the<br>
double plate diaphragms of the normal modular rotors and thereby<br>
maximize the internal volume of the preheater which is available for heat<br>
transfer surface. The shop assembled modules comprise one or more<br>
sectors, depending primarily on the rotor size, with the field assembled<br>
components fitting between spaced shop assembled modules. The semi-<br>
modular rotor may further eliminate the stay plates, substituting support<br>
gratings which extend between the diaphragms and form open supports<br>
on which the baskets are supported. The baskets are loaded into the<br>
sectors radially, instead of axially. This eliminates the need for gaps<br>
around the baskets and the undersizing of the baskets. These support<br>
gratings are part of the shop assembled modules and also are a part of<br>
the field assembled components which actually facilitate the field<br>
assembly.<br>
Although the semi-modular rotor construction maximizes the<br>
space available for heat transfer surface, such construction requires that<br>
a significant amount of field-erection time be dedicated to assembling half<br>
of the rotor structure and installing half of the heat-transfer surface. The<br>
use of field-labor increases the cost of the air preheater, since field-labor<br>
is more expensive than shop-labor. In addition, field-labor cannot<br>
assemble components as precisely as shop labor due to the absence of<br>
shop fixtures. Accordingly, there is an increased risk of assembly related<br>
errors which require later rework.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Briefly stated, the invention in a preferred form is a semi-modular<br>
rotor module for an air preheater having a circular rotor. The rotor<br>
module comprises a lug assembly including a lug front and a lug back<br>
spaced radially outward from the lug front. The lug front and iugjaack<br>
each extend longitudinally from a first end to a second end. The lug<br>
assembly also includes a cold end lug member mounted to the first ends<br>
of the lug front and the lug back and a hot end lug member mounted to<br>
the second ends of the lug front and the lug back. The lug front, lug<br>
back, cold end lug member and hot end lug member define<br>
circumferentially spaced first and second sides of the lug assembly. A<br>
single main diaphragm extends radially from an inner end portion to an<br>
outer end portion, with the inner end portion being mounted to the lug<br>
front on the first side of the lug assembly. The outer end portion is<br>
mounted to a rotor shell which is spaced radially outward from the lug<br>
back. At least one intermediate diaphragm extends radially from an inner<br>
end portion, mounted to the lug back at a position intermediate the first<br>
and second sides of the lug assembly, to an outer end portion mounted<br>
to the rotor shell.<br>
Preferably the rotor module includes multiple intermediate<br>
diaphraqms mounted in circumferentially spaced relationship to the lug<br>
back. The inner end portion of the intermediate diaphragm<br>
circumferentially spaced furthest from the main diaphragm is mounted to<br>
lug back at the position intermediate the first and second sides of the lug<br>
assembly.<br>
The lug front and the lug back are each rectangular plates having<br>
an arcuate shape, with the lug front and lug back being substantially<br><br>
coaxial. Similarly, the cold and hot end lug members each have<br>
substantially coaxial arcuate-shaped outboard edges.<br>
The lug assembly also includes multiple circumferentially spaced<br>
stiffening plates, with each stiffening plate extending longitudinally<br>
between the cold end lug member and the hot end lug member and<br>
radially between the lug front and the lug back. The longitudinally<br>
opposite edges of the stiffening plates are mounted to the cold and hot<br>
end lug members and the radially opposite edges are mounted to the lug<br>
front and the lug back. The lug assembly also includes multiple<br>
longitudinally spaced stiffening members, with each of the stiffening<br>
members extending circumferentially between adjacent stiffening plates<br>
and radially between the lug front and the lug back. The circumferentially<br>
opposite edges of the stiffening members are mounted to the stifferVing<br>
plates and the radially opposite edges of the stiffening members are<br>
mounted to the lug front and the lug back.<br>
The rotor module also comprises cold end and hot end seal<br>
extensions extending longitudinally from the cold end and hot end lug<br>
members. The rotor module further comprises multiple radially spaced<br>
stay plate assemblies which extend circumferentially between the<br>
diaphragms.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an air preheater rotor<br>
which is more easily assembled from multiple rotor modules.<br>
It is also an obiect of the invention to provide a lower-cost rotor<br>
structure which requires less field-erection time.<br>
It is further an objent of the invention to provide an air preheater<br>
rotor having improved interchangeability of the basketed heat exchange<br>
element.<br><br>
Other objects and advantages of the invention will become<br>
apparent from the drawings and specification.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Figure 1 of the drawings is a partially cut-away perspective view<br>
of a typical air preheater 10 showing a housing 12 in which the rotor 14<br><br>
is mounted on drive shaft or post 16 for rotation as indicated by the<br>
arrow 18. The rotor is composed of a plurality of sectors 20 with each<br>
sector containing a number of basket modules 22 and with each sector<br>
being defined by the diaphragms 24. The basket modules 22 contain the<br>
heat exchange surface. The housing 1 2 is divided by means of the flow<br>
impervious sector plate 26 into a flue gas side and an air side. A<br>
corresponding sector plate is also located on the bottom of the unit. The<br>
hot flue gases enter the air heater through the gas inlet duct 28, flow<br>
through the rotor 1 4 where heat is transferred to the basket modules 22<br>
and then exit through gas outlet duct 30. The countercurrent flowing air<br>
enters through air inlet duct 32, flows through the basket modules 22<br>
where it picks up heat and then exits through air outlet duct 34. The gas<br>
inlet duct 28 and the air outlet duct 34 define a hot end 36 of the rotor<br>
14 and the gas outlet duct 30 and air inlet duct 32 define a cold end 38<br>
of the rotor 1 4.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2 which shows a plan view of a portion<br>
of conventional semi-modular rotor 40 assembled from a series of shop<br>
assembled modules 42 and a series of field assembled components which<br>
are located between the shop assembled modules 42 and which complete<br>
the rotor construction without any double diaphragms. The shop<br>
assembled modules 42 are attached to the rotor shaft or post 1 6 in<br>
spaced positions leaving an open space between them. The remaining<br>
components of the rotor 40 which are then field assembled are located<br>
in these spaces. The field assembled components comprise module lug<br>
and diaphragm assemblies 44 and may include grating assemblies 46.<br>
The modular lug and diaphragm assembly 44 includes a diaphragm 48,<br>
which is essentially the same as each of the intermediate diaphragms 58<br>
of the shop assembled module 42 and a lug 50 which is essentially the<br><br>
same as the lug 52 of the shop assembled module 42. The grating<br>
assemblies 46 are essentially the same as the gratings 54 which form a<br>
part of the shop assembled modules 42. These gratings are attached to<br>
and between the shop assembled modules 42 and diaphragm 48<br>
preferably by welding to complete the rotor structure. A grating 46 is<br>
located at each basket level within the rotor 40 the same as the gratings<br>
54 in the shop assembled modules 42. The arrangement of shop<br>
assembled modules 42 and field assembled components continues all the<br>
way around the hub to form a complete rotor structure.<br>
Reliance on field-labor to assemble the rotor increases the cost<br>
and the opportunity for assembly-related errors, compared to completely<br>
shop-built rotors. In addition, the conventional semi-modular rotor design<br>
has several inherent deficiencies/limitations. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, the design requires eighteen (18) module lugs 50, 52 per<br>
rotor 40, while it is possible to construct a non-semi-modular rotor having<br>
only nine (9) module lugs. The additional module lugs 50, 52 generate<br>
an otherwise unnecessary shop-assembly expense. The flat outboard<br>
side 56 of the module lug 50, 52 in combination with the arcuate rotor<br>
periphery requires intermediate diaphragms 58 having different radial<br>
lengths, increasing the cost and complexity of assembly. In addition, the<br>
rotor module lug geometry requires the use of asymmetrically-shaped<br>
baskets in the radially inboard layer if the remaining layers are to have a<br>
symmetrical shape. When it is desired to reverse the hot and cold faces<br>
of the basket (as is often done to prolong basket life), the asymmetric<br>
basket must be removed from its original sector, flipped, and placed in<br>
the adjacent sector, resulting in additional labor expenses.<br>
With reference to Figures 3 and 4, a rotor module 60 in<br>
accordance with the invention includes a lug assembly 62, a single main<br><br>
diaphragm 64, a rotor shell 66, hot and cold end seal extensions 68, 70,<br>
multiple stay plate assemblies 72, multiple basket support bars 74,<br>
multiple lifting lugs 76, and preferably multiple intermediate diaphragms<br>
78. The rotor module 60 may also include grating assemblies (not<br>
shown). As shown in Figure 2, the conventional shop assembled<br>
modules 42 included a main diaphragm 24 on each side of the module 42<br>
while the field assembled components did not include any main<br>
diaphragms. In a rotor assembled from rotor modules 60, the main<br>
diaphragm 64 of each rotor module 60 extends radially from the lug front<br>
80 to the rotor shell 66 on the same side of each of the rotor modules 60<br>
(with the radially inner and outer end portions 81, 83 of the main<br>
diaphragm 64 being welded to the lug front 80 and rotor shell 66,<br>
respectively). As shown in Figure 3, each rotor module 60 is mounted<br>
immediately next to each adjacent rotor module 60', with the space of<br>
the "missing" main diaphragm of each rotor module 60 being occupied by<br>
the main diaphragm 64' of an adjacent rotor module 60'. Accordingly,<br>
all of the rotor modules 60 are substantially identical, shop assembled<br>
units. The only field assembled components are the rotor shells 66', stay<br>
plate assemblies 72' and grating assemblies (as required) which extend<br>
between the "exposed" intermediate diaphragm 78' of each rotor module<br>
60 and the main diaphragm 64' of each adjacent rotor module 60'.<br>
Therefore, the rotor modules 60 and field assembled components may be<br>
assembled into a rotor in much less time than the conventional semi-<br>
modular rotor 40.<br>
To facilitate discussion, the lug assembly 62 of Figures 5 and 6<br>
will be described as extending vertically from the lower, cold end lug<br>
member 82 to the upper, hot end lug member 84, for use in a vertical air<br>
preheater.<br><br>
A radially inner lug front 80 and a radially outer lug back 86 each<br>
have a lower end 88, 90 welded to the inner surface 92 of the cold end<br>
lug member 82 and an upper end 94, 96 welded to the inner surface 98<br>
of the hot end lug member 84. The lug front 80 and the lug back 86 are<br>
rectangular plates, formed to have an arcuate shape such that the lug<br>
fronts 80 and lug backs 86 of an assembled rotor from concentric circles<br>
around the post 1 6. To mechanically stiffen the lug assembly 62, three<br>
rectangular stiffening plates 100 extend vertically between the cold and<br>
hot end lug members 82, 84 and radially between the lug front 80 and<br>
the lug back 86, with the edges 102, 104, 106, 108 of the stiffening<br>
plates 100 being welded to the inner surfaces 92, 98, 110, 11 2 of the<br>
cold end lug member 82, the hot end lug member 84, the lug back 86,<br>
and the lug front 80. To provide additional rigidity, stiffening members<br>
114 extend horizontally between adjacent stiffening plates 100 and<br>
radially between the lug front 80 and the lug back 86, with the edges<br>
116, 118, 1 20, 1 22 of the stiffening members 1 1 4 being welded to the<br>
surfaces 124, 110, 11 2 of the stiffening plates 100, the lug back 86,<br>
and the lug front 80. The arcuate shape of the lug front 80 and lug back<br>
86 provide a more rigid structure at equivalent radial locations than the<br>
flat-shape of comparable components of the conventional semi-modular<br>
rotor 40. Accordingly, fewer devices for stiffening the lug assembly 62<br>
are required than in conventional semi-modular modules 42. In addition,<br>
the arcuate shape of the lug front 80 and lug back 86 permits the use of<br>
stiffening plates 100 and stiffening members 114 having a constant<br>
radial dimension. This provides reduced manufacturing costs and a<br>
simpler assembly process.<br>
With reference to Figures 7 and 8. the outboard edges 126, 128<br>
of the cold and hot end lug members 82, 84 have an arcuate shape.<br><br>
Similar to the lug front 80 and Jug back 86, outboard edges 126 and 128<br>
form circles around the post 1 6 in an assembled rotor. As shown in<br>
Figures 3 and 4, each rotor module 60 defines an arc-segment of an<br>
assembled rotor, with the lug front 80, the lug back 86, the outboard<br>
edges 126, 128 of the cold and hot end lug members 82, 84, and the<br>
rotor shell 66 all having complimentary arcuate shapes. For a line 130<br>
extending from the post axis to the rotor shell 66, the line segment 1 32<br>
between the lug back 86 and the rotor shell 66 will therefore have the<br>
same length 134 as the line segment 132 between the lug back 86 and<br>
the rotor shell 66 for any other such line 130. Since the intermediate<br>
diaphragms 78 extend from the lug back 86 to the rotor shell 66 (with<br>
the radially inner and outer end portions 136, 138 of the intermediate<br>
diaphragms 78 being welded to the lug back 86 and rotor shell 66,<br>
respectively), all of the intermediate diaphragms 78 have the same radial<br>
length 134, eliminating the cost associated with manufacturing<br>
intermediate diaphragms 78 having different lengths and reducing the<br>
complexity of assembly.<br>
The ability to add additional sectors 20 to a rotor module 60<br>
provides the potential to reduce the number of module lugs required to<br>
construct the rotor. That is, the size of the arc segment defined by the<br>
rotor module 60 may be increased to accommodate additional sectors 20,<br>
thereby reducing the number of rotor modules 60 of the assembled rotor.<br>
Since each rotor module 60 has only a single cold end lug member 82<br>
and a single hot end lug member 84, the number of lugs is reduced.<br>
Accordingly, the amount of field time required to erect the rotor is also<br>
reduced.<br>
The arcuate shape of the lug front 80, the lug back 86, and the<br>
outboard edges 1 26, 128 of the cold and hot end lug members 82, 84<br><br>
permit the use of symmetrically-shaped baskets in the radially inboard<br>
layer. Such symmetrically-shaped baskets are easier to shop-assemble<br>
and easier to reverse in field, when operating practice requires that the<br>
hot and cold faces of the basket be rotated. A symmetrically-shaped<br>
basket does not have to be moved from one sector to another sector, to<br>
switch the hot and cold faces of the basket.<br>
While preferred embodiments have been shown and described,<br>
various modifications and substitutions may be made thereto without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is to<br>
be understood that the present invention has been described by way of<br>
illustration and not limitation.<br><br>
