Combustion of Gaseous Fuel<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus and a method suitable for performing combustion of gaseous fuel, and which may be used for producing hydrogen.<br>
Fuel cells consuming hydrogen and oxygen offer the promise of providing clean power for motor vehicles. However, this leads to a requirement for an efficient and correspondingly clean process for the production of hydrogen.  Steam reforming is a common method of hydrogen production. The main process step involves the reaction of steam with a hydrocarbon over a catalyst to form hydrogen and carbon oxides.  However, the subsequent process steps that are needed to separate the hydrogen from the carbon oxides and any impurities are complicated and expensive.  Likewise, it is difficult to separate out hydrogen from the combustion gases that are formed upon the air gasification of a fuel such as a fossil based hydrocarbon or solid biomass.  The present invention enables pure hydrogen to be produced, while overcoming these problems.<br>
It is recognised that the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, methane or petrol may, in the long-term, have detrimental effects on the Earth's climate-because increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may contribute to global warming.  It has therefore been suggested that sequestration of carbon dioxide gas would be desirable. However carbon dioxide in exhaust gases is typically present in a dilute form, because air is used in the combustion process.  One possible solution is to scrub carbon dioxide from the flue gas, so that the resulting concentrated carbon dioxide can be injected into a<br><br>
oxidising environment respectively.  Appropriate catalyst materials such as ruthenium, palladium or platinum may also be provided on the insert in each channel, which can catalyse both the oxidation and reduction reactions.<br>
Suitable materials for the ceramic are those which are stable at the reaction temperatures and do not react irreversibly with the transition metal, for example alumina or zirconia. The ceramic may also be doped with a material such as lanthanum, cerium or gadolinium to enhance its stability.<br>
It should be appreciated that the "metal" particles might actually be a metal oxide in which the metal is in a low oxidation state, whereas in the "metal oxide" particles the metal is in a higher oxidation state.<br>
To ensure the required good thermal contact, both the first and the second gas flow channels are preferably less than 8 mm deep in the direction normal to the sheets.  More preferably both the first and the second gas flow channels are less than 5 mm deep, but preferably at least 0.5 mm deep.  The heat-conducting insert may comprise a corrugated or dimpled foil, a wire mesh, or a corrugated metal felt.  The ceramic coating is of<br>
thickness typically in the range between 30 and 300 urn, and is porous, the transition metal or metal oxide particles being dispersed within the porous ceramic, and the ceramic being sufficiently porous that the gaseous reagents can diffuse to the surface of the particles. The specific surface area of the ceramic is preferably in the range 50 - 340 m2/g, and the ceramic may be, for example, lanthanum-stabilised gamma-alumina.<br>
It will be appreciated that the materials of which the reactor are made are subjected to a severely<br><br>
metal particles;<br>
b)   supplying the said gaseous fuel to the second flow channels and supplying the oxidizing gas to the first flow channels;<br>
each step being carried out for sufficient time that a substantial proportion of the oxide particles have been reduced, and the gas flows then being exchanged so the other step is carried out.<br>
The gaseous fuel comprises at least one gas which reduces the transition metal oxide particles to metal particles.  It may comprise more than one reductant and may also include a diluent such as nitrogen and or carbon dioxide.  If the combustion gas does not contain a diluent such as nitrogen, the output from the combustion channels can be substantially pure C02 (once any water-vapour has been condensed) .<br>
The oxidizing gas may comprise oxygen, for example it may be air. Alternatively the oxidizing gas may comprise an oxygen-containing compound, such as water vapour.  If the oxidizing gas is steam, then the method provides an output of hydrogen gas, which can be over 99% pure.<br>
The gaseous fuel may be the result of gasifying a hydrocarbon or a biomass product.  For example, biomass such as forestry waste, coppiced willow or rice/corn husk may be decomposed autothermally (partial oxidation), typically in a fluidized bed gasifier, so as to produce hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, water, nitrogen and ash.  For example, a typical gas composition for a 20% moisture wood feed is 50-54% N2/ 17-22% CO, 9-15% C02, 12-20% H2 and 2-3% CH4.  Such a gas has a typical heating<br><br>
oxide. The pure carbon dioxide can then be sequestrated by compression and injection into a suitable sub-surface storage volume without the need to remove any nitrogen.<br>
If the oxidizing gas is steam, this may be produced by heating water.  The steam reacts with the dispersed transition metal particles at elevated temperature,<br>
typically 300-800Â°C, to produce transition metal oxide and hydrogen.  The reaction is endothermic and heat for the reaction is provided from the exothermic reaction of the gaseous fuel with the transition metal oxide in the adj acent set of channels.<br>
If the oxidizing gas is air, the oxygen from the air reacts exothermally to generate the metal oxide. As a<br>
result the temperature may reach above 800Â°C, and heat is transferred into adjacent channels. In the channels carrying the fuel, the fuel reacts with the metal oxide, and is itself oxidized. The absence of a flame front and the good thermal control result in low N0X generation. The overall chemical reaction is that the gaseous fuel is oxidized, so the overall process is strongly exothermic. The reactor may incorporate a third set of channels which in this case may carry a coolant fluid.<br>
Once the reduction and/or the oxidation reaction is substantially completed, the gas streams feeding each set of channels are changed over so that the reactions proceed in alternating quasi-continuous cycles.  The gas flows are exchanged when a substantial proportion of the metal oxide particles have been reduced, and this proportion is preferably at least 30%, more preferably 50%, more preferably 70% and most preferably 90% of the particles.<br>
In one embodiment, the hot product gases, hydrogen,<br><br>
In the first phase of operation the fuel gas is supplied through a valve 20 to the inlet header 19 to flow through the channels 15, and at the same time air is supplied through a valve 22 to the inlet headers 18 to flow through the flow channels 14.  Oxygen from the air reacts vigorously and exothermically with the particles of cobalt metal, oxidising them to cobalt oxide, this reaction increasing the temperature in the channels 14 to about 800Â°C.  Because of the good heat transfer through the inserts and between adjacent channels 14 and 15, the inserts in the channels 15 are also heated to a high temperature, typically about 750Â°C. At this high temperature the fuel gas reduces the cobalt oxide particles to cobalt metal, this reaction being somewhat exothermic; the fuel gas undergoes combustion, by taking oxygen from the oxide particles.<br>
The hot gases emerging from the outlet headers 18 and 19 are consequently at about 750Â°C, and are then supplied via respective valves 24 and 25 to respective heat exchangers 26 to generate steam.  This may be used for electricity generation.  The exhaust gases from the channels 15, in which the fuel gas has been oxidised, are then cooled still further to condense water vapour, as indicated at 28, and the resulting carbon dioxide is subjected to sequestration treatment.<br>
Once substantially all the metal oxide particles have been reduced to metal (in the channels 15) or substantially all the metal particles have been oxidised to metal oxide (in the channels 14), the gas flows are exchanged by operating the valves 20 and 22 and the valves 24 and 25.  Thus in the second phase the fuel gas flows through the channels 14, and the air flows through the channels 15.  These two phases then alternate whenever substantially all the metal oxide particles in<br><br>
which are themselves used alternately so that each plate of the third type is between a plate with diagonal grooves 42 and a plate with mirror image diagonal grooves 42a, and after assembling many plates 41 the stack is completed with a blank rectangular plate.  The plates 41 are compressed together during diffusion bonding, so they are sealed to each other.  Inserts 44 comprising corrugated Fecralloy alloy foils"(only one is shown) 50<br>
pm thick coated with a ceramic coating, of appropriate shapes and with corrugations 2 mm high, can be slid into each such groove 42, 42a and 42b.<br>
Header chambers 18 are welded to the stack along each side, each header 18 defining three compartments by virtue of two fins 47 that are also welded to the stack.<br>
The fins 47 are one third of the way along the length of the stack from each end, and coincide with a land 43 (or a portion of the plates with no groove) in each plate 41 with diagonal grooves 42 or 42a. Gas flow headers 19 in the form of rectangular caps are then welded onto the stack at each end, communicating with the longitudinal grooves 41b.  (In a modification (not shown), in place of each three-compartment header 18 there might instead be three adjacent header chambers, each being a rectangular cap like the headers 19.)   Hence the longitudinal grooves 42b define the channels 15, while the diagonal grooves 42 and 42a define the channels 14.<br>
In use of the reactor 40, the flow path for the mixture supplied to the top-left compartment of the header 18 (as shown) is through the diagonal grooves 42 into the bottom-middle header compartment, and then to flow through the diagonal grooves 42a in other plates in the stack into the top-right compartment of the header 18. Hence the gas flows in the channels 15 and 14 are at least partially co-current.<br><br>
is essential that the channels 14 and 15 are in good thermal contact with each other.  Hence the reactor should define a multiplicity of alternating flow channels, and these are preferably defined between metal sheets in a stack, either by flat sheets with grooves or slots, or by corrugated sheets.  Preferably the channels are not in transverse directions, so the flows are at least partly parallel, but the headers for the different gases must be separate. Furthermore the inserts must be removable, once the headers are removed, so they can be replaced if necessary without replacing the entire reactor.<br>
In one alternative the reactor may also incorporate a third set of flow channels for generating steam.  For example the reactor may comprise a stack of hexagonal plates each defining a set of straight grooves between a pair of opposite sides; plates arranged with their grooves in different orientations provide flow paths for different fluids, so there are flow paths for three different fluids: water/steam; fuel (to reduce metal oxide particles); and air (to oxidize metal particles). These three fluid flow paths may be defined by three successive plates, such groups of three successive plates being repeated to form the stack.  This enables superheated steam to be generated directly from the reactor.  The reactor may operate at a lower temperature to that discussed above, for example 400 - 600Â°C, or even as low as about 300 Â°C if the metal is highly dispersed and a reduction promoter such as ruthenium and platinum is included in the ceramic.<br>
Referring to figure 3, a plant 30 for the production of hydrogen is shown.  The plant 30 incorporates a compact reactor 12 which defines two sets of gas flow channels 14 and 15 which alternate with each other and<br><br>
condense water vapour, if this water is required in the steam generating process, and the remaining gases are vented to the atmosphere. One or both of the heat exchangers 2 6 may alternatively be positioned so as to heat the steam for the compact reactor.<br>
' Once substantially all the metal oxide particles have been reduced to metal (in the channels 14) and substantially all the metal particles have been oxidised to metal oxide (in the channels 15), the gas flows are exchanged by operating the valves 31 and 32 and valves 37 and 38 in the outlet ducts.  Thus in the second phase the fuel gas flows through the channels 15, and the steam flows through the channels 14.  These two operational phases then alternate whenever substantially all the metal particles in the channel carrying the steam have been oxidised to metal oxide.  Hence, hydrogen production is substantially continuous, though taking place alternately in the two sets of channels.  The cycle time for switching between the two phases depends on the operating temperature, the metal loading and the degree of metal dispersion and the space velocity of the feed gases.  So as to maintain a substantially pure flow of hydrogen the exhaust gases from the channels fed by steam may initially be vented to the atmosphere after changeover until sufficiently pure hydrogen is being produced.<br>
It will again be appreciated that there is very good thermal contact between the oxidation and reduction reactions, so that the processes are thermally integrated. The use of highly dispersed metal within a porous ceramic carrier means that it is very active, and that mass transport of reaction and product gases to and from the metal surface is far better than in the case of the use of bulk metal. The combination of good heat and<br><br><br><br>
