				<td>(Pigment preparation in granule form)<br>
The invention relates to pigment preparations in<br>
granule form comprising one or more resins, one or more<br>
effect pigments and, where appropriate, additives, the<br>
granules being notable for comprising 3-10% by weight<br>
of water or a solvent or solvent mixture having a<br>
vapour pressure at 20°C of from 0.001 to 40 hPa.<br>
In industrial processes, pigments are often not<br>
employed in the form of dry powders, since such powders<br>
produce dust, which leads to heightened requirements in<br>
terms of workplace safety. In many cases, furthermore,<br>
when introducing powders into plastics, basecoat<br>
systems, etc., agglomeration of the pigment powder is<br>
observed. Homogeneous distribution of the pigment in<br>
the respective matrix is frequently difficult if not<br>
impossible to achieve. In order to obtain the lustre<br>
effect typical of pearl lustre pigments in a<br>
formulation, extremely uniform distribution and<br>
orientation of the pearl lustre pigment particles in<br>
the binder is a necessity.<br>
In applications, pigment granules feature a markedly<br>
reduced dust nuisance and better free-flow properties<br>
than pulverulent pigment preparations, and are<br>
therefore garnering increasing interest. The additional<br>
treatment of the pigments with a resin greatly enhances<br>
the performance properties of the pigments.<br>
EP 0 134 676 B1 discloses a process for preparing non-<br>
dusting metal pigment compositions, in which the paste<br>
is prepared by mixing an organic binder medium and a<br>
metal pigment with an organic liquid vehicle. After the<br>
end of the preparation process, the organic liquid<br>
vehicle is removed from the coherent paste and the<br>
resulting solid mass is divided into particles.<br>
Solvent-free, free-flowing granules comprising pearl<br>
lustre pigments and a binder and also additives, where<br>
appropriate, are claimed, furthermore, in<br>
EP 0 803 552 B1. The granules described therein are<br>
especially suitable as precursors for printing inks.<br>
The prior art granules which have been largely freed<br>
from solvent during the preparation process, however,<br>
are comparatively difficult to dissolve again in the<br>
printing ink, and/or give rise to difficulties on<br>
dispersing. For the homogenization of the pearl lustre<br>
pigments from the granules in the formulation that is<br>
to be prepared, mechanical forces are required, which<br>
may in turn disrupt the platelets of the pearl lustre<br>
pigments, thereby adversely affecting the optical<br>
properties of the pigments.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
effect pigment formulations in the form of solid<br>
particle forms which do not have the abovementioned<br>
disadvantages and which possess a markedly higher<br>
dissolution rate in binder systems than granules which<br>
have been largely freed from solvent.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the dissolution<br>
rate of granules comprising resins and effect pigments,<br>
such as pearl lustre pigments, for example, resins and,<br>
where appropriate, additives in printing inks or<br>
coating materials can be significantly increased if the<br>
granules are not freed completely from the solvent but<br>
instead still contain a precisely defined amount of<br>
solvent.<br>
The invention accordingly provides pigment formulations<br>
in solid particle form comprising effect pigments,<br>
resins and, where appropriate, additives, characterized<br>
in that they contain 3-10% by weight, based on the<br>
granules, of a solvent which is non-volatile at room<br>
temperature: The chosen solvent or solvent mixture is<br>
selected so that it has a vapour pressure at 20°C of<br>
from 0.001 to 40 hPa.<br>
The granules of the invention are notable for an<br>
increased dissolution rate when incorporated by<br>
stirring into a binder system. Consequently, subsequent<br>
homogenization of the formulation that is to be<br>
prepared is made easier, since lower mechanical forces<br>
are needed to dissolve the granules. The introduction<br>
of foam into aqueous binder systems, and the risk of<br>
fracture of particularly coarse pigment fractions, are<br>
considerably reduced. Below the abovementioned solvent<br>
content (
the solvation or solubility of the granules, especially<br>
in solvent-containing and radiation-curing extenders,<br>
is greatly reduced. Moreover, the precise metering of<br>
the solvent content in the granules leads to better<br>
wetting of the pigment particles.<br>
The granules of the invention are non-dusting, free-<br>
flowing, are much quicker to incorporate into<br>
commercially available binder systems than the prior<br>
art granules, and are compatible in the said systems.<br>
In particular the products are compatible with aqueous,<br>
solvent-containing and solvent-free printing ink and<br>
coating systems. The inks and coating materials<br>
prepared using the granules are suitable for gravure<br>
printing, flexographic printing, screen printing,<br>
offset overprint varnish (OPV) and also for the various<br>
coating systems in the industrial coating and<br>
automotive coating sectors. They are also suitable for<br>
colouring plastics.<br>
The pigment granules of the invention contain ? 60% by<br>
weight, preferably 70-90% by weight, in particular 80-<br>
90% by weight, of effect pigments. Very particular<br>
preference is given to pigment preparations having an<br>
effect pigment content of more than 80% by weight. The<br>
percentages by weight are always based on the granules.<br>
The effect pigments referred to here are pearl lustre<br>
pigments, metallic effect pigments, multilayer pigments<br>
with transparent and opaque layers, holographic<br>
pigments, BiOCl and LCP (liquid crystal polymer)<br>
pigments.<br>
Particular preference is given to granules comprising<br>
pearl lustre pigments based on platelet-shaped,<br>
transparent or semi-transparent substrates. Examples of<br>
suitable substrates are phyllosilicates, such as<br>
natural or synthetic mica or other silicatic materials,<br>
talc, sericite, kaolin and SiO2, glass, TiO2, graphite<br>
and AL2O3 platelets. Examples of the platelet-shaped<br>
substrates are those coated with rare earth metal<br>
sulfides, such as Ce2S3, titanium suboxides, titanium<br>
oxynitrides, pseudobrookite, with coloured or<br>
colourless metal oxides, such as TiO2, (rutile or<br>
anatase) Fe2O3, Fe3O4, SnO2, ZrO2, SiO2, Al2O3, Cr2O3, ZnO,<br>
CuO, NiO, Ce2O3 and other metal oxides, alone or in a<br>
mixture, in one uniform layer or in successive layers<br>
(multilayer pigments). Pearl lustre pigments are known,<br>
for example, from German patents and Patent<br>
Applications 14 67 468, 19 59 998, 20 09 566,<br>
22 14 454, 22 15 191, 22 44 298, 23 13 331, 25 22 572,<br>
31 37 808, 31 37 809, 31 51 343, 31 51 354, 31 51 355,<br>
32 11 602, 32 35 017 and P 38 42 330 and are available<br>
commercially, e.g. under the brand name Iriodin® from<br>
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. Multilayer pigments<br>
based on mica are sold, for example, by Merck KGaA or<br>
by EM Industries under the brand name Timiron® Splendid<br>
Copper, Timiron® Splendid Gold, Timiron® Splendid<br>
Green, Iriodin® Solargold or Dichrona® Splendid.<br>
Particularly preferred are multilayer pigments based on<br>
mica having a TiO2-SiO2-TiO2 layer sequence.<br>
Particularly preferred pigment granules comprise TiO2-,<br>
Fe2O3- or TiO2/Fe2O3-coated mica, Al2O3 or SiO2 platelets.<br>
The SiO2 platelets may be coated, for example, as<br>
described in WO 93/08237 (wet-chemical coating) or<br>
DE-A 196 14 637 (CVD process) . Al2O3 platelets are<br>
known, for example, from EP 0 763 573 A1. Platelet-<br>
shaped substrates coated with one or more rare earth<br>
metal sulfides are disclosed, for example, in<br>
DE-A 198 10 317.<br>
Also suitable are metallic effect pigments, especially<br>
aluminium flakes modified for aqueous and solvent-<br>
containing systems, as sold by Eckart under the brand<br>
name Rotovario Aqua or Stapa Hydroxal® for aqueous<br>
applications, and also Variocrom® and Paliocrom®<br>
pigments from BASF, including in particular those from<br>
the Laid-Open Specifications EP 0 681 009 A1,<br>
EP 0 632 110 A1, EP 0 634 458 A1, and also LCP pigments<br>
(liquid crystal polymers). Examples of suitable effect<br>
pigments from BASF are Variocrom ED 1478, Variocrom ED<br>
1479 and Variocrom ED 1480. Likewise suitable,<br>
furthermore, are all holographic pigments known to the<br>
person skilled in the art, and also platelet-shaped<br>
pigments which have metal layers. Pigments of this kind<br>
are sold, among others, by Flex, for example, under the<br>
brand names Chromaflair Red/Gold 000, Chromaflair<br>
Gold/Silver 080, Chromaflair Green/Purple 190 and<br>
Chromaflair Silver/Green 060. The Chromaflair pigments<br>
with a particle size of about 11-13 µm consist of an<br>
opaque aluminium core and a magnesium fluoride layer of<br>
varying thickness which generates the later<br>
interference colour of the resulting pigment.<br>
Additionally, a semi-translucent chromium layer is<br>
applied as the outermost layer.<br>
The pigment granules of the invention may comprise one<br>
or more effect pigments. In many cases it is possible<br>
by using at least two different effect pigments to<br>
obtain special colour effects and lustre effects.<br>
Preferred pigment granules comprise one or two, or else<br>
three, effect pigments, especially those pigments which<br>
are based on mica and/or SiO2 platelets. Also possible<br>
are blends of the effect pigments with organic and<br>
inorganic pigments at up to 10% by weight based on the<br>
granules, in which case the total amount of pigment<br>
ought not to exceed 90% by weight, based on the<br>
granules. Blending allows colour flops to be set in a<br>
very targeted way. In particular, the addition of one<br>
or more dyes and/or organic pigments in dispersed form<br>
leads to special colour effects. It is also possible to<br>
add those substances and particles (tracers) which<br>
enable the product to be identified.<br>
As a mandatory component, the granules of the invention<br>
contain a resin or resin mixture in amounts of 4.5-30%<br>
by weight, preferably 4.5-25% by weight, in particular<br>
4.5-20% by weight, based on the pigment granules. The<br>
acid number of the resin or resin mixture used is<br>
preferably from 90 to 350, in particular from 120 to<br>
280 and, with very particular preference, from 150 to<br>
270.<br>
Suitable resins include all natural, semi-synthetic and<br>
fully synthetic resins or resin mixtures which are<br>
known to the person skilled in the art and in which<br>
effect pigments are commonly used. In particular,<br>
mention may be made here of ketone resins, aldehyde<br>
resins, cellulose and cellulose derivatives, such as<br>
alkylcellulose, hydroxycelluloser hydroxyalkylcellu-<br>
lose, cellulose acetobutyrate, cellulose nitrate,<br>
rosins, polyacrylate or polymethacrylate resins, alkyd<br>
resins, polyester resins, polyphenol resins, melamine<br>
resins, polyterpene, polyvinyl, polyvinyl chloride and<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone resins, polystyrenes, polyolefins,<br>
epoxy resins, polyurethanes, urea, aromatic-<br>
formaldehyde resins, carbamic acid, sulfonamide and<br>
sulfo polyesters.<br>
Particularly good dispersibility and redispersibility<br>
of the granules of the invention has been found if the<br>
resins used comprise modified rosins, especially<br>
styrene- and/or maleic-modified rosins, ketone and<br>
aldehyde resins, cellulose and/or cellulose<br>
derivatives, sulfo polyesters, styrene-modified<br>
maleates, polyacrylate resins or polyraethacrylate<br>
resins, and styrene-modified polyacrylate resins.<br>
Particular preference is given to rosins which carry<br>
carboxyl groups, such as maleic- and fumaric-acid-<br>
modified rosins. Modified rosins are widely available<br>
on the market and are sold, for example, by Kraemer<br>
under the brand name Erkamar. Preference is also given<br>
to styrene-modified polyacrylate resins, sold for<br>
example under the brand name Morez by Morton.<br>
A key constituent of the granules of the invention is<br>
the solvent or - solvent mixture, which is present in<br>
amounts of ? 3% by weight, but at most up to 10% by<br>
weight, in the granules of the invention. The granules<br>
preferably contain 3-7.5% by weight, especially 3-5.0%<br>
by weight, of solvent, based on the granules. The<br>
solvent component in the granules must in each case be<br>
properly adapted to the resin system used. For<br>
preparation it is possible to use water and also all<br>
non-volatile organic solvents. Examples of suitable<br>
solvents are aromatic solvents, e.g. toluenes,<br>
petroleum spirits, xylenes, mineral oils, vegetable<br>
oils, glycol ethers, such as propylene glycol monoethyl<br>
ether, propylene glycol monoethyl ether or diols, such<br>
as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol or polyether<br>
diols, aliphatic triols and tetraols having from 2 to 6<br>
carbon atoms, such as trimethylolethane, trimethylol-<br>
propane, glycerol, 1,2,4-butanetriol and 1,2,6-<br>
hexanetriol, alcohols, ketones, esters, and all other<br>
solvents from other classes of compound, or a mixture<br>
of two or three of the aforementioned solvents.<br>
Particular preference is given to solvents having a<br>
boiling point &gt; 35°C, especially &gt; 70°C. It is<br>
preferred to use those solvents which are of medium or<br>
high viscosity. Particular preference is given to<br>
solvents which are readily miscible with water. It is<br>
important that during the preparation the solvent<br>
component includes at least one solvent or solvent<br>
mixture which has a vapour pressure at 20°C of from<br>
0.001 to 40 hPa, preferably from 0.001 to 30 hPa.<br>
Particularly preferred solvents are water, polyalkylene<br>
glycol, glycol ethers, diols, aliphatic triols having<br>
2-6 carbon atoms, glycerol, 1,2,4-butanetriol, 1,2,6-<br>
hexanetriol or a mixture of two or three of the<br>
aforementioned solvents. The vapour pressures of the<br>
suitable solvents may easily be determined by the<br>
person skilled in the art or looked up in the Handbook<br>
of Chemistry and Physics, 71st Edition, 1990-1991,<br>
David R. Lide, CRC Press, chapter 6-48.<br>
Particular preference is given to polyalkylene glycols,<br>
toluene (29 hPa), xylene (10 hPa), 1,2-ethanediol<br>
(0.053 hPa), 1,2,3-hexanetriol (0.01 hPa), 1,2,3-<br>
propanetriol (0.001 hPa), and water (23 hPa). The water<br>
may also contain dissolved sorbitol or urea. Preferred<br>
polyalkylene glycols are polyethylene glycol (0.1 hPa)<br>
and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (0.8 hPa) (vapour<br>
pressures at 20°C indicated in brackets in each case<br>
are from, the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics).<br>
As a further component, the granules preferably<br>
comprise one or more neutralizing agents. Particularly<br>
suitable agents are the bases: common in the coatings<br>
sector, such as urea, urea derivatives, ammonia, amino<br>
alcohols, such as 2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanol, alkali<br>
metal hydroxides, such as KOH or NaOH, amines, the<br>
latter in the case of granules for aqueous applications<br>
preferably being organic amines of low molecular mass<br>
which are non-volatile or possess a low volatility at<br>
room temperature.<br>
In general, the pigment granules of the invention<br>
contain from 0-05 to 10% by weight of neutralizing<br>
agent, preferably from 1 to 7% by weight, in particular<br>
from 1.5 to 5% by weight, based on the pigment<br>
granules.<br>
The granules of the invention may further comprise a<br>
modifier, as a further component, in amounts of from<br>
0.05 to 10% by weight, preferably from 0.05 to 6% by<br>
weight, in particular from 0.05 to 3% by weight. The<br>
modifier used is in particular a polyalkylene oxide or<br>
polyalkylene oxide derivative, whose purpose is to<br>
enhance the strength of the granules and also their<br>
compatibility.<br>
If necessary, the addition of a redispersing agent in<br>
the form of bulky particles, such as fibres or<br>
spherical particles, for example, prevents the effect<br>
pigments treated in accordance with the process of the<br>
invention from lying on top. of one another to a notable<br>
extent as a result of steric repulsion and so exerting<br>
strong adhesion. The effect of this is that the<br>
granules of the invention are more stable and the<br>
effect pigments, after the granules have been<br>
introduced into the paint, printing ink or coating<br>
system, settle more slowly - in some cases very much<br>
more slowly - and the sediment is in any case less<br>
hard, and that no problems occur when the sediment is<br>
reagitated.<br>
The redispersing agent is used preferably in amounts of<br>
from 0 to 5% by weight, in particular from 0.05 to 3%<br>
by weight, based on the granules. All organic and<br>
inorganic fibres having a fibre length of 0.1-20 µm<br>
that are known to the person skilled in the art may be<br>
used. Suitable particles are, in particular, all<br>
synthetic fibres, e.g. those of polyethylene,<br>
polyacrylates, polypropylene, polyamides, cellulose<br>
fibres, inorganic fibres, including preferably silicon<br>
compounds, glass fibres and also, in particular, the<br>
condensation products of modified isocyanates and mono-<br>
and diamines. These condensation products, comprising<br>
diurea derivatives and also amino ureas containing<br>
urethane groups, are known as thixotropic agents and<br>
together with a binder are added to paints and coating<br>
materials in order to improve the running properties<br>
and the brushability.<br>
As redispersing agents it is also possible to use all<br>
diurea derivatives and urethane compounds that are<br>
known to the person skilled in the art, as are<br>
described, for example, in EP 0 198 519 and in Organic<br>
Coatings: Science and Technology, A.. Heenriga, P.J.G.<br>
von Hemsbergen, pp. 201-222, New York 1983.<br>
Particularly - suitable spherical materials are hollow<br>
glass, wax or polymer beads made of vinyl resins,<br>
nylon, silicone, epoxy resins, olefin resins,<br>
polystyrenes, and inorganic materials, such as TiO2,<br>
SiO2 or ZrO2, for example. It is preferred to use hollow<br>
beads, but also solid beads, having a particle size of<br>
from 0.05 to 150 Mm. In the granules of the invention<br>
it is particularly preferred to use hollow glass, wax<br>
or polymer beads.<br>
Spherical particles based on SiO2 in a particle range<br>
of 3-10 µm are known, for example, as materials for<br>
high-performance liquid chromatography and are sold,<br>
for example, as LiChrospher® by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,<br>
FRG. Such materials are preferably used in monodisperse<br>
form; that is, with a substantially uniform particle<br>
size. Monodisperse spherical particles of this type<br>
based on SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 are known. Monodisperse<br>
SiO2, for example, may be prepared in accordance with<br>
EP 0 216 278 B1. Hollow glass beads are sold, for<br>
example, under the trade name Q-CEL by PQ Corporation,<br>
USA, or Scotchlite by 3M, Frankfurt, FRG.<br>
Additionally, the granules of the invention may<br>
comprise surface-active substances, such as<br>
alkylsilanes, for example, which may also contain a<br>
further functional group, or saturated or unsaturated<br>
fatty acids or fluorosurfactants. Particular preference<br>
is given to using silane compounds of the formula<br>
(CnH2n+1)Si(OCmH2m+1)3, where n is 1-30 and m is 1-10, as<br>
surface-active substances. Examples of suitable silane<br>
compounds are n-hexyldecyltriethoxysilane and n-octyl-<br>
decyltriethoxysilane {Si 116 and Si 118 from Degussa<br>
AG, Frankfurt) and also the corresponding fluoroalkyl-<br>
silanes.<br>
As surface-active substances it is also possible to use<br>
the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, such as<br>
caproic acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid,<br>
myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid<br>
and linoleic acid, for example, and also fatty acid<br>
mixtures.<br>
The surface-active reagent may also comprise a mixture<br>
of silane, fatty acids and/or surfactants. The granules<br>
may contain from 0.1 to 5% by weight, preferably from<br>
0.2 to 3% by weight and in particular from 0.5 to 2% by<br>
weight of surface-active substances, based on the<br>
pigment.<br>
For the preparation of the granules, the pigments, the<br>
resin and/or the resin mixture, and also the additives,<br>
where present, are mixed with the solvent. The fraction<br>
of the solvent at the beginning of the preparation is<br>
between 20-40% by weight, preferably between 25-35% by<br>
weight. During the preparation of the granules the<br>
resin and/or resin mixture and also optionally further<br>
additives are preferably premixed with the solvent<br>
before being added to the pigment. This produces<br>
intensive contact between pigment and the substances<br>
required for the granulation, which at the same time<br>
ensures more uniform covering of the pigment surface.<br>
Subsequently, this mixture is gently homogenized.<br>
Preferably, the pigment is introduced as the initial<br>
charge and is first pasted up, with stirring, with the<br>
solvent containing the resin and, if desired at this<br>
stage, the modifier; subsequently, a further solution<br>
consisting of solvent and additives is added.<br>
During or after its production, further customary<br>
additives may be added to this pigment preparation,<br>
examples being defoamers, wetting agents, anti-settling<br>
agents, levelling agents, emulsifiers, siccatives or<br>
thixotropic agents. These are auxiliaries which are<br>
customary in the coatings industry and may be present<br>
in the granules of the invention in an amount of from 0<br>
to 10% by weight. Mention is made here in particular of<br>
succinate derivatives, examples being those as sold by<br>
Henkel under the brand name Hydropalat 875.<br>
To prepare the granules, the moist pigment preparation<br>
is extruded or compacted into a compact particle form<br>
by other methods known to the person skilled in the<br>
art, such as by tableting, briquetting, pelletizing,<br>
granulating, spray-granulating or fluidized-bed<br>
granulating, and then dried under precisely controlled<br>
conditions. In the course of the drying operation, the<br>
solvent content of the granules is measured<br>
continuously. Depending on the solvent used, the drying<br>
process . takes place at temperatures of from 60 to<br>
150°C, preferably at from 60 to 120°C, and may where<br>
appropriate take place under reduced pressure,<br>
preferably at 80-100 mbar. The duration of drying<br>
depends on the batch size of the preparation to be<br>
dried, its throughput in the course of drying, and the<br>
solvent used, but is generally 0.5-24 h, preferably<br>
1-18 h. As soon as the granules have a residual solvent<br>
moisture content of ? 3% by weight, but = 10% by<br>
weight, the drying operation is halted. Finally, the<br>
granules are classified where necessary.<br>
The term "granules" as used herein embraces all<br>
possible solid particle forms, such as pellets, chips,<br>
briquettes, tablets, etc. The particle sizes of the<br>
granules are situated within the range from 0.1 to<br>
150 mm, preferably from 0.1 to 20 mm, in particular<br>
from 0.1 to 6 mm.<br>
The determination of the residual solvent moisture<br>
content in the course of the preparation process takes<br>
place using a Sartorius MA 30 moisture analyzer, which<br>
works on an infrared basis. Following calibration, the<br>
water content is measured. Where further solubility<br>
enhancers are to be measured, this is done in<br>
accordance with the principle of differential weighing,<br>
since the substances to be analysed may be expelled<br>
together with the water above the previously calibrated<br>
temperature. There remains only the fraction of<br>
polymeric substance/resin and the effect pigment.<br>
When measuring the water content using the Sartorious<br>
MA 30 moisture analyzer, the following parameters may<br>
be chosen in order to find the result:<br>
Initial sample mass: 4-5 g of unground substance-<br>
Temperature: 135-160°C<br>
Time setting: 12-20 minutes<br>
Result indication: 0-100% (solvent content).<br>
The granules of the invention may be used for diverse<br>
applications. They are preferably used in coating<br>
systems from the sectors of printing, especially<br>
overprint varnishing, offset overprint varnishing,<br>
gravure, flexographic and screen printing. With<br>
particular preference, the granules as precursors for<br>
coating materials are applied to any desired substrate<br>
materials, examples being metals such as iron, steel,<br>
aluminium, copper, bronze, plastic, brass and also<br>
metal foils, and also glass, ceramic and concrete, and<br>
also wood, e.g. furniture, clay, textile, paper,<br>
packaging materials, e.g. plastic containers, films or<br>
boards, or to other materials for decorative and/or<br>
protective purposes. Furthermore, the granules of the<br>
invention are suitable in formulations for producing<br>
security features.<br>
Accordingly, the invention also provides for the use of<br>
the granules of the invention in formulations such as<br>
paints, printing inks, security printing inks, coating<br>
materials, powder coating materials, coatings such as<br>
industrial and automotive coatings, in plastics, and in<br>
cosmetics.<br>
The examples which follow are intended to illustrate<br>
the invention without, however, restricting it.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
1.1 Preparation of the granulating solution<br>
260.0 g of DI water at 50°C are introduced as an<br>
initial charge and 72 g of Rokramar 2150<br>
granulating resin (modified rosin from Kramer) are<br>
incorporated by means of a 4-paddle stirrer. Then<br>
17 g of 25% ammonia solxttion are added slowly and<br>
the mixture is stirred until the granulating resin<br>
has fully dissolved. Thereafter, 44 g of<br>
polyethylene glycol 1000 (from Merck KGaA) are<br>
added with stirring, followed by stirring for<br>
5 minutes.<br>
1.2 Preparation of the granules<br>
To prepare the granules, thorough mixing must be<br>
ensured. On the 1 kg scale, the mixture is<br>
prepared with the aid of an Eirich R02 mixer.<br>
607 g of Iriodin® 231 (TiO2/mica pigment of<br>
particle size 5-25 urn from Merck KGaA, Germany)<br>
are placed in the mixer vessel and 393 g of<br>
granulating solution from Example 1.1.are slowly<br>
added. The mixture is mixed homogeneously. The<br>
wetted mixture is granulated on a TR 01<br>
granulating plate from Eirich. The moist,<br>
granulated mixture is dried in a fluidized-bed<br>
dryer at from 80 to 120°C for 0.5-4 h, without<br>
going below a residual moisture content of 3% by<br>
weight. The granules thus prepared are first of<br>
all separated from their coarse fraction by<br>
passing them through a sieve of mesh size 2 mm and<br>
then from their fine fraction by classifying using<br>
a 400 µm sieve. The solvent content of the<br>
granules in the drying process is measured<br>
continuously using the Sartorius MA 30 moisture<br>
analyzer. The following parameters were chosen in<br>
order to find the result:<br>
Initial sample mass: 4-5 g of unground substance<br>
Temperature: 160°C<br>
Time setting: 20 minutes<br>
Result indication: 0-100% (solvent content).<br>

231.1 g of Eastek 1300 (30% sulfo polyester<br>
dispersion in water, pH = 6; density: 1.08 g/cm3;<br>
MFT: 12°C) are introduced as an initial charge and<br>
144.3 g of DI water are stirred in using a 4-<br>
paddle stirrer. This solution is used as a<br>
granulating solution to prepare effect pigment<br>
granules.<br>
11.2 Preparation of the granules<br>
624.6 g of Iriodin® 231 from Merck KGaA are placed<br>
in the mixing vessel and 375.4 g of granulating<br>
solution from Example 11.1 are slowly added. The<br>
mixture is mixed homogeneously. The wetted mixture<br>
is granulated on a TR 01 granulating plate from<br>
Eirich. The wet, granulated mixture is dried in a<br>
fluidized-bed dryer at from 80 to 120°C for 0.5-<br>
4 h, without going below a residual moisture<br>
content of 3% by weight. The granules thus<br>
prepared are first of all separated from their<br>
coarse fraction by passing them through a sieve of<br>
mesh size 2 mm and then from their fine fraction<br>
by classification using a 400 mm sieve.<br>
The granules obtained are abrasion-resistant,<br>
dimensionally stable and compatible and also<br>
readily soluble in the aqueous offset overprint<br>
varnish 350081 from Weilburger Lackfabrik.<br>
Example 12: Paint<br>
Formulations consisting of<br>
3.00% pigment granules from Example 1<br>
1.50% Monastral green 6Y spec, (from Zeneca)<br>
0.50% Cappoxyt yellow 4214 (from Cappelle)<br>
0.03% FW 200 pigment black (from Degussa)<br>
0.40% dollar aluminium Alpate 7620 NS (from Alcan Toyo<br>
Europe)<br>
Remainder: Basecoat material with 19% solids<br>
content (acrylate-melamine) and diluent<br>
mixture.<br>
Example 13: Plastic<br>
1 kg of polystyrene granules are wetted uniformly in a<br>
tumble mixer with 5 g bf adhesive. Then 42 g of<br>
granules from Example 6 are added and the components<br>
are mixed for 2 minutes. These granules are processed<br>
under standard conditions in an injection moulding<br>
machine to give small stepped plates measuring<br>
4 X-3.X 0.5 cm. The stepped plates are notable for<br>
their lustre.<br>
Example 14 (comparative)<br>
Comparison of the dissolution rates of dried<br>
granules with granules containing approximately 4%<br>
by weight of solvent in a gravure printing ink.<br>
Example 15:<br>
15.1 Preparation of the granulating solution<br>
260.0 g of DI water at 50°C are introduced as an<br>
initial charge and 72 g of Rokramar 2150 granulat-<br>
ing resin (modified rosin from Kramer) are incor-<br>
porated by means of a 4-paddle stirrer. Then 17 g<br>
of 25% ammonia solution are added slowly and the<br>
mixture is stirred until the granulating resin has<br>
fully dissolved. Thereafter, 44 g of polyethylene<br>
glycol 1000 (from Merck KGaA) are added with<br>
stirring, followed by stirring for 5 minutes.<br>
15.2 Preparation of the granules<br>
607 g of Iriodin® 305 Solargold (multilayer<br>
pigment based on mica with TiO2/Fe2O3 and SiO2<br>
layers, of partiele size 10-60 µm from<br>
Merck KGaA) are placed in the mixer vessel and<br>
393 g of granulating solution from Example 15.1<br>
are slowly added. The mixture is mixed homo-<br>
geneously. The wetted mixture is granulated on a<br>
TR .01 granulating plate from Eirich. The moist,<br>
granulated mixture is dried in a fluidized-bed<br>
dryer at from 80 to 120°C for 0.5-4 h, without<br>
going below a residual moisture content of 3% by<br>
weight. The granules thus prepared are first of<br>
all separated form their coarse fraction by<br>
passing them through a sieve of mesh size 2 mm and<br>
then from their fine fraction by classifying using<br>
a 400 mm sieve.<br>
The product is drive-resistant [sic] and dimen-<br>
sionally stable and is compatible, for example,<br>
with the customary solvent-free free-radically<br>
UV-curing Rayoflex extender varnish, 11 HF 60 (UV<br>
varnish) from Hartmann Druckfarben and with the<br>
solvent-containing extender varnish Haptobond<br>
CT 105 (based on nitrocellulose with ethanol as<br>
solvent) from Hartmann Druckfarben. The granules<br>
thus prepared also exhibit a high dissolution rate<br>
when incorporated by stirring into the said<br>
 printing ink systems.<br>
Example 16:<br>
16.1 Preparation of the granulating solution<br>
256.4 g of DI water at 50°C are introduced as an<br>
initial charge and 66 g of Morez 300 granulating<br>
resin (polyacrylate resin from Morton) are incor-<br>
porated by means of a 4-paddle stirrer. Then<br>
36.6 g of 75% 2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanol solution<br>
are added slowly and the mixture is stirred until<br>
the granulating resin has fully dissolved.<br>
Thereafter, 44 g of polyethylene glycol 1000 are<br>
added to the granulating solution with stirring,<br>
followed by stirring at 300 rpm for 5 minutes.<br>
16.2 Preparation of the granules<br>
597 g of Iriodin® 305 Solargold are placed in the<br>
mixer vessel and 403 g of granulating solution are<br>
slowly added. The mixture is mixed homogeneously.<br>
The wetted mixture is granulated on a TR 01 granu-<br>
lating plate from Eirich. The moist, granulated<br>
mixture is dried in a fluidized-bed dryer at from<br>
80 to 120°C for 0.5-4 h, without going below a<br>
residual moisture content of 3% by weight. The<br>
granules thus prepared are first of all separated<br>
form their coarse fraction by passing, them through<br>
a sieve of mesh size 2 mm and then from their fine<br>
fraction by classifying using a 400 mm sieve.<br>
The granules obtained are abrasion-resistant,<br>
dimensionally stable, compatible and also readily<br>
soluble in the aqueous offset overprint varnish<br>
350081 from Weilburger Lackfabrik.<br>
