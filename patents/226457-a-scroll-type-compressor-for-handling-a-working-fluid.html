				<td>This invention relates to a scroll-type compressor for holding a working fluid<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to scroll-type machines. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to hermetic scroll compressors incorporating<br>
a fluid injection system where the fluid injection system utilizes a fluid passage<br>
extending through the end plate of the orbiting scroll member.<br>
Background and Summary of the Invention<br>
Refrigeration and air conditioning systems generally include a compressor, a<br>
condenser, an expansion valve or an equivalent, and an evaporator. These<br>
components are coupled in sequence in a continuous flow path. A working fluid flows<br>
through the system and alternates between a liquid phase and a vapor or gaseous<br>
phase.<br>
A variety of compressor types have been used in refrigeration systems, including<br>
but not limited to reciprocating compressors, screw compressors and rotary<br>
compressors. Rotary type compressors can include the various vane type compressors<br>
as scroll machines. Scroll compressors are constructed using two scroll members with<br>
each scroll member having an end plate and a spiral wrap. The scroll members are<br>
mounted so that they may engage in relative orbiting motion with respect to each other.<br>
During this orbiting movement, the spiral wraps define a successive series of enclosed<br>
spaces or pockets, each of which progressively decrease in size as it moves inwardly<br>
from a radial outer position at a relatively low suction pressure to a central position at<br>
a relatively high pressure. The compressed gas exits from the enclosed space at the<br>
central position through a discharge passage formed through the end plate of one of the<br>
scroll members.<br>
The designers for these scroll-type machines need to have access to these<br>
enclosed spaces or pockets as they move between suction and discharge for various<br>
reasons. One reason for accessing these moving pockets is to inject oil into the pockets<br>
in order to lubricate and cool the scroll members as they compress the fluid. Another<br>
reason for accessing these moving pockets, for a refrigerant compressor, is to inject<br>
liquid refrigerant to provide cooling for the scroll members. Another reason for<br>
accessing these moving pockets is to connect these intermediate pockets to the suction<br>
zone of the compressor in order to reduce the capacity of the compressor in a capacity<br>
modulation system. Still another reason for accessing these moving pockets is to inject<br>
an additional quantity of the fluid being compressed in vapor form in order to increase<br>
the compression ratio or capacity of the scroll machine.<br>
Various prior art methods have been utilized to gain access to these moving<br>
pockets. When the access to these moving pockets does not require access from<br>
outside the hermetic shell of the compressor, such as oil injection and/or capacity<br>
modulation, the access can be achieved through either the orbiting scroll or the non-<br>
orbiting scroll, depending on the design intent for the injection system. When the<br>
access to these moving pockets does require access from outside the hermetic shell,<br>
such as liquid injection and vapor injection systems, the access is provided through the<br>
stationary or non-orbiting scroll due to the ease of communicating with a stationary<br>
scroll member rather than the moving orbiting scroll member.<br>
The continued development for fluid injection systems include the optimizing of<br>
the designs for gaining access to the moving pockets of compressed fluid. The present<br>
invention provides the art with a method of accessing the moving fluid pockets from<br>
outside the hermetic shell of the compressor through a passage extending through the<br>
end plate of the orbiting scroll member. Accessing the moving pockets from outside the<br>
hermetic shell through the orbiting scroll provides for less expensive and simpler<br>
assembly of the scroll machine as well as less expensive machining requirements for<br>
the scroll members.<br>
Other advantages and objects of the present invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art from the subsequent detailed description, appended claims and<br>
drawings.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Referring now to the drawings in which like reference numerals designate like<br>
or corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is shown in Figure 1 a<br>
hermetic shell compressor incorporating the unique fluid injection system in accordance<br>
with the present invention which is identified generally by the reference numeral 10.<br>
Scroll compressor 10 comprises a generally cylindrical hermetic shell 12 having welded<br>
at the upper end thereof a cap 14 and at the lower end thereof a base 16 having a<br>
plurality of mounting feet (not shown) integrally formed therewith. Cap 14 is provided<br>
with a refrigerant discharge fitting 18 which may have the usual discharge valve therein<br>
(not shown). Other major elements affixed to shell 12 include a transversely extending<br>
partition 20 which is welded about its periphery at the same point cap 14 is welded to<br>
shell 12, an inlet fitting 22, a main bearing housing 24 which is suitably secured to shell<br>
12 and a lower bearing housing 26 having a plurality of radially outwardly extending legs<br>
each of which is suitably secured to shell 12. A motor stator 28 which is generally<br>
square in cross-section but with the corners rounded off is press fit into shell 12. The<br>
flats between the rounded corners on stator 28 provide passageways between stator<br>
28 and shell 12 which facilitate the return flow of the lubricant from the top of shell 12<br>
to its bottom.<br>
A drive shaft or crankshaft 30 having an eccentric pin 32 at the upper end<br>
thereof is rotatably journaled in a bearing 34 in main bearing housing 24 and in a<br>
bearing 36 in lower bearing housing 26. Crankshaft 30 has at the lower end thereof a<br>
relatively large diameter concentric bore 38 which communicates with a radially<br>
outwardly located smaller diameter bore 40 extending upwardly therefrom to the top of<br>
crankshaft 30. Disposed within bore 38 is a stirrer 42. The lower portion of the interior<br>
shell 12 is filled with lubricating oil and bores 38 and 40 act as a pump to pump the<br>
lubricating oil up crankshaft 30 and ultimately to all of the various portions of<br>
compressor 10 which require lubrication.<br>
Crankshaft 30 is relatively driven by an electric motor which includes motor<br>
stator 28 having windings 44 passing therethrough and a motor rotor 46 press fitted<br>
onto crankshaft 30 and having upper and lower counterweights 48 and 50, respectively.<br>
A motor protector 52, of the usual type, is provided in close proximity to motor windings<br>
44 so that if the motor exceeds its normal temperature range, motor protector 52 will de-<br>
energize the motor.<br>
The upper surface of main bearing housing 24 is provided with an annular flat<br>
thrust bearing surfaces 54 on which is disposed an orbiting scroll member 56. Scroll<br>
member 56 comprises an end plate 58 having the usual spiral valve or wrap 60 on the<br>
upper surface thereof and an annular flat thrust surface 62 on the lower surface thereof.<br>
Projecting downwardly from the lower surface is a cylindrical hub 64 having a journal<br>
bearing 66 therein and in which is rotatively disposed a drive bushing 68 having an inner<br>
bore within which crank pin 32 is drivingly disposed. Crank pin 32 has a flat on one<br>
surface (not shown) which drivingly engages a flat surface in a portion of the inner bore<br>
of drive bushing 68 to provide a radially compliant drive arrangement such as shown in<br><br>
assignee's U.S. Patent No. 4,877,382, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Wrap 60 meshes with a non-orbiting scroll wrap 72 forming part of a non-orbiting<br>
scroll member 74. During orbital movement of orbiting scroll member 56 with respect<br>
to non-orbiting scroll member 74 creates moving pockets of fluid which are compressed<br>
as the pocket moves from a radially outer position to a central position of scroll<br>
members 56 and 74. Non-orbiting scroll member 74 is mounted to main bearing<br>
housing 24 in any desired manner which will provide limited axial movement of non-<br>
orbiting scroll member 74. The specific manner of such mounting is not critical to the<br>
present invention. However, in the preferred embodiment, non-orbiting scroll member<br>
74 has a plurality of circumferentially spaced mounting bosses 76 (see Figures 2 and<br>
3), each having a flat upper surface 78 and an axial bore 80. A sleeve 82 is slidably<br>
disposed within bore 80 and sleeve 82 is bolted to main bearing housing 24 by a bolt<br>
84. Bolt 84 has an enlarged head which engages upper surface 78 to limit the axial<br>
upper or separating movement of non-orbiting scroll member 74. Movement of non-<br>
orbiting scroll member 74 in the opposite direction is limited by axial enlargement of the<br>
lower tip surface of wrap 72 and the flat upper surface of orbiting scroll member 56.<br>
Non-orbiting scroll member 74 has a centrally disposed discharge port 88 which<br>
is in fluid communication via an opening 90 in partition 20 with a discharge muffler 92<br>
defined by cap 14 and partition 20. Fluid compressed by the moving pockets between<br>
scroll wraps 60 and 72 discharges into discharge muffler 92 through port 88 and<br>
opening 90. Non-orbiting scroll member 74 has in the upper surface thereof an annular<br>
recess 94 having parallel coaxial sidewalls within which is sealing disposed for relative<br>
axial movement an annular seal assembly 96 which serves to isolate the bottom of<br>
recess 94 so that it can be placed in fluid communication with a source of intermediate<br>
fluid pressure by means of a passageway 98. Non-orbiting scroll member 74 is thus<br>
axially biased against orbiting scroll member 56 by the forces created by discharge<br>
pressure acting on the central portion of non-orbiting scroll member 74 and the forces<br>
created by intermediate fluid pressure acting on the bottom of recess 94. This axial<br>
pressure biasing, as well as the various techniques for supporting non-orbiting scroll<br>
member 74 for limited axial movement, are disclosed in much greater detail in<br>
assignee's aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,877,382.<br>
Relative rotation of scroll members 56 and 74 is prevented by the usual Oldham<br>
Coupling 100 having a pair of key slidably disposed in diametrically opposing slots in<br>
non-orbiting scroll member 74 and a second pair of keys slidably disposed in<br>
diametrically opposed slots in orbiting scroll member 56.<br>
Compressor 10 is preferably of the "low side" type in which suction gas entering<br>
shell 12 is allowed, in part, to assist in cooling the motor. So long as there is an<br>
adequate flow of returning suction gas, the motor will remain within the desired<br>
temperature limits. When this flow ceases, however, the loss of cooling will cause<br>
motor protector 52 to trip and shut compressor 10 down.<br>
The scroll compressor, as thus broadly described, is either known in the art or<br>
it is the subject matter of other pending applications for patent by Applicant's assignee.<br>
The details of construction which incorporate the principles of the present invention are<br>
those which deal with a unique fluid injection system identified generally by reference<br>
numeral 110. Fluid injection system 110 can be used to inject liquid refrigerant for<br>
cooling purposes, vapor or gaseous refrigerant for capacity increase, oil for lubrication<br>
and cooling or fluid injection system 110 can be used for capacity modulation. The<br>
present invention, for exemplary purposes, will be described using a vapor injection<br>
system as fluid injection system 110 but it is to be understood that other fluids could be<br>
injected or fluids can be vented using fluid injection system 110.<br>
Referring now to Figures 1-3, fluid injection system 110 comprises a pair of fluid<br>
injection passages 112 extending through end plate 58 of orbiting scroll member 56, a<br>
pair of generally vertical fluid passages 114 in main bearing housing 24, a generally<br>
circular horizontal fluid passage 116 in main bearing housing 24, a generally horizontal<br>
fluid passage 118 extending through one of the legs of main bearing housing 24, a fluid<br>
injection port 120 extending through shell 12, and a fluid injection fitting 122 secured to<br>
the outside of shell 12.<br>
Fluid injection passages 112 extend through end plate 58 of orbiting scroll<br>
member 56. The positioning of the opening for passages 112 on the wrap side of the<br>
end plate will be determined by the positioning during the compression cycle that fluid<br>
is going to be injected or released from a pair of the moving pockets between wraps 60<br>
and 72. The positioning of the opening for passages 112 on thrust surface 62 of scroll<br>
member 56 will be such that the opening of passages 112 will always be adjacent thrust<br>
bearing surface 54 of main bearing housing 24 throughout the entire orbital movement<br>
of orbiting scroll member 56. This feature is described below as it relates to fluid<br>
passage 114.<br>
Fluid passages 114 each extend vertically from thrust bearing surface 54 to fluid<br>
passage 116. Each fluid passage 114 comprises a counter bored portion 124 which<br>
opens up on thrust bearing surface 54. Counter bored portions 124 are sized such that<br>
fluid communication is always maintaining with its respective fluid injection hole 112<br>
during all orbiting movement of orbiting scroll member 56.<br>
Generally circular horizontal passage 116 extends between the pair of fluid<br>
passages 114 and horizontal fluid passage 118. Fluid passage 118 extends generally<br>
horizontally through one of the legs of main bearing housing 24. Fluid passage 118<br>
opens to injection port 120 which extends through shell 12. Fluid injection fitting 122 is<br>
secured to shell 12 by welding and it includes a central bore 126 in fluid communication<br>
with port 120.<br>
Thus, access from injection fitting 122 to the moving compression pockets<br>
between scroll wraps 60 and 72 is provided through bore 126, through port 120, through<br>
passage 118, through passage 116, through passages 114 and counter bore 124, and<br>
through passages 112. Fluid can be injected into the moving pockets between scroll<br>
wraps 60 and 72 or fluid can be removed from the moving pockets between scroll wraps<br>
72 and 66 through fitting 122.<br>
Referring now to Figures 4 and 5, a fluid injection system 210 according to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. Fluid injection system 210<br>
is similar to fluid injection system 110 except that fluid injection system 210 incorporates<br>
an internal valve system 230 which can replace any type of externa! valve system<br>
incorporated with fluid injection system 110. Internal valve system 230 is disposed<br>
inside shell 12 as opposed to an external system. Internal valve system 230 comprises<br>
a slider valve 232, a valve guide support 234, a valve return spring 236 and an<br>
activating fitting 238.<br>
Slider valve 232 is slidingly disposed within a bore 240 which intersects with<br>
generally horizontal fluid passage 118. A pair of seals 242 seal the fluid within fluid<br>
passage 118 from bore 240. Slider valve 232 defines a vapor injection through hole 244<br>
and a modulation slot 246. Vapor injection through hole 244 is utilized for providing<br>
vapor injection into the fluid pockets between scroll wraps 60 and 72 to increase the<br>
capacity of the compressor. Modulation slot 246 is utilized for providing delayed<br>
compression by releasing the compressed fluid in the fluid pockets between scroll wraps<br>
60 and 72 to modulate or reduce the capacity of the compressor. The combination of<br>
the vapor injection and the delayed compression allows for an increase in the<br>
modulation of the compressor when the full capacity of the compressor is with vapor<br>
injection. Assuming a compressor without vapor injection operates at 100% capacity<br>
and, with capacity modulation due to delayed compression, the capacity is reduced to<br>
approximately 60%, the incorporation of vapor injection will increase its capacity to<br>
approximately 120%. When valve system 230 switches from vapor injection to<br>
modulation, the capacity will reduce to the original 60%. Thus, a 60% capacity<br>
modulation (100% to 60%) becomes a 50% capacity modulation (120% to 60%).<br>
Valve guide support 234 is attached to an adjacent leg of main bearing housing<br>
24 and it defines a bore 248 which slidingly receives slider valve 232 and guides its<br>
movement. Valve return spring 236 is located between valve guide support 234 and<br>
slider valve 232 to bias slider valve 232 into its vapor injection position as shown in<br>
Figure 4. Activating fitting 238 is in communication with one end of bore 240 through<br>
a bore 250 in fitting 238, a port 252 in shell 12 and a passage 254 in the leg of main<br>
bearing housing 24. Bore 250 is connected to a source of pressurized fluid, such as the<br>
discharge pressure of the compressor, through a valve such as a solenoid valve. When<br>
this pressurized fluid is provided to the end of bore 240, slider valve 232 moves from its<br>
position shown in Figure 4 to a position where modulation slot 246 aligns with fluid<br>
passage 118 to permit modulation of the capacity of the compressor through a port 260<br>
extending through main beaming housing 24. A seal 256 isolates the pressurized fluid<br>
provided through activating fitting 238. When the vapor injection feature is again<br>
desired, the pressurized fluid can be released from fitting 238 allowing valve return<br>
spring 236 to again align vapor injection through hole with passage 118 as shown in<br>
Figure 4.<br>
Referring now to Figures 6 and 7, a fluid injection system 310 according to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. Fluid injection system 310<br>
provides an alternative method for accessing the moving pockets defined by wraps 60<br>
and 72. Fluid injection system 310 comprises the pair of fluid injection passages 112,<br>
a pair of generally vertical fluid passages 314, a pair of tubing assemblies 316, a tubing<br>
connector assembly 318, a fluid injection port 320 and a fluid injection fitting 322.<br>
Fluid passages 314 each extend generally vertical from thrust bearing surface<br>
54 to the internal suction area of shell 12. Each fluid passage 314 comprises counter<br>
bored portion 124 which opens up on thrush bearing surface 54. Counter bore portions<br>
124 maintain communication with their respective injection hole 112 during all<br>
movement of orbiting scroll member 56. The lower ends of fluid passages 314 each<br>
define an enlarged bore 324 which mates with a respective tubing assembly 316.<br>
Each tubing assembly 316 extends between tubing connector assembly 318 and<br>
a respective enlarged bore 324. Each tubing assembly 316 includes a fitting 326 which<br>
engages a respective bore 324 and a tube 328 which extends between fitting 326 and<br>
tubing connector assembly 318. A seal 330 seals the interface between bore 324 and<br>
fitting 326, and a retainer 332 keeps fitting 326 disposed within bore 324.<br>
Tubing connector assembly 318 comprises a main bearing housing fitting 340<br>
and a connecting tube 342. Fitting 340 is secured to main bearing housing 24 by a<br>
plurality of bolts. Fitting 340 defines an internal bore 344 which is communication with<br>
the pair of tubes 328. Connecting tube 342 is disposed within bore 344 of fitting and<br>
extends to fluid injection fitting 322. A seal 346 seals the interface between tube 342<br>
and bore 344.<br>
Fluid injection fitting 322 extends through port 320 and is secured to shell 12 and<br>
it defines an internal bore 350 which receives the opposite end of connecting tube 342.<br>
A seal 352 seals the interface between tube 342 and bore 350. Thus, fitting 322 is in<br>
communication with pockets of compressed moving fluid defined by wraps 60 and 72<br>
through bore 350, tube 342, bore 344, tubes 328, fitting 326, fluid passages 314 and<br>
injection passages 112.<br>
Fluid injection system 310 also includes a check valve 360 which allows fluid<br>
flow from fitting 322 to injection passages 112 but prohibits fluid flow from injection<br>
passages 112 to fitting 322.<br>
While the above detailed description describes the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, it should be understood that the present invention is susceptible to<br>
modification, variation and alteration without deviating from the scope and fair meaning<br>
