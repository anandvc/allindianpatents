METHOD AND APPARATUS TO CONTROL ENGINE STOP<br>
* FOR A HYBRID POWERTRAIN SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to control systems for powertrain<br>
control systems employing electro-mechanical transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Hybrid powertrain architectures comprise torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to a vehicle driveline. A hybrid<br>
powertrain architecture reduces fuel consumption through the engine by<br>
shutting off the engine at opportune moments during ongoing vehicle<br>
operation, including events such as the vehicle stopped at a light or in traffic,<br>
or when the vehicle is operating on a downhill portion of a highway. A<br>
powertrain architecture includes, e.g., an engine and transmission system<br>
controlled and mechanized to shut off the engine, and restart it using a belt<br>
drive through an alternator, often referred to as a belt-alternator-starter (BAS)<br>
device. Other powertrain architectures include engine and transmission<br>
systems wherein one or more electrical motors generate motive torque which<br>
is transmitted to the vehicle driveline directly or through the transmission.<br>
[0003] One such transmission includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-<br>
mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive<br>
torque from a prime mover power source, typically an internal combustion<br>
engine, and an output member for delivering motive torque from the<br>
transmission to the vehicle driveline. Electrical machines, operatively<br>
connected to an electrical energy storage device, comprise motor/generators<br>
operable to generate motive torque for input to the transmission,<br>
independently of torque input from the internal combustion engine. The<br>
electrical machines are further operable to transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy potential that is<br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>
2<br>
storable in the electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors<br>
various inputs from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational<br>
control of the powertrain system, including controlling transmission gear<br>
shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical<br>
power interchange between the electrical energy storage device and the<br>
electrical machines.<br>
[0004] The exemplary electro-mechanical transmissions are selectively<br>
operative in fixed gear modes and continuously variable modes through<br>
actuation of the torque-transfer clutches, typically employing a hydraulic<br>
circuit to effect clutch actuation, including fixed gear modes and continuously<br>
variable modes. Engineers implementing powertrain systems having electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions are tasked with implementing control schemes to<br>
monitor system states and control operation of various systems and actuators<br>
to effectively control powertrain operation.<br>
[0005] Operation of the powertrain system includes selectively starting and<br>
stopping operation of the internal combustion engine. Engine stopping can be<br>
operator-initiated, wherein the vehicle operator stops the engine operation by<br>
way of, a key-off crank action. Engine stopping further comprises automatic<br>
engine stop events during ongoing vehicle operation, wherein the engine is<br>
automatically stopped by the control system. This typically occurs in response<br>
to a control system determination of an opportunity to stop the engine and<br>
referred to as a quiescent auto-stop event. The control system selectively<br>
stops operation of the internal combustion engine to optimize energy<br>
efficiency, and for other reasons.<br>
[0006] During an engine stop event, compression torque pulses are generated<br>
in unfired engine cylinders and transmitted to a transmission torque damper<br>
and the engine block, which may result in objectionable vibrations reaching<br>
the vehicle operator, especially at resonant frequencies for the powertrain and<br>
various driveline components.<br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>
3<br>
[0007] There is a need for a control scheme which effectively stops operation<br>
of an internal combustion engine and accommodates pressure pulses and<br>
vibrations including during ongoing vehicle operation. Such a system is<br>
described hereinafter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a control scheme<br>
is provided for stopping an internal combustion engine of a hybrid powertrain,<br>
including during ongoing vehicle operation. The method, preferably executed<br>
as program code in an article of manufacture comprises the following steps in<br>
the sequence set forth. First, engine operation is controlled to stop firing the<br>
engine. A damper clutch is controlled to lock rotation of the engine and the<br>
electro-mechanical transmission. Torque outputs from electrical machines are<br>
then selectively controlled to reduce engine speed. Torque outputs from the<br>
electrical machines are then selectively controlled to stop rotation of the<br>
engine substantially near a predetermined crank position.<br>
[0009] An aspect of the invention includes the powertrain comprising the<br>
internal combustion engine and first and second electrical machines and an<br>
electro-mechanical transmission selectively operative to transmit torque<br>
therebetween.<br>
[0010] An aspect of the invention includes an engine torque simulation model<br>
to accurately determine engine compression pressures in real-time to<br>
accommodate changes in engine operating conditions, based upon present<br>
engine operating conditions.<br>
[0011] These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed<br>
description of the embodiments.<br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0012] The invention may take physical form in certain parts and arrangement<br>
of parts, an embodiment of which is described in detail and illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and wherein:<br>
[0013] Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary powertrain, in<br>
accordance with the present invention;<br>
[0014] Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary architecture for a<br>
control system and powertrain, in accordance with the present invention; and,<br>
[0015] Figs. 3 and 4 are graphical depictions, in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016] The drawings are now described, wherein the depictions are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same. Referring now Figs. 1 and 2, a system illustrative of the invention is<br>
depicted, comprising an engine 14, transmission 10, control system, and<br>
driveline. Mechanical aspects of transmission 10 are disclosed in detail in<br>
commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409, entitled "Two-Mode,<br>
Compound-Split, Hybrid Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed<br>
Ratios", which is incorporated herein by reference. The transmission 10<br>
includes an input shaft 12 having an input speed, N, that is preferably driven<br>
by the internal combustion engine 14. The engine 14 has a crankshaft<br>
operatively connected via shaft 18 to a lockable torque damper device 20<br>
operative to transmit torque to the transmission input shaft 12. The lockable<br>
torque damper device includes clutch C5, which locks the torque damper<br>
device 20, thus transmitting torque directly between the engine and the input<br>
shaft 12 of the transmission. The engine has characteristic speed NE and<br>
output torque TE. When the damper device 20 is locked, the engine speed NE<br>
and output torque TE are effectively equal to the transmission input speed N,<br>
and input torque T,, with any differences comprising twisting of the<br>
components therebetween.<br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>
5<br>
[0017] The transmission 10 utilizes three planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28,<br>
and four torque-transmitting devices, i.e., clutches CI 70, C2 62, C3 73, and<br>
C4 75. Clutches C2 and C4 preferably comprise hydraulically-actuated<br>
rotating friction clutches. Clutches CI and C3 preferably comprise<br>
comprising hydraulically-actuated stationary devices grounded to the<br>
transmission case 68.<br>
[0018] There is a first electrical machine comprising a motor/generator 56,<br>
referred to as MA, and a second electrical machine comprising a<br>
motor/generator 72, referred to as MB operatively connected to the<br>
transmission via the planetary gears. Rotational positions of MA and MB are<br>
measured using resolvers 82 and 84, respectively, which are known electrical<br>
devices each comprising a stator and rotor which are operative to measure<br>
position of the electrical machines. Transmission output shaft 64 is operably<br>
connected to a vehicle driveline 90 to provide motive output torque, T0 at<br>
output speed N0to vehicle wheels.<br>
[0019] The transmission 10 receives input torque from the torque-generative<br>
devices, including the engine 14 and the MA 56 and MB 72, and referred to as<br>
'T,', 'TA', and 'TB' respectively, as a result of energy conversion from fuel or<br>
electrical potential stored in an electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The<br>
ESD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to transmission power inverter module<br>
('TPIM') 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The TPIM 19 is an element of the<br>
control system described hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2. The TPIM 19<br>
transmits electrical energy to and from MA 56 by transfer conductors 29, and<br>
the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical energy to and from MB 72 by<br>
transfer conductors 31. Electrical current is transmitted to and from the ESD<br>
74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged.<br>
TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters and respective motor control<br>
modules configured to receive motor control commands and control inverter<br>
states therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration functionality.<br>
Preferably, MA 56 and MB 72 are three-phase AC machines each having a<br>
rotor operable to rotate within a stator that is mounted on a case of the<br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
transmission. The inverters comprise known complementary three-phase<br>
power electronics devices.<br>
[0020] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising distributed control module architecture, is shown. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system synthesizes pertinent<br>
information and inputs, and executes algorithms to control various actuators to<br>
achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel economy, emissions,<br>
performance, driveability, and protection of hardware, including batteries of<br>
ESD 74 and MA and MB 56, 72. The distributed control module architecture<br>
includes engine control module ('ECM') 23, transmission control module<br>
('TCM') 17, battery pack control module ('BPCM') 21, and TPIM 19. A<br>
hybrid control module ('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and<br>
coordination of the aforementioned control modules. There is a User Interface<br>
('UI') 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle<br>
operator typically controls or directs operation of the powertrain including the<br>
transmission 10 through a request for a torque output. Exemplary vehicle<br>
operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a brake pedal,<br>
transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control. Each of the<br>
aforementioned control modules communicates with other control modules,<br>
sensors, and actuators via a local area network ('LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6<br>
allows for structured communication of control parameters and commands<br>
between the various control modules. The specific communication protocol<br>
utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus and appropriate protocols<br>
provide for robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing between<br>
the aforementioned control modules, and other control modules providing<br>
functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle stability.<br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
[0021] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: an operator torque request ('T0_REQ') output to driveline<br>
90, the input torque T, originating from the engine, clutch torque, (TCL_N') for<br>
the N various torque-transfer clutches CI, C2, C3, C4 of the transmission 10;<br>
and motor torques TA and TB for MA and MB. The TCM 17 is operatively<br>
connected to the electro-hydraulic control circuit 42, including monitoring<br>
various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and executing<br>
control signals for various solenoids to control pressure switches and control<br>
valves contained therein.<br>
[0022] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual input torque, T,, to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed, NE, to shaft 12 which translate to<br>
transmission input speed, Nb manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. Various actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23<br>
include fuel injectors, ignition modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0023] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques for each of the N clutches, i.e., CI, C2, C3, and C4,<br>
and rotational speed, N0, of the output shaft 64. Other actuators and sensors<br>
may be used to provide additional information from the TCM to the HCP for<br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure switches and<br>
selectively actuates pressure control solenoids and shift solenoids to actuate<br>
various clutches to achieve various transmission operating modes, as described<br>
hereinbelow.<br>
[0024] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, battery voltage and available battery power,<br>
referred to as a range PBAT_MiNto PBAT_MAX-<br>
[0025] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0026] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds (msec)<br>
during ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may<br>
be executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br><br>

[0027] The exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission operates in several fixed gear operating modes and two<br>
continuously variable operating modes, described with reference to Fig. 1, and<br>
Table 1, below.<br><br>

[0028] The various transmission operating range states described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches CI, C2, C3, and C4 are engaged or<br>
actuated for each of the operating range states. A first mode, i.e., Mode 1, is<br>
selected when clutch CI 70 is actuated in order to "ground" the outer gear<br>
member of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine 14 can be either on or<br>
off. A second mode, i.e., Mode 2, is selected when clutch CI 70 is released<br>
and clutch C2 62 is simultaneously actuated to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. Again, the engine 14 can be either on<br>
or off. Other factors outside the scope of the invention affect when the<br>
electrical machines 56, 72 operate as motors and generators, and are not<br>
discussed herein.<br>
[0029] The first and second continuously variable modes of operation refer to<br>
circumstances in which the transmission functions are controlled by one<br>
clutch, i.e., either clutch CI 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and<br>
torque of the electrical machines 56 and 72. Certain ranges of operation<br>
comprise fixed gear ratios achieved by applying an additional clutch. This<br>
additional clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the table, above.<br>
When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio operation of input-to-output<br>
speed of the transmission, i.e., N/N0, is achieved. The rotations of machines<br>
MA and MB 56, 72 are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism as<br>
defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed measured at shaft<br>
12.<br>
[0030] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the<br>
supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other control<br>
modules determine the operator torque request T0 R'E0, to be executed at shaft<br>
64. Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other factors, including, e.g.,<br>
road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The operating mode is determined<br>
for the exemplary transmission based upon a variety of operating<br>
characteristics of the powertrain. This includes an operator demand for<br>
torque, typically communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as previously<br>
described. Additionally, a demand for output torque is predicated on external<br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>
11<br>
conditions, including, e.g., road grade, road surface conditions, or wind load.<br>
The operating mode may be predicated on a powertrain torque demand caused<br>
by a control module command to operate of the electrical machines in an<br>
electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode. The<br>
operating mode can be determined by an optimization algorithm or routine<br>
which determines optimum system efficiency based upon operator demand for<br>
power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and<br>
MA and MB 56, 72. The control system manages torque inputs from the<br>
engine 14 and MA and MB 56, 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system optimization occurs to optimize system<br>
efficiencies to improve fuel economy and manage battery charging.<br>
Furthermore, operation can be determined based upon a fault in a component<br>
or system. The HCP 5 monitors the parametric states of the torque-generative<br>
devices, and determines the output of the transmission required to arrive at the<br>
desired torque output, as described hereinbelow. Under the direction of the<br>
HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates over a range of output speeds from slow<br>
to fast in order to meet the operator demand.<br>
[0031] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transmit torque to<br>
the transmission via shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or a<br>
compression-ignition engine. The exemplary engine states comprise normal<br>
engine operation ('ALL_CYL'), engine operation with deactivated cylinders<br>
('DEACT'), engine fuel-cutoff ('FCO'), engine fuel-cutoff with cylinder<br>
deactivation ('FCODEACT'), and engine-off ('OFF'). In normal engine<br>
operation, all the engine cylinders are fueled and fired. In the cylinder<br>
deactivation state, typically half of the cylinders, e.g., one bank of a V-<br>
configured engine, are deactivated. A bank of cylinders is typically<br>
deactivated by discontinuing fuel delivery thereto and selectively leaving open<br>
exhaust valves to reduce engine pumping losses. In the engine fuel-cutoff<br>
state, fuel delivery to all the cylinders is discontinued. In the engine fuel-<br>
cutoff with cylinder deactivation state, fuel delivery to all the cylinders is<br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>
12<br>
discontinued and a bank of the cylinders is deactivated to reduce pumping<br>
losses. The engine-off state is defined by engine input speed, NE, being equal<br>
to zero revolutions per minute (RPM), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not<br>
rotating.<br>
[0032] Referring now to Fig. 3, the control scheme to stop rotation of the<br>
internal combustion engine during ongoing vehicle operation is now<br>
described, with reference to the exemplary hybrid powertrain system of Figs. 1<br>
and 2. Prior to executing steps to stop the engine during ongoing operation,<br>
the electro-mechanical transmission is controlled to either one of the<br>
continuously variable modes of operation (i.e., Mode 1, Mode 2). The control<br>
scheme is executed in one or more of the control modules as machine-<br>
executable code operative to control elements of the hybrid powertrain to<br>
generate torque output from the electrical machines to stop rotation of the<br>
engine which is not firing. The program comprises sequentially executed<br>
steps, wherein each step is preferably substantially completed prior to<br>
executing a subsequent step. The first step comprises controlling engine<br>
operation to stop firing the engine, and can include minimizing intake<br>
manifold absolute pressure. Next, the damper lockout clutch device is<br>
actuated. Next, torque outputs from the first and second electrical machines<br>
are selectively controlled to reduce engine speed, i.e., control spindown of<br>
engine rotation. Next, torque outputs from the first and second electrical<br>
machines are controlled to stop the engine rotation substantially at or near a<br>
predetermined crank position. The previously closed engine throttle is<br>
preferably re-opened subsequent to stopping rotation of the engine. The<br>
damper clutch preferably locks rotation of the engine to the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission during the period when the engine is stopped.<br>
[0033] The engine stop event is initiated by a command from the HCP 5,<br>
resulting from control schemes focused on optimizing system efficiency and<br>
including decisions based upon exceeding system-imposed limits. The system-<br>
imposed limits comprise operating parameters of vehicle speed, battery SOC,<br>
battery temperature, battery power capability, battery voltages, engine coolant<br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>
13<br>
temperature, system thermal limits, and system diagnostics. Each of these<br>
operating parameters is monitored by one or more of the control modules, and<br>
a decision to stop the engine can be based upon one of the parameters<br>
exceeding a predetermined threshold, or a combination of the parameters<br>
exceeding predetermined thresholds coincident to one another. A decision to<br>
stop the engine can occur during a vehicle coastdown event or during steady<br>
state operation. Each decision to restart the engine includes a debounce<br>
analysis of engine start/stop events, effectively adding a hysteresis to each<br>
starting event. The debounce analysis includes, for example, tying operator<br>
behavior to an engine stop that is being initiated based upon efficiency<br>
calculations. Thus engine stops are avoided that would be unexpected by the<br>
vehicle operator, e.g., not stopping the engine when the operator is depressing<br>
the accelerator pedal.<br>
[0034] The first step comprises controlling engine operation to stop firing the<br>
engine. When the engine comprises a spark-ignition engine, stopping engine<br>
firing comprises stopping fuel delivery and spark energy. When the engine<br>
comprises a compression-ignition engine, stopping engine firing comprises<br>
stopping fuel delivery. Stopping firing the engine can include minimizing<br>
intake manifold absolute pressure (MAP). The engine minimizes MAP by<br>
closing throttle valve(s) of the engine to a minimum opening, typically zero<br>
percent open, with the engine still being fueled. Closing the throttle valve can<br>
be accomplished by controlling position of electronically-controlled intake air<br>
management valves to a zero throttle opening. Such action significantly<br>
reduces crankshaft torque oscillations during the engine stop. Engine idle<br>
speed is maintained by controlling system torque through the electrical<br>
machines MA, MB. When the spark-ignition engine is used, spark retard is<br>
ramped in to minimize engine torque generation during this period. When the<br>
compression-ignition engine is used, timing of engine fuel injection is adjusted<br>
to minimize the engine torque generation. Fuel injection is sequentially<br>
disabled according to the engine cylinder firing order, so that each combustion<br>
chamber is purged of any combustion charge prior to stopping the engine.<br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>
14<br>
When the engine mechanization includes variable cam phasing device, it is<br>
preferably controlled to a parked position during this period. The park<br>
position of the variable cam phasing device can be either one of a full-retard<br>
position and full-advance position, depending upon engine design and<br>
constraints.<br>
[0035] Subsequently the damper clutch of device 20 operative to lock rotation<br>
of the engine and the electro-mechanical transmission is actuated through<br>
clutch C5. The clutch C5 is preferably actuated as a step-input, with no ramp-<br>
in time. Because the engine MAP is at low levels, oscillations are<br>
substantially reduced and effects on system dynamics are minimized.<br>
[0036] Next, torque outputs from the first and second electrical machines are<br>
selectively controlled to reduce engine speed, i.e., control spindown of engine<br>
rotation. During this period, the engine is in fuel-cutoff mode, and the<br>
electrical machines control engine speed. A preferred engine speed<br>
deceleration rate comprises a maximum speed change that minimizes engine<br>
and system dynamics. A small amount of inertial energy is recovered, and<br>
total time to stop the engine is minimal, permitting fast turnaround for a<br>
subsequent restart event. This also serves to limit magnitude of fresh air (i.e.,<br>
a lean exhaust gas feedstream) flushed through the exhaust aftertreatment<br>
system, to limit any effect upon tailpipe emissions, and limit long-term<br>
deterioration of catalytic devices. Selectively controlling torque outputs from<br>
the first and second electrical machines to reduce engine speed comprises<br>
executing computer code comprising a system equation to determine motor<br>
torque outputs from each of the first and second electrical machines.<br>
[0037] When the exemplary transmission is operated in one of the<br>
continuously variable modes, the speed relationship between MA, MB, N, and<br>
N0 is defined as shown in Eq. 1, below:<br><br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>
15<br>
wherein N, comprises the input speed from engine 14, N0 is the transmission<br>
output speed, NA and NB are the operating speeds for MA 56 and MB 72, and<br>
bn, bn, bai, b22, are known scalar values determined for the specific<br>
application in the specific operating range state. Therefore, the determined<br>
scalar values for bn, b^, b2i, b22 are specific to each of Mode 1 and Mode 2.<br>
In this application, when the transmission output speed, N0 and N, are known,<br>
motor speeds NA and NB can be determined.<br>
[0038] System torque control and management in one of the continuously<br>
variable operating modes is preferably controlled using the torque relationship<br>
described in Eq. 2, below:<br><br>
[0039] wherein:<br>
[0040] TA is torque for MA; TB is torque for MB;<br>
[0041] T, is input torque to the transmission at shaft 12, and is based upon the<br>
engine torque;<br>
[0042] T0 is output torque from the transmission at shaft 64;<br>
[0043] N, DOT is the input speed profile of the input shaft 12 to the<br>
transmission;<br>
[0044] N0 DOT is output speed profile of the output shaft 64 of the<br>
transmission, indicative of vehicle acceleration; and,<br>
[0045] kn comprises a 2 x 4 matrix of parameters determined by transmission<br>
hardware gear and shaft interconnections and estimated hardware inertias<br>
applicable to the current drive range.<br>
[0046] Torques TA and TB are bounded by minimum and maximum limits,<br>
TA MAX, TA_MIN, TB MAX, TB_MIN, as shown in Fig. 4, which comprise limits<br>
imposed by constraints on the battery. The substance of Eq. 1 is preferably<br>
converted to an algorithm resident in one of the control modules which is<br>
executed during each 6.25 msec loop cycle. The control scheme determines<br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>
16<br>
and implements preferred parametric control values for motor torques TA, TB<br>
as described.<br>
[0047] Referring again to Fig. 4, a graphical depiction of an operating region<br>
for the exemplary system is shown, for operating the system in the<br>
continuously variable Mode 1 operation. A first operating space is defined, by<br>
a torque output range for MA 56 (TA_MIN, TA_MAX) plotted on the x-axis and a<br>
torque output range for MB 72 (TBM:N, TB_MAX), plotted on the y-axis. The<br>
torque output ranges are limited by a second operating space, defined based<br>
upon battery power limitations, i.e., PBAT MIN and PBAT MAX- Based upon the<br>
relationship described with reference to Eqs. 1 and 2, for a given fixed or<br>
constant output torque, T0, and the preferred input speed profile, N, D0T, there<br>
is an allowable range of input torques, T, MIN to T|_MAX, which can be generated<br>
and transmitted to the engine to spin the engine to meet the input speed profile<br>
N, DOT in anticipation of stopping rotation of the engine. The input speed<br>
profile N|_D0T can be determined from a predetermined controlled engine speed<br>
spindown profile, and to control engine position at engine stop, consistent with<br>
engine speed depicted in Fig. 4, to meet operator requirements and engine and<br>
powertrain constraints. The control scheme described herein can operate the<br>
electrical machines MA and MB. Thus, in the embodiment described,<br>
stopping the engine includes generating initial torque values for TA and TB,<br>
based upon known and selected values for T,, T0, N, D0T, and N0_DOT using Eqs.<br>
1 and 2. At initiation of the engine stop, the input speed profile N, D0T is<br>
determined based upon a preferred elapsed time to stop rotation of the engine,<br>
within the allowable speed profile N, D0T operating window discernible in Fig.<br>
4. Output torque T0 and output speed profile N0 DOT are previously determined<br>
values, and T, comprises engine torque. The electrical machines MA and MB<br>
are controlled through the TPIM to deliver the determined torque values for TA<br>
and TB, and the process is repeated for each cycle of the 6.25 msec loop cycle<br>
as the engine speed decreases according to the determined engine input speed<br>
profile N,_D0T. Thus the control system controls torque outputs TA and TB for<br>
MA and MB.<br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>
17<br>
[0048] Torque outputs from the first and second electrical machines are<br>
subsequently controlled to spindown and stop rotation of the engine<br>
substantially near a target crank angle position. As described above, torque<br>
outputs are controlled based upon the input speed profile N,_D0T to achieve<br>
engine stop at or near the target crank angle. The engine spindown comprises<br>
a calculated profile which equates to a predetermined number of degrees of<br>
rotation, e.g., 1000 degrees, by which the engine stops rotating. Engine<br>
spindown is calculated starting at an engine angle value, and the engine speed<br>
is closed-loop controlled to reach a final target engine angle target.<br>
[0049] The previously closed engine throttle can be re-opened subsequent to<br>
stopping rotation of the engine. Electronically-controlled intake air<br>
management valves typically have a 'park' position that is greater than zero<br>
throttle position in order to permit engine operation in the event of a system<br>
fault. Thus the intake air management valve is actively controlled to reach the<br>
zero throttle position, and comprises an electrical load. Allowing the park<br>
position reduces electrical load.<br>
[0050] The damper clutch is preferably controlled to lock rotation of the<br>
engine to the electro-mechanical transmission during periods when the engine<br>
is stopped. Co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 11/743,945 (Attorney<br>
Docket No. GP-308341-PTH-CD) entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS TO<br>
DETERMINE ROTATIONAL POSITION OF AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE,<br>
provides additional details related to using the resolvers to determine engine<br>
position, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The<br>
position information from the resolvers provides an absolute measurement of<br>
engine position and has higher measurement resolution than the crank position<br>
sensor. The resolvers are operative to provide an accurate measure of shaft<br>
angle immediately upon application of electrical power and continuously<br>
during ongoing operation, effecting improved control and accuracy.<br>
[0051] The action of locking the damper clutch C5 to lockout the damper 20<br>
during the engine stop enables the control system to cancel oscillations<br>
occurring at critical system frequencies by actively controlling torque outputs<br><br>
GP-308339-PTH-CD<br>
18<br>
from the electrical motors. Critical frequencies at which there is typically<br>
resonance include vehicle rocking occurring at about 2 Hz (30 rpm) driveline<br>
resonance occurring at about 4 Hz (60 rpm), powertrain mount resonance at<br>
about 14 Hz (200 rpm), and damper resonance in a range of 9-12 Hz (125<br>
rpm).<br>
[0052] Engine crank torque referred to as T,(crank) comprises a measure of<br>
engine crankshaft torque when the engine is unfired. The engine crank torque<br>
comprises a sum of the cylinder torques calculated for each cylinder, and is<br>
preferably determined by executing a simulation model in the control system.<br>
The simulation model calculates, in real-time, a cylinder pressure for each<br>
cylinder as a function of the engine crank angle. The cylinder pressure is<br>
based upon compression pulses generated by the action of crankshaft rotation<br>
wherein movement of each piston in each engine cylinder is resisted by air<br>
trapped within the combustion chamber of the cylinder, the resistance<br>
determined by positions of intake and exhaust valves of the engine. Each<br>
cylinder torque is determined by multiplying a torque ratio by the cylinder<br>
pressure. The torque ratio is determined for each cylinder as a function of<br>
crank angle, which encompasses changes in cylinder geometry and cylinder<br>
friction. The torque ratio is preferably a pre-calibrated array of values stored<br>
in memory, and retrievable as based upon crank angle. An exemplary method<br>
to determine the engine crank torque using a simulation model is described in<br>
co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 11/669522, (Attorney Docket No.<br>
GP-309392-PTH-CD) entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS TO DETERMINE<br>
PRESSURE IN AN UNFIRED COMBUSTION CHAMBER, which is incorporated by<br>
reference herein. The exemplary simulation model is preferably executed in<br>
one of the control modules, and determines a parametric value for the engine<br>
crank torque T,(crank) during each 6.25 msec loop. The exemplary simulation<br>
model adapts to changing operating and ambient conditions, and determines<br>
parametric values for the engine crank torque when the engine is unfired.<br><br>

[0053] Specific alternate embodiments include hybrid systems employing a<br>
single electrical machine that is selectively operatively connected to the engine<br>
to control crank rotation, including e.g., a belt-alternator-starter powertrain,<br>
and, an electro-mechanical transmission system employing a single electrical<br>
machine for torque and electrical energy generation. Another alternate<br>
embodiment comprises use of a compression-ignition engine, wherein the<br>
engine starting sequence uses fuel delivery timing and quantity to effect the<br>
starting and torque output from the engine, which is known to a skilled<br>
practitioner.<br>

the invention. The invention has been described with specific reference to the<br>
