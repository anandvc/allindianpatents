AN ELECTROMECHANICAL REMOTE CONTROL SWITCH<br>
The invention concerns an electromechanical remote control switch comprising at least one fixed contact and one mono-stable movable contact working simultaneously, which is arranged on a slider and can be moved opposite to the fixed contact by it, and a magnetic system with an exciting coil and an armature that can be moved by it, which is coupled to the slider; the said slider is pressed in the direction of an initial switch-position by means of a pull-back spring.<br>
Such remote control switches can be executed in two different versions that differ in switching behaviour. On the one hand, there are mono-stable remote control switches that are always held in an initial switch position by the pull-back spring and a second switch-position that can be taken up only as long as there is a sufficiently large voltage applied to the exciting coil. These types of remote control switches are also designated as relays or contactors.<br>
Bi-stable remote control switches (also designated as current impulse switches) can, on the contrary, have two stable switch-positions when their exciting coil is dead. A voltage impulse or a current impulse has to be applied to the exciting coil only for switching from one switching position to the other.<br>
A press switch mechanism is described in US-PS-4 404 444, which consists of a housing in which electrical connection lugs are fixed. The second essential component of the mechanism is a slider, which is assembled in a part of the housing and is movable in the direction of its longitudinal axis. This slider carries contact plates on its side faces and by means of these contact plates electrical connections can be made between the connection lugs. A helical spring, which encloses the slider and is supported with its primary end on a shoulder of the slider as well as with its other end on the front side of the housing, preloads the  slider in the direction  away from the housing. A heart-shaped connecting  link  is<br>
1<br><br>
incorporated on the topside of the slider (refer fig.2), which works together with a double-L-shaped "stop member": The first leg extending upwards works as a pivot pin and is. mounted in a hole on the housing. The second leg extending down engages the heart-shaped connecting link (refer fig.4). By the combination of the "stop members" with the heart-shaped connecting link, the slider undertakes the operation, i.e. the shitting in the direction of its longitudinal axis for two stable positions. The switch can be converted to a mono-stable switch relatively easily, as the "stop member" can be easilv taken out.<br>
FR-A-2 014 488-describes an electromagnetic switch with a magnetic coil, an L-shaped yoke and a swivelling hinged armature mounted on it. This armature shifts a switch lever running parallel to the coil's longitudinal axis and carrying a pin. A slider is arranged parallel to the switch lever, which presses on a contact spring with its free end. A part in the form of an isosceles triangle, which has a step in the area of its hypotenuse, is incorporated in the slider. The pin engages this triangle. A pawl lies on the face of the slider turned towards the magnetic coil, which is connected to the slider swivelling around the axis. This pawl has on its free end a nose lying in the area of the triangular part. On the other side of the slider lies an additional lever on an oblique plane, which projects into the part. Bi-stable switching behaviour results thus:   The pin, attracted by the armature, comes to rest in the step and shifts the slider down. With that, the nose of the pawl reaches below the fixed point arranged on the coil body flange and is swivelled behind this fixed point due to the initial tension of the lever by means of the spring by which the slider is hooked up in this position. With the dropping of the armature, the pin slides along the lower limiting surface of the oblique plane and comes finally to rest in the upper section of the part as illustrated in fig.2. Attracted again by the armature, the pin slides along the upper limiting surface of the oblique plane and comes in contact with the pawl, swivels it and that loosens the hooking of the nose to the fixed point. The switching slider is released with that and can move up again. The pin finally comes to rest again - as illustrated in fig.3 of FR-A1-2 014 488 - on the step .<br>
It is the task of the present invention to develop an electromagnetic remote control switch of the type cited at the beginning with which a bi-stable switching behaviour can be achieved with as few components as possible and which can be easily assembled. Further, this bistable remote control switch should be convertible into a mono-stable remote control switch very easily<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an electromechanical remote control switch, comprising at least one fixed contact and a monostable movable contact which cooperates with the same and is arranged on a slide and is movable by the same relative to the fixed contact, said slide is pressed by means of a restoring spring in the direction of a first switching position, with a link being incorporated in the surface of the slide for the purpose of bistable contact actuation and a pin being provided which engages in said link and is fixed on a rocker which is held in a swivelable manner parallel to the slide surface comprising the link, and with the link comprising a tip extending in the direction of displacement of the slide and straight sections which are adjacent thereto and are arranged in a V-like manner with respect to each other and are mutually separated from each other by an approximately V-shaped contact, characterized in that a magnetic system with an excitation coil and an armature are provided which is movable by the same and is coupled with the slide, in that the link comprises two bent parts which are* adjacent to the straight sections and converge into each other in the region above the v-shaped contact, in that the floor of one of the straight sections of the link is provided with a ramp which starts in the region adjacent to the bent part, rises in the direction of the tip and ends with an edge of the V-shaped contact and in that a spring is provided which pretensions the rocker in the direction of one of the two wings of the link.<br>
-2A-<br><br>
As per the invention, a connecting link is incorporated on the surface of the slider for the bistable contact-operation and a pin is provided to engage this connecting link, which is fixed on a rocker, which is mounted in such a way that it can be swivelled parallel to the slider-surface having the connecting link.<br>
The connecting link is part of the slider, which is provided anyway, and hence does, not increase the component cost of the remote control switch. Since the slider is produced mostly as an injection moulded part made of plastic, the connecting link can be formed very easily by providing a corresponding form on the inner wall of the injection mould used for the production of the slider. Therefore, the production process of the slider - leaving aside the one-time production of the mould-form required - is not impaired negatively. The additional rocker with pin fixed in it is a component of very simple shape and can hence be manufactured easily.<br>
The bi-stable switch behaviour of the remote control switch as per the invention can be very easily converted to a mono-stable one in which the rocker is omitted. In case both bi-stable as well as mono-stable remote control switches have to be manufactured, then all the components of both the types can be manufactured of the same type with the same tools, with resultant cost saving.<br>
Just incorporating or omitting the rocker during assembly leads to the difference between the bi-stable and mono-stable remote control switches.<br>
Further, it may be necessary to supply an exciting coil with a different number of turns. Only short voltage impulses are applied to current impulse switches, because of which their coils are built with relatively higher capacity in order to be able to create sufficiently strong magnetic forces with the short voltage impulses for the switching operation. On the other hand, exciting coils of relays are built with lower capacity, since the voltage is applied to them for a longer time.<br>
The exciting coils can be produced with identical geometrical dimensions in spite of the different number of turns so that all other components of the magnetic system and the remaining remote control switch modules can be produced identically.<br><br>
According to an especially favoured version of the invention, the connecting link can be<br>
designed approximately in heart-shape.<br>
The bi-stable contact-operation can be undertaken very reliably with a connecting link of such shape.<br>
Developing the invention further, the connecting link can be designed to have a tip running in the displacement-direction of the slider, straight sections arranged in the form of a V to each other and separated from each other by a somewhat V-shaped structure, as well as two curves that connect to the straight sections and meet in the area above the V-shaped structure added on to it.<br>
In a connecting link formed in such a way, the pin can slide without Jamming and this leads to a higher functional reliability of the remote control switch.<br>
The provision of a spring, which pre-loads the rocker in the direction of one of the two wings of the connecting link, is especially advantageous since the running path of the pin within the connecting link can be specified reliably with it.<br>
In this connection, one consideration is to form the spring as a helical compression spring supported at one end on the inner side of the bottom shell of the remote control switch housing and at the other end on the rocker.<br>
These types of springs are functionally reliable standard components and do not require any special production set up whereby the technical manufacturing expenditure of the remote control switch, as per the invention, can be kept low, Further, sufficient force can be produced for local application with such helical compression springs.<br>
Developing the invention further, it is possible to provide studs on the rocker on which the spring-ends are fixed.<br>
With that, sideways deviation of the spring that can lead to the impairment of normal functioning of the remote control switch is effectively avoided.<br><br><br>
Further, the floor of one of the straight sections of the connecting link is provided with a ramp which begins in the area connecting to the curve, climbs in the direction of the tip and ends with an edge that runs aligned to the edge of the V-shaped structure lying in the area of the other straight section.<br>
This way the pin, despite its preliminary tension, cannot run into the straight section of the connecting link provided with this ramp, but gets into the other straight section of the connecting link. Consequently, the path of movement of the connecting link is absolutely fixed, so that the exact shape of this connecting link can be adapted to this only possible movement-path and can be made especially free of rubbing or jamming.<br>
According to the particularly preferred version of the invention, the pull-back spring is<br>
executed as a helical compression spring supported with its primary end on a part of the housing, preferably an intermediate shell, and its other end fixed on the slider.<br>
These types of springs are functionally reliable standard components and do not require any special production set up whereby the technical manufacturing expenditure of the remote control switch, as per the invention, can be kept low. Further, sufficient force can be produced for local application with such helical compression springs.<br>
In this connection, plug forms can be provided on the slider and housing, on which the ends of the pull-back spring are fixed.<br>
With that, sideways deviation of the spring, which can lead to the impairment of the normal functioning of the remote control switch, is effectively avoided.<br>
Developing the invention further, it can be provided with a rocker having two cylindrical formations, which engage the inlets in the housing of the remote control switch, in which these inlets have a slightly larger diameter than the formations. This type of mounting can be manufactured without difficulty and has particularly low friction, contributing to problem-free functioning of the remote control switch.<br>
According to a preferred version of the invention, it is also possible to provide peg-shaped inlets that are incorporated in the front sides of plates separated from one another and<br><br><br>
turned towards the intermediate shell formed on the inner side of the bottom shell and that plates, which are separated from one another and are formed on the intermediate shell in which the plates of the bottom shell and intermediate shell are aligned with each other while aligning the intermediate shell, which is set on the bottom shell.<br>
The rocker can be inserted very easily in the inlets formed in this way and necessary technical expenditure for the assembly of the remote control switch as per the invention can be kept especially low.<br>
A hinged armature relay is described in DE-A1-37 07 491. The magnet system has an armature, which acts on linear movable operating bridges. These operating bridges carry the respective movable switching contacts, which are designed in the form of contact plates and work together with fixed switching contacts. The description of the DE-A1-37 07 491 mentions several times that the two operating bridges are two components executed separately from each other.<br>
EP-A2-440 953 relates to a reclosing interlock for a relay. Here, only the armature of the relay as well as the (contact) operating element executed in the form of a linear movable slider controlled by it is shown. Two contact springs are arranged at the end of this operating element turned away from the armature, which carry contacting pieces. Consequently, it is planned to arrange the movable contacts of two switching sections on a single slider common to both switching sections; however, it is not indicated whether this slider is designed with a removable arm.<br>
The contact springs could be held in cages as per the scheme depicted in fig. 3 and 4. An accurate statement need not be made regarding this, since the verbal description does not go into this in detail, but indicates the contact spring mounting only as an "intermediate member". However, it is clear from the drawings that the sidewalls of these intermediate pieces run straight.<br>
A multi-polar relay is described in JP-A-59 025 135, the armature of which acts on a slider via a rocker arm or can shift it linearly. This slider has a total of four openings, in which rectangular contact plates that carry contact pieces at their respective two free ends are assembled. The contact plate is pressed by means of a helical compression spring lying<br><br><br><br><br><br>
likewise within the opening against the front face of the opening. The side limiting faces of<br>
these openings run parallel to the movable direction of the slider.<br>
A further task of the present invention is to present an electromechanical remote control switch of the type defined in more detail below. The said remote control switch is characteristically easy to assemble. Further, the said remote control switch should be easy to convert from the basic version comprising two simultaneously operated switching sections to a remote control switch having only one switching section.<br>
The remote control switch as per the invention has two switching sections, of which each comprises at least one fixed contact and one movable contact simultaneously, in which the movable contacts of both the switching sections are arranged on a common slider and can be moved opposite to the fixed contacts by it. Further, the remote control switch has a magnetic system with an exciting coil and an armature that can be moved by it, which is coupled to the slider; the said slider is pressed in the direction of an initial switch-position by means of a pull-back spring and has in the area of the movable contacts two arms separated from each other by a slot with each arm carrying at least one movable contact piece of a switching section respectively.<br>
For solving the additional task mentioned it is provided, as per the invention, with at least one section of the first arm, preferably the entire first arm, designed as a separate component that can be fixed to the additional slider.<br>
This permits, while assembling the remote control switch, to insert the slider at first in the bottom shell of the housing without the first arm and subsequently to set up the intermediate shell, which separates the two switching sections from each other and which passes through the slot between the two arms. Finally, the first arm can be fixed to the additional slider. By this, an intricate insertion of the intermediate shell into the slot between the arms that is necessary in the case of the single-piece design of the first arm with the additional slider, referred to earlier, can be removed.<br>
Further, a single-pole remote control switch having only one switching section can be realised simply by omitting the first arm and the electrically conducting components of the switching section assigned to this first arm. If both two-pole as well as single-pole remote<br><br><br>
control switches have to be manufactured, then alt components, especially the housing, the magnetic system and the slider, of both the product types can he manufactured identically with the same tools and therefore at lower cost. While assembling, single-pole and two-pole remote control switches have to be differentiated merely by incorporating the first arm and the electrical components of the first switching section.<br>
Developing the invention further, it can be provided with a dovetail-shaped slot that is incorporated in the first arm designed as separate from the additional slider, with the first arm set in a corresponding guide formed in the additional slider.<br>
With this, the first arm can be fixed to the additional slider very easily and reliably as well as without using any auxiliary material such as adhesive.<br>
A further task of the present invention is to present an electromechanical remote control switch of the type defined in detail below, by which the movable contact/contacts are lifted up very reliably, especially even if they are welded tenuously to the fixed contacts.<br>
The remote control switch as per the invention has at least one fixed contact and a movable contact working simultaneously, which is arranged on a slider and can be moved opposite to the fixed contact by the slider and a magnetic system with an exciting coil and one armature that can be moved by the slider. The armature is linked to the slider, the slider is pressed in the direction of an initial switch position by means of a pull-back spring, the slider has a cage for holding at least one movable contact formed out of the two side-walls running in the sliding direction of the slider as well as cover plates connecting these, and at least one movable contact is arranged on an approximately rectangular plate, the said plate is placed between the sidewalls of the cage and is pressed against one of the cover plates by means of a compression spring arranged within the cage.<br>
For the solution of the task mentioned as per the invention, the inner surfaces of the sidewalls of the cage run parallel to each other and at an acute angle inclined to the sliding direction of the slider.<br>
With the movement of the slider, which leads to a lifting up of a movable contact from the fixed contact assigned to it, at first the inner surfaces of the cage-sidewalls slide along the<br><br><br>
plates carrying the movable contact and shifts this back to the sliding direction of the slider. Moreover, the movable contact is shifted sideways opposite to the fixed contact, whereby any welding of these two contacts is broken.<br>
An acute angle in the range of 3° to 5° has proved to be favourable, since it allows sufficient displacement of the contacts for breaking the above-mentioned welded contacts, but at the same time the small amount of relative movement between the slider and the plates carrying the movable contacts is not perceptibly diminished.<br>
Developing the invention further, it is possible to provide the compression spring designed as a helical compression spring supported with one end on the plate and with the other on one of the cover plates of the cage.<br>
These types of springs are functionally reliable standard components and do not require any special production set up whereby the technical manufacturing expenditure of the remote control switch as per the invention can be kept low. Further, sufficient force can be produced for local application with such helical compression springs.<br>
In this connection, according to a preferred version of the invention, dome-shaped forms are provided on the plates and on one of the cover plates of the cage, on which the ends of the compression springs are fixed.<br>
With that, a sideways deviation of the spring, which can lead to the impairment of the normal functioning of the remote control switch, is effectively avoided.<br>
US-PS-5 260 677 refers to a relay, the magnetic system of which is illustrated very clearly in fig.3 of this patent. One recognises in this drawing the magnetic core as well as the yoke running parallel to it, which is designated here as "field return plate". The hinged armature is mounted swivelling on the top face of this "field return plate". The 'field return plate" is a single piece executed with its "laterally spaced posts", which projects above the hinged armature.<br><br>
8A<br><br>
A further task of the present invention is to present an electromagnetic remote control switch of the type defined in detail below, in the magnetic system of which large forces can be produced on the armature in each position.<br>
The remote control switch to be developed has at least one fixed contact and one movable contact working simultaneously, is arranged on a slider and can be moved opposite to the fixed contact by the slider and a magnetic system with an exciting coil and an armature that can be moved by the slider. The armature is linked to the slider, the said slider is pressed in the direction of an initial switch position by means of a pull-back spring, a magnetic core is arranged inside the exciting coil, which remains in magnetically well-conducting connection with a yoke running approximately parallel to the longitudinal axis of the coil. On the face of the said yoke the armature is mounted in such away that it can be swivelled in the area of its first face.<br>
For the solution of the task mentioned, as per the invention the armature bearing plates are fixed to the side faces of the yoke and project above the front side of the yoke and the section of the armature lying there.<br>
A magnetic flow can develop with relatively higher strength on this armature bearing plates independent of the position of the armature, by which large forces can be exerted on the armature independent of its position. High functional reliability of the magnetic system results from this and with that of the entire remote control switch.<br>
The invention is described in detail with reference to the enclosed drawings, in which especially preferred versions of the design are illustrated. Besides, fig. 1 and fig. 2 show an electromagnetic remote control switch as per the invention comprising two switching sections with top shell removed in the oblique plan, in which one movable contact 2 is provided per switching section respectively and whose connection with a rigid current bar is realised differently;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a preferred version of an electromagnetic remote control switch as per the invention, comprising two switching sections with top shell removed in the oblique plan, in which two movable contacts 2 are provided per switching section;<br>

Fig. 4 shows the magnetic system 8 of an electromechanical remote control switch as per the invention with the slider 7 in oblique plan;<br>
Fig. 5 shows that shown in fig. 4, in which the rocker 17 is also represented; Fig. 6 shows the slider 7 with the rocker 17 in oblique plan;<br>
Fig. 7 shows that as shown in fig. 3, in which the intermediate shell 21 is represented as detached from the bottom shell 23 and the rocker 17 is omitted;<br>
Fig. 8 shows that as shown in fig. 3, the slider 7 is in its second switching position; and<br>
Fig. 9 shows an alternative version of the heart-shaped connecting link 15 set in the slider 7.<br>
An electromagnetic remote control switch as per the invention comprises at least one contact-break distance just like the already known switching device. Each contact-break distance has at least one fixed contact 1 and at least one movable contact 2. These two contacts 1,2 act together in so far as they enable the opening and closing of a circuit current connected to them.<br>
As represented in fig. 1, the fixed contact 1 is fixed on a bus bar 3, which runs into a connecting terminal reserved for it, not illustrated in the enclosed drawings, with its end section 3,'. The movable contact 2 is connected to an additional bus bar, 5 via a movable conducting cable 4, whose end section 5' runs into a second, also not represented, connecting terminal. Instead of the conducting cable 4, a bus bar 59, of nominal thickness and hence elastic, can also be provided (refer fig. 2). The movable contacts 2 are individually arranged on a slider 7 and can be moved opposite the fixed contact 1 by it. An electric circuit, which should be switched with the remote control<br>
9<br><br>
switch as per the invention, can be connected to this via the said connection terminal. The remote control switch as per the invention is designed so that it can installed in a switch cabinet, for which its housing comprises a suitable bottom shell 23 and a top shell that can be set up on this (not illustrated in the enclosed drawings).<br>
The remote control switch as per the invention, as represented in the enclosed drawings, is designed comprising preferably two contact-break distances that can be actuated simultaneously by a single slider 7. In order to isolate these two sections electrically from each other the housing has an intermediate shell 21 in addition, which lies between the top sh'ell and the bottom shell. All the details described below as inventive can be applied without reservation also for the execution of the contact-break distance according to fig. 1 or fig. 2, irrespective of the fact that they are discussed below based on the preferred version of a contact-break distance represented in fig. 3.<br>
The contact-break distance of fig. 3 has, as against the above two executions, two fixed contacts 1, which are fixed at a short distance to each other and on a rigid bus bar 3 and 5 respectively. Two movable contacts 2 are provided, which are fixed on an electrically conducting plate 6, in which the distance between the movable contacts 2 corresponds to that of the fixed contacts 1.<br>
The plate 6 is arranged on a slider 7 - as described below in more detail - by which the slider 7 also remains in active connection with the two movable contacts 2 and these can move opposite to the fixed contacts 1.<br>
A magnetic system 8 is provided to drive the slider 7. tn order to be able to operate the slider 7 by hand as well, an operating knob 36 is provided at the top and it projects through the bottom shell 23 through an opening.<br>
The magnetic system comprises an exciting coil 9 and an armature 10 that can be moved by it. In the execution example represented in the enclosed drawings, a magnetic core 11 is arranged within the exciting coil 9, which remains in a magnetically well-conducting connection with a yoke 12 running approximately parallel to the longitudinal axis of the coil. The armature 10, executed as a flat plate, is mounted on the front-side 61 of this yoke 12 in such away that it can be swivelled<br>
10<br><br>
around its first front-side and thus is executed as a hinged armature (refer fig. 4 and 5). This mounting is so implemented that the armature 10 is supported with an edge of its front side on the yoke front side 61. An elastic metal strip 62 is fastened to the yoke 12, which rises above the yoke front side 61 and has a section 63 bent in the direction of the armature 10, with which it embraces the armature 10. The elastic metal strip works simultaneously as an armature spring with the section 63.<br>
The armature 10 projects into a slot-shaped receiver 13 of the slider 7 in the vicinity of its second front side and is coupled to the slider 7 in this way. The slider 7 is movable in the sliding direction 14, symbolised by the arrow, mounted in the housing of the remote control switch and is movable in this sliding direction 14 of the armature 10.<br>
The armature bearing plates 60, which are fixed on the side faces of the voke 12. is the salient feature of this magnetic system 8. They are the front side 61 of the voke 12 as well as the section of the armature 10 lying in the vicinity of this front side 61. Always a relatively larger magnetic flow is possible over these armature bearing plates 60, especially when the armature 10 is at an elevated position from the magnetic core 11 as illustrated in fig. 4 and 5. Thus relatively larger magnetic force can be exerted on the armature 10 that leads to high functional reliability of the magnetic system 8.<br>
Further, a pull-back spring 20 acts on the slider 7, which presses the slider 7 in the initial switch position as represented in fig. 3. This pull-back spring 20 is executed as a helical pressure spring, which is supported with its.first end on a part of the housing, preferably the intermediate shell 21, which separates the two contact-break distances from each other, and whose other end lies on the slider 7. In order to ensure a stable fixing of the pull-back spring 20 to the slider 7 and to the housing (to the intermediate shell 21), pin-shaped formations 22 are provided in the vicinity of the slider 7 and housing, on which the ends of the pull-back spring 20 are fixed (refer fig. 7 for the formation 22 fixed to the housing, i.e. to the intermediate shell 21).<br>
If a voltage is applied to the exciting coil 9, a magnetic force is created on the armature 10, which is greater than the force produced by the pull-back spring 20, so that the slider 7 can be moved against the pull-back spring 20.<br>
11<br><br>
It also, falls within the framework of the present invention and within the range of protection of the related claims to desiar the magnetic system differently with armature 10 that is movable by the exciting coil 9 constructed as movable pin mounted within the coiling form of the exciting coil 9 as well as this being, for example, provided for   impact armature triggers for the circuit breaker.<br>
In the case of a remote control switch comprising the components discussed earlier, at the minimum one movable contact 2 working together with at least one fixed contact 1 is mono-stable, since the pull-back spring 20 presses the slider 7 - and with it minimum one movable contact 2 - in the direction of the initial switch position.<br>
For the remote control switch to behave as a bi-stable switch, thus providing bi-stable contact operation, a connecting link 15 is incorporated in the surface of the slider 7. This is designed preferably, as represented in the enclosed drawings, approximately as heart-shaped, but it can also have another shape - as this approximate heart-shaped connecting link has been illustrated in connection with the discussion of the functioning.<br>
A pin engages in this connecting link 15, which is fixed on a rocker 17. This rocker 17 is mounted in such a way that it can be swivelled parallel to the slider-surface having the connecting link 15 in the housing of the remote control switch.<br>
This mounting is realised by means of two cylindrical formations 18 on the rocker 17, which engage inlets 19 incorporated in the housing. One of these formations 18 is visible in fig. 5, the second one lies on the surface of the rocker 17 lying opposite, which is not visible in fig. 5. The inlets 19 for the carrying of the cylindrical formations 18 have somewhat larger dimensions than the formations 18, by which the rocker 17 can also be swivelled slightly usually in the sliding direction 14.<br><br>
The inlets 19 are preferably not designed as fully cylindrical, aligned to each other and<br>
lying in the spacing of the thickness of the rocker 17 holes, since the fitting of the<br>
	rocker 17 in such holes would be difficult. As can be recognised in fig. 7, the inlets 19<br>
	are incorporated in the bottom shell 23 and have a slot-shaped form. Preferably, these<br>
12<br><br>
inlets 19 have semi-cylindrical bottoms, whose diameter is slightly larger than that of the formations 18.<br>
Two plates 24 are formed on the inner wall of the bottom shell 23, in whose front sides, turned towards the intermediate shell 21, one such inlet 19 is incorporated respectively. The distance between these two plates 24 corresponds to the thickness of the rocker 17 in the vicinity of its formations 18. The rocker 17 is set in the spacing between the plates 24, in which the formations 18 are in the inlets 19.<br>
Likewise, plates 24 separated from each other are formed on the intermediate shell 21. The plates 24 and 24' are so arranged that they run aligned to each other with the setting of the intermediate shell 21 on the bottom shell 23 and come to lie with their front sides on each other or separated from each other only by a short distance. The inlets 19 of the plates 24 arranged in the bottom shell 21 are closed at the same time by the plates 24' of the intermediate shell 23 and the formations 18 are enclosed in the inlets 19.<br>
The heart-shaped connecting link has preferably the asymmetrical shape as represented in the fig. 1-8. This comprises a tip running in the sliding direction 14 of the slider 7 as well as straight sections 25 and 29, which are arranged connected to this tip 24 (refer fig. 6). The straight sections 25 and 29 are arranged V-shaped to each other and are separated from each other by a somewhat V-shaped structure 27. A curve 26 and 28 connects to each of these straight sections 25 and 29, while the two curves 26 and 28 converge in the vicinity above the V-shaped structure 27.<br>
The heart-shaped connecting link 15 and the pin 16 arranged on the rocker 17 form an interlocking device, which functions as follows:<br>
The pin 16 is in the tip 24 of the heart-shaped connecting link 15 of the remote control switch depicted in fig. 3 and 5 and 6. The contact-break distance of the remote control switch recognisable in the fig. 3 is cut-out since the movable contacts 2 are lifted from the fixed contacts 1.<br>
13<br><br>
If a voltage is applied to the excitina coil 9 in this situation, the slider 7 is shifted towards the bottom (direction indication refers to the position of the remote control switch depicted in fig. 3). During this movement, the pin 16 passes at first the tin 24 running in the sliding direction 14 and subsequently the right straight section 25 of the connecting link 15. The curve 26 connecting to this straight section 25 leads the pin 16 over the somewhat V-shaped structure 27, this is entered in fig. 6 schematically with continuous line. During this passage of the pin 16 through the connecting link 15, the rocker 17 is swung slightly, at first in the clockwise direction (until the pin 16 has reached the curve 25) and then in the counter-clockwise direction.<br>
If the exciting coil 9 becomes dead, the pull-back sprinq 20 can press the slider 7 towards the top. Thereby the somewhat V-shaped structure 27 is shifted in the direction of the pin 16 until it lies on the structure 27 (refer dash-dotted entered position of the pin 16). Consequently, the slider 7 can no longer return to the, position depicted in fig.. 3, but will have the position depicted in fig. 8, in which the movable contact 2 of the contact-break distance as depicted in fig. 3,8 lies on the fixed contact 1 and consequently this contact-break distance is closed. Consequently, this second switching position is a switching position that can be held (stable) also for a dead situation of the exciting coil 9.<br>
A movement of the slider 7 back to the switching position depicted in fig. 3 can occur by a further voltage impulse applied to the exciting coil 9: The slider 7 is moved again by such a further voltage impulse towards the bottom by which the pin 16 is moved in the curve 28 of the left wing of the heart-shaped connecting link 15 (refer dotted depiction of the pin 16 in fig. 6). After the voltage impulse has subsided, the pull-back spring 20 can move the slider 7 towards the top, whereby the pin 16 arrives back at the tip 24 of the connecting link 15 via the left straight section 29. The slider 7 can now be moved again to the switching position depicted in the fig. 3, in which the contact-break distance as depicted in fig. 3 is open.<br>
The remote control switch can, deviating from the earlier executions, also be operated by hand, for which the slider 7 - as already explained above - is provided with an operating knob 36 projecting through an opening of the bottom shell 23. But the<br>
14<br><br>
interlocking mechanism formed from pin 16 and connecting link 15 functions for the manual slider operation entirely in the same way.<br><br><br><br>
To ensure that the pin 16 always takes the path running against the clockwise direction through the connecting link 15 as just discussed, the following two measures are planned: At first there is a spring 30, which preloads the rocker 17 in the direction of the left wing of the connecting link 15. By "Wing of the connecting link 15" is to be understood, in the framework of this description and the connected claims respectively, the totality of a straight section 25 or' 29 and the curve 26 or 28 connecting to it. In an exemplary embodiment, the ore-stress of the rocker 17 in the direction of the left connecting link-wing is the same as to pre-stress the rocker in the direction of the riaht connecting link-wing, in which case the connecting link 15 must be executed such that its axis runs mirrored to the sliding directions.<br>
This spring 30 is designed as a helical pressure spring in the preferred version of the enclosed drawings, which is supported on one end on the inner wall of the bottom shell 23 and the other end on the rocker 17. For stable fixation of spring 30, pin-shaped formations 37 can be provided both on the rocker 17 as well as on the bottom shell 23, analogous to the pull-back spring 20, on which the ends of the spring 30 are fixed.<br>
The force produced by this spring 30 on the rocker 17 ensures that the pin is always pressed in the direction of the left wing of the connecting link 15 and with this takes up the positions depicted with continuous, dash-dotted and dotted line.<br>
One could manage without this spring 30, if its function (pressing the rocker 17 in the direction of left wing of the connecting link 15) is achieved in a different way. This can, for example, take place if the rocker 17 is arranged slightly inclined to the direction of the left connecting link-wing, with which the end of the rocker 17 provided with the pin 16 is pressed by the force of gravity in the direction of the left wing of the connecting link.<br>
In order to prevent the pin 16 from entering into the left straight section 29 after leaving the tip 24, the floor of this straight section 29 is provided with a ramp 31, which begins<br>
15<br><br>
in the vicinity connecting to the curve 28 and climbs in the direction of the tip 24. The ramp 31 ends with an edge 33, which runs aligned to the edge 32 of the V-shaped structure 27 lying in the vicinity of the straight section 25. The foot-end of the pin 16 slides along this edge 33 on leaving the tip 24 and cannot therefore enter into the left straight section 29, but must run in along the edge 32 of the V-shaped structure 27 into the right straight section 25.<br>
If the rocker 17 is pre-stressed in the direction of the right wing of the connecting link, the ramp 31 just discussed must be arranged in the right straight section 25 of the connecting link 15.<br>
An alternative execution of the heart-shaped connecting link 15 with regard to the construction that can be thought of likewise is to design this as perfectly symmetrical, thus with identical left ana rignt wings (refer fig. 9). In this case the pin 16 comes in contact with the edge 34 of the V-shaped structure 27 after leaving the tip 24 and gets guided into the right 25 or the left straight section 29, depending on the situation. After the pin 16 is re-guided by the curve 26 or 28, it comes, after the subsiding of the voltage impulse applied to the exciting coil 9, to lie in the dash-dot depicted position below the edge 35. With a new shifting of the slider 7, the pin 16 comes into contact with this edge 35 and is again guided into the right 26 or to the left curve 28 depending on the situation. In both cases, the pin 16 finally returns again to the tip 24.<br>
It is clear from the explanation of the function of the connecting link 15 that this can also have a shape deviating from the heart-form, as long as the pin 16 can be supported stably in two halting rest-points separated from each other and the connecting link 15 can make the pin 16 movable between these two halting rest-points smoothly also with this shape. For example, it can be thought of in keeping with the embodiment of the fig. 9 to execute the connecting link 15 as semi-heart-shaped, thus comprising only one of the two wings.<br>
The form of this wing could deviate from the semi-heart-shape according to another design variation that can be thought of and be designed such that the shape is somewhat an ellipse.<br>
16<br><br>
Therefore, the invention is not limited to the approximately heart-shaped connecting link 15 depicted in the drawings.<br>
The remote control switch as per the invention can be designed comprising any number of contact-break distances, of which merely one remote control switch comprising two contact-break distances is represented in the enclosed drawings. In the fig. 1-3, merely one contact-break distance is represented, this is arranged between the intermediate shell 21 and the top shell of the remote control switch housing. The second contact-break distance lies between the intermediate shell 21 and the bottom sheJI_23 and is the same with respect to the design principle as the first one and is established such that the contact-break distance is visible as in the fig. 1-3.<br>
It can be planned that this second contact-break distance is designed with a switching function different from that of the first contact-break distance. It has to be understood by this that if the first contact-break distance has a closing function (contact-break distance is opened in the first switch position depicted in the fig. 1-3 and is closed in the second switch position depicted in fig. 8), the second contact-break distance is designed with opening function so that it is closed in the first switch position (fig.1-3) whereas it is opened in the second switch position (fig. 8).<br>
But, the functions of the two contact-break distances can be selected arbitrarily or can be combined with each other arbitrarily. Thus, both contact-break distances, for example, can be designed as opening or both as closing, or at any given time one or even both contact-break distances can be executed as alternating.<br>
Magnetic system 8 and slider 7 provided are common for both contact-break distances, i.e. the movable contacts 2 of both contact-break distances are arranged on a single, common slider 7 and movable opposite to the fixed contacts 1 by it. As is obvious from fig. 4, the slider 7 has, in the vicinity of the movable contacts 2, two arms 41 and 42 separated from each other by a slot 40. The movable contact pieces 2 of the remote control switch are arranged on these two arms 41 and 42, in which each arm 41 and 42 carries the single movable contact piece 2 or the two movable contact pieces 2 respectively of a contact-break distance. For a fully assembled housing of the remote control switch, the wall 45 of the intermediate shell 21 lies in the region of the<br>
17<br><br>
slot 40. Consequently, each of the two arms 41 and 42 projects into the contact-break distance assigned to it and is separated in the vicinity of the movable contact 2 from the other contact-break distance by the wall 45 of the intermediate shell 21.<br>
A speciality of the slider 7 provided in a remote control switch as per the invention is that the entire first arm 41 is executed as a component separated from the additional slider 7, but can be fixed to the additional slider 7. This possibility to fix can be basically realised, for example, if the arm 41 could be stuck to the additional slider 7.<br>
A removable, positive fixing of the arm 41 to the slider is provided according to the preferred version represented in the enclosed drawings:<br>
A dovetail-shaped slot 43 is incorporated in the first arm 41 with it. A guide 44 is formed in the vicinity of the additional slider in which the arm 41 has to be fixed, which matches with regard to its form with that of the slot 43 and is made slightly smaller than this. The arm 41 can be set in this guide 44 and with that can be fixed positively to the additional slider 7.<br>
The form of the cross section of the slot 43 and guide 44 can be selected arbitrarily and can be, for example, hammer-shaped as illustrated in the drawings. Alternatively, the slot 43 and the guide 44 could have a trapezoidal cross-section, in which the longer of the side-edges of this trapezoid, running parallel to each other, must lie in the vicinity of the bottom of slot 43 or the surface of the formation 44 corresponding to that, to achieve a positive connection of the arm 41 and the additional slider 7.<br>
As evident from fig. 7, at first the slider 7 can be inserted in the bottom shell 23 for the assembly of the remote control switch. Subsequently, the intermediate shell 21 can be set up and then the arm 41 can be fixed to the additional slider 7. An intricate insertion of the slider arms 41 and 42 in the vicinity between the bottom shell 23 and the intermediate shell 21 or between the top shell and intermediate shell 21 can be avoided this way.<br>
In order to achieve this easy assembly possibility of the slider 7 in the remote-switch housing, deviating from the earlier illustration, not the entire arm 41 but only a section<br>
18<br><br>
of the arm 41, namely the bottom section carrying the contact 2, can be designed as a component separate from the additional slider 7. With that, the other section of the arm 41 is executed as a single piece with the slider 7. Besides, it must be observed that the other arm section, executed as a single piece, ends with the slider 7 in the initial switch position (fig. 3) still above the wall 45, so that the wall 45 of the intermediate shell 21 need not be inserted in the slot 40 between the two arms 41 and 42 for the assembly of the remote control switch.<br>
A further aspect as per the invention lies in the constructional arrangement of the support of the movable contacts 2 on the slider 7. As evident from fig. 6, the slider 7 has a cage 50 for the support of the movable contacts 2 of a contact-break distance. Since the remote control switch illustrated in the drawings comprises two contact-break distances, whose movable contacts 2 are arranged on two arms 41 and 42 as described above, each one of these arms 41 and 42 is provided with such a cage 50.<br>
This cage 50 has two sidewalls 51 and 52 running in the sliding direction 14 of the slider 7 as well as cover plates 53 and 54 connecting these. The single movable contact 2 (refer fig. 1 and 2) or the two movable contacts 2 (ref fig. 3) is or are arranged on a somewhat rectangular plate 6, which plate 6 is carried between the side-walls 51 and 52 of the cage 50. A pressure spring 55 is arranged within the cage 50, which presses the plate 6 against one of the cover-surfaces 53 and 54.<br>
Against which of the two cover-surfaces 53 and 54 the plate 6 would be pressed depends on which switching function (closing or opening) the concerned contact-break distance fulfils. If the contact-break distance, as depicted in fig. 3, is executed as closing, in which the fixed contact 1 is arranged below the lower cover-surface 54, the plate 6 is pressed against the lower cover-surface 54. The movable contacts 2 come to rest on the fixed contacts 1 with a movement of the slider 7 leading to the closing of this contact-break distance. Due to this resting, the plate 6 cannot be shifted any more with the further continuing sliding of the slider 7, but the pressure spring 55 is compressed. The surface pressure with which the movable contacts 2 are pressed against the fixed contacts 1 is increased by the compression of the pressure spring 55.<br>
19<br><br>
For the execution of the contact-break distance as opening, the fixed contacts 1 lie above the upper cover-surface 53 of the cage 50, because of which the plate 6 is pressed against this upper surface 53 (refer to the first arm 41 on the left in fig. 6).<br>
The pressure spring 55 is preferably designed as helical pressure spring, which is supported with its one end on the plate 6 and the other end on one of the cover-plates 53 and 54 of the cage 50. Alternatively, the pressure spring 55 could be, for example, designed as a leaf spring.<br>
With the designing of the pressure spring 55 as helical pressure spring, formations 56 are made on the plate 6 and on one of the cover plates 53 and 54 of the cage 50, according to the preferred version of the remote control switch illustrated in the drawings, on which the ends of the pressure spring 55 are supported. These formations have preferably a dome shape, but can also be designed as cylindrical lugs.<br>
The inner surfaces of the cage side-walls 51 and 52 run parallel to each other and inclined at an acute angle a to the sliding direction 14 of the slider 7. This acute angle a lies preferably in the range of 3 to 5°.<br>
As discussed above, when the movable contacts 2 rest on the contacts 1 assigned to them, the plate 6 carrying these movable contacts 2 is lifted from the cage surfaces 53 and 54 of the cage 50, on which it can rest, and the pressure spring 55 is correspondingly compressed.<br>
During the shifting of the slider 7, which leads to a lifting of the movable contacts 2 from the fixed contacts 1 assigned to them, the movable contacts are at first not lifted from the fixed contacts 1: the plate 6 and with it the movable contacts 2 are still pressed by the pressure spring 55 against the fixed contacts 1, in which the pressure spring 55 is released with the continuing shifting of the slider 7. Only when one of the cover plates 53 and 54 of the cage 50 comes to rest on the plate 6 is this shifted and the movable contacts 2 lifted from the fixed contact 1.<br>
20<br><br>
During the shifting of the cage 50 opposite the plate 6 before the occurrence of this lifting, the inner surfaces 57 and 58 of the cage sidewalls 51 and 52 slide along the plate 6. Due to the inclination of the inner surfaces 57 and 58 to the sliding direction 14 of the slider 7, the plate is shifted normal to the sliding direction 14. This shifts the movable contacts parallel to the surfaces with which they rest on the fixed contact 1. This sideways relative movement of the movable contacts 2 against the fixed contacts 1, usually in the sliding direction 14 or the lifting movement, break the tenuous welds between the contacts 1 and 2.<br>
During the shifting of the slider 7, which leads to the movable contacts 2 resting on the fixed contacts 1 assigned to them - as already explained above - the movable contacts 2 at first rest on the fixed contacts 1 and then the pressure spring 55 acting on the plate 6 is compressed with further continuation of the movement of the slider 7. Also, the inner surfaces 57 and 58 slide along the plate 6 during this compressing, which causes a shifting of the movable contacts 2 usually running in the sliding direction 14. Since the movable contacts 2 already rest on the fixed contacts 1, the movable contacts 2 are rubbed on the fixed contacts 1, which results in cleaning of the contact surfaces of both contacts 1 and 2. This contributes to the achievement of reduced contact resistance and also to the maintenance of low resistance over the useful life of the remote control switch.<br>
