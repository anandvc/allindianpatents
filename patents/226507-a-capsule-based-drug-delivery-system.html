				<td>TITLE: A CAPSULE FOR DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to soft capsules for drug delivery systems.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
The provision of soft capsules containing pharmaceutical preparations is well established.<br>
Typically drugs and dietary supplements are encapsulated in toft or hard gelatin shells<br>
designed to release their contents under specific conditions encountered in the body. The<br>
gelatin shells used for these capsules are derived from animal renderings.<br>
With concerns of animal related diseases such as Bovine Spongiform Eacephalopathy<br>
(BSC) and the existence of large groups of the population unable or unwilling to take<br>
animal based products for religious or ethical reasons, there is a profound need for a<br>
substitute material for soft capsule shells. However the machinery used in the production<br>
of gelatin capsules does not lend itself to the use of alternative materials, particularly those<br>
suitable for ingestion. In addition those materials which perform is a similar fashion<br>
mechanically to gelatin do not have suitable barrier properties to prevent spoilage of<br>
certain sensitive ingredients. As a result it is necessary to change not only the capsule<br>
material, but also the machinery used for their production. It is this change in material and<br>
the necessary processing means which this invention addresses, by providing soft capsules<br>
with good barrier properties and optional controlled release.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the invention there is provided a soft capsule comprising a wall derived from<br>
a multilayer film comprising of three layers, namely a sealing layer of plasticised hydroxy<br>
propyl methyl cellulose, an adhesion-promoting layer of propylcnc glycol alginate and a<br>
barrier layer of sodium alginate.<br>
The encapsulating films have robust mechanical properties and good oxygen barrier when<br>
used as a capsule wall. The films created are preferably but not essentially coated to<br>
achieve precise drug delivery and protection of their contents and use a carrier membrane<br>
which also acts as the sealing layer. The sealing layer is typically t modified cellulose 18<br>
to 200 microns thick and soluble in cold water. The coatings control the time and site of<br>
release of the finished capsules as well as offering specific barrier properties to prevent the<br>
spoilage of the capsule contents. The conversion process involves film transport, coating,<br>
vacuum forming, filling, scaling and cutting.<br>
The materials used to coat the surface of the cellulose sealing layer include sodium,<br>
alginates, propylene glycol alginate, pectins, gellan gums, carageenans, xantham gum,<br>
locus bean gum, starches, soy protein, gluten and derivatives such as Arainoxylan<br>
ferulyate (AXF), zein, and gum arabic. These materials can be applied to the surface<br>
either before the film is made into capsules; or as a finishing treatment to pre made<br>
capsules. The selection of the preferred coating material is determined by the properties,<br>
contents and release characteristics required of the finished capsule. In order, to provide<br>
flexibility these coating materials can be plasticised with agents such as glycerine or mono<br>
propylene glycol. A plasticiser to polymer ratio of 1:1 has been found to impart good<br>
flexibility for capsule manufacture. Where the agents are applied as a post treatment this<br>
plasticiser content can be significantly reduced.<br>
One or more of the three layers are preferably defornaable by heat, providing between<br>
them the means for scaling and good oxygen barrier. These three layers function well<br>
over a wide range of individual thickness. The ratio is selected according the type of<br><br>
processing, capsule content, and capsule end application. In a typical oil bearing ingestible<br>
soft capsule the carrier or sealing membrane is hydroxy methyl cellulose plasticised with<br>
glycerine and propylene glycol or mono, di or tri acetin at a thickness of 10 to 150<br>
microns, and the upper barrier layer is sodium alginate at a thickness of 5 to 50 microns<br>
plasticised with glycerine or sorbitol. In order to achieve a good level of adhesion<br>
between these layers a tie layer promoting adhesion consisting of propylene glycol alginate<br>
in the region of 0.S to 20 microns is present.<br>
It is preferred that the seating layer is deformable by heat and seals using the established<br>
processes of heat, radio frequency or a combination of both. Alternatively, high<br>
frequency, ultrasonic or induction welding can be employed as the sealing method. Good<br>
results have been achieved using hydroxly methyl propyl cellulose plasticised with<br>
glycerine and propylene glycol at 100 microns as a sealing layer with radio frequency as<br>
the sealing method.<br>
To secure a barrier layer to the sealing layer sufficiently well that it will survive the<br>
rigours of the capsule forming process without delamination it has been found necessary<br>
and beneficial to use an adhesion pramoeter or tie layer. Propylane glycol alginate<br>
improves the adhesion of sodium alginate to hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose, as does a<br>
50:50 blend of propylene glycol alginate and hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose. The<br>
materials used in this tie layer may also be plasticised with such materials as glycerine and<br>
or mono propylene glycol at around 20%. In this invention propylene glycol alginate has<br>
been found to perform this function well at a thickness of 4 microns.<br>
The top layer provides the means to obtain specific barrier properties as well as time and<br>
site release such as area within the body in the case of ingestion. Time release can be<br>
controlled by thickness, but site release often needs formulation modifications. When<br>
sodium alginate or pectin is used as the barrier layer it can be made partially soluble by<br>
introducing the surface to calcium ions thus forming a thin water insoluble layer which can<br>
be made to dissolve slowly in the presence of sequestering agents or when there is a<br>
change in pH.<br><br>
The multi layered capsule shell film is prepared by coaling the innermost sealing layer with<br>
an adhesion layer and a banter or dissolution controlling layer. These coatings can be<br>
applied by, roller, Meyer bar, dipping, spraying, electrostatically, extrusion, sponge,<br>
gravure, flexo.<br>
The preparation of the multi layered film can occur within the capsule manufacturing unit<br>
or off line whereby the finished multi layered film is supplied to a dedicated processing<br>
unit. It may also be formed by the application of the tie layer and barrier layer tp capsules<br>
formed exclusively from the sealing layer. Where this application occurs off line is a post<br>
formed treatment by such methods as spray drying, dusting or coating, gum arabic, AXP,<br>
sugars, polyols and waxes have been found to work well.<br>
The ability to seal any of the films described in this patent by heat inducing methods,<br>
including radio frequency, and the ability to produce strong finished seals can be enhanced<br>
by the application of certain materials, namely water soluble glycols, alcohols, lactones,<br>
acetins and pyrrolidones to the surface of the sealing layer. These materials also help to<br>
form a seal where the surface of the selling layer is contaminated with oil. Propylene<br>
glycol, propanol, ethanol, butyrolactone, n-methyl pyrrolidone and gamma valerolactone<br>
have been found to work well in this case.<br>
A preferred method of encapsulation is characterised by supplying a multi layered film to a<br>
dedicated encapsulation unit capable of deforming the film into two capsule halves, filling,<br>
scaling and cutting.<br>
Is the encapsulation unit the film is pre formed preferably by the use of vacuum into<br>
capsule halves and the substance to be encapsulated is supplied between the films wbere it<br>
enters the two pre formed capsule halves during closing.<br>
The pre forming process may be enhanced by heating the forming head, or film to an<br>
elevated temperature of around 80-120°C. In order to minimise the exposure of the<br><br>
capsule fill to high temperatures it is preferred that the film is heated just prior to capsule<br>
formation ratber than the capsule forming head.<br>
The encapsulation unit typically consists of a pair of flat forming beads or drums, where at<br>
least one of pair is formed with a plurality of indentations the size of the desired finished<br>
capsule on their face. Means for applying a vacuum to these forming heads is<br>
conveniently included, to help pull the film into the indentations and so assist in capsule<br>
formation. These heads are supplied by rolls of film which may be coaled with several<br>
applications before reaching them; The pre formed capsules are filled while inside the<br>
forming heads before being sealed by the application of recognised and established<br>
methods, namely heat, radio frequency or a coinbination of these two. After sealing the<br>
capsules arc cut out and ejected.<br>
Whilst it is a preferred feature that the forming, filling, sealing and cutting occur at the<br>
same location it may also occur as a stepped process whereby, the capsules are pre formed<br>
and filled at a different location to where they are sealed and where they are cut.<br>
The invention will further be described, by way of example, with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a capsule,<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic representation of the preferred multi-layer film of a capsule<br>
according to ths invention, and<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic illustration of a manufacturing unit for making the capsule.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a capsule with a substance encapsulated by a shell wall 1.<br>
The capsule shell wall or membrane illustrated in Figure 2 comprises three layers. The<br>
sealing layer 1 is hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose plasticised with glycerine at 10% and<br>
propylene glycol at 18%, present at 100 microns. The top layer is a barrier layer 3, and is .<br>
sodium alginate plasticised with glycerine or sorbitol at 50%, present at a thickness of 10<br>
microns. In between these layers 1 and 3 is an intermediate sealing layer 2, helping<br>
adhesion, and made of propylene glycol alginate, present at a thickness of 4 microns. This<br>
intermediate layer 2 may also contain a plasticiser up to 50%.<br>
The three layer wall or membrane is prepared by a series of two coatings from solution or<br>
by extrusion on to the surface of pre formed plasticised hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose<br>
film. The propylene glycol alginate is applied first followed by. the plasticised sodium<br>
alginate. The coatings are applied, separately by means of coating heads onto the surface<br>
of the hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose film on conventional coating apparatus. The three<br>
layer film can then be supplied to the encapsulation unit pre formed in rolls.<br>
Figure 3 shows a capsule processing unit where the cutting process occurs remotely from<br>
the forming heads. From the two reels at the top of Figure 3, two lengths of multi-layer<br>
film are fed to the forming heads. The female forming head and cutting area are located in<br>
a cylinder, with flat faces exampled by 19, either side of the capsule forming areas<br>
exampled by 9. The female forming areas have raised side walls, 18, which help in the<br>
channelling of excess liquid fill away from the filling., area. As the cutting does not take<br>
place at the point of capsule-formation the female forming unit is not sprung. Film passes<br>
over the forming head 6 and the forming cylinder 8. Vacuum is applied to draw the film<br>
into the forming heads. Forming head 6 has a forming cup 15 with a small groove cut in<br>
it, and has a grooved stripper plate assembly. The filling injector 5 comes down and is.<br>
then engulfed by the stripper plate groove 16 in .the. stripper plate 17, The filling injector 5<br><br>
then withdraws as it fills the pre formed capsule. When tie injector 5 has fully<br>
withdrawn, a further forward motion by forming head 6 causes a seal to be made. This<br>
seal is completed by the action of heat, radio frequency or a combination of these two.<br>
When the capsule is made and filled the forming head 6 moves away from the forming,<br>
drum 8 and the dram rotates, to present another fonning cup. The filled capsule which has<br>
not been cut remains held in place in the forming head 6 by means of vacuum. This<br>
capsule remains in the forming drum 6 until it is passed to cutting drum 7. This occurs by<br>
means of a loss in vacuum on the forming head 6, shown by the shaded area 15, and the<br>
presence of vacuum in the cutting drum 7. The formed capsule passes over the cutting,<br>
head 10, where by means of a punch action it is cut free from the surrounding film. The<br>
finished capsule 12 remains in the cutting drum 7 until it drops into the tray 13 when<br>
vacuum on the fonning drum 7 is released in the shaded area 16. The waste flim 11 with<br>
holes is transported via the rollers 14 to waste.<br>
Example<br>
By using the multilayer film shown in Figure 2 in the apparatus of Figure 3, good quality<br>
soft capsules were produced suitable for ingestion.<br><br>
