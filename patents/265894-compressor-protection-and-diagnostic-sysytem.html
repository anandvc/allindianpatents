COMPRESSOR PROTECTION AND DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/533,236, filed on December 30, 2003. The disclosure of the above application is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present teachings relate to compressors, and more particularly, to<br>
an improved diagnostic system for use with a compressor.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Compressors are used in a wide variety of industrial and residential<br>
applications. More particularly, compressors are often used to circulate refrigerant within<br>
a refrigeration or heat pump system to provide a desired heating or cooling effect. In<br>
addition, compressors are also used to inflate or otherwise impart a fluid force on an<br>
external object such as a tire, sprinkler system, or pneumatic tool. In any of the foregoing<br>
applications, it is desirable that a compressor provide consistent and efficient operation to<br>
ensure that the particular application (i.e., refrigeration system or pneumatic tool)<br>
functions properly. To that end, alerting when a compressor has failed or is in need of<br>
repair helps prevent unnecessary compressor damage and system failures.<br>
[0004] Compressors are intended to run trouble free for the life of the<br>
compressor and provide a consistent supply of compressed fluid. While compressors are<br>
increasingly reliable, monitoring operation of the compressor allows one to discontinue its<br>
operation should an error or fault arise. Discontinuing use of the scroll compressor under<br>
unfavorable conditions will likely prevent damage to the compressor.<br>
[0005] Faults causing a compressor to shut down may be electrical or<br>
mechanical in nature. Electrical faults generally have a direct effect on the electric motor<br>
in the compressor, and may destroy the electric motor or its associated components.<br>
Mechanical faults may include faulty bearings or broken parts, and typically raise the<br>
internal temperature of the respective components to very high levels, sometimes causing<br>
malfunction of and damage to the compressor. In addition to mechanical and electrical<br>
faults, "system" faults may occur, such as those resulting from an adverse level of<br>
refrigerant or lubricant or to a blocked flow condition. Such system faults may raise the<br>
internal compressor temperature or pressure to high levels, which may damage the<br>
compressor.<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] A compressor assembly generally includes a shell, a compressor<br>
housed within the shell, and a motor drivingly connected to the compressor. A sensor<br>
assembly is provided for monitoring operating parameters of the compressor assembly,<br>
including the temperature of an electrical conductor supplying current to the motor.<br>
Processing circuitry in communication with the sensor assembly processes the operating<br>
parameters of the compressor. A terminal assembly is hermetically secured to the shell<br>
and is in communication with the sensor assembly, while a connector is attached to the<br>
terminal assembly outside of the shell and serves to operably connect the processing<br>
circuitry with the sensor assembly.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0031] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in no<br>
way intended to limit the teachings, its application, or uses.<br>
[0032] With reference to the figures, a scroll compressor 10 is provided and<br>
includes a compressor protection and control system 12. The protection and control<br>
system 12 is operable to selectively shut down the compressor 10 in response to sensed<br>
compressor parameters in an effort to protect the compressor 10 and prevent operation<br>
thereof when conditions are unfavorable. While a scroll compressor 10 will be described<br>
herein, it should be understood that any compressor could be used with the protection<br>
and control system 12 of the present invention.<br>
[0033] With particular reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, the compressor 10 is shown<br>
to include a generally cylindrical hermetic shell 14 having a welded cap 16 at a top portion<br>
and a base 18 having a plurality of feet 20 welded at a bottom portion. The cap 16 and<br>
base 18 are fitted to the shell 14 such that an interior volume 22 of the compressor 10 is<br>
3<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
defined. The cap 16 is provided with a discharge fitting 24, while the shell 14 is similarly<br>
provided with an inlet fitting 26, disposed generally between the cap 16 and base 14, as<br>
best shown in FIGS. 2 and 8. In addition, an electrical enclosure 28 is fixedly attached to<br>
the shell 14 generally between the cap 16 and base 18 and operably supports a portion of<br>
the protection system 12 therein, as will be discussed further below.<br>
[0034] A crankshaft 30 is rotatively driven by an electric motor 32 relative to<br>
the shell 14. The motor 32 includes a stator 34 fixedly supported by the hermetic shell<br>
14, windings 36 passing therethrough, and a rotor 38 press fitted on the crankshaft 30.<br>
The motor 32 and associated stator 34, windings 36, and rotor 38 are operable to drive<br>
the crankshaft 30 relative to the shell 14 to thereby compress a fluid.<br>
[0035] The compressor 10 further includes an orbiting scroll member 40<br>
having a spiral vane or wrap 42 on the upper surface thereof for use in receiving and<br>
compressing a fluid. An Oldham coupling 44 is positioned between orbiting scroll<br>
member 40 and a bearing housing 46 and is keyed to orbiting scroll member 40 and a<br>
non-orbiting scroll member 48. The Oldham coupling 44 is operable to transmit rotational<br>
forces from the crankshaft 30 to the orbiting scroll member 40 to thereby compress a fluid<br>
disposed between the orbiting scroll member 40 and non-orbiting scroll member 48.<br>
Oldham coupling 44 and its interaction with orbiting scroll member 40 and non-orbiting<br>
scroll member 48 is preferably of the type disclosed in assignee's commonly-owned U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,320,506, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0036] Non-orbiting scroll member 48 also includes a wrap 50 positioned in<br>
meshing engagement with wrap 42 of orbiting scroll member 40. Non-orbiting scroll<br>
member 48 has a centrally disposed discharge passage 52 which communicates with an<br>
upwardly open recess 54. Recess 54 is in fluid communication with discharge fitting 24<br>
defined by cap 16 and partition 56, such that compressed fluid exits the shell 14 via<br>
passage 52, recess 54, and fitting 24. Non-orbiting scroll member 48 is designed to be<br>
mounted to bearing housing 46 in a suitable manner such as disclosed in the<br>
aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,877,382 or U.S. Patent No. 5,102,316, the disclosures<br>
of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0037] Referring now to FIG. 2, electrical enclosure 28 includes a lower<br>
housing 58, an upper housing 60, and a cavity 62. The lower housing 58 is mounted to<br>
the shell 14 using a plurality of studs 64 which are welded or otherwise fixedly attached to<br>
the shell 14. The upper housing 60 is matingly received by the lower housing 58 and<br>
defines the cavity 62 therebetween. The cavity 62 is operable to house respective<br>
components of the compressor protection and control system 12, as will be discussed<br>
further below.<br>
4<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
[0038] With particular reference to FIGS. 1-6, the compressor protection and<br>
control system 12 is shown to include a sensor system 66, processing circuitry 68, and a<br>
power interruption system 70. The sensor system 66, processing circuitry 68, and power<br>
interruption system 70 cooperate to detect and correct fault conditions in an effort to<br>
prevent damage to the compressor 10 and to alert a user to the fault condition (i.e., via<br>
light emitting devices (LED) and the like). The compressor protection and control system<br>
12 detects and responds to run winding delay, motor overload, missing phase, reverse<br>
phase, motor winding current imbalance, open circuit, low voltage, locked rotor currents,<br>
excessive motor winding temperature, high discharge temperature conditions, low oil<br>
pressure, lack of three phase power, open thermistors, welded or open contactors, and<br>
short cycling. For example, a compressor protection and control system 12 for a<br>
particular type and size compressor may be as summarized in Table 1, but other<br>
compressor types and sizes may have different thresholds, parameters, indicators and<br>
limits.<br><br>

Table 1<br>
[0039] As shown above in Table 1, a run winding delay is generally defined as<br>
an excessive delay in energizing one winding after a first winding is energized. When a<br>
start winding has been energized, a run winding must be energized within two seconds.<br>
If the run winding is not energized within this time period, the system 12 shuts down the<br>
compressor motor 32. If the run winding is energized first, the start winding must be<br>
energized within two seconds. If the start winding is not energized within this time period,<br>
the system 12 similarly shuts down the motor 32. For a plural compressor 10c (FIG. 19)<br>
the system 12 senses both the start and run winding current at start up. When the<br>
compressor 10c is in the running state, if either the start or run winding completely drop<br>
out for more than two seconds, the system 12 shuts down the motor 32.<br>
[0040] A missing phase fault is generally defined when one phase of the<br>
motor 32 is missing. Once the start winding is energized, the system 12 ensures that<br>
current is present in all phases within 700 milliseconds after current is detected in one of<br>
the phases. If current is detected in at least one phase and no current is detected in the<br>
other phase(s), then the system 12 shuts down the motor 32. Generally speaking, a<br>
current imbalance of greater than 50 percent is required before the motor 32 is<br>
interrupted. The run winding is monitored and protected against missing phase in a<br>
similar fashion. During normal running operation (i.e., while demand is present), if a loss<br>
of current in-any phase of the motor 32 is detected for a period of one second, the motor<br>
32 is shut down.<br>
[0041] A reverse phase is generally defined when three phase power leads<br>
are connected improperly, thereby causing the motor 32 to run backwards. If the phase<br>
sequence of the three  phase  power is  incorrect,  the  system  12  shuts  down  the<br>
7<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
compressor 10. The phase sequence is measured roughly 700 milliseconds after the<br>
demand signal and current is sensed in the start winding. It should be noted that the<br>
motor 32 may rotate "backwards" for a short period of time after power has been removed<br>
from the compressor 10 due to pressure equalization. Due to this phenomenon, reverse<br>
phase is only monitored for roughly the first five seconds of each compressor start cycle.<br>
[0042] A welded contactor fault is declared when a contactor supplies three<br>
phase power to the compressor 10 when contactor should be open. This condition is<br>
detected after the motor 32 has been shut down. If current persists after roughly two<br>
seconds of shutdown, then it will be assumed that the contacts have welded or<br>
mechanically "jammed" shut.<br>
[0043] A motor overload condition is generally referred to a situation where<br>
current to the compressor 10 exceeds a maximum continuous current (MCC) rating.<br>
Overload current is defined as current that exceeds 110 percent rated MCC for more than<br>
60 seconds. If the part winding motor current in any leg of either start or run winding<br>
exceeds the pre-programmed limit, then the system 12 shuts down the motor 32. The<br>
MCC overload detection does not start until five seconds after start up and continues until<br>
shutdown. If a compressor's MCC is not programmed, overload current is detected by<br>
the a motor temperature sensor(s). The system 12 detects a missing compressor MCC<br>
parameter when it determines that the MCC value is set to zero Amps, which is the<br>
default setting for the compressor 10.<br>
[0044] A locked rotor condition is declared when current to the compressor 10<br>
exceeds roughly 300 Amps, fails to decrease from an initial locked rotor current level,<br>
exceeds 300 Amps, or is roughly 40 percent of peak locked rotor Amps (LRA) while<br>
running. The locked rotor current during start up is expected to decrease within one<br>
second after the motor 32 comes up to speed and settles down to a normal running<br>
current level. The system maintains a 100 millisecond buffer of the current readings for<br>
the run and start windings. When compressor demand is high, indicating the compressor<br>
has started, the highest peak current in the buffer is recorded as the locked rotor current.<br>
The peak locked rotor current is recorded as greater than 300 Amps, or as the specific<br>
peak value if less than 300 Amps.<br>
[0045] If the peak locked rotor current in the start winding is greater than 300<br>
Amps, a second reading is taken roughly 800 milliseconds after start up (compressor<br>
demand is measured high). If the start winding current value is greater than 300 Amps<br>
800 milliseconds after start up, then the system 12 assumes that the motor 32 is<br>
mechanically seized and that power to the motor 32 should be interrupted. If the peak<br>
locked rotor current in the start winding is less than 300 Amps, a second reading is taken<br>
8<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
roughly 800 milliseconds after start up (compressor demand is measured high). If the<br>
second reading has not dropped to a level less than 40 percent of the peak LRA<br>
measured, power to the compressor motor 32 is interrupted.<br>
[0046] For locked rotor conditions that occur after start up has completed, the<br>
peak locked rotor current measured is used. If the peak locked rotor current is greater<br>
than 300 Amps, and the running current is measured above 300 Amps for 500<br>
milliseconds, power to the motor 32 is interrupted. If the peak locked rotor current is less<br>
than 300 Amps, and the running current is greater than 40 percent of that peak locked<br>
rotor current measured and recorded, power is similarly interrupted. If a peak locked rotor<br>
current of less than 100 Amps is measured, the locked rotor detection is disabled for that<br>
compressor run cycle. Such control eliminates nuisance trips if the timing of the start up<br>
is disrupted during troubleshooting of the equipment.<br>
[0047] A low voltage fault is declared, and the compressor 12 is shut down, if<br>
the 220 VAC supply power to the system 12 falls below 170 VAC when a compressor<br>
demand signal is present. When the voltage falls to this level, the compressor 10 is not<br>
allowed to start. Excessive arcing due to contactor coil chattering during low voltage<br>
conditions can lead to a welded contactor and therefore the compressor 10 is shut down<br>
under such circumstances. The occurrence of low voltage must persist for roughly two<br>
seconds before an alarm is recorded and power to the motor 32 is interrupted. The<br>
voltage must rise above 180 VAC for a minimum of two seconds to reset the alarm.<br>
[0048] Discharge temperature is monitored to ensure that the discharge<br>
temperature is not above a predetermined threshold value in an effort to protect the motor<br>
32 and associated scrolls 40, 48. The system 12 monitors the discharge temperature in<br>
at least two locations and, if a resistance value is greater than roughly 1.33 kD +/- 5<br>
percent, power to the motor 32 is interrupted. Power remains interrupted until the<br>
resistance falls below roughly 600 Q +/- 5 percent and a thirty (30) minute delay has been<br>
completed.<br>
[0049] The temperature of the motor 32 is monitored by using at least one<br>
positive-temperature-coefficient (PTC) device or negative-temperature-coefficient (NTC)<br>
device, which may be a thermistor-type sensor. If a PTC resistance value is greater than<br>
roughly 4.5 kO +/- 5 percent, power to the motor 32 is interrupted and remains as such<br>
until the PTC resistance falls below roughly 2.75 kQ +/- 5 percent and a thirty (30) minute<br>
delay has been completed. A shorted thermistor input is read as a low resistance value<br>
and indicates the respective motor temperature sensor is jumpered or a board component<br>
has failed. Any PTC resistance below roughly 100ohms is interpreted as a shorted<br>
thermistor.<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-o19/POA<br>
[0050] An open thermistor fault is declared, and power to the motor 32<br>
interrupted, if any thermistor input is read as open circuit. An open circuit is defined for<br>
NTC and PTC thermistors as a resistance higher than roughly 100 kO. The resistance<br>
must be read at this level for 60 seconds while the compressor 10 is running.<br>
[0051] If a compressor demand input is read high for two seconds, and no<br>
current is read in any of the current transformer inputs, a no three phase power alarm is<br>
declared. Whenever current is detected in any current transformer input or if the demand<br>
inputs are read low for two seconds, the alarm is reset.<br>
[0052] In addition to detecting and reporting the above-described fault<br>
conditions (Table 1), the system 12 also detects and monitors "warning conditions." The<br>
warning conditions are not as sever as the fault conditions, and therefore do not cause<br>
protective action (i.e., interruption of power to the motor 32), but the warning conditions<br>
are monitored nonetheless and are used a diagnostics and in prevention of fault<br>
conditions. The warning conditions include a high ambient temperature warning, a motor<br>
overload warning, a locked rotor warning, a low supply voltage warning, a high supply<br>
voltage warning, a high discharge temperature warning, a discharge temperature sensor<br>
short circuit warning, a high motor temperature warning, a no configuration warning, and<br>
a contactor life warning, each of which is briefly described below.<br>
[0053] A high ambient temperature warning is detected when an ambient<br>
temperature sensor measures a temperature above roughly 60 degrees Celsius for more<br>
than 60 seconds continuously. The high ambient temperature warning is reset when the<br>
ambient temperature sensor measures below 60 degrees Celsius for more than 60<br>
seconds continuously.<br>
[0054] A motor overload warning is detected when the motor current is at 100<br>
percent MCC current level for more than 60 seconds. The motor overload warning is<br>
reset when the motor current level has dropped below 100 percent MCC current level for<br>
more than 60 seconds or when a motor overload alarm becomes active.<br>
[0055] A locked rotor warning is detected when a locked rotor event is<br>
detected. Unlike the alarm, which requires multiple events, the warning is detected with a<br>
single event. The locked rotor warning is reset when the compressor 10 has run five<br>
minutes continuously without a locked rotor event, or when a locked rotor alarm becomes<br>
active.<br>
[0056] A low supply voltage warning is detected when the supply voltage is<br>
below 180 VAC for two seconds. A low supply voltage warning is reset when the supply<br>
voltage is above 190 VAC for two seconds or when a Low Supply Voltage Alarm<br>
becomes active.<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
[0057] A high supply voltage warning is detected when the supply voltage is<br>
above 250 VAC for two seconds. A high supply voltage warning is reset when the supply<br>
voltage is above 240 VAC for two seconds.<br>
[0058] A high discharge temperature warning is detected when the discharge<br>
temperature is less than 10 degrees Celsius below the alarm set point for each sensor for<br>
two seconds. A high discharge temperature warning is reset when the discharge<br>
temperature is greater than 15 degrees Celsius below the alarm set point for each sensor<br>
for two seconds, or a high discharge temperature alarm becomes active.<br>
[0059] A discharge temperature sensor short circuit warning is detected when<br>
the resistance measured at the discharge temperature sensors is less than 100 O for two<br>
seconds. A discharge temperature sensor short circuit warning is reset when the<br>
resistance measured is greater than 1 kQ for two seconds.<br>
[0060] A high motor temperature warning is detected when a motor<br>
temperature is less than 10 degrees Celsius below the alarm set point for two seconds.<br>
[0061] A high motor temperature warning will be reset when a motor<br>
temperature is greater than 15 degrees Celsius below the alarm set point for two seconds,<br>
or a high motor temperature alarm becomes active.<br>
[0062] A no configuration warning is detected when the compressor model<br>
number, serial number and MCC current is not programmed into the memory. A no<br>
configuration warning is reset when the compressor model number, serial number AND<br>
MCC current is programmed into the memory. There is no check for accuracy of the text<br>
entered in for model and serial number and any non-zero number for MCC value is valid.<br>
[0063] A contactor life warning is detected when the number of compressor<br>
starts equals 50,000 or a multiple of 50,000 (i.e., 100 k, 150 k, 200 k, etc.). A contactor<br>
life warning is reset when the system module is powered off and on, indicating the<br>
contactor has been inspected and/or replaced.<br>
[0064] In general, the sensor system 66 detects compressor operating<br>
conditions such as the compressor faults listed above in Table 1 and the compressor<br>
warning conditions, and provides a signal to the processing circuitry 68 indicative thereof.<br>
The processing circuitry 68 is either a microcontroller or a microprocessor such as<br>
microcontroller model number PIC18F242, manufactured by Microchip Technology of<br>
Chandler, Arizona. The processing circuitry 68 is in communication with the power<br>
interruption system 70 and selectively actuates the power interruption system 70 in<br>
response to unfavorable conditions detected by the sensor system 66 such as, but not<br>
limited to, the aforementioned "fault conditions." More particularly, the power interruption<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-319/POA<br>
system 70 selectively restricts power to the compressor motor 32 in response to direction<br>
from the processing circuitry 68 to prevent damage to the compressor 10 when sensed<br>
compressor operating conditions are outside of a predetermined limit.<br>
[0065] With particular reference to FIGS. 3-6, the sensor system 66 is shown<br>
to include a scroll sensor 72, a motor temperature sensor 74, and a rotor sensor 76. The<br>
scroll sensor 72 is positioned generally proximate to the orbiting scroll member 40 and<br>
the non-orbiting scroll member 48 such that the temperature in an area surrounding the<br>
orbiting scroll member 40 and non-orbiting scroll member 48 may be detected. The<br>
motor temperature sensor 74 is positioned generally proximate to the windings 36 of the<br>
electric motor 32 and detects the temperature generally surrounding the windings 36.<br>
[0066] The rotor sensor 76 is positioned proximate to the rotor 38 of electric<br>
motor 32 and senses when the rotor 38 is in a "locked rotor condition." When the rotor 38<br>
is restricted from moving relative to the windings 36, a force is applied between the<br>
windings 36 and rotor 38 as the crankshaft 30 tries to rotate the windings 36. As can be<br>
appreciated, when the motor 32 attempts to rotate the crankshaft 30 and is restricted from<br>
doing so due to the locked condition of the rotor 38 relative to the windings 36, excessive<br>
current is drawn from an external power source and the rotor 38 begins to experience an<br>
elevated temperature. The increase in current draw is monitored by the rotor sensor 76<br>
so that the compressor 10 may be shut down if a predetermined current is detected, as<br>
will be discussed further below.<br>
[0067] With particular reference to FIG. 4, the sensor system 66 is shown to<br>
further include a cluster block 78 and a printed circuit board (PCB) 80. The cluster block<br>
78 includes a housing 82, power apertures 84, and sensor apertures 86. The power<br>
apertures 84 are connected to three high-voltage leads 88 extending from the housing 82.<br>
The high-voltage leads 88 are operable to supply the electric motor 32 with power to<br>
thereby drive the crankshaft 30 and orbiting scroll member 40. The high-voltage leads 88<br>
extend from the housing 82 and terminate at the PCB 80, as best shown in FIG. 4.<br>
[0068] The PCB 80 operably supports the motor temperature sensor 74 and<br>
rotor sensor 76 in close proximity to the electric motor 32. The motor temperature sensor<br>
74 is disposed on a bottom surface of the PCB 80 and is held in close proximity to the<br>
windings 36 of the motor 32 such that the motor temperature sensor 74 is able to detect<br>
temperature changes in the windings 36. The motor temperature sensor 74 is a<br>
thermistor able to detect temperature fluctuations in the windings 36 and may be<br>
configured as either a NTC or a PTC device, depending on the particular application. If<br>
the motor temperature sensor 74 is configured as a NTC device, the signals coming from<br>
the motor temperature sensor 74 are connected in parallel.    If the motor temperature<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
sensor 74 is configured as a PTC device, then the sensed signals conning from the motor<br>
temperature sensor 74 are connected in series.<br>
[0069] The rotor sensor 76 is generally disposed on an opposite side of the<br>
PCB 80 from the motor temperature sensor 74, as best shown in FIG, 4. The rotor<br>
sensor 76 generally includes a sensor pin 90 electrically connected to a terminal end of<br>
each high-voltage lead 88. The sensor pins 90 are specially designed current carrying<br>
elements and are operable to localize an inherent electrical resistance of each pin at a<br>
specific point along its geometry indicative of the current flowing through each pin 90. As<br>
can be appreciated, the current flowing through each sensor pin 90 is dictated by the<br>
amount of power drawn by the electric motor 32. When the rotor 38 is in a locked<br>
condition, the motor 32 begins to draw more current through each pin 90, thereby<br>
increasing the temperature of each pin 90 at the localized point, as will be described<br>
further below.<br>
[0070] In addition to the sensor pins 90, the rotor sensor 76 further includes a<br>
temperature sensor 92 disposed proximate to each sensor pin 90, as best shown in FIG.<br>
4. The temperature sensors 92 detect a change in temperature along the length of the<br>
sensor pin 90, and may be configured as either an NTC or a PTC thermistor. Generally<br>
speaking, each temperature sensor 92 is positioned along the length of each sensor pin<br>
90 such that it is proximate to the localized spot of increased electrical resistance so as to<br>
best detect a temperature change along the length of each individual pin 90. As can be<br>
appreciated, when more current is drawn through each sensor pin 90 by the electric<br>
motor 32, each pin 90 will experience electric resistance at the localized point, as<br>
previously discussed. By placing each temperature sensor 92 proximate to the localized<br>
point of resistance along each sensor pin 90, fluctuations in temperature caused by<br>
increased current draw through each sensor pin 90 will be quickly and accurately<br>
detected and may be fed back to the processing circuitry 68, as will be discussed further<br>
below.<br>
[0071] In addition to supporting the motor temperature sensor 74 and rotor<br>
sensor 76, the PCT 80 is also operably connected to the scroll sensor 72, as best shown<br>
in FIG. 4. The scroll sensor 72 is a temperature sensor and is operable to detect<br>
temperature fluctuations proximate to, or caused by, the orbiting scroll member 40 and<br>
non-orbiting scroll member 48. The scroll sensor 72 is a thermistor and may be<br>
configured as an NTC thermistor or a PTC thermistor, depending on the particular<br>
application.<br>
[0072] The PCB 80 serves as a termination point for the scroll sensor 72,<br>
motor temperature sensor 74, sensor pins 90, and temperature sensors 92.  Specifically,<br>
13<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
the scroll sensor 72 is operably connected to the PCB 80 via low-voltage leads 94, while<br>
the motor temperature sensor 74 and temperature sensors 92 are directly connected and<br>
supported by the PCB 80, as best shown in FIG. 4. As previously discussed, each of the<br>
scroll sensor 72, motor temperature sensor 74, and rotor sensor 76 are operable to detect<br>
respective temperature fluctuations within the shell 14 of the compressor 10. Because<br>
each of the scroll sensor 72, motor temperature sensor 74, and rotor sensor 76 terminate<br>
at the PCB 80, the PCB 80 serves as a relay to transmit the sensed signals from each of<br>
the respective sensors 72, 74, 76, through the shell 14 of the compressor 10 to the<br>
processing circuitry 68 and power interruption system 70.<br>
[0073] A low-voltage lead 96 extends from the PCB 80 to the cluster block 78<br>
and is connected to the sensor apertures 86. As can be appreciated, the number of low-<br>
voltage leads 96 extending from the PCB 80 to the cluster block 78 will depend on the<br>
number of sensors disposed within the interior volume 22 of the compressor 10. In other<br>
words, the number of low-voltage leads extending from the PCB 80 to the cluster block 78<br>
will generally equal the number of sensors 72, 74, 92 disposed within the compressor 10.<br>
However, each of the signals from the respective sensors 72, 74, 92 may be combined<br>
and sent from the PCB 80 to the cluster block 78 for transmission to the processing<br>
circuitry 68 and 70, thereby requiring a single lead extending between the PCB 80 and<br>
the cluster block 78. As can be appreciated, by combining the signals from the respective<br>
sensors 72, 74, 92, a reduction in the number of leads 96 extending from the PCB 80 to<br>
the cluster block 78 may be reduced.<br>
[0074] As previously discussed, the sensor assembly 66 is in communication<br>
with the processing circuitry 68. To maintain a hermetic seal within the volume 22 of the<br>
compressor 10, a hermetic terminal assembly 98 is provided to establish an electrical<br>
connection between the sensor assembly 66 and processing circuitry 68, as best shown<br>
in FIG. 3.<br>
[0075] The hermetic terminal assembly 98 includes a housing 100, a plurality<br>
of high-voltage pins 102, a plurality of low-voltage pins 104, and a hermetic sealing<br>
material 106 surrounding the high and low-voltage pins 102, 104. The housing 100 is<br>
fixedly attached to the shell 14 of the compressor 10 by a suitable means such as welding<br>
or braising. The high-voltage and low-voltage pins 102, 104 extend through the housing<br>
100 such that the high-voltage and low-voltage pins 102, 104 extend from the interior<br>
volume 22 to an exterior surface of the compressor 10, as best shown in FIG. 3. The<br>
high-voltage and low-voltage pins 102, 104 are surrounded by the hermetic sealing<br>
material 106 such that a hermetic seal is formed from an exterior surface of each pin 102,<br>
104 and the housing 100.   In this manner, the terminal assembly 98 effectively allows<br>
14<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
communication between the sensor assembly 66 and processing circuitry 68 while<br>
maintaining the hermetic seal of the compressor 10.<br>
[0076] The processing circuitry 68 is disposed on an outer surface of the<br>
compressor 10 and is in communication with both the terminal assembly 98 and the<br>
sensor assembly 66. Specifically, the processing circuitry 68 is housed generally within<br>
the electrical enclosure 28 and may be incorporated into a suitable plug 108 for<br>
interaction with the hermetic terminal assembly 98. Upon assembly, the plug 108<br>
receives each of the high-voltage and low-voltage pins 102, 104 such that an electrical<br>
connection is made between the processing circuitry 68 and hermetic terminal assembly<br>
98. In addition, the high-voltage and low-voltage pins 102, 104 are received into the<br>
power apertures 84 and sensor apertures 86, respectively, of the cluster block 78. In this<br>
manner, an electrical connection is made between the processing circuitry 68 and sensor<br>
assembly 66 via the hermetic terminal assembly 98 and plug 108. While a plug 108 has<br>
been described, it should be understood that any suitable connector may be used for<br>
transmitting a signal from within the compressor 10 to the processing circuitry 68.<br>
[0077] In addition to being electrically connected to both the hermetic terminal<br>
assembly 98 and sensor assembly 66, the processing circuitry 68 is further connected to<br>
the power interruption system 70. The power interruption system 70 is disposed on an<br>
external surface of the compressor 10 and is operable to selectively permit or restrict<br>
power to the electric motor 32. As can be appreciated, when the sensors 72, 74, 92<br>
indicate that conditions are unfavorable within the compressor 10, the processing circuitry<br>
68 will direct the power interruption system 70 to restrict power from reaching the electric<br>
motor 32, thereby effectively shutting down the compressor 10. In this manner, the<br>
sensor assembly 66, processing circuitry 68, and power interruption system 70 are<br>
operable to shut down the compressor 10 via restricting power to the electric motor 32<br>
when conditions in the compressor 10, or within a system the compressor 10 may be tied<br>
to, are unfavorable for further operation.<br>
[0078] In addition to the above, the processing circuitry 68 also stores the<br>
configuration parameters of the compressor 10. Specifically, the compressor model,<br>
compressor serial number, motor sensor type, MCC level, discharge temperature, motor<br>
temperature, current transformer calibration offset, slave addressing, and device name<br>
are all stored within the processing circuitry 68. Of the above parameters, only the<br>
compressor model, serial number, slave addressing, and device name are field<br>
configurable.<br>
[0079] With particular reference to FIGS. 5 and 6, the operation of the<br>
compressor 10 and associated compressor protection and control system 12 will be<br>
15<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-b19/POA<br>
described in detail. As previously discussed, the power interruption system 70 regulates<br>
power directed to the electric motor 32 of the compressor 10 by selectively engaging a<br>
contact 110 disposed external from the compressor 10 to thereby selectively restrict and<br>
permit power to the electric motor 32.<br>
[0080] In operation, the processor 68 monitors the combined signal of both<br>
the^motor temperature sensor 74 and scroll temperature sensor 72 and selectively shuts<br>
down the compressor 10 in response to detected system parameters. Specifically, if the<br>
actual value of the temperature detected by either the motor temperature sensor 74 or<br>
scroll temperature sensor 72 exceeds a preprogrammed limit such that a fault condition is<br>
detected, the processing circuitry 68 directs the power interruption system 70 to<br>
disconnect the contact 110, thereby restricting power from reaching the electric motor 32.<br>
In addition, the processing circuitry 68 further creates a fault signal and directs such<br>
signal to a diagnostic output 112 for recording. As can be appreciated, registered faults<br>
within the compressor 10 may be valuable diagnostic tools in tracking and preventing<br>
further faults and failures within the compressor 10. By sending fault signals to the<br>
diagnostic output 112, the processing circuitry 68 effectively registers each time the<br>
compressor 10 is shut down and maintains a record of each fault condition experienced.<br>
[0081] As previously discussed, the rotor sensor 76 detects when the rotor 38<br>
is locked relative to the windings 36. When the rotor 38 is in a "locked rotor condition" the<br>
electric motor 32 still draws current through the sensor pins 90 in an effort to rotate the<br>
crankshaft 30 and rotor 38 relative to the windings 36. In so doing, the electric motor 32<br>
draws a significant amount of current through each sensor pin 90 to overcome the locked<br>
condition between the rotor 38 and windings 36, thereby increasing the temperature of<br>
each sensor pin 90. When the sensor pins 90 realize an increase in temperature, the<br>
temperature sensors 92 relay a signal indicative of the temperature increase back to the<br>
processing circuitry 68.<br>
[0082] When the temperature sensors 92 indicate an increase in temperature<br>
at each pin 90, the processing circuitry 68 correlates the sensed temperature to a current<br>
flowing through each pin 90. In this manner, the temperature sensors 92 cooperate with<br>
the processing circuitry 68 to effectively function as a current sensor to monitor the<br>
current through each pin 90 and detect a locked rotor condition. When a threshold<br>
current has been established through the pins 90, the processing circuitry 68 is operable<br>
to direct the power interruption system 70 to restrict power to the motor 32 and shut down<br>
the compressor 10.<br>
[0083] In addition to sending a signal to the power interruption system 70, the<br>
processing circuitry 68 also sends a diagnostic signal to the diagnostic output 112 to<br>
16<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
record the "locked rotor" fault experienced within the compressor 10. By storing and<br>
tracking faults, the compressor protection and control system 12 effectively allows a user<br>
to monitor and track problems experienced by the compressor 10 in an effort to prevent<br>
and detect problems in the future, as previously discussed.<br>
[0084] Compressor protection and control system 12 has thus far been<br>
described as having three temperature sensors 92, each disposed proximate to the<br>
sensor pins 90. FIG. 5 schematically represents an input to the processing circuitry 68<br>
from each one of the temperature sensors 92. It should be understood, however, that the<br>
three temperature sensors 92 could be fed into one signal, whereby the lone signal is<br>
sent to the processing circuitry 68 via hermetic terminal assembly 98, as best shown in<br>
FIG. 6. In such a relationship, the system 12 is simplified by reducing the number of<br>
signals coming from the individual temperature sensors 92. In addition to the<br>
aforementioned sensors 72, 74, 76, it should be understood that other sensors could be<br>
used within the compressor 10 and should be considered as part of the present invention.<br>
Specifically, it is anticipated that an oil level sensor or oil temperature sensor, generically<br>
referred to in FIG. 6 as 114, could also be incorporated into the compressor protection<br>
and control system 12 for use in tracking diagnostics within the compressor 10, and<br>
should be considered with in the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0085] With particular reference to FIGS. 7-11, a second embodiment of the<br>
compressor protection and control system 12 will be described in detail. In view of the<br>
substantial similarity in structure and function of the components associated with the<br>
compressor protection and control system 12 and the compressor protection and control<br>
system 12a, like reference numerals are used here and in the drawings to identify like<br>
components.<br>
[0086] The compressor protection and control system 12a functions in a<br>
similar fashion to that of the compressor protection and control system 12, with respect to<br>
the scroll sensor 72 and motor temperature sensor 74. In this manner, detailed<br>
descriptions of the scroll sensor 72 and motor temperature sensor 74 are foregone.<br>
[0087] The rotor sensor 76a is disposed within the electric box 28 and<br>
generally includes a sensor pin 90 electrically connected to a high-voltage lead 88. The<br>
sensor pins.90 are a specially designed current carrying elements and localize an<br>
inherent electrical resistance of each pin at a specific point along its geometry indicative<br>
of the current flowing through each pin 90. As can be appreciated, the current flowing<br>
through each sensor pin 90 is dictated by the amount of power drawn by the electric<br>
motor 32.  When the rotor 38 is in a locked condition, the motor 32 begins to draw more<br>
17<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-o19/POA<br>
current through each pin 90, thereby increasing the temperature of each pin 90 at the<br>
localized point, as will be described further below.<br>
[0088] In addition to the sensor pins 90, the rotor sensor 76a further includes<br>
a temperature sensor 92 disposed proximate to each sensor pin 90. The temperature<br>
sensors 92 are operable to detect a change in temperature along the length of the sensor<br>
pin _ 90, and may be configured as either an NTC or a PTC thermistor. Generally<br>
speaking, each temperature sensor 92 is positioned along the length of each sensor pin<br>
90 such that it is proximate to the localized spot of increased electrical resistance so as to<br>
best detect a temperature change along the length of each individual pin 90. As can be<br>
appreciated, when more current is drawn through each sensor pin 90 by the electric<br>
motor 32, each pin 90 experiences electric resistance at the localized point. By placing<br>
each temperature sensor 92 proximate to the localized point of resistance along each<br>
sensor pin 90, fluctuations in temperature caused by increased current draw through<br>
each sensor pin 90 will be quickly and accurately detected and may be fed back to the<br>
processing circuitry 68.<br>
[0089] The rotor sensor 76a allows the processing circuitry 68 to more quickly<br>
respond to an increase in current draw by the motor 32 and therefore increases the ability<br>
of the compressor protection and control system 12a to protect the compressor 10. More<br>
particularly, because the rotor sensor 76a is disposed external from the interior space 22<br>
of the compressor, the power drawn by the motor 32 may be monitored prior to actually<br>
entering the compressor shell 14. Monitoring the current draw upstream from the motor<br>
32 allows for a quicker response time as the processing circuitry 68 is not required to wait<br>
for the current to travel along the high-voltage leads 88 and through the hermetic<br>
interface 98 prior to taking a reading. The improved response time allows the processing<br>
circuitry 68 to more quickly direct the power interruption system 70 to restrict power to the<br>
motor 32, and thus, reduces the probability of compressor damage.<br>
[0090] With particular reference to FIGS. 12-18, a third embodiment of the<br>
compressor protection and control system 12 will be described in detail. In view of the<br>
substantial similarity in structure and function of the components associated with the<br>
compressor protection and control system 12 and the compressor protection and control<br>
system 12b, like reference numerals are used here and in the drawings to identify like<br>
components.<br>
[0091] The compressor protection and control system 12b functions in a<br>
similar fashion to that of the compressor protection and control system 12, with respect to<br>
the scroll sensor 72 and motor temperature sensor 74. In this manner, detailed<br>
descriptions of the scroll sensor 72 and motor temperature sensor 74 are foregone.<br>
18<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
[0092] The rotor sensor 76b is disposed within the electrical enclosure 28b<br>
such that the rotor sensor 76b is removed from the interior space 22 of the compressor<br>
10. The rotor sensor 76b includes a cluster block 116 that matingly engages the hermetic<br>
terminal assembly 98 and a current sensor 118 that detects a current drawn by the<br>
electric motor 32.<br>
[0093] The cluster block 116 includes a pair of arms 120 flanking a central<br>
body 122, as best shown in FIG. 13. Each of the arms 120 and central body 122 includes<br>
a high-voltage lead 88 extending therefrom. In addition, the main body 122 includes a<br>
pair of low-voltage leads 96 extending therefrom for receiving and transmitting signals<br>
from the sensor assembly 66b, as will be described further below. As best shown in FIG.<br>
13, the cluster block 116 matingly engages the hermetic terminal assembly 98 such that<br>
each of the high-voltage leads 98 engage the high-voltage pins 102 and the low-voltage<br>
leads 96 engage the low-voltage pins 104. In this manner, the cluster block 116<br>
effectively connects the high-voltage power leads 88 and low-voltage sensor leads 96 to<br>
the sensor system 66a and motor 32 disposed within the compressor 10.<br>
[0094] The current sensor 118 is disposed proximate to the cluster block 116,<br>
as best shown in FIG. 14. The current sensor 76b includes a series of individual sensing<br>
elements 124, each having a high-voltage lead 88 extending therethrough. The sensor<br>
elements 124 detect a current flowing through each of the high-voltage leads 88 and<br>
produce a signal indicative thereof. The signal produced by the sensing elements 124 is<br>
sent to the processing circuitry 68b to compare the sensed current to a threshold limit and<br>
determine whether the electric motor 32 is in a "locked rotor state" or another fault<br>
condition.<br>
[0095] If the processing circuitry 68b determines that the current flowing<br>
through the high-voltage leads 88 exceeds the threshold limit, the processing circuitry 68b<br>
will send a signal to the power interruption system 70 to restrict power to the electric<br>
motor 32 and shut down the compressor 10.<br>
[0096] As previously discussed, the processing circuitry 68b sends a signal to<br>
the power interruption system 70 to restrict power to the electric motor 32 should an<br>
undesirable condition be experienced within the compressor 10. In addition, the<br>
processing circuitry 68b also alerts an operator that a system fault has occurred within the<br>
compressor 10 by illuminating a series of light-emitting devices (LED) 126, as will be<br>
discussed further below.<br>
[0097] With particular reference to FIGS. 14-18, the operation of the<br>
compressor 10 and associated compressor protection and control system 12b will be<br>
described in detail.   As previously discussed, the scroll sensor 72, motor temperature<br>
19<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
shown in FIG. 18. In addition, a second LED 126 may also be illuminated to indicate that<br>
the contactor 110 is supplying power to the electric motor 32. In the event that a fault is<br>
detected, a yellow LED 126 is illuminated to indicate that the compressor 10 has<br>
experienced a fault and is in need of attention. If the processing circuitry 68b determines<br>
that the fault condition is a significant fault, such that the compressor 10 will not be able to<br>
recover without shutting down, the processing circuitry 68b directs the power interruption<br>
system 70 to restrict power the compressor 10, as previously discussed.<br>
[00101] When the power interruption system 70 shuts down the compressor<br>
10, a red LED 126 is illuminated to alert an operator that the compressor 10 has been<br>
shut down due to a fault condition. At this point, the green "run" and "contactor" LEDs<br>
126 is turned off to indicate that the compressor 10 is no longer running under normal<br>
conditions, and that the contactor 110 has been disengaged from the power supply. It<br>
should be noted that at this point, the only LED 126 illuminated is the red alarm, indicating<br>
that the compressor 10 has been shut down and has logged a fault. As can be<br>
appreciated, by using such LEDs 126, the compressor protection and control system 12b<br>
allows the compressor 10 to indicate when a fault condition has been experienced so that<br>
proper actions can be taken, as best shown in FIG. 18.<br>
[00102] Generally speaking, the LED alarms are divided into supply power<br>
alarms and compressor alarms. The respective supply power and compressor alarms<br>
are communicated to the user by denoting a specific alarm with a designated number of<br>
LED flashes. Specifically, the supply power alarms include run winding delay (one flash),<br>
missing phase (two flashes), reverse phase (three flashes), welded contactor (four<br>
flashes), low voltage (five flashes), and no three phase power (six flashes). The<br>
compressor alarms include low oil pressure (one flash), discharge temperature (two<br>
flashes), motor temperature (three flashes), locked rotor (four flashes), motor overload<br>
(five flashes), and open thermistor (six flashes). Therefore, the user can easily determine<br>
the respective fault condition by simply referring to the respective LED 126.<br>
[00103] With particular reference to FIGS. 19-20, a fourth embodiment of the<br>
compressor protection and control system 12 will be described in detail. In view of the<br>
substantial similarity in structure and function of the components associated with the<br>
compressor protection and control system 12 and the compressor protection and control<br>
system 12c, like reference numerals are used here and in the drawings to identify like<br>
components.<br>
[00104] With reference to FIG. 19, the plural compressor 10c is shown to<br>
include a generally cylindrical hermetic shell 14c having a pair of welded caps 16c, 18c<br>
and a plurality of feet 20c.   The caps 16c, 18c are fitted to the shell 14c such that an<br>
21<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
interior volume 22c of the compressor 10c is defined. In addition, an electrical enclosure<br>
28c is fixedly attached to the shell 14c generally between the caps 16c, 18c and operably<br>
supports a portion of the protection system 12c therein, as will be discussed further<br>
below.<br>
[00105] A crankshaft 30c is rotatively driven by an electric motor 32c relative to<br>
the shell 14c. The motor 32c includes a stator 34c fixedly supported by the hermetic shell<br>
14c, windings 36c passing therethrough, and a rotor 38c press fitted on the crankshaft<br>
30c. The motor 32c and associated stator 34c, windings 36c, and rotor 38c are operable<br>
to drive the crankshaft 30c relative to the shell 14c to thereby compress a fluid.<br>
[00106] The plural compressor 10c further includes a pair of orbiting scroll<br>
members 40c, each having a spiral vane or wrap 42c on the upper surface thereof for use<br>
in receiving and compressing a fluid. An Oldham coupling 44c is positioned between<br>
orbiting scroll members 40c and a bearing housing 46c and is keyed to orbiting scroll<br>
members 40c and a pair of non-orbiting scroll members 48c. The Oldham coupling 44c is<br>
operable to transmit rotational forces from the crankshaft 30c to the orbiting scroll<br>
members 40c to thereby compress a fluid disposed between the orbiting scroll members<br>
40c and non-orbiting scroll members 48c. Oldham coupling 44c and its interaction with<br>
orbiting scroll members 40c and non-orbiting scroll members 48c is preferably of the type<br>
disclosed in assignee's commonly-owned U.S. Patent No. 5,320,506, the disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00107] Non-orbiting scroll members 48c also include a wrap 50c positioned in<br>
meshing engagement with wrap 42c of orbiting scroll members 40c. Non-orbiting scroll<br>
members 48c have a centrally disposed discharge passage 52c which communicates<br>
with an upwardly open recess 54c. Recesses 54c serve to store compressed fluid are<br>
disposed at opposite ends of the interior volume 22c such that a first recess 54c is<br>
positioned proximate cap 16c and a second recess 54c is positioned proximate cap 18c.<br>
[00108] Plural compressor 10c is preferably of the type disclosed in assignee's<br>
commonly-owned U.S. Patent No. 6,672,846 and U.S. Patent Application No. 10/600,106<br>
filed on June 20, 2003, published as U.S. 2004-0258542A1, the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00109] The compressor protection and control system 12c functions in a<br>
similar fashion to that of the compressor protection and control system 12b, with respect<br>
to the scroll sensor 72 and motor temperature sensor 74. In this manner," detailed<br>
descriptions of the scroll sensor 72 and motor temperature sensor 74 are foregone.<br>
[00110] The rotor sensor 76c is disposed generally within electrical box 28c<br>
such that current to the motor 32c is sensed prior to entering the shell 14c.   The rotor<br>
22<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
sensor 76c is substantially identical to sensor 76b, but requires three additional sensing<br>
elements 124 to handle an additional current draw by the motor 32c. Specifically,<br>
because the plural compressor 10c drives a pair of orbiting scroll members 40c relative to<br>
a pair of non-orbiting scroll members 48c, a larger motor 32c is required and, thus, more<br>
current is drawn. The increased power requirement causes additional high-voltage lines<br>
88 to extend between the hermetic terminal assembly 98 and motor 32c. In this manner,<br>
the rotor sensor 76c requires a total of six sensing elements 124 to accommodate the<br>
additional high-voltage leads 88.<br>
[00111] FIGS. 21 and 22 show a perspective view of the processing circuitry<br>
68c and rotor sensor 76c. Six sensing elements 124 are shown proximate to high-<br>
voltage leads 88, such that the current drawn by the motor 32c is monitored. In addition,<br>
a plurality of sensor inputs are shown such as oil level inputs 134, motor temperature<br>
sensor inputs 136, discharge temperature inputs 138, 140, alarm relays 140, power<br>
inputs 142, and contactor inputs 144. In addition, a communication port 112c is shown<br>
for communication with an external network, as will be discussed further below. As can<br>
be appreciated, the inputs may be varied depending on the particular application and will<br>
be largely dependent upon the sensor system 66c disposed within the compressor 10c.<br>
For example, a scroll-temperature input 146 could be added if a scroll sensor 72 is used<br>
within the compressor 10c, as best shown in FIG. 21.<br>
[00112] With particular reference to FIG. 23, the compressor 10 and associated<br>
compressor protection and control system 12 are shown incorporated into a network 128.<br>
While the network 128 will be described with reference to compressor 10 and compressor<br>
protection and control system 12b, it should be understood that compressor 10c and<br>
other protection and control systems 12, 12a, 12c could similarly be used in such a<br>
network. The network 128 includes a system controller 138 and a plurality of<br>
compressors 10. Each compressor 10 is in communication with a system controller 130<br>
via a communications port 132. The communications port 132 may be linked to the<br>
diagnostic 112 such that faults recorded by the processing circuitry 68b logged in the<br>
diagnostic 112 may be supplied to the communication port 132 and system controller<br>
130. By doing so, the faults experienced by each individual compressor 10 may be<br>
recorded and logged so that the proper maintenance may be performed on each<br>
compressor 10. While the compressor protection and control system 12b has been<br>
described incorporated into the network 128, it should be understood that the compressor<br>
protection and control system 12 could similarly be implemented into such a network, and<br>
as such, should be considered within the scope of the present invention.<br>
23<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 0315-519/POA<br>
[00113] As described, the compressor protection and control system 12 and<br>
compressor protection and control system 12b provide the compressor 10 with the ability<br>
to detect and sense system parameters, to alert potential faults through the use of LEDs<br>
126, and to store faults via diagnostic 112. In addition, in the case of the locked rotor<br>
condition, each of the current sensors 76, 76b provide the system with the ability to detect<br>
current draw by the motor 32, rather than relying solely on sensed motor temperatures.<br>
As can be appreciated, by sensing current draw, rather than waiting for a temperature<br>
signal to be produced and analyzed, the systems 12, 12a, 12b, 12c provide a quicker<br>
response time and thereby increase the productivity and performance of the compressor<br>
10.<br>
[00114] The description is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations are<br>
intended to be-within the scope of the teachings and not as a departure from the spirit<br>
and scope of the teachings.<br>
