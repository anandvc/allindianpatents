U-SHAPED SPAN FOR RAILWAY TRACK<br>
This invention relates to a span for a railway track,<br>
whether the rolling stock is on tires or on a rail. As a<br>
matter of fact, in this application, not only a railway<br>
track as such is called a railway track, i.e., a track<br>
with bearing rails on which rolling stock rolls, but also<br>
a track with a running rack, i.e., a track for rolling<br>
stock with wheels equipped with tires, of the subway on<br>
tires type.<br>
A span such this is known,â€”of the type--formed by a<br>
U-shaped structure defining a portion of the path of the<br>
rolling stock, the U-shaped structure including a slab<br>
supporting the railway track and two substantially<br>
vertical side walls.<br>
The path of the railway track is defined by the<br>
assembly of the various U-shaped structures. Some of<br>
these U-shaped structures, made of concrete, were<br>
prefabricated off-site, and their assembly considerably<br>
facilitates the construction of the railway track.<br>
However, prefabricated U-shaped structures make it<br>
possible to simplify only the construction of the carcass<br>
work.<br>
This invention aims to produce a span including a U-<br>
shaped structure of the aforesaid type and making it<br>
possible to simplify the integration of additional<br>
finishing elements which enable movement of the rolling<br>
stock.<br>
According to the invention, the span for a railway<br>
track comprises a self-supporting U-shaped structure<br>
which defines a portion of a path for a piece of rolling<br>
stock running on the railway track, and at least one<br>
 <br>
2<br>
additional element which enables movement of the rolling<br>
stock on the railway track and which is designed to<br>
support, guide and/or power the rolling stock, at least<br>
one of the additional elements being directly integrated<br>
into the U-shaped structure. The additional elements<br>
possibly being the electrical power-supplying or guide<br>
side rails, the bearing rails or the running track on<br>
which the wheels equipped with tires run or on which the<br>
bearing rails rest, depending on the type of rolling<br>
stock.<br>
Thus, via this configuration, as concerns the<br>
running track, its integration means that it is no longer<br>
necessary to carry out specific concreting on site (the<br>
latter being manufactured at the same time as the U-<br>
shaped structure), and, as concerns the rails, their<br>
integration makes it possible to fasten them directly to<br>
the U-shaped structure without any additional device, a<br>
portion of the members for fastening the rails to the U-<br>
shaped structure forming an integral part of the U-shaped<br>
structure (this portion being made within the structure<br>
or fastened to it during the manufacture thereof). Thus,<br>
according to the invention, functions linked with the<br>
railway system (the track supports, the lateral guide<br>
supports and rail power supply), are integrated upon<br>
manufacture of the U-shaped structure, which makes it<br>
possible to reduce the costs associated with construction<br>
of the railway track (beyond the carcass work).<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of this<br>
invention will become apparent in the following<br>
description of two embodiments, given for non-limiting<br>
illustrative purposes and shown in the appended drawings.<br>
 <br>
3<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional view of two spans according<br>
to a first embodiment and arranged one beside the other,<br>
for rolling stock on tires, the additional integrated<br>
elements being guide and power-supplying side rails,<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional view of a span defining the<br>
path of two adjacent railway tracks according to a second<br>
embodiment, the additional integrated elements being<br>
guide and power-supplying side rails,<br>
Figure 3 is a sectional view of a span according to<br>
a third embodiment,  for rolling stock on tires,  the<br>
additional integrated elements being running racks,<br>
Figure 4 is a sectional view of a span according to<br>
a fourth embodiment, for rolling stock on rails,  the<br>
additional integrated elements being running racks and<br>
bearing rails, the power being supplied via a catenary<br>
system (solid line) or by a side rail (dashes),<br>
Figure 5 is a sectional view of two spans according<br>
to a fifth embodiment and arranged one beside the other,<br>
for rolling stock on rails, the additional integrated<br>
elements being power-supplying side rails, and<br>
Figure 6 is a sectional view of a span defining the<br>
path of two adjacent railway tracks according to a sixth<br>
embodiment, the additional integrated elements being<br>
running racks, bearing rails and power-supplying side<br>
rails.<br>
In the examples shown in figures 1 to 6, a railway<br>
track for rolling stock 1 is delimited by an assemblage<br>
of several spans 2 arranged along side one another.<br>
Each span 2 comprises a structure 3, 3a, which<br>
defines a portion of the path of the railway track. Each<br>
structure 3, 3a is U-shaped and includes a substantially<br>
horizontal slab 4 supporting the railway track, and two<br>
 <br>
4<br>
substantially vertical side walls 5 flanking the railway<br>
track laterally. In these embodiments, the U-shaped<br>
structure 3, 3a is a prefabricated structure, in a single<br>
piece, made of reinforced concrete capable of being pre-<br>
stressed.<br>
Furthermore, according to this invention, since each<br>
span 2 is a complete span, each slab 4 is load-bearing<br>
and each U-shaped structure 3, 3a is self-supporting,<br>
which means that it is not supported by another element,<br>
such as. an intermediate caisson, and that, therefore, in<br>
the case of an elevated railway track, each U-shaped<br>
structure 3, 3a is directly supported by the piers of the<br>
corresponding viaduct, and runs from one pier to another.<br>
Each span 2 also includes additional elements 6<br>
enabling movements of the rolling stock 1 on the railway<br>
track.<br>
These additional elements 6, 9, 19, 11, 14 include<br>
at least one running rack 6 which is designed to support<br>
the rolling stock 1. When the latter has wheels with<br>
tires 7, the running rack 6 forms the track on which they<br>
roll directly, and when the rolling stock 1 has metal<br>
wheels 8 rolling on bearing rails 9, the running rack 6<br>
is a sleeper 6 onto which the bearing rails 9 are<br>
fastened directly (which are then part of the additional<br>
elements 6, 9, 19, 11, 14) .<br>
The additional elements 6, 9, 19, 11, 14 can also<br>
include at least one side rail 10, 11, 14 arranged at the<br>
side of the corresponding railway track, inside the space<br>
delimited by the U formed by the U-shaped structure 3, 3a.<br>
In the first three embodiments, the span 2 includes an<br>
incoming electric current side rail 10 and an outgoing<br>
current  side rail  11,  these two side  rails  10,  11<br>
 <br>
5<br>
enabling electrical power to be supplied to the rolling<br>
stock 1, which comprises contact pads 12, 13 designed to<br>
rub against these rails 10, 11 so as to establish the<br>
electrical  connection.  Furthermore,  in  these  three<br>
embodiments, as the rolling stock 1 is on tires 7, the<br>
span 2 also includes a guide side rail 14, the rolling<br>
stock 1 comprising guide wheels 15 the axis of rotation<br>
of which is vertical, and which rolls against this rail<br>
14 in order to ensure transverse guiding of the rolling<br>
stock 1. In the last two embodiments, the span 2 includes<br>
an incoming electric current side rail 10 cooperating<br>
with contact pads 12 designed to rub against this rail 10,<br>
and, as the rolling stock has metal wheels 8 rolling on .<br>
bearing rails 9, the latter are used as outgoing current<br>
rails.<br>
According to the invention, at least one of the<br>
additional elements 6, 9, 19, 11, 14, which make it<br>
possible to support, guide and/or power the rolling stock<br>
i, is integrated directly into the structure 3, 3a,<br>
without any additional device for making dimensional and<br>
geometric adjustments in the span 2.<br>
In the case of the running rack 6, this means that<br>
it forms an integral part of the slab 4 and that,<br>
therefore, it was made at the same time as the latter<br>
(see figures 3, 4 and 6) . In the case of the bearing<br>
rails 9 (see figures 4 and 6) or side rails 10, 11, 14<br>
(see figures 1, 2, 5 and 6), this means that they are<br>
fastened directly to the U-shaped structure 3, 3a (more<br>
precisely, for the bearing rails 9, they are fastened<br>
directly to the running rack 6 (or even to the slab 4),<br>
and, for the side rails 10, 11, 14, to the side walls 5).<br>
 <br>
6<br>
In the first three embodiments shown in figures 1 to<br>
3, a set of three side rails 10, 11, 14 is associated<br>
with one railway track. In the last two embodiments shown<br>
in figures 5 and 6, a single side rail 10 is associated<br>
with one railway track.<br>
In the first, second, fifth and sixth embodiments,<br>
as can be seen in figures 1, 2, 5 and 6, the side rails<br>
10, 11, 14 are held directly by the side walls 5 of the<br>
U-shaped structure 3, 3a.<br>
The U-shaped structure 3, 3a is dimensioned<br>
accordingly so that each side wall 5 -holding a side rail<br>
10, 11, 14 withstands not only the vertical forces<br>
generated by the rolling stock 1, but also the transverse<br>
forces that the rolling stock 1 generates and transmits<br>
to the side rail 10, 11, 14.<br>
In these embodiments, the U-shaped structure 3, 3a<br>
is dimensioned so that each side wall 5 withstands the<br>
transverse forces due, on the one hand, to the friction<br>
of the contact pads 12, 13 on the electrical power-<br>
supplying rails 10, 11, and, on the other hand, the<br>
transverse thrust exerted by the guide wheels 15 on the<br>
guide rail 14, in particular in the curved portions of .<br>
the railway track.<br>
Conventional fastening members 16 enable the rails 9,<br>
10, 11, 14 to be fastened to the walls 4, 5. These<br>
fastening members 16 include a portion which forms an<br>
integral part of the U-shaped structure 3, 3a (of the<br>
side wall 5 or the slab 4) . Thus, the fastening members<br>
can include threaded rods cooperating with bolts enabling<br>
the rail to be clamped to its support. In this case, for<br>
example, either the threaded rod is the portion of the<br>
fastening member forming an integral part of the U-shaped<br>
 <br>
7<br>
structure 3, 3a (the rod being previously arranged inside<br>
the mold for the U-shaped structure 3, 3a), or an opening<br>
for receiving the threaded rod forms an integral part of<br>
the U-shaped structure 3, 3a (the opening that is<br>
considered as forming part of the fastening members 16 is<br>
made during manufacture of the U-shaped structure 3, 3a).<br>
Furthermore, in the embodiments shown in figures 1<br>
and 2, the fastening members 16 associated with the side<br>
rails 10, 11, 14 include a support 17 which is fastened<br>
directly to the side wall 5 and which supports all of the<br>
side rails 10,, 11, 14 associated with the railway track<br>
(in this case, three). Furthermore, as concerns the<br>
electrical power-supplying side  rails 10, 11, the<br>
insulators are considered as forming an integral part of<br>
the fastening members 16.<br>
Furthermore, in these embodiments, the side walls 5<br>
are shaped so that upper end 18 substantially reaches the<br>
level of the deck of the rolling stock 1, so as to form,<br>
for example, the edge of a station platform. Furthermore,<br>
the upper end 18 extends transversely slightly towards<br>
the inside of the U of the U-shaped structure 3, 3a, so<br>
as to best draw close to the running-boards of the<br>
rolling stock 1.<br>
In the first and fifth embodiments shown in figures<br>
1 and 5, each U-shaped structure 3 is associated with a<br>
single railway track, and two identical U-shaped<br>
structures are arranged one beside the other, a central<br>
access platform for the rolling stock 1 running on the<br>
two railway tracks being created by the junction of the<br>
upper ends 17 of the two adjacent side walls 5 of each U-<br>
shaped structure 3. In the track portions shown in figure<br>
1, all of the three side rails 10, 11, 14 associated with<br>
 <br>
8<br>
each railway track are present on each side of each track,<br>
and in those shown in figure 5, the side rail 10 is<br>
present on each side of each track. Correspondingly, each<br>
side wall 5 of each U-shaped structure 3 holds all of the<br>
side rails 10, 11, 14 associated with the corresponding<br>
railway track.<br>
In the second and sixth embodiments shown in figures<br>
2 and 6, a single U-shaped structure 3a is associated<br>
with two railway tracks adjacent to one another. In the<br>
track portions shown in figure 2, all of the three side<br>
rails .10., 11, 1.4 associated with each railway track are<br>
present on each side of each track. Correspondingly, each<br>
side wall 5 of the U-shaped structure 3a holds all of the<br>
side rails 10, 11, 14 associated with the field side of<br>
the corresponding railway track, and a center support 19,<br>
fastened to the load-bearing slab 4, between the two<br>
railway tracks, holds all of the side rails 10, 11, 14<br>
associated with the gauge side of the two railway tracks.<br>
This is also true for the track portions shown in figure<br>
6, except that only a single side rail 10 is associated<br>
with each track.<br>
In the third, fourth and sixth embodiments, the<br>
running rack 6 forms an integral part of the load-bearing<br>
slab 4 and it is therefore prefabricated at the same time<br>
as the latter (and therefore at the same time as the U-<br>
shaped structure 3, 3a).<br>
In these embodiments, each row of carrying wheels 7,<br>
8 of the rolling stock 1 rolls on a running rack 6<br>
specific to it. Correspondingly, two running racks 6<br>
integrated with the load-bearing slab 4 (one per row of<br>
wheels) are associated with each railway track.<br>
 <br>
9<br>
Given that the spans 2 are complete spans and that<br>
the U-shaped structures 3, 3a are self-supporting<br>
structures, in order to achieve this integration,<br>
especially as concerns the running rack 6 (and as a<br>
result the bearing rails 9), but also to a lesser extent<br>
as concerns the side rails 10, 11, 14, a detailed<br>
calculation is made of the height of the additional<br>
element 6, 9, 10, 11, 14 to be integrated into self-<br>
supporting U-shaped structure 3, 3a, taking into account<br>
the geometry of the U-shaped structure 3, 3a during<br>
prefabricattion, at the moment when prestressing is<br>
applied, the long-term deformation of the prefabricated<br>
U-shaped element associated with shrinkage and creep<br>
problems, and the deformation due to overloading.<br>
Furthermore, a detailed inspection of the geometry is<br>
also carried out on the prefabrication bed prior to<br>
concreting, which is further facilitated by the length of<br>
the U-shaped structure 3, 3a, the span 2 being in one<br>
piece.<br>
Numerous modifications can be made in the<br>
embodiments of this invention.<br>
It would also be possible for the U-shaped structure,<br>
in particular when it is made of concrete, not to be<br>
prefabricated at the factory but made on site, e.g., via<br>
formwork. The U-shaped structure could also be made of<br>
metal or partially of concrete and partially of metal.<br>
The U-shaped structure could be in three parts (the slab<br>
and the two side walls) assembled to one another, and not<br>
in a single piece.<br>
It would also be possible for each railway track to<br>
be associated with only a single running rack serving as<br>
a running rack for the two rows of wheels of the rolling<br>
 <br>
10<br>
stock, and not two running racks as in these embodiments.<br>
Furthermore, the rolling stock can be equipped with both<br>
wheels with tires and metal wheels supported by the<br>
bearing rails.<br>
Depending on the track portions, it is not necessary<br>
for all of the side rails associated with one railway<br>
track to be present on each side thereof. It would be<br>
possible for each railway track to be associated with<br>
only a single side rail (either the incoming current side<br>
rail, the outgoing current side rail, or the guide side<br>
rail) or two side rails, depending on the rolling stock<br>
used (on tires, on rails, powered by rail or by a<br>
catenary system, as shown in figure 4). Furthermore, when<br>
there are several side rails associated with one track<br>
(two or three rails) , it would also be possible for all<br>
of the associated side rails to not be all arranged on<br>
the same side of the railway track (one side rail on each<br>
side when there are two side rails associated with the<br>
track, or two side rails on one side and the third side<br>
rail on the other side when there are three of them<br>
associated).<br>
Furthermore, it would be possible for the members<br>
for fastening the side rails to the side walls of the U-<br>
shaped structure to include a spacer in order to<br>
compensate for the distance transversely separating this<br>
side wall from the railway track. As a matter of fact, in<br>
particular during turns, it is necessary to move the side<br>
walls away from the path of the rolling stock, which must<br>
continue to be in contact with the side rails in order to<br>
be electrically powered and guided.<br>
As shown in figure 4, for the fourth embodiment, the<br>
electrical power supply to the rolling stock can be<br>
 <br>
11<br>
carried out, for all of the embodiments, by a catenary<br>
system (solid line) as well as by a side rail (dashes) -<br>
(by side rails in the case of equipment having wheels<br>
equipped with tires).<br>

12.	Method for constructing a span (2) in accordance<br>
with any one of claims 1 to 11, characterized in that the<br>
height of the additional element (6, 9, 10, 11, 14) to be<br>
integrated is determined by taking into account the<br>
geometry  of  the  U-shaped  structure  (3,  3a)  during<br>
prefabrication,  at  the moment when pre-stressing  is<br>
applied, the long-term deformation of the prefabricated<br>
U-shaped element (3, 3a) associated shrinkage and creep<br>
problems, and deformation due to overloading.<br>
13.	Construction method according to  claim 12,<br>
-characterized in that it includes a step for detailed<br>
inspection of the geometry . on the prefabrication bed,<br>
prior to concreting.<br>
14.	Construction method according to claim 11 or 12,<br>
for a span as claimed in claim 5 or any one of the claims<br>
depending on claim 5, characterized in that, during the<br>
design  stage,  the  U-shaped  structure  (3,  3a)  is<br>
dimensioned so that each side wall (5) supporting a side<br>
rail (10, 11, 14) withstands the transverse and vertical<br>
forces that the rolling stock (1) generates.<br>
<br>
The invention relates to a span (2) for railway tracks with a self-supporting U-shaped structure (3), defining a section<br>
of the path for a piece of rolling stock (1), travelling on the railway track and at least one further element (6,10,11,14) for the travel<br>
of the rolling stock (1) on the railway track and which can support, guide and/or supply the rolling stock (1). According to the<br>
invention, at least one (6) of the additional elements (6,10, 11, 14) is directly integrated in the U-shaped element (3).<br>
