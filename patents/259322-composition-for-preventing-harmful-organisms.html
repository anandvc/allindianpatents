The results are shown in Table 14.  In the Table, gai represents the amount of active ingredients (g). [0341]<br>
Degrees of Infection<br>
a: panicle neck infected<br>
b: 1/3 or more of rachis area infected<br>
c: less than 1/3 of rachis area infected<br>
Severity index = incidence of a + incidence of b x 0.66 + incidence of c x 0.26<br>

After 20 days from spraying, the number of insects was examined for 100 stumps in each plot.  Furthermore, 7 days before spraying, Rhizoctonia solani cultured on a bran medium was inoculated into the base of the plant. After 30 days from spraying, the number of infected stumps was examined for 100 stumps in each plot and the rate of infected stumps was calculated.  The results<br><br>

Control Test on Oriental Fruit Moth (Grapholita molesta) and Scab (Venturia nashicola) of Pear<br>
A liquid chemical which was prepared to the prescribed concentration was sufficiently sprayed on 17-year-old pears (cultivar: Hosui) (early June). After 40 days from spraying, the number of infected fruits due to Grapholita molesta was examined<br><br>
for all fruit in the plot, and the rate of infected fruit was calculated.  Furthermore, after 14 days from spraying, infection of Venturia nashicola was examined by the degrees for optional 200 leaves in the plot and the severity index was calculated according to the following equation.  The results are shown in Table 16.<br>

A liquid chemical which was prepared to the prescribed concentration was sufficiently sprayed on cucumbers (cultivar: sagami-hanpaku) cultured in a greenhouse.  After 7 days from spraying, leaves were cut off and put into a plastic cup (diameter: 10 cm, height: 10 cm) along with 5 of second-stage larvae of Diaphania indica, and the mortality was examined 4 days thereafter. Furthermore, 1 day after spraying, the leaves of cucumbers which were previously arranged to be infected by pathogen were uniformly wiped with Sphaerotheca fuliginea thereon using a paintbrush for inoculation and examined after 10 days thereafter.  The area occupied by lesion per leaf of cucumber was examined in accordance with the following index, and the control value was calculated from the average severity index of each plot according to the following equation (two replications).  The results are shown in Table 17. [0349]<br>
Severity Index 0:  No lesion<br>
