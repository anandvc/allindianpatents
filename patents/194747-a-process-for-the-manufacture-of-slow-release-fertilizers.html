FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This   invention   relates to a process   for  the manufacture  of  slow-release  fertilizers of  cationic<br>
micronutrients  such as zinc,  copper,iron,  manganese, cobalt   or  magensium, either as  single nutrient  or as   multinutrient  formulations.<br>
BACKGROUND  OF  INVENTION<br>
Compounds   which  are   widely   used  today   as micronutrient   fertilisers,  are   soluble   salts   or organic  chelated  forms  eg., zinc, copper,   manganese or  iron  sulphates, and  EDTA, complexes of  the  same. Liquid   fertilizers  such as  micronutrients  dissolved in    condensed     phosphoric    acid   or     ammonium polyphosphates  are  also used     (V. Sauchel1i,  1967, Chemistry  and  Technology  of   Ferti1izers,  Reinhold, New  York; G-H.  Col1ins, 1955, Commercial  Fertilizers, McGraw   Hill,   New  York).  The  synthesis  of   slow-release fertilizers based on phosphate glasses known  as frits, have been  described.  Such frits are usually prepared  by fusing  ammonium  or  sodium   dihydrogen<br><br>
-3-<br>
phosphates   with   micronutrient  salts  to produce   a<br><br>
melt, at temperatures between 8ØØo  and 14ØØoC  and<br>
then rapidly cooling the liquid by pouring on to a cold plate (G.J. Roberts, 1973, Am. Ceram, Soc-Bull., Vol 52, p.. 383, ibid idem, Vol. 54, p 1Ø69, Austrian Patent No. 32616Ø of 1975 US Patent No- 3574531 of 1971, US Patent  No. 2713536 of 1974.<br>
Apart from phosphate glasses, other phosphate compounds have also been proposed as slow-release fertilizers. These include micronutrients added to metaphosphates of potassium or calcium prior to reaction. Volfkovich et al. , (S.I. Volfkovich, A.S. Cherepanova, I.A. Grishina &amp; G.A. Bitko, 197Ø, D. Zh. Nauki Kaz SSP (Russian? p. 3) added various metal oxides to potassium metaphosphate melts. Volfkovich reviewed the work done by the Russian school in the filed of metaphosphate based fertilizers  (S.I.   Volfkovich,  1372, J.  Appl-  Chem<br>
(USSR),  Vol.  45,  p.2479).  A   Russian   patent   (Su<br>
of 1986  127Ø148 /   describes   the  production  of   such  mixed<br>
o metaphosphate   based fertilizers  produced   at   55Ø -<br><br>
-4-<br>
o	of 199Ø<br>
88Ø C.  Two  Indian Patents  (Nos. 1728ØØ/and  1772Ø5 of<br>
1391) describe the processes for production of zinc and copper fertilizers based on low molecular weight polyphosphates. The chemistry of zinc and copper phosphate polymerisation and the chemical nature of these fertilizers have also been described (S.K. Pay, C. Varadachari &amp; K. Ghosh, 1993, Ind. Eng. Chem. Pes., Vol. 32, p. 1218; S.K.Ray, C1 Varadachari &amp; K. Ghosh, 1997, J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol-, 45, p. 1447) .<br>
The major drawbacks of using soluble salts (such as sulphates), as micronutrients fertilizers are, leaching losses, chemical transformation losses, ground water contamination and low ferti1izer-use efficiency. On the other hand, micronutrlent fertilizers having slow-release properties do not suffer any of these disadvantages. However,, both the existing types of slow-release fertilizsrs incorporating micronutrients, are not commercially successful  so far.<br>
The  major  disadvantage  of the first  group   of compounds   viz. the  phosphate  glass  frits,  is  that<br><br>
-5-<br>
the process for their production is not commercially viable; the reaction conditions, in the melting of phosphates, are so corrosive that very expensive material have to be used for furnace construction thereby limiting large scale production and increasing product costs. The major disadvantage of the second group of compounds viz the long chain metaphosphates    is;   their    excessive   insolubility<br>
particularly    in   complexants,   which  renders, the<br>
t micronutrient  ions  mostly  unavailable    for  plants.<br>
The most important factor here is that both these two types of phosphate based slow release fertilizers are essentially macronutrient (N, P or K) fertilizers containing micronutrients as supplements. There is no process available as yet for making a slow-release fertilizer that is essentially a source of micronutrients and which can thereby replace the conventional water-soluble micronutrient  fertilizers.<br><br>
-6-<br>
OBJECTS OF THE  INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a procese for the manufacture of slow release fertilizers of cationic micronutrients having a substantial reduction in production time for the initial reaction stage between phosphor ic acid and micronutrient  compounds.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for the manufacture of slow release fertilizers of cationic micronutrients and which has a simple method of assessing the upper limit of polymerisation whereby the process is rendered extremely flexible as regards choice of temperature for polymerisation and components in reacting  mixture.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a process for the manufacture of slow release fertilizers of cationic micronutrients and wherein a wide range of starting materials may be used    in   widely   ranging   proportions   and    the<br><br>
-7-<br>
polymerisation can be carried out at any convenient temperature.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose  a process  for  the  manufacture of  slow  release fertilizers  of<br>
cationic  micronutrients which is simple, requirs  lower  energy<br>
inputs than all previous processes and is readily adaptible to  a<br><br>
wide range of micronutrient formalations.        <br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION	<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of slow-release cationic micronutrient fertilizers, which comprises in heating at least one micronutrient metal or a compound thereof, with or without additives, with phosphoric acid till the resultant mixture is nearly homogeneous, further heating to form metal polyphosphates of such a degree of polymerisation that they are still soluble in dilute mineral acids and complexants, treating said metal polyphosphates with a basic compound and finally obtaining a dried powder.<br>
Compound of the micronutrient element such as their oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, sulphates or chlorides are  mixed<br>
with  phosphoric  acid  and  heated to a temperature T  above<br>
1 o 15ø to  remove  excess water and allow  completion  of  reaction.<br>
This   reaction  may  also  be  carried  out  under  vacuum,   at<br>
o temperature  lower than 15ø  . The dihydrogen phosphates are  then<br><br>
-8-<br>
further heated to 3 temperature T  which is above temperature  T<br>
2	1<br>
till  polyphosphates of the desired degree of polymerisation  are<br>
produced as observed by their solubility characteristics or average chain length estimates. The polyphosphates are subsequently neutralised with bases like ammonia, lime, sodium or potassium hydroxide. The product is dried at low temperature powdered and sieved, (i)        Zinc Fertilisers<br>
Starting materials include zinc oxide (containing upto 79% Zn) , zinc metal (containing upto 99.99% Zn), zinc ash (containing zinc oxide and metallic zinc in variable amounts), zinc sulphate (containng up to 4Ø.5% Zn) or zinc chloride (containing  upto  47.9% Zn). The zinc raw material is  added  to<br>
phosphoric  acid (containing not more than 6Ø% P Ø ) so that  the<br>
2 5 molar ratio of Zn:P in the mixture is at least 1x2 (weight  ratio<br>
Zn:P is at least 1.Ø5:1). The optimum molar ratio of Zn:P is 1:2. With P levels higher than this the initial reaction is faster but at the same time more acid groups will remain in the polyphosphate and this will requrie more base for neutralisation. Almost  any grade of acid can be used for the reaction.  However,<br>
fertilizer  grade phosphoric acids containing about  3ø -6ø %  P Ø<br>
2 5 are   suitable   and  since  acid  containing  about 5ø% P O   is<br>
2 5 the  most  commonly  available  this  is  preferred   for   the<br><br>
: 9 :<br>
reaction. The mixture of zinc compounds and phosphoric acid is taken in a porcelain crucible or a tray made of SS 316L , placed in a muffle furnace and heated at any temperature above 15ø C.At<br><br>
higher   temperatures   evaporation  is   faster. The   optimum<br><br>
temperature  is determined by the nature of the  equipment   used <br><br>
for  evaporation. Thus, in a muffle furnace 17ø oC is optimum; in<br><br>
commercial driers like a spray drier input temperatures of about 4ø oC may be needed but the duration of heating is very small -snd product temperatures donot exceed 2 ø ØoC. When evaporation is done under partial vacuum reaction temperatures may be reduced. After the reaction, the product contains mostly zinc dihydrogen phosphate; some sulphate or chloride may also be present if  such<br>
raw  materials have been used. This product is further heated  at<br>
o any  temperature  above 19Ø C for polyphosphates  to  form.  Here<br>
again,  the  temperature used for polymerisation depends  on  the<br>
o equipment used for the reaction. In a muffle furnace 35 ø C is<br>
o<br>
optimum. If a fluidised bed furnace is used 4 ø ø  C is preferred-Heating is done till a polyphospate of the desired degree of<br>
polymerisation is obtained. When such reaction is carried out in<br>
o trays or similar vessels about 6Ø min is required at 35Ø C<br>
furnace temperatures. When the reaction is done in a fluidised<br>
o bed furnace only about 15 min is required at 4øø C furnace<br>
temperatures, the product is tested at periodic intervals for<br><br>
1Ø z<br>
solubility in ø.1 N HCI , ø.33 M citric acid, ø.ØØ5 M DTPA. Polymerisation may be stopped at any stage wherein the product retains its solubility in the aforesaid reagents; the product will be observed mostly to dissolve in these reagents within 3Ø min. The optimum polymerisation stage is that prior to the formation of a product which is significantly insoluble in the acids and complexants mentioned above; in other words, the product has reached the upper limit of its solubility in these reagents. Subsequently, the reaction product is cooled to room, temperature, made into a slurry with water and mixed with ammonia solution, CaO (lime), CaCo3 (limestone), sodium carbonate (soda ash), potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Enough bases are added to raise the pH of the slurry to between 3 and 4. Too little base will result in a hygroscopic product.  Too  much of base has no particular advantage  and  may<br>
precipitate  of some of the zinc ions. After  neutralising,  when<br>
o the  pH  has  stabilised,  the  material  is  dried  at   (1øø  C,<br>
o   o preferably at 6Ø -8Ø C. It is then ground and sieved,  preferably<br>
to (1øø mesh B.S.<br>
(ii)      Copper fertilizers<br>
Starting materials include the hydroxide carbonate, sulphate or chloride of the cupric ion containing up to 49.9%, 51-4%,  25.4% and 47.Ø% Cut respectively- The copper raw  material<br><br>
11<br>
is added to phosphoric acid (containing  up to 6Ø% of P Ø ) so<br>
2 5 that  the molar ratio of Cu: P is 1:2 or higher (weight  ratio  of<br>
Cu:P is at least 1.ø 2:1). The optimum molar ratio of Cu:P is 1:3. With P ratios lower than this the cupric potyphosphate tends to insolubilise so rapidly that reaction control may be difficult. This problem is overcome at the Cu:P = 1.3 ratio. Higher . ratios of P may also be used but are of so particular advantage. all other stages of manufacture are as described above for the zinc fertiliser. Polymerisation temperature and period of heating are equipment  dependant, generally lower temperatures  are  required<br><br>
than for the zinc compounds. When the reaction is carried out  in<br>
o    o	<br>
a muffle furnace 25ø -3øø C i s optimum. Polymerisation is stopped<br>
before insolubilisation in the acids and complexants occurs. ( i i i )     Iron fertilizers<br>
Starting materials include oxides (eg.hematite), oxyhydroxides (eg.goethite), sulphate or chloride form of ferric iron, iron metal (eg.iron filings), ferrous sulphate or ferrous chloride containing up to 69.9%, 62.8%, 27.9%, 34.4%, 99-9%, 36.7% or 44.9% Fe respectively. The iron raw material is added to<br>
phosphoric acid ( containing up to 6Ø% P Ø ) so that the molar<br>
2 5 ratio of Fe:P is at least 1:3 (weight ratio 1:1.67) where  ferric<br>
compounds are used and at least 1:2 (weight ration 1:1.11) where iron metal or ferrous compounds are used. The optimum molar ratio of Fe:P in the case of ferric compounds is 1:3 and in  case<br><br>
; 12 :<br>
of ferrous compounds it is 1 :2,. All other reaction parameters art broadly as described for the zinc fertilizers. Polymerisation, however, occurs at s lower temperature than with the zinc phosphates and the polyphosphate formed is also more insoluble in dilute acids and complexants. Iron fertilizers prepared with additives have improved properties; magnesium oxide is best suited for this purpose. The optimum molar ratio of Fe :Mg is i :3, When MgO additive is used, the amount of phosphoric acid is also increased. Thus, for every mole of Mg, at least 2 moles of phosphoric sc id are to be added (Mg s P=1 :2) . The mixture of iron salt, magnesium oxide and phosphoric acid is heated at above 15ø C as described for the zinc fertilizer- Reaction is continued at  least  till a viscous gel is obtained  and  little  unreacted<br>
material  remains. This material is subsequently polymerised,  by<br>
o heating at any temperature above 2ØØ C, whereupon iron  magnesium<br>
polyphosphate   is  obtained.  reaction  is  optimum  at   25ø C,<br>
o whereupon  iron magnesium polyphosphate is obtained  reaction  is<br>
o optimum at 25Ø C, However, depending on the nature of reaction<br>
and heat contact period, reactions may also be carried out at higher temperatures. The polyphosphate with maximum solubi1ity in the testing reagents (ø.1 N HC1 , ø.33 M citric acid, ø.ØØ5 M DTPA) is chosen. It is subsequently neutralised with ammonia solution or with magnesium oxide in the presence of sufficient water to allow the neutralisation reaction to occur. Any basic<br><br>
: 13<br>
compound may be used but magnesium oxide gives the best results; the  final  pH  of the slurry should be between 4.5  and  6;  the<br>
optimum  pH. is 5.4. The neutralised material is then  dried,  at<br>
o	o   o<br>
temperatures lower than 1Ø C (preferably at 6Ø -8 Ø C) ,  finally,<br>
it is ground to a powder which passes through a 1 Ø Ø  mesh BS<br>
sieve.	<br><iv manganese fertilizers></iv>
Starting materials include managanese dioxide or manganous oxide or sulphate which may contain up to 63.4%, 77.4% or 36.4% Mn respectively. The manganese raw material is added to<br><br>
phosphoric acid such that the molar ratio 4+ of Mn:P is at least 1:4<br>
(weight  ratio  Mn :P 1 :2.26) when Mn    is used out.  The  optimum<br>
4+	2+<br>
molar  ratio of Mn;P is 1:4 <with mn and is></with>
All  other  reaction  parameters are as described  for  the  zinc<br>
fertilizer.   The manganese salt (preferably manganese  dioxide),<br>
o is mixed with phosphoric acid and heated at 15 Ø C or above, under<br>
vacuum or under normal atmospheric pressures until at least a thick viscous material is formed. This may contain a small amount   of  unreacted  particles.   At  this  stage,   manganese<br>
dihydrogen phosphate is formed.  Further heating of this compound<br>
o at  temperatures above 2 Ø Ø  C produces  manganese  polyphosphates.<br>
o Optimally, the reaction is carried out at 3 Ø Ø  C.   Polymerisation<br>
is allowed to proceed till the compound retains its solubility in the testing reagents.  Manganese polyphosphates have high water<br><br>
14<br>
solubility.   To  reduce water solubi1ity  and  improve  physical characteristics  of  the  product,  manganese  polyphosphate   is further neutralised with a basic compound such as lime,  ammonia, magnesium oxide, etc. to a pH between 5 and 6.  Best results  are obtained  with  magnesium oxide and a neutral i sat ion pH  of  5:3-Following  neutralisation,  the  product  is  dried  and  sieved. Apart  from iron, which is a micronutrient, the fertilizer  also contains   nitrogen  or  magnesium,  both  of  which   are   also micronutrients and add to the value of the fertilizer. ( v)  Cobalt fertilizers<br>
Starting  materials  include cobaltous  oxide,  sulphate  or<br>
2+ chloride  which  may  contain upto 78-6%, 38-Ø%  and  45.3%  Co<br>
respectively.   The  cobalt raw material is added  to  phosphoric such  that  the  molar ratios of Co:P is at  least  1:2  (weight ratio  Co:P - 1:1. Ø 5).  The optimum molar ratio of Co:P  is  1:2. All   other  reaction  parameters  are  as  described  for   zinc fertilizers.<br>
(vi) In an embodiment of this invention, additives such as alkali or alkaline earth metal compounds are used for improving the  solubility of the micronutrient polyphosphates in acids  and<br>
Complexants.<br>
Additives  are  useful  in  improving  the   solubility<br><br>
i5<br>
characteristics  of  a polyphosphate, particularly those  of  the<br>
3+ trivalent  and  tetravalent  metals.   Thus  Fe    polyphosphates<br>
repidly form highly insoluble polyphosphates end arresting the reaction at the desired stage may be difficult. In such cases the use of additives is advocated.<br>
Starting  materials are any of the materials  described<br>
earlier.   To  these,  magnesium oxide  or  carbonate,  potassium<br>
hydroxide or carbonate or sodium hydroxide or carbonate is added such that the molar ratio of the metal ion, M : additive is at any level from 1: Ø or higher. The micronutrient compound and the additive are added to phosphoric acid whose proportion is in excess of that described in sections (i) to (v). This excess amount is in order to compensate for the additive. Thus, optimally, for each mole of divalent cation additive, 2 moles of P is added in excess as phosphoric acid; similarly for each mole of monovalent cation as additive 1 mole of P is added in excess. The reaction is carried out as described earlier for zinc ferti1izers.<br>
(vi i)	In  a  further  embodiment  of  this   invention<br>
fertilizers are prepared containing multiple micronutrient formulations.<br>
Two  or more types of micronutrient starting  materials<br><br>
16<br>
are taken in any desired proportion- Additives are also added as described in section (vi). These sre added to phosphoric acid which is taken in a proportion as mentioned in sections (i) to (vii).  The reaction is then carried out as described in  section<br>
(i ) .<br>
The principle underlying the production of slow-release<br>
micronutrient fertilizers according to the process of the present invention, is that when metals and their oxides, hydroxides or carbonates are heated with phosphoric acid, and water is removed from the reacting mixture, the dihydrogen orthophosphates are produced. When sulphates or chlorides of the metal ions are used for reaction, heating results in loss of water and some sulphuric or hydrochloric acid leaving a residue of mixed sulphates/chlorides and orthophosphates. On further heating the polyphosphates, linear polyphosphate chains are formed which have<br>
-P-O-F-O-P iinkages.  The negatively charged Ø atoms on the P-O-P<br>
2+ chains  are the sites to which micronutrient cations  like  Zn  ,<br>
2+    3+	+<br>
CU  , Fe  , etc. or H  ion is attached.  The cations with  double<br>
or triple charges may also cross-1ink adjacent p-O-P chains to form a 3-D structure which may have low solubility in acids and complexants. For this reason additives like Mg , Na , K etc. help in reducing the number and bond ^strength of such cross-linkages of P-Ø-P chains and thereby improving solubility characteristics.  Polymerisation is not allowed to proceed up  to<br><br>
17<br>
the stage where very long chain metaphosphates are formed since such compounds are highly insoluble and the micronutrients in them are not avail able to plants. Polymerisation is stopped when the polyphosphates are not fully polymerised and the products show good solubility in dilute acids and complexants. Polyphosphates with these solubili ty parameters contain nutrients in a form that is available for plant uptake. However such polyphosphate which are of incompletely Pplymerised are hygroscopic  and acidic.  Both these undesirable  characteristics <br>
are  due  to  the  presence of hydrogen  ions  on the  partially polymerised  polyphosphate  chain, Neutralisation  of  such  acid groups with bases, renders the product non-hygroscopic as well as non-acidic.   It  also  reduces  the  water  solubility  of   the polyphosphate.<br>
This invention presents a substantial improvement over previous processes for the production of slow-release micronutrient fertilizers.  In this process, the initial reaction<br>
between  metal  compounds and phosphoric acid is carried  out  at<br>
o temperatures  above  15Ø C to speed up the  reaction  and  remove<br>
o moisture.  Since 15 Ø is close to the boiling point of phosphoric<br>
acid  evaporation  is very slow and, therefore, for  purposes  of<br>
o commercial   production   temperatures  above   15Ø    are   more<br>
sppropri ate since the process is significantly faster.This invention a<br><br>
18<br>
includes the new concept that, the extent to which any micronutrient phosphate should be polymerised is limited by the solubility  of  the  polyphosphate product in  dilute  acids  and<br>
solutions  of complexants.  Thus any suitable  temperature  above<br>
o 15 Ø C  may  be  chosen for producing the  polyphosphate  and  the<br>
reaction is stopped at any stage before insolubilisation in the aforesaid reagents.<br>
Accordingly, this invention provides a process for the production of slow-release fertilizers of all cationic micronutrients, in single- or multinutrient forms. The products have low water solubility but the nutrients are in a form available to plants. The fertilizers are also non-toxic, non-hygroscopic , easy to apply and exhibit improved fertilizer-use efficiency.<br>
The main advantage of this process is the significant reduction in production time for the initial reaction stage between phosphoric acid and micronutrient compounds. Another advantage of this process is the simple technique of assessing the upper limit of polymerisation whereby the process is rendered extremely flexible as regards choice of temperature for polymerisation and components in reacting mixture. Thus, a wide range of starting materials may be used in widely ranging proportions  and  the polymerisation can be carried  out  at  any<br><br>
19<br>
convenient temperature; the polymerisation is stopped once a simple test reveals that the upper limit of polymerisation, is reached.   Lastly, the process on the whole is simple  requires<br><br>
lower energy inputs than all previous processes and is readily adaptable to a wide range of micronutrient formulations.<br>
The  invention will now be explained in greater  detail with the help of the following non-limiting examples. Examples for zinc fertilizer Example 1<br>
Phosphoric  acid  (containing 52% P Ø  was taken  in  a<br>
2 5 stainless  steel  tray.  To 16 Ø g of the acid 5 Ø g  of  zinc  ash<br>
(containing 72.1% Zn) was added. The material was allowed to stand for 3Ø min for frothing to subside.  Frothing is due to the<br>
reaction  of metallic zinc with acid.  The mixture was  then  put<br>
o into  a muffle furnace at 17 Ø C and heated until a  mostly  dried<br>
product  was formed which is mostly Zn(H PO ) .  The  temperature<br>
2  4 2 o of  the  furnace  was increased to 35 Ø C  and  the  material  was<br>
further heated for 6 Ø mm. Preliminary trials had shown that heating beyond this period to 7Ø min and more results in the formation of polyphosphates which are not completely soluble in Ø.1N HCI, Ø.33M citric acid and Ø. ØØ5 M DTPA. The solubility of the polyphosphate was tested in these reagents ; Ø.5g of the polyphosphate dissolved in 15Ø ml Ø.1N HCI, 4Ø ml Ø.33 M citric acid and 35Ø ml Ø. ØØ5 M DTPA within 15 min- The average  chain   length   (n)  of  the  polyphosphate  was   2.5,<br><br>
- 2Ø-<br>
The  polyphosphate was allowed to cool to ambient temperature  it<br>
was made into a paste with water and 58.5 ml of 25% NH   solution<br>
3 was added to it. The pH after neutralisation was 4.Ø. The  slurry<br>
o was stirred and dried in an oven at 8Ø C. The dried material  was<br>
ground in a mortar and sieved through 1ØØ mesh B. S.<br>
The material thus obtained had the composition 21% Zn , 19.1% P and 5.1% N.In Ø.1 N HCI, Ø.33 M citric acid and Ø-ØØ5 M. DTPA, the Zn in it is almost 1ØØ% soluble. About 7.5% of the' Zn in it was soluble in water. The fertilizer remained undissolved in water for several months- Field trials with the fertilizer showed that 1.14 kg Zn added as this slow-release fertilizer increased the yield of paddy by 4ØØ-6ØØ kg/ha in the first crop and to a similar extent in the second crop (residual effect). The requirements of this zinc fertilizer are about one-fifth to two-fifth the normal recommended dose for zinc sulphate. This fertilizer is also very effective in soils where zinc sulphate shows little response.<br>
Example II<br>
The entire process was the same as in example 1 except that during neutralisation 82 g CaCO was used instead of ammonia. The composition of this sample was 19.5% Zn, 18% P and 9.6% Ca.<br><br>
-  21-<br>
Example III<br>
The entire process was the same as in Example I  except that  during  neutralisat ion 46 g KOH dissolved in  about  8Ø  ml water was used instead of ammonia solution. Example IV<br>
The entire process was the same as in Example I  except that zinc oxide ( contain ing 78% Zn) was used instead of zinc ash as  the  starting material. 1ØØ g of the zinc oxide  was  reacted<br>
with 324 g phosphoric acid containing  52% P Ø . The  composition<br>
2 5       <br>
of  the fertilizer obtained was as follows 22.9% Zn, 25.Ø% P  and<br>
4.7% IM. Example V<br>
The entire process was the same as Example 1 except that metal lie zinc <zinc dust containing about zn> was used instead of zinc ash, as the starting material. 1ØØ g of zinc dust<br>
was reacted wi th 4Ø9 g of phosphoric acid containing 52% P Ø .<br>
2 5 Example VI<br>
Phosphoric  acid  containing 23% P Ø  was  taken  in  a<br>
2 5 stainless  steel  tray.  To 37Ø g of the acid 5Ø g  of  zinc  ash<br>
(containing  72-1%  Zn) was added. It was allowed  to  stand  for<br>
about  3Ø min for the frothing to subside. This was  subsequently<br>
o put  into a muffle furnace and heated at 2ØØ C till  the  product<br>
was  almost  dry. The furnace temperature was then  increased  to<br>
o 3ØØ C  and  the  sample  heated for 9Ø  mm.  solubility  of  the<br><br>
: 22  :<br>
polyphosphate in Ø.1 N HCI, Ø.33 M citric acid and Ø.ØØ5  M  DTPA<br>
was tested. The polyphosphate dissolved in these reagents  within<br>
15  min. After cooling to ambient temperature it was made into a<br>
paste with about 3Ø ml water and 58.5 ml of 25% ammonia  solution,<br>
was  added  to  it.  The pH after  neutralisation  was 4.Ø.  The <br>
material  was dried in an area at 6Øo C ground and sieved  through <br>
1ØØ  mesh  B.S. The material thus obtained  had  the  composition ^-^<br>
2Ø.9% Zn, 18-9% P and 5.5.% N. Other characteristics were similar<br>
to the fertilizer described in Example 1.	<br>
Example for copper fertilizer Example VII<br>
1Ø  g cupric hydroxide (containing 53.6% Cu) was  taken in  a porcelain dish.  To this 38 g phosphoric  acid  [containing<br>
46.4%  P Ø (w/w)] was added. The molar ratio of Cu:P  was,  thus, 2 5<br>
o 1;3.  The mixture was placed in a muffle furnace at 18Ø C till  a<br>
clear  viscous material was obtained. This was further heated  at<br>
o 25Ø C  for  6Ø min. The cupric polyphosphate was tested  for  its<br>
solubility. It was observed to be soluble in Ø.1N HCI, Ø.33 M c itric acid and Ø.ØØ5 M DTPA wi thin 3Ø min. The sample was made into a slurry with a few ml water and neutralised to pH 4.Ø  with<br>
1Ø%  NH  solution (about 8 ml). It was then dried in an  oven  at<br>
3 o 8Ø C, ground and sieved through 1ØØ mesh B.S.<br>
The  fertilizer had the composition 13.6% Cu,  19.6%  P<br><br>
-23-<br>
and 16.3% N. It had an average chain length (n) of 2.65 and  5-2H of total Cu was soluble in water.<br>
The material remained stable in contact with water for several months. It was completely soluble in the dilute acids and complexants mentioned above. Plant growth trials with paddy showed significant increase in yields over the control at dosages as low as 2.Ø kg/ha Cu; at this level copper sulphate does not result in any yield increase.<br>
Example VIII	<br>
1Ø g cupric chloride (containing 36.5% Cu) was taken in<br>
a  porcelain crucible. Phosphoric acid (containing 5##% P Ø )  was<br>
2 5 added such that the molar ratio Cu:P was 1:3 (24.5 g acid added).<br>
o The  crucible was put into a muffle furnace at 17Ø C  and  heated<br>
till a dried substance, was obtained having a light green colour.<br>
o This  was  again heated at 2ØØ C for 3Ø min. During  this  period<br>
samples of the polyphosphate were periodically taken and tested for their solubility in Ø.1 N HCl, Ø.33 M citric acid and Ø.ØØ5 M DTPA. The sample was removed from the furnace at that stage when the material begins to solubilise slowly (within 3Ø min) but insoluble materials are not yet formed. The average chain-length (n) of the polyphosphate was 2.5.<br>
The polyphosphate was cooled to room temperature,  made<br><br>
-24-<br>
into a slurry with a few drops of water and then neutralised with<br>
1Ø% ammonia solution upto a pH of 4.Ø, This was dried in an  oven<br>
o at 7Ø C, powdered and sieved through 15Ø mesh B.S.<br>
Example IX<br>
To  1Ø g cupric carbonate (cDntainig 5Ø.Ø% Cu) 24 g  of<br>
phosphoric acid (46-4% P O) was added so that the molar ratio of<br>
2 5<br>
o CusP  =  1:2. This was placed in a muffle furnace  at  18Ø C  and<br>
heated till almost dry. This was further heated at 225 C for 49 min.  The  remaining procedure is the same as that  described  in<br><br>
Examp1e VII.<br>
Samples for iron fertiliser<br>
Example X<br>
The  starting  material  was  synthetic  qoethite   [a-FeØ(ØH)] containing 6Ø%. To 175Ø g of phosphoric acid (containing<br>
39.7%  w/w of P Ø ), 1ØØg goethite and 13Øg magnesium oxide  were<br>
2 5 added and the mixture was stirred. The amount of phosphoric  acid<br>
taken was such that the Fe:P molar ratio  was 1:3 plus an  excess<br>
amount such that the Mg:P molar ratio was 1:2. This was placed in<br>
o a muff1e furnace in flat trays iss 316L ) and heated at 18Ø C till<br>
it   was  almost  dry.  The  temperature  of  the   furnace   was<br>
o subsequently increased to 25Ø C and the sample was heated for  1Ø<br>
min. Solubility of the sample was tested at periodic intervals, in Ø.1N HCl, Ø.33 M citric acid, and Ø.ØØ5 M DTPA- Solubility of the  polyphosphates  in these reagents increases with  period  of<br><br>
25<br>
heating,  reaches  a  maximum  and  declines  again.  The	ideal<br>
palyphosphate  would be around the region of the  maximum-	Water<br>
solubility   of   the  polyphosphste  and  the   material	after<br>
neutralisat ion  were  also tested; polyphosphates  having	lowest<br>
water solubility are preferred. Thus, al though the  polyphosphate<br>
o obtained  after  heating  at 25Ø C for 1Ø min  and  2Ø  min ,have<br>
similar  solubi1ities in acids and complexants,  the  neutralised<br>
products of the former has much lower water solubi1ity than  that<br>
o of the latter. Therefore the material obtained at 25Ø C after  1Ø<br>
min  heating was preferred. The weight loss of the  polyphosphate<br>
at  this  stage is afoout 9g/1ØØg H PO  in the  reaction  mixture.<br>
3  4 This corresponds to 53% polymerisation.<br>
The polyphosphste is cooled to ambient temperature, made into a paste with water and neutralised with dilute ammonia solution  (containing about 12,5% NH ) bill the pH of the  slurry<br>
was  around 5,4, This required I.751 of 12-5%  ammoni a  solution.<br>
o The slurry was stirred and dried in an oven at 7Ø C, it was  hand<br>
ground  and  sieved  through  8Ø  mesh  E<s. the fertiliser was completely soluble in hcl and citric acid but only water. example xi></s.>
The entire process was the same as in Example X except that  magnesium  oxide  was used for  neutralisation  instead  of<br><br>
26<br>
ammonia solution. In this case the pH of the solution was raised to 4.5 by addition of MgO (about 55Ø g)- The suspension was heated  to  6ØoC and stirred for one hour-  It  was subsequently<br>
processed as described earlier.	<br><br><br>
The product contained 3.7% Fe, 45. 4% P Ø and 25.3% Mo<br><br>
It  had a water solubi1ity of around Ø.1%. Other parameters  were<br>
the same as for Example X.<br>
Example X.II	<br>
The process is essentially the same as in Example	X and<br>
XI  except  that natural goethite  (containing 45%  Fe)  is	used<br>
instead  of  synthetic  goethite.  1ØØg  natural  goethite,	95g<br>
magnesiunr oxide and 152Øg phosphoric acid (containing 39-7%	P Ø )<br>
were   mixed   and   processed  as  described   in   Example   X.<br>
o Polymerisation, in this case, was carried out at 2ØØ C for 25 roin<br>
till  a  weight  loss  of about 7g/1ØØg  H PO   in  the  reaction<br>
3  4 mixture,  was  obtained. The polyphosphate was  neutralised  with<br>
ammonia  solution  (12.5%,  1.65 1) to a pM  of  around  5.4  and subsequently processed as in Example X. The properties of the two materials were similar. Example XIII<br>
1ØØg niaqnanese dioxide (pyrolusite) containing 63-4% Mn<br>
was  mixed with 5ØØg of phosphoric acid containing 51%  P Ø (Mn;F3<br>
2 5 ratio  in  the mixture  = 1:4). This was  taken  in  a  poreelain<br><br>
:  27  :<br>
o<br>
crucible  and heated at 17Ø C till a thick gel-like material  was<br>
o formed.  The temperature of the furnace was raised to  3ØØ C  and<br>
the crucible was kept in it for 5Ø min. Thereupon a dark  purple, hard  solid was formed, which had the maximum solubility  in  the<br>
testing  reagents. The corresponding weight loss  was  15.4g/1ØØg<br><br>
H PO    in  the  reaction  mixture,  which  produces  about   55%<br>
3  3<br>
polymerisation.<br><br>
The  polyphosphste was cooled to  ambient  temperature, made into a paste with water and neutralised with mactnesium oxide<br>
to  a  pH  of  about 5.3. About 4ØØ g  MgO  was  required;  after<br>
o addition  the slurry was stirred at 6Ø C for about one  hour  for<br>
o completion  of  the  reaction. The material was  dried  at  7Ø C,<br>
ground  and sieved through 1ØØ mesh BS. The fertilizer  contained<br>
7.5% Mn, 35.3%P Ø  and 29% MG . Solubility in water was about Ø.1%<br>
2 5 but  in  Ø.1 N HC1 and Ø.33M citric acid it was  soluble  to  the<br>
extent of about 9Ø-95%. Example XIV<br>
1Øg cobalt oxide was mixed with 51g phosphoric acid  of 5Ø% strength to give a Co:P ratio of 1:3. To this 67.7g potassium<br>
hydroxide  and a further 17Øg phosphoric acid were added to  give<br>
o K:Co=1Ø:l and KsP-l:l- The slurry was heated at 13Ø C till dried-<br>
o This  was further heated at 25Ø C for 3Ø min to obtain the  mixed<br><br>
28<br>
polyphosphate of potassium snd cobalt. The polyhosphate was cooled to ambient temperature, made to a paste with water and neutralised with potassium hydroxide to pH 5. Subsequently it was ground with a hand mortar and sieved through 1ØØ mesh. The fertilizer was completely soluble in Ø.1N HC1 and Ø.33 M citric acid . Example XV<br>
1ØØg  natural goethite and 1ØØq manganese dioxide  were mixed  with  1 .541  phosphoric acid (containing  4Ø%  P Ø ). The<br>
mixture was put into a muffle furnace and heated at 2ØØ C for  5Ø<br>
min   whereupon  a  mostly  homogenous  gel  was  obtained.   The<br>
o temperature of the furnace was raised to 35Ø C and the sample was<br>
heated for 3Ø min. Optimum polymerisation was tested as described in the previous Examples. Subsequent processing was done as described in Example XIII except that 9ØØ g of magnesium oxide was required for neutralisation of the polyphosphate. This fertiliser containing both iron and msganese, has low water solubi1ity (about 2%) but high solubi1ity in dilute acids and comp1exants.<br><br>
