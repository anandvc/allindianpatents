"HERBICIDAL COMPOSITIONS FOR SELECTIVE CONTROL OF WEEDS"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organized under the laws of Germany, D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
ORGN<br>
825/MUM/2000<br><br>
5 NOV 2007   5-11-2007<br><br>
The present invention relates to herbicidal composition for selective control of weeds.<br>
The invention relates to novel herbicidal synergistic active compound combinations comprising, on the one hand, known pyrimidine derivatives and, on the other hand, known herbicidally active compounds and/or safeners, which combinations can be used particularly successfully for the selective control of weeds in various crops of useful plants.<br>
Pyrimidine derivatives, as broad-spectrum herbicides, form part of the subject-matter of a'number of patent applications (cf. US 4 906 285, EP-A-321 846, EP-A658 549, US 4 248 619, US 4 427 437). However, the known pyrimidine derivatives have a number of gaps in their activity. Likewise, the compatibility of these compounds with crop plants is not always entirely satisfactory.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that a number of known active compounds from the group of the phenoxypyrimidine derivatives, when used together with known herbicidally active compounds from various substance classes, have pronounced synergistic effects with respect to the activity against weeds and can be used par-. ticularly advantageously as broad-spectrum combination preparations for the selective . control of weeds in crops of useful plants, such as cereals, for example wheat, barley, rye and rice.<br>
Surprisingly, it has also been found that the phenoxypyrimidine derivatives, on their own or together with known herbicidally active compounds, when used together with the compounds described below, which improve crop plant compatibility (safeners/-antidotes) prevent damage to the crop plants particularly effectively, and they can be used particularly advantageously as broad-spectrum combination preparations for the selective control of weeds in crops of useful plants, such as cereals, for example wheat, barley, rye and rice.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention provides selective herbicidal compositions, characterized in that they comprise an effective amount of an active compound combination comprising<br>
(a)       at least one phenoxypyrimidine derivative of the general formula (I)<br><br><br><br>
in which<br>
R        represents hydrogen, -CH2CH2S(0)nRi (where R\ represents C4-C4-alkyl and n represents 0, 1 or 2) or<br><br>
where<br>
R2 represents hydrogen, halogen, cyano, phenyl, C^-Cg-allcyl, Ci-C4-alkoxy, Ci-C4-alkylthio, Ci-C4-alkoxycarbonyl, mono-or oU-Ci-C4-alkylaminocarbonyl, phenyl-Ci-C4-alkylarnino-carbonyl, where the phenyl group may optionally be substituted by halogen, Ci-C2-alkyl or Ci-C2-alkoxy, furylmemylamino--carbonly or phenyl, and<br>
R3 represents in each case optionally halogen-, cyano-, nitro-, Ci-C4-alkyl-, C][-C4-alkoxy- or allyloxy-substituted phenyl, represents optionally Ci-C4-aIkyl-, phenoxy-, benzyloxy- or acetoxy-substituted amino, represents Ci-C4-alkylthio or repre-<br><br>

and optionally<br><br><br><br><br><br>
c) at least one of the compounds of group 3, which improve crop plant compatibility, where preference is given to those compounds which are mentioned above in preferred ranges.<br>
Most preference according to the invention is given to selective herbicidal compositions which are characterized in that they comprise an amount of an active compound combination comprising<br>
2,6-bis[(4,6-dimemoxy-2-pyrimidinyl)oxy]-benzoate (sodium), (bispyribac-sodium) of the formula<br><br>
and<br><br>
one or more compounds from a second group of herbicides which comprises the active compounds mentioned above under b), where particular preference is given to the active compounds<br><br>
N-isopropyl-N-(4-fluorophenyl)-(5-trifluoromethyl-l,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl-oxy)-acetamide of the formula<br><br><br><br>
2-(2-methoxycarbonyl-phenylsulphonylaminocarbonyl)-4-methyl-5-n-propoxy-2,4-dihydro-3H-l,2,4-triazol-3-one or a sodium salt of this compound of the formula<br><br>
and<br>
2-(2-tTifluoromemoxy-phenylsulphonylaminocarbonyl)-4-methyl-5-methoxy-2,4-dihydro-3H-l,2,4-triazol-3-one or a sodium salt of this compound of the formula<br><br>
and optionally<br>
at least one of the compounds of group 3, which improve crop plant compatibility, where preference is given to those compounds which are mentioned above in preferred ranges.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the active compound combinations denned above of the phenoxypyrimidine derivatives of the formula (I) and the active compounds of group 2 listed above in combination with active compounds of group 3, have particularly high herbicidal activity combined with very good useful plant<br><br><br>
compatibility and can be used in various crops, in particular in rice and wheat, but additionally in maize and barley, for the selective control of weeds.<br>
Surprisingly, the herbicidal activity of the active compound combinations according to the invention of compounds of groups 1 and 2 listed above is considerably higher than the sum of the activities of the individual active compounds.<br>
This means that there is not only a supplementary action but an unforeseeable synergistic effect. The novel active compound combinations are tolerated well by a large number of crops, and the novel active compound combinations also effectively control weeds which are otherwise difficult to control. The novel active compound combinations are therefore a valuable addition to the selective herbicides.<br>
Furthermore, it has surprisingly been found that the active compound combinations defined above of phenoxypyrimidine derivatives of the formula (I) and/or their salts and a safener/antidote ("active compound of group 3") in combination with one or more of the abovementioned active compounds of group 2 have particularly high herbicidal activity combined with very good useful plant compatibility and can be used in various crops, in particular in cereals, especially wheat, but also soya, potato, maize and rice, for the selective control of weeds.<br>
Moreover, it has surprisingly been found that the safener role described above can also be played by the herbicidally active substance MCPA and the substance 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid (2,4-D) and its derivatives.<br>
A preferred embodiment is therefore also a mixture comprising, on the one hand, a compound of the formula (I) and/or its salts and, on the other hand, 2,4-D and/or its derivatives, optionally in combination with one or more of the abovementioned active compounds of group 2. Typical derivatives of 2,4-D are, for example, its esters.<br><br><br><br><br>
A preferred embodiment is furthermore a mixture comprising, on the one hand, a compound of the formula (I) and/or its salts and, on the other hand, MCP A, optionally in combination with one or more of the abovementioned active compounds of group 2.<br>
The compounds diethyl l-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-methyl-lH-pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylate (mefenpyr-diethyl), (l-methylhexyl)-[(5-chloro-8-quinolinyl)oxy]acetate (cloquintocet-mexyl) and ethyl l-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(trichloromethyI)-lH-l,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylate (fenchlorazole-ethyl) are described in the patent applications below: DE-A-39 39 503, EP-A-191 736 and DE-A-35 25 205, respectively. 2,4-D is a known herbicide. (4-Chloro-2-methylphenoxy)-acetic acid (MCPA) is likewise a known herbicide.<br>
Furthermore, it is surprising that, &amp;om a large number of known safeners or antidotes capable of antagonizing the damaging effect of a herbicide on the crop plants, specifically the compounds of group (c) listed above which neutralize the damaging effect of compounds of the formula (I) and their salts, optionally also in combination with one or more of the abovementioned active compounds of group 2, on the crop plants virtually completely without adversely affecting the herbicidal activity against the weeds.<br>
The particularly advantageous effect of the particularly preferred combination partners of group (c), in particular with respect to sparing cereal plants, such as, for example, rice, wheat, barley and rye, as crop plants, may be emphasized here.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can be employed, for example, in connection with the following plants:<br>
Dicotyledonous weeds of the genera: Sinapis, Lepidium, Galium, Stellaria, Matricaria, Anthemis, Galinsoga, Chenopodium, Urtica, Senecio, Amaranthus, Portulaca, Xanthium, Convolvulus, Ipomoea, Polygonum, Sesbania, Ambrosia, Cirsium, Carduus,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Sonchus, Solanum, Rorippa, Rotala, Lindernia, Lamium, Veronica, Abutilon, Emex, Datura, Viola, Galeopsis, Papaver, Centaurea, Trifolium, Ranunculus, Taraxacum.<br>
Dicotyledonous crops of the genera: Gossypium, Glycine, Beta, Daucus, Phaseolus, Pisum, Solanum, Linum, Ipomoea, Vicia, Nicotiana, Lycopersicon, Arachis, Brassica, Lactuca, Cucumis, Cuburbita.<br>
Monocotyledonous weeds of the genera: Echinochloa, Setaria, Panicum, Digitaria, Phleum, Poa, Festuca, Eleusine, Brachiaria, Lolium, Bromus, Avena, Cyperus, Sorghum, Agropyron, Cynodon, Monochoria, Fimbristylis, Sagittaria, Eleocharis, Scirpus, Paspalum, Ischaemum, Sphenoclea, Dactyloctenium, Agrostis, Alopecurus, Apera, Phalaris.<br>
Monocotyledonous crops of the genera: Oryza, Zea, Triticum, Hordeum, Avena, Secale, Sorghum, Panicum, Saccharum, Ananas, Asparagus, Alhum.<br>
However, the use of the active compound combinations according to the invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. By plants are understood here all plants and plant populations, such as desired and undesirable wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including transgenic plants and including plant varieties which can or cannot be protected by varietal property rights. Parts of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include vegetative and<br><br><br>
generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multiÂ¬layer coating.<br>
The synergistic effect of the active compound combinations according to the invention is particularly strongly pronounced at certain concentration ratios. However, the ratios by weight of the active compounds in the active compound combinations can be varied within relatively wide ranges. In general, from 0.01 bis 1000 parts by weight, preferably from 0.05 to 500 parts by weight and particularly preferably from 0.1 to 100 parts by weight of active compound of group 2 are present per part by weight of active compound of the formula (I).<br>
The advantageous effect of the crop plant compatibility of the active compound combinations according to the invention is likewise particularly strongly pronounced at certain concentration ratios.. However, the ratios by weight of the active compounds in the active compound combinations can be varied within relatively wide ranges. In general, from 0.001 to 1000 parts by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 100 parts by weight and particularly preferably from 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of one of the compounds mentioned above under (c), which improve crop plant compatibility (antidotes/safeners), are present per part by weight of active compound of the formula (I), its salts or its mixtures with active compounds of group 2.<br>
The active compound combinations can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble   powders,   granules,   suspo-emulsion   concentrates,   natural   and   synthetic<br><br><br>
substances impregnated with active compound, and very fine capsules in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surface-active agents, that is emulsifying agents and/or dispersing agents and/or foam-forming agents.<br>
If the extender used is water it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Suitable liquid solvents are in the main: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics. and chlorinated aliphatic hydroÂ¬carbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, as well as synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifying and/or foam-forming agents are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkylsulphates, arylsulphonates as well as protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersing agents are: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Tackifiefs such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latexes, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations in general comprise between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight, preferably between 0.5 and 90%, of active compounds, including the safening active compounds.<br>
In general, the active compound combinations according to the invention are applied in the form of ready mixes. However, the active compounds which the active compound combinations comprise can also be formulated individually and mixed upon use, i.e. applied in the form of tank mixes.<br>
The novel active compound combinations can be used as such or in the form of their formulations, and furthermore also as mixtures with other known herbicides, ready mixes or tank mixes again being possible. They may also be mixed with other known active compounds, such as fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematicides, bird repellents, growth substances, plant nutrients and agents which improve soil structure. For particular application purposes, in particular when applied post-emergence, it may furthermore be advantageous to incorporate, in the formulations, mineral or vegetable oils which are tolerated by plants (for example the commercial product "Oleo DuPont HE") or ammonium salts such as, for example, ammonium sulphate or ammonium thiocyanate, as further additives.<br><br><br>
The novel active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or in the use forms prepared therefrom by further dilution, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, emulsions, powders, pastes and granules. They are used in the customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, dusting or broadcasting.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can be applied before and after the plants have emerged, that is to say pre-emergence and post-emergence. They can also be incorporated into the soil before sowing.<br>
A synergistic effect in herbicides is always present when the herbicidal activity of the active compound combination exceeds the activity of the active compounds when applied individually.<br>
The expected activity for a given combination of two herbicides can be calculated as follows (cf. COLBY, S.R.: "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations", Weeds 15, pages 20 - 22, 1967):<br>
If        X        =	% damage by herbicide A (active compound of the formula I)<br>
at an application rate of p kg/ha<br>
and     Y        =	% damage by herbicide B (active compound of the formula II)<br>
at an application rate of q kg/ha<br>
and     E        =        the expected damage of the herbicides A and B at application rates of p and q kg/ha<br>
then     E	=	X +Y - (X * Y/100).<br>
If the  actual  damage  exceeds  the  calculated  value,  then  the  activity  of the combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect exists.<br><br><br><br><br>
Examples Example 1<br>
MKH 6561 and bispyribac-sodium (wheat / post-emergence spring)<br>
To examine a possible synergism, the compounds MKH 6561 and bispyribac-sodium (KIH 2023) were tested under outdoor conditions in one of the main cultivation areas of winter wheat in Great Britain against the economically important weed grass Alopecurus myosuroides Huds. The small-plot experiment was carried out on cultivated land under agricultural use. An area with particularly extensive weed growth was chosen.<br>
The active compounds were applied across the area by the spray method, with a medium droplet size, post-emergence in spring. To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, the active compounds were formulated as 70 WG (70% w/w water-dispersible powder) or 400 SC (400 g/1 suspension concentrate) and suspended in water. The spray liquor was then applied at a water application rate of 200 1/ha, which is customary in practice.<br>
To assess the crop compatibility, after the treatment, plant growth inhibitions or paling of the leaf area was assessed in % damage in comparison to the development of the untreated control. At the time of blossom, the herbicidal activity was assessed as % reduction in comparison to the untreated control, based on the number of ears. The figures denote:<br>
0 % = no damage of the crops or no herbicidal effect, 100 % = total destruction of the crops or the weeds.<br>
In this test, MKH 6561 and KIH 2023 showed a highly pronounced synergism in the action against Alopecurus myosuroides (Table 1). The activity was considerably<br><br><br><br>
higher than the value which had been expected for the mixture according to Colby's formula. Damage to the crop did not occur.<br>

MCPA and bispyribac-sodium (rice, post-emergence)<br>
To examine a possible safener action, the compound MCPA was tested together with bispyribac-sodium in rice against Echinochloa spp. (E. crus-galli, E. erecta).<br><br><br><br>
The active compounds were applied post-emergence in spring. The undesirable plants were in a development stage of from 13 to 15 or from 21 to 23 according to the BBCH scale for standard classification of the phenological development stages of mono- and dicotyledonous plants. The rice plants were in a development stage of from 13 to 14 or from 21 to 22, according to the BBCH scale (Feller et al. 1995, Nachrichtenbl. Deut. Pflanzenschutzd. 47, 193-206).<br>
To assess the safener effect of MCPA, the phytotoxicity of bispyribac-sodium (KTH 2023) was tested with and without MCPA, and the yield in kg/ha, the number of ears per m2 and the weight of the rice grains (weight per 1000 grains in g) were determined (Table 2).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Without MCPA, there was a slight phytotoxicity. This is not observed when MCPA is present. With respect to the yield, there was a statistically significant difference (8210 kg/ha without and 11,010 kg/ha with MCPA). There were also differences in the number of ears per m^ and the weight of 1000 grains.<br>

FOE 5043 and KTH 2023 (pre-emergence/post-emergence)<br>
To examine a possible synergism, the compounds FOE 5043 and KIH 2023 were tested under greenhouse conditions against various weeds.<br>
To this end, the amount of active substance required in each case is dissolved in a few millilitres, in general 2-3 ml, of the solvent (acetone or DMF), emulsifiers added (1 ml) and the resulting concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Mixtures of two or more active compounds are prepared by mixing the concentrates, prepared as above, of the active compounds in question, adding, if appropriate, further active compounds, formulations or other substances, followed by dilution with water to the desired concentration.<br>
In general, a surfactant, for example Renex 36, is added in a concentration of 0.1% (w/v) to the spray liquors intended for the post-emergence test.<br>
The amount of active compound or its formulation in the solutions to be tested corresponds to the desired application rates per ha.<br>
Pre-emergence<br>
Seeds of the test plants are sown in normal soil. After 24 h, the desired amount of active substance, as active ingredient or formulation, is sprayed onto the surface of the soil. The concentration of the active substance in the spray liquor is chosen so that the desired application rate can be applied in 500 1 of water/ha.<br>
Post-emergence<br>
Test plants are grown under controlled temperature and light conditions. When the plants have reached a height of from 5 to 15 cm, the test solution is sprayed.<br><br>
The concentration of the active substance in the spray liquor is chosen so that the desired application rate can be applied in 500 1 water/ha.<br>
Evaluation is carried out about three weeks after application. The herbicidal activity is assessed visually in comparison to the untreated control. The figures denote<br>
0%      =	no herbicidal effect, corresponds to the untreated control<br>
100% =	total destruction of the test plants.<br><br><br><br>
In these tests, FOE .5043 and KIH 2023 showed a highly pronounced synergism in the action against various weeds (Tables 3-15; the values marked (*) were calculated according to Colby, 1967).<br>

Cloquintocet and KIH 2023 (barley/wheat, post-emergence)<br>
To examine the safener effect of cloquintocet, this compound was tested together with KIH 2023 in barley and wheat.<br>
To assess the safener effect of cloquintocet, the phytotoxicity of KIH 2023 was tested with and without MCPA (see Tab. 28 and 29).<br>
The assessment itself was carried out according to Example 1, i.e. the crop compatibility was rated in % damage, based on the development of the untreated control. Again, the figures denote:<br>
0%      =        no damage of the crop or no herbicidal effect<br>
100% =	total destruction of the crop.<br>
In the tests, cloquintocet showed a considerable safener effect.<br><br><br>
