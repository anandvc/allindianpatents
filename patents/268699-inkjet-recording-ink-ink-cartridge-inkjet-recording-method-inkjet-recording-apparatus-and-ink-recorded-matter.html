				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
INKJET RECORDING INK, INK CARTRIDGE, INKJET<br>
RECORDING METHOD, INKJET RECORDING APPARATUS,<br>
AND INK RECORDED MATTER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an inkjet recording ink<br>
capable of providing high image density and excellent storage<br>
stability thereof and a pigment dispersion liquid therein and<br>
preventing the occurrence of clogging at inkjet heads, an ink<br>
cartridge, an inkjet recording method, an inkjet recording<br>
apparatus, and an ink recorded matter.<br>
Background Art<br>
A method for inkjet recording has advantages in that it<br>
facilitates full-color printing because processes in the method<br>
for inkjet recording is simpler than processes in other methods<br>
for recording and it allows for obtaining high-resolution images<br>
even by a simply structured apparatus of the method for inkjet<br>
recording.<br>
As an ink used in such a method for inkjet recording, a<br>
dye-based ink is typically used in which various water-soluble<br>
dyes are dissolved in water or a mixed liquid containing water<br>
and an organic solvent, however, dye-based inks have a<br>
disadvantage in that they are poor in light resistance, although<br>
they are excellent in color tone sharpness. On the other hand,<br>
a pigment-based ink in which a carbon black or various organic<br>
pigments are dispersed is actively studied because of its<br>
excellence in light resistance, as compared to dye-based inks.<br>
However, the pigment-based inks tend to easily cause<br>
nozzle clogs as compared to dye-based inks.<br>
The pigment-based ink is prepared by preparing a<br>
dispersion in which a coloring material and a dispersant are<br>
preliminarily dispersed in an aqueous solvent such as water and<br>
alcohols, dispersing the dispersion to a predetermined degree<br>
using a media type dispersing device such as sand mill, and then<br>
diluting the dispersion to a predetermined concentration.<br>
Typically, in a water-based pigment ink, a surfactant or a<br>
water-soluble resin is used for dispersing a hydrophobic pigment,<br>
however, the reliability of quality of obtained images with the<br>
use of such a water based pigment ink is extremely poor. Then,<br>
aiming to improve the image quality, a technique is proposed in<br>
which film-formable fine resin particles are added in an ink<br>
liquid. However, it is difficult to finely and stably disperse a<br>
plurality of components in a liquid for a long period of time.<br>
When a large amount of a dispersant such as surfactant is used<br>
for stably dispersing these fine particles, air bubbles occur in an<br>
ink tank and an ink head, or image quality is degraded. For<br>
improving dispersibility of these components, considered are a<br>
method of changing the surfaces of a pigment to be hydrophilic,<br>
and a method of using a resin containing a hydrophilic group(s),<br>
and the like. However, these methods have a problem that<br>
when these methods are applied in combination, the dispersion<br>
becomes unstable and the storage stability is degraded, although<br>
when these methods are applied separately, each resultant<br>
dispersion is stable.<br>
To solve the above described problems, proposed are a<br>
method of incorporating in an ink a water-insoluble coloring<br>
material for obtaining high image density and chargable resin<br>
pseudo fine particles having a size smaller than the coloring<br>
material (see Patent Literature 1); a method of incorporating in<br>
an ink a self-dispersible pigment in a limited absorption amount<br>
of DBP oil (see Patent Literature 2); and a method of using a<br>
water-based carbon black dispersion liquid with an HLB value of<br>
7 to 18, in which a surface-modified carbon black and a nonionic<br>
surfactant having an acetylene skeleton are contained (see<br>
Patent Literature 3).<br>
In addition, for the purpose of stabilizing the dispersion<br>
of these components in a water-based ink liquid, proposed are a<br>
method of dispersing in a water a water-dispersible resin having<br>
a carboxyl group and a nonionic hydrophilic group within a<br>
molecule (see Patent Literature 4), a method of conforming the<br>
polarity of a water-soluble polymer to that of a surfactant or<br>
adding a nonionic surfactant in a water-based liquid (see Patent<br>
Literature 5), a method of conforming the polarity of a colored<br>
ionic polyester resin to that of a hydrophilic group of a colorant<br>
in an aqueous recording liquid (see Patent Literature 6), and a<br>
method of conforming the dispersion polarity of a pigment to<br>
that of a resin fine particle (see Patent Literature 7).<br>
Further, a water-based inkjet ink composition is proposed,<br>
which contains a pigment dispersion liquid containing pigment<br>
particles in which at least 70% of the particles in the dispersion<br>
liquid have diameters less than 0.1 µm and the other particles<br>
in the dispersion liquid have a particle size distribution with a<br>
diameter of 0.1 µm or less, an aldehyde naphthalenesulfonate<br>
dispersant, and/or at least one sulfone solvent (see Patent<br>
Literature 8). Patent Literature 9 proposes a recording liquid<br>
composed of a water-based medium which contains a pigment, a<br>
polymer dispersant and a nonionic surfactant. Furthermore,<br>
Patent Literature 10 proposes use of an AB block copolymer or a<br>
BAB block copolymer as a dispersant for pigments. Moreover,<br>
Patent Literature 11 proposes use of a specific pigment,<br>
water-soluble resin and solvent.<br>
Meanwhile, as a method of dispersing a pigment without<br>
using a dispersant, proposed are, for example, a method of<br>
introducing substituents containing a solubilizing group(s) for<br>
water into a carbon black (see Patent Literature 12), a method<br>
of polymerizing a water-soluble monomer etc. to the surface of a<br>
carbon black (see Patent Literature 13), and a method of<br>
subjecting a carbon black to an oxidative treatment (see Patent<br>
Literature 14). A method is also proposed which ensures water<br>
resistance and ejection stability of an ink through the use of an<br>
ink containing a carbon black that has been subjected to an<br>
oxidative treatment, and a ternary copolymer composed of<br>
acrylic acid, styrene and crmethyl styrene (see Patent<br>
Literature 15).<br>
Further, an inkjet recording liquid is proposed in which<br>
the volume average particle diameter of dispersion particles is<br>
30 nm to 200 nm (see Patent Literature 16).<br>
As for the above-mentioned inkjet recording liquids, color<br>
pigment inks actually allow for obtaining high image densities,<br>
however, black pigment inks have not yet been able to provide<br>
enough performance to satisfy users. In addition, a technique<br>
is proposed in which a bead of a bead size of about 0.05 mm to<br>
1.0 mm is used in bead mill dispersion (see Patent Literature<br>
17). However, this proposal has not been able to provide<br>
sufficient dispersion stability.<br>
Further in Patent Literature 18, as a dispersant used is<br>
an anionic surfactant, which preferably has a molecular weight<br>
in the range of 1,000 to 30,000. However, this proposal does<br>
not provide sufficient dispersion stability, involves a type of<br>
pigment which is weak in resistance to impact caused by<br>
dispersion treatment and thus lacks stability after dispersion<br>
treatment, which leads to degradation of ejection stability of an<br>
ink.<br>
Thus at present, an inkjet recording ink capable of<br>
providing high image density and excellent storage stability<br>
thereof and a pigment dispersion liquid therein and preventing<br>
the occurrence of clogging at inkjet heads, and its associated<br>
technology have not been provided yet.<br>

Brief Description of Drawings<br>
FIG.1 is a perspective view showing one example of an<br>
inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention.<br>
Best Mode For Carrying Out the Invention<br>
(Inkjet recording ink)<br>
An inkjet recording ink according to the present invention<br>
contains a pigment dispersion liquid A which contains at least a<br>
carbon black, a dispersant, and water, and a self'dispersible<br>
pigment dispersion liquid B which contains a carbon black<br>
having a functional group on a surface, as well as a wetting<br>
agent, a penetrating agent, a surfactant and additional<br>
components as required.<br>
In the inkjet recording ink, a mass ratio (Ac - Bc) of the<br>
amount of a carbon black in the pigment dispersion liquid A (Ac)<br>
to the amount of a carbon black having a functional group on a<br>
surface in the self'dispersible pigment dispersion liquid B (Bc)<br>
is 98 : 2 to 50 : 50, preferably is 95 : 5 to 60 : 40, and more<br>
preferably 85 : 15 to 65 : 35.<br>
When the amount of the pigment dispersion liquid A in<br>
the ink is more than 98% by mass, the image density on regular<br>
paper decreases. When the amount is less than 50% by mass,<br>
the image density may sometimes decrease on a support with<br>
less ink penetration (processed paper) such as of high gloss<br>
paper, etc.<br>
The amount of the carbon blacks in the pigment<br>
dispersion liquid A and the self-dispersible pigment dispersion<br>
liquid B can be calculated based on information of the blending<br>
formulation, or alternatively can be determined by using, for<br>
example, an infrared absorption spectrometry.<br><pigment dispersion liquid a><br>
The pigment dispersion liquid A contains at least a<br>
carbon black, a dispersant, and water, as well as further other<br>
components as required.<br>
Examples of the carbon black include those manufactured<br>
by gas black method, furnace method, and channel method.<br>
Among these carbon blacks, the carbon black manufactured by<br>
gas black method is particularly preferred.<br>
For the carbon black, commercially available products can<br>
be used: the examples of the commercially available product for<br>
the carbon black include #45L, MCF88, #990, MA600, and #850<br>
(manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation); NIPEX90,<br>
NIPEX150, NIPEX160, NIPEX170, NIPEX180, COLOR BLACK<br>
FW200, PRINTEX25, and SPECIAL BLACK250 (manufactured<br>
by Degussa Japan Co., Ltd.); and REGAL400R, REGAL600R,<br>
and MOGUL L (manufactured by Cabot Corporation).<br>
The carbon black preferably has an average primary<br>
particle diameter of 10.0 nm to 30.0 nm and a BET specific<br>
surface area of 100 m2/g to 400 m2/g, and more preferably has an<br>
average primary particle diameter of 15.0 nm to 20.0 nm and a<br>
BET specific surface area of 150 m2/g to 300 m2/g.<br>
The average primary particle diameter of the carbon<br>
black can be measured by photographing particles using, for<br>
example, an electron microscope and calculating, based on the<br>
particle diameter and particle number in photographed images.<br>
The BET specific surface area of the carbon black can be<br>
measured by a BET method using nitrogen adsorption.<br>
The carbon black used in the pigment dispersion liquid A<br>
has a small average primary particle diameter, is<br>
highly-structured, and is weak in resistance, to impact caused<br>
during a dispersing process such that when a bead having a size<br>
of more than 0.05 mm is used, the structure of the carbon black<br>
is broken by strong collision energy among bead particles,<br>
resulting in that the stability of the carbon black dispersion<br>
liquid thus obtained is impaired. Therefore, the diameter of<br>
the bead is preferably 0.05 mm or less.<br>
- Dispersant -<br>
The dispersant is not particularly limited and can be<br>
appropriately selected depending on the purpose; a sodium<br>
naphthalene sulfonate formalin condensate is preferably used<br>
for the dispersant.<br>
The sodium naphthalene sulfonate formalin condensate is<br>
a condensate of sodium naphthalene sulfonate and formaldehyde<br>
and is not particularly limited as long as it is a compound<br>
composed of a repetition of the above condensate.<br>
The total amount of a dimer, a trimer, and a tetramer of<br>
naphthalenesulfonic acid in the sodium sulfonate formalin<br>
condensate against the total amount of the sodium naphthalene<br>
sulfonate formalin condensates is preferably 20% by mass to<br>
80% by mass, and more preferably 35% by mass to 65% by mass.<br>
When the total amount is less than 20% by mass, the<br>
dispersibility of the sodium naphthalene sulfonate formalin<br>
condensate and the storage stability of the pigment dispersion<br>
liquid and the ink are degraded, sometimes resulting in easy<br>
occurrence of nozzle clogging. When the total amount is more<br>
than 80% by mass, the viscosity of the pigment dispersion liquid<br>
A increases, sometimes resulting in difficult dispersion.<br>
The amount of the dispersant added per 1 part by mass of<br>
the carbon black is preferably 0.1 parts by mass to 2 parts by<br>
mass, and more preferably 0.25 parts by mass to 1 part by mass.<br>
By adding the dispersant at such mixture ratio, an ink<br>
exhibiting high image density, excellent ejection stability, and<br>
excellent liquid stability can be provided.<br>
When the amount added is less than 0.1 parts by mass,<br>
storage stability of the water-based pigment dispersion liquid<br>
and the ink is degraded, while the effects of the present<br>
invention become difficult to achieve, resulting in that nozzle<br>
clogging tends to occur easily. When the amount added is more<br>
than 2 parts by mass, it tends to be difficult to perform<br>
recording by an inkjet method because of the high viscosity of<br>
the water-based pigment dispersion liquid and the ink.<br>
In addition to the carbon black, the dispersant, and water,<br>
further various additives such as water soluble organic solvent,<br>
nonionic surfactant, anionic surfactant, cationic surfactant,<br>
ampholytic surfactant, and antiseptic agent can be added as<br>
required to the pigment dispersion liquid.<br>
The water soluble organic solvent is not particularly<br>
limited and can be appropriately selected depending on the<br>
purpose; examples thereof include alcohols such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, 1-propanol, and 2-propanol; polyvalent alcohols such as<br>
ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, propylene<br>
glycol, and glycerine; pyrrolidone derivatives such as N-methyl<br>
pyrrolidone and 2-pyrrolidone; ketones such as acetone and<br>
methylethylketone; alkanolamines such as monoethanol amine,<br>
diethanol amine, and triethanol amine; various surfactants such<br>
as a nonionic surfactant, an anionic surfactant, a cationic<br>
surfactant, and an ampholytic surfactant; and antiseptic agents.<br>
In order to obtain the carbon black dispersion liquid, the<br>
carbon black, the dispersant, water, and various additives as<br>
required are firstly dispersed by a bead mill such as<br>
DYNO-MILL TYPE KDL (manufactured by SHINMARU<br>
ENTERPRISES CORPORATION), AGITATOR Mill LMZ<br>
(manufactured by Ashizawa Finetech Ltd.), and SC MILL<br>
(manufactured by Mitsui Mining CO., LTD). After the first<br>
dispersion process using a bead mill, the resultant dispersion is<br>
further dispersed by a beadless mill, for example, a high-speed<br>
shearing force type mill such as CLEARSS5 (manufactured by<br>
Mtechnique K.K.), CAVITRON CD1010 (manufactured by<br>
Eurotec, Ltd.), and MODULE DR2000 (manufactured by<br>
SHINMARU ENTERPRISES CORPORATION); a thin-film spin<br>
system mill such as T.K.FILMICS (manufactured by PRIMIX<br>
Corporation); and a super high-pressure collision type mill such<br>
as ULTIMIZER (manufactured by SUGINO MACHINE<br>
LIMITED) and NANOMIZER (manufactured by YOSHIDA KIKAI<br>
Co., LTD.).<br>
Generally a ceramic bead is preferably employed for the<br>
bead used in the bead mill, and typically zirconia ball is<br>
employed. The bead preferably has a diameter of 0.05 mm or<br>
less, and more preferably a diameter of 0.03 mm or less.<br>
In the process prior to the dispersion treatment using the<br>
dispersing device, pretreatment of coarse particles by a<br>
homogenizer, etc. makes it possible to obtain a sharper particle<br>
size distribution, which leads to improvement of image density<br>
and ejection stability, etc.<br><self-dispersible pigment dispersion liquid b><br>
The carbon black used in the self-dispersible pigment<br>
dispersion liquid B containing a functional group on a surface is<br>
a carbon black which is subjected to such a surface treatment<br>
that at least one selected from carboxyl group, carbonyl group,<br>
hydroxyl group, sulfo group, phosphate group, quaternary<br>
ammonium, and salts thereof is bonded to the surface, thereby<br>
the carbon black is made capable of being dispersed and/or<br>
dissolved in water without an aid of dispersant. Specifically<br>
the carbon black used in the self-dispersible pigment dispersion<br>
liquid B is obtained by physical treatment such as vacuum<br>
plasma treatment; a process of chemically bonding a functional<br>
group such as carboxyl group, hydroxyl group, or sulfo group to<br>
the surface of one carbon black particle using a diazoalkyl<br>
compound (N=N-R-X) according to M.L. StudebakerJ a process of<br>
chemically bonding a phenol compound to the surface of one<br>
particle of a carbon-based material, especially a carbon black by<br>
radical reaction; or a process of grafting a functional group or a<br>
molecule containing a functional group to the surface of a carbon<br>
black particle. Unlike conventional surface oxidation processes,<br>
in the present invention a required functional group can be<br>
chemically bonded, in a necessary amount, to the surfaces of<br>
carbon black particles. In the present invention, a single type<br>
of functional group or multiple types of functional group may be<br>
grafted to one carbon black particle. The types of functional<br>
groups to be grafted and the degree to which functional groups<br>
are grafted may be appropriately determined in view of the<br>
dispersion stability, the color density, and the drying property of<br>
the ink at a surface of an inkjet head.<br>
In the carbon black used in the self-dispersible pigment<br>
dispersion liquid B, the state in which a carbon black is stably<br>
existing throughout water without an aid of a dispersant is,<br>
herein, referred to as "dispersed and/or dissolved". It is often<br>
difficult to differentiate clearly the state of a substance being<br>
dissolved from the state of the substance being dispersed. In<br>
the present invention, such a pigment that is capable of stably<br>
existing throughout water without an aid of a dispersant can be<br>
used, irrespective of being dispersed or dissolved. Therefore,<br>
herein, a pigment capable of stably existing throughout water<br>
without an aid of a dispersant is sometimes called a<br>
water-soluble pigment, however, the term "water-soluble<br>
pigment" does not exclude a pigment being dispersed in water.<br>
The carbon black used in the self-dispersible pigment<br>
dispersion liquid B is not particularly limited and can be<br>
appropriately selected depending on the purpose,' examples<br>
thereof include carbon blacks manufactured by known methods<br>
such as a contact method, a furnace method, and a thermal<br>
method.<br>
The type of the carbon black is not particularly limited<br>
and can be appropriately selected depending on the purpose;<br>
examples thereof include an acid carbon black, a neutral carbon<br>
black, and an alkaline carbon black.<br>
Examples of the carbon black used in the self-dispersible<br>
pigment dispersion liquid B include a furnace black, a lamp<br>
black, an acetylene black, and a channel black.<br>
For the carbon black, carbon blacks appropriately<br>
synthesized or commercially available carbon blacks may be<br>
used. Examples of the commercially available product include<br>

The total amount of carbon blacks in the pigment<br>
dispersion liquid A and the self-dispersible pigment dispersion<br>
liquid B is preferably 5% by mass to 50% by mass, and more<br>
preferably 10% by mass to 40% by mass. When the total<br>
amount of the carbon blacks is less than 5% by mass, the<br>
productivity may sometimes be degraded. When the total<br>
amount of the carbon blacks is more than 50% by mass, the<br>
viscosity of the pigment dispersion liquid becomes so high that it<br>
becomes difficult to disperse the carbon blacks.<br>
In an ink the carbon black preferably has a volume<br>
average particle diameter (D50) of 70 nm to 180 nm measured<br>
according to a dynamic light scattering method, and the<br>
standard deviation of the particle diameters of the carbon black<br>
in a particle size distribution is preferably half the volume<br>
average particle diameter D50 or less. Setting the volume<br>
average particle diameter and the standard deviation of the<br>
particle diameter of the carbon black in these ranges results in<br>
production of an ink which provides high image density and<br>
excellent ejection stability and storage stability.<br>
Here, the volume average particle diameter of the carbon<br>
black is determined, for example, using a particle size<br>
distribution measuring device (UPA, manufactured by NIKKISO<br>
CO., LTD.) under the condition of 23°C and 55% RH. The<br>
average particle diameter (D50) of the carbon black means a<br>
particle diameter based on a volume distribution.<br>
The amount of the carbon black in the ink is preferably<br>
1% by mass to 20% by mass, and more preferably 3% by mass to<br>
15% by mass. When the amount of the carbon black is less than<br>
1% by mass, sharpness of a printed image is sometimes degraded<br>
because of low image density. When the amount of the carbon<br>
black is more than 20% by mass, not only the viscosity of the ink<br>
tends to be high, but also a nozzle sometimes becomes easy to<br>
clog.<br>
- Wetting agent -<br>
The boiling point of the wetting agent is preferably 180°C<br>
or more. When such a wetting agent is contained in the<br>
water-based pigment ink, water-retention and wettability of the<br>
ink composition can be ensured. Consequently, it is possible to<br>
obtain a water-based pigment inkjet ink that will not cause<br>
aggregation of coloring materials and increases in viscosity even<br>
when it is stored over a long period of time and to achieve<br>
excellent storage stability. Furthermore use of this<br>
water-based pigment ink can provide an inkjet ink capable of<br>
keeping, over a long period of time, the flowability of dry<br>
substances of the inkjet ink which are produced by leaving a<br>
small portion of the inkjet ink in an open space such as at a<br>
nozzle point of an inkjet printer. Moreover, it is possible to<br>
obtain high ejection stability without substantially causing<br>
nozzle clogging during recording or during rebooting process of<br>
the printer after recording discontinuation.<br>
The wetting agent is not particularly limited and can be<br>
appropriately selected depending on the purpose; examples<br>
thereof include polyvalent alcohols such as ethylene glycol,<br>
diethylene glycol, 1-3-butyl glycol, triethylene glycol,<br>
polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, 1, 5-pentanediol,<br>
1,6-hexanediol, glycerin, 1, 2, 6-hexanetriol, 2ethyl-1,<br>
3-hexanediol, ethyl-1, 2, 4-butanetriol, 1, 2, 3-butanetriol, and<br>
petriol; polyvalent alcohol alkyl ethers such as<br>
ethyleneglycolmonoethylether, ethyleneglycolmonobutylether,<br>
diethyleneglycolmonomethylether,<br>
diethyleneglycolmonoethylether,<br>
diethyleneglycolmonobuthylether,<br>
tetraethyleneglycolmonomethylether, and<br>
propyleneglycolmonoethylether; polyvalent alcohol aryl ethers<br>
such as ethyleneglycolmonophenylether, and<br>
ethyleneglycolmonobenzilether; nitrogen-containing heterocyclic<br>
compounds such as 2-pyrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrolidone,<br>
N-hydroxyethyl-2-pyrolidone, 1,3-dimethylimidazolidinone,<br>
e-caprolactam, and ?-butyrolactone; amides such as formamide,<br>
N-methylformamide, and N, N-dimethylformamide; amines such<br>
as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine,<br>
monoethylamine, diethylamine, and triethylamine;<br>
sulfur-containing compounds such as dimethysulfoxide,<br>
sulfolane, and thio-diethanol; propylene carbonate, and ethylene<br>
carbonate. These wetting agents may be used alone or in<br>
combination of two or more. Of these wetting agents, 1,<br>
3-butylglycol, diethyleneglycol, triethyleneglycol, and glycerin<br>
are particularly preferred in terms of preventing clogging due to<br>
ink drying (i.e. defects in injection property due to water<br>
evaporation) and providing excellent effects in improving color<br>
saturation of images.<br>
A ratio of the amount of the wetting agent against the<br>
total amount of the ink is preferably 50% by mass or less, and<br>
more preferably 5% by mass to 40% by mass.<br>
- Penetrating agent -<br>
The penetrating agent is not particularly limited and can<br>
be appropriately selected depending on the purpose! examples<br>
thereof include nonionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene<br>
alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl phenyl ethers,<br>
polyoxyethylene glycol esters, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene<br>
decyl ethers, acetylene surfactants, silicone surfactants, and<br>
fluorine surfactants.<br>
- Surfactant -<br>
In an ink according to the present invention, a surfactant<br>
may be added at such an amount that it does not affect its ink<br>
properties. Examples of the surfactant include nonionic<br>
surfactants, anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, and<br>
ampholytic surfactants. Specific examples of nonionic<br>
surfactants include those of BT Series (manufactured by Nikko<br>
Chemicals Co., Ltd.); those of NONIPOL Series (manufactured<br>
by Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd.)." those of D-Series and<br>
O-Series (manufactured by Takemoto Oil &amp; Fat Co., Ltd.); those<br>
of SURFINOL Series (manufactured by Air Products &amp;<br>
Chemicals Inc.); those of OLFIN Series (manufactured by<br>
Nisshin Chemicals. Co., Ltd.); those of EMALEX DAPE Series<br>

surfactants (manufactured by DOW CORNING TORAY<br>
SILICONE CO., LTD.); and fluorine surfactants (manufactured<br>
by Neos Co., Sumitomo 3M Ltd., Du Pont Kabushiki Kaisha, and<br>

Examples of the additional components include defoaming<br>
agent, antiseptic antifungal agent, anticorrosive, pH adjuster,<br>
specific resistance modifier, antioxidant, ultraviolet absorbing<br>
agent, oxygen absorbent, photostabilizing agent, and viscosity<br>
modifier.<br>
A method for producing the inkjet recording ink according<br>
to the present invention is not particularly limited and can be a<br>
known method such as a method of stirring and mixing the<br>
pigment dispersion liquids, water, a wetting agent, a<br>
penetrating agent, a surfactant, etc., removing coarse particles<br>
and foreign matter (i.e. dust and dirt), etc. from the resulting<br>
mixture by vacuum filtration using a metal filter or a membrane<br>
filter, pressure filtration, or centrifugal filtration by a<br>
centrifuge, and then deaerating the resulting filtrate as<br>
required.<br>
The inkjet recording ink according to the present<br>
invention can be preferably used in an ink cartridge for housing<br>
the ink as described below. In addition, the inkjet recording<br>
ink according to the present invention can be used for image<br>
formation by applying the inkjet recording ink to an inkjet<br>
recording apparatus which ejects the inkjet recording ink onto a<br>
recording medium such as paper, as described below.<br>
(Ink cartridge)<br>
An ink cartridge according to the present invention<br>
includes a container to house the inkjet recording ink of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The container is not particularly limited and the shape,<br>
the structure, the size, the material, or the like of the container<br>
can be appropriately selected depending on the purpose;<br>
preferred examples of the container include containers having at<br>
least an ink bag which is formed with aluminum laminate film,<br>
resin film, or the like, and a plastic case.<br>
The ink cartridge of the present invention houses the<br>
inkjet recording ink of the present invention and can be<br>
detachably mounted on various inkjet recording apparatuses.<br>
Further, it is particularly preferable that the inkjet cartridge be<br>
detachably mounted to an inkjet recording apparatus of the<br>
present invention described below.<br>
(Inkjet recording apparatus and inkjet recording method)<br>
The inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention is<br>
composed of at least an ink jetting unit configured to jet the<br>
inkjet recording ink according to the present invention by<br>
applying a stimulus to the inkjet recording ink to form an image,<br>
and is further composed of additional units as required.<br>
An inkjet recording method of the present invention<br>
includes at least an ink jetting step in which the inkjet<br>
recording ink according to the present invention is jetted by<br>
applying a stimulus to the inkjet recording ink to form an image,<br>
and further includes additional steps as required.<br>
Examples of the ink jetting unit include continuous<br>
injection type ink jetting units and on-demand type ink jetting<br>
units. Examples of the on-demand type ink jetting unit include<br>
ink jetting units using piezoinkjet method, thermal-inkjet<br>
method, and electrostaticinkjet method. Among these ink<br>
jetting units, those using a piezo-inkjet method and a<br>
thermal-inkjet method are particularly preferred.<br>
The piezo-inkjet method is a method in which a<br>
diaphragm forming a wall surface of an ink flow passage is<br>
deformed by means of a piezoelectric element as a pressure<br>
generating unit configured to pressurize an ink flowing in the<br>
ink flow passage and change the ink volume in the ink flow<br>
passage, thereby ink droplets can be jetted (see Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No.02-51734).<br>
The thermal-inkjet method is a method in which an ink is<br>
heated in an ink flow passage using a heat element or a resistive<br>
element to generate air bubbles therein, thereby ink droplets<br>
can be jetted (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A)<br>
No. 61-59911).<br>
The electrostatic-inkjet method is a method in which a<br>
diaphragm forming a wall surface of an ink flow passage is<br>
deformed by applying a static electricity generated in between<br>
the diaphragm and electrodes, where the diaphragm is disposed<br>
to face the electrodes, to change the ink volume in the ink flow<br>
passage, thereby ink droplets can be jetted (see Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid Open (JP-A) No. 06-71882).<br>
The stimulus can be generated, for example, by means of<br>
a stimulus generating unit. The stimulus is not particularly<br>
limited, may be appropriately selected depending on the purpose,<br>
and examples thereof include heat (temperature), pressure,<br>
vibration, and light. These stimuli may be used alone or in<br>
combination of two or more. Among these, heat and pressure<br>
are preferably used.<br>
Examples of the stimulus generating unit include heaters,<br>
pressurizing devices, piezoelectric elements, vibration<br>
generators, ultra-sonic oscillators, and light. Specific examples<br>
of the stimulus generating unit include piezoelectric actuators<br>
such as piezoelectric elements; thermal actuators utilizing phase<br>
changes attributable to film boiling of a liquid by using an<br>
electric heat exchanger element such as exothermic resistor,'<br>
shape-memorizing alloy actuators using metal phase changes<br>
attributable to -temperature change; and electrostatic actuators<br>
using electrostatic force.<br>
The aspect of the jetting of the inkjet recording ink is not<br>
particularly limited and differs depending on the type of the<br>
stimulus. For example, when the stimulus is heat, there is a<br>
method in which a heat energy in accordance with a recording<br>
signal is given to the inkjet recording ink in a recording head by<br>
using, for example, a thermal head to generate air bubbles in<br>
the inkjet recording ink by means of the effect of the heat<br>
energy and to thereby jet and spray the inkjet recording ink as<br>
droplets from a nozzle hole of the recording head by means of<br>
the effect of the pressure of the air bubbles. When the stimulus<br>
is pressure, for example, there is a method in which a voltage is<br>
applied to a piezoelectric element, which is bonded to the<br>
position called as a pressure chamber placed in an ink flow<br>
passage within a recording head, to make the piezoelectric<br>
element bend to shrink the inner volume of the pressure<br>
chamber and to thereby eject and spray the inkjet recording ink<br>
as droplets from a nozzle hole of the recording head.<br>
An ink recorded matter is obtained on demand on a<br>
recording medium by recording an image on the recording<br>
medium using the inkjet recording apparatus of the present<br>
invention which houses the inkjet recording ink of the present<br>
invention. The inkjet recording ink can be replaced on an ink<br>
cartridge basis.<br>
Hereinafter, the ink cartridge and the inkjet recording<br>
apparatus of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 1.<br>
In FIG. 1, an ink cartridge 20 for housing the inkjet<br>
recording ink of the present invention is housed in a carriage 18.<br>
In FIG. 1, a plurality of the ink cartridges 20 are disposed for<br>
the sake of convenience, however, the plurality of the ink<br>
cartridges 20 are not necessarily required. In this state, the<br>
inkjet ink is supplied from the ink cartridge 20 to an ink<br>
droplet-jetting head 18a which is mounted on the carriage 18.<br>
The inkjet ink is ejected from an ink-jetting nozzle 18a,<br>
although the ink-jetting nozzle surface is not shown in FIG. 1<br>
because it faces downward.<br>
The ink droplet-jetting head 18a mounted on the carriage<br>
18 moves by motion of a timing belt 23 that is driven by a<br>
primary scanning motor 24 in a state where the ink<br>
droplet-jetting head 18a is guided by guide shafts 21 and 22.<br>
Meanwhile, a platen 19 places a specific coat paper (image<br>
support) at a position where the specific coat paper faces to the<br>
ink droplet-jetting head 18a. In FIG. 1, an inkjet recording<br>
apparatus 1 is equipped with a main housing 2, a gear system 16,<br>
a sub-scanning motor 17, gear systems 25 and 27, and another<br>
primary scanning motor 26.<br>
(Ink recorded matter)<br>
An ink recorded matter of the present invention is<br>
composed of at least an image formed on a recording medium<br>
with the use of the inkjet recording ink according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
The recording medium is not particularly limited and can<br>
be appropriately selected depending on the purpose; preferred<br>
examples thereof include a recording medium having ink<br>
absorbency such as paper, and a recording medium substantially<br>
lacking ink absorbency.<br>
Examples of the recording medium include plastic sheets<br>
based on a material such as polyethylene terephthalate,<br>
polycarbonate, polypropylene, polyethylene, polysulfone, ABS<br>
resins, or polyvinyl chloride," recording media manufactured by<br>
coating with a metal a surface of a metal such as brass, iron,<br>
aluminum, SUS, or copper, or by coating with a metal a<br>
nonmetal base material, using a technique such as vapor<br>
deposition; recording media manufactured by subjecting paper<br>
as a base material to water-shedding treatment; and recording<br>
media composed of a so-called ceramic material manufactured by<br>
firing an inorganic material at a high temperature. Among<br>
these, paper is particularly preferred in terms of economic<br>
efficiency and naturalness of images produced thereon.<br>

- Production of inkjet recording ink -<br>
Inkjet recording inks of Examples 1 to 19 and<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 7 were each prepared by mixing a<br>
pigment dispersion liquid A thus obtained and one of the<br>
following two types of self-dispersible pigment dispersion liquid<br>
B in accordance with the following ink formulation and Table 1,<br>
stirring the mixture for 30 min, filtering the mixture through a<br>
membrane filter having a pore size of 0.8 urn, and finally<br>
subjecting the filtrate to vacuum deaeration.<br>
- Self-dispersible pigment dispersion liquid B -<br>
• B1 liquid: a liquid prepared by dispersing a<br>
carboxyl-group-containing carbon black (CAB-O-JET300,<br>
manufactured by Cabot Corporation) in water (concentration of<br>
the carbon black: 20% by mass).<br>
• B-2 liquid- a liquid prepared by dispersing a<br>
sulfo-group-containing carbon black (CAB-O-JET200,<br>
manufactured by Cabot Corporation) in water (concentration of<br>
the carbon black- 20% by mass).<br>

ink&gt;<br>
The volume average particle diameter (D50) and a<br>
standard deviation of an ink were measured using a particle size<br>
distribution measuring device (UPA 150EX, manufactured by<br>
NIKKISO CO., LTD.).<br>
Next, an image was recorded on regular paper (PPC Paper<br>
4024, manufactured by Fuji Xerox Office Supply Co., Ltd.) and<br>
gloss paper (RICOH BUSINESS COAT GLOSS paper,<br>
manufactured by Ricoh Company, Ltd.) with each of the inkjet<br>
recording inks of Examples 1 to 19 and Comparative Examples 1<br>
to 7, using an inkjet printer (MJ-930C, manufactured by SEIKO<br>
EPSON Corp.) to evaluate the inkjet recording inks as to their<br>
image density, ejection stability, and storage stability of ink as<br>
follows. The results are shown in Table 2.<br><image density><br>
The image density of each of the inkjet recording inks on<br>
regular paper and gloss paper was determined by measuring the<br>
solid image obtained using X-RITE densitometer (manufactured<br>
by X-Rite Inc.).<br><ejection stability><br>
For evaluating the ejection stability, after ink recorded<br>
matters were prepared by an inkjet printer using each of the<br>
inkjet recording inks, the inkjet printer was left intact with the<br>
inkjet head capped, at a temperature of 40°C for 1 month. Then,<br>
whether or not the ink-ejection condition of the inkjet printer<br>
could be recovered to the initial ink-ejection condition level was<br>
evaluated, based on the number of cleaning operations,<br>
according to the following criteria.<br>
[Evaluation criteria]<br>
A: recovered to the initial level with one cleaning<br>
operation<br>
B: recovered to the initial level with two or three<br>
cleaning operations<br>
C: could not be recovered to the initial level even with<br>
three or more cleaning operations<br><storage stability of ink><br>
Each of the inkjet recording inks was placed and sealed in<br>
a polyethylene container and stored at 70°C for three weeks.<br>
Then, the particle diameter, the surface tension, and the<br>
viscosity of each of the inkjet recording inks were measured.<br>
Each of the inkjet recording inks was evaluated by the change<br>
rates in the physical properties from the initial levels according<br>
to the following evaluation criteria.<br>
[Evaluation criteria]<br>
A: The highest change rate in all the evaluation items of<br>
particle diameter, surface tension and viscosity was less than<br>
5%.<br>
B: The highest change rate in all the evaluation items of<br>
particle diameter, surface tension and viscosity was less than<br>
10%.<br>
C: The highest change rate in all the evaluation items of<br>
particle diameter, surface tension and viscosity was less than<br>
30%.<br>
D: At least one evaluation item of particle diameter,<br>
surface tension and viscosity had a change rate of 30% or more.<br>
Table 1.<br>
The results shown in Tables 1 and 2 demonstrated that<br>
each of inkjet recording inks of Examples 1 to 19 had a higher<br>
image density and was more excellent in ejection stability and<br>
ink storage stability than any of the inkjet recording inks of<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 7.<br>
