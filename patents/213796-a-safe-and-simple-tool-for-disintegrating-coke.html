				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a tool for disintegrating coke.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In oil refineries, the last, otherwise unusable fraction of the crude oil is<br>
transformed into coke. This transformation is performed by feeding this fraction<br>
into drums which are filled with coke as the operation proceeds. Once the<br>
maximum filling level of the drums has been reached, the coke is cut out from<br>
the drums.<br>
This so-called "de-coking" is usually carried out using high-pressure water jets<br>
which disintegrate the coke and wash it out of the drums. The tool for<br>
generating these high-pressure water jets is inserted into the drums from the top<br>
using a drilling rig. The de-coking is carried out in two stages. First, an opening<br>
in the drum is cut from the top to the bottom, then the tool is raised back to the<br>
top of the drum, and the coke is then disintegrated by the high-pressure water<br>
jets generated by cutting nozzles at about right angles to the axis of the bore.<br>
The tool is adapted to assume two operating states, one for drilling an opening<br>
needed for moving the tool and then letting the disintegrated coke exit, and one<br>
for cutting the coke across the cross-section of the drum. The drilling nozzles<br>
accordingly send high-pressure water jets essentially parallel, or at an oblique<br>
angle, to an axis formed by the drill stem and the opening arising from the<br>
drilling. The cutting nozzles, on the other hand, generate high-pressure water<br>
jets aligned essentially at right or obtuse angles to the axis formed by the drill<br>
stem and the opening in the drum.<br>
The switch-over between the operating states of drilling and cutting has to be<br>
quick and simple. The nozzles used in the tool are subject to wear and tear due<br>
to the high water pressure and thus have to be replaced frequently. Therefore,<br>
the tool must be adapted in such a way that the replacement of the nozzles can<br>
be carried out in a quick and safe manner.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a tool for disintegrating coke<br>
which is particularly simple and safe to use and maintain.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The above object is achieved by a tool having the features of the invention.<br>
Tools for disintegrating coke with a housing, which is attached to a drill stem in<br>
operation and having at least one nozzle for cutting and drilling coke and at least<br>
one valve for closing and opening the nozzles arranged on it, are known from the<br>
state of the art. These tools are adapted to have two different operating states.<br>
The at least one valve closes off the cutting nozzles in the "drilling" operating<br>
state, while in the "cutting" operating state, the drilling nozzles are closed off by<br>
the at least one valve. The housing, the valve and the nozzles in these tools are<br>
formed in such a way that unhindered passage of water from the drill stem<br>
through the housing and the valve and through the nozzles not closed off by the<br>
valve is ensured.<br>
The design of such a tool is greatly simplified when the nozzles to be closed off,<br>
depending on each chosen operating state, are closed off by a ball valve.<br>
Combinations comprising a ball valve for opening and closing drilling nozzles and<br>
other means for opening and closing cutting nozzles are well known, but they<br>
need a multitude of parts and result in a tool with a complex structure.<br>
The present invention is advantageous in that the number of parts is reduced<br>
and that it is completely ensured that there is only ever one nozzle or group of<br>
nozzles that is closed off and the other nozzle or group of nozzles is open.<br>
The tool comprises a valve which has a valve carrier in engagement with the<br>
balls for closing off the nozzles. The valve further includes associated means for<br>
guiding the ball and positioning aids, as necessary, by means of which the balls<br>
are held in predetermined positions. An apparatus for operating the valve is also<br>
associated with the valve. The valve is arranged in the housing of the tool and<br>
when operated is flown through or around by the water used to remove the<br>
coke.<br>
The balls of the ball valve are guided in the valve carrier by suitable means for<br>
guiding balls. One possibility would be to provide means for guiding at the valve<br>
carrier. These could be, for example, concave shells or guiding grooves or<br>
guiding protrusions in engagement with the balls. Alternatively, an arrangement<br>
is possible where the balls associated with the valve carrier are positioned by<br>
springs in the positions suitable for each operating state. The means for guiding<br>
could therefore either be formed integral with the valve carrier or formed<br>
independent of it. The latter embodiment then cooperates with the ball and the<br>
valve carrier for guiding the ball. The means for guiding may also be comprised<br>
of a plurality of parts, for example a recess or groove in the valve carrier<br>
cooperating with a spring arrangement in order to guide the balls.<br>
The balls may be completely spherical. It is, of course, entirely possible for the<br>
balls to be spherical only in segments where in an operating state they close off<br>
the entry to a nozzle. The spherical form of this surface area ensures that the<br>
entry to each nozzle to be closed off is securely sealed against the passage of<br>
liquid. A circular disk, one side of which is spherically domed would, for example,<br>
be quite sufficient for the purpose of closing the nozzle. This is why bodies that<br>
are not entirely spherical in shape will also be referred to as "balls" in the sense<br>
of the invention.<br>
Preferably the balls are symmetrical bodies having at least two spherical surface<br>
sections. Usually, these spherical surface sections are opposite to each other,<br>
e.g. as calottes, whose maximum circumference are adjacent to each other.<br>
These symmetrical balls have the advantage that on the one hand, because of<br>
the symmetry, they are easily guided by the means for guiding. On the other<br>
hand, they are advantageous in that, should the first spherical surface section<br>
show signs of being worn out, the symmetrical ball could simply be flipped over.<br>
Thus, a different calotte with a second spherical surface section could be used<br>
for sealing off the nozzle. The symmetrical ball is usually preferred over the<br>
completely spherical ball since, if tools are to be designed with a reduced<br>
diameter, the symmetrical balls have a smaller thickness, with reference to the<br>
diameter of the tool, than completely spherical balls.<br><br>
According to a first embodiment, the valve carrier is integrated in the housing in<br>
such a way that it is a part of the exterior wall of the tool. According to a second<br>
embodiment, the valve carrier is mounted within the housing. The means for<br>
guiding the ball and the valve carrier, if necessary, are arranged in the housing<br>
of the tool, although they usually do not quite fill it. There are thus gaps<br>
between the means for guiding the balls and the valve carrier and the housing.<br>
According to an advantageous further development of the invention, these gaps<br>
are in communication with the interior cavity of the tool so that in operation the<br>
liquid flowing through the tool can also flow through these gaps. The advantage<br>
of this arrangement is that there are no pressure differentials within the tool<br>
between the housing and the valve carrier. Material savings may thus be realized<br>
when designing the valve carrier because no pressure differentials, with their<br>
associated pressure and pulling forces, must be absorbed. Additionally, the<br>
avoidance of pressure differentials ensures smooth operation of the ball valves.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment of the tool according to the present<br>
invention, comprises a valve carrier, in which the nozzles for cutting are arranged<br>
in two or more levels one on top of the other. This greatly enhances the power<br>
of the tool. Preferably, the nozzles are offset from each other in the several<br>
levels.<br>
The switch-over from the "drilling" operating state to the "cutting" operating<br>
state is carried out manually in most of the prior art tools. The tool is retracted<br>
from the drum after the first processing step and a device within the tool is<br>
operated, which after completion of the drilling closes off the drilling nozzles to<br>
the bottom and opens the cutting nozzles.<br>
The device for closing individual, or a plurality of, nozzles is operated by means<br>
which on the one hand engage the apparatus for closing and on the other hand<br>
involve an operating member operable from the outside of the tool. This<br>
operating member is always positioned below the tool with prior art de-coking<br>
tools. Arrangements for switching over a de-coking tool according to this design<br>
may be robust and well proven. However, they have a particularly serious<br>
drawback in that the tool must be completely retracted from the drum, and that<br>
for switching over from "drilling" to "cutting", the cutting nozzles must be at the<br>
body height of the operating personnel. In some cases, this can result in<br>
heightened risks for the operating personnel, such as when, as has been known<br>
to happen, the controlling mechanism fails.<br>
The first approach to avoid this drawback has been to develop automatic<br>
arrangements for switching over de-coking tools. This has been problematic,<br>
however, since it is difficult to attach the relatively sensitive control mechanisms<br>
to the tool which is used in a very harsh environment subject to extreme<br>
mechanical and thermal stresses and strains.<br>
The arrangement of the means for operating the apparatus within the de-coking<br>
tool for closing off individual, or a plurality of, nozzles, so that the operating<br>
member is arranged between the nozzles and the top end of the tool, already<br>
ensures that accidents with a manually operable arrangement for switching over<br>
may be avoided. This arrangement is considered independent, novel and<br>
inventive and suggests a simple and safe tool for disintegrating coke.<br>
With the preferred arrangement, the tool can remain within the drum to be<br>
emptied, when the operating state is to be changed from the first to the second,<br>
or vice-versa, to such an extent that the cutting nozzles from which high-<br>
pressure water jets exit remain covered by the drum. Even for the case where<br>
the control devices of the de-coking plant fail, or if it (erroneously) signalled that<br>
the tool can be switched over although high pressure remains applied to it, the<br>
operating personnel may approach the tool without the risk of getting hurt by<br>
high-pressure water jets.<br>
The apparatus for closing individual, or a plurality of, nozzles have different<br>
forms. Some tools are provided with ball valves, other tools have hollow cylinders<br>
provided with cut-outs for opening the nozzles. Depending on the position of the<br>
cylinder, also connected to a bottom plate provided with cut-outs, as necessary,<br>
a high-pressure water jet exits, or the respective nozzle is closed off by the<br>
hollow cylinder or the bottom plate. Herein the hollow cylinder covers the cutting<br>
nozzles or exposes them, while the bottom plate exposes or closes the drilling<br>
nozzles, respectively.<br>
For virtually all of the prior art apparatuses it is possible to provide an<br>
arrangement for switching-over the de-coking tool wherein the operating<br>
member is upstream of the nozzles and therefore at the top end of the de-coking<br>
tool.<br>
It is considered particularly advantageous that existing and, as far as the<br>
apparatus for closing off individual, or a plurality of, nozzles is concerned, well<br>
proven facilities may be equipped with the arrangement according to the<br>
invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows a tool 2 with a housing 4, two nozzles for cutting coke 6 and two<br>
more nozzles (schematically shown) for drilling coke 8 and a valve 10 for opening<br>
and closing nozzles 6, 8.<br>
In operation, tool 2 is attached to drill stem (not shown) and is inserted in a<br>
drum filled with coke. Indications such as "top" and "bottom" refer to axis A of<br>
the tool shown in Figures 1 to 4 aligned with the drill stem (top) and a hole to be<br>
made by the tool (bottom; not shown).<br>
Housing 4 is made if two parts. Valve 10 is arranged between the top housing<br>
half 4a arranged at the drill stem (not shown) and the bottom housing half 4b.<br>
Top housing half 4a is attached to the drill stem via a flange 12 from where it<br>
extends as an essentially hollow body to bottom housing half 4b. At the end of<br>
top housing part 4a associated with valve 10, a circular support 14 is integrally<br>
formed. At this support 14 a valve carrier 16 is disposed on the bottom.<br>
For simple and precise alignment of valve carrier 16 at support 14, corresponding<br>
contacting surfaces 18a and 18b, and 20a and 20b are provided at support 14<br>
and valve carrier 16. In the area of contacting surfaces 20, 20b, a circular sealing<br>
ring 22 is provided.<br>
Valve carrier 16 is bolted to support 14 using bolts engaged threaded bores (not<br>
shown) in support 14 and in valve carrier 16.<br>
Valve carrier 16 is a cylindrical hollow body in which an intermediate web 26 is<br>
formed extending essentially at right angles to axis A. Two balls 28 of ball valve<br>
10 are arranged to run on the web 26. Balls 28 are positioned at the outer<br>
periphery of web 26 or valve carrier 16. In this position they are held both during<br>
the "drilling" and "cutting" operating states, and during a switch-over from one<br>
operating state to the other, by positioned aids. In the present embodiment, the<br>
positioning aid is formed as a spring 30 exerting a force between the two balls<br><br>
The position of balls 28 on the web 26 is determined by the means for guiding<br>
the balls. These means for guiding the balls 28 are concave shells 32 in the<br>
present embodiment, embracing the top half of the balls 28 as well as spring 30.<br>
A guide 34 extents from concave shells 32 upwards.<br>
Web 26 of valve carrier 16 comprises bores 36, as shown in Figure 2, whose<br>
number is equal to the number of balls 8. Valve carrier 16 has bores 40, into<br>
which cutting nozzles 6 are inserted, at its outer wall 38.<br>
Below the web 26 or at its bottom surface, contacting surfaces 42a and 42b, and<br>
44a and 44b are provided. Contacting surfaces 42a, b are parallel to axis A while<br>
contacting surfaces 44a, b are vertical to axis A.<br>
The bottom housing half 4b contacts these contacting surfaces 42a, b and 44a, b<br>
and is attached to the valve carrier by bolts 46 which engage threaded bores<br>
(not shown) of valve carrier 16. In the area of contacting surfaces 44a, b, a<br>
circular sealing ring 48 is provided.<br>
A cavity 50 in the bottom housing half 4b ensures that liquid can pass<br>
unhindered through bores 36 to drilling nozzles 8 positioned in the bottom<br>
housing half 4b. Drilling nozzles 8 are only schematically shown.<br>
The tool 2 shown in Figures 1 and 2 is in the "drilling" operating state (drilling<br>
state). In the drilling state, balls 28 of ball valve 10 block bores 40 in the outer<br>
wall 38 of valve carrier 16. The diameter of balls 28 is such that bores 40 are<br>
reliably and completely covered.<br>
At the same time, as shown in Figure 2, bores 36 in web 26 of valve carrier 16<br>
are left free. Water entering tool 2 at high pressure from the drill stem, flows<br>
through the interior 52 within the tool above web 26,through bores 36, passes<br>
through cavity 50 in the bottom housing half 4b, and the exits through nozzles 8<br>
into a drum filled with coke (not shown).<br>
To switch over from the drilling state into the "cutting" operating state, an<br>
apparatus 54 for operating valve 10 is provided at tool 2. Apparatus 54<br>
comprises a cylindrical hollow body 56 inserted in the top housing half 4a. The<br>
bottom end of this hollow body 56 has recesses 58 in engagement with guides<br>
34 of ball valve 10. The top end 60 of hollow body 56 is formed in the manner of<br>
a gear rim. A gear 62 is in mesh with said top end 60 of hollow body 56 formed<br>
in the manner of a gear rim. An axle 64 is attached to gear 62 extending through<br>
top housing half 4a. Axle 64 is manually adjusted using a wrench.<br>
To switch over from the drilling state to the "cutting" operating state, gear 62 is<br>
operated by turning axle 64. Hollow body 56 in mesh with gear 62 is rotated<br>
within the top housing half 4a by gear 62. Guide 34 and with it balls 28 of ball<br>
valve 10 are rotated together with hollow body 56. By rotating balls 28 on valve<br>
carrier 16, bores 40 that had closed off nozzles 6, are now exposed (cf. Figure<br>
3). By operating handle 64, balls 28 move on a circular path until bores 36 are<br>
completely closed off (cf. Figure 4).<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show a tool 2 in the cutting operating state. Water at high<br>
pressure flows from the drill stem into interior 2 of the top housing half 4a and<br>
exits from the cutting nozzles, the only possible outlets, at about right angles to<br>
axis A. Bores 36 are safely and completely blocked by balls 28 positioned on top<br>
of them. The closing action of balls 28 is additionally secured in this position and,<br>
likewise, when bores 40 are blocked by the fact that the extremely high pressure<br>
of the water, far above 100 bars, presses the balls to the valve carrier.<br>
The exemplary embodiment shown in Figures 1 to 4 concerns an embodiment of<br>
the invention with two nozzles 6 for cutting and two nozzles 8 for drilling.<br>
However, embodiments are also covered by the subject matter of the invention<br>
with three or more nozzles 6 or nozzles 8, respectively. Neither is it necessary for<br>
the numbers of nozzles 6 and of nozzles 8 to be equal. In particular with<br>
embodiments of the invention having three or more nozzles requiring more than<br>
two balls 28, a separate guide for each ball may serve as a positioning aid.<br>
Spring 30 is then no longer needed.<br>
Such an embodiment of tool 2 having a plurality of nozzles in Figure 5<br>
(equivalent features are designated with identical reference numerals). Tool 2<br>
has a housing 4 and a valve 10. Valve carrier 16 is inserted in the housing.<br>
Cutting nozzles 6 as shown in Figure 5 are arranged in two levels, one on top of<br>
the other. Nozzles 6A and 6B are shown to be vertically aligned, whereas in fact<br>
they are offset at an angle of about 60° to each other. This is indicated by cross-<br>
hatching.<br>
Balls 28 opening or closing, depending on the operating state, nozzles 6 and<br>
openings 36 supplying drilling nozzles 8, are received in means for guiding,<br>
which fix balls 28 in predetermined positions and act as a support 33 together<br>
with guiding protrusions 35 integral with it. Support 33 is attached to cylindrical<br>
hollow body 56 as part of apparatus 54 for operating valve 10. Guiding<br>
protrusions 35 effect a secure positioning of balls 28 so that no springs are<br>
needed. Apparatus 54 for operating the valve otherwise corresponds to the<br>
embodiments shown in Figures 1 to 4.<br>
Between housing 4, valve carrier 16 and the means 33 for guiding the balls 28,<br>
there are gaps in flow communication with interior cavity 52. In operation, the<br>
water flowing through tool 2 therefore flows both through interior cavity 52 and<br>
through gaps 66 so that any pressure differentials are avoided.<br>
