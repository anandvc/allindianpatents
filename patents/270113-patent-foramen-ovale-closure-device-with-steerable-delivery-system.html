PATENT FORAMEN OVALE CLOSURE DEVICE WITH STEERABLE<br>
DELIVERY SYSTEM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S.<br>
Provisional Applications, Serial Number 60/637,316,<br>
filed July 7, 2005, which are incorporated by reference<br>
herein.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to delivery system and a<br>
device for closing a passageway in a body, for example a<br>
patent foramen ovale (PFO) in a heart, and related<br>
methods of using such closure devices for closing the<br>
passageway.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is an anatomical<br>
interatrial communication with potential for right-to-<br>
loft shunting of blood. Patent foramen ovale is a flap-<br>
1ike opening between the atrial septa primum and<br>
secundum at the location of the fossa ovalis that<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
persists after age one year. In utero, the foramen<br>
ovale serves as a physiologic conduit for right-to-left<br>
shunting of blood in the fetal heart. After birth, with<br>
the establishment , of pulmonary circulation, the<br>
increased left atrial blood flow and pressure presses<br>
the septum primum (SP) against the walls of the septum<br>
secundum (SS), covering the foramen ovale and resulting<br>
in functional closure of the foramen ovale. This<br>
closure is usually followed by anatomical closure of the<br>
foramen ovale due to fusion of the septum primum (SP) to<br>
the septum secundum (SS).<br>
Where anatomical closure of the foramen ovale does<br>
not occur, a patent foramen ovale (PFO) is created. A<br>
patent foramen ovale is a persistent, usually flap-like<br>
opening between the atrial septum primum (SP) and septum<br>
secundum (SS) of a heart. A patent foramen ovale<br>
results when either partial or no fusion of the septum<br>
primum (SP) to the septum secundum (SS) occurs. In the<br>
case of partial fusion or no fusion, a persistent<br>
passageway (PFO track) exists between the septum primum<br>
(SP) and septum secundum (SS) . This opening or<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
passageway is typically parallel to the plane of the<br>
septum primum, and has a mouth that is generally oval in<br>
shape. Normally the opening is relatively long, but<br>
quite narrow. The opening may be held closed due to the<br>
mean pressure in the left atrium (LA) being typically<br>
higher than in the right atrium (RA) . In this manner,<br>
the septum primum acts like a one-way valve, preventing<br>
fluid communication between the right and left atria<br>
through the PFO track. However, at times, the pressure<br>
may temporarily be higher in the right atrium, causing<br>
the PFO track to open up and allow some fluid to pass<br>
from the right atrium to the left atrium. Although the<br>
PFO track is often held closed, the endothelialized<br>
surfaces of the tissues forming the PFO track prevent<br>
the tissues from healing together and permanently<br>
closing the PFO track.<br>
Studies have shown that a relatively large<br>
percentage of adults have a patent foramen ovale (PFO).<br>
It is believed that embolism via a PFO may be a cause of<br>
a significant number of ischemic strokes, particularly<br>
in relatively young patients. It has been estimated<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
that in 50% of cryptogenic strokes, a PFO is present.<br>
Blood clots that form in the venous circulation (e.g.,<br>
the legs) can embolize, and may enter the arterial<br>
circulation via the PFO, subsequently entering the<br>
cerebral circulation, resulting in an embolic stroke.<br>
Blood clots may also form in the vicinity of the PFO,<br>
and embolize into the arterial circulation and into the<br>
cerebral circulation. Patients suffering a cryptogenic<br>
stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the<br>
presence of a PFO often are considered for medica.1<br>
therapy to reduce the risk of a recurrent embolic event.<br>
Pharmacological therapy often includes oral<br>
anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. These therapies<br>
may lead to certain side effects, including hemorrhage.<br>
If pharmacologic therapy is unsuitable, open heart<br>
surgery may be employed to close a PFO with stitches,<br>
for example. Like other open surgical treatments, this<br>
surgery is highly invasive, risky, requires general<br>
anesthesia, and may result in lengthy recuperation.<br>
Nonsurgical closure of a PFO is possible with<br>
umbrella-like devices developed for percutaneous closure<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
of atrial septal defects (ASD) (a condition where there<br>
is not a well-developed septum primum (SP)). Many of<br>
these conventional devices used for ASD, however, are<br>
technically complex, bulky, and difficult to deploy in a<br>
precise location. In addition, such devices may be<br>
difficult or impossible to retrieve and/or reposition<br>
should initial positioning not be satisfactory.<br>
Moreover, these devices are specially designed for ASD<br>
and therefore may not be suitable to close and seal a<br>
PFO, particularly because the septum primum (SP)<br>
overlaps the septum secundum (SS).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a delivery system<br>
for delivering a device for closing a passageway in a<br>
body, for example a patent foramen ovale (PFO) in a<br>
heart. The delivery system has an elongate member<br>
having a proximal and distal end. A deflectable needle<br>
assembly having luminal and abluminal surfaces is<br>
slideably engaged within the elongate member. An<br>
actuator is slideabley engaged within the elongate<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
member and attached to the needle tip assembly such that<br>
translational movement of the actuator causes deflection<br>
of the deflectable needle assembly.<br>
The present invention also relates to the method of<br>
deploying a mechanical closure device through the septum<br>
of a heart to facilitate closing of a patent foramen<br>
ovale. The method comprises the steps of accessing the<br>
right atrium of the heart with a deployment device<br>
carrying the mechanical closure device. The mechanical<br>
closure device includes a proximal and distal anchor<br>
with a closure line attached there between. The<br>
deployment device is then advanced distally until the<br>
deployment device penetrates through the interatrial<br>
septum into the left atrium. Once in the left atrium,<br>
the distal end of the deployment device is oriented back<br>
towards the interatrial septum. The deployment device<br>
is advanced until the distal end of the deployment<br>
device penetrates through the interatrial septum into<br>
the right atrium. The distal anchor is deployed from<br>
the distal end of the deployment device into the right<br>
atrium and the deployment device is retracted back from<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
the right atrium to the left atrium, and then from the<br>
left atrium to the right atrium, leaving a portion of<br>
the closure line between the proximal and distal anchors<br>
in the left atrium. The proximal anchor associated with<br>
the mechanical closure device is then deployed from the<br>
distal end of the deployment device into the right<br>
atrium.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The various figures show embodiments of the patent<br>
foramen ovale (PFO) closure device and methods of using<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
the device to close a PFO. The device and related<br>
methods are described herein in connection with<br>
mechanically closing a PFO. These devices, however,<br>
also are suitable for closing other openings or<br>
passageways, including other such openings in the heart,<br>
for example atrial septal defects, ventricular septal<br>
defects, ,and patent ducts arterioses, as well as<br>
openings or passageways in other portions of a body such<br>
as an arteriovenous fistula. The invention therefore is<br>
not limited to use of the inventive closure devices to<br>
close PFO's.<br>
A human heart has four chambers. The upper chambers<br>
are called the left and right atria, and the lower<br>
chambers are called the left and right ventricles. A<br>
wall of muscle called the septum separates the left and<br>
r.i ght atria and the left and right ventricles. That<br>
portion of the septum that separates the two upper<br>
chambers (the right and left atria) of the heart is<br>
termed the atrial (or interatrial ) septum while the<br>
portion of the septum that lies between the two lower<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
chambers (the right and left ventricles) of the heart is<br>
called the ventricular (or interventricular) septum.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a short-axis view of the heart<br>
100 at the level of the right atrium (RA) and left<br>
atrium (LA), in a plane generally parallel to the atrio-<br>
ventricular groove, and at the level of the aortic<br>
valve. This view is looking from caudal to cranial.<br>
Figure 1 also shows the septum primum (SP) 105, a flap-<br>
like structure, which normally covers the foramen ovale<br>
115, an opening in the septum secundum (SS) 110 of the<br>
heart 100. In utero, the foramen ovale 115 serves as a<br>
physiologic conduit for right-to-left shunting of blood<br>
in the fetal heart. After birth, with the establishment<br>
of pulmonary circulation, the increased left atrial<br>
blood flow and pressure presses the septum primum (SP)<br>
105 against the walls of the septum secundum (SS) 110,<br>
covering the foramen ovale 115 and resulting in<br>
functional closure of the foramen ovale 115. This<br>
closure is usually followed by anatomical closure of the<br>
foramen ovale 115 due to fusion of the septum primum<br>
(SP) 105 to the septum secundum (SS) 110.<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
The PFO results when either partial or no fusion of<br>
the septum primum 105 to the septum secundum 110 occurs.<br>
When this condition exists, a passageway (PFO track) 120<br>
between the septum primum 105 and septum secundum 110<br>
may allow communication of blood between the atria.<br>
This PFO track 120 is typically parallel to the plane of<br>
the septum primum 105, and has an opening that is<br>
generally oval in shape. Figure 2 illustrates the<br>
opening of the PFO track 120 as viewed from an end of<br>
the track. Normally the opening is relatively tall, but<br>
quite narrow. The opening may be held closed by the<br>
moan pressure in the left atrium, which is typically<br>
higher than the right atrium. Figure 3 is a close-up<br>
section view of the PFO track 120 held in the closed<br>
position by left atrial pressure. In this position,<br>
the septum primum 105 acts like a one-way valve,<br>
preventing fluid communication between the right and<br>
loft atria through the PFO track 120. Occasionally, the<br>
pressure in the right atrium may temporarily be higher<br>
than the left atrium. When this condition occurs, the<br>
PFO track 12 0 opens and allow some fluid to pass from<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
the right atrium to the left atrium, as indicated in<br>
Figures 4A and 4B. In particular, Figure 4A is a cross-<br>
sectional view showing the PFO track of Figure 2 in an<br>
open configuration. Similarly, Figure 4B is a close-up<br>
section view illustrating the PFO track in an open<br>
configuration.<br>
Although the PFO track 120 is often held closed,<br>
the endothelialized surfaces of the tissues forming the<br>
PFO track 120 prevent the tissue from healing together<br>
and permanently closing the PFO track 120. As can be<br>
seen in Figures 5A - 5C, (a view from line "C-C" of<br>
Figure 1) , the septum primum 105 is firmly attached to<br>
the septum secundum 110 around most of the perimeter of<br>
the Fossa Ovalis 115, but has an opening along one side.<br>
The septum primum 105 is often connected, as shown, by<br>
two or more extensions of tissue along the sides of the<br>
PFO track 120 forming a tunnel. Figure 5D is a<br>
magnified section view of the PFO track 120, showing the<br>
tunnel formed by the tissue extensions. Typically, the<br>
tunnel length in an adult human can range between 2 and<br>
1 3 mm.<br>

WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
The present invention relates to a system and<br>
method for closing a passageway in a body. In a<br>
particular embodiment, the device is used to close the<br>
Patent Foramen Ovale in a human heart. One of ordinary<br>
skill in the art would understand that similar<br>
embodiments could be used to close other passageways and<br>
openings in the body without departing from the general<br>
intent or teachings of the present invention.<br>
Figures 6A and 6B illustrate a delivery system and<br>
device used to close the PFO according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention. The device 600 comprises a<br>
flexible closure line 625 coupled to two expandable<br>
anchors 620, 621. Anchor 620 is coupled to distal end<br>
of the closure line 625, while anchor 62.1 is coupled to<br>
the proxnmal end of the flexible closure line 625.<br>
Anchor 621 is capable of sliding along closure line 625<br>
and locking in desired location to cinch or take-up<br>
slack in closure line 625 length, bringing the proximal<br>
and distal anchors 621, 620 respectively, closer<br>
together and effectively bringing the septum sccundum<br>
110 and the septum primum 105 in close proximation.<br>

WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
It should be noted that the septum secundum. 110 and<br>
the septum primum 105 do not have to be tightly touching<br>
to effect proper closure of the PFO. Instead, the<br>
septum secundum 110 and the septum primum 105 must just<br>
be brought close enough to minimize flow from atria to<br>
atria (typically flow from left atria to right atria).<br>
The locking mechanism incorporated into anchor 62]<br>
may be a device capable of allowing the closure line 625<br>
to slide through anchor 621 in one direction, and<br>
prevent sliding movement in the opposite direction.<br>
Examples of functionally similar commercial locking<br>
mechanisms include the DePuy Mitek RAPIDLOC™ device; zip<br>
ties; and similar linear locking devices known in the<br>
art.<br>
Alternatively, the anchor 621 may be fixed to the<br>
closure line 625 at a predetermined distance from anchor<br>
620. This may particularly be the case when the closure<br>
line 625 has an elastic or recoil ability and is capable<br>
of exerting tension when deployed, pulling the anchors<br>
620, 621 together and effectively compressing the septum<br>
primum 105 to the septum secundum 110. In still a<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
further embodiment of the invention, a closure device<br>
600 may include an elastic closure line 625 and a<br>
slideable anchor 621. In this embodiment, the anchor<br>
621 is capable of allowing the flexible closure line 625<br>
to slide through the anchor 621 in one direction, and<br>
prevent sliding movement in the opposite direction,<br>
while the. closure line 625 exerts tension between the<br>
two anchors 620, 621. These configurations should not<br>
necessarily be considered limiting, and other<br>
combinations of components are contemplated, such as,<br>
for example, both anchors 620 and 621 being slideable<br>
along a substantially elastic or inelastic closure line<br>
625.<br>
The closure line 625 may be any biocompatible<br>
filament known in the art that is capable of securing<br>
the septum primum 105 to the septum secundum 110. In a<br>
preferred embodiment the closure line 625 is a surgical<br>
suture, such as a multifilament non-biodegradable<br>
suture, or a forced entangled fiber filament.<br>
Al ternatively, the closure line 625 may be made from an<br>
clastic material capable of exerting tension when<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
stretched. In yet another alternative embodiment, the<br>
closure line 625 may be geometrically configured to<br>
exhibit structurally elastic behavior. In another<br>
alternative embodiment, the closure line 625 may be made<br>
from an anelastic material such as elastomeric polymers<br>
that are capable of exerting tension when stretched. In<br>
yet another alternative embodiment, the closure line 625<br>
may be made from a super elastic material such as a<br>
nickel titanium alloy.<br>
The anchors 620, 621 are expandable from a first,<br>
predeployed unexpanded configuration to a second<br>
expanded configuration. The anchors 620, 621 are<br>
preferably constructed from a structurally dcformable<br>
material.<br>
Structurally deformable materials are materials<br>
that can elastically or plastically deform without<br>
compromising their integrity. Geometric structures,<br>
such as anchors 620, 621, made from a deformable<br>
material are capable of changing shape when acted upon<br>
by an external force, or removal or an external force.<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
Geometric structures made from structurally<br>
deformable materials are typically self expanding or<br>
mechanically expandable. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
anchors 620, 621 are made from a self-expamding<br>
material, such as Nitinol or a resilient polymer.<br>
However, the self-expanding anchors 620, 621 may also be<br>
made from an elastically compressed spring temper<br>
biocompatible metals. These self-expanding structures<br>
am held in a constrained configuration by an external<br>
force, typically a capture sheath, and elastically<br>
deform when the constraining force is released.<br>
Some structurally deformable materials may also be<br>
mechanically expandable. Geometric structures can be<br>
mechanically expanded by introduction of an external<br>
force, through, for example, a mechanical expansion<br>
means. Mechanical expansion means are well known in the<br>
art and include balloon or cage expansion devices.<br>
Once an external mechanical force is introduced to<br>
the geometric structure, the structure plastically<br>
deforms to its desired final configuration.<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
The anchors 620, 621 in their constrained state are<br>
capable of being held in a restrained low profile<br>
geometry for delivery, and assume an expanded shape<br>
capable of preventing the anchor 620, 621 from<br>
retracting through the septum primum 105 or septum<br>
secundum 110, as the case may be, once deployed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the anchors 620, 621 are<br>
cut from a Nitinol hypotube 700 by methods known in the<br>
art. Figure 7A is a perspective view of the anchor 620<br>
in the cut pre-expanded form.<br>
The anchor 620 is then formed into a desired<br>
expanded configuration and annealed to assume a stress-<br>
free (relaxed) state. In one embodiment of the<br>
invention, the anchor 620, 621 is formed into a basket<br>
shaped configuration, having a plurality of legs 73 0. A<br>
perspective view of the expanded basket anchor 620<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention is<br>
illustrated in Figure 7B.<br>
Once the closure device 600 is deployed, the basket<br>
shaped anchors 620, 621 collapse under tensioning of the<br>
closure line 625, into a flattened "flower petal" shape<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
as illustrated in Figure 7C. In this state, the anchors<br>
620, 621 are under strain. The super elastic properties<br>
of the anchors 620, 621 under strain exert an axially<br>
outward force against the adjacent tissue, putting the<br>
closure line 625 in tension.<br>
Figure 8A illustrates the closure device 600 having<br>
flower petal shaped anchors 620, 621 deployed through<br>
the septum secundum and septum primum along the PFO<br>
tract to close the PFO according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The proximal anchor 621 in<br>
Figure 8A also includes a locking mechanism 622<br>
integrated therein.<br>
This anchor design should not be considered a<br>
Limiting feature of the invention, as other shapes and<br>
configurations of anchors 620, 621 are also contemplated<br>
by the present design. This may include, for example,<br>
expandable disc design, star design, j-hook design, or<br>
any expandable geometric shape. In addition other<br>
materials exhibiting similar characteristics, such as<br>
non-biodegradable swellable polymers, are similarly<br>
contemplated by the present invention. Still, other<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
designs for anchors 620, 621 may include long-aspect<br>
dimensioned objects axially aligned in needles 605, 610<br>
in the constrained state. Once deployed, the long axis<br>
of the anchor 620, 621 rotates substantially<br>
perpendicular to the needle 605, 610 longitudinal axis,<br>
effectively anchoring the closure line 625 in place.<br>
Although Figure 8A illustrates the closure device<br>
600 deployed through the septum secundum 110 and septum<br>
primum 105 along the PFO track 120, it should be<br>
understood that the closure device 600 may be deployed<br>
through other locations to achieve the same results, as<br>
illustrated in Figures 8B through 8J. For example,<br>
Figure 8B illustrates one leg of the closure device 600<br>
deployed through both the septum secundum 110 and septum<br>
primum 105, while the second leg of the closure device<br>
600 penetrates only through the septum secundum 110.<br>
Similarly, Figure 8C illustrates one leg of the<br>
closure device 600 deployed through both the septum<br>
secundum 110 and septum primum 105, while the second leg<br>
of the closure device 600 penetrates only through the<br>
septum primum 105.<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
Figure 8D illustrates one leg of the closure device<br>
600 penetrating only through the septum secundum 110,<br>
while the second leg of the closure device 600<br>
penetrates only through the septum primum 105.<br>
Figure 8E illustrates each leg of the closure<br>
device 600 penetrating through the septum primum 105,<br>
but not the septum secundum 110. However, the distal<br>
anchor 620 is located to exert pressure against the<br>
septum secundum 110 and septum primum 105 when the<br>
closure device 600 is tensioned. This pressure forces<br>
the septum secundum 110 and septum primum 105 into close<br>
proximity and facilitates the PFO closure.<br>
Each of the above Figures 8A through 8E illustrate<br>
the anchors 620, 621 and closure line 625 in a<br>
particular orientation. It should be understood that<br>
position of the anchor structures 620, 62.1 may be<br>
reversed.<br>
Figures 8A through 8E illustrate the final position<br>
of each anchor device 620, 621 in the right atrial<br>
chamber, with the closure line 625 looping from the<br>
right atrial chamber through the left atrial chamber and<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
back into the right atrial chamber. However, it should<br>
be understood that the closure device 600 may be<br>
deployed such that the distal anchor 620 is located in<br>
the left atrial chamber, while the proximal anchor 621<br>
is located in the right atrial chamber.<br>
Figures 8F through 8J illustrate the closure device<br>
600 deployed at various locations across the septum<br>
primum 105 and/or septum secundum 110. Although the<br>
penetration through the septum primum 105 and/or septum<br>
secundum 110 are shown at different locations, common to<br>
each of the illustrated deployments is the location of<br>
the distal anchor 620 and the proximal anchor 621 in the<br>
left and right atrial chambers respectively.<br>
Figure 8F illustrates substantial closure of the<br>
PFO tract 120 with a single penetration through both the<br>
septum primum 105 and septum secundum 110.<br>
It should be noted that both the septum primum 105<br>
and septum secundum 110 do not have to be penetrated to<br>
maintain close enough proximity between the septal<br>
tissues to achieve proper closure of the PFO. Figure 8G<br>
illustrates substantial closure of the PFO with a single<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
penetration only through the septum primum 105. Im the<br>
illustrated embodiment, there is significant overlap<br>
between the septum primum 105 and septum secundum 110<br>
creating a fairly long track 120. The distal and<br>
proximal anchors 620, 621 respectively are sized to<br>
exert enough force on the septum primum 105 and septum<br>
secundum 110 to facilitate closing of the PFO track 120<br>
when the closure line 625 is tensioned.<br>
The PFO closure device 600 can be used to<br>
facilitate closing the PFO track 120 when other defects<br>
in the septal wall are present. For example, the PFO<br>
closure device 600 may be used when an atrial septal<br>
aneurysm (ASA) 805 is present. An ASA is characterized<br>
as a saccular deformity, generally at the level of the<br>
fossa ovale, which protrudes to the right or left<br>
atrium, or both. Figure 8H illustrates substantial<br>
closure of the PFO, where an ASA is present, with a<br>
single penetration only through the septum primum 105.<br>
However, the distal and proximal anchors, 620 and 621<br>
respectively, are sized to contact both the septum<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
primum 105 and septum secundum 110 to facilitate closing<br>
of the PFO track 120.<br>
The single penetration method may also be employed<br>
where there is minimal overlap between the septum primum<br>
10b and septum secundum 110. This so called "short<br>
tunnel" PFO may not be readily closed with prior art<br>
intra-tunnel methods. Figure 8I illustrates<br>
substantial closure of the PFO with a single penetration<br>
through the septum primum 105.<br>
Similar to the single penetration method<br>
illustrated in Figures 8F through 8I, Lhe closure device<br>
600 may be deployed using a single penetration through<br>
the septum secundum 110 as illustrated in Figure 8J.<br>
The present invention utilizes a removable<br>
deployment device to introduce the mechanical closure<br>
device 600 into the atrium of the heart, preferably<br>
through a minimally invasive, transluminal procedure.<br>
One such deployment device 630 is shown in Figure 6A.<br>
Minimally invasive heart surgery refers to several<br>
approaches for performing heart operations that are less<br>
diificult and risky than conventional open-heart<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
surgery. These approaches restore healthy blood flow to<br>
the heart without having to stop the heart and put the<br>
patient on a heart-lung machine during surgery.<br>
Minimally invasive, procedures are carried out by<br>
entering the body through the skin, a body cavity or<br>
anatomical opening, but with the smallest damage<br>
possible to these structures. This results in less<br>
operative trauma for the patient. It also less<br>
expensive, reduces hospitalization time, causes less<br>
pain and scarring, and reduces the incidence of<br>
complications related to the surgical trauma, speeding<br>
the recovery.<br>
One example of a minimally invasive procedure for<br>
performing heart surgery is a trans-thoracic<br>
laparoscopic (endoscopic) procedure. The part of the<br>
mammalian body that is situated between the neck and the<br>
abdomen and supported by the ribs, costal cartilages,<br>
and sternum is known as the thorax. This division of<br>
the body cavity lies above the diaphragm, is bounded<br>
peripherally by the wall of the chest, and contains the<br>
heart and lungs. Once into the thorax, the surgeon can<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
gain access to the atrium of the heart through an<br>
atriotomy, a surgical incision of an atrium of the<br>
heart. For example, if the surgeon wishes to gain<br>
access to the right atrium they will perform an<br>
atriotomy in the right atrial appendage.<br>
The primary advantage of a trans-thoracic laparosopic<br>
procedure is that there is no need to make a large<br>
incision. Instead, the surgeon operates through 3 or 4<br>
tiny openings about the size of buttonholes, while<br>
viewing the patient's internal organs on a monitor.<br>
There is no large incision to heal, so patients have<br>
less pain and recover sooner. Rather than a 6- to 9-<br>
inch incision, the laparoscopic technique utilized only<br>
4 Liny openings - all less than 1/2 inch in diameter.<br>
Another minimally invasive technique for gaining<br>
access to the heart and deploying the closure device is<br>
a percutaneous transluminal procedure. Percutaneous<br>
surgical techniques pertain to any medical procedure<br>
where access to inner organs or other tissue is done via<br>
needle-puncture of the skin, rather than by using an<br>
"open" approach where inner organs or tissue are exposed<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
(typically with the use of scalpel) . The percutaneous<br>
approach is commonly used in vascular procedures, where<br>
access to heart is gained through the venous or arterial<br>
systems. This involves a needle catheter getting access<br>
to a blood vessel, followed by the introduction of a<br>
wire through the lumeir of the needle. It is over this<br>
wire that other catheters can be placed into the blood<br>
vessel. This technique is known as the modified<br>
Seldinger technique. The PFO closure device 600 may<br>
also be deployed via percutaneous methods by steerable<br>
catheters or guidewires.<br>
In the Seldinger technique a peripheral vein (such<br>
as a femoral vein) is punctured with a needle, the<br>
puncture wound is dilated with a dilator to a size<br>
sufficient to accommodate an introducer sheath, and an<br>
introducer sheath with at least one hemostatic valve is<br>
seated within the dilated puncture wound while<br>
maintaining relative hemostasis.<br>
Penetration of the interatrial septum requi res<br>
piecing the septal wall. In a preferred embodiment this<br>
penetration is accomplished by using a needle, trocar or<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
similar device to accomplish non-core cutting of the<br>
interatrial septum. In one embodiment of the invention,<br>
the non-core cutting device is a tubular needle-like<br>
structure, however other configurations and shaped<br>
structures may be used as would be understood by one<br>
 skilled in the art. The needle tube is a substantially<br>
rigid structure capable of penetrating the septum<br>
secundum 110 and septum primum 105 along the PFO track<br>
120. The needle is preferably sized to be 13 French or<br>
smaller, most preferably 10 French or smaller, and made<br>
from a biocompatible material, such as, for example<br>
surgical stainless steel, Nitinol, or Cobalt-Chromium<br>
alloys. It should be understood that_ these materials<br>
are not meant to limit the scope of the invention. Any<br>
biocompatible material capable of being sharpened and<br>
holding a sharp edge, and having sufficient strength to<br>
facilitate penetration through the septum secundum 110<br>
and/or septum primum 105, may be suitable. The needle<br>
is constructed with a tapered distal end, as is known in<br>
the art. In a preferred embodiment, the geometric<br>
configuration of the tapered distal end is optimized to<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
minimize induced tissue trauma at the site of<br>
penetration. In addition, the needle is of sufficient<br>
body length to penetrate both the septum secundud 110<br>
and septum primum 105, while still maintaining the<br>
needed size and axial flexibility to navigate the<br>
tertuous vessel anatomy when being delivered to the"<br>
heart percutaneously.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, penetrating<br>
the interatrial septum may be accomplished by drilling<br>
through the septum.<br>
With the introducer sheath in place, the guiding<br>
catheter or delivery member 630 of the closure device is<br>
introduced through the hemostatic valve of the<br>
introducer sheath and is advanced along the peripheral<br>
vein, into the region of the vena caveat, and into the<br>
right atrium.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the distal tip<br>
of the delivery device 630 is positioned against the<br>
interatrial septal wall. In the case of a septum<br>
having a PFO, the interatrial septal wall may be the<br>
septum primum 105 and/or septum secundum 110, as the<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
case may be. A needle or trocar associated with the<br>
delivery device 63 0 is then advanced distally until it<br>
punctures the septum primum 105 and or septum secundum<br>
110. A separate dilator may also be advanced with the<br>
needle through the septum primum 105 and/or septum<br>
secundum 110 to prepare an access port through the<br>
septum primum 105 and/or septum secundum 110 for seating<br>
the delivery device 630. The delivery device 630<br>
traverses across the septum and is seated in the left<br>
atrium, thereby providing access for closure devices 600<br>
through its own inner lumen and into the left atrium.<br>
It is however further contemplated that other left<br>
atrial access methods may be suitable substitutes for<br>
using the delivery device 630 and closure device 600 of<br>
the present invention. In one alternative variation not<br>
shown, a "retrograde" approach may be used, wherein the<br>
delivery device 630 is advanced into the left atrium<br>
from the arterial system. In this variation, the<br>
Seldinger technique is employed to gain vascular access<br>
into the arterial system, rather than the venous, for<br>
example, at a femoral artery. The delivery device 63 0<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
is advanced retrogradedly through the aorta, around the<br>
aortic arch, into the ventricle, and then into the left-<br>
atrium through the mitral valve.<br>
Once in the desired atrium of the heart the closure<br>
device 600 is deployed transeptally from one atria to<br>
the other. For the purpose of this invention,<br>
transeptally is defined as deployment from one atria to<br>
the other through the septum (septum primum 105 and/or<br>
septum secundum 110), as apposed to intra-atrial access<br>
through the PFO tract 120 (tunnel) . In the case of a<br>
heart having a patent foramen ovale, transeptal<br>
penetration may be through the septum primum (SP) 105<br>
and/or septum secundum (SS) 110, or visa versa,<br>
whichever the case may be. Preferably, the angle of<br>
transeptal penetration is between 45 and 135 degrees to<br>
the surface of the septum, but is most preferably<br>
orthogonal to the surface of the septum.<br>
By way of example, in one embodiment of the present<br>
invention using right atrial access, the right atrium is<br>
first accessed by the delivery device 630 (and closure<br>
device 600) . The closure device 600 may then be<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
deployed by penetrating the interatrial septum (septum<br>
primum 105 and/or septum secundum 110) from the right<br>
atrial chamber to the left atrial chamber in the heart,<br>
and deploying the distal anchor 620 associated with the<br>
closure device 600 into the left atrial chamber. After<br>
successful deployment of the distal anchor 620, the<br>
delivery device 63 0 may be partially withdrawn from the<br>
loft atrial chamber to the right atrial chamber, leaving<br>
the distal anchor 620 in place. The proximal anchor 621<br>
associated with the closure device 600 can then be<br>
deployed into the right atrial chamber. This<br>
substantially linear atrial deployment method is shown<br>
in Figures 8F through 8J.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the right<br>
atrium is first accessed by the delivery device 63 0 (and<br>
closure device 600). The closure device 600 may then be<br>
deployed by penetrating the interatrial septum (septum<br>
primum 105 and/or septum secundum 110) from the right<br>
atrial chamber to the left atrial chamber in the heart.<br>
Once in the left atrial chamber, the delivery device 630<br>
(and closure device 600) are turned and re-penetrate the<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
interatrial septum (septum primum 105 arid/or septum<br>
secundum 110) from the left atrial chamber to the right<br>
atrial chamber in the heart though a different access<br>
point. The various preferred access points are shown in<br>
Figures 8A through 8E. Once back in the right atrial<br>
chamber of the heart, the distal anchor 620 may be<br>
deployed. After successful deployment of the distal<br>
anchor 620, the delivery device 630 may be partially<br>
withdrawn from the right atrial chamber to the left<br>
atrial chamber, leaving the distal anchor 620 in place<br>
in the right atrium. The delivery device 63 0 may then<br>
be withdrawn back through the interatrial septum (septum<br>
primum 105 and/or septum secundum 110) from the left<br>
atrium to the right atrium. The proximal anchor 621<br>
associated with the closure device 600 can then be<br>
deployed into the right atrial chamber.<br>
Similar procedures are employed when left an atrial<br>
access technique is used. For example, in one<br>
embodiment of the present invention using left atrial<br>
access, the left atrium is first accessed by the<br>
delivery device 630 (and closure device 600) . The<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
closure device 600 may then be deployed by penetrating<br>
the interatrial septum (septum primum 105 and/or septum<br>
secundum 110) from the left atrial chamber to the right<br>
atrial chamber in the heart, and deploying the distal<br>
anchor 620 associated with the closure device into the<br>
first atrium, After successful deploymenl of the distal<br>
anchor 620, the delivery device 630 may be partially<br>
withdrawn from the right atrial chamber to the left<br>
atrial chamber, leaving the distal anchor 620 in place.<br>
The proximal anchor 621 associated with the closure<br>
device can then be deployed into the left atrial<br>
chamber.<br>
Once the proximal anchor is deployed, the closure<br>
device may be cinched to bring the proximal and distal<br>
anchors closer together. This results in the septum<br>
secundum 110 and the septum primum 105 being brought in<br>
close proximation to facilitate closure of the Patent<br>
Foramen Ovale. It should be noted that the septum<br>
secundum 110 and the septum primum 105 do not have to be<br>
tightly touching to effect proper closure of the PFO.<br>
Instead, the septum secundum 310 and the septum primum<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
105 must just be brought close enough to minimize flow<br>
from atria to atria (typically flow from right atria to<br>
left atria).<br>
To achieve and maintain the proximity between, the<br>
septum secundum 110 and the septum primum 105, it may be<br>
necessary to adjust the proximal anchor by uni axially<br>
cinching or sliding the proximal anchor 620 along<br>
closure line 625. In one embodiment of the invention,<br>
cinching comprises uni-axially adjusting the proximal<br>
anchor relative to a closure line associated with the<br>
closure device. In another embodiment of the invention,<br>
cinching comprises incrementally adjusting the proximal<br>
anchor relative to a closure line associated with the<br>
closure device.<br>
Once the closure device is cinched in place the<br>
method may further comprise assessing the degree of<br>
proximation between the septum secundum 110 and the<br>
septum primum 105.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the clinician<br>
may visually assess the proximation though an endoscopic<br>
or fluoroscopic procedure. In addition, other methods<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
may be used to measure the proximation between the<br>
septum secundum 110 and the septum primum 105, such as<br>
through pressure observation or infrared imaging.<br>
After proper cinching, any unwanted length of<br>
closure line 625 that remains unconstrained within the<br>
right atrium may be meehanically removel. Devices Known<br>
in the art capable of removing the excess closure line<br>
62b include catheter-based snare and cut devices. In<br>
addition to independent devices, a mechanical cut and<br>
removal mechanism may be integrated into the deployment<br>
device.<br>
The closure device will then be in position, with the<br>
anchors 620, 621 opened against the septum secundum 13 0,<br>
and the closure line 625 connecting the anchors 620, 621<br>
through the septum primum 105 and septum secundum 110,<br>
thus holding the septum primum 105 in place.<br>

WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
To locate and deploy the closure device 600 at the<br>
location of the PFO, the present invention utilizes a<br>
removable deployment device 630. The deployment device<br>
630 loaded with a closure device 600 according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention in illustrated in<br>
Figure 6A. The removable deployment device 630<br>
comprises a deflectable needle tip assembly 605, a<br>
needle actuator 606, a catheter shaft 607, a plunger<br>
60S, a catheter sheath 609 and a handle 610.<br>
The catheter sheath 609 is the outermost tube-like<br>
structure that is sized to house the needle assembly<br>
60b, catheter shaft 607, needle actuator 606 and plunger<br>
during delivery. The catheter sheath 609 is<br>
diametrically sized to slideably engage the catheter<br>
shaft 607. The main function of the catheter sheath 609<br>
is to protect the needle assembly 605, as well as the<br>
body lumen, during delivery. The catheter sheath 609 is<br>
attached along its proximal end to handle 610. Catheter<br>
sheaths are well known in the art.<br>
The handle 610 is operated by a clinician to<br>
deflect the needle assembly 605 in the desired<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
direction. As such, the handle has a means for<br>
receiving movement from the clinician, and transferring<br>
that movement into translational movement for actuation<br>
of needle 611 deflection.<br>
The needle tip assembly 605 further comprises a<br>
needle 611 and needle support tube 612, capable of<br>
puncturing through the septum secundum 110 and/or septum<br>
primum 105. The needle 611 is a substantially rigid<br>
needle like structure capable of penetrating the septum<br>
Secundum 110 and septum primum 105 along the PFO track<br>
120. The needle 611 is preferably sized to be 10 French<br>
or smaller and made from a biocompatible material, such<br>
as, for example surgical stainless steel, Nitinol, or<br>
Cobalt-Chromium alloys. It should be understood that<br>
these materials are not meant to limit the scope of the<br>
invention. Any biocompatible material capable of being<br>
sharpened and holding a sharp edge, and having<br>
sufficient strength to facilitate penetration through<br>
the septum secundum 110 and/or septum primum, may be<br>
suitable. The needle 611 is constructed with a tapered<br>
distal end, as is known in the art.<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the geometric<br>
configuration of the tapered distal end is optimized to<br>
minimize induced tissue trauma at the site of<br>
penetration. In addition, the needle 611 is of<br>
sufficient body length to penetrate both the septum<br>
secundum 110 and septum primum 105, while still<br>
maintaining the needed size and axial flexibility to<br>
navigate the tortuous vessel anatomy when being<br>
delivered to the heart 100.<br>
To assist the needle tip assembly 605 in deflecting<br>
within the needle support tube 612, the needle is<br>
comprised of a needle tip 613 connected along its<br>
proximal end to a first elongate member having a needle<br>
tang 614 and a second elongate needle member, i.e.<br>
needle spine 615. The needle spine 615 is further<br>
connected to the proximal needle body 616. The proximal<br>
end of the first elongate needle member 614 ends with a<br>
tab (tab B) , which acts as a pivot point for the<br>
deflection of the needle tip assembly 605 as explained<br>
be]ow. The needle support tube 612 acts to constrain<br>
the needle 611 when deflecting. As disclosed above, the<br>
44<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
purpose of this connection point is to provide a pivot<br>
po.int for the needle 611 when deflecting. However, one<br>
of skill in the art would understand that the catheter<br>
shaft 607 could be made an integral part of the needle<br>
assembly 605.<br>
The eatheter shaft 607- is an elongate tube like<br>
structure substantially coaxial with catheter sheath<br>
609, and diametrically sized such that the needle<br>
actuator 606 is slideably engaged with catheter shaft<br>
607. That is to say, the outer diameter of needle<br>
actuator 606 is smaller than the inner bore diameter of<br>
catheter shaft 607, allowing the needle actuator 606 to<br>
slide within the catheter shaft 607.<br>
The proximal end of the needle body 616 is attached<br>
to a needle actuator 606 at tab A. The proximal end of<br>
the needle actuator is attached to the handle 610 and<br>
provide the mechanism for transferring the translational<br>
movement supplied by the handle 610 to the needle<br>
assembly 605. This translational movement results in<br>
the needle assembly deflecting the needle 611 up or<br>
down, depending on the movement imparted by the handle<br>
45<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
610. Accordingly, the needle actuator 606 must be rigid<br>
enough to transmit the translational movement, yet<br>
flexible enough to endure the tortuous anatomy when the<br>
deployment device is delivered through the body's<br>
vasculature. One of skill in the art would understand<br>
that the needle actuator 606 could be made an integral<br>
part of the needle assembly 605.<br>
To deploy the closure device 600, the deployment<br>
device 63 0 utilizes a plunger 608. The plunger 608 is<br>
substantially coaxial with catheter shaft 607 and<br>
diametrically sized such that the plunger 608 is<br>
slideably engaged with catheter shaft 607. That is to<br>
say, the outer diameter of plunger 608 is smaller than<br>
the inner bore diameter of catheter shaft 607, allowing<br>
the plunger 615 to be pushed through and telescope from<br>
the catheter shaft 607 and needle 611. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, plunger 608 is also<br>
appropriately sized to push anchor 620 from the distal<br>
end of the needle 611.<br>
During deployment, plunger 608 pushes against<br>
anchor 620 until anchor 620 is deployed from the distal<br>
46<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
end of needle 611. The movement of anchor 620<br>
necessarily translates to movement of anchor 621 through<br>
closure line 625. Anchor 621 is appropriately sized to<br>
allow anchor 621 to slide through needle 611.<br>
Accordingly, the inside diameter of plunger 608 is<br>
smaller than the outside diameter of anchor 620.<br>
Conversely, the outside diameter of anchor 621 must be<br>
smaller than the inside diameter of needle 611.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the plunger 608<br>
is made from a flexible material such that it can be<br>
deformed by needle 611 upon inner needle 611's<br>
deflection by needle actuator 606. Flexibility may also<br>
be imparted to the plunger 608 by geometry, such as<br>
fabricating the plunger 608 from spring steel into a<br>
tightly wound coil. However, the plunger 608 must also<br>
have the necessary stiffness to be able to deploy the<br>
closure device 600 from the distal end of needle 611.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the plunger 608 is made from<br>
stainless steel, Nitinol, or Cobalt-Chromium alloy, but<br>
any material exhibiting the desired characteristics of<br>
flegibility and "push-ability" may be used.<br>
47<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
This curved shape of the needle assembly may be<br>
assumed by mechanical manipulation, such as through<br>
manipulation of the needle actuator 606. Referring<br>
again to Figures 6C and 6D, the needle 611 is shown and<br>
described as having separate components (needle body<br>
616, neadle spine 615 needle tang 614 and needle tip<br>
613) . However, it should be understood that the needle<br>
is broken down into separate components for ease of<br>
illustration and explanation. In a preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention, the body 616, spine 615, tang 614 and<br>
needle tip 613 are formed as a monolithic unit from a<br>
single piece of material.<br>
As previously described, the needle actuator 606 is<br>
slideably engaged with catheter shaft 607, and thus can<br>
freely move within catheter shaft 607. The tang 614 is<br>
attached to the catheter shaft 607 at tab B, such that<br>
the catheter shaft 607 and tang 614 cannot move relative<br>
to one another. Similarly, the proximal end of needle<br>
body 616 is attached to the distal end of needle<br>
actuator 606 at tab A, such that the needle body 616 and<br>
needle actuator 606 cannot move relative to one another.<br>
48<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
However, the needle spine 615 is not attached to the<br>
catheter shaft 607, and is free to move within the<br>
catheter shaft. The spine 615 of needle 611 is rigidly<br>
attached to the distal end of needle body 616 such that<br>
any movement of body 616 is translated directly to the<br>
spine 615. To deflect the naedle 611, the needle<br>
actuator 606 is translated relative to the catheter<br>
shaft 607. This movement is translated to the spine<br>
615, which is free to move relative to the catheter<br>
shaft 607. Since the tang 614 of needle 611 is<br>
constrained by the catheter shaft 607, the tang 614,<br>
particularly the tab B, will act as a pivot point for<br>
needle 611 to deflect. Referring to Figure 6A, if the<br>
needle actuator 606 is translated distally, the spine<br>
615 is translated distally relative to the catheter<br>
shaft 607 and deflect the needle 611 upward. Similarly,<br>
if the needle actuator 606 is translated proximally, the<br>
spine 615 is translated proximally relative to the<br>
catheter shaft 607, and deflect the needle 611 downward.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the needle 611 is<br>
fabricated to resume a pre-determined configuration when<br>
49<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
the force providing the translation of the needle<br>
actuator 606 is removed. One material exhibiting shape<br>
memory or super-elastic characteristics is Nitinol .<br>
Nitinol is utilized in a wide variety of<br>
applications, including medical device applications as<br>
deseribed above. Nitinol or N±Ti alloys are widely<br>
utilized in the fabrication or construction of medical<br>
devices for a number of reasons, including its<br>
biomechanical compatibility, its biocompatibility, its<br>
fatigue resistance, its kink resistance, its uniform<br>
plastic deformation, its magnetic resonance imaging<br>
compatibility, its ability to exert constant and gentle<br>
outward pressure, its dynamic interference, its thermal<br>
deployment capability, its elastic deployment<br>
capability, its hysteresis characteristics, and is<br>
moderately radiopaque.<br>
Nitinol, as described above, exhibits shape memory<br>
and/or super-elastic characteristics. Shape memory<br>
characteristics may be simplistically described as<br>
follows. A metallic structure, for example, a Nitinol<br>
tube that is in an Austenitic phase may be cooled to a<br>
50<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
temperature such that it is in the Martensitic phase.<br>
Once in the Martensitic phase, the Nitinol tube may be<br>
deformed into a particular configuration or shape by the<br>
application of stress. As long as the Nitinol tube is<br>
maintained in the Martensitic phase, the Nitinol tube<br>
will remain in its deformed shape. If the Nitinol tube<br>
is heated to a temperature sufficient to cause the<br>
Nitinol tube to reach the Austenitic phase, the Nitinol<br>
tube will return to its original or programmed shape.<br>
The original shape is programmed to be a particular<br>
shape by well-known techniques.<br>
Super-elastic characteristics may be simplistically<br>
described as follows. A metallic structure for example,<br>
a Nitinol tube that is in an Austenitic phase may be<br>
deformed to a particular shape or configuration by the<br>
application of mechanical energy. The application of<br>
mechanical energy causes a stress induced Martensitic<br>
phase transformation. In other words, the mechanical<br>
energy causes the Nitinol tube to transform from the<br>
Austenitic phase to the Martensitic phase. By utilizing<br>
the appropriate measuring instruments, one can<br>
51<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
determined that the stress from the mechanical energy<br>
causes a temperature drop in the Nitinol tube. Once the<br>
mechanical energy or stress is released, the Nitinol<br>
tube undergoes another mechanical phase transformation<br>
back to the Austenitic phase and thus its original or<br>
programmed shape. AS described above, the original<br>
shape is programmed by well know techniques. The<br>
Martensitic and Austenitic phases are common phases in<br>
many metals.<br>
Medical devices constructed from Nitinol are<br>
typically utilized in both the Martensitic phase and/or<br>
the Austenitic phase. The Martensitic phase is the low<br>
temperature phase. A material, is in the Martensitic<br>
phase is typically very soft and malleable. These<br>
properties make it easier to shape or configure the<br>
Nitinol into complicated or complex structures. The<br>
Austenitic phase is the high temperature phase. A<br>
material in the Austenitic phase is generally much<br>
stronger than the material in the Martensitic phase.<br>
Typically, many medical devices are cooled to the<br>
Martensitic phase for manipulation and loading into<br>
52<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
delivery systems. When the device is deployed at body<br>
temperature, they return to the Austenitic phase.<br>
Other materials that have shape memory<br>
characteristics may also be used, for example, some<br>
polymers and metallic composition materials. It should<br>
be understood that these materials are not meant to<br>
limit the scope of the invention. Any biocompatible<br>
material capable of being sharpened and holding a sharp<br>
edge, and having sufficient strength to facilitate<br>
penetration through the septum secundum 110 and/or<br>
septum primum, may be suitable. The inner needle 610 is<br>
constructed with a tapered distal end, as is known in<br>
the art. In a preferred embodiment the geometric<br>
configuration or the tapered distal end is optimized to<br>
minimize induced tissue trauma at the site of<br>
penetration.<br>
Regardless of the material used, the inner needle<br>
610 must be flexible enough to remain substantially<br>
straight when constrained inside outer needle 605, but<br>
rigid enough to puncture through the septum secunduin 110<br>
53<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
and septum primum 105 once deployed from the distal end<br>
of outer needle 605.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention may include a<br>
location monitoring system to facilitate placement of<br>
the deployment device 630. In particular, the location<br>
monitoring device will assiste in determining whether the<br>
clinician is in the correct chamber of the heart.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the location monitoring<br>
system includes the ability to measure localized<br>
pressure relative to the distal end of the deployment<br>
device 63 0. The pressure measurement read by the<br>
location monitoring system may be achieved by<br>
electronic, mechanical and/or physical means, such as a<br>
solid-state pressure transducer, spring loaded<br>
diaphragm, hydraulic pressure port, and/or communicating<br>
manometer. These and other pressure measurement<br>
techniques would be known by one of skill in the art.<br>
Figure 10 is a perspective view illustrating exemplary<br>
sensors, such as a hydraulic pressure port 65b or<br>
electrical pressure transducer 660.<br>
54<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
By way of example it is well known that pressures<br>
vary in different locations within the cardiovascular<br>
system. Specifically, gage pressure in the right and<br>
left atrium are know to range from approximately 1-6<br>
mmHg to 10 mmHg respectfully. Similarly, gage pressure<br>
within the ascending aerta ranges from approximately 120<br>
to 160 mmHg during systole.<br>
Before deployment, the clinician will first monitor<br>
pressure within the right atrium. This reading should<br>
indicate a pressure of 1-6 mmHg. The distal end of the<br>
needle 611 will be inserted through the septal wall<br>
(septum primum 105 and/or septum secundum 110) and into<br>
the left atrium. The monitored pressure should change<br>
to approximately 10 mmHg. A much higher reading, such<br>
as in the range of approximately 120 to 3 60 mmHg,<br>
indicates puncture of the aorta. The clinician will<br>
then have to retract the needle 611 and reposition the<br>
delivery device 63 0 for re-entry. Similarly, once in<br>
the left atrium the needle 611 is advanced back into the<br>
right atrium. The clinician should observe a pressure<br>
change from 10 mmHg to 1-6 mmHg.<br>
55<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
To facilitate deployment of the closure device 600,<br>
the deployment device 630 may include features that<br>
provide backup support. This backup support may<br>
include, for example: an axially asymmetric expansion<br>
member attached along an catheter sheath 609, such as a<br>
balloen or self expanding cage 640, a sptine 645; or<br>
imparting a shape 650 along the body of the deployment<br>
device 63 0. Examples of these backup support features<br>
are illustrated in Figures 9A through 9C, respectively.<br>
It should be understood that the outer shaft 63 5<br>
may be part of the guiding catheter, or integrated into<br>
the deployment device 630. These and other such backup<br>
support devices would be understood by one of skill in<br>
the art. These backup support features can also be<br>
incorporated onto accessory devices, such as the guide<br>
catheter.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the deployment<br>
device 630 is first positioned within the left atrium<br>
according to a transeptal access method, which is<br>
further described in more detail as follows. The right<br>
venous system is first accessed using the "Seldinger"<br>
56<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
technique, wherein a peripheral vein (such as a femoral<br>
vein) is punctured with a needle, the puncture wound is<br>
dilated with a dilator to a size sufficient to<br>
accommodate an introducer sheath, and an introducer<br>
sheath with at least one hemostatic valve is seated<br>
within the dilated puncture wound while maintaining<br>
relative hemostasis. With the introducer sheath in<br>
place, the guiding catheter or sheath is introduced<br>
through the hemostatic valve of the introducer sheath<br>
and is advanced along the peripheral vein, into the<br>
region of the vena cavae, and into the right atrium.<br>
Once in the right atrium, the distal tip of the<br>
catheter sheath 609 is positioned against the septum<br>
secundum 110 in the intra-atrial septal wall. The<br>
catheter sheath 609 is then retracted exposing the<br>
needle assembly 605. The deployment device 630 is then<br>
advanced distally until the needle assembly 605<br>
punctures through both the septum secundum 110 and<br>
septum primum 105 into the left atrium. The<br>
configuration of the deployment device 630, including<br>
closure device 600 puncturing through the septum<br>
57<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
secundum 110 and septum primum 105 is shown in Figure<br>
11.<br>
Once the deployment device 630, particularly the<br>
needle assembly 605 penetrates through both the septum<br>
secundum 110 and septum primum 105, the needle actuator<br>
606 is advanced distally, causing the needle 611 to<br>
deflect upward. Figure 12 illustrates the configuration<br>
of the deployment device 630 and closure device 600<br>
after the needle actuator 606 is advanced distally by<br>
manipulation of the handle 610 by the clinician.<br>
After the needle 611 is deflected, the deployment<br>
device 630 is pulled back until the needle 611<br>
penetrates through the septum _ primum 105 and septum<br>
secundum 110, respectively, into the right atrium. In<br>
one embodiment of the invention, this is accomplished by<br>
ensuring that the needle 611 remains fixed relative to<br>
catheter shaft 607 and catheter sheath 609, and then<br>
withdrawing the catheter shaft 607 and catheter sheath<br>
609 left atrium until the needle 611 makes the necessary<br>
penetration into the right atrium. Figure 13<br>
illustrates the final position of the deployment device<br>
58<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
63 0 and closure device 600 after the needle 611<br>
penetrates into the right atrium.<br>
After the needle 611 has penetrated the septum '<br>
primum 105 and septum secundum 110 into the right<br>
atrium, the first anchor 620 can be deployed. As<br>
earlier described, the anchor 620 is deployed into the<br>
right atrium by holding the catheter shaft 607 steady,<br>
and advancing the plunger 615 through the needle 611.<br>
During deployment, plunger 615 pushes against the back<br>
portion of hook 620 until anchor 620 is advanced from<br>
the distal end of needle 611. The movement of anchor<br>
620 necessarily translates to movement of anchor 621<br>
through closure line .625. As anchor 620 enters the<br>
right atrium the shape memory material properties allow<br>
the anchor 620 to assume it unconstrained shape. Figure<br>
14 illustrates the anchor 620 deployed from the needle<br>
611 by the plunger 615 according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
To deploy anchor 621, the deployment device 630 is<br>
pushed back into the left atrium, pulling the needle<br>
back from the right atrium to the left atrium to a<br>
59<br><br>
WO 2007/008565	PCT/US2006/026294<br>
position indicated in Figure 15. This will leave the<br>
plunger 615 and the closure assembly in place<br>
penetrating the septum primum 105 and septum secundum<br>
13 0 in two places. The anchor 621 will remain in the<br>
constrained position inside plunger 615. The needle 611<br>
is then allowed to revert to its original straight<br>
configuration, and the deployment device 630 is<br>
retracted back through the left atrium into the right<br>
atrium as shown in Figure 16. This will leave the<br>
closure device 600 in place, with anchor 620 fully<br>
deployed against the septum secundum 110, and anchor 621<br>
constrained inside needle 611. The plunger 635 can once<br>
again be advance and the needle 611 withdrawn from the<br>
septum primum 105 and septum secundum 110 respectively,<br>
releasing the anchor 621 to the fully unrestrained<br>
shape. If necessary, anchor 621 may be slid toward<br>
anchor 620 along closure line 625 until sufficient<br>
compression is achieved between septum primum 105 and<br>
septum secundum 110. Any unwanted length of closure<br>
line 625 that remains unconstrained within the right<br>
atrium may be mechanically removed. Devices known in<br>
