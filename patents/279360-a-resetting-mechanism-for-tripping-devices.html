3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved resetting mechanism for tripping devices. More particularly, the invention relates to an improved resetting mechanism for resetting of mechanism in tripping devices comprising integration of components so as to avoid momentary touching of contacts thereby increasing the life of the switching device e.g. circuit breakers.<br>
The mechanism can be used where the resetting of a tripping device such as under voltage release, shunt release and equivalent tripping coils and the like are used in switching device to trip the switching device at abnormal condition.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Switching devices are widely complemented by internal accessories such as auxiliary contact, trip alarm contact, shunt release, under-voltage release etc.<br>
Function of circuit breaker is to make, carry and break the current. At normal operating conditions when the circuit breaker is carrying current, the operating knob or handle of mechanism indicates ON position. At . abnormal condition due to overload or under-voltage circuit breaker gets tripped because of the tripping signal from protective release or remotely tripping through ; the shunt release or through under-voltage release, operating handle indicates TRIP position .For switching the circuit breaker to ON<br>
2<br>
 <br>
position after any tripping event, it needs to be manually reset the operating mechanism. RESET position is slightly advanced position than OFF position of the circuit breaker.<br>
Under-voltage release is an important protection device for a circuit breaker. Apart from providing under-voltage protection, it is increasingly used for electrical interlocking. This calls for no momentary touching of contacts during changeover.<br>
US6421217 teaches circuit breaker accessory reset system which includes a trip arm biased by a spring to pivot in a clockwise direction about a trip arm pivot. A latch is arranged to pivot about a latch. To reset the trip arm and the latch, a reset lever is arranged to pivot about the latch pivot. The reset lever includes a tab portion configured for interfacing the operating mechanism, and a drive portion for interfacing the trip arm. This, when the operating mechanism is reset, a portion extending from an operating handle interfaces the tab portion to pivot the reset lever clockwise about the latch pivot.<br>
US6828886 discloses resettable circuit interrupting devices, such as GFCI devices, that include a reset lockout mechanism, an independent trip mechanism and reverse wiring protection. A conical reset plunger is notched to force a successful test before reset.<br>
None of the documents discussed , above teaches such integration and arrangement of components for resetting of mechanism of tripping device avoiding momentary touching of<br>
3<br>
 <br>
contacts under no supply condition while closing the switching device.<br>
Conventionally actuation for resetting of under-voltage release is taken from drive shaft. When circuit breaker is tried to be switched ON without under-voltage release energized, under-voltage actuator trips circuit breaker only when drive shaft moves from OFF position to the ON position resulting into momentary touching of contacts. This momentary touching of contacts leads to carry the short circuit current in the changeover circuit breaker for small duration resulting into erosion of contact buttons and hence reducing life of circuit breaker.<br>
Further these accessories have to take the actuation from the mechanism and hence have a side bias for their operation. This means that the accessories meant to be inserted in the right half of the switching device will not be workable in the left half of the switching device and vice-versa. Hence to mount these accessories one has to go through extensive preparations to avoid confusion.<br>
Thus there is a need to provide for an improved resetting mechanism comprising integration of components so as to avoid momentary touching of contacts thereby increasing the life circuit breakers.<br>
The present inventors have now found that resetting of the under voltage release and the circuit breaker can be achieved by desired integration and interconnection of components/parts thereby avoiding momentary contact touching during closing of circuit breakers under no supply condition.<br>
4<br>
 <br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
Thus the basic object of the present invention is to provide a resetting mechanism and avoiding momentary touching of contacts while closing the circuit breaker.<br>
Another object is to .provide mechanism accessories, which have no side bias and hence the efforts to ensure the specific mounting of all accessories on specific side of the switching device are eliminated.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide click fitting mechanism accessories into either half of the switching device.<br>
One more object of the present invention is to provide a compact and screw less assembly.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provide an improved resetting mechanism for circuit breaker while closing, said mechanism comprising :<br>
lever means journalled to slot of casing of the circuit breaker and operatively connected to knob of the circuit breaker in a manner to move in co-operation with said knob;<br>
resetter means in operative connection with the lever means through an interfacing means; and<br>
5<br>
 <br>
actuator means being operatively connected to the resetter means such that the actuator means receives force from the resetter means so as to get latched with latching mechanism of tripping mechanism<br>
wherein said means being integrated and interconnected so as to provide resetting of circuit breaker avoiding momentary touching of contacts of the circuit breaker.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The mechanism of the present invention comprises a lever means which is spring loaded and operatively connected to circuit breaker knob in a manner that when the knob is operated from ON to Reset position, the said spring loaded lever is being rotated taking actuation from the knob. The lever means comprises plurality of limbs which travels in a transverse direction to the axis of rotation of the lever. The limbs are held by a handle which comprises a projection means for latching and is journalled in a slot provided on the casing of the said mechanism so as to allow the lever means to complete its required rotation movement taken from the knob of the circuit breaker. The lever means is also supported by base member operatively fitted to the casing.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention describes an actuator means co-operatively linked to spring loaded lever through resetter means. The actuator means comprises rectangular body which is spring operated, where the spring may be selected from any one of single torsion spring,<br>
6<br>
 <br>
double torsion spring, leaf spring which however, do not restrict the  scope of the invention.<br>
Working :<br>
In the present invention, the actuation for resetting of under-voltage release is taken from knob. When circuit breaker is tried to be switched ON without under-voltage release being energized, under voltage actuator trips the circuit breaker before knob moves to the deadcentre position of mechanism and hence there is no rotation of drive shaft.<br>
An interfacing mechanism between the knob of the circuit breaker and resetter of under voltage release ensures latching of the mechanism of under-voltage release at OFF position of the circuit breaker.<br>
At open or no supply condition when circuit breaker knob is moved from OFF position, under voltage release actuator gets released and trips the circuit breaker before the movement of drive shaft, hence avoiding momentary contact touching.<br>
Actuation for the resetting actuator of under voltage release actuator is taken from the knob of the mechanism. A resetter assembly, which is mounted in the cover of the circuit breaker consists of partition and spring loaded resetting lever. After tripping event due to no supply at under-voltage release, when the switching device is operated from TRIP to RESET position, knob or operating handle applies force to the long arm of the resetter lever,<br>
7<br>
 <br>
which transmits that force on the other arm for resetting of actuator of under-voltage release.<br>
For keeping the device free of side bias the mounting of the accessory is provided by the accessory casing in click-fit type assembly. The casing is such that the left half is a mirror image of the right half. This symmetry is not extended t$&gt; the horizontal axis so as to avoid the reverse insertion of the accessory. Guides are provided in such a way as to make it impossible for the customer to wrongly mount the accessory thereby ensuring correct mechanical linkage without actually inspecting these linkages. The same component can be inserted into the left and the right side cavity of the device and thus side bias is avoided.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the operation of resetting mechanism of the present invention in ON position of circuit breaker knob.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the resetting mechanism of the present invention in OFF position of the circuit breaker.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an exploded isometric view of resetting mechanism of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
In figure 1 the operation of resetting mechanism of the present invention in ON position of circuit breaker knob is<br>
8<br>
 <br>
illustrated. From the figure it is realizable that when the knob (6) is operated from reset position to ON position for closing the circuit breaker through its mechanism, the spring-loaded lever (3) rotates and follows the knob operation. The lever (3) comprises limbs (7) held by handle (8) . The handle (8) comprises latching projection (10) juxtaposed to the limbs (7) so as to operatively engage with the resetter (2). As the lever (3) rotates, the spring-operated actuator (1) of under voltage release delivers the force on the resetter (2). The resetter (2) rotates and rests on the arm of the lever (3) . Simultaneously spring-operated actuator (1) comprising spring (9) operates the tripping mechanism (not shown in the figure) of the circuit breaker resulting into the' de-latching of the circuit breaker mechanism before knob 6 crosses to its deadcentre position.<br>
In figure 2 the resetting mechanism of the present invention in OFF position of the circuit breaker is illustrated. From the figure it is realizable that when the knob (6) is operated from trip position towards reset of circuit breaker to reset the circuit breaker mechanism by manually or automatically, the knob (6) applies force on the lever (3) which rotates around its own axis and delivers the force on the long arm of the resetter (2). The resetter (2), which is pivoted by pin, rotates and transmits the force on* the actuator (1) of the under voltage release. The actuator (1) moves and gets latched with the latching mechanism of under voltage release. Hence the under voltage release as well as the circuit breaker get reset.<br>
9<br>
 <br>
In figure 3 exploded isometric view of resetting mechanism of the present invention is illustrated. The mechanism of the present invention comprises spring loaded lever (3), generally pivoted in the half circular slot of casing (4) and  supported by  the  base member  (5).  The  resetting mechanism assembly is generally mounted in the cover (not shown in the figure) of the circuit breaker. The resetter (2)  is pivoted by the pin in the casing of the under voltage release, which latches the spring operated actuator (1) of the under voltage release. The under voltage release includes  the  latching  mechanism  connected  to  the electromagnetic coil plunger. The knob (6) is connected to the mechanism of the circuit breaker (not shown in figure). The circuit breaker mechanism operates as per the knob operation.<br>
The invention has been described in a preferred form only and many variations may be made in the invention which will still be comprised within its spirit. The invention is not limited to the details cited above. The spring loaded lever, spring operated actuator does not limit the scope of the present invention. The structure thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, all the details may furthermore be replaced with elements having technical equivalence. In practice the materials and dimensions may be any according to the requirements, which will still be comprised within its true spirit.<br>
