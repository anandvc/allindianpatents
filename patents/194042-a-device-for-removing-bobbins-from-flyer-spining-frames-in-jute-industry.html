				<td>The present invention relates to a device for removing bobbins from flyer spinning frames in jute industry.<br>
The invention relates to a device for serially removing wound bobbins out of the spindles of the flyer spinning frames and to collect them in a basket.<br>
In jute spinning, out of various types of works involved, one is bobbin shifting work where the bobbin shifter lift the full bobbins from spinning frame one after another, put them in trolleys, collect empty bobbins from trolleys and set them again on the spindles. In this cycle all the operations are done manually.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a mechanised system in which a device for removing bobbins will reduce workload of the operator and thereby increase the productivity of jute spinning. This device when fitted on a flyer spinning frame can lift the complete series of wound bobbins serially from flyer spinning frame by simply pushing the device along the bobbin line.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided :<br>
A device for removing bobbin from flyer spinning frame in jute industry wherein a carriage comprises:<br>
a pair of parallel guide plates, with a gap inbetween, for lifting bobbins out of the spindles ;<br>
said guide plates are fitted to two parallel side walls;<br>
under surface of the said carriage is provided with rollers and a handle attached to the shaft of the roller for moving the said carriage over rails which is provided in the flyer spinning frame; and<br>
2<br><br>
a basket for collecting the bobbins.<br>
The invention is now described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings where like reference numerals always indicate the same parts throughout the description of the drawings, in which :<br>
Fig.l shows schematically the present invented device for removing bobbin used in a jute thread spinning frame.<br>
Fig.2 shows schematically plan view of the device for removing bobbin in the direction 'X' of Fig.l.<br>
Fig.3 shows schematically in an enlarged manner the device for removing bobbin showing how the bobbin is being lifted.<br>
Fig.4 shows a normal bobbin.<br>
Fig.5 shows the modified bobbin to be used along with the present invented bobbin removing device.<br>
Fig.6 shows schematically the mechanism for lifting and collecting bobbins.<br>
Referring to Fig.l where a series of bobbins 2 are shown in its side view in a standard jute thread spinning frame where a fixed side member 1 is shown schemetically which holds vertically series of vertical splindles 4 for vertically mounting of bobbins 2. Here the bobbins 2 are shown after completion of winding of jute thread 3 on bobbin 2. In present jute spinning system after completion of winding of the jute thread 3 on bobbins 2, the bobbins 2 are manually removed out of the spindle 4 and then stored in a container. This removing of bobbins are done by operator, called bobbin shifter, whose main duty is to remove the full bobbins 2, collect them into moving trolleys and<br>
3<br><br>
again collect empty bobbins from moving trolleys and to set them on the spindle 4. In jute spinning machine number of such bobbins are very large. The present invention has mechanised a part of these manual operations and thereby saving a substantial amount of time and labour.<br>
Referring to Figs.2, 3 and 6, the invented device for removing bobbins consists of a to and fro carriage 5 moving along the fixed spinning member 1. The carriage 5 consists of a pair of inclined guide plates 6 arranged vertically to the carriage. This guide plates 6 are preferably arranged at an inclination of 30 deg. to the base and are situated inside a pair of vertical parallel guard walls 8(Fig.6). With the forward movement of the carriage the guide plate 6 causes gradual upward movement of the bobbins. The gradual upward movement of the bobbins are caused by the inclination of the guide plate 6. A pair of said inclined guide plates 6 are parallely arranged in the carriage 5 leaving a gap 9 inbetween the guide plates 6. This gap 9 allow the empty spindles 4 to pass through the carriage walls 8 while the bobbins 2 are removed from these spindle 4 as shown in figs.l and 3. The bottom of the carriage 5 is provided with wheels 10 which can run on rail 11 to be arranged in the standard spinning frame 1 where the device for removing bobbins is intended to be used. The fitting of the rail 11 is not shown in detail as it can be conveniently arranged by persons skilled in the present art of engineering. The carriage 5 is pushed forward and backward by a handle 12 attached to the shaft of the wheel 10 or at any other convenient position of the carriage 5. In its simple construction the upper<br>
4<br><br>
end of the inclined paralled guide plates 6 terminate over a collecting basket 13 as shown in fig.6 or with a channel 14 for movement of the bobbins which terminate over a remote basket (not shown here).<br>
Where the present invented bobbin lifting device 5 is used, the existing bobbin needs to be replaced by the newly modified bobbins 2. The existing bobbin is shown in fig.4 while the modified bobbin is shown in fig.5. In the existing bobbin, its bottom flange is devoid of any special shape or profile. But according to present invention, the lower most surface of the bottom flange 2A of the bobbin 2 is provided with bevelled parameter 2B having an angle identical with the inclination of the guide plates 6 for smooth gliding of the guide plates 6 along the bottom faces of the bottom flange 2A resulting smooth upward gliding movement of the bobbins 2 along the spindle 4. Inclined guide plates 6 thereby remove the bobbins 2 from the spindle serially.<br>
Mode of Operation :<br>
When the winding of the bobbins 2 are completed in a flyer spinning frame 1, the present invented device for removing bobbins is mounted over the rail 11 at its necessary starting point of the spinning frame 1. The carriage 5 is then pushed toward the serially arranged wound bobbins 2, with the help of its handle 12. When the said two parallel guide plates 6, is pushed underneath the bevelled bottom flange 2B of the bobbin 2, the bobbin 2 glides on the guide plates 6. It goes up over its spindle 4 till it leaves the spindle 4 as shown in position<br>
5<br><br>
marked 'pp' in fig.1. Once removed from the spindle 4, the bobbin glides through a channel 14(fig.l) proceeding towards a collecting basket 13 with the continuous push of successive bobbins 2 leaving their spindles 4 one after the other till it reaches the last bobbin of the frame 1. So with the forward movement of the carriage 5 the bobbins 2 are gradually lifted out of their spindles 4 and are finally collected inside a basket 13. The empty spindles 4 moves though the gap of the two inclined guide plates 6 passing freely through the central opening 9 of the carriage 5. Two side walls prevent falling of the bobbins out of the carriage 5. After working in one machine, the device is taken to another machine for such operation. So the device can be used in a number of spinning frame.<br>
The present invented device can be used to any kind of slip draft sliver spinning frame used in jute, flax and similar fibres.<br>
It is to be noted that the construction of the device, its arrangement and details may be modified in order to obtain the same result without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
