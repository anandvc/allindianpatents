Background of the invention<br>
The present invention concerns a disposable capsule for preparing a beverage<br>
from a food product housed therein and a method for opening such capsule, and<br>
generally to a disposable capsule containing for example powder or ground<br>
products intended for the preparation of beverages such as coffee, tea or the like<br>
in dispensing machines. The invention also concerns a method for opening said<br>
capsule.<br>
For the sake of clarity, in the following description reference will be<br>
explicitly made to the specific manufacturing of containers shaped as disposable<br>
capsules for the preparation of beverages, being understood that the principles of<br>
the present invention may be applied to any type of sealed containers for<br>
foodstuff which has to be opened in order to release its contents, or to allow the<br>
mixing with other products or substances, before or during the evacuation of the<br>
contents from the same container.<br>
Description of the known art<br>
For instance, the European patent application EP 1440910 concerns a disposable<br>
capsule for the preparation of beverages starting from a food product containing<br>
liquid or powder milk, or containing roasted or ground coffee, tea, etc..<br>
Currently, the disposable capsules available for the preparation of<br>
beverages are obtained from plastic materials, such as polyolefins (e.g.<br>
polypropylene and polyethylene and/or copolymers thereof) or laminated films of<br>
polyolefins and aluminium suitable for use in the food field. US 4646626<br>
(Tuttoespresso) discloses capsules from a plastic material provided with one or<br>
more holes, obtained on the lid, to allow the inflow of pressurized water during<br>
their use. The beverage exits the capsule through an opening in the bottom and an<br><br>
underlying collector. Because of the holes, in order to avoid the oxidation and the<br>
deterioration of the organoleptic characteristics of the product, capsules are<br>
distributed in sealed packages, as for example the so called "blisters".<br>
Thus, the capsule is hermetically packaged between a pre-formed tray<br>
from a plastic material and a foil made from plastic or aluminium. The latter must<br>
be removed to allow its use in the dispensing machine.<br>
This solution is not suitable for the use with automatic beverage<br>
dispensing machines. In fact, once the capsules are removed from their hermetic<br>
package and loaded in the automatic machine, they are no longer sealed and the<br>
product (for instance ground coffee) might deteriorate as above described.<br>
Also, disposable capsules are known intended to be perforated at the time<br>
of their use. However, perforation of the capsule when it is used is operated by<br>
one or more lances, or piercing elements, which penetrate the capsule from the outside to the inside. Breaking of the container walls, or then perforation, may<br>
cause the release of particles of the same capsule that fall inside the container,<br>
mixing with the food product. As a consequence, the dispensed beverage may<br>
also be disagreeable and have a poorly appetizing aspect, or worst, may contain<br>
extraneous parts.<br>
For example, US 5656316 (Nestec) concerns a disposable capsule for<br>
beverages whose upper wall can be perforated by a conduct for feeding of<br>
pressurized water inside the capsule. A collector of the beverage is located under<br>
the capsule bottom wall, which breaks upon deformation under an increase in the<br>
internal pressure of the capsule, thus allowing for the obtained beverage to exit.<br>
In this embodiment means for the capsule opening are provided on the beverage<br>
dispensing machine, having the disadvantage of contacting the beverage, with<br>
resulting cross-contamination problems when capsules for different beverages are<br>
utilized.<br><br>
A further example of a system for opening the capsule through mobile<br>
lances or piercing elements is the one related to the capsule described in the<br>
international patent application WO 2004/026091 (Kraft).<br>
Patent application WO 02/081337 (Tuttoespresso) concerns a capsule<br>
sealed at its upper part by a perforable wall. Perforation of the wall is operated by<br>
a piston movable inside the capsule. As shown in figures 4 and 5 of application<br>
WO 02/081337, the movable piston is pushed toward the upper wall of the<br>
capsule by the external piercing element which penetrates through the bottom of<br>
the capsule. The drawback of such embodiment is that it requires the presence of<br>
a movable element, with resulting production and assembling costs.<br>
Therefore, there is the need for a sealed capsule to be provided, containing<br>
product for the preparation of beverages, which is cheap and easy to manufacture,<br>
which can be used with both automatic dispensing machines, and with hand-<br>
loaded machines, which does not require changes in the structure of the same<br>
machines and which allows known capsules, e.g those packed in blisters, to be<br>
used.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a disposable sealed<br>
capsule for beverages and foodstuff which overcomes, in a simply and effective<br>
. way, the drawbacks of the known technique, being at the same time cheap to<br>
manufacture and simple to use.<br>
Within this scope, an object of the present invention is to provide a capsule<br>
which allows for its opening exclusively when it is used, the beverage or<br>
foodstuff dispensing and the capsule opening being carried out at the same time.<br><br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a disposable capsule<br>
which is suitable to be sealed in a. controlled atmosphere, or vacuum-packed,<br>
without using further capsule packages for preserving the organoleptic properties<br>
of the beverage.<br>
It is a further object of. the present invention to provide a method and a<br>
disposable capsule which permit to prevent, or however, to limit as much as<br>
possible, the eventual release of capsule particles during its opening.<br>
These and other objects are achieved by the present invention which<br>
concerns a disposable capsule for preparing a beverage from a food product<br>
housed therein, comprising: a plurality of walls, means for dispensing said<br>
beverage, means for supplying a fluid inside the capsule, a film for isolating said<br>
supplying means from the external environment and means for perforating said<br>
film, characterized in that said means for supplying a fluid comprise a plurality of<br>
through holes, in that said means for perforating said film are fixed with respect<br>
to the capsule and comprise cutting surfaces or projections, fixed to a portion of<br>
the capsule, which by contacting the said film operate its perforation and in that at<br>
least a portion of the film is movable between a rest position and a position where<br>
it engages said means for its perforation.<br>
The invention also concerns a method for opening the aforesaid capsule<br>
for the preparation of a beverage from a food product housed therein, said capsule<br>
comprising: a plurality of walls, means for dispensing said beverage, means for<br>
supplying a fluid inside the capsule, said means for supplying a fluid including a<br>
plurality of through holes and also being provided with a film (4) for isolating<br>
said supplying means from the external environment and with means for<br>
perforating said' film that are fixed with respect to the capsule and comprise<br>
cutting surfaces or projections, fixed to a portion of the capsule, characterized by<br><br>
comprising the step of bringing said film in contact with at least a part of said<br>
perforation means for its perforation.<br>
As described in detail in the following description, the means for<br>
perforating the capsule operate the perforation of the film when this deforms<br>
under the force of an external pressure, for example the pressure exerted by the<br>
pressurized hot water directed toward the capsule, and its film, for the beverage<br>
preparation.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the means<br>
for perforating the film are provided on the capsule wall, preferably the upper<br>
wall, which is located adjacent and underlying the film which seals the capsule.<br>
Preferably the means for the perforation of the film are fixed and bonded<br>
with respect to the capsule and, for instance, comprise one or more cutting<br>
projections. The cutting projections may be integral with a surface of the capsule<br>
and may have different shapes. For example they may be sharp cusps or wedges,<br>
and also they may have a generally pyramidal shape.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the film is<br>
externally provided and covers the whole upper wall of the capsule, so to<br>
hermetically seal it, and the cutting projections are cusps located on the upper<br>
surface of the same wall, directed toward the film. The cusps are preferably<br>
located in correspondence of through holes provided in the upper wall of the<br>
capsule to supply pressurized water inside the capsule, where the food product,<br>
e.g coffee powder, is housed.<br>
The capsule according to the invention has numerous advantages over<br>
prior art. In fact, the film which seals the capsule of the invention is perforable at<br>
the time of the actual use of the capsule by perforation means which are fixed to<br><br>
the capsule. Thus, differently from what provided for the known capsules, the<br>
film has not to be manually separated from the capsule before its use and has not<br>
. to be perforated by means provided on the machines loaded with the capsule (as<br>
in the capsule according to US 5656316). The capsule according to the invention<br>
is thus simple to pack and to use, and also guarantees high quality standards for<br>
the contained foodstuff which keeps unaltered for a long time, in an optimal<br>
conservation state, the organoleptic characteristics.<br>
With respect to the embodiment according to application WO 02/081337<br>
the capsule according to the present invention has a simplified structure, because<br>
the surfaces for the perforation of the film are fixed, and permits to perfectly<br>
isolate the food product from the external environment, while, resulting<br>
inexpensive.<br>
It will be clear to the skilled person that the capsule of the invention is<br>
particularly suitable for the use with machines for the preparation of coffee or<br>
beverages. In fact the film of the capsule can be moved toward the cutting<br>
projections by the pressurized water supplied by such machines for dispensing the<br>
beverages. Thus the film breaks only when the capsule is actually used, allowing<br>
the water to enter the capsule itself.<br>
Traditional capsules have another drawback. The amount of product to be<br>
housed inside the capsule depends on the type of the beverage to supply. For<br>
example, capsules used for soluble beverages generally contain up to about 20",<br>
grams soluble powder, while the capsules used for dispensing coffee generally<br>
contain up to about 10 grams of powder coffee. Consequently, the volume of the<br>
capsule has to be adapted, during the design, to the different uses which the<br>
capsule is intended for. Typically,, the capsules for the soluble beverages have<br>
greater dimensions than the corresponding dimensions of the capsules for coffee,<br>
for example the height of the capsule for soluble beverages may be greater than<br><br>
the height of the-capsules for coffee. Thus also the machines provided for<br>
dispensing the beverages have to be designed in such a way to be compatible with<br>
the different available capsules.<br>
Therefore the need is felt to provide capsules having sizes standardized as<br>
much as possible. It is required to provide capsules, having a given-size, which<br>
can be utilized for the soluble beverages and for the coffee indifferently, or more<br>
generally, to provide capsules which can be utilized indifferently for dispensing<br>
beverages also in the case that the amount of the dose to be encapsulated differs<br>
between the various cases.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a capsule for the<br>
preparation of different beverages (or other similar foodstuff), compatible with<br>
automatic or hand-loaded dispensing machines, which allows for the<br>
encapsulation of different product doses in its inside, each dose with the suitable<br>
compactness grade depending on the kind of beverage to be dispensed, with no<br>
need for changing the external dimensions of the capsule.<br>
This object is achieved by way of the disposable capsule according to the<br>
present invention for the preparation of a beverage from a food product housed<br>
therein, which capsule comprises a plurality of walls and means for dispensing the beverage, characterized in that it comprises at least an element for the<br>
partition of the internal volume of the capsule in two or more volumes for<br>
housing at least said food product, said partition element being fixed with respect<br>
to the capsule.<br>
The volumes of the capsule may contain one or more food products, each<br>
in its optimal configuration, for example coffee powder with the right grounding<br>
grade and with the suitable compression.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, the partition element can<br><br>
be housed internally to the capsule, for example secured or snap-engaged,<br>
preferably in correspondence of its lower portion.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the partition element is a<br>
disc or a substantially cylindrical spacer intended to support the food product<br>
between its upper wall and the upper wall of the capsule. In other words, the disc<br>
- or the spacer - works as a double bottom for the capsule. In this case the upper<br>
wall of the spacer is" in fluid communication with the lower wall of the capsule<br>
(for example it is bored), in order to have the beverage prepared with the food<br>
product housed in the upper volume of the capsule to flow into the lower volume<br>
and then trough the opening for dispensing the beverage.<br>
According to an embodiment, when the food product is for example<br>
ground coffee, the upper wall of the spacer is provided with a filter in order to<br>
block the solid portion of the beverage during its distribution.<br>
The partition element may be snap-coupled to the lower portion of the<br>
capsule or it can be welded to the same. It is important that it reduces and/or<br>
divides the internal volume of the capsule without modifying the functioning<br>
thereof, thus permitting the normal beverage supply.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the capsule provided<br>
with the partition element contains different products for a beverage into different<br>
volumes or chambers defined by the partition element inside the capsule. For<br>
example coffee may be housed in the upper chamber and powder (or liquid) milk<br>
into the lower chamber.<br>
The capsule of the invention is particularly advantageous since it can be<br>
used indifferently for the preparation of soluble beverages or for the preparation<br>
of coffee from ground powder. In the first case, in fact, the capsule is not<br><br>
provided with the spacer and the internal volume of the capsule is the maximum.<br>
In the second case the spacer is inserted into the capsule before this is filled with<br>
the coffee powder, and the internal volume of the capsule is thus divided in a<br>
lower volume and in an upper volume, for example the upper volume is reduced<br>
of the amount necessary to house a lower dose of food product, maintaining at the<br>
same time the desired compactness grade. In this way it is possible to use the<br>
same capsule, having fixed outer size, i.e. without requiring two different<br>
capsules to be provided, having different sizes, each of which is for the<br>
preparation of a beverage of one type.<br>
By changing the size of the spacer, and thus the partition of the capsule<br>
internal volume, it is possible to house an amount of food product with the compactness grade which meets the user's taste. In other words, the beverage<br>
prepared from the capsule may be more or less diluted also depending on how<br>
compacted is the encapsulated product.<br>
The partition element according to the invention thus allows to adjust such<br>
compactness grade in order to dispense more or less diluted beverages, as for<br>
example required in different States.<br>
For these reasons the partition element has predefined dimensions, i.e. it is<br>
calibrated to provide the partition of the capsule volume depending on the quality<br>
and the amount of the beverage requested by the user according to his taste. The<br>
volume dividing element, or partition element, should be resistant to the pressure<br>
exerted by the water and the food product during the preparation of the beverage,<br>
without being subject to deformations which might cause an undesired bypass of<br>
solid product to the outside of the same element and the filter, along the capsule<br>
walls. For this reason the partition element is preferably designed to have a<br>
structure optimized to support the different pressures which generate in the<br>
capsule depending on the different amounts and groundings of the contained<br><br>
product and on the different supplying pressure of the water. In fact different<br>
dispensing pressures are often provided in various Countries, as well as different product amounts, which product also has its predefined particle size. For<br>
example, the spacer may be designed to resist to pressures in the range from ,1,5<br>
bar to 20 bar, more frequently from 3 bar to 15 bar, so to allow a filter element<br>
(coupled to the same spacer or provided into it) to operate without, being<br>
deformed.<br>

Description of the invention embodiment<br>
Figure 1 shows a capsule C according to the invention, comprising a container 1,<br>
an upper wall 2 suitable to close the container 1 and a film 4. The upper wall 2<br>
together with the film 4 hermetically close the assembled capsule C. For instance,<br>
the wall 2 may be welded to the container 1 through ultrasound welding. The film<br>
4 is fixed, for example is thermo-welded, to the container 1 coupled to the wall 2,<br>
for example by thermo-welding the film 4 on a peripheral circular area of the wall<br>
2. The capsule C may contain different food products 3. For example the capsule<br>
C of figures 1 and 2-2C is suitable for the preparation of beverages from fresh<br>
ground products, e.g. coffee or the like, while the capsule shown in the figures<br>
3A-3C can be used for the preparation of beverages from soluble products.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figure 1 the encapsulated product is coffee<br>
powder 3, compressed in the container 1 to a predefined compactness grade,<br>
known in the art. The film 4 is coupled to the upper wall 2, in order to seal it from<br>
the external atmosphere. In fact the upper wall 2 is provided with a plurality of<br>
holes 5 which set in fluid communication the upper surface of the same wall 2<br>
with the internal volume of the container 1, and thus with the coffee powder.<br>
Thus holes 5 allow the pressurized water supplied by the pump to enter the<br>
assembled capsule upon it has passed through the film 4. Thus the task of the<br><br>
latter is to seal the capsule C until it is used, preventing the product 3 from being<br>
exposed to the air through the holes 5 of the wall 2, thus deteriorating or loosing<br>
its characteristics.<br>
Advantageously, and contrary to the known capsules, capsule C is<br>
provided with its own means of perforating the film 4. As described in detail in<br>
the following, this feature allows to use capsule C with the traditional coffee<br>
dispensing machines (i.e. without having to customize the same), according to<br>
well known procedures, and to open it when the water is supplied to the capsule<br>
C for dispensing the beverage.<br>
The means of perforating the film 4 preferably comprise a plurality of<br>
cutting surfaces or projections, fixed to a portion of the capsule C, which by<br>
contacting the same film 4 operate its partial breaking, for instance through<br>
perforation or tearing. The contact between the film 4 and the cutting surfaces is<br>
preferably provided upon a deformation of the same film 4.<br>
In the embodiment shown in the figure 1, the cutting surfaces comprise a<br>
plurality of cusps 6, projecting from the upper surface 7 of the wall 2, directed<br>
toward the film 4. As shown in detail in the figures 2A-2C, the film 4 extends<br>
over the cusps 6, at a small distance from them, in such a way that a slight<br>
bending of the same film 4 in the direction of the arrow D leads the film 4 into<br>
contact with the cusps 6, causing the perforation of the film.<br>
The number and the arrangement of the cusps 6 may vary depending on<br>
the needs. In the case shown in the figures 1-2C, the cusps 6 are eighteen,<br>
arranged in two concentric circular series (figure 2A). However, the cusps 6 may<br>
be a different number and may provide different arrangements, star like, triangle<br>
like, asterisk like, etc.<br><br>
The capsule C provides that the pressurized water flow, impinging the film<br>
4, causes its bending in the direction of the arrow D (fig. 2), so to bring the film 4<br>
into contact with the perforation element 6 which tears the film.. In particular, the<br>
distance between the film 4 and the cutting surfaces of the cusps, or of other<br>
means for perforating or tearing, must be smaller than the deflection displacement<br>
of the deformed film in all the provided working conditions. In other words, when<br>
the film is subject to the pressure of the water supplied by the pump of the<br>
dispensing machine, in normal working conditions of the same, it is deformed of<br>
. an amount sufficient to bring it into contact with the aforesaid cutting surfaces.<br>
In other words, the invention provides that the capsule G is used in a<br>
beverage dispensing machine and that the water supplied by the machine to the<br>
capsule C breaks the film 4. In this way the entirety of the contents 3 of the<br>
capsule C is guaranteed until the time of its effective usage.<br>
The holes 5 are distributed in a known way on the surface 7 of the wall 2<br>
so to facilitate both the water flowing to the inside of the capsule C and the<br>
preparation of the product. As it will be clear from the following, in the case of<br>
ground coffee (figures 1-2C) the holes are distributed in a way to guarantee a<br>
uniform contact coffee-water, while in the case of soluble coffee the preferential<br>
arrangement provides two holes.<br>
Furthermore, the arrangement of the holes 5 in the wall 2 should optimize<br>
the turbulent flow of the water flowing inside the capsule C. It is desirable for the<br>
water entering the capsule C to reach the entire product 3 before flowing to the<br>
outside leaving the capsule C. The holes 5 are arranged according to the shown<br>
configuration which exactly optimizes the water flow into the capsule C.<br>
Preferably the holes 5 are slanting with respect to the direction D (feature not<br>
shown) in order to direct the water - entering the capsule C - according to a<br>
direction as much as possible horizontal (i.e. oblique with respect to the direction<br><br>
D). In other words it is desired for the water to enter the container 1 generating a<br>
vortex.<br>
Preferably, the cusps 6 are located close to the holes 5 for the passage of<br>
the water. In this way the film 4, once lacerated, is prevented from adhering the<br>
upper wall 4 in correspondence of one of the holes 5 thus blocking or reducing in the water flow through the same. In the embodiment of figures 1-2C, the holes 5<br>
are alternate with respect to the cusps 6 in the two concentric series. Preferably,<br>
the distance between the centre of a hole 5 and the base of a cusp 6' is less than 10<br>
mm, more preferably such distance is included in the range 0.01 mm - 3 mm.<br>
Preferably, the cusps 6 according to the shown embodiment have a star-<br>
like shaped cross section, with a triangular shaped contour in vertical section.<br>
This shape has proved particularly effective since the film 4, perforated by the<br>
cusps 6 with circular holes, does not adhere to the external surface of the cusp 6,<br>
and passages remain between the film 4 and the cusps 6, sufficient to allow the<br>
water flow to penetrate under the film 4. The cusps 6 may be obtained with other<br>
shapes, different from the shown one. For instance, the cusps 6 may have a jigsaw<br>
tooth shape, and thus may tilt with respect to direction D, with a pyramidal shape,<br>
etc.<br>
In this way the film 4, when perforated by a cusp 6, is prevented from<br>
fitting or adhering on the same cusp 6, which would prevent the water flow from<br>
reaching the gap between film 4 and upper surface 7 of the wall 2 and entering<br>
only the capsule the capsule C. The shape of the cusps 6, as above exemplified,<br>
must permit the passage of the water at least in the direction of the closest hole 5.<br>
In other words, once the film 4 has been perforated by a cusp 6 because of the<br>
water flow impinging the same film 4, the water should pass in the opening<br>
provided on the film 4 and, flowing on the cusp 6," direct toward a hole 5. .<br><br>
The film 4 can be a traditional type one, for example a film utilized in the<br>
food field for sealing packages. Clearly, film 4 must have good mechanical<br>
characteristics in order to resist to undesired ruptures, but at the same time it must<br>
be sufficiently flexible in order to be deformed by a fluid flow which impinges on<br>
it. Moreover, the film has to be rapidly and easily perforable when contact with<br>
the cusps 6 starts. In the shown embodiment the film 4 is of a multilayer type,<br>
made of a plurality of coupled films, among which an aluminum film and one or<br>
more plastic films may be provided, possibly reporting the manufacturer's data<br>
and/or the data concerning the product 3.<br>
Figure 4 shows a capsule C assembled and ready to be used in beverage<br>
dispensing machine. As previously described, once the capsule C has been loaded<br>
in the machine, the opening of the capsule C in correspondence of its upper<br>
portion is operated by the water flow supplied by the machine on the film 4. The<br>
water flows between the film 4 and the surface 7 and through holes 5 into capsule<br>
C, where the coffee powder is. The opening of the lower portion 8 is achieved<br>
through the rupture of the frangible mobile element or trap 9 operated by a<br>
piercing element (or collector) of the same machine or by the increasing of the<br>
internal pressure in the capsule C due to the water entering the same.<br>
Preferably, the trap 9 has the square shape shown in the figures 1 and.4.<br>
This means that the shape delineated by the breaking lines 10 - which define the<br>
trap 9 - is generally square or "window" like (with two wings), that is the trap<br>
may be torn in two halves which open as a wing. In this case the portion of the<br>
piercing element intended to break the trap 9 preferably has a circular section, as<br>
schematically shown in figure 10, with a diameter having length lower than, or<br>
equal to, the side 10 of the trap 9. During the perforation of the trap 9, this<br>
configuration provides gaps 12 which permit the coffee to flow outside from the<br>
capsule C.<br><br>
The figures 3A-3C show the upper wall 20 of a capsule C according to the<br>
present invention, designed for soluble beverages. As known, capsules used for<br>
the preparation of soluble beverages (chocolate, tea, white coffee, etc.) contain a<br>
greater amount of product 3 than the correspondent capsules for the coffee (for<br>
example up to 20 grams of soluble powder versus about 8 grams of ground<br>
coffee). In order to obtain an optimal solubilization, even if the upper wall 20 is<br>
sealed by way of the film 4 which - as in the case of the figures 1-2C - adheres to<br>
the edges 21, the number and the arrangement of the holes 25 and cusps 26 are<br>
different with respect to the correspondent holes 5 and cusps 6 of the wall 2. The<br>
position of the holes 25 on the wall 20 is as much as possible peripheral in order<br>
to supply the water to the encapsulated product 3 in its entirety. Two cusps 26 are<br>
provided in correspondence of the holes 25 for perforating the film 4.<br>
Figures 7-9 show further embodiments of the capsule C. In the above<br>
discussed cases, the cusps 6, 26 are integral to the upper wall 2, 20 of the capsule<br>
C under the film 4. Instead, capsules C of figures 7-9 are provided with cusps 36,<br>
37 internally to each capsule.<br>
In the capsule C of figure 7 a cusp 36 is fixed to the dispensing trap 9 and<br>
is mobile with the same. In the figures 8 and 9 the cusps extend from the walls of<br>
the capsule.<br>
The capsules C shown in the figures 7-9 locking the upper wall 2, which<br>
functions are performed by the film 4. The cusps 36 may be integral with the<br>
bottom 8 of the container 1 or even better with the internal walls of the same (as<br>
shown in the figure 8). Alternatively, as shown in the figure 9, the cusps 37 may<br>
be fixed to the internal surfaces la, lb of the capsule C, which are intermediate<br>
with respect to the bottom 8 and the upper wall 2. The ends of the cusps 36 and<br>
37 are closed to film 4, at a distance suitable for operating the perforation of the<br>
deformed film 4. What is important is that the cusps 36 or 37 perforate the film 4<br><br>
when this contacts the same cusps. In the case shown in figure 7, perforation of<br>
the film 4 occurs when the cusp 36 - pushed upwardly together the trap by the<br>
piercing element (see fig. 3) - perforates the film 4.<br>
The film 4, as shown, seals the entire extension of the upper surface 7, 27<br>
of the wall 2, 20. Capsule C may also provide a wall 2, 20 having a different<br>
shape from the shown one, wherein the film 4 covers only a part of the surface 7,<br>
27 or separate portions of the same.<br>
Figures 5-6D show a capsule C provided with a partition element having<br>
the function of dividing, or partitioning, its internal volume. The partition element<br>
may have different shapes and dimensions depending on the specific uses which<br>
the capsule C is intended to.<br>
In figure 6, the partition element is constituted by a spacer 40 having a<br>
predefined height extension, in such a way that once inserted in the container 1,<br>
the internal volume of the container left available to the product 3 is reduced to<br>
the room 62 included between the upper surface 41 of the spacer 40 and the upper<br>
surface 7 of the capsule C<br>
With evident economic advantages, the spacer 40 allows the capsule C to<br>
be used both for the preparation of the coffee and for the preparation of soluble<br>
beverages. In the first case (coffee), the capsule C is coupled to the spacer 40, in<br>
the second case the capsule C has no spacer 40 and the internal volume of the<br>
container 1 may be completely filled with the product 3.<br>
Thus, spacer 40 may be inserted in the container 1 at the time of the filling<br>
of the capsule C with the product 3. If the amount of product 3 is for example not<br>
greater than 10 grams, the spacer 40 is inserted in the container 1 and works as a<br>
double bottom for the capsule C. If the product is soluble, the container 1 does<br><br>
In this way it is possible to standardize the external dimensions of the<br>
capsule C, and vary the internal ones depending on the needs. It has to be noticed<br>
that the element for dividing the volume of the capsule may be provided also in<br>
the traditional capsules, i.e. independently by the provided means for the opening<br>
of the capsule.<br>
Advantageously, the spacer 40 permits to encapsulate the product 3<br>
according to the most opportune load and/or the compactness grade. In fact the<br>
reduction of the convenient volume of the capsule C may be designed to obtain<br>
the desired compactness grade for the product 3 in the capsule C.<br>
The figures 1 and 5 show a capsule C provided with a spacer 40 and with<br>
opening means of the above mentioned type. A paper filter, or another approved<br>
material for foodstuff, is interposed between the spacer 40 and the product 3, in<br>
order to stop any powder 3 which has not solubilized during the preparation of<br>
the related beverage. Another filter may be interposed between the product 3 and<br>
the upper wall of the capsule C.<br>
In order to facilitate dispensing of the beverage prepared with the product<br>
3, the spacer 40 is provided with a set of holes 42 in correspondence of the wall<br>
41.<br>
The figure 6A shows a capsule C according to the invention and a<br>
piercing-collector element 50 having the function to perforate the trap 9 and<br>
direct the beverage dispensed by the capsule C. With respect to the embodiment<br>
shown in the figure 6, the capsule C of figure 6A is provided with a container 1<br>
having a narrowing 51 which forms a step suitable to support an element for<br>
dividing the capsule volume which is constituted by a disc 52. Practically, the<br><br>
narrowing 51 is a base internal to the container 1 on which the disc or septum 52<br>
lays. This last has a height lower than the one of the spacer 40 and is not provided<br>
with leg portions which abut the bottom of container 1 (figure 6B). As one can<br>
see in figure 6B, during the usage of the capsule C, the piercer-collector 50<br>
partially houses the same capsule and helps to avoid its deformation. A filter 53 is<br>
provided between the disc or septum 52 and the food product 3.<br>
The figures 6C and 6D show a further embodiment according to the<br>
invention. The element for the partitioning of the serviceable volume of the<br>
capsule C in this case is a disk 54 which abuts the base 51. It is important to<br>
notice that the distance between the base 51 and the bottom of the capsule is<br>
constant for the different embodiments of the figures 6A and 6C, while the height<br>
of the element 52, 54 for the reduction of the volume varies. The reduction of the<br>
volume for' housing product 3 is thus adjusted by varying the height of the used<br>
element 40, 52 or 54, while the travel range of the piercing element within the<br>
capsule C is constant.<br>
Summarizing, the element for partitioning/reducing the volume of the<br>
capsule may have the shape of the spacer 40 which - as shown has a cylindrical<br>
shape, is substantially hollow and abuts the bottom of the capsule. Alternatively,<br>
such partitioning element may have the shape of a disk or a septum (52 or 54) and<br>
may stand on a base 51 provided on the capsule wall. However, other shapes are<br>
possible. It is sufficient that the partition element 40, 52 or 54 is fixed to<br>
container 1, for example by way of a fit coupling or welding, and allows the<br>
passage of the beverage toward the trap 9. In order to avoid possible interferences<br>
between the trap and the partition element, the capsule is preferably provided<br>
with the trap 9, having two halves which open by departing one from the other. In<br>
fact the. "double wing" like opening of the trap 9 minimizes the risks that<br>
interferences generate between the two halves of the trap 9 (the wings) pushed by<br>
the piercing element inside the capsule C and the element 40, 52, 54 provided<br><br>
within the capsule C. In fact a single wing trap 9, once it has been opened, may<br>
contact the lower wall of the spacer or disk, thus interfering with the proper<br>
beverage dispensing, for example preventing part of the foam formed by the<br>
infusion of the product 3 inside the capsule to exit.<br>
As above mentioned, the trap 9 has a square or quadrilateral shape in<br>
combination with a circular shape of the section of the piercing element 50A, in<br>
order to obtain a plurality of gaps for the beverage exit in correspondence of the<br>
trap vertices. In this way the presence of foam is increased in the dispensed<br>
product.<br>
Alternatively to trap 9, the capsule C according to the present invention<br>
may be provided with an opening sealed by a film which is perforable by the<br>
piercing element. For example an opening, having equal dimensions of the trap 9,<br>
is provided on the bottom of the container 1 and sealed is a film perforable by the<br>
piercer-collector 50 or by an equivalent element. This solution, in fact, prevents<br>
an interference from generating between parts of the capsule C and the lower wall<br>
of the element 40, 52 or 54 for the volume reduction.<br>
The spacer 40 is preferably provided with a supporting surface 45 suitable<br>
to contact the piercing element 50A. The supporting surface, for example a rise or<br>
a shim, permits the piercing element 50A to abut the spacer, and to support the<br>
same during the beverage dispensing and avoiding harmful "swellings", i.e.<br>
deformations toward the capsule C bottom due to the force exerted by the internal<br>
pressure during the dispensing of the beverage. In other words, the support<br>
provided by the piercing element 50A of the collector 50 improves the resistance<br>
of the capsule C to the deformations caused by the increase of the internal<br>
pressure, which deformations may cause the passage of powder around the<br>
capsule filter. Because of the length of the piercing element 50A being constant,<br>
the thickness of the supporting surface 45 may be greater or smaller depending on<br><br>
the distance between the disk 52 or 54 and the capsule bottom, in such a way that<br>
the surface 45 is always substantially abutting the piercing element 50A: for<br>
example, in the figures 6A and 6B the thickness of the supporting surface 45 is<br>
greater than the one of the embodiment of figures 6C and 6D because the volume<br>
defined upwardly from the partition element is lower than the one of figures 6C<br>
and 6D.<br>
With reference to figures 5, 6B and 6D, a volume 60 is provided between .<br>
the lower wall of each element 40, 52 or 54 and the bottom 8 of the container 1.<br>
Also the volume 60 may be used for housing food product, for example a second<br>
product which, together the product 3, is used to prepare the beverage. For<br>
example, the volume 60 may be completely or partially filled with powder milk,<br>
or with liquid milk, powder cocoa, etc.. The elements 40, 52 or 54 for<br>
dividing/reducing the volume of the capsule C may thus be designed also for<br>
maximizing or minimizing the volume 60. For example, when minimization of<br>
the volume 60 is desired, the element 54 of figure 6D may be provided with a<br>
lower portion 61 having a toroidal shape.<br>
The capsules according to the present invention may be madeof known<br>
common plastic materials used in this field, for example polyolefins (e.g.<br>
polypropylene and polyethylene and/or copolymers thereof), or multi-layer<br>
polyolefin and aluminium suitable for use in the food field, according to the<br>
needs of each particular application.<br><br>
