Method for controlling the use of a program signal in a broad¬cast system, and control device for a receiver for carrying out such a method<br>
The invention relates to a method for controlling the use of a program signal in a broadcast system, comprising one or more broadcasters and a number of receivers, at least a part of the receivers preferably having a storage medium for storing program signals, wherein the program signal comprises content signals of a first and a second type, wherein at least the first type of content signals is scrambled using control words as scrambling keys to obtain a scrambled program signal and wherein the scrambled program signal is broadcasted together with entitlement control messages (ECM's) containing the con¬trol words in an encrypted manner using a second key, wherein decrypting means are provided at each receiver for retrieving the control words from the ECM's by decrypting the ECM's, and wherein the control words are delivered by the decrypting means for descrambling the program signal. The invention further re¬lates to a control device for a receiver for carrying out such a method, comprising decrypting means for retrieving the con¬trol words from ECM's by decrypting the ECM's, and for deliver¬ing decrypted control words for descrambling a program signal.<br>
Recently audio/video devices has become available, wherein the device is provided with a storage medium having sufficient storage capacity to store hours of audio/video pro¬grams. With such audio/video devices it is possible to use a remote editing agent in the receiver to construct a broadcast¬ing station within the device. The remote editing agent causes video and/or audio clips to be presented to the viewer in a continuous sequence simulating a broadcast service. The se¬quence can be determined by direct user interaction, user set¬tings or intelligent analysis within the receiver of the user's behavior.<br>
In many cases, a program signal includes both content<br><br>
signals (or more generally content signals of a first type) and advertisement signals (or more generally content signals of a second type), wherein selling advertisement time slots in the complete program is an important income source of the broad¬caster. With the availability of audio/video devices of the above-mentioned type, the remote editing agent can use the user interaction/profile to select which advertisements should be inserted in the advertisement slots in the program signal. In this manner a broadcaster can resell the same advertisement slots to many advertisers and the advertisements can be better targeted to the viewers. This way of tuning advertisement slots to the viewer requires to add data to the program signal with flags indicating the insertion points to insert advertisements in the advertisement slots and data describing the type of ad¬vertisements and programs, respectively. However a program sig¬nal with flags to indicate the advertisement slots is open to use by unauthorized third parties which can reprogram the re¬ceivers to use the program signal provided by the broadcaster to insert their own advertisements or to remove the advertise¬ment slots completely.<br>
The invention aims to provide a method of the above-mentioned type, wherein unauthorized use of a program signal is prevented in an efficient manner.<br>
According to the method of the invention at least a plurality of ECM's comprises control information to control the decrypting means in such a manner that at least the time slots for second type of content signals are maintained in the first type of content signals.<br>
In this manner a method is obtained, wherein unauthorized use of the program signal is prevented, because the de¬crypted ECM's provided by the broadcaster provide control on the use of the signal, in particular on maintaining the time slots in the first type of content signal.<br>
. Preferably, the ECM's comprise first ECM*s for the first type of content signals and second ECM's for the second type of content signals, wherein at least a plurality of first and second ECM's is provided with control information, wherein the decrypting means checks the control information and deli-<br><br>
errs decrypted control words of the first or second ECM's in ac¬cordance with the control information to descramble content signals of the first or second type, respectively.<br>
The invention further provides a control device of the above-mentioned type characterized in that the decrypting means is adapted to check the control information of the decrypted ECM*s and to insert a time slot in the first type of content signals as indicated by the control information.<br>
The invention will be further explained by reference to the drawings, in which an embodiment of the method and con¬trol device of the invention are shown by way of example.<br>
Fig. 1 shows in a very schematic manner an embodiment of a control device of the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a flow diagram to explain an embodiment of the method of the invention.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a flow diagram to explain a second em¬bodiment of the method of the invention.<br>
It is noted that in the following examples the inser¬tion of advertisements into a content signal, such as a show or a film, is described. However the invention generally relates to a method for controlling the use of a program signal, wherein the program signal comprises a first type of content signals, i.e. the show or film or the like, and a second type of content signals, for example advertisement signals, wherein the second type of content signals can be inserted into the first type of content signals under the control of the broad¬caster.<br>
In the method described the program signal that is broadcasted is scrambled irrespective whether it is a pay serv¬ice or a service based upon advertisement as source of income. The scrambling is carried out in a usual manner according to a conditional access system with a key hierarchy. It is noted that the structure of the conditional access system and the de-scrambling/encryption techniques used are not part of the pres¬ent invention. According to the invention, the conditional ac¬cess system is used to manage the insertion of the advertise¬ments into the program signal.<br>
The control device shown in fig. 1 is adapted to opera-<br><br>
ate according to a conditional access system, wherein so-called entitlement control messages or ECM's are broadcasted together with the program signal, wherein the ECM's comprise the control words or first keys which are used to scramble the clear pro¬gram signal. The control words are encrypted using a second key which is available in the control device, in case of the em¬bodiment shown in fig. 1 in a smart card 1. The smart card 1 decrypts the ECM's to provide the clear control words to a unit<br>
2	for descrambling the scrambled content signal. The output of the unit 2 provides the clear audio/video signals. The input to the descrambling unit 2 may be a compressed signal, in which case the unit 2 also operates to decompress the signal. The in¬put signals can be retrieved from a storage medium 3, for exam¬ple a hard disk with large capacity, or directly from a demodu¬lator/demultiplexer 4. The signals stored on the storage medium<br>
3	may come from the demodulator/demultiplexer 4. This part of the control device is not part of the present invention and will therefore not be described further.<br>
Both the content program signal and the advertisement signal have their corresponding ECM's inserted, i.e. content or first ECM's and advert or second ECM's, respectively. Although in this embodiment the advertisement signal is scrambled with advert ECM's, the advertisement signal may be sent in the clear or scrambled using the control word of the last content ECM. This means that it is also possible to use only one type of ECM's.<br>
As the program signal is played back the appropriate ECM's are sent to the smart card and these ECM's are used to control the use of the complete program signal. To this end, the content ECM's may carry control information including a content sequence identifier. This control information can in¬clude information on the content and rules for insertion of the advertisement signals into the content. These rules may for ex¬ample indicate specific advertisements which should be inserted into the specific content signal, for. example in case the broadcaster has sold advertisement slots in specific films, shows or the like. It will be clear to the skilled person that the storage medium 3 will have stored several types of advert-<br><br>
tenement signals, so that different control devices according to fig. 1 can insert different advertisements depending on user settings or analysis of user behavior. A further possibility as a rule for insertion of different advertisements is inser¬tion in dependence of the time of the day.<br>
The ECM's of the advertisement signals also may carry control information including a sequence identifier. The con¬trol information may include information identifying the adver¬tising material, information specifying how many advert ECM's there are in the sequence of ECM's that delivers control words for one advertisement and the order of ECM's. Typically, a con¬ditional access system changes the control word every few sec¬onds so that with an advertising slot of for example 30 sec¬onds, there may be several ECM's per advertising slot.<br>
The control information may further include timing in¬formation specifying a delay between ECM's. In this manner fast forwarding of the advertisements or submission of advert ECM's without actually processing the content can be prevented. The smart card 1 is provided with a real time clock and checks the delay specified by the ECM and if this delay has not passed, the smart card 1 does not accept the next or any other ECM in the sequence before the delay has actually passed. In this man¬ner the advertising slot is enforced during the playback of the program signal.<br>
It is noted that at least a part of the content ECM's may also include timing information in the control information, in particular in ECM's just before and after an advertisement slot to prevent a start of fast forwarding just before the ad¬vertisement slot. The sequence identifiers in both types of ECM's are used to signal the smart card 1 a jump to a new point in the program signal.<br>
According to the method of the invention described various rules for insertion of advertisements can be used-<br>
. In an embodiment wherein only one type of ECM's are used, the decryption of an ECM can be made dependent on the de¬cryption of a previous ECM. For example by using the sequence identifier of the ECM's a next ECM is only used to obtain the control word if the previous ECM has indeed been used. Skipping<br><br>
a part of the program, in particular the time slot for adver¬tisements is prevented in this manner. As an alternative the same result can be obtained by providing timing indices within one type of ECM's, The timing information in the ECM's will en¬force a break in the normal program for insertion of the ad¬verts .<br>
Fig.. 2 shows an embodiment wherein timing is used to insert the advertisements into the content program signal. By way of example a slot of one minute of advertisement could be inserted into each five minutes of program content. To this end the control information of the content ECM's carry information to count down until the advertisement insertion slot. In the flow diagram shown in fig. 2, each ECM extracted from the pro¬gram signal is checked by the smart card on timing information and if the time delay is correct, the ECM is checked on whether or not it is an advert ECM. If it is a content ECM, the content ECM counter is incremented. Depending on the count of the coun¬ter, a flag is set to indicate that an advert ECM should be ex¬tracted in the next cycles. After outputting the control word to the descrambler 2, a next ECM is extracted. If an advert ECM is detected by the smart card, a counter for advert ECM's is incremented and the output control word is provided to the de-scrambler 2. When the advertisement slots have passed, the ECM flag is reset to content and a next content ECM is extracted. If the advertisement slot has not yet passed, a next advert ECM is extracted.<br>
As an alternative to the operation shown in the flow diagram of fig. 2, only the last ECM before the advertisement insertion point could have an indication to instruct the smart card to start an advertisement slot.<br>
During processing advert ECM's, the smart card 1 en¬sures by checking the time delay that the delay between ECM's is such that the specified advertisement duration is maintained even if the user tries to fast forward during the advertisement slot.<br>
As mentioned above, in this example, the content ECM's could contain control information which indicates that only specific advertisements should be inserted into the next advert-<br><br>
tenement slot. The smart card will then only allow correspond¬ing advert ECM's to be processed.<br>
It is possible that the user of the control device switches to another channel during the advertisement slot. In order to guarantee that the advertisement is viewed, the smart card 1 can maintain a log of the program that has been watched by retrieving the program signal from the storage medium 3. When the user returns to that channel, the smart card enforces that the correct advertisement sequence is watched before the next part of program content becomes available.<br>
In fig. 3 a flow diagram of a second embodiment is shown, wherein for both the content ECM's and the advert ECM's a counter is used, wherein the control information of the con¬tent ECM's indicates a threshold for the amount of viewing of the program content which must occur before an advertisement can be inserted. Once the threshold, i.e. a minimum amount of viewing time, has been reached the smart card 1 may be pro¬grammed such that it waits for an appropriate insertion point or immediately stops processing content ECM's until a predeter¬mined number of advert ECM's are processed.<br>
In this embodiment the control information of the con¬tent ECM's may also indicate the appropriate insertion point for the advertisement slot. In this manner the advertisements are not randomly inserted in the middle of a scene but only at a scene boundary for example. Of course, the control informa¬tion of the content ECM's may also indicate a maximum value of program viewing time and if exceeded, the smart card 1 does not wait until an appropriate insertion point but immediately starts to process advert ECM's.<br>
A program signal may include one or more ECM's having a decision rule as part of the control information, which deci¬sion rule provides the user the possibility to select a viewing mode with a particular entitlement to watch the content without advertisement insertion. This particular entitlement may be subscription, pay per view or the like.<br>
As an alternative it can be guaranteed that an adver¬tisement slot is not deleted or skipped by providing control information in the last ECM or plurality of ECM's before the<br><br>
advertisement slot indicating the rate at which ECM's are al¬lowed to be processed or the delay before the next ECM is al¬lowed to be processed. For example, this control information instructs the control device to wait for two minutes before the next ECM can be processed.<br>
Although in the above embodiments the invention is ex¬plained when using stored content, the invention can be used in the same manner in watching or listening normal broadcast sig¬nals. The advert ECM*s can be used to check whether the user has not surfed to another channel. If the user did surf to an¬other channel access to the content of the channel using the described control method, can then be denied for a predeter¬mined period for example.<br>
In the above-described embodiments, a control device is used having a hardware smart card for processing the ECM's as in a conventional conditional access system. According to an embodiment of the invention described, the function of the smart card regarding processing of ECM's can be carried out by a software module which is executed in a microprocessor of the descrambler 2. This software module is provided by the broad¬caster and is downloaded over the air into the descrambler 2 and can be changed regularly to prevent unauthorized persons to reprogram the descrambler 2, for example to completely delete the advertisement slots or to insert there own advertisements.<br>
