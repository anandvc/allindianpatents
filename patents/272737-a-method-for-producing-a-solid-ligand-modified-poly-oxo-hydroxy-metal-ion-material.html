				<td>Ligand Modified Poly Oxo-hydroxy Metal Ion Materials,<br>
Their Uses and Processes For Their Preparation<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to ligand-modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy metal ion materials and their uses, in particular<br>
for nutritional, medical, cosmetic or biologically related<br>
applications for example for the treatment of a deficiency<br>
related to a component of the material or for the removal<br>
of an endogenous substance capable of binding to the<br>
material. The present invention further relates to<br>
processes for preparing the materials and optimising their<br>
physico-chemical properties and their medical uses.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient<br>
deficiency in the world today, affecting more than 4<br>
billion people globally. It is estimated that 2 billion<br>
people - over 30% of the world's population - are anaemic<br>
(WHO, http://www.who.int/nut/ida.htm, accessed 20 December<br>
2005). Iron deficiency is not a problem solely confined<br>
to the developing world. Epidemiological surveys<br>
performed in European countries show that iron deficiency<br>
concerns 10-30% of menstruating women and iron deficiency<br>
anaemia (IDA) 1.5 to 14% (Hercberg et al., 2001; Goddard<br>
et al., 2005). Iron deficiency anaemia can result in<br>
decreased intellectual performance, decreased physical<br>
capacity, alterations in temperature regulation,<br>
alterations in the development of gestation, and<br>
compromised immune and metabolic functions, all of which<br>
impact upon quality of life and health economics (Edgerton<br>
et al, 1979; Hercberg et al, 2001; Scholz et al, 1997).<br>
The standard first line treatment for simple mild IDA is,<br>
commonly, supplementation with oral ferrous sulphate.<br>
 <br>
More complex or severe iron deficiencies may be treated<br>
with intravenous iron or blood transfusions, but<br>
subsequent management is with oral iron preparations. In<br>
spite of the widespread use of oral iron preparations<br>
their effectiveness is poor. This is due to: (i) variable<br>
absorption characteristics and (ii) side effects resulting<br>
in poor compliance. Strategies for the prevention of iron<br>
deficiency include the use of iron-fortified foods.<br>
Commonly used fortificants include ferrous sulphate,<br>
ferric chloride, ferric sodium EDTA and ferric<br>
pyrophosphates. However, despite fortification<br>
strategies, iron deficiency remains a common global<br>
problem and, thus, cheap and effective supplements are<br>
required.<br>
WO 2005/000210 describes the synthesis of high molecular<br>
weight iron saccharidic complexes formed when freshly<br>
precipitated iron hydroxides are subsequently aggregated<br>
with sugar molecules to form secondary complexes. These<br>
complexes are acknowledged to be agglomerated mixtures.<br>
WO 03/031635 relates to an enzymatic method to prepare<br>
calcium gluconate where the crystals are high purity and<br>
high solubility.<br>
US 2005/0209322 describes a process for making sodium<br>
ferric gluconate complexes for i.v. iron administration<br>
that requires the initial step of preparing ferric<br>
hydroxide with a subsequent step of reacting with the<br>
ligand, sodium gluconate. US 2005/0209187 relates to a<br>
similar process for making iron sucrose complexes rather<br>
than iron gluconate complexes.<br>
US 2003/0049284 describes a method for increasing the<br>
 <br>
solubility of salts of alpha hydroxy carboxylic acids, by<br>
reaction with an alpha amino acid, such that the material<br>
would have improved nutritional supplementation<br>
properties.<br>
US 3,679,377 relates to the provision of an agronomically<br>
effective source of iron in a plant nutrient solution as a<br>
soluble ferric sulfato-hydroxyl complex anion. The<br>
materials produced are conventional ligand-metal ion<br>
complexes.<br>
DE 20 2005 014332 U1 discloses metal-organic nanopowders<br>
for use in materials engineering such as the formation of<br>
polymeric composites through injection spraying or coating<br>
of the nanopowders into or onto an existing material.<br>
Jugdaohsingh et al. (2004) describes a critical<br>
precipitation assay that utilises a solution phase<br>
reaction in which, at peri-neutral pH, organic acids<br>
compete with the formation of the oxo-bridges between<br>
aluminium atoms in the polymerisation process, limiting<br>
the growth and decreasing the branching of the polyhydroxy<br>
aluminium species (Jugdaohsingh et al. (2004); Powell et<br>
al. (2004)). The assay is usable because the efficiency<br>
of the ligand in interrupting this process is related to<br>
its affinity for aluminium. It was also noted in this<br>
work that during solution-phase growth of polyhydroxy<br>
aluminium species, the 'competing ligand' becomes<br>
incorporated within the polymer.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Broadly, the present invention relates to processes for<br>
preparing solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion<br>
materials and optimising their physico-chemical<br>
 <br>
properties. The compositions generally comprise solid<br>
ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion materials<br>
represented by the formula (MxLy (OH) n), wherein M represents<br>
one or more metal ions, L represents one or more ligands<br>
and OH represents oxo or hydroxy groups, and may be used<br>
in nutritional, medical, cosmetic or other biologically<br>
relevant applications. These include delivery of the<br>
materials per se, or the use of the materials for the<br>
delivery of a component of the material, such as the metal<br>
ion, as a supplement or fortificant or food additive, or<br>
the use of the material to remove or inhibit a component<br>
and ameliorate any undesirable effects that it may cause.<br>
The solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion<br>
materials disclosed herein constitute new forms of matter<br>
that have not been described previously in the art for<br>
such uses and which can be defined, inter alia., with<br>
reference to structural, spectroscopic or compositional<br>
parameters (i.e. using the analytical signatures of the<br>
materials) or by the processes by which the materials have<br>
been obtained. Thus, while metal oxo-hydroxide powders<br>
are very well known in the field of inorganic chemistry,<br>
in the present invention they are modified by biologically<br>
compatible ligands (i.e. other than oxo or hydroxy groups)<br>
to alter their physical and/or chemical properties to<br>
produce new materials and for use in new applications. As<br>
part of the unique processes used to optimise and produce<br>
the materials, it is notable that (i) the materials are<br>
recovered as a solid following precipitation from solution<br>
(e.g. aqueous solution) and (ii) that the ligand<br>
incorporation into the poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion solid<br>
phase is, for at least one of the ligands involved,<br>
through formal, identifiable bonding.<br>
 <br>
Thus, by way of example, the present invention differs<br>
from the critical precipitation assay disclosed in<br>
Jugdaohsingh et al. (2004) because that assay was carried<br>
out in solution and the precipitated material was not<br>
subsequently isolated or further employed. In contrast,<br>
in the present invention, the formation of the polymers<br>
continues to the point of precipitation and it is the<br>
solid materials that are then characterised and used in a<br>
variety of applications. Furthermore, the present<br>
inventors have found that the dried solid phase materials<br>
exhibit physico-chemical properties that are sensitively<br>
dependent upon the exact solution conditions used in the<br>
production of the material, for example the choice of<br>
ligand(s) and their concentration versus that of the metal<br>
ion. These materials are not, as might be expected,<br>
simply metal oxides/hydroxides with subtly differing<br>
degrees of crystallisation, and therefore subtly differing<br>
material properties, but instead the ligand(s) incorporate<br>
within the matrix of the poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion<br>
precipitate through substitution of oxo or hydroxyl<br>
groups. This is generally non-stoichiometric but,<br>
nonetheless, occurs through formal bonding, and leads to<br>
distinct and novel alterations in the chemistry,<br>
crystallinity and material properties of the solid. Thus,<br>
the compositions produced according to the present<br>
invention are chemically novel entities and are not simply<br>
the results of altering the degree of crystallinity of the<br>
metal oxides/hydroxides. Surprisingly, the conditions of<br>
precipitation do not easily predict the properties of the<br>
solid, such as the conditions of its re-dissolution and,<br>
for example, using this system it is perfectly possible to<br>
precipitate a material at pH 7 which can also be<br>
completely re-aquated at pH 7 using only a slightly larger<br>
volume of solution or by making a subtle change to the<br>
 <br>
solution chemistry. Nonetheless, under the exact same<br>
reaction conditions, material is formed with highly-<br>
reproducible properties. Thus, the idea underlying the<br>
present invention is that this process can be used to<br>
produce M:L:OH solids with precisely tailored physico-<br>
chemical characteristics for multiple biological<br>
applications such as in medicine, nutrition or cosmetics,<br>
where specific material characteristics are required.<br>
This approach has not been previously disclosed and it is<br>
surprising that such subtle changes in the precipitation<br>
process allow suitable changes in the solid phase that can<br>
be used to produce such precisely tailored physico-<br>
chemical (e.g. dissolution) characteristics or properties.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a process for producing a solid ligand-modified<br>
poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion material (MxLy(OH)n) , wherein M<br>
represents one or more metal ions, L represents one or<br>
more ligands and OH represents oxo or hydroxy groups, and<br>
wherein the gross solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
metal ion material has one or more reproducible physico-<br>
chemical properties and displays M-L bonding for at least<br>
one ligand that can be detected by physical analytical<br>
techniques,<br>
the process comprising:<br>
(a)	mixing the metal ions M and the ligands L at a<br>
first pH(A) at which the components are soluble;<br>
(b)	changing the pH(A) to a second pH(B) to cause a<br>
solid precipitate of the solid ligand-modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy metal ion material to be formed; and<br>
(c)	separating, and optionally drying, the solid<br>
ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion material<br>
produced in step (b).<br>
 <br>
By way of example, the materials produced by the processes<br>
of the present invention may be employed in nutritional,<br>
medical, cosmetic or other biologically relevant<br>
applications. A preferred example of such an application<br>
is the use of the material to deliver the material, or a<br>
part thereof such as a metal ion or a ligand, to a<br>
subject, for example to correct a deficiency in the<br>
component or so that the component provide a beneficial<br>
effect to the subject. An alternative example is the use<br>
of a material to bind or sequester a component that may be<br>
present in the system into which the material is<br>
introduced, thereby to remove or inhibit that component<br>
and ameliorate any undesirable effects that it may cause.<br>
In view of this, the process may comprise the further step<br>
of formulating the solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy-<br>
metal ion material in a composition for administration to<br>
a subject.<br>
In any aspect of the present invention, the processes<br>
disclosed herein may be employed to engineer or optimise<br>
the physico-chemical properties of the material, for<br>
example to control the dissolution profile or the<br>
adsorption profile, or a similar property of the material,<br>
and it is a considerable advantage of the processes<br>
described herein that they are highly amenable to such<br>
optimisation studies.<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a process for producing a solid ligand-modified<br>
poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion material and optimising a<br>
desired physico-chemical property of the material to adapt<br>
it for a nutritional, medical, cosmetic or biologically<br>
related application, wherein the solid ligand-modified<br>
poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion material is represented by the<br>
 <br>
formula (MxLy(OH}n), wherein M represent one or more metal<br>
ions, L represents one or more ligands and OH represents<br>
oxo or hydroxy groups, wherein the gross solid ligand-<br>
modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion material has one or<br>
more reproducible physico-chemical properties and displays<br>
M-L bonding for at least one ligand that can be detected<br>
by physical analytical techniques,<br>
the process comprising:<br>
(a)	mixing the metal ion(s) M and the ligand(s) L in<br>
a reaction medium at a first pH(A) at which the components<br>
are soluble;<br>
(b)	changing the pH(A) to a second pH(B) to cause a<br>
solid precipitate of the ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
metal ion material to be formed;<br>
(c)	separating, and optionally drying, the solid<br>
ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion material<br>
produced in step (b) .<br>
(d)	testing the desired physico-chemical<br>
characteristic(s) of the precipitated solid ligand-<br>
modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion material; and<br>
(e)	repeating steps (a) to (d) as required by varying<br>
one or more of:<br>
(i) the identity or concentration of the metal ion(s)<br>
(M) and/or the ligand(s) (L) supplied in step (a); and/or<br>
(ii) the ratio of metal ion(s) (M) to ligand(s) (L)<br>
supplied in (a); and/or<br>
(iii) pH(A); and/or<br>
(iv) pH(B); and/or<br>
(v) the rate of change from pH(A) to pH(B); and/or<br>
(vi) the presence or concentration of a buffer<br>
thereby to produce a solid ligand-modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy metal ion material having the desired physico-<br>
chemical property.<br>
 <br>
Examples of possible metal ions and ligands are provided<br>
below. In some embodiments, the materials of the present<br>
invention may employ more than one species of metal ion or<br>
ligand, for example two, three, four or five different<br>
species of metal ion or ligand. In addition, in some<br>
embodiments, the ligand(s) L may also have some buffering<br>
capacity as described in more detail below.<br>
As part of the process for optimising a desired physico-<br>
chemical property of the material to provide for its<br>
application, it may be desirable to vary physical or<br>
chemical reaction conditions used in the process for<br>
making the solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal<br>
ion material, for example the temperature of the reaction,<br>
the ionic content and strength of the solution, buffering<br>
capacity of the solution (e.g. using a buffer such as MOPS<br>
as in the examples) , or the conditions and apparatus used<br>
to mix the reactants, to determine whether and how this<br>
affects one or more properties of the material.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a<br>
process for making solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
metal ion materials for administration to a subject, the<br>
process comprising having optimised a solid ligand-<br>
modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion material according to<br>
the process as disclosed herein, the further step of<br>
manufacturing the solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
metal ion material in bulk and/or formulating it in a<br>
composition.<br>
In one embodiment, the processes of the present invention<br>
have been employed by way of example to optimise and<br>
produce ferric iron compositions, e.g. for use as iron<br>
supplements, fortificants or therapeutics. As is<br>
 <br>
generally used in the art, supplements are nutritional<br>
compositions that are taken by subjects to correct,<br>
prevent or insure against a deficiency in a mineral or<br>
other dietary component. A fortificant is somewhat<br>
similar to a supplement but is generally applied to<br>
compositions that are added routinely to foodstuffs to<br>
improve their nutritional value, for example the addition<br>
of iodide to table salt, B group vitamins to breakfast<br>
cereals or iron to cereal products. In addition,<br>
compositions may be used therapeutically, usually in the<br>
context of preventing or treating a pathology or condition<br>
caused by the deficiency in a mineral or other dietary<br>
component. In the case of iron, the ferric iron<br>
compositions disclosed herein may be employed as<br>
supplements, fortificants or as therapeutic compositions,<br>
for example in the treatment of iron deficiency in<br>
pregnant or pre-menopausal women, cancer or inflammatory<br>
disease. Such therapeutics are typically administered<br>
orally or intravenously.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention further<br>
provides a ferric iron composition for administration to a<br>
subject which comprises a solid ligand-modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy metal ion material represented by the formula<br>
(MxLy(OH)n), wherein M represents one or more metal ions<br>
that comprise Fe3+ ions, L represents one or more ligands<br>
and OH represents oxo or hydroxy groups in which the<br>
ligands L are substantially randomly substituted for the<br>
oxo or hydroxy groups, the solid ligand-modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy metal ion material having one or more reproducible<br>
physico-chemical properties and demonstrable M-L bonding<br>
using physical analysis.<br>
Generally a useful dietary iron supplement needs to share<br>
 <br>
some characteristics of simple ferrous salts, namely cost<br>
relatively little and be reasonably well absorbed, but at<br>
the same time, be less redox active and hence lead to a<br>
low incidence of side-effects. Some ferric salts do not<br>
suffer from this disadvantage as they are already<br>
oxidised, and are therefore less prone to redox activity<br>
because the initiation of iron reduction in the<br>
gastrointestinal lumen is less favourable than the<br>
initiation of iron oxidation. Moreover, the controlled<br>
mucosal reduction of ferric iron, via the mucosal protein<br>
DcytB, may provide a rate-limiting step for the entry of<br>
iron to the circulation, which would lower the production<br>
of circulating non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI). NTBI<br>
may lead to oxidative damage in the circulation,<br>
endothelium and the more vascular organs. However, simple<br>
ferric salts are not efficient supplements because their<br>
rapid dissolution in the stomach is followed by<br>
concentration-dependent oxo-hydroxy polymerisation in the<br>
small bowel which inhibits their absorption. Thus, while<br>
ferric iron salts, typically ferric chloride., have been<br>
tried as fortificants in certain foods, these are poorly<br>
absorbed at supplemental or therapeutic doses due to<br>
uncontrolled delivery of ferric ions into the small bowel<br>
at bolus doses. Chelation of ferric iron, for example<br>
with maltol, may help overcome this small bowel solubility<br>
issue for bolus doses, but has not proven commercially<br>
viable due to production costs (WO 03/097627). In<br>
addition there are concerns over the safety of chelators<br>
such as maltol. The compositions disclosed herein are<br>
engineered to overcome such absorption, safety, side<br>
effect and production cost problems. Thus, these solid<br>
ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion materials can<br>
be tailored to have distinct dissolution profiles in the<br>
stomach environment compared to the small bowel<br>
 <br>
environment. In this way, rapid dissolution in the<br>
stomach that then leads to undesirable bolus delivery of<br>
iron in the small bowel, as occurs for simple ferrous and<br>
ferric salts, can be avoided in the design of these<br>
materials. Both the pH of dissolution and the rate of<br>
dissolution can be engineered to match requirements.<br>
Potentially, these solid phase ligand-modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy ferric iron materials could be tailored to 'sense'<br>
iron requirements. Absorption of iron from the gut lumen<br>
and into the circulation occurs in individuals who require<br>
iron. In those who do not require iron there will be<br>
little or no absorption and more iron will remain in the<br>
lumen. The dissolution or disaggregation of these solid<br>
phase ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron<br>
materials could be 'set' such that they dissolve or<br>
disaggregate efficiently in an environment that is low in<br>
aquated iron, but inefficiently in an environment that is<br>
high in aquated iron. This again would help to reduce<br>
side effects without compromising absorption in those who<br>
need iron. Whether these materials are designed to<br>
dissolve or disaggregate under gastrointestinal conditions<br>
depends upon the optimal mode of iron absorption in the<br>
gut as both soluble iron and very small aquated<br>
particulate iron could both be absorbed but, either way,<br>
the ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron materials<br>
could be so designed.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides the<br>
use of a composition of a solid ligand-modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy metal ion material (MxLy(OH)n) as obtainable by the<br>
processes disclosed herein for the preparation of a<br>
medicament for therapeutic delivery of the metal ion to<br>
the subject. Alternatively, the present invention<br>
provides a solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal<br>
 <br>
ion material (MxLy(OH)n) as obtainable by the processes<br>
disclosed herein for the delivery of the metal ion to a<br>
subject.<br>
Examples of the uses of the solid ligand-modified poly<br>
oxo-hydroxy metal ion materials disclosed herein include,<br>
but are not limited to, uses as: dietary mineral<br>
supplements and fortificants; therapeutic mineral<br>
supplements (e.g. as administered by i.v. and oral<br>
routes); drugs, nutrients or cosmetic carriers/co-<br>
complexes; phosphate binding agents; other binding or<br>
sequestering applications/ food additives; anti-<br>
perspirants; sun-protection agents; vaccine adjuvants;<br>
immuno-modulatory agents; direct cosmetic applications<br>
including exfoliating agents; bone and dental<br>
filler/cements; implant materials including brachytherapy,<br>
and imaging and contrast agents.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will now be described<br>
by way of example and not limitation with reference to the<br>
accompanying figures and examples.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The Metal Ion (M)<br>
The solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion<br>
materials may be represented by the formula (MxLy(OH)n) ,<br>
where M represents one or more metal ions. Normally, the<br>
metal ion will originally be present in the form of a salt<br>
that in the preparation of the materials may be dissolved<br>
and then induced to form poly oxo-hydroxy co-complexes<br>
with ligand (L) some of which is integrated into the solid<br>
phase through formal M-L bonding, i.e. not all of the<br>
ligand (L) is simply trapped or adsorbed in the bulk<br>
material. The bonding of the metal ion in the materials<br>
 <br>
can be determined using physical analytical techniques<br>
such as infrared spectroscopy where the spectra will have<br>
peaks characteristic of the bonds between the metal ion<br>
and the ligand (L), as well as peaks characteristic of<br>
other bonds present in the material such as M-O, O-H and<br>
bonds in the ligand species (L). Preferred metal ions (M)<br>
are biologically compatible under the conditions for which<br>
the materials are used and are readily precipitatable from<br>
aqueous solution by forming oxo-hydroxides. Examples of<br>
metal ions include iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper,<br>
manganese, chromium and aluminium ions. A particularly<br>
preferred metal ion is ferric iron (Fe3+) .<br>
By way of reference to the ferric iron compositions<br>
disclosed herein, the presence of formal bonding is one<br>
aspect that mainly distinguishes the materials from other<br>
products such as "iron polymaltose" (Maltofer) in which<br>
particulate crystalline iron oxo-hydroxide is surrounded<br>
by a sugar shell formed from maltose and thus is simply a<br>
mixture of iron oxo-hydroxide and sugar at the nano-level<br>
(Heinrich (1975); Geisser and Muller (1987); Nielsen et al<br>
(1994; US Patent No: 3,076,798); US20060205691). In<br>
addition, the materials of the present invention are metal<br>
poly oxo-hydroxy species modified by non-stoichiometric<br>
ligand incorporation and should therefore not be confused<br>
with the numerous metal-ligand complexes that are well<br>
reported in the art (e.g., see WO 03/092674, WO<br>
06/037449) . Although generally soluble, such complexes<br>
can be precipitated from solution at the point of<br>
supersaturation, for example ferric trimaltol, Harvey et<br>
al. (1998), WO 03/097627; ferric citrate, WO 04/074444 and<br>
ferric tartrate, Bobtelsky and Jordan (1947) and, on<br>
occasions, may even involve stoichiometric binding of<br>
hydroxyl groups (for example, ferric hydroxide saccharide,<br>
 <br>
US Patent No: 3,821,192). The use of hydroxyl groups to<br>
balance the charge and geometry of metal-ligand complexes<br>
is, of course, well reported in the art (e.g. iron-<br>
hydroxy-malate, WO 04/050031) and unrelated to the solid<br>
ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion materials<br>
reported herein.<br>
Without modification, the primary particles of the<br>
materials have metal oxide cores and metal hydroxide<br>
surfaces and within different disciplines may be referred<br>
to as metal oxides or metal hydroxides. The use of the<br>
term 'oxo-hydroxy' or 'oxo-hydroxide' is intended to<br>
recognise these facts without any reference to proportions<br>
of oxo or hydroxy groups. Hydroxy-oxide could equally be<br>
used therefore. As described above, the materials of the<br>
present invention are altered at the level of the primary<br>
particle of the metal oxo-hydroxide with at least some of<br>
the ligand L being introduced into the structure of the<br>
primary particle, i.e. leading to doping or contamination<br>
of the primary particle by the ligand L. This may be<br>
contrasted with the formation of nano-mixtures of metal<br>
oxo-hydroxides and an organic molecule, such as iron<br>
saccharidic complexes, in which the structure of the<br>
primary particles is not so altered.<br>
The primary particles of the ligand-modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy metal ion materials described herein are produced<br>
by a process referred to as precipitation. The use of the<br>
term precipitation often refers to the formation of<br>
aggregates of materials that do separate from solution by<br>
sedimentation or centrifugation. Here, the term<br>
"precipitation" is intended to describe the formation of<br>
all solid phase material, including aggregates as<br>
described above and solid materials that do not aggregate<br>
 <br>
but remain as non-soluble moieties in suspension, whether<br>
or not they be particulate, colloidal or sub-colloidal<br>
(nanoparticulates). These latter solid materials may also<br>
be referred to as aquated particulate solids.<br>
In the present invention, reference may be made to the<br>
modified metal oxo-hydroxides having polymeric structures<br>
that generally form above the critical precipitation pH.<br>
As used herein, this should not be taken as indicating<br>
that the structures of the materials are polymeric in the<br>
strict sense of having a regular repeating monomer unit<br>
because, as has been stated, ligand incorporation is,<br>
except by co-incidence, non-stoichiometric. The ligand<br>
species is introduced into the solid phase structure by<br>
substituting for oxo or hydroxy groups leading to a change<br>
in solid phase order. In some cases, for example the<br>
production of the ferric iron materials exemplified<br>
herein, the ligand species L may be introduced into the<br>
solid phase structure by the substitution of oxo or<br>
hydroxy groups by ligand molecules in a manner that<br>
decreases overall order in the solid phase material.<br>
While this still produces solid ligand modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy metal ion materials that in the gross form have<br>
one or more reproducible physico-chemical properties, the<br>
materials have a more amorphous nature compared, for<br>
example, to the structure of the corresponding metal oxo-<br>
hydroxide. The presence of a more disordered or amorphous<br>
structure can readily be determined by the skilled person<br>
using techniques well known in the art. One exemplary<br>
technique is X-ray diffraction (XRD) which will produce an<br>
X-ray diffraction pattern for the ferric iron materials<br>
exemplified herein having poorly identifiable peaks for L<br>
or MO/MOH, XRD relying on a regular arrangement of atoms<br>
to diffract the X-rays and produce a pattern.<br>
 <br>
Alternatively or additionally, a decrease in the<br>
crystallinity of the structure of the material may be<br>
determined by high resolution transmission electron<br>
microscopy. High resolution transmission electron<br>
microscopy allows the crystalline pattern of the material<br>
to be visually assessed. It can indicate the primary<br>
particle size and structure (such as d-spacing) and give<br>
some information on the distribution between amorphous and<br>
crystalline material. Using this technique, it is<br>
apparent that the chemistry described above increases the<br>
amorphous phase of our described materials compared to<br>
corresponding materials without the incorporated ligand.<br>
This may be especially apparent using high angle annular<br>
dark field aberration-corrected scanning transmission<br>
electron microscopy due to the high contrast achieved<br>
while maintaining the resolution thus allowing the surface<br>
as well as the bulk of the primary particles of the<br>
material to be visualised.<br>
The reproducible physico-chemical property or<br>
characteristic of the materials of the present invention<br>
will be dependent on the application for which the<br>
material is intended. Examples of the properties that can<br>
be usefully modulated using the present invention include:<br>
dissolution (rate, pH dependence and pM dependence),<br>
disaggregation, adsorption and absorption characteristics,<br>
reactivity-inertness, melting point, temperature<br>
resistance, particle size, magnetism, electrical<br>
properties, density, light absorbing/reflecting<br>
properties, hardness-softness, colour and encapsulation<br>
properties. Examples of properties that are particularly<br>
relevant to the field of supplements, fortificants and<br>
mineral therapeutics are physico-chemical properties<br>
selected from one or more of a dissolution profile, an<br>
 <br>
adsorption profile or a reproducible elemental ratio. In<br>
this context, a property or characteristic may be<br>
reproducible if replicate experiments are reproducible<br>
within a standard deviation of preferably ± 10%, and more<br>
preferably ± 5%, and even more preferably within a limit<br>
of ± 2%.<br>
The dissolution profile of the solid ligand-modified poly<br>
oxo-hydroxy metal ion materials can be represented by<br>
different stages of the process, namely disaggregation and<br>
dissolution. The term dissolution is used to describe the<br>
passage of a substance from solid to soluble phase. More<br>
specifically, disaggregation is intended to describe the<br>
passage of the materials from a solid aggregated phase to<br>
an aquated phase that is the sum of the soluble phase and<br>
the aquated particulate phase (i.e. solution plus<br>
suspension phases). Therefore, the term dissolution as<br>
opposed to disaggregation more specifically represents the<br>
passage from any solid phase (aggregated or aquated) to<br>
the soluble phase.<br>
Preferred specific examples of the metal ions (M) include,<br>
but are not restricted to, Groups 2, 3 and 5 metals of the<br>
periodic table, the transition metals, heavy metals and<br>
lanthanoids. Examples include, but are not restricted to:<br>
Ag2+, Al3+, Au3+, Be2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Eu3+, Fe3+, Mg2+,<br>
Mn2+, Ni2+, Sr2+, V5+, Zn2+, Zr2+. Moreover, many of these<br>
metal cations take on different oxidation states so it<br>
will also be appreciated that these examples are not<br>
restricted to the oxidation states shown. In many cases,<br>
the solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion<br>
materials comprise a single species of metal ion, for<br>
example Fe3+.<br>
 <br>
The Ligand (L)<br>
In the solid phase ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal<br>
ion- species represented by the formula (MxLy(OH)n), L<br>
represents one or more ligands or anions, such as<br>
initially in its protonated or alkali metal form, that can<br>
be incorporated into the solid phase ligand-modified poly<br>
oxo-hydroxy metal ion material. Typically, this is done<br>
to aid in the modification of a physico-chemical property<br>
of the solid material, e.g. as compared to a poly oxo-<br>
hydroxylated metal ion species in which the ligand(s) are<br>
absent. In some embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
ligand(s) L may also have some buffering capacity.<br>
Examples of ligands that may be employed in the present<br>
invention include, but are by no means limited to:<br>
carboxylic acids such as adipic acid, glutaric acid,<br>
tartaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, aspartic acid,<br>
pimelic acid, citric acid, gluconic acid, lactic acid or<br>
benzoic acid; food additives such as maltol, ethyl maltol<br>
or vanillin; classical anions' with ligand properties<br>
such as bicarbonate, sulphate and phosphate; mineral<br>
ligands such as silicate, borate, molybdate and selenate;<br>
amino acids such as tryptophan, glutamine, proline,<br>
valine, or histidine; and nutrient-based ligands such as<br>
folate, ascorbate, pyridoxine or niacin. Typically<br>
ligands may be well recognised in the art as having high<br>
affinity for a certain metal ion in solution or as having<br>
only low affinity or not be typically recognised as a<br>
ligand for a given metal ion at all. However, we have<br>
found that in poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion materials,<br>
ligands may have a role in spite of an apparent lack of<br>
activity in solution. Typically, two ligands of differing<br>
affinities for the metal ion are used in the production of<br>
these materials although one, two, three, four or more<br>
ligands may be useful in certain applications.<br>
 <br>
For many applications, ligands need to be biologically<br>
compatible under the conditions used and generally have<br>
one or more atoms with a lone pair of electrons at the<br>
point of reaction. The ligands include anions, weak<br>
ligands and strong ligands. Ligands may have some<br>
intrinsic buffering capacity during the reaction. Without<br>
wishing to be bound by a particular explanation, the<br>
inventors believe that the ligands have two modes of<br>
interaction: (a) substitution of hydroxy groups and,<br>
therefore, incorporation with a largely covalent character<br>
within the material and (b) non-specific adsorption (ion<br>
pair formation). These two modes likely relate to<br>
differing metal-ligand affinities (i.e. strong ligands for<br>
the former and weak ligands/anions for the latter). There<br>
is some evidence in our current work that the two types of<br>
ligand are synergistic in modulating dissolution<br>
characteristics of the materials and, perhaps, therefore,<br>
in determining other characteristics of the material. In<br>
this case, two ligand types are used and at least one<br>
(type (a)) is demonstrable as showing metal binding within<br>
the material. Ligand efficacy, probably especially for<br>
type (b) ligands, may be affected by other components of<br>
the system, particularly electrolyte.<br>
The ratio of the metal ion(s) to the ligand(s) (L) is also<br>
a parameter of the solid phase ligand-modifiedpoly oxo-<br>
hydroxy metal iron material that can be varied according<br>
to the methods disclosed herein to vary the properties of<br>
the materials. Generally, the useful ratios of M:L will<br>
be between 10:1, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1 and 1:1 and l.:2, 1:3,<br>
1:4, 1:5 or 1:10.<br>
Hydroxy and oxo groups<br>
 <br>
The present invention may employ any way of forming<br>
hydroxide ions at concentrations that can provide for<br>
hydroxy surface groups and oxo bridging in the formation<br>
of these poly oxo-hydroxy materials. Examples include but<br>
are not limited to, alkali solutions such as sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate,<br>
that would be added to increase [OH] in an ML mixture, or<br>
acid solutions such as mineral acids or organic acids,<br>
that would be added to decrease [OH] in an ML mixture.<br>
Conditions used in the process<br>
The exact conditions of mixing and precipitation of the<br>
solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion material<br>
will vary depending upon the desirable characteristics of<br>
the solid material. Typical variables are:<br>
(1)	Starting pH (i.e. the pH at which M and L are<br>
mixed). This is always a different pH to that at which<br>
oxo-hydroxy polymerisation commences. Preferably, it is a<br>
more acidic pH, more preferably below a pH of 2.<br>
(2)	The pH at which oxo-hydroxy polymerisation<br>
commences. This is always a different pH to that of the<br>
starting pH. Preferably, it is a less acidic pH and most<br>
preferably above a pH of 2.<br>
(3)	Final pH. This will always promote precipitation and<br>
may promote agglomeration of the solid ligand-modified<br>
poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion material and preferably will be<br>
a higher pH than the pH at which oxo-hydroxy<br>
polymerisation commences. It will be appreciated by the<br>
skilled person that where a pH difference exists between<br>
commencement of oxo-hydroxy polymerisation and the final<br>
pH value, addition of further M, L, OH-, H+, excipients or<br>
other substances may be undertaken before the final pH<br>
value is achieved.<br>
(4)	Rate of pH change from commencement of oxo-hydroxy<br>
 <br>
polymerisation to completion of reaction. This will occur<br>
within a 24 hour period, preferably within an hour period<br>
and most preferably within 20 minutes.<br>
Concentrations of M and L. While the concentration of OH<br>
is established by the pH during oxo-hydroxy<br>
polymerisation, the concentrations of total M and total L<br>
in the system will be fixed by the starting amounts in the<br>
ML mix and the final solution volume. Typically, this<br>
will exceed 10-6 molar for both M and L and more<br>
preferably it will exceed 10-3 molar. Concentrations of M<br>
and L are independent and chosen for one or more desired<br>
characteristics of the final material and especially so<br>
that the concentration of M is not too high such that the<br>
rate of oxo-hydroxy polymerisation occurs too rapidly and<br>
prevents L incorporation. Similarly the concentration of<br>
L will not be too high to prevent metal oxo-hydroxy<br>
polymerisation. For example, the ligand-modified poly<br>
oxo-hydroxy materials in which M is ferric iron are<br>
produced preferably with iron concentrations of the<br>
initial solution below 300 mM and most preferably below<br>
200 mM, providing ranges of ferric iron concentrations<br>
between between 1mM and 300mM, more preferably between<br>
20mM and 200mM, and most preferably of about 40mM.<br>
(5)	Solution phase. The preferred solution for this work<br>
is aqueous and most preferably is water.<br>
(6)	Buffer. The solution may have a buffer added to help<br>
stabilise the pH range of oxo-hydroxy polymerisation.<br>
Buffers may be inorganic or organic, and in some<br>
embodiments will not be involved in formal bonding with<br>
the metal ion(s) M of the solid phase material.<br>
Alternatively, one or more of the ligands L involved in<br>
formal bonding with the metal ion(s) M of the solid phase<br>
material may have some buffering capacity that is<br>
additionally favourable in achieving the desired<br>
 <br>
composition of the final material. Buffer concentrations<br>
are less than 500 mM, preferably less than 200 mM and most<br>
preferably less than 100 mM.<br>
(7)	Temperature. The preferred temperature is above 0<br>
and below 100°C, typically between room temperature (20-<br>
30°C) and 100°C, most typically at room temperature.<br>
(8)	Ionic strength. Electrolyte such as, but not limited<br>
to, potassium chloride and sodium chloride, may be used in<br>
the procedure. The ionic strength of the solution may thus<br>
range from that solely derived from the components and<br>
conditions outlined in (1)-(8) above or from the further<br>
addition of electrolyte which may be up to 10% (w/v),<br>
preferably up to 2%, and most preferably 
(9)	Extent of mixing of the components. This issue<br>
mainly relates to degree of stirring and preferably<br>
stirring is achieved such that the starting solutions<br>
(i.e. M, L and buffer) are rapidly mixed and maintained<br>
homogenous throughout.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that while<br>
the above variables may all control the physico-chemical<br>
nature of the precipitate, further variables such as the<br>
collection system and/or excipients used for the recovery<br>
of the precipitate, which may involve purposeful<br>
inhibition of agglomeration, its drying and its grinding<br>
may subsequently affect the material properties. However,<br>
these are general variables to any such system for solid<br>
extraction from a solution phase. After separation of the<br>
precipitated material, it may optionally be dried before<br>
use of further formulation. The dried product may,<br>
however, retain some water and be in the form of a<br>
hydrated solid phase ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
metal ion material. It will be apparent to those skilled<br>
in the art that at any of the stages described herein for<br>
 <br>
recovery of the solid phase, excipients may be added that<br>
mix with the ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion<br>
material but do not modify the primary particle and are<br>
used with a view to optimising formulation for the<br>
intended function of the material. Examples of these<br>
could be, but are not limited to, glycolipids,<br>
phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidyl choline), sugars and<br>
polysaccharides, sugar alcohols (e.g. glycerol), polymers<br>
(e.g. polyethyleneglycol (PEG)) and taurocholic acid.<br>
Formulations and Uses<br>
The solid phase materials of the present invention may be<br>
formulated for use in a range of biologically relevant<br>
applications, including formulation for use as<br>
pharmaceutical, nutritional, cosmetic, or personal hygiene<br>
compositions. The compositions of the present invention<br>
may comprise, in addition to one or more of the solid<br>
phase materials of the invention, a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer, stabiliser or other<br>
materials well known to those skilled in the art. Such<br>
materials should be non-toxic and should not interfere<br>
with the efficacy of the solid phase materials for the<br>
application in question.<br>
The precise nature of the carrier or other component may<br>
be related to the manner or route of administration of the<br>
composition. These compositions may be delivered by a<br>
range of delivery routes including, but not limited to:<br>
gastrointestinal delivery, including orally and per<br>
rectum; parenteral delivery, including injection; dermal<br>
delivery including patches, creams etc; mucosal delivery,<br>
including nasal, inhalation and via pessary; or by implant<br>
at specific sites, including prosthetics that may be used<br>
for this purpose or mainly for another purpose but have<br>
 <br>
this benefit.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be<br>
in a tablet, capsule, powder, gel or liquid form. A<br>
tablet may include a solid carrier such as gelatin or an<br>
adjuvant. Capsules may have specialised properties such<br>
as an enteric coating. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions<br>
generally include a liquid carrier such as water,<br>
petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or<br>
synthetic oil. Physiological saline solution, dextrose or<br>
other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene<br>
glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol may be<br>
included. Where the solid ligand-modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy metal ion material needs to be maintained in a<br>
solid form, e.g. to control the delivery of a component of<br>
the material, it may be necessary to select components of<br>
the formulation accordingly, e.g. where a liquid<br>
formulation of the material is made.<br>
For intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, or<br>
injection at the site of affliction, the active ingredient<br>
will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous<br>
solution or suspension which is pyrogen-free and has<br>
suitable pH, isotonicity and stability. Those of relevant<br>
skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable<br>
solutions using, for example, isotonic vehicles such as<br>
Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Lactated<br>
Ringer's Injection. Preservatives, stabilisers, buffers,<br>
antioxidants and/or other additives may be included, as<br>
required.<br>
The materials and compositions used in accordance with the<br>
present invention that are to be given to an individual<br>
are preferably administered in a "prophylactically<br>
 <br>
effective amount" or a "therapeutically effective amount"<br>
(as the case may be, although prophylaxis may be<br>
considered therapy), this being sufficient to show benefit<br>
to the individual (e.g. bioavailability). The actual<br>
amount administered, and rate and time-course of<br>
administration, will depend on the nature and severity of<br>
what is being treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g.<br>
decisions on dosage etc, is within the responsibility of<br>
general practitioners and other medical doctors, and<br>
typically takes account of the disorder to be treated, the<br>
condition of the individual patient, the site of delivery,<br>
the method of administration and other factors known to<br>
practitioners. Examples of the techniques and protocols<br>
mentioned above can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, 20th Edition, 2000, Lippincott, Williams &amp;<br>
Wilkins. A composition may be administered alone or in<br>
combination with other treatments, either simultaneously<br>
or sequentially, dependent upon the condition to be<br>
treated.<br>
Examples of the uses of the solid ligand-modified poly<br>
oxo-hydroxy metal ion materials disclosed herein include,<br>
but are not limited to, uses as: dietary mineral<br>
supplements and fortificants; therapeutic mineral<br>
supplements (e.g. as administered by i.v. and oral<br>
routes); drugs, nutrients or cosmetic carriers/co-<br>
complexes; phosphate binding agents; other binding or<br>
sequestering applications; food additives; anti-<br>
perspirants; sun-protection agents; vaccine adjuvants;<br>
immuno-modulatory agents; direct cosmetic applications<br>
including exfoliating agents; bone and dental<br>
filler/cements; implant materials including brachytherapy,<br>
and imaging and contrast agents.<br>
 <br>
Ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxide materials may be used<br>
as supplements for nutritional or medical benefit. In<br>
this area, there are three main examples:<br>
(i) Therapeutic (prescription) supplements, which are<br>
generally administered by the oral or i.v. routes for the<br>
treatment of indications including iron deficiency<br>
anaemia, iron deficiency and anaemia of chronic disease.<br>
The therapeutic administration of materials of the present<br>
invention may be in conjunction with other therapies and<br>
especially with the concomitant use of erythropoietin.<br>
(ii) Nutritional (self prescribed/purchased supplements)<br>
which are usually for oral delivery.<br>
(iii) Fortificants. These may be traditional forms- in<br>
terms of being added to food prior to purchase - or more<br>
recent fortificant forms such as 'Sprinkles' which are<br>
added (like salt or pepper) to food at the time of<br>
ingestion.<br>
In all formats, but most especially for fortificants,<br>
subsequent formulation, such as addition of a protective<br>
coating (e.g. lipid), may be necessary to make the<br>
material compatible with its intended usage. In addition,<br>
any of these supplemental forms can be co-formulated,<br>
either by incorporation within the material through use of<br>
co-formulated material(s) as ligand(s) or through<br>
trapping/encapsulation of said materials, or simply<br>
through co-delivery of said materials.<br>
As described herein, one particular application of the<br>
solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion materials<br>
of the present invention is for the treatment of mineral<br>
 <br>
deficiencies, for example iron deficiency. In an<br>
alternative application the materials may be employed to<br>
bind or sequester a component present in an individual.<br>
By way of example, the ferric iron compositions disclosed<br>
herein may be used to deliver iron to an individual for<br>
use in the prophylaxis or treatment of iron deficiency or<br>
iron deficiency anaemia which may be suspected, or<br>
diagnosed through standard haematological and clinical<br>
chemistry techniques. Iron deficiency and iron deficiency<br>
anaemia may occur in isolation, for example due to<br>
inadequate nutrition or due to excessive iron losses, or<br>
they may be associated with stresses such as pregnancy or<br>
lactation, or they may be associated with diseases such as<br>
inflammatory disorders, cancers and renal insufficiency.<br>
In addition, there is evidence that the reduced<br>
erythropoiesis associated with anaemia of chronic disease<br>
may be improved or corrected by the effective delivery of<br>
systemic iron and that co-delivery of iron with<br>
erythropoietin or its analogues may be especially<br>
effective in overcoming reduced erthropoietic activity.<br>
Thus, by way of further example, the ferric iron<br>
compositions disclosed herein may be used to deliver iron<br>
to an individual for use in the treatment of sub-optimal<br>
erythropoietic activity such as in anaemia of chronic<br>
disease. Anaemia of chronic disease may be associated<br>
with conditions such as renal insufficiency, cancer and<br>
inflammatory disorders. As noted above, iron deficiency<br>
may also commonly occur in these disorders so it follows<br>
that treatment through iron supplementation may address<br>
iron deficiency alone and/or anaemia of chronic disease.<br>
It will be recognised by those skilled in the art that the<br>
above examples of the medical uses of iron supplements are<br>
by no means limiting.<br>
 <br>
Experimental Description<br>
Introduction<br>
Inorganic mineral-based materials have widespread<br>
biological applications that include: dietary supplements,<br>
phosphate binding agents, antacids, immune adjuvants<br>
(alum) and antiperspirants (alum). These are often co-<br>
formulated in such a way that the mineral physico-chemical<br>
properties, such as rates of dissolution and/or<br>
disaggregation, are modestly altered in an attempt to<br>
improve their efficacy. We have however developed a<br>
procedure whereby the actual structure, at the level of<br>
the primary particle (the primary unit within the lattice<br>
structure), can be modified within oxide/hydroxide<br>
minerals. This nano-structuring can lead to profound<br>
changes in mineral characteristics and can be tuned to<br>
provide mineral with precisely specified physico-chemical<br>
characteristics. Moreover the methodology is cheap and<br>
can be applied on as large a scale as required. The<br>
modifying agents are all biologically compatible, food<br>
grade ligands allowing rapid introduction of novel<br>
materials to human subjects. An exemplar of these<br>
materials is the production of a novel class of iron<br>
supplements that may have therapeutic parenteral and oral<br>
applications, as well as widespread roles as fortificants<br>
and dietary supplements.<br>
With supplements, we believe that one desirable property<br>
is that the rate of nutrient absorption mimics that seen<br>
for the same nutrient when ingested in a food. For<br>
example, with iron, the rate of dietary iron absorption<br>
can be controlled through the rate of iron dissolution.<br>
In the following examples, we have produced a number of<br>
different solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion<br>
materials using the process of the present invention, with<br>
 <br>
the aim of identifying compositions that release iron in a<br>
controlled fashion. The aim is that the rate of<br>
dissolution will allow the ferric iron to be donated to<br>
the mucosal reductase (DcytB) in a fashion that prevents<br>
build up of iron in the lumen or bolus absorption into the<br>
circulation- neither of which are desirable. Thus the<br>
ferric iron compositions of the present invention should<br>
have lower gastrointestinal side effects as they will not<br>
undergo facile redox cycling in the gut. In addition,<br>
there is scope to design the compositions to dissolve<br>
differently at gastric pH versus intestinal pH. There is<br>
also the possibility of tailoring the compositions to<br>
dissolve at different rates depending upon the<br>
concentration of iron in the local solution (e.g. the gut<br>
lumen) , such that the compositions may 'sense' iron<br>
requirements of the environment and thus iron requirements<br>
of the individual. The remaining, unabsorbed luminal iron<br>
would be largely unavailable for undesirable redox<br>
reactivity within the lumen and would pass harmlessly into<br>
the faeces.<br>
Nomenclature of materials<br>
Throughout the examples the FeOHLA-i: j-LBk nomenclature<br>
was adopted to describe the preparation for ligand-<br>
modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron materials; where LA<br>
refers to the ligand with higher solution affinity and LB<br>
to the ligand with lower solution affinity for iron. The<br>
ratio i:j refers to the molar ratio between iron (Fe) and<br>
ligand A (LA) and k refers to the concentration (mM)of<br>
ligand B(LB)in solution prior to the precipitation of<br>
ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric materials. Where<br>
only a weaker ligand (ligand B) was present the<br>
nomenclature used was FeOH LBk. For example, the material<br>
defined as FeOHT-3:1-Ad20 was prepared using a molar ratio<br>
 <br>
of three Fe to one tartrate and a concentration of adipate<br>
of 20 mM. The iron concentration in solution was 40 mM<br>
unless stated otherwise in the figure legends.<br>
Materials<br>
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset,<br>
UK, unless otherwise specified. All laboratory ware was<br>
in polypropylene. The materials used in the preparation<br>
of the ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron<br>
materials for the in vivo study were prepared with food<br>
grade chemicals or pharmaceutical grade chemicals also<br>
from Sigma-Aldrich, with the exception of the 58Fe<br>
elemental iron used in the preparation of the 58Fe ferric<br>
chloride which was purchased from Chemgas, Boulogne,<br>
France.<br>
Methods<br>
Screening assay<br>
A series of dietary ligands was tested in a screening<br>
assay for their effects on the formation of solid ligand-<br>
modif ied poly oxo-hydroxy metal ion materials. Briefly,<br>
in a centrifuge tube, a fixed volume of stock solution of<br>
ferric iron (400mM FeCl3 with 50mM MOPS, pH 1.4) was mixed<br>
with varying volumes of a stock solution of ligand (400mM<br>
with the exception of maltol which was 200mM, plus MOPS at<br>
50mM and 0.9% NaCl) to obtain the desired metal: ligand<br>
ratio. The volumes were then equally adjusted to parity<br>
with a solution of 50mM.MOPS and 0.9% NaCl. All the<br>
solutions obtained at this stage were fully soluble at pH<br>

iron concentration and then the pH was raised to -6.5 by<br>
drop-wise addition of concentrated NaOH to avoid high<br>
volume changes. After centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10<br>
minutes, an aliquot of supernatant was taken to analyse<br>
 <br>
the iron remaining in solution. The remaining supernatant<br>
was discarded and a fixed volume of dissolution buffer at<br>
pH 6 (MOPS 10mM) or pH 4 (Acetic acid 10mM) was then added<br>
to the wet solid of each tube and incubated overnight at<br>
room temperature. The tubes were then centrifuged (2500<br>
rpm for 10 minutes) and an aliquot of supernatant taken to<br>
determine the iron that was disaggregated. The iron<br>
concentration in each aliquot was measured by ICPOES<br>
analysis.<br>
Titration experiments<br>
An acidic concentrated stock solution of iron (as ferric<br>
chloride) was added to a solution containing either the<br>
ligand A, ligand B or both ligand A and B at appropriate<br>
concentrations to obtain the desired M:L ratios. In some<br>
cases 0.9% w/v of electrolyte (for example NaCl or KCl)<br>
was also added. The solution was mixed thoroughly and an<br>
aliquot collected for analysis of the "starting iron"<br>
concentration. The pH of the solution was always 
the iron fully solubilised. Next the pH was slowly<br>
increased by drop-wise addition of a concentrated solution<br>
of NaOH with constant agitation until the mixture reached<br>
a basic pH (generally &gt;8.0). At different points during<br>
the titration, a homogeneous aliquot (lmL) of the mixture<br>
was collected and transferred to an Eppendorf tube. Any<br>
aggregate formed was separated from the solution by<br>
centrifugation (10 minutes at 13000 rpm). The iron<br>
concentration in the supernatant was assessed by ICPOES.<br>
In some cases the supernatant was analysed for the<br>
presence of aquated particulate iron and the size<br>
distribution was measured (see below). When aquated<br>
particulate iron was present, the supernatant was<br>
ultrafiltrated (Vivaspin 3,000 Da molecular weight cut-off<br>
polyethersulfone membrane, Sartorius Stedium Biotech GmbH,<br>
 <br>
Goettingen, Germany) and the iron concentration in the<br>
filtrate, i.e. "soluble iron", was analysed by ICPOES.<br>
Preparation of solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
ferric iron materials<br>
The materials were prepared following a protocol similar<br>
to the titration experiment described above. Briefly, an<br>
acidic concentrated stock solution of iron was added to a<br>
solution containing either the ligand A, ligand B or both<br>
ligand A and B. In some cases 0.9% w/v of electrolyte was<br>
also added. The "starting pH" of the solution was always<br>

slowly increased by drop-wise addition of a concentrated<br>
solution of NaOH with constant agitation until reaching<br>
the desired final pH.<br>
When preparing the solid material as a pellet, the entire<br>
mixture was then transferred to a centrifuge bottle and<br>
spun at 4500 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatant was<br>
discarded and the aggregated solid phase collected in a<br>
petri dish. When necessary, the solid was then dried in<br>
an oven at 45 °C for a minimum of 8 hours. Alternatively,<br>
the mixture (precipitate and supernatant) was freeze-dried<br>
at -20 °C and 0.4 mbar.<br>
When preparing the solid material as aguated particulate<br>
material, the total mixture was either freeze-dried as<br>
above, or concentrated. by ultrafiltration (Vivaspin 3000<br>
Da molecular weight cut-off polyethersulfone membrane,<br>
Sartorius Stedium Biotech GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) and<br>
then air dried in an oven at 45 °C for a minimum of 8<br>
hours. In some cases the mixture was dialysed (1,000 Da<br>
regenerated cellulose membrane Spectra/pro 7, Cole-Parmer,<br>
London, UK) in water to remove excess iron, ligands and<br>
 <br>
electrolytes before undergoing one of the drying processes<br>
described above.<br>
When using bicarbonate as ligand B a variation of this<br>
protocol was used to avoid release of CO2 from<br>
transformation of bicarbonate at acidic pH. The starting<br>
solution containing ligand A (when applicable) and<br>
bicarbonate was prepared at pH 8.5. The appropriate<br>
volume of acidic concentrated stock solution of iron was<br>
then added drop-wise in conjunction with NaOH pellets<br>
(progressively added to the mixture as required) in order<br>
to always maintain a pH &gt;7.5. The final pH of the<br>
preparation was 8.5.<br>
Disaggregation assay<br>
Known amounts of solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
ferric iron materials were added into tubes (about 3 mg<br>
iron per tube). Then, 3 mL of buffer (see below) were<br>
added and the tubes shaken vigorously and incubated at<br>
room temperature overnight. After centrifugation at 4500<br>
rpm for 15 minutes to separate the aggregated solid phase<br>
from the aquated phase, an aliquot of supernatant was<br>
collected to measure the disaggregated iron concentration.<br>
The remaining supernatant was discarded. The mass of<br>
remaining material (i.e. the wet pellet) was recorded.<br>
Concentrated HNO3 was added to this pellet and the new<br>
mass recorded. The tubes were left at room temperature<br>
until all the pellet dissolved and an aliquot was<br>
collected for ICPOES analysis to determine the iron<br>
concentration in the wet pellet.<br>
The buffers were either 50mM MOPS with 0.9% NaCl at pH<br>
7.0; 50mM Maleic acid with 0.9% NaCl at pH 5.8-6.0 and<br>
1.8-2.2; 50mM sodium acetate/ 50mM acetic acid glacial<br>
 <br>
with 0.9% NaCl at pH 4.0-4.5.<br>
In vitro gastrointestinal digestion assay<br>
An amount of the solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
ferric iron materials or control iron materials namely<br>
ferrous sulphate, ferric chloride, or unmodified ferric<br>
oxo-hydroxide, equivalent to 60mg elemental iron, were<br>
added to a synthetic gastric (stomach) solution (50 mL of<br>
2 g/L NaCl, 0.15 M HCl and 0.3mg/mL porcine pepsin) and<br>
incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes with radial shaking.<br>
Then 5 mL of the resulting gastric mixture was added to 30<br>
mL of synthetic duodenal solution (containing 10g/L<br>
pancreatin and 2g/L NaCl in 50mM bicarbonate buffer pH<br>
9.5). The final volume was 35 mL and the final pH was<br>
7.0. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 min with<br>
radial shaking. Homogeneous Aliquots (1mL) were collected<br>
at different time points during the process and<br>
centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the<br>
aggregate and aquated phases. The supernatant was<br>
analysed for iron content by ICPOES. At the end of the<br>
experiment, the remaining solution was centrifuged at<br>
4,500 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant analysed for Fe<br>
content by ICPOES. The mass of remaining material (i.e.<br>
the wet pellet) was recorded. Concentrated HNO3 was added<br>
to this wet pellet and the new mass recorded. The tubes<br>
were left at room temperature until all the pellet<br>
dissolved and an aliquot was collected for ICPOES analysis<br>
to determine the quantity of iron that did not<br>
disaggregate / dissolve. The starting amount of iron was<br>
calculated from the iron in the wet pellet plus the iron<br>
in the supernatant.<br>
To differentiate between soluble iron and aquated<br>
particulate iron in the supernatant, at each time point,<br>
 <br>
this fraction was also ultrafiltered (Vivaspin 3,000 Da<br>
molecular weight cut-off polyethersulfone membrane,<br>
Sartorius Stedium Biotech GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) and<br>
again analysed by ICPOES.<br>
The gastrointestinal digestion of commercial iron<br>
preparations was also tested with this assay using the<br>
dose of total iron recommended by the manufacturers:<br>
Ferric pyrophosphate 14mg (Lipofer, Boots); ferrous<br>
bisglycinate 20mg (Gentle iron, Solgar); ferric-hydroxide<br>
polymaltose complex 80mg (Maltofer, Ferrum Hausmann);<br>
ferric tri-maltol 30mg (Trimaltol, Iron Unlimited).<br>
Modified in vitro gastrointestinal digestion assay<br>
The particle size of the ligand-modif ied poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
ferric iron materials under simulated gastric and<br>
intestinal conditions was determined using an adapted "in<br>
vitro gastrointestinal digestion assay" in which no<br>
protein was in solution. The absence of proteins was<br>
required to measure particle size as these interfere with<br>
the measurement but the procedure was otherwise identical<br>
to the "in vitro gastrointestinal digestion assay" with<br>
extra aliquots being collected at various time points for<br>
the determination of particle size.<br>
Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy<br>
analysis (ICPOES)<br>
Iron contents of solutions or solids (including wet<br>
solids) were measured using a JY2000-2 ICPOES (Horiba<br>
Jobin Yvon Ltd., Stanmore, U.K.) at the iron specific<br>
wavelength of 259.940 nm. Solutions were diluted in 5%<br>
nitric acid prior to analysis while solids were digested<br>
with concentrated HNO3. The percentage of iron in<br>
solution or solid phase was determined by the difference<br>
 <br>
between the starting iron content and either the iron in<br>
the soluble phase or the iron in the solid phase depending<br>
on the assay.<br>
Determination of particle size<br>
The size distribution of micron-sized particles was<br>
determined using a Mastersizer 2000 with a Hydro-µP<br>
dispersion unit (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK) and<br>
nano-sized particles were determined with a Zetasizer Nano<br>
ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK). Mastersizer<br>
measurements required no sample pre-treatment whereas<br>
centrifugation was needed to remove large particles prior<br>
to Zetasizer measurements.<br>
Structural analysis<br>
Transmission Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-<br>
ray Analysis(EDX)<br>
Powder samples were analysed by first dispersing the<br>
powder in methanol and then drop-casting on standard holey<br>
carbon TEM support films. Commercial tablets were<br>
similarly analysed but were first crushed to release the<br>
powder. Analysis were undertaken by the Institute for<br>
Materials Research, University of Leeds, UK.<br>
Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy<br>
Powder samples were analysed by first dispersing the<br>
powder in methanol and then drop-casting on standard holey<br>
carbon TEM support films. Commercial tablets were<br>
similarly analysed but were first crushed to release the<br>
powder. Analysis were undertaken by aberration-corrected<br>
scanning transmission electron microscopy (Daresbury;<br>
superSTEM).<br>
infrared Analysis (IR)<br>
 <br>
IR spectra were collected using a DurasamplIR diamond ATR<br>
accessory with a Nicolet Avatar 360 spectrometer with a<br>
wavelength range of 4000-650cm-1 and resolution of 4cm"1.<br>
Analysis were undertaken by ITS Testing Services (UK) Ltd,<br>
Sunbury on Thames, OK.<br>
X-Ray Diffraction Analysis<br>
Samples were analysed as dry powders. Commercial tablets<br>
were crushed to release the powder. Analysis was by X-ray<br>
diffraction analysis at the University of Cambridge using<br>
a Philips X'Pert PW3020 (theta/2theta, 2 motors) with up<br>
to 14 hour scan time and 5-70° 2theta on CuKalpha.<br>
In vivo absorption study<br>
Subjects<br>
Healthy young women (aged 18-45 years) with mild iron<br>
deficiency anaemia (defined as haemoglobin between 10-11.9<br>
g/dL plus either serum ferritin below 20µg/L or<br>
transferrin saturation below 10%); or clear iron<br>
deficiency (defined as serum ferritin below 12µg/L) were<br>
recruited to take part in the study. Exclusion criteria<br>
were pregnancy or lactation and known coeliac disease,<br>

last ten years, known history of hereditary<br>
haemochromatosis or haemoglobinopathies, current<br>
medication that could alter iron metabolism, recent blood<br>
donation/heavy blood loss (in the past 3 months).<br>
Subjects who regularly consume vitamin and mineral<br>
supplements were asked to discontinue supplementation 2<br>
weeks before the screening for the study. Written<br>
 <br>
informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The study<br>
protocol was approved by the Suffolk Local Research Ethics<br>
Committee.<br>
Study design<br>
The experimental treatment was either a single dose of<br>
58Fe labeled ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron<br>
material (60 mg total iron) or ferrous sulphate (65 mg<br>
total iron). Ferrous sulphate is used as a reference dose<br>
to control for individuals who are poor absorbers (defined<br>
as those who have no significant net area under the curve<br>
(AUC) for plasma iron following ferrous sulphate<br>
ingestion). A crossover study design was used with each<br>
volunteer acting as her own control.<br>
Fe absorption was based on erythrocyte incorporation of<br>
the 58Fe stable-isotope label 14 days after the intake of<br>
labelled iron test compounds. The test compounds and the<br>
reference compound (ferrous sulphate) were, taken (with or<br>
without breakfast), under strictly standardised conditions<br>
and close supervision, after an overnight fast with 14<br>
days interval. No intake of food or fluids (apart from<br>
water) was allowed for 4 h after the iron compound intake.<br>
Ten blood samples (12 mL) were taken during each of the 2<br>
visits to determine the absorption of Fe at the following<br>
times: before intake and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 210 and 240<br>
minutes after intake of the iron compound. An additional<br>
blood sample was taken at baseline (before intake) to<br>
confirm iron status (full blood count, ferritin, soluble<br>
transferrin receptor, transferrin saturation) and<br>
determine erythrocyte S8Fe incorporation.<br>
Total serum iron concentration was analysed by a standard<br>
 <br>
clinical chemistry procedure based on the method by Smith<br>
et al using the chromophore Ferene®.<br>
RBC incorporation of 58Fe was determined using an Elan DRC<br>
Plus Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (Perkin<br>
Elmer Sciex, Beaconsfield, UK). The sample introduction<br>
system consisted of a V-groove nebuliser, a double-pass<br>
spray chamber, a demountable quartz torch, and a quartz<br>
injector (2 mm internal diameter). Platinum-tipped<br>
sampler and skimmer cones (Perkin Elmer Sciex,<br>
Beaconsfield, UK) were used for all analyses. Baseline<br>
whole blood samples were collected from participants in<br>
the study immediately prior to administration of a 60 mg<br>
oral Pe supplement labelled with 2mg 58Pe, and a second<br>
blood sample was collected 14 days after administration.<br>
Whole blood was diluted 100-fold with an aqueous solution<br>
containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% butan-1-ol, 0.5% ammonia,<br>
and 0.007 % nitric acid. Instrument conditions were tuned<br>
for optimum signal sensitivity (via the measurement of<br>
24Mg, 115In and 238U isotopes) , minimum oxide formation (via<br>
the measurement of the 140Ce and 155Gd isotopes to allow<br>
monitoring of the degree of CeO formation at m/z = 155)<br>
and minimum doubly charged ion formation (via the<br>
measurement of the 138Ba and 69Ga isotope signals to allow<br>
monitoring of the degree of 138Ba2+ formation at m/z = 69) .<br>
Further adjustment was then performed to reduce mass bias<br>
between 58Fe and 57Pe (approximately 5%) . Detector<br>
voltages were dropped from the typical -2400 and 1550 V to<br>
-1725 and 1050 V for analogue and pulse stages,<br>
respectively.<br>
Preparation of 58Fe labelled ferric chloride solution<br>
A solution of 58Pe labelled ferric chloride was prepared<br>
by dissolving 100 mg 58Pe enriched elemental iron<br>
 <br>
(Chemgas, Boulogne, France) in 4 mL 37% HCl in a pear-<br>
shaped glass flask attached to a condenser and heated at<br>
48°C in a water bath. The temperature was raised<br>
gradually over time to keep the solution boiling as the<br>
concentration of chlorine dropped. When the elemental<br>
iron powder was dissolved, 0.5 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide<br>
were added to oxidize ferrous iron to ferric iron. The<br>
flask was then sealed, once the oxidation reaction<br>
finished, i.e. once the formation of O2 bubbles stopped.<br>
The concentration of iron in the final solution was<br>
determined by ICPOES and the Ferrozine assay was used to<br>
confirm the absence of ferrous iron.<br>
Preparation of the 58Fe labelled ligand modified poly<br>
oxo-hydroxy ferric iron material<br>
The chosen ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron<br>
materials enriched with 58Fe were prepared following the<br>
protocol described above (see Preparation of solid ligand-<br>
modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron materials) using a<br>
ferric chloride stock solution containing 3.5% w/w 58Fe (2<br>
mg of 58Fe per 60 mg total iron in the ingested solid<br>
material) from the 58Fe labelled ferric chloride solution<br>
discussed above.<br>
Results and discussion<br>
Effect of Ligand A<br>
A series of ligands, namely maltol, succinic acid, citric<br>
acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, gluconic<br>
acid, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine and<br>
glutamine, were studied for their effect on ferric poly<br>
oxo-hydroxide precipitation from solution.<br>
Initially, the ligands were all tested using the screening<br>
assay described above at ratios of 1:1 to 1:5 and<br>
 <br>
classified in three groups. The first group, "strong<br>
ligands", were ligands found to inhibit the formation of<br>
80% of the solid material at ratio 1:1 and included<br>
gluconic acid, citric acid and maltol. The second group,<br>
"weak ligands", were ligands found to have little effect<br>
on the amount of solid material formed (
ratios tested) and included aspartic acid, succinic acid,<br>
lactic acid, glutamic acid and histidine. The third<br>
group, "intermediate ligands", were ligands found to have<br>
an influence, between strong and weak ligands, on the<br>
amount of solid material formed at, at least, one of the<br>
ratios tested and included malic acid, tartaric acid and<br>
glutamine.<br>
In a second instance, six ligands from the three groups<br>
described above were re-screened for their effects on both<br>
the formation of ferric poly oxo-hydroxide precipitation<br>
at varying M:L ratios, and the dissolution of the solid<br>
materials formed in pH 6 and pH 4 buffers (see screening<br>
assay above). As expected, the ligands had variable<br>
effects on the percentage of poly oxo-hydroxy iron that<br>
was precipitated depending upon (a) the group the ligand<br>
belonged to and (b) the M:L ratio. Yet, the solid<br>
materials formed, showed variable re-aquation properties<br>
that were not predictable from the precipitation<br>
behaviours. Examples of results using a strong affinity<br>
ligand, namely maltol, a weak affinity ligand, namely<br>
succinate, and an intermediate affinity ligand, namely<br>
tnalate, are shown in Figures 1A and B. Re-dissolution<br>
clearly depends upon the ligand and its ratio to iron<br>
which may be expected. What is not expected is that the<br>
strong ligand, maltol, did not promote any re-dissolution<br>
of the iron at pH 6.0 in spite of the fact that soluble<br>
iron-maltol complexes can be formed (for at least a<br>
 <br>
proportion of the iron) at this pH. Moreover, the<br>
intermediate ligand, malate, allowed greater dissolution<br>
of iron from the solid phase at pH 6.0 than the strong<br>
ligand maltol - even when ratios were matched (c.f. 1:1).<br>
Examples of further results with other ligands or ratios<br>
are shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1: The effect of single Uganda on poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
iron precipitation and the re-dissolution of that iron.<br>
 <br>
Two ligands, namely raalate and tartrate, that showed most<br>
effects in the screening assay, were chosen for study in<br>
greater detail. The re-dissolution profile was studied<br>
using a more defined assay in four different buffers (see<br>
Disaggregation Assay in Methods). The buffers contained<br>
0.9% w/v electrolyte so that the results obtained would<br>
reflect the behaviour of the material in a biological<br>
ionic strength environment. Also the pH environments were<br>
chosen to reflect different parts of the gastrointestinal<br>
tract from gastric (pH 1.8) to intestinal (pH 7.0).<br>
Firstly, the results shown in Table 2 confirmed that the<br>
two ligands affected not only the precipitation but also<br>
the disaggregation profile depending on the ratio used in<br>
the preparation of the ferric poly oxo-hydroxide materials<br>
as seen in the screening assay above. Generally,<br>
increasing the ligand ratio decreased the formation of the<br>
 <br>
ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron solid<br>
material and increased the disaggregation profile.<br>
However, the extent of the effect seen with one ligand did<br>
not reflect the extent of the effect seen with another<br>
ligand as illustrated here with malate and tartrate. The<br>
results observed were reproducible as indicated in table 2<br>
with malate at M:L ratio 1:2.<br>
Table 2: Effect of malate and tartrate ratios on the<br>
percentage of iron precipitated as ligand-modified poly<br>
oxo-hydroxy ferric iron materials and the disaggregation<br>
of the materials.<br>
 <br>
Ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron materials<br>
were prepared at pH 6.5 in 50mM MOPS and 0.9% NaCl.<br>
Starting iron concentrations were 26.7mM. Precipitation<br>
steps were either carried out in individual tubes (a) as<br>
per the precipitation procedure described in Screening<br>
Assay, or as a batch (b) as per the preparation of solid<br>
ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron materials<br>
(see methods) . Disaggregation of all materials was<br>
performed according to the method outline in<br>
Dissagregation assay (see methods).<br>
Secondly, the effect of the ligand on the rate of<br>
 <br>
formation of the ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric<br>
iron materials was studied using the titration protocol<br>
described in the methods section. Figure 2 shows the rate<br>
of formation of the solid material with increasing pH.<br>
The addition of malate was found to delay the formation of<br>
the solid material compared to the absence of ligand.<br>
This scenario is to be expected when a ligand competes<br>
with the polymerisation of the poly oxo-hydroxy ferric<br>
iron entity that results in the formation of the solid<br>
material. However, unexpectedly, tartrate was found to<br>
have a promoting effect on the formation of the solid<br>
material at lower pH. This does not correlate with the<br>
competition, scenario described above. In this case the<br>
ligand, tartrate, appears to be enhancing the<br>
precipitation. Another observation was that tartrate, at<br>
basic pH (&gt;7.5), did promote disaggregation of this<br>
material. Indeed, Figure 16 shows a typical profile of<br>
the formation of two solid phases, namely aggregated and<br>
aquated tartrate-modified ferric poly oxo-hydroxide with<br>
increasing pHs following the titration protocol described<br>
in Methods. These results were also observed with other<br>
ligands A and ligands B (results not shown).<br>
The disaggregation profile of the ligand-modified poly<br>
oxo-hydroxy ferric iron solid material formed at different<br>
pHs was shown to vary as illustrated in Figure 3 for<br>
malate. As the pH of preparation of the material<br>
increases, the disaggregation profile decreases. This is<br>
in accordance with an increase of polymerisation and<br>
formation of oxo-bridges with increasing pH, probably<br>
limiting the modification effect of the ligand on the<br>
material.<br>
The presence of 0.9% w/v electrolyte, as sodium (NaCl) or<br>
 <br>
potassium chloride (KCl), in the preparation of the<br>
ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron solid<br>
materials was also studied. Figure 4A shows that the<br>
presence of 0.9% NaCl did not affect the disaggregation<br>
profile of the tartrate-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric<br>
iron material at M:L ratio 4:1 compared to the same<br>
material prepared without NaCl. Similarly, Figure 4B<br>
shows that the presence of 0.9% KCl did change the<br>
disaggregation profile of the tartrate-modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy ferric iron material at M:L ratio 2:1 (solution<br>
containing 50mM niacin).<br>
Finally, the effect of drying ligand-modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy ferric iron solid materials was studied with<br>
respect to disaggregation. Drying the material generally<br>
lead to a modest reduction in its disaggregation as<br>
exemplified by the tartrate-modified poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
ferric iron material at M:L ratio 4:1 which is illustrated<br>
in Figure 5. Small, inconsistent differences were<br>
observed between oven-drying and freeze-drying methods<br>
(Figure 5).<br>
Effect of ligand B<br>
Almost all of the studies described above were carried out<br>
with ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron solid<br>
materials produced in MOPS buffer. MOPS is often used in<br>
metal speciation studies due to its very weak interaction<br>
with most metal ions and hence it rarely interferes in the<br>
formation of metal complexes. However, MOPS has a pKa of<br>
7.2 and so has a buffering capacity around neutral pH.<br>
Thus, although MOPS would not interact directly with iron<br>
or prevent the formation of the solid material, it may<br>
indirectly influence the formation of the solid by<br>
controlling the rate of change in environmental pH. In<br>
 <br>
addition, the buffer used in the preparation of the<br>
ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron solid<br>
materials should be safe for human consumption which MOPS<br>
is not. Therefore, to study the influence of the buffer,<br>
or ligand B, on the formation and re-dissolution<br>
properties of the ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric<br>
iron solid materials, we selected a series of compounds<br>
with buffering capacity at varying pH ranges; namely, <br>
adipate, bicarbonate, acetate, glutarate, dimethyl<br>
glutarate, pimelate, succinate, vanillin, tryptophan,<br>
benzoate, propionate, borate, niacin and pyridoxine<br>
hydrochloride. Figure 6 illustrates the effect of<br>
changing MOPS for adipate on the rate of formation of the<br>
tartrate-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron solid<br>
material at M:L ratio 4:1 (Figure 6(i)), as well as its<br>
effect on the otherwise un-modified poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
ferric iron solid material (Figure 6(ii)). In both cases,<br>
adipate had a promoting effect on the rate of formation of<br>
the solid material.<br>
Following these observations, the formation and<br>
disaggregation profiles of the tartrate-modified oxo-<br>
hydroxy ferric iron solid materials were studied using<br>
varying M:L ratios. Adipate reduced the disaggregation<br>
capacity of the materials formed (Table 3) compared to<br>
MOPS (Table 2), except at gastric pH (pH 1.8) which showed<br>
low disaggregation capacity with both buffers. In<br>
contrast, in the case of malate-modified poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
ferric iron materials, bicarbonate had a negative<br>
influence on the percentage of precipitation and the<br>
disaggregation capacity of the material (Table 2 and 3).<br>
These effects fell off with lower concentrations of<br>
adipate but not bicarbonate (Table 3, data in bold).<br>
 <br>
The influence of ligand B on the disaggreagtion profile of<br>
the tartrate-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron solid<br>
material is further illustrated in Figure 7 with niacin<br>
and benzoate.<br>
 <br>
Tartrate-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron solid<br>
materials were prepared following the protocol<br>
"preparation of solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
ferric iron materials" (see methods) at pH 4.0 in either<br>
50mM adipate (Ad50) or 20mM adipate (Ad20) without the<br>
presence of an electrolyte. Malate-modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy ferric iron solid materials were prepared<br>
following the same procedure at pH 8.5 in either 100mM<br>
bicarbonate (BiclOO) or 25mM bicarbonate (Bic25) without<br>
the presence of an electrolyte. The disaggregation of the<br>
materials was performed according to the method outlined<br>
in Disaggregation assay (see method) using the non-dried<br>
material for FeOHT-Ad50 and FeOHM-Bic100 and the oven-<br>
dried material for FeOHT-Ad20 and FeOHM-Bic25.<br>
 <br>
Structural analysis of the solid ligand-modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy ferric iron materials<br>
The solid ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron<br>
materials prepared above differ from currently available<br>
iron formulations in that they are not a simple inorganic<br>
ferrous ion salt (e.g. ferrous sulphate), an iron complex<br>
in which the metal is coordinated with organic ligand<br>
(e.g. ferric trimaltol), nor an organic ligand coated iron<br>
mineral particle (e.g. iron polymaltose or 'Maltofer').<br>
The elemental analysis of particles from our solid ligand-<br>
modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron materials measured<br>
by Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) clearly shows<br>
the presence of carbon atoms in the iron- and oxygen-<br>
containing particles (an example is shown in Figure 8).<br>
Furthermore, the infrared spectrum of the material<br>
demonstrates the presence of a covalent-like bond between<br>
the ligand and the metal (Figure 9) in addition to the<br>
abundant presence of hydroxy groups. This illustrates<br>
that the ligand is incorporated into the structure of the<br>
metal oxo-hydroxide lattice through formal bonding and not<br>
simply adsorption or 'entrapment' . The changes to the<br>
dissolution characteristics of the material can be readily<br>
explained by the manner in which the ligand alters the<br>
metal-oxo-hydroxide lattice. In freshly precipitated iron<br>
oxo-hydroxide a ferrihydrite-like structure is observed<br>
with some clear crystalline regions; the addition of<br>
ligand B, in this case tryptophan, reduces the extent of<br>
crystallinity while the addition of ligand A and B, in<br>
this case trypotphan and tartrate, almost negate the<br>
crystallinity entirely (Figure 11). Maltofer, which is an<br>
organic ligand coated iron mineral particle, appeared more<br>
like freshly precipitated iron oxo-hydroxide, indicating<br>
 <br>
that the ligand had not significantly modified its primary<br>
structure. This comparison is best observed using X-ray<br>
diffraction where iron hydroxide peaks are not detected<br>
for a ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron<br>
material, but they are seen in Maltofer (Figure 12) albeit<br>
broad and noisy peaks due to the very small size of the<br>
primary particles (a few nanometres).<br>
Gastrointestinal digestion of the solid ligand-modified<br>
poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron materials<br>
We compared the disaggregation of some prior art and<br>
commercial iron compounds to that of the ligand-modified<br>
poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron materials under simulated<br>
gastrointestinal conditions (see Methods). The gastric<br>
disaggregation (pH1.2) and the gastric dissolution<br>
profiles of two of the ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
ferric iron materials, in comparison with ferrous<br>
sulphate, ferric oxo-hydroxide and iron polymaltose<br>
(Maltofer), are shown in Figure 10. Ferrous sulphate<br>
disaggregates and dissolves very well at acidic pH as is<br>
expected for a metal salt. Conversely, Maltofer<br>
disaggregates very rapidly in the gastric conditions<br>
(after 5 minutes almost 80% of the iron is disaggregated)<br>
but remains in an aquated particulate form (typically<br>
around 20 nm diameter: results not shown) (Figure 10).<br>
Percentage iron dissolution from Maltofer was less than 5%<br>
although it should be noted that there can be a loss of up<br>
to 10% of iron through binding to the ultrafiltration<br>
membrane. In comparison, the two novel ligand-modified<br>
poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron materials had an intermediate<br>
disaggregation profile compared to ferric oxo-hydroxide<br>
and ferrous sulphate. In addition, the dissolution of<br>
these materials closely paralleled the disaggregation<br>
profile under gastric conditions although this need not be<br>
 <br>
the case for these novel materials. These data show a<br>
clear difference between un-modified ferric oxo-hydroxide,<br>
Maltofer, ferrous sulfate, and our ligand-modified poly<br>
oxo-hydroxy ferric iron materials.<br>
Disaggregation of some of our novel ligand-modified poly<br>
oxo-hydroxy ferric iron materials under gastric and<br>
intestinal conditions was also compared to dissagregation<br>
of other commercially available iron compounds, namely<br>
ferric pyrophosphate, ferric chloride, ferric trimaltol<br>
and ferrous bisglycinate. The commercial compounds either<br>
failed to disaggregate properly (e.g. ferric<br>
pyrophosphate), or they disaggregated very rapidly (Figure<br>
14). This rapid disaggregation, if paralleled by<br>
dissolution, is believed to be responsible for giving rise<br>
to bolus delivery of iron ions in the gut lumen and<br>
likely, therefore, the occurrence of side effects. The<br>
novel ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron<br>
materials showed a degree of controlled release although,<br>
clear differences can be seen in the rates of<br>
disagreggation for the novel materials, indicating that<br>
their properties can be tailored as required (Figure 14).<br>
It should be noted in Figure 14 that whether iron remains<br>
in solution or not at pH 7.0 is merely a function of<br>
whether chelators/ligands are present (as they will<br>
naturally be in the gut) and so the data for ferrous<br>
sulphate and ferric chloride (where no ligand is present<br>
in the compound) should not be over-interpreted.<br>
Iron disaggregation and dissolution under both gastric and<br>
intestinal conditions for some ligand-modified poly oxo-<br>
hydroxy ferric iron materials that were tested further in<br>
human volunteers (see below) are presented in Figure 15.<br>
Again we show a range of different disaggregation and<br>
 <br>
dissolution profiles for the novel materials, illustrating<br>
the possibility of tailoring them as required.<br>
A study of the particle size distribution after passage<br>
through the modified gastrointestinal digestive assay of<br>
some tartrate-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron<br>
material is shown in Figure 17. Changing the M:L ratio<br>
(first vs second bar), pH of preparation (second vs third<br>
bar) and type of ligand B (fourth bar) clearly affects the<br>
size of particles obtained and therefore<br>
disaggregation/dissolution profiles. There is especially<br>
an increase in smaller particle sizes with increasing<br>
tartrate concentrations indicating less aggregation of the<br>
primary particles with increasing L content. In addition,<br>
the higher the pH of preparation, the smaller the<br>
resulting particle size.<br>
Iron absorption in humans of the solid 1 igand-modified<br>
poly oxo-hydroxy iron ferric materials<br>
Seven ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron<br>
materials have been assessed further for their absorption<br>
in human volunteers and the results compared with<br>
unmodified ferric oxo-hydroxide. A summary of the results<br>
is shown in Table 4.<br>
Table 4: In vivo absorption of different ligand-modified<br>
poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron materials:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Serum iron increase three hours after ingestion and<br>
percentage iron absorption (calculated as the red blood<br>
cell incorporation of 58Fe divided by 0.80) of solid<br>
ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy ferric iron materials.<br>
Mean ± SEM (n ranges from 2-4)/ * for PeOH at 180min there<br>
was a decrease from the baseline serum iron value.<br>
The serum absorption profiles of the compounds (Figure 13)<br>
show that the novel ligand-modified poly oxo-hydroxy<br>
ferric iron materials have much lower rates of iron<br>
absorption than ferrous sulphate which may be advantageous<br>
as this will prevent systemic exposure and potential<br>
damage from transiently high levels of iron. There was<br>
clear iron absorption from all formulations (Figure 13)<br>
and for at least one preparation this is estimated to be<br>
equivalent to ferrous sulphate. It is especially<br>
noteworthy that literature reports indicate that ferric<br>
polymaltose yields no detectable rise in serum iron<br>
following ingestion and, that absorption of iron is very<br>
low (Kaltwasser et al, 1987) and would be consistent with<br>
our data for ferric oxo-hydroxide.<br>
The compounds FeOHT-2:l-TRP15 and FeOHGluconic20 are<br>
examples of how changing the composition of these novel<br>
materials changes their serum iron profile but maintains<br>
the same percentage of iron absorption (Figure 13) again<br>
indicating that the materials can be tailored to achieve<br>
desired outcomes.<br>
