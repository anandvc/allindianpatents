				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION PROVIDING AN INCREASED BIOAVAILABILITY OF<br>
HYDROPHOBIC DRUGS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001] Field of the Invention: The present invention relates to formulations and<br>
dosage forms for the controlled delivery of hydrophobic drugs. In particular, the present<br>
invention provides self-emulsifying formulations and controlled release dosage forms that<br>
enhance the bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs.<br>
[0002] State of the Art: To ease dosing and improve patient compliance, it is<br>
10generally preferred to dose a desired drug using an oral dosage form rather than parenteral<br>
 administration. However, oral delivery of hydrophobic drug substances has proven<br>
challenging. In particular, hydrophobic drug substances tend to exhibit poor or inconsistent<br>
bioavailability when administered orally. As it is used herein, the term "bioavailability"<br>
refers to the amount of drug that reaches general blood circulation from an administered<br>
5dosage form. Often drug absorption in the gastro-intestinal tract is driven by the<br>
concentration gradient of the drag generated across the gastro-intestinal mucosal membrane<br>
("the mucosa" or "the mucosal membrane"), with the drug absorption increasing as the<br>
drag concentration, gradient increases. Because hydrophobic drugs do not readily dissolve<br>
in the aqueous gastro-intestinal environment, the concentration gradient generated by a<br>
20hydrophobic drag delivered to the gastro-intestinal tract is small, at best, and results in<br>
limited absorption of the drug across the mucosal membrane. The limited bioavailability of<br>
orally administered, hydrophobic drags is particularly problematic when it is considered<br>
that approximately 10% of currently marketed drags exhibit poor water solubility. Even<br>
more troubling is the fact that approximately 40% of the newly discovered chemical entities<br>
25that have potential therapeutic value are not pursued as drugs because of their poor<br>
sotibility in water. It would be an improvement in the art, therefore, to provide a<br>
formulation and dosage form that increase the oral bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs.<br>
[0003] Self-emulsifying formulations have been used to increase the<br>
bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs. A self-emulsifying formulation generally includes an<br>
5oil phase,.a surfactant, and a drug material. Upon, exposure to an aqueous environment,<br>
the oil phase and surfactant, interact to form an emulsion wherein the hydrophobic drug<br>
exhibits an increased solubility. A self-emulsifying formulation, therefore, has the<br>
potential to increase the solubility of a hydrophobic drug in an aqueous environment, and<br>
thereby increase the bioavailability of a hydrophobic drug delivered to the GI tract of a<br>
10subject. U.S. patents 6,436,430, 6,284,268, 6,221,391, 6,174,547, 6,057,289, 5,965,160,<br>
 and 5,578,642 discuss various self-emulsifying formulations developed to facilitate oral<br>
administration of hydrophobic drugs. It would be desirable to provide a self-emulsifying<br>
formulation suitable for oral administration of hydrophobic drugs that increases the<br>
solubility of hydrophobic drugs in an aqueous environment such that therapeutic doses of<br>
15hydrophobic drugs could be orally administered using fewer numbers of dosage forms or a<br>
dosage form of a readily acceptable size. Ideally, such a formulation would provide<br>
desirable drug loading characteristics, would be compatible with various different dosage<br>
forms, would work to reduce aggregation of hydrophobic drug contained within the<br>
formulation before delivery to an aqueous environment, and would provide an emulsion<br>
20that worked to solubilize the hydrophobic drug even for extended periods after delivery of<br>
the formulation to an aqueous environment.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] The present invention provides a drug formulation that works to increase<br>
the bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs delivered to the gastro-intestinal tract ("GI tract")<br>
of a desired subject. The drug formulation of the present invention is formulated as a self-<br>
5emuslifying nanosuspension, which forms an emulsion in-situ upon introduction to an<br>
aqueous environment. As they are used herein, the term "subject" refers to an animal,<br>
including a human, to which a drug is administered, the term "aqueous environment"<br>
indicates an environment containing water or water containing fluids, including in vivo<br>
media found in animals, such as the aqueous fluid present in the GI tract of an animal, and<br>
10the terms "aqueous medium" and "aqueous media" refer to water or water containing<br>
fluids, including in vivo media found in animals, such as the aqueous fluid present in the GI<br>
tract of an animal.<br>
[0005] A self-emulsifying nanosuspension according to the present invention<br>
includes a saturated fatty acid, one or more surface acting agents, or surfactants, and<br>
15nanoparticles of hydrophobic drug dispersed within the fatty acid and one or more<br>
surfactants. The self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention facilitates<br>
increased loading of hydrophobic drug into a given volume of formulation, is stable over<br>
time, greatly increases the solubility of hydrophobic drugs in an aqueous environment, and<br>
provides a surprising increase in the bioavailability of orally administered hydrophobic<br>
20drugs. In addition, the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention forms an<br>
 emulsion that works to solubilize hydrophobic drug material for extended periods after<br>
delivery of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension to an aqueous environment. As they are<br>
used herein, the term "solubilize" means to make soluble or more soluble in an aqueous<br>
environment, the term "solution" indicates a chemically and physically homogenous<br>
mixture of two or more substances, and the term "solubility' refers to the quantity of a<br>
particular substance that can dissolve in a particular solvent.<br>
[0006] The present invention also includes a dosage form designed to deliver<br>
the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention. The dosage form of the<br>
5present invention may be formed using various different materials and may be configured<br>
to deliver the drug formulation of the present invention to the GI tract of a subject using<br>
any desired mechanism. For example, the dosage form of the present invention may be<br>
designed to delay the release of drug formulation for a desired period of time post<br>
administration, or the dosage form may be designed to release drug formulation only when<br>
10exposed to chosen environmental conditions. Additionally, the dosage form of the present<br>
invention may be designed to provide the controlled release of drug formulation over a<br>
desired period of time or under chosen environmental conditions. A controlled release<br>
dosage form according to the present invention may be designed to deliver the drug<br>
formulation of the present invention at a desired rate over a desired period of time. If<br>
15designed as a controlled release dosage form, the dosage form of the present invention may<br>
be an osmotic dosage form. In one aspect, the present invention includes an osmotic,<br>
controlled release dosage form designed to delay release of drug formulation until after the<br>
dosage form has passed through the upper portion of the GI tract of a subject such that<br>
substantially all of the formulation is delivered at a controlled rate in the lower GI tract.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] The present invention includes a self-emulsifying nanosuspension. As<br>
10used herein, the term "nanosuspension" indicates a flowable formulation containing an<br>
amount of nanoparticles dispersed therein. The self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the<br>
present invention includes an oil phase, one or more surfactants, and nanoparticles of a<br>
desired hydrophobic drug. The self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention<br>
forms an emulsion in-situ upon exposure to aqueous media and works to enhance the<br>
05solubility of hydrophobic drug in an aqueous environment. In particular, the self-<br>
 emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention enhances the solubility of<br>
hydrophobic drug delivered to the GI tract of a subject. The self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension of the present invention also provides a surprising increase in the<br>
bioavailability of orally administered hydrophobic drug and facilitates the manufacture of<br>
20acceptably sized oral dosage forms capable of delivering therapeutic doses of hydrophobic<br>
 drug to a subject. <br>
[0009] The self-emulsifying hanosuspension of the present invention utilizes<br>
saturated fatty acid as an oil phase. Saturated fatty acid is used as the oil phase of the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention because fatty acids provide a<br>
relatively stable oil phase and facilitate more complete delivery of the hydrophobic drug<br>
included in the self-emulsifying nanosuspension. Saturated fatty acids are hydrophobic<br>
components that do not require the action of lipase to be digested. Where a drug<br>
formulation includes a lipid as the oil phase, drug dissolved within the lipid may be trapped<br>
Sand left undelivered if the lipid is not degraded by enzymatic activity. This is of particular<br>
concern where the formulation is released from a controlled release dosage form, which<br>
may release a large percentage of the drug formulation in the lower GI tract where lipase<br>
may not exist or exists in reduced concentrations. By utilizing a saturated fatty acid as the<br>
oil phase, the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention reduces the risk that<br>
10the hydrophobic drug loaded into the self-emulsifying nanosuspension will be trapped<br>
Within an undigested oil phase and rendered undeliverable. Moreover, because the fatty<br>
acid used in the self-emulsifying nanosuspension is a saturated fatty acid, the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention reduces the stability issues associated<br>
with drug formulations including an unsaturated hydrophilic material, such as an<br>
15 unsaturated lipid or fatty acid. The one or more carbon-carbon double bonds found in<br>
unsaturated hydrophilic materials are significantly less stable than the carbon-carbon single<br>
bonds and, over time, such instability works to degrade drug formulations that incorporate<br>
unsaturated hydrophilic materials.<br>
[0010] In order to achieve a self-emulsifying nanosuspension that is flowable at<br>
20physiologic temperatures, however, the saturated fatty included as the oil phase of the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention must be chosen carefully. It has been<br>
found that saturated fatty acids that are smaller than C8 fatty acids do not exhibit sufficient<br>
hydrophobicity to consistently create a multiphase emulsion in-situ upon exposure to<br>
aqueous media. Therefore, the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention is<br>
formulated using a saturated fatty acid that is a C8 fatty acid or larger. However, the<br>
melting point of saturated fatty acids increases undesirably as the size of the saturated fatty<br>
acid increases beyond C12 fatty acids. Even after mixture with one or more excipients, the<br>
melting points of saturated fatty acids larger than C12 are too high to provide a fiowable<br>
pdrug formulation at physiologic temperatures. Therefore, the oil phase of the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention is preferably formed using saturated<br>
C8 to C12 fatty acids. Table 1 provides physical properties of saturated fatty acids ranging<br>
from saturated C6 fatty acids to saturated C18 fatty acids.<br>
[0011] Though the oil phase of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the<br>
1 Dpresent invention may include a single type of saturated fatty acid or a mixture of different<br>
saturated fatty acids, in each embodiment, the oil phase of the self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension of the present invention will include an amount of C8, C10, or C12 fatty<br>
acid. In a particularly preferred embodiment, capric acid, a saturated C10 fatty acid, serves<br>
as the oil phase of the self-emulsifying formulation of the present invention. As can be<br>
lkappreciated by reference to Table 1, capric acid has a melting temperature of 31D C and a<br>
 low solubility in water. The self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention<br>
includes between about 10 wt% and about 80 wt% saturated fatty acid, with the saturated<br>
fatty acid preferrably accounting for about 35 wt% to about 45 wt% of the self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension. -<br>
20 [0012] A variety of different surfactants may be used in the self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension of the present invention. The one or more surfactants included in the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention work to reduce the interfacial tension<br>
between the hydrophobic components of the nanosuspension and any aqueous media<br>
included in the environment into which the nanosuspension is delivered. Thus, upon<br>
delivery of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention to an aqueous<br>
environment, the one or more-surfactants included in the formulation work to automatically<br>
create a stable emulsion in-situ. The one or more surfactants included in the formulation of<br>
the present invention are preferably one or more non-ionic surfactants. For example,<br>
5surfactants that may be used in the self-emulsifying formulation of the present invention<br>
include polyoxyethylene products of hydrogenated vegetable oils, polyethoxylated castor<br>
oils or polyethoxylated hydrogenated castor oil, polyoxyehtylene-sorbitan-fatty acid esters,<br>
polyoxyethylene castor oil derivatives and the like. The one or more surfactants included in<br>
the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention may include a surfactant<br>
10selected from polyoxyethylenated castor oil comprising 9 moles of ethylene oxide,<br>
polyoxyethylenated castor oil comprising 15 moles of ethylene oxide, polyoxyethylenated<br>
castor oil comprising 25 moles of ethylene oxide, polyoxyethylenated castor oil comprising<br>
35 moles of ethylene oxide, polyoxyethylene castor oil comprising 40 moles of ethylene<br>
oxide, polyoxylenated castor oil comprising 52 moles of ethylene oxide,<br>
15polyoxyethylenated sorbitan monopalmitate comprising 20 moles of ethylene oxide,<br>
polyoxyethylenated sorbitan monostearate comprising 20 moles of ethylene oxide,<br>
polyoxyethylenated sorbitan monostearate comprising 4 moles of ethylene oxide,<br>
polyoxyethylenated sorbitan tristearate comprising 20 moles of ethylene oxide,<br>
polyoxyethylenated sorbitan monostearate comprising 20 moles of ethylene oxide,<br>
0polyoxyethylenated sorbitan trioleate comprising 20 moles of ethylene oxide,<br>
polyoxyethylenated stearic acid comprising 8 moles of ethylene oxide, polyoxyethylene<br>
lauryl ether, polyoxyethylenated stearic acid comprising 40 moles of ethylene oxide,<br>
polyoxyethylenated stearic acid comprising 50 moles of ethylene oxide, polyoxyethylenated<br>
stearyl alcohol comprising 2 moles of ethylene oxide, and polyoxyethylenated oleyl alcohol<br>
comprising 2 moles of ethylene oxide. Such surfactants are available from Atlas Chemical<br>
Industries, Wilmington, Delaware; Drew Chemical Corp., Boonton, New Jersey; and GAF<br>
Corp., New York, New York. Further examples of commercially available surfactants that<br>
may be used in the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention include:<br>
5MKKOLHCO-50?, NIKKOL HCO-35?, NIKKOL HCO-40?, NIKKOL HCO-60?<br>
(from Nikko Chemicals Co. Ltd); CREMAPHORED, CREMAPHORE RH40?,<br>
CREMAPHORE RH60?, CREMAPHORE RH410?, CREMAPHORE RH455?, and<br>
CREMAPHORE ELD (from BASF); and Tweens, such as TWEEN 20?, TWEEN 21D,<br>
TWEEN 40?, TWEEN 60?, TWEEN 80?, and TWEEN 81? (from ICI Chemicals).<br>
10Addional surfactants that maybe used inthe self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the<br>
present invention include Pluronic surfactants, such as Pluronic F68, F108, and F127.<br>
[0013] The amount of surfactant included in the self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension of the present invention will depend on a variety of factors. Among such<br>
factors are the amount and type of fatty acid and drug included in the formulation, the type<br>
15of surfactant or surfactants used, and the type of emulsion desired as the self-emulsifying<br>
formulation is introduced into an aqueous, environment. For example, the self-emulsifying<br>
formulation of the present invention may include sufficient surfactant to produce a stable<br>
emulsion or microemulsion upon contact' with an aqueous medium. As it is used herein,<br>
the term "microemulsion" indicates a multicomponent system that exhibits a homogenous<br>
20oil-in-water emulsion with an average oil-droplet size of less than 1 Dm in diameter and in<br>
which quantities of a drug can be solubilized. Typically, a microemulsion can be<br>
recognized and distinguished from ordinary emulsions in that the microemulsion is more<br>
stable and usually substantially transparent or opalescent. However, the self-emulsifying<br>
formulation of the present invention may also be formulated to produce an emulsion mat is<br>
nanosuspension than in water. Preferably, the hydrophobic drug exhibits a solubility in the<br>
oil phase of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention that is at least ten<br>
times greater than the solubility of the hydrophobic drug in water. More preferably, the<br>
hydrophobic drug exhibits a solubility in the oil phase of the self-emulsifying<br>
5nanosuspension of the present invention that is at least 100 times greater than the solubility<br>
of the hydrophobic drug in water, and even more preferably, the hydrophobic drug exhibits<br>
a solubility in the oil phase of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention<br>
that is at least 500 times greater than the solubility of the hydrophobic drug in water.<br>
[0016] Although the hydrophobic drug included in the self-emulsifying<br>
1 Onanosuspension of the present invention is more soluble in the oil phase of the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension than it is in water, the hydrophobic drug need not be<br>
completely dissolved within the self-emulsifying nanosuspension before delivery of the<br>
self-emulsifying nanosuspension to an environment of operation. Instead, the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention is preferably prepared as a suspension<br>
l5having an amount of hydrophobic drug dissolved within the saturated fatty acid and<br>
 surfactant as well as an amount of undissolved hydrophobic drug dispersed within the<br>
formulation. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the self-emulsifying nanosuspension<br>
of the present invention is formulated such that, before delivery to an environment of<br>
operation, the amount of undissolved hydrophobic drug dispersed within the self-<br>
20emulsifying nanosuspension is greater than the amount of hydrophobic drug dissolved<br>
 within the self-emulsifying nanosuspension. Once delivered to the GI environment of a<br>
subject, the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention facilitates absorption<br>
of the hydrophobic drug that is dissolved within the fatty acid forming the oil phase.<br>
Moreover, as the hydrophobic drug dissolved in the oil phase of the emulsion formed by the<br>
self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention is absorbed or partitions out of<br>
the oil phase, the emulsion formed by the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present<br>
invention provides continued solubilization of previously undissolved hydrophobic drug<br>
material dispersed within the formulatiqn.<br>
5 [0017] In order to create the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present<br>
invention, the hydrophobic drug used in the self-emulsifying nanosuspension is prepared as<br>
a nanoparticulate material. As they are used herein, the terms "nanoparticulate" or<br>
"nanoparticle" indicate particles that exhibit a mean particles size that is smaller than 1 Dm<br>
in all dimensions. Preferably, the particles of hydrophobic drug included in the self-<br>
10emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention exhibit a mean particle size smaller<br>
than about 0.5 Dm in every dimension, and most preferably, the particles of hydrophobic<br>
drug included in the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention exhibit a<br>
mean particle size that is smaller than about 0.2 Dm in every dimension. Though a vacuum<br>
mixer, such as a Ross mixer, is presently preferred for dispersing the nanoparticles of<br>
15hydrophobic drug within the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention, the<br>
nanoparticles of hydrophobic drug may be dispersed within the formulation using any<br>
suitable method that results in a nanosuspension as already defined. Moreover,<br>
nanoparticles of a desired hydrophobic drug can be prepared for dispersion within the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention using any process providing particles<br>
20within a desired range of sizes. For example, the drug may be processed using a wet-<br>
milling or supercritical fluid process, such as an RESS or GAS process. In addition,<br>
processes for producing nanoparticles are disclosed in U.S. patents 6,267,989, 5,510,118,<br>
5,494,683, and 5,145,684, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0018] In order to obtain nanoparticulate material, it is generally necessary to<br>
process the material with an agent that will coat the particles as they are processed. If<br>
material is not processed in the presence of a coating agent, the particulates formed as the<br>
material is processed will rapidly aggregate or agglomerate and nanoparticles will not be<br>
5achieved. Therefore, the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention will also<br>
include an amount of coating agent used to prevent aggregation or agglomeration of the<br>
nanoparticles of hydrophobic drug. Exemplary coating agents include lipids, hydophilic<br>
polymers, such as hydroxypropyi methylcellulose ("HPMC") and polyvinylpyrrolidone<br>
("PVP") polymers, and solid or liquid surfactants. The coating agent used in a nanoparticle<br>
lbforming process may also include a mixture of agents, such as a mixture of two different<br>
surfactants. Where used as a coating agent, a hydrophilic polymer may work to both<br>
facilitate formation of nanoparticulate material and stabilize the resulting nanoparticles<br>
against recrystalization over long periods of storage. Surfactants useful. as coating agents in<br>
the creation of nanoparticles useful in the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present<br>
15invention include nonionic surfactants, such as Pluronic F68, F108, or F127. The non-ionic<br>
surfactants already mentioned herein may also be useful as coating agents in a nanoparticle<br>
forming process.<br>
[0019] The amount of coating agent included in the self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension of the present invention will depend on the amount of hydrophobic drug<br>
10material dispersed within the suspension. However, the amount of coating agent included<br>
in the nanoparticulate, hydrophobic drug material included in the self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension of the present invention preferably ranges from about 10 wt% to about 70<br>
wt%, with the hydrophobic drug material representing from about 30 wt% to about 90 wt%<br>
of the nanoparticulate material. Preferably, the nanoparticulate, hydrophobic drug material<br>
included in the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention includes about<br>
25% to about 35% coating agent and about 65% to about 75% hydrophobic drug material,<br>
with the total wt% of coating agent and drug material equaling 100 wt%.<br>
[0020] Preparing the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention<br>
With nanoparticles of hydrophobic drug allows increased drug loading. Preparing the<br>
hydrophobic drug as a nanoparticulate material facilitates increased drug loading of the<br>
self-emulsifying nanosuspension without compromising bioavailability. It has been found<br>
that, compared to coarser material, more nanoparticulate drug material can be dispersed<br>
within a self-emulsifying formulation without causing segregation of the drug material or<br>
10otherwise adversely affecting the stability of the self-emulsifying suspension. Moreover,<br>
the use of nanoparticulate hydrophobic drug material allows the formulation of a<br>
substantially uniform suspension of drug material in a low viscosity self-emuslifying<br>
carrier, as nanoparticles of hydrophobic drug do not exhibit settling even when dispersed in<br>
a low viscosity liquid. In contrast, where larger particles, even microparticles, are dispersed<br>
15to form a suspension, a viscosity enhancing agent is necessary to maintain a uniform<br>
suspension and prevent settling, and such higher viscosity formulations may not be well<br>
suited for delivery from a controlled release delivery device. The increased drug loading<br>
permitted by the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention allows relatively<br>
more hydrophobic drug to be delivered from a given volume of drug formulation, which,<br>
2 )in-turn, can reduce the size of dosage form required to administer a given dose of a desired<br>
hydrophobic drug.<br>
[0021] The amount of drug included in the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of<br>
the present invention will vary depending on the drug used and the desired dose to be<br>
delivered. Generally, self-emulsifying formulation of the present invention will include<br>
enough hydrophobic drug material to deliver about 10 mg to about 250 mg of hydrophobic<br>
drug from an acceptably sized dosage form. In a preferred embodiment, the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention includes enough hydrophobic drug<br>
material to deliver about 40 mg to about 150 mg of hydrophobic drug from an acceptably<br>
5sized dosage form. Alternatively, the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present<br>
invention preferably includes from about 2 wt% to about 50 wt% hydrophobic drug, and in<br>
particularly preferred embodiments, the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present<br>
invention includes from about 10 wt% to about 30 wt% hydrophobic drug<br>
[0022] Beyond its drug loading characteristics, the self-emulsifying<br>
10nanosuspension of the present invention enhances the solubility of hydrophobic drug in an<br>
 aqueous environment, and the emulsion formed by the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of<br>
the present invention works to prevent precipitation of the fraction of hydrophobic drug<br>
solubilized within the emulsion. The emulsion formed by the saturated fatty acid and<br>
surfactant included in the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention have<br>
15been shown to maintain the solubility of hydrophobic drug material for a period of hours<br>
after introduction into an aqueous fluid, such as artificial intestinal fluid ("AIF").<br>
[0023] The self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention is also<br>
compatible with various dosage forms, which allows the self-emulsifying nanosuspension<br>
of the present invention to be easily administered orally. Due to the increased solubility<br>
20provided by the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention, the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension facilitates the creation of a relatively higher concentration of<br>
dissolved hydrophobic drug in the GI tract of a subject. Moreover, because the emulsion<br>
formed by the self-emulsifying nanosuspension works to solubilizc hydrophobic drug as the<br>
dissolved drug material is absorbed, the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present<br>
invention works to maintain a higher concentration of dissolved hydrophobic drug over a<br>
longer period of time than would be possible if the formulation simply included an amount<br>
of dissolved hydrophobic drug. Therefore, as it is delivered to the GI tract of a subject<br>
using an oral dosage form, the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention<br>
5 works both to create and maintain a higher concentration of dissolved hydrophobic drug<br>
within the GI tract. By working to both create and maintain a higher concentration of<br>
dissolved hydrophobic drug within the GI tract of a subject, it is believed mat the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention works to increase transport of<br>
hydrophobic drug across the mucosal membrane and thereby works to increase the<br>
10bioavailabilty of hydrophobic drug administered using an oral dosage form.<br>
[0024] The self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention can be<br>
administered to a subject using any oral dosage form that is capable of containing the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention, is compatible with the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension, and can deliver the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the<br>
15present invention to the GI of the subject. However, it has been found that the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention provides a surprising increase in<br>
bioavailabilty when delivered to the GI tract of a subject using a controlled release dosage<br>
form.<br>
[0025] It is believed that the combination of at least two factors lead to the<br>
20relatively higher bioavailability achieved where the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the<br>
present invention delivered using a controlled release dosage form. First, the solubility of<br>
the hydrophobic drug in an aqueous environment increases as the concentration of the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension in the aqueous environment increases. In particular, it has<br>
been found that the even small increases in the concentration of self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension in an aqueous environment can provide large increases in the solubility of<br>
the hydrophobic drug. Second, controlled release dosage forms tend to deliver an amount<br>
of the drug formulation contained within the dosage forms to the lower portions of the GI<br>
tract of the subject, and the lower portions of the GI generally contain less aqueous media<br>
5than the upper GI tract. Therefore, a controlled release dosage form works to deliver an<br>
amount of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention to an environment<br>
containing relatively less aqueous media, which is believed to provide a relatively higher<br>
concentration of self-emulsifying nanosuspension at the location of delivery. The higher<br>
concentration of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension, in turn, is believed to increase the<br>
10solubility of the hydrophobic drug in the GI environment and thereby enhance the oral<br>
bioavailability of the hydrophobic drug.<br>
[0026] The present invention includes a controlled release dosage form. A<br>
controlled release dosage form according to the present invention includes any controlled<br>
release dosage form capable of containing the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the<br>
I5present invention, is compatible with the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present<br>
invention, and delivers the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention at a<br>
controlled rate over a desired period of time within the GI tract of a subject. The controlled<br>
release dosage form of the present invention may be designed to deliver the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention at a desired rate over a desired period<br>
200 time. Typically a controlled release dosage form of the present invention will be<br>
designed to deliver the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention at a<br>
desired release rate over a period of time ranging from about 1 hour to about 24 hours. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the controlled release dosage form of the present invention is<br>
designed to begin delivery of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension only after the dosage<br>
form has entered the lower GI tract of a subject. As they are used herein, the phrases<br>
"lower GI" or "lower GI tract" or "lower portions of the GI tract" indicate the distal small<br>
intestine and the colon.<br>
(0027) Though a controlled release dosage form may be designed to provide the<br>
5controlled release of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension of the present invention using<br>
any release or delivery mechanism that provides for the release of self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension at a desired rate over a desired period of time, a controlled release dosage<br>
form of the present invention is preferably an osmotic dosage form. Osmotic dosage forms,<br>
such as those described in U.S. patents 6,419,952, 6,342,249,6,183,466,6,174,547,<br>
105,614,578, 5,413,572, 5,324,280, and 4,627,850, which are assigned to ALZA Corporation<br>
and which are incorporated herein by reference, are desirable because the expandable<br>
osmotic material included in these dosage forms works to expel flowable drug formulations<br>
at a controlled rate in environments having relatively small amounts of aqueous media,<br>
such as the lower GI tract.<br>
18 [0028] Where the controlled release dosage form of the present invention is an<br>
osmotic dosage form, the dosage form may be formed using a soft capsule or hard capsule<br>
as described in U.S. patents 6,419,952, 5,614,578, 5,413,572, and 5,324,280 and in U.S.<br>
patent applications 60/343,001, and 60/343,005, the contents of which arc incorporated<br>
herein by reference. FIG. 1 through 14 illustrate a preferred embodiments of a controlled<br>
20release dosage form according to the present invention formed using a soft gelatin capsule.<br>
[0029] Where a soft gelatin capsule, or "soft-cap," is used to form the controlled<br>
release dosage form 10 of the present invention, the dosage form 10 includes a soft-cap 32<br>
containing a self-emulsifying nanosuspension 14. A barrier layer 34 is formed around the<br>
soft-cap 32, and a layer of expandable osmotic material 36, or "osmotic layer," is formed<br>
around the barrier layer 34. A soft-cap controlled release dosage form 10 according to the<br>
present invention is provided with a semipermeable membrane 22, the semipermeable<br>
membrane 22 being formed over the osmotic layer 36. An exit orifice 24 is preferably<br>
formed through the semipermeable membrane 22, the osmotic layer 36, and the barrier<br>
/51ayer 34 to facilitate delivery of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension 14 from the 9oft-cap<br>
controlled release dosage form 10.<br>
[0030J The soft-cap 32 used to create a controlled release dosage fonn 10 of the<br>
present invention may be a conventional gelatin capsule, and may be formed in two<br>
sections or as a single unit capsule in its final manufacture. Preferably, due to the presence<br>
10 of barrier layer 34, the wall 33 of the soft-cap 32 retains its integrity and gel-like<br>
characteristics, except where the wall 33 dissolves in the area exposed at the exit orifice 24.<br>
Generally maintaining the integrity of the wall 33 of the soft-cap 32 facilitates well-<br>
controlled delivery of the formulation 14. However, some dissolution of portions of the<br>
soft-cap 32 extending from the exit orifice 24 during delivery of the formulation 14 may be<br>
15 accommodated without significant impact on the release rate or release rate profile of the<br>
formulation 14.<br>
(0031] Any suitable soft-cap may be used to form a controlled release dosage<br>
form according to the present invention. The soft-cap 32 may be manufactured in<br>
accordance with conventional methods as a single body unit comprising a standard capsule<br>
20shape. Such a single-body soft-cap typically may be provided in sizes from 3 to 22 minims<br>
(1 minim being equal to 0.0616 ml) and in shapes of oval, oblong, or others. The soft cap<br>
32 may be manufactured in accordance with conventional methods using, for example, a<br>
soft gelatin material or a hard gelatin material that softens during operation. The soft cap<br>
32 may be manufactured in standard shapes and various standard sizes, conventionally<br>
designated as (000), (00), (0), (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5), with largest number corresponding<br>
to the smallest capsule size. However, whether the soft-cap 32 is manufactured using soft<br>
gelatin capsule or hard gelatin capsule that softens during operation, the soft-cap 32 may be<br>
formed in non-conventional shapes and sizes if required or desired for a particular<br>
5application.<br>
[0032] At least during operation, the wall 33 of the soft-cap 32 should be soft<br>
and deformable to achieve a desired release rate or release rate profile. The wall 33 of a<br>
soft-cap 32 used to create a controlled release dosage form 10 according to the present<br>
invention will typically have a thickness that is greater than the thickness of the wall 13 of a<br>
10hard-cap 12 used to create a hard-cap controlled release dosage form 10. For example,<br>
soft-caps may have a wall thickness on the order of 10-40 mils, with about 20 mils being<br>
typical, whereas hard-caps may have a wall thickness on the order of 2-6 mils, with about 4<br>
mils being typical. U.S. patents numbered 5,324,280 and 6,419,952 and U.S. applications<br>
numbered 60/343,001, and 60/343,005, the contents of which have already been<br>
15incorporated herein by reference, describe the manufacture of various soft-caps useful for<br>
the creation of controlled release dosage form according to the present invention.<br>
[00331 The barrier layer 34 formed around the soft-cap 32 is deformable under<br>
the pressure exerted by the osmotic layer 36 and is preferably impermeable (or less<br>
permeable) to fluids or materials that may be present in the osmotic layer 36 and in the<br>
20environment of use during delivery of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension 14. The barrier<br>
layer 34 is also preferably impermeable (or less permeable) to the formulation 14 of the<br>
present invention. However, a certain degree of permeability of the barrier layer 34 may be<br>
permitted if the release rate or release rate profile of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension<br>
14 is not detrimentally affected. As it is deformable under forces applied by osmotic layer<br>
36, the barrier layer 34 permits compression of the soft-cap 32 as the osmotic layer 36<br>
expands. This compression, in turn, forces the self-emulsifying nanosuspension 14 from<br>
the exit orifice 24. Preferably, the barrier layer 34 is deformable to such an extent that the<br>
barrier layer 34 creates a seal between the osmotic layer 36 and the semipermeable layer 22<br>
5 in the area where the exit orifice 24 is formed. In that manner, barrier layer 34 will deform<br>
or flow to a limited extent to seal the initially exposed areas of the osmotic layer 36 and the<br>
semipermeable membrane 22 when the exit orifice 24 is being formed. Materials and<br>
methods suitable for forming a barrier layer 34 included in a soft-cap controlled release<br>
dosage form 10 of the present invention are taught in U.S. patent applications 60/343,001,<br>
10and 60/343,005.<br>
[0034] The osmotic layer 36 included in a soft-cap controlled release dosage<br>
form 10 according to the present invention includes a hydro-activated composition that<br>
expands in the presence of water, such as that present in gastric fluids. The osmotic layer<br>
36 may be prepared using the materials and methods described in U.S. patents 5,324,280<br>
15and 6,419,952, and in U.S. patent application serial number 60/392,775, the contents of<br>
each of which are herein incorporated by this reference. As the osmotic layer 36 imbibes<br>
and/or absorbs external fluid, the osmotic layer 36 expands and applies a pressure against<br>
the barrier layer 34 and the wall 33 of the gel-cap 32, thereby forcing the self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension 14 through the exit orifice 24.<br>
20 [0035] As shown in FIG. 1, FIG. 5-FIG. 8, and FIG. 10-FIG. 11, the osmotic<br>
 layer 36 included in a soft-cap controlled release dosage form 10 of the present invention<br>
may be configured as desired to achieve a desired release rate or release rate profile and a<br>
desired delivery efficiency. For example, the osmotic layer 36 may be an unsymmetrical<br>
hydro-activated layer (shown in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6), having a thicker portion remote from<br>
the exit orifice 24. The presence of the unsymmetrical osmotic layer 36 functions to assure<br>
that the maximum dose of formulation 14 is delivered from the dosage form 10, as the<br>
thicker section of the osmotic layer 36 swells and moves towards the exit orifice 24. As is<br>
easily appreciated by reference to the figures, the osmotic layer 36 may be formed in one or<br>
5more discrete sections 38 that do not entirely encompass the barrier layer 34 formed around<br>
the soft cap 32 (shown in FIG. 5 - FIG. 8). As can be seen from FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, the<br>
osmotic layer 36 may be a single element 40 that is formed to fit the shape of the soft-cap<br>
32 at the area of contact. Alternatively, the osmotic layer 36 may include two or more<br>
discrete sections 38 formed to fit the shape of the soft-cap 32 in the areas of contact (shown<br>
10in FIG. 7and FIG. 8).<br>
[0036] The osmotic layer 36 may be fabricated as a tableted material using<br>
known materials and fabrication techniques. For example, the osmotic layer maybe<br>
fabricated conveniently by tableting to form an osmotic layer 36 of a desired shape and<br>
size: For example, the osmotic layer 36 may be tableted as a concave surface that is<br>
15complementary to the external surface of the barrier layer 34 formed on the soft-cap 32.<br>
Appropriate tooling such as a convex punch in a conventional tableting press can provide<br>
the necessary complementary shape for the osmotic layer. Where formed by tableting, the<br>
osmotic layer 36 is granulated and compressed, rather than formed as a coating. Methods<br>
of forming an, osmotic layer by tableting are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
204,915,949, 5,126,142, 5,660,861, 5,63,3,011, 5,190,765, 5,252,338, 5,620,705, 4,931,285,<br>
5,006,346, 5,024,842, and 5,160,743, the contents of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[0037] The semipermeable membrane 22 formed around the osmotic layer 36 is<br>
non-toxic and maintains its physical and chemical integrity during operation of the soft-cap<br>
controlled release dosage form 10. The semipermeable membrane 22 is permeable to the<br>
passage of water but is substantially impermeable to the passage of the active agent<br>
included in the self-emulsifying nanosuspension 14. The semipermeable membrane 22 is<br>
non-toxic to the intended subject and maintains its physical and chemical integrity during<br>
5the operation of the dosage form 10. Further, adjusting the thickness or chemical make-up<br>
of the semipermeable membrane 22 can control the rate at which the expandable osmotic<br>
composition 36 included in the dosage form 10 expands. Therefore, the semipermeable<br>
membrane 22 coating a dosage form 10 of the present invention may be used to control the<br>
release rate or release rate profile achieved by the the dosage form 10.<br>
 [0038] The semipermeable membrane 22 included in a controlled release<br>
dosage form of the present invention may be formed using any material that is permeable to<br>
water, is substantially impermeable to the active agent, is pharmaceutically acceptable, and<br>
is compatible with the other components of the dosage fonn. Generally, the semipermeable<br>
membrane 22 will be formed using materials that include semipermeable polymers,<br>
15scmipermeable homopolymers, scmipermeable copolymers, and semipermeable<br>
terpolymers Semipermeable polymers arc known in the art, as exemplified by U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,077,407, which is incorporated herein by reference, and they can be made by<br>
procedures described in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, Vol. 3, pages<br>
325 to 354, 1964, published by Interscience Publishers, Inc., New York. The<br>
20semipermeable membrane 22 included in the dosage form 10 of the present invention may<br>
also include a flux regulating agent, such as a flux enhancing or a flux reducing agent, to<br>
assist in regulating the fluid permeability or flux through the semipermeable membrane 22.<br>
Additional references describing materials and methods suitable for fabricating the<br>
semipermeable membrane 22 included in the dosage form 10 of the present invention<br>
include, U.S. patents 6,174,547, 6,245,357, and 6,419,952 and U.S. patent applications<br>
numbered 08/075,084, 09/733,847, 60/343,001, 60/343,005, and 60/392,774, the contents<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0039] It is presently preferred that a soft-cap controlled-release dosage form 10<br>
5of the present invention include mechanism for sealing any portions of the osmotic layer 36<br>
exposed at the exit orifice 24. Such a sealing mechanism prevents the osmotic layer 36<br>
from leaching out of the system during delivery of formulation 14. In one embodiment, the<br>
exit orifice 24 is drilled and the exposed portion of the osmotic layer 36 is sealed by barrier<br>
layer 34, which, because of its rubbery, elastic-like characteristics, flows outwardly about<br>
10the inner surface of exit orifice 24 during and/or after the formation of the exit orifice 24.<br>
 In that manner, the barrier layer 34 effectively seals the area between the osmotic layer 34<br>
and semipermeable layer 22. This can be seen most clearly in FIG. 4. In order to flow and<br>
seal, the barrier layer 34 should have a flowable, rubbery-like consistency at the<br>
temperature at which the system operation takes place. Materials, such as copolymers of<br>
15ethyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate, especially Eudragit NE 30? supplied by<br>
RohmPharma, Darmstaat, Germany, are preferred. A soft-cap controlled release dosage<br>
form 10 having such a sealing mechanisms may be prepared by sequentially coating the<br>
soft-cap 32 with a barrier layer 34, an osmotic layer 36, and semipermeable layer 22 and<br>
then drilling the exit orifice 24 to complete the dosage form 10.<br>
20 [0040] Alternatively a plug 44 may be used to form the desired sealing<br>
mechanism for the exposed portions of the osmotic layer 36. As is shown in FIG. 9A<br>
through FIG. 9D, a plug 44 may be formed by providing a hole 46 in the semipermeable<br>
membrane and the barrier layer (shown as a single composite membrane 48). The plug 44<br>
is then formed by filling the hole 46 with, for example, a liquid polymer that can be cured<br>
by heat, radiation or the like (shown in FIG. 9C). Suitable polymers include polycarbonate<br>
bonding adhesives and the like, such as, for example, LoctiteG 3201, LoctiteG 3211,<br>
LoctiteD 3321 and LoctiteG 3301, sold by the Loctite Corporation, Hartford, Connecticut.<br>
The exit orifice 24 is drilled into plug to expose a portion of the soft-cap 32. A completed<br>
5dosage form having a plug-type seal is illustrated in an overall view of Fig. 10 and in cross-<br>
section in FIG. 11.<br>
[0041 ] Still another manner of preparing a dosage form having a seal formed on<br>
the inner surface of the exit orifice is described with reference to FIG. 12 - FIG. 14. In FIG.<br>
12, a soft-cap 32 (only partially shown) has been coated with the barrier layer 34 and an<br>
10osmotic layer 36. Prior to coating the semipermeable membrane 22, a section of the<br>
osmotic layer 36 extending down to, but not through, the barrier layer 34 is removed along<br>
line A-A. Then a semipermeable membrane 22 is coated onto the dosage form 10 to yield a<br>
precursor of the dosage form such as illustrated in FIG. 13. As can be seen from FIG. 13,<br>
the portion of gel-cap 32 where the exit orifice 24 is to be formed is covered by the<br>
15semipermeable membrane 22 and the barrier layer 34, but not the osmotic layer 36.<br>
Consequently, when an exit orifice 24 is formed in that portion of the dosage form 10, as<br>
can be seen most clearly in FIG. 14, the barrier layer 34 forms a seal at the juncture of the<br>
semipermeable membrane 22 and expandable layer 20 such that fluids may pass to osmotic<br>
layer 36 only through the semipermeable membrane 22. Accordingly, osmotic layer 36 is<br>
20not leached out of the dosage form 10 during operation. The sealing aspect of the soft-cap<br>
controlled release dosage form 10 of the present invention allows the rate of flow of fluids<br>
to the osmotic layer 36 to be carefully controlled by controlling the fluid flow<br>
characteristics of the semipermeable membrane 22.<br>
[0042] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, the barrier layer 34 is<br>
first coated onto the gelatin capsule 12 and then the tableted, osmotic layer 36 is attached to<br>
the barrier-coated soft-cap with a biologically compatible adhesive. Suitable adhesives<br>
include, for example, starch paste, aqueous gelatin solution, aqueous gelatin/glycerin<br>
solution, acrylate-vinylacetate based adhesives such as Duro-Tak adhesives (National<br>
Starch and Chemical Company), aqueous solutions of water soluble hydrophilic polymers<br>
such as hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose,<br>
and the like. That intermediate dosage form is then coated with a semipermeable<br>
membrane. The exit orifice 24 is formed in the side or end of the soft-cap 32 opposite the<br>
10bsmotic layer 36. As the osmotic layer 36 imbibes fluid, it will swell. Since it is<br>
constrained by the semipermeable membrane 22, the osmotic layer 36 compresses the soft-<br>
cap 32 as the osmotic layer 36 expands, thereby expressing the formulation 14 from the<br>
interior of the soft-cap 32 into the environment of use.<br>
[0043J As mentioned, the "soft-cap controlled release dosage form 10 of the<br>
15present invention may include an osmotic layer formed of a plurality of discrete sections.<br>
Any desired number of discrete sections may be used, but typically the number of discrete<br>
sections will range from 2 to 6. For example, two sections 38 may be fitted over the ends<br>
of the barrier-coated soft-cap 32 as illustrated in FIG. 12 and FIG. 13. FIG. 12 is a<br>
schematic of a soft-cap controlled release dosage form 10 with the various components of<br>
20the dosage form indicated by dashed lines and the soft-cap 32 indicated by a solid line.<br>
FIG. 13 is a cross-sectional view of a completed soft-cap controlled release dosage form 10<br>
having two, discrete expandable sections 3S. Each expandable section 38 is conveniently<br>
formed by tableting from granules and is adhesively attached to the barrier-coated soft-cap<br>
32, preferably on the ends of the soft-cap 32. Then a semipermeable layer 22 is coated on<br>
the intermediate structure and an exit orifice 24 is formed in a side of the dosage form<br>
between the expandable sections 38. As the expandable sections 38 expand, the<br>
formulation 14 will be expressed from the interior of the soft-cap 32 in a controlled manner<br>
to provide controlled-release delivery of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension 14.<br>
5 [0044] The controlled release dosage form of the present invention may also be<br>
manufactured using a hard-cap, such as a capsule fabricated of hard gelatin or polymer<br>
materials. U.S. patents 6,174,547, 5,413,572 and 5,614,578 and U.S. patent application<br>
60/392,774, which have already been incorporated herein by reference, teach exemplary<br>
controlled release dosage forms that may be used to deliver the self-emulsifying<br>
10nanosuspension of the present invention and can serve as a controlled release dosage form<br>
of the present invention. A presently preferred hard-cap controlled release dosage form is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 15.<br>
[0045] As can be seen by reference to FIG. 15, the preferred controlled release<br>
hard-cap dosage form 100 includes a capsule body 120 filled with a self-emulsifying<br>
15nanosuspension 140. A water impermeable subcoat160 may be provided on the outer<br>
surface of the capsule body 120, and an expandable osmotic composition 180 is positioned<br>
within a first end 20 of the capsule body 120. If desired, a barrier layer 220 may be<br>
positioned between the expandable osmotic composition 180 and the self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension 140. Where included, a barrier layer 220 works to prevent mixing of the<br>
20self-emulsifying nanosuspension 140 with the expandable osmotic composition 180 and<br>
serves to ensure more complete delivery of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension 140 from<br>
the dosage form 100 as the expandable osmotic composition 180 expands during operation.<br>
As can be seen in FIG. 15, a semipermeable membrane 240 is formed over the water<br>
impermeable subcoat16 and any exposed portions of the capsule body 120 and the<br>
expandable osmotic composition 180. To facilitate expulsion of the self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension 140, a dosage form 100 of the present invention also includes an exit<br>
orifice 260, which is preferably formed in an area near a second end 280 of the capsule<br>
body 120. As is shown in FIG. 15, the exit orifice 260 will generally be formed at a<br>
5location opposite the expandable osmotic composition 180.<br>
[0046] The capsule body 120 included in a preferred hard-cap controlled release<br>
dosage form 100 of the present invention is formed to contain a desired amount of self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension 140 and includes a first end 200 and a second end 280. The<br>
first end 200 of the capsule body 120 is open and is sized and shaped to accommodate the<br>
10expandable osmotic composition 180. As can be seen in FIG. 15, the capsule body 120 of<br>
the dosage form 100 does not include a cap and does not encapsulate the expandable<br>
osmotic composition 180. In this manner, contact between the capsule body 120 and the<br>
expandable osmotic composition 180 prior to the operation of the dosage form 100 is<br>
reduced relative to previous dosage form designs. Such a design reduces capsule cracking<br>
15due to water migration from the capsule material into the osmotic composition, and thereby<br>
reduces the likelihood that interaction between the expandable osmotic composition 180<br>
and the capsule body 120 will affect the structural stability of the capsule body 120 either<br>
before or during operation of the dosage form 100. Though the capsule body 120<br>
illustrated in FIG. 15 is formed in a generally oblong shape, the capsule body of a<br>
20controlled release hard-cap dosage form 100 of the present invention is not so limited and<br>
may be sized and shaped as desired to contain a desired amount of liquid active agent<br>
formulation or to suit a particular drug delivery application.<br>
[0047] To further reduce the problems associated with hydration sensitivity, the<br>
preferred embodiment of the controlled release hard-cap dosage form 100 of the present<br>
invention may include a capsule body 120 formed of a water-soluble polymer material.<br>
Relative to gelatin materials, water-soluble polymer materials are less susceptible to<br>
moisture loss and are markedly less sensitive to changes in moisture content than the<br>
gelatin materials typically used in capsule fabrication. Polymer materials that can be used<br>
5to form the capsule body 120 include, for example, polysaccharide materials, such as<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC),<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), poly(vinylalcohol-co-ethylene glycol) and other water<br>
soluble polymers suitable for dip-coating or extrusion processes for making capsule bodies.<br>
Though the capsule body 120 included in the preferred hard-cap controlled release dosage<br>
10form 100 may be manufactured using a single polymer material, the capsule body 120 may<br>
also be formed using a mixture of more than one polymer material. Presently, HPMC<br>
capsules are preferably used to form a hard-cap capsule body 120 because they are<br>
commercially available and provide desirable performance characteristics. However, the<br>
capsule body 120 included in a hard-cap controlled release dosage form according to the<br>
15present invention may be formed using a variety of materials and methods, with exemplary<br>
materials and methods being described in, for example, the U.S. patents 6, 174,547,<br>
5,413,572 and 5,614,578 and U.S. patent application 60/392,774, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0048] Where included, the optional water impermeable subcoat 160 formed on<br>
20the capsule body 120 of a hard-cap controlled release dosage form 100 of the present<br>
invention works to minimize or prevent the migration of water from an external<br>
environment, through the capsule body 120, and into the self-emulsifying nanosuspension<br>
140. In order to be effective, the water impermeable subcoat 160 need not be perfectly<br>
impermeable to the passage of water. As it is used herein, the expression "water<br>
impermeable" refers to subcoats exhibiting a water flux of less than about 10-4<br>
(mil?cm/atm?hr). Any material that provides a subcoat of sufficient water<br>
impermeability, is pharmaceutieally acceptable, and is compatible with the other<br>
components of the dosage form may be used to form the water impermeable subcoat 160.<br>
5However, latex materials, such as Surelease? latex materials available from Colorcon, Inc.,<br>
Kollicoat ? SR latex materials available from BASF, Eudragit? SR, and other<br>
polymethylacrylate latex materials, are presently preferred for forming the water<br>
impermeable subcoat 160.<br>
[0049] A water impermeable subcoat 160 may be provided on the capsule body<br>
10120 using any suitable coating technique. For example, the capsule body 120 may be<br>
provided with a water impermeable subcoat 160 using a known dip coating process. A<br>
water impermeable subcoat 160 may also be formed over the capsule body 120 using a<br>
spray coating process. Where a spray coating process is used, however, the capsule body<br>
120 is preferably provided with a removable cap before the spray coating is conducted.<br>
Providing the capsule body 120 with a removable cap prior to the spray coating process<br>
prevents coating of the interior surface of the capsule body 120 with the material forming<br>
the water impermeable subcoat 160. Once the spray coating process is complete, however,<br>
the cap should be readily removable to allow further processing of the coated capsule body<br>
120. An exemplary spray coating process suitable for providing a capsule body 120<br>
20included in a hard-cap dosage controlled release dosage form according to the present<br>
invention with a water impermeable subcoat is described in U.S. patent application<br>
60/392,774, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0050] The expandable osmotic composition 180 included in a dosage form 100<br>
of the present invention is formulated such that, the expandable osmotic composition 180<br>
expands as it absorbs water from the environment of operation and exerts a force against<br>
the self-emulsifying nanosuspension 140, which causes the expulsion of the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension 140 through the exit orifice 26. Any composition that exhibits<br>
such characteristics, is pharmaceutically acceptable, and is compatible with the other<br>
components of the dosage form of the present invention may be used to form the<br>
expandable osmotic composition 180. Exemplary materials and methods for forming an<br>
expandable osmotic composition 180 for use a controlled release hard-cap dosage form 100<br>
of the present invention are detailed in U.S. patents 6,174,547 6,245,357, and 6,419,952<br>
and in U.S. patent applications numbered, 09/733,847, 60/343,001, and 60/343,005, and<br>
1060/392,774, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0051] As can also be appreciated by reference to FIG. 15, the expandable<br>
osmotic composition 180 of the a controlled release hard-cap 100 according to the present<br>
invention is preferably tableted in a bi-layer tablet 30 including a barrier layer 220. The<br>
barrier layer 220 works to minimize or prevent the mixing of the self-emulsifying<br>
15nanosuspension 140 with the expandable osmotic composition 180 before and during<br>
operation of the dosage form 100. By minimizing or preventing mixing of the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension 140 with the expandable osmotic composition 180, the barrier<br>
layer 220 serves to reduce the amount of residual active agent remaining within the dosage<br>
form 100 after the expandable osmotic composition 180 has ceased expansion or has filled<br>
the interior of the dosage form 100. The barrier layer 220 also serves to increase the<br>
uniformity with which the driving power of the expandable osmotic composition 180 is<br>
transferred to the self-emulsifying nanosuspension 140 included in the dosage form 100. A<br>
barrier layer 220 included in the preferred hard-cap controlled release dosage form 100 may<br>
be formed using the materials and methods described in U.S. patent 6,419applications<br>
numbered 08/075,084, 60/343,001, 60/343,005, and 60/392,774.<br>
[0052] The semipermeable membrane 240 included on the a controlled release<br>
hard-cap dosage form 100 of the present invention is permeable to the passage of water but<br>
is substantially impermeable to the passage of the active agent included in the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension 140. The semipermeable membrane 240 is non-toxic to the<br>
intended subject and maintains its physical and chemical integrity during the operation of<br>
the dosage form 100. Further, adjusting the thickness or chemical make-up of the<br>
semipermeahle membrane 240 can control the rate at which the expandable osmotic<br>
10composition 180 of included in the dpsage form 100 of the present invention expands.<br>
Therefore, the semipermeable membrane 240 coating a dosage form 100 of the present<br>
invention may be used to control the release rate or release rate profile achieved by the<br>
preferred controlled release hard-cap dosage form 100. The semipermeable membrane 240<br>
provided in a hard-cap controlled release dosage form of the present invention may be<br>
15provided using the materials and methods already described in relation to the preferred-soft<br>
cap controlled release dosage form illustrated in FIG. 1 through 14.<br>
[0053] The exit orifice 260 included in a hard-cap controlled release dosage<br>
form 100 of the present invention may be embodied by one of various different structures<br>
suitable for allowing the release of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension 140. As illustrated<br>
20in FIG. 15, the exit orifice 26 is generally formed at or near the second end 280 of the<br>
capsule body 120 and may include an aperture 270 formed through the semipermeable<br>
membrane 240 and the water impermeable subcoat 160. The aperture 270 of the exit<br>
orifice 260 illustrated in FIG. 15 exposes a portion of the capsule body 120 but preferably<br>
does not penetrate the capsule body 120. Upon administration of the dosage form 100 to an<br>
environment of operation, water present in the environment of operation weakens and<br>
dissolves the portion of the capsule body 120 exposed by the aperture 270; allowing the<br>
self-emulsifyung nanosuspension 140 contained within the capsule body 120 to be expelled.<br>
Though the exit orifice 260 illustrated in FIG. 15 is only one of various different exit<br>
5orifices that may be provided in a hard-cap controlled release dosage form according to the<br>
present invention, the exit orifice 260 shown in PIG, 15 is advantageous, as it does not<br>
require penetration of the capsule body 120 before the dosage form 100' is administered.<br>
Such a design works to prevent leaking of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension 140 from<br>
the dosage form 100 before the dosage form 100 is administered. Moreover, the aperture<br>
10270 shown in FIG, 15 is simply formed using known mechanical or laser drilling<br>
techniques. Nevertheless, a controlled release hard-cap dosage form1100 of the present<br>
invention is not limited to the exit orifice 260 illustrated in FIG. 15. Descriptions of<br>
various embodiments of exit orifices that may be used in a hard-cap controlled release<br>
dosage form of the present invention are disclosed, for example, in those patents and patent<br>
15applications already incorporated herein by reference, as well as in U.S. patents numbered<br>
3,845,770,3,916,899, and 4,200,098, the contents of which are herein incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
[0054] The hard-cap and soft-cap controlled release dosage forms prepared in<br>
accordance with the present invention may be constructed as desired to provide controlled<br>
20release of the formulation of the present invention at a desired release rate or release rate<br>
profile over a desired period of time. Preferably, the controlled release dosage forms of the<br>
present invention are designed to provide controlled release of the formulation, of the<br>
present invention over a prolonged period of time. As used herein, the phrase "prolonged<br>
period of time" indicates a period of time of two or more hours. Typically for human and<br>
veterinary pharmaceutical applications, a desired prolonged period of time may be from 2<br>
hours to 24 hours, more often 4 hours to 12 hours or 6 hours to 10 hours. For many<br>
applications it may be preferable to provide dosage forms that only need to be administered<br>
once a day.<br>
5 [0055] In a particularly preferred embodiment, the controlled release dosage<br>
form of the present invention is designed to begin release of a self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension contained therein only after the dosage form has entered the lower GI tract<br>
of a subject. In one such embodiment, the controlled release dosage form of the present<br>
invention is provided with and enteric overcoat that works to prevent operation of the<br>
10dosage form until the dosage form has entered the lower GI tract of a subject. Enteric<br>
coatings are known in the art and are designed to remain intact until exposed to an aqueous<br>
environment having a predetermined pH. Therefore, a controlled release dosage form can<br>
be according to the present invention can be provided with an enteric coating that remains<br>
intact in the upper GI tract of a subject but dissolves the in the lower GI tract due to the<br>
15change in pH that occurs as the dosage form travels from the upper portions of the GI tract<br>
to the lower potions of the GI tract. Exemplary enteric coatings are discussed at, for<br>
example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, (1965). 13th ed., pages 604-605, Mack<br>
Publishing Co., Easton, PA.; Polymers for Controlled Drug Delivery, Chapter 3, CRC<br>
Press, 1991; Eudragit? Coatings Rohm Pharma, (1985); and U.S. Patent No. 4,627,851. If<br>
20desired, the thickness and chemical constituents of an enteric coating formed on a dosage<br>
form of the present invention may be selected to target release of the formulation of the<br>
present invention within a specific region of the lower GI tract.<br>
[0056] Of course, a controlled release dosage form of the present invention<br>
designed to begin release of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension after passage through the<br>
upper GI is not limited to a controlled release dosage form having an enteric coating. For<br>
instance, the semipermeable membrane, osmotic composition, and self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension may be formulated and designed such that the controlled release dosage<br>
form does not begin delivery of the self-emulsifying nanosuspension for a period of time<br>
that is sufficient to generally ensure passage of the dosage form through the upper GI tract<br>
and into the lower GI tract of the subject. Alternatively, a controlled release dosage form<br>
according to the present invention may be designed to begin delivery the self-emulsifying<br>
nanosuspension of the present invention in the lower GI tract of a subject by providing a<br>
controlled release dosage form with, an outer coating that erodes over a desired period of<br>
10time after administration, with the erosion of the coating being substantially independent of<br>
environmental pH.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0057] Megestrol acetate is a synthetic progestin indicated for palliative<br>
15treatment of various cancers, such as breast, endometrial and prostate cancers. The water<br>
solubility of megestrol acetate is about 2 Dg/ml at 3 7 ID C. Due to its poor water solubility<br>
megestrol acetate exhibits a low oral bioavailability.<br>
[0058] A first self-emulsifying nanosuspension according to the present<br>
invention containing megestrol acetate was prepared. The megestrol acetate used in this<br>
20and all other examples was supplied by Diosynth Corporation of the Netherlands. The first<br>
nanosuspension was prepared by dispersing megestrol acetate nanoparticle in capric acid<br>
and Cremophor EL. The nanoparticles were prepared by wet milling (using Dyno milling<br>
equipment) followed by freeze-drying. Pluronic F108 was used as a coating agent in the<br>
wet milling process. The mean particle size of the nanoparticles was 0.3 Âµm as measured<br>
by Horiba LA-910 laser scattering particle size analyzer. The megestrol acetate was<br>
dispersed within the capric acid and Cremophor EL using a sonicator, with the resulting<br>
self-emulsifying nanosuspension including 3.8 wt% megestrol acetate nanoparticle, 1.4<br>
wt% Pluronic F108, 47.4 wt% capric acid, and 47.4 wt% Cremophor EL.<br>
5 [0059] A first batch of hard-cap controlled release dosage forms according to<br>
the present invention was then manufactured using the first self-emulsifying formulation.<br>
The first dosage forms were prepared using a clear, size-0 hard-caps. The first dosage<br>
forms incorporated a bi-layer osmotic composition and were coated with a rate controlling<br>
semipermeable membrane. An exit orifice was provided in the first dosage forms using a<br>
10mechanical drill with drilling depth control.<br>
[0060] To prepare the bi-layer osmotic composition used in the dosage forms,<br>
an osmotic granulation of was prepared using a Glatt fluid bed granulator (FBG). The<br>
osmotic granulation included NaCl, NaCMC, HPMC, HPC, Mg stearate and red ferric<br>
oxide. The NaCl was sized/screened using a Quardo mill having a 21-mesh screen and the<br>
15speed set on maximum. The sized NaCl, NaCMC, HPMC, and red ferric oxide were<br>
blended in a granulator bowl in the following weight percentages: 58.75% NaCMC, 30%<br>
sized/screened NaCl, 5.0% HPMC E-5 and 1.0% red ferric oxide. In a separate container, a<br>
granulating solution was prepared by dissolving 5.0 wt% HPC EF in purified water. The<br>
osmotic granulation was then prepared by spraying the granulation solution onto the<br>
20fluidized powders until all of the solution was applied and the powders were granular. A<br>
final osmotic granulation was completed by blending 0.25 wt% Mg stearate with the<br>
prepared granules.<br>
[0061] The barrier layer included in the bi-layer osmotic composition included<br>
in the first hard-cap controlled release dosage forms was formed using Kollidon SR. The<br>
final osmotic granulation was used to prepare a bi-layer osmotic composition by<br>
compressing an amount of the final osmotic granulation and an amount of Kollidone SR<br>
into a bi-layer tablet using Carver tableting press. Two hundred and seventy mg of the final<br>
osmotic granulation was added to a 0.70 cm punch (lower punch: modified ball, upper<br>
5punch: modified) and tamped. 80 mg of Kollidone SR was then added to the punch and the<br>
osmotic granulation and Kollidone SR were compressed under a force of about 1 metric ton<br>
to form a tableted bi-layer osmotic composition.<br>
[0062] To load the self-emulsifying nanosuspension into the capsules used to<br>
prepare the first hard-caps, the capsules were separated into two segments (a body and a<br>
10cap). The self-emulsifying nanosuspension was men loaded into the body of each capsule<br>
using standard filling techniques. Each capsule was provided with 526 mg of the self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension. The megestrol acetate dose of the resulting hard-cap<br>
controlled release dosage form was, therefore, about 20 mg. After the capsule bodies were<br>
filled, pre-coating assemblies were formed by positioning a bi-layer osmotic composition in<br>
15each filled capsule body.<br>
[0063] The pre-coating assemblies were then coated with a semipermeable<br>
membrane. The semipermeable membrane was provided over the pre-coating assemblies<br>
included, by weight, 70% cellulose acetate 398-10 and 30% Pluronic F-68. To form the<br>
semipermeable membrane a coating composition was first formed by dissolving<br>
20appropriate amounts of cellulose acetate 398-10 and Pluronic F-68 in acetone to form a<br>
coating solution having a solid content of 4% by weight. The pre-coating assemblies were<br>
then sprayed with the coating solution in a 12" Freud Hi-coater until each was provided<br>
with a semipermeable membrane weighing about 131 mg.<br>
[0064] After membrane coating, the first hard-cap controlled release dosage<br>
forms were completed bydrying the coated sub-assemblies and providing each of the dried<br>
and coated sub-assemblies with an exit orifice. The coated sub-assemblies were dried in a<br>
Blue oven at 30 DC overnight, and each of the dried sub-assemblies was then provided<br>
5with an exit orifice measuring about 0.5 mm in diameter. The exit orifices were provided<br>
in each dosage form by drilling the drug-layer side using a mechanical drill with drilling<br>
depth control.<br>
[0065] The release rate profile of the first hard-cap controlled release dosage<br>
forms was measured using a USP H paddle method in 2%, by weight, aqueous solution of<br>
10Pluronic F108 (pH 6.8). As shown in Fig. 18, 90% of the megestrol acetate contained in<br>
the dosage forms was released at a substantially constant rate over about 7 hrs.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0066] A second self-emulsifying nanosuspension according to the present<br>
15invention was prepared using the materials described in EXAMPLE 1. However, the<br>
second self-emulsifying nanosuspension was prepared to include relatively more megestrol<br>
acetate nanoparticle. Using the methods described in EXAMPLE 1, the second self-<br>
emulsifying nanosuspension was prepared to include 16 wt% megestrol acetate<br>
nanoparticle, 4.2 wt% Pluronic F108,39.9 wt% of capric acid and 39.9 wt% Cremophor<br>
20EL.<br>
[0067] A second batch of hard-cap controlled release dosage forms according to<br>
the present invention was prepared using the second self-emulsifying nanosuspension. The<br>
capsules used to fabricate the second hard-cap controlled release dosage form were #2<br>
hard-caps. The osmotic composition of the second hard-cap controlled release dosage<br>
forms was manufactured using the same osmotic granulation and barrier layer material as<br>
described in EXAMPLE 1, but the weights of the materials included in the bi-layer osmotic<br>
composition varied from those described in EXAMPLE 1. To provide the bi-layer osmotic<br>
composition included in the second hard-cap controlled release dosage form, 180 mg of the<br>
5osmotic granulation and 70 mg of the barrier-layer material (Kollidon SR) were<br>
compressed to the bi-layer tablets using 227' concaved, flat tooling. After the 180mg of<br>
osmotic granulation and 70 mg of Kollidon SR were tableted to form a bi-layer osmotic<br>
composition, an additional amount of Kollidon SR was added to the barrier layer by<br>
compressing 130 mg of Kollidon SR-over the compressed barrier material already present<br>
10using the same tooling. The additional amount of Kollidon SR served to fill empty space<br>
present in the #2 capsule body.<br>
[0068] The bodies of the capsules used to form the second hard-cap controlled<br>
release dosage forms were separated and 125 mg of the second self-emulsifying was loaded<br>
into each capsule body. Because the self-emulsifying nanosuspension loaded into the<br>
15second hard-cap controlled release dosage form included 16% megestrol acetate by weight,<br>
each of the completed second hard-cap controlled release dosage forms contained about a<br>
20 mg dose of megestrol acetate. Once the capsule bodies were filled with the desired<br>
amount of self-emuslfying nanosuspension, the bi-layer osmotic compositions were<br>
positioned in the capsule bodies to form pre-coating assemblies.<br>
20 [0069] The rate-controlling membrane included over the pre-coating assemblies<br>
of the second hard-cap controlled release dosage form was composed of 90% cellulose<br>
acetate 398-10 and 10% Pluronic F-68. The coating solution used to produce the<br>
semipermeable membrane of the second hard-cap controlled release dosage form was<br>
prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of cellulose acetate 398-10 and Pluronic F-68<br>
in acetone to provide a coating solution including 4% solids, by weight. Each of the<br>
coating sub-assemblies of the second hard-cap controlled release dosage form was then<br>
coated in a in a 12" Freud Hi-coater until each sub-assembly was provided with a<br>
semipermeable membrane weighing about 47mg. To complete the second hard-cap<br>
5controlled release dosage forms, the coated sub-assemblies were then dried and provided an<br>
exit orifice as described in EXAMPLE 1.<br>
[0070] The release rate profile provided by the second hard-cap controlled<br>
release dosage forms was then evaluated according to the process outlined in EXAMPLE 1.<br>
As can be seen by reference to FIG. 19, 90% of the megestrol acetate contained in the<br>
10dosage forms was released at a substantially constant rate over about 7 hrs.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0071] The solubility of raw megestrol acetate and nanoparticulate megestrol<br>
acetate in AIF was evaluated in the presence of various concentrations of an exemplary<br>
self-emulsifying carrier. The exemplary self-emulsifying carrier included a blend of<br>
15saturated fatty acid and surfactant (capric acid/Cremphor EL: 50/50, by wt), and the<br>
solubility of megestrol acetate was measured at 37D C. Different samples of AIF media<br>
were prepared with various concentrations (0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0%, w/w) of the self-<br>
emulsifying carrier. The megestrol acetate was added in excess into each AIF sample, and<br>
shaken overnight at 37? C. After shaking, each AIF sample was centrifuged and the<br>
20supernatant of each AIF sample was assayed using a UV spectrometer at 290 ran.<br>
[0072] The results of the evaluation are provided in FIG. 16. As can be seen by<br>
reference to FIG. 16, the solubility of the nanoparticulate megestrol acetate was greater than<br>
the solubility of the raw megestrol acetate and the solubility of megestrol acetate increased<br>
and the concentration of self-emulsifying carrier increased.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
[0073] The stability of megestrol acetate solubilized in an emulsion formed by<br>
an exemplary self-emulsifying carrier was evaluated. The self-emulsifying carrier included<br>
550 wt% capric acid and 50 wt% Cremophor EL 50/50. Solutions of megestrol acetate in<br>
the self-emulsifying carrier and in ethanol were prepared, and the megestrol acetate<br>
concentration for each solution was 20 mg/g. After the solutions were prepared, 0.2 g of<br>
each solution was added into 10 ml of ADP. The mixtures were shaken in a water bath at<br>
37? C, and mixture samples were taken at time intervals of 15 mins, 60 mins, and 4 hrs.<br>
10These samples were measured for megestrol acetate concentration after being filtered<br>
through 0.2 Dm filter.<br>
[0074] FIG. 17 illustrates the results of the evaluation. As shown in FIG. 17, no<br>
precipitation of megestrol acetate was noticed in the ABF containing megestrol acetate<br>
solubilized in the self-emulsifying carrier. In contrast, the megestrol acetale contained<br>
15within the ethanol solution precipitated out within the first 15 minutes after introduction of<br>
the ethanor solution into the AIF.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
[0075] A five-arm PK study was conducted to evaluate the bioavailability of<br>
20megestrol acetate provided by several different dosage forms. The study included<br>
administering various dosage forms to three fasted mongrel dogs. The dosage forms<br>
administered in the study included controlled release dosage forms manufactured according<br>
to EXAMPLE 1 ("4% nanosuspension hard-cap") and EXAMPLE 2 ("16%<br>
nanosuspension hard-cap"), commercially available 20 mg MegaceD tablets, hard-cap<br>
25controlled release dosage forms containing a self-emulsifying solution of megestrol acetate<br>
("controlled release SES dosage forms"), and immediate release hard-caps containing a<br>
self-emulsifying solution of megestrol acetate ("IR SES dosage forms").- The formulations<br>
delivered by the different dosage forms are described in Table 2.<br>
[0076] The controlled release SES dosage forms were prepared using the<br>
5methods and materials described in EXAMPLE 1, except that the drug formulation<br>
contained in the controlled release SES dosage forms was a self-emulsifying solution, not a<br>
suspension. The self-emulsifying solution loaded in the controlled release SES dosage<br>
forms included, by weight, 1.77% megestrol acetate and 0.83% Pluronic F108 dissolved in<br>
48.7% Cremophor EL and 48.7% capric acid. The compounds included in the self-<br>
10emulsifying solution were mixed using a mechanical agitator. Each of the controlled<br>
release SES dosage forms were filled with 565 mg of the self-emulsifying solution, with<br>
each of the controlled release SES dosage forms providing a 10 mg dose of megestrol<br>
acetate. As is shown in FIG. 2, the controlled release SES dosage forms delivered 90% of<br>
the megestrol acetate in about 7 hours after administration.<br>
15 [0077] The RSES dosage forms were prepared simply by filling a #0 hard with<br>
the same self emulsifying solution used in the controlled release SES dosage forms. Each<br>
of the IR SES dosage forms was loaded with 565 mg of self emulsifying solution and,<br>
therefore, provided a 10 mg dose of megestrol acetate.<br>
, [0078] The dosage forms were dosed to the dogs in a fasted state using oral<br>
2dgavage. The same group of three dogs was used throughout the study, with each of the<br>
three dogs being dosed with each of the different dosage forms. In each arm of the study,<br>
the dogs were given a 20 mg dose of megestrol acetate. In order to achieve a 20 mg dose,<br>
each dog was administered two controlled release SES dosage forms and two IR SES<br>
dosage forms, as each of these dosage forms provided only a 10 mg dose of megestrol<br>
acetate. Plasma samples were taken from each dog at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after<br>
dosing each of the dosage forms, with additional plasma samples being taken from each<br>
dog at 12 hours and 24 hours after administration of the three controlled release dosage<br>
forms. The plasma concentration of megestrol acetate in each sample was evaluated using<br>
5an LC/MS method with a minimum .detection limit of 1 ng/ml. The LC/MS conditions are<br>
provided in Table 3.<br>
[0074] AUCinf was calculated by adding AUCt and AUCt-inf., where AUCt<br>
was estimated by trapezoidal integration to the last sampling point (t) and AUCt-inf was<br>
estimated by integration from t to infinity.<br>
[0080] Where Ct, K and t are, respectively, the drug concentration of the plasma<br>
sample at the last sampling point t, the apparent elimination rate constant, and the last<br>
sampling time. K was estimated by linear regression of log plasma concentration at the<br>
terminal phase versus time. The average relative BA% was calculated as follows.<br>
[0082] The results of the PK study are shown in FIG. 20. As can be seen in this<br>
20figure, both the 4% nanosuspension hard-cap and the 16% nanosuspension hard cap<br>
provided a more than four -fold increase in bioavailability of megestrol acetate compared to<br>
the MegaceD 20 mg tablet. Moreover, while providing significantly increased drug<br>
loading, the 4% nanosuspension hard cap and 16% nanosuspension hard cap provided<br>
me'gestrol acetate bioavailabilities that were comparable to those provided by the controlled<br>
release SES dosage form.<br>
