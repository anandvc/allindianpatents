				<td>A METHOD FOR PRODUCING SKOES AND A SHOE OBTAINED BY THIS<br>
METHOD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the technical field<br>
coriterning techniques for producing footwear.<br>
PRIOS ART<br>
The shoes are obtained by joining more parts, more<br>
precisely at least one shoe upper and a relative bottom<br>
(Or sole).<br>
In Order to obtain the so-called assembled shoe, a shoe<br>
upper must be produced, which 15 formed by punched<br>
portions, or punchings, made from e.g. leather, joined<br>
one to another and lined inside, and which sometimes<br>
includes a toe cap for obtaining a stronger fore part of<br>
the shoe, and a counter for strengthening the shoe rear<br>
part.<br>
The parts forming the shoe upper (punchings, lining, toe<br>
cap and counter) are often joined one to another by glue.<br>
It is also necessary to produce an insole, whose size and.<br>
shape match a relative Shoe upper.<br>
The insole is generally mounted on a last, to which it is<br>
fastened by suitable fastening means.<br>
During a next step, a layer of glue is applied to the<br>
edge of the insole, the shoe upper is fitted onto the<br>
last, the shoe upper edge is folded and Kept pressed,<br>
according to known techniques, against the insole<br>
situated below, in order to join the two elements.<br><br>
After the shoe upper and the insole have been joined, the<br>
shoe upper is made to tightly adhere to the last,<br>
according to systems and technigues known to those expert<br>
in the field.<br>
The so obtained assembly is joined to a relative sole by<br>
stitching and/or fluing.<br>
The shoe upper of this kind of shoe is stretched on a<br>
Last of a prefixed shape and, consequently the shoe upper;<br>
assumes the shape of the last used for its stretching:<br>
the so obtained shops have standard shape of the foot<br>
receiving space.<br>
In case the user has a deformed foot, for example in a<br>
metatarsus-phalange portion, the described shoe is<br>
uncomfortable, because the shoe width and shape cause to<br>
the foot, in the areas, in which it touches the shoe,<br>
skin irritation, pain and sometimes small abrasions.<br>
If the foot deformation is small, the shoe deforms either<br>
only by being used and with all above described<br>
discomforts, or by mechanical instruments which widen the<br>
shoe upper in its rear ares.<br>
If the foot deformation is severe or peculiar, this type<br>
of shoe cannot be worn; thus, it is necessary to obtain a<br>
form of the foot and prepare a "tailored" shoe,<br>
0BJECT_OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to propose a<br>
method for producing shoes, which can be adapted to the<br>
user's foot shape.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a<br>
method for producing shoes, which allows a particularly<br>
comfortable product to be easily obtained.<br><br>
-3-<br>
A further object of the present inversion is to propose a<br>
method, whose carrying out does not require specialized<br>
staff.<br>
The characteristic features of the present invention will<br>

DESCRIPTION THE RREEFERREd EMBODIMETS<br>
According to the proposed method for producing a shoe, a<br>
Shoe upper 2 must be obbained by assembling different<br>
parts, for example: an external layer 25 and, if<br>
required, a counter (not shown) joined by stitching to<br>
the rear portian of the external layer; an internal<br>
layer 26, called lining, complementary to the dimensions-<br>
of the external layer 25, and fastened to the inner<br>
surface of the latter, and aimed at internal finishing of<br>
the shoe upper obtained as described above.<br>
Moreover, the proposed shoe can be obtained by the use of<br>
a heel-insole 4, whose shape and size are prefixed, or an<br>
insole, and it is necessary to use a sale 5, whose shape<br>
and size are prefixed in relation to the size of the shoe<br>
to be obtained.<br>
Taking into consideration the parts forming A shoe, an<br>
elastic element 6 is prepared, for example an elastic<br>
strip with a prefixed shape, e.g. similar to the fore<br>
central portion of the sole 5, but slightly smaller than<br>
the latter; otherwise, the elastic strip 6 can have a<br><br>
-5-<br>
profile similar to the sole 5 profile, but slightly<br>
smaller.<br>
According ta a second embodiment, the elastic element .6<br>
may include a plurality of elestic strips arranged side<br>
by side.<br>
In relation to the dimensions and the shape of the<br>
elastic strip, it is necessary to scratch, a technique<br>
known to those skilled in the art as fleshing, the edge<br>
of the shoe, upper, which is aimed at receiving, fastened<br>
thereto, the elastic strip.<br>
In a first operation step, the elastic strip 6 is placed<br>
over the fleshed area of the shoe upper edge and the<br>
edge C of the elastic strip 6 is fastened, for example by<br>
stitching And/or gluing, to the shoe upper fleshed area,<br>
for example along the sections facing the edges of the<br>
centra1-fore area of the shoe upper 2, to define a<br>
tubular assembly formed by the shoe upper and the elastic<br>
strip 15.<br>
Otherwise, the elastic strip can be fastened to the<br>
peripheral edge of the lower portion of the shoe upper 2,<br>
to define a different shoe upper-stsip assemble, which is<br>
not shown<br>
In the last case, it is possible to fasten the sole the<br>
shoe upper-strip assembly, without fitting the latter<br>
onto a last.<br>
If the elastic strip 6 engages the central-fore portion<br>
of the shoe upper, the heel-insole 4 is placed and<br>
fastened, according to known techniques, to the rear<br>
portion of a last, not shown, so as to match with this<br>
rear portion.<br><br>
After the heel-insole 4 has been placed on the last, the<br>
shoe upper 2 is fitted thereon.<br>
Then, a layer of qlue is applied to the area of the-<br>
external edge B of the heel area of the heel-insole 4.<br>
If a full insole is used, the layer of glue is applied to<br>
the external edge B of the heel area and to the external<br>
edge area of the insole toe, before the shoe upper is<br>
fitted Onto the last.<br>
Then, the edge R of the rear portion of the shos upper 2,<br>
which is partially placed on the edge B of the heel-<br>
insole 4, is. folded to fasten the shoe upper to the heel-<br>
insole 4, due to keeping the press joining of the edges<br>
R, E for a prefixed period of time; in this ray, the shoe<br>
upper - heel-insole - strip T assembly, shown in Figure<br>
1, is obtained.<br>
Otherwise, a mutual fastening can be obtained by applying<br>
a plurality of connecting means, or other means, to the<br>
folded, edge R of the shoe upper 2, so as to engage the<br>
edge B of the heel-insole 4, situated, below.<br>
According to a aecond embodiment, shown, in Figure 5, an<br>
full insole S is used, which has, in its central-fore<br>
part, an elastic element 60, for example an elastic strip<br>
(or a plurality of elastic strips), with a predetermined<br>
shape, for example similar to the central fore potion of<br>
the insols, but smaller than the insole.<br>
According to this embodiment, in a first step, the shoe<br>
upper 2 is fastened to the insiale, pre-positioned and<br>
anchored to the last in known way.<br>
The insole S can he fastened to the shoe upper by the<br>
application of a layer of glue to the external edge B1 of<br>
the insole S and folding the edge Rl of the shoe upper 2<br><br>
-7-<br>
over the edge Bl of the latter, to define, by Keeping the<br>
pressed joining of the edges R1 , Bl, the shoe upper-<br>
insole - strip Tl assembly; connecting weans or other<br>
means can be used instead of the glue.<br>
Otherwise, the insole S can be fastened to the shoe upper<br>
2 by stitching., by for example the so celled "Bologna"<br>
stitch (Figure 5A) , to define the shoe upper - insole Tl<br>
assembly.<br>
After the shoe upper - heel-insole - strip T assembly, or<br>
shoe upper - strip assembly, or shoe upper - insole Tl<br>
assembly, is formed, fastening means 50, for example<br>
adhesive means of veleroÂ© of heet-plastic material,-<br>
having a prefixed shape, ara fastened to the surface 59<br>
of the sole 5, according to known techniques, to define-,<br>
on the sole, a fore fastening area 2 and a rear fastening<br>
ares Z1, in the sola toe-area and in the sole heel-area,<br>
respectively, and externally with respect to the<br>
fastening means, as shown in Figures l, 5,<br>
On the upper surface of the fastening means 50., there is<br>
a removable protective sheat, not shown, whose dimensions-<br>
are equal to the dimensions of the. fastening means 50 and<br>
which is provided laterally, with a tongue going out from<br>
the sole 5.<br>
According to a second embodiment, the fastening meens 50<br>
can be introduced in the sole of the sole 5, while the<br>
latter is being produced.<br>
During a	subsequent step, the sole 5 is set in contact<br>
with the	shoe upper - heel-insole - strip T assembly,<br>
shown in	figure 2, or with the shoe, upper - strip<br>
assembly,	or with the shoe upper - insole T1 assembly.<br>
Then the fore fastening area 2 of the sole 5 and a<br>
corresponding fore portion, for example the toe area, of<br><br>
the shoe upper - heel-insole - strip T assembly, fitted<br>
on the last, or of the shoe upper - strip assembly, or of<br>
the shoe upper - ins-ale T1 assembly, is fastened to the<br>
teat fastening area 21 of the sole and a corresponding<br>
rear portion, for example, the heel, area, of the shoe<br>
upper - heel-insole - strip T assembly, or of the shoe<br>
upper strip assembly, or of the shoe upper - insole Tl<br>
assembly, in order to obtain a sale- assembly group W,<br>
Wl.<br>
The elastic strip 6, 60 is not fastened to the fastening,<br>
means 50, as shown in Figure 2 and in the section of<br>
Figure 2A.<br>
According to a not shown embodiment, the fore area Z of<br>
the sole 5 is fastened in one point to the central fore<br>
portion of the shoe upper - heel-insole - strip T<br>
assembly, or of the shoe upper - strip assembly, or of<br>
the shoe upper - insole T1 assembly.<br>
Afterwards, the sole - assembly group W, W1 is removed<br>
from the last.<br>
After the sole - assembly group W, W1 has been obtained,<br>
during a subsequent step of the proposed method (shoe<br>
checking) , a user puts his foot P into the shoe upper 2<br>
if the sole - assembly group W W1; the elastic strip 6,<br>
60 stretches crosswise and the shoe upper 2 adapts to the<br>
user's foot shape.<br>
Then, the sheet situated, above the fastening means 50 is<br>
removed by pulling the relative tongue, and subsequently,<br>
the user's foot pushes to removably pre-fasten the<br>
elastic strip 6, 60 to the fastening means 50, 50 as to<br>
stabilize the extension of the elastic strip 6, 60, and<br>
therefore, to maintain the spatial conformation of the<br><br>
-9-<br>
During the final step, the user removes his foot from the<br>
so deformed sole - assembly group W, W1 and pressing<br>
and/or heating means, for example a press, not shown, are<br>
introduced therein to press to sole 5, so that it joins<br>
and adheres to the assembly T, or to the shoe upper -<br>
strip assembly, or to the shoe upper - insole T1 assembly<br>
in the group W, Wl, in order to obtain the desited shoe<br>
9, 90U, as shown in the section of Figures 4, 5A.<br>
Aftet the shoe 9, 900 is obtained, a finishing insole 90<br>
is introduced thereinto and placed on the heel-insole 4,<br>
and/or on the elastic strip 6, or on the insole S and on<br>
the elastic strip 6O.<br>
Recording to a third embodiment (Figures 6, 7) , the shoe<br>
upper 2, as described previously, is obtained by joining<br>
of an external layer 25 and an internal layer 26, or<br>
lining.<br>
in this embodiment, the terminal portion 250 of the<br>
external layer 25 is separated from the terminal portion<br>
260 of the lining, and an outer stitching U is made at a<br>
distance "d" from the edges of the portions.<br>
The elastic element 6, 60 (either the elastic strip 6, or-<br>
more elastic strips, or the insole S with its elastic<br>
element 601 , is festened to the terminal portion 260 of<br>
the lining, while the inner side L of the terminal<br>
portion 250 is covered with glue.<br>
Due to the pre-fastening of the elastic element 6, 60 to<br>
the fastening means 50, the texminal portion 260 of the<br>
lining 26, in relation to the shoe upper 2 deformation,<br>
is fastened, wholly or partially, to the sole 5, in order<br>
to define a gap J between the terminal portion 260 of the<br>
lining 26 and the edge of the sole 5 (Figure 6),<br><br>
-10-<br>
After the elastic element 5, 60 has been pre-fastened to,<br>
the fastening means 50 or after the shoe 9, 900 has been<br>
obtained, the terminal portion 250 of the external layer<br>
25 is wedged, by suitable instruments, into the gap J and<br>
is made adhere to the terminal portion 260 of the lining<br>
56 (Figure 7A); then the exceeding part of the terminal<br>
portion 250 of the external layer 25 is trimreed (Figure<br>
78).<br>
The above described method for producing a shoe has<br>
advantageous features.<br>
The method allows to obtain an especially comfortable-<br>
shoe., suitable for users having particular foot<br>
deformation.<br>
The elastic element 6, 60 allows to adapt the shoe upper<br>
to the user's foot conformation, due to the introduction<br>
of the user's foot into the sole - assembly group W, Wl.<br>
The protective sheet situated above the fastening, means<br>
50, allows the user to put on the shoe upper, to check if<br>
the deformation of the latter is sufficient for the foot<br>
shape without "activating" the fastening means 50, and to<br>
decide freely whether to buy the shoe 9, 900 or not.<br>
The fastening means 50 on the sole 5 allow to pre-fasten<br>
the shos upper: if the user has not deformed the shoe<br>
upper correctly, the initial conformation of the shoe<br>
upper can be restored manually, i.e. the elastic strip 6,<br>
60 is separated from the fastening means 50,<br>
The pre-fastening of the shoe upper 2, adapted to the<br>
foot shape, to the sole 5, due to the fastening of the<br>
sole - assembly group W, Wl, allows to obtain a<br>
personalized shoe 9, 900.<br><br>
The sole 5 can be fastened to the group W, W1 by<br>
stitching or by use of glue, which suitably applied to<br>
the sale 5 activates the heat-welding or fusion of<br>
suitable materials, from which the elastic element 6, 60,<br>
the fastening means 50, and the other parts of the shoe,<br>
are made, so as to assure the seal between the sole 5 and<br>
the group W, Wl.<br>
The stitching U, made at the distance "d" from the<br>
terminal portion of the shoe upper 2, allows, after the<br>
shoe' 9, 900 hes been obtained, to finish perfectly the<br>
joining area between the sole edge and the terminal<br>
portion of the shoe upper 2.<br>
The described method for producing shoes is also<br>
advantageous, because its operation steps are simple and<br>
do not requite specialised staff.<br>
It is understood that what above, has been described as a<br>
pure, not limiting example, therefore, possible variants<br>
of the invention, deriving from, the practical use, remain<br>
