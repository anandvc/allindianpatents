This invention relates to a safety intravenous (I. V.) Catheter and, in particular, to a safety intravenous (I. V.) Catheter device with retractable needle. In particular, the intravenous catheter device for the invention has been provided to reduce needle stick injuries, spread of hospital acquired infections and also avoid environmental concerns / hazards in its use and disposal. Importantly also apart from being safe and user friendly the intravenous catheter device is cost effective to favour wide scale application and use of the catheter device.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known that in health care, one of the most relevant concerns relate to provision of safe hospital environment, in particular, members of hospital and medical staff are required to be assured that they are not subject to any unwanted infection while caring for patients. Such adequate care and concern for safe medical attention and treatment is important not only in hospitals but also for any health care environments such as those required in nursing homes, health homes and related health care facilities and provisions.<br>
Intravenous (I.V.) Catheters are well known medical devices used to obtain continuous vascular access in patients. Such a device generally consists of a hollow-bore needle and an over-the-needle plastic tubing used to access the lumen of a blood vessel of a patient. The intravenous (I.V.) Catheter for such purpose is advanced into the vessel and is used in administering intravenous fluids, medications or blood products. Importantly, in such application and use since the (I.V.) Catheter is placed percutaneously, the hollow-bore needle stylet becomes<br><br>
3<br>
blood contaminated and when the blood vessel lumen is accessed, the needle-stylet becomes blood -filled.<br>
In the conventional Catheter units presently in use, the basic steps followed in catheter application/use include (i) using alcohol wipes (ii) puncturing skin using needle tip enclosed in a thin plastic tube (iii) moving needle tip forward to puncture vein (iv) blood flashback in the blood collection chamber (v) initiating withdrawal of the needle out from the cannula and leaving the tubing inside the body (vi) The butterfly portion attached to the tubing is fixed by tape to the body of the patient and medicines etc. are given trough the opening provided in this portion. (vii) discarding needle with the tip remaining exposed in the sharp's container. The thus exposed needle remains a potential source for contamination and infection. Infection from such needle stick injuries is a greatest risk for the medical and paramedical staff.<br>
Needle stick injuries from intravenous (I.V.) Catheter stylets are in the high risk category for potential transmission of blood borne pathogens to the injured health care worker, since the same are hollow bore needles which are usually filled with undiluted blood. The blood borne pathogens of greatest concerns include human immuno deficiency virus (HIV), the etiologic agent of the acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus.<br>
As per hospital reports, one-third nurses and laboratory staff suffer from needle stick injuries every year. HIV transmission through needle injuries is 0.3% of all modes of contaminations. The rate of HIV transmission through needle stick<br><br>
4<br>
injuries is 2-7% of all means. Injuries from used needle or contact with infected blood on the needle pose serious dangers to health care workers. The nurses are most vulnerable to needle stick injuries among health workers. Apart from health care workers, cleaners, laundry workers, porters, ragpickers etc. are also prone to health hazards caused by improper waste disposal methods. Blood exchange through needle stick injuries can pass on over about 20 deadly pathogens and microorganisms. Health staff with significant exposure to HIV is 6-30% risk of getting infected. Atleast one in eight health care workers is exposed to fatal infection through needle stick injuries.<br>
To avoid the above hazards of needle stick injuries guidelines have also been provided to benefit medical staff, laboratory staff and employees for protection and minimizing the risk of such contamination / transmission of infection through needle. However, it is obvious that the effectiveness of such precautionary guidelines would depend on accountability, education, training and vigilant compliance. Such precautionary guidelines while being important and most certainly required to be followed, negligence and non-compliance of such guidelines can and usually lead to the afore-discussed problems and complexities of needle stick injuries and hospital acquired infection. It is, therefore, important not only to provide the guidelines but also human care systems/devices, which would minimize the risk of such unwanted contamination especially due to human lapses which can take place any moment and lead to injuries / contaminations of even serious nature such as the HIV / HCB transmission.<br><br>
