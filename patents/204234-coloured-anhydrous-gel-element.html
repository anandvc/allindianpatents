The present invention relates to a process for preparing colored anhydrous gel element which are capable of diffusing perfume or deodorizing components into the surrounding air.<br>
The use of various devices for the diffusion of volatile compounds, for example perfumes deodorising compositions, insect repellents, and the like, into the atmosphere has become increasingly popular in recent years. For example, air-freshening devices.or deodorisers are currently used in practically all households to mask bad odours, or to impart fragrances to the ambient air. Various different types of devices are known for the diffusion of volatile compounds into the surroundings. For example, devices of the spray type, such as aerosol sprays, may be used to dispense a liquid composition into the ambient air. Other devices comprise housings enclosing the active ingredients in liquid form. Typically, the diffusion of the active ingredients takes place through membranes permeable to the vapours of said ingredient, or through a wick which is placed in a reservoir containing the ingredients.<br>
Solid state devices are also known which comprise solid materials or carriers impregnated with an active ingredient, such devices may be formed of various materials which are capable of absorbing the ingredient and subsequently releasing it in a more or less controlled manner. Examples of such known materials include gels, such as agar-agar or sodium stearate gels, synthetic polymer resins, or blocks of mineral material, e.g. plaster or silica.<br><br>
Solid state devices have the advantage that they are easy to handle and can be easily shaped.  Typically/ the solid state devices are enclosed within a housing with one or more grills which communicate with the surrounding air.<br>
The main disadvantage with solid state devices is that the release of active ingredients from the blocks is not constant with time and drops dramatically over the lifetime of the device.  Furthermore, such devices are inefficient in that the device may cease to diffuse the active ingredient into the surrounding atmosphere when the outside of the block is spent, even though considerable amounts of the active ingredient may still reside within the core of the block.  The residual active ingredient, such as perfume, is thus totally lost.<br>
WO 96/05870 discloses a device for perfuming, deodorising or sanitising air or enclosed spaces which comprises an anhydrous gel element.  Such a device is capable cf diffusing volatile substcmces at a relatively constant rate throughout the entire lifetime of the device and, furthermore, is capable of releasing substantially all of the volatile substance into the air or enclosed space within its effective lifetime.<br>
The devices of WO 96/05870, although practically very useful, are unattractive since they are in the form, of substantially colourless gels.  However, because of the manner in which the gels are formed we found chat it was difficult to incorporate dyes or colourants ir.to the gels.  Many dyes would not disperse within the system and resulted in unattractive non-homogenous products in which the dye was not uniformly dispersed therethrough. Neither the colourless gels of WO 96/05870, nor the non-homogenous coloured gels would be attractive to the purchaser of such devices which generally will be on<br><br>
display in the room or space which they are intended to perfume or deodorise.<br>
We have now found that homogenous, 'coloured anhydrous gels can be prepared from the components as disclosed in WO 96/05870-if a very careful selection is made of the dyes for incorporation therein.  The present invention is predicated upon this finding.<br>
Accordingly/ the present invention provides a coloured anhydrous gel element for perfuming or deodorising air or enclosed spaces which gel element is formed by cross-linking a functionalised liquid polymer selected from maleinised pclybutadiene/ maleinised polyisoprene or a copolymer of ethylene and maleic anhydride with a cross-linking agent which contains at least one complementary functional group in the presence of a non-aqueous perfume or deodorising base and at least one metal-free solvent dye whi-h is soluble in the nonaqueous perfume or deodorising base cr which is provided as a solution in a non-aqueous solvent which is compatible which the non-acuecus perfume or deodorising base.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for preparing a coloured gel element as defined above which comprises cross-linking the functionalised liquid polymer with the cross-linking agent in the presence of the nonaqueous perfume or deodorising base and at least one metal-free solvent dye.<br>
By the term "functionalised liquid polymer" as used herein is meant a material which is liquid at room temperature and which has a viscosity of not more than 5 PaS at 25oC preferably from 0.25 to 1.0 Pas.<br><br>
purchaser of such devices which generally will be on display m the room or space which they are intended to perfume or deodorise.<br>
We have now found that homogenous, coloured anhydrous gels can be prepared from the components as disclosed.in WO 96/05870 if a very careful selection is made of the dyes for incorporation therein. The present invention is predicated upon this finding.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparing coloured anhydrous gel element for perfuming or deodorizing air or enclosed spaces which comprises cross-linking a functionalized liquid polymer selected from maleinised polybutadiene, maleinised polyisoprene or a copolymer of ethylene and maleic anhydride with a cross-linking agent which contains at least one complementary functional group in the presence of a non-aqueous perfume or deodorizing base and at least one metal-free solvent dye which is soluble in the non-aqueous perfume or deodorizing base, or which is provided as a solution in a non-aqueous solvent which is compatible with the non-aqueous perfume or deodorizing base^<br>
By the term "functionalised liquid polymer" as used herein is meant a material which is liquid at room temperature and which has a viscosity of not more than 5 Pas at 25°C, preferably from 0.25 to 2.0 Pas.<br><br>
for example  JEFFAMINE  D-400,   JEFFAMINE EDR-14 and Jeffamine D-2000;<br>
polyoxyalkylenetriamines  such, as  those sold under the trade name JEFFAMINE   (Huntsman Corporation)   in particular the T series,   for example JEFFAMINE T-403.<br>
It  is  also possible to use as the cross-linking agent  polybutadiene having a hydroxylic functionality known as H?PB   (Revertex Limited)   which gellifies when admixed with maleinised polybutadiene.     Sometimes the use of specific catalysts allow a better control of the gel formation and examples of such catalysts are the tertiary amines   (e.g.  DAMA 1010;  origin:  Albermarle SA) .    Mixtures cf Kycar CTBN 1300 x 21 which is an amine terminated liquid polybutadiene/acrylonitrile copolymer   (origin: E.F.   Goodrich)   and maleinised polybutadiene are particularly advantageous.<br>
The  functionalised liquid polymer and the cross-linking agent are mixed in a molar ratio of between 3:1 and  5:1 preferably of about 1:1,   based on the molar ratio cf the functional groups which are present.<br>
The perfume base which is used in the device of the invention nay comprise any of the current bases used in perfumery.     These can be discrete chemicals;   more often, however,   they are more or less  complex mixtures of volatile  liquid ingredients of natural or synthetic origin.     The nature of  these ingredients can be found in specialised books of perfumery,   e.g.   in S.   Arctander Perfume  and Flavor Chemicals,   Montclair N.J.,   USA 1969) or Perfumery,   Wiley-Intersciences,  New York,   USA 1994.<br><br>
The perfume base may be replaced by a deodorising base,   such as a base which comprises a deodorising composition.<br>
The characteristic feature of all the compositions of the present invention is that the liquid polymer cros's-linking agent and dye which are used in the preparation of the gellified composition are all soluble in the perfume or deodorising base. Optionally, one or more of the liquid polymer, cross-linking agent or dye may be dissolved in a solvent which is compatible with the perfume of deodorising base, but generally this is not necessary since the components will dissolve in the active base.<br>
The perfume or deodorising base is non-aqueous and will generally constitute from 50 to 95V by weight, preferably from 60 to 90% by weight, more preferably from 70 to 85% by weight of the gel element.<br>
Optional additives which may be included in the gel composition include plasticisers such as diethylphthalate.<br>
Examples of suitable classes of dyes which may be used in the present invention are monoazo dyes, diazo dyes, anthraquinone dyes or methine dye, provided that the dyes are metal-free solvent dyes.  Specific examples of dyes which may be successfully used in rhe presenz invention are:<br>

Dyes such as those listed above are generally in powder form.  Accordingly, in order to be useful in the present invention the dye is generally soluble in the perfume or deodorising base.  Hovrever, it may be possible to use some dyes which are either net soluble in or insufficiently soluble in the said base by using the dyes as concentrated solutions in a ncn-aqueous solvent which is compatible with the base.<br>
Generally a relatively small amount of dye will be sufficient to colour the anhydrous gel, for example amounts of from 0.01 to 1.0% by weight, typically about 0.05% by weight based on the eel elemen", may be used.<br>
Many dyes cannot be used in the present invention. Examples of such dyes which either are not metal-free solvent dyes and/or are not scluble in the perfurr.e or deodorising base, are giver, below<br><br>

The anhydrous gel element of the present invention may be used as the active element of a solid state air freshening or deodorising device with the gel element being incorporated within a housing with one or more grilles which communicate with the ambient air.<br>
Alternatively^ the gel element may be formed in sit within the recesses or grooves of a solid casing or housing.  This type of device does not require the use c a grille to cover the gel element.  The recesses or grooves of the solid casing or housing are filled with, the mixture of functionalised liquid polymer, cross-linking agent, perfume or deodorising base and dye and the cross-linking reaction to form the gel takes place in situ.     The gel so-formed thus adheres to the sides and/or bottom of the recesses or groove in order to provide an integral structure.<br>
