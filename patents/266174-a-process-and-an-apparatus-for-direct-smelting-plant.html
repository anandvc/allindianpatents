				<td>DIRECT SMELTING PLANT AND PROCESS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a direct<br>
smelting plant and a direct smelting process for producing<br>
molten metal from a metalliferous feed material such as<br>
ores, partly reduced ores and metal-containing waste<br>
streams.<br>
The term "smelting" is herein understood to mean<br>
thermal processing wherein chemical reactions that reduce<br>
metalliferous feed material take place to produce molten<br>
metal.<br>
A known direct smelting process, which relies<br>
principally on a molten bath as a reaction medium, and is<br>
generally referred to as the HIsmelt process, is described<br>
in International application PCT/AU96/00197 (WO 96/31627)<br>
and other patent applications, such as the more recently<br>
filed International applications PCT/AU2004/000473<br>
(W02004/090174) and PCT/AU2004/000472 (WO2004/090173)<br>
(which focuses on producing molten iron from iron ore<br>
fines) in the name of the applicant.<br>
The HIsmelt process includes the steps of:<br>
(a) forming a bath of molten metal and slag in a<br>
direct smelting vessel;<br>
(b) injecting into the bath:<br>
(i) a metalliferous feed material,<br>
typically metal oxides; and<br>
(ii) a solid carbonaceous material,<br>
typically coal, which acts as a<br>
reductant of the metalliferous feed<br>
material and a source of energy; and<br>
(c) smelting the metalliferous feed material to<br>
metal in the metal layer.<br>
In the HIsmelt process the metalliferous feed<br>
material and solid carbonaceous material are injected into<br>
the molten bath through solids delivery means in the form<br>
of lances which are inclined to the vertical so as to<br>
extend downwardly and inwardly through the side wall of the<br>
direct smelting vessel and into a lower region of the<br>
vessel so as to deliver at least part of the solids<br>
material into the metal layer in the bottom of the vessel.<br>
The HIsmelt process also includes post-combusting<br>
reaction gases, such as CO and Ha released from the bath,<br>
with a blast of hot air, which may be oxygen-enriched, that<br>
is injected into an upper region of the vessel through at<br>
least one downwardly extending hot air injection lance and<br>
transferring the heat generated by the post-combustion to<br>
the bath to contribute to the thermal energy required to<br>
smelt the metalliferous feed materials.<br>
The hot air is produced in stoves and is supplied<br>
to the lance or lances via a refractory brick-lined hot<br>
blast main. The stoves consist of at least two individual<br>
stoves that cycle between two phases, a heating phase and a<br>
heat exchange phase. In the heat exchange phase a stove<br>
provides hot air at greater than 1000°C (herein after<br>
called "pre-heated air") to the hot air injection lance,<br>
and in the heating phase the stove regenerates the heat<br>
within its internal construction via combustion of a fuel<br>
and passing combustion products through the stove. The<br>
operation of the stoves is coordinated so that there is<br>
always at least one stove in its heat exchange phase and<br>
providing pre-heated air at any point in time.<br>
Off-gases resulting from the post-combustion of<br>
reaction gases in the vessel are taken away from the upper<br>
part of the vessel through an off-gas duct. The vessel<br>
includes refractory-lined water cooled panels in the side<br>
wall and the roof of the vessel, and water is circulated<br>
continuously through the panels in a continuous circuit.<br>
The HIsmelt process enables large quantities of<br>
molten metal, such as molten iron, to be produced by direct<br>
smelting in a single compact vessel.<br>
However, in order to achieve this it is necessary<br>
to supply to the vessel large quantities of (a) solid feed<br>
materials, such as iron-containing feed materials,<br>
carbonaceous material, and fluxes, to the solids injection<br>
lances, and (b) pre-heated air via the hot air injection<br>
lance or lances.<br>
The supply of solid feed materials and pre-heated<br>
air to the direct smelting vessel must continue throughout<br>
a smelting campaign, which desirably is at least 12 months,<br>
and it is important that the supply of these materials be<br>
provided reliably during the period of a smelting campaign.<br>
At the end of a smelting campaign the direct<br>
smelting vessel is shut-down to allow maintenance work,<br>
which typically includes a partial re-line or a complete<br>
re-line of the internal refractory lining of the vessel.<br>
The shut-down period may vary considerably depending on the<br>
circumstances, ranging from periods as short as 1 month to<br>
considerably longer periods. Typically, the shut-down<br>
periods will be 8 weeks. Preferably the shut-down period<br>
is the shortest possible time.<br>
One of the issues that face operators of the<br>
HI smelt process is that it is not a desirable option to<br>
completely shut-down stoves that are used to produce preheated<br>
air for the process at the end of a smelting<br>
campaign of only 12-18 months. This is an entirely<br>
different situation to that with hot air stoves used with<br>
blast furnaces. Blast furnaces typically operate for 20<br>
years before requiring a re-line, and it is a viable option<br>
to completely shut-down blast furnace stoves after this<br>
length of service.<br>
It is also not a practical option to continue to<br>
operate stoves during a shut-down of a direct smelting<br>
vessel in the same way that the stoves operate during a<br>
smelting campaign, i.e. producing very high flow rates of<br>
pre-heated air. Specifically, it is an entirely uneconomic<br>
proposition to operate stoves in that way while there is no<br>
production of metal in the direct smelting vessel.<br>
Further, the gas used as a fuel during normal<br>
operation of stoves is usually off-gas from the smelting<br>
vessel, and this is typically not available during a shutdown.<br>
It is known in a temporary shut~down of a<br>
smelting vessel, during which shut-down pre-heated air from<br>
stoves is not required, to continue to combust gas in the<br>
combustion chamber of a stove temporarily and to vent the<br>
combusted gas through the dome of the stove. However this<br>
does not maintain the refractory brick-lined hot blast main<br>
in a hot state, which can lead to problems with brick-work<br>
and expansion joints in the hot blast main.<br>
In the circumstances, there is a need for a cost<br>
effective process that maintains the stoves and the hot<br>
blast main during the course of a shut-down in a way that<br>
minimises damage to the equipment.<br>
The present invention provides a cost effective<br>
and reliable process and plant for maintaining the stoves<br>
and the hot blast main during a shut-down of a direct<br>
smelting vessel.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a process and an<br>
apparatus that maintains stoves and a hot blast main that<br>
connects the stoves to a hot air (or hot oxygen-enriched<br>
air) injection lance or lances of a direct smelting vessel<br>
during the course of a shut-down of the vessel.<br>
In particular, the process maintains the<br>
temperatures of the stoves and the hot blast main within<br>
temperature ranges that minimise damage to the stoves and<br>
the hot blast main.<br>
According to the present invention there is<br>
provided a process for maintaining stoves and a hot blast<br>
main that connects the stoves to a hot air (or hot oxygenenriched<br>
air) injection lance or lances of a direct<br>
smelting vessel in a hot state during the course of a shutdown<br>
of the vessel, which process comprises:<br>
(a) isolating the hot blast main from the hot<br>
air (or hot oxygen-enriched air) injection<br>
lance or lances;<br>
(b) operating a burner of each stove using a<br>
fuel gas and a stream of air and generating<br>
a stream of combustion products that flow<br>
along a gas pathway of the stove from one<br>
end towards an opposite end thereof and<br>
thereby heat refractory oheckerwork of the<br>
stove in a heating phase of the stove; and<br>
 (c) transferring heat from each stove to the hot<br>
blast main in a heat exchange phase of the<br>
stove by supplying a stream of air to the<br>
said opposite end of the gas pathway and<br>
thereafter successively passing the stream<br>
of air through the gas pathway of the stove<br>
and the hot blast main, whereby the air<br>
stream is heated by heat exchange with<br>
refractory checkerwork of the stove and the<br>
stove is cooled by such heat exchange and<br>
the resultant hot air stream heats the hot<br>
blast main.<br>
During a shut-down of the vessel the main<br>
objective is to ensure that the stoves and the hot blast<br>
main are maintained within operating temperature ranges<br>
that avoid damage to the stoves and the hot blast main.<br>
The applicant has realised that this objective can be<br>
achieved by operating the stoves during a shut-down to<br>
create significantly different heat transfer conditions<br>
than the heat transfer conditions that are required during<br>
normal operation of the stoves to supply a hot air blast to<br>
the direct smelting vessel. The applicant has realised<br>
further that the volumetric flow rates of combustion<br>
products and hot air through the stoves are important<br>
factors in creating the required heat transfer conditions<br>
during a shut-down. In addition, the applicant has<br>
realised that the volumetric flow rates of combustion<br>
products and hot air through the stoves can be delivered by<br>
the combustion air fan that is used conventionally to<br>
supply combustion air to the burner of a stove for the<br>
heating phase of the stove. Thus, the combustion air fan<br>
can be used advantageously as a dual function fan to supply<br>
air for the heating phase and the heat exchange phase<br>
during a shut-down. In addition, the applicant has<br>
realised that a modified construction of the hot blast main<br>
is advantageous to optimise maintaining the stoves and the<br>
hot blast main during a shut-down.<br>
Preferably the process includes coordinating<br>
operation of the heating phase and the heat exchange phase<br>
of each stove during the shut-down so that the stoves<br>
supply a continuous hot air stream to the hot blast main<br>
during the shut-down.<br>
Preferably the volumetric flow rate of the<br>
combustion products produced in step (b) during the shutdown<br>
is relatively small compared to the volumetric flow<br>
rate of the combustion products produced during heating<br>
phases of the stoves when the stoves are operating under<br>
normal operating conditions with the hot blast main<br>
connected to the hot air injection lance ox lances.<br>
Preferably the volumetric flow rate of the<br>
combustion products produced in step (b) during the shutdown<br>
is 50% or less of the volumetric flow rate of the<br>
combustion products produced during the normal heating<br>
phases of the stoves.<br>
More preferably the volumetric flow rate of the<br>
combustion products produced in step (b) during the shutdown<br>
is 40% or less of the volumetric flow rate of the<br>
combustion products produced during the normal heating<br>
phases of the stoves.<br>
Preferably the volumetric flow rate of the hot<br>
air produced in step <c during the shut-down is relatively></c>
small compared to the volumetric flow rate of the hot air<br>
produced during heat exchange phases of the stoves when the<br>
stoves are operating under normal operating conditions with<br>
the hot blast main connected to the hot air injection lance<br>
or lances.<br>
Preferably the volumetric flow rate of the hot<br>
air produced in step (c) during the shut-down is 50% or<br>
less of the volumetric flow rate of the hot air produced<br>
during the normal heat exchange phases of the stoves.<br>
More preferably the volumetric flow rate of the<br>
hot air produced in step (c) during the shut-down is 40% or<br>
less of the volumetric flow rate of the hot air produced<br>
during the normal heat exchange phases of the stoves.<br>
Preferably the process includes using the same<br>
fan or fans to supply the streams of air to each stove<br>
during the heating and the heat exchange phases of the<br>
stove during the shutdown.<br>
Preferably the hot air produced in step (c) vents<br>
through a vent means connected to the hot blast main.<br>
Preferably the vent means is located proximate a<br>
forward end of the hot blast main, ie the end that is<br>
connected to the hot air injection lance or lances.<br>
Preferably the fuel gas is natural gas.<br>
The process may comprise additional steps during<br>
the shut-down to the above-described steps.<br>
For example, the process may comprise a further<br>
step of transferring heat from one or more of the stoves by<br>
supplying a stream of air to the opposite end of the gas<br>
pathway of the stove or stoves and thereafter successively<br>
passing the air stream through the gas pathway and<br>
thereafter venting the air stream without passing the air<br>
stream through the hot blast main, whereby the air stream<br>
is heated by heat exchange with refractory checfcerwork. of<br>
the stove or stoves and the stove or stoves is cooled by<br>
such heat exchange. This process step is appropriate in<br>
situations where the temperature of the hot blast main is<br>
within a suitable temperature range and further heat<br>
transfer to the main is not required and the stove or<br>
stoves in question are above a minimum shut-down<br>
temperature and can accommodate further heat transfer to<br>
the air stream. More preferably, this process step<br>
includes venting the hot air stream from the stove or<br>
stoves by passing the stream through off gas supply mains<br>
for the stove or stoves.<br>
By way of further example, the process may<br>
comprise a further step of "bottling" one or more of the<br>
stoves altogether for a time period during the shut-down.<br>
As with the preceding paragraph, this process step is<br>
appropriate in situations where the temperature of the hot<br>
blast main is within a suitable temperature range and<br>
further heat transfer to the main is not required at that<br>
time and the stove or stoves in question are above a<br>
minimum shut-down temperature.<br>
In any situation, the duration of the abovedescribed<br>
process steps during the shut-down will be<br>
determined by reference to a range of factors, including<br>
the factors discussed in the following paragraphs.<br>
Typically, each stove has a main heat exchange<br>
chamber that is packed with refractory checkerwork and the<br>
said opposite end section of the gas pathway is in a lower<br>
section of the chamber and extends in a tortuous path<br>
upwardly through the checkerwork. Typically further, the<br>
checkerwork is supported on a metal grid in the lower<br>
section of the chamber.<br>
It is important that the heating phase during a<br>
shut-down does not heat the checkerwork support grid to<br>
temperatures at which the grid loses appreciable mechanical<br>
strength, ie loss of mechanical strength to an extent that<br>
the internal structural integrity of the refractory<br>
checkerwork is compromised.<br>
In such a situation, preferably the process<br>
includes operating the heating phase of each stove during<br>
the shut-down until the temperature in the lower section of<br>
the main chamber, and more preferably the checkerwork<br>
support grid, approaches but does not reach a temperature<br>
at which the checkerwork support grid loses appreciable<br>
mechanical strength.<br>
Typically, the checkerwork support grid is formed<br>
from cast iron. Cast iron starts to lose mechanical<br>
strength to an extent that is cause for concern at<br>
temperatures above 350°C.<br>
In such situations, preferably the process<br>
includes operating the heating phase of each stove during<br>
the shut-down until the temperature in the lower section of<br>
the main chamber of the stove approaches but does not reach<br>
350°C.<br>
By way of further example, typically, each stove<br>
includes a dome section that is lined with silica bricks.<br>
Silica bricks undergo a phase change at 875°C that results<br>
in a volume change and is undesirable on this basis to cool<br>
the dome section to temperatures at or below the phase<br>
change temperature during the shut-down.<br>
In a situation in which one or more than one<br>
stove includes silica bricks in the dome section,<br>
preferably the process includes controlling the process<br>
during the shut-down so that the temperature of the dome<br>
section of the stove or stoves remains above the phase<br>
change temperature.<br>
By way of further example, typically, the hot<br>
blast main includes a plurality of refractory brick lined<br>
sections and a plurality of expansion joints that<br>
interconnect the bricked sections. In such a situation,<br>
thermal cycling can cause damage to the brickwork and the<br>
joints and is undesirable on this basis.<br>
Accordingly, preferably the process includes<br>
controlling the process during the shut-down so that there<br>
is minimal temperature cycling within the hot blast main.<br>
According to the present invention there is also<br>
provided an apparatus for pre-heating air for a direct<br>
smelting plant for producing molten metal from a<br>
metalliferous feed material, which apparatus comprises:<br>
(a) a plurality of stoves for producing streams<br>
of pre-heated air for a direct smelting<br>
plant;<br>
(b) a hot blast main for supplying pre-heated<br>
air from the stoves to a gas injection means<br>
extending into a direct smelting vessel when<br>
the plant is operating and producing molten<br>
metal from a metalliferous feed material in<br>
the vessel when the plant is operating under<br>
normal operating conditions;<br>
(c) a fuel gas supply means for supplying fuel<br>
gas to a burner of each stove during normal<br>
operating conditions of the plant and during<br>
a shut-down of the vessel;<br>
(d) a first air supply means fox supplying air<br>
(i) to the burner of each stove during a<br>
heating phase of the stove during normal<br>
operating conditions of the plant, and (ii)<br>
to the burner of each stove during a heating<br>
phase of the stove during a shut-down of the<br>
vessel;<br>
(e) a second air supply means for supplying air<br>
to each stove during a heat exchange phase<br>
of the stove during normal operating<br>
conditions of the plant:;<br>
(f) a vent in the hot blast: main for allowing<br>
streams of hot air generated in the heat<br>
exchange phase of each stove to flow from<br>
the hot blast main after flowing through and<br>
heating the main.<br>
Preferably the vent includes an end plug that<br>
closes an outlet end of the vent when a direct smelting<br>
process is operating and is removed from the vent when<br>
there is a shut-down of the vessel.<br>
Preferably the vent defines a serpentine pathway<br>
between the hot blast main and the outlet end of the vent.<br>
The purpose of the serpentine pathway is to avoid straight<br>
line exposure of the end plug to radiant heat from the hot<br>
blast main during operation of a direct smelting process<br>
when the plug is in place and closes the outlet end.<br>
Preferably the vent extends horizontally<br>
outwardly from the hot blast main and then upwardly and<br>
inwardly to a position above the hot blast main and<br>
thereafter upwardly to the outlet end.<br>
The term "horizontally" is understood herein to<br>
include arrangements that are within 15° above or below a<br>
horizontal arrangement.<br>
Preferably the vent is located proximate a<br>
forward end of the hot blast main, ie the end that is<br>
connected to the hot air injection lance or lances.<br>
Preferably the first air supply means is adapted<br>
to supply air to a separate inlet of eaoh stove during a<br>
heat exchange phase of the stove during a shut-down of the<br>
vessel when the second air supply means is not operational.<br>
Preferably the apparatus comprises a valve means<br>
enables the first air supply means to switch from supplyingair<br>
to the burner of each stove to the separate inlet of<br>
the stove as required during a shut-down of the vessel.<br>
According to the present invention there is also<br>
provided a direct smelting plant for producing molten metal<br>
from a metalliferous feed material which comprises:<br>
(a) a direct smelting vessel to hold a molten<br>
bath of metal and slag and a gas space<br>
above the bath;<br>
(b) a solids feed means to supply solid feed<br>
material into the vessel;<br>
(c) a gas injection means extending downwardly<br>
into the vessel to inject pre-heated air<br>
into the gas space above the bath;<br>
(d) an off-gas duct means for facilitating flow<br>
of off-gas from the vessel away from the<br>
vessel;<br>
(e) a metal and slag tapping means for tapping<br>
molten metal and slag from the bath and<br>
transporting that molten metal away from<br>
the vessel; and<br>
(f) the above-described apparatus for preheating<br>

pressure to the stoves 27 during normal operation of the<br>
stoves 27, two combustion air fans 35 and combustion air<br>
transfer lines 39a and 39b for supplying air at ambient<br>
temperature and pressure to the stoves 27 during both<br>
normal operation of the vessel and also during a shut-down<br>
of the vessel 11. The transfer lines 37, 39a and 39b<br>
include control valves to control flow of air through the<br>
lines.<br>
The vessel 11 is of the type described in detail<br>
in the above-mentioned International applications<br>
PCT/AU2004/000473 (W02004/090174) and PCT/AU2004/000472<br>
(W02004/090173), and the disclosure in the patent<br>
speoifications lodged with these applications is<br>
incorporated herein by cross-reference.<br>
With reference initially to Figure 2, the vessel<br>
11 has a hearth 13, a generally cylindrical barrel IS<br>
extending upwardly from the hearth, an annular roof 17, an<br>
off-gas chamber 19, an off-gas duct 21 for discharging offgases,<br>
a forehearth 23 for discharging molten metal<br>
continuously, and a tap-hole (not shown) for discharging<br>
molten slag during smelting.<br>
The vessel 11 also includes a hot air injection<br>
lance 41 for delivering a hot air blast into an upper<br>
region of the vessel 11. The lance is positioned centrally<br>
to extend downwardly through the off-gas chamber 19 into an<br>
upper region of the barrel 15. Only an upper section of<br>
the hot air injection lance 41 is visible in Figure 2. The<br>
lance is connected to the hot blast main 29.<br>
With reference to the Figures generally, the<br>
vessel 11 also includes a plurality of solids injection<br>
lances (not shown) extending downwardly and inwardly<br>
through openings (not shown) in the side walls of the lowerbarrel<br>
15 for injecting iron ore fines, solid carbonaceous<br>
material, and fluxes entrained in an oxygen-deficient<br>
carrier gas into the vessel.<br>
The off-gas duct 21 of the vessel 11 transports<br>
the off-gas away from the vessel 11. The off-gas is split<br>
into two streams, with one stream going to the stoves 27<br>
and the other stream going to a treatment station (not<br>
shown) for preheating the iron ore fed to the vessel 11.<br>
The off-gas duct 21 includes a gently inclined first<br>
section 2la extending from the upper barrel 19 of the<br>
vessel 11 and a vertically extending second section 21b<br>
that extends from the first section 21a.<br>
The hot blast main 29 is a refractory brick lined<br>
main that, typically at least is 75m long, of circular<br>
cross-section - as shown in Figures 2 to 4.<br>
The hot blast main 29 includes a vent 61 near the<br>
downstream end thereof, proximate the hot air injection<br>
lance 41.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the vent 61 as it is<br>
arranged for operation of the HIsmelt process and Figure 4<br>
illustrates the vent 61 as it is arranged during a shutdown<br>
of the HIsmelt process.<br>
The main difference between the 2 arrangements is<br>
that the Figure 3 arrangement includes an end plug 91 that<br>
seals the vent 61 during operation of the HZsmelt process<br>
and the Figure 4 arrangement includes an elbow section 93<br>
that replaces the end plug 91 during a shut-down period.<br>
The purpose of the elbow section 93 is to direct hot air<br>
flow from the vent 61 away from equipment in the vicinity<br>
of the vent and to prevent water flow into the vent 61.<br>
A further difference is that in the arrangement<br>
of Figure 4, a blanking plate (not shown) is typically<br>
installed into the hot blast main 29 adjacent the hot air<br>
blast lance 41 during a shut down of the HIsmelt process.<br>
The blanking plate serves to isolate the hot blast main 29<br>
from the hot air blast lance 41 and thereby ensures that<br>
the entire hot air flow supplied to the hot blast main<br>
during a shut-down of the vessel, as described hereinafter,<br>
flows through vent 61.<br>
With reference to Figures 3 and 4, the vent 61<br>
defines a serpentine pathway for hot air to flow from the<br>
hot blast main 29 to atmosphere during non-operation of the<br>
vessel. The purpose of the serpentine pathway is to avoid<br>
straight line exposure of the end plug 91 to radiant heat<br>
from the hot blast main 29 during operation of the HXsmelt<br>
process when the plug 91 is in place.<br>
The vent 61 includes a U-shaped section that has<br>
one arm 68 that extends horizontally outwardly from the hot<br>
blast main 27, a base 65 that extends vertically upwardly,<br>
and another arm 67 that extends horizontally inwardly to a<br>
position above the hot blast main 27. The vent 61 also<br>
includes a vertical section 69 that extends upwardly from<br>
the arm 67 of the U-shaped section.<br>
In the arrangements shown in Figures 3 and 4, the<br>
arm 68 and half of the base 65 of the U-shaped section of<br>
the vent 61 are lined with refractory bricks. The<br>
remainder of the vent 61 includes a lining of a castable<br>
material.<br>
In a. smelting operation in accordance with the<br>
HI smelt process, the vessel 11 contains a molten bath of<br>
iron and slag which includes a layer of molten metal and a<br>
layer of molten slag on the metal layer. A suitable carrier<br>
gas transports iron ore fines, coal and flux into the<br>
molten bath through the solids injection lances. The<br>
momentum of the solid materials and the . carrier gas causes<br>
the solid materials to penetrate the metal layer in the<br>
vessel 11. The coal is devolatilised and thereby produces<br>
gas in the metal layer. Carbon partially dissolves in the<br>
metal and partially remains as solid carbon. The ore fines<br>
are smelted to metal and the smelting reaction generates<br>
carbon monoxide. The gases transported into the metal<br>
layer and generated by devolatilisation and smelting<br>
reactions produce significant buoyancy uplift of molten<br>
metal, solid carbon and slag (drawn into the metal layer as<br>
a consequence of solid/gas injection) that generates upward<br>
movement of splashes, droplets and streams of molten metal,<br>
solid carbon, and slag. These splashes, droplets and<br>
streams entrain slag as they move through the slag layer.<br>
The buoyancy uplift of molten metal, solid carbon and slag<br>
causes substantial agitation of the slag layer in the<br>
vessel, with the result that the slag layer expands in<br>
volume. In addition, the upward movement of splashes,<br>
droplets and streams of molten metal, solid carbon and slag<br>
extend into the space above the molten bath and form a<br>
transition zone.<br>
Injection of the hot air via the hot air<br>
injection lance 41 post-combusts reaction gases, such as<br>
carbon monoxide and hydrogen (which are liberated during<br>
coal devolatilisation and smelting reactions) , in the upper<br>
part of the vessel. Off-gases resulting from the postcombustion<br>
of reaction gases in the vessel are taken away<br>
from the upper part of the vessel through the off-gas duct<br>
21. Hot metal produced during a smelting operation is<br>
discharged from the vessel 11 through a metal tapping<br>
system that includes the forebearth 23.<br>
Post-combustion of reaction gases generates<br>
substantial heat and a proportion of the heat transfers to<br>
the splashes, droplets and streams of molten metal, solid<br>
carbon and slag and the heat transfers to the molten bath<br>
when the splashes droplets and streams return to the bath.<br>
The transferred heat to the bath facilitates the<br>
endothermic smelting reactions in the bath.<br>
With reference to Figure 5, each stove 27 is of a<br>
conventional form and includes a burner (not shown) and an<br>
upright cylindrical structure (with a domed top 81) formed<br>
from an outer metal shell 83 and a refractory brick<br>
internal lining 85 and an internal vertical partition 87<br>
that divides the structure into a combustion chamber 51 on<br>
one side of the partition and a main heat exchange chamber<br>
57 on the other side of the partition. The heat exchange<br>
chamber 57 and the combustion chamber 51 are interconnected<br>
by a domed section 55. Together, the heat exchange chamber<br>
57, the domed section 55, and the combustion chamber 51<br>
define a gas pathway through the stove.<br>
During a heating phase of each stove 27 when the<br>
vessel 11 is smelting, the burner produces a stream of<br>
combustion products which pass to the combustion chamber 51<br>
and flow upwardly through the combustion chamber 51 into<br>
the domed section 55 of the stove 27. The combustion<br>
products then flow downwardly through a network of<br>
refractory checkerwork in the main heat exchange chamber 57<br>
of the stove 27 and heat the checkers. Thereafter, the<br>
now-cooler combustion products flow from the stove 27 via<br>
an opening 59 in a lower section of the heat exchange<br>
chamber 57. The lower section of the heat exchange chamber<br>
57 is formed as a plenum chamber 64 to facilitate gas flow .<br>
In this context, the stove 27 includes a horizontallydisposed<br>
grid 63 supported by colxuons 65 that supports the<br>
checkers. The grid 63 and the columns 65 are formed from<br>
cast iron.<br>
During the heating phase of each stove 27 when<br>
the vessel 11 is smelting, fuel gas in the form of<br>
discharged off-gas from the vessel 11 is supplied to the<br>
burner (not shown) and ambient temperature combustion air<br>
is supplied to the burner via the combustion air fan 35 and.<br>
the transfer line 39b for the stove 27 (Figure 1) and the<br>
combustion products produced by the burner heat the stove<br>
27.<br>
In a heat exchange phase of each stove 27 when<br>
the vessel 11 is smelting, the burner is not operated and a.<br>
stream of air is directed through the stove 27 in the<br>
opposite direction to the stream of combustion products.<br>
Specifically, air is supplied to the opening 59 in the<br>
stove 27 and flows upwardly from the plenum chamber 64<br>
through the heat exchange chamber 57. The air stream is<br>
heated by heat exchange with the checkers as the air stream<br>
flows through the heat exchange chamber 57. The hot air<br>
flows around the dome section 55 and downwardly through the<br>
combustion chamber 51 and leaves the chamber via hot blast<br>
opening 71 in a lower section of the combustion chamber 51.<br>
The hot blast opening 71 is connected to the hot blast main<br>
29.<br>
During the heat exchange phase of each stove 27<br>
when the vessel 11 is smelting, air under pressure<br>
(referred to as "cold blast") is supplied to the transfer<br>
line 37 for the stove 27 (Figure 1) from the cold blast<br>
blower 31, which is a high pressure fan that can deliver<br>
high flow rates of pressurised air. The resulting stream<br>
of heated air that exits the stove 27 through hot blast<br>
opening 71 is referred to as "hot blast" or "hot air<br>
blast". The hot blast flows along the hot blast main 29 to<br>
the hot air injection lance 41 in the direct smelting<br>
vessel 11.<br>
Typically, the HIsmelt process requires a<br>
constant flow of hot blast at a temperature of 1200°C when<br>
the vessel 11 is smelting. To achieve this, the refractory<br>
in the domed section 55 of each stove 27 is heated to<br>
temperatures above 1200°C during heating phases of each<br>
stove 27 so that the initial hot blast from the stove 7 has<br>
a temperature above the required 1200 °C. The cold blast is<br>
supplied to the stove 27 until its temperature drops to<br>
1200°C, whereupon the stove re-enters the heating phase and.<br>
hot blast is obtained from the other stove 27. To achieve<br>
a constant hot blast temperature of 1200°C, some of the<br>
cold blast is mixed with the hot blast via a mixing valve<br>
43 (see the Figure 6 embodiment) so that the average<br>
temperature of the hot blast is the required 1200°C.<br>
During a smelting operation the HIsmelt process<br>
requires substantial amounts of hot air. Therefore, the<br>
cold blast blower 31 must be capable of producing a<br>
substantial flow rate of air to and then through the stoves<br>
27 and along the hot blast main 29 to the hot air injection<br>
lance 41. In addition, the stoves 27 and the hot blast<br>
main 29 must be substantial in size in order to accommodate<br>
the large flow rate of air. Typically, the cold blast<br>
blower 31 delivers approximately 110,000 Nm3/h of air<br>
pressurised at approximately 170kPa (gauge). The cold<br>
blast may be enriched with approximately 30,000 Nm3/h of<br>
Oxygen so that the stoves produce approximately 140,000<br>
Nm3/h of hot air that is supplied to the hot blast main and<br>
smelt reduction vessel during normal operation. The<br>
combustion air fans deliver approximately 74,000 Nm3/h of<br>
air at a. pressure of approximately 13kPa (gauge) .<br>
The stoves 27 apso operate during a shut-down of<br>
the vessel 11 in order to maintain the temperature in the<br>
stoves 27 and the hot blast main 29.<br>
Specifically, each stove 27 operates with heating<br>
and heat exchange phases during a shut-down of the vessel.<br>
These phases maintain the temperature of the stoves 27<br>
within a required temperature range and transfer heat to<br>
the hot blast main 29 to maintain the temperature of the<br>
hot blast main 29 within a required temperature range.<br>
During the heating phase of each stove 27 when<br>
the vessel 11 is shut-down (and there is no off-gas<br>
available as a source of energy), natural gas is supplied<br>
to the burner from a source (not shown) via natural gas<br>
main 91 and a transfer line 93 and ambient temperature<br>
combustion air is supplied to the burner via the combustion<br>
air fan 35 and the transfer line 39b (Figure 1) and the<br>
combustion products produced by the burner heat the stove<br>
27. Typically, the combustion products heat the domed<br>
section 55 of the stove 27 to temperatures of the order of<br>
1250°C. The heating phase continues until the temperature<br>
of the cast iron horizontally-disposed checker support grid<br>
63 and columns 65 approaches but does not reach 350°C. The<br>
basis for the selection of the temperature of 350°C is that<br>
cast iron starts to lose appreciable mechanical strength<br>
above this temperature.<br>
During the heat exchange phase of each stove 27<br>
during a shut-down of the vessel 11 the cold blast supplied<br>
to the opening 59 of the stove 27 via the cold blast blower<br>
31 when the vessel 11 is smelting is replaced by air at<br>
ambient temperature and pressure. This air is supplied to<br>
the transfer line 37 from the combustion air fan 35 for the<br>
stove 27 via the transfer line 39a (Figure 1). The<br>
resulting hot air stream exits the stoves 27, via hot blast<br>
opening 71, and flows along the hot blast main 29 to the<br>
vent 61 from which it discharges. The hot air stream<br>
heats the main 29 so that the temperature in the main 29 is<br>
above a predetermined minimum temperature. The combustion<br>
air fan 35 delivers a. sufficient flow rate of air to meet<br>
the heat transfer requirements during a shut-down. The<br>
heat exhange phase continues until the dome section 55 of<br>
the stove cools to 900°C. At temperatures below this<br>
temperature silica bricks in the domed section 55 undergo a<br>
phase changes that results in an undesirable volume change<br>
of the bricks.<br>
Preferably the timing of the heating and heat<br>
exchange phases for both stoves 27 during a shut-down are<br>
controlled so that there is no overlap of these phases and<br>
one stove 27 operates in the heating phase while the other<br>
stove operates in the heat exchange phase and vice versa.<br>
The process also includes an optional step of<br>
diverting the heated air streams produced in the heat<br>
exchange phases of the stoves 27 away from the hot blast<br>
main 29 in situations where the main is within a required<br>
temperature range and further heating is not required.<br>
The process also includes an optional step of<br>
bottling the stoves 27 altogether, again in situations<br>
where the stoves and the hot blast main 29 are within a<br>
required temperature range and further heating is not<br>
required.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates an alternative, although not<br>
the only possible alternative embodiment, to the embodiment<br>
shown in Figure 1. Both embodiments include combustion air<br>
fans. However, in Figure 1, the fans operate independently<br>
and supply separate combustion air transfer lines 39a and<br>
39b. In Figure € the fans operate to supply a single<br>
combustion air main 42 which then feeds combustion air<br>
transfer lines 39a and 39b. This provides some redundancy<br>
in the combustion air system and allows for maintenance on.<br>
the fans during a smelting campaign. It also allows the<br>
fans to operate in tandem so that a combined air flow can<br>
be provided.<br>
Many modifications may be made to the embodiments<br>
of the present invention described above without departing<br>
from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
By way of example, whilst the present invention<br>
has been described in the context of a direct smelting<br>
process, it can readily be appreciated that the described<br>
process for maintaining the stoves and hot blast main is<br>
not so limited and extends to stoves and hot blast mains<br>
that are used in other applications.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
