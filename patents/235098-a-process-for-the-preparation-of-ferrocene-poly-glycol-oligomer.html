				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  a  process for the  preparation  of Ferrocene Poly Glycol Oligomer (FPGO). PRIOR ART :<br>
High burning rate composite propellants are needed for futuristic programs, particularly in surface to air mission to reduce the operational time of the missiles. Commonly used ballistic modifiers, such as ferric oxide or copper chromite do not meet these objectives as their addition, beyond an optimum limit, leads to high end-of- propellant mix viscosity.<br>
During recent times, liquid ferrocenes such as n-butyl ferrocene and catocene are getting attention as ballistic modifiers due to their plasticisation capability. These catalysts not only overcome the problem of high end-of-propellant mix viscosity but also allow a high level of solid (oxidizer and metal fuel) fillers, resulting in superior ballistics.<br>
One of the severe drawbacks of these ferrocenes, known in the prior art, is that they migrate out of the propellants resulting in change in composition of the propellant.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of these ferrocenes, known in the prior art, is that these come in contact with liners and insulators and, thereby, adversely affecting the pre-programmed combustion pattern.<br>
Still another disadvantage of these ferrocines is that when used as ballistic modifiers, these result in the formation of aerosol during processing due<br>
to  high  volatility  thereby  posing  fire  hazards  in  presence  of  ammonium perch lorate<br>
In order to overcome migration problem, the recent approach, known in the prior art, involves chemical grafting of ferrocene catalyst on HTPB binder. This grafted pre polymer is referred as ' Butacene'. The burning rates of Butacene based propellants are comparable to those incorporating traditional non bonded ferrocenes like n-butyl ferrocene. However, these butacenes, already known in the art, also suffer from disadvantages.<br>
The major problem of "Butacene' is that its synthesis is tedious involving several steps. The first step involves the preparation of organosilicon ferrocene derivative like Fc-R-Si H(CH3)2 ( R= alkyl or phenyl group),where reaction conditions &amp; work up is critical due to susceptibility of silicon derivative to moisture resulting in decomposition. In the second step, organosilicon ferrocene obtained is added to hydroxy terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) through hydrosilation reactions in presence of a "Platinum" based catalyst. The process is cost intensive due to platinum based catalyst and lower yields. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION :<br>
Primary object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Ferrocene Poly, Glycol Oligomer (FPGO) from bis (hydroxy ethyl) ferrocene and 1,4 butane diol.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for preparation of composite propellant incorporating FPGO of the present invention which does not suffer from aerosol formation and migration.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Ferrocene Poly Glycol Oligomer (FPGO), which does not migrate to the surface of propellant.<br>
Yet further object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of FPGO which forms the backbone of the polymer and which does not get oxidised.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Ferrocene Poly Glycol Oligomer (FPGO), which is nonvolatile.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Ferrocene Poly Glycol Oligomer (FPGO), which is liquid with better thermal stability.<br>
Yet further object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Ferrocene Poly Glycol Oligomer (FPGO), which is miscible with HTPB binder.<br>

The Synthesis involves reaction of ferrocene, acetyl chloride &amp; AlCl3 preferably in the mole ratio of 1: 2.6-2.8: 2.4 -3, respectively, in suitable solvent. Initially, acetyl chloride is added drop wise to AICI3at about 20-30°C within 30-40 minutes. Next, ferrocene is added to this solution under continuous stirring while maintaining the temperature to 23-27 °C. Subsequently, the contents are poured over crushed ice and the crude product obtained is purified by recrystallisation in cyclohexane. (ii) Preparing Bis ( hvdroxy ethyl) ferrocene (BHEF)<br>
0.1 - 0.2 M of diacetyl   ferrocene, obtained from step (i), is reduced completely to bis (hydroxy ethyl)ferrocene with   0.7- 0.8 M sodium borohydride<br>
in 12 - 16 M  isopropanoi. Diacetyle ferrocene is added to sodium borohydride and the mixture is heated to 75-85°C under continuous stirring for about 2 hours. The product obtained is recrystallised in n-heptane. (iii) Co-polvmerising bis (hvdroxv ethyl) ferrocene (BHEF) with 1,4 butane diol<br>
Bis (hydroxy ethyl)ferrocene, obtained from step (ii) is copolymerised with 1,4 butane diol by condensing 0.1 - 0.2 M bis hydroxy ethyl ferrocene with 0.5 -0.6 M of 1,4butane diol, under nitrogen, in presence of 0.003 - 0.005 M boron trifluoride etherate (in 10 -15 cc of diethyl ether) at a temperature of 25-30°C to give FPGO Preparation of Propellant Formulation incorporating FPGO<br>
