METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING A POWER INVERTER<br>
IN ELECTRIC DRIVES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to power inverters, and<br>
more particularly relates to methods and systems for controlling power<br>
inverters in electric drive systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the complexity of the electrical systems within<br>
automobiles, particularly alternative fuel vehicles, such as hybrid, electric, and<br>
fuel cell vehicles. Such alternative fuel vehicles typically use an electric<br>
motor, perhaps in combination with another actuator, to drive the wheels.<br>
[0003] These types of vehicles can offer significant improvements in<br>
efficiency. There remains, however, an ever present need to improve the<br>
efficiency of electric motor drives to reduce power losses, improve battery<br>
life, and increase range. Additionally, it is generally desirable to reduce the<br>
noise generated from the automobile. Unfortunately, some techniques for<br>
reducing power losses in the electric motor system can increase acoustic noise<br>
emissions beyond acceptable levels.<br>
[0004] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a control method that<br>
reduces power losses and increases the efficiency of electric motors in<br>
automobiles, without excessively increasing the acoustic noise generated by<br>
the electrical motor. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics<br>
of the present imention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed<br>
description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] In one embodiment, a method for controlling a power inverter in an<br>
electric drive system of an automobile is provided. In general, the method<br>
controls the power inverter by, responsive to a commanded torque of the<br>
electric motor being below a first torque level, controlling the power inverter<br>
to set a switching frequency of the power inverter at a first set frequency; and,<br>
responsive to the commanded torque of the electric motor being between the<br>
first torque level and a second torque level, controlling the power inverter to<br>
determine the switching frequency of the power inverter as a function of the<br>
commanded torque of the electric motor while maintaining the switching<br>
frequency above a dynamic frequency limit. The method reduces switching<br>
frequencies in the inverter at high commanded torques, while maintaining the<br>
switching frequencies above dynamic frequency limit that provides effective<br>
control over the motor. This reduces power loss and thus improves the<br>
efficiency of the system.<br>
[0006] In a further embodiment, an automotive electric drive system is<br>
provided. The automotive electric drive system includes an electric motor, a<br>
power inverter coupled to the motor, and at least one processor coupled to the<br>
electric motor and the inverter. The at least one processor is configured to,<br>
responsive to a commanded torque of the electric motor being below a first<br>
torque level, provide a signal controlling the power inverter to set a switching<br>
frequency of the power inverter at a first set frequency; and, responsive to the<br>
commanded torque of the electric motor being between the first torque level<br>
and a second torque level, provide a signal controlling the power inverter to<br>
determine the switching frequency of the power inverter as a function of the<br>
commanded torque of the electric motor while maintaining the switching<br>
frequency above a dynamic frequency limit. The system reduces switching<br>
frequencies in the inverter at high commanded torques, while maintaining the<br>
switching frequencies above dynamic frequency limit that provides effective<br>
control over the motor. This reduces power loss and thus improves the<br>
efficiency of the system.<br>
 <br>

[0007]       The present invention will hereinafter be described in conjunction<br>
with the  following drawing figures, wherein  like numerals denote like<br>
elements, and<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0013] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0014] The following description refers to elements or features being<br>
"connected" or "coupled" together. As used herein, unless expressly stated<br>
otherwise, "connected" means that one element/feature is directly joined to (or<br>
directly communicates with) another element/feature, and not necessarily<br>
mechanically. Likewise, unless expressly stated otherwise, "coupled" means<br>
that one element/feature is directly or indirectly joined to (or directly or<br>
indirectly communicates with) another element/feature, and not necessarily<br>
mechanically. However, it should be understood that although two elements<br>
may be described below, in one embodiment, as being "connected," in<br>
 <br>
alternative embodiments similar elements may be "coupled," and vice versa.<br>
Thus, although the schematic diagrams shown herein depict example<br>
arrangements of elements, additional intervening elements, devices, features,<br>
or components may be present in an actual embodiment. It should also be<br>
understood that the figures are merely illustrative and may not be drawn to<br>
scale.<br>
[0015] The figures illustrate a method and a system for controlling a<br>
power inverter in an electric drive system of an automobile. In general, the<br>
system and method controls the power inverter by, responsive to a<br>
commanded torque of the electric motor being below a first torque level,<br>
controlling the power inverter to set a switching frequency of the power<br>
inverter at a first set frequency; and, responsive to the commanded torque of<br>
the electric motor being between the first torque level and a second torque<br>
level, controlling the power inverter to determine the switching frequency of<br>
the power inverter as a function of the commanded torque of the electric motor<br>
while maintaining the switching frequency above a dynamic frequency limit.<br>
The method reduces switching frequencies in the inverter at high commanded<br>
torques, while maintaining the switching frequencies above dynamic<br>
frequency limit that provides effective control over the motor. This reduces<br>
power loss and thus improves the efficiency of the system.<br>
[0016] FIG. 1 illustrates a vehicle 30, or "automobile," according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The automobile 30 includes a chassis<br>
32, a body 34, four wheels 36, and an electronic control system 38. The body<br>
34 is arranged on the chassis 32 and substantially encloses the other<br>
components of the automobile 30. The body 34 and the chassis 32 may jointly<br>
form a frame. The wheels 36 are each rotationally coupled to the chassis 32<br>
near a respective corner of the body 34.<br>
[0017] The automobile 30 may be any one of a number of different types<br>
of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport<br>
utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel<br>
drive or front-wheel drive),  four-wheel  drive (4WD) or all-wheel drive<br>
 <br>
(AWD). The vehicle 30 may also incorporate any one of, or combination of, a<br>
number of different types of engines (or actuators), such as, for example, a<br>
gasoline or diesel fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" (FFV)<br>
engine (i.e., using a mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound<br>
(e.g., hydrogen and/or natural gas) fueled engine or fuel cell energy source, a<br>
combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, and an electric motor.<br>
[0018J In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the automobile<br>
30 is a hybrid vehicle, and further includes an actuator assembly 40, a battery<br>
(or other electrical energy storage) 42, a power inverter (or inverter) 44, and a<br>
radiator 46. The actuator assembly 40 includes a combustion engine 48 and an<br>
electric motor/generator (or motor) 50. The electric motor 50 is, in one<br>
embodiment, a sinusoidally-wound alternating current (AC) motor (e.g.,<br>
permanent magnet or induction) such as commonly used in automotive<br>
vehicles (e.g., traction drive control systems, and the like). As will be<br>
appreciated by one skilled in the art, the electric motor 50 may include a<br>
transmission therein, and although not illustrated also includes a stator<br>
assembly (including conductive coils), a rotor assembly (including a<br>
ferromagnetic core), and a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant). The stator assembly<br>
and/or the rotor assembly within the electric motor 50 may include multiple<br>
(e.g., twelve) electromagnetic poles, as is commonly understood.<br>
[0019] Still referring to FIG. I, in one embodiment, the combustion engine<br>
48 and the electric motor 50 are integrated such that both are mechanically<br>
coupled to at least some of the wheels 36 through one or more drive shafts 52.<br>
The radiator 46 is connected to the frame at an outer portion thereof and<br>
although not illustrated in detail, includes multiple cooling channels<br>
therethrough that contain a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant) such as water and/or<br>
ethylene glycol (i.e., "antifreeze) and is coupled to the engine 48 and the<br>
inverter 44. Referring again to FIG. 1, in the depicted embodiment, the<br>
inverter 44 receives and shares coolant with the electric motor 50. The<br>
radiator 46 may be similarly connected to the inverter 44 and/or the electric<br>
motor 50.<br>
 <br>
[0020] The electronic control system 38 is in operable communication<br>
with the actuator assembly 40, the battery 42, and the inverter 44. Although<br>
not shown in detail, the electronic control system 38 includes various sensors<br>
and automotive control modules, or electronic control units (ECUs), such as<br>
an inverter control module and a vehicle controller, and at least one processor<br>
and/or a memory which includes instructions stored thereon (or in another<br>
computer-readable medium) for carrying out the processes and methods as<br>
described below.<br>
[0021] Referring to FIG. 2, a voltage source inverter system (or electric<br>
drive system) 54 is shown in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The voltage source inverter system 54 includes a<br>
controller 56, the inverter 44 coupled to an output of the controller 56, and the<br>
motor 50 coupled to a first output of the inverter 44. The controller 56 and<br>
may be integral with the electronic control system 38 shown in FIG. 1.<br>
[0022] FIG. 3 illustrates the inverter 44 of FIGS. 1 and 2 in greater detail.<br>
The inverter 44 includes a three-phase circuit coupled to the motor 50. More<br>
specifically, the inverter 44 includes a switch network having a first input<br>
coupled to a voltage source Vcd (e.g., the battery 42) and an output coupled to<br>
the motor 50. Although a single voltage source is shown, a distributed direct<br>
current (DC) link with two series sources may be used.<br>
[0023] The switch network comprises three pairs of series switches with<br>
antiparallel diodes (i.e., antiparallel to each switch) corresponding to each of<br>
the phases. Each of the pairs of series switches comprises a first switch (or<br>
transistor) 60, 62. and 64 having a first terminal coupled to a positive electrode<br>
of the voltage source 42 and a second switch 66, 68, and 70 having a second<br>
terminal coupled to a negative electrode of the voltage source 42 and having a<br>
first terminal coupled to a second terminal of the respective first switch 60, 62,<br>
and 64.<br>
[0024] During operation, still referring to FIG. 1, the vehicle 30 is<br>
operated by providing power to the wheels 36 with the combustion engine 48<br>
and the electric motor 50 in an alternating manner and/or with the combustion<br>
 <br>
engine 48 and the electric motor 50 simultaneously. In order to power the<br>
electric motor 50, DC power is provided from the battery 42 to the inverter 44,<br>
which converts the DC power into AC power, before the power is sent to the<br>
electric motor 50. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the<br>
conversion of DC power to AC power is substantially performed by operating<br>
(i.e., repeatedly switching) the transistors within the inverter 44 at a<br>
"switching frequency".<br>
[0025] Generally, the controller 56 produces a signal for controlling the<br>
switching action of the inverter 44. As one example, the controller 56<br>
produces a discontinuous PWM (DPWM) signal having a single zero vector<br>
associated with each switching cycle of the inverter 44. The inverter 44 then<br>
converts the PWM signal to a modulated voltage waveform for operating the<br>
motor 50. In a preferred embodiment, the controller 56 produces a PWM<br>
signal that controls the power inverter 44 to maintain the switching frequency<br>
of the power inverter 44 at a first, relatively high, set frequency responsive to a<br>
commanded torque of the electric motor 50 being below a first level. The<br>
controller 56 furthermore produces a PWM signal that controls the power<br>
inverter to provide a signal controlling the power inverter to determine the<br>
switching frequency of the power inverter as a function of the commanded<br>
torque of the electric motor while maintaining the switching frequency above<br>
a dynamic frequency limit, when the commanded torque is between the first<br>
and second levels.<br>
[0026] This configuration of the drive system ensures good control and<br>
efficient use of power in the electric motor drive system. Specifically, the<br>
switching frequency of a PWM inverter affects the power losses in<br>
semiconductor switches. Thus, lowering the switching frequency can reduce<br>
power losses. However, at higher motor speeds, a higher switching frequency<br>
is desirable to maintain an adequate pulse ratio for precise controllability of<br>
the electric motor. Additionally, it is desirable to maintain the switching<br>
frequency above levels that cause excessive noise emissions. Third, the<br>
switching frequency affects the maximum controllable stator fundamental<br>
 <br>
frequency. Fourth, the switching frequency can affect the phase ripple current,<br>
which can affect losses in both the inverter and motor. Additionally, the ripple<br>
current can cause unwanted torque ripple in the drive.<br>
[0027] The inverter switching losses can be roughly described in equation<br>
1. Specifically, equation 1 shows of switching losses Psw are proportionate to<br>
voltage Vdc, phase current IPh and switching frequency fsw.<br>
 <br>
[0028] Thus, to maintain constant switching losses the switching<br>
frequency could be adjusted to be inversely proportional to the phase current.<br>
Since the phase current is roughly proportional to the motor torque (in the<br>
unsaturated case, and below base speed), phase current can be roughly equated<br>
to motor torque. Thus, adjusting the switching frequency as a function<br>
inversely proportional to motor torque will tend to maintain constant switching<br>
losses in the semiconductor devices<br>
[0029] Furthermore, acoustic noise can be generated by the motor due to<br>
the switching frequency. In general, the human ear is most sensitive to<br>
frequencies in the range of 1 kHz to 5 kHz. Thus, to minimize acoustic noise<br>
it is desirable to operate inverter at a much higher range, for example 8 kHz.<br>
[0030] In general, the fundamental electrical frequency (fe) of an electric<br>
motor is proportional to motor speed. To control the stator currents in a stable<br>
manner, the ratio of switching frequency to fundamental electrical frequency<br>
needs to remain sufficiently high. This ratio is sometimes referred to as a<br>
pulse ratio. For example, in some typical motor controls a pulse ratio of about<br>
10:1 is needed to guarantee stable operation. Thus, it is desirable to maintain<br>
the switching frequency above a level that prevents the pulse ratio from<br>
dropping below the amount needed to guarantee stable operation.<br>
[0031] There are thus conflicting goals with respect to the switching<br>
frequency. The embodiments of the invention are configured to control the<br>
switching frequency to be at high value to reduce acoustic noise and improve<br>
 <br>
control at high speeds and low torque, and then reduce the switching<br>
frequency at high torque and current to reduce power loss and protect<br>
semiconductor switches from thermal overstress.<br>
[0032] Returning to FIGS. 1-3, the controller 56 is thus configured to<br>
produce a PWM signal that controls the power inverter 44 to maintain the<br>
switching frequency of the power inverter 44 at a first, relatively high, set<br>
frequency responsive to a commanded torque of the electric motor 50 being<br>
below a first level. The controller 56 furthermore produces a PWM signal that<br>
controls the power inverter to provide a signal controlling the power inverter<br>
to determine the switching frequency of the power inverter as a function of the<br>
commanded torque of the electric motor while maintaining the switching<br>
frequency above a dynamic frequency limit, when the commanded torque is<br>
between the first and second levels.<br>
[0033] In general, the first set frequency is set at a relatively high level<br>
that provides good control over the electric motor 50, without exceeding the<br>
frequency response of the switches in the inverter 44, or causing excessive<br>
heat due to switching losses. For example, in some embodiments the first set<br>
frequency will comprise a switching frequency of 8 kHz.<br>
[0034] At intermediate motor speeds, the inverter 44 is operated with the<br>
switching frequency that varies as a function of torque. In general, the<br>
switching frequency is reduced as commanded torque increases, and a variety<br>
of functional relationships between switching frequency and torque can be<br>
used to accomplish this. For example, the relationship between switching<br>
frequency and torque can be linear, non-linear or any combination thereof<br>
during intermediate motor speeds.<br>
[0035] As stated above, during operation of the electric motor 50 the<br>
switching frequency is varied as a function of commanded torque. However,<br>
at the same time, the operation of the inverter 44 is controlled to ensure that<br>
the switching frequency is maintained above a dynamic frequency limit. In<br>
general, the dynamic frequency limit itself varies with, and is responsive to<br>
motor speed. The dynamic frequency limit is preferably implemented to allow<br>
 <br>
a sufficient reduction in switching frequency to reduce power losses while<br>
maintaining a high enough switching frequency to maintain good current<br>
control at the motors present speed. Furthermore, the dynamic frequency limit<br>
is preferably selected to limit acoustic noise to acceptable levels.<br>
[0036] In one embodiment, the dynamic frequency limit is a function of<br>
motor speed when the electric motor is being operated at intermediate speeds,<br>
i.e., between a first speed level and a second speed level. Then, when the<br>
motor speed is below first speed level, the dynamic frequency limit is<br>
maintained at a relatively low specified, set frequency.<br>
[0037] For example, the dynamic frequency limit can be selected to<br>
maintain a specified pulse ratio during operation of the electric motor, where<br>
the pulse ratio is generally defined as a ratio of switching frequency to<br>
fundamental frequency. As the fundamental frequency is related to motor<br>
speed, configuring the dynamic limit to maintain a specified pulse ratio<br>
effectively determines the dynamic frequency limit as a function of motor<br>
speed. Maintaining a high pulse ratio assures a sufficient amount of cycles in<br>
the inverter 44 to provide accurate control over the current in the electric<br>
motor 50. Thus, the dynamic frequency limit is implemented to make sure<br>
that as motor speed increases, the frequency limit also increases to ensure that<br>
effective motor control is maintained.<br>
[0038] Additionally, the dynamic frequency limit can be set to operate at a<br>
relatively high frequency limit when the electric motor is operated at speeds<br>
above the second speed level. In one specific embodiment, this high<br>
frequency limit can be same frequency the inverter is operated at low torque<br>
levels (e.g., 8 kHz ).<br>
[0039] Turning no to FIG. 4, a graphical representation 400 of an<br>
exemplary switching frequency control scheme is illustrated. In this<br>
representation, the plot of the switching frequency as a function of the torque<br>
command is illustrated for motor speed values of 100, 200, 400, 600, 800 and<br>
800 RPM. Below a first torque value of m1 (e.g., 100 Nm), the switching<br>
frequency is held to a predetermined maximum value (e.g., 8 kHz) regardless<br>
 <br>
of motor speed. As the torque command exceeds the first value, the switching<br>
frequency is reduced inversely proportional to torque while maintaining the<br>
switching frequency above a dynamic frequency limit.<br>
[0040] The dynamic frequency limit itself varies with, and is responsive to<br>
motor speed. This causes the separate plots for each of the illustrated motor<br>
speed values. In the representation of FIG. 4, the dynamic frequency limit is a<br>
function of motor speed when the electric motor is being operated at<br>
intermediate speeds, i.e., between a first speed level and a second speed level.<br>
Then, when the motor speed is below first speed level, the dynamic frequency<br>
limit is maintained at a relatively low specified, set frequency of 1 kHz.<br>
[0041] Turning now to FIG. 5, a graphical representation 500 of an<br>
exemplar}' dynamic frequency limit scheme is illustrated. This is an example<br>
of the type of representation, that when used with function to control<br>
switching frequency as a function of torque, results in switching frequency<br>
values illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>
[0042] In the representation 500, the dynamic limit of the switching<br>
frequency is plotted as function of motor speed. At low motor speeds below<br>
speed ni (e.g., 100 RPM), the dynamic limit of the switching frequency will be<br>
held at a preset low set frequency (fsw_min_him)- This level is selected to maintain<br>
good control while avoiding excessive acoustic noise and power loss, and is<br>
set at 1 kHz in this example. Of course, this is just one example, and other<br>
limit values could also be used.<br>
[0043] At intermediate motor speeds (between n1 and n2 (e.g., 800 RPM))<br>
the switching frequency of the inverter will be determined as function of<br>
motor speed. In the illustrated embodiment, the function is configured to<br>
maintain a desired minimum pulse ratio (N) between the switching frequency<br>
(fsw) and the fundamental frequency (fe). During operation of the electric<br>
motor, the switching frequency of the inverters is operated as a function of<br>
commanded torque, reducing the switching frequency as the commanded<br>
torque is increased, while the switching frequency is maintained above<br>
dynamic frequency limit that is dependent on motor speed.   Stated another<br>
 <br>
way, motor speed determines the minimum possible switching frequency, with<br>
the torque command slewing the actual switching frequency between the<br>
maximum and the speed dependent minimum frequencies. Thus, the<br>
operational range of switching frequency fsw is illustrated in FIG. 5 as the<br>
hatched area above the dynamic frequency limit fsw_min and below the<br>
maximum set switching frequency of fsw_max- It should be noted, that above<br>
speeds of n2, the dynamic frequency limit fsw_min and the maximum frequency<br>
fsw_max converge, and thus the motor will operate at the maximum switching<br>
frequency fsw_ma above speeds of n2 regardless of torque.<br>
[0044] It should again be noted that the RPM values of n1 and n2, and the<br>
frequency values of fws_max and fsw_min lim and the slope and/or function of the<br>
dynamic frequency limit fSw_min are merely exemplary, and that other values<br>
and functions could be used depending on the details of the application.<br>
[0045] Another exemplary illustration of the techniques for determining<br>
the switching frequency are illustrated in Equation 2.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0046] In equation 2, the switching frequency is determined as a function<br>
of the commanded torque m* while being maintained above a dynamic<br>
frequency limit fsw_min- If the commanded torque is less than a torque level mi,<br>
the switching frequency is set to the maximum frequency fStt_max- If the<br>
commanded torque above a torque level w2, the switching frequency fsw is<br>
reduced down to the dynamic frequency limit fSw_min. At intermediate torque<br>
values, the switching frequency is a function of torque and the frequency<br>
limits.<br>
[0047] Also shown in the example of equation 2, the dynamic frequency<br>
limit fSw_min is itself a function of motor speed, set equal to fsw_max at speeds<br>
above n2, set equal to a minimum value fsw min_lim at speeds below n1, and<br>
determined as function of fundamental frequency fe and a desired pulse ratio N<br>
at intermediate speeds.<br>
[0048] Again, the values selected for these various parameters would be<br>
selected based on the needs of a particular application. For example, the<br>
frequency profile may be selected to minimize junction temperature swings for<br>
frequent operating points, in order to extend the lifetime of the devices. For<br>
example, mi can be selected to maintain fsw at its maximum value during a<br>
typical engine crank event, to avoid acoustic noise problems. Also, it should<br>
be noted that equation 2 illustrates just one exemplary function for adjusting<br>
switching frequencies as a function of torque (i.e., inversely proportional).<br>
However, alternate functions could also be used. Likewise, while equation 2<br>
illustrates the dynamic frequency limit fsw_min determined as a linear function<br>
of fundamental frequency fe at intermediate speeds, alternate functions could<br>
also be used.<br>
[0049] The various embodiments thus provide a system and method that<br>
controls the power inverter by, responsive to a commanded torque of the<br>
electric motor being below a first torque level, controlling the power inverter<br>
to set a switching frequency of the power inverter at a first set frequency; and,<br>
responsive to the commanded torque of the electric motor being between the<br>
first torque level and a second torque level, controlling the power inverter to<br>
 <br>
determine the switching frequency of the power inverter as a function of the<br>
commanded torque of the electric motor while maintaining the switching<br>
frequency above a dynamic frequency limit. The method reduces switching<br>
frequencies in the inverter at high commanded torques, while maintaining the<br>
switching frequencies above dynamic frequency limit that provides effective<br>
control over the motor. This reduces power loss and thus improves the<br>
efficiency of the system.<br>
