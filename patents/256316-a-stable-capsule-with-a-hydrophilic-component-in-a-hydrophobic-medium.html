Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to stable pharmaceutical compositions having an active<br>
pharmaceutical ingredient. More particularly, this invention relates to stable capsules with a<br>
hydrophilic component in a hydrophobic medium.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
Compositions in a capsule dosage form may include a fill material having one or more<br>
active agents dissolved or suspended in an appropriate liquid or paste vehicle, encapsulated in<br>
a gelatin shell, typically comprising gelatin together with a plasticizer. The fill material is<br>
typically a pumpable liquid or paste. The earner for the fill material may be a single or a<br>
multi-component system that should be compatible with the outer gelatin phase(s) of the<br>
capsule.<br>
Carrier mediums used in soft gelatin capsules fall into two general categories,<br>
hydrophilic and lipophilic. Unfortunately, hydrophilic carriers cannot be used in certain<br>
types of capsules such as when it may interact with the outer layers. Rather, in such capsules,<br>
hydrophobic or lipophilic carrier mediums need to be used. Typical examples include<br>
mineral oils (petroleum or petroleum-derived), vegetable oils {chiefly from seeds and nuts),<br>
animal oils (usually occurring as fats; the liquid types include fish oils), edible oils (chiefly<br>
vegetable oils as well as some special fish oils) arid triglycerides (preferably short chain<br>
triglycerides). In some capsules with a hydrophobic carrier medium in a core phase, it has<br>
been observed that an outer shell material may crack and/or break thereby causing<br>
unacceptable leakage of the core material.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a capsules containing hydrophilic compounds<br>
wherein the shell material does not crack or break.<br>
Summary<br>
In several embodiments of the present invention, there is provided a capsule having a<br>
hydrophobic inner layer and at least one hydrophilic outer layer. The hydrophobic layer may<br>
include a hydrophilic component such as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in a<br><br>
therapeutically effective amount. The API may be fully encapsulated, partially encapsulated<br>
or part of an adsorption complex. Such capsules experience minimal or no cracking or<br>
breaking in the at least one outer layer. Another embodiment of the present invention<br>
provides a seamless capsule having phenylephrine in a therapeutically effective amount. The<br>
phenylephrine may be fully encapsulated or partially encapsulated or adsorbed onto a<br>
complex.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a package that may include a<br>
dispenser or blister package and a seamless capsule. A seamless capsule may include a<br>
hydrophobic inner layer and at least one hydrophilic outer layer. The hydrophobic layer may<br>
include a hydrophilic ingredient such as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in a<br>
therapeutically effective amount. The API may be partially encapsulated, fully encapsulated<br>
or is part of an adsorption complex. The package may contain drug facts attached thereto.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides for a method of stabilizing a<br>
seamless capsule having a hydrophilic API in a hydrophobic inner layer. In one embodiment,<br>
there is provided a method of preventing or minimizing migration of a hydrophilic ingredient<br>
such as an API from a hydrophobic inner layer of a seamless capsule to an outer hydrophilic<br>
layer of a capsule by including the steps of providing an API in a therapeutically effective<br>
amount that is encapsulated, partially encapsulated or adsorbed and incorporating the API<br>
into the hydrophobic inner layer of a seamless capsule.<br>
In various embodiments, there is provided a capsule including a hydrophobic inner<br>
layer and at least one hydrophilic outer layer. The hydrophobic inner layer may include a<br>
hydrophilic component. The hydrophilic component experiences no or minimal migration to<br>
the outer hydrophilic outer layer. The hydrophilic component may be an active<br>
pharmaceutical ingredient which may be present in a therapeutically effective amount.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a capsule having an<br>
encapsulated or partially encapsulated hydrophilic compound(s) in a hydrophobic carrier in<br>
an inner layer. Such capsules do not experience cracks or breaks in surrounding outer<br>
layer(s) that may have a hydrophilic carrier or phase. In another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, there is provided a seamless microcapsule with encapsulated or partially<br>
encapsulated hydrophilic APIs positioned in a hydrophobic earner in an inner layer or phase<br>
and wherein the outer shell of the microcapsule does not experience breakage or cracking.<br>
In several embodiments of the present invention, one useful capsule is a seamless<br>
capsule. Such seamless capsules typically include at least one inner layer, defined as the<br>
'core layer' and at lease one outer layer, defined as a shell layer.<br>
The terms microcapsule and minicapsule are synonymous with each other and used<br>
interchangeably throughout this specification.<br>
Capsules may be formulated to disintegrate and/or dissolve directly in the buccal<br>
cavity or in the GI tract or stomach area. In various embodiments, one useful capsule<br>
includes a fast disintegrating capsule that disintegrates in the buccal cavity. In several<br>
embodiments of the present invention, a fast disintegrating capsule may be designed to<br>
disintegrate in the buccal cavity from about 1 second to about 60 seconds or from about 1<br>
second to about 45 seconds or from about 1 second to about 30 seconds or from about 1<br>
second to about 15 seconds. In one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
seamless capsule that disintegrates in the buccal cavity between about 1 second and 30<br>
seconds. In several embodiments, the capsule will disintegrate in the buccal cavity without<br>
any external forces such as biting on the capsule.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides for a fast disintegrating capsule<br>
with a single inner hydrophobic core layer and a single hydrophilic outer layer, wherein the<br>
capsule is stable and docs not experience any cracking or breaking in the outer layer. This<br>
type of capsule may be advantageous for several reasons. Depending on the materials<br>
utilized in the capsule, a capsule having multiple hydrophilic or water soluble outer layers<br><br>
may effect the desired disintegration performance of the capsule. For instance, a capsule with<br>
a hydrophobic core layer and two or more outer water soluble layers may not disintegrate as<br>
quickly as a capsule that has a single core layer and a single outer water soluble layer.<br>
Additionally, having a single core hydrophobic layer and a single outer water soluble layer<br>
may be advantageous from a manufacturing efficiency point of view.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figure 1, wherein a multilayered<br>
capsule includes an inner core layer and an outer shell layer. Other embodiments of the<br>
present invention include capsules with more layers such as an additional layer between the<br>
core and shell layer and/or an additional layer on the outside of the outer shell layer. Several<br>
embodiments of the present invention provide for a capsule that has 2, 3, 4, 5 phases or<br>
layers. The thickness of each layer may be adjusted by varying the ratio of the various<br>
solutions. Suitable enteric agents include pectin, alginic acid, cellulose such as carboxyl<br>
methylcellulose, celluloseacetate phthalate, and the like, Eudragit® which is one of an acrylic<br>
copolymer and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
In various embodiments of the present invention, an API that resides in an inner core<br>
layer may be encapsulated or partially encapsulated by an appropriate means. Encapsulation<br>
of drugs is known to'be useful for providing sustained release versions of certain APIs.<br>
While it may be desirable in certain circumstances to provide for a sustained release product<br>
so that API is released into the patient over an extended period of time, it would not be<br>
desirable to encapsulate a drug if an immediate release product is desired. In vanous<br>
embodiments of the present invention, there are provided capsules, such as seamless capsules<br>
that are designed to disintegrate in the buccal cavity. It has surprisingly been found that<br>
stable capsules can be provided by encapsulating or partially encapsulating the API contained<br>
therein.<br>
Partially encapsulating an API is advantageous since it minimizes or eliminates the<br>
outer shell cracking issue while not creating an undesirable sustained release API. Another<br>
embodiment of the present invention also provides for a seamless capsule containing an<br>
encapsulated API wherein the encapsulated API is available for immediate release in the<br>
patient. In such embodiments, the encapsulation is in an effective amount to minimize or<br>
eliminate migration of the API to the outer shell. Alternatively, the encapsulation is in an<br>
effective amount to minimize or eliminate the deformations in the outer shell such as cracks,<br><br>
breaks and the like and combinations thereof. An API may be partially encapsulated, fully<br>
encapsulated, partial adsorbates, full -adsorbates or combinations thereof.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that hydrophilic<br>
compounds, sucli as hydrophilic active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), tend to migrate<br>
from an inner layer or core phase which has a hydrophobic carrier medium to an hydrophilic<br>
phase located outside of the core or inner hydrophobic layer. In several embodiments, the<br>
hydrophilic phase or layer is an outer shell layer or a middle shell layer residing outside of<br>
the core hydrophilic phase or layer. While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory,<br>
it is believed that a partially or fully encapsulated or adsorbing an hydrophilic API reduces,<br>
minimizes or eliminates the API's affinity to migrate to an outer layer or phase, thereby<br>
reducing or eliminating the migration of the API to the outer shell and thereby reducing or<br>
eliminating the cracking or breaking of the outer shell.<br>
Several embodiments of the invention contemplate that APIs can be encapsulated,<br>
partially encapsulated, adsorbed as a complex or partially adsorbed as a complex.<br>
Encapsulation can be achieved using conventional procedures and can be performed using<br>
water-insoluble as well as water soluble agents. Alternatively, it is possible to encapsulate a<br>
release controlling substance, together with an API, within an encapsulating shell to provide<br>
for controlled release of a taste-masked capsule.<br>
for instance, an API may be encapsulated or partially encapsulated by first<br>
granulating the API with a sufficient quantity of the desired encapsulation material. The wet<br>
mass is passed through a mesh screen such as a 10 mesh screen to break up any lumps, if<br>
necessary. The granules are dried over a forced air oven at 50 °C. The dried powder is<br>
passed through a screen, such as a 40 mesh screen. The powder is then ready to be<br>
incorporated into the core inner solution.<br>
Suitable materials that can be used to encapsulate or partially encapsulate an API<br>
include, but are not limited to, hydroxypropylcellulose, ethycellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcclIulosc(Aquacoat®), ethylcellulose, methacrylates, acrylic co-<br>
polymers such as Eudragit® (Butylmethacrylat-(2-Dimethylaminoethyl)methacrylat-<br>
Methylmethacrylat-Copolymer (1:2:1)"), KOLLICOAT® , polyvinylpyrrolidone and<br>
combinations thereof. The pharmaceutical composition can include other functional<br>
components presented for the purpose of modifying the physical, chemical or taste properties<br>
of the systemically active therapeutic agent. For example, the API can be in the form of a<br><br>
microencapsulation, ion-exchange resin complex, such as a sulfonated polymers, electro-<br>
chemical melt, supercritical fluids, magnesium trisilicate, coacervation, or cyclodextrin<br>
(cyclic-linked oligosaccharides) complexes. Useful sulphonated polymers include<br>
polystyrene cross-linked with 8% of divinylbenzene such as Amberlite ®IRP-69 and IRP-64<br>
(obtained by Rohm and Haas), Dow XYS-40010.00®, Dow XYS40013.00® (obtained from<br>
the Dow Chemical Company).<br>
Various embodiments of the present invention provide for an outer layer that includes<br>
a water soluble layer. Useful materials for a water soluble outer, coating or shell layer<br>
include, but are not limited to, gelatins, proteins, polysaccharides, starches, celluloses and<br>
combinations thereof Useful materials for the water soluble outer coating or shell layers<br>
include but are not limited to, albumin, pectin, guar gum, carboxyrnethyl starches,<br>
carboxymethyl celluloses, carrageenan, agar and the like, hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
ethycellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, such as Aquacoat®, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, pullulan and combinations thereof. When the material for forming the<br>
coating layer contains protein or polysaccharide, useful amounts include an amount from<br>
about 100 parts by weight to about one part by weight. Other useful materials in the outer,<br>
coating or shell layer include an enteric material, a plasticizer, a preservative and a colorant<br>
and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
To adjust the hardness of the shell, a material that increases the hardness of the shell<br>
material after hardening, such as sorbitol, can be added to the shell material along with the<br>
plasticizer. Furthermore, by adding a thickening polysaccharide, a gelling agent, a proteolytic<br>
agent or the like, it is possible to improve the long-term stability of the shell. The shell<br>
material can be colored to any arbitrary color tone by a pigment, and flavorings, sweeteners,<br>
souring agents or the like can be added. Sorbitol, thickening polysaccharides, gelling agents,<br>
proteolytic agents and the like are added at 10% by mass or less with respect to the total<br>
amount of the shell material, and preferably at 5% by mass or less.<br>
Other useful materials in the water soluble phase include plasticizers, which include<br>
polyhydric alcohols, such as sorbitol, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and the like and<br>
combinations therof. A water-soluble polyvalent alcohol or water-soluble derivative thereof<br>
may also be used in water soluble outer or coating layer. Useful examples of polyvalent<br>
alcohol or water soluble derivatives thereof include but are not limited to, glycerin,<br><br>
polyglycerin, sorbitol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, polypropylene<br>
glycol, ethylene oxide-propyiene oxide copolymer, oligosaccharide, sugar esfer, glycende,<br>
sorbitan ester and the like. Useful preservatives and colorants include benzoic acid, para-<br>
oxybenzoate, caramel colorant, gardenia colorant, carotene colorant, tar colorant and the like<br>
and combinations thereof.<br>
A film substance may be used on the water soluble outer or shell layer and may be<br>
formed by treating a capsule with a film forming substance. Suitable film formers include<br>
but are not limited to albumin, pectin, guar gum, carrageenan, agar and the like,<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, ethyccllulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, such as Aquacoat®,<br>
pullulan and combinations thereof.<br>
Useful amounts of additives include 2 parts by weight to 98 parts by weight, based on<br>
100 parts by weight of gelatin in the coating layer. In order to inhibit oxygen-permeability of<br>
the capsule of the present invention, sucrose may be contained in the coating layer, in<br>
addition to the film-forming material and additives. When sucrose is not contained in the<br>
coating layer, oxygen may permeate through the water-soluble gel layer to reach the content<br>
and oxidize the unsaturated fatty acid and derivative thereof during a long storage period of<br>
time. Oxidized unsaturated fatty acid and derivative thereof increase peroxide value (POV)<br>
and deteriorate product quality. Sucrose efficiently inhibits the disadvantage. Sucrose maybe<br>
contained in an amount of one part by weight to 100 parts by weight based on 100 parts by<br>
weight of gelatin.<br>
A water-soluble layer or phase may also contain an acid or an acid salt thereof, to<br>
minimize or prevent the capsule from insolubilizmg. Useful acids or acid salt thereof include<br>
a water-soluble organic acid, an inorganic acid, or an acid salt thereof (for example, sodium<br>
salt). Suitable organic acid include acids having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, including, for example,<br>
citric acid, malic acid, tartar acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, butyric acid, succinic acid and the<br>
like, an acid salt thereof (for example, sodium malate, potassium succinate, calcium citrate<br>
and the like); and combinations thereof. Useful inorganic acids include phosphoric acid,<br>
polyphosphoric acid, carbonic acid, an acid salt thereof (for example, dibasic sodium<br>
phosphate) and combinations thereof. Useful amounts of an acid or acid salt thereof to a<br>
water-soluble layer is generally from about 0.01 to about 50% by weight, or from about 0. 05<br>
to about 20% by weight, based on 100% by weight of a water soluble layer or phase.<br><br>
The inner or core solution or phase of a capsule may include a fatty acid such as a<br>
unsaturated fatty acid or a derivative thereof. Suitable materials for the inner core include but<br>
are not limited to, vegetable fats and oils, animal fats and oils and mineral oils and<br>
combinations thereof. Suitable materials for the inner core include fish oils and a purified<br>
malerial thereof, liver oils, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA),<br>
arachidonic acid, prostaglandin and a derivative thereof, sucrose fatty acid ester, propylene<br>
glycol fatty acid ester, glycerin fatty acid ester, long chain fatty acid triglyceride, medium<br>
chain fatty acid triglyceride, ampho-ionic emulsifiers, lecithin, sesame oil, coffee oil,<br>
rapeseed oil, brown rice oil, liquid paraffin and combinations thereof.<br>
To prepare an emulsified core liquid, well-known conventional methods can be used<br>
in which the main component, including an emulsifying agent, and an oil component are<br>
emulsified using a homogenizer to obtain an oil-in-water emulsion. Other useful materials<br>
for the core or inner phase include, but are not limited to, various types of a stabilizers for<br>
unsaturated fatty acid or a derivative thereof including antioxidants, such as vitamin E,<br>
vitamin C, fi- carotene, eucalyptol, menthol, flavorings, sweeteners, wheat germ oil and the<br>
like and combinations thereof.<br>
The core filler material can be in a liquid state when extruded from the multiple<br>
nozzle as the core liquid, and the core liquid can remain a liquid after the formation of the<br>
multilayer liquid drops, or alternatively can be a gel or solid after formation of the seamless<br>
capsule. The core material may include a foodstuff, health food, flavoring, condiments,<br>
pharmaceutical, aromatic agent, or the like, it is possible to include various additives such as<br>
solvents (for example, edible oils), sweeteners, souring agents, flavorings, colorings,<br>
thickeners (gelatinizing agents), stabilizers, and emulsifiers, or the like that are permitted in<br>
terms of food production or pharmacology. When the core material is prepared in a liquid<br>
state, it can take the form of a transparent solution, suspension, or a latex (cream) where the<br>
main component is dissolved in a solvent. The method in which a core liquid filler material is<br>
prepared can be any well-known method in the fields of food production or pharmaceutical<br>
manufacturing. For example, to prepare a transparent core liquid, the main component and<br>
additives are measured and mixed with a solvent such as a edible oil, and as needed heated<br>
and agitated to produce a uniform solution.<br>
Useful amounts of the inner or core phase is from about 10% to 95% by weight, or<br>
from about 40% to about 90% by weight, based on the total weight of the capsule.<br><br>
In several embodiments of the present invention, the seamless capsule may contain a<br>
viscous liquid "which- is scarcely misciblc with water between an outer film and the inner or<br>
core phase. The viscous liquid which is scarcely miscible with water may be liquid having a<br>
viscosity of not more than 1000 cp at 100C. Examples thereof include emulsifiers, oils, resins<br>
and the like and they may be used alone or in combination thereof. Examples of the<br>
emulsifier include nonionic emulsifiers having HLB value of 2 to 8 such as sucrose fatty acid<br>
ester, propylene glycol fatty acid ester, glycerin fatty acid ester (e.g. long chain fatty acid<br>
triglyceride, medium chain fatty acid triglyceride, such as NeoBee®, etc.), ampho-ionic<br>
emulsifiers such as lecithin or a mixture thereof. Examples of oils include vegetable fats and<br>
oils, animal fats and oils and mineral oil of which solubility in 100 g of absolute alcohol at<br>
150C is not more than 50 g, for example, sesame oil, coffee oil, rapeseed oil, brown rice oil.<br>
liquid paraffin and combinations thereof. Further, dl-alpha-tocopherol, isobutylene polymers<br>
(e.g. polybutylene, polybutene, etc.), resins (e.g. silicone resin, vinyl acetate resin, etc.),<br>
silicon dioxide, such as Cab-o-sil®; and the like can be used. The viscous liquid maybe<br>
present between the content and film in the case of producing the capsule. However, it is not<br>
necessarily required that the viscous liquid is present between the content and film, and it<br>
may be present in the content in the separate state.<br>
The inner or outer layer may include other materials including APIs, foods, cosmetics,<br>
flavors, industrial chemicals and the like.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides for a seamless microcapsule<br>
with three layers, namely, the core layer, a middle layer and an outer shell layer. The middle<br>
layer may be added to the microcapsule by a third injection nozzle. The middle layer may<br>
provide for a more stable microcapsule. More particularly, the middle layer may provide for<br>
additional protection for the shell layer and prevent or minimize migration of the core layer to<br>
the outer shell layer.<br>

The amount of the API's in the formulation may be adjusted to deliver a<br>
predetermined dose of the active agent over a predetermined period of time, which may<br>
typically vary from 4 to 24 hours. Examples of doses containing specific pharmaceutically<br>
active agents are set forth in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Except as otherwise noted, the amount of API is designated as % by weight per<br>
dosage form. Generally, the amount of the API used may be from about 0.01% to about 80%<br>
by weight, or from about 0.1% to about 40% by weight, or from about 1% to about 30% by<br>
weight, or from about 1% to about 10% by weight.<br>
An "effective" amount or a "therapeutically effective amount" of an active ingredient<br>
refers to a non-toxic but sufficient amount of the agent to provide the desired effect. The<br>
amount of active agent that is "effective" will vary from subject to subject, depending on the<br><br>
age and general condition of the individual, the particular active agent or agents, and the like.<br>
Thus, it is not always possible to specify an exact "effective amount." However, an<br>
appropriate "effective" amount in any individual case can be determined by one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art using routine experimentation.<br>
"Pharmacologically active"' (or simply "active"), refers to a compound that has<br>
pharmacological activity and a "pharmacologically active" derivative of an active agent,<br>
refers to a derivative having the same type of pharmacological activity as the parent<br>
compound and approximately equal in degree. When the term "pharmaceutically acceptable"<br>
is used to refer to a derivative (e.g., a salt) of an active agent, it is to be understood that the<br>
compound is pharmacologically active as well. When the term "pharmaceutically acceptable"<br>
is used to refer to an excipient, it implies that the excipient has met the required standards of<br>
toxicological and manufacturing testing or that it is on the Inactive Ingredient Guide prepared<br>
by the Food and Drug Administration.<br>
By "pharmaceutically acceptable" such as in the recitation of a "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient," or a "pharmaceutically acceptable additive," is meant a material that is<br>
not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the material can be incorporated into a<br>
pharmaceutical composition administered to a patient without causing any undesirable<br>
biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of<br>
the composition in which it is contained.<br>
In various embodiments of the present invention, the dosage forms may be<br>
administered orally. Oral administration may involve swallowing, so that the composition<br>
with the API(s) enters the gastrointestinal tract, and/or buccal, lingual, or sublingual<br>
administration by which the API enters the blood stream directly from the mouth.<br>
Useful inactive ingredients that may be included in the various phases or solutions of<br>
the capsule, may include but are not limited to, binding agents, filling agents, lubricating<br>
agents, suspending agents, sweeteners, flavorings and flavor enhancer agents, taste-masking<br>
agents, preservatives, buffers, wetting agents, anti-oxidants, colorants or coloring agents,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, disintegrants, salivary stimulating agents, cooling<br>
agents, co-solvents (including oils), pH adjusting agents, effervescent agents, emollients,<br>
bulking agents, anti-foaming agents, surfactants, soluble organic salts, permeabilizing agents,<br>
glidants and other excipients and combinations thereof. Desirably, the agents are chemically<br>
and physically compatible with the API.<br><br>
Examples of useful substantially water soluble earners or filling agents include, but<br>
are not limited to, various starches, celluloses, carbohydrates compression sugars or soluble<br>
fillers. More particularly, useful fillers include but are not limited to lactose, lactose<br>
monohydrate, lactose anhydrous, sucrose, amylose, dextrose, mannitol, inositol, maltose,<br>
maltilol, sorbitol, glucose, xylitol. erythritol, fructose, maltodextrins; microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, calcium carboxy methyl cellulose; pregelatinized starch, modified starches, potato<br>
starch, maize starch; clays, including kaolin and polyethylene glycols (PEG) including PEG<br>
4000; or combinations thereof. Useful amount of fillers include the range of about 1 to about<br>
99 weight percent, or about 25 to about 95 weight percent or about 40 weight percent to about<br>
95 weight percent of the compositions of this invention.<br>
Compositions of the present invention may include a sweetener. Useful sweeteners-<br>
include, but are not limited to, sugars such as sucrose, glucose (corn syrup), dextrose, invert<br>
sugar, fructose, and mixtures thereof; acid saccharin and its various salts such as the sodium<br>
or calcium salt; cyclamic acid and its various salts such as the sodium salt; the dipeptide<br>
sweeteners such as aspartame and alitamc; natural sweeteners such as dihydrochakone<br>
compounds; glycyrrhizin; Stevia rebaudiana (Stevioside); sugar alcohols such as sorbitol,<br>
sorbitol syrup, mannitol, xylitol and the like, synthetic sweeteners such as acesulfame-K and<br>
sodium and calcium salts thereof and other synthetic sweeteners,, hydrogenated starch<br>
hydrolysate (lycasin); protein based sweetening agents such as talin (thaumaoccous danielli)<br>
and/or any other pharmacologically acceptable sweetener known by the stale of the art, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable sugar alcohols useful as sweeteners include, but are not limited to, sorbitol,<br>
xylitol, mannitol, galactitol, maltitol, isornalt (PALATINIT™) and mixtures thereof. The<br>
exact amount of sugar alcohol employed is a matter of preference subject to such factors as<br>
the degree of cooling effect desired. Thus, the amount of sugar alcohol may be varied in order<br>
to obtain the result desired in the final product and such variations are within the capabilities<br>
of those skilled in the art without the need for undue experimentation.<br>
in another embodiment, a capsule is free of sugar. A sugar-free formulation has the<br>
advantage that it can be administered easily to consumers with blood sugar disorders or to<br>
diabetics in need of such preparations. Such sweeteners include, but are not limited to,<br>
sucralose, acesulfame potassium, and aspartame which share properties such as absence of<br>
bitter and metallic aftertastes.<br><br>
In another embodiment, a capsule may include acesulfame K, aspartame, sucralosc<br>
and combinations thereof. Acesulfame K is a commercial product of Nutrinova Nutrition<br>
Specialties &amp; Food Ingredient GmbH. Useful amounts of sucralose in a dosage form is<br>
between about 0.002% to about 10% by total weight of the FDDF. However, this amount can<br>
vary greatly depending upon the nature of the composition being sweetened. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the sweetener is a mixture of sucralose with acesulfame K.<br>
One embodiment of the invention provides for a controlled or extended release<br>
composition.<br>
Optionally, one or more flavors such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 6,596,298<br>
which is incorporated herein. Any amount of flavor can be used and will depend on<br>
characteristics of the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s); preferred concentration of flavoring<br>
is between about 0.01% to about 10% w/w of a composition.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a kit having two or more<br>
separate compositions having an API in capsules, including seamless capsules, and a means<br>
for separately retaining said capsules, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil<br>
packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of<br>
capsules and the like. Other embodiments contemplate articles of manufacture including<br>
various packaging configurations, ranging from unit dose blister packs to multiple dose<br>
packages such as bottles. To assist compliance, the kit may have directions for administration<br>
and may be provided with a so-called memory aid.<br>
In one embodiment, capsules are provided in blister packaging which is believed to<br>
limit the amount of oxygen that may interact with the capsule and as such may also increase<br>
or enhance the stability of the drug product containing the API. Another embodiment<br>
contemplates a method of dispensing a capsule from a blister pack by forcing the drug<br>
product through a foil back on a blister pack.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a method for producing the<br>
encapsulated unsaturated fatty acid substance may be a conventional method for producing a<br>
soft capsule. An example of the method for producing the capsule includes a method<br>
containing steps of preparing a sheet for the coating layer mainly containing gelatin and a<br>
sheet for the water-soluble gel layer containing an acid or an acid salt thereof, respectively,<br>
laminating both sheets, drying to obtain a dried sheet and encapsulating unsaturated fatty acid<br>
or the derivative thereof as the content with the dried sheet on a rotary filler to form a seamed<br><br>
capsule; and another method for producing a seamless capsule by using an instrument<br>
equipped with some nozzles arranged concentrically.<br>
Seamless microcapsules may be manufactured by any acceptable machinery such as<br>
the seamless minicapsulc production machine, such as the Spherex, manufactured by Freund<br>
Corp., Japan as shown in Figure 2. Highly spherical uniform, seamless capsules may be<br>
produced by such machinery. A useful manufacturing process for seamless capsules,<br>
including seamless microcapsules, includes mixing the components of the core in one<br>
container and the components of the shell(s) in another container. The shell(s) materials are<br>
heated to provide a fluid medium. The core and shell(s) materials are then pumped separately<br>
to at least two fluid nozzles submerged in an organic carrier medium. The capsules formed<br>
are allowed to cooled and stiffen. They are then denatured and separated for further<br>
handling. Additional solutions may be injected to form a three or more system<br>
microcapsule. The core solution and the shell solution must be different. The principle of<br>
seamless mini capsule formulation is the utilization of surface tension. In particular, when<br>
two different solutions contact each other, surface tension works to reduce the contact area of<br>
the solution resulting in a spherical shape.<br>
Suitable methods for producing seamless capsules are disclosed in US5,330,835 and<br>
US 6,531,150, US2004/0051192, US5,478,508 which are incorporated herein in their<br>
entirety.<br>
FIG. I schematically shows a cross-sectional view of a capsule ( 20 ), with an inner<br>
core material ( 21 ) with a coating layer ( 23 ). FIG. 2 schematically shows a cross-sectional<br>
view of a capsule ( 15 ), with an inner core material ( 11 ), a coating layer ( 10 ) and a film<br>
layer (14).<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic cross section illustrating one embodiment of the present<br>
invention which is suitable for producing a seamless capsule. The inner core material ( 4 ) of<br>
the capsule supplied to the nozzles is extruded from an annular end of an inner nozzle (called<br>
the first nozzle) (1 ), the material for forming the water-soluble gel layer ( 5 ) is extruded<br>
from an annular end of an intermediate nozzle (called the second nozzle) ( 2 ) and optionally<br>
a film-forming materia] for a coating layer ( 6 ) is extruded from an annular end of an outer<br>
nozzle (called the third nozzle) ( 3 ), simultaneously, to make a three-phase composite jet<br>
stream, followed by releasing the jet stream into a cooling solution ( 8 ) to obtain the<br><br>
encapsulated unsaturated fatty acid substance ( 7 ) of the present invention in a form of the<br>
seamless-capsule<br>
In the method of the present invention, since all of the loading materials are liquid, the<br>
encapsulation process can be easily performed by adequately vibrating the jet stream with a<br>
vibration means to readily release the jet stream, and thereby a particle size of the resulting<br>
capsules may be controlled uniformly.<br>
The encapsulated unsaturated fatty acid substance ( 7 ) produced by the method of the<br>
present invention may be used in any way of an undried form remaining moisture in the<br>
coating layer, or a dried form.<br>
The capsule of the present invention may be formed into a desirable particle size of<br>
0.1 mm to 20 mm, preferably 0.3 to 8 mm. The water-soluble outer layer ( 12 ) may have a<br>
thickness from about 0.001 to about 5.00 mm, or from about 0.01 to 1 mm.<br>
EXAMPLES<br><br>
The formulations in Table 2 are mixed to prepare the respective layers. The materials<br>
are extruded through each one of a double and triple nozzle, respectively, arranged<br><br>
concentrically and released into a cooling solulion (vegetable oil) to produce capsules in form<br>
of a double and triple structure, respectively. The resulting capsules are spherical and about 8<br>
mm in diameter.<br><br>
The API, phenylephrine, is partially encapsulated by granulating phenylephrine with<br>
the encapsulating materials listed in Table 3. The wet granulation mass is passed through a<br>
10 mesh screen. The granules are dried over a forced air oven at 50 °C. The dried powder is<br>
passed through a 40 mesh screen and the powder is then mixed into the core solution.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific<br>
examples thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and<br>
modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof of the<br>
invention.<br><br>
The applicant confirms that the biological material used in the process of this invention is not procured from India, and has rather been procured from country outside India. <br><br><br><br>
