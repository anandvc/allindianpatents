				<td>A METHOD AND NOISE SUPPRESSION CIRCUIT INCORPORATING A<br>
PLURALITY OF NOISE SUPPRESSION TECHNIQUES<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority from a US Provisional Patent Application<br>
Serial No. 60/882,926, filed December 30, 2006.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a noise suppression circuitry and<br>
corresponding methods, and more particularly, to a method and noise suppression<br>
circuit incorporating multiple noise suppression techniques including a detector for<br>
detecting multiple types of noise and multiple corresponding techniques for removing<br>
the detected noise.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The presence of ambient or background noise can have a significant effect on<br>
the quality of audio experienced by one or both of the participants of a call, especially<br>
if one or both of the participants are in a noisy environment. With respect to audio<br>
quality, voice clarity and intelligibility are generally more prominent concerns.<br>
However, when speaking in a noisy environment, filtering out ambient noise that can<br>
sometimes be picked up by a microphone in addition to the user's voice can often<br>
times present many challenges. This can be especially true where the ambient noise<br>
might consist of many people talking in the background, often referred to as babble<br>
noise. This is because the background voices have characteristics that are similar to<br>
the desired speech signals being produced by the user, and therefore can be more<br>
difficult to distinguish and detect.<br>
While historically, people have sometimes sought a quiet environment to talk<br>
on the phone, which attempted to mitigate the problems of any background noises by<br>
avoiding them altogether, a quiet environment such as a phone booth is not always<br>
conveniently available, and the need for a quiet environment can sometimes<br>
negatively impact the mobility and convenience associated with using a mobile<br><br>
telephone and/or a phone coupled to a landline in an environment that is only<br>
sometimes noisy.<br>
More recently, attempts to reduce background noise and improve speech-to-<br>
noise ratios have largely focused on ambient noise that is fairly stationary, and/or is<br>
noise associated with known sources, such as engine noise from a car. Some of these<br>
approaches have attempted to focus on the time periods during which a person's voice<br>
is detected as not being currently present, and attempting to mitigate noise during<br>
these periods. However, attempts to address non-stationary types of noise, such as<br>
babble noise has proved to be more problematic. Many of the more recent attempts<br>
have attempted to apply techniques based upon a more instantaneous acoustic<br>
analysis, which apply relatively static models, which arc generally not effective for<br>
less stationary type noises. Furthermore, the techniques associated with addressing<br>
instances in which the intended speech is not present, are not very effective in<br>
removing noise, which is overlapped with the intended speech.<br>
Consequently, the present inventors have recognized that it would be desirable<br>
to be able to distinguish between different types of noise from the intended speech,<br>
such as babble noise and/or stationary noise, and be able to implement techniques<br>
selectively applied and specifically tailored to address each type of noise, when the<br>
same is detected as being present, while at the same time avoiding and/or mitigating<br>
the effects of any unpleasant audible artifacts.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a noise suppression circuit for use in an audio<br>
signal processing circuit. The noise suppression circuit includes a plurality of<br>
different types of noise activity detectors, which are each adapted for detecting the<br>
presence of a different type of noise in a received signal. The noise suppression<br>
circuit further includes a plurality of different types of noise reduction circuits, which<br>
are each adapted for removing a different type of detected noise, where each noise<br>
reduction circuit respectively corresponds to one of the plurality of noise activity<br>
detectors. The respective noise reduction circuit is then selectively activated to<br>
condition the received signal to reduce the amount of the detected types of noise,<br><br>
when each one of the plurality of noise activity detectors detects the presence of a<br>
corresponding type of noise in the received signal.<br>
In at least one embodiment, the plurality of different types of noise activity<br>
detectors include a babble noise activity detector and a stationary noise activity<br>
detector.<br>
The present invention further provides a two way communication device,<br>
which includes a transceiver for communicating with a remote radio source, a speaker<br>
for reproducing an audio signal received from a remote radio source, a microphone<br>
for detecting an audio signal to be transmitted to the remote radio source, and an<br>
audio signal processing circuit including a noise suppression circuit for conditioning<br>
the audio signal detected by the microphone prior to being transmitted to the remote<br>
radio source by the transceiver. The noise suppression circuit includes a plurality of<br>
different types of noise activity detectors, which are each adapted for detecting the<br>
presence of a different type of noise in a received signal. The noise suppression<br>
circuit further includes a plurality of different types of noise reduction circuits, which<br>
are each adapted for removing a different type of detected noise, where each noise<br>
reduction circuit respectively corresponds to one of the plurality of noise activity<br>
detectors. The respective noise reduction circuit is then selectively activated to<br>
condition the received signal to reduce the amount of the detected types of noise,<br>
when each one of the plurality of noise activity detectors detects the presence of a<br>
corresponding type of noise in the received signal.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for suppressing noise in an<br>
audio signal. The method includes detecting with a plurality of different types of<br>
noise activity detectors the presence of a plurality of different types of noise in the<br>
audio signal, each different type of noise activity detector being adapted to detect a<br>
different type of noise. The detected type of noise in the audio signal is then<br>
suppressed using one of a plurality of different types of noise reduction circuits each<br>
adapted for removing a different type of detected noise, where each noise reduction<br>
circuit respectively corresponds to one of the plurality of noise activity detectors,<br>
when the respective detector detects the presence of the corresponding type of noise<br>
by selectively activating the respective noise reduction circuit.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms,<br>
there is shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described presently preferred<br>
embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an<br>
exemplification of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the<br>
specific embodiments illustrated.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary audio signal processing<br>
circuit 100. The audio signal processing circuit 100 includes a first path directed to<br>
receiving an incoming audio data stream 102 and reproducing the corresponding<br>
audio signal at a speaker 104, and a second path directed to receiving an audio signal<br>
at a microphone 106 and converting the audio signal received at the microphone 106<br>
into an outgoing audio data stream 108.<br><br>
The first path includes a speech decoder circuit 110, which receives the<br>
incoming audio data stream 102 which can be encoded as data packets suitable for<br>
transmission via a wireless radio frequency communication interface, and recombines<br>
the received data packets and converts the same into digital speech data. The digital<br>
speech data, is then received by a speech enhancement circuit 112, which performs<br>
any necessary error correction or data enhancement in the audio data as a result of<br>
errors during the data transmission and/or any missing data packets. The enhanced or<br>
corrected data stream is then converted from a digital signal to an analog signal via a<br>
digital to analog converter 114 and conveyed to a speaker 104 for reproduction of the<br>
audio signal to be heard by the user.<br>
The second path includes the microphone 106, which detects an audio signal<br>
including any voice signals being produced by the user, as well as any background<br>
noise. The detected audio signal is then converted by an analog to digital converter<br>
116 from an analog audio signal produced by the microphone 106 to a digitally<br>
encoded audio signal. The digitally encoded audio signal is then received by a noise<br>
removal circuit 118, which attempts to detect the presence of noise and attempts to<br>
remove the same.<br>
As part of detecting the presence of noise and attempts to remove the same, in<br>
at least some instances, an echo cancellation circuit 120 coupled to the output of the<br>
speech enhancement circuit 112 of the first path provides to the noise removal circuit<br>
118 a representation of the audio signal being conveyed to the speaker 104 to be<br>
produced as an audio signal. This in turn enables the noise removal circuit 118 to<br>
recognize any audio signal produced at the speaker 104, which may have been<br>
subsequently detected by the microphone 106, and which has then been incorporated<br>
into the audio signal detected by the microphone 106. The received representation<br>
from the echo cancellation circuit 120 can then be used to remove the same from the<br>
audio signal detected by the microphone 106.<br>
The resulting audio signal with noise removed, which is produced by the noise<br>
removal circuit 118, is then coupled to a speech encoder circuit 122, which takes the<br>
audio signal received from the noise removal circuit 118 and encodes the audio signal<br><br>
into data packets forming an outgoing audio signal, which is suitable for transmission<br>
via a wireless radio frequency communication interface.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of a noise removal circuit 200, associated<br>
with at least one exemplary prior technique. The noise removal circuit 200 includes a<br>
spectrum analysis circuit 202, which analyzes the various spectral characteristics of<br>
the digitally converted analog signal detected by the microphone 106. The spectral<br>
characteristics would then be conveyed to a voice activity detector 204, which would<br>
attempt to detect the presence or absence of user speech. In at least some instances,<br>
the spectrum analysis circuit 202 can include a fast fourier transfer function and<br>
analysis circuit, as well as Bark scale spectrum estimation circuitry and Cepstrum<br>
coefficient conversion circuitry.<br>
Generally, the voice activity detector 204, associated with prior techniques,<br>
would detect the presence of any relatively stationary type noise, associated with one<br>
or more frequencies, such as the noise associated with the engine of a car. A noise<br>
attenuation circuit 206, would then apply a level of attenuation proportional to the<br>
detected amplitude of the detected stationary noise during the periods of time in<br>
which no voice activity has been detected by the voice activity detector 204 (i.e. the<br>
signal is comprised primarily of stationary noise). The resulting noise removed<br>
speech 208 would then be conveyed to the speech encoder circuit for forming an<br>
outgoing audio signal. However, when other types of noise such as non-stationary<br>
noise is present, often times the voice activity detector would be unable to distinguish<br>
the non-stationary noise from user voice activity, and no noise attenuation would take<br>
place.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a block diagram of a noise suppression circuit 300, in<br>
accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention. Similar to the<br>
noise suppression circuit 200, illustrated in FIG. 2, the noise suppression circuit 300<br>
includes a spectrum analysis circuit 302, which determines the various spectral<br>
characteristics of the digitally converted analog signal detected by the microphone<br>
106. The spectral characteristics are then conveyed to multiple voice activity<br>
detectors 304, which are generally each directed to detecting a different type of noise.<br>
In addition to a spectrum domain voice activity detector 306 and a time domain voice<br><br>
activity detector 308, which separately and/or together are directed to detecting<br>
various types of generally stationary type noises, the multiple voice activity detectors<br>
304 additionally includes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) voice activity detector<br>
310.<br>
The Gaussian Mixture Model voice activity detector 310 represents a<br>
statistical model based voice activity detector, which is pre-trained using a large<br>
quantity of samples of pre-collectcd babble noise. The statistical model based voice<br>
activity detector is generally constructed with a Gaussian Mixture Model, in which<br>
the model parameters are estimated via a maximum likelihood training procedure to<br>
characterize the babble noise data. A log likelihood score is then calculated, when at<br>
least a short segment of detected audio signal is matched against the Gaussian<br>
Mixture Model. The score is then smoothed and used to make a decision as to<br>
whether babble noise is present during the lime period of the corresponding analyzed<br>
segment.<br>
The results of the multiple voice activity detectors 304 are then used by a<br>
noise type detection circuit 312 (i.e. logic decision circuitry) to determine the<br>
presence and the type of any noise. The results of the multiple voice activity detectors<br>
304 are further used by a signal-to-noise gain estimate circuit 314 to estimate an<br>
amount of any detected noise. The determination of the presence, the type, and the<br>
amount of noise is then used by noise removal circuitry, which in the illustrated<br>
embodiment is in the form of a noise attenuation circuit 316 and a noise subtraction<br>
circuit 318, to remove noise from the digitally converted analog signal detected by the<br>
microphone 106. The noise attenuation circuit 316 is principally involved with the<br>
removal of any detected stationary type noises, and the noise subtraction circuit 318 is<br>
principally involved with the removal of any detected babble type noises.<br>
More specifically, the noise attenuation circuit 316 attenuates those frequency<br>
bands in which the signal-to-noisc ratio are low. The noise subtraction circuit 318<br>
subtracts noise components from the signal being processed. Because the noise<br>
attenuation circuit 316 works more smoothly in noise only portions of the signal being<br>
processed, and the noise subtraction circuit 318 is capable of removing noise<br><br>
overlapped with speech, the combination of the two methods offer a synergistic effect<br>
in removing noise more effectively, thereby producing the noise removed speech 320.<br>
Comfort noise is then added to the noise removed speech 320 using an adder<br>
circuit 322. The comfort noise is produced by a comfort noise source circuit 324,<br>
which determines the type and amount of comfort noise based at least in part on the<br>
outputs of the noise type detection circuit 312 and the signal-to-noise gain estimate<br>
circuit 314. The comfort noise is intended to mask audible artifacts that may be<br>
introduced as part of the noise attenuation and/or noise subtraction. For example, in<br>
the absence of added comfort noise, if the degree of noise clearance is not the same<br>
over time, one might hear some form of tone noise or noise pumping, together with<br>
the intended clean speech. The comfort noise, once appropriately added, is generally<br>
perceived much more tolerably than the original noise, such as any babble or<br>
stationary noise.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a more detailed block diagram illustrating an exemplary<br>
Gaussian Mixture Model voice activity detector 400, of the type illustrated as part of<br>
the noise suppression circuit, illustrated in FIG. 3. The Gaussian Mixture Model<br>
voice activity detector 400 includes a Gaussian Mixture Model Bayesian classifier<br>
402, which is coupled to a voice speech model 404 and a babble noise model 406,<br>
each including a pattern for one or more types of speech and babble noise,<br>
respectively. The Gaussian Mixture Model Bayesian classifier 402 fundamentally<br>
behaves as a pattern matching circuit, which in turn produces the above mentioned log<br>
likelihood score, based upon the patterns contained in the voice speech model 404 and<br>
the babble noise model 406.<br>
The log likelihood score is then smoothed using a score smoothing circuit 408.<br>
The smoothed scores are then provided to decision logic circuit 410 to determine the<br>
presence, type, and amount of babble noise, if any. Corresponding noise statistics are<br>
determined by corresponding circuitry 412, which in turn is used by the noise<br>
attenuation and subtraction circuitry 316 and 318.<br>
When babble noise is detected with reasonable confidence, the noise statistics<br>
are accumulated by corresponding circuitry 414 and analyzed. The resulting analysis<br>
is then used by corresponding circuitry 416 to produce updates for the babble noise<br><br>
model 406, and potentially the voice speech model 404. The updates are intended to<br>
keep the babble noise model 406 and the voice speech model 404 fresh, and to adapt<br>
the models to more readily detect the types of babble noise that they are more likely to<br>
encounter, based upon actual usage experience.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary two way communication<br>
device 500, in which the noise suppression circuit, illustrated in FIG. 3, can be<br>
implemented. In the embodiment illustrated, the two way communication device<br>
includes an audio signal processing circuit, which could be of the type illustrated in<br>
FIG. 1, and which includes a noise suppression circuit of the type illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
A speaker 104 and a microphone 106 are coupled to the audio signal processing<br>
circuit 100, to convert between user producible and detectible audio signals and a<br>
representation of the same in the form of an electric signal. The audio signal<br>
processing circuit 100 is adapted to receive and produce an audio data stream which is<br>
encoded as data packets suitable for transmission via a wireless radio frequency<br>
communication interface. The audio signal processing circuit 100 is coupled to a<br>
transceiver 502, which in turn is coupled to an antenna 504, which together are<br>
capable of communicating with a remote radio source.<br>
While the noise suppression circuit 300 is specifically shown as being capable<br>
of being implemented as part of a two way wireless communication device, one<br>
skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the noise suppression circuit 300 could<br>
alternatively be used in connection with any type of device that is capable of receiving<br>
an audio signal, especially where the audio signal may have at least an intended<br>
portion and an unintended portion (i.e. noise), which might be detected with the<br>
intended portion.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a method 600 for suppressing noise in an audio signal, in<br>
accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention. The method<br>
includes detecting 602 the presence of a plurality of different types of noise using a<br>
plurality of different types of noise detectors. The detected type of noise in the audio<br>
signal is then suppressed 604 using one of a plurality of different types of noise<br>
reduction circuits, when the corresponding type of noise is detected.<br><br>
While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and<br>
described, it is to be understood that the invention is not so limited. Numerous<br>
modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will occur to those<br>
skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention<br>
as defined by the appended claims.<br><br>
