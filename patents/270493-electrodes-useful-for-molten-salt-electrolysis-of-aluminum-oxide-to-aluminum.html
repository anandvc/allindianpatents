ELECTRODES USEFUL FOR MOLTEN SALT ELECTROLYSIS<br>
OF ALUMINUM OXIDE TO ALUMINUM<br>
This patent application is a continuation-in-part of<br>
5  U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/874,508, filed on June<br>
22,  2004 in the names of Leslie Edwards, M.  Franz Vogt,<br>
Richard 0. Love, J. Anthony Ross and William Morgan Jr.<br>
This application is to be incorporated herein, in toto, by<br>
this specific reference thereto.<br>
10<br>
The present invention relates to an electrode, e.g. an<br>
anode, for use in the manufacture of aluminum by molten salt<br>
electrolysis of aluminum oxide, e.g. in an aluminum<br>
reduction cell. More particularly, it relates to a process<br>
15 for manufacturing an anode for use in aluminum reduction<br>
cells .<br>
It has been known to manufacture aluminum by molten<br>
salt electrolysis of aluminum oxide dissolved in a bath of<br>
2 0 the fluorides of aluminum and sodium, or cryolite, using a<br>
carbon anode. Usually, such an electrolysis process is<br>
conducted at about 900° to 1000° Centigrade. In this<br>
process, the carbon anode is consumed by oxidation due to<br>
the oxygen produced by the decomposition of aluminum oxide<br>
2	5  to the aluminum metal.<br>
In commercial anode production processes, calcined<br>
sponge petroleum cokes or coal tar pitch cokes, along with<br>
recycled carbon anode remnants or butts, are used to provide<br>
3	0  an aggregate which is then separated into different size<br>
fractions.  Typically,  there can be anywhere between 3-6<br>
different size fractions. A common approach is to separate<br>
1<br><br>
3502<br>
the aggregate into three fractions: a "butts" fraction,<br>
"coarse" fraction and "fines" fraction. The different size<br>
fractions are then recombined in fixed proportions and mixed<br>
with a binder such as coal tar pitch or a combination of<br>
5 coal- tar and petroleum pitches (combination pitch) and<br>
subsequently shaped and heated at an elevated temperature,<br>
e.g. about 1100°C, to form the commercial anode. The<br>
manufacture of such commercial anodes requires a coke that<br>
has low volatile matter, vanadium and nickel under 500ppm<br>
10  and sulfur under 4%, by weight, and preferably under 3%, by<br>
weight.   In addition, to having relatively low impurities,<br>
the cokes used in commercial anode production, are somewhat<br>
anisotropic in structure. Such coke is preferably calcined,<br>
sponge coke.  In contrast to anisotropic cokes, isotropic<br>
15 cokes are cokes with a very fine-grained structure or<br>
texture which exhibit similar properties in all directions.<br>
That is, anisotropic cokes have a coarser texture and the<br>
properties are directionally dependent. The extreme example<br>
of anisotropic coke is needle coke which has an elongated or<br>
2	0  ribbon like structure.  Delayed sponge coke used for making<br>
anodes has  a heterogeneous structure with a mixture of<br>
isotropic and anisotropic structures.<br>
Shot coke is a form of isotropic coke with a very<br>
25 unique structure. It has a fine texture with uniform<br>
directional properties, and the particles tend to be more<br>
spherical in shape and more uniform in size. Shot coke<br>
typically also has lower macro-porosity (porosity &gt;lμm) and<br>
higher micro-porosity (<l than delayed sponge cokes used></l>
3	0  to make anodes.<br>
2<br><br>
3502<br>
There is a large supply of isotropic and shot coke<br>
materials in the world, and they are generally significantly<br>
lower in price than traditional anode grade green cokes.<br>
The impurity levels are typically higher than anode grade<br>
5 cokes, particularly impurities like sulfur, vanadium and<br>
nickel and this is the primary driver of their lower cost.<br>
The aluminum industry has avoided using isotopic cokes,<br>
particularly shot cokes, to make anodes because they have<br>
10 high coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE). Anodes made<br>
with these materials can crack catastrophically during the<br>
rapid heat-up that occurs in aluminum electrolysis cells.<br>
This creates a hazardous and costly outcome for the aluminum<br>
plant or smelter.<br>
15<br>
As a result, shot coke, with its higher impurity<br>
levels, more isotropic structure and higher thermal<br>
expansion coefficient when calcined, has never been<br>
successfully used for such commercial anodes.<br>
20<br>
In particular, carbon anodes, made from an aggregate<br>
comprising more than 5% by weight of shot coke, exhibit a<br>
propensity for thermal shock cracking due to the high<br>
coefficient of thermal expansion and the anode strength is<br>
25 weakened due to the difficulty in binding shot coke<br>
particles with coal tar or combination pitch. Thus, the<br>
anode scrap rates from anodes prepared from shot coke are<br>
unacceptably high and anode carbon loss in the aluminum<br>
reduction  cells  creates  a  serious  and  unacceptable<br>
3 0  disruption to the smelting process.<br>
3<br><br>
3502<br>
When discussing petroleum coke, it is essential to<br>
recognize that there are three different types of coking<br>
processes and the. petroleum coke produced from each is<br>
distinctly different.. These processes - delayed, fluid and<br>
5 flexicoking - are all effective in converting heavy<br>
hydrocarbon oil fractions to higher value, lighter<br>
hydrocarbon gas and liquid fractions and concentrating the<br>
contaminants (sulfur, metals, etc.) in the solid coke.<br>
10 Petroleum coke from the delayed process is described as<br>
delayed sponge, shot or needle coke depending on its<br>
physical structure. Shot is most prevalent when running the<br>
unit under severe conditions with very heavy crude oil<br>
residuum  containing  a  high  proportion  of  asphaltenes.<br>
15 Needle coke is produced from selected aromatic feedstocks.<br>
Although the chemical properties are most critical, the<br>
physical characteristics of each coke type play a major role<br>
in the final application of the. coke. For example, sponge<br>
coke has a relatively high macro-porosity and the pores are<br>
20 evident from visual examination of the coke. If the quality<br>
is acceptable, it may be sold to the calcining industry as a<br>
raw material for anode coke production where it has a higher<br>
value. Shot coke looks like BB's, has a lower macro-<br>
porosity and is harder; it is almost always sold as a fuel<br>
2 5 coke for a relatively low value. Needle coke's unique<br>
structure lends to its use for graphitized electrodes.<br>
Unlike the others, needle coke is a product (not a by-<br>
product) which the refinery intentionally produces from<br>
selected hydrocarbon feedstocks.<br>
30<br>
         Shot coke is characterized by small round spheres of<br>
coke,   the  size  of  BB's,   loosely  bound  together.<br>
4<br><br>
3502<br>
Occasionally, they agglomerate into ostrich egg sized<br>
pieces. While shot coke may look like it is entirely made<br>
up of shot, most shot coke is not 100% shot. Interestingly,<br>
even sponge coke may have some measurement of embedded shot<br>
5 coke. A low shot coke percentage in petroleum coke is<br>
preferably specified for anode grades of petroleum coke.<br>
Shot coke, while useful as a fuel, is less valuable<br>
than sponge coke which can be used to prepare the more<br>
10 valuable carbon anodes. It is therefore desirable to find a<br>
way to use the less valuable shot coke in an application<br>
having a greater value, i.e. to manufacture carbon anodes,<br>
provided said carbon anodes do not have poor quality.<br>
15   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Preferably, in accordance with the present invention,<br>
the aggregate comprises more than 5%, by weight, of shot<br>
coke, and may comprise up to 90%, by weight, of shot coke,<br>
20 but preferably the anodes of this invention will comprise up<br>
to about 50%, e.g. from about 15% to about 5 0% shot coke.<br>
The shot coke, is preferably calcined to remove most of the<br>
volatiles prior to use in the method of the invention.<br>
2	5       The calcined shot coke, may be screened and milled to<br>
provide particles in the correct size ranges. For the<br>
purposes of the present invention, fine particles are<br>
defined as those whereby 10 0% will pass through a 60 mesh,<br>
Tyler Sieve Size and approximately 70% or more will pass<br>
3	0  through a 200 mesh U.S. Standard Sieve Size.<br>
5<br><br>
3502<br>
The milling process to obtain the above fine particles<br>
is common knowledge in the art and need not be disclosed<br>
herein.<br>
5 The particulate shot coke, may have a sulfur content of<br>
up to 8%, by weight. It is generally undesirable for the<br>
coke utilized in the manufacture of carbon electrodes for<br>
use in an aluminum reduction cell to have a sulfur content<br>
of greater than about 4%.<br>
10<br>
The remainder of the aggregate may comprise any<br>
particulate carbonaceous material that is suitable for<br>
preparing carbon electrodes, including recycled anode butts,<br>
for use in aluminum reduction cells.   Such carbonaceous<br>
15  materials are well known in the art.<br>
Preferably, said carbonaceous material is selected from<br>
the group consisting of sponge, needle or pitch cokes, and<br>
recycled carbon electrode remnants.<br>
20<br>
It has now been discovered that a satisfactory carbon<br>
electrode, suitable for use in an aluminum reduction cell<br>
may be prepared from a particulate carbonaceous, aggregate,<br>
preferably comprising more than about 5%, by weight, of a<br>
2	5  shot coke, and more preferably said aggregate comprises from<br>
5% to about 50%, by weight, of a shot coke.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a method of making<br>
a carbon electrode, suitable for use as an anode in an<br>
3	0  aluminum  reduction  cell,  which  comprises  separating  an<br>
aggregate into different size fractions by a combination of<br>
crushing, milling and screening whereby such an aggregate<br>
6<br><br>
3502<br>
may comprise a mixture of a particulate shot coke, recycled<br>
anode butts, and a particulate carbonaceous material other<br>
than shot coke, with coal tar pitch or combination pitch at<br>
an elevated temperature to form a paste wherein said<br>
5 aggregate comprises a combination of butts, coarse, and fine<br>
particles and said paste comprises up to about 90%, e.g.<br>
about 85%, by weight, of said aggregate and from about 10 to<br>
about 20%, e.g. 15%, by weight, of said coal tar pitch or<br>
combination pitch; forming said paste into a solid body; and<br>
10 baking said solid body at an elevated temperature to form<br>
said carbon electrode.<br>
Furthermore, it has now been discovered that in the<br>
process of preparing electrodes of this  invention,  the<br>
15 properties of the electrode can be influenced significantly<br>
by selecting the size of the shot coke used in the<br>
aggregate. For example, if the shot coke is added to the<br>
coarse fraction of the aggregate, the anode density can be<br>
improved but the coefficient of thermal expansion will be<br>
20 negatively affected (higher). The anode air reactivity on<br>
the other hand, will not be significantly affected when shot<br>
coke, is added to the coarse fraction of the aggregate.<br>
When shot coke is milled and added to the fines fraction,<br>
25  the  coefficient  of  thermal  expansion  will  not  be<br>
significantly affected but no improvement in anode density<br>
will occur. The anode air reactivity on the other hand, will<br>
be negatively affected (increase) when the shot coke is<br>
added to the fines fraction of the aggregate.<br>

5  DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the method of the invention, the above described<br>
aggregate is combined with a coal tar pitch binder or a<br>
combination pitch binder.<br>
10<br>
Coal tar pitch is a residue produced by distillation or<br>
heat treatment of coal tar. It is a solid at room<br>
temperature, consists of a complex mixture of numerous<br>
predominantly aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclics, and<br>
15 exhibits a broad softening range instead of a defined<br>
melting temperature. Petroleum pitch is a residue from heat<br>
treatment and distillation of petroleum fractions. It is<br>
solid at room temperature, consists of a complex mixture of<br>
numerous  predominantly  aromatic  and  alkyl-substituted<br>
2	0  aromatic hydrocarbons, and exhibits a broad softening range<br>
instead of a defined melting temperature. Combination pitch<br>
is a mixture or combination of coal tar pitch and petroleum<br>
pitch.<br>
25 The hydrogen aromaticity in coal tar pitch (ratio of<br>
aromatic to total content of hydrogen atoms) varies from 0.7<br>
to 0.9. The hydrogen aromaticity (ratio of aromatic to<br>
total hydrogen atoms) varies between 0.3 and 0.6. The<br>
aliphatic hydrogen atoms are typically present in alkyl<br>
3	0  groups  substituted  on  aromatic  rings  or  as  naphthenic<br>
hydrogen.<br>
9<br><br>
3502<br>
The aggregate utilized in the method of the present<br>
invention comprises a mixture of fine, coarse and recycled<br>
anode butts particles. The mesh sizes for the fine<br>
particles are defined above. Coarse particles, which may<br>
5 also contain recycled anode butts, will be retained on a 16<br>
mesh Tyler screen.<br>
The aggregate is combined and mixed with the coal tar<br>
pitch or combination pitch. There are numerous mixing<br>
10 schemes in the art. Any of them may be adapted for use in<br>
the method of this invention, simply by treating the shot<br>
coke-containing aggregate in the same way as the current<br>
aggregate is combined with the pitch.<br>
15 It is important that the aggregate and the pitch are<br>
mixed together at an elevated temperature, e.g. greater than<br>
150°C, in order to coat the particles with pitch, penetrate<br>
the pitch and the fine particles into the internal pores of<br>
the coarse particles and fill the interstitial aggregate<br>
20  volume with the pitch and the fine particles.<br>
After mixing the aggregate and the coal tar pitch for 1<br>
to 45 minutes, e.g. from 5 to 20 minutes, a paste is formed.<br>
25 The paste may be formed into a solid body, by methods<br>
known in the art, e.g. pressing or vibroforming, prior to<br>
baking to form the electrode.<br>
The green electrode is baked at an elevated temperature<br>
3 0  to provide a carbon electrode suitable  for use  in an<br>
aluminum reduction cell.  Preferably, the green electrode is,<br>
baked at a temperature of from 1000°C to 1200°C, e.g. about<br>
10<br><br>
3502<br>
1100°  Centigrade  for  a  time  sufficient  for the  green<br>
electrode to reach a temperature within the preferred range.<br>
The baking may take place in open or closed furnaces,<br>
5  as is well known in the art.<br>
The method of the invention provides carbon electrodes<br>
having characteristics including density, air permeability,<br>
compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, thermal<br>
10 conductivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, air<br>
reactivity, and carboxy-reactivity which are within<br>
acceptable ranges, for use in aluminum smelters.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
15  provided a carbon electrode, suitable for use an anode in an<br>
aluminum reduction cell, which comprises (a)  an aggregate<br>
comprising  a mixture of particulate  shot  coke,  and  a<br>
particulate carbonaceous material  other than said shot coke,<br>
and (b) a coal tar or combination pitch binder, wherein said<br>
2 0  aggregate  comprises  a  combination  of  coarse  and  fine<br>
particles  and  said particulate  shot  coke,  comprises  a<br>
majority of said coarse particulates.<br>
In  said  electrode,  preferably  said  aggregate  is<br>
2	5  prepared by  screening  and/or milling  shot  coke,  and a<br>
carbonaceous material other than said shot coke from a<br>
delayed coker to provide a particulate mixture comprising at<br>
least 5%, preferably about 3 0 to 4 0 percent by weight.<br>
3	0       To this screened and/or milled aggregate may be added<br>
from about 5 to about 2 0 percent, e.g. about 15% butts.<br>
Thus, the aggregate utilized in the method of preparing the<br>
11<br><br>
3502<br>
anodes of the invention may comprise from 5 to 60 percent,<br>
preferably about 50% coarse, from. 10 to 50 percent,<br>
preferably about 34% fine, and from 0 to 25% preferably, 16%<br>
butts. Also, in said preferred aggregate the shot coke may<br>
5  vary from 10 to 85.0, by weight, of the aggregate.<br>
Preferably the particulate carbonaceous material in the<br>
electrode is selected from the group consisting of sponge,<br>
needle  or  pitch  cokes,  and  recycled  carbon  electrode<br>
10  remnants.<br>
In this aspect of the present invention, the fines may<br>
comprise shot coke, e.g., milled shot coke, or some other<br>
particulate carbonaceous material, e.g., fine particulates<br>
15  from the delayed coking of heavy hydrocarbon oil fractions.<br>
Any of the above, novel electrodes or electrodes made<br>
by the method of the present invention may be used in a<br>
method  for  producing . aluminum  by  the  molten  salt<br>
2 0 electrolysis of aluminum oxide which comprises electrolyzing<br>
aluminum oxide dissolved in a molten salt at an elevated<br>
temperature by passing a direct current through an anode to<br>
a cathode disposed in said molten salt wherein said anode is<br>
any of the above electrodes.<br>
25<br>
The cokes utilized in the following examples have the<br>
properties shown in Table 1, below.<br>

The characteristics of shot cokes are as follows:<br>
•	The shot cokes are significantly higher in Ni, V and<br>
10         S.<br>
•	The shot coke has a significantly higher vibrated<br>
bulk density (KVBD) and apparent density (AD).<br>
•	The  real  density  (RD)  of  the.  shot  coke  was<br>
significantly  lower  and  a  specific  electrical<br>
15         resistivity significantly higher.<br>
•	The air reactivity of the shot coke and isotropic<br>
coke is higher.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
20<br>
In this example, shot coke was added to two of the<br>
aggregate size fractions - coarse and fines. Control anodes<br>
using 100% regular delayed anode coke were prepared for<br>
comparison.<br>
25<br>
A total of 5 different anode formulations were prepared at 3<br>
different pitch levels  (15.5,  16.0, and 16.5%)  to give a<br>
13<br><br>

Example 2<br>
In the experiments described in this Example 2,  the<br>
5  shot coke was concentrated in different fractions of the<br>
aggregate.  It was expected that it would be advantageous to<br>
grind the shot coke and concentrate it in the fines fraction<br>
to minimize the negative effects on CTE.   Two different<br>
types of pitch were also tested in this set of experiments -<br>
10  regular coal tar pitch and a coal tar/petroleum pitch blend.<br>
The anodes of this experiment were produced in a larger<br>
mixer batch size (17kg/mix) and a lab scale vibroformer<br>
instead of a hydraulic press was utilized.  The anode baking<br>
15 furnace was also larger, allowing up to 3 0 anodes to be<br>
baked at one time. The quantity of fines required was too<br>
large to produce in a laboratory ring and puck mill so a<br>
70kg/hr. ball mill was used. The particle size distribution<br>
was monitored closely to make sure it matched the size<br>
20 distribution of the ball mill utilized in commercial<br>
production of carbon anodes for aluminum smelting.<br>
Fifteen different anode formulations were tested in<br>
Example 2 at two different pitch levels giving a total of<br>
25 thirty different mixer batches. Six lab anodes were<br>
produced from each mixer batch giving a total of one hundred<br>
eighty laboratory anodes. The different formulations tested<br>
are shown in Table 2 below.<br>

3502<br>
The results in this Example 2 show that anode<br>
properties of the carbon anodes of this invention as<br>
prepared with the addition of shot are dependent on how the<br>
shot coke is added. CTE's do not increase when the coke is<br>
5 added to the fines fraction but anode air reactivities<br>
deteriorate. When shot cokes are added to the coarse<br>
fraction, the CTE's increase significantly but anode air<br>
reactivities are not as significantly affected. In<br>
addition, there is a major advantage of adding shot coke to<br>
10 the coarse fraction, that is an increased anode density is<br>
obtained.<br>
Thus, the anodes prepared according to Example 2 where<br>
shot coke is selectively added to the coarse fraction, are<br>
15 especially useful in a smelter which uses relatively small<br>
anodes at lower currents (
cells are not as susceptible to thermal shock cracking as<br>
larger anodes in higher current cells. The design of such<br>
cells  is  typically quite  sensitive  to  anode  airburn,<br>
2 0 however, due to the difficulty in being able to keep the<br>
anodes well covered. As a result, any addition of shot coke<br>
to the fines fraction will exacerbate anode airburn and<br>
negatively affect cell performance.<br>
25	EXAMPLE 3<br>
Based on the results of Example 2, it was decided that<br>
the density gains possible by adding shot coke to the coarse<br>
fraction warranted additional optimization work.<br>
30<br>
In this experiment, the fines, content and pitch level<br>
of shot coke added to the coarse fraction was optimized.  A<br>
22<br><br>
3502<br>
single shot coke level was selected on the basis of the<br>
calculated anode sulfur level. At high shot coke addition<br>
rates, anode sulfur levels increase to the point where the<br>
smelter would exceed its SO2 emissions limit. The goal was to<br>
5 keep the aggregate sulfur level under 3%. To stay within<br>
this range, shot coke additions were limited to 40% of the<br>
coarse fraction which equated to 2 0% of the total aggregate<br>
(including butts).<br>
10 The fines content was optimized first by preparing dry<br>
aggregate mixes gave at different fines levels and measuring<br>
the vibrated bulk density. A fines content of 27% yields<br>
optimum results.<br>
15 Pitch optimization tests were carried out at two<br>
different butts levels (16% &amp; 18%) . Lab anodes were baked<br>
and tested and a formulation was selected for a plant trial.<br>
The main objective of the plant trial was to see if full<br>
size plant anodes could be produced with 20% shot coke<br>
20 without production problems. It was unknown for example,<br>
how these anodes would look (deformation and cracking) after<br>
forming and anode baking. If the anodes were acceptable in<br>
appearance, i.e. not chipped or cracked or otherwise<br>
damaged, a number of such anodes would be tested in a single<br>
25 electrolysis cell to see if thermal shock cracking would be<br>
a problem.<br>
Approximately sixty full  size plant electrodes were<br>
produced and tested in  a  single  electrolysis  cell.  No<br>
3 0  significant problems were found and there was no obvious<br>
thermal shock craqking despite the higher CTE. Anode butts<br>
23<br><br>
3502<br>
were weighed and the average butt weight was  14 7  lbs<br>
compared to the regular anode butt weight of 146 lbs.<br>
These positive results provided the incentive to move<br>
5  to larger scale plant trial but there was a concern that the<br>
low fines level made the anodes very sensitive to small<br>
pitch level changes.  Thus, a further experiment was carried<br>
out.<br>
10	EXAMPLE 4<br>
Additional lab experiments were undertaken at a fines<br>
level of 27% and 30%. From this work, the 30% fines shot<br>
coke anodes appeared to give the best results. A plant trial<br>
15 was then undertaken to select the optimum pitch level and to<br>
make sure that anodes could be produced successfully on a<br>
larger scale with minimal scrap rates.<br>
The properties of the shot coke anodes baking were<br>
20  better than expected.   Anodes were produced at 3 pitch<br>
levels and the optimum level appeared to be 14.4%.  This was<br>
1.4%  lower  than  the  optimum pitch  level  of  standard<br>
production  anodes  used  in  a  representative  commercial<br>
smelting process.   This represents a substantial potential<br>
25  cost saving for the smelter since pitch is significantly<br>
more expensive than calcined petroleum coke.<br>
Anode densities were also better than expected.   The<br>
average density of the 14.4% pitch anodes was 1.598 g/cc<br>
3 0  compared to a typical density of 1.555 g/cc.  A sustained<br>
density  increase  of  this  magnitude  would  allow  the<br>
24<br><br>
3502<br>
commercial smelting process to increase anode life in the<br>
electrolysis cells.<br>
No unusual problems were reported.<br>
5<br>
The results from this Example 4 warranted a larger<br>
scale plant trial where anode and cell performance would be<br>
monitored closely to determined the full potential of the<br>
anode produced by the method of this invention.<br>
10<br>
These shot coke anodes were utilized in a commercial<br>
aluminum smelting process or pots<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
15<br>
In a larger scale plant trial 710 full scale anodes<br>
were produced and tested in 4 closely monitored cells.<br>
The shot coke anodes were used to run the four cells<br>
2 0  through at least 3 full anode cycles.   Thus,  each cell<br>
completely changes out a set of shot coke anodes 3 times.<br>
This gives the cell more chance to reach steady state<br>
conditions and performance with the different anode quality.<br>
2	5       No thermal shock cracking or anode burn-offs occurred.<br>
