"UNCATALYSED ADDITION REACTIONS"<br>
JOHNSON MATTHEY PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY, a British body corporate of 2-4 Cockspur Street, Trafalgar Square, London SW1Y 5BQ, United Kingdom,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of   the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
1040/MUMNP/03<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
28-4-2008<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to novel, synthetic processes wherein (+)-2-carene epoxide (1) is coupled with a variety of reagents in the absence of acid or base catalyst.<br>
(+)-2-Carene epoxide (1) is a useful chiral intermediate that has been used as a<br>
precursor   to   tetrahydrocannabinoids.        The   acid-catalysed   and   base-catalysed<br>
 rearrangements of (+)-2-carene epoxide (1) have been extensively studied. What these<br>
studies have in common is that mixtures of products are invariably obtained, and the yield<br>
of the desired compound is modest at best<br><br><br><br>
Bledsoe and coworkers found that by treating (+)-2-carene epoxide (1) with 5 metatitanic acid, the rearranged product (+)-P-menthadieriol (2) was obtained in 85% yield (US 3,814,733). The present inventors have not achieved reproduction of Bledsoe's work. More typical is Bulliard's report of 44% yield of (2) when treating (I) with pyridiniurnpcra-toluenesulfonic acid (PPTS) in cyclohexane (Bull. Soc, Chim. Fr. 1991, 128, 222). Bledsoe also reports that treatment of (+)-2-carene epoxide (1) with 2% :0 sulfuric acid in water gives a mixture containing 50% (+)-/7-rnenth~2-ene-l,8~diol (3).<br><br><br>
(1)	(2)	(3)     <br>
Arata, Bledsoe and Tanabe have published a study of the isomerisaiion of (+)-2-carene epoxide (1) over solid acids and bases (J. Org. Chem. 1978, 43, 1660). Clark has noted a different rearrangement of (1) using ZnBr2(J. Org. Chem. 1978, 43, 519). (+}-p-   Menthadienol (2) and (+)-p-rnenth-2-ene-l,g-diol (3) are often major products in the catalysed rearrangements. The dienol (2) and the diol (3) have both been used to produce tetrahydrocannibmoids, particularly (-)-∆9-Tetrahydrocannibinol (∆9-THC).   A synthetic<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
route using the dienol (2) is disclosed by Razdan et al in US 4,025,516, and a synthetic route using the diol (3) is disclosed by Stoss et al in US 5,227,537.<br>
∆9~THC has also been synthesised directly by acid-catalysed reaction of (+)-2-carene epoxide (1) with olivetol (4), albeit in low yields. Razdan et al propose that this reaction is achieved via a ring-opened intermediate (scheme 1) (J, Amer. Chem. Soc. 1970, 43_, 519). Crombie et ai propose a mechanism involving a cyclopropylcarbinyl cation (scheme 2) (J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. Trans. 1, 1988, 1243).<br><br>
Mixtures of products and low yields generally result from the acid catalysed reactions of (+-)-2-carene epoxide (1). This is probably due to the very high lability of the vicinal cyclopropyl-epoxy moiety to acid, which releases the strain energy of two three-membered rings and leads to the very stable cyclopropylcarbinyl cation. Base catalysed rearrangements similarly produce mixtures of products and low yields.<br><br><br><br><br>
The present inventors have devised a synthetic route whereby (+)-2-carene<br>
epoxide (1) can be reacted cleanly and in high yield to produce useful, chiral products.<br>
i The synthetic route requires neither acid nor base catalysts, as employed in prior art<br>
methods.   Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the producing a<br>
compound of general formula (5):<br><br><br><br>
 wherein X is a nucleophilic moiety and Y is an electrophilic moiety;<br>
comprising the reaction of (+)-2-carene epoxide (1) with a compound of general formula X-Y wherein X and Y are as hereinbefore defined,<br><br><br>
X-Y<br>
characterised in that the reaction mixture consists essentially of a source of (+)-2-carene       epoxide (1), a compound of general formula X-Y, optionally an inert solvent and optionally a pH buffer.<br>
In the context of this invention, the term "nucleophilic moiety" is used to describe a chemical group containing an electron rich centre.  The term "electrophilic moiety" is      used to describe a chemical group containing an electron deficient centre.  Examples of X, a nucleophilic moiety, include OH and OR wherein R is alky], aryl. acyl or silyl. Examples of Y. an electrophilic moiety, include H and silyl.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Suitably the compound of general formula X-Y is water, an alcohol, a phenol, a.<br>
carboxylic acid, a silanol, a silylated alcohol, a silylated phenol, a silylated carboxylic<br>
acid, a carbon acid, a thiol, a phosphite, or a phosphate. In a preferred embodiment of the<br>
  invention, compound X-Y is water and the product of the process is (+)-P-menth-2-ene-<br>
1.8-diol(3):<br><br><br><br><br>
10<br><br>
The direct reaction of (+)-2-carene epoxide (1) with water proceeds more cleanly than the prior art acid cataiysed reactions of (+)-2-Carene epoxide (1).<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, compound X-Y is an alcohol, a phenol or a carboxylic acid. In an especially preferred embodiment, compound X-Y is olivetol (4) and the product of the process is an ether (6):<br><br><br>
   The ether (6) is proposed as an intermediate in the Razdan mechanism (scheme 1 above) but has not previously been isolated. Furthermore the Razdan mechanism is for an acid-catalysed reaction whereas there is no acid catalyst in the process of the present invention. The ether can be further converted to (-)-∆9-Tetrahydrocannibihol (∆9 -THC) by a ring closure reaction.   Reagents that will bring about the ring closuxe include<br><br><br><br><br>
BF3.(OEt)2 and t-BuQH. Therefore the present invention also provides a novel synthesis of ∆9-THC. comprising a first step wherein (+)-2-carene epoxide (1) is reacted with olivetol to produce an ether according to the process of the present invention, and a second step wherein the ether undergoes ring closure.<br>
(+)-2-Carene epoxide (1) can be prepared by any of the methods known in the art. Suitable methods include epoxidation of (+)-2-carene (7) with perbenzoic acid, peracetic acid or m-CPBA. A preferred method is epoxidation using Jacobs' version of Sharpless' method (TeL Lett. 1998, 39, 8521) wherein the reagents are CH3Re03 catalyst, pyridine, 10  hydrogen peroxide and CH2C12.<br><br><br>
In the process of the present invention the reaction mixture contains a source of (+)-2-carene epoxide (1). The source of (+)-2-carene epoxide (1) may be distilled (+-)-2-carene epoxide (1). The crude product of epoxidation can also be used as the source of      (+)-2-carene epoxide (1). Another source of (+)-2-carene epoxide (1) is a mixture of (+)-2-carene epoxide (1) and (+)-3-carene epoxide. (+)-3-Carene (8) is an inexpensive component of turpentine. A catalytic isoraerisation is generally used to produce (+)-2-carene (7). The isomerisation gives a 40:60 mixture of (+)-2 -carene (7) and (+)-3-carene (8) and separation of the components is difficult because they have very similar boiling points. However, the inventors have found that if the mixture of isomers undergoes epoxidation, the mixture of epoxide isomers ((+)-2-carene epoxide (1) and (+)-3-carene epoxide) can be used as the source of (+)-2-carene epoxide in the present invention. This is because the (+)-3-carene epoxide does not undergo the addition reaction with compound X-Y and can be easily removed from the product of general formula (5). Therefore in a particular embodiment of the invention, the source of (+)-2-carene epoxide is a mixture of (+)-2-carene epoxide and (+)-3-carene epoxide.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
An inert solvent may be used in the process of the invention, but often compound X-Y will provide the only solvent needed (even though the reaction mixture may initially be heterogeneous). Suitable inert solvents include dichloromethane, 1,3-dioxolane and ethyl acetate.<br>
A pH buffer is optionally included in the reaction mixture. The pH buffer is suitably employed when crude (+)-2-carene epoxide is used as the source of (+)-2-carene epoxide (1). Impurities present in the crude reagent can cause the pH to drop during the 10 course of the reaction, A pH buffer can maintain the pH and the reaction proceeds more efficiently. A buffer is not required when distilled (+)-2-carene epoxide is used. When compound X-Y is water, a preferred pH range for the reaction is 5.7-5.9.<br>
Suitably the process is carried out at room temperature or above, preferably 15 between 10°C to 150°C. The process is suitably carried out at atmospheric pressure.<br>
The product of the process can be separated from the reaction mixture using methods known to those in the art. One suitable method is to use a separating funnel and extract the product using a solvent such as ethyl acetate or heptane.    Methods of 20 purification of the product include chromatography and, if the product is a solid, recrystallisation from organic solvents.<br>
Preferably the reaction proceeds with a yield of at least 40%, more preferably with a yield of at least 50%.<br>
The reaction suitably proceeds with retention of the stereochemistry at the two chiral centres.<br>
The reactions of the present invention are significantly cleaner than similar        reactions using acid catalysts.   When acid catalysts are used, the cyclopropylcarbinyl cation is rapidly formed, which can rearrange to numerous products.   We believe that when no acid catalyst is used, weak acids such as water and methanol react by a more concerted mechanism of the type proposed by Razdan (Scheme 1 above).<br><br><br><br>
The present invention provides synthetic processes that may be used in industrial synthesis. (+)-p-Menth-2-ene-l,8-diol (3) is an important industrial precursor of ∆9-THC, and the present invention provides a clean, high-yielding synthesis from (+)-2-   carene epoxide (1). Also, the present invention provides a process for the production of an ether (6), that may also be a useful intermediate in the industrial production, of ∆.9-THC.<br>
