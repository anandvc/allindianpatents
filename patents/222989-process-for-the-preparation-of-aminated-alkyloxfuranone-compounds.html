				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> The  present  invention  relates  to  the  process  for  the preparation of aminated alkyloxyfuranone compounds.<br>
A subject of the invention is a new preparation process for aminated derivatives of alkyloxyfuranone, the compounds originating from this process and the use of these compounds in the synthesis of inhibitors of the conversion enzyme of interleukin-lbeta.<br>
Patent Applications WO9535308, W09722619, W09722618, EP519748, WO9633209 describe compounds which inhibit the conversion enzyme of interleukin-lbeta.<br>
The preparation process for some of the compounds described in the Applications mentioned above use the following compounds of formula (I):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which  R1   represents   an  ethyl   radical  and   R2   represents   a -CH=CH2   radical.<br>
The  compounds   of  formula   (I)   are prepared  from protected L-aspartic  acid and  require  4  synthesis  stages:    1)   acylation, 2)    reduction,   3)   oxidation,   4)   cyclization,    (Chapman K. T.    et al   Eoorg.   Med.    Chem.   Lett..  2.   (6),   613-8   (1992)).<br>
This   process   has  significant  disadvantages,   in particular in  the  case where  one  wishes   to  obtain the  chiral compounds   of  formula   (I).      In  fact,   an expensive  chiral starting  reagent must be  used:    L-aspartic  acid p-tert-butylester,   and above  all  chromatographic methods  must be<br><br>
used  to  isolate  and/or   to  purify  the  different dias te reois ome rs .<br>
Therefore   a subject   of   the  invention  is   to   find  another synthesis   route   for  the  compounds   of   formula   (I),   which avoids   starting with  this  starting product  and which does   not require  separations   by  chromatography.<br>
The Applicant  therefore proposes   a  new synthesis   route, starting  with   the   alkyloxyfuranone  of   formula   (II),   in racemic   form,   allowing  access   to  new  compounds   of   formulae (IVa),    (IVb),    (IVc)   or   (IVd)   as   defined below,   salified  or non salified,   which  are subsequently,   if  appropriate protected,   in  order  to  obtain in particular  the   compounds   of formula   (I).<br>
This   process   has   the  advantage  of being  able  to be implemented on  a  large scale,   starting  from a  compound of formula   (II),   which is   easily accessible  and inexpensive, with    separation  and/or purification stages   carried out  by crystallization  and not by chromatography.      Each diastereoisomer  of  formula   (III),    (IV)   or   (I)   can  therefore be  isolated.<br>
Therefore   a subject  of  the  invention is   on  the  one  hand the   following  compounds   of   formula   (IVa),    (IVb),    (IVc)   or (IVd):<br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br><br><br>
in which R^ is an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a phenylalkyl group containing 7 to 11 carbon atoms, as well as their addition salts with acids.<br>
The invention naturally extends to the salts of the compounds of formula (IVa), (IVb), (IVc) or (IVd), such as for example the salts formed with mineral or organic acids on the amine.  These can then be the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, sulphuric, phosphoric, acetic, formic, propionic, benzoic, maleic, fumaric, succinic, tartaric, citric, oxalic, glyoxylic, aspartic, alkane sulphonics such as methane or ethane sulphonics, arylsulphonics, such as benzene or paratoluene sulphonics and arylcarboxylics.<br>
They can also be chloroacetic or trichloroacetic acids. Quite particularly it is the salts formed with hydrochloric acid.<br>
When % is an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, it is in particular methyl, ethyl, butyl or propyl, and quite particularly ethyl.<br>
B/ phenylalkyl, is preferably meant the benzyl group.<br>
A more particular subject of the invention is the compound of formula (IVd) as defined previously, as well as its addition salts with acids.<br>
A quite particular subject of the invention is the compound of formula (IVd) in which % is an ethyl group, as well as its addition salts with acids.<br>
On the other hand a subject of the invention is a preparation process for the compounds of formula (IVa),<br>
(IVb), (IVc) or (IVd) as described above, characterized in that it comprises at least one of the following stages: a) the action of an arylamine of formula R3R4CHNH2 in which R3 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms and P^ is an optionally substituted aryl, on the racemic alkyloxyfuranone of formula (II):<br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
in which R^ is an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or phenylalkyl containing 7 to 11 carbon atoms, and obtaining the trans (4R/5R) and (4S/5S) isomeric compounds of formulae (Ilia) and (Illb) respectively:<br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
which  then<br>
-are separated by crystallization by carrying out,   if<br>
appropriate,   one or more salification   reactions,<br>
-or,   when   R3  is   a  hydrogen  atom,    resolved by  the  action of  an<br>
optically  active   acid,<br>
b)   if   appropriate,   an  epime ri zation   reaction  of   the  compound<br>
of   formula   (Ilia)   or   (Illb),   salified  or  non salified,   in  the<br>
presence  of  an  acid,   in order  to  obtain  the  cis    (4R,5S)   or<br>
(4S,5R)   isomeric   compounds   of   formula   (IIIc)   or   (II Id),   which if  appropriate   are salified,<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
c) hydrogenolysis reaction,<br>
-	either on the trans (4 R, 5 R) or (4S,5S) isomer of formula<br>
(Ilia) or (Illb), salified or non salified, in order to<br>
obtain the compound of formula (IVa) or (IVb) in the form of<br>
the trans ( 4 R, 5 R) or ( 4 S, 5 S) isomer as defined previously,<br>
which if appropriate is salified and/or protected,<br>
-	or on the cis (4 R, 5 S) or (4 S, 5 R) isomer of formula (IIIc)<br>
or (Ilid), salified or non salified, in order to obtain the<br>
compound of formula (IVc) or (IVd) in the form of the cis<br>
(4R,5S) or (4S,5R) isomer, as defined previously, which if<br>
appropriate is salified, and/or protected.<br>
In particular the protection reaction of the amines of formula (IVa), (IVb), (IVc) or (IVd), salified or non salified, is carried out by the action of the chloroformate of formula Cl-CO-0-CH2- &amp;2' % representing a terbutyl, (C2-C4)-alkenyl, (C2-C4)-alkynyl or phenyl radical, substituted or non substituted, in order to obtain the compounds of formula (la), (Ib), (Ic) or (Id), respectively in the form of the trans (4R,5R), (4S,5S) or cis (4R,5S),  (4 S, 5 R) diastereoisomers, which if appropriate are salified,<br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br><br>
The action of the arylamine of formula R3R4CHNH2 on the racemic alkyloxyfuranone of formula (II) is carried out according to standard methods required by Michael's reaction, namely, in particular, in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide at ambient temperature. The operation can also be carried out with R or S phenylethylamine or in aqueous isopropanol.<br>
The separation of the two trans (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers, namely the compounds of formulae (Ilia) and (Illb) respectively by crystallization is carried out according to methods known to a person skilled in the art concerning the separation of isomers.  B/ way of preferred example the separation is carried out by the action of trichloroacetic acid in a solvent such as terbutylmethylether or aqueous isopropanol.  The trans (4R,5R) isomer (Ilia) is crystallized<br>
in the form of the salt of t richloroacetic acid, while the trans (4S,5S) isomer (Illb) is recovered in the form of the salt of monochloroacetic acid by treatment of the mother liquors in the presence of monochloroacetic acid.<br>
When R3 is a hydrogen atom (non-chiral amine) the separation (resolution) is then carried out by means of a chi ral acid such as tartaric/ camphos ulphoni c, salicylic, dibenzoyltartaric or R+ 2, 4-hyd roxyphenoxyp ropi onic acid.<br>
The epimeri zation reaction on one of the (4R, 5 R) or (4S,5S) isomers of formula (Ilia) or (Illb) is carried out in the presence of a Lewis acid such as ferric chloride, titanium tetrachloride optionally complexed with tetrahydrofuran, boron trichloride, the etherate of boron tri fluoride and tin tetrachloride or an organic acid such as methane sulphonic acid, tri f luoroacetic acid and paratoluenesulphonic acid.  Preferably it is tin tetrachloride, in the presence of a slightly polar solvent such as dichloromethane, or methanes ulphoni c acid in a solvant such as toluene.<br>
The hydrogenolysis reaction on the cis or trans dias tereoisomer of formula (Ilia), (Illb), (IIIc) or (Hid), is carried out according to standard methods known to a person skilled in the art, for example, by the action of hydrogen in the presence of palladium on carbon at 10% in tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The acylation reaction with the chloroformate is preferably carried out in the presence of a base such as pyridine, in a slightly polar solvent such as dichloromethane.<br>
The formation of the base from the corresponding salt, i.e. return to the free amine, as well as salification methods with acids as defined previously is carried out according to methods known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
As regards the compounds of formula (III) when R^ is an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, it is preferably methyl or ethyl and when R^ is an aryl group, it is preferably phenyl or naphthyl.<br>
As regards the compounds of formula (I), when R&gt; is a (C2-C4) alkenyl or (C2-C4) alkynyl group, it is preferably -CH=CH2,-OCH, -CH-CH2-CH3' -OC-CH3.<br>
The protection reactions of the compounds of formula (I) are carried out according to methods known to a person skilled in the art and in particular with reference to the work of Philip J. Kociensky Protecting Groups Ed. Georg. Thieme Verlog Stuttgart New-York 1994.<br>
A more particular subject of the present invention is the process as defined previously, characterized in that the separation by crystallization of the compounds of formulae (Ilia) and (Illb) is carried out:<br>
a)	by the action of trichloroacetic acid, in order to obtain<br>
the corresponding salt of formula (Ilia) or (Illb),<br>
b)	then by the action of monochloroacetic acid on the mother<br>
liquors in order to obtain the salt corresponding to the<br>
other dias tereoisomer of formula (Ilia) or (Illb).<br>
A quite particular subject of the present invention is a preparation process as described previously for the compounds of formula (IVd) or (Id) as defined previously, characterized in that it comprises at least one of the following stages: a) the action of S phenylethylamine on the compound of formula (II), in order to obtain the following compounds of formulae (III1 a) and (Ill'b):<br>

salt of trichloroacetic acid then by the action of<br>
monochloroacetic acid in order to obtain the (4S,5S)<br>
stereoisomer (Ill'b) in the form of the salt of<br>
monochloroacetic acid,<br>
b)	if appropriate return to the free amine by the action of a<br>

the   form of  the  cis    (4S/5R)   diastereoisomer,<br>
i)   if  appropriate  to  the  action of  an  allyl  chloroformate  on<br>
the  compound  of   formula   (IVd)   in  order   to  obtain  the  compound<br>
of  formula   (Id)   in  the   form of   the  cis    (4S/5R)<br>
