Fieid of the Invention<br>
The present invention rotates to a system for the storage, transportation and supply of compressed natural gas (CNG), and constitutes an Integral solution for supplying gas to remote CNG stations (that do not have access to a fixed gas-supplying pipeline), industries, homes, or any other kind of natural gas consumption unit.<br>
Background of the Invention.<br>
it is already well-known in the art that there are several small cities and locations that, due to the low number of inhabitants, do not count on current gas supply, so the inhabitants have to purchase gas in carafes. This brings about several inconveniences for the user, that has to check the tube content often, and be in charge of re-loading it.<br>
Besides, due to the boom enjoyed in Argentina and several other countries by the use of CNG, several CNG stations have been installed for supplying said fuel for cars, but the location of them depends on the fixed pipeline routes within the gas supply network.<br>
This limits not only the location of CNG stations, but also the growth of car population running on CNG, since vehicles enjoy a certain autonomy with full fuel tanks, but once they empty, they shall be refueled. Thus, there should be CNG stations spread throughout the country for achieving a completely-autonomous system.<br>
Likewise, the lack of gas in some areas appears as a restriction for the settlement of industries that require the above mentioned fuel to work.<br>
The proposed system has been developed for allowing the settlement of gas stations or industries practically everywhere in the country, since it generates a unique gas supply system, easy to install, operate, and maintain.<br><br>

Dttfifed description for wnfrttftot tfjfJttiidit<br>
As indicated in fig-7, platforms are going to be installed in connection line groups of up to eight platforms, each of which will be operated In sequences for unloading the modules suiting from a certain module, and following a specific pattern as is described below.<br>
In order to maximiie the modules unloading, and allow the replacement of them by loaded ones, the system operates under an unloading sequences starting from any module and following a lower-bigger number sequence according to the number provided In the platform. This will bring about the fact that given the situation that there should always be a free problem in the system (in order to allow the unloading of the transportation vehicle) §nd the unloading of the modules happens sequentially, the position of the empty platform will rotate m the chosen unloading sense as the modules are being replaced, as is described next. The system has the capacity to automatically determine all the instances.<br>
In order to describe the sequence, it will be assumed that the system starts operating the first day in the platform number 1. Thus, the system itself verifies that the platform 1 counts on a module with enough pressure to supply the system,<br><br>
this is done through the pressure information sent by the pressure transmitter to the platform management computer.<br>
This way, the system will connect the platform to the gas system by opening the operated valve it is fitted with, allowing the CN6 contained in the module flows to the consumption installation, immediately after the valve is opened, the system verifies that the pressure readings are equal to those indicated in the pressure transmitter fitted in the inlet collector of the regulation plant. A difference between both measurements will mean that the system valve was not correctly opened, or that the operator forgot to open a valve.<br>
Once the valve is opened, the module starts to deliver the stored gas according to the requirements of the regulation plant and the system.<br>
Once the loading of the module has finished, the system will automatically open the valve in platform number 2 until the pressure indicates the correct completion of the sequence, after that, the system will proceed to shut off the operated valve in platform No. 1.<br>
Switching modules<br>
It has been stated before that once the CNG contained in the module is finished, platforms are switched. The design is aimed at producing the module switching at the lowest possible pressure so as to take out the biggest quantity possible of the gas contained in it.<br>
In order to do that, the system will decide the switch according to the following parameters.<br>
•	Normal switching pressure (NP).<br>
•	Minimum pressure in the system assuring the coverage of the regulation plant demand (MP).<br>
•	Last chosen pressure to switch modules (PL).<br><br>
•   Regulated pressure at the outlet of the plant (RP).<br>
Both parameter? enable programming at installation, and their function is to guarantee installation services under the best condition possible.<br>
Since the regulation plant and premises count on a variable volume of flow according to the inlet and outlet pressure, and that besides, the demand for the volume of flow is also variable during the day, and the year due to seasonal effects and demand peaks, the system constantly verifies, once the MAT volume is bebw the normal pressure (NP), that given the demand state, the system can keep within the set parameters the regulated pressure at the outlet of the plant. The NP is the pressure used to measure the system in a state of maximum demand, but since this state of the demand will only appear sometimes during the year, the system monitors the regulated pressure (RP) as a variable for decision-making, deciding in this case the necessary minimum pressure (MP) for switching, and proceeding to switch the module if the RP is impossible to keep.<br>
In case consumption is minimum, the module will continue reducing its pressure until reaching the last pressure (LP), this being the minimum pressure chosen for switching modules, when necessary.<br>
Since the number of modules is directly related to the instantaneous consumption required for Installation, platforms were designed to be grouped in sets of 9 platforms (8 modules connected, m addition to a fr— platform). The volume of flow these platforms can deliver coincides with the autonomy rendered by modules for high consumption, so, whenever the installation of more modules is required, a higher volume of flow will also be required if more module lines are to be installed (for instance 2 lines), modules No. 1 of platforms will be simultaneously opened, and so on.<br><br>
Transportation vehicle<br>
The vehicle especially conditioned to transport modules, showed in Fig. (Si¬te), comprises a trailer pointed out in general reference 60, prepared to transport two, three, or four modules (1) respectively.<br>
Each trailer has a machine (61) that in turn counts on its corresponding hoist (62), hoisting system (63), anchorage system (64), arms (65), rollers (66), arms (67), and the corresponding seats (68) so as to fasten the trailer beam. The number of machines (61) for the trailer (60) is equal to twice the number of modules 1.<br>
its function is to load modules 1 on the trailer (60) coming from the loading or unloading platform. To unload the modules on the trailer to the platform. To fasten the module to be transported through a fastening system.<br>
The equipment is supplemented with stabilizing (70), the function of which is to stabilize the trailer in order to be able to carry out the task of loading and unloading die modules of the platforms. Each trailer is fitted with four legs (71) specifically calculated and designed to resist the weight of the modules the trater carries. The commands that operate the pistons putting the legs down are on the valve panels.<br>
These legs make up a set located in the middle of the trailer, and another at the end of it. These shall be supported on a perfectly leveled terrain, free of weeds, and fenced according to specifications.<br>
The machine (60) counts on two hydraulic pistons that are only operated when the module (1) is in the anchorage position. The rods act directly on the container skis (8), thus eliminating unnecessary parts, wear and tear, or undesired breakages of vital parts.<br><br>
Now, there follows a brief description of the hoisting operation of the modules to the trailer, in order to do so, the module (1) has lifting eyebolts on the skis where the shackles of the hoisting engine slings ere hooked.<br>
The vehicle counts on two valve panels from where all trailer hydraulic systems are operated, from there the hoists of each module (1) »rt operated, with specifically measured slings and hooks.<br>
In order to unload the trailer MAT, the following operations shall take place (see Fig. 9):<br>
•	To put down the legs that stabilize and fasten the trailer.<br>
