				<td>CATALYST FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION OF OXYGEN<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a catalyst, in particular to an electrocatalyst for oxygen<br>
reduction suitable for incorporation in a gas-diffusion electrode structure, and to a<br>
method for manufacturing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Noble metal sulphides are widely known in the field of electrocatalysis; in particular<br>
electrocatalysts based on rhodium and ruthenium sulphide are currently incorporated<br>
in gas-diffusion electrode structures for use as oxygen-reducsng cathodes in highly<br>
aggressive environments, such as in the depolarised electrolysis of hydrochloric acid.<br>
Noble metal sulphide electrocatalysts of the prior art are for instance prepared by<br>
sparging hydrogen sulphide in an aqueous solution of a corresponding noble metal<br>
precursor, usually a chloride, for instance as disclosed in US 6.149,782, entirely<br>
incorporated herein as reference, which is relative to a rhodium sulphide catalyst.<br>
The synthesis of noble metal sulphide catalysts with hydrogen sulphide in aqueous<br>
solutions is conveniently carried out in the presence of a conductive carner, in most<br>
of the cases consisting of carbon particles. In this way, the noble metal sulphide is<br>
selectively precipitated on the carbon particle surface, and the resulting product is a<br>
carbon-supported catalyst, which is particularly suitable for being incorporated in gas-<br>
diffusion electrode structures characterised by high efficiency at reduced noble metal<br>
loadings. High surface carbon blacks, such as Vulcan XC-72 from Cabot Corp./USA<br>
are particularly fit to the scope.<br>
A different procedure for the preparation of carbon-supported nable metal suphid<br>
catalysts consists of an incipient wetness impregnation of the carbon carrier with a<br>
solution of a noble meta! precursor salt, for instance a noble metal chloride, followed <br><br><br>
by solvent evaporation and gas-phase reaction under diluted hydrogen sulphide at<br>
ambient or higher temperature, whereby the sulphide is formed in a stable phase.<br>
This is for instance disclosed in US 2004/0242412, relating to a ruthenium sulphide<br>
catalyst.<br>
A more advanced manufacturing process for noble metal sulphide catalysts is further<br>
disclosed in US 6,967,185, entirely incorporated herein as reference, and consists of<br>
reacting a noble metal precursor with a thio-compound in an aqueous solution free of<br>
sulphide ions; in this way, a catalyst substantially equivalent to the one of US<br>
6,149,782 is obtained avoiding the use of a highly hazardous and noxious reactant<br>
such as hydrogen sulphide.<br>
Although the catalysts disclosed in the above referenced documents proved of<br>
utmost importance for the successful commercialisation of hydrochloric acid<br>
electrolysers, they still presents some limitations in terms of activity and of stability to<br>
the particularly aggressive environment typical of such application and consisting of a<br>
hydrochloric add solution containing significant amounts of dissolved chlorine and<br>
oxygen.<br>
As regards the activity, noble metal sulphides precipitated by the methods of the prior<br>
art are all prepared by discrete reduction stages producing a mixture of different<br>
crystalline phases with different valences and stoichiometry, some of which presene<br>
poor electrochemical activity or none at all. Moreover, some of the most active<br>
formulation consist of ternary compounds which cannot be reliably prepared by the<br>
environmentally friend method of US 6,967,185; the only viable process for obtaining<br>
ternary compounds, such as RuxCOzSy which is also very attractive in terms of cost<br>
is the one disclosed in US 2004/0242412, still relying on hydrogen sulphide as<br>
reactant species.<br>
As concerns the stability, the above mentioned mixed-valence systems comprised of<br>
different crystalline phases typical of the catalysts of the prior art inevitably results to<br>
some extent in the formation of less stable phases such as zerovalent metals, metal<br>
oxides and non-stoichiometric perovskites. Although rhodium and ruthenium<br><br><br>
sulphides are much more stable than any other electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction<br>
of the prior art in the hydrochloric acid electrolysis environment, some leakage of<br>
noble metal is stilI detectable, especially when the cell is shut-down for maintenance.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is one object of the present invention to provide a novel composition of sulphide<br>
catalyst for electrochemical reduction of oxygen overcoming the limitations of the<br>
prior art; in particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide a more active<br>
and stable catalyst for cathodic oxygen reduction in a process of hydrochloric acid<br>
electrolysis.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a gas-diffusion electrode<br>
incorporating a novel composition of sulphide catalyst useful as cathode in a process<br>
of depolarised hydrochloric acid electrolysis.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a novel method for<br>
manufacturing sulphide catalysts for electrochemical reduction of oxygen.<br>
These and other objects will be clarified by the following description, which shall not<br>
be understood as a limitation of the invention, whose extent is exclusively defined by<br>
the appended claims.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Under a first aspect, the invention consists of a catalyst for electrochemical reduction<br>
of oxygen comprising a noble metal sulphide supported as a single well-defined<br>
crystalline phase on a conductive carbon; preferably, the noble metal catalyst of the<br>
invention is a single crystalline phase of a binary or ternary rhodium or ruthenium<br>
sulphide.<br>
In the case of binary rhodium sulphides expressed by the genera! formula RhxSy the<br>
inventors have found that the manufacturing methods of the prior art invariably lead<br>
to a mixed-valence system at least comprising the species Rh2S3, Rh17S15, -and<br><br><br>
Rh3S4 with some amount of metallic rhodium (Rh°). Of alt these species, Rh17S15<br>
characterised by a crystal lattice corresponding to the (Pm-3m) space group is the<br>
most active, followed by monoclinic (C2/m) Rh2S3, while the remaining species<br>
present little or no activity and in some cases a lesser stability. Rh° is unstable in<br>
hydrochloric acid electrolysis conditions, and accounts for the quickest rhodium leaks<br>
during operation. In accordance with the processes of US 6,149,782 and US<br>
6,967,185 for example, the typical amount of Rh17S15 is a little higher than 70% of the<br>
overall rhodium sulphide species.<br>
The inventors have surprisingly found that a single crystalline phase of (Pm-3m)<br>
Rh17S15 on active carbon can be prepared by suitably modifying the environmentally-<br>
friendly manufacturing process disclosed in US 6,967,185. The term single crystalline<br>
phase is used hereafter to mean a more than 90% pure crystal phase; in the cases of<br>
the (Pm-3m) Rh17S15 catalyst according to the invention, the single crystal phase<br>
obtained is about 95% pure with no detectable Rh°. The method for manufacturing a<br>
single crystalline phase of (Pm-3m) Rh17S15 on active carbon comprises the steps of:<br>
-	reacting a precursor salt of rhodium, for instance RhCI3, with a sulphur source<br>
such as a thiosulphate or thionate species in the presence of a strong<br>
reducing agent and of conductive carbon particles, thus precipitating an<br>
amorphous sulphide species on the carbon particles<br>
-	recovering the slurry, preferably by filtration<br>
-	heat treating the recovered slurry in inert atmosphere at a temperature of 500<br>
to 1250'C until obtaining a single crystalline phase corresponding to (Pm-3m)<br>
Rh17S15.<br>
Besides thiosulphates and thionates, other sulphur sources can be used to initiate<br>
the metathesis step characterising the method of the invention: tetrathionates such<br>
as Na2S4O6 . 2 H2O and other similar thionate species such as dithionates.<br>
trithionates, pentathionates and heptathionates are all fit for this purpose, and also<br>
gaseous SO2 possesses both the reducing power and the sulphur availability to<br>
produce amorphous MxSy moieties on a selected support,<br><br><br>
The support carbon particles have preferably a surface area comprised between 200<br>
and 300 m2/g, and the preferred specific loading of the resulting rhodium sulphide on<br>
carbon is comprised between 12 and 18%.<br>
The sequence of addition of the reactants is critical to obtain the desired product: to<br>
the solution containing the suspended carbon particles and the rhodium precursor<br>
salt, the selected sulphur source (for instance a tiosulphate or thionate species) is<br>
added, so that the metathesis process can initiate. Simultaneously or immediately<br>
after, depending on the specific reaction, a strong reducing agent, defined as a<br>
species with a reduction potential below 0.14 V/SHE. is added in small aliquots. As<br>
reducing agent, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is preferred, but other suitable<br>
reactants include UAIH4, hydrazines, formaldehyde and metallic aluminium, zinc or<br>
antimony.<br>
The reducing agent as defined has a reduction potential below the one of S0 / S-2<br>
couple: in this way, it can achieve the instantaneous metathesis of the metal ions and<br>
of the thiosulphate part, directly forming amorphous rhodium sulphide on the carbon<br>
support particles while preventing the formation of discrete reduction states which<br>
are the main factor controlling the yield and phase distribution of the different<br>
sulphide moieties.<br>
The method of the invention can be applied to the manufacturing of other single<br>
crystalline phases of noble metal sulphides, including not only sulphides of a single<br>
metal (binary sulphides) but also of two or more metals (ternary sulphides and so on).<br>
This proves particularly useful in the case of ruthenium sulphides, because also in<br>
this case the method of the invention gives rise to the most active and stable single<br>
crystalline phase.<br>
By applying the method of the invention, binary (RyS2) and ternary (HuxMzSy)<br>
ruthenium sulphides, M being a transition metal preferably selected among W , Co<br>
Mo, Ir, Rh, Cu, Ag and Hg, precipitate in a singie crystalline phase wIth lattice<br>
parameters corresponding to a pyri$e-type lattice (Pa 3 space yroup). The resulting<br>
(Pa 3) RuS2 or RuxMzSv catalysts turn out to be more active and more stable in the<br><br><br>
hydrochloric acid electrolysis conditions than mixed-valence ruthenium sulphide<br>
systems of the prior art. The preferred catalyst specific loading and selected carbon<br>
support are the same applying for rhodium sulphide; also the method of<br>
manufacturing is substantially the same, even though suitable temperatures for the<br>
thermal treatment may vary from 150 to 1250oC.<br>
The specific reaction pathway of the method according to the invention has the main<br>
advantage to intervene on the reduction potentials of the metals and the thionic<br>
moieties preventing the formation of discrete reduction states, which are the main<br>
factor controlling the yield and proper phase composition of the selected<br>
chalcogenide moiety as mentioned above. The method of the invention promotes the<br>
instantaneous metathesis of the metal ions and the thionic part. For instance, by<br>
reacting the chloride form of a transition metal such as rhodium, whose aqueous<br>
hydrolysis gives a pH in the range of 1 to 1.5, with sodium tetrathionate dihydrate<br>
(Na2S4O6 2H2O) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in the presence of carbon, it is<br>
possible to directly synthesise amorphous RhXSy supported on carbon. The reaction<br>
is conducted at room temperature and can be followed by pH and spot tests. At<br>
completion, the slurry is collected and heat-treated in inert environment for a<br>
sufficient time to provide the required single phase rhodium sulphide supported<br>
catalyst. The same procedure can be used to obtain other binary and ternary<br>
sulphides with specific crystal phase distributions. In some cases, the kinetics and<br>
yield of the reaction can be improved by adding catalytic amounts of metals such as<br>
Al, Sn, Co and others.<br>
The disclosed catalysts are suitable for being incorporated in gas-diffusion electrode<br>
structures on electrically conductive webs as known in the art.<br>
The manufacturing of rhodium and of ruthenium sulphide catalysts according to the<br>
invention are disclosed in the following examples, which shall not be understood as<br>
limiting the invention; suitable variations and modifications may be trivially applied by<br>
one skilled in the art to manufacture other carbon supported-single crystalline phase<br>
sulphide catalysts of different noble and transition metals relying on the method of<br>
the invention without departing from the scope thereof.<br><br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
Figures 1a and 1b show an X-Ray diffractograms of a rhodium sulphide catalyst<br>
prepared according to the method of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Described herein is a method to precipitate a rhodium sulphide single crystalline<br>
phase on carbon according to the method of the invention; precipitation reactions of<br>
other noble metal sulphide catalysts (such as the sulphides of ruthenium, platinum,<br>
palladium or iridium) only require minor adjustments that can be easily derived by<br>
one skilled in the art.<br>
7.62 g of RhCl3.H2O were dissolved in 1 I of deionised water, and the solution was<br>
refiuxed.<br>
7 g of Vulcan XC 72-R high surface area carbon black from Cabot Corporation were<br>
added to the solution, and the mix was sonicated for 1 hour at 40oC.<br>
8.64 g of (NH4)2S2O3 were diluted in 60 ml of deionised water, after which a pH of<br>
7.64 was determined (sulphur source).<br>
4.14 g of NaBH4 were diluted into 60 ml of deionised water (reducing agent).<br>
The rhodium/Vulcan solution was kept at room temperature and stirred vigorously<br>
while monitoring the pH. in this case, the sulphur source and reducing agent<br>
solutions were simultaneously added dropwise to the rhodium/Vulcan solution.<br>
During the addition, pH, temperature and colour of the solution were monitored.<br>
Constant control of the pH is essential in order to avoid the complete dissociation of<br>
the thionic compound to elemental S0.<br>
The kinetics of the reaction is very fast, therefore the overall precipitation of the<br>
amorphous sulphide occurs within few minutes from the beginning of the reaction.<br>
Cooling the reaction can help in slowing the kinetics if needed. The reaction was<br>
monitored by checking the colour changes: the initial deep pink/orange colour of the<br><br><br>
rhodium/Vulcan solution changes dramatically to grey/green (reduction of Rh+3 to<br>
Rh+2 species) and then colourless upon completion of the reaction, thus indicating a<br>
total absorption of the products on carbon. Spot tests were also carried out in this<br>
phase at various times with a lead acetate paper; limited amount of H2S was<br>
observed due to a minimal dissociation of the thionic species. The precipitate was<br>
allowed to settle and then filtered; the filtrate was washed with 1000 ml deionised<br>
water to remove any excess reagent, then a filter cake was collected and air dried at<br>
110oC overnight<br>
The dried product was finally subjected to heat treatment under flowing argon for 2<br>
hours at 650°C, resulting in a weight loss of 22,15%.<br>
The resulting carbon supported catalyst was first characterised in a corrosion test, to<br>
check its stability in a hydrochloric acid electrolysis environment<br>
For this purpose, part of the sample was heated to boiling in a chlorine-saturated HCI<br>
solution, at the same conditions disclosed in Example 4 of US 6,149,782. The<br>
resulting solution was colourless, not even showing the characteristic trace pink of<br>
the more stable forms of rhodium sulphide of the prior art.<br>
An X-ray diffractogram of the rhodium sulphide catalyst is shown in Figures 1a and<br>
lb. RhxSy usually obtained by precipitation is characterised by a balanced phase<br>
mixture of at least three Rb-S phases: orthorhombie (Pbcn) Rh2S3, monociinic (C2/m)<br>
Rh3S4. and primitive cubic (Fm-3m) Rh17S15. The Rh2S3 phase is an electronic<br>
insulator built of alternating RhS6 octahedra. The average Rh-Rh bond distance of<br>
3.208 A (compared to 2.69 A in fcc Rh metal) thus removes any possibility of direct<br>
Rh-Rh bonding. In contrast, the Rh1?S15 phase possesses semiconductor properties<br>
at room temperature. In addition, Rh17S15 consists of Rh8 octahedra with an average<br>
Rh-Rh distance of 2,59 A. The Rh3S4 phase, with its metallic Rh6 octahedra eaves, is<br>
an active site for O(H) adsorption. Figure 1a shows the diffractogram on top and the<br>
characteristic peaks of the different Rh-S phases below: the comparison clearly<br>
shows how the Rh17S15 phase is absolutely predominant (&gt;95%) with a characteristic<br>
set of 4 peaks at 20 = 37.38 - 40.68° representing the (104), (114), (223), and (024)<br><br><br>
reflections, and the high intensity peaks at 47.64 and 52.16° indicating the (333) and<br>
(044) reflections.<br>
This is even more evident in figure 1b, where the characteristic peaks of the Rh17S15<br>
phase are superposed to the XRD spectrum.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A ruthenium cobalt ternary sulphide (3:1) catalyst was prepared in a similar manner<br>
as the one of Example 1, the difference being that the thionic reagent is now part of<br>
the metal ion solution, thus the metathesis reaction occurs in-situ on the metal ion<br>
sites.<br>
7.62 g of RuCl3 xH2O were dissolved in 1 I of deionised water, and the solution was<br>
refluxed.<br>
2.46 g of CoCl2-xH2O were also added to the Ru containing solution and refluxed as<br>
above.<br>
8 g of Vulcan XC72-R high surface area carbon black from Cabot Corporation were<br>
added to the solution, and the mix was sonicated for 1 hour at 40°C.<br>
17.5 g of CNH4)2S2O3 were diluted in 100 ml of deionised water, after which a pH of<br>
772 was determined, then added to the catalyst/Vulcan solution (sulphur source).<br>
6.54 g of NaBH4 were diluted into 100 ml of deionised water (reducing agent).<br>
The sulphur source solution containing ruthenium, cobalt and Vulcan carbon black<br>
was kept at room temperature and stirred vigorously while monitoring the pH. Once<br>
the reducing agent solution was prepared, it was added dropwise to the sulphur<br>
source solution. During the addition of the reagents, pH, temperature and colour of<br>
the solution were monitored. Constant control of the pH is essential in order to avoid<br>
the complete dissociation of the thionic compound to elemental S°.<br>
As for Example 1, also in this case the kinetics of the reaction is very fast therefore<br>
the overall precipitation of the amorphous sulphide occurs within few minutes from<br>
the beginning of the reaction. Cooling the reaction can help in slowing the kinetics if<br><br><br>
needed. The reaction was monitored by checking the colour changes: the initial deep<br>
brown/orange colour of the initial solution changes dramatically to colourless upon<br>
completion of the reaction, thus indicating a total absorption of the products on the<br>
carbon. Spot tests were also carried out in this phase at various times with a lead<br>
acetate paper; limited amount of H2S was observed due to a minimal dissociation of<br>
the thionic species. Moreover, no Co0 (metal) was observed; spot test for such<br>
particular metal is very straightforward because of the magnetic proprieties of Co0<br>
The precipitate was allowed to settle and then filtered; the filtrate was washed with<br>
1000 ml deionised water to remove any excess reagent, then a filter cake was<br>
collected and air dried at 110oC overnight.<br>
The dried product was finally subjected to heat treatment under flowing nitrogen for 2<br>
hours at 500°C, resulting in a weight loss of 32.5%.<br>
The resulting carbon supported catalyst was subjected to the same corrosion and<br>
electrochemical tests of the previous example, showing identical results<br>
Actual performances in hydrochloric acid electrolysis of the catalyst prepared<br>
according to the method of the Invention and incorporated in a gas-diffusion structure<br>
on a conductive web as known in the art were also checked<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Different samples of the catalysts of Examples 1 and 2 were prepared m xed to a<br>
PTFE dispersion and incorporated into conventional flow-through gas diffusion<br>
electrode structures on carbon cloth. All the electrodes were compared to a standard<br>
state-of-the-art supported RhxSy electrode for hydrochloric acid electrolysis<br>
according to the teaching of US Patent 6,149,782 and 6,967,185 (Sample 0). Such<br>
electrodes were tested as oxygen-consuming cathodes in a 50 cm2 active area<br>
laboratory cell against a standard anode, making use of a by-product aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid solution from an isocyanate plant. The overall cell voltage was<br>
recorded at two different current densities, namely 3 and 6 kA/m2, and the<br>
corresponding values are reported in Table 1<br><br><br><br>
All of the tested electrode samples showed an excellent catalytic activity, resulting in<br>
a sensible voltage decrease with respect to the electrode activated with a rhodium<br>
sulphide catalyst of the prior art (sample 0).<br>
Equivalent rhodium sulphide catalysts were obtained also by using sodium<br>
trithionate. tetrathionate and heptathionate precursors previously prepared according<br>
to known procedures, with minor adjustments easily derivable by one skilled in the<br>
art. Analogous corrosion and electrochemical results were obtained also in these<br>
cases.<br>
