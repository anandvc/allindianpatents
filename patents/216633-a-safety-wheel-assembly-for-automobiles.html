				<td>This invention relates to a safety wheel assembly for automobiles. It consists of two wheels mounted on the axle in close proximity with each other. The first wheel has a tyre which is inflatable, while the second wheel has a non-inflatable tyre. The diameter of the second tyre is slightly less than that of the first tyre, such that a clearance is established between the height of these two tyres. The first wheel is rotatably mounted while the second wheel is non-rotatable. In the event of a tyre burst, the primary tyre collapses and the secondary tyre establishes contact with the ground. This prevents skidding overturning of the vehicle.</td>

				<td>This invention relates to a safety wheel assembly for automobiles which is applicable to two wheelers, three wheelers, cars, trucks and heavy vehicles.<br>
Tyre burst is one of the most common factors leading to automobile accidents. Whenever a tyre bursts in a speeding automobile, the vehicle tends to lose its balance and the driver has no option but to apply sudden brakes to stop the vehicle. In many instances, skidding and overturning of the vehicle due to tyre bursts result in fatal or non-fatal injuries to its occupants and may also damage the vehicle. Such accidents may involve other vehicles as well as pedestrians.<br>
Various precautionary measures and devices are available to prevent or minimise road accidents. Road safety measures are also rigorously implemented by the authorities. Automobile parts including tyres are subjected to stringent quality control tests by appropriate authorities before being commercially released. Inspite of all this, tyre bursts occur due to bad road conditions, presence of sharp and pointed objects on the road and other related conditions.<br>
An object of my invention is to avoid or minimise accidents due to tyre bursts. The safety wheel assembly helps in bringing the vehicle to a stop even before the application of sudden brakes. This prevents skidding and overturning of the vehicle, saving life and property.<br><br>
The safety wheel assembly consists of a primary wheel and a secondary wheel mounted on the same axle^; The primary wheel has a normal inflated tyre mounted thereon by conventional means. The secondary wheel is located on the axle in close proximity with the primary wheel. The primary wheel is mounted on the extreme outer end of the axle while the secondary wheel is located close to it on the inner side of the primary wheel. These two wheels may be fixed to the axle by known or conventional means. The primary wheel has mounted thereon an inflated tyre which may be tubeless or may be provided with an inflatable tube. The secondary wheel located on the inner side of the primary wheel has an ordinary rubber tyre which need not be  inflated.   In other words, the secondary wheel  is  provided<br>
, with  a, dummy  tyre.   This secondary tyre is  attached  to  the ,<br>
"•■■*   ;.";..	....... .,_„.-—--.....-	,   i<br>
primary  tyre  such thai a clearance is established  between  the<br>
two.   For instance, this tyre may have a diameter less than  the /<br>
tyre  of the primary wheel and is positioned slightly  above  the I<br>
ground.   The primary wheel is rotably mounted on the axle while<br>
the secondary wheel is fixedly mounted thereon.  This enables the<br>
vehicle  to be driven in the conventional way by the movement  of I j<br>
the tyres attached to the primary wheel.<br>
In the event of a tyre burst, the air from the primary wheel tyre leaks out bringing the pressure down. Collapse of the primary wheel tyre brings the secondary wheel down which establishes contact with the surface of the road. Since this wheel has a non-inflated solid rubber tyre, skidding is avoided and the vehicle comes to a stop as soon as contact is established<br><br>
by the dummy tyre with the surface of the road. Sudden braking and eventual problems associated therewith are avoided by using the safety wheel assembly of this invention.<br>
It is preferred to provide two such safety wheel assemblies on the two front wheels in a four wheeler. It may also be provided on all the wheels for additional safety.<br>
The safety wheel assembly for automobiles according to this jinvention comprises a primary wheel and a secondary wheel mounted on the axle of an autombobile, the said primary wheel being located on the outer extreme of the axle and is provided with an inflatable tyre, the said secondary wheel being located in close jproximity with the primary wheel on the inner side of the said axle, the said secondary wheel having a non-inflatable tyre, the ,. *aid secondary wheel tyre having a diameter less than that of the<br>
/primary wheel tyre, thereby establishing a clearance.<br>
/<br>
The diameter of the dummy tyre on the secondary wheel is about 10 mm less than that of the tyre of the primary tyre. In other words a clearance of about 10 mm is provided between the two, and immediately after a tyre burst the secondary tyre establishes contact with the ground and the vehicle becomes stationary. The wheel assembly must be provided on either side of the axle to maintain balance of the vehicle.<br><br>
Though the invention has been described herein above with particular reference to a specific embodiment, variations and alterations known to persons skilled in the art are within its scope and ambit.<br><br><br>
I Claim:<br>
1.	A safety wheel asembly for automobiles comrpising a primary wheel and a secondary wheel mounted on the axle of an automobile, the said primary wheel being located on the outer extreme of the axle and is provided with an inflatable tyre, the secondary wheel being provided in close proximity with the primary wheel on the inner side of the said axle, the said secondary wheel having a non-inflatable tyre, the said secondary wheel tyre having a diameter less than that of the primary wheel tyre thereby establishing a clearance.<br>
2.	The safety wheel assembly as claimed in claim 1 wherein the diameter of the secondary wheel tyre is 10 mm less than the diameter of the primary wheel tyre.<br><br>
3.	The safety wheel assembly as claimed in claims 1 and 2 wherein the said assembly is mounted on either side of the front wheels of a four wheeler.<br>
4.	The safety wheel assembly as claimed in claims 1 to 3 wherein the said assembly is provided on the front and back axle of the automobile.<br>
5.	The safety wheel assembly as claimed in claims 1 to 4 wherein the non-inflatable tyre is solid rubber tyre.<br><br>
6.    A safety wheel assembly for automobiles,  substantially  as herein described.</td>
