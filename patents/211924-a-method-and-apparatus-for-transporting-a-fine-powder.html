POWDER FILLING APPARATUS AND METHODS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation-in-part application of and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Patent Application Serial No.	, which was<br>
converted from U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/949,047, filed October 10, 1997, the complete disclosures of which are here.! n incorporated by reference .<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1	.   Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of fine powder processing, and particularly to the metered transport of fine powders.  More particularly, the present invention relates to systems, apparatus and methods for fill i.ng receptacles wi th unit dosages of non- f lowable but di spersible fine powdered medi caments, particularly for siibsequent inhalation by a patient.<br>
Effecti ve delivery to  a patient is a critical aspect of any snccessful drug therapy.  Various routes of del ivery exist, and each has its ov/n advantages and disadvantages. Oral drug delivery of tablets, capsules, elixirs, and the like, is perhaps the most convenient method, but many drugs have di sagreeable flavors, and the size of the tablets makes them d i F f icult to swallow .  Moreover, such medicaments are ogten degraded in the di gest i ve tract before they can be alisorbed.   Such degradat i on i s a particular problem with modern protein drugs which are rapidly degraded by proteolytic enzymes i n the digestive tract.  Subcutaneous injection is frequently an effective route for systemic drug delivery, inc1udinq the delivery very of prnt e i ns , but has a low pat lent acceptance and produces sliaip waste items, e,.g. needles, which<br>
are   difficult to dispose Sine the need too inject drugs on a froquent schedule such as instil in one or more times a day, can<br><br>
be a source of poor patient compliance, a variety of alternative routes of administration have been developed, including transdermal, intranasal, intrarectal, intravaginal, and pulmonary delivery.<br>
Of particular interest to the present invention are pulmonary drug delivery procedures which rely on inhalation of a drug dispersion or aerosol by the patient so that the active drug within the dispersion can reach the distal (alveolar) regions of the lung.  It has been found that certain drugs are readily absorbed through the alveolar region directly into blood circulation.  Pulmonary delivery is particularly promisi ng for the delivery of proteins and polypeptides which are difficult to deliver by other routes of administration. Such pulmonary delivery can be effective both for systemic delivery and for localized delivery to treat diseases of the lungs.<br>
Pulmonary drug delivery (including both systemic and local) can itself be achieved by different approaches, includinq liquid nebulizers, metered dose inhalers (MDI's) and dry powder dispersion devices.  Dry powder dispersion devices are part icularly promisinq for delivering protein and polypeptide drugs which may be readily formulated as dry powders .  Many otherwise 1 ahi 1 e proteins and polypeptides may be stably stored as lyophilized or spray-dried powders by themselves or in combi nat: i on with suitable powder carriers .  A further advantage is that dry powders have a much higher concentration than medicaments in 1iquid form.<br>
The abi1ity to deliver proteins and polypeptides as dry [)nwders, however, is problematic in certain respects.  The donage of many protein and   polypeptide drugs is often cri.tica] so   it is necessary that any dry powder delivery system be able to arr:urately, precise! y and repeat ably deliver the intended amount of drug.  Moreover, many proteins and polypeptides are quite expensice, typical1y being many t imes more costly than conventional drugs on a per dose basis.  Thus, the ability to efficiently deliver the dry powders to the target region of the lung with a minimal loss of drug is critical .<br><br><br>
Of particular interest to the present invention are the physical characteristics of poorly flowing powders. Poorly flowing powders are those powders having physical characteristics, such as flowability, which are dominated by cohesive forces between the individual units or particles (hereinafter "individual particles") which constitute the powder.  In such cases,    the powder does not flow well becavise the individual particles cannot easily move independently with respect to each other, hut instead move as clumps of many particles.  When such powders are subjected to low forces, the powders will tend not to flow at all.  However, as the forces actinq upon the powder are increased to exceed the forces of cohesion, the powder wi11 move i.n large agglomerated "chunks" of   the individual particles  When the powder comes to rest, the large agglomerateons remain, resulting in a non-uniform<br><br><br>
For example, when metering the fine powders prior to placement in the unit dose receptacle, the powders often agglomerates inconsistently, creating voids and excessive density variation, thereby reducing the accuracy of the volumetric metering processes which are commonly used to meter in high throughput production.  Such inconsistent agglomeration is further undesirable in that the powder agglomerates need to be broken down to the individual particles, i.e. made to be dispersible, for pulmonary delivery.  Such de-agglomeration often occurs in dispersion devices by shear forces created by the air stream used to extract the medicament from the unit dose receptacle or other containment, or by other mechanical energy transfer mechanisms (e.g. , ultrasonic, fan/impeller, and the like) .  Hov/ever, if the small powder agglomerates are too compacted, the shear forces provided by the air st:ream or other dispersing mechanisms will be insufficient to effectively disperse the medicament to the individual particles.<br>
Some at tempt: s to prevent agglomeration of the individual particles are to create blends of multi-phase powders (typically a carrier or diluent) where larger particles (sometimes of multiple size ranges) , e.g. approxi mately 50 µm, are combi ned with smaller drug part icles, e. g. 1 /nn to 5 µm.  In this case, the smaller particles attach to the larger particles so that under processing and filling the powder wil] have the characteristics of a 50 /im powder.<br><br>
Such a powder is able to more easily flow and meter.  One disadvantage of svich a powder, however, is that removal of the smaller particles from the larger particles is difficult, and the resulting powder formulation is made up largely of the bulky flowing agent component which can end up in the device, or the patient's throat.<br>
Current methods for filling unit dose receptacles with powdered medicaments include a direct pouring method where a granular powder is directly poured via gravity (sometimes in combination with stirring or "bulk" agitation) i nto a metering chamber.  When the chamber is filled to the desired level, the medicament is then expelled from the chamber and into the receptacle.  In such a direct pouring process, variations in density can occur in the metering chamber, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the metering chamber in accurately measuring a unit dose amount of the medicament.  Moreover, the powder is in a granular state which can be undesirable for many applications. <br>
Some attempts have been made to minimize density variations by compacting the powder within, or prior to depositing it in the metering chamber.  However, such compaction is undesirable, especially for powders made up of only fine particles, in that it decreases the dispersibility of the powder, i.e. reduces the chance for the compacted powder to be broken down to the i ndividual particles during pulmonary delivery with a dispersion device.<br>
It would therefore be desirable to provide systems and methods for the processing of fine powders whi ch would overcome or greatly reduce these and other problems.  Such systems and methods should allow for accurate and precise metering of the fine powder when divided into unit doses for p]acement in unit dose receptacles, particularly for low mass fills.  The systems and methods should further ensure that the fine powder remains suf ficiently dispersible during processing so that the fine powder may be used with existing inhalation devices which requi re the powder to be broken down to the indiVidual part i cles before pulmonary delivery.  Further, the systems and methods should provide for the rapid processing of<br><br>
t<br>
the fine powders so that large numbers of unit dose receptacles can rapidly be filled with unit dosages of fine powder medicaments in order to reduce cost,<br>

SUMMARY OF TFIE INVENTION The invention provides systems, apparatus and methods for the metered transport of fine powders into unit dose receptacles.  In one exemplary method, such fine powders are transported by first agitating the fine powders with a vibrating element, and then capturing at least a portion of the fine powder.  The captured fine powder is then transferred to a receptacle, with the transferred powder being sufficiently uncompacted so that it can be substantially dispersed upon removal from the receptacle.  Usually, the fine powder v;ill comprise a medicament with the individual particles having a mean size that is less than about 100 /im, usually less than about 10 µm, and more usually in the range from about 1 µm to 5 µm.<br>
The fine powder will preferably be placed into a hopper having an opening at a bottom end.  The element is vibrated to agitate the fine powder.  Vibration of the powder in the vicinity of the opening assists in the transfer of a portion of the fine powder through the opening where it may be captured into a chamber.  Vibration of the element also assists in de-agglomerating powder within the metering chamber so that the metering chamber may more uniformly be filled.<br>
The vibratable element is preferably vibrated in an up and down, i.e. vertical, motion relative to the powder in the hopper.  In one aspect, an ultrasonic horn is employed to vertically vibrate the element.  Alternatively, the element may comprise a rod that is vibrated back and forth, i.e. laterally, within the powder.  In another alternative, the vibratable element is vibrated in an orbital manner.  In one aspect, the rod is operably attached to a piezoelectric motor whi ch vi brates the rod.  Preferably, the element is vertically vibrated at a frequency in the range from about 1, 000 Hz to about 180,000 Hz, and more preferably from about 10,000 Hz to about 40,000 Hz, and most preferably from about 15,000 Hz to about 25,000 Hz.  The rod i s preferably vibrated laterally at a frequency in the range from about 50 Hz to about 50,000 Hz, and more preferably in the range from about 5 0 Hz to about<br><br>
V<br>
5,000 Hz, and most preferably in the range from about BO Hz to about 1. , 000 Hz .<br>
In another aspect, the element has a distal end which is placed near the opening.  Further, the distal end has an end member which is vi brated over the chamber to assist in transfer of the fine powder from the hopper to the chamber. The end member preferably projects laterally outward from the element.  In one aspect, the end member comprises a cylinder when the element is vibrated vertically.  In another aspect, the end member comprises a cross-member when the rod is 1ateral]y vibrated.  Preferably, the end-member is vertically spaced apart from the chamber by a distance in the range from about 0.01 mm to about 10 mm, and more preferably from about 0.5 mm to about 3.0 mm.  Such a distance assists in keeping the powder uncompacted when transferred to the chamber.<br>
In sti]1 another aspect, the element is preferably moved across the opening while being vibrated.  For instance, the element may be translated along the opening at a rate that is preferably less than about 100 cm/s. However, the part icular rate of translation will typically depend on the vibrational frequency of the element.  In this way, the element is swept across the chamber while being vibrated.<br>
Movement of the element along the opening is particularly preferable when multiple chambers are aligned with the opening.  In this way, the element may be employed to assist in the transfer of fine powder from the hopper into each of the chambers.  Optionally, a plurality of elements or rods may be vibrated within the hopper in the vicinity of the openings.  Preferably, the rods will be aligned with each other and will be translated along the opening while being vibrated, although in some cases the rods or elements may remain stationary over each chamber.<br>
To assist in the capture of the fine powder in the chamber, air is preferably drawn through the chamber bottom to draw the fine powder into the chamber.  Following capture of the fi ne powder, the powder is preferably transferred to a receptacle.  Transferring of the fine powder is preferably<br><br>
r<br>
  g<br>
In  still another aspect, the powder captured by the chamber is adjusted to be a unit dose amount.  This may be accomplished by placing a thin plate (or doctor sheet) between the hopper and the chamber.  The plate has an aperture to a]low for the transfer of the powder from the hopper and into the chamber.  The chamber is then moved relative to the plate, with the plate scraping any excess powder from the chamber. Alternatively, a doctor blade may be employed to scrape any excess powder from the chamber as the chamber is rotated.<br>
In one particvilar aspect, the powder is transferred to the hopper from a secondary hopper.  Preferably, the secondary hopper is vibrated to transfer the powder onto a chute where it passes into the primary hopper.  In still yet another aspect, the chamber is periodically removed and replaced with a chamber of a different size to adjust the volume of the chamber.  In this way, different unit dosages may be produced by the invention.<br>
The invention further provides an exemplary apparat us for transporting a fi ne powder.  The apparatus comprines a hopper for ho]ding the fine powder.  The apparatus further includes at least one chamber which is moveable to allow the chamber to be placed in close proximity to an openinq in the hopper.  A vibratable element is also provided having a proximal end and a distal end, with the element being placed within the hopper such that the distal end is near the openinq.  A vibrator is provided to vibrate the element when within the fine powder.  In this way, the element may be<br><br>
Vibrated to agitate the fine powder to assist in its transfer from the hopper to the chamber.  Preferably, the vibrator comprises an ultrasonic horn which vibrates the element in an np and down or vertical motion.  Alternatively, a piezoelectric motor may be employed to laterally vibrate the element.<br>
In one exemplary aspect, the apparatus further includes a mechanism for translat ing the vibratable element or rod over the chamber as the element is vibrated.  Such a mechanism is particularly advantageous when a plurality of chambers are provided in a rotatable member which is rotated to align the chambers with the opening.  The translating mechanism may then be employed to translate the element over the rotatable member so that the vibrating element passes over each chamber to assist in the filling of each with powder. The translating mechanism preferably comprises a linear drive mechanism which translates the rod along the opening at a rate that is less than about 100 cm/s.<br>
In another aspect, the vibrator is configured to vibrate the element in an up and down motion at a frequency in the range from about 1,000 Hz to about 180,000 Hz, and more preferably in the range from about 10,000 Hz to about 40,000 Hz, and most preferably in the range from about 15,000 Hz to about 2S,000 Hz.  When vibrated up and down, the vibratable element: preferably comprises a cylindrical shaft having a diameter in the range from about 1.0 mm to about 10 mm.  When vibrated laterally, the element preferably comprises a rod or wi re having a diameter in the range from about 0.01 inch to about 0.04 inch.<br>
An end-member is preferably operably attached to the distal 1 end of the vi bra table element to assist in agitation of the f i ne powder.  The end-member is preferably vertically spaced apart from the chamber by a distance in the range from about: 0.01 mm to about 10 mm, and more preferably from about 0.5 nun to about 3.0 mm.  In one alternative, the apparatus is Provided wi th a pi ural ity of vi.bratable elements so that multiple elements may be vibrated within the fine powder.<br><br>
I<br>
Tn still another aspect, the chamber is disposed w i tin n a rotatable member which is placed in a first position havinq the chamber aligned with the opening in the hopper, and a second position having the chamber aligned with a receptacle.  In this way, the chamber may be filled with powder when in the first position.  The rotatable member is then rotated to the second position to allow the powder to be expelled from the chamber and into the receptacle.  The chamber preferably includes a port which is in communication with a vacuum source to assist in drawing the fine powder from the hopper and into the chamber.  A filter is preferably disposed across the port to assist in capturing the powder.  A source of compressed gas is preferably also in communication with the port to eject the captured powder from the chamber and' into the receptacle.  A controller may be provided for controlling actuation of the gas source, the vacuum source and operation of the vibrator.<br>
The apparatus may also include a mechanism for adjusting the amount of captured powder in the chamber due to the chamber volume.  In this way, the captured amount will be a unit dose amount.  Such an adjustment mechanism may comprise an edge for removing fine powder extending above the chamber. In one embodiment, the adjustment mechanism comprises a thin plate having an aperture which may be aligned with the chamber during filling.  As the rotatable member is rotated, the edge of the aperture scrapes the excess powder from the chamber.<br>
In one part icular aspect, the vibratable element i ncludes a proj ecting member which is spaced above the distal end.  The projecting member serves as a leveller to level powder within the hopper as the vibratable element is trans1ated a 1ong t he hoppe r .<br>
In another aspect, a secondary hopper is provided to store the powder until de]ivered to the primary hopper.  A shaki nq mechanism is provided to vibrate the secondary hopper when powder is to be transferred to the primary hopper. Preferably, the powder passes down a chute so that the powder may be   transferred without interfering with the translation of the vi bratable member along the primary hopper,<br><br>
In still another aspect, the chamber is formed in a change tool.  In this way, the size of the chamber may be varied simply by attaching a change tool with a different sized chamber to the rotatable member.<br>
The invention further provides an exemplary system for transporting fine powders.  The system comprises a plvrrality of rotatable members which each include a row of chambers.  A hopper is disposed above each rotatable member and has an opening to allow powder to be transferred to the chambers.  A vibratable element is disposed in each hopper, and vibrators are provided to vibrate the elements in an up and down motion.  A translation mechanism is further provided to translate the vibratable members along the hoppers to assist in transferring the powder from the hoppers and into the chambers.  Conveniently, a controller may be provided to control operation of the rotatable members, the vibrators, and the translation mechanism.<br>
