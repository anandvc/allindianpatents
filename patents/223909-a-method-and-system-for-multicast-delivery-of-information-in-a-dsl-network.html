				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to network communications and,<br>
more particularly, to a method of ATM multicast distribution at an ATM network<br>
layer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Changing communications demands are transforming the existing public<br>
information network from one limited to voice, text and low resolution graphics<br>
to bringing multimedia, including full motion video, to everyone's home. A key<br>
communications transmission technology that is enabling transformation of<br>
existing public information networks to accommodate higher bandwidth needs is<br>
Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), a modem technology. ADSL converts<br>
existing twisted-pair telephone lines into access paths for multimedia and high-<br>
speed data communications. ADSL can transmit up to 8 Mbps (Megabits per<br>
second) to a subscriber, and as much as 960 kbps (kilobits per second) or more<br>
in both directions. Such rates expand existing access capacity by a factor of 50<br>
or more without new cable installations.<br>
Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line ADSL technology involves modems<br>
attached across twisted pair copper wiring in which transmission rates can be up<br>
to 8 Mbps downstream (to the subscriber) and from 16 kbps to 960 kbps<br>
upstream (from the subscriber), depending on line distance, can be achieved.<br>
Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM is an ultra high-speed cell based data<br>
transmission protocol that may be run over ADSL. A Digital Subscriber Line<br>
Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) is a device that takes a number of ADSL subscriber<br>
lines and concentrates them to a single ATM line. Plain old telephone service<br>
POTS refers to basic analog telephone service. POTS takes the lowest 4 kHz<br>
bandwidth on twisted pair wiring. Any server sharing a line with POTS must<br>
either use frequencies above POTS or convert POTS to digital and interleave with<br>
other data signals.<br>
Audio, video and other information is increasingly being distributed over<br>
networks from a single source to multiple destination points on the network.<br>
Networks have finite bandwidth capacities associated with them. Sending<br>
multiple copies of the same information to multiple destinations can become<br>
demanding on the network and does not constitute an efficient use of resources.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for implementing a multicast delivery service<br>
in a DSL network to make efficient use of the network.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method that provides for multicast delivery of information in a DSL<br>
network includes creating transmission paths between a single source port and<br>
multiple destination ports in a DSL network; receiving information at the source<br>
port; determining which of the destination ports is to receive the information;<br>
and distributing the information from the source port to selective ones of the<br>
destination ports based on the prior referencing step.<br>
A DSL system for providing multicast delivery of information includes<br>
an ATM network layer for sending information; a digital subscriber line access<br>
multiplexer (DSLAM) coupled to the ATM network layer for receiving the<br>
information; and a network control system for controlling selective multiplexing<br>
of the information through the digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a method of ATM multicasting at the ATM<br>
network layer in a DSLAM at the head-end network for the purpose of<br>
distributing information, such as real-time data, video or audio, to the customer<br>
premise equipment CPE. The ATM layer multicast delivery service enables a<br>
source to transmit ATM cells from a single point to multiple destinations (point-<br>
to-multipoint), rather than using traditional broadcast or uni-cast distribution<br>
methods. This can be viewed as an ATM virtual path/virtual circuit with a single<br>
source and multiple destinations. The ATM network layer will deliver the ATM<br>
cells (on a multicast basis) to the destination points specified in the ATM virtual<br>
path/virtual circuit connection profile. By implementing a multicast delivery<br>
service in a DSLAM at the head-end of a DSL network it is possible to make<br>
efficient use of network resources for the purpose of distributing audio, video<br>
and other information to the customer premise.<br>
A DSL system architecture 1 for integrating voice, data and video<br>
services, shown in Fig. 1, is presented as an exemplary DSL environment for<br>
employing the inventive method of enabling video phone communication and<br>
similar multimedia communication over a DSL link. Details of the individual block<br>
components making up the system architecture are known to skilled artisans,<br>
and will only be described in details sufficient for an understanding of the<br>
invention. The system block diagram 1 is composed of several functional blocks.<br>
The system domain is composed of Central Office (CO) Equipment 100 and<br>
Customer Premise Equipment (CPE). The component blocks within the system<br>
domain and their respective interfaces are: customer premise equipment (CPE),<br>
Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) 9, an ATM switch 2, an IP<br>
router 13 and DSL terminator 12, and a network control system (NCS) 11.<br>
The current customer premise equipment (CPE) 2 includes a DSL modem<br>
unit that interfaces with four separate analog telephones 3-6 over a plain old<br>
telephone service (POTS), a 10Base-T Ethernet connection to a PC desktop<br>
system 7, and an Ethernet or RS-422 connection to a set-top box with a decoder<br>
8 for connection to a television or video display 8'. From the customer's analog<br>
end, the CPE device 2 accepts the analog input from each of the telephones 3-6,<br>
converts the analog input to digital data, and packages the data into ATM<br>
packets (POTS over ATM), with each connection having a unique virtual channel<br>
identifier/virtual path identifier (VPI/PCI). Known to skilled artisans, ATM is a<br>
connection oriented protocol and as such there is a connection identifier in every<br>
cell header which explicitly associates a cell with a given virtual channel on a<br>
physical link. The connection identifier consists of two sub-fields, the virtual<br>
channel identifier (VCI) and the virtual path identifier (VPI). Together these<br>
identifiers are used at multiplexing, de-multiplexing and switching a cell through<br>
the network. VCIs and VPIs are not addresses, but are explicitly assigned at<br>
each segment link between ATM nodes of a connection when a connection is<br>
established, and remain for the duration of the connection. When using the<br>
VCI/VPI, the ATM layer can asynchronously interleave (multiplex) cells from<br>
multiple connections.<br>
The Ethernet data is also encapsulated into ATM cells with a unique<br>
VPI/VCI. The ATM cell stream is sent to the DSL modem to be modulated and<br>
delivered to the DSLAM unit 9.<br>
Going in the other direction, the DSL signal is received and demodulated<br>
by the DSL modem in the customer premise equipment 2 and delivered to<br>
VPI/VCI detection processing. The ATM cell data with VPI/VCI matching that of<br>
the end user's telephone is then extracted and converted to analog POTS to be<br>
delivered to the telephone. The ATM cell data with VPI/VCI matching that of the<br>
end user's Ethernet is extracted and delivered to an Ethernet transceiver for<br>
delivery to the port.<br>
The Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer DSLAM 9 demodulates<br>
data from multiple DSL modems and concentrates the data onto the ATM<br>
backbone network for connection to the rest of the network. That DSLAM<br>
provides back-haul services for package, cell, and/or circuit based applications<br>
through concentration of the DSL lines onto ATM outputs to the ATM switch 10.<br>
The ATM switch 10 is the backbone of the ATM network. The ATM<br>
switch 10 performs various functions in the network, including cell transport,<br>
multiplexing and concentration, traffic control and ATM-layer management. Of<br>
particular interest in the system domain 100, the ATM switch provides for the<br>
cell routing and buffering in connection to the DSLAM, network control system<br>
11 and the Internet gateway (Internet Protocol IP router 13 and DSL terminator<br>
12), and T.1 circuit emulation support in connection with the multiple telephony<br>
links switch 15. A T1 circuit provides 24 voice channels packed into a 193 bit<br>
frame transmitted at 8000 frames per second. The total bit rate is 1.544 Mbps.<br>
The unframed version, or payload, consists of 192 bit frames for a total rate of<br>
1.536 Mbps.<br>
The ATM switch 10 is shown coupled to a program guide server/video<br>
server 16 to satellite 17, radio broadcast 18 or cable 19 networks. The ATM<br>
switch 10 is also coupled over the DSL terminator 12 and IP router 13 pair to<br>
receive Internet Protocol IP packet data from the Internet 14.<br>
The network control system 100 provides for address translation, demand<br>
assignment and call management functions. The Network Control System's<br>
principle function is to manage the DSL/ATM network including the origination<br>
and termination of phone calls. The NCS is essentially the control entity<br>
communicating and translating control information between the class 5 PSTN<br>
switch (using the GR-303 protocol) and the CPE. The network control system<br>
100 is available for other functions such as downloadable code to the CPE, and<br>
bandwidth and call management (e.g., busy) functions, as well as other service<br>
provisioning and set up tasks.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 2, the block diagram 20 illustrates ATM multicasting<br>
at the ATM layer at the head-end of the network for the purposes of distributing<br>
audio, video and other information to the customer premises equipment CPE.<br>
Multicasting is an efficient method of data delivery that simultaneously sends<br>
information to a group of interested destination points. Networks have finite<br>
bandwidth capacities. Sending multiple copies of the same information to<br>
multiple destinations can become demanding on the network and does not<br>
constitute an efficient use of resources.<br>
The DSLAM of FIG. 2 is configured with an ATM trunk port 21 and<br>
multiple destination ports 22-28. The ATM trunk port 21 is a single virtual<br>
path/virtual channel, illustratively assigned a VPI of 39 and a VCI of 12. In this<br>
exemplary ATM multicast/point-to-multipoint distribution information is delivered<br>
from the ATM trunk port 21 to multipoint destinations: ADSL port 1 22, ADSL<br>
port 2 23, ADSL port 4 25 and ADSL port N 28. ADSL port 1 22 is assigned<br>
a VPI of 36 and VCI of 21. ADSL port 2 23 is assigned a VPI of 36 and VCI of<br>
20. ADSL port 4 25 is assigned a VPI of 45 and VCI of 9. ADSL port N is<br>
assigned a VPI of 37 and a VCI of 4.<br>
ATM multicasting can be done at the ATM network layer. The ATM<br>
network layer is responsible for cell header generation and extraction, cell<br>
VPI/VCI translation and cell multiplexing and de-multiplexing. When a cell arrives<br>
at the trunk port it is identified as a channel of video or other information. This<br>
is based upon the arrived cell's VPI/VCI pair indicated in the cell header, which is<br>
a relationship known by the network control system. A connection profile can<br>
be referenced to find the subscribers to this particular ATM virtual circuit. Based<br>
upon the connection profile, ATM cells can be duplicated to the group of<br>
customers subscribing to this channel.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an example of a multimedia setup request to network to join<br>
a point-to multipoint ATM virtual circuit.<br>
The Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) sends a request to the network<br>
for a multimedia program on an ATM signaling virtual circuit (1, FIG.3). The<br>
message is sent to the ATM switch based on the ATM signaling virtual circuit (2,<br>
FIG.3). The message is sent to the Network Control System (NCS) based on the<br>
ATM signaling virtual circuit (3, FIG. 3). The Network Control System (NCS)<br>
determines if the request is valid (4, FIG.3). If it is a valid request, it sends a<br>
request to the Multimedia server for the CPE to join/build a multicast/point-to-<br>
multipoint ATM virtual circuit for the selected channel (5, FIG.3). The Network<br>
Control System (NCS) sends a request to the ATM switch for the CPE to join a<br>
multicast/point-to-multipoint ATM virtual circuit for the selected channel (6, FIG.<br>
3). The Network Control System (NCS) sends a request to the Digital Subscriber<br>
Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) for the CPE to join a multicast/point-to-<br>
multipoint ATM virtual circuit for the selected channel (7, FIG. 3). Once this<br>
connection has been made, the multimedia information will flow to one or more<br>
CPE end-nodes (8, FIG. 3).<br>
In order to provide support for the delivery of multimedia services in a DSL<br>
network, an economies of scale needs to be achieved for the service provider in<br>
order to cost effectively deliver these services to the end user. This economies<br>
of scale can be achieved by efficiently using network resources during the<br>
delivery of this multimedia information to the end user. In order to efficiently<br>
deliver multimedia to the end user a concept known as multicast can be<br>
employed in the network. The basic principle of multicast is the delivery of a<br>
single stream of information to many while efficiently using the resources of the<br>
network. It efficiently uses the resources of the network by having the server<br>
only send a single copy of the multimedia program and having downstream<br>
intermediate nodes replicate this program until it reaches the necessary end<br>
users. Broadcasting is ineffective at providing this, unless every end user is<br>
requesting the multimedia.<br>
The ideal place for effective multicasting is at the edge of the network.<br>
The edge device in a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) network is the Digital<br>
Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM). The DSLAM shall have the<br>
capabilities of setting up point-to-multipoint connections at the ATM layer (i.e., a<br>
multicast connection). By having this function, the DSLAM can replicate data<br>
and send it to multiple subscribers on different ports.<br>
The uniqueness of this invention is the method by which the<br>
multicast/point-to-multipoint ATM virtual circuits are set up for the delivery of<br>
information to the end user. Also, that the system provides the control for the<br>
multicast/point-to-multipoint delivery of information to the end user.<br>
Although the embodiment which incorporates the teachings of the present<br>
invention has been shown and described in detail herein, those skilled in the art<br>
can readily devise many other varied embodiments that still incorporate these<br>
teachings.<br>
