				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing of fibre by<br>
selectively removing foreign parts with the cleaning device of a textile<br>
machine.<br>
The Patent Application No. 10 6187 890 included a system for recognition<br>
of foreign parts in an opening machine. The foreign parts (impurities) are<br>
detected with the help of sensor which control an opening roll axis<br>
parallelly. If the foreign parts are detected with the help of the sensors and<br>
the evaluating electronic, then one of the valves coupled at the outlet side<br>
(subsequently switched on) to the opening machine is automatically<br>
controlled and the impurities are removed with good fibres. It is<br>
disadvantageous in this regard that relatively many good fibres are removed<br>
with the impurities. A machine OP TISCAN, which is described in the DE-<br>
43 30 173, has received widest possible acceptance in the textile industry.<br>
Especially since only at the positions, through the width, the fibres are<br>
removed at which the impurities are detected.<br>
The task of the invention is, to arrange for a removing device which is very<br>
simple and which reacts very quickly, which renders it possible to eliminate<br>
the impurities selectively an an opening roll. The elimination takes place in<br>
the zones arranged axis parallelly to the rolls. These zones correspond with<br>
the identification (recognition) spheres which seen in the flow of the<br>
material are pre-supported in these zones (extended in front of these zones).<br>
If a foreign part is recognised in one of the recognition zones, which is<br>
transported from the opening roll at the circumference of the roll, there takes<br>
place a signal towards removal in the corresponding zones. The<br>
corresponding removal segment can be found at the same opening (aperture)<br>
roll a little later in the material flow, or an opening roll which directly takes<br>
over the fibres from the opening roll or takes over the fibres material through<br>
one or several intermediate rolls from the opening roll, at which the fibres<br>
are controlled. The removal takes place with the help of the generation of an<br>
air accumulation before an eliminating blade or an eliminating edge.<br>
Towards clarification of the process the air conditions at an opening roll are<br>
depicted in a simple manner. The opening roll is provided with lathe carrier<br>
centre at the circumference. These centres pull the fibre along with. An air<br>
film rotates with the opening roll at the surface along with. Towards<br>
mechanical elimination of impurities one or several 'blades' are arranged in<br>
the short distance from the surface. Large parts cannot pass through between<br>
the blade and the roll surface and are elim inated at the blade border. Also no<br>
parts, which exist in the periphery of the air film rotating with the roll, are<br>
eliminated. In order to hold air film and thereby the fibres at the opening<br>
rolls, it is, however, necessary to lead the air film at the roll surface with the<br>
help of the baffle plate. The distance between the baffle plate and the<br>
opening roll, at the point, at which the baffle plate ends before the next<br>
blade, determines how thick the air film around the roll before the next blade<br>
is. If the air film is very thick in comparison to the gap, which the blade has<br>
for the surface, then much material is eliminated. This is distinctly described<br>
in the EP 0110017. This knowledge on the air condition at the aperture<br>
(opening) roll is basic for the Invention. The selective elimination through<br>
generation of a partial " air accummulation" before an eliminating blade or<br>
before an eliminating edge takes place according to the Invention. The fibre<br>
material with the foreign part (impurity) is lifted from the centres (T) of the<br>
opening roll with the help of the "air accummulation" and are eliminated at<br>
the subsequent blade. The Invention is clarified in the following on the basis<br>
of accompanying diagrams.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the manner of operation of a cleaning machine for textile.<br>
Through feed roll(l) fibre material arrive at an opening roll(2). The material<br>
at the blades(3) is led by with the help of the opening roll. In order to hold<br>
the air cover( shield) on the drum rotating along with, baffle plates(4) are<br>
provided with. An arrangement(5) serves the purpose of optical recognition<br>
of impurities in the fibre flakes. The fibres are lifted at the end of then-<br>
rotation by an air flow (6) from the fitting or with the help of an air-<br>
accummulation at the stripper blade(7) separated from the roll and leave the<br>
cleaning machine through a suction funnel(8). The eliminated parts arrive in<br>
a collection chamber(9) and are conveyed by a suction device 10) from the<br>
cleaning machine.<br>
The following figures show executions for generation of an " air<br>
accummutation" before an eliminating blade as section of Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the opening rolls, a blade(3), a baffle plate(4) and a blade(3)<br>
following the baffle plate. In order to generate an air-accum mutation (11)<br>
before the blade(3) additional air is blown through the nozzles(l2) between<br>
the open space between the baffle plate(4) and the blade(3).<br>
The additional volume of air cannot pass-through between the blade and<br>
the opening roll. The air accum mutates (pile up) before the blade. The air<br>
film rotating along with the drum is disturbed and the eddy convey fibres<br>
and impurities from the surface of the roll away. Fibres and impurities are<br>
further obstructed by the blade(3) from rotating further along with the drum.<br>
The nozzles stretch themselves in around axis parallel to the surface of the<br>
roll. These are controlled and actuated selectively, corresponding with the<br>
impurities recognised through sensors in the zones arranged, with the help of<br>
the magnet valve(3). The fibres and the impurities eliminated with the help<br>
of the air accummulation and air turbulence react to the waste chamber(9)<br>
and are there sucked-off.<br>
It is also conceivable to supply (feed) the additional air in the sphere of<br>
the baffle plate.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the formation of the air accummulation through nozzles<br>
which before the chopping-off blade<br>
Fig. 4 shows an arrangement of nozzles, at which the nozzles are<br>
arranged behind the eliminating blade(3) and blow through between blade<br>
and rolls opposite to the direction of rotation, in order to effect the<br>
accummulation of air before the blade border. The control of the nozzles<br>
takes place as shown in Fig.(2).<br>
Fig. 5 shows a further form for generation of air accumulation before<br>
the chopping-off blade(4). The end of the baffle plate (4) situated before the<br>
elimination blade(3) is supported around a hinge-joint(14) and is moved with<br>
the help of an actuating element(l6), for example, a pneumatic cylinder or a<br>
magnet.<br>
If a foreign part is recognized upstream, the actuating element swings<br>
away the end of the baffle plate from the circumference of the opening rolls.<br>
The rotating air film follows the baffle plate and tries to fill-up the space<br>
originating between the horizontally swivelled baffle plate and the surface.<br>
The air film separates itself from the roll surface and pile up<br>
(accummulates) itself before the blade. Fibres and impurities lilt off from<br>
top of the opening roll and cannot be drawn through any more through<br>
narrow slot between the blade and roll surface. They are eliminated<br>
(chopped off).<br>
Several sectors of the baffle plates to be actuated are arranged through the<br>
width of the opening rolls axis parallelly, which correspond with the<br>
identifying sensors.<br>
Figs. 6 &amp; Fig. 7 show the generation of an air accummulation through<br>
change of the geometry of the eliminating blade(3). The eliminating blades<br>
stand normally in a flat angle to the surface of the roll. Lifting borders as<br>
represented under Fig. 1.7 stand in an angle of 90° to the roll surface.In<br>
order to generate an air accummuiation. the geometry of the eliminating<br>
blade is changed to around 90° . This takes place in Fig. 6 with the help of<br>
shifting of a block (16) parallel to the front of the blade. The block travels<br>
somehow compactly up to the blade tip and builds a chopping border of<br>
around 90° . The actuation of the block can take place pneumatically or<br>
electrically and obviously section-wise.<br>
Fig. 7 shows, how the air accummulation can be effected through the<br>
swinging of the blade(3). The blade is swung by its normal flat angle around<br>
a rotating point at the knife pinch so that an angle of around 90° builds to<br>
the roll surface. The swinging can be effected with the help of pneumatic<br>
cylinder. With the help of the generation of an air-accumm illation before an<br>
eliminating blade it is possible to eliminate simple impurities selectively at<br>
an opening roll.<br>
