colors. More particularly the present invention relates to a new method for data<br>
/<br>
representation wherein digital data or digital information strings of O's and 1's are<br>
divided  into  groups of sequential  bits of predefined  length and  represented by<br>
predefined color assigned that is printed on a suitable printable medium,<br>
Background and Prior art<br>
The digital data for computer related applications have been represented on<br>
paper tapes, magnetic storage devices, optical storage devices, semiconductor storage<br>
devices, and Magneto-optical disc storage devices in the form of binary data. The<br>
development has been primarily focussed on achieving progressively higher densities<br>
for higher volumes, flexibility, portability, etc. The format used in all these applications<br>
is the binary format.<br>
Deficiencies or drawbacks in the existing art<br>
The formats in use cover holes (paper tapes), tracks for magnetic tapes, ASCII<br>
for standard keyboard, audio/video; etc. aimed at packaging digital strings for higher<br>
volume of storage. The end format remains in the binary form of O's and 1's. The<br>
density of storage progressed in various forms from paper tapes, magnetic, optical etc.<br>
but mainly limited by boundaries of physics.<br>
The present invention provides a new. method of digital data representation<br>
using colors which has scope of applications in smart card, security tags, authentication<br>
of currency notes, storage devices, etc.<br>
The technological advancement in handling of color medium in future will<br>
enhance the range of advantages of this invention in terms of volume, durability,<br>
flexibility, portability, economy etc. and also towards primary storage.<br>

Detailed description<br>
Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiments are provided herein; however, it<br>
is to be understood ,that the present invention may be embodied in various forms.<br>
Therefore, specific 'details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but<br>
rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in<br>
the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system,<br>
structure or matter.<br>
In the computer related applications the data is represented and processed in digital<br>
form. The digital data consists of O's and 1 's. In existing storage devices the digital data<br>
is stored on hardware by representing O's and l!s pits and without pits and polarity in<br>
case of CDs and magnetic medium respectively.<br>
According to the present invention, the digital data is encoded by converting it<br>
into pre-defined strings and assigning a pre-defined standard color corresponding to a<br>
sequence of bits and is stored on a printable media using a printer. The color is<br>
represented with its code value. For example in an 8-bit color the black value is<br>
represented by decimal value 0 and pure white is represented by decimal value 256.<br>
The encoded strings are assigned to the values of the color. The standard printer prints<br>
the pre-defined encoded strings, which are assigned a pre-defined standard color, on the<br>
standard printable medium in the form of a color pixel.<br>
Further, in the encoding stage the error detecting and correcting algorithms for<br>
example Reed-Solomon codes maybe used to.jncrease the reliability of the system for<br>
storing data.<br>
According to the present invention the standard printable media include paper,<br>
photo-paper, plastic, etc.<br>
4<br>
 <br>
According to the present invention, a standard scanner is used to record the<br>
color of the pixel printed on to the printable medium. In the scanner the image or pixels<br>
are retrieved and the process is reversed. At the data sink where the data is retrieved the<br>
color value is taken and'decoded to predefined string, which is assigned to the color<br>
corresponding to a sequence of bits.<br>
According to the present invention, the printer and the scanner have to be<br>
compatible. For example if the printer resolution is 300 dots per square inch, the<br>
scanner resolution should be equal or more than 300 dots per square inch.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the digital data is<br>
encoded by converting it into pre-defined encoded strings and assigning a pre-defined<br>
standard color in a color range and is stored on a printable media using a printer. For<br>
example in an 8-bit gray level green color, the range of green shades is represented by<br>
decimal values ranging from green 0 to green 256. The predefined range of green gray<br>
level is assigned to the same encoded string.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the digital data is encoded by<br>
converting it into predefined encoded strings and assigning a predefined standard color<br>
combination and is stored on a printable media using a printer. The colors in the color<br>
combinations are represented with its code value. For example in an 8-bit color the<br>
black value is represented by decimal value 0 and pure white is represented by decimal<br>
value 256. The encoded strings are assigned to the values of the color of the color<br>
combinations.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the digital data is encoded<br>
by converting it into predefined encoded strings and assigning a predefined standard<br>
color in a color range and their combination and is stored on a printable media using a<br>
printer. The colors in the color range combinations are represented with its code value.<br>
The encoded strings are assigned to the values of the color in the color range and their<br>
combinations.<br>
5<br>
 <br>
According to the present invention a unique color or a set of colors is used as<br>
the background with no string assigned to it as a reference to detect the memory space<br>
on the printable media. For example, black is used as a background covering the space<br>
of the digital data represented in form of color pixels to be printed. The color black will<br>
not be used to represent the predefined string of the data. It provides a reference of the<br>
memory space used.<br>
Brief description of drawings<br>
The digital data at source (1) is encoded and represented using pre-defined color<br>
(2); the encoded digital data strings are printed by a printer (3) in the form of color pixels<br>
on a standard printable medium (4); the color of the pixels printed on the printable<br>
medium is scanned by a scanner (5); the scanned pixeJ is decoded (6) and displayed at the<br>
data sink (7).<br>
Advantages of the present invention<br>
•	The  present  invention  is  performed  on  digital  data  bits  hence  is  easily<br>
compatible with computer related applications.<br>
•	As the predefined encoded digital strings are represented by pixels the storage<br>
space required reduces.<br>
•	As each color pixel represents a predefined length accessing the pixels gives the<br>
entire string length thus reducing the access time.<br>
Although the invention has been. described with reference to specific<br>
embodiments, this description is not meant to be constructed in a limiting sense.<br>
Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments, as well as alternate embodiments<br>
of the invention, will become apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the<br>
description of the invention. It is therefore contemplated that such modifications will be<br>
made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention as defined.<br>
6<br>
 <br>
The invention will now be illustrated with the help of the following non-limiting<br>
examples.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
Digital data of O's and l:s where the digital data string is divided as pre-defined<br>
as shown in the table. In this example the binary string is divided into 4 bits each as<br>
there are 16 colors available.<br>
The encoded strings will have combinations as shown in table 1<br>
Table 1:<br>
1)	0000	color 1<br>
2)	0001	color 2<br>
3)	0010	color 3<br>
4)	0011	color 4<br>
5)	0100	color 5<br>
6)	0101	color 6<br>
7)	0110	color 7<br>
8)	0111	color 8<br>
9)	1000	color 9<br>
10)	1001	color 10<br>
11)	1010	color 11<br>
12)	1011	color 12<br>
13)	1100	color 13<br>
14)	1101	color 14<br>
15)	1110	color 15<br>
16)	1111	color 16<br>
7<br>
Now let's consider digital data in form of O's and Ps<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Dividing above string into 4 bits<br>
0001 1010 1000 1010 1010 1010 10000001 1111 1131 1111 1101<br>
Now each sequence is encoded by dividing the string into sub strings of size<br>
four and assigned a color pixel as shown in the table predefined. The above string in the<br>
example consists of 48 digital bits of Os and Is. Four bits are divided and color pixel is<br>
assigned as predefined as per table. Now the entire digital data in the example is<br>
represented with 12 color pixels.<br>
Using colors according to the above table 1 each for the above sixteen<br>
sequential strings in digital data are divided and represented on standard printable<br>
medium.<br>
Therefore forty-eight bits are being represented by twelve colors pixels on the<br>
standard printable medium.<br>
When the optical scanner scans the ] 2 color pixels represented on the standard<br>
printable medium in the above example, each color pixel is represented by the digital<br>
sequence assigned before.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
A color range is a set of predefined color values. For example dividing an 8 bit<br>
gray level green color (from dark to light). Taking green 0 to green 128 as one string<br>
value and taking green 129 to green 256 as one-value, i.e. assigning a common encoded<br>
string to the first range and other encoded string to the colors "falling in second range.<br>
While retrieving the data, the optical scanner scans the pixels and the strings of encoded<br>
digital data are retrieved when the scanned pixel color falls into the predefined range.<br>
For example in the digital data of O's and 1 's the strings are divided into certain<br>
strings.<br>
8<br>
 <br>
In this example the binary string is divided into 4 bits each. The strings will<br>
have combinations as shown in table 2<br>
Table 2<br>
1)	0000     color range 1<br>
2)	0001     color range 2<br>
3)	0010     color range 3<br>
4)	0011     co lor range 4<br>
5)	0100     color range 5<br>
6)	0101     col or range 6<br>
7)	0110    color range 7<br>
8)	0111     color range 8<br>
9)	1000    color range 9<br>
10)	1001     color range 10<br>
11)	1010     color range 11<br>
12)	1011     color range 12<br>
13)	1100     color range 13<br>
14)	1101     color range 14<br>
15)	1110     color range 15<br>
16)	1111     color range 16<br>
In the following example the digital data is in the form of 0?s and 1 's<br>
 <br>
The above string is divided into 4 bits<br>
 <br>
The above 4*12=48 bits are represented using only 12 color pixels with the<br>
color corresponding in the predefine color range.<br>
9<br>
 <br>
Using colors according to the above table  1  each for the above sixteen<br>
sequential strings in digital data are divided and represented on hardware by sixteen<br>
different colors. Therefore twelve colors pixels on hardware are representing 48 bits.<br>
<br>
When the' optical scanner scans the 12 color pixels represented on the<br>
hardware medium in the above example each color pixel is represented by the digital<br>
sequence assigned before the color that is represented on the media after being assigned<br>
using printer. The scanner takes that color value and assigns the particular string if the<br>
color is present in the range. This reduces the error caused due to inefficiency of the<br>
printer to represent the assigned value. For example if a dark red color pixel has to be<br>
printed by the printer it is able to represent relatively brighter pixel. When range is<br>
taken instead of a particular color the error caused due to inefficiency of the printer and<br>
scanner will be reduced to great extent.<br>
Less color ranges can be taken which the printer supports. For example eight<br>
colors in the color range can be used in above example instead of 16 colors in the color<br>
ranges. But the compression is less as only three bits can be represented by each color<br>
in a color range.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
The groups of predefined encoded sequential strings are represented by color<br>
combinations.<br>
In this example the binary string is divided into 4 bits with two color<br>
combinations. Each color is two in this case.<br>
The strings will have combinations as shown in table 3<br>
Table 3<br>
1)	0000     color 1 color 1<br>
2)	0001     color 1 color 2<br>
10<br>
 <br>
3)	0010	color 1 color 3<br>
4)	00 11	color 1 color 4<br>
5)	0100	color 2 color 1<br>
6)	0101	color 2 color 2<br>
7)	01 10	co lor 2 color 3<br>
8)	01 11	color 2 color 4<br>
9)	1000	color 3 color 1<br>
10)	1001	color 3 color 2<br>
11)	1010	color 3 color 3<br>
12)	1011	color 3 color 4<br>
13)	1100	color 4 color 1<br>
14)	1101	color 4 color 2<br>
15)	11 10	color 4 color 3<br>
16)	11 11	color 4 color 4<br>
Now let's consider digital data in form of O's and 1's<br>
000110101000101010101010100000011111 111 111111101<br>
Dividing above string into two two bits.<br>
0001 1010100010 10 101010 1010000001 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 01<br>
The above 48 bits sequences in the example are represented by 24 color pixels.<br>
Using colors according to the above table 1 each for the above sixteen<br>
sequential strings in digital data are divided and represented on hardware by<br>
combination of two pixels with four different colors. Therefore 48 bits are being<br>
represented by twenty-four pixels on standard printable media.<br>
When the optical scanner scans the 24 color pixels represented on the hardware<br>
medium in the above example, each color pixel combination is represented by the<br>
digital sequence assigned before.<br>
11<br>
 <br>
Embodiment 4<br>
Each group of sequential bits is represented by a predefined color ranges with<br>
and the combinations are printed on the standard printable medium.<br>
While scanning the particular string value is represented by combination of<br>
color pixels and their ranges, which are printed on the standard printable medium.<br>
For example in the digital data of 0:s and 1's. the strings are divided into certain<br>
strings.<br>
In this example the binary string is divided  into 4 • bits with two color<br>
combinations, Each color is two in this case.<br>
The strings will have combinations as shown in table 3<br>
Table 3<br>
1)	0000	color range 1 color range 1<br>

The above 2*24=48 bits are represented using only 4 colors ranges with two color<br>
range combinations in form of pixels. The 48 bits are represented with only 24 pixels,<br>
Using colors according to the above table 1 each for the above sixteen<br>
