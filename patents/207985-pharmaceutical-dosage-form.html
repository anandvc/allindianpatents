				<td>	PHARMACEUTICAL      DOSAGE FORM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention concerns a pharmaceutical dosage form consisting of a double capsule for the administration of active principles in multiple therapies. The double capsule consists in a capsule placed inside another one.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therapies for the administration of more than one active principle at a time or at short intervals of time are already well known. The most common pharmaceutical dosage form consists of tablets for the various active principles with coatings allowing the differentiated release of the chemical compounds.<br>
Among said therapies, the most common ones are those concerning affections of the digestive system caused by the presence of the microorganisms Helicobacter Pylori, such as gastritis and gastroduodenal ulcers, which in due time can lead to tumoral forms. As known, Helicobacter pylori is a modern appellation of Campilobacter pylon.<br>
Patent US-5 196 205 (corresponding to patent application WO 89/03219) describes a method for the treatment of those pathological agents, consisting of the administration of a compound of bismuth, an antibiotic belonging to the group of penicillins and tetracycline and a second antibiotic such as metronidazole. The relevant therapy consists of the administration of three tablets (one for each active principle) several times a day.<br><br><br>
¦ o<br>
2<br>
Consequently, this therapy results in being extremely complicated.The therapy descnbed by patent US-5 196 205 has been further modified by the addition of a fourth active principle, omeprazole which reduces the gastnc secretion by inhibiting irreversibly enzyme H +/K + ATP. Omeprazole must be administered at a different time from the above-mentioned active principles, which are determined by the physician according to the seriousness of the disease, the age of the patient and other factors which could affect its efficacy.<br>
Therefore, it can certainly be stated that therapies requiring a complicated posology such as multiple therapies, are subject to mistakes that can compromise the outcome of the therapy itself<br>
Other patents and patent applications describing single or multiple therapies for eradication of Helicobacter pylori are known such as US-5 472 695, US-5 560 912, US-5 582 837, WO 92/11848 and WO 96/02237 None of these previous patents and patent applications overcome the problem of the interaction between active principles by using a way as simple and ingenious than the one proposed by the present invention.<br>

The characteristics and advantages of the invention will be better understood after reading the following non restrictive description.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Double Capsule<br>
The present invention provides a pharmaceutical dosage form for the administration of active principles in multiple therapies featured by the presence of two capsules one placed inside the other and including respectively one or more active principles. This pharmaceutical dosage form is called double capsule and the two capsules are respectively called internal capsule and external capsule.<br>
Both internal and external capsules are preferably made of hard gelatin. If desired, the internal capsule may be made of gelatin treated so as to make it gastro-resistant or slow release.<br>
The capsules already on the market are identified by numbers or letters according to their size (length, diameter and thickness), as indicated in Table 1 (CAPSUGEL MULTISTATE FILE, 2° Ed.)<br><br>
5 TABLE 1:    SIZE OF THE JELLY CAPSULES<br><br>
Accordingly to the invention, the double capsule has an internal capsule smaller than the external one, since according to this principle all the combinations of the Table 1 are possible except for the combination of external capsule of format 0+ with internal capsule of format A or 0 of any types of capsules. Such combinations are chosen to facilitate the use for the patient and according to the quantity of substance to be introduced into the two capsules. As a matter of fact, the volume between the two capsules and the volume of the internal capsule should be suitable to allow the insertion of the quantities foreseen by the therapeutic dosage. The internal capsule should preferably be a 2 or 3 format, while the external capsule should be respectively a 0+ or 1 format<br><br>
6<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, an internal capsule of format 3 is inserted in an external capsule of format 0<br>
Said pharmaceutical form is realised by means of an intermittent or continuous motion capsule filling machine equipped with dosators to feed empty capsules with powders, tablets, pellets or filled capsules. Exemples of said capsule filling machines are the Zanazi 40 of the company IMA in Bologna and the model MG Futura level 02 of the company MG2 in Bologna. As an alternative, the new double capsule can be realised by means of a manual machine type Zuma 150 or 300 and type Parke-Davis/Capsugel.<br>
Besides, it must be taken into consideration that even the movement of the capsules caused by the capsule filling machines, either automatic or manual, and the simple act of inserting the internal capsule are enough to form between the two capsules a layer of powder which keeps them separated.<br>
Triple Therapy<br>
This pharmaceutical dosage form is particularly suitable to be used in a triple therapy for the eradication of the pathologic agents Hehcobacter pylon (aiso known as Campilobacter pylon), consisting of the administration of three active principles which are a soluble salt of bismuth, a first antibiotic and a second antibiotic. Each internal and external capsule contains one or more active principles.<br>
The bismuth salt is preferably selected from the group consisting of bismuth subcitrate, bismuth aluminate, bismuth carbonate, bismuth citrate, colloidal bismuth subnitrate, bismuth germanate, bismuth germanium oxide, bismuth nitrate, bismuth oxide, bismuth oxychlonde, bismuth phosphate, bismuth salicylate, bismuth subcarbonate, bismuth subnitrate, bismuth subsalicylate, bismuth tribromophenate, bismuth trioxyde, bismuth vanadate, and bismuth vanadium tetraoxide. Bismuth salts may be used in a complex form. For example, bismuth biscalcitrate is a complex form of bismuth subcitrate.<br>
The first antibiotic is selected from the group consisting of the nitroimidazoles.   The   nitroimidazoles   are   preferably   selected   from   the   group<br><br>
7<br>
consisting of metronidazole, apronidazole, azomycine, benzonidazole, carnidazole, demetridazole, etanidazole, flunidazole, misonidazole,  morazole, ornidazole, panidazole, ronidazole, and tinidazole. Preferably, the first antibiotic is metronidazole.<br>
The second antibiotic ts selected from the group consisting of the macrotides and the compounds of the family of tetracychnes The macrotides are preferably selected from the group consisting of azithrorrycine, clarithromycine and erythromyctne. The compounds of the family of tetracyclines are preferably selected from group consisting of tetracycline, chlortetracychne, doxycycline, glycocycline, guamecycline, lymecycline, methacycline and sancycline As known in the field, tetracycline correspond to tetracycline hydrochlonde<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the external capsule contains bismuth subcitrate and metronidazole, and the internal capsule contains tetracycline.<br>
When the external capsule, preferably containing bismuth subcitrate in a complex form and metronidazole, dissolves, it allows the complex bismuth to form a curative gel at the gastric level. After a certain period of time, according to the therapeutic indications, the internal capsule dissolves and releases tetracycline, which also acts at the gastric level.<br>
The triple therapy as described above, usually consists of the administration of two identical double capsules several times a day, with no particular care as to the sequence of consumption and of the manipulation of the said double capsules. Ingestion of capsules is preferably done before meals and before a snack at bedtime.<br>
Quadruple Therapy<br>
An further way of realisation of the invention consists of the administration of a fourth active principle such as a K*/Na + ATP-ase inhibitor or a anti-H2, together with the double capsule described above. In this case, the double capsule as foreseen by the invention will be destined to use in a quadruple therapy for the affections of the digestive system.  K + /Na + ATP-ase inhibitor or<br><br>
8<br>
anti-H2 is selected from group consisting of BY841, cimetidine; ebrotidine, etintidine; famotidine; flunarizme; ICl-162,846; lansoprazole, metiamide; mifentidine; niperotidine; nizatidine; omeprazoie; ox-netidine; pantoprazole, rabeprazole; ramixotidtne; ranitidine; ritansenn; roxatidire acetate hydrochlonde; ¦ ZKF-93479; SKF-94482; sufotidine, tiotidine, TY-11345; Wy-45,727; and zaltidme. Preferably, omeprazoie is used as K + /Na'ATP-ase inhibitor.<br>
The K + /Na + ATP-ase inhibitor or anti-H2 may be irtroduced m the external capsule, in the internal capsule or in a separate pharmaceutical form. Since it is a requirement that K + /Na + ATP-ase inhibitor or anti-H2 reach the small intestine, it may be delivered embedded in the gastroresistant coated pellets, multiple small tablets or single tablet. Considering that K + /Na + ATP-ase inhibitor or anti-H2 must be administered according to criteria other than those fo-eseen for triple therapy, double capsules without K*7Na + ATP-ase inhibitor or ann-H2 may be alternatively administered to double capsules containing K + /Na + ATP-ase inhibitors or anti-H2, following a therapeutic scheme prescribed by the physician, depending on the seriousness of the disease and the condition of the patient<br>
In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the invention, the external capsule contains bismuth subcitrate and metromdazole, and the internal capsule contains tetracyclme and omeprazoie.<br>
Characteristics of the Invention<br>
Preferably, both capsules contain excipients. These exciptents are selected from the group consisting of magnesium stearate, talc; cellulose and its derivatives; silica and its derivatives; sugars; polyethylene-glycols; wax; mono-, di- and tri-glycendes of hydrogenated fat acids; alcohols and acids at high molecular weight; and relevant mixtures thereof.<br>
Both internal and external capsule containing the active principles as described above are stable at a temperature comprised between 5 and 50°C and at a humidity comprised between 35 and 65%.<br><br>
Scope of the Invention<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention have beer described above for tripre therapy and quadruple therapy for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. Although these embodiments are preferred for such therapies, it should be understood that the double capsule may contain other active principles in accordance with the invention Thus, the combinations of active principles listed above in the background of the invention, may be used in the claimed pharmaceutical dosage form without departing from the scope of the claimed invention. For example, using the above listed combination no. 34, a' double capsule having an external capsule containing clarithromycine and an internal gastroresistant capsule containing pantoprazole would fall within the scope of the claimed invention<br>
The following are stabilisation and dissolution trials together with an example for the realisation of the double capsule as foreseen by the invention, for explanatory and not limitative purposes.<br>
Stability Trials<br>
Two products have been analysed, respectively a single capsule containing coated tetracycline hydrochloride, bismuth biscalcitrate, metronidazole and a double capsule as foreseen by the invention containing, in the internal capsule, non-coated  tetracycline and,  in the  external  capsule,   bismuth  btscaicitrate   and<br>
metronidazole.<br>
A sample for each product to be analysed has been incubated at room temperature, 37°C and 44°C for a period of 1 month At the time zero and at the end of the incubation period (1 month), an analysis of the macroscopic characteristics of the products under analysis has been performed.<br><br>

As it can be observed in Table 2, at the temperatures 37°C and 44°C, the content of the single coated capsule forms a beige-coloured product while the double   capsule  as  foreseen  by  the  invention   does  not  form   any   degradation<br><br>
	11	<br>
product.  This  effect  is  encouraged   by the  physical   barner  represented   by  the coating of the internal capsule which does not allow the cerflow of tetracycline.<br>
Dissolution Trials<br>
Five double capsules have been taken from one of the batches under examination, all five of them featured by the same characteristics:<br>
External capsule of format	0 +<br>
containing<br>
bismuth biscalcitrate	215 mg<br>
metronidazole	125 mg<br>
Internal capsule of format	3<br>
containing<br>
tetracyclme hydrochloride	125 mg<br>
The capsules have been analysed separately and under identical conditions according to the criteria of the Pharmacopoeia of the United States USP 23 Ed for the dissolution trial<br>
The purpose of the trial is to check if the exact quantity of tetracycline hydrochloride contained in the internal capsules dissolves (as indicated in the above Pharmacopoeia, which complies with all the other Pharmacopoeias). In this case, the presence of the external capsule and of its components should not affect the quantity of material under dissolution nor the time taken to release the active principle tetracycline hydrochloride.<br>
The quantity of material to be dissolved within 60 minutes must not be inferior to 80% of the quantity present in the capsule according to said limit, foreseen by the Pharmacopoeia<br>
As for the double capsules, the following percentage dissolution results have been obtained:<br>
Minimum value of dissolution 81,4% Maximum value of dissolution 107,9% Average value 100,0%<br><br>
	l2	<br>
RSD -9,7% {RSD = Relative Standard Dev.ation)<br>
From the results obtained, it is clear that the double capsule as described by the invention is in compliance with the foreseen dissolution characteristics<br>
Example 1<br>
Capsules of format 3 have been prepared with the following content.<br>
Tetracycline hydrochloride	125 mg<br>
Gastroprotected omeprazole	5 mg<br>
Magnesium stearate	5 mg<br>
Talc	5 mg<br>
Capsules of format 0+ have been prepared with the following content:<br>
Bismuth biscalcitrate	215 mg (corresponding to<br>
53,7 mg of Bismuth)<br>
Metronidazole	125 mg<br>
Magnesium stearate	5 mg<br>
Talc	5 mg<br>
The capsules 0+ have not been completely sealed, so that it will be possible to open them again with a manual machine (Zuma), and insert in the inside the capsule of format 3, previously prepared.<br>
The capsules have then been sealed and subjected to the controls concerning the disaggregation time, the average weight of the content, the sealing procedure, the assay of the single components and the microbiological purity, as foreseen in the Pharmacopoeia.<br>
Although preferred embodiments of the invention have been described in detail herein, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the precise embodiments and that various changes and modifications may be effected therein without departing from the scope or the spirit of the invention.<br><br>
