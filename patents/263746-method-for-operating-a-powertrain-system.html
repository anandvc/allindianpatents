				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DYNAMIC OUTPUT TORQUE<br>
LIMITING FOR A HYBRID POWERTRAIN SYSTEM<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/985,369, filed on 11/05/2007 which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	This disclosure pertains to control systems for hybrid<br>
powertrain systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art<br>
[0004] Known hybrid powertrain architectures can include multiple<br>
torque-generative devices, including internal combustion engines and non-<br>
combustion machines, e.g., electric machines, which transmit torque through a<br>
transmission device to an output member. One exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission which<br>
utilizes an input member for receiving tractive torque from a prime mover<br>
power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an output<br>
member. The output member can be operatively connected to a driveline for a<br>
motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Machines, operative as<br><br><br>
motors or generators, can generate torque inputs to the transmission<br>
independently of a torque input from the internal combustion engine. The<br>
machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy transmitted through the<br>
vehicle driveline to energy that is storable in an energy storage device. A<br>
control system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the operator and<br>
provides operational control of the hybrid powertrain, including controlling<br>
transmission operating state and gear shifting, controlling the torque-<br>
machines, and regulating the power interchange among the energy storage<br>
device and the machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including<br>
torque and rotational speed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] A powertrain system includes a hybrid transmission device<br>
operative to transfer power between an input member and torque machines<br>
and an output member in one of a plurality of operating range states. The<br>
torque machines are connected to an energy storage device. A method for<br>
operating the powertrain system includes determining a permissible range of<br>
input operating points to the input member, determining ranges of motor<br>
torques for the torque machines, determining an available power range from<br>
the energy storage device, selecting a candidate input operating point within<br>
the permissible range of input operating points, and determining maximum<br>
and minimum achievable output torques transferable to the output member for<br>
the candidate engine operating point within the ranges of motor torques for the<br>
torque machines and within the available power range from the energy storage<br>
device in a candidate operating range state.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0012] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary hybrid<br>
powertrain. The exemplary hybrid powertrain in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure is depicted in Fig. 1, comprising a two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical hybrid transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine<br>
14 and torque generating machines comprising first and second electric<br>
machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The engine 14 and first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 each generate mechanical power which can be<br><br><br>
transferred to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14 and<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transferred to the<br>
transmission 10 is described in terms of input and motor torques, referred to<br>
herein as TI TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as NI. NA.<br>
and NB, respectively.<br>
[0013] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transmit torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input member 12, and can be either a spark-ignition<br>
or a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) operatively coupled to the input member 12 of the transmission 10. A<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input member 12,<br>
Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and output<br>
torque, can differ from the input speed NI and the input torque TI to the<br>
transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the<br>
input member 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a<br>
hydraulic pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0014] The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets<br>
24, 26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transmitting devices,<br>
i.e., clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer<br>
to any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound<br>
plate clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module<br>
(hereafter 'TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and<br>
C4 75 preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches.<br>
Clutches C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled<br><br><br>
stationary devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68.<br>
Each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is preferably<br>
hydraulically applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0015] The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably<br>
comprise three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a<br>
rotor (not shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for<br>
each machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68. and<br>
includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom.<br>
The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that<br>
is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The<br>
rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft<br>
hub 66.<br>
[0016] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19 and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br><br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e.. NA and NB, respectively.<br>
[0017] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power to the driveline 90 that is transferred to vehicle wheels<br>
93, one of which is shown in Fig. 1. The output power at the output member<br>
64 is characterized in terms of an output rotational speed No and an output<br>
torque To- A transmission output speed sensor 84 monitors rotational speed<br>
and rotational direction of the output member 64. Each of the vehicle wheels<br>
93 is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted to monitor wheel speed,<br>
the output of which is monitored by a control module of a distributed control<br>
module system described with respect to Fig. 2, to determine vehicle speed.<br>
and absolute and relative wheel speeds for braking control, traction control<br>
and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0018] The input torque from the engine 14 and the motor torques from<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 (TI, TA, and TB respectively)<br>
are generated as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential<br>
stored in an electrical energy storage device (hereafter "ESD') 74. The ESD<br>
74 is high voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27.<br>
The transfer conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor<br>
switch 38 is closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between<br>
the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric<br>
current flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM<br>
19 transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by<br><br><br>
transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power<br>
to and from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31 to meet<br>
the torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in<br>
response to the motor torque commands TA and TB. Electrical current is<br>
transmitted to and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is<br>
being charged or discharged.<br>
[0019] The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the motor<br>
torque commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor<br>
drive or regeneration functionality to meet the commanded motor torques TA<br>
and TB. The power inverters comprise known complementary three-phase<br>
power electronics devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate<br>
bipolar transistors (not shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to<br>
AC power for powering respective ones of the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, by switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate<br>
bipolar transistors form a switch mode power supply configured to receive<br>
control commands. There is typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors for each phase of each of the three-phase electric machines. States<br>
of the insulated gate bipolar transistors are controlled to provide motor drive<br>
mechanical power generation or electric power regeneration functionality.<br>
The three-phase inverters receive or supply DC electric power via DC transfer<br>
conductors 27 and transform it to or from three-phase AC power, which is<br>
conducted to or from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 for<br>
operation as motors or generators via transfer conductors 29 and 31<br>
respectively.<br><br>
[0020] Fig. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control<br>
module system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an<br>
overall vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system controi of<br>
the exemplary hybrid powertrain described in Fig. 1. The distributed control<br>
module system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes<br>
algorithms to control various actuators to achieve control objectives, including<br>
objectives related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and<br>
protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes<br>
an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, a brake control module (hereafter<br>
'BrCM') 22, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control module (hereafter 'HCP') 5<br>
provides supervisory control and coordination of the ECM 23, the TCM 17,<br>
the BPCM 21, the BrCM 22 and the TPIM 19. A user interface ('UI') 13 is<br>
operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle<br>
operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP') from which<br>
an operator torque request is determined, an operator brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a<br>
transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a vehicle speed cruise control<br>
(not shown). The transmission gear selector 114 may have a discrete number<br>
of operator-selectable positions, including the rotational direction of the output<br>
member 64 to enable one of a forward and a reverse direction.<br>
[0021] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other<br>
control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter<br>
'LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states<br><br><br>
of operating parameters and actuator command signals between the various<br>
control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-<br>
specific. The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust<br>
messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned<br>
control modules, and other control modules providing functionality such as<br>
antilock braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple<br>
communications buses may be used to improve communications speed and<br>
provide some level of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication<br>
between individual control modules can also be effected using a direct link,<br>
e.g., a serial peripheral interface ('SPF) bus (not shown).<br>
[0022] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the hybrid powertrain.<br>
serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and<br>
BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and<br>
the hybrid powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 determines various<br>
commands, including: the operator torque request, an output torque command<br>
('Tocmd') to the driveline 90, an engine input torque command, clutch<br>
torque(s) ('TCL') for the applied torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62. C3 73,<br>
C4 75 of the transmission 10; and the torque commands TA and TB for the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72. The TCM 17 is operatively connected<br>
to the hydraulic control circuit 42 and provides various functions including<br>
monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and<br>
communicating control signals to various solenoids (not shown) thereby<br>
controlling pressure switches and control valves contained within the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br><br>
[0023] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and<br>
functions to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14<br>
over a plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-<br>
directional interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque<br>
command from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input<br>
torque, TI, provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon<br>
monitored engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The<br>
ECM 23 monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the<br>
engine input speed to the input member 12, which translates to the<br>
transmission input speed, NI, The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not<br>
shown) to determine states of other engine operating parameters including,<br>
e.g., a manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature,<br>
and ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from<br>
the manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0024] The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated<br>
clutch torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75,<br>
and rotational output speed, NO, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br><br><br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic control circuit 42 to<br>
selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0025] The BPCM 21 signally connects to sensors (not shown) to monitor<br>
the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage parameters, to<br>
provide information indicative of parametric states of the batteries of the ESD<br>
74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries preferably include<br>
battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature, and available<br>
battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX.<br>
[0026] The brake control module (hereafter 'BrCM') 22 is operatively<br>
connected to friction brakes on each of the vehicle wheels 93. Braking<br>
preferably comprises a blending of friction braking and regenerative braking.<br>
The BrCM 22 monitors the operator input to the brake pedal 112 and<br>
determines a net operator input to the brake pedal 112 and the accelerator<br>
pedal 113. The BrCM 22 commands friction braking by applying the friction<br>
brakes and commands the powertrain system including the transmission 10 to<br>
create a negative output torque to react with the driveline 90. The electro-<br>
mechanical transmission 10 and the engine 14 can generate a negative output<br>
torque that reacts with the driveline 90. The negative output torque reacted<br>
through the electro-mechanical transmission 10 can be transferred to the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72 to generate electric power for storage<br>
in the ESD 74. The regenerative braking is effected through the driveline 90<br>
by selectively applying one of the clutches and controlling the first and second<br><br><br>
electric machines 56 and 72 to react torque transferred from the driveline 90<br>
through the power inverters and respective motor control modules to meet the<br>
commanded motor torques TA and TB which are determined based upon the<br>
negative output torque. The applied braking force and the negative output<br>
torque can decelerate and stop the vehicle so long as they are sufficient to<br>
overcome vehicle kinetic power at the wheel(s) 93.<br>
[0027] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, BPCM<br>
21, and BrCM 22 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising<br>
a microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and SPI buses. The control algorithms are<br>
executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is executed at<br>
least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile memory<br>
devices are executed by one of the central processing units to monitor inputs<br>
from the sensing devices and execute control and diagnostic routines to<br>
control operation of the actuators, using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are<br>
executed at regular intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100<br>
milliseconds during ongoing operation of the hybrid powertrain.<br><br><br>
Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to the occurrence of an<br>
event.<br>
[0028] The exemplary hybrid powertrain selectively operates in one of<br>
several operating range states that can be described in terms of an engine state<br>
comprising one of an engine-on state ('ON') and an engine-off state ("OFF"),<br>
and a transmission state comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br><br>
[0029J Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously<br>
variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying clutch C1 70<br>
only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. The engine state can be one of ON ('MI_Eng_On') or OFF<br>
('MI_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 2. or<br>
M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the<br><br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON<br>
('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off). For purposes of this description,<br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating. A<br>
fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed<br>
of the transmission 10, i.e., NI/NO. A first fixed gear operation ('Gl') is<br>
selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75. A second fixed gear operation<br>
('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C2 62. A third fixed gear<br>
operation ('G3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth<br>
fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73.<br>
The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases with increased<br>
fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the planetary gears 24, 26,<br>
and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72, NAand NB respectively, are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at the input member 12.<br>
[0030] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and<br>
brake pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or<br>
more of the other control modules determine torque commands to control the<br>
torque generative devices comprising the engine 14 and first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 to meet the operator torque request at the output<br>
member 64 and transferred to the driveline 90. Based upon input signals from<br>
the user interface 13 and the hybrid powertrain including the ESD 74, the HCP<br>
5 determines the operator torque request, the output torque command from the<br>
transmission 10 to the driveline 90, the input torque from the engine 14, clutch<br><br><br>
torques for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the<br>
transmission 10 and the motor torques for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, respectively, as is described hereinbelow.<br>
[0031] Final vehicle acceleration can be affected by other factors<br>
including, e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The operating range<br>
state is determined for the transmission 10 based upon a variety of operating<br>
characteristics of the hybrid powertrain. This includes the operator torque<br>
request, communicated through the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112<br>
to the user interface 13 as previously described. The operating range state<br>
may be predicated on a hybrid powertrain torque demand caused by a<br>
command to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in an<br>
electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode. The<br>
operating range state can be determined by an optimization algorithm or<br>
routine which determines optimum system efficiency based upon operator<br>
demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the<br>
engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The control<br>
system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage<br>
fuel economy and battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined<br>
based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-<br>
generative devices, and determines the power output from the transmission 10<br>
required in response to the output torque command at output member 64<br>
preferably to meet the operator torque request. As should be apparent from<br>
the description above, the ESD 74 and the first and second electric machines<br><br><br>
56 and 72 are electrically-operatively coupled for power flow therebetween.<br>
Furthermore, the engine 14, the first and second electric machines 56 and 72,<br>
and the electro-mechanical transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively<br>
coupled to transfer power therebetween to generate a power flow to the output<br>
member 64.<br>
[0032] Fig. 3 shows a control system architecture for controlling and<br>
managing signal flow in a hybrid powertrain system having multiple torque<br>
generative devices, described hereinbelow with reference to the hybrid<br>
powertrain system of Figs. 1 and 2, and residing in the aforementioned control<br>
modules in the form of executable algorithms and calibrations. The control<br>
system architecture is applicable to alternative hybrid powertrain systems<br>
having multiple torque generative devices, including, e.g., a hybrid powertrain<br>
system having an engine and a single electric machine, a hybrid powertrain<br>
system having an engine and multiple electric machines. Alternatively, the<br>
hybrid powertrain system can utilize non-electric torque machines and energy<br>
storage systems, e.g., hydraulic-mechanical hybrid transmissions using<br>
hydraulically powered torque machines (not shown).<br>
[0033] In operation, the operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and<br>
the brake pedal 112 are monitored to determine the operator torque request.<br>
The operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal 112<br>
comprise individually determinable operator torque request inputs including<br>
an immediate accelerator output torque request ('Output Torque Request<br>
Accel Immed'), a predicted accelerator output torque request ('Output Torque<br>
Request Accel Prdtd'), an immediate brake output torque request ('Output<br>
Torque Request Brake Immed'), a predicted brake output torque request<br><br><br>
('Output Torque Request Brake Prdtd') and an axle torque response type<br>
('Axle Torque Response Type'). As used herein, the term 'accelerator' refers<br>
to an operator request for forward propulsion preferably resulting in increasing<br>
vehicle speed over the present vehicle speed, when the operator selected<br>
position of the transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the<br>
vehicle in the forward direction. The terms 'deceleration' and 'brake" refer to<br>
an operator request preferably resulting in decreasing vehicle speed from the<br>
present vehicle speed. The immediate accelerator output torque request, the<br>
predicted accelerator output torque request, the immediate brake output torque<br>
request, the predicted brake output torque request, and the axle torque<br>
response type are individual inputs to the control system. Additionally,<br>
operation of the engine 14 and the transmission 10 are monitored to determine<br>
the input speed ('Ni') and the output speed ('No').<br>
[0034] The immediate accelerator output torque request comprises an<br>
immediate torque request determined based upon the operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The control system controls the output torque from the<br>
hybrid powertrain system in response to the immediate accelerator output<br>
torque request to cause positive acceleration of the vehicle. The immediate<br>
brake output torque request comprises an immediate braking request<br>
determined based upon the operator input to the brake pedal 112. The control<br>
system controls the output torque from the hybrid powertrain system in<br>
response to the immediate brake output torque request to cause deceleration,<br>
or negative acceleration, of the vehicle. Vehicle deceleration effected by<br>
control of the output torque from the hybrid powertrain system is combined<br><br>
with vehicle deceleration effected by a vehicle braking system (not shown) to<br>
decelerate the vehicle to achieve the immediate braking request.<br>
[0035] The immediate accelerator output torque request is determined<br>
based upon a presently occurring operator input to the accelerator pedal 113,<br>
and comprises a request to generate an immediate output torque at the output<br>
member 64 preferably to accelerate the vehicle. The immediate accelerator<br>
output torque request is unshaped, but can be shaped by events that affect<br>
vehicle operation outside the powertrain control. Such events include vehicle<br>
level interruptions in the powertrain control for antilock braking, traction<br>
control and vehicle stability control, which can be used to unshape or rate-<br>
limit the immediate accelerator output torque request.<br>
[0036] The predicted accelerator output torque request is determined based<br>
upon the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 and comprises an<br>
optimum or preferred output torque at the output member 64. The predicted<br>
accelerator output torque request is preferably equal to the immediate<br>
accelerator output torque request during normal operating conditions, e.g..<br>
when any one of antilock braking, traction control, or vehicle stability is not<br>
being commanded. When any one of antilock braking, traction control or<br>
vehicle stability is being commanded the predicted accelerator output torque<br>
request remains the preferred output torque with the immediate accelerator<br>
output torque request being decreased in response to changes to the output<br>
torque command related to the antilock braking, traction control, or vehicle<br>
stability control.<br><br>
[0037] The immediate brake output torque request is determined based<br>
upon the operator input to the brake pedal 112 and the control signal to control<br>
the friction brakes to generate friction braking torque.<br>
[0038] The predicted brake output torque request comprises an optimum<br>
or preferred brake output torque at the output member 64 in response to an<br>
operator input to the brake pedal 112 subject to a maximum brake output<br>
torque generated at the output member 64 allowable regardless of the operator<br>
input to the brake pedal 112. In one embodiment the maximum brake output<br>
torque generated at the output member 64 is limited to -0.2g. The predicted<br>
brake output torque request can be phased out to zero when vehicle speed<br>
approaches zero regardless of the operator input to the brake pedal 112. As<br>
desired by a user, there can be operating conditions under which the predicted<br>
brake output torque request is set to zero, e.g., when the operator setting to the<br>
transmission gear selector 114 is set to a reverse gear, and when a transfer case<br>
(not shown) is set to a four-wheel drive low range. The operating conditions<br>
whereat the predicted brake output torque request is set to zero are those in<br>
which blended braking is not preferred due to vehicle operating factors.<br>
[0039] The axle torque response type comprises an input state for shaping<br>
and rate-limiting the output torque response through the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The input state for the axle torque response type<br>
can be an active state, preferably comprising one of a pleasability limited state<br>
a maximum range state, and an inactive state. When the commanded axle<br>
torque response type is the active state, the output torque command is the<br>
immediate output torque. Preferably the torque response for this response type<br>
is as fast as possible.<br><br><br>
[0040] Blended brake torque includes a combination of the friction<br>
braking torque generated at the wheels 93 and the output torque generated at<br>
the output member 64 which reacts with the driveline 90 to decelerate the<br>
vehicle in response to the operator input to the brake pedal 112. The BrCM 22<br>
commands the friction brakes on the wheels 93 to apply braking force and<br>
generates a command for the transmission 10 to create a negative output<br>
torque which reacts with the driveline 90 in response to the immediate braking<br>
request. Preferably the applied braking force and the negative output torque<br>
can decelerate and stop the vehicle so long as they are sufficient to overcome<br>
vehicle kinetic power at wheel(s) 93. The negative output torque reacts with<br>
the driveline 90, thus transferring torque to the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission 10 and the engine 14. The negative output torque reacted<br>
through the electro-mechanical transmission 10 can be transferred to the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72 to generate electric power for storage<br>
intheESD74.<br>
[0041] A strategic optimization control scheme ('Strategic Control') 310<br>
determines a preferred input speed ('NiDes') and a preferred engine state and<br>
transmission operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des') based upon the<br>
output speed and the operator torque request and based upon other operating<br>
parameters of the hybrid powertrain, including battery power limits and<br>
response limits of the engine 14, the transmission 10, and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The predicted accelerator output torque request<br>
and the predicted brake output torque request are input to the strategic<br>
optimization control scheme 310. The strategic optimization control scheme<br>
310 is preferably executed by the HCP 5 during each 100 ms loop cycle and<br><br><br>
each 25 ms loop cycle. The desired operating range state for the transmission<br>
10 and the desired input speed from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 are<br>
inputs to the shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320.<br>
[0042] The shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320<br>
commands changes in the transmission operation (Transmission Commands')<br>
including changing the operating range state based upon the inputs and<br>
operation of the powertrain system. This includes commanding execution of a<br>
change in the transmission operating range state if the preferred operating<br>
range state is different from the present operating range state by commanding<br>
changes in application of one or more of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73,<br>
and C4 75 and other transmission commands. The present operating range<br>
state ('Hybrid Range State Actual') and an input speed profile ("NiProf) can<br>
be determined. The input speed profile is an estimate of an upcoming input<br>
speed and preferably comprises a scalar parametric value that is a targeted<br>
input speed for the forthcoming loop cycle.<br>
[0043J A tactical control scheme ('Tactical Control and Operation') 330 is<br>
repeatedly executed during one of the control loop cycles to determine engine<br>
commands ('Engine Commands') for operating the engine 14, including a<br>
preferred input torque from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 based upon<br>
the output speed, the input speed, and the operator torque request comprising<br>
the immediate accelerator output torque request, the predicted accelerator<br>
output torque request, the immediate brake output torque request, the predicted<br>
brake output torque request, the axle torque response type, and the present<br>
operating range state for the transmission. The engine commands also include<br>
engine states including one of an all-cylinder operating state and a cylinder<br><br><br>
deactivation operating state wherein a portion of the engine cylinders are<br>
deactivated and unfueled, and engine states including one of a fueled state and<br>
a fuel cutoff state. An engine command comprising the preferred input torque<br>
of the engine 14 and a present input torque ('TV) reacting between the engine<br>
14 and the input member 12 are preferably determined in the ECM 23. Clutch<br>
torques ('Tel') for each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75,<br>
including the presently applied clutches and the non-applied clutches are<br>
estimated, preferably in the TCM 17.<br>
[0044] An output and motor torque determination scheme ('Output and<br>
Motor Torque Determination') 340 is executed to determine the preferred<br>
output torque from the powertrain ('Tocmd'). This includes determining<br>
motor torque commands ('TA', 'TB') to transfer a net commanded output<br>
torque to the output member 64 of the transmission 10 that preferably meets<br>
the operator torque request, by controlling the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 in this embodiment. The immediate accelerator output<br>
torque request, the immediate brake output torque request, the present input<br>
torque from the engine 14 and the estimated applied clutch torque(s), the<br>
present operating range state of the transmission 10, the input speed, the input<br>
speed profile, and the axle torque response type are inputs. The output and<br>
motor torque determination scheme 340 executes to determine the motor<br>
torque commands during each iteration of one of the loop cycles. The output<br>
and motor torque determination scheme 340 includes algorithmic code which<br>
is regularly executed during the 6.25 ms and 12.5 ms loop cycles to determine<br>
the preferred motor torque commands.<br><br>
[0045] The hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer output torque to the<br>
output member 64 to react with the driveline 90 to generate tractive torque at<br>
wheel(s) 93 to forwardly propel the vehicle in response to the operator input to<br>
the accelerator pedal 113 when the operator selected position of the<br>
transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the vehicle in the<br>
forward direction. Similarly, the hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer<br>
output torque to the output member 64 to react with the driveline 90 to<br>
generate tractive torque at wheel(s) 93 to propel the vehicle in a reverse<br>
direction in response to the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 when<br>
the operator selected position of the transmission gear selector 114 commands<br>
operation of the vehicle in the reverse direction. Preferably, propelling the<br>
vehicle results in vehicle acceleration so long as the output torque is sufficient<br>
to overcome external loads on the vehicle, e.g., due to road grade,<br>
aerodynamic loads, and other loads.<br>
[0046] A change in the input torque from the engine 14 which reacts with<br>
the input member 12 from the transmission 10 can be effected by changing<br>
mass of intake air to the engine 14 by controlling position of an engine throttle<br>
utilizing an electronic throttle control system (not shown), including opening<br>
the engine throttle to increase engine torque and closing the engine throttle to<br>
decrease engine torque. Changes in the input torque from the engine 14 can<br>
be effected by adjusting ignition timing, including retarding spark timing from<br>
a mean-best-torque spark timing to decrease engine torque. The engine state<br>
can be changed between the engine-off state and the engine-on state to effect a<br>
change in the input torque. The engine state can be changed between the all-<br>
cylinder operating state and the cylinder deactivation operating state, wherein<br><br><br>
a portion of the engine cylinders are unfueled. The engine state can be<br>
changed by selectively operating the engine 14 in one of the fueled state and<br>
the fuel cutoff state wherein the engine is rotating and unfueled. Executing a<br>
shift in the transmission 10 from a first operating range state to a second<br>
operating range state can be commanded and achieved by selectively applying<br>
and deactivating the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75.<br>
[0047] During ongoing operation of the powertrain system, the control<br>
system described with reference to Fig. 3 executes code to evaluate candidate<br>
engine operating points for one or more candidate operating range states to<br>
determine a preferred engine operating point for the engine 14, determine a<br>
preferred operating range state for the transmission 10, and preferred motor<br>
torques for controlling the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in<br>
response to the operator torque request and to meet the output torque<br>
command.<br>
[0048] This includes the control system evaluating a plurality of candidate<br>
engine operating points within a permissible range of engine operating points<br>
for one or more candidate transmission operating range states in the strategic<br>
optimization control scheme 310, and evaluating a plurality of candidate<br>
engine operating points within a permissible range of engine operating points<br>
in the tactical control scheme 330. Each of the candidate engine operating<br>
points is evaluated to determine a preferred engine operating point and a<br>
preferred operating cost for operating the powertrain system at a present<br>
operating range state in response to the operator torque request. These<br>
evaluations result in a feed-forward constraining and control of the input<br><br>
torque based upon the ability of the powertrain to achieve the operator torque<br>
request.<br>
[0049] Fig. 4 schematically shows an exemplary search scheme for<br>
evaluating candidate engine operating points to determine a preferred<br>
operating cost for operating the powertrain system in response to the operator<br>
torque request and an associated preferred engine operating point. There is a<br>
permissible range of input operating points, e.g., engine operating points in<br>
one embodiment that can be characterized in terms of the input speed N], the<br>
input torque TI, and input power PI. There are achievable ranges of motor<br>
torques for the torque machines, e.g., the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72 in one embodiment, and there is a range of available power range from<br>
the ESD 74.<br>
[0050] Evaluating a plurality of candidate engine operating points within<br>
the permissible range of engine operating points preferably includes executing<br>
a search. Each search includes a search engine 410 that iteratively selects a<br>
candidate engine operating point ('Candidate Input Operating Point(j)') from<br>
the permissible range of input operating points ('Input Operating Point<br>
Range'). An optimization function ('Opt To/Ta/Tb Function') 440 has inputs<br>
including power cost inputs ('Power Cost Inputs') and penalty costs (not<br>
shown), the operator torque request ('To_req'), system inputs ('System<br>
Inputs'), and the candidate engine operating point. The system inputs include<br>
including ranges of motor torques for the torque machines, ranges of clutch<br>
reactive torques, and the available power range from the energy storage device<br>
and the output torque command, and other related inputs. The optimization<br>
function 440 calculates, for each candidate engine operating point designated<br><br>
by (j), a range of achievable output torques, a preferred output torque CTo(j)')<br>
preferred motor torques ('Ta(j)', 'Tb(j)'), preferred motor powers ('Pa(j)',<br>
'Pb(j)') and a preferred battery power ('Pbat(j)'). The outputs of the<br>
optimization function 440 are input to a cost function 450 along with the<br>
power cost inputs and penalty cost inputs. The cost function 450 calculates a<br>
cost ('Pcost(j)') for operating the powertrain system at the candidate engine<br>
operating point in an attempt to achieve the operator torque request. The<br>
search engine 410 iteratively selects the candidate engine operating points<br>
within the permissible range of engine operating points and executes the<br>
optimization function 440 and cost function 450 to determine the cost<br>
('Pcostfj)') for operating the powertrain system at the candidate engine<br>
operating point. The search engine 410 executes a quantity of iterations and<br>
identifies a preferred operating cost ('Preferred Operating Cost') and a<br>
corresponding preferred engine operating point ('Preferred Input Operating<br>
Point') preferably comprising the candidate operating point having a minimum<br>
cost to operate the powertrain. When executing searches in the strategic<br>
optimization control scheme 310, a preferred engine operating point is<br>
simultaneously determined for each transmission operating range state, in<br>
order to select a preferred operating range state.<br>
[0051] The cost function 450 determines penalty costs and power costs for<br>
operating the engine 14 and the powertrain system at the preferred output<br>
torque, the preferred motor torques, the preferred motor powers and the<br>
preferred battery power. The power costs include operating costs which are<br>
determined based upon factors that include mechanical power loss in the form<br>
of friction and spin losses, electrical power losses related to heat generation<br><br><br>
and internal resistances and current flow, and parasitic losses. During a<br>
braking event, the power costs include kinetic power loss due to unrecovered<br>
kinetic energy that is expended in the form of heat generation in the friction<br>
brakes, which can be recovered as electric power through regenerative<br>
braking. Costs are assigned and associated with fuel and electrical power<br>
consumption and are associated with a specific operating points of the hybrid<br>
powertrain. Lower power costs are associated with lower fuel consumption at<br>
high conversion efficiencies, lower battery power usage, and lower emissions<br>
for each engine speed/load operating point, and take into account the present<br>
operating state of the engine 14. Penalty costs are costs associated with not<br>
achieving a commanded output torque, and can be based upon a difference<br>
between the operator torque request and the output torque from the powertrain.<br>
[0052] Fig. 6 schematically shows details the optimization function 440<br>
which includes monitoring present operating conditions of the electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid powertrain, e.g., the powertrain system described<br>
hereinabove. Offset motor torques for the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72 can be calculated based upon inputs including the operating range<br>
state ('ORS') of the transmission 10, the input torque (T|') and other terms<br>
based upon system inertias, system damping, and clutch slippage (510).<br>
[0053] The control system executes an algorithm to determine linear<br>
torque constraints to the output torque (520). The linear torque constraints<br>
comprise a plurality of system constraints that achieve a linear change in the<br>
output torque with a linear change in one of the constraints. The system<br>
constraints describe a capability of the hybrid transmission 10 to transfer and<br>
convert electric power to mechanical torque through the first and second<br><br><br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Inputs associated with the linear torque<br>
constraints include motor torque constraints comprising minimum and<br>
maximum achievable motor torques for the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72 ('TAMin', 'TAMax', 'TBMin', and 'TBMax'), and minimum and<br>
maximum clutch reactive torques for applied clutch(es) for first and where<br>
necessary, second applied clutches (TCLnMin', 'TCLnMax') and immediate or<br>
present torque, speed, and electric power inputs. Minimum and maximum<br>
linear output torques ('To Min Lin', 'To Max Lin') can be determined based<br>
upon the minimum and maximum achievable motor torques for the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 and the minimum and maximum clutch<br>
reactive torques for the applied clutch(es). The minimum and maximum linear<br>
output torques are the minimum and maximum output torques that meet the<br>
motor torque constraints and also meet the applied clutch torque constraints.<br>
The minimum and maximum linear output torques ('To Min Lin', 'To Max<br>
Lin') translate to the minimum and maximum raw output torques ('To Min<br>
Raw', 'To Max Raw')<br>
[0054] The control system executes an algorithm to determine quadratic<br>
torque constraints to the output torque (530). The quadratic torque constraints<br>
comprise a plurality of system constraints that achieve a quadratic change in<br>
the output torque with a linear change in one of the constraints. Constraint<br>
inputs include the available battery power (not shown) for an exemplary<br>
system (530). The available battery power for the energy storage device 74<br>
can be represented mathematically as a function of the transmission output<br>
torque To as shown:<br><br><br>
wherein a1 and b1 represent scalar values determined for the specific<br>
application. Eq. 1 can be solved for the output torque, as shown:<br><br>
[0055] For the available battery power range PBAT MIN to PBAT_MAX, four<br>
distinct output torques can be determined from Eq. 2, including maximum and<br>
minimum quadratic output torque constraints for the positive root case and<br>
minimum and maximum quadratic output torque constraints for the negative<br>
root case (TO@PBAT_MAX' and To@PBAT_MIN'), and represent achievable<br>
ranges for the output torque based upon the battery power, depending on<br>
whether discharging, i.e., the positive root case, or charging, i.e., the negative<br>
root case.<br>
[0056] The preferred output torque (To Opt') can be determined based<br>
upon the optimized output torque ('To*'), the optimized battery power<br>
('PBAT*'), the maximum and minimum linear output torques, the minimum<br>
and maximum quadratic output torque constraints (To@PBAT_MAX' and<br>
'To@PBAT_MIN') selected based upon whether charging or discharging, and<br>
the output torque search range ('To Search Range'). The output torque search<br>
range (To Search Range') preferably comprises the immediate accelerator<br>
output torque request (To_req') when operating in a tractive torque<br><br>
generating state to forwardly propel the vehicle. The output torque search<br>
range ('To Search Range') preferably comprises a range between the<br>
immediate accelerator output torque request and a brake torque request when<br>
operating in a regenerative braking state to slow the vehicle. Determining the<br>
preferred output torque can include selecting a temporary output torque<br>
comprising a minimum torque value of the search range for the output torque<br>
and the maximum output torque. The preferred output torque ('To Opt*) is<br>
selected as the maximum of the temporary output torque, the minimum output<br>
torque determined based upon one of the quadratic output torque constraints<br>
and clutch torque constraints, and the minimum linear output torque (540).<br>
The preferred output torque ('To Opt') is determined based upon inputs<br>
including the immediate accelerator output torque request. The preferred<br>
output torque ('To Opt') translates to the preferred output torque ('To(j)")<br>
output from the optimization function 440.<br>
[0057] The preferred output torque ('To Opt') is subject to output torque<br>
constraints comprising the minimum and maximum unfiltered output torques<br>
(To Min Raw', 'To Max Raw') and is determined based upon the range of<br>
allowable output torques, which can vary, and may comprise the immediate<br>
accelerator output torque request. The preferred output torque may comprise<br>
an output torque corresponding to a minimum battery discharge power or an<br>
output torque corresponding to a maximum battery charge power. The<br>
preferred output torque is based upon a capacity of the powertrain to transmit<br>
and convert electric power to mechanical torque through the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72, and the immediate or present torque, speed, and<br>
reactive clutch torque constraints, and electric power inputs thereto. The<br><br><br>
output torque constraints including the minimum and maximum unfiltered<br>
output torques (To Min Raw', 'To Max Raw') and the preferred output torque<br>
('To Opt') can be determined by executing and solving an optimization<br>
function in one of the operating range states for neutral, mode and fixed gear<br>
operation. The optimization function 440 comprises a plurality of linear<br>
equations implemented in an executable algorithm and solved during ongoing<br>
operation of the system to determine the preferred output torque range to<br>
minimize battery power consumption and meet the operator torque request.<br>
Each of the linear equations takes into account the input torque ('Ti'), system<br>
inertias and linear damping. Preferably, there are linear equations specific to<br>
each of the operating range states for neutral, mode and fixed gear operations.<br>
[0058] The output torque constraints comprise a preferred output torque<br>
range at the present input torque, within the available battery power and within<br>
the motor torque constraints subject to the reactive clutch torques of the<br>
applied torque transfer clutches. The output torque command is constrained<br>
within maximum and minimum output torque capacities. In fixed gear and<br>
mode operation, the preferred output torque can comprise the output torque<br>
which maximizes charging of the ESD 74. In neutral, the preferred output<br>
torque is calculated. In fixed gear operation, the preferred output torque can<br>
include the preferred torque split between the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 while meeting the reactive clutch torque constraints.<br>
[0059] Preferred motor torques and battery powers ('TA Opt', T B Opt',<br>
and 'PBATOpt') can be determined based upon the preferred output torque, and<br>
used to control operation of the powertrain system. The preferred motor<br>
torques comprise motor torques which minimize power flow from the ESD 74<br><br><br>
and achieve the preferred output torque. Torque outputs from the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 are controlled based upon the determined<br>
minimum power flow from the ESD 74, which is the preferred battery power<br>
('PBATOpt'). Torque output is controlled based upon the engine input torque<br>
and the motor torque commands for the fir.st and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72, ('TA Opt', TB Opt') respectively, which minimizes the power flow<br>
from the ESD 74 to meet the preferred output torque. The battery powers<br>
associated with the motors ('PA Opt' and 'PB Opt', respectively) can be<br>
determined based upon the torque commands (560).<br>
[0060] Fig. 5 graphically shows output torque ('To') in relation to input<br>
torque ('Ti') for an exemplary system operating at an operating point<br>
illustrating operation of the system described herein, and include input and<br>
output torques at a fuel cutoff state (Ti Min Off), a minimum engine running<br>
state ('Ti Min Run') and a maximum engine running state ('Ti Max') which<br>
represent the permissible range of input operating points in this example.<br>
Output torque is plotted for the input operating points, and lines depicting<br>
maximum and minimum output torques corresponding to the input torques for<br>
the exemplary system are plotted ('To Max' and 'To Min'), along with a line<br>
comprising an operator torque request ('Toreq'), comprising a predicted<br>
accelerator output torque request in the example. A second line ('To Opt') is<br>
depicted, representing the preferred output torque determined based upon the<br>
input torque using the system described hereinabove with reference to Figs. 4<br>
and 6. The preferred output torque is equal to the operator torque request<br>
within the maximum and minimum output torques. The preferred output<br>
torque is equal to the minimum output torque when the operator torque request<br><br><br>
is less than the minimum output torque, and is equal to the maximum output<br>
torque when the operator torque request is greater than the maximum output<br>
torque. For this example, line segment A depicts a range of input torques in<br>
which the output torque from the powertrain system achieves the operator<br>
torque request, shown as the portion of the operator torque request line<br>
('Toreq') that is bounded or lies between the maximum and minimum output<br>
torque lines. Line segment B depicts a range of input torques in which the<br>
output torque from the powertrain system exceeds the operator torque request,<br>
within the ranges of motor torques for the torque machines, e.g., the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72, and within the available power range<br>
from the energy storage device, e.g., the ESD 74. When the powertrain<br>
system operates at an input torque in this region, operating costs in terms of<br>
excess fuel consumed while achieving the operator torque request are excess.<br>
Line segment C depicts a range of input torques in which the output torque<br>
from the powertrain system can not achieve the operator torque request within<br>
the ranges of motor torques and torque constraints for the torque machines and<br>
within the available power range from the energy storage device. The<br>
powertrain system underperforms. Operating at an input torque in the region<br>
depicted by line segment C results in powertrain underperformance.<br>
[0061] Thus, during execution of the strategic optimization control scheme<br>
310 and the tactical control scheme 330, search schemes are executed to<br>
evaluating candidate engine operating points to determine a preferred engine<br>
operating point and an associated preferred operating cost for operating the<br>
powertrain system in response to the operator torque request. The permissible<br>
range of input operating points to the input member can be determined, and<br><br><br>
candidate input operating points within the permissible range of input<br>
operating points can be evaluated to determine maximum and minimum<br>
achievable output torques transferable to the output member for the candidate<br>
engine operating point within ranges of motor torques for the torque machines,<br>
e.g., the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, and within the available<br>
power range from the energy storage device, e.g., ESD 74, in one of the<br>
operating range states. The operator torque request is determined based upon<br>
the operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal 112.<br>
However the preferred output torque command is bounded, or limited, to be<br>
within the maximum and minimum achievable output torques. This is<br>
represented by the line segment A shown in Fig. 5. When the candidate input<br>
operating point results in a preferred output torque that is within the maximum<br>
and minimum achievable output torques, a power cost is determined that is<br>
associated with the candidate engine operating point for operating the hybrid<br>
transmission to achieve the output torque command which comprises the<br>
operator torque request. When the candidate input operating point results in a<br>
preferred output torque that is outside one of the maximum and minimum<br>
achievable output torques, a power cost and a second penalty cost are<br>
determined that are associated the candidate engine operating point for<br>
operating the hybrid transmission. Furthermore, the output torque command is<br>
bounded and thus limited to either the maximum output torque or the<br>
minimum output torque. Therefore, the search scheme does not prevent<br>
operation at the candidate input torque, but does have an increased cost<br>
associated therewith, thus reducing likelihood that the candidate engine<br>
operating point is selected as a preferred engine operating point. Thus, a<br><br><br>
preferred engine operating point, including a preferred engine state can be<br>
selected.. When executing searches in the strategic optimization control<br>
scheme 310, a preferred operating range state can be selected comprising an<br>
engine operating point and an operating range state that minimize costs.<br>
