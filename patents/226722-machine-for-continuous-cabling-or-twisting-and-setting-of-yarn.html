				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a machine for continuous<br>
cabling or twisting, and Setting of yarns in<br>
the textile field.<br>
More specifically, the invention relates to the<br>
treatment of textured yarns, that is to say those<br>
having an initial crimping resulting from the upstream<br>
processes.<br>
Many technical solutions have been proposed for<br>
carrying out the operation of cabling and setting<br>
continuous yarns. Mention may be made, by way of<br>
entirely non-limiting example, of the teaching of<br>
Patent US 5 950 412 which relates to a machine<br>
comprising a central frame supporting a plurality of<br>
identical work positions each comprising:<br>
a twisting or direct cabling spindle supporting a<br>
yarn package, the yarn being intended to be twisted or<br>
cabled with a second yarn;<br>
- yarn forwarding means for eliminating the<br>
tension that results from the twisting or cabling<br>
operation;<br>
- yarn heating means followed by a cooling zone;<br>
- means for winding up the treated yarn;<br>
- the heating means consist of a linear oven<br>
placed vertically or approximately vertically;<br>
- the yarn performs an forward-and-return motion<br>
inside the said oven and is introduced into and<br>
extracted from the latter via its bottom part, a feed<br>
and return system for the said yarn being provided in<br>
the top part; and<br>
- means are provided for keeping the yarn under a<br>
minimum tension during the cooling phase and for<br>
delivering it to the wind-up means.<br>
Solutions have also been proposed in which the oven,<br>
which is of substantial size, is eliminated, to be<br>
replaced with a cylindrical godet associated with a<br>
return guide allowing reeving of the yarn. The godet is heated to a defined<br>
temperature and positively driven in rotation. This solution is taken, for example,<br>
from the teaching of Patent Application FR 02/01357 (not yet published).<br>
Starting from this prior art, the twofold problem that the invention aims to solve is,<br>
on the one hand, that of continuously setting a single yam at a time, in order to<br>
nave a very short path yarn, with few points of contact, so as to obtain better twist<br>
uniformity of the yam and, on the other hand, that of controlling the shrinkage of the<br>
yarn in order to give it very good crimp characteristics in particular, while allowing it<br>
to regain most of its initial crimp. Indeed it is known that the return to the initial<br>
crimp is accompanied by a significant shrinkage which must be controlled.<br>
To solve this twofold problem, a machine has been designed and developed for the<br>
continuous cabling and/or twisting and setting of yarns, comprising several<br>
treatment stations incorporating, in combination and in succession, within the same<br>
work position:<br>
- means for cabling or twisting a yarn;<br>
- heat-setting means consisting of a heated rotary godet<br>
- an accumulator capable of cooling and relaxing the yarn in the completely<br>
free, tensionless state; and<br>
- means for winding on or winding up the yarn,<br>
the said means being subjected to means for driving and guiding the yarn;<br>
characterised in that<br>
the heated rotary godet has configurations capable of allowing the shrinkage<br>
of the yarn to be controlled, the said configurations consisting of a longitudinal<br>
profile defining successive zones that extend over almost the entire length of the<br>
said godet, namely an initial crimp pick-up zone, a residual shrinkage zone and a<br>
setting zone wherein the initial crimp pick-up and residual shrinkage zones consist<br>
of conical bearing surfaces, while the setting zone consists of a cylindrical bearing<br>
surface; and<br>
the accumulator capable of cooling and relaxing the yarn in the completely<br>
free, tensionless state consists of a hollow straight body placed approximately<br>
vertically, the end of which, considered on the output side, is frustoconical in order<br>
to create, within the said body, a buffer zone braking the output of the said yarn by<br>
preventing it from leaving directly.<br>
The fact of combining the three cabling or twisting,<br>
heat-setting and winding-on operations makes it<br>
possible to substantially reduce the management of<br>
material undergoing processing between these three<br>
operations. This results in large savings in terms of<br>
the necessary labour for management of the in-process<br>
stocks and the immobilization of material, and also a<br>
reduction in the production cycle.<br>
To solve the problem posed of having the shortest<br>
possible yarn path, at the or each treatment station,<br>
the cabling or twisting means, heat-setting means and<br>
winding-on means are mounted in combination with<br>
devices for forwarding the yarn and arrangements of the<br>
frame of the said machine, so as to delimit a small and<br>
compact space that incorporates the yarn wind-off<br>
means, along a yarn path of short length.<br>
To solve the problem posed of being able to control the<br>
shrinkage of the yarn:<br>
- the initial crimp pick-up and residual<br>
shrinkage zones consist of conical bearing surfaces,<br>
while the setting zone consists of a cylindrical<br>
bearing surface;<br>
- the two conical bearing surfaces have different<br>
cone angles, the residual shrinkage zone having a<br>
smaller angle than the initial crimp pick-up zone;<br>
- advantageously, the length of the setting zone<br>
is greater than the sum of the lengths of the two other<br>
zones.<br>
In another embodiment, the initial crimp pick-up,<br>
residual shrinkage and setting zones may consist of a<br>
curved profile.<br>
Another problem that the invention aims to solve is to<br>
keep the yarn in contact with the godet for a certain<br>
time, in order to set the yarn. For this purpose, the<br>
heated godet is subjected to means capable of allowing<br>
automatic reeving of the yarn.<br>
Another problem that the invention aims to solve is to<br>
ensure complete cooling and relaxation of the yarn<br>
after heat-setting in order to create a buffer zone<br>
between the heat-setting and the winding-on, in order<br>
to continue the heat-setting, continuously during a<br>
change of take-up bobbin.<br>
To solve such a problem, the accumulator consists of a<br>
hollow straight body, the end of which, considered on<br>
the output side, is frustoconical in order to create,<br>
within the said body, a buffer zone braking the output<br>
of the said yarn by preventing it from leaving<br>
directly,<br>
At the outlet of the accumulator, the yarn is subjected<br>
to the action of bars capable of uncurling the yarn and<br>
giving it the tension needed for winding-on.<br>
In another embodiment, the accumulator consists of a<br>
relaxation belt in which the yarn forms a reserve, the<br>
said belt being placed between the heated godet and the<br>
wind-up means, the wind-up speed being regulated so<br>
that the amount of accumulated yarn in reserve is<br>
maintained between two predetermined values, a minimum<br>
value and a maximum value.<br>
The yarn is deposited in the accumulator through the<br>
effect of a relative movement between a guiding element<br>
and the accumulator itself.<br>
The relative movement is created by a displacement of<br>
the yarn guiding element or by a displacement of the<br>
accumulator itself.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, each<br>
treatment station comprises, in succession starting<br>
from the wind-off bobbin:<br>
- a yarn cabling or twisting spindle;<br>
- a presser/deliverer member limiting the tension<br>
of the yarn and setting a level of twist downstream;<br>
- the heated rotary godet;<br>
- the cooling accumulator;<br>
- the uncurling bars; and<br>
- the winding-on or wind-up bobbin.<br>
The invention will be explained below in greater detail<br>
with the aid of the figures of the appended drawings in<br>
which:<br>
- Figure 1 is a schematic view showing the<br>
principle of how the yarns are treated in one and the<br>
same work position that combines the cabling or<br>
twisting, heat-setting and winding-on operations;<br>
- Figure 2 is a perspective view of an<br>
illustrative example of a machine according to the<br>
invention;<br>
- Figure 3 is a schematic view showing an<br>
illustrative example of the heated godet;<br>
- Figure 4 is a perspective view of the<br>
accumulator; and<br>
- Figure 5 is a longitudinal sectional view of<br>
the accumulator.<br>
As shown in particular in Figure 2, the machine<br>
comprises a frame (B) with, preferably, a plurality of<br>
identical treatment stations. According to the<br>
invention, each treatment station incorporates, in<br>
combination and in succession, in one and the same work<br>
position, means (1) for cabling or twisting a yarn,<br>
means (2) for heat-setting the yarn, means (3) for<br>
cooling the yarn and means (4) for winding on or<br>
winding up the yarn (5).<br>
According to an important feature of the invention,<br>
within each treatment station, the cabling or twisting<br>
(1), heat-setting (2) and cooling (3) means and the<br>
means (4) for winding on or winding up the yarn (5) are<br>
mounted in combination with arrangements of the frame<br>
(B) of the machine so as to define a small compact<br>
space incorporating the yarn wind-up means (6) along a<br>
path of short length (Figure 1).<br>
The yarn cabling or twisting means consist, in a manner<br>
perfectly well known to those skilled in the art, of a<br>
cabling or twisting spindle for carrying out either a<br>
direct cabling operation or a twisting. For example,<br>
the spindle, driven by any suitable known means,<br>
receives a bobbin of a first yarn to be treated, called<br>
a "can yarn". To carry out the direct cabling<br>
operation, the spindle has a hollow shaft for feeding a<br>
second yarn, called the "creel yarn", coming from the<br>
wind-off bobbin (6). The creel yarn is fed through the<br>
hollow shaft of the spindle, to be joined with the can<br>
yarn within a cabling head (7). This cabling head may<br>
be combined with a forwarding means for eliminating the<br>
tension resulting from the cabling or twisting. This<br>
forwarding means may be composed of an assembly of the<br>
type comprising a capstan and a press roll. Such<br>
arrangements are not described in detail as they are<br>
perfectly well known to those skilled in the art. The<br>
reader may for example return to the teaching of the<br>
cited Patent US 5 950 412.<br>
The yarn heat-setting means consist of a heated rotary<br>
godet (2) followed by an accumulator (3) capable of<br>
cooling and relaxing the yarn, making it completely<br>
free and tensionless. The godet (2) is heated to a<br>
defined temperature and is driven positively in<br>
rotation by any suitable known means. For example, the<br>
heating means may be of the induction type.<br>
Importantly, the godet (2) has configurations capable<br>
of allowing the shrinkage of the yarn to be controlled.<br>
As shown especially in Figure 3, the godet has a<br>
longitudinal profile shaped so as to define successive<br>
continuous zones that extend over almost its entire<br>
length. These zones consist of a pick-up zone (2a) a<br>
residual shrinkage zone (2b) and a setting zone (2c).<br>
For example, the two zones (2a) and (2b) consist of<br>
conical bearing surfaces, while the setting zone (2c)<br>
consists of a cylindrical bearing surface. The conical<br>
bearing surfaces (2a) and (2b) have different angles.<br>
Thus, the residual shrinkage zone (2b) has a smaller<br>
cone angle a than the cone angle ß of the initial crimp<br>
pick-up zone (2a).<br>
This figure also shows that the residual shrinkage zone<br>
(2b) has a greater length than the pick-up zone (2a) .<br>
Likewise, the length of the setting zone (2c) is<br>
greater than the sum of the lengths of the two other<br>
zones (2a) and (2b). The illustrated example therefore<br>
shows that the three zones (2a) , (2b) and (2c) result<br>
from a succession of bearing surfaces of different<br>
length and cone angle.<br>
Of course, without departing from the scope of the<br>
invention, other profiles that can produce the same<br>
functions with a view to producing the same results may<br>
be envisaged. For example, the godet (2) may have a<br>
curved longitudinal profile.<br>
Owing to the features of the heated godet (2), it is<br>
possible to set the cabled or twisted yarn so as to<br>
give it very good crimp characteristics.<br>
Within the initial crimp pick-up zone (2a), the contact<br>
of the yarn on the heated godet creates a shock effect,<br>
allowing the yarn to take up its initial crimp. The<br>
return to the crimp is accompanied by a significant<br>
shrinkage which must be controlled. This control is<br>
obtained by the cone angle ß of the conical bearing<br>
surface (2a) . After the yarn has been given this shock<br>
effect, the residual shrinkage zone (2b) allows the<br>
yarn to complete its shrinkage gently and uniformly,<br>
given the smaller cone angle a of the conical bearing<br>
surface (2b) , which is longer than the conical bearing<br>
surface (2a).<br>
Within the cylindrical zone (2c), the yarn is set under<br>
the conditions to which it was subjected in the two<br>
previous zones. Owing to the large length of the<br>
cylindrical bearing surface (2c), the setting of the<br>
yarn takes place gently.<br>
Owing to these arrangements in the two conical zones,<br>
the yarn retains its original tension, but undergoes<br>
shrinkage. The yarn has a tendency to rotate on itself<br>
as its tension gradually increases. It follows that all<br>
the portions of the yarn are in contact with the godet,<br>
which ensures a completely round shape of the yarn. The<br>
conical profile and the textile control means that the<br>
yarn necessarily has a calculated shrinkage.<br>
It may also be observed that, for setting the yarn, the<br>
latter must remain for a certain time in contact with<br>
the various zones of the godet (2) . To increase this<br>
contact time, it is known to carry out a yarn reeving<br>
operation on the godet. This reeving operation may be<br>
performed manually or automatically.<br>
After leaving the heated godet (2) assembly, the yarn<br>
is subjected to the action of an accumulator (3)<br>
capable of completely cooling and relaxing the yarn<br>
after heat-setting and of creating a buffer zone<br>
between the heat-setting and the winding-on, allowing<br>
continuation of the heat-setting, continuously during a<br>
change of take-up bobbin (4).<br>
As shown in particular in Figures 4 and 5, the<br>
accumulator (3) consists of a hollow linear body, for<br>
example of quadrangular cross section. The end of the<br>
body of the accumulator (3), considered on the output<br>
side, is frustoconical with a cross section that<br>
progressively decreases towards the said free end in<br>
order to create, inside the body, a buffer zone braking<br>
the output of the yarn, preventing it from leaving<br>
directly.<br>
As shown in particular in Figures 1 and 2, this<br>
accumulator (3), after the heated godet, lies, within<br>
the treatment station in question, in an approximately<br>
vertical plane, the yarn entering the end (3b) before<br>
exiting, by simple gravity, at the frustoconical<br>
portion (3a). At this frustoconical end (3a), the<br>
accumulator (3) has a series of parallel bars (8)<br>
mounted on a support element (9) fastened, for example,<br>
to the end of the accumulator (3) . The bars (8) are<br>
placed approximately perpendicular to the longitudinal<br>
axis of the accumulator (3), i.e. perpendicular to the<br>
path of the yarn, in order to carry out an uncurling<br>
function on the said yarn, giving it the tension needed<br>
for winding-on.<br>
Other embodiments of the accumulator (3) may be<br>
envisaged. For example, it may consist of a relaxation<br>
belt in which the yarn forms a reserve. The belt is<br>
placed between the heated godet (2) and the wind-up<br>
means (4) . The wind-up speed is regulated so that the<br>
amount of accumulated yarn in reserve is maintained<br>
between two predetermined values, a minimum value and a<br>
maximum value.<br>
It should also be noted that the deposition of the yarn<br>
(5) in the accumulator (3), whatever its embodiment,<br>
may result from a relative movement between a guiding<br>
element and the accumulator (3) itself. This movement<br>
may be an alternating movement of the to-and-fro type,<br>
or else a continuous or alternating rotation.<br>
Alternatively, the relative movement is created by the<br>
displacement of the guiding element or of the<br>
accumulator itself.<br>
Owing to the features forming the basis of the<br>
invention, it is apparent that each treatment station<br>
comprises, in succession starting from the wind-off<br>
bobbin (6) , in one and the same work position defining<br>
a small compact space, also with a yarn path of short<br>
length:<br>
a yarn cabling or twisting spindle (1) , the<br>
presser/deliverer member (7) limiting the tension of<br>
the yarn (5) and setting a level of tension downstream;<br>
the heated rotary godet (2);<br>
the cooling accumulator (3);<br>
the uncurling bars (8); and<br>
the wind-up bobbin (4).<br>
It is very clear that these various means may be<br>
mounted in combination with any in-line quality control<br>
system, the buffer accumulator downstream of the<br>
spindle, yarn crimping system, yarn breakage detection<br>
system, etc.<br>
The advantages are clearly apparent from the<br>
description, in particular the following may be<br>
emphasized and recalled:<br>
the continuous setting of a single yarn at a<br>
time along a short path makes it possible to overcome<br>
the problem of scrap associated with dispersion in the<br>
quality of the various bobbins when they are treated<br>
jointly;<br>
the possibility of treating grades of yarns<br>
having a high twist;<br>
the increase in productivity obtained;<br>
the flexibility of the process;<br>
the control of yarn shrinkage owing to the<br>
profile of the heated godet;<br>
the use of an accumulator for cooling and<br>
relaxing the yarn in the completely free, tensionless<br>
state;<br>
the better uniformity of the tension in the<br>
yarn resulting from a very short path of the yarn with<br>
contact points;<br>
the minimal distance between the deliverer and<br>
the heated godet allows better twist control before<br>
setting, avoiding short-term changes in twist; and<br>
the combining of the three, cabling or<br>
twisting, heat-setting and winding-on operations makes<br>
it possible to substantially reduce the management of<br>
the materials being processed.<br>
