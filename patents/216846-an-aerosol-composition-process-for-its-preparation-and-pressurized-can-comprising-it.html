		The present invention relates to aerosol delivery<br>
	systems and, in particular, to aerosol delivery<br>
5	system which are designed to reduce the amount of<br>
	surfactant Included therein.<br>
		Aerosol compositions are known in the art which<br>
	contain oil soluble functional materials such as<br>
10	fragrances, silicones, esters and bio-active materials.<br>
	therein. In order to disperse the oil soluble<br>
	functional material into the aqueous phase of the<br>
	aerosol composition there is generally a requirement<br>
	to include in the composition from two to three times<br>
15	by weight of the functional material of a solvent or<br>
	surfactant therein.<br>
		We have now found that incorporation of the oil<br>
	soluble functional material into a biliquid foam<br>
20	enables this material to be readily dispersed<br>
	throughout the aqueous phase of the aerosol<br>
	composition without the use of excessive amounts of<br>
	solvents or surfactants, which may affect the material<br>
	and which may neutralize the effects of any<br>
25	preservatives contained within the aerosol<br>
	composition.<br>
		Accordingly, the present invention provides an<br>
	aerosol composition which is prepared from a biliquid<br>
30	foam, an aqueous phase and a propellant.<br>
		The invention also provides a pressurized aerosol<br>
	can comprising an aerosol composition, of the<br>
	invention.<br><br>
WO 2004/042227							PCT/GB2003/004806<br>
- 2 -<br>
		The invention also provides a process for<br>
	preparing an aerosol composition of the invention<br>
	which comprises adding the aqueous phase to a vessel,<br>
	adding the biliquid foam to the vessel and mixing and<br>
5	filling an aerosol can with the addition of a suitable<br>
	propellent.<br>
		Biliquid foam are known in the art and are<br>
	described in the following literature references by<br>
10	Sebba; "Biliquid foams", J. colloid and Interface<br>
	Science, 40 (1972) 468-474; and "The Behaviour of<br>
	Minute Oil Droplets Encapsulated in a Water Film"<br>
	Colloid Polymer Sciences, 257 (1979) 392-396.<br>
15		US Patent No., 4486333 to Sebba describes a<br>
	particular method for the preparation of biliquid<br>
	foams by agiating a hydrogen bonded liquid containing<br>
	a soluble surfactant to produce a gas foam and<br>
	Intermittently adding to the gas foam a non-polar<br>
20	liquid which is immiscible with the hydrogen bonded<br>
	liquid, the surfactant-containing hydrogen bonded<br>
	liquid being selected to provide a spreading<br>
	coefficient equal to or greater than zero.<br>
25		The biliquid roam which is incorporated into the<br>
	aerosol compositions of the present invention<br>
	generally contains at least one oil soluble functional<br>
	material therein. Examples of the oil soluble<br>
	functional materials are fragrances, lubricants,<br>
30	vegetable oils, fuels, silicones, esters and bio-<br>
	active materials.<br>
		The biliquid foam which is used in the present<br>
	invention will preferably comprise from 70 to 95% by<br><br>
WO 2004/41227							PCT/GB2003/004806<br>
- 3 -<br>
	weight of the oil phase, which may consist solely of<br>
	the oil soluble functional material, and 5 to 30% by<br>
	weight of the continuous phase, which is preferably an<br>
	aqueous phase. A surfactant to stabilise the biliquid<br>
5	foam may also be included in an amount of from. 0 _ 1 to<br>
	3%, preferably 0.1 to 1% by weight based on the total<br>
	weight of the formulation. Suitable surfactants are,<br>
	for example, sodium lauryl ether sulphates,<br>
	polyethoxylated castor oil, ethoxylated oleyl alcohols<br>
10	or polyethoxylated hydrogenated castor oils.<br>
		Propellents which are used in aerosol delivery<br>
	systems are well known in the art and will preferably<br>
	be liquified petroleum gas (LPG), Which is preferably<br>
15	burane, optionally in admixture with propane. The<br>
	propellant will generally be present in an amount of<br>
	from 5 to 40% by weight.<br>
		The aerosol compositions of the present invention<br>
20	will generally include the biliquid foam in an amount<br>
	of from o.1 to 10% by weight. The biliquid foam will<br>
	therefore generally provide the desired oil soluble<br>
	functional material in an amount of from 0. 07 to 9.5%<br>
	by weight.<br>
25<br>
		The invention, includes within its scope an<br>
	aerosol composition which comprises from 0.01 to 40%<br>
	by weight of the biliquid foam, from 5 to. 40% weight<br>
	of the propellant and from 20 to 95% by weight of<br>
30	water.<br>
		The aqueous phase of the asroeol composition may<br>
	include therein one or more surfactants or other<br>
	additives. The surfaatant may be chosen to prevent<br><br>
WO 2004/041041227							PCT/GB2003/004806<br>
- 4 -<br>
	interaction of the propellant with the biliquid foam.<br>
	Cationic surfactants are preferred, in particular<br>
	quaternary ammonium compounds or amine oxides.<br>
	Surfactants may also be choesn, to create an affinity<br>
5	with the propellant.<br>
		The aerosol compositions of the present invention<br>
	may be packaged in cans which are well Known in the<br>
	art and generally are formed of aluminium or lacquered<br>
10	or unlacquered tin plate or the like.<br>
		Methods of producing biliquict foam are described<br>
	in US-A-4486333 involving the preliminary formation of<br>
	a gas foam in order to provide a sufficiently large<br>
15	surface area on which the biliquid foam can<br>
	subsequently be formed. It has been found that the<br>
	prior formation of a gas foam is not required to<br>
	manufacture a stable biliquid foam, provided that a<br>
	suitable stirring mechanism is provided in the<br>
20	manufacturing vessel.<br>
		Such an apparatus comprises a tank provided with<br>
	a stirrer in which the stirrer blade breaks the<br>
	interface between the liquid and air and provides low<br>
25	shear mixing throughout the whole of the volume of the<br>
	biliquid foam throughout the whole of the production<br>
	process. A delivery device is provided through which<br>
	the oil phase (non-polar liquid), which will comprise<br>
	the internal phase of the dispersion is delivered to<br>
30	the tank. The design of the delivery device is such<br>
	that the rate of addition of the internal phase fluid<br>
	can be controlled and varied during the production<br>
	process. A feature of the production process is that<br>
	the internal (oil) phase ia added to the stirred<br><br>
WO 2004/041227							PCT/GB2003/004806<br>
- 5 -<br>
	aqueous phase slowly at first until sufficient<br>
	droplets have been formed to constitute a large,<br>
	additional surface area for the more rapid formation<br>
	of new droplets, At this point, the rate of addition<br>
5	of the oil phase way be increased.<br>
		The production process consists of the following<br>
	steps:<br>
10		1.	The addition of one or more chosen<br>
			surfactants to one or other or both, phases<br>
			(as. previously determined by experiment) ,<br>
		2.	The charging of the aqueous phase into the<br>
			bottom of a process vessel.<br>
15		3.	The incorporation of the stirrer into the<br>
			vessel so that it stirs the surface of the<br>
			aqueous phase.<br>
		4.	Adjustment of the stirrer speed to a<br>
			previously determined level.<br>
20		5,	The slow addition of the internal phase<br>
			whilst continuing to stir at the prescribed<br>
			speed.<br>
		6.	The speeding up of the rate of addition of<br>
			the oil phase once a prescribed amount<br>
25			(usually between 5% and 10% of the total<br>
			amount to be added) 1 as been added.<br>
		The stirring rate and the rate of addition of the<br>
	oil phase are variables, the values of which depend<br>
30	upon the detailed design of the manufacturing plant<br>
	(in particular, the ratio of tank diameter to impeller<br>
	diameter) r the physical-chemical properties of the oil<br>
	phase and the nature and concantrations of the choser,.<br>
	surfactants . These can all be pre-determined by<br><br>
WO 2004/041227							PCT/GB2003/004806<br>
- 6 -<br>
	laboratory or pilot plant experiment.<br>
		It will be understood by those skilled in the art<br>
	that other manufacturing methods for the biliquid foam<br>
5	may be used, as appropriate.<br>
		The preparation of the biliquid foams proceeds<br>
	independently of the preparation of the final aerosol<br>
	compositions of the invention. The aerosol<br>
10	compositions may be prepared by adding the aqueous<br>
	phase optionally including one or more surfactants<br>
	therein to a suitable vessel, adding the biliquid foam<br>
	thereto and mixing. The composition so prepared is<br>
	then filled into aerosol cans using techniques known<br>
15	in the art. The. compositions are then pressurized in<br>
	the aerosol cans, with the addition of a suitable<br>
	propellant, using techniaques known in the art.<br>
		The aerosol compositions of the present invention<br>
20	will generally possess one or more of the following<br>
	advantages:<br>
			-	the elimination of the need for the use of<br>
				large amounts of solvents or surfactants and<br>
25				volatile organic compounds.<br>
			-	the potential to reduce skin irritation in<br>
				compositions which are to be applied to the<br>
				skin;<br>
30 <br>
			-	the possibility to include in the<br>
				Composition oils which, would generally be<br>
				incomptible with one another;<br><br>
WO 2004/041227							PCT/CB2003/004806<br>
- 7 -<br>
			-	the possibility of using lower levels of<br>
				fragrance components, whilst obtaining the<br>
				same level of fragrance impact.<br>
5			-	the possibility of using lower levels of<br>
				preservatives, whilst obtaining the same<br>
				level of preservation.<br>
			-	better performing formulations which allow<br>
10				dispensing using less propellant to achieve.<br>
				similar results.<br>
		The aerosol compositions of the invention are<br>
	preferably used as or in polishes, particularly<br>
15	furniture polishes, air fresheners, fragrances/<br>
	moisturisers, sunscreens, shaving preparations, or<br>
	follicle softeners.<br>
		The aerosol compositions of the invention may<br>
20	contain other components (in addition to the biliquid<br>
	foam aqueous phase and propellant) depending upon the<br>
	uses to which they are to be put. Thus, where the<br>
	aerosol compositions are to be used as polishes, the<br>
	compositions may additionally contain waxes, for<br>
25	example vegetable waxes (for example, carnauba and<br>
	candelilla) , optionally combined with one or more<br>
	softeners, fillers and pigments. one or more alcohols<br>
	or other solvents may also be present.<br>
30		Where the aerosal compositions are used. as<br>
	furniture polishes, these may additionally contain one<br>
	or more of silicone, red oil, lemon oil and petroleum<br>
	solvent; nail polishes generally comprise<br>
