BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a fibrous web being processed into a paper<br>
product on a papermaking machine. More specifically, the present invention<br>
relates to a method and device for pressing operations associated with the<br>
production of paper.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
During the papermaking process, a fibrous web of cellulosic fibers is<br>
formed on a forming wire by depositing a fibrous slurry thereon in the forming<br>
section of a paper machine. A large amount of water is drained from the slurry in<br>
the forming section, after which the newly formed web is conducted to a press<br>
section. The press section includes a series of press nips, in which the fibrous web<br>
is subjected to compressive forces applied to remove water therefrom. The web<br>
finally is conducted to a drying section which includes heated dryer drums around<br>
which the web is directed. The heated dryer drums reduce the water content of the<br>
web to a desirable level through evaporation to yield a paper product.<br>
Rising energy costs have made it increasingly desirable to remove as much<br>
water as possible from the web prior to its entering the dryer section. As the dryer<br>
drums are often heated from within by steam, costs associated with steam<br>
production can be substantial, especially when a large amount of water needs to be<br>
removed from the web.<br>
Traditionally, press sections have included a series of nips formed by pairs<br>
of adjacent cylindrical press rolls. In recent years, the use of long press nips of the<br>
shoe type has been found to be more advantageous than the use of nips formed by<br>
pairs of adjacent press rolls. This is because the web takes longer to pass through a<br>
long press nip than through one formed by press rolls. The longer the time a web<br>
can be subjected to pressure in the nip, the more water can be removed there, and,<br>
consequently, the less water will remain behind in the web for removal through<br>
evaporation in the dryer section.<br>
The present invention relates to long nip presses of the shoe type. In this<br>
variety of long nip press, the nip is formed between a cylindrical press roll and an<br>
arcuate pressure shoe. The latter has a cylindricaily concave surface having a radius<br>
of curvature close to that of the cylindrical press roll. When the roll and shoe are<br>
brought into close physical proximity to one another, a nip which can be five to ten<br>
times longer in the machine direction than one formed between two press rolls is<br>
formed. Since the long nip is five to ten times longer than that in a conventional<br>
two-roll press, the so-called dwell time of the fibrous web in the long nip is<br>
correspondingly longer under the same level of pressure per square inch in pressing<br>
force used in a two-roll press. The result of this long nip technology has been a<br>
dramatic increase in dewatering of the fibrous web in the long nip when compared<br>
to conventional nips on paper machines.<br>
A long nip press of the shoe type requires a special belt, such as that shown<br>
in U.S. Pat. No. 5,238,537. This belt is designed to protect the press fabric<br>
supporting, carrying and dewatering the fibrous web from the accelerated wear that<br>
would result from direct, sliding contact over the stationary pressure shoe. Such a<br>
belt must be provided with a smooth, impervious surface that rides, or slides, over<br>
the stationary shoe on a lubricating film of oil. The belt moves through the nip at<br>
roughly the same speed as the press fabric, thereby subjecting the press fabric to<br>
minimal amounts of rubbing against the surface of the belt.<br>
Belts of the variety shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,238,537 are made by<br>
impregnating a woven base fabric, which takes the form of an endless loop, with a<br>
synthetic polymeric resin. Preferably, the resin forms a coating of some<br>
predetermined thickness on at least the inner surface of the belt, so that the yarns<br>
from which the base fabric is woven may be protected from direct contact with the<br>
arcuate pressure shoe component of the long nip press. It is specifically this coating<br>
which must have a smooth, impervious surface to slide readily over the lubricated<br>
shoe and to prevent any of the lubricating oil from penetrating the structure of the<br>
belt to contaminate the press fabric, or fabrics, and fibrous web.<br>
The base fabric of the belt shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,238,537 may be woven<br>
from monofilaraent yams in a single- or multi-layer weave, and woven so as to be<br>
sufficiently open to allow the impregnating material to totally impregnate the<br>
weave. This eliminates the possibility of any voids forming in the final belt. Such<br>
voids may allow the lubrication used between the belt and shoe to pass through the<br>
belt and contaminate the press fabric or fabrics and fibrous web. The base fabric<br>
may be flat-woven, and subsequently seamed into endless form, or woven endless<br>
in tubular form.<br>
When the impregnating material is cured to a solid condition, it is primarily<br>
bound to the base fabric by a mechanical interlock, wherein the cured impregnating<br>
material surrounds the yarns of the base fabric. In addition, there ma&gt; he some<br>
chemical bonding or adhesion between the cured impregnating material and the<br>
material of the yarns of the base fabric.<br>
Long nip press belts, such as that shown in U.S. Pat No. 5,238,537,<br>
depending on the size requirements of the long nip presses on which they are<br>
installed, have lengths from roughly 13 to 35 feet (approximately 4 to 11 meters),<br>
measured longitudinally around their endless-loop forms, and widths from roughly<br>
100 to 450 inches (approximately 250 to 1125 centimeters), measured transversely<br>
across those forms. It will be appreciated that the manufacture of such belts is<br>
complicated by the requirement that the base fabric be endless prior to its<br>
impregnation with a synthetic polymeric resin.<br>
It is often desirable to provide the belt with a resin coating of some<br>
predetermined thickness on its outer surface as well as on its inner surface. By<br>
coaling both sides of the belt, its woven base fabric will be closer to, if not<br>
coincident with, the neutral axis of bending of the belt. In such a circumstance, the<br>
internal stresses which arise when the belt is flexed on passing around a roll or the<br>
like on a paper machine will be less likely to cause the coating to delaminate from<br>
either side of the belt.<br>
Moreover, when the outer surface of the belt has a resin coating of some<br>
predetermined thickness, it permits grooves, blind-drilled holes or other cavities or<br>
voids to be formed on that surface without exposing any part of the woven base<br>
fabric. These features provide for the temporary storage of water pressed from the<br>
web in the press nip. In fact, for some long nip press configurations the presence of<br>
some void volume, provided by grooves, blind-drilled holes or the like, on the outer<br>
surface of the belt is a necessity.<br>
Although consistency and drainage properties of the web are attempted to<br>
be kept as constant as possible throughout the papermaking process, variability<br>
inevitably occurs. Characteristics of the web such as moisture content may change<br>
over time. The moisture content of the web may affect the final product's strength<br>
and quality. For example, an excessively variable moisture content in the cross<br>
direction (CD) profile may lead to variable sheet characteristics, such as curl, and a<br>
decrease hi product quality. Thus, there is a need to control the CD moisture<br>
profile during the papermaking process.<br>
In contrast to the belts of the prior art, the present invention may provide an<br>
improved belt with variable void volume to correct (flatten) the CD sheet moisture<br>
profile. Specifically, the belt of the present invention may, for example, provide<br>
grooves of varying depth hi the area of the belt that is subject to compressive forces<br>
in the nip. The grooves of varying depth improve the CD moisture profile of the<br>
belt, thus enhancing product quality. Alternatively, the present invention may<br>
provide grooves having varying or different shapes, dimensions and/or sizes,<br>
widths and lengths, in the area of the belt that is subject to compressive forces in<br>
the nip. Still further, the present invention may vary the orientation and/or the<br>
number of grooves in this area in combination with any of the foregoing variables.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is a belt for apapermaking process.<br>
Specifically, the belt may be used in a long nip press where the press having a<br>
cylindrical press roller and an arcuate pressure shoe which together define a nip<br>
therebetween.<br>
The present belt has a nip load zone and two edge zones and is operable<br>
such that the nip load zone passes through the nip during an operation. The belt<br>
comprises at least one layer having a resin coating on at least one surface thereof, hi<br>
which the belt is in the form of an endless loop having a longitudinal or machine<br>
direction. The resin layer has a plurality of grooves including a number of first<br>
grooves and a number of second grooves running in a direction substantially<br>
parallel to the longitudinal direction in a center portion of the nip load zone, in<br>
which the number of first grooves have at least one of a depth, cross-sectional<br>
shape, size, or width or combination thereof which is different from that of the<br>
number of second grooves.<br>
The present invention will now be described in more complete detail with<br>
frequent reference being made to the drawings identified below.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The following detailed description, given by way of example and not<br>
intended to limit the present invention solely thereto, will best be appreciated in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals<br>
denote like elements and parts, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a side cross-sectional view of a long hip press;<br>
Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view of a belt in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
Figure 3 is an exploded view of the nip load zone of the belt illustrated in<br>
Figure 2.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in the<br>
context of a long nip shoe press belt.<br>
A long nip press for dewatering a fibrous web being processed into a paper<br>
product on a paper machine is shown in a side cross-sectional view in Figure 1.<br>
Press nip 10 is defined by smooth cylindrical press roll 12 and arcuate pressure<br>
shoe 14. Arcuate pressure shoe 14 has about the same radius of curvature as<br>
cylindrical press roll 12. The distance between cylindrical press roll 12 and arcuate<br>
pressure shoe 14 may be adjusted by hydraulic means or the like operatively<br>
attached to arcuate pressure shoe 14 to control the loading of nip 10. The smooth<br>
cylindrical press roll 12 may be a controlled crown roll matched to the arcuate<br>
pressure shoe 14 to obtain a level cross-machine nip pressure profile. Oftentimes a<br>
CD sheet moisture profile occurs such as a "smile" or "frown" shape. Mechanical<br>
correction of it sometimes is ineffective or not sufficient to one's satisfaction.<br>
Long nip press belt 16 extends in a closed loop through nip 10, separating<br>
cylindrical press roll 12 from arcuate pressure shoe 14. The press fabric 18 and the<br>
fibrous web 20 being processed into a paper sheet pass together through nip 10 as<br>
indicated by the arrows in Figure 1. Fibrous web 20 is supported by press fabric 18<br>
and comes into direct contact with smooth cylindrical press roll 12 in nip 10.<br>
Alternatively, fibrous web 20 may pass through nip 10 sandwiched between two<br>
press fabrics 18 (second press fabric not shown). Long nip press belt 16, also<br>
moving through press nip 10 as indicated by arrows, that is, clockwise as depicted<br>
in Figure 1, protects press fabric 18 from direct sliding contact against arcuate<br>
pressure shoe 14, and typically slides thereover on a lubricating film of oil. Long<br>
nip press belt 16, accordingly, is impermeable to oil, so that press fabric 18 and<br>
fibrous web 20 will not be contaminated thereby.<br>
Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view of a belt in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As shown therein, belt 16 may include nip<br>
load zone 36 and edge zones 38. Nip load zone 36 is the area of the belt which<br>
may pass between press roll 12 and arcuate pressure shoe 14 and which may be in<br>
compression therefrom and is the area of the belt to which this invention is<br>
directed. Edge zones 38 define the areas on the belt from belt edges 37 to nip load<br>
zone 36 and take on configurations known to those skilled in the art. Nip load zone<br>
36 may have an edge zone 38 on both sides thereof in a cross-machine direction of<br>
the belt. Nip load zone 36 and edge zone 38 extend in the machine running or<br>
longitudinal direction of the belt as well.<br>
Belt 16 may include at least one layer, such as a base structure or substrate<br>
layer 28. shown in Fig. 3. However, belt 16 may also contain additional layers.<br>
Layer 28 may be a nonwoven structure in the form of an assembly of transverse, or<br>
cross-machine direction yarns 30 (viewed from the side in Figure 3), and<br>
longitudinal or machine-direction yams 32, which depending upon the application<br>
can be bonded together at their mutual crossing points to form a fabric.<br>
Layer 28 may alternatively be woven. The transverse yarns being warp<br>
yarns weaving over, under and between the longitudinal yams. It should be<br>
understood that layer 28 may be flat woven, and subsequently joined into endless<br>
form with a seam. It should be further understood that layer 28 may be woven in a<br>
single layer weave, or in any other weave pattern which may be known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Further, layer 28 may be a knitted or braided fabric, or a spiral-link belt of<br>
the type shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,567,077 to Gauthier, the teachings of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Layer 28 may also be extruded from a polymeric<br>
resin material in the form of a sheet or membrane, which may subsequently be<br>
provided with apertures. Alternatively still, at least one layer 28 may comprise<br>
nonwoven mesh fabrics, such as those shown in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,427,734 to Johnson, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Further, layer 28 may be produced by spirally winding a strip of woven,<br>
nonwoven, knitted, braided, extruded or nonwoven mesh material according to the<br>
methods shown in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,360,656 to Rexfelt et al., the<br>
teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Layer 28 may accordingly<br>
comprise a spirally wound strip, wherein each spiral rum is joined to the next by a<br>
continuous seam making layer 28 endless in a longitudinal direction. A long nip or<br>
shoe press belt having a layer of this type is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S.<br>
Pat Nos. 5,792,323 and 5,837,080. the teachings of which are incorporated herein<br>
by reference,<br>
A resin such as a polymer resin 34 is deposited, coated, impregnated or<br>
otherwise disposed on at least one surface of belt 16. Polymer resin 34 may be<br>
coated or otherwise disposed on outer surface 24 of belt 16, that is, the surface<br>
which contacts press fabric 18 when belt 16 is hi use on a long nip press. In<br>
addition, the polymer resin may be coated or otherwise disposed on inner surface<br>
22 of belt 16, that is, the surface which slides over the arcuate pressure shoe 14<br>
when belt 16 is in use on a long nip press. Alternatively, the polymer resin may be<br>
coated on both the inner surface 22 and outer surface 24 of belt 16. The polymeric<br>
resin may impregnate layer 28, and render belt 16 impermeable to oil, water, and<br>
the like. Polymeric resin coating 34 may be of polyurethane, and may be a 100%<br>
solids composition thereof. The use of a 100% solids resin system, which by<br>
definition lacks a solvent material, avoids the formation of bubbles in the polymeric<br>
resin during the curing process through which it proceeds following its application<br>
onto layer 28. Other coating material may also be used, for example, rubber or<br>
rubber like compounds, hi any event, the resin layers can be the same or different,<br>
with the same or different hardness level.<br>
Inner surface 22 and/or outer surface 24 may also be ground and buffed<br>
after the polymeric resin has been cured to provide the polymeric resin coating with<br>
a smooth, uniform surface.<br>
After the polymeric resin has been cured, grooves 26 may be provided into<br>
outer surface 24 of belt 16. Specifically, grooves 26 of varying depth may be cut,<br>
drilled or otherwise provided in nip load zone 36 (i.e., the area of the belt that<br>
undergoes compression, which is usually a portion of the total belt width) and<br>
oriented so as to run hi the longitudinal direction. In one embodiment of the<br>
present invention the grooves 26 run parallel to each other, however, other<br>
orientations are considered within the scope of the present invention. Alternatively<br>
to cutting, drilling, etc., grooves 26 may be pressed into outer surface 24 by a<br>
pressing-type device before the polymeric resin has been cured, or may be molded<br>
into outer surface 24 (such as when belt 16 is manufactured using a molding<br>
process). As is to be appreciated, other possible ways to form grooves 26 would<br>
readily be apparent to one skilled in the art. Note that while the term "grooves" is<br>
referred to, what is actually occurring is the creation of voids or void volume in the<br>
belt so as to receive the entrained liquid. Variation of such void volume in the belt<br>
can be achieved by varying the shapes, dimensions, spacing and orientation of the<br>
"grooves" or any combination thereof.<br>
Figure 3 is an exploded view of nip load zone 36 depicted in Figure 2.<br>
Figure 3 also shows an exploded view of first groove 42 and second groove 44 on<br>
outer surface 24. Note further that all numerical dimensions are used only for<br>
illustrative purposes and should by no means be considered exclusive.<br>
First groove 42 and second groove 44 have first depth 46 and second depth<br>
48, respectively. In addition, first groove 42 and second groove 44 have first<br>
outside width 50 and second outside width 52, and first inside width 54 and second<br>
inside width 56, respectively. Further, first groove 42 and second groove 44 may<br>
be continuous or discontinuous in the longitudinal direction. Also, first groove 42<br>
and second groove 44 may be separated between adjacent grooves by so-called first<br>
land area 58 and second land area 60. First land area 58 and second land area 60<br>
may be considered narrow pillars of cured polymeric resin running in the machine<br>
direction on the outer surface 24 of belt 16. First and second groove depths 46, 48<br>
may have values of about 1.10 mm and 1.5 mm, first inside and outside widths 54,<br>
50 may have values of about 0.85 mm and 1.18 mm, and second inside and outside<br>
widths 56,52 may have values of about 0.85 mm and 1.35 mm, respectively. First<br>
land area 58 and second land area 60 may have widths of about 2 mm and 1.88<br>
mm, respectively. As is to be appreciated, other shapes, dimensions, spacing, and<br>
orientation of first and/or second grooves 42, 44 and first and/or second land areas<br>
58,60 may be utilized and are considered to be within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, nip load zone 36 may include a center portion 64,<br>
intermediate portions 6(1, and outer portions 62. The grooves 26 of the center<br>
portion 64, the intermediate portions 66, and the outer portions 62 may have<br>
different sizes, orientations, shapes and/or depths or combinations thereof. For<br>
example, the center portion 64 may include grooves of a single width and depth;<br>
alternatively it may include a number of first grooves 42 and a number of second<br>
grooves 44. The grooves within the center portion 64 may be arranged in any<br>
manner. That is, the arrangement of such grooves could be a first groove 42<br>
followed by a second groove 44 followed by a first groove 42 and so forth, or a<br>
number of first grooves followed by a number of second grooves followed by a<br>
number of first grooves and so forth. Further, the center portion 64 may include<br>
grooves having more than two different sizes, orientations, shapes and/or depths<br>
which could be arranged in any combination. Additionally, one or both of the<br>
intermediate portions 66 and outer portions 62 may also include grooves having<br>
different sizes, shapes and/or depths and which may be arranged in any manner<br>
such as those previously described. Still further, an outer portion 62 or<br>
intermediate portion 66 may have a differing shape of groove from one side of the<br>
nip load zone 36 to the other.<br>
For example, the intermediate portions 66 may include a step-wise<br>
graduation of groove depth. As shown in Fig. 3, intermediate portion 66 includes<br>
grooves having an initial depth of about 1.4 mm at location 72, a depth of about 1.3<br>
mm at location 71, and a depth of 1.2 mm at location 70 changing in .10 mm<br>
increments every 460 mm. Such an arrangement may be particularly useful hi<br>
embodiments where the center portion 64 has grooves of a depth of about 1.5 mm,<br>
and an outer portion with grooves of a depth of 1.1 mm. This essentially results in<br>
an increase in the void volume in the center portion 64 which decreases as one goes<br>
to the outer portions 62. In short the groove arrangements and characteristics may<br>
be optimized to flatten or improve the existing CD moisture profile typically hi<br>
transitioning from a shorter depth in the outer portions to greater depths hi the<br>
center portion 64. Note that there may even be included areas of no grooves or a<br>
zero depth depending upon the moisture profile being adjusted for.<br>
Although the grooves have been described as having a cross-sectional shape<br>
such as that shown in Figure 3 and as being provided by cutting or forming, the<br>
present invention is not so limited. For example, the grooves may have other crosssectional<br>
shapes and may be obtained by other means. As an example, grooves 26<br>
may be provided by a cutting device (such as a drill-type device) which cuts or<br>
forms grooves in a spiral or orientation around the circumference of the belt in<br>
either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction which proceed in a substantially<br>
longitudinal direction, hi such a situation, grooves may be arranged in any<br>
combination. In one arrangement, one groove has a clockwise spiral cross-section<br>
followed by a groove having a counter-clockwise cross-section followed by a<br>
groove having a clockwise spiral cross-section and so forth. Further, each of the<br>
grooves 26 may not be perfectly parallel to the longitudinal direction, but may vary<br>
therefrom. Additionally, a number of grooves 26 may be oriented so as to run in a<br>
direction which forms an angle (such as up to 45 degrees) to a line parallel to the<br>
longitudinal direction.<br>
In essence, the principle involves changing the void volume of the grooves<br>
hi these zones (two edges and the center) such that, for example, the zone with<br>
lower available void volume will be able to accept less water. For example, in a<br>
typical "frown" CD sheet moisture profile, the sheet edges are drier than the center<br>
of the sheet. By reducing the void volume of the two edge areas of the belt, less<br>
water will be removed from the sheet in these areas, so the sheet moisture profile<br>
exiting the press nip will be flatter. Likewise, for a typical "smile" CD sheet<br>
moisture profile the void volume would be reversed.<br>
Modifications to the above would be obvious to those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art, but would not bring the invention so modified beyond the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br>
it<br><br><br><br><br>
