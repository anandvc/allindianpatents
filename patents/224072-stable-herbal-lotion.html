Background and Prior Art<br>
Plants have been the primary source of medicine for people of every culture throughout the world. Plants that are used as medicines have been referred to as "herbs" for over 4000 years by European and the Mediterranean cultures. There are several types of herbal medicine systems that are used today; European, Native American, Chinese, Ayurvedic and western herbalism are the most prevalent systems. Herbs have been used for centuries to provide for improved health and well-being of entire civilizations.<br>
Even today, nearly 50 % of the thousands of drugs commonly used and prescribed are either derived from a plant source or contain a chemical imitation of a plant compound. Aspirin is a chemical imitation of salicin from the bark of the white willow tree. Penicillin is a mold, an organism produced by the fungus, a primitive plant. Although synthetic drugs have certainly performed miracles and saved lives, virtually all of theses drugs have many side effects ranging from the unpleasant to the lethal. Herbs work synergistically with the body and without disturbing the natural balance of the body.<br>
Various topical analgesic formulations have been developed with analgesic drugs like aspirin as well as number of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Safer and effective transdermal analgesic formulations have been always area of research. There are various<br><br><br>
prior art available on transdermal analgesic formulations, few of them are mentioned below:<br>
United State application number US20030012830 discloses topical composition for the treatment of pain comprising by weight percent of the total weight of the composition: about 1 % to about 70 % of a salicylate-based compound; about 1 % to about 70 % acetone, about 1 % to 30 % of an emollient and about 10% to about 50 % menthol.<br>
US 6589543 describes herbal ointment for soothing aches and pains includes a mixture of clove oil, ginger oil, wintergreen oil, peppermint oil, ginger root powder, cayenne powder and petroleum jelly.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The composition of present invention comprises combination of volatile oils in an emulsified lotion form. It contains Peppermint ka tel (Mentha oil; Oil of Mentha Piperata), Nilgiri ka tel (Eucalyptus oil; Oil of leaves of plant Eucalyptus globulus), Wintergreen oil (Methyl Salicylate or Wintergreen oil extracted from leaves of plant Goultheria Procumbens), Lavang ka tel (Clove bud oil from plant myrtus caryophyllus), Dalchini ka tel (Cinnamon oil; oil of bark of plant Cinnamomum Cassia).<br>
Such volatile oil alone or in combinations is available in market either as oils to be applied as it is on the skin of affected part, or as ointments and balm but not the claimed composition. All these formulations are very oily and give greasy feeling. It is not very easy to wash off. Ointment and balm is thick, not very easily spreadable.<br><br><br>
The emulsified lotion form of these volatile oils in combination makes the composition of present invention a unique one. It is water based emulsified thin lotion. It is easy to spread and gives very fast effect. It is non greasy and also easy to wash off giving a cosmetic characteristic to composition. Such compositions provide enhanced skin penetration and achieve therapeutic levels in the target tissues.<br>
Lotion being liquid is easily spreadable, thus facilitates massage of painful muscles or joints, acts quickly and relieves pain, reduces swelling by improving blood flow in local area and enables more normal painless functions at work, home and during sports. Such a composition is advantageous with low dermal irritation and skin sensitization.<br>
This lotion is recommended in the treatment of chronic arthritis, osteoarthritis of knee joints, frozen shoulder, costo-chondral joint pain, low backache, soft tissue rheumatism and pulled muscles.<br>
The present herbal composition comprises volatile oils more particularly Peppermint ka tel 3 to 13 % w/v, Nilgiri ka tel 4 to 14 % w/v, Wintergreen oil 10 to 20 % w/v, Lavang ka tel 1 to 7 % w/v, Dalchini ka tel 1 to 7 % w/v.<br>
Further the present formulation is emulsified thin lotion which consist of volatile oil along with pharmaceutically acceptable lotion base such as emulsifiers, humectants, emollient, oil, thickener, preservatives which will help to quickly penetrate into the skin, not impart a greasy feel and effective pain killer in short time.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable lotion base:<br>
Lotion base is oil in water cream composition which is forming base for proposed herbal<br>
pain relief lotion. The said lotion base comprises raw materials which are given here.<br>
Emulsifier: Emulsions are physically unstable and therefore need to be stabilized. To prevent phase separation or to maintain the droplets on separate entities, emulsifiers or co-emulsifiers are often used in the lotion. These co-emulsifiers prevent the oil phase<br><br>
from coalescing or creaming and keep the emulsion stable; give the formulation its character as lotion by imparting viscosity to the composition The most important criterion in preparing an emulsion is to select suitable emulsifier. This selection is based on the emulsion type (oil/water or water/oil) and further emulsifier must be compatible with oil phase, water phase in the formulation. In this formulation, emulsifier is selected from anionic surfactants like polysorbate 80, polymeric surfactants like Arlacel PI35, fatty alcohols like cetyl alcohol and cetostearyl alcohol, polyglycol ethers like cetomacrogol 1000 or mixture thereof. The emulsifiers are particularly useful in the range of 1 to 15 % w/v, preferably 4 to 10 % w/v.<br>
Emollients: Performance of herbal lotion composition would be evaluated in terms of prevention of relief from dryness and ease of spreading.   This is achieved by adding emollient into it. In the present invention emollient is selected from silicon oil, cresmol DH, Arlamol E and humectants like propylene glycol and glycerin. Emollients are used in the range of 1 to 10 % w/v, preferably 2 to 5% w/v.<br>
Thickener / Viscosity modifier: The oil in water emulsions are generally of thin consistency. The thickeners with low dispersion property as well as minimum neutralization would be selected. In the present invention, the thickeners used are Microwax, Xanthun gum, Magnesium stearate, carboxy methyl cellulose, sodium salt of Carboxy methyl cellulose, Guargum, Hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose etc. The thickeners are used in the range of 0.1 to 8 % w/v, preferably 0.1 to 3 %.<br>
Chelating agent: Disodium edetate is water soluble chelating agent and has the property of surrounding a metal to form very stable complexes that help to keep such metals away in the product. Thus prevents product deterioration, chelating agent are used. In the present invention disodium edetate is used in the range of 0.01 to 0.1 % w/v, preferably 0.05 %.<br>
Preservatives: Preservatives are used to retard microbial (bacterial and fungal) contamination in the lotion. High water content makes suitable condition for microbial<br><br>
growth. The preservatives prevent any growth of micro-organisms in the product. The preservatives are selected from methyl paraben, propyl paraben, butyl paraben, imidayolidinyl urea, diagolidinyl urea, phenoxy ethanol, citric acid and ethanol.<br>
The preservatives are used in the range of 0.15 % to 0.7 % w/v, preferably 0.15 to 0.22 %<br>
w/v.<br>
Emulsion stabilizer like magnesium sulphate and magnesium stearate is used in the present invention. It is used in the range of 0.5 to 5 % w/v, preferably 1 % w/v. Magnesium stearate is added in the lotion as the lubricant and thickener also at the end<br>
Lubricants like silicone oil in the range 0.1 to 5 % can be used, preferably 0.1 to 2 % w/v. It gives very smooth emollient feel.<br>
Mineral oil is used in the range of 10 to 20 % w/v, preferably 15 % w/v.<br>
Purified water: The main ingredient of lotion is water which may be upto 50 % or more. The water in the present invention is purified water for pharmaceutical use.<br>
