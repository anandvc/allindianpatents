				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to hydrolysed graft copolymers and a process for the preparation<br>
thereof this invention further relates to hydrolysed graft copolymers for use as<br>
flocculating, viscosifiers and drag reducing agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are various types of known biodegradable flocculants, most of them are natural<br>
ones. Starch, Guar gum, algenic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl guar gum<br>
etc, are the natural flocculants. The synthetic flocculants are PAM, poly (ethylene oxide),<br>
poly (dially dimethyl ammonium chloride), poly (acrylic acid) etc. Synthetic polymers<br>
are much more effective than the natural polymers, which is attributed to the easy<br>
tailorabiliry of the man made polymers. But the biggest drawback is their shear<br>
degradability. However, thy great advantage of natural polymers over synthetic ones is<br>
their low cost, non-toxicity, biodegradabiiity and shear resistance characteristics.<br>
They were obtained from the crop products or from trees extruder. Some of them are also<br>
produced by microbial roots. Therefore, the quantities obtained are also limited by<br>
availability of the sources.<br>
These and other objections of the invention will be apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention is provided hydroiysed graft copolymers for use as<br>
flocculants, drag reducers and viscosifiers.<br>
According to this invention is further provided a process for the preparation of<br>
hydroiysed graft copolymers comprising preparing a solution of polysaccharide selected<br>
from carboxy-methylcellulose and amylopectin and adding acrylamide monomer thereto<br>
with stirring, followed by addition of a catalyst solution thereto and allowing the reaction<br>
to continue, to obtain the graft copolymers, followed by subjecting the graft copolymer to<br>
alkaline hydrolysis to obtain the hydroiysed graft copolymer.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the catalyst used may be compounds of inner-transition<br>
elements such as Cerium (IV) preferably cerric ammonium nitrate (CAN).<br>
The polysaccharide used may be amylopectin (AP) and carboxymethylcellulose, (CMC)<br>
and the acrylamide may be substituted or unsubstituted acrylamide compounds. The<br>
reaction is generally carried out at a temperature in the range of 25 to 35 oC, preferably<br>
30 °C and is conducted over 20 to 30 hrs, at atmospheric pressure.<br>
10 to 20 gms of acrylamide are used for every 2 to 2.5 gm of the polysaccharide. 0.8 to<br>
0% 2 x 10 -3 moles of CAN is used for every 0.4 to 0.6 gms of AP-g-PAM and 0.1 to 0.3<br>
x 10 -3 moles of CAN are used every 0.4 to 0.6 moles of CMC-g-PAM.<br>
Hydrolysis is carried out in the usual manner, using an alkali such as sodium hydroxide.<br>
The invention will now be explained in greater deatils with the help of the following non-<br>
limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Synthesis of CMC-g-PAM graft copolymer<br>
The applicants have synthesized CMC-g-PAM graft copolymer by grafting PAM onto the<br>
CMC backbone by using CAN (cerie ammonium nitrate) as initiator. First 2 gm of<br>
purified CMC was dissolved in 150 cc of distilled water in a conical flask- It was stirred<br>
with a magnetic stirrer and heated to 60 °C wife simultaneous stirring. It was cooled<br>
down to room temperature. Then, 10 to 20 gm of acrytamide was dissolved to 125 cc of<br>
distilled water and mixed with CMC solution. The mixture solution was stirred with a<br>
magnetic stirrer. The solution was then flushed with nitrogen gas for 25 minutes. At this<br>
stage desired quantity of 25 cc of CAN solution was added to the reaction mixture<br>
followed by further purging with nitrogen gas for 10 minutes. The reaction mixture was<br>
maintained at 28+0.1°C by immersing the flask in constant temperature bath. The<br>
reaction was allowed to continue for 24 hours. At the end of the reaction., the resulting<br>
polymer was taken into a IL beaker, where it. was made into homogenous slurry with<br>
further addition of distilled water. The graft copolymer was extracted by formamide and<br>
acetic acid mixture (1:1 by volume) in order to remove the homopolymer. The graft<br>
copolymer was taken in a 500 ml beaker. Then 200 ml of the solvent was added to it and<br>
then it was kept at 40 °C for 12 hours. After that the mixture was filtered using Buchner<br>
funnel. The residue is washed with same solvent mixture for ten times and in every time<br>
the filtrate was checked with acetone whether there was a precipitation of polyacrylamide<br>
or not. After washing, the graft copolymer was again washed with methanol to remove<br>
the solvent. It was then kept into methanol for 24 hours. After that it was dried in a<br>
vacuum over at 70 °C.<br>
Alkaline hydrolysis of CM-g-PAM<br>
.5 gm of CMC-g-PAM was dissolved in 500 cc of distilled water. Then, 25 ml to 100 ml<br>
of 1 (IN) KOH solution was added to it. The mixture solution was then placed in a<br>
thermostated water bath at specified temperature. After 1 hour, the content of the flask<br>
was taken out and poured into IL of ethyl alcohol. The product was filtered and washed<br>
with ethanol-water (70:30) and finally with ethanol. It was then dried.<br>
Synthesis of AP-g-PAM graft copolymer<br>
First 2.5 gm of amylopectin was put into a conical flask with 100 cc of distilled water. It<br>
was stirred with a magnetic stirrer and heated to 80 °C with simultaneous stirring. It was<br>
cooled down to room temperature. The 15 gm of acrylamide was dissolved in 75 cc of<br>
distilled water and was mixed with the amylopectin solution. Then the conical flask was<br>
fitted with the nitrogen inlet and outlet tubes and oxygen free nitrogen was purged<br>
through the solution for 20 minutes. At this stage, 25 cc of catalyst solution (0.22 g of<br>
CAN in 100 cc of distilled water) was added in the reaction mixture, followed by further<br>
purging with nitrogen for 10 minutes. Then the nitrogen inlet tube was taken out and the<br>
flask was sealed. The reaction was allowed to continue for 24 hours. At the end of the<br>
reaction, the resulting polymer was taken into a IL beaker, where it. was made into<br>
homogeneous slurry with further addition of distilled water. The reaction was terminated<br>
by adding sutured solution of hydroquiuone. The viscous polymer slurry was then<br>
precipitated by adding excess of acetone and then dried in a vacuum oven at. 60 °C.<br>
Finally it was pulverized and sieved.<br>
The unreacted homopolymer was removed by using formamide and acetic acid mixture<br>
(1:1 by volume) as above.<br>
Alkaline hydrolysis of AP-g-PAM<br>
In a similar way, we synthesized hydrolysed AP-g-PAM. It was also hydrolysed in<br>
similar way, by adding 1 (N) NaOH solution. At first 5 gm of AP-g-PAM was dissolved<br>
in 500 cc of distilled water. To this mixture 50 ml to 100 ml of 1 (N) NaOH solution was<br>
added. After 2 hours the content of the glask was poured into IL of ethyl alcohol. Finally<br>
it was precipitated with alcohol as above and dried.<br>
It has been observed that, this alkaline hydrolysed graft copolymer perform better<br>
fioceulation characteristics man the other biodegradable floceulants known earlier. It has<br>
been observed very recently that the shear viscosity of optimally hydrolysed<br>
polyacrylamide grafted amylopectin and carboxymethyl cellulose in several hundered<br>
times then the polyacrylamide grafted amylopectin and carboxymethyl cellulose.<br>
As amylopectin and carboxyamethyl cellulose are abundantly available from renewable<br>
resources, amylopectin and carboxymethyl cellulose based fiocculants, drag reducers and<br>
viscosifiers would go a long way in their applications for treatment of industrial effluents<br>
and various other technical applications at natural and international levels.<br>
