The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
    TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing polyurethane elastomer foams, and more particularly to a process for producing polyurethane elastomer foams for effective use as automobile elastomer parts such as auxiliary springs, etc. in the automobile suspension section.<br>
     BACKGROUND ART<br>
     	Polyurethane elastomer foams in a fine cellular structure have distinguished vibration damping property and shock absorbability, and are largely used as auxiliary springs, etc. in the automobile suspension section from the viewpoints of dynamic characteristics under a high load, durability and permanent set resistance.  Particularly, polyurethane elastomer foams based on 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate (NDI) have distinguished flex fatigue resistance characteristics, and thus are largely used in auxiliary spring positions, requiring high durability,  However, NDI is higher in material cost than other diisocyanate compounds, and also is higher in the reactivity, that is, it has a hard-to-handle problem.<br>
     	Breaking mechanism of automobile auxiliary springs seems to be due to heat generation of materials themselves caused by repeated flex transformations, resulting in a decrease in physical characteristics of materials exposed to the elevated temperature, and in ultimate generation of local cracking.  Thus, it is indispensable that the auxiliary spring materials having a distinguished durability must undergo no more reduction in physical properties even in high-temperature circumstances, the polyurethane molecular chains having a strong cross-linking structure must furthermore have a higher level dimensional structure.  However, the conventional processes such as butch mixing (one-shot method) of a diisocyanate with a high-molecular weight diol, and a chain extender (low-molecular weight diol), or preparation of prepolymer by reaction of a high-molecular weight diol with a diisocyanate in advance, followed by chain elongation by a low-molecular weight diol (prepolymer method) have been so far not successful in obtaining a higher level dimensional structure of polyurethane molecule chain having such a strong cross-linking structure from other aromatic diisocyanates than NDI.<br>

     DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
     PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing polyurethane elastomer foams having a high durability, particularly under a high load, even with a low-cost, easy-to-handle diisocyanate compound.<br>
     MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
The object of the present invention can be attained by a process for producing polyurethane elastomer foams, which comprises mixing an isocyanate-terminated prepolymer prepared by reaction of polyol with 3,3'-dimethylbiphenyl-4,4'-diisocyanate, with a foaming agent comprising a mixture of water, a low-molecular weight glycol having a molecular weight of 48-200, and a high-molecular weight glycol having a number average molecular weight Mn of 1000-3000, from stirring, thereby conducting foaming reaction.<br>
     EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Polyurethane elastomer foams produced by the present process can have physical characteristics even by using low-cost, easy-to-handle 3,3'-dimethylbiphenyl-4,4'-diisocyanate (tolydine diisocyanate : TODI) as a diisocyanate compound, equivalent to those of urethane elastomer foams produced by a high-cost NDI.  This is a distinguished effect of the present invention.<br>
Specifically, the elongation at break determined by holding a test piece at 100? for one hour and conducting a test of elongation at break at the same temperature, according to the ordinary rubber material elongation test procedure has been found to be 75% or more, equivalent to the elongation at break at the ordinary temperature.  That is, the present polyurethane elastomer foams have such characteristics as small reduction in physical characteristics at elevated temperatures.<br>
In the foaming curing reaction in the present process for producing polyurethane elastomer foams, it seems that hard segments initially grow by reaction of highly reactive water and a low-molecular weight glycol with an excessive amount of diisocyanate present in the urethane prepolymer, and then soft segment grow by reaction of a high-molecular weight glycol of low reactivity with the remaining isocyanate groups, resulting in chain elongation of hard segments and soft segments and progress of micro-phase separation, whereby physical cross-linkability can be enhanced.<br>
Thus, even polyurethane elastomer foams produced by reaction of low-cost diisocyanate compounds other than NDI with polyol can be effectively used as automobile elastomer parts, such as automobile springs, requiring high durability, etc., which have been so far regarded as unsuitable for such application.<br>
     BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
So long as the polyol is a long-chain, active hydrogen-terminated glycol having a number average molecular weight Mn of 500-4000, preferably 1000-3000, and a hydroxyl value of 30-150, preferably 40-100, any one of various polyester-based, polyether-based, polycarbonate-based, silicone-based, 1,4-polybutadiene-based, 1,2-polybutadiene-based, and castor oil-based polyols, or other polyols, or their mixtures can be used without any particular restriction.  Reason why Mn of the polyol is limited to 500-4000 is that, when Mn is less than 500, the flexibility of polyurethane elastomer foams will be deteriorated, so the foams will become brittle, whereas, when Mn is more than 4000, the hardness of polyurethane elastomer foams will be lowered, so the foams cannot have a sufficient material strength.<br>
Diisocyanate to react with the polyol is 3,3'-dimethylbiphenyl-4,4'-diisocyanate (TODI), which can be used in such a proportion that the isocyanate group is more than 1 to less than 5 equivalent, preferably less than 4 equivalent, on the basis of one equivalent weight of the OH group of the polyol.  When the diisocyanate component is used in such a proportion that the isocyanate group is one or less equivalent, no isocyanate-terminated prepolymer will be formed, whereas in a proportion of more than 5 equivalent, the hardness of polyurethane elastomer foams will be increased, so the foams will not be suitable for use as buffering parts.<br>
Reaction of a polyol with a diisocyanate can be carried out at about 90°to about 130? for about 15 minutes to about one hour to form a prepolymer.<br>
0.1-5.0 parts by weight, preferably 0.2-3.0 parts by weight, of water, 0.1-5.0 parts by weight, preferably 0.2-3.0 parts by weight, of a low-molecular weight glycol having a molecular weight of 48-200, preferably 62-160, and 0.5-70 parts by weight, preferably 1-50 parts by weight, of a high-molecular weight glycol having a number average molecular weight Mn of 1,000-3,000, preferably 1,000-2,000, can be used as a foaming agent on the basis of 100 parts by weight of isocyanate-terminated prepolymer.  Without the low-molecular weight glycol hard segments fail to grow, whereas without the high-molecular weight glycol soft segments fail to grow, so neither hard segments nor soft segments can attain chain elongation in any way, resulting in a failure in enhancement of physical cross-linkability.<br>
The low-molecular weight glycol for use herein includes, for example, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,4-bis(2-hydroxyethoxy)benzene, etc. and the high-molecular weight glycol for use herein includes, for example, preferably those belonging to the same category as used in the prepolymer formation, more preferably the same kinds of polyols, specifically ethylene adipate polyesterpolyol, ethylene butylene adipate polyesterpolyol, polytetramethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, etc.  Reason why Mn of the high-molecular weight glycol is limited to 1,000-3,000 is that, when Mn is less than 1,000, the flexibility-requiring soft segments fail to form, whereas, when Mn is more than 3,000, the foaming agent will be highly viscous, so their handling will be unpreferably hard to conduct.<br>
A foam-regulating agent as a component for determing a cellular structure such as a silicone foam-regulating agent can be preferably used together with the foaming agent in a proportion of usually 0.1-3.0 parts by weight, preferably 0.2-2.0 parts by weight, on the basis of 100 parts by weight of prepolymer.  In the polyurethanization reaction, an amine compound, etc. can be allowed to take part in the reaction as a catalyst.  Besides the afore-mentioned components, a filler, an oxide or hydroxide of divalent metal, a lubricant, etc. can be used, if required, upon proper combination.<br>
Polyurethanization reaction can be carried out by mixing the prepolymer with these foaming agent, foam-regulating agent, and catalyst, followed by cast molding in a mold of desired capacity.  After mold release, secondary cross-linking (annealing) is carried out preferably at about 80°to about 150? for about 5 to about 24 hours to obtain polyurethane elastomer foams.<br>
     EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention will be described in detail below, referring to Examples.  In each of Examples, Comparative Examples, and Reference Example, which follow, polyurethane elastomer foams were used and molded in the following conditions :<br>

     	COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
     In Example 1, the amount of TODI was changed to 30 parts by weight (NCO/OH equivalent ratio : 2.3), and while no ethylene adipate-based polyester polyol was used, the other components were used in the same amounts to prepare a foaming agent.<br>

Molded polyurethane elastomer foams produced by the present process have a higher level dimensional structure endowed with a high physical cross-linkability, and thus can maintain a strong rubbery elasticity even if exposed to surroundings where the material undergoes heat generation due to repeated compressions.  That is, they can be effectively used as automobile elastomer parts such as auxiliary spring materials in the automobile suspension section, requiring highly durable functions.<br>
Besides the afore-mentioned uses, they can be also used as parts of machines, automobiles, and precision units such as castors, rolls, packings, seal materials, vibration-damping parts, ball joints, etc.; as sport or leisure articles such as shoe soles, ski boots, snow chains, etc. or conveyor belt, keyboard sheets and gaskets ; and electric wiring such as automobile wiring, etc.; and rope coating, etc.<br><br>
