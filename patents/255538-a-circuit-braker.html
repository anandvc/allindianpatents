FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to variable-frequency drive with regeneration capacity. More<br>
particularly, the invention relates to a circuit braker controlling non-generative power cells when<br>
the load is in regenerative operation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] In recent years, circuits for medium- voltage variable frequency drive (VFD) applications<br>
have received attention. Several novel methods have been introduced in the past decade. For<br>
example, in a circuit comprising series-connected inverters as described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,625,545 to Hammond, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety,<br>
an inverter or power cell 110 includes a three-phase diode-bridge rectifier 112, one or more direct<br>
current (DC) capacitors 114, and an H-bridge inverter 116. The rectifier 112 converts the input<br>
118 alternating current (AC) voltage to a substantially constant DC voltage that is supported by<br>
the capacitors 114 that are connected across the rectifier 112 output. The output stage of the<br>
inverter 110 includes an H-bridge inverter 116 includes two poles, a left pole and a right pole,<br>
each with two devices. The inverter 110 transforms the DC voltage across the DC capacitors 114<br>
to an AC output 120 using pulse-width modulation (PWM) of the semiconductor devices in the<br>
H-bridge inverter 116.<br>
[0003] A circuit including power cells such as 110 in FIG. 1 , when connected to a load, such as<br>
a motor, can provide power from an input source to the motor when operating in the motoring<br>
mode. However, when the motor speed needs to be reduced, power from the motor needs to be<br>
absorbed by the inverter. This mode of operation, when power must be absorbed by the inventor,<br>
is referred to as the regeneration mode. The diode-bridge rectifiers 112 in each power cell do not<br>
allow power to be transferred back to the source. Hence, the power absorbed by the circuit is<br>
strictly limited by the losses in the inverter and the capacitors within each power cell and is<br>
usually in the range of about 0.2% to about 0.5% of rated power.<br>
[0004] The disclosure contained herein describes attempts to solve one or more of the problems<br>
described above.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] In an embodiment, a braking circuit includes an arrangement of<br>
power cells electrically connected to receive power from a source and deliver power<br>
to a load. The circuit includes a first rank of regenerative power cells, a second rank<br>
of non-regenerative power cells, and a control circuit. The output voltages of the<br>
regenerative power cells and non-regenerative power cells may be maintained at least<br>
substantially at their rated values when the load is operated at less than rated flux and<br>
less than rated current. The control circuit may at least substantially use the current<br>
capability of the regenerative power cells when the load is operated at rated flux and<br>
less than rated current. The control circuit may at least substantially use the current<br>
capability of the regenerative power cells and non-regenerative power cells when the<br>
load is operated at rated flux and full current. A voltage drop may occur across all of<br>
the cells during braking.<br>
[ 0 0 0 6 ] In some embodiments, each regenerative power cell may include an<br>
inverter bridge, a capacitor set electrically connected across terminals of the inverter<br>
bridge, and an active front end comprising a plurality of transistors electrically<br>
connected as a three-phase bridge. In an alternate embodiment, each regenerative<br>
power cell may include an inverter bridge, a capacitor set electrically connected<br>
across terminals of the inverter bridge, a three-phase diode bridge rectifier electrically<br>
connected across the terminals, and a series-connected transistor and resistor<br>
combination that is electrically connected across the terminals. In either embodiment,<br>
the inverter bridge may comprise, for example, a four-transistor H-bridge inverter or<br>
an eight-transistor H-bridge inverter based on a neutral-point-clamped connection.<br>
[0007] In some embodiments, each non-regenerative power cell may include<br>
an inverter bridge, a capacitor set electrically connected across terminals of the<br>
inverter bridge, and a three-phase bridge rectifier electrically connected across the<br>
terminals. This inverter bridge also may comprise, for example, a four-transistor H-<br>
bridge inverter or an eight-transistor H-bridge inverter based on a neutral-point-<br>
clamped connection. In some embodiments, the regenerative power cells and non-<br>
regenerative power cells are removably and interchangeably installed in a housing.<br>
[0008] In an alternate embodiment, an electrical device includes a plurality<br>
of single-phase power cells electrically connected to receive power from a source and<br>
deliver power to a load. The single-phase power cells include a first rank of<br><br>
regenerative power cells and a second rank of non-regenerative power cells. Each<br>
non-regenerative power cell may include an inverter bridge, a capacitor set<br>
electrically connected across terminals of the inverter bridge, and a three-phase bridge<br>
' rectifier electrically connected across the terminals. The non-regenerative power cells<br>
may provide reactive power when the plurality of cells are used for braking of a<br>
motor.<br>
[0009] In an alternate embodiment, an electrical device, includes a first rank<br>
that includes at least three single-phase non-regenerative power cells, a second rank<br>
that includes at least three single-phase regenerative power cells, and a control circuit.<br>
Each non-regenerative power cell includes an inverter bridge, a capacitor set<br>
electrically connected across terminals of the inverter bridge, and a three-phase bridge<br>
rectifier electrically connected across the terminals. When the device is used for<br>
braking of a motor, a three-phase power cell is not required, and the non-regenerative<br>
power cells provide reactive power.<br>

[0036] In various embodiments, a multi-level power circuit uses single-phase<br>
series-connected regenerative cell and non-regenerative cell inverters to provide<br>
limited braking capability. FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a circuit<br>
having such inverters. In FIG. 2, a transformer 210 delivers three-phase, medium-<br>
voltage power to a load 230 such as a three-phase induction motor via an array of<br>
single-phase inverters (also referred to as power cells). A three-phase inverter is not<br>
required in the array. The transformer 210 includes primary windings 212 that excite<br>
a number of secondary windings 214 - 225. Although primary winding 212 is<br>
illustrated as having a star configuration, a mesh configuration is also possible.<br><br>
Further, although secondary windings 214 - 225 are illustrated as having a mesh<br>
configuration, star-configured secondary windings are possible, or a combination of<br>
star and mesh windings may be used. Further, the number of secondary windings<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2 is merely exemplary, and other numbers of secondary windings<br>
are possible. The circuit may be used for medium voltage applications or, in some<br>
embodiments, other applications.<br>
[0037] Any number of ranks of power cells are connected between the<br>
transformer 210 and the load 230. A "rank" is considered to be a three-phase set, or a<br>
group of power cells established across each of the three phases of the power delivery<br>
system. Referring to FIG. 2, rank 250 includes power cells 251-253, rank 260<br>
includes power cells 261-263, rank 270 includes power cells 271-273, and rank 280<br>
includes power cells 281-283. Fewer than four ranks, or more than four ranks, are<br>
possible. A central control system 295 sends command signals to local controls in<br>
each cell over fiber optics or another wired or wireless communications medium 290.<br>
[0038] As mentioned above, the prior art power cells such as those<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1 do not allow any significant amount of regeneration. In order to<br>
achieve the desired braking capability in the embodiments described herein, alternate<br>
power cells are used. FIGs. 3A and 3B show two embodiments of power cells that do<br>
permit regeneration. Referring to FIG. 3A, a power cell 300 includes an active front<br>
end 310 that serves as a three-phase bridge as it receives power from dedicated three-<br>
phase secondary windings of the transformer via an input 342. The cell 300 also<br>
includes a plurality of current-controlling devices such as transistors or thyristors 312<br>
- 317, for example insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), integrated gate<br>
commuted thyristors or other devices, generally referred to herein as the front-end<br>
transistors. Although six transistors in a bridge format - in this example, three pairs<br>
of two transistors each connected in parallel across the DC terminals - are illustrated<br>
in FIG. 3A, other numbers of transistors may be used. These transistors can be<br>
controlled by a local and remote control system (292 and 295, respectively, in FIG. 2)<br>
to transfer energy in either direction thus allowing motoring or regenerating to full<br>
capacity (i.e., approximately or fully 100%). Any suitable method to achieve such<br>
operation with front-end transistors may be used. The remainder of the power cell<br>
300 includes one or more capacitors 320 and an H-bridge inverter 330, each<br>
connected across the output or DC terminals of the active front end 310, to deliver AC<br><br>
power to the output 344. Other inverter bridges may be used as substitutes for the<br>
four-transistor H-bridge 330 illustrated in FIG. 3A. For example, an H-bridge<br>
comprising eight transistors based on the neutral-point clamped connection may be<br>
used.<br>
[0039] In an alternate embodiment, FIG. 3B illustrates a power cell 350<br>
which includes the elements of a rectifier 360, capacitors 375, and an inverter bridge<br>
such as an H-bridge inverter 380 connected in parallel between an input 392 and<br>
output 394. A three-phase diode bridge rectifier 360 receives power from dedicated<br>
three-phase secondary windings of the transformer via the input 392. In addition, a<br>
brake circuit 370 includes a transistor 374 (referred to herein as a brake transistor) and<br>
a resistor 372 electrically connected in series with respect to each other and in parallel<br>
across the DC capacitors 375 and the DC output of the rectifier 360. The brake<br>
transistor 374 is controlled by a local controller, and during motoring the brake<br>
transistor 374 is controlled to be "off and does not participate in the energy transfer<br>
from the AC input 392 to the AC output 394. However, during regenerating the brake<br>
transistor 375 may be controlled to turn on and off in order to dissipate the energy<br>
from the motor in the resistor 372 and hence maintain the DC voltage across the<br>
capacitors 375 at a pre-determined value.<br>
[0040] A power cell that allows power to be absorbed from the motor is<br>
referred to herein as a regenerative cell (RC), and a power cell that does not allow any<br>
significant amount of regeneration (such as the one shown in FIG. 1 and is described<br>
above) is referred to as a non-regenerative cell (NRC). Although two examples of<br>
RCs are shown in FIGs. 3A and 3B, other RC cells may be used in the embodiments<br>
described herein.<br>
[0041] Thus, referring back to FIG. 2, ranks 250 and 270 may comprise<br>
regenerative cells, and ranks 260 and 280 may comprise non-regenerative cells, or<br>
vice-versa. It should be noted that the number of cells per phase depicted in FIG. 2 is<br>
exemplary, and more than or less than four ranks may be possible in various<br>
embodiments. For example, two ranks, four ranks, eight ranks, or other numbers of<br>
ranks are possible. In fact, the number of regenerative power cells used can be<br>
selected based on the desired degree of braking provided. In addition, the power cells<br>
may be removably installed in a housing so that a single housing unit may be used for<br>
various applications, with regenerative cells being exchanged for non-regenerative<br><br>
cells, or vice versa, depending on the desired application such as braking or<br>
regeneration desired.<br>
[0042] To obtain full regeneration capability for a circuit such as that shown<br>
in FIG. 2, RCs may be used in the entire circuit of power cells. However, in many<br>
applications, the braking capability that is needed is a much smaller fraction of the<br>
rated capacity of the load, such as approximately 10 percent to approximately 20% for<br>
ship propulsion and large fan applications. The use of RCs in the entire circuit makes<br>
the solution more expensive than it needs to be. However, we have discovered an<br>
exemplary series-connected arrangement of inverters that provides limited, but not<br>
full, braking capability.<br>
[0043] Referring to FIG. 4, a series-connected arrangement of inverters can<br>
be used to connect both RCs and NRCs within the same circuit. A first rank 410<br>
includes three single-phase NRCs 411, 412 and 413 (one cell for each phase in a<br>
three-phase circuit), while a second rank 420 includes three single-phase RCs 421,<br>
422 and 423 (also one for each phase). In this embodiment, three-phase power cells<br>
are not required. Each cell receives power from dedicated secondary windings of an<br>
input transformer (210 in FIG. 2). For each phase, a first output terminal of each RC<br>
cell is electrically connected to the output terminal of opposite polarity for the phase's<br>
corresponding NRC cell. The second output terminal of each RC cell is electrically<br>
connected to an output line. The remaining output terminals of all three RC cells in<br>
the rank are electrically connected to each other to form a star point 440. As shown in<br>
FIG. 2, additional ranks, such as four ranks total, six ranks total, eight ranks total, or<br>
more, may be present in the circuit. The number of ranks of RCs selected may be<br>
determined based on the desired level of regeneration required.<br>
[0 044] In some embodiments, the circuit may include a bypass feature that<br>
allows continued operation of the circuit if one or more of the power cells should fail.<br>
For example, as illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 5,986,909, and in particular FIG. 1B<br>
and the accompanying text, which are incorporated herein by reference, a bypass may<br>
create a shunt path between the output lines of a power cell if the cell fails so that<br>
current can then flow through the bypass instead of the power cell.<br>
[0045] During motoring, the RC ranks and NRC ranks may provide a<br>
substantially equal amount of power to the load. However, during regeneration, the<br>
diode-bridge rectifiers in the NRC prevent transfer of power to the utility, but front-<br><br>
end transistors (AFE) in the RCs are controlled to absorb the braking energy by<br>
transferring power from the load (such as a motor) to the input source. The control of<br>
the front-end transistors may be the same as or similar to known control methods,<br>
such as the regulation of the DC-voltage within each RC. However, control of the<br>
output H-bridges may require different methods. For example, FIG. 4A illustrates<br>
exemplary voltage and current vectors during motoring, while FIG. 4B illustrates<br>
exemplary voltage and current vectors during regeneration. When motoring, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4A, the output voltage vectors of cell 1 (an RC) and cell 2 (an<br>
NRC) are along the motor voltage. Each power cell provides an equal or substantially<br>
equal amount of power to the load. Referring to FIG. 4B, during regeneration the<br>
voltage of cell 2 (NRC) is controlled to be in quadrature with respect to the drive<br>
current. This prevents cell 2 from absorbing any real (or active) power. However, the<br>
output of cell 1 (RC) must make up the difference between the motor voltage and the<br>
output of cell 2. This restricts the amount of available voltage that the drive can<br>
produce and will require reduced flux operation at high speeds during regeneration.<br>
When a mixture of NRC and RC are used, as shown in FIG. 4, maximum braking<br>
torque is obtained when the NRC and RC voltages are also in quadrature to each other<br>
as shown in FIG. 5C. Although it is noted that a quadrature relationship (of 90<br>
degrees) is desired to maintain zero power flow into the NRC cells, for practical<br>
implementation this angle may be reduced below 90 degrees to ensure that either no<br>
power flows into the NRC cells or some power flows out of the NRC cells.<br>
[0046] The approach of having both sets of cells (NRC and RC) generate<br>
voltages during the entire braking process allows for continuous braking during the<br>
entire speed range. Unlike prior art methods, the methods described herein can<br>
produce regenerative torque before the motor speed has dropped below the voltage<br>
capability of the RC. The cells' output voltages are substantially used (with normal<br>
system losses) to provide power to the motor when the motor is running at or near its<br>
rated speed. When the motor voltage is reduced (as for braking), the NRCs and RCs<br>
also participate so that the NRCs provide reactive power during braking, and current<br>
is reversed through the RCs. This, unlike the prior art, all cells can participate during<br>
braking.<br>
[0047] For the purpose of the following discussion, the following symbols<br>
are defined on a per-unit basis as follows:<br><br>
Voltage capability of the RC, VRC = x per-unit<br>
Voltage capability of the NRC, VNRC = (1-x) per-unit<br>
Total voltage capability of drive =1.0 per-unit<br>
No-load current of motor = INL<br>
Speed below which rated flux can be applied on the motor = Wv<br>
Speed below which rated current can be applied to the motor = WI<br>
Braking torque capability = TB<br>
Torque current = Iqs<br>
Magnetizing current = IdS<br>
Motor speed = w<br>
Motor voltage = Vmotor<br>
[ 0048 ] To understand operation of an exemplary drive circuit with limited<br>
braking capability, the entire operating speed range may be considered to include<br>
three speed ranges as described below. During each speed range, there may be a<br>
separate limit on the achievable braking torque. This limit depends on the relative<br>
voltage capabilities of the RC and the NRC and the magnetizing current of the motor.<br>
Although the description below is in the context of an induction motor, similar results<br>
may be achieved with a synchronous motor by operating at reduced voltage on stator<br>
side. Although the total voltage capability of the drive is described below as having a<br>
unit value of 1.0, this value can be different from 1.0 as long as x is less than that<br>
value.<br>
[0049] Speed range # 1: wv 
[ 0050 ] In this speed range, the drive cannot operate the motor at rated flux,<br>
because of the requirement to operate the NRC cell at quadrature with the motor<br>
current. Hence, the motor is operated at reduced flux and reduced current. Referring<br>
to FIG. 6, the maximum voltage output is given as:<br>
[0051]Vmax = √(1-2x + 2x2)	(1)<br><br>
[0052] To increase or obtain maximum possible torque within this speed<br>
range, the motor may be operated at or near this maximum voltage. Therefore, the<br>
voltages for the cells are fixed at VRC = x, and VNRC = (1 - x). As speed decreases<br>
from rated speed, motor flux gradually increases until it equals its rated value at w =<br>
wv. Hence, in per-unit terms, Wv = Vmax. FReferring again to FIG. 6, torque current is<br>
obtained as:<br>
[0053]Iqs=x Ids/(1-x)	(2)<br>
[0054] At rated speed the (minimum) braking torque capability then may be<br>
given by the following equation:<br>
[0055] TB = Vmax Iqs =INL (1 -2x + 2x2) x / (1 - x)	(3)<br>
[0056] where, it is assumed that at light loads and reduced flux Id = INL Vmax<br>
[0057] Speed range # 2: wI<w></w>
[0058] In this speed range, the motor is operated at rated flux but reduced<br>
current, and the RC provides rated output. Hence, referring to FIG. 7:<br>
[0059] VRC = x, and VNRC = √(w2 -x2), where w represents the speed and the<br>
per-unit motor voltage,<br>
(4)<br>
[ 0060] and Iqs = x Ids/√(w2 - x2)	(5)<br>
[0061] As speed decreases, Iq becomes larger and approaches rated torque<br>
current. When w = WI (where w1 = x/PF_rated), rated current is applied to the motor<br>
and rated braking torque can be obtained.<br>
[0062] Speed range #3: 0<w></w>
[0063] In this speed range, the motor is operated at rated flux and rated<br>
current. The voltages from the NRC and the RC are reduced linearly with speed as<br>
shown below, so that motor current is maintained at rated:<br>
[0064] VRC = x w/wI	(6)<br>
[0065] VNRC = w √(wI2 - x2) / wI.	(7)<br>
[0066] The above equations show exemplary methods for controlled<br>
operation of the RCs and NRCs during regeneration. A block diagram showing an<br>
exemplary control system 800 to implement such equations in a typical motor drive<br>
controller is given in FIG. 8. In this figure, the "Flux Reference Generator" 805,<br>
"Limited Regen Voltage Allocation" 810 and "Regen Limit" 815 help to provide<br>
limited regeneration control. As shown in the figure, the exemplary circuit includes at<br><br>
least two inputs, the flux demand λDMD 801 and the speed reference wref 802. The Flux<br>
Reference Generator 805 calculates the flux reference using the maximum voltage<br>
given by equation (1) above and the stator frequency, ws 804, and provides the flux<br>
reference,λref 803, as an output. The Flux Reference Generator 805 also ensures that<br>
the flux reference is always less than or equal to the flux demand, ΛDMD 801. The Flux Regulator 820 compensates for the difference between the flux reference, λref 803, and<br>
the flux feedback, ΛDS 809, where ΛDS 809 is the estimated actual flux value given by<br>
the measured motor voltage and the stator speed. The output of Flux Regulator 820 is<br>
the motor magnetizing current reference, Ids 821.<br>
[0067] The speed reference, wref 802, is compared with the motor speed, w<br>
850, in the Speed Regulator 855, which provides the motor torque current reference,<br>
IqS ref 858 as the output. When the motor is commanded to slow down, the Regen<br>
Limit block 815 calculates equations (2) and (5) above and provides a limit on the<br>
torque current reference.<br>
[0068] The circuit shown in FIG. 8 includes two Current Regulators 860 and<br>
862 that control the magnetizing current and the torque current. Their outputs are<br>
voltage references, Vds ref 863 and VqS.rcf 861. The Limited Regen Voltage Allocation<br>
810 block splits the motor voltage references, Vds ref 863 and Vqs.ref 861, into voltage<br>
references for the RCs and NRCs. In the Limited Regen Voltage Allocation 810<br>
block, the magnitude of the voltages for RC and NRC may be first found using x,<br>
Vmotor and ws from equations (4), (6) and (7) above. Then, the d- and q-axis<br>
components of the voltage commands for the NRCs and the RCs (VqdsNRc 868 and<br>
VqdsRC 869) are identified using Ids ref, and IqS ref. Finally, d- and q-axis components of<br>
VRC and VNRC are converted to 3-phase voltages in the stationary frame, and are<br>
used as references to generate PWM voltage commands for controlling the inverters.<br>
[0069] FIGs. 9A - 9D provide exemplary simulation results to show the<br>
operation in regeneration for a drive configuration such as that shown in FIG. 4 with x<br>
= 0.5 (i.e. an equal number of RCs and NRC's). It should be noted that having an<br>
equal number of RCs and NRCs is not a requirement of the embodiments described<br>
herein. The drive may be commanded to go into regeneration at t = 5 seconds by<br>
decreasing the speed reference wref.<br>
[0070] FIGs. 9A and 9B illustrate exemplary motor speed (FIG. 9A) and<br>
the output voltage (FIG. 9B) of a drive having a combination of RC and NRC ranks.<br><br>
In each Figure, time=0 to time=5 seconds represents motoring, while the remaining<br>
time periods represent different speed ranges of braking. Unlike the prior art, as<br>
illustrated in FTGs. 9A-9B, a voltage drop is present across the non-regenerative<br>
power cells during braking. In fact, such a voltage is present during the entire braking<br>
period.<br>
[0071] Referring to FIG. 9B, during Speed Range #1, the drive output<br>
voltage is maintained at the value specified by the equation (1) while the output<br>
voltage of RC and NRC are held at their respected rated values (i.e. 100%). In the<br>
Speed Range #2, the voltage of NRC is reduced whereas the voltage of RC is<br>
maintained at its rated voltage as given by the equation (4). As soon as the motor<br>
speed enters Speed Range #3, the voltage of both RC and NRC decreases linearly as<br>
the motor slows down as specified by equations (6) and (7).<br>
[0072] FIG. 9C shows exemplary motor current components during<br>
regeneration. In Speed Range #1, the magnetizing current (IDS) is lowered to satisfy<br>
the maximum motor voltage specified by the equation (1). Subsequently, the torque<br>
current (IQS) is also reduced so that the motor current remains in quadrature with<br>
respect to the output voltage of NRC as shown in FIG. 6. Throughout Speed Range<br>
#1, both the magnetizing current and the torque current increase equally in ratio so as<br>
to bring up the motor flux towards its rated value (i.e., approximately 100%) while<br>
maintaining the power factor and keeping the quadrature relation between the motor<br>
current and the output voltage of the NRC cells. During Speed Range #2, there is<br>
more room to accommodate the larger torque current as the voltage of NRC<br>
decreases, as evident from FIG. 7. As was mentioned earlier, Speed Range #3 starts at<br>
the instant when the total motor current reaches its rated value.<br>
[0073] FIG. 9D shows active power delivered from the drive, the RC cells<br>
and the NRC cells. The active power from the NRC remains substantially zero<br>
throughout the duration of motor deceleration. In this example, all of the active<br>
power (or total power) from the motor is absorbed by the RC, thereby illustrating that<br>
the methods described herein may successfully divert all the power absorbed from the<br>
motor into the RC during regeneration. In addition, the generated power in the motor<br>
is controlled to be less than the power rating of RC.<br>
[0074] As noted above, there may be a different number of RCs and NRCS<br>
than the examples expressly described above. When the combination of RCs to NRCs<br><br>
is changed, the value of braking torque at full speed also may change according to<br>
equation (3). This is tabulated in the following table of braking torque for different<br>
cell combinations, assuming motor no-load current, INL, equals 25%:<br><br>
[0 07 5] As noted above, when the bypass feature is provided with each of the<br>
power cells, then it is possible to operate the circuit if one or more of the power cells<br>
fail. Under such a condition, the equations provided above can still be applied, but<br>
with slight adjustments as detailed here. When one or more power cells are bypassed,<br>
the total voltage capability of the RC and the NRC may change to y and z,<br>
respectively, such that t = y + z. The same procedure as detailed in equations (1) - (7)<br>
above may be followed using t, y, z instead of 1.0, x, and 1-x to determine the<br>
operation of the control with a smaller number of power cells in the circuit.<br>
[0076] Still other embodiments will become readily apparent to those skilled<br>
in this art from reading the above-recited detailed description and drawings of certain<br>
exemplary embodiments. It should be understood that numerous variations,<br>
modifications, and additional embodiments are possible, and accordingly, all such<br>
