				<td>This invention relates to a combined/integrated hair oil dispenser and scalp<br>
massaging device to be used to apply hair oil or hair tonic and also to be used as scalp<br>
massager.<br>
Presently, the use of hair oil/hair tonics suffer from the disadvantage that the<br>
contents of the bottle need to be poured onto the palm of one's hand or directly on to<br>
the scalp resulting in a process that is impractical usually resulting in excess use of the<br>
product while at the same time causing spillage which may drip on to the user's clothe<br>
or floor thereby spilling clothes, floors and carpets. Thus users suffer from the<br>
disadvantage that the tonic/ oil is not easily applied to the hair without spilling or<br>
creating a mess or applying inappropriate quantities and without being obliged to<br>
manually rub the oil or tonic on to the scalp.<br>
The invention offers a more convenient and practical use and application of<br>
hair oil/ hair tonics and one which may be used at any time without facing spillage or<br>
dirtying the clothe or floor. Further it helps to improve circulation in the scalp,<br>
accomplish invigoration and stimulate hair growth.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
US Patent 5421799 by Rabin et al, describes a scalp massager which utilizes a<br>
rigid but yet bendable main supporting frame which is to be mounted on a human<br>
head and extend from the nape to the forehead. A vibrator is to be mounted exteriorly<br>
on the main supporting frame. Interiorly mounted on the main supporting frame is a<br>
ma parietal pad assembly with there also being mounted a temporal pad assemble and<br>
an occiput pad assembly mounted on the main supporting frame. Each of these pad<br>
assemblies are s=designed to come into contact with the corresponding areas of a<br>
human head. Each of these pad assemblies is designed to be adjustable on the main<br>
supporting frame so as to accommodate different sizes of human heads.<br>
US Patent 5277174 by Schmidhauser, describes a scalp massager comprising<br>
a helmet is provided with three first fixed contact points contacting the scalp of the<br>
user located in the vicinity of the summit of the helmet. It comprises further three<br>
second contact points one in the frontal zone of the helmet and the other ones in the<br>
parieto-temporal zones of said helmet, these second contact points comprising an<br>
inflating pump and a valve permitting to apply them against the scalp with an<br>
adjustable , determined, pressure. Finally, the helmet comprises further an eccentric<br>
driven in rotation by a motor.<br>
US Patent 4807604 by Canela, describes a scalp massaser connected to a tap<br>
water supply, such as a shower head, through a flexible conduit. The massager<br>
includes a pulsating water shower head that is slidably mounted along a plurality of a<br>
locking nut for adjusting and setting the shower head in a given position to constantly<br>
apply the pulsating water over an area of the user's scalp.<br>
US Patent 4506659 by Chester, describes a massaging device for the scalp<br>
includes a pair of massaging elements which frictionally engage the scalp and are<br>
reciprocated with respect to each other in a generally horizontal direction with respect<br>
to the head resulting in moving relatively large areas of the scalp with respect to the<br>
skull and also with respect to each other and thereby substantially duplicate the<br>
massaging action obtained with the usual hand massage. All the foregoing prior art<br>
scalp massagers are specific and specialized scalp massagers involving helmets for<br>
wearing by the users and consisting several supportive assemblies for working of the<br>
massagers. Such massagers are not suitable for day to day or frequent use due to<br>
complicacy of functions. Further these features do not permit and are not effective as<br>
hair oil/tonic dispenser.<br>
US Patent 4090522 by Donley, et al also describes a comb for applying<br>
medication to the hair and scalp; the comb being hollow so to contain the medication,<br>
and the comb teeth each having a central opening extending to the tooth tip so that as<br>
the comb is combed through the hair, the medication is dispensed out of the tip of the<br>
teeth and massaged into the scalp. But this feature is basically a improved version of<br>
comb and the medication has to be previously stored in the inner container prior to<br>
use.<br>
The Known art in the category of combined hair oil/ tonic dispenser cum scalp<br>
massager, thus , does not provide a simple to use yet effective mechanism whereby<br>
hair oil/ tonic can be more easily applied and scalp massaging is achieved by<br>
improved circulation for accomplishing invigoration and stimulation of scalp.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a new device of hair oil/ tonic dispenser and<br>
massager for easy yet effective use.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a scalp massager for massaging scalp<br>
with hair oil / tonic.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a scalp massager which helps to improve<br>
circulation in the scalp as well as accomplish invigoration and stimulate the scalp and<br>
permit greater efficiency and effective use of Hair oil/ Hair Tonic.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT IN<br>
REFERENCE TO DRAWING<br>
This new device is to be used for scalp massaging and the efficient application of Hair<br>
oil to the scalp. In reference to the accompanying drawings fig.1 to fig 9, the various<br>
essential components of the device is described below—<br>
The device consists of 10 components. Main body holds Hair Oil/Tonic and the core<br>
part to support the other components.<br>
Top cover serves as cover to the body and consists of piston mechanism assembly in<br>
it.<br>
Bottom cover is the main component to transfer Hair oil/Tonic from body to brush,<br>
otherwise same as top cover.<br>
Piston fixed to the top cover as stated above and sponge brush inserted into the<br>
bottom cover.<br>
Components:<br>
1 .Body: A nylon bar (readily available in the commercial market), of 40mm diameter<br>
is used to produce this component. The inner hole is to be of smooth finish, for the<br>
disc (4) to slide through the wall. This is to be machined with close tolerance to avoid<br>
escaping of hair oil through the gap. Inner threaded porting is providing for fixing the<br>
top cover (2). A recess is provided below the threaded portion to hold a rubber O ring<br>
(9) to seal the gap between threaded portion and bottom of the top cover (2).<br>
2. Top Cover: Nylon disc tope component of 40 mm diameter and 10 mm thickness.<br>
External threaded portion gets screwed to the body in its match threading. A rubber O<br>
ring (9) is kept in its slot in the body (1) as a seat to the cover (2), to seal the screw<br>
tap. Inner threaded hole is meant for the screw (5), acts as piston rod. The screwing<br>
and unscrewing allows the screw to move up or down. This component also serves as<br>
lid for the body to fill the hair oil/hair tonic.<br>
3. Bottom Cover: The material and construction is same as the top cover. Instead of<br>
threaded hole in the center, 10 numbers of recesses of 8 mm diameter and 5 mm<br>
depth, to accommodate sponge brush (7) is provided. Further the recesses are drilled<br>
with 6mm diameter through holes for the passage of Hair oil / Tonic from the body<br>
(1). This component also is threaded to the body (1) with a O ring (9) seat, similar to<br>
the top cover (2).<br>
4. Disc: This is a thin nylon washer type component slides in the body inner surface.<br>
Outer and inner surface. Outer and inner surfaces are to be machined smooth for<br>
sliding with close tolerance, to avoid hair oil seepage. Stainless steel screw (5) gets<br>
fixed to the center and the disc is free to rotate over the screw.<br>
5 Screw: A stainless steel screw, threaded in two steps, (one foe fixing the top cover<br>
and end thread for fixing the knob (6). A smooth step adjacent to the head is meant for<br>
the disc. It is secured by an external circlip (8). The disc is free to rotate on the screw<br>
(5). This assembly is fixed to the top cover.<br>
6. Knob: It is nylon ball shaped component, fixed to the screw (5) end. The knob is<br>
twisted to clock wise direction to apply pressure to the oil surface through the disc (4).<br>
7. Brush: A soft sponge cylindrical component, of ten numbers inserted in to the<br>
bottom cover it its recesses. The material is of latex rubber or polyurethane, similar to<br>
the material used for the mattress. This is the core component to absorb hair oil from<br>
the body and to pass to the scalp when gently pressed over it. The brush (7), as shown<br>
in Fig.9, is of cylindrical dispensing Hair oil/Tonic. The plastic nozzle head will<br>
release a small amount of Hair oil/Tonic as required.<br>
The assembly can also include / consist of, a rubber neck/ brace attached to a flexible<br>
nozzle head. The expandable rubber brace will allow the hair tonic dispenser to be<br>
stretched to fit over the top of a container or bottle holding the oil. The plastic nozzle<br>
head will release a small amount of the hair tonic. At the same time, while applied to<br>
the head or scalp, the outside of the assembly comprising of pressure points (brushes)<br>
may be massaged on the scalp. The expandable rubber brace however is not an<br>
essential part of the device since the device can function independently of the rubber<br>
brace/neck.<br>
The assembly can also be used as a paint dispenser.<br>
From the foregoing description of the hair oil dispenser and scalp massager assembly,<br>
it is evident that numerous deviations of the assembly may be possible while keeping<br>
intact the basic configuration and the principle of action.<br>
