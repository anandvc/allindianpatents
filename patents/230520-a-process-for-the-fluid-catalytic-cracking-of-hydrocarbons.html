				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of<br>
hydrocarbon feeds in a downflow reactor using a specified cracking catalyst.<br>
FCC processes are well known. In the more usual FCC processes employing<br>
riser reactors the catalyst and the hydrocarbon feed flow upward, while in FCC<br>
processes employing downflow reactors the catalyst and the hydrocarbon feed<br>
flow downward.<br>
In riser reactors solids flow upward due to the lift caused by the ascending<br>
vaporised feed. However, the velocity of the hydrocarbon feed is lower near the<br>
wall than it is near the centre of the reactor. Therefore, the catalyst will move<br>
more slowly near the reactor wall than near the centre, resulting in a slower<br>
moving area with a high catalyst density near the wall and a low-resistance path<br>
of ascending feed near the centre. Hence, the feed mainly flows through the<br>
centre, whereas the catalyst is mainly located near the walls. The resulting flow<br>
pattern is called core-annulus.<br>
Furthermore, the upward flow of solid catalyst and hydrocarbon vapour in riser<br>
reactors opposes gravity, resulting in a catalyst flow that is significantly slower<br>
than the much lighter hydrocarbon flow. The ratio of feed velocity to catalyst<br>
velocity, i.e. the slip factor, generally is about 2-3. This results in backmixing of<br>
the catalyst, leading to longer residence times of the catalyst and the<br>
occurrence of undesirable secondary reactions (overcracking).<br>
In contrast to riser reactors, downflow reactors do not display large differences<br>
in velocity and catalyst density between the centre and the wall of the reactor.<br>
Furthermore, as the catalyst particles do not oppose gravity, the difference in<br>
velocity between the catalyst flow and the hydrocarbon flow in these reactors is<br><br>
smaller than in riser reactors. The slip factor of downflow reactors generally is<br>
about 1.<br>
Consequently, backmixing is largely avoided, the catalyst is distributed more<br>
evenly across the entire reactor, and the effective contact time of the catalyst<br>
and the feed in a downflow reactor is less than in a riser reactor. Although this<br>
reduces the formation of by-products, it also results in a decrease In the<br>
conversion of mainly the larger, higher-boiling compounds.<br>
For prior art publications dealing with cracking units comprising downflow<br>
reactors, reference is made to US 5.449,496, US 5,582,712, US 6,099,720, US<br>
5,660,716, US 5,951,850, and EP 0 254 333.<br>
Of these publications only a few focus on optimising the process by way of<br>
using a specified catalyst. In U.S. 5,660,716 use is made of a low acidity<br>
catalyst. It is recommended to use it in conjunction with high temperatures and<br>
high catalyst-to-oil ratios to obtain acceptable conversion levels. A similar<br>
teaching - including the use of catalyst-to-oil ratios of 25 to 80 w/w % - is<br>
contained in U.S. 5,951,850, in which it is recommended to use a catalyst<br>
containing a zeolite having a unit cell size of at most 24.50 Angstroms. The high<br>
catalyst-to-oil ratio may jeopardize the performance of the unit as far as catalyst<br>
separation, stripping, and regeneration capabilities are concerned. Moreover,<br>
wear of the equipment caused by the catalyst may become critical.<br>
In sum, the teachings of the prior art tend into the direction of using low activity<br>
catalysts in conjunction with high temperatures and high catalyst-to-oil ratios to<br>
compensate for the lower catalyst activity.<br>
The present invention provides a process for cracking hydrocarbon feeds which<br>
combines the advantages of downflow and riser reactors: minimal overcracking<br>
and high conversion of the higher-boiling fraction.<br>
The process comprises the following steps:<br><br>
a)	atomizing and injecting a hydrocarbon feedstock into the top portion of a<br>
tubular downflow reactor and contacting this hydrocarbon feedstock with a<br>
catalyst having an AAI of at least 3.5,<br>
b)	separating reaction products and spent catalyst at the bottom of said<br>
downflow reactor,<br>
c)	treating the spent catalyst with steam,<br>
d)	regenerating the spent catalyst in a regeneration zone, and<br>
e)	recycling the regenated catalyst to the downflow reactor.<br>
The use of a downflow reactor minimises overcracking, while the high<br>
accessibility of the cracking catalyst facilitates high conversions, even for high-<br>
boiling fractions in the hydrocarbon feed.<br>
The AAI is a measure of the accessibility of the catalyst pores to large, often<br>
high-molecular weight compounds and can be detemriined according to the<br>
method described in non pre-published European patent application No.<br>
01202147.3 filed on June 5, 2001, which application is incorporated by<br>
reference. This method involves adding the porous material to a stirred vessel<br>
containing large, preferably rigid, and often high-molecular weight compounds<br>
dissolved in a solvent and periodically analysing the concentration of these<br>
compounds in the solution. The relative concentration of the large compounds<br>
(in %) can be plotted against the square root of time (in minutes). The AAI is<br>
defined as the initial slope of this plot.<br>
The higher the AAI value, the more accessible the catalyst pores are.<br>
If the pores of the cracking catalyst are highly accessible to even the higher-<br>
boiling fractions of the hydrocarbon feed, the feed molecules will diffuse quickly<br>
through the pores and optimum use is made of the active sites present in the<br>
catalyst pores. Hence, high conversions can be reached with such catalysts.<br><br>
It is emphasised that the Ml is not equivalent to the pore volume of a catalyst.<br>
The AAI deals with the accessibility of this pore volume, e.g. the size of the pore<br>
entrance. Hence, catalysts with a high pore volume can have low AAI values if<br>
the pore entrances are narrow.<br>
According to the process according to the invention, a hydrocarbon feedstock is<br>
atomized and injected into the top portion of a tubular downflow reactor, thereby<br>
contacting this hydrocarbon feedstock in the absence of added hydrogen with a<br>
hot, fluidised stream of catalyst having an AAI of at least 3.5. Next, the spent<br>
catalyst, having coke and hydrocarbonaceous material deposited thereon, is<br>
separated from the reaction products. The hydrocarbonaceous material is<br>
stripped from the spent catalyst by treatment with steam. The coke is removed<br>
from the spent catalyst during the regeneration step, involving combustion of<br>
the coke in an oxygen-containing atmosphere at a temperature of about 600-<br>
SSCC, preferably BSO-TSCC. Finally, the regenerated catalyst is recycled to the<br>
downflow reactor.<br>
The catalyst-oil contact time preferably is 0.5 to 5 seconds, more preferably 0.5<br>
to 4 seconds, and even more preferably 1 to 3 seconds. The temperature at the<br>
reactor outlet preferably is between 450 and 700'C, more preferably between<br>
500 and 600°C. The catalyst/oil ratio preferably is between 2 and 15.<br>
The spent catalyst is continuously removed from the reaction zone and made<br>
up with catalyst essentially free of coke resulting from the regeneration zone. To<br>
make up for catalyst losses, fresh catalyst is regularly added to the process. If<br>
desired, part of the catalyst inventory can be withdrawn and replaced by fresh<br>
catalyst to adjust, e.g., the activity, selectivity or metal contamination of the<br>
circulating catalyst inventory.<br>
The fluidisation of the catalyst with various gas streams allows the transport of<br>
the catalyst between the reaction zone and the regeneration zone.<br><br>
The catalyst<br>
The AAI of the catalyst to be used in the process according to the invention is at<br>
least 3.5. preferably at least 5.0, more preferably at least 6.0. The maximum<br>
AAI value depends on the required physical properties, such as apparent bulk<br>
density and friction strength.<br>
The catalyst preferably comprises 10-60 wt.% of a solid acid, 0-50 wt.% of<br>
alumina, 0-40 wt.% of silica, and the balance kaolin. More preferably, the<br>
catalyst comprises 20-50 wt.% of solid acid, 5-40 wt.% of alumina, 5-25 wt.% of<br>
silica, and the balance kaolin. Most preferably, the catalyst comprises 25-45<br>
wt.% of solid acid, 10-30 wt.% of alumina, 5-20 wt.% of silica, and the balance<br>
kaolin.<br>
The catalyst may comprise solid acid, matrix, and/or any other component<br>
commonly used in FCC catalysts such as metal passivating agents.<br>
The matrix typically contains silica, alumina, silica-alumina, and/or clay. A<br>
preferred clay is kaolin.<br>
The solid acid can be a zeolite, e.g., a ZSM-type zeolite such as ZSM-5 or a<br>
faujasite-type zeolite, a silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO), an aluminophosphate<br>
(ALPO), or a combination thereof. Preferably, the solid acid is a zeolite, more<br>
preferably a faujasite-type zeolite. The zeolite is optionally ultrastabilised and/or<br>
rare earth exchanged, e.g. zeolite Y, zeolite USY, zeolite REY. or zeolite<br>
REUSY. The rare earth content of the zeolite preferably is below 16 wt%.<br>
The micropore volume of the catalyst preferably is at least 0.050 ml/g, whereas<br>
the external surface area preferably is at least 100 m^/g.<br>
Suitable methods for the preparation of such highly accessible catalysts include<br>
the methods disclosed in Brazilian patent publication BR PI 9704925-5A and in<br>
non pre-published European patent application No. 01202146.5, filed on June<br>
5, 2001, which applications are both incorporated by reference.<br><br>
The first method comprises mixing the catalyst components or precursors<br>
thereof in an aqueous slurry to form a precursor mixture, adding a pore-forming<br>
agent to this mixture, followed by shaping, e.g. spray-drying.<br>
The pore-forming agent controls the porosity of the catalyst. A preferred pore-<br>
forming agent is a water-soluble carbohydrate, e.g., sucrose, maltose,<br>
cellobiose, lactose, glucose, or fructose. These pore-forming agents can be<br>
readily removed after the catalyst preparation. Thermogravimetric analyses<br>
indicate that the pore-forming agent can be removed to less than 5 wt.%<br>
remaining in the catalyst.<br>
According to the second method, the catalyst components or precursors thereof<br>
are mixed in an aqueous slurry to form a precursor mixture, the mixture is fed to<br>
a shaping apparatus and shaped to form particles, in which process just before<br>
being fed to the shaping apparatus the mixture is destabilised, i.e. its viscosity is<br>
Increased.<br>
VIore in particular, this method involves feeding suspended catalyst<br>
components or precursors thereof from one or more vessels (the "holding<br>
/essels") via a so-called pre-reactor to a shaping apparatus. In this pre-reactor<br>
he catalyst precursor mixture is destabilised.<br>
n this specification a destabilised mixture is defined as a mixture whose<br>
fiscosity is higher after leaving the pre-reactor (and before shaping) than before<br>
jntering the pre-reactor. The viscosity increase is due to induced polymerisation<br>
)r gelling of catalyst binder material in the pre-reactor. The viscosity is typically<br>
ncreased from a level of about 1-100 Pas at a shear rate of 0.1 s'^ before<br>
sntering the pre-reactor to a level of about 50-1,000 Pas or higher at a shear<br>
ate of 0.1 s"^ after leaving the pre-reactor. In any case, it is preferred to induce<br>
I viscosity increase of at least 10 Pa-s, more preferably at least 50 Pas, and<br>
lost preferably at least 100 Pas (measured at a shear rate of 0.1 s'^).<br>
Preferably, the viscosity is increased from a level of about 1-50 Pa.s at a shear<br>
ate of 0.1 s'^ before entering the pre-reactor to a level of about 50-500 Pas at<br><br>
a shear rate of 0.1 s'^ after leaving the pre-reactor. The viscosity can be<br>
measured by standard rheometers, such as plate-and-plate rheometers, cone-<br>
and-plate rheometers or bop-and-cup rheometers.<br>
Destabilisation of the catalyst precursor mixture is performed in the pre-reactor<br>
just before feeding the mixture to the shaping apparatus. The time period<br>
involved, i.e. the time which elapses between the start of the destabilisation and<br>
the shaping, depends on the exact configuration of the pre-reactor and on the<br>
time needed thereafter for the destabilised mixture to reach the shaping<br>
apparatus. Time periods of up to half an hour are possible, but may be less<br>
preferred for economical reasons. Preferred is a time period of less than 300<br>
seconds. A more preferred time period is less than 180 seconds.<br>
Destabilisation can be performed by temperature increase, pH increase or pH<br>
decrease, and/or the addition of gel-inducing agents such as salts, phosphates,<br>
sulphates, and (partially) gelled silica.<br>
A suitable shaping method is spray-drying. For more details concerning this<br>
method we refer to non pre-published European patent application No.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
This Example compares the performance of a conventional catalyst in a<br>
downflow and a riser reactor.<br>
A conventional equilibrium catalyst was evaluated in two distinct pilot units, one<br>
comprising a downflow reactor and the other comprising a conventional riser<br>
reactor. Both units operated at the same reaction temperature. The properties<br>
of the gas oil used are listed in Table 1.<br>

Table 2 displays the results of the cracking process using the riser and the<br>
downflow reactor at constant coke production. From these results it follows that<br>
the use of a downflow reactor leads to improved conversion levels and<br>
improved selectivity to C3 olefins, as well as to improved hydrogen selectivity.<br>
However, the bottoms conversion in the downflow reactor is lower than in the<br>
riser reactor.<br><br>

Comparative Example 2		<br>
A catalyst was prepared in the following way:<br>
A silica hydrosol was prepared by the controlled neutralisation under acidic pH<br>
of a sodium silicate solution by diluted sulfuric acid. To the freshly prepared<br>
hydrosol were added, sequentially and under thorough agitation, powdered<br>
kaolin, an acidic suspension of a boehmite-type alumina, and an acidic<br>
suspension of REY-zeolite. The resulting precursor suspension had a solids<br>
content of 20 wt%.<br>
The precursor mixture was subsequently fed to a spray-dryer and catalyst<br>
microspheres were recovered. The microspheres were re-suspended in<br>
ammoniated water and filtered under reduced pressure. The so-formed filter<br>
cake was twice exchanged with an ammonium sulfate solution at 45°C and<br>
washed three times with water at the same temperature. Finally, the catalyst<br>
particles were dried in an oven under circulating air at 110°C for 16 hours,<br>
which yielded the fresh sample EC2.<br>
EC2 was composed of 40 wt% of ultrastabilised Y-zeolite with a SAR of 5.5 and<br>
exchanged to reach 5 wt% rare earth oxides (RE2O3); 30 wt% silica-alumina<br>
matrix; and 30 wt% kaolin.<br><br>
The physical properties of this catalyst are displayed in Table 3.<br>
Example 1<br>
The catalyst of this Example was prepared using exactly the same procedure as<br>
that of Comparative Example 2, except that - as taught in Brazilian PI BR<br>
9704925-5A - sucrose was added to the precursor mixture. This resulted in<br>
catalyst E1. The physical properties of this catalyst are displayed in Table 3.<br><br>

In this Table, BET is the well-known BET surface area, MiPV is the micropore<br>
volume, and MSA the mesopore (20-500A) surface area, all determined by Na<br>
adsorption (t-plot method).<br>
ABD stands for the Apparent Bulk Density, which is defined as the mass of<br>
catalyst per unit of volume in a non-compacted bed. The ABD is measured after<br>
filling a gauged cylinder of fixed, pre-determined volume without compaction of<br>
the bed.<br>
The AAI was determined by preparing a 1 I solution of 15 g Kuwait VGO in<br>
toluene by heating a Kuwait VGO feed to 70'C in an oven. 15 g of the warm<br>
Kuwait VGO were suspended in 200 ml warm toluene. The mixture was well<br>
stirred and adjusted to 1 litre with toluene. The solution was stored in the dark.<br>
50.00 g of this solution were added to a 100 ml beaker (glass) connected to a<br>
peristaltic pump and a detector by way of tubes. The solution was stirred with a<br>
propeller stirrer at 400 rpm and the peristaltic pump was set at 21 g/min.<br><br>
A spectrophotometer was used as detector. This spectrophotometer was set to<br>
zero using a toluene solution.<br>
Next, 1 g of a 53-75 microns sieve fraction of the catalyst was added to the<br>
Kuwait VGO in toluene solution. Once per second the asphaltene concentration<br>
was measured by spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 560 nm.<br>
After 5 minutes, the measurement was stopped and the relative absorbance<br>
was plotted versus the square root of time. The slope, i.e. the Akzo Accessibility<br>
Index (AAI), was determined.<br>
Example 2<br>
Portions of catalysts EC2 and El were hydrothermally deactivated using a<br>
100% steam atmosphere at 788°C for 5 hours, in order to simulate the<br>
equilibrium state. The resulting deactivated catalysts are called EC2D and E1D,<br>
respectively.<br>
The deactivated samples were tested in the same downflow reactor-containing<br>
unit and under the same conditions as in Comparative Example 1. The results<br>
at the same conversion levels and the same coke levels are listed in Table 4.<br>
The unit inventory was 2 kg and the gas oil flow rate was 1.7 kg/h. The<br>
operating conditions were: reaction pressure 0.1 kgf/cm^g, contact time 2<br>
seconds, temperature at the reactor exit 540°C and in the stripper 500°C. The<br>
catalyst/oil ratio (wt/wt) was varied in the range 6-9 by altering the feed<br>
temperature in the adiabatic reactor.<br><br>

From this Table it is clear that a process using a combination of a downflow<br>
reactor and a catalyst with an AAI of at least 3.5 results in high conversion<br>
levels and gasoline yields, combined with high bottoms conversion.<br>
These results were obtained using reaction temperatures and catalyst-to-oil<br>
ratios which are normally employed in industrial riser reactors. Moreover, the<br>
feed used was one having a high basic nitrogen content.<br>
On using the catalyst of Example 1 it is possible to operate in a downward flow<br>
reactor without  conversion  loss  at lower catalyst-to-oil  ratios  than  those<br>
recommended in the prior art.<br>
The results also show a tendency towards improvements in coke, fuel gas and<br>
gasoline selectivity.<br>
At constant coke the synergism between the use of a downflow reactor and a<br>
catalyst having an AAI of at least 3.5 is especially beneficial.<br><br>
Fuel gas and hydrogen yields are reduced and light olefins are increased.<br>
Compared to the base case bottoms conversion is increased too. This shows<br>
that the disadvantage in respect of bottoms conversion for downflow operations<br>
observed in the base case - see Table 2 - may be fully compensated by the<br>
rocess according to the invention.<br>
inally, it has been observed that the strippability of catalysts having an AAI of<br>
t least 3.5 is greatly improved in comparison with prior art catalysts not having<br>
uch high accessibility.<br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A process for the fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons comprising the<br>
following steps:<br>
a)	atomizing and injecting a hydrocarbon feedstock into the top portion<br>
of a tubular downflow reactor and contacting this hydrocarbon<br>
feedstock with a catalyst having an Akzo Accessibility Index (AAI) of<br>
at least 3.5,<br>
b)	separating reaction products and spent catalyst at the bottom of<br>
said downflow reactor,<br>
c)	treating the spent catalyst with steam,<br>
d)	regenerating the spent catalyst in a regeneration zone, and<br>
e)	recycling the regenerated catalyst to the downflow reactor;<br>
wherein the catalyst comprises 10-60 wt.% of a solid acid, 0-50% wt.% of<br>
alumina, 0-40% wt.% of silica, and the balance kaolin.<br>
2.	The process as claimed claim 1 wherein the catalyst has an AAI of at least 5.0.<br>
3.	The process as claimed in claim 2 wherein the catalyst has an AAI of at least<br>
6.0.<br>
4.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the catalyst has been obtained<br>
by mixing the catalyst components or precursors thereof in an aqueous<br>
mixture, adding a pore-forming agent to this mixture, followed by shaping.<br>
5.	The process as claimed in claim 4 wherein the pore-forming agent is a water-<br>
soluble carbohydrate.<br><br>
6.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the catalyst comprises 20-50 wt.%<br>
of solid acid, 5-40 wt.% of alumina, 5-25 wt.% of silica, and the balance<br>
kaolin.<br>
7.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the catalyst comprises 25-45 wt.%<br>
of solid acid, 10-30 wt.%» of alumina, 5-20 wt.% of silica, and the balance<br>
kaolin.<br>
8.	The process as claimed in claim 6 wherein the solid acid is selected from<br>
the group consisting of ZSM-type zeolites, faujasite-type zeolites,<br>
siiicoaluminophosphate (SAPO), aluminophosphate (ALPO), and<br>
combinations thereof<br>
9.	The process as claimed in claim 8 wherein the solid acid is a rare earth<br>
exchanged zeolite.<br>
10.	The process as claimed in claim 9 wherein the rare earth content of the zeolite<br>
is below 16 wt%.<br>
11.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the catalyst has been<br>
obtained by combining catalyst components or precursors thereof in an<br>
aqueous medium to form a catalyst precursor mixture, feeding the mixture<br>
to a shaping apparatus, and shaping the mixture to form particles, in which<br>
process just before being fed to the shaping apparatus the mixture is<br>
destabilized.<br><br></td>
