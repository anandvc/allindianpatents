PRIORITY FILING<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Nos.<br>
60/633,592 filed on December 6, 2004, and 60/647,504 filed on January 27, 2005, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to a staining composition for staining an ophthalmic membrane. More specifically, the present invention relates to the staining composition used as an adjuvant for staining the ophthalmic membrane specifically to remove the membrane.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The staining of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) is one of the important developments of surgery for such vitreo-retinal diseases as macular hole and epiretinal membranes (ERMS) (Indocyanine green-assisted peeling of the retinal internal limiting membrane. Burk SE et al. Ophthalmology. 2000;107:2010-2014.) It is now widely recognized that without surgical adjuvant it is extremely difficult to remove the membranes due to the poor visibility of the ELM and ERMS. hi particular, Indocyanine green (ICG) and Trypan Blue (TB) staining have greatly facilitated ILM and ERMS peeling in various vitreo-retinal diseases and as a result, this technique is now widely accepted by many surgeons However, numerous reports have recently emerged regarding retinal damage caused by intravitreal injections of ICG and TB both in experimental and clinical use.<br>
(Morphological and functional damage of the retina caused by intravitreous indocyanine green in rat eyes. Enaida H, et al. Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2002; 240:209-213.; Uemura A,et al. Visual field defects after uneventful vitrectomy for epiretinal membrane with indocyanine green-assisted internal limiting membrane peeling. Am J Ophthalmol. 2003;136:252-257.; Veckeneer M, et al. Ocular toxicity study of trypan blue injected into the vitreous cavity of rabbit eyes. Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2001;239:698-704.)<br>
[0004] Further, creating a continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) in eyes with a white mature cataract can be challenging as it is difficult to distinguish the anterior capsule from the underlying white cortex. Poor visualization of the capsule tends to result<br><br>
in an incomplete or inadequate CCC that could cause a subsequent capsular tear, vitreous loss and intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation. The intraocular administration of dyes for anterior capsule staining to perform CCC in eyes with a cataract with poor or no red reflex has become increasingly popular. Dada demonstrated that capsular staining facilitates the CCC even in immature cataracts and could be a useful adjunct for trainee surgeons. Trypan blue 0.1% and 0.06% have been introduced to capsular staining, and has been found to have no apparent toxicity in vivo. However, trypan blue has been reported to be toxic to corneal endothelium in vitro in severe conditions. Indocyanine green (ICG) is also a frequently used dye for capsular staining. McEnerney and Peyman described the use of ICG for cell counts in rabbit corneal endothelium, and suggested the dye did not damage living endothelium. However, the inventors reported the potential toxicity of ICG to retinal cells in 2002, and recently, the toxicity of ICG has been reported in retinal pigment epithelium, ganglion cells, and photoreceptors. (Indocyanine green induces apoptosis in human retinal pigment epithelial cells. Rezai KA, et al. Am J Ophthalmol. 2004;137:931-933.; Trypan blue induces apoptosis in human retinal pigment epithelial cells. Rezai KA et al. Am J Ophthalmol. 2004;138:492-495.)<br>
[0005] As stated above, dyes (such as IC or TB) conventionally used for staining an ophthalmic membrane, particularly the internal limiting membrane and the anterior capsule have produced questions regarding their safety. Such doubts developed due to reports of the possibility of toxicity, teratogenicity and so on to the retinal cells. Furthermore, there were technical problems such as the inability to get a. satisfactory dye at lower concentrations and complicated staining methods. Thus, such problems made ophthalmic surgery an even more difficult matter.<br>
[0006] Accordingly, to promote the improvement of ophthalmic surgeries, the development of a dye that specifically colors an ophthalmic membrane, and has the objectives of high staining at low concentrations along with high levels of safety, has been greatly desired.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] Therefore, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a staining composition that is an alternative to dyes conventionally used for staining an ophthalmic membrane. A more detailed objective is to provide a staining composition specifically for staining an internal limiting membrane or an anterior capsule, which is usable as an adjuvant to a surgery for the removal of such a membrane.<br><br>
[0008] In order to provide a staining composition for achieving such objectives, all dyes, including dyes currently not being utilized for organisms were used, and they were then screened for candidate dyes. Additionally, as the screening conditions, safety and staining-affinity were especially noted. Safety assessments were then conducted, using rats, of the narrowed down candidate dyes. Based on higher staining-affinity and safety, Brilliant Blue G (BBG) became the final candidate.<br>
[0009] Further, in order to examine the optimal conditions of a staining composition containing BBG for staining an ophthalmic membrane, various experiments were performed. In that way, the staining composition of the present invention was achieved. It should be noted that BBG had not yet been used clinically, especially with regard to human. However, via the optimal conditions for the present invention, a staining composition that is safe for clinical use, and that also has a high staining-affinity, can be provided.<br>
[0010] Therefore, according to the first main aspect of the present invention, a staining composition is provided having BBG as a principal component, for staining an ophthalmic membrane at the time of removal of the ophthalmic membrane.<br>
[0011] That is, one aspect of the present invention directs to a staining composition for staining an ophthalmic membrane when performing the ophthalmic membrane removal, wherein the staining composition comprises a Brilliant Blue G (BBG) derivative, a pharmaceutical ly acceptable salt thereof or a hydrate thereof, as a primary component.<br><br><br>

Among some of the leading candidates, those that showed superiority in safety but inability to dye the target object, or in the reverse, those that showed good staining but virulence to the retina, were removed from candidacy. Safety assessments of the narrowed down candidates were conducted using rats, and in accordance with better staining-affinity and safety, BBG was made the final candidate. The following describes in detail the reasons why BBG became the final candidate for the present invention.<br>
[0079] First, BBGs staining qualities, when compared with ICG's, were very similar, and it can stain a target object at very low concentrations (1/10 -1/20). Even upon examination of very high concentration solutions remaining behind at the intraocular, no opinion could be proven regarding clear toxicity to the eye. Additionally, because BBG (unlike ICG) is not a fluorescent dye, phototoxicity to the retina that is believed to occur due to intraocular illumination from high illuminance can be thought to be almost nonexistent. Furthermore, persistence of the dye on the tissue surface after cleansing was, compared with ICG, very low. Then again, because BBG is a cool color type dye, with the intraocular tissues being a warm color type, the contrast of the dye can be emphasized.<br>
[0080] Next, various experiments were conducted to assess the optimal conditions of a staining composition containing BBG for dyeing an ophthalmic membrane. Furthermore, BBG until now has not been used clinically, particularly with regard to humans. However, via such optimal conditions of the present invention, one can provide a composition which is both safe and has high staining-affinity for clinical usages.<br>
[0081] Therefore, according to the first main aspect of the present invention, a staining composition is provided which has BBG derivative as a principal component, for staining an ophthalmic membrane at the time of removal of the ophthalmic membrane.<br>
[0082] According to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, said staining composition can be used as a surgical adjuvant in ophthalmological surgeries with regard to diseases of the eye such as, for example, vitreo-retinal disease such as Macular hole, retinal detachment due to hymyopic macular hole, epiretinal membrane, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy, specific<br><br>
cataracts such as hypermature cataract, and congenital cataract, and so on, as well as split-thickness corneal transplantation and so on. According to the staining composition of the present invention, it becomes possible to more clearly verify difficult-to-see ophthalmic membranes, and improve safety during surgical operations.<br>
[0083] In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, said staining composition can be used for staining an ophthalmic membrane and more preferably, for staining the internal limiting membrane and/or the anterior capsule.<br>
[0084] Then again, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the staining composition of the present invention can be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. It can be prepared in the form of a set with a dissolving solution and drug powders, or as a solution filled up in a syringe receptacle, and in a gel-state solution when combined with a hyaluronic acid. Most preferably, it is prepared in the form of a solution, but it need not be limited to that.<br>
[0085] In one embodiment of the present invention, said staining composition is prepared as a pharmaceutically acceptable solution, although it need not necessarily be limited to that. This results from the qualities of BBG where it can be directly and easily dissolved in an intraocular cleansing solution, and can be sterilized with the syringe filter.<br>
[0086] Furthermore, according to one embodiment of the present invention, said staining composition is prepared as a solution where it is dissolved in an intraocular irrigating solution, a balanced salt solution (BSS), a physiological saline solution, or most preferably, OPEGUARD -MA (Senjyu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) which is an intraocular irrigating solution (intraocular cleansing solution). However, it need not be limited to that form.<br>
[0087] In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the staining composition contains BBG at a concentration of 0,1 - 10 mg/ml, preferably a concentration of 0.1 - 1.0 mg/ml, and most preferably, a concentration of 0.1 - 0.25 mg/ml. In one practical example of the present invention, in said staining composition, the concentration of BBG required to stain the ILM of primates, is about 1/10 in comparison with ICG. Additionally, for staining of the anterior capsule, the BBG within said staining composition can provide satisfactory staining with a low concentration of 0.25 mg/ml, as compared to ICG's requiring 5 mg/ml and TB's requiring 1 mg/ml. hi other words, according to this embodiment, a staining composition can be provided which has high staining-affinity at low concentrations and small quantities.<br><br>
[0088] Furthermore, it is preferable according to one embodiment of the present invention for the staining composition to have an osmotic pressure in the environs of 298 mOsm. According to this embodiment, the staining composition of the present invention has an osmotic pressure equal to a physiological saline solution. It was previously reported that defects in the retinal pigment epithelium with ICG, may possibly originate from the hypoosmolality of its solution. With regard to this, the staining composition of one embodiment of the present invention has superior effects, in that defects caused by differences in osmotic pressure at the retinal pigment epithelium - which are tissue disorders relating to cell expansions or dehydration (such as cell omission or cell death) -do not occur.<br>
[0089] hi one preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is desirable that the staining composition of the present invention displays a neutral pH, that is, a pH in the vicinity of pH = 7.4.<br>
[0090] According to the second main aspect of the present invention, a method for staining and removing an ophthalmic membrane is provided having the steps of preparing a staining composition having BBG derivative as a principal component; staining the ophthalmic membrane using a predetermined concentration of said staining composition; and removing the stained ophthalmic membrane.<br>
[0091] For one embodiment of the present invention, said method for staining the ophthalmic membrane can use a method easily understood by one skilled in the art, for example, injection, infusion, irrigation, confirmation and peeling, hi one practical example of the present invention, it is preferable that said method for staining an ophthalmic membrane involves the injection of said staining composition. With this practical example, an additional step such as fluid-gas exchange, which is required when applying TB to an ophthalmic membrane, is not necessary. As an example, it is possible to simply stain at the time of use during ophthalmic surgery.<br>
[0092] According to the third main aspect of the present invention, a use of BBG derivative in the manufacture of a staining composition for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases is provided.<br>
[0093] Additionally, according to the fourth main aspect of the present invention, a use of BBG derivative as a surgical adjuvant for ophthalmic surgeries is provided.<br>
[0094] Furthermore, in one embodiment of the present invention, said staining composition and/or a staining method utilizing it, can be suitably employed as a part of<br><br>
ophthalmic surgeries. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, said ophthalmological surgeries are surgeries for treating macular hole, retinal detachment due to hymyopic macular hole, epiretinal membrane, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy, specific cataracts such as hypermature cataract, and congenital cataract, and split-thickness corneal transplantation, and so on, and most preferably, vitreo-retinal diseases (in particular macular hole or epiretinal membranes (ERMS)) and cataracts.<br>
[0095] Furthermore, with one preferred embodiment of the present invention, said ophthalmic surgeries are put into effect on the eyes of mammals and, more preferably, on the eyes of humans.<br>
[0096] The following examples are provided to describe the invention in greater detail. They are intended to illustrate, not to limit, the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Screening various dyes as a candidate focusing on their safety and ability to stain membranes<br>
[0097] In order to provide a staining composition for achieving such aims, all dyes, including dyes currently not being utilized for organisms were used, and they were then screened for candidate dyes. The dyes screened are Evans blue, Acid blue 9, Fast green, Brilliant Blue FCF, Indigo-carmine, methyl blue, methylene blue, Brilliant Blue G (BBG). Additionally, as the screening conditions, safety and staining-affinity were especially noted.<br>
[0098] Among some of the leading candidates, those that showed superiority in safety but inability to dye the target object, or in the reverse, those that showed good staining but virulence to the retina, were removed from candidacy.<br>
[0099] Safety assessments were then conducted, using rats, of the narrowed down candidate dyes. Based on higher staining-affinity and safety, BBG became the final candidate.<br>
[0100] Next, in order to examine the optimal conditions of a staining composition containing BBG for staining an ophthalmic membrane, various experiments were performed. In that way, the staining composition of the present invention was achieved.<br>
Example 2<br><br>
2. Effects of the intravitreous BBG on the retina<br>
[0101] All procedures conformed to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and the guidelines for animal care at Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.<br>
2.1 Characterization of the BBG solution<br>
[0102] BBG is also known as Acid Blue 90 and Coomassie Brilliant Blue G. Aside from our previous publication, there are no reports investigating the toxicity BBG for ophthalmic use. Table 1 shows the osmolarity and pH of the BBG solution at different concentrations. The osmolarity and pH of BBG was found to be similar to those of intraocular irrigating solutions.<br>
Table. 1<br><br><br>
[0103] Brown Norway rats (n = 78 males, 8 weeks old, Kyudo, Fukuoka, Japan) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketarnine hydrochloride at a dose of 75 mg/kg body weight. One eye from each animal (total of n = 6 per dose group) was vitrectomized using 0.05 ml of pure SF6 gas as described previously. Following the gas injection, 0.05 ml of BBG solution was injected into the vitreous cavity of each vitrectomized eye using a microscope for enhanced magnification during surgery. The BBG solution (Brilliant Blue G, Coomassie(Registered trademark) brilliant blue G 250; Signa-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was prepared at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 mg/ml using dilution in intraocular irrigating solution (OPEGUARD(Registered trademark)-MA, Serijyu Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and sterilized through a 0.22 jxm syringe filter. The mean osmolality was determined using an osmotic pressure meter (OSMO STATION5 Arkray, Kyoto, Japan) and the pH of each solution was determined for all concentrations prepared (Table 1). The final concentration was determined according to the ICG solution used in vitrectomies for humans (2.5-5.0 mg/ml), in order to provide the rats with a safe dose of BBG that would also produce good staining. Twenty-four sham-operated eyes (injected with SFe followed by 0.05 ml of intraocular irrigating solution) were used as controls.<br>
2.3.	Light microscopy<br>
[0104] The eyes were enucleated and fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde on day 14 (n = 30; 6 per dose and control group) and at 2 months (n = 30; 6 per dose and control group) post-operatively. Whole eyes were cut approximately along the vertical meridian. Paraffin- embedded sections were stained with hematoxyline-eosin (HE) and each section was examined using light microscopy.<br>
[0105] After intravitreal injection of BBG, no toxic effects of BBG such as corneal edema, severe retinal edema, or endophthalmitis were observed by surgical microscopy over a period of 2 months. The eyes were enucleated on day 14 and 2 months after the operation. The normal structure of the retina was preserved in the eyes injected with the highest doses of BBG (10 mg/ml) when observed on both day 14 and at 2 months. In addition, no infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed. (Fig. 1, day 14) The normal structure of retina was also retained in the groups injected with lower doses of BBG and no sign of cellular degeneration was observed in the sections on day 14 or at 2 months.<br>
2.4.	Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)<br>
[0106] The eyes were enucleated on day 14 and at 2 months post-operation and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The specimens were postfixed in<br><br>
veronal acetate buffer osmium tetroxide (2%), dehydrated in ethanol and water, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were cut from blocks and mounted on copper grids. The specimens were observed with a JEM 100CX electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo).<br>
[0107] Some specimens injected with the highest dose of BBG (10 mg/ml) showed vaC1-10lization in the ganglion cells and Muller cell processes of nerve fibers on both day 14 (Fig. 2 A, day 14) and at 2 months. Although the same changes were also found in the group injected with 1 mg/ml BBG the grade of vaC1-10lization was less than in the 10 mg/ml group (Fig. 2B). VaC1-10lization was not observed in the groups receiving lower doses or in the controls. Among all groups, no remarkable changes were observed in the retina including the inner nuclear, outer nuclear, and retinal pigment epithelial cell layers.<br>
2.5.	TdT-dUTP Terminal Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL)<br>
[0108] Apoptotic cell death was detected using TdT-dUTP Terminal Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) as described previously. A cryostat was used to produce 4-^m sections from samples fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. TUNEL staining was performed with the ApopTag® Fluorescein Direct in situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Intergen Company, New York, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sections were co-stained with propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR USA), thus allowing the observation of the cell nuclei by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo). Ten sections from each eye specimen were selected at random and observed using the microscope.<br>
[0109] In the group administered the highest doses of BBG (10 mg/ml) group, one case of apoptotic cell death was observed from among ten sections. However, the apoptotic cell ratio was not significantly different to that observed in control sections (Fig. 3, day 14). In groups injected with lower doses of BBG, no TUNEL staining was observed in the retina on day 14. Furthermore, retinal cells in all BBG dose groups had not undergone apoptotic cell death after 2 months.<br>
2.6.	Electroretinography<br>
[0110] Following a gas injection, 0.05 ml of BBG solution (1 mg/ml and 10 mgVml) or intraocular irrigating solution was injected into the vitreous cavity. There were six rats in each dose group and six controls. The absence of cataracts was confirmed in all rats before measurements were taken. At time points of fourteen days, and again at two months later, the rats were kept in a dark room for one night, with only dim red illumination, and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 15μl/g body weight of<br><br>
a saline solution containing ketamine (1 mg/ml), xylazine (0.4 mg/ml), and urethane (40 mg/ml). Electroretinography (ERG) was then performed as previously described. The pupils were dilated with 2.5% phenylephrine HC1 and 1% tropicamide drops, and showed maximal dilatation before ERG recording. The cornea was anesthetized with 1% proparacaine HC1 drops and the rats were then placed on a heating pad throughout the experiment. A wire electrode, coated with 1% methylcellulose, was placed over the cornea to record the ERGs. A similar wire electrode placed in the mouth served as a reference electrode while a needle electrode inserted into the tail was grounded. The responses were differentially amplified (0.8 to 1,200 Hz), averaged, and stored using a computer. White (xenon) strobe flashes were presented in a Ganzfeld stimulator (VPA-10; Cadwell, Kennewick, Washington, USA) against an achromatic adapting field. Dark-adapted (rod-mediated) ERGs were recorded first to check the response stability at both intensities. Each rat was then adapted to dark background luminance for 20 minutes, a period sufficient to achieve a stable level of response. Thereafter, dark-adapted a (rod-mediated) and dark-adapted b (bipolar and Muller-mediated) ERGs were elicited at a flash luminance of 130 log cd sec/m . The responses to five successive flashes at an interstimulus interval of 1 min were then averaged to determine the dark-adapted responses. The rats were then exposed to a white light- adapting field (1.50 log cd/m ) for at least 25 minutes and then light-adapted b (cone- mediated) ERGs were elicited at a flash luminance of 1.30 log cd sec/m (rod desensitized condition in rats). The responses to 50 successive flashes made at 2 Hz were averaged. The results of the amplitude of ERGs were evaluated using the Student's t test and a p value of 
[0111] Figure 4 A represents the dark - and light - adapted ERG wave forms of the responses of the control and high does groups on day 14. The amplitudes of dark-adapted responses obtained at the beginning of the experiments showed a low variability between groups. Although a slight reduction in the mean maximal amplitude of the dark-adapted a waves (Fig. 4B, day 14) on day 14 was observed in a dose dependent manner in the high dose groups, there was no significant difference in the maximal wave amplitude compared with the controls (10 mg/ml: p = 0,054 and 1.0 mg/ml: p = 0.063 ; t test). Also, dark- adapted b waves (10 mg/ml: p - 0.553 and 1.0 mg/ml: p = 0.508; / test) and light-adapted h wave ERGs (10 mg/ml: p = 0.451 and 1.0 mg/ml: p ~ 0.550; t test) demonstrated no remarkable reduction, with no statistical significant difference between the amplitudes (Fig. 4B, day 14). After 2 months the ERGs in the same dose groups (1.0 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml) were recorded and the reduction of the amplitude of the dark-adapted a waves was found to recover in a similar manner to that in the control group.<br><br>
2.7. ILM staining by BBG in primate eyes<br>
[0112] Since ILM peeling is impossible in rat eyes, the inventors examined the ability of BBG to stain the ILM in primate eyes. Two eyes from two cynomolgus monkeys at 3 years of age were used in this study. The animals were restrained in a squeeze cage and injected intramuscularly in the thigh with 20 mg/kg of ketamine hydrochloride (Sankyo Yell Pharmaceutical Products Co. Ltd., Japan) for general anesthesia. The monkeys were subsequently transported to an operating room. Surgery consisted of a standard three port pars plana vitrectomy with induction of a posterior vitreous detachment by suction with a vitrectomy cutter using triamcinolone acetonide injection for vitreous visualization.<br>
[0113] Ten milligrams of BBG were dissolved in 20 ml of intraocular irrigating solution and sterilized with a syringe filter. The final concentration of BBG was 0.5 mg/ml. The prepared BBG solution (0.5 ml) was then injected gently into the vitreous cavity and washed out immediately with balanced salt solution (BSS plus(Registered trademark), Santen, Osaka, Japan). Removal of the ILM was performed using ILM forceps. The instruments were then removed and the sclerotomy ports were closed using 7-0 polygalatin sutures. Postoperative examinations included slitlamp microscopy and ophthalmoscopy on days 1, 3 and 14. Fluorescein angiography was performed on day 14.<br>
[0114] After irrigation of the vitreous cavity, the ILM was stained a light blue color. The edge and flap of the ILM were clearly visible during the peeling of the ILM (Fig. 5 A). The circular area underlying the ILM was clearly visible following the peeling of the ILM (Fig. 5B).<br>
[0115] Postoperatively, toxic effects of BBG, such as a corneal edema, severe retinal edema and endophthalmitis, were not observed during slitlamp microscopy and ophthalmoscopy examinations at day 14. Fluorescein angiography also revealed that there was no apparent retinal damage by BBG on day 14 (Fig. 5C). Further ophthalmoscopic examinations showed no further changes in the retina during the six-month follow-up period.<br>
Example 3<br>
3. Interventional clinical case series of BBG as a potential staining solution for membrane peeling<br>
[0116] Indocyanine green (ICG) and Trypan Blue (TB) staining have greatly facilitated ILM peeling in various vitreo-retinal diseases. However, numerous reports have recently<br><br>
emerged regarding retinal damage caused by ICG and TB both in experimental and clinical use.<br>
[0117] From the preclinical study, BBG was selected as a candidate dye for ILM staining. This is apparently the first clinical investigation of BBG in human eyes. This is the first known clinical investigation of BBG in human eyes.<br>
3.1. The use of BBG in ILM staining and the effects and safety in human eves (the first attempt)<br>
[0118] Sixteen eyes of 16 patients with a macular hole (MH) and epiretinal membranes (ERMS) were recruited from the outpatient unit of Kyushu University Hospital (Fukuoka, Japan) between August and September 2004. Patients with ocular diseases such as glaucoma, uveitis, and corneal disorder were excluded. Charactarization of the patients is shown in Table 1. This study was carried out with the approval from the appropriate institutional Ethics Committee and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1989 Declaration of Helsinki. The possible advantages and risks of the present treatment were explained to the patients before surgery and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Surgery consisted of a three port pars plana vitrectomy with induction of a posterior vitreous detachment by suction with a vitrectony cutter using j triamcinorone. Twenty milligrams of BBG (Brilliant blue G 250; Signa-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) were dissolved in 10 ml of intraocular irrigating solution (OPEGU ARD(Registered trademark)-MA, Senjyu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and sterilized with a syringe filter (Minisart(Registered trademark) Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany). The final concentration of BBG was 0.25mg/ml. The prepared 0.5 ml of BBG solution (289 mOsm, pH=7.44) was then injected gently into the vitreous cavity and washed out immediately with balanced salt solution (BSS plus(Registered trademark), Santen, Osaka, Japan). The ILM was stained a light blue color. Removal of the ILM was performed using ILM forceps (D.O.R.C.; Dutch Ophthalmic Research Center International b.v., Netherlands). However, staining of the ERMS could not be confirmed at this concentration.<br>
[0119] Postoperative examinations included slitlamp microscopy, ophthalmoscopy, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and intraocular pressure. The visual field was evaluated with Humphrey Field Analyzer II (Humphrey Systems, Dublin, California, USA) after 2 months.<br>
[0120] The surgical procedure was completed successfully. Visual acuity recovered in all cases. None of the patients had an elevation of intraocular pressure. Apparent reduction of<br><br>
intensity and defect on visual field were not observed. No other adverse effects due to BBG were observed within the observation period. (Table 2)<br>

3.2. The use of BBG in ILM staining and the effects and safety in human eves Cthe second attempt)<br>
[0121] The inventors have continued to investigate the clinical case, and obtained results as follows.<br>
[0122] Twenty eyes from 20 consecutive patients presenting with macular hole (MH: ten eyes from 10 patients; 5 men and 5 women) or with epiretinal membrane (ERM: ten eyes from 10 patients, 5 men and 5 women) underwent vitrectomy with removal of the membranes using BBG staining solution between August and November 2004. Patients with ocular diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, uveitis, and corneal disorder were excluded. The mean ± SD age of the patients was 67 ± 11.9 years with a range of 33 to 85 years. The mean follow up period was 7.3 ± 1.0 months. Patient details are tabulated in Table 3 and 4. Pre- and postoperative ophthalmic examinations included slitlamp microscopy, ophthalmoscopy, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and intraocular pressure (IOP). The closure of the MH and measurement of foveal thickness (ERM cases) was determined by optical coherence tomography (OCT3: Humphrey Instruments, San Leandro, CA, USA). The mean foveal thickness was calculated from a total of 4 scans.<br>
[0123] Excised specimens from 4 eyes (2 eyes from MH patients and 2 eyes from ERM patients) were submitted for transmission electron microscopy to verify the presence of the ILM, The specimens were postfixed in veronal acetate buffer osmium tetroxide (2%), dehydrated in ethanol and water, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were cut from blocks and mounted on copper grids. The specimens were observed with a JEM 100CX electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo).<br>
[0124] This study was carried out with approval from the Institutional Review Board and performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1989 Declaration of Helsinki. The possible advantages and risks of the present treatment were explained to all patients before surgery and written informed consent obtained.<br><br>
[0125] Standard phacoemulsification was performed when needed. Surgery consisted of a three port pars plana vitrectomy with induction of a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) by suction with a vitrectomy cutter using triamcinorone acetonide injection (Kenakolt-A® Bristol Pharmaceuticals KK, Tokyo, Japan) as required. BBG (Brilliant Blue G 250; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was dissolved in intraocular irrigating solution (OPEGU ARD®-MA, Senjyu Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The solution was then sterilized through a 0.22 fjm syringe filter. The final concentration of BBG was 0.25 mg/ml (289 mOsm, pH=7.44). The prepared BBG solution (0.5 ml) was then injected gently into the vitreous cavity (Fig. 6A) and washed out immediately with balanced salt solution (BSS plus(Registered trademark), Santen, Osaka, Japan), hi MH cases, the ILM was stained a bright blue color instantly. Removal of the ILM was performed using ILM forceps (Fig. 6B, C). Following the removal of the ILM, the difference in the retinal surface color between the area from which the ILM had been removed and the surrounding area was clearly visible (Fig.6D). In ERM cases however, staining of the ERM could not be confirmed at this concentration (Fig. 7A). After ERM peeling (Fig. 7B), BBG solution was injected again, followed by immediate irrigation of the vitreous cavity. The ILM of the area where the ERM had been removed was well stained with BBG (Fig. 7C). However, the area where residual ERM and posterior vitreous remained was not stained. The well-stained ILM could be easily removed with unstained residual ERM and posterior vitreous (Fig. 7D).<br>
[0126] Finally, intraocular lenses were inserted in all cases. In MH cases, fluid-gas exchange was performed and was replaced with 15 % sulfur hexafluoride gas. Patients were advised to maintain a face-down posture for one week.<br>
[0127] The ILM including the ERM was removed from all 20 eyes successfully during surgery. Transmission electron microscopic examinations confirmed the presence of the ILM in all processed specimens (n = 4) (Fig. 8). Postoperatively, any acute toxicity induced by BBG injection, such as a corneal edema, severe retinal edema and severe intraocular inflammation such as endophthalmitis, was not observed by slitlamp microscopy and ophthalmoscopy examinations by day 14.<br>
[0128] All MH cases were completely closed anatomically with both ophthalmoscopy and OCT examinations. The preoperative median BCVA was 20/100 (range; 20/200-20/50). The postoperative median BCVA was 20/32 (range; 20/200-20/20). Visual acuity improved in 9 eyes (90%) by 2 or more Snellen lines and was unchanged in one eye. In two cases, complications included iatrogenic peripheral retinal breaks, which were treated by endolaser photocoagulation intraoperatively. Only one case of MH had an<br><br>
elevation of IOP (26 mmHg) after 6 months and this was treated with latanoprost. (Table<br>
3)<br>
[0129] In ERM surgery cases, the mean foveal thickness of retina measured with<br>
OCT decreased from 454.7 ± 141.3 μM (preoperative) to 249.4 ± 71.3 μM (postoperative). The postoperative BCVA (20/100-20/12.5; median: 20/32) was better than the preoperative BCVA (20/100-20/40; median: 20/50) in ERM cases (Table 4). Eight patients (80%) had an improvement of 2 or more lines on the Snellen chart, whereas the BCVA remained the same or improved by 1 line for the other two patients. The only complication was the protraction of vitreous hemorrhage in one case, which was absorbed after observation. No other adverse effects such as retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy were observed during the follow- up period in all cases.<br>
Table 3<br><br><br><br>
[0131] The pig eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and transported to the laboratory on ice. The extraocular muscles and other connective tissues were carefully cut off and the eyes were placed on the operation chamber. The BBG solution was prepared using the following method. Twenty milligrams of BBG (Coomassie. brilliant blue G 250; Signa-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) were dissolved in 10 ml of intraocular irrigating solution (OPEGUARD.-MA, Senjyu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and sterilized with a syringe filter (Minisart. Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany). Under the operation microscope, the capsular staining by BBG was examined as follows. The anterior chamber was entered through the clear cornea with a 26-gauge needle mounted<br><br>
on a syringe. BBG was injected onto the anterior capsular through a 26-gauge needle introduced through the same entry (10, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1 and O.Olmg/ml). The anterior chamber was immediately irrigated by enhanced balanced salt solution (BSS Plus®, Santen Pharmaceuticals, Japan) and the excessive dye was easily washed out.<br>
[0132] To deepen the anterior chamber, 1% sodium hyaluronate (Healon®, Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was injected. A CCC was initiated by preparing a small triangular anterior capsular flap with a bent 26-gauge disposable needle mounted on a viscoelastic syringe. The CCC was completed using a cystotome or capsulorhexis forceps.<br>
[0133] The dye stained the anterior capsule homogenously, and the edge of the CCC was clearly recognized under the operation microscope. The staining deepened as the concentration of the dye increased (0.25mg/ml to lmg/ml, Fig.9), and the minimal concentration needed to produce high quality staining with clear visualization was found to be 0.25mg/ml (Fig.9, top right). At 0. lmg/ml and O.Olmg/ml, the capsular staining was obscure, and no merit could be found in using the dye. (Fig.9, middle left and bottom left). The side-port was also stained by the anterior chamber injection.<br>
4.2.	The biocompatibility of BBG<br>
[0134] Brown Norway rats (Kyudo, Fukuoka, Japan), postnatal 8 weeks, were studied as follows. The rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital and their pupils were dilated with topical 1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride. The anterior chamber was entered through the clear cornea with a 30-gauge needle mounted on a syringe. Then a single anterior chamber injection was performed with each dye, BBG (10, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1 and O.Olmg/ml), ICG (5mg/ml), trypan blue (lmg/ml), and the control OPEGUARD. solution (n=6 for each dye, total 54 eyes). The mean osmolality and pH of each solution are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0135] The dye remained in the anterior chamber and was followed by biomicroscopic examination for 2 months. The eyes were enucleated at 2 weeks and 2 months after operation. The eyes were analyzed by light microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy.<br>
4.3.	Light microscopy<br>
[0136] The eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and cut in half, embedded in paraffin, deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in ethanol, and washed in<br><br>
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The 4μM thick sections were stained by hematoxylin and eosin, and observed by light microscope.<br>
[0137] Hematoxilin and eosin stained sections of the cornea showed no remarkable changes in each group (BBG, ICG, TB ; Fig. 10). In the light microscopic examination, no signs of endothelial cell loss or corneal edema were observed. The lamellar collagen, layers, stromal cells and epithelial cell layer were well preserved. No inflammatory ceil infiltration was observed in all corneal layers.<br>
4.4.	TdT-dUTP Terminal Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL)<br>
[0138] Apoptotic cell death was detected by TdT-dUTP Terminal Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL). Four micron-thick sections were made from samples fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. TUNEL staining was performed with the ApopTag®Fluorescein Direct in situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Intergen Company, New York, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The sections were co-stained with<br>
[0139] propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), thus allowing the observation of the cell nuclei by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo). Ten sections for each eye specimen were randomly selected and observed (n=3). The results are presented as the means ± standard deviations.<br>
[0140] In all groups, apoptotic cell death of the corneal epithelium due to physiological turnover was observed occasionally (Fig.l 1, arrowheads). In BBG groups, no TUNEL staining was observed in the corneal stromal cells, endothelium, ciliary body, and lens cells (Fig.l 1). In the ICG group, no apparent apoptotic cell death was detected in 5mg/ml concentration, hi the TB group, apoptotic cell death of corneal endothelium was detected in 2% of the total endothelial cells. The other cells in the TB group did not undergo apoptotic cell death.<br>
4.5.	Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)<br>
[0141] The eyes were enucleated and the anterior segments were fixed, in 1% glutaraldehyde and 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The specimens were postfixed in veronal acetate buffer osmium tetroxide (2%), dehydrated in ethanol and water, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were cut from blocks and mounted on copper grids. The specimens were observed with a JEM 100CX electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo).<br><br>
[0142] In the BBG group, the ultrastructure of the corneal cells and collagen cellular matrix was well preserved in the highest concentration of lOmg/ml (Fig. 12, left), hi the corneal endothelium, cellular membranes, well defined nuclei, and cytoplasmic organelle showed no degenerative changes (Fig. 12, bottom left). The ICG group showed well preserved structure of endothelial cells, but some endothelial cells demonstrated signs of mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 12, middle, arrows). The TB group showed cyst formation in the endothelial cell layer due to separation between the cells (Fig. 12, right), and occasional degeneration of corneal endothelium in a patchy fashion (Fig. 12, bottom right).<br>
4.6. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)<br>
[0143] The eyes were enucleated and the anterior segments fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The specimens were post-fixed in veronal acetate buffer osmium tetroxide (2%), and dehydrated in ethanol and water. The specimens were saturated in t-butyl alcohol, and critical point drying was performed (Eiko, Tokyo). The specimens were then placed on stubs by means of self-adhering carbon tabs and sputtered with Au of 20nm thickness by argon plasma coater (Eiko). Next, the endothelial surface of the cornea was studied with a JEM 840 scanning electron microscope (JEOL).<br>
[0144] In the BBG exposed corneas, SEM showed normal cells similar to those in the controls. The SEM image demonstrated a normal hexagonal endothelial cell sheet with intact borders and no endothelial swelling (Fig. 13, top). The ICG group also showed some cellular swellings in the corneal endothelial sheet. Occasionally, degenerated endothelial cells were observed to be free from the original location, hi the TB group, endothelial cell shrinkage was recognized in the central area of the cornea. The cell shrinkage led to endothelial cell loss in a sporadic fashion.<br>

5. Brilliant Blue- Assisted Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorhexis<br>
[0145] As stated above, the inventors reported the results of a preclinical study involving a new dye, Brilliant Blue G (BBG), which stained the anterior capsule at lower concentrations and with minimal toxicity. This example demonstrates the efficacy of BBG in capsular staining of a human eye.<br>
[0146] A 70-year-old woman with a white mature cataract underwent BBG-assisted CCC and phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in August 2004. The<br><br>
patient had no other ocular diseases, such as glaucoma, uveitis or corneal disorders. Coomassie® BBG 250 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was dissolved in intraocular irrigating solution (OPEGUARD®-MA; Senjyu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) at a dose of 0.25 mg/ml and sterilized with a syringe filter. The BBG solution was gently injected into the anterior chamber and then washed out immediately with balanced salt solution (BSS).<br>
[0147] According to Fig 14, the bright blue anterior capsule was clearly visible during the surgical production of the CCC. BBG solution (0.25 mg/ml) was injected into the anterior chamber of the eye, which was immediately irrigated. (A) The arrow indicates the CCC created in the eye, which had a white cataract. (B) The arrowheads show the margins of the completed CCC. (C) After phacoemulsification and aspiration, an IOL was inserted. The following day, no acute toxicity (such as corneal edema, severe inflammation or elevated intraocular pressure) was observed. The patient's visual acuity improved from light perception (LP) to 20/20 and a minimal corneal endothelial cell loss of 0.8% was observed after 2 months.<br>
[0148] This study was carried out with the approval of the Internal Review Board of our institution and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1989 Declaration of Helsinki. The potential benefits and risks of the treatment were explained to the patient and her informed consent was obtained before surgery.<br>
