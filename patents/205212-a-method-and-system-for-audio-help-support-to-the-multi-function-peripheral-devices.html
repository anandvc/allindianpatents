1        FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
The present invention in general relates to the field of Embedded System for Multi Function Peripherals (MFP), Printers, Mobile devices etc. More particularly this invention relates to a method and system for audio help support to multifunction peripheral devices.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
There are a number of MFP, Printers, Mobile devices, etc. available in the market. Generally user manuals are provided along with the devices which contain information with respect to configuration and operation of the devices. Basically these devices provide the user interface (Display LCD and Key board) for configuring or operating them. For example, if the user wants to configure a printer over the network, the system administrator is required to configure entities such as network IP, Domain Name through user interface provided in the device.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
In the existing scenario, generally a user manual is provided along with the devices to configure and operate the same. The user is required to read the manual to understand all the functionalities supported by the device. Here the device user in general and disabled person in particular will find it difficult to read the manual fully and refer it each time a doubt arises in the operation of the system. Further this process is quite time consuming and there is always the probability of losing the manuals. Moreover, if the same device needs to be used over a network, providing user manuals to all users over the network is a difficult and expensive affair.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is to invent a method and system for<br><br>
providing audio help support to the MFP, printers, mobiles etc. which is novel and unique.<br>
It is another object of the invention to help the users of MFP, printers, mobiles etc. to understand and operate the devices quickly with the help of audio help support and without going through the laborious process of reading voluminous user manuals.<br>
It is another object of the invention to eliminate costly user manuals and provide economical solution for any device user OR device users across the network.<br>
It is another object of the invention to help blind people to operate the device by enabling the option for auto help.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for providing audio help support to the users of MFP, printers, mobile devices etc. to configure and operate the device. This method eliminates the need for user manual. This will also have an option to enable auto audio help support for each menu, so that blind people can also configure and/or operate the device.<br>
The invention proposes two provisions for getting help, which can be enabled using configurable menu from both LCD user interface and web user interface. In the first provision, for getting any help for configuring or operating the device, a help switch/key on the keyboard is provided and whenever the user presses that button, while browsing any menu, he can get the audio help for the same.<br>
According to the second provision, the user can enable full time auto help so that the user can always get audio help support for all the menus and there is no need to press the Help switch/key.<br><br>
For providing the two provisions given above, the system needs support from both hardware and software. For switching between the said provisions, one menu is provided in the software through which one variable is set for the user selection of any one of above provisions. When the user presses the help key provided, an interrupt will be generated and the request will be sent to the audio driver in case the user selects the first provision. In case the user selects the second provision, while entering in any menu, a software event will be sent to audio driver for generating sound without the necessity of the help key being pressed.<br>
Providing help for different languages is also possible by keeping a track of the configured language on the device and as per the configured language, audio sound is generated.<br>
Accordingly this invention relates to a method for audio help support to the Multi function peripherals, printers, mobiles etc. for configuring and operating the device comprising the steps of enabling the help option in the user interface by using at least one provision of either using configurable menu from LCD user, or using configurable menu from web user interface, selecting between the option of help switch/key on the keyboard and the auto help mode, selecting the language from the software menu periodically, making the request to the audio drivers, receiving the users' request by interface task, analyzing the users' request for the particular help, picking up the string or .wav file from the storage and forwarding to audio controller task, audio sound controller task passing the same to .wav file reader or narrator software as per the input received from user interface task, receiving the inputs from .wav file or narrator software and generating the corresponding sound.<br>
Accordingly this invention further relates to a method for audio help support to the Multi function peripherals, printers, mobiles etc. for configuring and operating the device comprising the steps of selecting the option of disabling the auto help<br><br>
in the user interface by invoking the software menu, enabling the help option in the user interface by using at least one provision either by using configurable menu from LCD user, or by using configurable menu from web user interface, selecting the option of operation of help switch/key on the keyboard, selecting the language from the software menu periodically, selecting the option of auto request to the audio drivers, receiving the users' request by interface task, analyzing the users' request for the particular help, picking up the string or .wav file from the storage and forwarding to audio controller task, audio sound controller task passes the same to .wav file reader or narrator software as per the input received from user interface task, receiving the inputs from .wav file or narrator software and generating the corresponding sound;<br>
Accordingly this invention further relates a system for implementing audio help support to the Multi function peripherals, printers, mobiles etc. for configuring and operating the device wherein the user interface means has an additional trap for the new help key for disabling auto help support and means for switching between the two provisions.<br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and the detailed description as follows:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows a typical block diagram of a scheme for implementation of audio help for configuration and operation of electronic devices like printer, MFP etc.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention comprises the following for the implementation of the method of providing audio help support towards configuration and operation of the MFP, printer, mobile etc.:<br><br>
1.	Hardware button forgetting audio help (Help Key):<br>
There is an additional key provided on the keyboard of the device, which will be used to create sound for getting help for any menu.<br>
2.	Speaker and headphone support:<br>
The speaker or headphone is used to create the audio sound.<br>
3.	Audio driver:<br>
This audio driver is used to create audio sound.<br>
4.	.wav File reader:<br>
This software is used for interpretation of .wav file.<br>
5.	Narrator software:<br>
This software is used to convert any string into audible sound.<br>
6.	Language support menu:<br>
A software menu for configuring language is provided in the user interface with the help of an LCD and a keyboard driver for language support through which a variable is set for tracking languages. The values for this variable are used by user interface task for picking up the localized string to be sent to audio sound controller task.<br>
7.	Menu for Auto Enable:<br>
A software menu for enabling or disabling the auto help is provided in the user interface with the help of an LCD and a keyboard driver for setting or resetting the auto help support.<br>
8.	Storage mechanism:<br>
The const string two dimensional array variables are provided for storing the messages into memory for each language. The second dimension size is<br><br>
selected as the number of languages supported by the device and each string will contain all localized versions of the message.<br>
The MFP, Printers, Mobile devices, etc. have a keyboard 10 and a LCD display 16 unit for providing user interface support to the device. A user interface task 14 runs in the background all the time and as soon as it gets some message from keyboard 10 it sends the required display message to LCD driver and also sends message to some other functionality task 20 for providing desired user input functionality. (The user is provided with the full information about the functionality, which is provided by the device using user interface.)<br>
There are two provisions for getting help, which can be enabled using configurable menu from both LCD user interface and web user interface. In the first provision, for getting any help for configuring and/or operating the device, a help switch/key on the key board 10 is provided and whenever the user while browsing any menu, presses that button, the user gets the audio help for the same. According to the second provision, the user can enable full time auto help so that the user can always get audio help support for all the menus and there is no need to press the Help switch/key every time. Providing help for different languages is also possible by keeping track of the configured language on the device and as per the configured language, audio sound is generated.<br>
Depending on the context in which the help button is pressed, appropriate help string or .wav file 26 is picked up from the storage 24 and forwarded to audio controller task 22 for generation of the required sound. In this invention, two indexes are used of which one index is for keeping track of each language and the other index is to keep track of each menu for accessing the help string or help .wav file. According to the index chosen the .wav file or the help string will be picked up from the storage and is sent to the .wav file reader 26 or Narrator software 28 for producing the audio sound for the same with the help of Audio driver 30.<br><br>
The user interface task carries the message for the user pressed key. If the user presses the help button/key while browsing any particular menu, then as per this invention, an additional function gets a call. Before calling this function, each menu updates the global variable for menu index. This function uses the global variable for language and the menu index and as per these variables, the function picks the global two-dimensional strings or .wav file and passes the same to audio sound controller task 22 with the help of event.<br>
Generally, a user interface task 14 is provided for receiving user messages. The user interface task 14 of the present invention is provided with one additional trap for new Help Key (Auto help support disable). The task also updates the language index and the menu index in global structure for help input. If the user presses help key, then it picks up the corresponding help string or .wav file from storage and sends the same to the audio sound controller task 22. The audio sound controller task 22 passes the same to .wav file reader 26 or narrator software 28 as per the input received from user interface task 14. The .wav file reader 26 or the narrator software 28 interprets the same and passes the output to the audio driver 30 to create the corresponding sound.<br>
