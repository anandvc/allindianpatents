CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS <br>
[0001]    The present application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. provisional application no. 60/588,599, filed July 16, 2004, entitled "Channel Tracking with Scattered Pilots", the content of which is incorporate herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE <br>
[0002]    The present disclosure relates to wireless digital communication systems and, amongst other things, to estimation of channel characteristics and interference level in such systems.<br>
[0003]    Demand for wireless digital communication and data processing systems is on the rise. Inherent in most digital communication channels are errors introduced when transferring frames, packets or cells containing data. Such errors are often caused by electrical interference or thermal noise. Data transmission error rates depend, in part, on the medium which carries the data. Typical bit error rates for copper based data transmission systems are in the order of 10"6. Optical fibers have typical bit error rates of 10-9 or less. Wireless transmission systems, on the other hand, may have error rates of 10-3 or higher. The relatively high bit error rates of wireless transmission systems pose certain difficulties in encoding and decoding of data transmitted via such systems. Partly because of its mathematical tractability and partly because of its application to a broad class of physical communication channels, the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) model is often used to characterize the noise in most communication channels.<br>
[0004]    Data is often encoded at the transmitter, in a controlled manner, to include redundancy. The redundancy is subsequently used by the receiver to overcome the noise and interference introduced in the data while being transmitted through the channel. For example, the transmitter might encode k bits with n bits where n is greater than k, according to some coding scheme. The amount of redundancy introduced by the encoding of the data is determined by the ratio n/k, the inverse of which is referred to as the code rate. Codewords representing the n-bit sequences are generated by an encoder <br>
and delivered to a modulator that interfaces with the communication channel. The modulator maps each received sequence into a symbol. In M-ary signaling, the modulator maps each n-bit sequence into one of M= 2n symbols. Data in other than binary form may be encoded, but typically data is representable by a binary digit sequence. Often it is desired to estimate and track the channel so as to be able to perform operations, such as channel equalization and channel-sensitive signaling.<br>
[0005]    Orthogonal frequency division modulation (OFDM) is sensitive to time-frequency synchronization. Use of pilot tones allows channel estimation to characterize the transmission pathways. Keeping transmitters synchronized with receivers reduces error rates of transmission.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0006]   In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a system adapted to estimate and track a channel for wireless orthogonal frequency division modulation (OFDM) communication. The system comprises first and second modules. The first module is configured to receive a number of pilot symbols arbitrarily scattered between a plurality of data symbols transmitted via at least one transmit antenna. The number of pilot symbols are received via a number of taps indicative of the delay and multipath effects of the channel. The second module is configured to estimate the channel value using the plurality of received pilot symbols and in accordance with iterative correlation of the channel taps over time. The second module performs link scheduling using the channel value.<br>
[0007]   In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method of estimating and tracking a channel of a wireless OFDM communication system. In one step, pilot symbols are received that are scattered between data symbols transmitted via at least one transmit antenna. The pilot symbols are received via a plurality of taps indicative of the delay and multipath effects of the channel. The pilot symbols are scattered arbitrarily among at least one of time or OFDM sub-carrier. The channel value is estimated using the plurality of received pilot symbols and in accordance with correlation of the channel taps over time.<br>
[0008]    In yet another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a system adapted to estimate and track a channel for wireless OFDM communication system. The system includes receiving means and estimating means. The receiving means receives pilot<br><br>
symbols arbitrarily scattered between a multitude of data symbols transmitted via at least one transmit antenna. The pilot symbols are received via taps indicative of the delay and multipath effects of the channel. The estimating means estimates the channel value using the plurality of received pilot symbols and in accordance with iterative correlation of the channel taps over time. The channel comprises a plurality of OFDM sub-channels.<br>

Rather, the ensuing description of the preferred exemplary embodiment(s) will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing a preferred exemplary embodiment of the disclosure.

[0016]    Also, it is noted that the embodiments may be described as a process which is depicted as a flowchart, a flow diagram, a data flow diagram, a structure diagram, or a block diagram. Although a flowchart may describe the operations as a sequential process, many of the operations can be performed in parallel or concurrently. In addition, the order of the operations may be re-arranged. A process is terminated when its operations are completed, but could have additional steps not included in the figure. A process may correspond to a method, a function, a procedure, a subroutine, a subprogram, etc. When a process corresponds to a function, its termination corresponds to a return of the function to the calling function or the main function.<br>
[0017]   Furthermore, embodiments may be implemented by hardware, software, firmware, middleware, microcode, hardware description languages, or any combination thereof. When implemented in software, firmware, middleware or microcode, the program code or code segments to perform the necessary tasks may be stored in a machine readable medium such as storage medium, A process or(s) may perform the necessary tasks.

Information, arguments, parameters, data, etc. may be passed, forwarded, or transmitted via any suitable means including memory sharing, message passing, token passing, network transmission, etc.<br>
[0018]    Estimation and tracking of a time-varying frequency-selective channel in a multi-carrier system is carried out in accordance with an algorithm that uses scattered pilot tones with arbitrary, random, pseudo-random, and/or substantially random time-frequency pattern. The pilot tones have a known modulation and coding scheme such the time that they were transmitted can be determined. The algorithm is based on a<br><br>
linear model that recursively estimates the channel value at any instance of time using a previous estimate of the channel together with the received values of the pilot symbols. The channel value is an indicator of the channel, for example, channel quality indicator (CQI), signal-to-noise ratio, signal strength, or any other measurement of channel sensitive signaling, including space-selective channel conditions. The algorithm uses a number of parameters representative of the channel loading, the ratio of pilot symbols to the received noise level, and the covariance matrix of the channel estimation error. The algorithm modifies such parameter values and the channel estimate until the modified parameter values and the channel estimate converge to satisfy predefined conditions. The channel value is used for link scheduling in one embodiment.<br>
[0019]    The pilot tones have a known modulation and coding scheme such that receivers do not need to necessarily know when they are being transmitted to recognize them as pilot tones. The receivers are geographically distributed across the wireless space such that they serve as taps with varying propagation delay and multipath effects from the transmitter. A channel estimate can be iteratively determined based upon analysis of the taps for the pilot tones. The channel estimate can be used for link scheduling in one embodiment.<br>
[0020]    In accordance with the present disclosure, estimation and tracking of a time-varying frequency-selective channel in a multi-carrier system is carried out using scattered pilot tones that have an arbitrary time-frequency pattern. The channel estimate is an unbiased estimate of the channel, and furthermore, the covariance matrix of the estimation error defined by the difference between the actual and the estimated value of the channel has a minimum variance. However, it is understood that there may be insubstantial variations around such estimates.<br>
[0021]    To estimate and track the channel, a linear model is assumed according to which, at any instance of time, a previous estimate of the channel together with the received values of the pilot symbols are used to estimate a new value for the channel. The pilot symbols may be part of a transmission protocol with which the wireless communication system is configured to comply and thus may be part of, e.g., the signal field. Alternatively, the pilot symbols may be extra symbols inserted between the data symbols for the purpose of estimating the channel.<br><br>
[0022]    In one embodiment, the system may be an OFDMA system and the initial value assigned to the channel may have a value of zero. The estimation/tracking algorithm uses, in part, a first parameter representative of the channel loading and adapted to balance contribution of the received pilot symbols with a previous estimate of the channel, a second parameter representative of the ratio of the pilot symbols to the received noise, as well as a third parameter obtained by performing a trace operation on a covariance matrix of the estimation error.<br>
[0023]    In accordance with the present algorithm, the first parameter value and the channel are updated recursively so as to arrive at new estimate values. The third parameter value is also updated to reflect the modified value of the first parameter. The modifications continue recursively until the values of the first parameter, the channel estimate, and the third parameter converge so as to meet predefined conditions.<br>
[0024]    The algorithm underlying channel estimation/tracking assumes a finite support of the time-domain response of the channel and uses the time-domain correlation of the channel response related to the known Doppler spectrum of the channel variations or an approximation thereof. The algorithm also accounts for singularities that occur in the initial phase of the channel estimation/tracking due to the limited number of the pilot symbols used. The algorithm provides a best-effort estimation of the channel state information through the limited number of the pilot symbols available on the control channels of the OFDMA reverse link. The algorithm may be used for channel sensitive scheduling such as forward link beam forming or frequency sensitive scheduling.<br>
[0025]    In accordance with the present disclosure, estimation and tracking of a time-varying frequency-selective channel in a multi-carrier system is carried out using scattered pilot tones that have an arbitrary time-frequency pattern. Scattered pilots appear at different tones over time and are substantially scattered across the band. The channel estimate is a substantially unbiased estimate. Furthermore, the covariance matrix of the estimation error defined by the difference between the actual and the estimate value of the channel has a substantially minimum variance.<br>
[0026]    The above algorithms and methods described above may be performed on a per antenna basis. Such that, the channel may be estimated for each antenna. These estimates may be utilized to obtain the spatial signature or the space-time signature of<br><br>
the channel. The estimates can then be utilized for providing beam forming, beam steering, or other spatial functionality.<br>
[0027]    The algorithm underlying channel estimation/tracking assumes a finite support of the time-domain response of the channel and uses the time-domain correlation of the channel response related to the known Doppler spectrum of the channel variations or an approximation thereof. The algorithm also accounts for singularities that occur in the initial phase of the channel estimation/tracking due to the limited number of the pilot symbols used. The algorithm provides a best-effort estimation of the channel state information through the limited number of the pilot symbols available on the control channels of the OFDMA reverse link. The algorithm may be used for channel sensitive scheduling such as forward link beam forming or frequency sensitive scheduling.<br>
[0028] Figure 1 shows an example of a wireless network 10 being used for communications among transmitters/receivers 12, 14 and transmitters/receivers 16,18 as indicated. Each of the transmitters/receivers 12, 14, 16, 18 may have a single or multiple transmit/receive antennas (not shown). While separate transmit and receive antennas are shown, antennas may be used for both transmitting and receiving signals. The free space medium forming the channel through which the signals are transmitted is often noisy affecting the received signal. Estimates of the transmission channel's characteristics and the interference level due to noise are often made at the receiver, which indicative of the taps. Geographic location in the wireless space causes differing delays for the taps.<br>
[0029] Figure 2 is a simplified block diagram of an embodiment of a transmitting end of wireless transmission system 100. Wireless transmission system is shown as including, in part, an encoder 110, a space-frequency interleaver 120, modulators 130, 160, OFDM blocks 140,170, and transmit antennas 150,180. Modulator 130, OFDM block 140, and transmit antenna 150 are disposed in the first transmission path 115; and modulator 160, OFDM block 170, and transmit antenna 180 are disposed in the second transmission path 125. Although the exemplary embodiment 100 of the wireless transmission system is shown as including only the two depicted transmission paths, it is understood that the wireless transmission system 100 may include more than two transmission paths. The data transmitted by the transmit antennas 150, 180 are received by one or more receive antennas of a wireless receive system. For example, pilot<br><br>
symbols and data symbols are transmitted on various sub-carriers of the OFDM channel.<br>
[0030] Figure 3 is a simplified block diagram of an embodiment of a receiving end of a wireless receiving system 200. Wireless receiving system 200 is shown as including, in part, receive antenna 205, 255, front-end blocks 210, 260, demodulators 215, 265, space-frequency deinterleavers 220,270, and decoders 225, 285. Wireless receiving system 200 is shown as including a pair of receive transmission paths, it is understood that the wireless transmission system 200 may include more than two transmission paths. Pilot symbols and data symbols are received by the wireless receiving system 200. Each transmission path is related to a particular sub-carrier. Analysis of the pilot symbols iteratively over time allows characterizing the channel.<br>
[0031] Further, the estimates may be iteratively performed for each receiver chain, e.g. a separate estimate for receptions at antenna 205 and 255. This allows for the channel to be estimated for each spatial channel between the transmitter and receiver. The estimates may be utilized, e.g. combined, to obtain the spatial signature or the space-time signature of the channel from the different channels for each antenna. The estimates can then be utilized for providing beam forming, beam steering, or other spatial functionality.<br>
[0032] Assume an OFDM or OFDMA transmission with N orthogonal tones that are spaced by fs. Assume further that the transmitter sends pilot symbols over a certain time frequency pattern known to the receiver, as shown in Fig. 4. In the following, it is assumed the total number of different pilot tones N in the time-frequency pattern is greater than or equal to the number of taps L of the channel, i.e., N &gt;L. Such a pilot pattern enables estimation of a baseband channel response with up to L taps. In the following analysis, the effect of the excess delay is assumed negligible. It is also assumed that the channel variations over the OFDMA symbol duration Ts = l//s is also negligible, and that the noise is a AWGN. Assume that the channel hk is represented by the following expression:<br><br>
[0033]    Channel hk is thus a Lxl vector of channel taps with relative delays<br>
[j ..... IL_J for any given time instance tfc . The time instance may be representative of<br>
the channel update step, a single OFDMA symbol duration, slot or frame duration, etc. Assume further that the channel is a time-varying channel having a scalar complex Gaussian first order channel process, as shown below in expression (1):<br>
 [0034]    In expression (1), JVC(»,«) represents a complex circular Gaussian vector specified by its mean and covariance matrix respectively, and I, is an (• x •) identity matrix. It is further assumed that the process is stationary over a tracking interval so that rfc , defined by the following expression:<br>
may be obtained from the channel variation model, e.g., its Doppler spectrum. It is<br>
assumed that rfc is known.<br>
[0035]    The signal xk received at step k may thus be defined as shown below in expression (2):<br>
where p2 = (Ep/N0) represents the pilot-to-noise ratio, H[mfc] represents the channel frequency response corresponding to the pilot tone with index mfc , where (0 
where wk represents the direction of the pilot tone with index mfc .<br>
[0036]    In the above, it is assumed that there is one tone per step, thus enabling the channel estimate to be updated with only one pilot observation per step, which in turn, reduces the complexity of channel estimation/tracking. It is understood, however, that when multiple tones are observed at once, there may be multiple steps corresponding to<br>
the same time instance t (e.g. ^ = tfc-1 = ...)• The estimate hfc of the channel at step k is defined by the following expression:<br>
[0037]    Because it is assumed that the channel is Gaussian, its estimate hfc is also<br>
Gaussian. The channel estimator, in accordance with the present algorithm, is unbiased and has a minimum variance. In the most general case, this enables the expected value<br>
of hfc to coincide with the projection of the true channel hfconto the subspace spanned by the directions wk of pilot tones used in the estimation/tracking throughout the step<br>
fc . In the startup phase, this condition ensures that no noise is collected in the subspace where no channel information is available. In the steady state when the present/past pilots span the entire L -dimensional space, this condition provides the following expression:<br>
Accordingly, the channel estimate may be defined as below:<br>
where P,c is the projector onto the subspace spanned by the available pilot directions, as shown below:<br>
and 0,,. is the covariance matrix of the estimation error dhk = (hk - Pkhk}.<br>
[0038]    The variance of the estimate of the channel response H[m] corresponding to<br>
hfe and evaluated at data tones m e &amp;D is represented below by Hfc[m] , and the present algorithm seeks to minimize the average variance of Hfc[m] . The following expression (5) applies to a multicarrier system:<br>
 [0039]    The exact equality in expression (5) holds when the set Q0 of data tones coincides with the whole set of tones: QD = {1, . . . , JV } . The asymptotic equivalent in<br>
expression (5) holds whenever the data tones are evenly distributed over the whole spectrum. With an appropriate design of the time-frequency pilot pattern and assuming a wide sense stationary channel process, the estimation/tracking provides a steady phase covariance matrix Q^ which equals a scaled identity, thereby ensuring the minimum worst case variance in the steady phase.<br>
[0040]    Linear estimate hkof hk combines the pilot observation xk as well as the estimate hfc_t obtained at the previous step and is defined as shown below in expression (6)<br>
Using expressions (l)-(4), Linear estimate hk may be written as below:<br>
 [0041]    Linear estimator (7) is shown as including expressions representative of the mean and error values. Assume without loss of generality that Ak is full rank. Accordingly \ may further be defined as follows:<br>
/ \ # where (•)  denotes Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse operator. To simplify the estimation<br>
algorithm further, assume a class of linear estimators defined as shown below:<br><br>
where the loading parameter yk is a non-negative scalar that balances the contribution by the current pilot against those by the previous channel estimate h.,^ . This<br>
simplification avoids the computational complexity. Linear estimator h,,. may thus be written as shown below:<br>
 [0042]    An update rule for yk and the resulting estimation accuracy quantified by Tr{@fc} is developed below, where Qk is the covariance matrix of the error term in<br>
expression (7), and Tr is a trace operator. Using expressions (1), (2), (4), (7),(9) and (10), the following recursion is obtained:<br>
 [0043]    To determine a value for yk during the startup phase, it is assumed that •F*fc-i 
tone contributes with a new direction to the channel estimate; this condition requires the following:<br>
thus leading to the following result:<br>
 [0044]    Expression (13) is invariant with respect to the loading parameter yk . A single observation (e.g. xk ) can provide an estimate of a single degree of freedom. In the startup phase, appending an extra pilot results in adding an extra direction to the channel estimate since the inclusion span{Pk_l] c span{Pfc} takes place. In other words, the<br>
value of xk is transformed into the estimate of the scaling applied to the orthogonal projection of the normalized version of wk onto the subspace which is the orthogonal complement of Pk_1 to the entire space. Since the old estimate hfc_j is within the span of Pfc_! , the balancing between the new pilot contribution and the old estimate has no effect. This enables loading factor yk to be chosen arbitrarily in the startup phase. In particular, yk may be selected so as to have a relatively small value. One advantage of such values for yk is the elimination of pseudo-inverse operations, as shown below:<br>
[0045]    Linear estimator hk may thus be written as shown below:<br>
where the loading yk is set to a small value in the startup phase, where k = 1 ..... L .<br>
[0046]    The matrix inversion operation in expression (14) may be efficiently carried out due to the matrix inversion lemma. The resulting simplified update of the estimator<br>
lik is shown in following expression (15) that is used to provide an estimate of and track the channel:<br>
where fik = Y* • Selection of the loading factor /fc, or equivalently kduring the steady phase k &gt; L is described first. After performing relevant algebra, an analog of expression (13) in the steady phase provides the following recursions:<br>
[0047]    The exact minimization of Tr{Qk} with respect to parameter /?te is complicated because of the non-trivial relationship between the eigenstructure of Qk and the structure of the projectors JIfc and 12^. As described above, in a steady mode, Q,,.<br>
should converge to a scaled identity matrix, based on the assumptions of the time-frequency structure of the pilot and stationary channel process. Over any substantial number of steps, pilot tones are evenly distributed over the signal bandwidth. Specifically, it is assumed that for any /CQ = 1,2,..., the following condition applies:<br>
 [0048]    Condition (18) is statistically satisfied (i.e. with probability one) when a pseudo-random pilot pattern is used. With respect to the channel process, it is assumed<br><br>
that rk converges to a fixed r_ as k increases. In many instances, it may be assumed that rfc is constant, i.e., rfc = r. In other instances, e.g., variable update time, rk may vary.<br>
[0049]    Assume that the sequence {wk} is a process with the identity covariance<br>
matrix. It can be shown that any quadratic form vHQkv , where (||w|   = 1), under the minimum trace criterion and the update rule (15), is a monotonic (non-increasing) sequence which is lower bounded by zero. Hence vHQkv converges to a certain limit. The limits are the same for different v . Two other observations are made. First, a steady phase in the following form may be considered for Qk:<br>
[0050]    This enables rewriting the recursion (16) with respect to Qk as an approximate recursion with respect to A2, , as shown below:<br>
wherein the approximation is expected to be accurate in the steady phase.<br>
[0051]    It is desired to find j3k = ykl , corresponding to /^ defined in expression (17), such that it would lead to the minimum of (21). Nearly optimal /?fc and the corresponding A2, may be obtained as shown below:<br>
 [0052]    The recursions defined by (22)-(23) are used to update the factor /?fc . Together with expression (15), this recursion provides estimation and tracking of the channel. The steady phase estimation error A^, may be determined by substituting recursion (22) into (23), which yields the following result:<br><br>
 [0053]    It can be shown that expression (24), which is quadratic with respect to A^ ,<br>
has a single positive root. A closed form solution to expression (24) may be found. Table I provides a summary of channel estimation/tracking procedure described above in a pseudo-code form:<br><br>
 [0054]    The two parameters to be specified are j30 and A2. A relatively large value may be selected for /3Q (relatively small value for y0 = ^J1) while ensuring a numerically stable algorithm. The value of A^ reflects the magnitude of the estimation error at the end of the startup phase. The covariance matrix Qk may be different from an identity matrix at the end of the startup phase, hence selection of A^ will always be an<br>
approximation except for a few special cases, such as when wl	WL are orthogonal<br>
and channel variations through the startup phase can be considered negligible. For very slow varying channels, the magnitude of the error will be proportional to/?"2!,'1.<br>
[0055]    It is also possible to choose the initial error at the same level as the actual channel, i.e., by setting AQ - 1. Such a choice is generally more reliable because the<br>
estimation accuracy at the end of the startup phase may vary depending on the particular<br>
sequence n\,..., mL of pilots in the startup phase. A relatively large value for Ag will<br>
result in a somewhat slower convergence of the tracking procedure, recognizing that<br>
convergence speed may not be the overriding factor for the best effort acquisition of the<br>
channel state information. It is understood, however, that an optimal selection of A^<br>
may be provided given the set rr^	mL.<br>
[0056]    Table 2 further simplifies the pseudo-code of Table I. Table n uses a common initialization and does not distinguish between the startup phase and the steady phase. This simplification has no effect on the steady phase.<br>
[0057]    Proper characterization of the channel process, shown in expression (24), depends on the Doppler spectrum of channel variations. Specifically,<br><br>
where SD (/) is the power spectral density of channel variations which typically<br>
depends on the velocity of a mobile terminal as well as the propagation environment. One conventional model assumes a fixed velocity and rich scattering in the vicinity of a mobile terminal, with the uniform azimuth distribution. The corresponding Doppler spectrum, known as the U-shaped spectrum, is defined as following:<br>
where fD = fc vm/c with carrier frequency fc , mobile speed vm and c = 3-108m/s. [0058]    Another conventional model assumes a uniform spectrum defined below:<br>
 [0059]    The time-frequency pilot pattern used herein is defined by the following expression:<br>
Such a pattern ensures a uniform coverage of the entire bandwidth over any limited time period, thereby enabling the estimation and tracking of fast varying channels. [0060]    The channel estimation and tracking may be carried out using various codes of one or more software modules forming a program and executed as instructions/data by, e.g., a central processing unit, or using hardware modules specifically configured and dedicated to determine the channel and interference level. Alternatively, the channel estimation may be carried out using a combination of software and hardware modules.<br>
