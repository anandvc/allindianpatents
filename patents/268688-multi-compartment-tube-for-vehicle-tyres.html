PROVISIONAL / COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See section 10 and rule 13)<br>
1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION "Multi-compartment Tube for Vehicle Tyres."<br>
2.  APPLICANT<br>
(a)	NAME	:  MAHINDRA 85 MAHINDRA LTD.<br>
(b)	NATIONALITY:      Indian Company registered under the provisions of<br>
the Companies Act, 1956<br>
(c)  ADDRESS	: R&amp;D Centre, Auto Sector,<br>
89, M.I.D.C, NASHIK - 422 007, Maharashtra State, India<br><br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION PROVISIONAL<br>
The following specification describes the invention.<br><br>
COMPLETE<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
1<br><br>
Title:<br>
Multi-compartment Tube for Vehicle Tyres.<br>
Technical Field:<br>
The present invention relates to an air tube for vehicle wheels, having a remarkable damping performance on the effects produced by an abrupt pressure focused on the wheel. More specifically, the present invention relates to a pneumatic tube which is used in the interior part of the vehicle tyre, to act as a safety device by maintaining high degree of pressure in the event of puncture or similar circumstances.<br>
Background and Prior Art:<br>
The tyre of a pneumatic wheel is installed on a wheel rim similar to the tyres of conventional vehicles. Such vehicle tyres are construed to resist deformation under pressure and thereby assure safety while the vehicle is moving straight or around a turn.<br>
It is a well known fact that the pneumatic tyres of the vehicle wheels are prone to puncture by sharp items which, in the case of pneumatic tyres of the kind having inner tube, generally arises by such objects penetrating the tread portion of the outer cover and then penetrating and puncturing the inner tube.<br>
Pneumatic tubes for vehicles are provided with an inflatable tube, sometimes formed by the tyre itself, displaying a strong rebound effect when the wheel suffers a strong concentrated pressure, either because wheel runs on a rough ground or runs into an obstacle sticking particularly out of the ground, or because the vehicle jumps onto a track while running at high speed. The susceptibility of the pneumatic tyre to puncture may be avoided with varying degrees of success. Methods which attempt to prevent puncture<br>
2<br><br>
altogether appear to have been limited to date to so-called tyre-liners which are attached to the inside of the tyre.<br>
Conventionally, some methods are known to prevent the puncture of the tyres; for example:<br>
UK patent no. GB2361679 discloses pneumatic tube with compartments connected with reinforcement membrane, main air tubes, internal inlet and outlet valves, external inlet and outlet valves. The inner tube comprises a fabricated cylindrical rubber tube having numerous individual air compartments connected together by reinforcement membranes, each compartment incorporating an air inlet valve connected to a main air pipe for inflation, and one air outlet valve which is correspondingly connected to a second main air pipe for releasing pressurized air. It has engagement plurality of reinforcement members to provide sealed air compartments. This arrangement prevents the possibility of tyre going completely flat or blow out. However the arrangement of tube compartment with number of inlet and outlet valves makes the design and maintenance complex.<br>
European patent no. EP0432079, Japanese Patent No. JP3253404 and Spanish patent no. ES2017884 describes pneumatic tube for vehicle wheels with plurality of compartments separated by partition walls provided and provided with one way valves in the partition wall. When a pneumatic tube receives a strong concentrated pressure, the air shifts within the tube through the valves only in one sense particularly in opposite to the sense of tyre rotation. The design helps in achieving the damping of the tyre rebound effect. But in case of puncture or breach tyre goes completely flat slowly.<br>
Belgium patent no. BE902442, discloses inner tube for motor vehicle tyre provided with internal partitions to define separate compartments each<br>
3<br><br>
connecting to a common line, e.g. in the inner perimeter, via two non-return valves with opposite action. This line is provided with a valve which is accessible from outside to inflate or deflate the compartments simultaneously.<br>
Chinese patent no. CN1222456 claims partitioned burst preventing inner tube of tyre consisting of inner tube, partitioning separation layer, partitioned compartments, two sub-air valves, concentrated air supplying pipe and total air valve. It features its separation layer inside the inner tube and the sub-air valves installed between the partitioned compartment and the concentrated air supplying pipe.<br>
Deficiencies of Prior Art:<br>
1.	In many of the prior art inventions the arrangement of tube compartment makes the design and maintenance complex.<br>
2.	In some prior art designs, the designs helps in achieving the damping of the tyre rebound effect but in case of puncture, tyre goes completely flat slowly.<br>
3.	The flat tyres and tubeless tyres used in the prior art are very costly and need sensors to monitor the pressure change which are equally expensive.<br>
4.	No inventions mentioned in the prior art provides more surface area for heat dissipation produced during the process.<br>
4<br><br>
Object of the Present Invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide multi-compartment inner tube, which prevents tyre going completely flat in the event of puncture or so.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide more surface area leading to more heat dissipation and avoid chances of bursting the tube due to friction between tyre and tube.<br>
The further object of the present invention is to provide improved means for protecting from puncture the inner tube of the pneumatic tyre.<br>
Description of the Drawing of the Present Invention:<br>
Figure  1 shows the Multi-compartment tube in its assembled condition, according to present invention.<br>
Description of the Present Invention:<br>
The foregoing objects of the invention are accomplished and the problems and shortcomings associated with prior art techniques and approaches are overcome by the present invention as described bellow in the preferred embodiment.<br>
Detailed description of the preferred embodiment is provided herein; however, it is to be understood that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or matter.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment (1) as shown in the drawing, multi-compartment tube is enclosed in the rubber tyre (2). Each compartment (3) of the pneumatic tube is an individual air pocket, which is<br>
5<br><br>
connected to one rubber base (4). The rubber base is wrapped around the rim (6) of the wheel on the inner side of rubber tyre (2). Each compartment (3) of the multi compartment tube is provided with valve (5) which aid in filling and or releasing air to or from the individual compartment. Preferably, five to six compartments are sufficient for smooth travel of the vehicle. The tyre remains stable in case one of the compartments get damaged or punctured.<br>
It is clear that the invention in accordance with the aforesaid is well adapted to carry out the objectives mentioned herein. While presently preferred embodiment of the invention has been described for the purposes of this disclosure. The embodiment of the invention as described above and the methods disclosed herein will suggest further modification and alterations to those skilled in the art. Such further modifications and alterations may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
Advantages of the present invention:<br>
1.	In the present invention, since there are multiple compartments, even if the sharp object penetrates the tube, only one compartment will lose its air, the others will remain inflated and the tire will remain dynamically stable.<br>
2.	In the present invention, the air within the remaining compartment of the tube will provide the means of safe traveling without the threat of total depression, blow out or skidding to a position where the puncture of the tire can be attended to.<br>
6<br><br>
3.	In the present invention the tube has got more surface area, so the heat dissipation is more in the present invention.<br>
4.	In the present invention, an embodiment of the device is made of various light durable materials, which provide the degree of durability and strength necessary.<br>
