				<td>TASTELESS. DIRECTLY COMPRESSIBLE. FAST-DISSOLVING COMPLEXES AND PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS THEREOF<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to novel tasteless complexes of bitter<br>
salts of basic drugs and oral dosage forms thereof. More particularly, this invention relates to fexofenadine-carbomer complexes, novel formulations thereof, and processes for preparing the complexes and the dosage forms.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]	Conventional oral solid dosage forms are difficult to administer. In<br>
particular children and elderly patients often experience difficulty in swallowing tablets and capsules. Moreover, it is inconvenient to comply with solid oral dosages during travels. Addressing these disadvantages, drugs have been formulated as chewable, dispersible or mouth-dissolving tablets, as dry powders for reconstitution, or as liquid oral dosage forms. These formulations allow greater exposixre of the drug to the taste buds, resulting in problems of patient compliance when bitter or unpleasant tasting drugs are to be administered.<br>
[0003]	Consequently, various taste-masking techniques have been devised.<br>
The known arts address, in various preferred ways, the problems in formulating bitter tasting drugs. For drugs having minor bitterness, conventional taste masking techniques, such as the use of sweeteners and flavoring agents, are employed. However, for highly bitter drugs, techniques like complexation, fluidized bed coating, microencapsulation and solid dispersion involving the use of certain polymers are employed. These techniques are either very technologj'-<br>
intensive, requiring sophisticated equipment, or involving the use of organic solvents. The use of organic solvents generates regulatory and safety concerns. There are safety concerns particularly with respect to pediatric patients. Additionally, in many instances, a very large amount of polymer is used for taste masking or the polymer is such that the drug is released in the intestines. Further, the polymers used in taste masking adversely affect the release patterns of the drugs, and consequently the drugs' bioavailability.<br>
[0004]	The known arts fail to effectively address the above disadvantages.<br>
In particular, the known techniques have proved to be inefficient in masking bitter tasting salts of basic drugs. An example of such a bitter tasting salt of a basic drugs is fexofenadine hydrochloride. Fexofenadine hydrochloride is a histamine Hi-receptor antagonist with the chemical name (±)-4-[l-hydroxy-4-[4-(hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-l-piperidinyl]-butyl]-a,a-dimethylbenzene   acetic   acid<br>
hydrochloride. The molecular weight of this histamine Hi-receptor antagonist is 538.13, and its empirical formula is C32H39NO4 HCl. Fexofenadine hydrochloride is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis and with chronic idiopathic urticaria in adults and in children of and above the age of 6 years.<br>
[0005]	The recommended dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride is 30 mg twice<br>
daily for children between 6 and 11 years and 60 mg twice daily for adults and children above 11 years. The solid dosage forms available are either 60 mg capsules or 30/60 mg film coated tablets, which are to be swallowed orally, thus making the drug administration difficult, especially for children, elderly patients and during travel. Therefore it would be useful to devise a taste masked, granular, directly compressible, fast dissolving, stable complex of fexofenadine hydrochloride, which can be used in orally-disintegrating, mouth-dissolving, dispersible or chewable tablets.<br>
[0006]	Use   of cation-exchange   resins   (such   as   polysulfonic   acid   and<br>
polycarboxylic acid polymers and their potassium salts) to adsorb amine drugs or their pharmaceutical acid salts for taste-masking and sustained release has been reported. These resins form insoluble adsorbates or resinates through weak ionic bonding with oppositely charged drugs. The adsorbates thus maintain a low solution concentration of drug in a suspension free of soluble counterions. They dissociate only at an acidic pH and hence remain in complexed form in the neutral pH of saliva, providing no or very little bitter taste in the mouth. After ingestion and exposure to ions in stomach, the resinate dissociates and drug is eluted to be absorbed. This technique, when used for fexofenadine hydrochloride, did not yield the desired results. A large quantity of resin (potassium salt of cross linked polyacryhc copolymer - polyacrihn potassium USNF 18) - three times that of the drug - was consumed for taste-masking. Moreover, it suffered from the major disadvantage of very poor binding and compressibihty properties. This made the process unviable for tablets.<br>
[0007]	The art disclosed in the United States Patent No. 4, 808, 411 to Lu,<br>
et al. describes a polymer-carrier system devised to reduce the bitterness of erythromycin and its 6-0-methyl derivative, clarithromycin, by absorption to Carbopol®. The macrolide-Carbopol complexes are prepared by dissolving or slurrying predetermined ratios of drug and polymer in water or hydroalcoholic mixtures. Taste protection is further improved by encapsulating the adsorbate particles with enteric polymer coatings, such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (hereinafter referred to as "HPMCP"). The mechanism of macrolide-Carbopol complex, like that of ion-exchange resins, involves ionic bonding of the amine macrolide to the high molecular weight polyacrylic acid, such as Carbopol 934 P, thereby removing the drug from the solution phase in an ion-free suspension.<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED) <br><br>
After ingestion, endogenous cations displace the drug from the polymer complex in the gastrointestinal tract to achieve bioavailability.<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED) <br><br>
Carbopol is advantageous over conventional ion-exchange resins in this application. It readily swells, allowing rapid cation exchange. Another advantage is that it dissolves in neutral buffers.<br>
[0008]	Presuming the technique disclosed in Lu et al. would be useful in<br>
the complexation and taste-masking of fexofenadine hydrochloride, it was employed, and surprisingly it was found that the bitterness remained the same. It was presumed that this was due to the incomplete reaction between fexofenadine salt and Carbomer due to the non-availability of a free amino group in the hydrochloride salt.<br>
[0009]	United States Patent No. 4,101,651 to Kobayashi, et al. discusses a<br>
process for granulation of a bitter drug, midecamycin, with a large amount of ethyl cellulose and volatile organic solvents.<br>
[0010]	United States Patent No. 4,916,161 to Patell, et al. discloses a<br>
process for wet granulating a mixture of ibuprofen and HPMCP with an aqueous composition in which the HPMCP is at least partly soluble to affect an improvement in the taste of ibuprofen. HPMCP provides an enteric effect, releasing the drug in the intestines.<br>
[0011]	United States Patent No. 5,188,839 to Pearmain, et al. discloses a<br>
taste-masked chewable tablet of cimetidine containing a copolymer of dimethyl<br>
ethyl methacrylate and neutral methacrylic acid ester as a granulating and binding agent, again involving the use of organic solvents.<br>
[0012]	PCT International Publication No. WO 00/76479 discloses a taste-<br>
masked composition comprising a bitter tasting drug with a combination of two enteric polymers, a methacryclic acid copolymer and a phthalate polymer, in an organic solvent and recovering the composition from the solution thereof.<br>
[0013]	United States Patent No. 4,865,851 to James, et al. discloses a lipid-<br>
based microencapsulation for taste-masking of cefuroxime axetil in particulate form coated with an integral coating of lipid or a mixture of lipids. It requires a highly sophisticated hot-melt granulation technique and may have an adverse effect on heat-sensitive molecules and on drug release.<br>
[0014]	PCT International Pubhcation No. WO 2000009639 describes the<br>
formation of microspheres, which are then coated in a fluidized bed coater with a non-aqueous solution of certain polymers such as ethylcellulose and hy droxypropylcellulose.<br>
[0015]	United States Patent No. 6,027,746 to Lech, et. al. describes a<br>
chewable soft gelatin-encapsulated pharmaceutical adsorbate containing the drug absorbed onto the flakes of Mg trisilicate or SiO2, which are then dispersed in a solid or liquid fill material containing flavorings, sweeteners, emulsifiers and the like.<br>
[0016]	The  methods for taste  masking the bitter salt of a basic drug<br>
disclosed in the prior art were found to be quite complicated, involving the use of sophisticated equipment or organic solvents. Some of them affect the release of the   drug,   while   in  others   the   taste-masked   drug  particles   are   coated   or<br>
microencapsulated or are in the form of microspheres, which, if compressed to form tablets, may have their coating damaged and thus may give a bitter taste. Therefore, a need existed for a simple, aqueous method of taste-masking fexofenadine hydrochloride and other similar basic drugs and their pharmaceutical salts (whose free amino group has been reacted with an acid) so as to produce a taste-masked complex of the drug directly in granular form having a good compressibihty, thus making it suitable for all types of tablets, capsules, dry syrups and liquid dosage forms. Also a need existed to avoid the use of organic solvents for safety purposes. Further, there was the need to get good dissolution and bioavailabihty of the drug and to use a very simple, environmentally friendly and cost-effective technique, avoiding sophisticated equipment and time-consuming processes. The use of a minimum amount of polymer was also desired.<br>

A mixture of these ingredients with a tasteless, granular, directly compressible fexofenadine-carbomer complex may also be compressed to form a dispersible or mouth-dissolving or orally-disintegrating or chewable tablet.<br>
[0023]	In accordance with yet another embodiment, there is provided a<br>
process for preparing a tasteless complex of a basic drug by removing an acidic salt of the basic drug employing an alkali, reacting the basic drug with an acidic<br>

sodium hydroxide, stirring the composition sufficiently, thus changing the nature of the drug dispersion, adding slowly carbomer in the form of an aqueous gel while stirring in an amount such that the drug:polymer concentration ratio ranges from 1:0.5 to 1:0.6, enabling thickening of the dispersion of drug upon gradual addition of carbomer gel until complete complexation takes place; enabhng separation of two phases, one containing the tasteless complex of the basic drug, fexofenadine, and carbomer, and the other containing water. In one preferred embodiment, the solid phase is separated by centrifugation and filtration and dried at 40-45°C until a moisture content of 2-5% is achieved. The tasteless, directly compressible and granular complex of fexofenadine thus obtained is forced through suitable meshes to get a desired particle size for use in dispersible, chewable, mouth-dissolving and/or orally disintegrating tablets. In a preferred embodiment, the stage of complexation is reached and phase separation starts with the addition of carbomer in an amount slightly less than 50% of drug and continues until 60%. Further quantities of carbomer greater than 60% do not make much difference in taste, but instead makes the two phases miscible with each other, making the separation, filtration and drying of the complex all the more difficult. The quantity of sodium hydroxide and the quantity of carbomer used affect the formation of a tasteless, easily separable, filterable, stable, granular, directly compressible and fast-dissolving complex of fexofenadine.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0027]	Fexofenadine, an Hi-histamine antagonist drug, is used in the form<br>
of the   pharmaceutically   acceptable   hydrochloride   salt   (MW-538),   and   its structure is as follows:<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED) <br><br>
 [0028]	As can be seen from the structure, the nitrogen atom present in the<br>
ring is being utihzed by the HCl moiety, leaving nothing for the carboxyl group of polyacrylic acid or carbomer to react with. Hence, when an aqueous dispersion of fexofenadine hydrochloride is mixed with carbomer gel as such, even in a ratio of 1:1, nothing happens, and no taste masking occurs. It was discovered to free only the nitrogen atom of fexofenadine hydrochloride by first adding just a sufficient amount of sodium hydroxide, and then adding carbomer gel.<br>
[0029]	As used herein, the term "carbomer" refers to a polymer of acrylic<br>
acid cross-linked with allyl ethers of sugars, such as sucrose, or polyalcohols, such as penta erythritol. Such carbomers are typically high molecular weight polymers. Preferably the carbomers contain not less than 56% and not more than 68% of carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups. Exemplary carbomers useful in the<br>
invention are commercially available from B.F. Goodrich under the name Carbopol®.<br>
[0030]	The amount of sodium hydroxide is preferably carefuly controlled. If<br>
less sodium hydroxide is used than what is required to free only the nitrogen of fexofenadine, then the complete reaction does not take place between fexofenadine and carbomer and proper taste masking does not occur. On the other hand, if excess sodium hydroxide is used, it makes the carbomer swell and its gel very thick, thus not allowing proper stirring and separation of the tasteless complex of fexofenadine to occur. Further, while the taste of the complex thus formed is not bitter, when kept in the mouth, it has a slimy and sticky feel and does not disintegrate or dissolve quickly. Both when there is insufficient sodium hydroxide and when there is excess sodium hydroxide, the tasteless fexofenadine complex formation does not properly occur and does not occur at all if no sodium hydroxide or other alkali is added. Only if an equimolar quantity of sodium hydroxide or other alkali solution is first added to fexofenadine hydrochloride and then, after its nitrogen group is free, carbomer aqueous gel is added in a drug:polymer ratio ranging from 1:0.5 to 1:0.6, then a complete phase separation results and an easily filterable, stable, granular, directly compressible, tasteless and fast-dissolving fexofenadine complex is formed with the properties described in Table-I.<br>
Process for Preparation of Fexofenadine-Carbomer Complex<br>
[0031]	Fexofenadine hydrochloride was dispersed in an aqueous solution of<br>
sodium hydroxide, the latter in an equimolar quantity. After sufficient stirring, which changed the nature of the drug dispersion, a carbomer was added slowly in the form of an aqueous gel with simultaneous proper stirring. The carbomer was added in a concentration sufficient to provide a drug:polymer ratio ranging<br>
from 1:0.5 to 1:0.6. The dispersion of drug thickened more and more with the gradual addition of carbomer gel until a stage was reached where complete complexation took place and separation of two phases occured, one phase containing the tasteless complex of the basic drug-fexofenadine and a carbomer, and the other one containing water. The solid phase was separated by centrifugation and filtration and dried at 40-45°C until a moisture content of 2-5% was achieved. The tasteless, directly compressible and granular complex of fexofenadine thus obtained was forced through suitable meshes to get a desired particle size for use in dispersible, chewable, mouth dissolving and/or orally disintegrating tablets described further. The stage of complexation is reached and phase separation starts when the amount of carbomer added is shghtly less than 50% of the amount of drug present and continues until the amount of carbomer is about 60% of the amount of drug. Further quantities of carbomer more than 60% of the amount of drug do not make much difference in taste; rather additional carbomer makes the two phases miscible with each other, making the separation, filtration and drying of complex all the more difficult. Thus, both the quantity of sodium hydroxide or other alkah and the quantity of carbomer used are very important for the formation of a tasteless, easily separable, filterable, stable, granular, directly compressible and fast-dissolving complex of fexofenadine.<br>
[0032]	The   complex   of   fexofenadine   with   carbomer   is   better   than<br>
fexofenadine hydrochloride in many respects. In addition to its bitterless taste, it has a pH-independent solubility up to pH 6.0, and then at pH 7.0 the solubility increases and becomes equal or more than that of fexofenadine hydrochloride. The latter has significantly less solubility at pH 1.2 and at pH 5.0 (less than that of the complex) and high solubihty at pH 3.0 &amp; 4.0, making its absorption in the gastrointestinal tract pH-dependent. This is not the case with the fexofenadine-carbomer complex, which has almost the same solubility at all pH levels from 1.2<br>
to 6.0, ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 mg/ml as shown in Table-I. Even the rate of dissolution of an orally disintegrating, dispersible and mouth-dissolving tablet made from the above complex at pH 1.2 is much higher than that of a conventional film coated tablet of fexofenadine hydrochloride as shown in Figs. 1(a), 1(b) &amp; 1(c). At pH 6.8, all are equivalent from 15 minutes onwards as shown in Figs. 2(a), 2(b) &amp; 2(c). The reason for the better dissolution profile at pH 1.2 may be the quick dissociation of the fexofenadine-carbomer complex at an acidic pH and subsequent solubihty of the fexofenadine base in acid. At pH 6.8, the carbomer dissolves readily, and the drug is released again. This means that the onset of action of the oral dosage form made out of the fexofenadine-carbomer complex will be faster than the tablet of fexofenadine hydrochloride, and more so if it is a dispersible or chewable or orally disintegrating or mouth dissolving tablet, while not compromising with the percentage of drug available to the body. Moreover, in addition to the advantages of a much better taste, the fexofenadine-carbomer complex is obtained directly in granular and directly compressible form after it is separated, dried and passed through suitable meshes. There is no need for further granulation using binders, as is required for fexofenadine hydrochloride film coated tablets.<br>
[0033]	The dispersible or orally disintegrating or mouth-dissolving tablet<br>
of fexofenadine prepared from the above tasteless, granular, directly compressible, stable and fast-dissolving complex has further advantages of ease of administration with or without water, ease of providing accurate and divisible doses and patient compliance. The stability studies carried out with the above pure complex as well as with its dispersible, orally disintegrating and mouth dissolving tablet using different flavors and sweetening agents do not show any significant degradation of the drug at any of the stability conditions with all impurities well within the Umits. Even the physical properties and dissolution profiles are least affected during the shelf life.<br>
Process for Preparation of an Orally Disintegrating/Mouth Dissolving Tablet of Fexofenadine:<br>
[0034]	A    fexofenadine-carbomer    complex    prepared,     isolated     and<br>
characterized as described above was obtained directly in a tasteless, granular, directly compressible, fast-dissolving and stable form, so it was used as such with a desired particle size for the preparation of the above-mentioned tablet. A quantity of the complex equivalent to the desired dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride (30mg/60mg/120mg) was taken (15-40% by weight of composition) and dry mixed with the standard pharmaceutical excipients used for a mouth dissolving/orally disintegrating tablet, e.g., diluents like directly compressible mannitol (30 - 60% by weight of composition); sweetening agent like aspartame; flavoring agents; coloring agents; disintegrating agents like microcrystalhne cellulose (5-20% by weight of tablet); disintegration and dissolution enhancers like citric acid, sodium bicarbonate and crosscarmellose sodium; and lubricants like talcum, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, glyceryl behenate, and glyceryl palmitostearate. The above excipients and the drug were geometrically dry mixed and compressed at a slightly lower compression pressure under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. The tablet thus formed disintegrated within 30-60 seconds in the mouth without any water, giving a pleasant mouth feel and leaving no residue in the oral cavity after the saliva containing the dispersed or dissolved drug and excipients was swallowed. Fast mouth dissolving/oral disintegrating action accompanied by a fast dissolution profile of this tablet at pH 1.2 as compared to a conventional film coated tablet of fexofenadine hydrochloride [Figures 1(c) &amp; 1(a)] (more than 85% dissolving in 30 minutes) showed that it should lead to faster absorption and onset of action. It has the further advantages of patient convenience (no need of water), patient compliance, accurate and divisible doses.<br>
Process for Preparation of a Dispersible Tablet of Fexofenadine:<br>
[0035]	The  tasteless,   granular and  directly compressible  fexofenadine-<br>
carbomer complex of a desired particle size was used in a quantity equivalent to the desired dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride (30mg/60mg/120mg), 15-40% by weight of the composition, and dry mixed geometrically with the standard pharmaceutical excipients used for a dispersible tablet, for example, a diluent and disintegrating agent like directly compressible microcrystalhne cellulose (30-60% by weight of tablet); a sweetening agent like aspartame; flavoring agents; a coloring agent; disintegration enhancers like crosscarmellose sodium; and lubricants like talcum and magnesium stearate. The mixture was compressed like an ordinary tablet. The tablet thus formed dispersed in 30-60 seconds in 10-15ml water at 25°C, which when swallowed gave a pleasant taste and left no residue in the oral cavity. Fast disintegrating action accompanied by a fast dissolution profile of this tablet at pH 1.2 as compared to a conventional film coated tablet of fexofenadine hydrochloride [Fig. 1(b)] (more than 80% dissolving in 30 minutes) showed that it should lead to faster absorption and onset of action. It has the further advantages of patient convenience, patient compliance, and accurate and divisible doses.<br>
Pharmacokinetic studies<br>
[0036]	A  single   dose,   pharmacokinetic  study  of a  fexofenadine   orally<br>
disintegrating uncoated tablet containing fexofenadine-carbomer complex equivalent to 120mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride prepared as described above was carried out in healthy adult male human volunteers under fasting conditions. The orally disintegrating tablet was not swallowed but was allowed to<br>
dissolve/disperse in the mouth during administration of the drug to the volunteers.<br>
[0037]	Plasma samples collected at different time intervals up to 48 hrs.<br>
were assayed for fexofenadine using a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic procedure using a fluorescence detector described in "Determination of Terfenadine and Terfenadine acid metabohte in plasma using solid phase extraction and HPLC with fluorescence detection" J. Chromatogr 1991 (570), p. 139-148.<br>

Example-3 Pharmacokinetic profile<br>
[0040]	The   pharmacokinetic   study   of   a   single   dose   of   an   orally<br>
disintegrating uncoated fexofenadine tablet containing a fexofenadine-carbomer complex equivalent to 120mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride was carried out in healthy adult male human subjects under fasting conditions. The human volunteers were selected from males ranging in age from 18-45 years. They were medically fit persons with a normal weight to height ratio, with no history of allergy to the drug or any infectious disease or any hver, kidney or cardiovascular disorder or alcoholism or drug dependence. They were screened after a complete physical, biochemical and haematological examination. Each subject received a single dose of 120mg equivalent of fexofenadine hydrochloride after overnight fasting. The orally disintegrating tablet was kept in the mouth without water so as to allow it to disperse or dissolve, and the saliva was then swallowed. No food was allowed for 2 hours after administering the drug.<br>
[0041]	A standard diet was provided to the volunteers during the study.<br>
Blood samples were collected prior to dosing (0 hr.) and at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 12.0, 24.0 and 48.0 hrs. after dosing. The collected blood samples were transferred to heparinised collection tubes and centrifuged to be stored at - 20°C till the time of analysis. Plasma samples were analysed using HPLC and a fluorescence detector, the results of which showed the plasma concentration — time curve for fexofenadine hydrochloride as shown in Fig. 3. The pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in Table II.<br>
