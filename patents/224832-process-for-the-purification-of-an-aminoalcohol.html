2-amino-l,3-propanediol of formula (I), known as serinol, is widely used as building-block in the synthesis of non-ionic iodinated X-ray contrast media.<br><br>
Great attention has been paid on its synthetic preparation, since the cost of such products is quite high, while its purification has been considered less interesting.<br>
The main industrial application of this product relies on the synthesis of many non-ionic X-ray contrast media, particularly (S)-N,N'-bis-t2-hydroxy-l-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-5-[(2-hydroxy-l-oxopropyl)amino]-2,4,6-triiodo-l,3-benzenedicarboxamide, known with the international denomination of Iopamidol (The Merck Index, XI Ed., page 799, n'4943").<br>
Physicians and authorities which grant drug market authorizations, require drugs with very low level of impurities in order to limit the number of side-effects experienced by patients.<br>
As far as iodinated contrast agents are concerned, particular care must be paid since the total amount of administered product is much higher than other drugs. As a matter of example, the injected contrast agent dose can reach or exceed 150 g.<br>
The high purity level of the compound of formula (I) is extremely important in order to avoid by-products and assure high purity standards in the final products.<br><br>
In literature there are various purification methods of compound (I) such as vacuum-distillation, which is the most widely used (for instance US 5053545, US 4221740), and a purification process which provides for the use of styrene-divinylbenzene resins, such as XAD-2 (see US-342868).<br>
Beyond serinol, two of its salts are commercially supplied, that's to say hydrochloride and oxalate which show a better stability and handling, compared to the free base. The synthesis and the crystallization of these salts has been already described in some patents (for instance EP 348223, US 5053545). The purity reported by manufacturers is 98%, therefore unsatisfactory.<br>
As already known in literature (F. Uggeri et al. , Journal of Chromatography, 432, 1988) the main organic by-products of compound (I), whose purification is the object of this invention, are: N-methyl-l-amino-2,3-propanediol, ethanolamine, 2,3-diaminopropanol, 1,3-diaminopropanol, glycerine and 2-aminopropanol, but also some inorganic impurities, the structural isomer of compound of formula (I), that's to say 3-amino-l,2-propanediol, known as isoserinol, must be considered.<br>
According to the type of industrial synthesis of the compound of formula (I), percentages of the impurity main components can remarkably differ.<br>
Therefore it is important to have available selective purification processes for said impurities.<br>
This invention refers to a process for the purification of 2-amino-l,3-propanediol to obtain a product characterized by a content of organic impurities lower than 0.1% and inorganic impurities lower than 0.05%<br><br>
comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	formation of a 2-amino-l,3-propanediol salt with an acid, preferably hydrochloric acid or oxalic acid;<br>
b)	crystallization of the salt formed in step a) from an aqueous or, alternatively, hydro-organic mixture with a solvent selected from the group consisting of an alcohol of formula R-OH, wherein R is a (C1-C6) straight or branched alkyl chain, a mono(Ci-C3)-alkylether of the (C3-C7)alkylcellosolve group;<br>
c)	elution of the free base by using ion exchangers to give an aqueous solution of said base;<br>
d)	formation of the solid 2-amino-l,3-propanediol by precipitation or crystallization from alcohols of formula R-OH.<br>
Crystallization of salts formed in step a) can be carried out in an aqueous or hydro-organic.... solution and particularly preferred are the alcohols of formula R-OH selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, 2-butanol and t-butanol and 2-methoxyethanol.<br>
Particularly useful are the crystallization techniques of the already known hydrochloride and neutral oxalate of serinol, which are going to be illustrated in detail, since they can give directly marketable products.<br>
We have also found out that obtaining the free base from these salts according to step c), by using H+ or Na+ form cation exchangers, gives a free base furtherly purified by the chromatographic action carried out by the same resins.<br>
This technique is highly innovative with respect to the chemical methods using an alkaline or alkaline-earth<br><br>
base to free these salts, in particular sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, since the salt conversion to free base is quantitative and no traces of inorganic impurities are detected in the resulting product. The filtration step of the inorganic salt (for instance calcium oxalate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride), which causes product losses due to the troublesome washing of the panel of said salt on the filter, is thus avoided.<br>
The process of this invention is particularly advantageous, on an industrial scale, even for the removal of the colour from the raw solutions and the easy automation of the process by means of a potentiometer, conductimeter and refractometer equipped with flow cells.<br>
The preferred cation exchangers are selected from the group consisting of gel or macroporous polystyrene- based exchangers having sulphonic acid groups. For example: C 20 MB (Duolite), Amberlite® IR 120 (Rhom &amp; Haas), Amberjet® 1200 (Rhom &amp; Haas) or alternatively C 100 E (Purolite) or C 350 MB (Dow). In any case analogous cationic exchangers by different manufacturers can be used.<br>
The compound of formula (I) is recovered through elution with aqueous ammonia, in particular the use of 4.7% aqueous ammonia allows the elimination of inorganic impurities. The exceeding ammonia is easily removed through evaporation before step d).<br>
When necessary the reaction can be monitored through pH and so it is very easy to discard the most impure fractions.<br><br>
Strong anion exchangers can be used to produce a free base from a crude solution containing a mixture of inorganic or organic acid which can be water-insoluble and able to salify serinol, therefore having a different action from that performed by cation exchangers. This method, even though it excludes a chromatographic action on the compound of formula (I), gives a free base in a single step, exploiting the higher basicity of tertiary amines of the anion exchanger compared to serinol.<br>
The preferred anion exchangers are selected from the group consisting of strong anion exchangers such as gel or macroporous polystyrene- based exchangers with diethylammonium or dimethylammonium groups.<br>
(3)<br>
For example: Amberlite^ IRA 420 or other types with analogous features (for instance A 400 Purolite, SA 12 A Diaion, SBR-P Dowex).<br>
Also for this process, control systems, such as potentiometer, conductimeter and refractometer, can be used making the process more easily exploitable and automated.<br>
As already cited the methods of the literature teach vacuum- distillation to give solid serinol, we have found out a simple and effective method to attain the same aim, without submitting the product to a prolonged damaging thermal treatment.<br>
After elution of the free base through ion exchangers, an aqueous solution of the compound of formula (I) is obtained which, after concentration, can cause the crystallization or precipitation of the free base.<br>
If water content is lower than 3% a precipitation<br><br>
occurs, otherwise it is more profitable to operate with a maximum water content of 20% according to the type of solvent used for crystallization.<br>
Particularly preferred are the crystallization solvents selected from the group consisting of ethanol, 2-butanol, n—butanol, t—butanol, isobutanol, pentanol, isopentanol.<br>
The method comprises a precipitation at temperatures ranging from —5°C to 30°C according to the solvent used.<br>
When the impurities are mainly inorganic or the compound of formula (I) is contaminated by a salt of 5— amino—2,4,6—triiodoisophthalic acid, this invention also refers to a process for the purification of 2—amino—1,3— propanediol with same previous characteristics of purity, said process comprising the following steps:<br>
a)' preparation of an aqueous solution of 2—amino—1,3— propanediol and elution of said solution on ion exchangers under the previously described conditions to give an aqueous solution of 2—amino- 1,3-propanediol; b)' precipitation or crystallization of solid 2—amino— 1,3-propanediol from an alcohol of formula R-OH, under the previously described conditions.<br>
When the organic impurities in 2- amino—1,3 propanediol amount to 2% and are the only ones present, the compound (I) can be purified by precipitation or crystallization from an alcohol of formula R-OH, according to the previous conditions.<br><br>
The analytical methods used to evaluate the quality of aminopropanediols is reported in the previously cited publication (F. Uggeri et al. , Journal of Chromatography, 432, 1988).<br>
In order to have a clearer and simpler view of this invention, a list of the salts which can be used for the compound  (I)  is given below, while the methods are illustrated in the examples. 1)  Serinol neutral oxalate<br>
The preparation of neutral salt with oxalic acid is<br>
known; it can be easily crystallized from water by<br>
working  with  solutions  having  a  concentration<br>
ranging from 12.5% to 90% (w/w) in water.<br>
The resulting yields are higher than 80% with a high<br>
purity. In fact, salts with a content of organic<br>
impurities  lower  than 0.3%  and  the  practically<br>
complete  removal  of  inorganic  impurities,  are<br>
obtained.<br>
In addition, the structural isomer isoserinol is<br>
totally removed in a selective way with this method.<br>
The weight ratio between water and the salt ranges<br>
between 1:0.5 and 1:10, according to the desired<br>
purification level.<br>
As already cited, we have found out that the use of<br>
an  organic  solvent  mixed  with  water  during<br>
crystallization can analogously reduce by-products<br>
and  overcomes  the  problem  connected  to  the<br>
troublesome filtration of the salt crystallized from<br>
water.<br>
In particular purifying activity is  higher with<br>
respect  to  known  and  unknown  by-products  with<br><br>
lipophilic characteristics such as secondary and<br>
tertiary  amines  which  can  be  present  and  the<br>
capacity of removing the isomer, isoserinol, is kept<br>
in a complete way or within residual values of 0.1%.<br>
The  organic  solvents used  are  the  alcohols  of<br>
general formula R-OH, above described, as well as<br>
the    particularly   preferred    alcohols    and<br>
monoalkyether glycols.<br>
The water content in the case of the neutral oxalate<br>
of  serinol  in  the  hydro-organic  precipitation<br>
mixtures can range from 0% to 95%.<br>
The weight ratio between the neutral oxalate of<br>
compound (I) and the solvent can range between 1:1<br>
to 1:10 parts by weight.<br>
Serinol hydrochloride<br>
Serinol is easily salified with hydrochloric acid.<br>
The salt is not crystallizable from water due to its<br>
high solubility.<br>
Different  patents  describe  the  preparation  of<br>
serinol  hydrochloride  as  crude  final  product,<br>
therefore the crystallization of such salt is a<br>
remarkable advantage, being the same salt a product<br>
commercially supplied.<br>
Some  patents,  such  as  US  5053545,  illustrate<br>
hydrochloride as synthetic intermediate which is<br>
converted into free base through reaction of the<br>
salt with sodium hydroxide.<br>
Other patents, such as EP 348223, give examples of<br>
crystallization of salts using low molecular weight<br>
alcohols for serinol.<br>
The salt can be obtained through the action of<br><br>
aqueous hydrochloric acid in the final step or, alternatively, when this technique is used for purification, the free base can be dissolved in organic solvents and therefore hydrogen chloride is added up to saturation.<br>
Salt crystallization, according to the method of this invention, is performed through ,hydro-organic mixtures in which water content ranges, for serinol hydrochloride, from 0% to 10% (w/w) while the salt/solvent ratio can range from 1:0.5 to 1:10 (w/w) at a crystallization temperature ranging from -5*C to 15'C.<br>
Preferred organic solvents are ethanol and 2-methoxyethanol.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate the best experimental conditions to carry out the process of this invention. EXAMPLE 1 Purification of serinol neutral oxalate.<br>
