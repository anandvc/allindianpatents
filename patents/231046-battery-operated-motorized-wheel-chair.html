				<td>Description:<br>
The present invention relates to the electrically operated motorized wheelchair by modifying a manually operating wheelchair to a front wheel drive system with chassis fabricated from steel pipe used for the battery housing the main drive motor, reduction gear box.<br>
In our country motorized system sold are imported models and are expensive. Severely disabled of average means can not afford to purchase the same. German, British, American firms were manufacturing a wide variety of joystick controlled electric motor powered wheel chairs excellence; but their very expensive. CERI had demonstrated an electrical wheelchair model operated by voice sensors in additions to joystick. But we do not have any information about availability of the same in markets. This invention of electrically controlled powered wheel chair, operated by a joystick switch, is designed to run on smooth floors and has been fabricated from materials procurable in the country.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The manifold problems of mobility of severely handicapped following catastrophic trauma, disease or cerebral vascular accidents do not find any suitable mobility system to promote his activity usefulness and respect. Most of them usually become burden to the family and society. To give them an independent mobility system, it became necessary to invent this leas expensive design battery operated motorized wheel chair for helping such persons.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The mechanical system consist of the frame work assembly for housing main drive motor, turning motor, Reduction Gear Box and bigger front drive wheels, small rear wheels for turning system, control panel and a battery.<br>
The power system consists of a 12 volt, battery, motor has been connected by a Vee Belt to the Reduction Gear Box through pulleys and from Reduction Gear Box to the main drive wheel with the help of Roller chain and sprocket. This system controls the fro and aft movements of the wheel chair.<br><br>
small motor is used for turning system. Four limit switches controlled by a cam is used to restrict the angle of the turning wheels (Number 9 of Figure 10).<br>
A Control Panel is fixed on the right hand rest. (It can be shifted to the left if required). It has a switch which controls the fro and aft and side to side movement of the wheel chair.<br>
The mobile system consist of the main drive wheels with pneumatic tyre, tube, steel Rims and Spokes. The wheel are mounted on axle separately on two sides. A drum brake system has been incorporated within the Hub of the drive wheels fixed to a rectangular steel plate, with the help of steel axles, in front part of the frame shown in Figure.2 (No.1). the rear wheels are mounted on left and right sides of the rear portion of the frame.<br>
The seating system consists of the seat and back covered by cushions made from high density foam and rexin, capable of supporting a person who works the wheelchair. The hand rests, with cushioned top, are provided on both the sides of the frame. Two separate almminium casted footrest are provided in front of the frame.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
A battery operated motorized wheel chair comprising of a frame, a seat, and a back-rest on the said frame, a hand rest, and also a foot rest, and two wheel assemblies, front ones of the two is a drive wheel assembly linked for electric power for propulsion of the said wheel chair;<br>
the said electric power is derived from electric battery, which is mounted on a battery carrier fabricated on the chassis between two front wheels,<br>
the said electric power is supplied from the above mentioned battery to the main drive motor, the motor is mounted on aforesaid chassis in its right side behind the battery connected to the reduction gear box by means of pulley and V belt;<br>
the inlet and outlet shafts are at right angles to each other, a sprocket is mounted on the outlet shaft which is connected to the left drive wheel by means of a roller chain to the other driven sprocket mounted on the left side wheel hub of the wheel chair;<br>
the turning motor is mounted on the bracket fixed on the said frame, the said turning motor assembly is fitted between the main drive motor and the said seat, a circular cam is mounted on the shaft of the turning mechanism motor and four-limit switches are mounted on steel plate, the said switches are used to restrict the rotation of the turning mechanism motor shaft for the required angle;<br><br>
the lever connecting the said turning mechanism motor shaft to the fork spindle of the right side rear wheel which, in turn, is connected to the fork spindle of the left side rear wheel with the help of steel connecting levers;<br>
ah electrical control component box is fixed on the side of right hand rest having a joy stick switch to control the fro and aft and turning movement of the above mentioned wheel chair in which a knob for speed control, and a lock provided at the rear of the control box;<br>
an electrical relay mounted on a steel plate under the seat and also a small electronic cardex is fixed on a separate steel plate;<br>
a miniature circuit breaker fitted under the seat on left side of the frame of the wheel chair for safety of the motor while over loading.<br>
