District: Sabarakantha<br>
Gujarat, India<br>
The following description particularly describes the nature of the invention and<br>
the manner in which it is to be performed.	<br>
1 8 OCT 2005<br><br>
Field of invention<br>
This   invention   relates   to   a   manually   operated   sprayer   for   use   in   the agriculture/horticulture  and other farms  and  anywhere  else,   specifically this invention relates to a hand operated sprayer apparatus. Background of the invention<br>
The manually operated sprayers are as such known in the prior art. One of the known sprayers as disclosed in the U.S. Patent No. 5,335,853 comprises a pumping assembly which is connected with the bottom portion of the pressure vessel and bottom portion of the tank. The pumping assembly has a dual acting piston reciprocates within a pump cup housing thereby performing the actions of injecting fluids into a pressure vessel as well as forcing fluid through another conduit to agitate the fluid into a pressure vessel as well as forcing fluid through another conduit to agitate the fluid contained in the tank.<br>
An agricultural sprayer disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,798,333 comprises a portable sprayer having pressure vessel mounted within a container and connected to high pressure piston pump to force liquid into the pressure vessel from which it may be discharged for spraying, it is improved combination of a piston and diaphragm pump wherein the piston forces fluid through a cylinder housing into the pressure vessel in combination with a diaphragm assembly which draws fluid in from the tank and injects it back into the tank at high velocity utilizing the same reciprocating action of the piston.<br>
Another agricultural sprayer disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,768,714 comprises a portable sprayer with leak control and agitator and similarly has a single action piston which forces fluid into a pressure vessel by additionally having a diaphragm to inject fluid into the tank at high velocity to agitate said fluid.<br>
A garden sprayer disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,702,419 comprises a diaphragm pump wherein fluid is forced into the pressure vessel utilizing only the action of diaphragm securely held at the bottom of a pump cup. The pump assemblies of the prior art generally utilize diaphragms made of a flexible and resilient material, which provides and adequate seal between the piston and the lower pump assembly. However, the<br><br><br>
diaphragms, after continued use, develop cracks, leaks and various other points, which are susceptible to fluid leakage.<br>
Another sprayer disclosed in EP 1 297896 A2 comprises a double curvature in both horizontal and vertical sense for a correct adaptation to the user's back. The pumping unit mounted on the tank is provided with a cylinder attached on a neck of the corresponding top opening of the tank, while a filter serves as a support for the cylinder and to assemble the intake valve between the tank and the compression chamber. The cylinder includes a piston with an inner independent channel where the suction duct is mounted, placed between the top lid of the piston and a cavity of the lower part of the piston, under which is provided a valve for communication between the compression chamber and the lower end of the suction duct. The tank is provided with pairs of legs that allow assembly on either side of the manually actuated lever.<br>
A sprayer disclosed in US patent no. 5938116 comprises a supply container, a manually<br>
operated piston-pump, a pressure vessel and a valve for controlling fluid, accumulator<br>
accumulate the fluid from the pump and to deliver the fluid to the spray want at<br>
desired pressure.<br>
Disadvantages of the prior art<br>
There are disadvantages associate with the prior art. One of the main disadvantages is<br>
that the conventional sprayers are heavy and are to be hold on the back of the user<br>
and thus causes fatigue to the user.<br>
Another disadvantages is that the conventional sprayers have complicated mechanism<br>
and the maintenance thereof is very costly.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the conventional sprayers as such are very costly and<br>
poor farmers cannot afford it.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that due to the constantly mounting of the sprayer on<br>
the back, some time create a back pain if used for long duration in the big farm, also<br>
only are hand is used to operates the sprayer which causes fatigue ness to the user.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the conventional sprayers are not efficient and a lot<br>
of medicine is wasted.<br><br><br>
Object and advantages of the present invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a manually operated sprayer, which is hanged on both the shoulders interchangeably as and when user feel tiredness.<br>
Another object of the present invention to provide a manually operated sprayer, which is of lightweight and having improved efficiency of operation. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a manual sprayer which is adapted to hanged on both the shoulders ad thus can be operated by both the hands on both the sides and thus reduces the fatigueness.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a "manual sprayer, which reduces the need for reapplication of the drug and thus and minimizes wastage of the liquid to be sprayed.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a manual sprayer wherein require a pressure regulator is not required for constant pressure spray applications. Another object of the present invention to provide a manual sprayer wherein less manual work is required to operate the sprayers. Summary of the invention<br>
According to this invention there is provided a manually operated sprayer comprising of tank (1) adapted to be supported on a base frame (2) and a bet£ (6) secured to said base frame on one side, wherein base frame comprises atleast a pair of vertical supporting arms (19) supporting the tank (1) thereon; opening of said tank (1) being provided with pumping means (3) for sucking liquid from tank, said pumping means (3) is operated by lever (5) which is provided at one side of said base frame, wherein said sprayer having an integrated lever, fulcrum/pivot at one end of lever, reversed L shaped clamp attached with piston pump, a metallic pipe with a wand at one end; and a nozzle at the other end having multiple diffuser arrangement and a nozzle pin with a stopper disposed in the cavity of said nozzle, for dispensing the liquid with, a fountain action, wherein said pumping means comprises a pressure pipe (7) having a delivery pipe (8) disposed therein, washer assembly is secured at the bottom end of the said pressure pipe (7), a conical means having an outlet is secured at the top end of the said delivery pipe (8) to supply the liquid to the spraying means.<br><br><br>
