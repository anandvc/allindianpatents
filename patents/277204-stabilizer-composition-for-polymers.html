stabilizer Composition for Polymers<br>
The invention relates to stabilized thermoplastic polymers, in particular polyolefin films. The stabilizing composition contains a tertiary amine with a molecular weight greater than 400 g/mol, a UV-absorber and/or a sterically hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS). Further aspects of the invention are a process for stabilizing thermoplastic polymers and the use of the above composition for stabilizing thermoplastic polymers.<br>
Tertiary amines, in particular bridged amine compounds, such as diazabicyclooctane (DABCO) and triazadamantane derivatives in combination with sterically hindered amines are disclosed in WO 00/09604 and in WO 98/36023. The tertiary amines described therein are all of low molecular weight, which leads to problems during processing of the polymers due to their volatility and high migration rate.<br>
It has now been found that the incorporation of aliphatic tertiary amines, which need not to be bridged, leads to a strong synergistic effect with UV-absorbers and/or sterically hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS). The synergistic effects are amplified when the polymers are exposed to a sulphur-based pesticide treatment, a common practice in greenhouse applications. Under such conditions the stability of polymers containing tertiary amines and UV-absorbers is particularly good.<br>
The combination of UV-absorbers, tertiary amines and HALS provides in many cases the best stabilization.<br>
Additionally, the photostability of UV-absorbers is increased. In particular hydroxyphenyl triazine UV-absorbers are relatively susceptible to the interaction with pesticides, especially towards sulphur-based pesticides. The use of a small amount of an aliphatic tertiary amine with high molecular weight increases their durability, that is, their persistency in the polymer articles.<br>
This is particularly important for films used as greenhouse covers or for mulching. These structures are usually made of low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), ethylvinylacetate (EVA) or ethylene/butylacrylate (EBA) and contain several additives with a functional effect: antioxidants, such as phenols, phosphates, lactones or hydroxylamines, slip agents and anti-blocking additives, such as erucamide,<br>
 <br>
oleamide or silica, mineral fillers, such as l<aolin ca carbonate bariunn sulphate carbon black hydrotalcite and pigments such as smartlight rl they are typically stabilized with hals or without uv-absorbers.></aolin>
Beside films, raffia, for example made of HOPE, PP, LDPE is frequently used with the same purposes in greenhouse or mulching applications.<br>
The films and raffia are frequently exposed to the chemicals utilized as pesticides, herbicides and soil disinfectants used to protect crops and flowers. Very often, such compounds are based on chlorine, sulphur and metals (Cu, Fe). All these species are able to react with the stabilizers, leading to premature degradation of the film. Sulphur is known to be very effective, both as elemental powder sublimated or sprayed in the greenhouses and as part of active molecules (e.g. Vapam).<br>
Beside the interaction with the stabilizers, sulphur is suspected to interact directly with the polyolefinic matrix, accelerating its degradation.<br>
Finally, sulphur and sulphur-based compounds can interact with hydroxyphenil-triazines, leading not only to premature degradation but also to the loss of the UV-filter effect, used to improve productivity of the crops.<br>
Some types of crops are in fact degraded by the UV-components of solar radiation, which must be filtered off to obtain high quality and yields. Additionally, some micro-organisms, e.g. Botrytis Cinerea, can proliferate under specific UV-irradiation. These pests are harmful for the cultivation of some varieties of roses [R. Reuven et al.. Development of photoselective PE films for control of foliar pathogens in greenhouse-grown crops, Plasticulture No. 102, pg. 7 (1994); Y. Eheshel et al., "The use of UV absorbing plastic sheets to protect crops against insects and spread of virus diseases", CIPA Congress 1997].<br>
PP or PE tapes used as artificial grass are another application that combines a high exposure to UV-light (with the subsequent need for stabilization) with contamination of sulphur, used as vulcanizer for the rubber that represents the bottom of the artificial grass. The stability of such systems can be further affected by the presence of pigments that can act as pro-degradants.<br>
 <br>
One aspect of the invention is a stabilized polymer composition comprising<br>
a)	a thermoplastic polymer;<br>
b)	a tertiary amine with a molecular weight greater than 400 g/mol, which is not a 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine derivative;<br>
c1) a UV-absorber selected from the group consisting of the hydroxyphenyl benzotriazoles,<br>
hydroxyphenyl triazines, hydroxy benzophenones and oxalic anilides; or<br>
c2) a light stabilizer from the class of sterically hindered amines; or<br>
c3) a mixture of the UV-absorber,  component c1) and the sterically hindered amine,<br>
component c2).<br>
In particular one aspect of the invention is a stabilized polymer composition comprising<br>
a)	a non halogen containing thermoplastic polymer;<br>
b)	an aliphatic tertiary amine with a molecular weight greater than 400 g/mol, which is not a 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine derivative;<br>
c1) a UV-absorber selected from the group consisting of the hydroxyphenyl benzotriazoles,<br>
hydroxyphenyl triazines, hydroxy benzophenones and oxalic anilides; or<br>
c2) a light stabilizer from the class of sterically hindered amines; or<br>
c3) a mixture of the UV-absorber,  component c1) and the sterically hindered amine,<br>
component c2).<br>
Preferably the tertiary amine has a molecular weight of more than 500 g/mol, in particular of more than 700 g/mol.<br>
In some cases it may be sufficient that the composition comprises a tertiary amine and a UV-absorber, as defined above. However, when maximum stabilization is required, the composition comprises a tertiary amine, a UV-absorber and a sterically hindered amine.<br>
Examples of thermoplastic polymers are given below.<br>

Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene, polyisobutylene, po-lybut-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyvinylcyclohexane, polyisoprene or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked), for example high density polyethylene (HOPE), high density and high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-HMW), high density and ultrahigh<br>

Polyolefins, i.e. the polymers of monoolefins exemplified in the preceding paragraph, prefe¬rably polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by different, and especially by the following, methods:<br>
a)	radical polymerisation (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature).<br>
b)	catalytic polymerisation using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than one<br>
metal of groups IVb, Vb, VIb or VIII of the Periodic Table. These metals usually have<br>
one or more than one ligand, typically oxides, halides, alcoholates, esters, ethers,<br>
amines, alkyls, alkenyls and/or aryls that may be either n- or a-coordinated. These<br>
metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on<br>
activated magnesium chloride, titanium(lll) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These<br>
catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the polymerisation medium. The catalysts<br>
can be used by themselves in the polymerisation or further activators may be used,<br>
typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal<br>
alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups la, lla and/or Ilia of the Periodic<br>
Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine<br>
or silyl ether groups. These catalyst systems are usually termed Phillips, Standard<br>

B Application Examples Example B1<br>
LDPE (Riblene FF29 from Polimeri Europe) blown extruded films are prepared and exposed in an Atlas Weather O Meter (WOM dry) and in a Q-UV weathering device. To simulate the environmental exposure to sulphur, each film was previously exposed to elemental sulphur vapour.<br>
Before measuring the UVA degradation the films were washed with water in order to remove the sulphur. The degradation of UV absorber was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy and calculated from the transmittance in the region 280-380 nm. The polymer matrix degradation was followed by carbonyl increment using FT-IR spectroscopy.<br>
The results are presented in Tables 1-4.<br>
