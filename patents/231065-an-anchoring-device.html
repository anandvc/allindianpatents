				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an anchoring device.<br>
This is a divisional out of Indian patent application No. 1195/DEL/92 filed December 15, 1992.<br>
The applicant's previous inventions, rail clips commonly referred to respectively as a "P-R" clip (disclosed in GB-861,473) and an "e"-clip (disclosed -in GB-1,510,224), have both been successful for many years, providing low-cost rail fastenings that have been widely used in many countries around the world. These clips may be installed into shoulders alongside the rail either manually, using a sledgehammer to drive the clip into the shoulder, or automatically by a clip driving machine. Whilst automatic clip installation is obviously more desirable, being quicker and less labour-intensive, it can be a fairly complex process, requiring accurate positioning of the clip relative to the shoulder in order to achieve an adequate rail fastening.<br>
Parent Application No. 1195/DEL/92 relates to a railway rail fastening clip suitable for holding down a railway rail, the clip being formed of a rod of material bent so as to be substantially M-shaped in plan, at least one of the legs of the M being provided with first locating means provided on a clip anchoring device so as to locate the said clip at a desired position with respect to the said clip anchoring device when installed therein, wherein at least one abutment surface forms one of the first and second locating means and at least one cooperating projection forms the other of the first and second locating means, both the abutment surface and one face of the cooperating projection being acutely inclined in one sense to the longitudinal axis of the leg of the M having said first locating means thereon such that the said one face of the said cooperating projection abuts against the said abutment surface so as to locate the clip whereby driving of the clip in either of two directions parallel to the said axis forces said projection out of contact with said abutment surface.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an anchoring device, for retaining a railway rail fastening clip which is formed of a rod of material bent so as to be approximately M-shaped in plan and is provided on at least one leg of the M with first locating means, which device is provided with second locating means for cooperating with said first locating means so as to locate the said clip at a desired position with respect to the anchoring device when installed therein, wherein at least one abutment surface forms one of said first and second locating means and at least one cooperating projection forms the other of the first and second locating means, both the abutment surface and one face of the cooperating projection being acutely inclined in one sense to the longitudinal axis of the leg of the M having said first locating means thereon such that the said one face of the said cooperating projection abuts against the said abutment surface so as to locate the clip, but such that driving of the clip in either of two directions parallel to the said axis forces said projection out of contact with said abutment surface.<br>
Preferably, an anchoring device embodying the present invention comprises a base member and a pair of upright clip-retaining members connected to said base member and extending substantially upwardly with respect thereto when the device is in use, said clip-retaining members being spaced apart so as to define an opening there between for receiving the interconnected inner legs of such an M-shaped clip and being formed with respective guiding passageways there through for receiving respectively the outer legs of the M-shaped clip. Desirably, in such an anchoring device the said guiding passageways are formed on respective outer faces of the said clip-retaining members. Each of the said guiding passageways is preferably in the form of a channel formed in a side wall of the associated clip-retaining member. The longitudinal axes of the said guiding passageways are desirably substantially parallel to the main surface of the said rail foundation when the device is in use.<br>
Alternatively, the roof of each passageway has a portion which slopes downwardly, proceeding along said passageway in a direction away from the opening thereof into which an outer leg of a clip is inserted when the device is in use, for abutting the outer leg of the clip when the clip is being driven into the device so as to drive that leg downwardly with respect to said inner legs.<br>
Preferably, in an anchoring device embodying the present invention, the upper region of the opening between said clip-retaining members is formed for receiving part of the clip and a lower region of said opening is formed for receiving a rail foundation lifting tool, the upper and lower regions of the opening being so shaped or arranged that the lifting tool cannot pass from the said lower region of the opening into said upper region thereof.<br>
In an anchoring device embodying the present invention, the or each abutment surface is preferably formed by one inclined face of a recess, another face of the said recess being acutely inclined in the opposite sense to said longitudinal axis.<br>
Preferably, the said second locating means comprise either two or three such recesses, spaced apart from one another in a direction parallel to the said longitudinal axis.<br>
Alternatively, said second locating means comprise a single projection. In such a combination, the said second locating means are provided either on a wall of each passageway in said anchoring device, or alternatively on an inner wall of said opening in said anchoring device.<br>
Desirably, at least one of the said abutment surfaces is formed by a corner portion of the said anchoring device. Preferably, such a combination has at least two abutment surfaces, one of which is formed by one face of a notch which is steeply-inclined with respect to the said<br>
longitudinal axis, the other face of the notch being less steeply-inclined with respect to the said longitudinal axis than said one face. The said second locating means desirably comprise two or three such abutment surfaces, spaced from one another in a direction parallel to the said longitudinal axis.<br>
Desirably, the roof of one or each of the passageways of said device is provided with a downwardly-directed projection for engaging with a recess which is formed in a part of the or each outer leg of said clip which is uppermost when the clip is in use. Such projection is desirably located such that the clip is held in a position in which the clip bears on an adjacent rail, when the device is in use. Preferably in this case the roof of one or each of the passageways is provided with another downwardly-directed projection for engaging with said recess, which projection is desirably located such that the clip is held in a position in which the clip does not bear on an adjacent rail, when the clip engages that projection. When two projections are provided they are desirably located at either end of one or each of the passageways.<br>
The installation of railway track can therefore be facilitated by using rail clips, anchoring devices, and railway rail-fastening assemblies embodying the present invention, since prior to laying of the sleepers clips can installed into the anchoring devices in such a way as to held in those devices in a pre-assembly position which allows threading of rails between the anchoring devices. The clips can then be driven into their working positions on the rail, either automatically or manually (both processes being facilitated by pre-insertion of the clips).<br>

Figs. 9a, 9b and 9c show views for use in explaining respective steps of a method embodying the fifth aspect of the present invention;<br>
Figures la, Ib and Ic show a railway rail fastening assembly comprising a railway rail fastening clip 1, a clip shoulder or anchoring device 2 embodying the present invention by which the clip 1 is being held in a<br>
position where it is bearing down on a railway rail 3 adjacent to the anchoring device 2, a "toe" insulator 4 carried by the clip 1 which is thereby electrically isolated from the rail 3, and a "post" insulator 5 located between the rail 3 and the anchoring device 2 for electrically isolating the device 2 from the rail 3. The rail 3 is supported on a rail foundation 6, there being a resilient rail pad 7 provided between the bottom of the rail 3 and the foundation 6 as in conventional assemblies. For clarity, Figure Ic shows only the clip and anchoring device.<br>
The assembly shown in Figures la to Ic can employ a clip which differs in shape from the one shown.<br>
The anchoring device 2 shown in Figures la to Ic will now be described with reference to Figures 2a, 2b and 2c which show plan, side and front elevational views of the anchoring device respectively.<br>
The anchoring device 2 has a pair of clip-retaining members 21, which extend upwardly when the device is in use. The clip-retaining members<br>
21	have respective first main faces 2la which oppose one another are<br>
mutually-parallel and are joined together by a connecting base member<br>
22	of the device which extends between a lower corner of one of the clip<br>
retaining members 21 and a corresponding lower corner of the other<br>
clip-retaining members 21 such that the said first main faces 2 la extend<br>
alongside one another. The first main faces 2la of the clip-retaining<br>
members  21   define  therebetween  an  opening  23  in  the  device  for<br>
receiving the third, fourth and fifth portions 13, 14 and 15 of a clip 1. In<br>
a second main face 2 Ib of each of the clip retaining members 21 there is<br>
provided a first recess 21c forming a passageway for receiving one of the<br>
first and seventh portions 11 and 17 of the clip 1. The first recess 21c<br>
adjoins a second recess 2Id provided in the second main face 21b below<br>
one end of the first recess 21c, such that when looking directly towards<br>
the  second main face 21b the floor of the passageway appears to have a<br>
step in it. At respective upper corners of the first main faces 2la of the<br>
clip retaining members 21,  directly above the lower corners thereof<br>
joined together by the said base member 22, the clip retaining members 21 are provided with inwardly-extending projections 21e which are such that they lie directly over part of the third and fifth portions 13 and 15 of the clip respectively when the clip is installed in the device and the fourth portion 14 thereof is resting on the rail. These projections 21e serve to prevent the inner legs of the clip being forced upwards to an unacceptable extent by tilting of the rail, and so are useful where the clip (as in Figure la) does not have legs which overhang the rail.<br>
The top of each clip-retaining member 21 is such that when viewed from the front and from the side it has in profile the shape of an irregular triangle. The face joining that end of the clip-retaining member 21 which is at the front of the anchoring device 2 to the uppermost point of the device is inclined to the horizontal by 32°, whereas the face joining the opposite end of the clip-retaining member 21 to the uppermost point is inclined to the horizontal by 20°. Respective faces joining the first and second main faces of the clip retaining member 21 to the uppermost point are inclined to the horizontal by 19° and 45° respectively.<br>
By way of example only, dimensions of various parts of the anchoring device 2 described with reference to Figures 2a to 2c will now be given.<br>
The anchoring device is 100mm wide between the second main faces 21b of the clip-retaining members 21, which are each 70mm long and 22.5mm wide and define an opening there between of 55mm. The first recess 21c therein is 13.5mm wide in the horizontal direction and 16mm wide in the vertical direction, the second recess 2Id being 20mm long, 13.5mm wide in the horizontal direction and 10mm in the vertical direction. The overall height of the anchoring device is 66mm, the height of the base member 22 being 15mm, a lowermost surface of each of the inwardly-extending projections 21e being 34mm therefrom, and the uppermost point of the second main face 21b of the clip-retaining member 21 being 57mm high. The separation between the projections<br>
21e is 32mm, and the distance between the uppermost points of the anchoring device 2 is 76mm. The uppermost point of the device 2 lies 20mm from the front thereof, as measured horizontally.<br>
The clip shown in Figures la to Ic has pairs of detents 8 on each outer leg. This feature will now be described in more detail with reference to Figures 3a to 3d, which show respective side, plan, partially enlarged and rear views of a railway rail fastening clip 100 which is M-shaped in plan, and Figures 4a, 4b and 4c which show respective enlarged views of parts of a clip and anchoring device assembly employing such detents 8.<br>
The clip 100 is formed from a rod of-resilient material bent so as to have, proceeding from one end A of the rod to the other end B, a substantially straight first portion 101, a bent second portion 102, a substantially straight third portion 103, a bent fourth portion 104, a substantially straight fifth portion 105, a bent sixth portion 106, and a substantially straight portion 107. When viewed from above, the longitudinal axes of the first, third, fifth and seventh portions appear to be mutually-parallel. The longitudinal axes of the second and sixth portions 102 and 106 lie in respective planes which are inclined with respect to one another and also with respect to a plane containing the longitudinal axes of the first and seventh portions. The third and fifth portions thereby lie in a further plane which is above the plane containing the first and seventh portions when the clip is in use. The clip is shown in combination with an anchoring device 200 comprising clip-retaining members 201 which extend upwardly when the device is in use and having passageways therein for receiving the first and seventh portions of the clip 100 respectively. The opening 209 in each device 200 into which the third 103, fourth 104 and fifth 105 portions of the clip 100 are inserted when the clip is in use is wedge-shaped in cross-section. This enables the rail foundation to which the anchoring device 200 is attached to be lifted indirectly using a lifting tool having a lifting member shaped so as to fit<br>
the lower region of the opening in the device. On the inwardly-facing surface of each outer leg of the clip 100 there is formed a pair of detents 8a and 8b, spaced from one another in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axes of the first and seventh portions, which cooperate with a corresponding rounded projection provided on an outwardly-facing vertical wall of each passageway.<br>
When the projection 9 provided in each passageway in the anchoring device is engaged with the detent 8a which is furthest from the associated free end of the clip the clip is retained in a "switched-in" position in which it bears on the rail. However, it is possible for the clip to be driven out of that position, through application of force to the clip in the direction away from the rail, such that the projection 9 on the anchoring device comes out of the detent 8a. The projection 9 can then engage with the other detent 8b so as to retain the clip in a "switched-out" position in which it rests on the anchoring device. Similarly, the clip may be driven in the opposite direction so as to move from its position on the anchoring device to its position on the rail. This enables the clip to be installed and held in the anchoring device, in its "switched-out" position, before a rail is laid on the rail foundation (and possibly even before the anchoring device itself is incorporated in the rail foundation), which greatly facilitates the driving of clips by automatic machinery when the rail is in place. Furthermore, the clip need not be removed completely from the anchoring device when for any reason it is desired to release the rail from the clip.<br>
Figure 4a shows the detents 8a and 8b and projection 9 in greater detail. Figure 4b shows an alternative arrangement in which the clip is provided with a projection 8 and an anchoring device is provided with detents 9a and 9b. This arrangement operates in exactly the same way as the arrangement of Figure 4a. Figure 4c shows an arrangement in which the clip has a kink formed in it so as to provide a projection 9c and the anchoring device has a steep-sided notch 8d in a face thereof, the<br>
projection 9c being able to engage either with the notch 8d or a corner of the anchoring device 8c.<br>
It should be noted that the means of locating the clip with respect to the anchoring device can take other forms and that the detent/notch or projection can be provided on either the outer legs or the inner legs of an M-shaped clip. Furthermore, as apparent from the earlier description of Figure la, the locating means can be applied to all forms of M-shaped clip, including that of Figure la and not only the form of clip shown in Figures 3a to 3d. A further example of such a clip is described below with reference to Figs. 6a to 6e. Finally, it is conceivable that more than two detents/notches could be provided on each outer or inner leg of the clip, or on the anchoring device, so as to allow for the retention of the clip in more than two positions with respect to the anchoring device. For example, as explained below in more detail with reference to Figures 9a to 9c, it may be desirable to have three locating positions for the clip, one in which the clip bears down on the rail, one in which the clip bears on a post insulator to permit adjustment of the rail, and one in which the clip does not rest on the post insulator so as to allow replacement thereof.<br>
Fig. 5 shows another rail-fastening assembly which comprises a resilient railway rail-fastening clip 1 having a toe portion 14' which bears against a flange of a railway rail 3 supported by a rail foundation 6, the rail foundation 6 being cushioned from the rail 3 by means of a resilient rail pad 7 located between the base of the rail and the rail foundation 6. The rail clip I1 is held in place by an anchoring device or shoulder 250, the shoulder 250 having a pair of passageways 253 (only one of which is shown in Fig. 5) in which respective limbs 11', 17' (only limb 17' being shown in Fig. 5) of the clip are located. The toe portion 14' of the clip I1 carries an insulator 4' covering the lowermost surface of the toe portion 14', so that the toe portion 141 of the clip 1' bears on the rail flange through the insulator 41, which thereby insulates the clip I1 from the rail<br>
3. Located between the rail 3 and the shoulder 250 is a "side post" insulator 570, for electrically isolating the shoulder 250 from the rail 3. The components in the assembly will now be described in more detail with reference to the remaining drawings.<br>
As shown in Figs. 6a, 6b and 6c, the clip 1' shown in Fig. 5 is substantially M-shaped in plan. It is made by bending a rod of resilient material, which is, in this case, circular in cross-section (for example a steel rod 15mm in diameter), so as to have, proceeding from one end A of the rod to the other end B, a straight first portion 11', a second portion 12' bent through 180°, a curved third portion 13', a fourth portion 14' which is bent through 180°, a curved fifth portion 15', a sixth portion 16' which is bent through 180° and a straight seventh portion 17'. The first and seventh portions 11' and 171 of the clip constitute the outer legs of the M, the third and fifth portions 131 and 151 constitute the inner legs of the M, the second and sixth portions 12' and 16' join respective inner legs to the outer legs, and the fourth portion 14' of the clip joins together the inner legs. When viewed in plan, as in Fig. 6A, the fourth portion 14' of the clip extends beyond the free ends A and B of the first and seventh portions 11' and 171.<br>
The outer legs of the clip, i.e. the first and seventh portions 11' and 17' thereof, are each provided with detents 18 on their upper surface adjacent to the respective free ends A and B of the clip. The end B of one of the outer legs of the clip (which in this embodiment is identical to the other outer leg) is shown in more detail in Figs. 6d and 6e.<br>
In this clip, the detents 18 are each shaped so as to have two faces 18a, 18b which are inclined in opposite respective directions with reference to the longitudinal axes of the first and seventh portions 11' and 17' and another face 18c forming the floor of the detent 18 which joins together the inclined faces 18a, 18b and is itself substantially parallel to the longitudinal axes of the first and seventh portions 11' and 17'. The<br><br>
inclined faces 18a, 18b are inclined at an angle of 30° with respect to the longitudinal axes of the first and seventh portions 11' and 171. The floor 18C of the detent serves to space apart the inclined faces 18a, 18b of the detent 18, but in an alternative embodiment this floor 18c may be omitted so that there is no space between the lowermost edges of the inclined faces 18a, 18b of the detent 18.<br>
The detent 18 is preferably on the uppermost surface of the first and seventh portions II1 and 171 of the clip as shown, rather than on a lateral face thereof, so that when the clip 1' is installed in an anchoring device 250 the force on the outer legs of the clip caused by the engagement of the anchoring device 250 with the detents 18 is in substantially the same direction as the stress acting on the second and sixth portions 12' and 16' of the clip 1' owing to deflection of the outer legs.<br>
The clip shown in Figs. 6a to 6e is used, as shown in Fig. 5, with an anchoring device as shown in Figs. 7a to 7c, although this anchoring device may be modified in some respects, for example as shown in Figs. 8a to 8c.<br>
The anchoring devices 250 of Figs. 7a to 7c and 8a to 8c comprise a base member 251, which extends substantially horizontally when the device is in use, and a pair of clip retaining members 252 which are connected at one end thereof to either end of the base member 251 so as to extend substantially perpendicularly thereto both vertically and horizontally. A channel formed in the outwardly-facing wall of each clip-retaining member 252 provides a passageway 253 for receiving the outer legs of the clip of Figs. 6a to 6e. The clip-retaining members 252 are spaced apart by the base member 251 so as to define an opening 254 therebetween for receiving the inner legs of the clip. Overhanging the opening 254 from the top of each clip-retaining member 252 are inwardly-extending projections 255, which projections 255 serve to limit upward movement of the inner legs of the clip which may occur due to rail tilt when the clip is in use. Each passageway 253 has an opening<br>
256 at the end of the clip retaining member 252 which is furthest from the base member 251, but is closed by a wall 257 at the other end of the clip-retaining member 252 so as to provide means by which the insulator 570 may be located on the anchoring device 250, as will be explained later in more detail. For this purpose also, the roof of the passageway adjacent to the wall 257 is removed.<br>
When the anchoring device 250 is in use, the floor of the passageway 253 is substantially horizontal. The passageway 253 has only one side face, constituted by a wall 252a of the clip-retaining member 252, formed so as to lie between the outer and inner legs of the clip 1' when in use, the other side of the passageway being open. The roof of the passageway 253 is formed so as to have a sloping part 253a which is inclined with respect to the horizontal when the device is in use such that the passageway is taller at the part of that sloping part 253a which is closer to the opening 256 than it is at the other end of the part 253a, the roof of the passageway 253 being formed at either end of the sloping part 253a in such a way as to provide projections 253b and 253c for cooperating with the detent 18 formed in the outer leg of each clip 1' for locating the clip 1' at a particular location with respect to the anchoring device 250.<br>
The first projection 253b which is formed at the opening 256 of the passageway 253 presents to the opening 253 a first face 253b', which is fairly shallowly inclined to the horizontal in a direction such that the height of the passageway decreases proceeding towards the wall 257. The projection 253b then has a second face 253b", which is more steeply inclined with respect to the horizontal, but in the opposite sense, than the first face 253b' such that the height of the passageway increases. The second projection 253c which is formed closest to the wall 257 has a first face 253c' forming the sloping part 253a and a second face 253c" which is inclined in the opposite sense with respect to the horizontal by an angle which is greater than the angle of inclination of the sloping part 253a, but is smaller than the angle of inclination of the second face<br>
253b" of the first projection 253b. Extending from each wall 252a of the clip-retaining members 252 in a region above the passageways 253 is a part 258 such that between the passageway 253 and the part 258 there is defined a recess 259 into which a tool, for installing a clip into or removing a clip from the device, or for lifting a sleeper to which a pair of anchoring devices 250 have been secured may be inserted. The roof of the recess 259 may be sloped along one edge as shown. The wall 252a of each clip-retaining member 252 may be rounded or sloped along one edge as shown so as to reduce the amount of material required to make the anchoring device 250.<br>
The floor of the passageway 253 is preferably extended beyond the opening 256 so as to provide a part 253d against which the lower surface of the outer legs of the clip may rest when the clip is about to be installed in the device 250. The base member 251, which provides a support for the fourth portion 141 of the clip I1 when it is not bearing on the rail, is in this embodiment intended (when in use) to receive a side post insulator 570, a step 25la being provided in the face of the base member 251 which is closest to the rail 3 when the device 250 is in use for receiving a horizontally-extending part of the insulator 570. It should be noted, however, that this step 25la would not be required if the anchoring device 250 were to be used with a conventional insulator for electrically isolating the device from the rail.<br>
Further savings in the material needed to make the device 250 may be achieved by omitting the overhanging projections 255, thereby enabling the overall height of an anchoring device 250' to be reduced, as shown in Figs. 8a to 8c. The parts 258 have also been omitted from the device of Figs. 8a to 8c, although the upper part of this device 2501 could be modified so as to provide a recess for receiving installation or lifting tools.<br>
In one embodiment of the anchoring device shown in Figs. 7a to 7c, for use with a clip as described with reference to Figs. 6a to 6e, the overall<br>
height of the anchoring device is 60mm and its overall width is 101mm. The clip-retaining members 252 define an opening between them which is 57mm wide, the walls 252a being 9mm wide. The lowermost surface of each overhanging part 255 is 46mm above that part of the anchoring device which will be level with surface of the rail foundation 6 when the device is in use, the separation between the overhanging parts 255 being 32mm. The part 253d extends beyond the opening 256 of the passageway 253 a distance 11mm, the length of the passageway from the inner wall 257 to the opening 256 being 77mm. The wall 257 is 8mm thick as measured in a direction parallel to the length of the passageway 253 and is 21mm high. The thickness of the floor of the passageway is 3mm and the height of the passageway at the opening is 22mm. The height of the passageway then decreases at an angle of about 13° to a height of 20mm before increasing again at an angle of about 45° to a. height of 24mm. The sloping part 253a of the passageway roof is inclined at an angle of about 18° and at is lowermost point is 18.5mm above the floor of the passageway 253. The second face 253c" of the second projection 253c is inclined at an angle of 30° to a height of 24mm, the lowermost point of the second projection 253c being 26mm from the outer face of the wall 257. The lowermost point of the first projection 253b is 68mm from the outer face of the wall 257. The recess 259 above the passageway 253 has an upper surface which is inclined at an angle of about 15° starting at a height of 44mm above the lowermost point of the anchoring device and increasing to 51mm, the floor of the recess being 32mm above the lowermost point of the anchoring device. The step 25la formed in the base member 251 is formed at a height of 15mm above the lowermost point of the anchoring device and is of depth 8mm.<br>
Installation of the clip 1' into an anchoring device 250 as shown in Fig. 5 will now be explained with reference to Figs. 9a to 9c (the toe insulator 4' that would normally be carried by the clip I1 being omitted for clarity in these Figures).<br>
Fig. 9a shows the clip in an initial position, as it is when it is about to be driven into the device 250, with the fourth portion of the clip 1' resting (via a toe insulator 41, not shown) on the base member 251 of the anchoring device 250 and the outer legs of the clip I1 just inside the passageways 253 of the anchoring device 250 such that part of the lower surface of the outer legs rests on the portion 253d of the anchoring device 250, the face 18a of the detent 18 which is closest to the free end of the outer leg is in contact with the second face 253b" of the projection 253b, and the upper tapered surface 19a of the outer leg is partly in contact with the sloping part 253a of the roof of the passageway 253. In this position the clip is only partially deflected, for example only 2mm out of a total deflection of 12mm.<br>
When the clip is driven into an intermediate position, as shown in Fig. 9b, in which the face of the detent 18b is brought into contact with the first face 253b' of the projection 253b, the outer legs are deflected downwardly a little more, bringing the second and sixth portions 12' and 16' of the clip 1' upwardly.<br>
In this position, the fourth portion of the clip rests above part of the side post insulator 570, thereby preventing upward movement of that insulator. If the insulator is shaped such that it holds down the rail pad 7, then in this position the clip also serves to retain the rail pad through the insulator. Thus, it is envisaged that the clip, insulator, and preferably also the pad, could be installed on a sleeper provided with an anchoring device 250 in the sleeper factory before being taken to site.<br>
Fig. 9c shows the clip as it appears when it has been driven from the intermediate position shown in Fig. 9b into a final position where the fourth portion 14' (normally carrying a toe insulator 41) of the clip I1 bears on the rail 3. As the clip is driven horizontally, the sloping roof of the passageway in contact with the upper tapered, surface 19a of the outer leg urges the outer leg downwardly, thereby deflecting the clip. In<br>
the final position of the clip, the detent 18 in the clip 1' is engaged by the second projection 253c of the anchoring device 250 and the free ends of the outer legs overlie the locating feet 576 of the side post insulator 570 so that upward movement of the insulator 570 is further restricted. The clip is fully deflected in this position, the fourth portion of the clip lying in a plane which is substantially parallel to the plane containing the first and seventh portions of the clip and the second and sixth portions 12' and 16' of the clip being at their highest point.<br>
When the clip is in its initial position, the insulator is free to move upwardly, so, if replacement of the insulator 570 is required, this may be achieved by driving the clip I1 back into its initial position, without the need to remove the clip 1' completely from the anchoring device 250.<br><br><br><br>
