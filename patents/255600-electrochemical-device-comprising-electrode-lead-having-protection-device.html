Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an<br>
electrochemical device comprising an electrode lead<br>
having a protection device for interrupting electric<br>
current when the temperature of an electrochemical<br>
device increases.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, there is an increasing interest in<br>
energy storage technology. Batteries have been widely<br>
used as energy sources in portable phones, camcorders,<br>
notebook computers, PCs and electric cars, resulting in<br>
intensive research and development into them. In this<br>
regard, electrochemical devices are subjects of great<br>
interest. Particularly, development of rechargeable<br>
secondary batteries is the focus of attention. Recently,<br>
research and development into novel electrode and battery<br>
that can improve capacity density and specific energy<br>
have been made intensively in the field of secondary<br>
batteries.<br>
Among currently used secondary batteries, lithium<br>
secondary batteries appearing in early 1990's have drive<br>
voltage and energy density higher than those of<br>
conventional batteries using aqueous electrolytes (such<br>
as Ni-MH batteries, NI-Cd batteries, H2SO4-Pb batteries,<br>
etc). For these reasons, lithium secondary batteries are<br>
advantageously used. However, such lithium secondary<br>
batteries have disadvantages in that organic<br>
electrolytes used therein may cause safety-related<br><br>
problems resulting in ignition and explosion of the<br>
batteries and that processes for manufacturing such<br>
batteries are complicated. More recently, lithium ion<br>
polymer batteries developed for the purpose of<br>
overcoming the shortcomings of lithium ion batteries<br>
have been thought of as' a candidate leading the next<br>
generation batteries. However, such lithium polymer<br>
batteries developed up to date have a relatively low<br>
capacity compared to lithium ion batteries and provide<br>
insufficient discharge capacity at low temperature.<br>
Therefore, there is an imminent need for batteries<br>
capable of solving the above-mentioned problems.<br>
Lithium ion batteries have an operation mechanism<br>
different from that of nickel-metal hydride batteries or<br>
nickel-cadmium batteries. Each of LiCoO2 and graphite<br>
used in a lithium ion battery as cathode active material<br>
and anode active material, respectively, has a crystal<br>
structure in which an empty space is present. During<br>
charge/discharge cycles, Li ions repeatedly intercalate<br>
into and deintercalate out of the empty space and thus<br>
move inside of a battery.<br>
A battery is manufactured in its discharged state.<br>
During a charge cycle, lithium contained in the LiCoO2<br>
crystals deintercalates out of the crystals, moves to an<br>
anode and thus intercalates into the crystal structure<br>
of graphite. On the contrary, during a discharge cycle,<br>
lithium contained in graphite deintercalates out of the<br>
crystal structure of graphite and then intercalates into<br>
crystals present in a cathode. Such repeated comings and<br>
goings of Li ions between a cathode and anode are<br>
referred to as the so-called rocking chair concept,<br>
which forms the operation mechanism of a lithium ion<br><br>
battery.<br>
Evaluation of and security in safety of batteries<br>
are very important. It should be considered in the first<br>
place that users have to be protected from being damaged<br>
due to malfunctioning of batteries. To satisfy this,<br>
safety of batteries is strictly restricted in terms of<br>
ignition and combustion in batteries by safety<br>
standards. Overcharge of a battery is the most imminent<br>
problem to be solved.<br>
All batteries are dangerous when overcharged and<br>
lithium ion batteries cannot be an exception. When a<br>
battery is overcharged, lithium ions move continuously<br>
from a cathode to an anode present in a state wherein<br>
lithium completely occupies the empty space in the<br>
crystal structure of graphite, as viewed from the<br>
geometrical point, so that lithium ions grow on the<br>
surface of anode, resulting' in formation of dendrite<br>
having a resinous structure. Such dendrite may result in<br>
explosion and firing of a battery when the battery is<br>
abused. Morphology of the dendrite depends on the kind<br>
of lithium salt contained in an electrolyte.<br>
The most dangerous phenomenon resulting from<br>
overcharge of a battery is "high-temperature<br>
overcharge", which is the worst case occurring in<br>
lithium ' ion batteries. When a lithium ion battery is<br>
overcharged to a voltage of 4.2V or more, electrolyte<br>
starts to be decomposed and tends to have a high<br>
possibility for ignition as the battery temperature<br>
increases to reach the flash point. However, there is no<br>
occurrence of ignition in the closed spaced of a battery<br>
because oxygen is not supplied thereto. LiCoO2 used as<br>
cathode active material forms a layered structure of "0-<br><br>
Co-O" in which a Co layer locates between oxygen atom<br>
layers, such structure forming a sandwich-like shape.<br>
Additionally, LiCoO2 may form a crystal structure of "O-<br>
Co-O-Li-O-Co-O" in which a Li layer locates between two<br>
sandwich-like structures. The latter structure is not<br>
stable.<br>
At high temperature, LiCoO2 has a great tendency to<br>
be converted into a stable spinel structure (die-like<br>
structure) . The spinel has a molecular formula of LiCo2O4<br>
and thus has a small amount of oxygen per unit cell<br>
compared to a layered structure. Therefore, in this<br>
case, remaining oxygen moves to an electrolyte so that<br>
oxygen may be supplied to the electrolyte reaching its<br>
flash point, thereby causing explosion of a battery.<br>
However, because a battery itself cannot prevent the<br>
heat emission as mentioned above, many attempts have<br>
been made, for example, to mount a protection circuit on<br>
a battery or to apply heat obstruction by using a<br>
separator.<br>
Particularly, it is known that protection devices<br>
such as a PTC (positive temperature coefficient) device<br>
or thermal fuse are efficient when they are disposed in<br>
the vicinity of an electrode as heat emitting source<br>
(for example, at the central portion or lateral surface<br>
of a battery) by means of resistance welding, in order<br>
to promptly detect an increase in battery temperature<br>
followed by abnormal operation of the battery.<br>
Additionally, such protection devices are frequently<br>
disposed at the lateral side portion of a battery so as<br>
to increase energy efficiency per volume.<br>
As the most recent approach, Japanese Laid-Open<br>
Patent No. 2003-45492 discloses a battery comprising a<br><br>
heat-sensitive protection device (PTC) mounted on an electrode<br>
lead having relatively high heat conductivity, wherein the<br>
corresponding protection device is disposed at the sealing<br>
region. However, according to the battery, because the PTC<br>
device is mounted on the exterior of a battery and the battery<br>
casing has low heat conductivity, it is not possible to respond<br>
sensitively to variations in temperature inside of the battery<br>
in practice. Further, because the battery is manufactured<br>
through a complicated process, it shows poor industrial<br>
applicability in practice.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of<br>
the above-mentioned problems. It is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide an electrochemical device, which comprises<br>
a protection device activated immediately in response to an<br>
increase in temperature of the electrochemical device to<br>
interrupt electric current so that the electrochemical device<br>
can be protected while minimizing a drop in energy density per<br>
volume of electrochemical device.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an<br>
electrochemical device pack having one or more of the above<br>
electrochemical devices.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided an electrochemical device comprising an electrode<br>
assembly having a cathode, an anode and an electrolyte, and a<br>
casing surrounding the electrode assembly, which comprises a<br>
protection device to which either or both of a cathode lead for<br>
connecting a cathode with an outer terminal and an anode lead<br>
for connecting an anode with an outer terminal are connected<br>
electrically, wherein the protection device is disposed in an<br>
inner space of the casing and the said either or both of the<br><br>
cathode lead and the anode lead equipped with the protection<br>
device are folded at both sides of the protection device so that<br>
the largest surface of the protection device is layered on a<br>
lateral surface of the casing where said either or both of the<br>
cathode lead and the anode lead are present.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there<br>
is provided an electrochemical device comprising an electrode<br>
assembly having a cathode, an anode and an electrolyte, the<br>
electrode assembly being enclosed with a casing having an inner<br>
surface and an outer surface, wherein the electrochemical device<br>
comprises a protection device to which either or both of a<br>
cathode lead for connecting a cathode with an outer terminal and<br>
an anode lead for connecting an anode with an outer terminal are<br>
connected electrically, the protection device is disposed at a<br>
sealing region between inner surfaces of the casing, and the<br>
sealing region of the casing is folded so that the sealing<br>
region having the protection device is layered on a lateral<br>
surface of the casing.<br>
The protection device that may be disposed in the inner<br>
space of a casing or at the sealing region of a casing according<br>
to the present invention includes a PTC device, thermal fuse,<br>
bimetal device, Zener diode, etc.<br>
According to the present invention, the protection device<br>
is electrically connected to an electrode lead in series or in<br>
parallel, preferably in series. The connection between the<br>
cathode lead or anode lead and the protection device can be made<br>
by welding.<br><br>
Preferably, the protection device that may be used<br>
in the present invention is a protection device that<br>
protects an electrochemical device from an increase in<br>
temperature of the electrochemical device.<br>
The PTC device used in the present invention as<br>
protection device, which is electrically connected to an<br>
electrode lead in series, can interrupt electric current<br>
by the occurrence of a rapid increase in resistance,<br>
when the temperature of a battery increases abnormally<br>
(for example, in the case of an over-current or external<br>
short circuit, particularly in the case of an<br>
overcharge), so that the temperature cannot increase any<br>
more. Therefore, the PTC device can improve the battery<br>
safety.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
protection device is disposed inside of the casing of<br>
electrochemical device, and the largest surface of the<br>
protection device is layered on the lateral surface in<br>
the casing where the electrode lead is present. For<br>
example, in the case of a stacked electrode assembly<br>
having four stacked surfaces, the protection device is<br>
disposed in the space between the stacked surface on<br>
which the electrode lead is present and the casing, and<br>
the surface of the protection device is opposite to the<br>
stacked surface on which the lead is present. In this<br>
case, the protection device can respond promptly to an<br>
increase in temperature of the electrochemical device<br>
with no occurrence of a drop in energy density of the<br>
electrochemical device.<br>
When the protection device is disposed in the<br>
inner space of the casing as described above, it is<br>
preferable to fold the lead in such a manner that the<br><br>
largest surface of the protection device can be layered<br>
on the lateral surface of the battery. For example, it<br>
is preferable to fold the cathode lead or anode lead<br>
electrically connected to the protection device in such<br>
a manner that the protection device can be disposed in<br>
parallel with the space between the stacked surface of<br>
the stacked electrode assembly and the casing (and that<br>
the surface of the protection device can be opposite to<br>
the stacked surface).<br>
Particularly, it is preferable to perform taping<br>
of both surfaces of the lead by using an insulation film<br>
in order to prevent interconnection in the lead to be<br>
folded (see, FIG. 6a) . Additionally, the lead or the<br>
protection device is taped with an insulation tape in<br>
order to prevent electric short circuit. Particular<br>
examples of the insulation film include an imide<br>
insulation film.<br>
Further, the portion having the protection device<br>
is preferably coated with a polymer in order to prevent<br>
the breakage of a protection device (for example, a PTC<br>
sheet) caused by infiltration of an electrolyte into the<br>
protection device. Non-limiting examples of the polymer<br>
include polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane, epoxy<br>
resin, silicone, etc.<br>
In another embodiment, the protection device is<br>
disposed at the sealing region between inner surfaces of<br>
a casing. In this case, it is preferable to minimize the<br>
temperature and pressure upon sealing so that the<br>
breakage of the protection device itself can be<br>
prevented.<br>
Meanwhile, it is more efficient in terms of safety<br>
that the protection device has a contact surface with<br><br>
the electrode assembly as large as possible so that the<br>
heat generated from the inside of the electrode assembly<br>
can be detected with high sensitivity. Therefore, it is<br>
preferable that the protection device extends by a<br>
predetermined length along the direction away from the<br>
longitudinal direction of the lead connected by the<br>
protection device, preferably along the perpendicular<br>
direction (see, FIGs. 2c, 2d, 2e and 2f) . By doing so,<br>
the protection device can extend on the lateral surface<br>
of the casing, while minimizing a drop in energy density<br>
per volume caused by such extended protection sheet. If<br>
the protection device is disposed at the sealing region<br>
of the casing and the sealing region of the casing is<br>
folded to be layered on the lateral surface of the<br>
casing, the extended portion of the protection device is<br>
also layered on the lateral surface of the casing.<br>
Particularly, when the protection device is present in<br>
the vicinity of an electrode tab lead, the heat<br>
generated from an electrochemical device during an<br>
overcharge state is conducted mainly through the<br>
electrode lead. As a result, heat conductivity to the<br>
protection device may decrease. Therefore, according to<br>
the present invention, the portion of the protection<br>
device exposed by extending from a linear lead,<br>
preferably along the perpendicular direction, can<br>
improve the sensitivity to an increase in temperature of<br>
the electrochemical device as well as heat conductivity<br>
(see, FIGs. 3, 1 and 11). In other words, the heat<br>
generated from the electrochemical device under an<br>
overcharge state can be conducted not only through the<br>
electrode lead but also directly to the exposed portion<br>
of the protection device, thereby increasing operational<br><br>
efficiency of the protection device.<br>
As shown in FIG, 13, when an electrode assembly<br>
having a stacked structure is provided and each lead is<br>
connected to an electrode tab in the form of "V" (see,<br>
drawing number 6 in FIG. 1) , a vacancy is created<br>
between the stacked surface of the electrode assembly<br>
and the casing (see, drawing number 7 in FIG. 1).<br>
When the protection device is disposed in the<br>
space between a cathode tab and anode tab in a stacked<br>
electrode assembly including an electrode tab having a<br>
V-form (see, FIG. 7a) as described above, there is no<br>
drop in capacity of the battery. Additionally, it is<br>
possible to maximize the contact area between the<br>
protection device and the battery.<br>
Although the present invention can be generally<br>
applied to lithium ion batteries, it can also be applied<br>
to all electrochemical devices including nickel-metal<br>
hydride batteries, nickel cadmium batteries, etc.<br>
Additionally, the present invention will have<br>
applicability to future batteries that can substitute<br>
for lithium ion batteries.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention,<br>
characterized by comprising a protection device disposed<br>
inside of a casing, can be applied to pouch-type,<br>
cylindrical and prismatic batteries with no particular<br>
limitation in shape of the battery casing.<br>
Meanwhile, another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, characterized by comprising a protection<br>
device disposed at the sealing region of a casing, is<br>
suitable for pouch-type batteries. Contrary to prismatic<br>
or cylindrical batteries, pouch-type batteries generally<br>
using an aluminum pouch as casing permit the protection<br><br>
device to be disposed at the sealing region in practice.<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of pouch-type<br>
batteries, particularly lithium ion polymer secondary<br>
batteries, to which the present invention is applied,<br>
will be explained in more detail with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, an electrode assembly 1 is<br>
enclosed and sealed by a casing 2 made of an insulation<br>
material and includes a cathode, anode, separator<br>
interposed between the cathode and anode and a gel<br>
polymer. A cathode lead 3 and anode lead 4 are connected<br>
to a cathode and anode, respectively. The cathode lead<br>
and anode lead are heat sealed into a sealing region 5<br>
disposed in the circumference of the casing.<br>
FIG. 2 shows several embodiments of two leads<br>
connected to each other by a protection device (for<br>
example, PTC device) according to the present invention.<br>
The PTC device is formed by crosslinking between<br>
carbon black as conductive agent and polyethylene as<br>

Hereinafter, the present invention will be<br>
exemplified by a lithium secondary battery.<br>

material, an anode capable of lithium<br>
intercalation/deintercalation, a non-aqueous electrolyte<br>

bonded to a cathode current collector such as foil<br>
formed of aluminum, nickel or combinations thereof to<br>
provide the cathode.<br>
The anode active material forming the anode of a<br>
lithium secondary battery includes lithium metal,<br>
lithium alloys, or lithium intercalation materials such<br>

bonded to an anode current collector such as foil formed<br>
of copper, gold, nickel, copper alloys or combinations<br>
thereof to provide the anode.<br>
The separator that may be used has a micro-porous<br>
structure and includes multilayer films formed of<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene or combinations thereof, or<br>
polymer films for solid polymer electrolytes or gel<br>
polymer electrolytes such as polyvinylidene fluoride,<br>
polyethylene oxide, polyacrylonitrile or polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride-hexafluoropropylene copolymer.<br>
The electrolyte that may be used in the present<br>
invention includes a salt represented by the formula of<br>
A+B-, wherein A+ represents an alkali metal cation<br>
selected from the group consisting of Li+, Na+, K+ and<br>
combinations thereof, and B" represents an anion selected<br>
from the group consisting of PF6-, BF4-, Cl-, Br-, I-,<br>
C1O4- ASF6-, CH3CO2-, CF3SO3-, N(CF3SO2)2-, C(CF2SO2)3- and<br>
combinations thereof, the salt being dissolved or<br>
dissociated in an organic solvent selected from the<br>
group consisting of propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene<br>
carbonate (EC) , diethyl carbonate (DEC), dimethyl<br>

(NMP), ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC), gamma-butyrolactone<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
Additionally, there is no particular limitation in<br>
shape of the electrochemical device to which the present<br>
invention is applied. The electrochemical device may be<br>
a thin-type or large-size device, etc. Further, the<br>
present invention may be applied to a stacked device<br>
having a plurality of electrochemical devices, hard<br>
pack-type device having a pack casing in which an<br>
electrochemical device is contained and a soft pack-type<br>
device including an electrochemical device exposed to<br>
the exterior.<br><br>

Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention. It is to<br>
be understood that the following examples are<br>
illustrative only and the present invention is not<br>
limited thereto.<br>
[Examples]<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
A PTC device (Model No. NSP-L500) available from<br>
LG Cable Co. was mounted on a lithium ion polymer<br>
secondary battery (Trade Name: ICP323456, 600 mAh)<br>
available from LG Chem. , Ltd. The PTC device was heat<br>
sealed with a cathode lead to provide the form as shown<br>
in FIG. 2b. Then, the battery was enclosed with a pouch-<br>
type casing in such a manner that the PTC portion is<br>
present on the exterior of the casing as shown in FIG.<br>
4.<br>
Example 1<br>
The same lithium ion polymer secondary battery<br>
available from LG Chem., Ltd. and the same PTC device<br>
available from LG Cable Co. as Comparative Example 1<br>
were used. In this Example, the PTC device was heat<br><br>
sealed with a cathode lead to provide the form as shown<br>
in FIG. 2b. Then, the battery was enclosed with a pouch-<br>
type casing in such a manner that the PTC portion is<br>
present at the inner sealing region of the casing as<br>
shown in FIG. 5.<br>
Example 2<br>
The same lithium ion polymer secondary battery<br>
available from LG Chem., Ltd. and the same PTC device<br>
available from LG Cable Co. . as Comparative Example 1<br>
were used. Similarly, the PTC device was heat sealed<br>
with a cathode lead to provide the form as shown in FIG.<br>
2b. Then, the battery was enclosed with a pouch-type<br>
casing in such a manner that the PTC portion is present<br>
inside of the casing as shown in FIG. 6a. Particularly,<br>
in order to minimize the loss of energy density, the<br>
lead was folded so that the PTC sheet is disposed<br>
between the stacked surface (surface having the lead) of<br>
the electrode assembly and the casing. Additionally, the<br>
lead was insulated by using an imide film so as to<br>
prevent interconnection between leads (see, FIG. 6a) .<br>
Example 3<br>
The same lithium ion polymer secondary battery<br>
available from LG Chem., Ltd. and the same PTC device<br>
available from LG Cable Co. as Comparative Example 1<br>
were used. Similarly, the PTC device was heat, sealed<br>
with a cathode lead to provide the form as shown in FIG.<br>
2d. Then, the battery was enclosed with a pouch-type<br>
casing in such a manner that the extended portion of the<br>
PTC sheet is present between the cathode tab and anode<br>
tab. Additionally, the PTC sheet was coated with a<br>
polymer so as to prevent breakage of the PTC layer<br>
caused by infiltration of electrolyte.<br><br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
The same battery as Comparative Example 1 was<br>
provided, the battery using a conventional lead with no<br>
protection device.<br><evaluation><br>
Each of the lithium ion polymer secondary<br>
batteries obtained from the above Examples 1, 2 and 3<br>
and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 was overcharged<br>
(20V/3C) and variations in temperature and voltage were<br>
shown in FIG. 8 (Comparative Example 1), FIG. 9 (Example<br>
1), FIG. 10 (Example 2), FIG. 11 (Example 3) and FIG. 12<br>
(Comparative Example 2). As can be seen from FIGs. 8 and<br>
12, both of the battery using no PTC device and the<br>
battery including a PTC device disposed on the exterior<br>
of the battery casing exploded, while the batteries<br>
including a PTC layer disposed inside of the batteries<br>
were safe as shown in FIGs. 9, 10 and 11. Referring to<br>
FIGs. 8 and 12, each battery ignited and the battery<br>
temperature increased to 200°C or higher. However, as can<br>
be seen from FIGs. 9, 10 and 11, the highest temperature<br>
was 105°C, 45°C and 35°C in each case (based on the<br>
surface temperature of an electrode assembly).<br>
Additionally, it can be seen that the battery according<br>
to Example 3, which includes a sheet-like PTC protection<br>
device extending from the lead so as to provide a large<br>
contact area with the electrode assembly, was safer than<br>
the battery according to Example 2, which has a<br>
relatively small contact area.<br>
As can be seen from the above results obtained<br>
from the overcharge test, disposing a PTC device inside<br>
of an electrochemical device provides a significant<br>
improvement in terms of safety, compared to disposing a<br><br>
PTC device on the exterior of the electrochemical<br>
device. It is thought that this results from the<br>
temperature dependency of a PTC device, which is the<br>
principle of operation in PTC devices, the temperature<br>
dependency being more sensitive inside of an<br>
electrochemical device. Therefore, PTC leads having the<br>
form of FIG. 5, 6 or 7 are the most preferred<br>
embodiments in terms of safety and performance.<br>
The PTC lead as described above provided excellent<br>
results after various safety tests including nail<br>
penetration test, high-temperature oven test, etc., for<br>
a pack comprising a plurality of electrochemical devices<br>
as well as in the above overcharge test.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, the<br>
electrochemical device according to the present<br>
invention includes a protection device disposed at the<br>
sealing region of a casing or inside of a casing,<br>
wherein the largest surface of the protection device is<br>
layered on the lateral surface of the casing. Therefore,<br>
it is possible to improve the sensitivity of the<br>
protection device to an increase in temperature of the<br>
battery, reaction degree and heat conductivity, while<br>
minimizing a drop in energy density per volume caused by<br>
' the protection device. Ultimately, according to the<br>
present invention, it is possible to improve the safety<br>
of an electrochemical device.<br><br>
