				<td>A CATALYST COMPOSITION AND A PROCESS FOR THE OLIGOMERIZATION OF ETHYLENE<br>
<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst composition comprising at least one transition metal bisphenolate compound and at least one co catalyst.<br>
<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the oligomerization of ethylene in the presence of the catalyst composition according to the invention.<br>
<br>
Linear Alpha Olefins (LAO) are olefins with a chemical formula CxH2x, distinguished from other mono-olefins with a similar molecular formula by linearity of the hydrocarbon chain and the position of the double bond at the primary or alpha position. Linear alpha olefins are a range of industrially important alpha-olefins, including 1- butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene, 1-tetradecene, 1-hexadecene, 1- octadecene and higher blends of C20-C24, C24-C30, and C20-C30 ranges.<br>
<br>
There is a wide range of applications for linear alpha olefins. The olefins with lower carbon numbers for example 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene are overwhelmingly used as co monomers in production of polyethylene. Another significant use of C4-C8 linear alpha olefins is for production of linear aldehyde The predominant application of 1- decene is in making polyalphaolefin synthetic lubricant base stock and to make, in a blend with higher linear alpha olefins, surfactants. Ci0-C14 linear alpha olefins are used in making surfactants for aqueous detergent formulations. These carbon numbers may be reacted with benzene to make linear alkyl benzene which is further sulfonated to linear alkyl benzene sulfonate. Although some Ci4 alpha olefin is sold into aqueous detergent applications, Ci4 has other applications such as being converted into chloroparaffins and as on-land drilling fluid base stock, Ci6 - Ci8 linear olefins find their primary application as the hydrophobic part in oil-soluble surfactants and as lubricating fluids themselves. Ci6 - Ci8 alpha or internal olefins are used as synthetic drilling fluid base for high value, primarily off-shore synthetic drilling fluids and in paper sizing. C20 - C30 linear alpha olefins are used in a number of reactive and non-reactive applications, <br>
<br>
including as feedstock to make heavy linear alkyl benzene and low molecular weight polymers which are used to enhance properties of waxes.<br>
<br>
Linear alpha-olefms are usually prepared by the catalytic oligomerization of ethylene in the presence of a Ziegler-Natta-type catalyst. Important requirements of the ethylene oligomerization are the desired selectivity and the desired product distribution. The applied catalyst and the process conditions are essential features to obtain these desired characteristics.<br>
<br>
Various types of catalysts are known to be applied in the process for the oligomerization of ethylene.<br>
<br>
An example of a known catalyst system includes a binary catalyst system comprising an ethyl aluminum chloride combined with titanium tetrachloride, optionally with further admixture of a third component, such as for example an electron donor, to enhance the selectivity. Another known catalyst system includes a binary catalyst comprising an ethyl aluminum chloride combined with a zirconium containing compound. However, these catalyst compositions are not quite satisfactory in respect of activity and selectivity.<br>
<br>
The use of zirconium-containing catalysts is disclosed in for example US 4,486,615; 4,442,309; 4,434,313; 4,434,312; 4,410,750; 4,409,409; 4,396,788; 4,377,720 and 4,361,714. The oligomerization of ethylene using these catalysts is performed in hydrocarbon solvents at a temperature between 1000C and 15O0C and at elevated pressures between 0.4 MPa and 0.8 MPa. The main disadvantages of said catalysts are the poor solubility of zirconium tetrachloride in hydrocarbon solvents, the severe conditions for operation of the catalyst and its relatively low selectivity. During the oligomerization of ethylene, significant amounts of undesirable wax and polymer are formed under the influence of these catalysts.<br>
<br>
US 4,783,573 discloses the use of a ternary catalyst system comprising a zirconium halide, an organoaluminum compound and a Lewis base, and adding a catalyst deactivating agent to the resulting reaction mixture. The disadvantage of this process is <br>
<br>
the relatively low selectivity of C6-C10 fraction (30-56%) in combination with the high yield of C20+ fraction.<br>
<br>
US 5,345,023 discloses a process for oligomerization of ethylene to light alpha-olefins, mainly 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene and 1-decene using a catalyst obtained by mixing a zirconium compound with an organic compound chosen from the class of acetals and ketals and with a chorine or bromine-containing compound of aluminum hydrocarbyl. This system exhibits low selectivity (33-57 wt%) for C6-C1O fraction.<br>
<br>
WO1980/00224 discloses a catalyst comprising a zirconium carboxylate and an organ aluminum compound. The main disadvantages of that catalyst system are the low selectivity of C6-C10 fraction and the formation of undesired by-products such as oligomers of C20+ wax and polyethylene. The formation of heavy oligomers which are waxy solids and only partly soluble in the product mix of linear alpha-olefins causes reactor plugging and consequently frequent reactor shut downs for cleaning.<br>
<br>
Ethylene may be oligomerized into linear alpha-olefins efficiently using metal-complex catalysts on the basis of titanium and zirconium compounds. However, the known catalysts are either non-technological or not highly-selective for the production of the most valuable and desirable narrow fractions of alpha-olefins, for example the C4-C10 fraction and the C6-Ci0 fraction.<br>
<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a catalyst composition having an improved activity and an improved selectivity for the preparation of linear low molecular weight alpha olefins preferably with an improved C6-Ci0 fraction yield.<br>
<br>
The present invention is characterised in that the transition metal bisphenolate is a zirconium (IV) bisphenolate represented by formula (I): <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
X is selected from halogen, ß-diketonate, -OR and -OOCR wherein R may be H, alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl or halogen m = 1 or 2 and n = 0 or 2.<br>
<br>

<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention R1 is selected from -CH2-, -CH(CH3)- and (-CH2-)2.<br>
<br>
According to a more preferred embodiment of the invention R1 is -CH2-.<br>
<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention R2 = H, (Ci-C20) alkyl, (C6-C20) aryl , (C3-Ci0) cycloalkyl or halogen.<br>
<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment R = H, (Ci-C20) alkyl, (C3-C10) cycloalkyl or halogen.<br>
<br>
According to a more preferred embodiment R2 = H, CH3 or C(CH3)3.<br>
<br>
The preferred halogen in R, R2 and X is chlorine.<br>
<br>
Additional substituents other than R and R2 may be also provided at the aromatic rings of the bisphenolate system, i.e. at other carbon atoms of the aromatic rings. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention X is selected from chlorine, ß- diketonate, -OR and -OOCR wherein R = H, (Ci-C20) alkyl, (C6-C20) aryl, (C3-Ci0) cycloalkyl or halogen.<br>
<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the zirconium bisphenolate is 2,2'-bissubstituted zirconium(IV) cresolate and/or zirconium(IV) methylene bisphenolate.<br>
<br>
A preferred co catalyst is an organo aluminium compound.<br>
<br>
Preferably, the organo aluminium compound is represented by the formula R3PA1Y3-P, wherein <br>
<br>
R3 = (C1-C20) alkyl Y = halogen and 1 
<br>
More preferably Y = chlorine. More preferably 1.5 
<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention the organo aluminium compound is diethyl aluminium chloride and/or ethyl aluminium sesquichloride.<br>
<br>
Preferably the molar ratio of co catalyst to transition metal ranges between about 10:1 to about 100:1. More preferably the molar ratio ranges between about 15:1 to about 70:1 and even more preferably the molar ratio ranges between about 20:1 to about 50:1.<br>
<br>
The catalyst composition may comprise at least one electron donor compound. Examples of suitable electron donor compounds include ethyl acetate, ethyl acetoacetate, ethyl benzoate, anisol, thiophene, tetrahydrofuran, cyclopentylamine and 2-pyrrolidone. Generally the molar ratio electron donor compound: Zr compound ranges between 1: 0.1 and 1: 3.<br>
<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the co catalyst is added to the reactor in a first step to obtain the desired high activity and selectivity of the catalyst composition.<br>

<br>
Preferably the ethylene pressure ranges between about 1 MPa to about 5 MPa. More preferably the ethylene pressure ranges between about 2 MPa to about 4 MPa. <br>
<br>
A very important advantage of the catalyst composition according to the present invention is that the use of this catalyst results in a selectively oligomerization of ethylene to linear alpha-olefms having a high yield of C6 to Ci0 fraction.<br>
<br>
It is a further advantage of the present invention that the formation of high molecular weight polymer is minimized or even eliminated at all.<br>
<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that the catalyst composition and the conditions under which the ethylene oligomerization process is carried out result in a<br>
<br>
Poisson type distribution of the oligomerization product distribution whereas a Schultz-<br>
<br>
Flory type distribution is characteristic for the known zirconium-containing catalytic systems. The advantage of the Poisson type distribution is that this distribution provides an increased yield of C6 to C10 and other middle a - olefin fractions, m general the existing Zr-containing catalysts are characterized by Schultz-Flory type distribution which results in a wide range of ethylene oligomerization products with less C6 to C10 fraction yield.<br>
<br>
Preferably, the catalyst composition according to the present invention is prepared by dissolving the components in aromatic, halide aromatic and/or aliphatic solvents. For preparing the catalyst composition, there is no particular limitation on the order of addition of the catalyst components required. Preferably the catalyst system used in the production of linear alpha-olefms is dissolved in an inert organic solvent.<br>
<br>
Examples of suitable organic solvents include aromatic hydrocarbon solvents which may be unsubstituted or substituted with halogens for example toluene, benzene, xylene, monochlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, chlorotoluene, aliphatic paraffin hydrocarbons for example pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, alicyclic hydrocarbon compounds for example cyclohexane, decahydronaphthalene, and halogenated alkanes for example dichloroethane and dichlorobutane.<br>
<br>
It is further preferred to exclude oxygen, moisture and aggressive impurities from the reactants and the solvent. <br>
<br>
An important aspect of the invention is the mode of reaction of ethylene with the catalyst composition dissolved in the inert solvent.<br>
<br>
The catalyst components may be contacted at a temperature in the range between about -30°C to 50°C and may be kept in the absence of ethylene up to 24 hours prior to addition into the oligomerization reactor.<br>
<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the catalyst components are directly contacted in the oligomerization reactor with ethylene to obtain the high activity.<br>
<br>
When the oligomerization reaction is conducted at pressures of ethylene about  IMPa the oligomerization reaction may be conducted both at constant and at changeable pressures.<br>
<br>
The main reason behind deactivation of the oligomerization centers is the bimolecular destruction of the intermediate metal-organic oligomerization centers. This deactivation process leads to the decrease in oligomerization activity. In some cases as a result of the intermediate metal-organic centers destruction the transition metal passes to its less oxidation state favorable for the polymerization activity of the catalyst. The presence of bulky bisphenolate ligands in the coordination sphere strongly restricts the bimolecular deactivation of oligomerization centers. This, in turn, leads to the increase of their stability and the stability of the catalyst as a whole. The bulky bisphenolate ligands are favorable for the increase of metal-cationic character of the catalytic centers, responsible for oligomerization (dimerization) activity of the catalyst, due to more effective separation of positively charged transition metal-organic centers from negatively charged Al-containing complex counterion. As a result, the total effect arises with an increased oligomerization activity and decreased (or eliminated) polymerization activity in the course of ethylene oligomerization. <br>
<br>
On the other hand the increased metal-cationic character of oligomerization centers intensifies the chain transfer processes going through the ß-hydrogen elimination in these centers. Thus the catalytic centers become more prone to lead the dimerization and trimerization reaction of ethylene instead of its long chain oligomerization process. As a result, at the early stages the rapid accumulation of dimerization and trimerization products takes place. The accumulation of the first dimerization product, 1-butene, follows by its secondary codimerization with ethylene (hydro vinylation) yielding 1- hexene. The accumulation of 1-hexene follows by its codimerization with ethylene obtaining for example 1-octene.The codimerization (hydro vinylation) rate decreases rapidly in the line 1-butene » 1-hexene &gt; 1-octene &gt; 1-decene. Such a serial-parallel dimerization process leads to the deviation from Schultz-Flory distribution and, hence, to the increase in C6-Ci0 alpha-olefm content in the product. High selectivity in alpha- olefm content (&gt; 98-99%) is also provided by the presence of bulky bisphenolate ligands in inner coordination sphere of the transition metal, directing the transition metal atom to the end of the intermediate oligoalkyl-zirconium chain obtained as a result of alpha-olefm addition to intermediate zirconium-H species addition in the course of chain transfer reaction.<br>
<br>
The C6-CiO linear alpha-olefm obtained with the process according to the invention is a colourless and transparent liquid. The structure of C6-CiO linear a-olefins has been determined by gas chromatography, infra-red- and NMR-spectral methods. This analysis shows that the alpha-olefm purity of the linear alpha-olefms according to the invention ranges between about 95% and 98%.<br>
<br>
Zhu et al. disclose zirconium complexes in the publication "Preparation and structure of 6- and 7- coordinate salen-type zirconium complexes and their catalytic properties for oligomerization of ethylene" in the Journal of Organometallic Chemistry (17 September 2005,pages 3929-3936).In contrast to the present invention the salen- and salphen type zirconium complexes described by Zhu et al have in their structure diimine type bridging groups (-CH=N CH2 -CH2 N=CH-, - CH=N -Ph - N=CH). These 6- and 7-coordinated salen- and salphen type zirconium complexes have very rigid saturated octahedral (or more)coordination sphere. On that reason it is difficult to activate them by aluminum-organic compounds at temperatures below 1000C. A higher temperature is <br>
<br>
needed to make their coordination sphere more mobile (flexible) to be able to react with aluminum-organic activators. The precursors according to the present invention have 4- and 5-coordinated unsaturated and mobile coordination sphere. On that reason they easily react with aluminum organic compounds to give active centers mediating oligomerization process at lower temperatures. The catalytic systems according to Zhu are unstable and exhibit only moderate activity only at temperatures higher than 15O0C. The systems according to the present invention are more stable and have high activity at temperatures between for example 5O0C and 1000C. Furthermore the olefin purity of oligomerization products obtained using the precursors according to Zhu is low (between 74,9% and 91,6%) which makes them unusable as co-monomers in ethylene polymerization processes.<br>
<br>
The invention will be elucidated with reference to the following non-limiting examples.<br>
<br>
Examples 1-20<br>
<br>
In the examples the oligomerization of ethylene was carried out in the presence of the specified catalyst for a period of 0.5-2 hours.<br>
<br>
The experimental conditions of the examples are summarised as follows:<br>
<br>
AU materials were handled in a nitrogen atmosphere using either schlenk techniques or nitrogen filled glove box. Nitrogen and toluene were purchased or supplied from a plant source and were dried through an additional bed of molecular sieves, if necessary.<br>
<br>
The examples 1-18 and 19-20 were carried out in two different reactors.<br>
<br>
The examples 1-18 were carried out in a reactor from stainless steel with a capacity of<br>
<br>
0.5 liter. After consuming a certain volume of ethylene, an autoclave was disconnected from ethylene supplying line and cooled up to room or lower (up to - 350C) temperature. The un-reacted part of ethylene and some quantity of the synthesized butene-1 were passed through a trap cooled by a mixture of dry ice with acetone.<br>
<br>
Then 2ml of aqueous NaOH solution (10%) was added into the autoclave and the reaction mixture was stirred within 5 minutes for deactivation of catalyst. The condensed butene-1 was analyzed by the GC method. The liquid products of reaction were discharged from the autoclave and analyzed by the method of gas-liquid chromatography. <br>
<br>
The examples 19-20 were conducted in a 2-liter stainless steel reactor vessel, jacketed with external / internal cooling coils. Feeding the ethylene and nitrogen gases into the reactor were controlled by mass flow controllers. The mass flow controllers operated with the computer control system to control flow rate per minute and total gas flow. After the reaction was continued for indicated amount of time with maintaining the reaction conditions, the reaction was stopped by adding 20 ml ethanol to the reaction mixture. The linear alpha-olefm product obtained was separated, collected and analyzed by gas chromatography.<br>
