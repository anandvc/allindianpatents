				<td>ANTIOXIDANT WOUND DRESSING MATERIALS<br>
The present invention relates to antioxidant wound dressing materials, processes<br>
suitable for the preparation of such materials, and to the use of such wound<br>
dressing materials.<br>
Concentrations of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals (-OH), singlet<br>
oxygen (1O2), hydroperoxyl radicals (-OOH), superoxideradical anions (-O2-). and<br>
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can rise in damaged tissues, producing a condition<br>
known as oxidative stress. The presence of a low level of reactive oxygen species<br>
may be advantageous in the early stages of wound healing by both attracting and<br>
activating macrophages which engulf and kill bacteria and release cytokines and<br>
growth factors. However, prolonged and more severe oxidative stress may delay<br>
healing because it will produce chronic inflammation, divert available energy<br>
supply towards antioxidant defence at the expense of tissue reconstruction, and<br>
increase levels of matrix metalloproteinases which cause tissue breakdown. In<br>
more severe cases, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species can give rise to<br>
hydrogen peroxide-induced senescence or apoptosis (that is, programmed cell<br>
death) or tissue necrosis (that is, uncontrolled cell death and therefore permanent<br>
tissue damage).<br>
Under mild oxidative stress, it is thought that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is the<br>
dominant species present, being formed rapidly from superoxide by the enzyme<br>
superoxide dismutase. This enzyme-mediated dismutation reaction also<br>
minimises the production of singlet oxygen that can arise when superoxide is<br>
produced too rapidly and therefore has the opportunity to dismutate spontaneously<br>
without enzyme assistance. Rapid enzyme-mediated dismutation of superoxide<br>
also minimises levels of hydroperoxyl radical, the unionised form of superoxide.<br>
Levels of hydrogen peroxide are in turn kept low by the actions of catalase and<br>
glutathione peroxidase. Thus, under mild oxidative stress conditions when<br>
hydrogen peroxide levels are slightly raised (around 10-8 to 10-4 molar), it has been<br>
found that the rate of cell proliferation in fibroblast cultures is stimulated.<br><br>
Accordingly, the healing of chronic wounds may be assisted by the use of<br>
antioxidant wound dressings that react specifically with excess reactive oxygen<br>
species such as those listed above and hence reduce the level of oxidative stress.<br>
â€¢ US-A-5667501 describes compositions comprising chemically modified polymers<br>
grafted with chemical groups that confer antioxidant activity as measured by a<br>
diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test and that also generate low levels of hydrogen<br>
peroxide by reaction with molecular oxygen in the wound bed to stimulate<br>
macrophage activity and fibroblast proliferation. The compositions may be used to<br>
promote the healing of chronic wounds. Preferably, the polymer is a polymer<br>
bearing hydroxyl, carbonyl or amide functional groups, or a polysaccharide bearing<br>
hydroxyl functional groups, said functional groups having been converted to<br>
derivatives that are persistent free radicals or precursors of persistent free<br>
radicals, that is to say they are free radical scavenging antioxidant groups.<br>
US-A-5612321 describes compositions comprising polysaccharides grafted with<br>
antioxidants on at least one hydroxyl group of the polysaccharide. The<br>
compositions may be used inter alia to promote the healing of chronic wounds.<br>
Preferably, the polysaccharide is hyaluronic acid and the antioxidant group<br>
comprises a phenol group.<br>
The above antioxidant wound dressing materials are made by multi-step chemical<br>
reactions to achieve covalent bonding of antioxidant moieties, such as<br>
hydroquinones or benzimidazole derivatives, to the polymeric substrate materials.<br>
A need remains for a more simple and inexpensive route to antioxidant wound<br>
dressing materials.<br>
Wound dressings that contain antimicrobial agents for the treatment of wound<br>
infection are also known. Currently preferred antimicrobial agents for use in<br>
wound dressings are certain antiseptics such as chlorhexidine and triclosan, and<br>
silver, whether in the form of thin films, nanoparticles, or colloidal silver. Chemical<br>
compounds of silver are also useful as antimicrobials. For example, the following<br>
complex silver salts are favored for use against sensitive and resistant bacterial<br><br>
strains: silver sulfadiazine, silver norfloxacinate, silver pipemidate, kaolin silver,<br>
silver EDTAate, silver thiosalicylate and silver imidazolium chloride.<br>
WO91/11206 describes the use of silver alginate salts in wound dressings.<br>
WO87/05517 describes silver salts of hyaluronic acid that may be used as or in<br>
antimicrobial wound dressings. These materials tend not to be stable in the<br>
presence of light. The silver undergoes photochemical reduction to metallic silver,<br>
causing a darkening of the materials over time.<br>
WO02/43743 describes light-stabilized antimicrobial wound dressing materials in<br>
which silver salts are stabilized by the addition of a photostabilizer selected from<br>
the group consisting of ammonium salts, thiosulfates, metal chlorides and<br>
peroxides. WO97/02038 describes light-stabilized antimicrobial wound dressing<br>
materials in which silver salts are stabilized by the addition of a polyether polymer.<br>
Such photostabilizers are of limited effectiveness, and will tend to be extracted<br>
from the dressing material by wound fluid.<br>
A need therefore remains for improved antimicrobial dressings containing light-<br>
stabilized silver compounds.<br>
GB-A-619165 describes calcium alginate fibers for use as wound dressings. A<br>
bacteriostatic or antiseptic compound, such as an acridine derivative or eusol, may<br>
be applied to the filaments after they are formed, or may be added to the solution<br>
from which the filaments are drawn. Calcium alginate is not bioabsorbable.<br>
EP-A-0368253 describes chitosan films, rods, sheets, medicated bandages,<br>
patches and the like that have been fabricated from solutions or mixtures of certain<br>
chitosan derivatives in combination with antimicrobial agents. There is no<br>
disclosure of dyeing a bioabsorbable wound dressing material with an antioxidant<br>
dye.<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a wound dressing material<br>
comprising a solid bioabsorbable substrate dyed with an antioxidant dyestuff.<br><br>
The term "dyed" refers to a solid material that has been surface-treated while in<br>
the solid state with a dye to bind the dye to the surface thereof. That is to say, a<br>
solid material that has been subjected to post-treatment with a dye after<br>
solidification. It has been found that bioabsorbable substrate materials such as<br>
oxidized regenerated cellulose have excellent avidity for antioxidant dyes such as<br>
aniline and acridine dyes. This enables controlled amounts of the dyes to be fixed<br>
onto the substrate materials in a simple and inexpensive dyeing step. It has<br>
further been found that the resulting dyed materials retain the antioxidant<br>
properties of the dyestuff, thereby making them excellent candidates for the<br>
treatment of chronic wounds and other wounds characterised by elevated levels of<br>
oxygen free radicals. The materials also have useful antimicrobial properties, in<br>
particular against gram-positive and sometimes also gram-negative bacteria. The<br>
gradual breakdown of the bioabsorbable material in the wound achieves sustained<br>
release of effective amounts of antimicrobial.<br>
The term "bioabsorbable substrate material" refers to a solid material that is fully<br>
degraded and absorbed in vivo in the mammalian body. The term therefore does<br>
not encompass cellulose or conventional textile materials. The substrate material<br>
is usually not water soluble, but it may be water swellable. In certain<br>
embodiments, the substrate comprises (and may consist essentially of) a solid<br>
bioabsorbable material selected from the group consisting of collagens, chitosans,<br>
bioabsorbable cellulose derivatives such as oxidized celluloses, galactomannans<br>
such as guar/borate, glycosaminoglycans such as cross-linked hyaluronates,<br>
polylactides/polyglycolides, polyhydroxybutyrates, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In certain embodiments the substrate comprises (and may consist essentially of) a<br>
solid bioabsorbable material selected from the group consisting of collagens,<br>
chitosans, oxidized regenerated celluloses, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Oxidized cellulose is produced by the oxidation of cellulose, for example with<br>
dinitrogen tetroxide. This process converts primary alcohol groups on the<br>
saccharide residues to carboxylic acid group, forming uronic acid residues within<br><br>
the cellulose chain. The oxidation does not proceed with complete selectivity, and<br>
as a result hydroxyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 are occasionally converted to the<br>
keto form. These ketone units introduce an alkali labile link, which at pH7 or<br>
higher initiates the decomposition of the polymer via formation of a lactone and<br>
sugar ring cleavage. As a result, oxidized cellulose is biodegradable and<br>
bioabsorbable under physiological conditions.<br>
The preferred oxidized cellulose for practical applications is oxidized regenerated<br>
cellulose (ORC) prepared by oxidation of a regenerated cellulose, such as rayon.<br>
It has been known for some time that ORC has haemostatic properties, and that<br>
application of ORC fabric can be used to reduce the extent of post-surgical<br>
adhesions in abdominal surgery.<br>
The oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC) can be obtained by the process<br>
described in US-A-3122479, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. This material offers numerous advantages including the features that it<br>
is biocompatible, biodegradable, non-immunogenic and readily commercially<br>
available. ORC is available with varying degrees of oxidation and hence rates of<br>
degradation. The ORC may be used in the form of insoluble fibers, including<br>
woven, non-woven and knitted fabrics.<br>
In certain embodiments, the oxidized cellulose is in the form of particles, such as<br>
fiber particles or powder particles, preferably dispersed in a suitable solid or<br>
semisolid topical medicament vehicle. In particular, the materials preferably<br>
contain ORC fibers, wherein a volume fraction of at least 80% of the fibers have<br>
lengths in the range of 20pm to 1000pm. Such a size distribution can be<br>
achieved, for example, by milling an ORC cloth, followed by sieving the milled<br>
powder to remove fibers outside the range. Preferably, the average (mean by<br>
volume) length of the ORC fibers is in the range 250pm to 450pm. The selection<br>
of ORC fiber lengths in this range results in easy mixing of the ORC and other<br>
components, and highly homogeneous products. The ORC is more thoroughly<br>
complexed with the other components, which results in enhanced therapeutic<br>
properties of the sponge.<br><br>
Preferably, the oxidised cellulose has an average molecular weight greater than<br>
50,000. Such oxidised cellulose is substantially insoluble in wound fluids, but will<br>
undergo very gradual breakdown into bioresorbable fragments at physiological pH.<br>
The oxidized cellulose may be in its free acid form, or it may be neutralized. For<br>
example, the present invention encompasses the use of partially or completely<br>
neutralised materials as described in EP-A-0437095, the entire content of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. For example, the ORC may be partially<br>
neutralised by a silver salt of a weak acid, such as silver acetate, as described in<br>
more detail below.<br>
In certain embodiments of the present invention, the oxidized cellulose is<br>
complexed with collagen and/or chitosan to form structures of the kind described<br>
in WO98/00180, WO98/00446, EP-A-1153622 or WO2004/026200, the entire<br>
contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. For example,<br>
the oxidized cellulose may be in the form of milled ORC fibres that are dispersed<br>
in a freeze-dried collagen sponge. This provides for certain therapeutic and<br>
synergistic effects arising from the complexation with collagen.<br>
Where used, the collagen in the materials of the present invention may be any<br>
collagen, including Type I, Type II or Type III collagen, natural fibrous collagen,<br>
atelocollagen, partially hydrolysed collagens such as gelatin, and combinations<br>
thereof. Natural fibrous collagen, for example of bovine origin, is suitable. For<br>
example, the collagen prepared from bovine hide is a combination of Type I<br>
collagen (85%) and Type III collagen (15%).<br>
Where used, the chitosan in the materials of the present invention is usually<br>
derived from chitin. Chitin is a natural biopolymer composed of N-acetyl-D-<br>
glucosamine units. Chitin may be extracted from the outer shell of shrimps and<br>
crabs in known fashion. The chitin is then partially deacetylated, for example by<br>
treatment with 5M-15M NaOH, to produce chitosan. Complete deacetylation of<br>
the chitin is not a practical possibility, but preferably the chitosan is at least 50%<br>
deacetylated, more preferably at least 75% deacetylated. Chitosan has been<br><br>
employed for wound treatment in various physical forms, e.g. as a solution/gel;<br>
film/membrane; sponge; powder or fiber. Chitosan in the free base form is<br>
swellable but not substantially soluble in water at near-neutral pH, but soluble in<br>
acids due to the presence of ammonium groups on the chitosan chain. The<br>
solubility of the chitosan may be reduced by cross-linking, for example with<br>
epichlorhydrin. Typically, the average molecular weight of the chitosan as<br>
determined by gel permeation chromatography is from about 105 to about 106.<br>
In particular embodiments, the substrate comprises (and may consist essentially<br>
of) a mixture of: (a) collagen and/or chitosan; and (b) oxidized regenerated<br>
cellulose, for example in a dry weight ratio range of from about 90:10 to about<br>
10:90 of collagen/chitosan:ORC, preferably from about 75:25 to about 25:75, and<br>
particularly from about 60:40 to about 40:60.<br>
The wound dressing materials according to the present invention may also contain<br>
a silver salt. Some of the silver may be present as metallic silver, but preferably a<br>
major part of the silver is present as a silver salt, preferably as a substantially<br>
colorless silver salt. Preferably, the silver in the material consists essentially of<br>
silver salts, more preferably as substantially colorless silver salts. Preferably, the<br>
amount of silver (as silver ions and metallic silver) in the materials according to the<br>
present invention is from about 0.01 wt% to about 5wt.%, more preferably from<br>
about 0.1 wt% to about 2wt.%, and most preferably about 0.1wt.% to about 1wt.%,<br>
most preferably about 0.3wt.%. Lesser amounts of silver could give insufficient<br>
antimicrobial effect. Greater amounts of silver could give rise to antiproliferative<br>
effects on wound healing cells.<br>
The silver may be introduced by treating a bioabsorbable substrate material with a<br>
silver salt or compound dissolved or dispersed in water or an organic solvent such<br>
as ethanol, for example as described in WO02/43743. Suitable compounds<br>
include silver oxide, silver chromate, silver allantoinate, silver borate, silver<br>
glycerolate, silver nitrate, silver acetate, silver chloride, silver sulfate, silver lactate,<br>
silver bromide, silver iodide, silver carbonate, silver citrate, silver laurate, silver<br><br>
deoxycholate, silver salicylate, silver p-aminobenzoate, silver p-aminosalicylate,<br>
and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the silver is not present as silver sulfadiazine.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the silver may be complexed to the substrate material.<br>
The term "complex" refers to an intimate mixture at the molecular scale, preferably<br>
with ionic or covalent bonding between the silver and the polymer. The complex<br>
preferably comprises a salt formed between an anionic polymer and Ag+. Suitably,<br>
the anionic polymer is a polycarboxylate or a polysulfated polysaccharide.<br>
Suitably, the anionic polymer comprises an anionic polysaccharide. Suitable<br>
anionic polysaccharides include hyaluronates, pectins, carrageenans, xanthan<br>
gums, sulfated polysaccharides such as dermatan sulfate or sulfated dextrans,<br>
and oxidized celluloses.<br>
The complex of an anionic polymer and silver can be made by a method<br>
comprising the step of treating an anionic polymer with a solution of a silver salt.<br>
Preferably, the solution is an aqueous solution. Preferably, the anionic polymer is<br>
substantially insoluble in water at pH7, and the treatment is therefore carried out<br>
on the polymer in the solid state. For example, the polymer may be in the form of<br>
solid fibers, sheet, sponge or fabric. In certain embodiments, the anionic polymer<br>
is a salt and the treatment therefore can be regarded as an ion exchange. In other<br>
embodiments, the anionic polymer is at least partly in free acid form, in which case<br>
the silver salt is preferably a salt of a weak acid, for example silver acetate,<br>
whereby the anionic polymer is at least partially neutralised by the silver salt.<br>
Similar processes are described in EP-A-0437095, the entire content of which is<br>
expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The neutralization reaction can be carried out in water or alcohol alone but is<br>
preferably carried out in mixtures of water and alcohols. The use of a mixture of<br>
water and alcohol provides good solubility for the weak acid salts via the water,<br>
and the alcohol prevents the anionic polymer from excessively swelling, distorting<br>
and weakening during the neutralization. Thus the physical properties of the<br>
material are retained. Methanol is the preferred alcohol because many of the<br>
above-mentioned salts have good solubility in this alcohol in combination with<br><br>
water. Preferably, the alcohol to water ratio has a range of about 4:1 to 1:4 . If the<br>
solution becomes too rich in alcohol, some salts may no longer be soluble<br>
particularly if the alcohol is other than methanol. If the solution becomes too rich<br>
in water, some swelling of the polymer will occur as neutralization takes place and<br>
there will be some loss in physical properties such as in the tensile strength of the<br>
polymer. Other useful alcohols include, for example, ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol<br>
and isopropyl alcohol.<br>
The use of a mild neutralizing agent such as silver acetate allows for control of the<br>
degree of neutralization. Use of stoichiometric and chemically equivalent amounts<br>
of neutralizing agent and carboxylic acid on the anionic polymer does not produce<br>
a 100% neutralized polymer as would be produced with strong irreversible<br>
reactions with bases such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium<br>
bicarbonate and ammonium hydroxide.<br>
Anionic polymers behave as an ion exchanger and will pull out of solution the<br>
silver cation of any silver salt that is passed over them. The by-product of this<br>
exchange is an acid from the salt and by using a salt of a weak organic acid, a<br>
weak acid such as acetic acid is produced which does no damage to the polymer.<br>
Using salts of strong acids such as sodium chloride or sodium sulfate produces<br>
hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid by-products respectively, and these strong acids<br>
can cause damage such as depolymerization of the polymer<br>
When using silver salts of weak acids, the silver ion is exchanged for a proton on<br>
the polymer and part of the salt is converted to weak acid. The mixture of acid and<br>
salt in the solution results in a buffered solution which maintains a fairly constant<br>
pH and controls the degree of neutralization. An equilibrium reaction is established<br>
whereby the silver ions are bound to the acid portion of the polymer and also to<br>
the salt molecules. This partitioning of the silver ions prevents the neutralization of<br>
the polymer from going to completion.<br>
Using a stoichiometric amount of, for example, silver acetate brings about a 65-<br>
75% degree of neutralization of the carboxylic acid groups on an oxidized cellulose<br><br>
polymer. This control of pH by creating a self generating buffered solution and the<br>
use of methanol to control the swelling of the material, leads to a partially<br>
neutralized material in which the physical properties, e.g. tensile strength and<br>
shape of the polysaccharide, are preserved.<br>
The amount of silver salt used is generally about equal to or up to twice the<br>
stoichiometric amount of acid content of the polymer. Alternatively, a second<br>
charge of a stoichiometric amount of silver salt can be used if the reaction is<br>
recharged with fresh solvent and salt after the first charge reaches a constant pH.<br>
The material with elevated pH is then washed to remove the excess silver salt<br>
and ions therefrom.<br>
In some embodiments, at least a portion of the wound dressing material comprises<br>
a collagen complexed with silver. This can be achieved by treating a collagen with<br>
a solution of a silver salt. The silver salt may for example be silver acetate or<br>
silver nitrate at a concentration of about 0.01 molar to about 1 molar. The<br>
treatment is preferably carried out at a pH of from about 5 to about 9. It is thought<br>
that the silver complexes primarily to the nitrogen-containing side chains of the<br>
collagen amino acids, in particular to lysine, hydroxylysine, asparagine, glutamine<br>
and arginine. The silver could also bind to the sulfhydryl groups of methionine and<br>
cysteine residues, where present, and to carboxyl groups of aspartate and<br>
glutamate.<br>
Preferably the amount of silver in the collagen complex is from about 0.01 to about<br>
30% by weight based on the weight of the collagen, more preferably from about<br>
0.1% to about 20%, more preferably from about 2% to about 10% by weight.<br>
Preferably, the amount of silver-collagen complex in the wound dressing material<br>
is from about 0.1 to about 10 wt.%, more preferably from about 0.1 to about<br>
2wt.%. In any case, the total amount of silver in the wound dressing material is<br>
generally as specified above.<br>
It will be appreciated that the complexes of silver with substrate materials<br>
described above may be prepared with a relatively high silver content, for example<br><br>
greater than 5wt.%, and then diluted with further substrate material (the same or<br>
different) to achieve the desired overall silver content of from 0.01wt.% to 5wt.%,<br>
preferably from about 0.2wt.% to about 2wt.%.<br>
The materials according to the present invention may be provided in the form of <br>
beads, flakes, powder, and preferably in the form of a film, a fibrous pad, a web, a <br><br>
woven or non-woven fabric, a freeze-dried sponge, a foam or combinations <br>
thereof. In certain embodiments, the solid bioabsorbabie substrate is selected <br>
from the group consisting of woven fabrics, knitted fabrics, and nonwoven fabrics, <br>
all of which may be made by conventional methods. In other embodiments, the<br>
solid bioabsorbabie substrate may comprise (or consist essentially of) a freeze-<br><br>
dried sponge or a solvent-dried sponge, for example as described hereinbefore.<br>
The solid bioabsorbabie substrate is typically in sheet form, for example a sheet of<br>
material having an area of from about 1cm2 to about 400cm2, in particular from<br>
about 2cm2 to about 100cm2. The basis weight of the sheet is typically from about<br>
100g/m2 to about 5000g/m2, for example from about 400g/m2 to about 2000g/m2.<br>
The solid bioabsorbabie substrate material may make up at least 50% by weight of<br>
the wound dressing material, for example at least 75% by weight or at least 90%<br>
by weight.<br>
The term "dyestuff" refers to a material that is useful as a colorant for textile<br>
materials, that is to say an organic compound that is strongly light-absorbing in the<br>
visible region 400-700nm. In certain embodiments, the antioxidant dyestuff is<br>
selected from the group consisting of aniline dyes, acridine dyes, thionine dyes,<br>
bis-naphthalene dyes, thiazine dyes, azo dyes, anthraquinone dyes, and mixtures<br>
thereof. For example, the antioxidant dyestuff may be selected from the group<br>
consisting of gentian violet, aniline blue, methylene blue, crystal violet, acriflavine,<br>
9-aminoacridine, acridine yellow, acridine orange, proflavin, quinacrine, brilliant<br>
green, trypan blue, trypan red, malachite green, azacrine, methyl violet, methyl<br>
orange, methyl yellow, ethyl violet, acid orange, acid yellow, acid blue, acid red,<br>
thioflavin, alphazurine, indigo blue, methylene green, and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
The dyestuffs also stabilize silver salts present in the material against<br>
photochemical decomposition, in particular against photochemical reduction to<br>
metallic silver, by absorbing light near the surface of the material. The dyestuffs<br>
further trap photochemically generated free radicals that could otherwise react with<br>
the silver. In this way the dyestuffs can act as photochemical desensitisers. In<br>
addition to the conventional dyestuffs listed above, medically acceptable organic<br>
desensitisers of the kind used in photography may be suitable for use as the<br>
dyestuffs in the materials of the present invention.<br>
The dyestuff may be present in the wound dressing material according to the<br>
invention in an amount of from about 0.05% to about 5wt.%, typically about 0.2 to<br>
about 2wt.% based on the dry weight of the material.<br>
The wound dressing material may also comprise up to 20% by weight, preferably<br>
less than 10% by weight of water. The material may also contain 0-40% by<br>
weight, preferably 0-25% by weight of a plasticiser, preferably a polyhydric alcohol<br>
such as glycerol. The material may also comprise 0-10% by weight, preferably 0-<br>
5% by weight of one or more therapeutic wound healing agents, such as non-<br>
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. acetaminophen), steroids, antibiotics (e.g.<br>
penicillins or streptomycins), antiseptics (e.g. silver sulfadiazine or chlorhexidine),<br>
or growth factors (e.g. fibroblast growth factor or platelet derived growth factor).<br>
All of the above percentages are on a dry weight basis.<br>
The wound dressing material according to the present invention is preferably<br>
sterile and packaged in a microorganism-impermeable container.<br>
Preferably, the material according to the present invention has a free radical<br>
activity, that is to say an antioxidant activity, of at least about 15% in the<br>
diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test, measured as percentage reduction in<br>
absorbance at 524nm after 4 hours of a 0.5%w/v dispersion of the polysaccharide<br>
in 10-4M DPPH, as described further hereinbelow in Procedure 1. Preferably the<br>
percentage reduction in absorbance in the DPPH test (after correction for any<br><br>
absorbance by the dye) is at least about 25%, more preferably at least about 50%,<br>
and most preferably at least about 75%.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the material according to the present invention may<br>
exhibit antioxidant activity as measured by its ability to inhibit the oxidation of<br>
ABTS (2,2'-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulphonate]) by a peroxidase.<br>
Preferably, the material according to the present invention will absorb water or<br>
wound fluid and hence become wet, swell or become a gelatinous mass but will<br>
not spontaneously dissolve or disperse therein. That is to say, it is hydrophilic but<br>
has a solubility of preferably less than about 1g/liter in water at 25Â°C. Low<br>
solubility renders such materials especially suitable for use as wound dressings to<br>
remove reactive oxygen species from the wound fluid.<br>
The antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the materials according to the<br>
present invention suggest applications in a range of medical applications, including<br>
the treatment of acute surgical and traumatic wounds, bums, fistulas, venous<br>
ulcers, arterial ulcers, pressure sores (otherwise known as decubitus ulcers),<br>
diabetic ulcers, ulcers of mixed aetiology, and other chronic or necrotic wounds<br>
and inflammatory lesions and disorders. The materials according to the present<br>
invention are intended for the treatment of both infected and non-infected wounds<br>
(that is to say wounds showing no clinical signs of infection).<br>
Accordingly, in a second aspect, the present invention provides the use of a<br>
material according to the present invention for the preparation of a medicament for<br>
the treatment of a wound. Preferably, the wound is a chronic wound. More<br>
preferably, the chronic wound is selected from the group consisting of ulcers of<br>
venous, arterial or mixed aetiology, decubitus ulcers, or diabetic ulcers.<br>
Preferably, the material is used as an antioxidant to reduce oxidative stress in the<br>
wound environment and thereby to promote wound healing.<br>
In a related aspect, the present invention provides a method of treatment of a<br>
wound in a mammal comprising applying thereto a therapeutically effective<br><br>
amount of a material according to the present invention. Preferably, the wound is<br>
a chronic wound.<br>
In a third aspect, the present invention provides a wound dressing comprising an<br>
antioxidant wound dressing material according to the present invention.<br>
The wound dressing is preferably in sheet form and comprises an active layer of<br>
the material according to the invention. The active layer would normally be the<br>
wound contacting layer in use, but in some embodiments it could be separated<br>
from the wound by a liquid-permeable top sheet. Preferably, the area of the active<br>
layer is from about 1cm2 to about 400 cm2, more preferably from about 4cm2 to<br>
about 100cm2.<br>
Preferably, the wound dressing further comprises a backing sheet extending over<br>
the active layer opposite to the wound facing side of the active layer. Preferably,<br>
the backing sheet is larger than the active layer such that a marginal region of<br>
width 1mm to 50mm, preferably 5mm to 20mm extends around the active layer to<br>
form a so-called island dressing. In such cases, the backing sheet is preferably<br>
coated with a pressure sensitive medical grade adhesive in at least its marginal<br>
region.<br>
Preferably, the backing sheet is substantially liquid-impermeable. The backing<br>
sheet is preferably semipermeable. That is to say, the backing sheet is preferably<br>
permeable to water vapour, but not permeable to liquid water or wound exudate.<br>
Preferably, the backing sheet is also microorganism-impermeable. Suitable<br>
continuous conformable backing sheets will preferably have a moisture vapor<br>
transmission rate (MVTR) of the backing sheet alone of 300 to 5000 g/m2/24hrs,<br>
preferably 500 to 2000 g/m2/24hrs at 37.5 oC at 100% to 10% relative humidity<br>
difference. The backing sheet thickness is preferably in the range of 10 to 1000<br>
micrometers, more preferably 100 to 500 micrometers. It has been found that<br>
such moisture vapor transmission rates allow the wound under the dressing to<br>
heal under moist conditions without causing the skin surrounding the wound to<br>
macerate.<br><br>
Suitable polymers for forming the backing sheet include polyurethanes and poly<br>
alkoxyalkyl acrylates and methacrylates such as those disclosed in GB-A-<br>
1280631. Preferably, the backing sheet comprises a continuous layer of a high<br>
density blocked polyurethane foam that is predominantly closed-cell. A suitable<br>
backing sheet material is the polyurethane film available under the Registered<br>
Trade Mark ESTANE 5714F.<br>
The adhesive (where present) layer should be moisture vapor transmitting and/or<br>
patterned to allow passage of water vapor therethrough. The adhesive layer is<br>
preferably a continuous moisture vapor transmitting, pressure-sensitive adhesive<br>
layer of the type conventionally used for island-type wound dressings, for example,<br>
a pressure sensitive adhesive based on acrylate ester copolymers, polyvinyl ethyl<br>
ether and polyurethane as described for example in GB-A-1280631. The basis<br>
weight of the adhesive layer is preferably 20 to 250 g/mz, and more preferably 50<br>
to 150 g/m2. Polyurethane-based pressure sensitive adhesives are preferred.<br>
Further layers of a multilayer absorbent article may be built up between the active<br>
layer and the protective sheet. For example, these layers may comprise an<br>
absorbent layer between the active layer and the protective sheet, especially if the<br>
dressing is for use on exuding wounds. The optional absorbent layer may be any<br>
of the layers conventionally used for absorbing wound fluids, serum or blood in the<br>
wound healing art, including gauzes, nonwoven fabrics, superabsorbents,<br>
hydrogels and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the absorbent layer comprises a<br>
layer of absorbent foam, such as an open celled hydrophilic polyurethane foam<br>
prepared in accordance with EP-A-0541391, the entire content of which is<br>
expressly incorporated herein by reference. In other embodiments, the absorbent<br>
layer may be a nonwoven fibrous web, for example a carded web of viscose staple<br>
fibers. The basis weight of the absorbent layer may be in the range of 50-<br>
500g/m2, such as 100-400g/m2. The uncompressed thickness of the absorbent<br>
layer may be in the range of from 0.5mm to 10mm, such as 1mm to 4mm. The<br>
free (uncompressed) liquid absorbency measured for physiological saline may be<br><br>
in the range of 5 to 30 g/g at 25Â°. Preferably, the absorbent layer or layers are<br>
substantially coextensive with the active layer.<br>
The wound facing surface of the dressing is preferably protected by a removable<br>
cover sheet. The cover sheet is normally formed from flexible thermoplastic<br>
material. Suitable materials include polyesters and polyolefins. Preferably, the<br>
adhesive- facing surface of the cover sheet is a release surface. That is to say, a<br>
surface that is only weakly adherent to the active layer and the adhesive on the<br>
backing sheet to assist peeling of the adhesive layer from the cover sheet. For<br>
example, the cover sheet may be formed from a non-adherent plastic such as a<br>
fluoropolymer, or it may be provided with a release coating such as a silicone or<br>
fluoropolymer release coating.<br>
Typically, the wound dressing according to the present invention is sterile and<br>
packaged in a microorganism-impermeable container.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of manufacture of an<br>
antioxidant wound dressing material, comprising the step of dyeing a<br>
bioabsorbable substrate material with a suitable dye. The method preferably<br>
further comprises treating the substrate material with a silver salt dissolved or<br>
dispersed in water or an organic solvent.<br>
The method according to the present invention may be used to prepare a wound<br>
dressing according to the present invention.<br>
The method of the present invention may comprise dyeing a substrate material in<br>
sheet form, for example a woven, nonwoven or knitted fabric or sponge sheet of<br>
the substrate material by immersing it in a dye bath, followed by washing to<br>
remove unbound dye and drying. In other embodiments, the substrate material<br>
may be dyed while it is in fibrous or particulate form, followed by forming the<br>
material into a sheet. For example, a slurry of fibers or particles of the substrate<br>
material may be treated with dye, and then freeze-dried to form a dyed sponge.<br>
The silver treatment may be carried out after the step of removing unbound dye.<br><br>
It will be appreciated that any feature or embodiment that is described herein in<br>
relation to any one aspect of the invention may also be applied to any other aspect<br>
of the invention equally.<br>
Certain specific embodiments of the present invention will now be described<br>
further in the following examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
An antioxidant wound dressing material based on a collagen/ORC freeze-dried<br>
sponge material is prepared as follows.<br>
The collagen component is prepared from bovine corium as follows. Bovine<br>
corium is split from cow hide, scraped and soaked in sodium hypochlorite solution<br>
(0.03% w/v) to inhibit microbial activity pending further processing. The corium is<br>
then washed with water and treated with a solution containing sodium hydroxide<br>
(0.2% w/v) and hydrogen peroxide (0.02% w/v) to swell and sterilize the corium at<br>
ambient temperature. The corium splits then undergo an alkali treatment step in a<br>
solution containing sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate<br>
(0.4% w/v, 0.6% w/v andO.05% w.v, respectively) at pH greater than 12.2, ambient<br>
temperature, and for a time of 10-14 days, with tumbling, until an amide nitrogen<br>
level less than 0.24mmol/g is reached. The corium splits then undergo an acid<br>
treatment step with 1% hydrochloric acid at ambient temperature and pH 0.8-1.2.<br>
The treatment is continued with tumbling until the corium splits have absorbed<br>
sufficient acid to reach a pH less than 2.5. The splits are then washed with water<br>
until the pH value of corium splits reaches 3.0-3.4. The corium splits are then<br>
comminuted with ice in a bowl chopper first with a coarse comminution and then<br>
with a fine comminution setting. The resulting paste, which is made up in a ratio of<br>
650g of the corium splits to 100g of water, as ice, is frozen and stored before use<br>
in the next stage of the process. However, the collagen is not freeze-dried before<br>
admixture with the ORC &amp; other components in the next stage.<br><br>
The ORC component of the freeze-dried pad is prepared as follows. A<br>
SURGICEL cloth (Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical, Arlington) is milled using a rotary<br>
knife cutter through a screen-plate, maintaining the temperature below 60Â°C.<br>
Methylene blue, an acidic dye, was incorporated by dissolving an appropriate<br>
amount of the dye in 0.05M acetic acid and adding to the collagen paste with the<br>
milled ORC powder to obtain a final solids concentration of 1%. Samples were<br>
made in which the dye was incorporated at the following concentrations in the<br>
slurry: 0% (reference example), 1mg/ml, 0.5mg/ml and 0.1mg/ml.<br>
The resulting slurries were poured to a depth of 3mm in petri dishes, placed onto<br>
freezer shelves where the temperature has been preset to -40Â°C. The freeze-drier<br>
programme was then initiated to dry and dehydrothenmally cross-link the collagen<br>
and ORC to form sponge pads. On completion of the cycle, the vacuum was<br>
released, sponge samples were then packaged, and sterilized by cobalt 60<br>
gamma-irradiation.<br>
Example 2<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was followed, but replacing the methylene blue dye<br>
by crystal violet, a basic dye. The crystal violet was incorporated at the following<br>
concentrations in the slurry: 0% (reference example), 1mg/ml, 0.5mg/ml and<br>
0.1mg/ml.<br>
Example 3<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was followed, but replacing the methylene blue dye<br>
by flavin 3,6-Diaminoacridine hemisulfate, a basic dye. The flavin was<br>
incorporated at the following concentrations in the slurry: 0% (reference example),<br>
1mg/ml, 0.5mg/ml and 0.1mg/ml.<br>
Example 4<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was followed, but replacing the methylene blue dye<br>
by flavin 3,6-Diaminoacridine hemisulfate, a basic dye. The flavin was<br><br>
incorporated at the following concentrations in the slurry: 0% (reference example),<br>
1mg/ml, 0.5mg/ml and 0.1mg/ml.<br>
Example 5<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was followed, but replacing the methylene blue dye<br>
by a mixture of methylene blue and flavin 3,6-Diaminoacridine hemisulfate, each<br>
dye being incorporated in the slurry at a concentration of 0.5mg/ml.<br>
Example 6<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was followed, but replacing the methylene blue dye<br>
by a mixture of crystal violet and flavin 3,6-Diaminoacridine hemisulfate, each dye<br>
being incorporated in the slurry at a concentration of 0.5mg/ml.<br>
Example 7<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was followed, but replacing the methylene blue dye<br>
by a mixture of crystal violet and methylene blue, each dye being incorporated in<br>
the slurry at a concentration of 0.5mg/ml.<br>
Examples 8-14<br>
Silver was incorporated into the wound dressing materials made as described in<br>
Examples 1-7 by dissolving silver acetate in 0.05M acetic acid and adding the<br>
solution to the ORC/colIagen slurry in an amount sufficient to produce a final slurry<br>
containing 1wt.% silver on a total solids basis.<br>
The sponges according to the invention obtained in Examples 1 to 14 all showed<br>
stable absorption of the dyes. The sponges could be soaked in serum at 25Â°C for<br>
a number of days and remained coloured at all times. Depending on<br>
concentration of dye added there was an initial release of the excess dye and then<br>
a gradual release as the sponges began to degrade.<br><br>
Procedure 1<br>
The ability of the wound dressing materials to react with and remove oxygen<br>
containing free radicals is assessed by the DPPH test described in W094/13333,<br>
the entire content of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. The test<br>
is adapted from that described by Blois M.S. in Nature 181: 1199 (1958), and<br>
Banda P.W. et al., in Analytical Letters 7: 41 (1974).<br>
Briefly, the wound dressing material under test (2.5mg; 5mg; &amp; 25mg sample<br>
sizes) was suspended in 2.5ml of 0.1 M pH 7.0 phosphate buffer. A solution of<br>
diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in methanol (10-4 M) was added in an amount of<br>
2.5 ml and the mixture was shaken and stored in the dark at 20Â°C. The samples<br>
were assessed by measurement of their light absorbance at 524nrh over 6 hours<br>
in comparison with a control, particular attention being paid to the figure after 4<br>
hours. The percentage reduction of absorbance relative to the control after 4<br>
hours gives the DPPH test value, with a reproducibility generally of Â±5%. This<br>
value may conveniently be expressed in terms of a simple reduction in absorbance<br>
units (AU) relative to the control.<br>
Ascorbic acid, a well-known antioxidant, provides a useful positive control<br>
substance for comparative purposes. Freeze-dried sponges of chitin/chitosan and<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose were used as negative controls.<br>
Application of this test to the materials according to the present invention of<br>
Examples 1-7 resulted in DPPH test values of 80 - 90% for the positive control<br>
(10-4M). In contrast, the negative controls chitin/chitosan and hydroxyethyl<br>
cellulose exhibited much lower DPPH values of less than 15%. The collagen/ORC<br>
without any added dye exhibited some activity in the DPPH test, indicating that<br>
ORC itself has some antioxidant properties. The dyed materials according to the<br>
present invention exhibited significantly higher activity in the DPPH test than<br>
collagen/ORC alone, consistent with antioxidant activity of the dyes.<br>
Procedure 2<br><br>
The bactericidal activity of the sponges prepared in Examples 8 to 14 is tested on<br>
pseudomonas Aeruginosa and staphylococcus Aureus by looking at zone of<br>
inhibition.<br>
Six 2cm x 2cm squares of each sample are cut out in sterile conditions. On day<br>
one of the experiment, cultures of both Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853<br>
and various PSI strains) and Staphylococcus aureus (provided by the Dept of<br>
Clinical Microbiology and Pathology) are incubated aerobically at 37Â°C for 24<br>
hours on Diagnostic Sensitivity Agar (DSA). After 24 hours test samples are each<br>
placed on a DSA plate and immediately wetted with 0.5mls of a buffer solution.<br>
Three squares of sample are placed on plates inoculated with Pseudomonas<br>
aeruginosa and three are placed on plates inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
The plates are then incubated at 37Â°C for 24 hours. The zone of inhibited growth<br>
around the sample is then measured using calipers, and the test sample is placed<br>
on a new inoculated DSA plate. A swab test is carried out on the area beneath the<br>
sample to determine if the sample is bacteriostatic if not bactericidal by smearing<br>
the swab on a DSA plate and incubating it for 24 hours and then examining the<br>
growth. The samples are transferred onto fresh inoculated plates with the above<br>
procedure being carried out every 24 hours for 72 hours as long as the samples<br>
remain intact.<br>
As a negative control, a freeze dried sponge of 45%ORC/55%collagen without any<br>
silver or dye was tested. A commercially available silver-containing antimicrobial<br>
dressing (ACTICOAT, registered trade mark of Smith &amp; Nephew) and silver nitrate<br>
solution (0.5%) were used as positive controls and zones of inhibition were<br>
observed for both over the test period.<br>
It is found that significant bactericidal effects are observed against Staphylococcus<br>
aureus and Pseudomonas Aeruginosa for the materials according to the invention.<br>
The performance of the materials containing 1% silver and above is expected to<br>
be comparable to that of the ACTICOAT dressing.<br><br>
