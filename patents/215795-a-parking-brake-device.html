				<td>The present invention relates to an parking brake device to be mounted on a vehicle whose body is commonly used for a vehicle having a specification for a manual parking brake and a vehicle having a specification for a foot stepping type parking brake.<br>
Parking brake devices for vehicles are categorized into a manual type one in which a lever is manually pulled for braking and a pedal stepping type in which a pedal is stepped for braking. Also, in some cases, the same kind of vehicles are categorized into a vehicle on which a manual parking brake device is mounted, i.e., a so-called manual parking brake specification vehicle and a vehicle on which a foot stepping parking brake device is mounted, i.e., a so-called foot stepping parking brake specification vehicle. The same body is used for each of these specification vehicles. Among the parking brakes to be mounted on such specification vehicles, the manual parking brake device will first be described with reference to Figs. 18 and 19.<br>
Fig. 18 shows an overview of the manual parking brake device 1 for an automotive vehicle. Fig.. 19 is a side elevational view thereof. In this manual parking brake device 1, a leg portion 6 of a support bracket 5 constituting a parking lever 4 is fixed by three bolts 7 to a parking lever mounting bracket 3 welded to a body floor 2, and a lever portion 8 is rotatably mounted on the support bracket 5.<br>
One end portion of an inner cable 11 of each parking cable 10 is coupled integrally with a proximal end Sa of the lever portion 8 by a pin 12 through an equalizer 9 on the proximal end 8a side of the lever portion 8. The other end portion of the inner cable 11 is, as shown in Fig. 18,<br><br>
connected to a parking lever (not shown) for right and left brake shoes of rear wheels. Incidentally, in Fig. 19, reference numeral 13 denotes an outer cable of each parking cable 10. reference numeral 14 denotes a ratchet of the lever portion 8, and, reference numeral 15 denotes a parking brake switch.<br>
The foot stepping parking brake device 16 will next be described with reference to Figs. 20 and 21. The foot stepping parking brake device 16 has been made a parking cable 10 to be supported to an equalizer retainer bracket 17 welded to a body floor 2, and furthermore, a portion F of the parking cable 10 on the front side of the vehicle from an equalizer 9 has been made to be arranged through a cross member 18 fixed to the vehicle floor 2.<br>
Furthermore, a front end portion of the inner cable 11 of the parking cable 10 is connected to a parking pedal 19 and a rear end portion of the inner cable 11 is connected to a parking lever (not shown) of right and left brake shoes of rear wheels. Actually, a fixed position of the equalizer retainer bracket 17 of the foot stepping type parking brake device 16 has been adapted to be a fixed position of the parking lever mounting bracket 3 of the manual parking brake device 1. Incidentally, in Fig. 21, reference numeral 20a denotes a bolt for fixing the parking cable 10, and reference numeral 20b denotes a nut for retaining the parking pedal 19 in place.<br>
Incidentally, Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. Hei 5-76931 discloses a parking brake device. In the device disclosed in this publication, a transmission cable for connecting the pedal and the brake portion with each other is laid to pass through a side portion of the driver's seat, furthermore a retainer mechanism for limiting a brake release direction of the transmission cable and allowing the transmission cable to move in the brake working direction in accordance with a pedal stepping depth is provided at a<br><br>
position on the side of the driver's seat, and a release lever connected to the retainer mechanism through a release cable is provided.<br>
Also, Japanese Patent La id-Open No.,	He.i 6~<br>
344895 discloses a power assist parking brake. In the brake disclosed in this publication, a manual cylinder that cooperates with the parking lever is provided, a spool valve operated by this manual cylinder for opening/closing is provided and the equalizer is operated through a parking cylinder in accordance with a hydraulic pressure adjusted by this spool valve, thereby the brake is operated.<br>
In the above-described prior art, the manual parking brake specification vehicle and the foot stepping type parking brake specification vehicle are different from each other in arrangement of the parking cable or mounting means for the parking brake device. For this reason, it is necessary to make the vehicle floors differently for coping with these factors. Namely, the vehicle bodies must be manufactured differently for the parking brake device having the different specifications. For example, in case of the foot stepping type, since the parking cable is arranged to pass through the cross member, it is necessary to form through-holes in the cross-member and the equalizer retainer bracket. For this reason, the number of process for changing the steps has been increased, and the number of the process management has been increased, resulting in degradation in workability. Also, a cost for the molds for the different portions has been increased.  <br>
Also, the parking lever mounting bracket of the manual parking brake device and the equalizer retainer bracket of the foot stepping type parking brake device are different in shape, in particular, in case of the manual parking brake device, since it is necessary to fix the leg portion of the support bracket to the parking lever mounting bracket by the three bolts, thereby the workability is also degraded when<br><br>
mounting the parking lever.<br>
Incidentally, none of the parking brake device disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. Hei 5-76931 .and the power assist parking brake disclosed in Japanese<br>
iPatent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 6-344895 resolves the ] task of the present invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An example of an embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 3. Incidentally, the same reference numerals are used to indicate the same or like members used in Figs. 18 to 21 showing the conventional example. Fig. 1 shows a primary part of a manual parking brake device 21 according to the present invention. A parking lever 22 is mounted directly on a vehicle floor 2 as shown in Fig. 2 not through the parking lever mounting bracket 3 (Figs. 18 and 19) as in the prior art. Thus, since the parking lever mounting bracket 3 is not interposed, the equalizer 9 is maintained under the lifted condition.<br>
The parking lever 22 is essentially structured with a lever portion 23 and a support bracket 24 for rotatably supporting the lever portion 23. Two leg portions 25 and 26 are provided on the lower portion of the support bracket 24 in a longitudinal direction of the vehicle. Proximal ends of the two leg portions 25 and 26 are bent oppositely each other to form bent portions 25a and 26a (see Figs. 1 to 3). The bent portions 25a and 26a are brought into direct contact with the vehicle floor 2 and fixed thereto by bolts 7 to thereby support the support bracket 24. In the case where the leg portions 25 and 26 are fixed, as shown in Fig. 2. bolts 7 passing through the bent portions 25a and 26a are screwed with melt bonded nuts 27 mounted on a rear surface of the vehicle floor 2.<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 2, a handle portion for a driver is formed at one side of the lever portion 23 and an equalizer 9 is connected to the other side through a wire 28. As shown in Fig. 1, the front ends of the inner cables 11 of the parking cables 10 are connected to the equalizer 9 by bolts 12. Although not shown, the rear ends of the inner cables 11 are connected to right and left parking levers for brake shoes of rear wheels.<br><br>
Incidentally, in Fig. 1, reference numerals 13 denote outer cable of the parking cables 10. Also, in Fig. 2, reference numeral 14 denotes a ratchet which engages with a tooth portion formed in the support bracket 24.<br>
As described above, since the two leg portions 25 and 26 are formed in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle on the support bracket 24 for retaining the lever portion 23, and the leg portions 25 and 26 are fixed directly to the vehicle floor 2, respectively, to mount the parking lever 22 to the vehicle floor 2. the parking lever mounting bracket which is needed in the prior art is unnecessary and these may be dispensed with. Accordingly, as described above, the equalizer 9 is held under the lifted condition. Furthermore, since the bent portions 25a and 26a of the two leg portions 25 and 26 are fixed to the vehicle floor 2 by the bolts 7 and 7, respectively, the fixture is effected only by the two bolts 7 and 7, it is'possible to reduce the number of the management steps and the number of the working steps in comparison with the conventional three-bolt system.<br>
In an embodiment shown in Figs. 4 to 6, an L-shaped bracket 30 is bonded by melting to a position opposite to the bent portion 26a and a bent portion 30a of the L-shaped bracket 30 is brought in contact with the vehicle floor 2. Thus, it is possible to manipulate the lever portion 23 in a stabler manner.<br>
Namely, actually in the case where the lever portion 23 is strongly manipulated, as shown in Fig. 2, an upward force P, is applied to the front side leg portion 25 of the support bracket 24 and a downward force P2 is applied to the rear side leg portion 26. At this time, as shown in Fig. 3, since the rear side leg portion 26 which receives the force P2 is mounted on a position (displaced position) offset away from a center line 0 of the parking lever 22, a moment is applied thereto so that the force P for bending the parking lever 22 in the direction indicated by the arrow works.<br><br>
Accordingly, by mounting the L-shaped bracket 30 as described above, the balance of the rear side leg portion 26 may be kept and the offset is canceled so that the force P will not work to the support bracket 24.<br>
The above-described L-shaped bracket 30 may or may not be mounted on the leg portion 26 of the support bracket 24. However, it is possible to more stabilize the fixture by mounting the L-shaped bracket 30 in the case where the leg portions 2b and 26 of the support bracket 24 are long. Also, as shown in Fig. 7, in the case where the leg portions 25 and 26 of the support bracket 24 are short in accordance with a kind of the vehicle, it is not necessary to mount the L-shaped bracket 30. In case of a kind of the vehicle in which the waist position of the seat is low, the operation position of the parking lever 22 of the manual parking brake device 21 is also low in level. As a result, a distance between the mounting surface of the leg portions 25 and 26 of the support bracket 24 and the portion to which the force is applied (fulcrum or the like) becomes short in length so that the generated moment is small.<br>
The foot stepping type parking brake device will now be described with reference to Figs. 8 to 10. Incidentally, the same reference numerals are used to indicate the same members as shown in Figs. 20 and 21. Fig. 8 shows a primary part of the foot stepping type parking brake device 31 (Fig. 10). As shown, the parking cable 10 is retained by a cable support bracket holder 32 fixed to the vehicle floor 2 (Figs. 9 and 10) by bolts 7.<br>
The bolt hole position on the vehicle 33 (Fig. 10) side for mounting the cable support bracket holder 32 and the bolt hole position on the vehicle 33 side o£ the parking lever 22 of the manual parking brake device 21 are formed at the same portion. By thus identifying the bolt hole positions at the same portion, it is possible to commonly use the manual parking brake specification vehicle and the foot stepping<br><br>
parking brake specification vehicle 33 (Fig. 10).<br>
Fig. 10 shows a system in which the foot stepping type parking cable device 31 is mounted on the commonly used vehicle 33. The parking cable 10 is held by the cable support bracket holder 32. Incidentally, in Figs. 8 to 10, reference numeral 19 denotes a parking pedal. Also, in Fig. 9, reference character 20a denotes a bolt for retaining the parking cable 10 and reference character 20b denotes a nut for holding the parking pedal 19.<br>
The above-described cable support bracket holder 32 will be described with reference to Figs. 11 to 14. The cable support bracket holder 32 has a crank-shape as viewed from above. Its central portion becomes a central plate portion. One side of the central plate portion, i.e, the front side F of the vehicle is formed into a abutment plate seat surface 34. An embossment 35 is provided on the abutment plate seat surface 34. Also, a cutaway portion 36 directed to a center of the central plate portion is formed in the upper portion of the central plate portion. Then, the abutment plate seat surface 34 has a slant angle8 of several degrees (about 7 to 10° ) so that the upper side portion is slanted on the longitudinal direction R of the vehicle to the lower side portion (Fig. 13).<br>
Also, a mounting portion 39 extending from the abutment plate seat surface 34 for the vehicle floor 2 with a bolt hole 38 is formed at a slant side portion 37 formed on each side of the abutment plate seat surface 34. Furthermore, a projecting piece 40 extending outwardly so as to intersect with the slant side portion 37 is formed on the top portion of the cable support bracket holder 32. A mounting hole 42 for mounting a protective cover 41 (Fig. 9) for preventing the tread deformation is provided to the projecting piece 40. Incidentally, in Fig. 11, reference numeral 43 denotes an abutment plate held in contact with the abutment plate seat surface 34 and mounted on the parking cable 10. A cutaway<br><br>
groove 43a is formed in the abutment plate 43.<br>
Figs. 15 to 17 show a state where the abutment plate 43 is in abutment with the abutment plate seat surface 34 of the cable support bracket holder 32 to hold the parking cable 10. More specifically, the abutment plate 43 is fitted around the parking cable 10 through a protective pipe 44. The protective pipe 44 and the parking cable 10 which are kept under this condition are fitted to the cutaway portion 36 of the central plate portion. The cutaway groove 43a of the abutment plate 43 is fitted to the embossment 35 to limit the position of the abutment plate 43. Furthermore, the parking cable 10 is fixed in place by stop members 45. Incidentally, the reason why the abutment plate 43 is in abutment with the abutment plate seat surface 34 is that the loads of the right and left parking cables 10 are dispersed by the abutment plate 34.<br>
As described above, by using the cable support bracket holder 32 for the arrangement of the parking cables 10 of the foot stepping type parking brake device 31, the parking cables 10 are arranged to pass above the cross member 18 (Fig. 9). Namely, since the abutment plate seat surface 34 of the cable support bracket holder 32 has the slant angle 6 , the parking cables 10 may be passed above the cross member 18 located on the front side F of the vehicle from the cable support bracket holder 32.<br>
Thus, the necessity of passing the parking cable 10 through the cross member 18 is obviated. The parking cable 10 is thus arranged so that, as shown in Fig. 9, a space 46 is formed between the cable support bracket holder 32 and the cross member 18 and a shock detection sensor 47 for an air bag may be disposed in this space 46. In order to prevent the malfunction of the air bag, it is preferable that this sensor 47 be located at a position where the vibration and the shock are hardly applied upon travelling. The above-described space 46 is the most suitable position for installing the sensor 47.<br><br>
This cable support bracket holder 32 may be applied to a stick type parking brake device instead of the foot stepping type parking brake device 31. Furthermore, it is possible to slant the central plate portion of the cable support bracket holder 32 with the upper portion thereof more forwardly to the front side F oC longitudinal direction of the vehicle than the lower portion thereof. In this case, the cable support bracket holder 32 is disposed more forwardly than the cross member 18 on the front side F of the longitudinal direction of the vehicle.<br>
In accordance with the first aspect of the invention, since the two leg portions of the support bracket for rotatably supporting the lever portion of the manual parking lever are fixed directly to the vehicle, it is possible to dispense with the parking lever mounting bracket which has conventionally been used. Also, since the two leg portions are fixed to the vehicle by the respective bolts, it is possible to reduce the number of the working steps and the number of the management steps to enhance the workability.<br>
In accordance with the second aspect of the invention, since the leg portions may be fixed by the two bolts, it is possible to reduce the number of the working steps and the number of the management steps to enhance the workability. Furthermore, since the bent portion of the L-shaped bracket melt bonded to the rear side leg portion is brought into contact with the vehicle, it is possible to drag the lever portion of the parking lever in a stable manner.<br>
In accordance with the third aspect of the invention, in the foot stepping type parking brake, since the cable support bracket holder substantially in the form of a crank as viewed from above is arranged in the front portion of the equalizer to make it possible to keep the parking cable, it is possible to arrange the parking cable to pass above the upper portion of the cross member of the vehicle.<br>
In accordance with the fourth aspect of the invention.<br><br>
since the abutment plate fitted around the parking cable may be held by the abutment plate seat surface formed in the central plate portion of the cable support bracket holder, it is possible to stably hold the parking cables. Also, since the embossment is formed in abutment plate, if the cutaway groove o£ the abutment plate is engaged with this embossment, it is possible to limit the mounting position of the abutment plate, to enhance the precision of the assembly and to enhance the rigidity.<br>
In accordance with the fifth aspect of the invention, since the upper portion of the central plate portion of the cable support bracket holder is slanted at several degrees rearwardly on the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, it is possible to arrange the parking cable held by the central plate portion to be passed through above the cross member disposed on the front side of the cable support bracket holder. Also, it is possible to make the swing angle of the inner cables of the foot stepping type the same as that of the manual parking lever. Thus, it is possible to use the same parking cables as the manual type.<br>
In accordance with the sixth aspect of the invention, since the bolt hole position on the vehicle side of the parking lever of the manual parking brake device and the bolt hole position on the vehicle side of the cable support bracket holder of the foot stepping type parking brake device are formed at the same portion, it is possible to commonly use the vehicle body for the manual parking brake specification vehicle and the foot stepping type parking brake specification vehicle.<br>
Various details of the invention may be changed without departing from its spirit nor its scope. Furthermore, the foregoing description of the embodiments according to the present invention is provided for the purpose of illustration only, and not for the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br><br><br>
