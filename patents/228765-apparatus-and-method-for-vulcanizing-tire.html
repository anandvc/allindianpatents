				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR VULCANIZING TIRE<br>
1.	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present inventiol. relates to a tire vulcanizing<br>
apparatus and a tire vulcanizing method for continuously<br>
vulcanizing and molding a creen tire (a raw tire), and more<br>
particularly to a technique or supplying the green tire to the<br>
tire vulcanizing apparatus.<br>
2.	BACKGROUND ART<br>
In conventional technique, a ":ire vulcanizing apparatus<br>
for continuously vulcanizing and molding a green tire is provided<br>
with a cradle for receiving the green tire, an upper mold and<br>
a lower mold for vulcanizing and molding the green tire, and<br>
a tire elevating apparatus for setting the green tire to the<br>
lower mold.<br>
The green tire is molded by steps comprising mounting the<br>
green tire on the cradle, temporarily holding the green tire<br>
by the tire elevating apparatas, thereafter setting the green<br>
tire to the lower mold, and vulcanizing and molding the green<br>
tire between the lower mold and the upper mold.<br>
The applicant of the present invention has already proposed<br>
a tire vulcanizing apparatus which solves a time loss in the<br>
molding step (Japanese Unexanined Patent Publication No.<br>
2000-158447).<br>
The prior tire vulcaniz:.ng apparatus is provided with,<br>
as shown in Figs. 2A, 2B, 2C ar.d 2D, a cradle 6 which receives<br>
a green tire T f roma tire supplying apparatus 5 at a tire receiving<br>
position Ml moves the received green tire T to a tire supplying<br>
position M2 , a tire elevating apparatus 8 which elevates at the<br>
tire supplying position M2 so as to hold the green tire T on<br><br>
the cradle 6, and sets the green tire T to a lower mold 7, and<br>
an upper mold 9 which eleva ;es at a tire vulcanizing position<br>
M3 so as to vulcanize and rrold the green tire T with respect<br>
to the lower mold 7.<br>
Further, the structure is made such that a moving unit<br>
U in which the cradle 6 anc the lower mold 7 are integrally-<br>
connected is formed, and the lower mold 7 is reciprocated between<br>
the tire supplying position M2 and the tire vulcanizing position<br>
M3 at the same time when the cradle 5 is moved between the tire<br>
receiving position Ml and the tire supplying position M2 by<br>
reciprocating the moving unit U.<br>
In the prior tire vulcanizing apparatus, since the moving<br>
unit U in which the cradle 6 and the lower mold 7 are integrally<br>
connected is formed, the green tire is supplied to the cradle<br>
6 from the tire supplying apparatus 5 at a time of setting the<br>
green tire T to the lower mold 7 , the lower mold 7 is moved to<br>
the tire vulcanizing posit ion M3 from the tire supplying position<br>
M2 by setting the green tire T to the lower mold 7 and thereafter<br>
moving the moving unit U, and the cradle 6 is moved to the tire<br>
supplying position M2 from the tire; receiving position Ml.<br>
As mentioned above, in the case that the lower mold 7 is<br>
moved from the tire supplying position M2 to the tire vulcanizing<br>
position M3, the cradle 6 is left at the tire supplying position<br>
M2 during the movement, and can not be supplied the green tire<br>
T.<br>
Accordingly, the time at which the cradle 6 can receives<br>
the green tire T is limited tc the time for setting the green<br>
tire T to the lower mold 7, so that the time for supplying the<br>
green tire T is shortened. Accordingly, there is a problem that<br><br>
the apparatus is hard to handle at a time of practical operation.<br>
The present invention is made in order to solve the problem<br>
mentioned above, and an object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a tire vulcanizing apparatus and a tire vulcanizing<br>
method which can suf f iciently secure a time for supplying a green<br>
tire by conveying the green tire to a tire supplying position<br>
during a vulcanizing and molding step which has the longest time<br>
in the tire vulcanizing step.<br>

waiting position Y4 at the tire vulcanizing position.<br>
The tire conveying apparatus 1 conveys a green tire T<br>
received at the conveyance waiting position X1 to the tire<br>
supplying position X2 , and is returned to the conveyance waiting<br>
position X1 after the green tire T ;.s held by the tire elevating<br>
apparatus 2 at the tire supplying position X2.<br>
The tire conveying apparatus 1 preferably employs an<br>
optionally movable structure such as a self-propelled supply<br>
car.<br>
The tire elevating apparatus 2 is structured such as to<br>
ascend the green tire T com, eyed to the tier supplying position<br>
X2 by the tire conveying apparatus 1 to the ascent holding position<br>
Y1 while holding, and to des rend to the descent setting position<br>
Y2 from the ascent holding position Y1 so as to set the green<br>
tire T to the lower mold 3 coming to the tire supplying position<br>
X2.<br>
The green tire T is set to the lower mold 3 by the tire<br>
elevating apparatus 2 at the tire supplying position X2. In<br>
this case, a center mechanism provided with a bladder (not shown)<br>
is provided in the lower nold 3, and the green tire T is set<br>
to the lower mold 3 while preventing the green tire T from being<br>
deformed in accordance with a shaping on the basis of a closely<br>

Further, the tire co lveying apparatus 1 is structured such<br>
as to reciprocate between the conveyance waiting position X1<br>
and the tire supplying position X2 at one time during a period<br>
of vulcanizing and molding the green tire T between the lower<br>
mold 3 and the upper mold 4 at the tire vulcanizing position<br>
X3.<br>
Next, a description will be given of a tire vulcanizing<br>
method.<br>
A description will be firist given of a step of supplying<br>
the green tire T by mear s of the tire conveying apparatus 1.<br>
In a tire conveyance supplying step (Fig. 1B), the tire<br>
conveying apparatus 1 is moved from the conveyance waiting<br>
position X1 to the tire supplying position X2, and the green<br>
tire T received at the corveyance waiting position X1 is conveyed<br>
to the tire supplying position X2.<br>
Next, there is executed a tire ascent holding step (Fig.<br>
1C) of ascending the green tire T on the tire conveying apparatus<br>
1 to the ascent holding position Y1 by holding the green tire<br>
by the tire elevating apparatus 2 after the tire conveyance<br>
supplying step (Fig. 13).<br><br>
Next, there is executed a tire conveyance returning step<br>
(Fig. ID) of moving the tir 2 conveying apparatus 1 from the tire<br>
supplying position X2 to the conveyance waiting position X1 after<br>
the tire ascent holding step (Fig. 1C).<br>
In accordance with the steps mentioned above, the green<br>
tire T is supplied (for example, Fig. 1E) to the tire conveying<br>
apparatus 1 by a tire delivering apparatus (not shown) during<br>
the tire conveyance returiing step (Figs. 1D to 1G) in which<br>
the tire conveying apparatus 1 is moved at the conveyance waiting<br>
position X1, and thereafter each of the operations are repeated<br>
in the order of the tire conveyance supplying step (Fig. 1B) ,<br>
the tire ascent holding step (Fig. 1C) and the tire conveyance<br>
returning step (Fig. 1D) in the same manner as mentioned above.<br>
Next, a description will be given of a tire vulcanizing<br>
and molding step by the lower mold 3 and the upper mold 4.<br>
There is executed a tire descent setting step (Fig. 1G)<br>
of descending the tire elsvating apparatus 2 from the ascent<br>
holding position Y1 to the descent setting position Y2 so as<br>
to set the green tire T tc the lower mold 3 coming to the tire<br>
supplying position X2 frona the tire vulcanizing position X3,<br>
after the tire ascent holding step (Fig. 1C) .<br>
Next, there is executed a supply moving step (Fig. 1A)<br>
of moving the lower mold 3 in a state of setting the green tire<br>
T from the tire supplying position X2 to the tire vulcanizing<br>
position X3, after the tire descent setting step (Fig. 1G) .<br>
There is executed a tire vulcanizing step (Fig. 1B) of<br>
vulcanizing and molding the green tire T between the upper mold<br>
descending to the descent vulcanizing portion Y3 and the lower<br>
mold 3 at the tire vulcarizing position X3, after the supply<br><br>
moving step (Fig. 1A).<br>
Further, the tire conveyance supplying step (Fig. 1B),<br>
the tire ascent holding step (Fig. 1C) and the tire conveyance<br>
returning step (Fig. 1D) are executed during a period (Figs.<br>
1B to 1D) of executing the tire vulcanizing step.<br>
Next, there is executed a leaving step (Fig. 1E) of<br>
ascending the upper mold 4 to the ascent waiting position Y4<br>
so as to leave from the lower mold 3, after the tire vulcanizing<br>
step (Fig. 1D).<br>
Further, there is executed a return moving step (Fig. 1F)<br>
of moving the lower mold 3 from the tire vulcanizing position<br>
X3 to the tire supplying position X2, after the leaving step<br>
(Fig. 1E).<br>
The tire T1 after being vulcanized and molded are taken<br>
out from the upper mold 4 during a period (Figs. 1F to 1G) of<br>
the return moving step (For example, Fig. 1F).<br>
In the tire vulcanizing method mentioned above, since the<br>
lower mold 3 and the tire conveying apparatus 1 can independently<br>
move, a timing of moving the lire conveying apparatus 1 is not<br>
limited by the movement of the lower mold 3.<br>
Accordingly, as mentioned above;, it is possible to execute<br>
the tire conveyance supplying step (Fig. 1B), the tire ascent<br>
holding step (Fig. 1C) and the tire conveyance returning step<br>
(Fig. 1D) during a period (Figs. 1B to 1D) of executing the tire<br>
vulcanizing step.<br>
Accordingly, the green tire T can be conveyed to the tire<br>
supplying position X2 during the vulcanizing and molding step<br>
having a longest time in the tire vulcanizing step, the supplying<br>
tire for the green tire T can be sufficiently secured and it<br><br>
is possible to easily handle the green tire T.<br>
In this case, in the present invention, one tire conveying<br>
apparatus may be employed for one tire vulcanizing apparatus,<br>
or one tire conveying apparatus may be used in common for a<br>
plurality of tire vulcanizing apparatuses.<br>
In the case that one tire conveying apparatus is provided,<br>
for example, for a plurality of tire vulcanizing apparatuses<br>
arranged in front, rear, right and left sides, the structure<br>
may be made such that the green tires are stocked in a lump,<br>
and the green tire is mounted and supplied to the tire conveying<br>
apparatus in correspondence to a production schedule and an<br>
operating condition of each of the tire vulcanizing apparatuses.<br>
Further, although beilg omitted in the embodiment<br>
mentioned above, it goes without saying that the vulcanized and<br>
molded tire taken out from the upper mold can be continuously<br>
delivered to the PCI apparatus (pressurizing and cooling<br>
apparatus) so as to be stabilized in a molding state.<br>

executed during said vulcanizing and molding step.<br><br>
The present invention provides a tire vulcanizing apparatus<br>
comprising:<br>
a tire conveying apparatus(1) which reciprocates between a<br>
conveyance waiting position(X1) and a tire supplying position (X2),<br>
conveys a green tire(T) received at the conveyance waiting position (X1)<br>
to the tire supplying position(X2), and returns to the conveyance waiting<br>
position (X1) after the green tire (T) is held at the tire supplying<br>
position(X2) by a tire elevating apparatus(2);<br>
the tire elevating apparatus(2) which elevates at said tire<br>
supplying position (X2), ascends the green tire (T) conveyed to the tire<br>
supplying position (X2) by said tire conveying apparatus to an ascent<br>
holding position while holding the green tire (T), and descends to a<br>
descent set position(Y2) from the ascent holding position (Y1) so as to<br>
set the green tire (T) to a lower mold (3) coming to said tire supplying<br>
position (X2);<br>
the lower mold(3)which reciprocates between said tire supplying<br>
position (X2) and a tire vulcanizing position (X3), to which the green<br>
tire (T) is set at said tire supplying position (X2) by the tire elevating<br>
apparatus (2) and which is moved to the tire vulcanizing position (X3)<br>
from the tire supplying position (X2) in a state of setting the green<br>
tire (T) , vulcanizes and molds the green tire (T) with respect to an<br>
upper mold (4) at the tire vulcanizing position (X3) , and thereafter is<br>
moved to the tire supplying position (X2) from the tire vulcanizing<br>
position (X3); and<br>
an upper mold (4) which elevates at said tire vulcanizing position<br>
(X3), vulcanizes and molds the green tire (T) with respect<br>
to said lower mold (3) at a descent vulcanizing position (Y3) , and<br>
thereafter ascends to an ascent waiting position (Y4) so as to move apart<br>
from said lower mold(3),<br>
wherein said tire conveying apparatus (1) reciprocates at one time<br>
between the conveyance waiting position (X1) and the tire supplying<br>
position (X2) during a period of vulcanizing and molding the green tire<br>
(T) between the lower mold (3) and the upper mold (4) at the tire<br>
vulcanizing position(X3).</td>
