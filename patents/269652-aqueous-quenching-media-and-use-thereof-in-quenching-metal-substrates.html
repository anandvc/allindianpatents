				<td>AQUEOUS QUENCHING MEDIA AND USE THEREOF IN QUENCHING METAL SUBSTRATES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to aqueous quenching media and processes using the same for quenching metal substrates.<br>
Various methods of heat treating metal substrates are known and include heating a metal substrate to an elevated temperature and then cooling. The cooling step, which is known in the art as "quenching", typically is performed rapidly and is accomplished by immersing the hot metal substrate in a liquid quenching medium, i.e. a quenching bath, which typically is water or oil.<br>
When the quenching medium is water alone, very rapid cooling of the metal substrate occurs. Rapid cooling is not suitable for many types of steel, since it tends to produce excessive strain which warps and cracks the steel. When the quenching medium is a hydrocarbon oil, a slower rate of cooling occurs. This can impart certain desirable physical properties in the metal substrate, including ductility in steel. Even though the slower cooling rate provided by oil quenching prevents or reduces excessive strain in the metal substrate, it often has the undesirable side-effect of preventing the metal substrate from adequately hardening.<br>
A variety of aqueous media is available for quenching metal substrates and may include one or more of a polymer. For example, US Patent No. 3,220,893 discusses a quenching medium containing an oxyalkylene polymer having oxyethylene and higher oxyalkylene groups which form a desirable covering over the metal substrate surface during quenching. The polymer layer that coats the metal permits relatively short quenching times, thereby resulting in minimum internal stress of the metal substrate, minimum distortion of the metal substrate, and imparts uniform hardenability of the metal substrate.<br>
US Patent Nos. 3,902,929, 4,826,545, and RE 34119 discuss aqueous quenching media containing a polyvinylpyrrolidone and US Patent No. 4,087,290 discusses an aqueous quenching medium containing a water-soluble polyacrylate, such as a sodium polyacrylate, which forms a vapor blanket about the metal substrate during the quenching operation.<br>
Typically, aqueous polymer-based quenching media contain large amounts of polymer, e.g., 10 to 15% by weight, and "drag out" occurs during quenching in which the polymer coating that initially forms around in the metal substrate is removed. When drag out occurs, the viscosity of the quenching medium changes due to presence of solid polymer, thereby requiring an additional step of washing the quenched metal substrate to remove any of the solid polymer present on the metal substrate.<br>
What is needed in the art are quenching media which will cool a heated metal substrate at a rate similar to oil-based quenching media at a rate that is between oil and water, while achieving the greatest degree of hardness without warping or cracking the metal substrate.<br>

(Formula Removed) <br>
In a further aspect, processes for quenching heated metal substrates are provided and include quenching the heated metal substrate with an aqueous quenching medium containing a non-ionic, water-soluble or water-dispersible<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone/polyvinylcaprolactam copolymer; and a non-ionic, water-soluble or water-dispersible polymer including one or more of (a) a substituted oxazoline polymer; (b) a poly(oxyethyleneoxyalkylene) glycol polymer; or (c) a polyvinylpyrrolidone polymer.<br>
In yet a further aspect, concentrates for preparing aqueous quenching media useful in the heat treatment of metal substrates are provided and contain at least about 5% by weight of a mixture of the aqueous quenching medium.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be readily apparent from the following detailed description of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides aqueous quenching media and processes for treating metal substrates using these aqueous quenching media. The inventors found that when a metal substrate is heated to an elevated temperature, the aqueous quenching media described herein are effective in quenching the metal substrate without warping or cracking the metal substrate.

EXAMPLE 1: QUENCHING METAL SUBSTRATES USING AQUEOUS QUENCHING MEDIA<br>
Fifteen aqueous quenching media were prepared:<br>
(a)	Quenching media 1 -5 contained aqueous solutions of<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone/polyvinylcaprolactam copolymer of Formula I above and/or a<br>
substituted oxazoline polymer of Formula II above;<br>
(b)	Quenching media 6-10 contained aqueous solutions of polyvinylpyrrolidone/polyvinylcaprolactam copolymer of Formula I above and/or a poly(oxyethylene-oxyalkylene) glycol of Formula III above; and<br>
(c)	Quenching media 11-15 contained aqueous solutions of polyvinylpyrrolidone/polyvinylcaprolactam copolymer of Formula I and/or a polyvinylpyrrolidone polymer of Formula IV above. The sample concentrations are set forth in Table I.<br>
In order to determine cooling times, the IVF Quenchotest (The Swedish Institute of Production Engineering Research) was utilized and included the IVF data acquisition/recording unit, test probe, probe handle and furnace. The test probe (600 mm in length and 12.5 mm diameter of the Inconel® 600 probe enclosing a type K thermocouple -NiCr/NiAl- with a diameter of 1.5 mm) complied with the specification for testing quenchants as established by the International Federation for the Heat Treatment of Materials (IFHT). The furnace thermostat controlled the power supplied to the furnace through diode rectification and was operated without a controlled atmosphere. The furnace temperature was adjusted to about 1625 °F (885 °C).<br>
In each run, the metal substrate was heated to a temperature of about 1571 °F (855 °C) to about 1600 °F (870 °C) and then immersed in 1.0 kilograms of one of the fifteen (15) aqueous quenching media described above which were maintained at a temperature of about 100 °F (40 °C). Data acquisition began when the test probe temperature of the aqueous quenching medium reached about 1562 °F (849 °C) and was acquired for about 60 seconds, i.e., until the temperature reached about 300 °F.<br>
After data collection, cooling curves were obtained using the data collected using<br>
the various polymer mixtures. Cooling times were determined from the cooling curves during which the test specimens were cooled from 1562 °F (849 °C) to less than 203 °F (95 °C).<br>
The data obtained is set forth in Table 1 below.<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed ) <br>
The data illustrate that varying the quenching medium significantly increased cooling time when compared to each component in the quench medium. The data also illustrate that the reduced concentration of the combined polymers in the quenching medium did not significantly affect the cooling time of the metal substrate as compared to the individual polymers.<br>
