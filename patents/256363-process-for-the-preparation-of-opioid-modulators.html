As used herein, unless otherwise noted, "alkyl" whether used alone or<br>
as part of a substituent group refers to straight and branched carbon chains<br>
having 1 to 8 carbon atoms or any number within this range. The term<br>
"alkoxy" refers to an -Oalkyl substituent group, wherein alkyl is as defined<br>
supra. Similarly, the terms "alkenyl" and "alkynyl" refer to straight and<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/099060	PCT/US2006/008450<br>
branched carbon chains having 2 to 8 carbon atoms or any number within this<br>
range, wherein an alkenyl chain has at least one double bond in the chain and<br>
an alkynyl chain has at least one triple bond in the chain. An alkyl and alkoxy<br>
chain may be substituted on a carbon atom. In substituent groups with multiple<br>
alkyl groups such as (C1-6alkyl)2amino- the C1-6alkyl groups of the dialkylamino<br>
may be the same or different.<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" refers to saturated or partially unsaturated,<br>
moncyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbon rings of from 3 to 14 carbon atom members.<br>
Examples of such rings include, and are not limited to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl,<br>
cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl and adamantyl. Alternatively, the cycloalkyl<br>
ring may be fused to a benzene ring (benzo fused cycloalkyl), a 5 or 6 membered<br>
heteroaryl ring (containing one of O, S or N and, optionally, one additional<br>
nitrogen) to form a heteroaryl fused cycloalkyl.<br>
The term "heterocyclyl" refers to a nonaromatic cyclic ring of 5 to 7<br>
members in which 1 to 2 members are nitrogen, or a nonaromatic cyclic ring of 5<br>
to 7 members in which zero, one or two members are nitrogen and up to two<br>
members are oxygen or sulfur; wherein, optionally, the ring contains zero to one<br>
unsaturated bonds, and, optionally, when the ring is of 6 or 7 members, it<br>
contains up to two unsaturated bonds. The term heterocyclyl includes 5 to 7<br>
membered monocycle wherein the heterocyclyl may be fused to a benzene ring<br>
(benzo fused heterocyclyl), a 5 or 6 membered heteroaryl ring (containing one of<br>

as above but absent the option of a further fused ring) or fused with the carbon of<br>
attachment of a cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or heterocyclyl ring to form a spiro moiety.<br>
For instant compounds of the invention, the carbon atom ring members that form<br>
the heterocyclyl ring are fully saturated. Other compounds of the invention may<br>
have a partially saturated heterocyclyl ring. The term heterocyclyl include a 5 to 7<br>
membered moncyclic ring bridged to form bicyclic rings. Such compounds are<br>
not considered to be fully aromatic and are not referred to as heteroaryl<br>
compounds. Examples of heterocyclyl groups include, and are not limited to,<br>
28<br><br>

2-imidazolinyI, imidazolidinyl, 2-pyrazolinyl, pyrazolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl,<br>
thiomorpholinyl and piperazinyl.<br>
The term "aryl" refers to an unsaturated, aromatic monocyclic ring of 6<br>
carbon members or to an unsaturated, aromatic polycyclic ring of from 10 to 14<br>
carbon members. Examples of such aryl rings include, and are not limited to,<br>
phenyl, naphthalenyl or anthracenyl. Preferred aryl groups for the practice of this<br>
invention are phenyl and naphthalenyl.<br>
The term "heteroaryl" refers to an aromatic ring of 5 or 6 members<br>
wherein the ring consists of carbon atoms and has at least one heteroatom<br>
member. Suitable heteroatoms include nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. In the case<br>
of 5 membered rings, the heteroaryl ring contains one member of nitrogen,<br>
oxygen or sulfur and, in addition, may contain up to three additional nitrogens.<br>
In the case of 6 membered rings, the heteroaryl ring may contain from one to<br>
three nitrogen atoms. For the case wherein the 6 membered ring has three<br>
nitrogens, at most two nitrogen atoms are adjacent. Optionally, the heteroaryl<br>
ring is fused to a benzene ring (benzo fused heteroaryl), a 5 or 6 membered<br>
heteroaryl ring (containing one of O, S or N and, optionally, one additional<br>
nitrogen), a 5 to 7 membered cycloalkyl ring or a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclo<br>
ring (as defined supra but absent the option of a further fused ring). Examples of<br>
heteroaryl groups include, and are not limited to, furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, oxazolyl,<br>
thiazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, isoxazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, triazolyl,<br>

group substituted with an aryl group (e.g., benzyloxy).<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2006/099060	PCT/US2006/008450<br>
The term "halogen" refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.<br>
Substituents that are substituted with multiple halogens are substituted in a<br>
manner that provides compounds, which are stable.<br>
Whenever the term "alkyl" or "aryl" or either of their prefix roots appear in<br>
a name of a substituent (e.g., arylalkyl, alkylamino) it shall be interpreted as<br>
including those limitations given above for "alkyl" and "aryl." Designated<br>
numbers of carbon atoms (e.g., C1-C6) shall refer independently to the number<br>
of carbon atoms in an alkyl moiety or to the alkyl portion of a larger substituent<br>
in which alkyl appears as its prefix root. For alkyl, and alkoxy substituents the<br>
designated number of carbon atoms includes all of the independent members<br>
included in the range specified individually and all the combination of ranges<br>
within in the range specified. For example C1-6 alkyl would include methyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl individually as well as sub-combinations<br>
thereof (e.g. C1-2, C1-3, C1-4, C1-5, C2-6, C3-6, C4-6, C5-6, C2-5, etc.).<br>
Where the compounds according to this invention have at least one<br>
chiral center, they may accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the<br>
compounds possess two or more chiral centers, they may additionally exist as<br>
diastereomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures<br>
thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist as<br>
polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention.<br>
In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e.,<br>
hydrates) or common organic solvents, and such solvates are also intended to<br>
be encompassed within the scope of this invention.<br>
An "independently" selected substituent refers to a group of<br>
substituents, wherein the substituents may be different. Therefore, designated<br>
numbers of carbon atoms (e.g. C1-8) shall refer independently to the number of<br>
carbon atoms in an alkyl or cycloalkyl moiety or to the alkyl portion of a larger<br>
substituent in which alkyl appears as its prefix root.<br>
