				<td>A COMPOSITION FOR USE IN THE LAUNDERING OR TREATMENT OF FABRICS, AND A PROCESS FOR MAKING THE COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for use in the laundering or treatment of fabrics. More specifically, the present invention relates to a laundry detergent composition capable of both cleaning and softening fabric during a laundering process. The present invention also relates to a process for making the above composition.<br>
Background<br>
Laundry detergent compositions that both clean and soften fabric during a laundering process are known and have been developed and sold by laundry detergent manufacturers for many years. Typically, these laundry detergent compositions comprise components that are capable of providing a fabric-softening benefit to the laundered fabric; such fabric-softening components include clays and silicones.<br>
The incorporation of clay into laundry detergent compositions to impart a fabric-softening benefit to the laundered fabric is described in the following references. A granular, built laundry detergent composition comprising a smectite clay that is capable of both cleaning and softening a fabric during a laundering process is described in US 4,062,647 (Storm, T. D., and Nirschl, J. P.; The Procter &amp; Gamble Company). A heavy duty fabric-softening detergent comprising bentonite clay agglomerates is described in GB 2 138 037 (Allen, E., Coutureau, M., and Dillarstone, A.; Colgate-Palmolive Company). Laundry detergents compositions containing fabric-softening clays of between 150 and 2,000 microns in size are described in US 4,885,101 (Tai, H. T.; Lever Brothers Company). The fabric-softening performance of clay-containing laundry detergent compositions is improved by the incorporation of a flocculating aid to the clay-containing laundry detergent composition. For example, a detergent composition comprising a smectite type clay and a polymeric clay-flocculating agent is described in EP 0 299 575 (Raemdonck, H., and Busch, A.; The Procter &amp; Gamble Company).<br>
The use of silicones to provide a fabric-softening benefit to laundered fabric during a laundering process is also known. US 4,585,563 (Busch, A., and Kosmas, S.; The Procter &amp; Gamble Company) describes that specific organo-functional polydialkylsiloxanes can advantageously be incorporated in granular detergents to provide remarkable benefits inclusive of through-the-wash softening and further textile handling improvements. US 5,277,968 (Canivenc, E.; Rhone-Poulenc Chemie) describes a process for the conditioning of textile substrates to allegedly impart a pleasant feel and good hydrophobicity thereto, comprising treating such textile substances with an effective conditioning amount of a specific polydiorganosiloxane.<br>
Detergent Manufacturers have attempted to incorporate both clay and silicone in the same laundry detergent composition. For example, siliconates were incorporated in clay-containing compositions to allegedly improve their dispensing performance. US 4,419, 250 (Allen, E., Dillarstone, R., and Reul, J. A.; Colgate-Palmolive Company) describes agglomerated bentonite particles that comprise a salt of a lower alkyl siliconic acid and/or a polymerization product(s) thereof. US 4,421, 657 (Allen, E., Dillarstone, R., and Reul, J. A.; Colgate-Palmolive Company) describes a particulate heavy-duty laundering and textile-softening composition comprising bentonite clay and a siliconate. US 4, 482,477 (Allen, E., Dillarstone, R., and Reul, J. A.; Colgate-Palmolive Company) describes a particulate built synthetic organic detergent composition which includes a dispensing assisting proportion of a siliconate and preferably bentonite as a fabric-softening agent. In another example, EP 0 163 352 (York, D. W.; The Procter &amp; Gamble Company) describes the incorporation of silicone into a clay-containing laundry detergent composition in an attempt to control the excessive suds that are generated by the clay-containing laundry detergent composition during the laundering process. EP 0 381 487 (Biggin, I. S., and Cartwright, P. S.; BP Chemicals Limited) describes an aqueous based liquid detergent formulation comprising clay that is pretreated with a barrier material such as a polysiloxane.<br>
Detergent manufacturers have also attempted to incorporate a silicone, clay and a flocculant in a laundry detergent composition. For example, a fabric treatment composition comprising substituted polysiloxanes, softening clay and a clay flocculant is<br>
described in WO92/07927 (Marteleur, C. A. A. V. J., and Convents, A. C.; The Procter &amp; Gamble Company).<br>
More recently, fabric care compositions comprising an organophilic clay and functionalised oil are described in US 6,656,901 B2 (Moorfield, D., and Whilton, N.; Unilever Home &amp; Personal Care USA division of Conopco, Inc.). WO02/092748 (Instone, T. et al; Unilever PLC) describes a granular composition comprising an intimate blend of a non-ionic surfactant and a water-insoluble liquid, which may a silicone, and a granular carrier material, which may be a clay. W003/055966 (Cocardo, D. M., et al; Hindustain Lever Limited) describes a fabric care composition comprising a solid carrier, which may be a clay, and an anti-wrinkle agent, which may be a silicone.<br>
However, despite all of the above attempts, whatever improved fabric-softening performance benefit detergent manufacturers have been able to achieve for a laundry detergent has come at the expense of its fabric-cleaning performance and also its processabiliry. Therefore, there is still a need to improve the fabric-softening performance of a laundry detergent composition without unduly negatively affecting its fabric-cleaning performance and processability.<br>
Summary<br>
The present invention overcomes the above mentioned problem by providing an auxiliary composition, for use in the laundering or treatment of fabrics, comprising an admix of (i) clay and (ii) silicone in an emulsified form.<br>

Preferred clays have a cationic exchange capacity of at least 70meq/100g. The cationic exchange capacity of clays can be measured using the method described in Grimshaw, The Chemistry and Physics of Clays, Interscience Publishers, Inc., pp. 264-265 (1971).<br>
Preferably, the clay has a weight average primary particle size, typically of greater than 20 micrometers, preferably more than 23 micrometers, preferably more than 25 micrometers, or preferably from 21 micrometers to 60 micrometers, more preferably from 22 micrometers to 50 micrometers, more preferably from 23 micrometers to 40<br>
micrometers, more preferably from 24 micrometers to 30 micrometers, more preferably from 25 micrometers to 28 micrometers. Clays having these preferred weight average primary particle sizes provide a further improved fabric-softening benefit. The method for determining the weight average particle size of the clay is described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
Method For Determining The Weight Average Primary Particle Size Of The Clay:<br>
The weight average primary particle size of the clay is typically determined using the following method: 12g clay is placed in a glass beaker containing 250ml distilled water and vigorously stirred for 5 minutes to form a clay solution. The clay is not sonicated, or microfluidised in a high pressure microfluidizer processor, but is added to said beaker of water in an unprocessed form (i.e. in its raw form). 1ml clay solution is added to the reservoir volume of an Accusizer 780 single-particle optical sizer (SPOS) using a micropipette. The clay solution that is added to the reservoir volume of said Accusizer 780 SPOS is diluted in more distilled water to form a diluted clay solution; this dilution occurs in the reservoir volume of said Accusizer 780 SPOS and is an automated process that is controlled by said Accusizer 780 SPOS, which determines the optimum concentration of said diluted clay solution for determining the weight average particle size of the clay particles in the diluted clay solution. The diluted clay solution is left in the reservoir volume of said Accusizer 780 SPOS for 3 minutes. The clay solution is vigorously stirred for the whole period of time that it is in the reservoir volume of said Accusizer 780 SPOS. The diluted clay solution is then sucked through the sensors of said Accusizer 780 SPOS; this is an automated process that is controlled by said Accusizer 780 SPOS, which determines the optimum flow rate of the diluted clay solution through the sensors for determining the weight average particle size of the clay particles in the diluted clay solution. All of the steps of this method are carried out at a temperature of 20°C. This method is carried out in triplicate and the mean of these results determined.<br>

GPC measurements are described in more detail in Polymer Analysis by Stuart, B. H., pl08-l 12, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, UK, © 2002. A typical GPC method for determining the weight average molecular weight of the charged polymeric fabric-softening boosting component is described below:<br>
Method For Determining The Weight Average Molecular Weight of the Charged Polymeric Fabric-Softening Boosting Component:<br>
1.	Dissolve 1.5g of polymer in 1 litre of deionised water.<br>

3.	According the manufacturer's instructions, inject 100 litres of the mixture obtained<br>
in step 2., on a GPC machine that is fitted with a Suprema MAX (8mm by 30cm)<br>
column operating at 35°C and a ERC7510 detector, with 0.2M aqueous solution of<br>
acetic acid and potassium chloride solution being used as an elution solvent at a<br>

The laundry detergent composition is preferably in particulate form, preferably in free-flowing particulate form, although the composition may be hi any liquid or solid form. The composition in solid form can be in the form of an agglomerate, granule, flake,<br>
extrudate, bar, tablet or any combination thereof. The solid composition can be made by methods such as dry-mixing, agglomerating, compaction, spray drying, pan-granulation, spheronization or any combination thereof. The solid composition preferably has a bulk density of from 300g/l to l,500g/l, preferably from 500g/l to l,000g/l.<br>
The composition may also be in the form of a liquid, gel, paste, dispersion, preferably a colloidal dispersion or any combination thereof. Liquid compositions typically have a viscosity of from SOOcps to 3,000cps, when measured at a shear rate of 20s"1 at ambient conditions (20°C and 1 atmosphere), and typically have a density of from 800g/l to 1300g/l. If tthe composition is in the form of a dispersion, then it will typically have a volume average particle size of from 1 micrometer to 5,000 micrometers, preferably from 1 micrometer to 50 micrometers. The particles that form the dispersion are usually the clay and, if present, the silicone. Typically, a Coulter Multisizer is used to measure the volume average particle size of a dispersion.<br>
The composition may in unit dose form, including not only tablets, but also unit dose pouches wherein the composition is at least partially enclosed, preferably completely enclosed, by a film such as a polyvinyl alcohol film.<br>
The composition is capable of both cleaning and softening fabric during a laundering process. Typically, the composition is formulated for use in an automatic washing machine, although it can also be formulated for hand-washing use.<br>
The following adjunct components and levels thereof, when incorporated into a laundry detergent composition of the present invention, further improve the fabric-softening performance and fabric-cleaning performance of the laundry detergrnt composition: at least 10% by weight of the composition of alkyl benzene sulphonate detersive surfactant; at least 0.5%, or at least 1%, or even at least 2% by weight of the composition of cationic quaternary ammonium detersive surfactant; at least 1% by weight of the composition alkoxylated alkyl sulphate detersive surfactant, preferably ethoxylated alkyl sulphate detersive surfactant; less than 12% or even less than 6%, or even 0%, by weight of the composition zeolite builder; and any combination thereof. Preferably the laundry detergent composition comprises at least 6%, or even at least 8%, or even at least 12%, or even at least 18%, by weight of the laundry detergent composition of the auxiliary composition. Preferably the composition comprises at least 0.3% by weight of<br>
the composition of a flocculating aid. The weight ratio of clay to flocculating aid in the laundry detergent composition is preferably in the range of from 10:1 to 200:1, preferably from 14:1 to 160:1 more preferably from 20:1 to 100:1 and more preferably from 50:1 to 80:1.<br>
Process<br>
The process for making the auxiliary composition comprises the steps of (i) contacting a silicone with water, and optionally an emulsifier, to form a silicone in an emulsified form; and (ii) thereafter contacting the silicone in an emulsified form with clay to form an admix of clay and a silicone.<br>
Preferably the silicone is in a liquid or liquefiable form when it is contacted to the clay in step (ii). Preferably the emulsion formed in step (i) is a water-in-oil emulsion with the silicone forming at least part of, and preferably all of, the continuous phase of the emulsion, and the water forms at least part of, and preferably all of, the discontinous phase of the emulsion.<br>
Preferably, a charged polymeric fabric-softening boosting component is contacted to the clay and silicone in step (ii). The intimate mixing of the charged polymeric fabric-softening boosting component with the clay and silicone further improves the fabric-softening performance of the resultant auxiliary composition.<br>
Step (i) may be carried out at ambient temperature (e.g. 20°C), but it may be preferred that step (i) is carried out at elevated temperature such as a temperature in the range of from 30°C to 60°C. If an emulsifier is used in the process, then preferably the emulsifier is contacted to water to form an emulsifier-water mixture, thereafter the emulsifier-water mixture is contacted to the silicone. For continuous processes, step (i) is typically carried out in an in-line static mixer or an in-line dynamic (shear) mixer. For non-continuous processes, step (i) is typically carried out in a batch mixer such as a Z-blade mixer, anchor mixer or a paddle mixer.<br>
The admix of clay and silicone is preferably subsequently agglomerated in a high-sheer mixer. Suitable high-sheer mixers include CB Loedige mixers, Schugi mixers, Littleford mixers, Drais mixers and lab scale mixers such as Braun mixers. Preferably the high-sheer mixer is a pin mixer such as a CB Loedige mixer or Littleford mixer or Drais<br>
mixer. The high-sheer mixers are typically operated at high speed, preferably having a tip speed of from 30ms"1 to 35ms"1. Preferably water is added to the high-sheer mixer.<br>
The admix of clay and silicone are typically subsequently subjected to a conditioning step in a low-shear mixer. Suitable low-shear mixers include Ploughshear mixers such as a Loedige KM. Preferably the low-shear mixer has a tip speed of from 5ms"1 to 10ms"1. Optionally, fine particles such as zeolite and/or clay particles, typically having an average particle size of from 1 micrometer to 40 micrometers or even from 1 micrometer to 10 micrometers are introduced into the low-shear mixer. This dusting step improves the flowability of the resultant particles by reducing their stickiness and controlling their growth.<br>
The admix of clay and silicone is typically subjected to a sizing step, wherein particles having a particle size of greater than 500mm are removed from the admix. Typically, these large particles are removed from the admix by sieving.<br>
The admix of clay and silicone is preferably subjected to hot air having a temperature of greater than 50°C or even greater than 100°C. Typically, the admix of clay and silicone is dried at an elevated temperature (e.g. a temperature of greater than 50°C or even greater than 100°C); preferably, the admix is dried in a low-shear apparatus such as fluid bed drier. Following this preferred drying step, the admix of clay and silicone is preferably thereafter subjected to cold air having a temperature of less than 15°C, preferably from 1°C to 10°C. This cooling step is preferably carried out in a fluid bed cooler.<br>
The admix of clay and silicone is preferably subjected to a second sizing step, wherein particles having a particle size of less than 250 micrometers are removed from the admix. These small particles are removed from the admix by sieving and/or elutriation. If elutriation is used, then preferably the second sizing step is carried out in a fluid bed such as the fluid bed dryer and/or cooler, if used in the process.<br>
The admix of clay and silicone is preferably subjected to a third sizing step, wherein particles having a particle size of greater than 1,400 micrometers are removed from the admix. These large particles are removed from the admix by sieving.<br>
The large particles that are optionally removed from the admix during the first and/or third sizing steps are typically recycled back to the high sheer mixer and/or to the<br>
fluid bed dryer or cooler, if used in the process. Optionally, these large particles are subjected to a grinding step prior to their introduction to the high sheer mixer and/or fluid bed dryer or cooler. The small particles that are optionally removed from the admix during the second sizing step are typically recycled back to the high sheer mixer and/or low shear mixer, if used in the process.<br>
