COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10, rule 13)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
“SUBSTITUTED PIPERAZINYL PYRAZINES AND PYRIDINES AS 5-HT7 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS”<br><br><br><br><br><br>
ELI LILLY AND COMPANY, a corporation of the State of Indiana, United States of America, having a principal place of business at Lilly Corporate Center, City of Indianapolis, State of Indiana 46285, United States of America<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed. <br><br>
SUBSTITUTED PIPERAZINYL PYRAZINES AND PYRIDINES AS 5-HT7 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS<br><br>
	The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has a rich pharmacology arising from a heterogeneous population of at least 14 distinct receptors.  Each receptor has a distinct, though often overlapping distribution throughout the body and a unique serotonin binding site leading to different affinities for serotonin and different physiological responses to interaction with serotonin.  The 5-HT7 receptor has been shown to have important functional roles in thermoregulation, circadian rhythm, learning and memory, hippocampal signaling, and sleep.  The 5-HT7 receptor has also been linked to various neurological disorders including migraine and anxiety, as well as to persistent pain, more specifically inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain.  <br>
High affinity 5-HT7 receptor antagonists would provide useful therapeutics for the treatment of the above mentioned 5-HT7 receptor-associated disorders including migraine, and persistent pain, particularly, inflammatory and neuropathic pain.  High affinity 5-HT7 receptor antagonists that are also selective for the 5-HT7 receptor, would provide such therapeutic benefit without the undesirable adverse events associated with modulation of the other serotonergic receptor subclasses, such as 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D.  Achieving selectivity for the 5-HT7 receptor has proven difficult in designing 5 HT7 antagonists.  5-HT1A receptor agonists have been associated with serotonin syndrome.  5 HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor agonists have been associated with adverse events such as chest pain.  <br>
Leopoldo, M. (2004) Serotonin(7) receptors (5-HT(7)Rs) and their ligands.  Curr. Med. Chem. 11, 629-661, describes various prior approaches to obtaining 5-HT7 receptor ligands.  WO 2004/067703 discloses certain compounds as 5-HT7 antagonists, some of which are 2-(4-alkyl-piperazin-1-yl)-3-(4-heteroaryl-phenyl)-pyridine compounds.<br>
The present invention provides novel potent 5-HT7 receptor antagonists.  Certain compounds of the present invention are selective for the 5-HT7 receptor compared with other serotonin receptors.<br>

The general chemical terms used throughout have their usual meanings.  For example, the term “amino protecting group” as used in this specification refers to a substituent commonly employed to block or protect an amino functionality while reacting other functional groups on the compound.  The species of amino protecting group employed is not critical so long as the derivatized amino group is stable to the conditions of subsequent reactions on other positions of the molecule and can be removed at the appropriate point without disrupting the remainder of the molecule.  The selection and use (addition and subsequent removal) of amino protecting groups is well known within the ordinary skill of the art.  Further examples of groups referred to by the above terms are described by T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, 3rd edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY, 1999, chapter 7, hereafter referred to as “Greene”.<br>
	The term "pharmaceutical" or “pharmaceutically acceptable” when used herein as an adjective, means substantially non-toxic and substantially non-deleterious to the recipient. <br>
	By "pharmaceutical composition" it is further meant that the carrier, solvent, excipients and/or salt must be compatible with the active ingredient of the composition (e.g. a compound of Formula I).  It is understood by those of ordinary skill in this art that the terms “pharmaceutical formulation” and “pharmaceutical composition” are generally interchangeable, and they are so used for the purposes of this application.<br>
The term "effective amount" means an amount of a compound of Formula I which is capable of antagonizing 5-HT7 receptors and/or eliciting a given pharmacological effect.  <br>
	The term “suitable solvent” refers to any solvent, or mixture of solvents that sufficiently solubilizes the reactants to afford a medium within which to effect the desired reaction and that does not interfere with the desired reaction.<br>
It is generally understood by those skilled in this art, that compounds intended for use in pharmaceutical compositions are routinely, though not necessarily, converted to a salt form in efforts to optimize such characteristics as the handling properties, stability, pharmacokinetic, and/or bioavailability, etc.  Methods for converting a compound to a given salt form are well known in the art (see, e.g., P. Stahl, et al., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use, (VCHA/Wiley-VCH, 2002); Berge, S.M, Bighley, L.D., and Monkhouse, D.C., J. Pharm. Sci., 66:1, (1977)).  In that the compounds of the present invention are amines and therefore basic in nature, they readily react with a wide variety of pharmaceutically acceptable organic and inorganic acids to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts therewith.  Such salts are also embodiments of this invention.  <br>
It is well known that such compounds can form salts in various molar ratios with the acid to provide, for example, the hemi-acid, mono-acid, di-acid salt, etc.  Where in the salt formation procedure, the acid is added in a specific stoichiometric ratio, unless otherwise analyzed to confirm, the salt is presumed, but not known, to form in that molar ratio.  <br>
Abbreviations used herein are defined as follows:<br>
“Brine” means a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution.<br>
“EtOAc” means ethylacetate.<br>
“LC MS(ES)” means liquid chromatography followed by mass spectroscopy using electrospray ionization.<br>
“MS (ES)” means mass spectroscopy using electrospray ionization.<br>
“Morpholine, polymer-bound” means morpholine N-linked to a polymer such as polystyrene for use as a catalyst, as for example Aldrich product number 49,381-3: Morpholine, polymer-bound, 1% cross-linked, 200-400 mesh.<br>
“SCX chromatography” means chromatography on a SCX column or cartridge.<br>
“SCX column” or “SCX cartridge”, as used herein, refers to a Varian Bond Elute® silica based strong cation exchange resin column or disposable cartridge or equivalent (as for example a SCX-2 cartridge).<br>
While all of the compounds of the present invention are useful as 5-HT7 antagonists, certain classes are preferred, as for example, compounds having any of the following enumerated selections of substituents:  <br>
1)	R1 is selected from the group consisting of phenyl optionally substituted with methoxy or 1 to 3 independently selected fluoro or chloro substituents; pyrazol-4-yl optionally substituted with 1 or 2 independently selected methyl or ethyl substituents; and imidazolyl optionally substituted with 1 or 2 methyl groups;<br>

As such, for any given selection of a preferred substituent R1-3 above, further preferred compounds are those having the first selected preferred substituent and also having a preferred selection for one or more of the other substituents R1-3 above.  As examples of such preferred combinations, but not to be construed as limiting, the following combinations of preferred selections are preferred combinations:<br>

Specific preferred compounds of the present invention are those described in the Examples herein, including the free bases and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.  Of the exemplified compounds, one particularly preferred compound is 1-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-sulfonic acid {2-[3'-(4-methoxymethyl-phenyl)-2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-[1,2']bipyrazinyl-4-yl]-ethyl}-methyl-amide and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.  <br>
General Schemes<br>
	The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the following synthetic schemes by methods well known and appreciated in the art.  Suitable reaction conditions for the steps of these schemes are well known in the art and appropriate substitutions of solvents and co-reagents are within the skill of the art.  Likewise, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that synthetic intermediates may be isolated and/or purified by various well known techniques as needed or desired, and that frequently, it will be possible to use various intermediates directly in subsequent synthetic steps with little or no purification.  Furthermore, the skilled artisan will appreciate that in some circumstances, the order in which moieties are introduced is not critical.  The particular order of steps required to produce the compounds of Formula I is dependent upon the particular compound being synthesized, the starting compound, and the relative lability of the substituted moieties, as is well appreciated by the skilled chemist.  All substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined, and all reagents are well known and appreciated in the art.  <br>
Scheme I below, shows one suitable synthetic sequence for preparing pyrazine compounds of the present invention.  In this scheme, 2,3-dichloropyrazine (1) is nucleophilically substituted with mono-N-protected piperazine to provide piperazinopyrazine (2).  Deprotection and a reductive amination reaction between (3) and aldehyde (4) [the synthesis of (4) is outlined in Scheme II] provides the Boc-protected amine (5).  Deprotection followed by acylation with suitably substituted aryl or heteroaryl sulfonyl chloride acylating agents provide intermediate (7).  Finally a Suzuki reaction using an appropriately substituted or unsubstituted phenyl boronic acid (8) in the presence of a suitable palladium catalysis provides the desired products (9).  <br>
Scheme I<br><br><br>
Although phenyl boronic acid (8) is used in the above illustration (Scheme I) it will be appreciated that other reagents could be used to provide the products (9) (e.g. phenyl stannanes, phenyl zincates, or phenyl Grignards with an appropriate catalyst).  Similarly a variety of N-protecting groups may be used, together with appropriate deprotection methods, as is readily appreciated in the art.  Exemplary protecting groups include, but are not limited to Boc, acetyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl or ethoxycarbonyl.   The skilled chemist will also appreciate that the above reactions are amenable to a variety of solvents and reaction conditions and that optimal conditions will depend on the particular compound being synthesized.<br>
The order of the coupling steps in Scheme I may be altered if desired, as for example as described in Scheme II.  Thus the N-protected piperazine (2) may be coupled first with the boronic acids (etc) to yield (12). This may then be deprotected and subjected to reductive amination with (4), followed finally with the deprotection and acylation to afford the required products (9), as above.<br><br>
Scheme II<br><br>
The corresponding compounds wherein R2 is hydrogen may be prepared as described in Scheme III.  Thus, the deprotected amines (13) are alkylated with N-bromoalkyl phthalimides (16).  Subsequent treatment with hydrazine removal affords the free amines (17), which are then acylated with the desired acylating agents to afford the desired products (18). <br><br>
Scheme III<br><br>
In a similar fashion, the corresponding pyridyl target molecules (25) can be synthesized according to the procedure described in Scheme IV.  Thus, 2-chloro-3-iodo-pyridine (19) is coupled with a mono-N-protected piperazine in the presence of a suitable palladium catalyst to provide the corresponding N-protected 2 chloro-3-piperazinopyridine (20). This is followed by deprotection to (21) and reductive amination reaction with aldehyde (4) to afford the protected amine (22).  Deprotection to amine (23) and acylation with the appropriate sulfonylchloride provides sulphonamides (24).  Finally, Suzuki coupling with the appropriately substituted phenyl boronic acid (8) yields the desired pyridyl products (25).<br>
Scheme IV <br><br>
Although a phenyl boronic acid (8) is used in the above illustration, it will be appreciated that other phenylating reagents may also be used (e.g. phenyl stannanes, phenyl zincates, or phenyl Grignards with appropriate catalysis).  <br>
Further, compounds wherein R3 is  may be prepared according to Scheme V. <br>
Scheme V<br><br>
Thus the product of Suzuki reaction between (7) or (24) with 4-hydroxymethyl-boronic acid yields the products (26: X = N or C, respectively). Subsequent mesylation and SN2 displacement with suitable nucleophiles yields the target molecules (28: X= N or C, respectively).<br>
The following Preparations and Examples are illustrative of methods useful for the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention.  The names for many of the compounds illustrated in the preparations and examples are provided from structures drawn with ChemDraw®, version 7.0 software or Autonom 2000 for ISIS/Draw.<br><br>

Treat a solution of  1-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-sulfonic acid (2,2-dimethoxy-ethyl)-methyl-amide (12.16 g, 46.18 mmol) in CH2Cl2 with 1.0 M HCl (50 mL).  Stir the resulting mixture at reflux for 1 hr., then treat with 5.0 M HCl (50 mL) and further reflux for 2 hr.  Cool the reaction to room temperature, extract with EtOAc and CH2Cl2.  Combine the organics, dry over Na2SO4, filter and concentrate to provide the title intermediate as an oil (8.96 g, 89.3%).<br>
Alternatively, 1-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-sulfonic acid (2,2-dimethoxy-ethyl)-methyl-amide (1.0 equivalents) is suspended in toluene (5 volumes) and water (0.5 volumes) and trifluoroacetic acid is added keeping the temperature below 25°C.  The resulting solution is allowed to stir for at least 8 hours below 25°C and sampled for reaction completion.  Once the reaction is deemed complete the solution is concentrated to an oil.  The resulting oil is dissolved in brine (7.5 volumes) and water (2.5 volumes).  Potassium carbonate is added portion wise to keep the temperature below 25°C until a pH of 7.5 is achieved.  The reaction is then washed with methylene chloride (3 x 10 volumes) and the combined organic layers are dried with sodium sulfate (200 wt%).  The slurry is then filtered and the cake washed with methylene chloride (2 x 3 volumes).  The resulting filtrate is held under vacuum for &gt; 24 hr., to concentrate the title preparation to a viscous amber oil (92% yield).<br><br><br>

	The 5-HT7 receptor antagonists of the present invention are relatively selective for the 5-HT7 receptor.  The compounds of the present invention are particularly relatively selective for the 5-HT7 receptor in comparison to other 5-HT receptor subtypes and specifically the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors.  This selectivity is demonstrated in the following receptor binding assays and receptor antagonist activity assays.<br><br>
Membrane Preparation: 	<br>
Membranes for affinity and antagonist activity assays are prepared essentially as follows.  AV-12 cells, stably expressing the 5-HT7 receptor, are grown as a monolayer in 5 x T-150 flasks in DMEM/F12 (3:1) 5% FBS, 20 mM HEPES, 400 mg/mL geneticin, 50mg/mL tobramycin.  After growing to 90% confluence the media is removed and replaced with Hybritech media (a low calcium version of DMEM/F12 media having 11 mg/L calcium) containing 2% horse serum, 100 mg/mL dextran sulfate, 1mg/mL nucellin, 1mg/mL human transferrin (partially iron saturated), 50 mg/mL tobramycin, 20 mM HEPES, 100mg/mL geneticin, 0.04% pluronic F68.  The cells are grown overnight to condition the media.  The next morning the conditioned media (~150 mL total) is removed and set aside in a sterile container.  The cells are trypsinized and collected in the conditioned media.  Fresh suspension media is added to bring the total volume to 500 mL and a cell density of 5 x 105cells/mL.  The suspension culture volume is repeatedly increased over the next 3 weeks to the desired volume and density until harvest (approx. 3.5 - 4.0 x106 cells per mL targeted cell density).  Cells are harvested by centrifugation at 1,500g at 4 °C for 30 min.  The supernatant is decanted and the cell pellets are resuspended in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS).  The cell suspension is aliquoted into 50 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 1,500g at 4 °C for 15 min.  The supernatant is removed, the pellets are weighed, and then frozen on dry ice. <br>
To prepare membranes, the above pellets are resuspended in ice-cold Tris buffer (20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4 at 23 °C, 5 mM EDTA) and homogenized with a Wheaton tissue grinder.  The lysate is subsequently centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 min. at 4 °C to pellet large fragments which are discarded.  The supernatant is collected and centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 60 min. at 4 °C.  The resulting pellet is resuspended in a final buffer containing 50 mM Tris HCl and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4.  Membrane preparations are snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at -80oC.  Protein concentrations are determined by the method of Bradford. Anal. Biochem., 72:248-254, 1976.<br>
For cAMP functional assays, the 5-HT7-expressing cells from above are grown in 150 cm2 flasks and processed essentially as follows.  The media is aspirated from the flasks and cells are washed with 1 mL PBS.  The cells are released from monolayer with enzyme free cell dissociation solution (Specialtymedia CAT#S-004-B, www.Chemicon.com) and resuspended in complete media.  A sample of the cells is counted and the remainder is centrifuged as above for 3 min.  The resulting cell pellet is resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells per mL and used directly in the cAMP assay as described.<br><br>
5-HT7 receptor affinity: Radioligand binding assay:	<br>
[3H] 5-HT binding is performed using modifications of the assay conditions reported by Kahl et al.(J. Biomol. Screen, 2: 33-40 (1997), essentially as follows.  Radioligand binding assays are conducted in 96-well microtiter plates, in a total volume of 125 ?l containing the following reaction buffer: 50 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10 mM pargyline, 0.1% ascorbate, pH 7.4 at room temperature.  Competition binding is conducted using eleven test compound concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 nM, in the presence of 1 nM [3H]5-HT.  Unlabeled 5-HT (10 ?M) is used to define nonspecific binding.  The binding reaction is initiated by addition of 0.15 ?g of membrane homogenate (2.31 ng/?L, 65 ?L per well) and 0.5 mg of scintillation proximity assay fluoromicrospheres.  The reactions are incubated at room temperature for 3 hr. and then counted in a Trilux Microbeta™ scintillation counter to detect receptor-bound radioligand.  Binding data is analyzed by computer-assisted 4 parameter fit analysis (ID Business Solutions Ltd, Guildford, Surrey, UK).  IC50 values are converted to Ki values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.  Biochem. Pharmacol., 22:3099-3108 (1973).  <br>
Exemplified compounds are tested essentially as described and found to have Ki values 
	Affinity for other serotonin receptor subtypes as well as for alpha 1 &amp; 2 adrenergic receptors can readily be determined by modification of the above described radioligand receptor binding assay using membranes derived from cells stably expressing the desired receptor subtype including the 5 HT1A, 5 HT1B ,and 5 HT1D subtypes, as well as the 5 HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5 HT4, 5 HT5, and 5 HT6 receptor subtypes.  The selectivity ratio of Ki-x / Ki-5HT7 , where Ki-x is the Ki for the receptor being compared, is indicative of the relative affinity of a compound for the 5-HT7 receptor.  Exemplified compounds are tested and found to have selectivity ratios against other serotonergic receptors of &gt; 9 and against andronergic receptors of &gt; 9.  The compounds of Examples 17 and 25 are tested essentially as described and are found to have the following selectivity profiles: <br>

Functional antagonist assay:  Measurement of cAMP formation:	<br>
The 5-HT7 receptor is functionally coupled to a G-protein as measured by the ability of serotonin and serotonergic drugs to stimulate cAMP production in CHO cells transfected with the 5-HT7 receptor.  (Ruat, et al., Proceedings  of the National Academy of Sciences (USA), 90:8547-8551, 1993.)  Accordingly, functional receptor activity can be measured by measuring adenylate cyclase activity using a commercially available cell-based, homogeneous, time resolved fluorescence assay kit, as for example the kit produced by Cisbio-US, Inc. (Bedford, MA).  Essentially, and using the protocol and reagents provided by the manufacturer, approximately 20,000 human 5-HT7 receptor-expressing AV-12 cells (as described above) are used with test compound dose concentrations in the range described for the binding assay.  EC-90 dose-response curves for 5-HT are measured in parallel to demonstrate competitive antagonism.  A cAMP standard curve is also run in every experiment.  After the assay plates are read in an Envision™ instrument (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley MA), the data are normalized to the standard curve and converted to percent inhibition for data analysis as described above for the receptor binding assay results.  The Kb (nM) is calculated as a measure of the antagonist potency of the compound.  Preferred compounds are those having percent inhibition &gt; 75%.  Still other preferred compounds are those having Kb

Animal Model of Dural Plasma Protein Extravasation (PPE).<br>
The dural plasma protein extravasation model is an established model for migraine.  The ability of a test compound to reduce extravasation of plasma proteins into the dura under assay conditions is considered indicative of the compound’s ability to reduce or prevent the dural inflammation thought to be symptomatic of migraine.  (see Johnson, K.W., et al., Neuroreport, 8 (1997) 2237-2240.)<br>
To assay compounds for their ability to reduce or prevent dural plasma protein extravasation, male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) are anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments) with the incisor bar set at -2.5 mm.  Following a midline sagital scalp incision, 2 pairs of bilateral holes are drilled through the skull (3.2 mm posterially, 1.8 and 3.8 mm laterally, all coordinates referenced to bregma).  Pairs of stainless steel stimulating electrodes, insulated except at the tips (Rhodes Medical Systems, Inc.), are lowered through the holes in both hemispheres to a depth of 9.2 mm.<br>
Test compound is administered intravenously (i.v.) to the femoral vein at a dosing volume of 1 mL/kg.  Approximately 8 min. post injection, the animals are dosed with Fluorescein isothiocyanate–bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) (20 mg/kg, i.v.).  The FITC-BSA functions as a marker for protein extravasation.  Ten min. post-injection of the test compound, the left trigeminal ganglion is electrically stimulated for 5 min. at a current intensity of 1.0 mA (5 Hz, 5 msec pulse every 200 msec) with a Model S48 Grass Instrument Stimulator with PSIU6 photoelectric isolation unit (Grass-Telefactor).<br>
Alternatively, rats fasted overnight are dosed orally with test compound via gavage at a volume of 2 mL/kg.  Approximately 50 min. post dosing, the animals are anesthetized and placed in the stereotaxic frame as described above.  The animals are dosed with FITC-BSA (20 mg/kg, i.v.) at 58 min. post-p.o. dosing.  Sixty min. post compound dosing, the animals are electrically stimulated as described above.<br>
Five minutes following the termination of stimulation, the animals are killed by exsanguination with 40 mL of saline.  The top of the skull is removed and the dural membrane samples are removed from both hemispheres, rinsed with water, and spread flat on microscopic slides.  Once dried, the tissues are coverslipped with a 70% glycerol/water solution.<br>
The amount of FITC-BSA for each sample is quantified with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a grating monochromator, a spectrophotometer, and a computer driven stage.  Fluorescence measurements are taken at 25 points in a 5x5 grid in 500 ?m steps on each dural sample with an excitation wavelength of approximately 490 nm and emission intensity measured at approximately 535 nm.  The mean and standard deviation of the 25 measurements are determined.<br>
The extravasation induced by the electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion is an ipsilateral effect (i.e. occurs only on the side of the dura in which the trigeminal ganglion was stimulated).  This allows the use of the other (unstimulated) half of the dura as a control.  The ratio of the amount of extravasation in the dura from the stimulated side, over the amount of extravasation in the unstimulated side, is calculated.  Control animals dosed only with saline, yield a ratio of approximately 2.0.  In contrast, a compound which effectively prevented the extravasation in the dura from the stimulated side would yield a ratio of approximately 1.0.<br>
Preferred compounds are those that effectively prevent extravasation.  The compound of Example 25 is assayed essentially as described and is found to have an ID100 of 1 mg/Kg, providing a ratio of about 1.1.  <br>
	While it is possible to administer compounds employed in the methods of this invention directly without any formulation, the compounds are usually administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as an active ingredient and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent and/or excipient.  These compositions can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, intranasal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and pulmonary.  Such pharmaceutical compositions and processes for preparing them are well known in the art. See, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, ed., 21st ed., Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins Co., 2005).<br>
	The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 0.1 to about 200 mg, more usually about 1.0 to about 30 mg, of the active ingredient.  The term "unit dosage form" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with at least one suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent and/or excipient.<br>
	The compounds are generally effective over a wide dosage range.  For example, dosages per day will normally fall within the range of about 0.01 to about 30 mg/kg, as for example within the range of about 0.1 to about 15 mg/kg/day, in single or divided dose.  However, it will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound or compounds administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms, and therefore the above dosage ranges are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.  In some instances dosage levels below the above lower limit may be adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be used. <br>
The type of formulation employed for the administration of the compounds employed in the methods of the present invention may be dictated by the particular compound employed, the type of pharmacokinetic profile desired from the selected route of administration, and the state of the patient. <br>
