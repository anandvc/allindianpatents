HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan   Lever  House,     165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>

METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CHARACTERIZING TACTILE PERCEPTION<br>
Field of the Invention <br>
5<br>
     The invention concerns a method and system for characterizing   <br>
     tactile perception on skin using acoustic emission, as well as   <br>
     methods of using the system for demonstrating proof of efficacy  <br>
     and/or facilitating cosmetic product selection.<br>
10<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The ultimate goal of any cosmetic product or method, is a satisfied consumer.  Many cosmetic products, either leave-on<br>
15 and/or wash off products, advertise a variety of skin benefits. While expert graders may be trained to use diagnostic equipment or to perceive the difference, consumers usually cannot easily discern whether the claimed benefit is actually delivered, or a quantitative extent to which it is delivered. Skin conditions are<br>
20 typically evaluated subjectively through the senses, particularly through sight and touch. An objective measure of the physical parameters controlling the key attributes would provide a useful tool in the characterization of sensory attributes.<br>
25 Amongr skin diagnostic techniques, acoustic emission has not been commonly used for skin characterization. Acoustic emission has been commonly used in the field of mechanical systems and musical instruments. It has also been used in the field of fabric sensory, since for consumers, the sound of fabrics is part of the<br>
30  sensory experience.<br>

ACOUSTIC EMISSION SYSTEM<br>
25 	With reference to FIG. 1, a schematic diagram of an acoustic emission system 10 according to the present invention is shown. Acoustic emission system 10 includes probe (s) 12 that operate in an acoustic medium to pick up a signal from sound or vibration generated by a substrate (not shown), such as biological tissues,<br>
30 	skin tissues, or hard surfaces. Probe(s) 12 are in communication with a signal conditioning and amplifying system 14, connected to a data acquisition system 16, which, in turn, is connected to a result storage, manipulation, and output system 18.  A power<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCT/EP2004/0127S1<br>
-   8   -<br>
source (not shown) is also provided for powering system components. Each of the individual components may be commercially available or custom built, and any of the components 14, 16, 18 may be combined or eliminated, such as, for example if  analog signal is stored in that form, or if recording is directly to a tape recorder or CD or DVD.<br>
Acoustic medium<br>
10  The acoustic medium may be gas or liquid.   Generally, in practice, the acoustic medium is air, water, or aqueous solution.<br>
Acoustic probe(s)<br>
15  System 10 has at least one acoustic sensor, or probe 12. Probe 12 may comprise at least one microphone 20, for gaseous medium, or at least one hydrophone 22, for aqueous medium. Microphone 20 and/or hydrophone 22 may be used individually, in combination with each other, and/or in combination with a vibration sensor,<br>
20  or accelerometer 24. One or more accelerometers 24 may be used individually, in combination with each other, or in combination with at least one microphone 20 and/or hydrophone 22.<br>
Signal Conditioning System<br>
25<br>
Signal conditioning system 14 is in communication with probe (s) 12 and may be comprised of at least one amplifier 26, 28 to amplify sound received by microphone 20 and/or hydrophone 22. A signal conditioner 30 is provided to manipulate signal received<br>
30  from accelerometer 24.<br>
Data acquisition system<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCT/EP2004/012751<br>
-   9  -<br>
The data received by any one or more of amplifiers 26, 28 and/or accelerometer 24 is transferred to data acquisition system 16. In the alternative, data may be transferred to data acquisition system 16 directly from probe (s) 12. <br>
5<br>
Result storage, manipulation and output system<br>
Data from data acquisition system 16 is transferred to result storage, manipulation and output system 18. In alternative  embodiments, result storage, manipulation and output system 18 may receive data directly from probe (s) 12 and/or signal conditioning system 14.<br>
System 18 may be a personal computer or similar digital data 15  storage medium, such as a hand-held device (e.g. personal digital <br>
assistant [e.g., Palm Pilot™], cellular phone), magnetic tape,  <br>
CD, or DVD.  At this point, the data may be represented in <br>
graphical form and printed, in a variety of communication media. <br>
Communication media may include the Internet, camera, personal 20  digital assistant (e.g. Palm Pilot™), mobile phone; mobile  <br>
camera phone, advertising and promotional material, including <br>
television, magazines, brochures, posters, flyers, and hand-outs;  <br>
and/or water-insoluble substrate.  Additionally,  correlations <br>
between skin condition as data received qualitatively from <br>
25	consumers and data received from acoustic emission system 10 may <br>
    be made and/or may reside within the result storage, manipulation   <br>
    and output system 18.<br>
System 10 and method can be used to support	claims about various<br>
30  benefits from skin care products,  such	as moisturization,<br>
rinsability of cleansers and a wide range	of sensory benefits<br>
(i.e smoothness, silkiness) .<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCT/EP2004/012751<br>

ACOUSTIC EMISSION METHOD<br>
The inventive method uses acoustic signals generated from contact with a substrate, preferably skin, when the skin on one area of  the human body slides on the skin of another area of the body, i.e., skin on skin. The frictional forces in the skin/skin contact generate vibration patterns that are sensed by probe (s) 12 placed near the skin/skin contact area and recorded by result storage, manipulation, and output system 18.  Advantageously,<br>
10 probe (s) 12 do not affect the contact between one area of skin and another area of skin, since it can detect vibrations near the contact area without interfering with the contact. Therefore according to the present invention, the acoustic signal reflects accurately the skin/skin contact properties and the in-use<br>
15  conditions.<br>
Acoustic emission is recorded during the gentle rub of the hand or finger on another skin part. It is typically detected on the forearm, the hand or the face, but could also be used for other<br>
20  body parts. The acoustic emission signals can be recorded by several kinds of probe (s) 12. Microphones 20 or hydrophones 22 can be mounted close to the skin/skin contact, but do not touch the skin. For these acoustic sensors, air or water, respectively, is the medium, or the vehicle, of the vibration produced on the<br>
25 skin. Small or miniature vibration sensors (i.e. accelerometers 24) can be mounted to the skin, near the area of contact. In that case, the vibrations generated by the rubbing are transmitted by the skin tissues. Acoustic sensors may be commercially available devices or custom made devices. The acoustic emission signal is<br>
30  conditioned and/or amplified, by amplifiers 26, 28 and/or signal conditioner 30, respectively, and sent to data acquisition system 16. Data from data acquisition system 16 is then sent to storage, manipulation, and output system 18, such as a PC sound card or<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCT/EP2004/012751<br>
-   11   -<br>
other appropriate digitizing device where sound emission data may be saved and displayed. Various standard signal analysis methods can be applied to the signal,  and custom methods may be developed. <br>
5<br>
In typical use, the hand rubs the forearm in a regular manner or the two fingers are rubbed on each other. Since the acoustic emission depends on the speed of the rubbing and the pressure at the skin/skin contact, several recordings are performed for a<br>
10  given subject in order to define a control vibration pattern. The root mean square of the signal recorded over a given period, of time can be used to assess the consistency of the rubbing process. The acoustic emission signals are then monitored during the application of products or at intermittent intervals after<br>
15  application of a product.<br>
Signal Analysis<br>
Applicants have found that the amplitude of the vibrations and 20   the frequency content of the acoustic signal, or waves, monitored  <br>
as a function of time are very sensitive to the change of the  <br>
skin/skin contact properties associated with the use of products. <br>
The signal wave can be associated with, or correlated with, <br>
particular sensory properties.  For example, analysis of these 25   signals allows to characterize the rinsability and "feel" or <br>
tactile perception of skin cleansers, the tactile feel after use <br>
of cleansers, and the tactile feel resulting from the application <br>
of cosmetic creams.  Acoustic signal wave analysis can also be <br>
used to detect the deposition of moisturizing agents from 30  <br>
cosmetic products and cleansers.<br><br>

A cosmetic product system is also provided according to the present invention, including a cosmetic composition associated   with acoustic emission system 10.<br>
One aspect of the present invention provides a cosmetic product system wherein a cosmetic composition is packaged with an acoustic emission system 10 in whole or in part, such as with a<br>
10 typical acoustic graph. A variety of packaging arrangements are envisioned. An acoustic graph may be incorporated as a panel segment of a carton, the latter protectively surrounding the cosmetic composition. In a variation thereof, the graph may be detachably joined to the package through a perforated or weakened<br>
15   construction line, or through an adhesive joinder. In another  <br>
     embodiment, the exterior or interior of the package may be  <br>
     imprinted with instructions for a consumer to sample the product <br>
     with acoustic emission system 10 located at the point of   <br>
     purchase. <br>

METHODS OF USE<br>
20  The system and method can be used by the consumer directly, but is preferably applied by a beautician or other professional adviser.<br>
       Specifically, the system may be used for determining the <br>
25  condition of facial skin pre- and post-treatment, or to track  <br>
    changes in facial attributes, associated with a variety of  <br>
    factors, such as effects of food, activity, menstrual cycle. Pre-<br>
     treatment acoustic emission system measurements may be used in   <br>
     selecting an appropriate cosmetic product. For example, <br>
30  different product formulations may be recommended depending on <br>
    the individual skin condition as measured by the inventive  <br>
    acoustic emission system 10 and method. Acoustic measurements may <br>
     be represented in a variety of media in association with skin<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCT/EP2004/012751<br>
-   16   -<br>
care and/or cleansing products within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Subsequent to a baseline analysis of facial attributes using 5     <br>
acoustic emission system 10 and method, treatment is begun with  <br>
a selected cosmetic product for the particular facial   <br>
attribute. Treatment is continued for a period of time  <br>
sufficient to allow the product to treat the signs of the  <br>
particular facial attribute.<br>
10<br>
After the treatment period of time, such as four weeks, another acoustic measurement is taken. Testing may occur thereafter at 6, 8, 12, 16 and/or 20 weeks. The time intervals and numbers may be longer or shorter.  If the  cosmetic product  is  properly<br>
15  functioning, fewer and/or smaller undesirable facial attributes will appear upon acoustic evaluation. This procedure can then be repeated at intervals of six or eight weeks or at any further time interval.<br>
20  The acoustic emission system 10 and method may be used in conjunction with a variety of media for displaying measurement results, including in or out of home use of the Internet, webcam, personal digital assistant [e.g, Palm Pilot™] , mobile phone, and other media capable of displaying the results in graphical,<br>
25  quantitative, and/or qualitative terms. A strip embodying such result may be given out to consumers at point of sale or at a store display.<br>
An objective clinical grading scale, whereby each image is 30   <br>
associated with a number, may be developed.<br><br>

In the following, several examples of application of the inventive system and method are described. The following is by way of example, not by way of limitation, of the principles of <br>
15   the invention to illustrate the best itvode of carrying out the  <br>
      invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
20  This example uses acoustic emission measurements to characterize the tactile properties on skin of surfactants applied thereto, e.g. slimy, squeaky and slimy/squeaky transition evaluation, using acoustic emission measurements.<br>
25  An acoustic emission system 10 as generally described with reference to FIG. 1 was used for testing squeakiness and its transition properties of surfactant solutions.  One  probe 12, i.e.,  hydrophone 22  (Bruel  &amp; Kjaer,  Atlanta,  GA,  8103 hydrophone), was mounted onto an inner wall of a container (not<br>
30  shown) for surfactant property testing in aqueous solution. The<br>
inner container wall may be machined with certain roughness in<br>
order to reduce the reflection of sound waves from the container<br>
wall.  The charge signal frc conditioned to<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCT/EP2004/012751<br>
-   18   -<br>
voltage signal via a Bruel &amp; Kjae Conditioner anplifier 28. Clean fingers were rubbed against each other inside the surfactant solution while data acquisition system 16 (CcolEdit 2000 from Syntrillium Software Corporation, Phoenix, AZ) digitized the  sound waves into storage, manipulation, and output system 18, i.e., a computer file.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the sound profiles of a common surfactant used in<br>
wash-off products,  i.e.,  sodium PEG  lauryl  ether sulfate 10  (SLES)/water solution at different concentrations, generated<br>
using the system of FIG. 1. The observations from these Figures<br>
are:<br>
2A 1% SLES/water solution shows very low sound level all the<br>
time, indicating a slimy feel or tactile perception; <br>
15  2B 0.2% SLES/water solution shows the sound level from high to<br>
low as finger rubbing time goes on, indicating a transition from<br>
squeaky to slimy feel at this concentration;<br>
2C 0.01% SLES/water solution shows a very high sound level all<br>
the time, indicating a squeaky feel that does not goes away with 20  time at this concentration.<br>
The differences between these solutions are easily discernible from the results. For higher concentration (e.g. 1% SLES/water solution, Fig. 2A) , the SLES film covers the entire skin surface  and lubricates the two skin surfaces against their touching. No significant sound can be produced by rubbing fingers (sound pressure is very low). The consumer perceives sliminess of the solution.<br>
30  With reference to FIG. 2B, when the SLES concentration is lower<br>
(e.g. 0.2%), the sound profile is strongly dependent on rubbing<br>
time. In the beginning of rubbing, the sound level is very high,<br>
corresponding to a "squeaky" feel. As the rubbing continues, the<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCT/EP2004/012751<br>
-   19  -<br>
sound level gradually decreases and the consumer can also perceive that the squeakiness decreases. When the solution is perceived as slimy,  almost no sound is emitted.<br>
5     Below a certain SLES concentration (Fig. 2C) , the consumer can only feel squeakiness of solution no matter how long rubbing goes.<br>
The results demonstrate a strong connection between the consumer <br>
10        tactile perceptions and acoustic emission signals. Different <br>
           surfactant systems give different acoustic profiles, thereby <br>
           representing the different squeakiness/sliminess of those  <br>
           surfactant systems. The acoustic method can be used for quickly <br>
           and simply evaluating  surfactant systems for the tactile <br>
15      perception they produce.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
    This example demonstrates an assessment of the rinse profile of 20  wash-off products,  simultaneously using hydrophone 22 and  <br>
    accelerometer 24.<br>
With reference to FIG. 1, in this example, a typical set-up for assessment of wash-off (cleansing) products was used, employing<br>
25 simultaneously hydrophone 22 and accelerometers 24. To characterize the rinsability and "feel" of skin cleansers, the acoustic emission signal can be detected by hydrophone 22 immersed in a tank filled with water (not shown) for rinsing an area of skin.   Two accelerometers 24 were attached to the<br>
30  subject's skin (PCB 352A24 accelerometer for normal vibration, and PCB 356A15 triaxial accelerometer for tangential and normal vibration) . A known amount of cleansers was applied on the wet forearm with the hand of an individual. The arm was then immersed<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCT7EP2004/012751<br>
-   20   -<br>
    into the rinse tank full of certain hardness water at     <br>
    certain temperature. The other hand rubbed the arm with product     <br>
     while the rubbing sound was picked up by hydrophone 22 and    <br>
   skin vibration was detected by accelerometers 24, simultaneously. 5<br>
The acoustic emission signal from hydrophone 22 was conditioned as in Example 1 and recorded by data acquisition system 16. Signals from accelerometers 24 were conditioned by PCB 442B104 signal conditioner 30 (PCB Piezotronics, Inc., Depew, NY).<br>
10<br>
Data from data acquisition system 16 was communicated to storage, manipulation, and output system 18, i.e., a Cool Edit 2000 with sound card digitizing system. In addition, a professional acoustic emission system (Bruel &amp; Kjaer Pulse 6.1 and 7.0,<br>
15  Atlanta, GA) was used.<br>
A rinse profile of a wash-off product (TEA-N-Lauroyl L-Glutamate (LT-12)) in soft water (40 PPM, Ca++/MG++=3/l) thereby obtained is shown in FIG. 3. The figure illustrates how, during rinse, the<br>
20  amplitude of the acoustic emission signal changes significantly. At first, because of the lubricating effect of the surfactants, the acoustic signal is very significantly reduced. The slimy region has no sound or very low sound level while the squeaky region has stronger sound level.  As the rinse proceeds, much<br>
25 higher amplitude "squeaky" sounds are produced. The speed of rinse of the cleansers can be assessed on the wave file by measuring the time period before the occurrence of high amplitude squeaky sound. The squeakiness of the cleansers can be assessed by measuring the average amplitude of the squeaky sound. In this<br>
30 particular case, there is no acoustic emission signal from the first three rubs while consumer perceives the sliminess of the wash-off product. From the 4th rub to 10th rub, the acoustic emission signals are different at each rub, indicating the<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCT/EP2004/012751<br>
-  21   -<br>
squeakiness changes during rinse. In the 5th and 6th rubs, the more uniform sound profile relates to the smooth feel. In the last several rubs, there are larger interrupts between sound emission spikes, which correlate to the stick/slip of skin surfaces. The consumers usually perceive clean rinse when they reach these rubs.<br>
The whole acoustic profile shows the very rich information during rinse of wash-off products. The different squeakiness can be  observed from the sound profile and can be further extracted by applying different data analysis methods (e.g. Fast-Fourier transform (FFT) can reveal the frequency of stick/slip which relates to the squeakiness) .<br>
15  Moreover, the observed acoustic emission profile corresponds extremely well to the consumer's perceptions during rinse.<br>
Fig. 4 shows two distinct rinse profiles obtained by rinse in soft water for two different products by acoustic methods using  the combination of hydrophone 22 and accelerometers 24 as described in this example. Product A is Kao White™ brand bar, a leading soap bar in the Japanese market. Product B is DOVE™ brand bar from Nippon Lever, Japan.<br>
25   Figs. 4A and 4C are signals from hydrophone 22 of two wash-off products. Product A has a quick rinse and feels very squeaky. As shown in Fig. 4A, the slimy region lasts about 5 seconds when the sound pressure is low. In the squeaky region, the sound pressure is higher than 100 Pa. and fine analysis shows the very strong<br>
30 stick/slip signal. For product B, the slimy region lasts about 9 seconds and in the squeaky region, the sound pressure reaches peak value about 60 Pa. But most of signals remain under 45 Pa.<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCT/EP2004/012751<br>
-   22   -<br>
More clear differences between the products can be observed by<br>
comparison of skin vibration, as shown in Figs. 4B and 4D. Normal<br>
(to the skin surface) vibration of skin surface is shown. The<br>
acceleration shown in Fig. 4B can reach 6 g and the frequency of<br>
5  the vibration is medium at the beginning of squeaky region and is<br>
very low later, which indicates the strong stick/slip.  Japanese<br>
consumers usually perceive clean rinse when they reach these<br>
rubs, and this it the preferred tactile perception for the<br>
Japanese market.   However, American consumers perceive this<br>
10  tactile perception as harsh.  In Fig. 4D, the acceleration is<br>
much lower and the frequency is higher in the squeaky region,<br>
which was correlated to a perceived smooth feel.<br>
The combination of hydrophone 22 and accelerometers 24 reveals 15   the consumer perceptions during rinse and can be used as an  <br>
instrumental tool for conducting consumer tests for wash-off      <br>
products.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 20<br>
This example demonstrates evaluation of sensory properties of skin care leave-on products.<br>
With reference to FIG. 1, system 10 for acoustic measurement and 25   evaluation of sensory properties of leave-on and wash-off  <br>
products included two accelerometers 24 (PCB 352A24, PCB   <br>
Piezotronics, Inc., Depew, NY) attached to the subject's forearm. <br>
One accelerometer 24 was attached near the palm of the hand and <br>
the other near the elbow, to sense the normal vibration of skin 30  surface. Two microphones 20 (1/2" type 4189 pre-polarized free-<br>
field microphone, Bruel &amp; Kjaer, Atlanta, GA) were mounted above <br>
the two sites where accelerometers 24 were attached. To generate <br>
skin vibration, the subject used the other hand (fingers) to rub<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCT7EP2004/012751<br>
-   23   -<br>
the forearm starting at the elbow and continuing in the direction of the palm of the hand. Alternatively, a motorized "hand" equipped with loading cell and friction sensor can also be used to rub instead of using human fingers, in order to control the   loading, rubbing speed and measure the friction at the same time.<br>
All acoustic emission signals were	collected by Pulse data<br>
acquisition system 16 (Bruel &amp; Kjaer,	Atlanta, GA) and analyzed<br>
subsequent to collection by storage,	manipulation, and output<br>
10  system 18.<br>
In the following discussions, we only refer to the signal from accelerometer 24 located closer to the elbow.<br>
15  Fig. 5 shows the results of normal acceleration for before and after applying a skin care leave-on product to a subject's forearm. With reference to FIG. 5A, before applying any skin care product, the skin vibrates in a certain band of frequency with certain amplitude.  Fair &amp; Lovely™ brand lotion, available from<br>
20 Hindustan Lever Ltd, a dry matte product specially formulated for the Indian market preference, was applied to the forearm. It was observed that after application of the skin care product, the skin vibration changed as the product dried. With reference to FIG. 5B, while the product was still wet, the signal from<br>
25  accelerometer 24 showed very low amplitude vibration with lower frequency. With reference to FIGs. 5C - E, during drying of the product, strong vibration peaks were observed. The strong vibration peaks related to the sudden releases of two stretched skin surfaces sticking together during sliding of fingers. At<br>
30  that stage, the subject felt strong dragginess of the product, which is preferred by the Indian consumer and other. consumers in hot climates. Fig. 5F shows the acceleration of skin surface after the skin care product dried completely.<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCT/EP2004/012751<br>
-  24   -<br>
FIG. 6 demonstrates that different leave-on products create different feelings. The vibration detected via accelerometers 24 can differentiate those feelings very sensitively. Fig. 6 shows  two acceleration curves of two different products which give consumer different feelings. The signals are displayed at the same scale for easy comparison. Product 1 (data for which is shown in FIG 6A), Fair &amp; Lovely™ brand cream, which feels dry and draggy,  creates several strong vibration peaks which<br>
10 correlate to the stick-slip event of two sliding surfaces. Product 2 (data for which is shown in FIG 6B), POND'S™ brand Age-defying Complex lotion (Chesebrough-Pond's, U.S.) produces an intermediate feel between smooth and draggy. Different consumers may prefer different tactile perceptions.<br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
This example demonstrates an assessment of after-use feel for wash-off products using accelerometers 24.<br>
20<br>
Fig 7 shows two acceleration curves of after-feel. A consumer was asked to use two different cleansing products. After using certain amount of water for washing the products, the skin was patted dry with a tissue. The signals shown here were taken at 2<br>
25 rain after dry. Fig. 7A shows the after-feel curve of Kao White™ brand bar, which makes skin more hydrophobic and produces a wdry" feel. Fig. 7B shows the acceleration of a quite different cleansing product, DOVE™ brand bar, that makes skin hydrophilic and produces a moisturization feel. The strong stick/slip peaks<br>
30 were observed. The results show that the moisturization agents make the skin more tacky.<br><br>

EXAMPLE  5<br>
The present invention is for objectively assessing attributes or condition of an area of human skin. Facial attributes, such as  pores, wrinkles and photoaging, may be evaluated. The inventive system and method can be applied for consumer self-evaluation or for evaluation by a beautician or sales associate.<br>
This example illustrates that an evaluation of pre- and post-10  treatment pore appearance is possible using acoustic emission  <br>
system 10, suggesting the validity and usefulness of the system   <br>
and method of the present invention.<br>
Sheer Coverage™ brand foundation, available from Calvin Klein 15   Cosmetics Co., New York, was evaluated using acoustic emission  <br>
system 10. Good results were obtained. Consumers perceived a  <br>
difference acoustic emission system scale, as it correlated well <br>
with the visually perceived improvement in appearance of pores <br>
after application of the foundation.<br>
 20<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
This example illustrates the use of acoustic emission system 10 and method as a consulting tool at point of purchase and/or as a   tool for communicating with consumers.<br>
Generally, consumers in Japan reject for purchase or use soap bars they perceive as "slimy". A new soap bar, based on new technology, is developed and placed on the market in Japan.   Acoustic emission system 10 and method are used to communicate to the Japanese consumers:<br>
(a) that the new soap bar has changed tactile perception; and<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCT/EP2004/012751<br>
-  26   -<br>
(b) what will be different for the consumer in terms of sensory and end benefit.<br>
5 	Conversely, the product newly formulated for Japan would now   <br>
be perceived as having an unpleasant "rub" by the American consumer, and a choice may be made available together with acoustic emission system 10 available at point of purchase to allow the consumer to select the bar that minimizes the unpleasant "rub." <br>
10<br>
The method can be used as a communication tool to consumers (e.g. advertising).<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
15<br>
This example illustrates the use of acoustic emission measurement system 10 and method for determining the condition of the skin pre- and post- treatment, and the usefulness of visual improvement in untreated skin condition to induce the consumer to<br>
20  continue using the product.<br>
A consumer took a measurement of the pre-treatment condition of her facial skin using acoustic emission measurement system 10.<br>
25 Subsequently, the consumer applied a POND'S Dramatic Results™ brand product, available from Chesebrough-Pond's, U.S., over a period of about four weeks. Another acoustic emission measurement was taken of clean facial skin without product application.      The  measurement  indicated  a  significant<br>
30 improvement in appearance of facial skin wrinkles over the period of use.<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCTYEP2004/012751<br>
-  27  -<br>
Although the improvement after four weeks would not have been visually perceptible and would not have been perceptible to the touch, the improvement was evident from acoustic emission measurement, which encouraged the consumer to continue using the   POND'S product.<br>
Another advantage of the acoustic emission method of the present invention is that consumers cannot remember the condition of their skin before use. This method gives the consumers a way to  compare the difference before and after use of cosmetic products. Therefore, acoustic emission measurements are a good tool for communicating with consumers regarding long term benefits of a given cosmetic product or regimen.<br>
15	EXAMPLE 8<br>
Acoustic   emission   signal   expected   to   result    from   use   of    a<br>
 cleanser    as    shown    in    Fig.    2    was    printed,     folded    into    a <br>
concertina,   or pamphlet  and placed  in a carton also containing <br>
20      the product.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
This example demonstrates the utility of acoustic emission system 25  10 and method to define consumer preferences.<br>
During a focus group study, 10 consumers were asked to pick out a skin cleansing product that left them with their "ideal" end point skin after-feel. The product selected by the majority of  the consumers was evaluated using the inventive acoustic emission system 10 by the inventive method. With the acoustic emission profile in hand, different product formulations were evaluated to match the one preferred by the consumers.<br><br>
WO 2005/046474	PCT/EP2004/012751<br>
-  28   -<br>
Thus the inventive system and method served as a tool to generate purchase intent in consumers, as well as a tool for developing products to suit consumer preferences. <br>

EXAMPLE 10<br>
This example discusses the use of acoustic emission system 10 and  <br>
   method in the development and validation of clinical scale.<br>
10<br>
20<br>
   In the consumer study discussed above, consumers were also asked to characterize each of the products tested as leaving a "slimy," "smooth," or "squeaky" tactile perception on the skin. This    <br>
15 <br>
consumer data was correlated with acoustic emission signals for     <br>
   each of the products, to develop an acoustic emission scale that corresponds to consumer perceptions of slimy, smooth, or squeaky. The results of this exercise showed that the two grading methods are highly correlated with one another. The acoustic emission images were thus used as anchors to generate a reproducible clinical scale for the grading of tactile skin perception.<br>
  In a separate exercise, two clinicians verified that there was a   <br>
    high correlation between the consumer stated tactile perception     <br>
    and the corresponding acoustic emission signal image. <br>

EXAMPLE 11<br>
This    example    demonstrates    the    utility    of    acoustic    emission measurements according to the present invention in assisting with product selection.<br>
POND'S Institute is set up in Spain,   including a vending machine for    personalizing    leave-on    and   wash-off    cosmetic    products.<br><br>

Preparation of such products immediately upon demand has the advantages of custom products and is particularly advantageous for compositions including unstable ingredients which are best kept unmixed until close to time of use.<br>
 5<br>
In this example, a consumer, with help from a beautician inputs personal preference information for a leave-on product (face cream) . Additionally, an acoustic emission measurement was taken to determine the condition of her skin, such as moisture   level, skin oiliness, etc.<br>
The vending machine produces a custom cream based on the preference information input by the consumer, as well as based on acoustic emission measurements of her skin condition. <br>

  The procedure of this example is particularly advantageous for deodorant products, where "tack" is a very important tactile perception.<br>

documenting skin aging features and the two investigators involved in this step of the study.<br>
For the four investigators included in the study, the inter-observer agreement was found to be good to very good except for features related to skin color such as lentigines and telangiectasia.<br>
Our results indicate that most of the grading scales presented in this study enable a good to very good reproducibility of assessment of the visible consequences of the skin aging process except for the modifications of skin color which need to be better documented.<br>
Friction and elasticity<br>
18<br>
The frictional feel analyzer<br>
M Takahashi, M Egawa, T Hirao Shiseido Research Center, Yokohama, JP<br>
Background: Sensory evaluation is important in the testing of cosmetic products. Several devices for the measurement of sensory properties have been developed in recent years. The objective here is to measure skin surface friction using these devices and to examine the correlation with other physiological parameters in order to evaluate the feasibility of using physical measurement to predict tactile sensation. We have also studied the relationship between skin frictional parameters and sensory evaluation after application of cosmetics.<br>
Methods: A KES-SE Frictional Analyzer (Kato Tech Co. Ltd., Japan), a commercial device for measurement of surface frictional characteristics, was used in this study. An arm holder was added to this device for measurement on the human forearm. Frictional coefficient (MTU) and its mean deviation (MMD) were used as parameters of surface friction. The moisture content in the stratum corneum was measured with a Come-ometer CM825, the transpidermal water loss with a Tewameter TM21Q, the viscoelastic proper^ ties of the skin with a Cutometer SEM575, and the skin surface pattern by observing the negative replica obtained with silicon rubber for untreated and SDS-treated forearm. MIU and MMD were also measured immediately, and at 4 and 7h after application of nine kinds of moisturizing lotion with different textures, and the sensory evaluation was made by panels of 149 normal healthy volunteers and six beauty specialists at<br><br>
the same time as frictional measurement was done and on the morning after application. Results: MIU was.not influenced by load, but it was increased by water application on the skin. The relations between MIU and the moisture content in the stratum corneum, between MMD and skin surface pattern, and between MMD and viscosity of both normal human forearm skin and SDS-induced dry skin, were established by statistical analysis of test results with human subjects. There was a high correlation between MIU and sensory evaluation as moist, sticky and slippery. The changing pattern of MIU with time after application of cosmetics to skin was well correlated with the subjective sensation. Conclusion: Human skin surface friction was measured by using a KES-SE Frictional Analyzer after application of test cosmetics. A good correlation was found between MIU or MMD and the results of sensory evaluation. This instrumental analysis may be useful to predict the tactile impression of cosmetics on human skin.<br>

Introduction: The goal of this work is to assess the tactile perception by analysis of the friction forces and acoustic emission. A prototype of perception metrology was developed to quantify the friction and acoustic signals during the sliding of the finger on a surface of materials. It reproduces the natural movement of the touch: a gesture of horizontal friction which is adjusted in amplitude. The hand remains united of a motorized support describing with a constant speed of 10 mm. s-1 a journey of length 15 mm. The support of the tests is an instrumented membrane, which allows the measurement of normal and friction forces and acoustic signal. Before the acquisition, the normal force must be adjusted. The membrane can be covered with different type of surfaces (abrasive paper, tissue, leather...), allowing us a wide field of investigation.<br>
Results: The finger sliding tests on various abrasive papers show a good correlation of the coefficient of friction and the variations of acoustic signal (amplitude and wave band). The coefficient of friction presents a decrease in the<br><br>

XP001205205<br><br>
interval (4 - 1,2) similar to the fall of the acoustic signal of the order of 10 in 15 dB in the ranges of considerable frequencies: [250 Hz - 700 Hz] and [1000 Hz - 1500 Hz]. The roughness effect can be assessed by the evolution of friction force and the frequency range of acoustic spectrum. The effect of the finger hydration was analyzed for twenty subjects by measuring before observation, five and fifteen minutes after hydration. We obtain an identical global evolution for the coefficient of friction (2 — 1,5 - 2) and the sound intensity [61dB-50dB-62dB]. These variations come along with a translation of the main peak [380 Hz-250 Hz-370 Hz] and modifications of spectral contents meaning that the sound of the friction depends on the state of hydration. Conclusion: We have established a good correlation between the force of friction and the acoustic signal, so the measures made with the finger, provided with an acoustic sensor on the skin, allow to the clinicians and to the cosmetic industry to estimate the sensory properties while making a natural gesture of the touch. The device can be used to study the impact of a cosmetic formulation on the skin by evaluating the variations of sweetness, adhesion but especially effect of hydration as well as pathologies of the cutaneous tissue (psoriasis, eczema, dry skins...).<br>

Objectives: Technologies able to measure biome-chanical properties of the stratum corneum in vivo are rare.<br>
Practically, two main approaches could be mentioned as wave propagation celerity or use of microprobes.<br>
Because the microprobes Jor this application are not commercially available, we have built an original device named "Corneospinometer" and equipped with such aprobe, in order to appraise quantitatively the stratum corneum state. Methodology: Behavior of the stratum corneum is evaluated under microtorsion.<br>
More precisely, angular skin deformation is measured according to a mechanical torque applied at the skin surface by a probe, which<br><br>
Abstracts<br>
comprises a small needle being only 0.8 mm of diameter. Then the contact area is under 0.2 mm sand the appraisal is limited to thestratum corneum.-layer. An original technology allows to lower the needle till the skin in the axis of the probe, so that only the weight of the needle is applied on the skin and parasitic frictions are decreased (Fig. 1).<br>
The device comprises a coil which has two functions. Firstly, it applies a periodic torque to the needle. Secondly, it measures the angular positioning of the needle. Because of stratum corneum heterogeneity, a previous study about the protocol of measurement was run, to determine how to sample. Influence of climatic conditions was studied and carefully controlled. Finally, the probe was automated. A specific algorithm rejects automatically wrong data and computes the average. Results: The result is expressed by a Dynamic Torsion Rate value (DTR) which is the ratio between mechanical torque (constant sinusoidal amplitude) and Angular Skin Deformation (variable).<br>
A decrease of DTR corresponds to an improvement of stratum corneum suppleness because of a better hydration.<br>
Moisturizing efficacy of a rinse-off shower gel was evaluated successfully versus placebo, on the forearm of human volunteers after 2 weeks of treatment.<br>
Conclusion: The corneospinometer allows in vivo measurement of mechanical properties of stratum corneum with very low influence of other skin layers. This technique is very fast. The results are available immediately without any additional calculation. The results of the clinical study confirm the validity of the methodology.<br>

Study of the mechanical properties of human<br>
skin using the shear wave propagation method<br>
A Barel, R Lambrecht, P Clarys Vrije Universiteit Brussels, BE<br>
In vivo determination of the elastic properties and anisotropy of human skin can be determined using the shear, wave propagation method. The . Reviscometer RVM-600 R (Courage - Khazaka, Cologne, Germany) measures the resonance running time (RRT) between two sensors which are placed on the skin surface. The time that the acoustic waves travel from transmitter to receiver (RRT) is measured and expressed in arbitrary units related to time. The speed of propagation of the waves on the skin is inversely proportional to the stiffness and density of the tissues. RTT<br>
