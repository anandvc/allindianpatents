Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to multifocal ophthalmic lenses. In particular,<br>
the invention provides lenses in which the channel power progression is customized<br>
to the wearer's viewing posture.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of ophthalmic lenses for the correction of ametropia is well known.<br>
For example, multifocal lenses, such as progressive addition lenses ("PALs"), are<br>
used for the treatment of presbyopia. Typically, a PAL provides distance,<br>
intermediate, and near vision zones in a gradual, continuous progression of<br>
increasing dioptric power. PALs are appealing to the wearer because the lenses are<br>
free of the visible ledges between the zones of differing optical power that are found<br>
in other types of multifocal lenses, such as bifocals and trifocals.<br>
As the wearer's eyes move from the distance, through the intermediate, and<br>
into the near vision zones of a PAL, the wearer's eyes converge bringing the pupils<br>
closer together. Ideally, the design of a PAL would be such that the power<br>
progression from the distance zone, through the intermediate and to the near zone<br>
matches the wearer's requirements as the eye scans the lens. However, in the design<br>
of conventional PAL's, a trade-off is made between the power progression<br>
distribution and the level of unwanted astigmatism of the lens.<br>
Unwanted astigmatism is astigmatism introduced or caused by one or more<br>
of the lens surfaces resulting in image blurring, distorting, and shifting for the lens<br>
wearer. In order to reduce unwanted astigmatism, the power progression is<br>
distributed over a greater length in some designs. Due to this lengthened<br>
distribution, the power distribution may not meet the wearer's requirements and the<br>
wearer may have to alter their natural viewing posture, or head and eye position, in<br>
order to use the intermediate and near vision zones of the lens. In those lens designs<br><br>
in which the power progression distribution is over a shorter length, a more natural<br>
viewing posture may be provided, but the level of unwanted astigmatism is<br>
increased reducing the useable area of the lens.<br>
Thus, a need exists for a PAL that provides a power progression distribution<br>
tailored to the requirements of the wearer's natural eye path, but that does not<br>
increase the lens' unwanted astigmatism. Additionally, a need exists for a method to<br>
determine the preferred viewing posture of the wearer so that the wearer is not<br>
required to make significant viewing posture adaptations to use the lens.<br>

Description of the Invention and its Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides lenses, as well as methods for their design<br>
and production, in which the power distribution between the distance and near vision<br>
zone substantially meets the requirements of the wearer's eye path and refractive<br><br>
power. This power distribution is obtained without reducing the useable lens surface<br>
by introducing additional unwanted astigmatism.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a lens comprising, consisting<br>
essentially of, and consisting of a first surface having a first channel and a first<br>
channel power profile and a second surface having a second channel and a second<br>
channel power profile, wherein the channel power profile of the lens is the vector<br>
sum of the channel power profiles. By "lens" is meant any ophthalmic lens<br>
including, without limitation, spectacle lenses, contact lenses, intraocular lenses and<br>
the like. Preferably, the lens of the invention is a spectacle lens.<br>
The surfaces used in the lens of the invention may be progressive addition<br>
surfaces or regressive surfaces. By "progressive addition surface" is meant a<br>
continuous, aspheric surface having distance and near viewing or vision zones, and a<br>
zone of increasing dioptric power connecting the distance and near zones. By<br>
"regressive surface" is meant a continuous, aspheric surface having zones for<br>
distance and near viewing or vision, and a zone of decreasing dioptric power<br>
connecting the distance and near zones. By "channel" is meant the corridor of<br>
vision that is free of unwanted astigmatism of about 0.75 diopters or greater when<br>
the wearer's eye is scanning through the intermediate vision zone to the near vision<br>
zone and back. By "channel power profile" or 'power profile" is meant the power<br>
distribution along the channel length. By "channel length" is meant the distance<br>
from the lens' fitting point to a point along the channel at which the dioptric add<br>
power is about 85 percent of the dioptric add power of the surface. By "fitting<br>
point" is meant the point on a lens aligned with the wearer's pupil in its distance<br>
viewing position when the wearer is looking straight ahead. By "dioptric add<br>
power" is meant the amount of dioptric power difference between the near and far<br>
vision zones of a lens or surface.<br><br>
It is one discovery of the invention that a channel power profile suited to a<br>
specific lens wearer's requirements may be achieved by using at least two surfaces,<br>
each having a channel power profile. The channel power profiles may be<br>
substantially the same or different. The channels of the surfaces may be aligned or<br>
displaced. By aligned is meant that the major reference point of one channel is<br>
superposed on that of the other channel. By "major reference point" is meant the<br>
point of intersection of the primary meridian with the beginning of the channel, x =<br>
0, y = 0. By displaced is meant that major reference point of one channel is<br>
displaced downwardly with respect to that of the other channel. Either embodiment<br>
permits a large range of channel power profiles while limiting the number of<br>
surfaces required.<br>
In general, the channel power profile, P(x,y), of a progressive lens may be<br>
calculated as a vector sum of the profiles of each surface of the lens. For example,<br>
for a lens with two progressive surfaces, S' and S", which surfaces have channel<br>
power profiles P'(x,y) and P"(x,y), respectively, the power profile for the lens may<br>
be calculated according to the following equation:<br>
P(x,y) = P'(x,y) + P"(x-dx,y-dy) (1)<br>
wherein dx and dy are the x and y components of the displacement of the fitting<br>
point of surface S" with respect to surface S'.<br>
For example, S' may be a convex progressive surface and S" a concave<br>
progressive surface. Surface S" may be displaced vertically downwards relative to<br>
S' by a distance dy. If L' is the channel length of surface S', L" is the channel length<br>
of the surface S", and L" &gt; L', then the channel length L of the lens formed by<br>
combining surfaces S' and S" is calculated as L = L" + dy. The channel power<br>
profile will change in accordance with equation 1. If, however, L" 
displacement of S" downwards relative to S' will not change the channel length of<br><br>
the lens which will remain L = L', but will change the channel power profile within<br>
the channel. In the case in which surfaces S' and S" are not displaced, or in which<br>
dx = dy = 0, the channel length L is the greater of L' and L" and the power profile<br>
will change to be a vector sum according to equation 1.<br>
Thus, either or both the channel power profiles of the individual surfaces and<br>
displacement distances may be selected so that one can independently customize the<br>
channel power profile for a particular wearer. Either or both the channel profile<br>
difference and displacement will also misalign the areas of maximum unwanted<br>
astigmatism of the surfaces and the overall maximum astigmatism of the lens will be<br>
lower than the sum of the individual surfaces.<br>
Preferably, two progressive surfaces, one concave and one convex surface,<br>
with the same or similar channel power profiles are used and the varying channel<br>
power profile of the lens is obtained by displacement. The displacement of the<br>
surfaces' channels must be done in a manner so that either or, preferably both, the<br>
channels' centerlines and the channels' lateral edges' alignment is maintained. In<br>
this way, introduction of an unacceptable level of distortion in the channel may be<br>
avoided. Further, the displacement must be carried out so that unacceptable prism<br>
power, which may act to disrupt the wearer's vision, is not introduced. More<br>
preferably, the displacement is along the centerlines of the surfaces' channels with<br>
maintenance of the centerlines' alignment. The displacement may be about 0.1 mm<br>
to about 20 mm, preferably about 1 mm to about 10 mm, more preferably about 2<br>
nun to about 7 nan.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for producing a lens<br>
comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of the steps of: a.) measuring a<br>
lens wearer's eye path and refractive power requirement while the wearer is viewing<br>
an object at a distance, an intermediate, and a near position; and b.) providing a lens<br><br>
with a channel power profile based on the lens wearer's eye path and refractive<br>
requirement. By "eye path" is meant the course over a progressive or regressive<br>
surface that is aligned with the lens wearer's pupil as the eye scans from the fitting<br>
point to the wearer's natural near vision position.<br>
In the method of the invention, the channel power profile for the lens wearer<br>
is obtained by determining the wearer's eye path and the refractive power required<br>
by the wearer along that eye path. The eye path may be determined by any known<br>
technique. For example, the wearer may be provided with one or more lenses. The<br>
wearer then views at least three objects at distance, intermediate, and near locations<br>
while maintaining a natural viewing posture. It will be recognized that the more<br>
measurements made along the eye path, the greater the accuracy of the power profile<br>
obtained will be. Thus, preferably at least three points are measured along the eye<br>
path. The pupil position of the eye is recorded, for example by marking the lens<br>
surface, along the eye path. Conventional eye charts or fixation targets may be used<br>
to ensure that a stable pupil position is maintained during the measurement.<br>
The refractive power required by the wearer at each of the measured<br>
locations may be determined by using techniques well known in the an including,<br>
without limitation, the use of trial lenses or a phoropter. The channel power profile<br>
required by the wearer is then calculated from the refractive power measurements at<br>
each position along the eye path. One convenient method that may be used is to<br>
graphically connect the refractive power measurements by a smooth curve when<br>
plotted as a function of length below the fitting point One ordinarily skilled in the<br>
art will recognize that any of a variety of other methods may be used, such as fitting<br>
using the best equation through the measurements, all of which are within the scope<br>
of the invention. The eye path measurements for a lens wearer preferably is<br>
conducted separately for each eye because each of the wearer's eyes usually has a<br>
unique eye path.<br><br>
The lenses and methods of the invention may be used to provide a variety of<br>
power profiles for one lens wearer, each suited to a specific task to be carried out by<br>
the wearer. For example, displacement may increase the channel profile length so<br>
that a power plateau for intermediate distance tasks is provided. Alternatively, the<br>
profile may be shortened to provide an elongated near vision zone for reading.<br>
The progressive or regressive surfaces used in the lenses of the invention<br>
may be designed and optimized by any known method including, without limitation,<br>
the use of commercially available design software. The surfaces may be on a<br>
convex surface, a concave surface, a surface intermediate the concave and convex<br>
surface, or combinations thereof. One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize<br>
that, if a progressive surface forms the convex surface of the lens, the distance vision<br>
zone curvature will be less than that of the near zone curvature. Conversely, if the<br>
progressive surface is the lens' concave surface, the distance curvature will be<br>
greater than that of the near zone.<br>
The channel power profile for each surface may be selected from any of the<br>
known power profiles including, without limitation, linear, spline, trigonometric,<br>
and the like. The channel power profile for each surface may be the same or<br>
different. In all cases, the channel power profile resulting for the lens must<br>
substantially meet the wearer's eye path and refractive requirements when the<br>
wearer is maintaining a natural viewing posture.<br>
If surfaces are used in which the power progression decreases from the far<br>
vision to the near vision zone, the dioptric add power of the surface will be less than<br>
zero. The dioptric add power of each of the surface used in the invention is selected<br>
so that, when the surfaces are combined into a lens, the add power of the lens will<br>
equal that needed to correct the lens wearer's near vision acuity.<br><br>
The dioptric add power of each surface used in the invention may<br>
individually be about -3.00 to about +6.00 diopters, preferably about -2.00 diopters<br>
to about +5.00 diopters, more preferably about -1.00 to about +4.00 diopters. The<br>
surfaces each may contain spherical power, cylinder power and axis, or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
The lenses of the invention may be fabricated by any convenient means and<br>
constructed of any known material suitable for production of ophthalmic lenses.<br>
Suitable materials include, without limitation, polycarbonate, allyl diglycol,<br>
polymethacrylate, and the like. Such materials are either commercially available or<br>
methods for their production are known. Further, the lenses may be produced by<br>
any conventional lens fabrication technique including, without limitation grinding,<br>
whole lens casting, molding, thermoforming, laminating, surface casting, or<br>
combinations thereof. Casting may be carried out by any means, but preferably is<br>
performed by surface casting including, without limitation, as disclosed in United<br>
States Patent Nos. 5,147,585, 5,178,800, 5,219,497, 5,316,702, 5,358,672,<br>
5,480,600, 5,512,371, 5,531,940, 5,702,819, and 5,793,465 incorporated herein in<br>
their entireties by reference.<br>
The invention will be clarified further by the following, non-limiting<br>
examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
A lens wearer's pupil positions are photographed while the wearer is viewing<br>
objects at distance, intermediate, and near positions. The wearer wears single vision<br>
lenses for distance and intermediate vision and reading lenses for near vision. For<br>
distance viewing, a Snellen eye chart is placed 3 m from the wearer's pupils and for<br>
intermediate viewing, the chart is placed on a table that is 64 mm from the pupils.<br>
For near vision, the wearer is placed approximately at the wearer's natural reading<br><br>
position, which for the wearer of Example 1 is approximately 40 mm from the<br>
pupils. The wearer is found to require 0.00, 1.00, and 2.00 diopters sphere power for<br>
the distance, intermediate, and near vision, respectively. The pupil positions, as<br>
projected on the convex surface of the lens, for intermediate and near viewing are<br>
found to be 8.5 mm and 17.5 mm vertically below the pupil position during distance<br>
viewing, respectively Thus, the point at which the lens wearer will require the center<br>
of the near vision zone to be located is approximately 4 mm below the channel end,<br>
making the channel length 17.5 mm - 4.0 mm = 13.5 mm.<br>
Example 2<br>
Convex and concave progressive surfaces are provided. The convex surface<br>
has a distance curvature of 6.00 diopters and near zone curvature of 7.00 diopters.<br>
The channel power profile of the convex surface is shown in FIG. 2 as convex profile<br>
A. The channel length of this surface is 11 mm. The concave surface has a distance<br>
zone curvature of 6.00 diopters and a near zone curvature of 5.00 diopters. The<br>
channel power profile for the concave surface is shown in FIG. 2 as concave profile<br>
C and the channel length is 13 mm. The concave surface channel's major reference<br>
point is displaced downward 2 mm relative to the convex surface optical center. The<br>
resulting lens has a distance power and add power of 0.00 diopters and 2.00 diopters,<br>
respectively, with 1.00 diopters of add power contributed by each surface. The<br>
resulting channel power profile matches that required by the lens wearer of Example<br>
1 and is depicted in FIG. 1. The channel length of the lens is 13.55 mm and the<br>
location of the intermediate vision zone is 8.5 mm below the fitting point, consistent<br>
with the pupil measurements of the wearer in Example 1.<br>
Examples 3-4<br>
Two lens wearers are measured using the procedure of Example 1 and their<br>
pupil location measurements for intermediate and near tasks are found to be 9.5 mm<br>
and 19 mm for the wearer of Example 3 and 10.5 and 21 mm for the wearer of<br><br>
Example 4. Both require 0.00, 1.00, and 2.00 diopters power correction for distance,<br>
intermediate and near vision, respectively.<br>
Lenses according to the invention are made for the wearers. The convex<br>
progressive surface of each lens has a distance zone curvature of 6.00 diopters and a<br>
near vision zone curvature of 7.00 diopters. The channel power profiles of the<br>
convex surfaces are shown in FIG. 2 as convex profile A and the channel lengths are<br>
11 mm. The concave progressive surfaces have distance zone curvatures of 6.00<br>
diopters and near zone curvatures of 5.00 diopters. The channel power profiles of the<br>
concave surfaces are shown in FIG. 2 as concave profiles D and E, respectively, and<br>
the channel lengths are 11 mm. The major reference point of each lens' concave<br>
surface channel is displaced downward relative to the convex surface major reference<br>
point by 4 mm and 6 mm for the lens of Examples 3 and 4, respectively. The<br>
resulting channel power profiles of the lenses are shown in FIG. 1. The channel<br>
lengths are 15 mm and 17 mm for Example 3 and Example 4, respectively, as<br>
required by the pupil positions of the lenses' wearers for near viewing and the<br>
locations of the intermediate zones are 9.5 mm and 10. 5mm, respectively, below the<br>
fitting point<br>
Examples 5-6<br>
Two lens wearers are measured by the procedure of Example 1 and their<br>
pupil location measurements for intermediate and near tasks are determined to be 5<br>
mm and 15 mm below the fitting point for the wearer of Example 5 and 7.5 and 15<br>
mm for the wearer of Example 6. Both wearers require 0.00 diopters, 1.00 diopters,<br>
and 2.00 diopters power correction for distance, intermediate and near vision, but the<br>
Example 5 wearer prefers a more rapid progression of power at the top of the channel<br>
than does the Example 6 wearer.<br><br>
FIG. 4 illustrates the lens channel profiles of the lenses made for these<br>
wearers. The convex surface of each lens has a distance zone curvature of 6.00<br>
diopters and near zone curvature of 7.00 diopters and is shown in FIG. 3 as convex<br>
profile F. The channel length is 11 mm. The concave surfaces have distance<br>
curvatures of 6.00 diopters and near zone curvature of 5.00 diopters. The channel<br>
power profiles for the concave surfaces are shown in FIG. 3 as concave profiles G<br>
and H, respectively. The channel length is 5.5 mm for both concave surfaces. The<br>
optical center of the concave surface for Example 6 is coincident with that of the<br>
convex surface. In Example 5, the optical center of the concave surface is displaced<br>
4 mm downward from that of the convex surface. The resulting distance and add<br>
powers for both lenses are 0.00 diopters and 2.00 diopters, with 1.00 diopters of add<br>
power contributed by each surface. The channel power profiles of the lenses, shown<br>
in FIG. 4, are matched to the pupil position and power progression preferences of<br>
each wearer. Thus, although the channel lengths for the lenses are 11 mm, the<br>
locations of the intermediate vision zones are 5 mm and 7.5 mm below the fitting<br>
point.<br>
Example 7<br>
A lens wearer is measured using the procedure of Example 1 -and the pupil locations<br>
measurements for intermediate and near tasks are determined to be 7 mm and 15.5<br>
mm, receptively and the channel length is 15.5 mm - 4.00 ram = 11.5 mm. The<br>
wearer requires 0.00, 1.00, and 2.00 diopters power correction for distance,<br>
intermediate and near vision. The lens channel power profile suited to mis wearer is<br>
shown in FIG. 5.<br>
A lens is formed with a convex progressive surface and a concave regressive<br>
surface. The convex surface has a distance zone curvature of 6.00 diopters and near<br>
zone curvature of 9.00 diopters with a channel power profile shown in FIG. 6 as<br><br>
convex profile I. The channel length is 14 mm. The concave surface has a distance<br>
zone curvature of 6.00 diopters and near zone curvature of 7.00 diopters with a<br>
channel power profile as shown in FIG. 6 as concave profile J. The channel length<br>
is 13.5 mm. The concave surface optical center is displaced downward 2 mm relative<br>
to that of the convex surface. The resulting distance and add powers of the lens are<br>
0.00 and 2.00 diopters, respectively with 3.00 diopters of add contributed by the<br>
convex surface and -1.00 diopters add contributed by the concave surface. The<br>
resulting channel power profile is shown in FIG. 5. The channel length is 11.5 mm<br>
and the location of the intermediate vision zone is mm below the fitting point meeting<br>
the pupil measurements of the wearer.<br><br>
