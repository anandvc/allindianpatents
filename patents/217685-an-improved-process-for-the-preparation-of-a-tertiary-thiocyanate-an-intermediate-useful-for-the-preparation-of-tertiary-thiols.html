				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to    an improved process for the preparation of a tertiary thiocyanate, an intermediate useful for the preparation of tertiary thiols<br>
The uses of the present invention are, i) it provides a facile access to the preparation of tertiary alkyl thiocyanates, which are otherwise difficult to prepare and ii) the thiocyanates, thus prepared, can be converted easily into tertiary alkyl thiols,<br><br>
some of which possess guaya, grapefruit and black currant-like aroma. These compounds are of value in the art of application of aroma chemicals to foodstuffs, beverages, perfumery and cosmetics, air fresheners, medicinal^ and oral hygiene products.<br>
Many volatile organic sulphur compounds are important constituents of foods, beverages and natural isolates (Maarse H (ed) Volatile Compounds in Foods and Beverages, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1991). Of these, many thiols (mercaptans) are found to be the character-impact constituents of natural flavours e.g., 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol (beer), /?-menth-l-ene-8-thiol (grapefruit) and (lS,4S)-/?-menthan-3-one-8-thiol (buchu leaf oil) ( Boelens M H, Perfumer &amp; Flavorist, 18(3),29, 1993 and references cited therein). These volatiles have low threshhold values and are,<br>
usually, present in very low concentrations. For example, /?-menth-l-ene-8-thiol has a<br>
.4 threshold value of 
(Demole E, Enggist P &amp; Ohloff G, Helv. Chim. Acta, 65, 1785,1982).<br>
Thiols can be prepared from different classes of compounds like olefins, alkyl halides, alcohols and their derivatives, amines, disulphides, sulphonic acids and their derivatives ( Wardell J L , The Chemistry of Functional Groups, Thiols, part 1,<br><br>
Ed. Patai S, John Wiley and Sons, London, 1974). The more useful of them are the direct methods like reaction of hydrogen sulphide with alkenes or indirect methods like transformation of alkyl halides via thiouronium salts or xanthate intermediates. Thiols can also obtained from episulphides which are derivable from the corresponding epoxides.<br>
Reference may be made to the preparation of allylic terpene thiols from the corresponding terpenic alcohols or olefins via xanthogenate (Prater G, Sigg-Grutter T &amp; Wild J., Ger. Offen, 2,615,393, 1976) and W-sulphinyl benzenesulphonamide (Gadras A, Dunogues J, Galas R &amp; Deleris G, J Org. Chem, 49, 442, 1984) intermediates respectively. The main drawback of these methods is that they are not applicable to the synthesis of tertiary terpenic thiols.<br>
Reference may be made to the direct addition of hydrogen sulphide to olefinic bonds in terpene hydrocarbons in the presence of catalysts like aluminium trihalide (Toltikbv G. A., Kanzafarov F. Y., Dzhemilev U. M., Kantyukova R. G. &amp; Zelenova L. M., Zh. Org. Khim. 19, 2075, 1984 &amp; Janes J. F, Marr I. M, Unwin N, Banthorpe D. V &amp;» Yusuf A., Flav. Fragr. J. 8, 289, 1993). The drawbacks of these methods are that they afford terpenic thiols in low yield and yield a number of by-product.<br>
Reference may also be made to a patent ( Masuda H, Kikuiri H &amp; Mihara S, Jpn Kokai Tokkyo, 63,201,162, 1988) wherein /?-menth-l-ene-8-thiol was synthesised from (+)-limonene using this approach. A drawback of this method is that cyclic sulphides are formed as by-products and separation of thiol from the complex mixture is cumbersome and difficult.Reference may be made to two patents, Demole E &amp; Enggist P, EP 54,847,1982, Mookherjee B D, Chant B J, Evers W J, Wilson R A, Zampino M J, and Vock M H, US patent 4,536,583, 1985, describing the synthesis of<br><br>
/?-menth-l-ene-8 thiol in an overall yield of 40% from (+)-limonene via its episulphide by two alternative procedures. The drawbacks of these inventions are that they are multi-stepped and involve selective epoxidation of the sidechain double bond of (+)-limonene using an unconventional reagent.<br>
Thiols being not very stable generally during storage, they could readily be prepared from their corresponding thiocyanates, which in turn could be prepared from the corresponding alkyl halides.<br>
In the known art, several methods are reported for the synthesis of alkyl thiocyanates ( Guy R.C in Chemistry ofCyanates and their Thio Derivatives, S.Patai ed. part 2, pp. 819-886, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1977). But the common ones are by the nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides, sulphonates or azides with metal thiocyanates. Accordingly, primary and secondary halides react with alkali metal (potassium and sodium) thiocyanates to afford the corresponding thiocyanates in good yields.' However, the drawbacks of this method are that it is not readily applicable to tertiary halides as the reaction leads to the formation of both iso- and thiocyanates, the former £eing a major one in most cases, and overall yield of substitution products is poor ( Watanabe N, Okamo M and Vemura S, Bull. Chem. Soc., Japan, 47, 2745, 1974). Transition metal thiocyanates like mercury, silver or copper salts do afford better yields of substitution products with SN! -active halides. The main drawback of<br>
these methods is that they yield isothiocyanates, predominantly.<br>
Reference may be made to the employment of zinc salts for the preparation of thio- and isothiocyanates from SN! -active halides like tertiary, allylic and benzylic halides ( Gurudutt K N, Sanjay Rao and Srinivas P, Indian J. Chem. 30B, 343-344, 1991) wherein thiocyanates could be obtained in higher proportions than<br><br>
sothiocyanates viz., range of 2 to 4.5 : 1 respectively. The main drawback of this discovery is that super ambient temperatures ( 40 -80°C) have to be employed for accelerating the reaction which also promote the isomerisation of the initially formed thiocyanates into thermodynamically more stable isothiocyanates.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to evolve an improved process for the preparation of tertiary thiols, which obviates the drawbacks of the existing processes as described above.<br>
Accordingly , the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of a tertiary thiocyanate, an intermediate useful for the preparation of a tertiary thiol, which comprises preparing a zinc thiocyanate by reacting equimolar quantities of an anhydrous alkali metal thiocyanate salt and anhydrous zinc chloride in an organic solvent such as herein described , under stirring and reflux followed by evaporation of the solvent and drying the resultant under reduced pressure, reacting the obtained zinc thiocyanate of 1.4 mol equivalent with 1 mol equivalent of an alkyl or alkyl aryl substituted tertiary halide of formula I, where R-i, R2, R3 is alkyl or alkyl aryl or a mixture thereof and C = Cl or Br, in an organic solvent such as herein described, in the presence of an equimolar quantity of an organic base as defined herein, using ultrasonic sound in the range of 40 - 50 kHz frequency and RF power in the range of 70 - 90 Watts , at a temperature in the range of 10 - 25°C for a period ranging from 3.5 to 27 h , followed by isolation of the product by conventional method.<br><br>
R- =alkyl or aryl or a mixture thereof X    = CI or Br<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the zinc thiocyanate salt may be generated by contacting equimolar quantities of anhydrous zinc chloride with an alkali metal thiocyanate like potassium thiocyanate in an organic solvent like benzene under reflux followed by the evaporation of the solvent and drying of the reagent under reduced pressure at 1-2 mm Hg over calcium chloride in a desiccator for 12 hours.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, an organic base used may be selected from the group consisiting of pyridine, trimethylamine and triethylamine.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention the reaction may be carried out<br>
under the influence of an ultrasonic sound in the range of 40-50 kHz frequency and<br>
» RF power in the range of 70-90 Watts.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the temperatures employed for the reaction may be in the range of 10-25 C.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the organic solvent employed for the reaction may be selected from the group consisting of dichloromethane, chloroform, benzene, and tetrahydrofuran.<br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention, an alkyl or alkyl aryl substituent used may be an alkyl or aryl substituted tertiary thiocyanate prepared may be selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, substituted cyclohexenyl, phenyl, allyl, part of cycloalkyl moiety and a mixture thereof.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

(Figure Removed)<br>
Zinc thiocyanate was prepared by stirring anhydrous potassium thiocyanate (4.08 gm, 42 mmol) with anhydrous zinc chloride (2.86 gm, 21 mmol) in refluxing benzene (40 ml) under stirring for 8 h. The solvent was decanted off and the salt dried under reduced pressure (10-1 mm Hg) in a flash evaporator and then in a vacuum desiccator (1-2 mm Hg) over fused calcium chloride for 12 h .<br>
Zinc thiocyanate (21 mmol) was taken in a dry dichloromethane ( 40 ml) in a 100 ml round bottommed flask. To it pyridine (30 mmol) was added followed by drop-wise addition of a solution of tertiary butyl chloride of formula II (X = Cl, 2.77g, 30 mmol) or tertiary butyl bromide of formula II (X=Br, 4.11g, 30 mmol) dichloromethane ( 5 ml each). The flask containing the mixture was suspended in an<br>
ultrasonic bath maintained at 25 C and in the frequency range of 40-50 kHz and RF<br>
power of 70-90 Watts. The reactants were sonicated until the completion of the reaction which was monitored by NMR for disappearance of the signal for methyl protons at 1.65 in case of tertiary butyl chloride and 1.82 in case of tertiary butyl bromide. The product was poured into chilled dilute acid (2.8 ml hydrochloric acid in 100 ml water) and the organic layer separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane ( 4x 15 ml). The combined organic layer was washed free of acid with 5 % sodium bicarbonate solution followed by water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and the solvent evaporated. The residue was fractionated to afford pure tertiary butylthiocyanate formula H( X= SCN, b.p.55°C/35 mm Hg). The results are given in Table 1.<br>
