				<td>PROCESS FOR PRODUCING INFANT FOOD PRODUCTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention [0001]   The present invention relates generally to a process for producing infant food products and particularly to an aseptic process for producing infant food products in which each ingredient is processed to the minimum extent necessary so that distinctive natural colours and natural tastes of the ingredients are retained after processing.<br>
Description of Related Art [0002]   Exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life is considered the best way of providing  ideal   nutrition  for  healthy  growth  and  development  of infants. Breastfeeding also strengthens an infant's immune system, reducing the incidence and severity of infectious diseases.<br>
[0003] Some mothers caimot breastfeed, while others, for personal, cultural, socioeconomic or health reasons, choose not to. In these cases, the World Health Organisation (WHO) states that mothers should be supported in optimising their infant's nutrition.<br>
Infant Formula [0004] The WHO/Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) Codex Alimentarius Commission, the UN body that sets international standards for foods, recognises that infant formula is the best substitute for breast milk. While industrially prepared infant formula cannot replicate exactly all the qualities of breast milk, it represents a considerable improvement over traditional substitutes that may be nutritionally inadequate and unsafe. These include unmodified animal milk (from cows, goats or buffaloes) and various types of cereal gruel.<br>
[0005] Industrially prepared infant formula has been designed for use from birth as a partial or total replacement for breast milk. The Codex Alimentarius defines it as "a product based on milk of cows or other animals and/or other edible constituents of animal, including fish, or plant origin, which have proved to be suitable for infant feeding." When used as the sole source of nourishment, infant formula must meet all the energy and nutrient requirements of infants during the first six months of life.<br>
Complementary Foods [0006]   After an initial six months of exclusive breastfeeding, infants should start receiving nutritionally adequate, safe and appropriate complementary foods.<br>
<br>
[0007] Complementary foods are used for weaning and they can be defined as "any food, whether manufactured or locally prepared, suitable as a complement to breast milk or to infant formula, when either becomes insufficient to satisfy the nutritional requirements of the infant." They include, for example, milk products, home made foods and processed foods based on cereals, fruits, vegetables, meat, fish and carbohydrates. [0008] Complementary foods should be introduced into an infant's diet when breast-milk or a breast-milk substitute no longer satisfies the infant's nutritional requirements. During this transition period, as the infant's digestive system develops, the infant's diet can gradually evolve from an exclusive milk diet to a fully diversified diet similar to that of adults.<br>
[0009] Different tastes and textures can be progressively introduced into the diet, for example through cereals mixed with the infant's usual milk or pureed fruit and vegetables, meat and fish. Later, increasingly solid foods can be added.<br>
[0010] Many mothers, prepare complementary foods at home. It is highly unlikely, however, that these foods will supply all the calories, iron and other micronutrients needed by infants aged 6-24 months. In light of this, food manufacturers have developed calorie-optimised complementary foods enriched with micronutrients to meet these requirements. They include protein, carbohydrate and fat in varying amounts.<br>
[0011] Conventionally, in order to ensure product sterility over the shelf-life of infant food products the known food products are produced by a process wherein the ingredients are sealed in small containers (typically glass jars) within the cooking vessel under pressure and high temperature for a prolonged period until the required sterility is reached. However, this process can cause loss or degradation of heat-sensitive nutrients. A schematic showing a conventional process of sterilization is illustrated in figure 1.<br>
[0012] The traditional cooking techniques, for example retorting, sterilize foods but at the cost of losing nutrients, taste quality and visual properties. Retorting accelerates to some extent destruction of heat-labile nutrients, including vitamin C, beta-carotene, thiamin, and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the presence of residual oxygen. Taste qualities are also lost during retorting as sugars are destroyed and bitter or sour tastes (eg a canned food taste) are introduced as a result of complex chemical reactions. Retorting also results in the problem of a loss of colour from the product reducing the product's visual appeal.<br>
<br>
[0013]   In addition, it is considered that infants need foods rich in essential nutrients and<br>
they should not be exposed to harmful compounds that may be generated by cooking during<br>
processing.<br>
[0014] Thus, there is a need for a new process for producing a range of food products that<br>
results in the products having more natural tastes and more nutrients retained after<br>
processing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0015]   It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a new process for producing a range of food products that results in the products having more natural tastes and more nutrients retained afier processing.<br>
[0016] These and other objects are addressed in one aspect of the invention by providing a process for producing an infant food product comprising a protein ingredient and a vegetable ingredient, the process comprising in a first stage, the step of separately cooking vegetables and separately cooking meat or fish to provide pre-cooked ingredients, and in a second stage, the pre-cooked ingredients are mixed and submitted to UHT processing at a high temperature for a short time to sterilize the product. Preferably, the product is aseptically filled into containers thereafter.<br>
[0017] Preferably, separate cooking of the vegetables is achieved by subjecting frozen vegetables to steam to defrost them quickly and at the same time 'gently' cook them. Advantagously, this results in minimal destruction of the plant cell structure, minimal adverse chemical reactions and reduced leaching of water soluble vitamins. [0018] Preferably, separate cooking of the meat or fish is achieved by fiying the meat or fish.<br>
[0019] In addition, by pre-cooking the vegetables, and frying the meat or fish separately, their own distinct flavour profiles are generated / achieved. Combining them to produce the final product before UHT processing provides the added benefit of improving the taste profile of the product.<br>
[0020] Sterilisation of the food product is achieved by UHT (Ultra High Temperature) processing which (because the high temperature treatment is carried out for a short time) causes minimal vitamin loss and minimal chemical reactions of heat-sensitive chemical compounds in the food product. Advantagously, the loss of heat-sensitive vitamins and generation of reaction products has been found to be significantly less following the process of the invention compared to the traditional retorting process typically used for production<br>
<br>
of infant food products.   Furthermore, the invention provides the advantage of intense<br>
retention of flavours and tastes from the individual ingredients used. The range of products<br>
produced according to the invention have a range of distinct tastes and they taste less like<br>
stew.<br>
[0021] It has been found that the new approach to cooking and sterilizing the food product<br>
according to the invention subjects the components of the food to a milder heat treatment. In<br>
addition,   vegetables   are   cooked   separately   from   the   other   ingredients,   allowing<br>
individualized cooking times according to the types of vegetable present. This provides the<br>
advantage that merging of flavours is prevented during early processing.<br>
[0022]   In addition, the cooking technique of the invention preserves vegetable tastes and<br>
nutrient content, and UHT heat treatment minimizes cooking time so that sterility is<br>
achived, but chemical reactions which occur in the food during processing are minimized.<br>
[0023]   Furthermore, results of sensory analysis and vitamin analysis tests have revealed<br>
that the process of the invention retains individual flavours of the ingredients. In addition,<br>
the invention provides the advantage that the natural sweetness of the ingredients used is<br>
retained, sour flavours are not introduced during processing, higher levels of thiamin are<br>
maintained after processing, polyunsaturated fatty acids are maintained, and development of<br>
complex chemical compounds during processing is minimised.<br>
[0024]    In addition, the invention provides the advantage that the process provides a<br>
healthier product than a comparative product produced by conventional retorting.<br>
[0025]   Other and further objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be<br>
readily apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>

embodiments may be variously combined or separated without parting fi-om the invention<br>
The Invention [0043] In one aspect, the invention provides a process for producing an infant food product comprising a protein ingredient and a vegetable ingredient wherein, in a first stage, a vegetable ingredient is cooked, and a protein ingredient is cooked separately fi-om the vegetable ingredient to provide pre-cooked ingredients, and in a second stage, the precooked ingredients are mixed and submitted to UHT processing at a temperature of about 130°C to about 140°C for a time of about 30 seconds to about 240 seconds to sterilize the product.<br>
[0044] Preferably, the vegetable ingredient comprises at least one, vegetable. More preferably, the vegetable ingredient comprises at least two or three vegetables. [0045] Preferably, separate cooking of the vegetable ingredient is achieved by subjecting frozen or fresh vegetables to steam treatment. This provides the advantage that if the vegetables are frozen, they are defrosted quickly. In addition, nutrients are not leached from the vegetables. Furthermore, advantageously, the vegetables are subjected to steam treatment for a time depending on the vegetable used.<br>
[0046]   Preferably, at least two varieties of vegetables are cooked separately from each other and mixed after cooking.<br>
<br>
[0047] Preferably, the vegetables are cooked for a time of about 1 minute to about 5 minutes at about 85°C to about 95°C. This has the advantage of 'gently' cooking the vegetables. Advantagously, this results in minimal destruction of the plant cell structure, minimal adverse chemical reactions and reduced leaching of water soluble vitamins. [0048] Preferably, the protein ingredient comprises a source of protein selected from meat and fish.<br>
[0049]   By separately cooking the vegetable ingredients, and the meats, the meats can be fried to generate the meat flavours and the vegetables cooked separately to avoiding the blending of vegetable flavours, giving more intense flavours and reducing nutrient losses. [0050]  Preferably, separate cooking of the meat or fish is achieved by frying or pressure-cooking the meat or fish. In one embodiment, meat is fiied together with onions. [0051] Preferably the meat or fish is fiied or pressure-cooked for about 10 minutes. [0052] Preferably, the meat or fish is fiied for a time depending on the meat or fish used. This is advantageous because the frying time can be tailored to provide the best result for the meat or fish used, hi addition, in contrast to the traditional retorting process, the meat or fish flavour is not mixed with vegetable flavours until after the vegetables have been cooked.<br>
[0053] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a pasta or a cereal based ingredient, eg rice, is cooked separately from the vegetable ingredient and the protein ingredient, and it is mixed or used as a bed or base for the pre-cooked ingredients.<br>
[0054] Preferably, the infant food products for infants from about 4 to about 6 months of age (Stage 1) comprise one or more vegetables selected from artichoke, carrot, cucumber, fennel, French bean, leek, lettuce, parsnip, potato, pumpkin, squash and zucchini.

[0076]   In a preferred embodiment the process additionally includes sterilizing packaging<br>
(aseptic filling technology) for the food product and filing the packaging with the food<br>
product under an aseptic enviromnent. Advantagously, the filled packaging is not subjected<br>
to high heat treatment with the product and packaging does not take place at high<br>
temperature. This process is ideally suited for new packaging materials such as plastics (eg<br>
polypropylene). This provides the advantage that glass containers are not required -<br>
migration from the seal between the glass and the cap to the food product is reduced and the<br>
risk of glass splinters being introduced to the food product is removed.   In addition, the<br>
packaging material is easy to sterilize.  In particular, the removal of hydrogen peroxide is<br>
difficult to achieve in preformed containers.<br>
[0077] Preferably, the containers for the food product are produced in the same production<br>
line as the food product so that the production of the containers for the food product is an<br>
integral part of the process. This provides the advantage that the containers are formed just<br>
prior to filling with food product and the risk of contamination is reduced.<br>
[0078] In a fiirther aspect, the invention provides a range of infant food products produced<br>
according to the invention.<br>
[0079]   Preferably, the range of products comprises at least one food product suitable for<br>
each stage of infant development.<br>
[0080] Preferably, the range of products comprises two or more food products suitable for<br>
each stage of infant development. More preferably, the range of products comprises at least<br>
a vegetable based product and a fruit based product for each stage of infant development.<br>
More preferably, the range of products comprises a plurality of vegetable based products<br>
and fruit based products for each stage of infant development.<br>
<br>
[0081] Preferably, the range of products comprises at least a vegetable based product and a<br>
fruit based product for stage 1 of infant development.<br>
[0082]   Preferably, the range of products comprises at least a vegetable based product, a<br>
complete meal and a fruit based product for stage 2 of infant development.<br>
[0083]   Preferably, the range of products comprises at least a vegetable based product, a<br>
complete meal and a fruit based product for stage 3 of infant development.<br>
[0084]   Preferably, the range of products comprises at least a vegetable based product, a<br>
complete meal and a fruit based product for stage 4 of infant development.<br>
[0085] In a further aspect, the invention provides equipment suitable for producing a range<br>
of infant food products according to the invention.<br>
[0086]   Preferably, the equipment comprises a cooker for cooking vegetables, a frier for<br>
frying meat or fish, a mixer, UHT apparatus, and apparatus for cold aseptic filling of aseptic<br>
containers with the food product wherein the UHT apparatus comprises tubing for moving<br>
food product from the mixer to the apparatus for cold aseptic filling and preferably a<br>
texturizer.<br>
[0087]   Preferably, the tube comprises a conduit annular in cross section for carrying out<br>
UHT treatment on food products having solid pieces (Stage 3 and Junior Stage products) or<br>
a plurality of conduits circular in cross-section for carrying out UHT treatment on<br>
homogenous food products (Stage 1 and Stage 2 products).<br>
[0088] In other aspects, the invention provides a range of products produced using the<br>
process of the invention and the product produced using the apparatus of the invention.<br>
[0089]  A traditional process for producing infant food products comprises sterilization of<br>
the product and packaging in glass jars. This is shown schematically in Figure 1. Compared<br>
to the known process, the process of the invention requires a lower overall heat treatment of<br>
the product to attain sterility. A process according to the invention is shown schematically<br>
in Figure 2. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that this results from the<br>
fact that the rate of increase in heat inactivation of micro-organisms (F-value) with the<br>
increase in temperature is greater than the rate of increase of cooking reactions. So that the<br>
FO (sterility) is reached in a shorter period of time by a high rate of heating and final<br>
temperature, and the product will have received less total cooking than if the rate of heating<br>
is low and the FO requires a long time to reach sterility. (The FO value is a known measure<br>
of the time required to kill Clostridium botulinum bacteria).<br>

Tests and Data [0094]  In order to study the impact of the process of the invention on the quality of final products a number of studies have been carried out as follows.<br>
1)	Retention of thiamin (vitamin Bl - a key heat-sensitive nutrient).<br>
2)	Evaluation of the "cooking value" of retorting versus UHT processing<br>
Both of these tests demonstrate the lower destruction of ingredients/ nutrients in the products produced according to the invention.<br>
3)	Furan formation.<br>
This undesirable by-product of the cooking process can be demonstrated to be lower in the products produced according to the invention.<br>
4)	Retention of product colour.<br>
The thermal processing of a food product, to achieve sterility, often results in the degredation of the colour of key raw materials. This is a key visual quality parameter noted by the consumer.<br>
1) Retention of Thiamin (Vitamin Bl) [0095] Using a heat-sensitive nutrient as a 'tracer' in the product to evaluate process losses is a well recognised methodology in food science. Thiamin (vitamin Bl) was chosen as a key heat-sensitive nutrient for in-depth evaluation. Since the natural level of this nutrient is low in the final product the amounts used were fortified for the purpose of the test. [0096] A study was carried out using four different product types. All products were fortified with levels of thiamin between 0.7 and 1 mg/ lOOg. Each product was cooked by retorting in glass jars and by the process of the invention and then the resulting retention of thiamin compared. The results are shown in Figure 3.<br>
<br>
[0097] The results show:<br>
Average retention of thiamin post-retorting in glass jars was 67%.<br>
Average retention of thiamin post-processing according to the invention was 89%. [0098] Thus, it is clear that the process of the invention significantly reduced the losses of thiamin retaining 89% of the thiamin added to the products. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that this improved retention according to the invention is achieved because:<br>
a)	the process of the invention minimizes leaching of water-soluble vitamins, as occurs if the ingredients are cooked in excess water;<br>
b)	the destmciion of the food matrix is limited i.e. it is a gentle process;<br>
c)	the heat treatment is significantly less using the process of the invnetion compared to conventional retorting;<br>
d)	The lower heat treatment in a process according to the invention compared to retorted products in glass jars, and the use of separate pre-cooking of the ingredients helps to preserve the water-soluble and heat-sensitive vitamins at a higher level and preserve more of the natural ingredient.<br>
2) Evaluation of Cooking Value [0099] Products can be evaluated for the effect of temperature and time (calculated cooking value- C value) on product quality parameters ( e.g. texture, taste, colour, nutrient content). Some degradation of quality parameters occurs with the achievement of process sterilization values (FO) during a thermal process. Products with a lower C-value have less destruction of their ingredients and nutrients and give a better appearance visually. [0100] A study was carried out with a cod and mixed vegetable savoury meal to evaluate the impact of process conditions on the cooking value.<br>
[0101] Figure 4, shows that at all three FO (product sterility) values, retorting of the same product gave a higher C-value than processing according to the invention. In fact, at the highest sterilization value (F0= 100) the UHT-processed product has a significantly lower C-value than the same product cooked and sterilized by retorting. This demonstrates that over a wide range of sterilization conditions UHT processing provides is superior results to a similar process retorting.<br>
<br>
[0102] Furans are heterocyclic organic compounds derived from thermal decomposition of<br>
large aromatic molecules in food. They are typically measured as an example of the<br>
formation of advanced glycosylation end products (AGE's) in a food matrix. Lx)ng chain<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) and vitamin C are key precursors of furans in dry<br>
and aqueous food systems. The furan compounds formed in foods vary widely in their<br>
toxicity but in general they are known to impair growth and development (especially the<br>
immune and nervous system) and may, over time, lead to cancer. Thus, foods having low<br>
furan concentrations are desired. Measurement of the formation of furans during processing<br>
according to the invention was therefore used as a marker for over-processing and the<br>
formation of AGEs.<br>
[0103] A study was carried out to observe the effect of processing on fish oil (a rich source<br>
of LC-PUFAs) and vitamin C added into the matrix of the product. The aim of the study<br>
was to measure the amount of fiiran formed during processing of a food product.<br>
[0104] The product used in the study was a vegetable and veal savoury meal with/ without<br>
added fish oil and vitamin C.<br>
[0105]   Figure 5 shows the level of furan measured in each of the three products after<br>
subjecting  the  product  to   thermal   processing  involving  conventional   retorting  and<br>
processing according to the invention.<br>
[0106] Remarkably, even when the process of the invention was used to "overprocess" the<br>
food product by carrying out UHT treatment for an extended period, furan production was<br>
reduced compared to a similar product produced by retorting. The results show that the<br>
addition of fish oil and vitamin C resulted in higher levels of furans being produced but this<br>
effect was not dose-dependent.<br>
[0107]   For comparison, a food product having the same ingredients as a food product<br>
produced according to the invention was processed by retorting.   This resulted in a food<br>
product having increased fiiran concentrations, with a  100 % increase in production<br>
following the addition of fish oil, and a further small increase at a higher level of fish oil<br>
addition.<br>
[0108] To study the effect of over-processing further a second study was carried out.<br>
[0109]   A vegetable product including carrots and a savoury product including cod and<br>
mixed vegetables were evaluated for furans at three levels of heat treatment. The results are<br>
shown in Figures 6 and 7 respectively.<br>
<br>
[0110]   In the first test, the food product was processed by retorting at high sterilization conditions - highest sterilization treatment (in the figure this is represented by F0=100). [0111 j   In the second test, the food product was processed by retorting at intermediate sterilization conditions - intermediate sterilization (in the figure this is represented by F0=15).<br>
[0112]   In the third test, the food product was processed by retorting at low sterilization conditions - lowest sterilization treatment (in the figure this is represented by F0=8). [0113]    For direct comparison, products having the same ingredients were processed according to the invention and the temperature for UHT treatment was varied. [0114] The results showed that:<br>
a)	Processing the food product by retorting to an F0=100 resulted in a high level of furan in both the vegetable and the savoury products. This level of FO is not typical (typical values are between F0=8 and F0=15) but was used to test the products under extreme conditions to measure furan formation;<br>
b)	As indicated in Figures 6 &amp; 7, only low levels of furans were developed following processing according to the invention at both F0=8 and 15.<br>
c)	In all tests, the savoury meal had higher levels of fiiran after processing than the vegetable recipe (possibly due to the presence of naturally occurring LC-PUFAs), but these differences were small compared to the effect of heat treatment on the product as shown by the comparisons between a food product processed by retorting versus a food product having the same ingredients produced according to the invention.<br>
4) Product colour retention. [0115] Some of the key raw materials in food products are vegetables (and fruits) which are naturally brightly coloured. The existence of these colours in the final product is an indication to a consumer that the product is of a high quality. In view of this, there is a need for products that retain the natural colour of the ingredients after processing. [0116] A study was carried out on a range of savoury meal products to evaluate the impact of thermal processing on colour. The trimulus colour parameters L, a and b were recorded using a Color Sphere, as indicators of the product colour characteristic. The products were evaluated before processing and then after both retorting and processing according to the invention. Figure 8 shows the results obtained in a Lab color space diagram.<br>
<br>
[0117] The following table shows the results in numeric form of the impact on colour after processing. "Before HT" shows the values obtained before heat treatment. "UHT" shows the values obtained after processing according to the invention and "Retort" shows the values obtained after processing the product by conventional retorting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[0118] The total Hunter colour difference Delta E which combines L, a and b is commonly used to compare the overall colour difference between two products. The colour difference Delta E before and after heat treatment was higher for the products processed by conventional retorting than for all products having the same ingredients produced by processing according to the invention.<br>
(01191 This clearly demonstrates that products were found to retain their natural colour better following processing according to the invention compared to products having the same ingredients, but processed by conventional retorting.<br>
<br>
[0120] The high levels of heat treatment required by retorting food products leads to an increase in Maillard reactions with the development of more intense 'meaty' flavours. However, prolonged cooking can also develop complex chemical compounds with bitter or sour tastes. Tastes referred to as "off-notes" (eg a canned food taste) can develop. For example, vegetables can develop a rancid off-taste by the activity of lipoxygenase which is suppressed by freezing.<br>
[0121] Sensory analysis of food products processed according to the invention compared to food products produced using the same ingredients, but processed by conventional retorting demonstrates specific taste differences. The test results of sensory profiling are shown in Figure 10. The results show the differences in the sensory profiles between a retorted product comprising lamb, green vegetables and potato and product produced according to the invention having the same ingredients. [0122]   In summary, the results of the sensory analysis show:<br>
■	Product processed according to the invention:<br>
-	aroma: more starch-like, more sweet<br>
-	texture mouth: more dry<br>
-	flavour: more pea-like, more sweet, more flour-like<br>
-	after taste: more starch-like, more dry<br>
■	Product processed by conventional retorting:<br>
-	appearance: more dark, more orange pieces<br>
-	aroma: more lamb-like, more sour, more well-seasoned<br>
-	flavour: more sour, more lamb-like, more salty<br>
-	after taste: more sour, more lingering<br>
