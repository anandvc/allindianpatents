SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Even though many of herbicides for rice have been recently developed and used, barnyard grass among weeds is the biggest problem in rice paddy.<br>
Development of herbicides to control barnyard grass is an urgent to one who is in the field of agriculture. After transplanting young rice, herbicides, developed until now, cannot effectively control the production of barnyard grass so that it causes a huge damage to harvest. It has been reported that when barnyard grass is produced for one week in 1 m2, amount of harvest decreases by 2%, for 5 weeks by about 10%, for 10 weeks by 19% and for 20 weeks by 35%.<br>
Many  herbicides  have  been  used  for  the  purpose  of  controlling barnyard grass that damages in amount of harvest of rice. However, the herbicide  with a broader herbicidal  activity,         environmentally-friendly property and cost-effectiveness is still in demand.<br>
The inventors have intensively studied to prepare herbicides to effectively control barnyard grass. As a result, they completed this invention to find a novel phenoxypropionic acid N-alkyl-N-2-fluorophenyl amide and its derivatives that are stable to rice and selectively control barnyard grass. This superior effectiveness is distinguished from the conventional inventions.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is characterized by novel phenoxypropionic acid N-alkyl-N-2-fluorophenyl amide represented in the following formula (1) with an excellent herbicidal activity as well as selectively stable toward rice.<br>

wherein, L is lower alkyl, halogen, methoxy, methoxyphenoxy, methylthio or methylvinyl group; n is an integer of 0 to 2.<br>
JP Patent publication sho 53-40767 and sho 54-112828 also disclose that phenoxypropionic acid amide derivatives have herbicidal activity.<br>
However, none of reports including the patents mentioned above has taught a method for preparing the compounds in the above formula (1) and tested the same against herbicidal activity. And also it has not been reported that the compounds have superior herbicidal activity and selectivity toward rice and control barnyard grass produced from rice.<br>

heated at reflux for 2 hours. Excess of thionyl chloride was removed under reduced pressure and 3 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran was added to it. A solution of N-methyl-2,3,6-trifluoroaniline(0.32 g, 2 mmol) and triethyl amine(0.42 mi) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran(10 m-d) was added slowly to the reaction mixture at 0°C. The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 30 minutes and stirred at room temperature for additional 1 hour. After pouring water the reaction mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic solvent layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography(eluent: ethyl acetate/n-hexane = 1/2) to afford 240 rag of the target product. iH-NMRfCDCb): 8 1.45(3H, d), 3.25(3H, s),4.6(lH, q), 6.7~7.4(9H, m)<br>

Formulation<br>
In order to use the compounds according to the present invention as herbicides, they should be formulated in such a suitable type such as wettable powder, emulsions, granules, dusts, suspensions and solutions by combining a carrier, a surfactant, a dispersing agent or a supplement agent. Many of these may be applied directly or after diluted with suitable media. Formulations can be prepared at spray volume of from hundreds liters to thousands liters per hectare. The formulations contain about 0.1% to 99% by weight of active ingredient(s) and 0.1% to 20% surfactant(s) or 0% to 99.9% solid or liquid<br>
diluent(s)   are   recommended   to   be   added. The formulations will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions shown in Table 3.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
(Table 3 Removed)<br>
The proportion of active ingredients is depending on the intended use. Higher ratios of a surfactant to active ingredients are sometimes desirable and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or tank mixing.<br>
Solid diluents with high absorption are preferred for wettable powders. Liquid diluents and solvents are preferably stable against phase separation at 0°C. All the formulations may contain a small amount of additives to prevent forming, caking, corrosion and growth of microorganisms.<br>
According to conventional methods to prepare the composition, solutions can be made only by blending ingredients and fine solids by blending and pulverizing with hammer-mill . Suspensions can be made by wet-milling and granules can be made by spraying the active ingredients on performed granular carrier.<br>

Utility<br>
The compounds according to the present invention represent high activity as leaf treatment herbicides for rice and especially effective in rice due to an excellent control of barnyard grass.<br>
The active ingredients can be used from 10 g to 4 kg per hectare, preferably from 50 g to 400 g. The amount of the compounds of the present invention depends on the amount and size of weeds and formulations.<br>
azimsulfruon,   cyclosulfamuron   and   pyanchor.<br>
The herbicidal effect of the compounds of this invention was tested and the examples are as follows.<br>
Experimental example 1: Leaf treatment test<br>
Seeds of rice, wheat, barley, corn, cotton, barnyard grass, common sorgum, large crabgrass and fall panicum were seeded at a pot with a surface area of 600 erf. When barnyard grass kept at 20 ~ 30 °C had three leaves, wettable powders prepared by mixing 1 weight part of the active compound, 5 weight part of acetone and 1 weight part of emulsifier and diluted with water was applied directly on the leaves in 2000 i per hectare. The concentration of the spray liquid was so chosen the particular amounts of the active compound desired. 14 days after the treatment, the degree of damage to the plants was rated in % damage in comparison to the development of untreated control.<br>
0%       no action (like untreated control)<br>
20%     slight effect<br>
70%     herbicidal effect<br>
100%    total destruction<br>
In the test, the active compound(s) of the formula (1) according to the invention exhibited an excellent selectivity toward the plants and herbicidal activity against weeds.<br>
The plants employed in this test are as follows.<br>
Table 4<br><br>
(Table 4 Removed)<br>
Among the compounds of the formula (1), herbicidal activity of the compounds in table 5 is represented in the following table 6 and 7.<br>

Chuchong(ORYSA)] and barnyard grass [Echinocgloa crus-galli beauv. var. caudate Kitagawa(ECHCG) and Echinocgloa crus-galli Beauv. var. orygicola Ohwi (ECHOR)] were planted and grown. The test compounds with 98% purity was dissolved in acetone containing tween-20 and diluted with water. Each maximum concentration of acetone and tween-20 were 25% and 0.1%.<br>
The solution was sprayed in a proportion of 200 g a.i per hactare on the leaves. When rice{ORYSA} had 6.0 - 6.5 leaves with 32.8 cm of the first leaf, barnyard grass(ECHOR) had 1 — 2 tillering with 37.3 cm of the first leaf and barnyard grass(ECHCG) had 1 — 2 tillering with 44.4 cm of the first leaf.<br>
20 and 30 days after treatment (DAT) herbicidal effect and toxicity were measured. The result is represented in the following table 8.<br>
