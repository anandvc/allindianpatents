				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to brush seals for rotary machines, such as steam and gas turbines, and, more particularly, is concerned with an arrangement and method for accurately radially locating a brush seal at a desired position relative to a rotor of the machine.<br>
Rotary machines, such as steam and gas turbines, used for power generation and mechanical drive applications are generally large machines having multiple turbine stages. In turbines, high pressure fluid flowing through the turbine stages must pass through a series of stationary and rotary components, and seals typically are used between the stationary and rotating components to minimize leakage of the fluid. The efficiency of the turbine is dependent on the ability of the seals to prevent fluid leakage.<br>
Traditionally, one type of seal that is used to control fluid leakage in turbines is a labyrinthjseaj_which has sharp rigid teeth. While the labyrinth seal has proven to be quite reliable, its performance degrades over time. This occurs as a result of transient events in which the stationary and rotating components move radially relative to and thus interfere with one another causing rubbing on the teeth of the labyrinth seal so as to enlarge the clearance between the stationary and rotating components and allow increase of leakage.<br>
Another type of seal that is used in combination with the labyrinth seal to improve leakage control is a brush seal. The brush seal is generally less prone to leakage than the labyrinth seal because the brush seal has seal bristles that can flex and thus better accommodate the relative radial movement between the stationary<br><br>
and rotating components. The brush seal also generally conforms better to surface non-uniformities than does the labyrinth seal. Such combination brush and labyrinth seal arrangements are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,749,584 to Skinner et al. assigned to General Electric<br>
	Company, the assignee of the present invention,  and  U.K.  Pat.<br>
Application No. 2,301,635 to Hemsley et al assigned to GEC Alsthom<br>
Limited.<br>
In combination brush and labyrinth seal arrangements, accurate radial positioning of the brush seal relative to the rotor must be achieved in order to gain optimum performance while not adversely affecting rotordynamics. In the current method of assembly, a slot is provided in the labyrinth seal to receive the brush seal. The cross-sectional size of the slot is larger than the cross-sectional size of the portion of the brush seal that is received in the slot to facilitate the ease of mounting of the brush seal to the labyrinth seal. The larger cross-sectional size of the slot results in there being sufficient radial clearance between the brush seal and labyrinth seal to allow the brush seal to "float" radially within the slot, making it difficult to accurately align the brush seal to the rotor. The current method may allow the seal radial position to vary by several thousandths of an inch over its arc length. These variations may reduce the desired seal performance.<br>
Consequently, a need exists for an innovation which will provides an effective solution to the aforementioned problem without introducing any new problems in place thereof.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an arrangement and method for accurately radially locating a turbine brush seal which are designed to satisfy the aforementioned need. The arrangement and method of the<br><br>
present invention provide the brush seal at a desired position relative to the rotor so as to enhance seal performance. The current method of assembly of the brush seal to the labyrinth seal is generally retained but without allowing the brush seal to "float" radially within the slot of the labyrinth seal. Instead, once the brush seal is inserted into the slot of the labyrinth seal and positioned circumferentially relative thereto, set screws are then used to force the brush seal into the desired radial position relative to the labyrinth seal. This seemingly simple added element of the arrangement and step of the method permits the achievement of total control circumferentially and radially of the location of the brush seal relative to the labyrinth seal.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, an arrangement and method are provided for accurately radially locating a turbine brush seal relative to a main seal, such as a labyrinth seal, and a turbine rotor. The arrangement and method employ a main seal segment and a brush seal segment. The main seal segment has a slot open toward the rotor and defining an interior ledge facing away from the rotor. The brush seal segment has an exterior shoulder facing toward the rotor and a portion smaller in size cross-sectionally than the slot so as to allow insertion of the brush seal segment into the slot where'the shoulder of the brush seal segment overlies the interior ledge of the main seal segment and the brush seal segment can move radially relative to the main seal segment and rotor and the shoulder of the brush seal segment can move toward and away from the interior ledge of the main seal segment. The arrangement and method further employ means for forcing the brush seal segment toward the rotor such that spaced apart locations on the shoulder of the brush seal segment are brought into contact with spaced apart locations on the ledge of the main seal segment so as to place and maintain the shoulder of the brush seal segment in substantial engagement with the<br><br>
ledge of the main seal segment and thereby prevent radial floating of the brush seal segment relative to the main seal segment and rotor.<br>
The main seal segment has an arcuate shape for placing the main seal segment about the rotor, an outer periphery facing away from the rotor, an inner periphery spaced radially inwardly from the outer periphery and facing toward the rotor, and a slot defined in the main seal segment between the outer and inner peripheries thereof. The slot has a radial portion open at the inner periphery and extending away from the rotor toward the outer periphery and an axial portion spaced from the outer and inner peripheries and merging in a transverse relationship from a side of the radial portion along the rotor so as to define the interior ledge in the main seal segment facing away from the rotor. The brush seal segment has an arcuate shape for conforming to the arcuate-shaped main seal segment, a radial section, and an axial section connected to and merging in a transverse relationship from a side of the radial section so as to define the exterior shoulder on the brush seal segment facing toward the rotor such that the radial and axial sections of the brush seal segment conform in shape to the radial and axial portions of the slot of the main seal segment as to slidably fit therein with the brush seal segment being movable radially relative to the main seal segment and rotor and with the shoulder of the brush seal segment overlying and being movable toward and away from the interior ledge of the main seal segment. The means for forcing the brush seal segment toward the rotor includes at least two threaded holes extending through the main seal segment to the slot at spaced apart locations on the main seal segment and at least two screws each being tightened into one of the threaded holes of the main seal segment and into contact with the spaced apart locations on the brush seal segment so as to place and<br><br>
maintain the shoulder of the brush seal segment substantially engaged with the ledge of the main seal segment.<br>
The present invention, therefore, provides a device for accurately locating a turbine brush seal relative to a turbine rotor, comprising:<br>
-	a main seal segment  having a slot open towards a turbine rotor and<br>
defining an interior ledge facing away from the rotor;<br>
-	a brush seal segment having an exterior shoulder facing toward the<br>
rotor and a portion smaller in size cross-sectionally than said slot of<br>
said main seal segment so as to allow insertion of said brush seal<br>
segment into said slot such that said shoulder of said brush seal<br>
segment overlies said interior ledge of said main seal segment and<br>
said brush seal segment can move radially relative to said main seal<br>
segment and rotor and said shoulder of said brush seal segment can<br>
move toward and away from said interior ledge of said main seal<br>
segment; and<br>
means for forcing said brush seal segment toward the rotor such that spaced apart locations on said shoulder of said brush seal segment are brought into contact with spaced apart locations on said ledge of said main sea! segment so as to place and maintain said shoulder of said brush seal segment in substantial engagement with said ledge of said main seal segment and thereby prevent radial floating of said brush seal segment relative to said main seal segment and to the rotor.<br><br>

FIG. 1 is a top plan view of a seal arrangement of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 2 is a side elevational view of the seal arrangement of FIG.1.<br>
FIG. 3 is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the seal arrangement taken along line 3-3 of FIG. 2.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 1 to 3 of the drawings, there is illustrated a seal arrangement of the present invention, generally designated 10, for accurately locating an annular brush seal 12 relative to an annular main seal 14, such as a labyrinth seal, and to a turbine shaft or rotor R. The annular labyrinth seal 14 is mounted in a turbine housing H and extends about the rotor R which is supported by conventional means, not shown, within the turbine housing H. The labyrinth seal 14 is disposed between the rotating rotor R and stationary housing H and includes a seal ring 16 disposed about the rotor R separating high and low pressure regions on axially opposite sides of the ring 16. It will be appreciated that while only one seal ring 16 is disclosed, typically multiple-stage labyrinth seals are provided about the rotor R.<br>
Each seal ring 16 is formed of an annular array of a plurality of arcuate-shaped main seal segments 18 having sealing faces 20 and a plurality of radially projecting, axially spaced teeth 22. In one example, the teeth 22 are of a hi-lo design for obtaining close clearances with radial projections or ribs 24 and grooves 26 on the rotor R. The<br><br>
labyrinth seal 14 functions by placing a relatively large number of barriers, i.e., the teeth 22, to the flow of fluid from a high pressure region to a low pressure region on opposite sides of the seal 16, with each barrier forcing the fluid to follow a tortuous path.<br>
The annular brush seal 12 is formed of an annular array of a plurality of arcuate-shaped brush seal segments 28 incorporated as a retrofit to or as original equipment in the labyrinth seal 14. One or more teeth 22 of the labyrinth seal 14 are removed and replaced with the brush seal 12. As seen in FIG. 3, a centrally-located labyrinth seal tooth 22 is removed and a slot 30 is formed in the seal ring 16 in its place for receiving the brush seal segments 28 therein. Each of the brush seal segments 28 making up the brush seal 12 has a plurality of bristles 32 which engage the rotor R about the circumference thereof.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the arrangement 10 of the present invention basically includes a brush seal segment 28, a main seal segment 18 and means 34 for forcing the brush seal segment 28 toward the. rotor R. The main seal segment 18 has the slot 30 which is open toward the rotor R and defines an interior ledge 36 facing away from the rotor R. The brush seal segment 28 defines an exterior shoulder 38 facing toward the rotor R and has a portion 28A which is smaller in size cross-sectionally than the slot 30 so as to allow insertion of the portion 28A of the brush seal segment 28 into the slot 30 such that the exterior shoulder 38 of the brush seal segment 28 overlies the interior ledge 36 of the main seal segment 18, the brush seal segment 28 can move radially relative to the main seal segment 18 and rotor R, and the exterior shoulder 38 of the brush seal segment 28 can move toward and away from the interior ledge 36 of the main seal segment 18. The means 34 for forcing the brush seal segment 28 toward the rotor R brings the shoulder 38 of the brush seal segment 28 at least at two spaced apart locations 38A, 38B thereon into contact with at least<br><br>
two spaced apart locations 36A, 36B on the ledge 36 of the main seal segment 18 so as to place and maintain the shoulder 38 of the brush seal segment 28 in substantial engagement with the ledge 36 of the main seal segment 18 and thereby prevent radial floating of the brush seal segment 28 relative to the main seal segment 18 and rotor R.<br>
More particularly, the main seal segment 18 is arcuate shaped for placing the main seal segment 18 about the curvature of the rotor R and has an outer periphery 40 facing away from the rotor R, an inner periphery 42 spaced radially inwardly from the outer periphery 40 and facing toward the rotor R and the slot 30 defined in the main seal segment 18 between the outer and inner peripheries 40, 42 thereof. The slot 30 has a radial portion 30A and an axial portion 306. The radial portion 30A is open at the inner periphery 42 of the main seal segment 18 and extends away from the rotor R toward the outer periphery 40. The axial portion 306 is spaced from the outer and inner peripheries 40, 42 of the main seal segment 18 and merges in a transverse relationship from a side of the radial portion 30A along the rotor R so as to define the interior ledge 38 in the main seal segment 18 facing away from the rotor R. The brush seal segment 28 is arcuate-shaped for conforming to the arcuate-shaped main seal segment 18 and has a radial section 286 and an axial section 28C. The axial section 28C is connected to and merges in a transverse relationship from a side of the radial section 286 so as to define the exterior shoulder 36 on the brush seal segment 28 facing toward the rotor R such that the radial and axial sections 286, 28C of the brush seal segment 28 conform in shape to the radial and axial portions 30A, 306 of the slot 30 of the main seal segment 18 as to slidably fit therein and the brush seal segment 28 is movable radially relative to the main seal segment 18 and rotor R and the shoulder 36 of the brush seal<br><br>
segment 28 overlies and is movable toward and away from the interior ledge 38 of the main seal segment 18.<br>
The means 34 for forcing the brush seal segment 28 toward the rotor R includes at least two threaded holes 44 and at least two set screws 46. The two threaded holes 44 extend through the main seal segment 18 to the slot 30 at spaced apart locations on the main seal segment 18 adjacent to opposite ends 18A thereof. Each of the two set screws 46 is tightened into one of the threaded holes 44 of the main seal segment 18 and into contact with the spaced apart locations on the axial section 28C of the brush seal segment 28 so as to place and maintain the shoulder 36 of the brush seal segment 28 in the substantial engagement with the ledge 38 of the main seal segment 18. By providing a set screw 46 at each end 18A of the main seal segment 18, it is assured that the brush seal segment 28 is not contacting the interior ledge 38 at one of the opposite ends 28A and a top interior surface 30C of the slot 30 opposite from the ledge 38 at the other of the opposite ends 28A. If desired, a third set screw (not shown) can be employed at the segment midpoint to further ensure contact with the interior ledge 38 on brush seal segments whose curvature may be mismatched to the labyrinth seal curvature.<br>
• It is noted that, if needed, a shim (not shown) may be disposed radially between the ledge 38 (such as at 38a and at 38b) of the main seal segment 18 and the shoulder 36 (such as at 36a and at 36b) of the brush seal segment 28 to raise the tips (i.e., the free ends) of the bristles 32 away from the rotor R for precise radial positioning of the bristles 32.<br>
It is thought that the present invention and its advantages will be understood from the foregoing description and it will be apparent that various changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention or sacrificing all of its material<br><br>
advantages, the form hereinbefore described being merely preferred or exemplary embodiment thereof.<br><br><br><br>

providing a brush seal segment (28) having an exterior shoulder (38) facing toward the rotor (R) and a portion (28A) smaller in size cross-sectionally than the slot (30) of the main seal segment (18) such that the brush seal segment (28) can slidably fit into the slot (30) of the main seal segment (18);<br>
slidably inserting the brush seal segment (28) into the slot (30) of the main seal segment (28) such that the brush seal segment (28) can move radially relative to the main seal segment (18) and rotor (R) and the shoulder (38) of the brush seal segment (28) overlies and can move toward and away from the interior ledge (36) of the main seal segment (18); and<br>
forcing the brush seal segment (28) toward the rotor (R) such that spaced apart locations on the shoulder (38) of the brush seal segment (28) are brought into contact with spaced apart locations on the ledge (36) of the main seal segment (28) so as to place and maintain the shoulder (38) of the brush seal segment (28) in substantial engagement with the ledge (36) of the main seal segment (18) and thereby prevent radial floating of the brush seal segment (28) relative to the main seal segment (18) and the rotor (R).<br>
9.	A device for accurately locating a turbine brush seal relative<br>
to a turbine rotor substantially as herein described with<br>
reference   to   and   as   illustrated   by   the   accompanying<br>
