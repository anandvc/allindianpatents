This invention relates to a device for driving the detaching rollers of textile combing machines.<br>
In conventional textile processing, combing operations are carried out to prepare cotton and wool fibres for spinning by separating and straightening the fibres. Combing also removes fibres below a specific length. Combed fibres are collected from nippers by means of detaching rollers and are fed to calendar rollers through which it is passed to ensure uniform thickness and finish. Detaching rollers are driven by rotational movement of the comb shaft which is converted to linear motion through eccentric cam shaft arrangement. Sliding joint of the eccentric cam shaft arrangement operates at a friction rate of 0.3 which leads to considerable mechanical power loss and generates enormous heat during operation or drive.<br>
Heat generated drying operation of the drive gets transferred to the libricating oil contained in the head stock which consequently reduces the life of the oil and damages the components housed in the head stock.<br>
Hence, there is a need for developing a drive system with reduced friction and consequent reduction in heat generation.<br>
Heat generated during comb shaft rotation aid conversion of rotational movement to linear motion is minimized with the help of the device developed by us.<br>
The device consists of a housing for the comb shaft. The comb shaft is eccentrically mounted within the housing . Caged bearings are provided<br><br>
at the mounting area to reduce friction during rotational movement. The outer periphery of the housing has a second caged bearing surrounding it. A third caged bearing is connected to the housing through the second caged bearing by means of an eccentrical member. This assembly is connected to the drive gear system of the textile combing machine through its swing arm. It is noticed that the eccentric mounting of the comb shaft and the first second and third set of caged bearing result in angular linkage movement of the output link. The first second and third set of bearings reduce the friction during operation to 0.003 thus avoiding heating of the components and the lubricating oil in the head stock.<br>
This invention relates to a device for driving the detaching rollers of textile machinery which comprises a housing, a shaft mounted eccentrically within said housing through a first caged bearing assembly the outer periphery of said housing being provided with a second caged bearing assembly, an eccentric member connecting said second caged bearing assembly to a third caged bearing assembly, said device being drivable connected to the drive of said textile combing machine.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the single figure in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Reference numeral (1) in the figure represents a shaft which is located within a housing (3). The first caged bearing assembly through a shaft which may be comb shaft is eccentrically mounted within the housing is<br><br>
shown by reference number (2). The bearings may be split bearings as shown in the drawings. The second caged bearing assembly is represented by nymeral (4) and is located on the outer periphery of the housing towards its inner side. An eccentric member (5) is provided on the cage of the second cased bearing assembly. This member connects a third caged bearing assembly (8) to the second caged bearing passerby'. The swing arm of the drive is represented by numeral (6). The bore of the swing arm is provided with a hard metallic ring pressed thereto.<br>
The eccentricities of comb shaft mounting and the link member between the second and third gear assembly help reduce the friction during the conversion of rotary movement to linear motion.<br>
The device when installed reduces the power consumption substantially. A major advantage is in the increase in the life of lubricants and the components of the drive system because of the reduction in friction and consequent heat generation during operation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A device for driving the detaching rollers of textile machinery' comprising a housing (3) a shaft (1) mounted eccentrically within said housing through a first caged bearing assembly (2), the outer periphery of said housing being provided with a second caged bearing assembly (4), an eccentric member (5) connecting said second caged bearing assembly to a third caged bearing assembly (8), said device being drivably connected to the drive of the textile combing machine.<br>
2.	The device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said shaft is a comb shaft.<br>
3.	The device as claimed in claims 1 and 2 wherein said device is connected to the drive of said textile combing machine through a swing arm (6).<br>
4.	The device as claimed in claim 3, wherein the bore of said swing arm has a metallic support ring (7) preferably a steel support ring.<br>
5.	The device as claimed in claims 1 to 4, wherein said first caged bearing assembly is a split caged bearing assembly.<br><br>
A device  for driving the detaching  rollers  of textile  machinery substantially as herein described and illustrated.<br><br></td>
