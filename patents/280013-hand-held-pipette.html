				<td>HAND-HELD PIPETTE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to hand-held pipettes employing axially reciprocating pistons to aspirate and dispense fluids into and out of replaceable pipette tips, and is concerned in particular with an improved actuator assembly and associated system for automatically controlling the stroke of such pistons.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Hand-held pipettes with manually driven pistons and automatic stroke control mechanisms have been known for nearly a decade. Figure 14 illustrates one such pipette 10 developed in 1994 by engineering students at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. The pipette 10 includes a piston 12 having its lower end received within a cylinder 14 configured at its distal end to accept a pipette tip (not shown). The piston 12 is acted upon by a manually operable plunger shaft 16. A collar 18 on the plunger shaft is resiliency urged against a rear stop 20 by a spring 22 acting on the piston 12. The piston is advanced into the cylinder 14 by manually depressing the plunger shaft 16 against the biasing action of the spring 22. A forward stop 24 is engageable by the collar 18 to limit the extent to which the plunger shaft can be depressed. The piston stroke "S" is thus defined by the distance between the forward and rear stops 20, 24.<br>
The rear stop 20 forms part of a frame 26 slidably mounted on a guide shaft 28 supported by the housing in parallel relationship to the plunger shaft 16. A stepper motor 30 has its output screw shaft 32 threaded through an upper part of the frame 26. The motor is operable to automatically shift the frame 26 along the guide shaft 28, resulting in a corresponding adjustment of the rear stop 20 and a corresponding adjustment to the stroke of the piston 12.<br>
 <br>
One problem with this type of automatic stroke adjustment is that when advancing the rear stop 20 towards the forward stop 24 in order to reduce the length of the piston stroke, the motor 30 must work against a gradually increasing biasing force being exerted by the spring 22. Thus, the motor either must be sized large enough to overcome this biasing force, or the plunger shaft 16 must be depressed to unload the rear stop prior to making any stroke adjustment. Larger motors contribute disadvantageous^ to the size and cost of the unit, whereas the need to preliminarily unload the rear stop unduly complicates the stroke adjustment sequence. Larger motors also consume more power, thus requiring larger batteries, which further adds to the size and weight of the unit.<br>
Another problem stems from the fact that the initial or "starting" force required to depress the plunger shaft 16 will vary, depending on the extent to which the spring 22 has been compressed in response to prior adjustments of the rear stop 20. Such variations in starting force can distract laboratory personnel from the task of precisely aspirating and dispensing fluids.<br>
The parallel arrangement of the plunger shaft 16 and motor output shaft 32 also contributes disadvantageous^ to the overall size of the housing and hence the weight of the unit, making it more expensive to manufacture and less convenient to use.<br>
The present invention has as its overall objective the provision of a hand-held manually-driven pipette incorporating an improved stroke adjustment mechanism that obviates or at least substantially minimizes the above described problems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a hand-held pipette includes a housing provided with a chamber and internal mutually spaced first and second stops. A replaceable pipette tip is arranged in fluid communication with the chamber, and a reciprocating piston<br>
 <br>
coacts with the chamber to aspirate and dispense fluids into and out of the pipette tip. An actuator assembly is operable to reciprocate the piston. The actuator assembly has an overall length subdivided into first and second sections provided respectively with first and second contact surfaces.<br>
The actuator assembly is resiliency urged into a rest position at which the first contact surface is in contact with the first stop and the second contact surface is spaced from the second stop by a control distance. The actuator assembly is arranged to reciprocate between its rest position and an advanced position at which the second contact surface is in contact with the second stop and the first contact surface is spaced from the first stop, with the stroke of the actuator assembly and the stroke of the piston being equal to the control distance.<br>
A motor-driven mechanism is arranged to displace one section of the actuator assembly relative to the other section, resulting in a corresponding change to both the overall length of the actuator assembly and the control distance.<br>
Preferred embodiments of pipettes in accordance with the present invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
With reference initially to Figures 1-6 and 10, a pipette in accordance with the present invention is generally depicted at 40. The pipette includes an outer housing 42 with a detachable cover 44. The housing 42 encloses an interior chassis 46 having a hollow guide 48 leading downwardly from an opening 50 in the top surface of the housing.<br>
A fixed collar 52 is fitted into the bottom end of the hollow guide 48. A floating collar 54 is resiliently urged by a spring 56 against an interior ledge 58 on the hollow guide 48, A tapered interior shoulder on the collar 52 defines a first stop 60, and the upper rim of floating collar 54 defines a second stop 62.<br>
A chamber 64 is aligned axially with the hollow chassis guide 48. The chamber projects downwardly from the lower end of the housing to a distal bottom end configured to releasably hold a detachable pipette tip 65.<br>
An actuator assembly includes the following axially aligned components: a stepper drive motor 66 having an output shaft with a threaded upper end 68 and an oppositely<br>
 <br>
extending bottom end 70 carrying an encoder wheel 72; a tubular sleeve 74 slidably extending through the floating collar 54 into the hollow guide 48, with its upper end externally threaded to receive a reference collar 76 and plunger 88, and its lower end internally threaded to receive the upper end 68 of the motor output shaft; an encoder housing 78 including an upper part 78a fixed to the underside of the motor 66, and a lower part 78b defining the bottom end of the actuator assembly. A piston 80 has its upper end engaged by the lower part 78b of the encoder housing, and its lower end projecting through a seal assembly 82 into the upper end of chamber 64.<br>
Although the piston 80 is shown engaged directly by the bottom end of the actuator assembly, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other means may be provided for establishing a mechanical coupling between these two components. For example, an intermediate linkage might be employed, which would be of advantage in cases where the piston and actuator assembly are not aligned axially.<br>
A tapered nose on motor 66 defines a first contact surface 84, and the lower rim of reference collar 76 defines a second contact surface 86. The actuator assembly may be viewed as being subdivided into a first section comprised of the motor 66 and encoder housing 78, and a second section comprised of the tubular sleeve 74, reference collar 76 and plunger 80, with the two sections being interconnected by the threaded upper end 68 of the motor output shaft.<br>
As can best be seen in Figures 10 and 11, at least one and preferably two parallel tension springs 90 extend between an anchor plate 92 fixed to the motor 66, and external arms 94 projecting laterally from an upper end of the hollow chassis guide 48. As shown for example in Figures 1-3 and 10, the springs 90 serve to resiliency urge the actuator assembly into a "rest*' position, at which the first contact surface 84 is in contact with the first stop 60,<br>
 <br>
and the second contact surface 86 is spaced from the second stop 62 by a control distance "S".<br>
By manually depressing plunger 88, the actuator assembly can be axially shifted against the biasing force of springs 90 from its rest position to a first advanced position as shown in Figures 7 and 11, where the second contact surface 86 is in contact with the second stop 62, and the first contact surface 84 is spaced from the first stop 60. The control distance "S" between the second contact surface and the second stop thus defines the stroke of the actuator assembly between its rest and first advanced positions, which also defines the stroke of piston 80.<br>
Fluid may be aspirated into the pipette tip 65 by advancing the actuator assembly to its first advanced position, then submerging the pipette tip into the fluid, and then allowing the actuator assembly to return to its rest position. The thus aspirated fluid may then be dispensed by again advancing the actuator assembly to its first advanced position.<br>
In order to ensure that all of the aspirated fluid has been dispensed, the piston assembly may be further advanced against the biasing action of both spring 56 and springs 90 to a second advanced or "blow out" position as shown in Figure 8. This will result in the collar 54 being temporarily dislodged axially from the ledge 58 against which it is normally biased by spring 56.<br>
The control distance "S" of the actuator assembly may be adjusted automatically by energizing the stepper motor 66 to rotate its output shaft 68 in the appropriate direction. Thus, as shown for example in Figure 9, the stepper motor may be operated to shorten the overall length of the actuator assembly by retracting the sleeve 74 through the collar 54, thus reducing the distance between the second contact surface 86 and the second stop 62, resulting in a shortened control distance. This adjustment can be made while the collar remains biased<br>
 <br>
against the internal shoulder 58 on guide 48, and without any need to first unload any component from the biasing action of springs 90.<br>
As can best be seen in Figure 4, sleeve 74 has radially outwardly projecting ribs 96 engaged in internal grooves in the collar 54, and the collar in turn has external grooves receiving radially inwardly projecting ribs 98 on the hollow chassis guide 48. This interlocking relationship prevents the sleeve 74 and collar 54 from rotating when the motor 66 is energized, without inhibiting relative axial shifting between the sleeve 74 and collar 54, and between the collar 54 and guide 48.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the encoder housing 78 has radially outwardly projecting ribs 100 received in complimentary grooves in a lower portion of the chassis 46. This interlocked relationship stabilizes the motor 66 against rotation when it is energized to effect adjustments in the length of the actuator assembly.<br>
The motor 66 is connected by a flexible connector 102 to a battery 104 which may be conveniently accessed by removing cover 44. The motor is controlled by a system with a feedback loop which includes the encoder wheel 72 carried by the lower end 70 of the motor output shaft. An optical sensor 106 is connected by connector 102 to a microprocessor on a PC board 108. As can be best seen in Figure 5, the encoder wheel has radially projecting teeth 110 separated by slots 112. One of teeth 110' has double the width of the others, and is disposed 180° from a double width slot 112'.<br>
The optical sensor includes a light source 114 and a photo cell 116 arranged respectively on opposite sides of the encoder wheel 72. The encoder wheel teeth and slots 110,112 are aligned between the two sensor elements 114,116.<br>
With this arrangement, the photocell 116 generates position signals responsive to the light and dark patterns generated by rotation of the encoder wheel 72. The position signals are fed back to the microprocessor. The double width tooth 110' and slot 112' each provide<br>
 <br>
positive reference locations 180° apart. Preferably, the total number of teeth 110 and slots 112 equals the number of steps per revolution of the stepper motor 66, thus making it possible to recognize every step movement of the motor.<br>
The control system will count each step of motor rotation, and will look for the appearance of the double width tooth 110' and slot 112' at expected intervals. Failure of the double width tooth or slot to appear at its expected interval will provide an indication that the pipette is in need of resetting, thereby enabling the control system to correct itself by relocating the respective double width tooth or slot at its expected location.<br>
The stepper motor 66 may be operated in response to command signals input manually on an external key pad, and/or by audible commands received via a microphone 118 and processed by a voice recognition system embodied in the microprocessor.<br>
Figures 12 and 13 disclose a modified embodiment of the invention in which the lower end of the flexible connector 102 terminates at a fixed bifurcated terminal 120. A contact plate 122 is electrically connected to both the optical sensor 106 and the motor 66. When the piston assembly is in its retracted rest position as shown in Figure 12, a button 124 at the upper end of contact plate 122 is resiliently and electrically engaged between the bifurcated arms of terminal 120, thus closing the circuit and allowing stroke adjustments to be made.<br>
When the plunger 88 is depressed during an aspirating and dispensing cycle, as shown for example in Figure 13, the connection between plate 122 and terminal 120 is broken, but this is of no import because stroke adjustments are not made during aspiration and dispensing cycles.<br>
In light of the foregoing, it will now be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the present invention provides significant advantages over previously developed pipettes of the type illustrated for example in Figure 14.<br>
 <br>
Of particular significance is the departure from stop adjustments in favor of adjustments to the length of the actuator assembly, thus making it possible to effect piston stroke adjustments without first having to relieve the biasing forces being exerted by spring components. Axial alignment of the piston, operating plunger and stepper motor favors compactness, which in turn reduces costs and enhances the ease with which the pipette may be handled and operated by laboratory personnel.<br>
The feedback control system enables precise control and monitoring of stroke adjustments, with the ability to recognize errors and reset itself when necessary.<br>
By shifting the upper section of the actuator assembly in relation to the lower section, with the latter being resiliently retained in the rest position with its first contact surface 84 in contact with the first stop 60, a further advantage is realized in that the magnitude of the resulting stroke can be visually assessed as a function of the extent to which the plunger 88 projects from the top of the housing. Thus, a maximum stroke will be referenced by a maximum plunger projection, as indicated at "Pmax" in Figure 3, whereas a minimum plunger projection, as indicate at "Pmjn" in Figure 9.<br>
