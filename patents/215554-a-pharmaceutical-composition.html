				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions of pharmacologically-active<br>
polypeptides, which provide sustained release of the polypeptide over an extended<br>
period of time.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
According to the prior art (WO 98/25642) pharmaceutical formulations are claimed<br>
comprising a stable water-insoluble complex composed of a peptidic compound<br>
(e.g., a peptide, polypeptide. protein, peptidomimetic and the like), preferably a<br>
pharmaceutically active peptidic compound, and a carrier macromolecule that allow<br>
for sustained delivery of the peptidic compound in vivo upon administration of the<br>
complex. The complex according to the prior art can permit continuous delivery of a<br>
pharmaceutically active peptidic compound to a subject for prolonged periods of<br>
time, e.g., one month. Moreover, the association of the peptidic compound and the<br>
carrier macromolecule in a tight, stable complex allows for loading of high<br>
concentrations of the peptidic compound into the formulation.<br>
The complex of the invention according to the prior art is formed by combining the<br>
peptidic compound and the carrier macromolecule under conditions such that a<br>
substantially water-insoluble complex is formed, e.g. aqueous solutions of the<br>
peptidic compound and carrier macromolecule are mixed until the complex<br>
precipitates.<br>
The complex may be in the form of a solid (e.g.. a paste, granules, a powder or a<br>
lyophilizate) or the powdered form of the complex can be pulverized finely enough to<br>
form stable liquid suspensions or semi-solid dispersions.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the peptidic compound of the water-insoluble complex is<br>
an LHRH analogue, more preferably an LHRH antagonist, and the carrier<br>
macromolecule is an anionic polymer, preferably sodium carboxymethylcellulose.<br>
The complex of the invention is suitable for sterilization, such as by gamma<br>
irradiation or electron beam irradiation, prior to administration in vivo.<br>
Methods for treating a subject for a condition treatable with an LHRH analogue by<br>
administering to the subject an LHRH-analogue-containing composition of the<br>
invention are also provided.<br>
Problems presented by the Prior Art<br>
For manufacturing the claimed complexes rather highly concentrated solutions (5 -<br>
25 mg/ml) of the peptidic compound in water have to be prepared. Because of the<br>
inherent tendency of many peptidic compounds to aggregate, it can not be ensured<br>
that aggregate-free solutions in pure water can be prepared using the claimed<br>
manufacturing procedure. Depending on the water solubility of a specific peptidic<br>
compound and on the technique used to prepare this solution, the concentrated<br>
peptide solution in water may be aggregate-free or contaminated with varying<br>
concentrations and different types of peptidic aggregates and precipitates. As this<br>
highly concentrated peptidic solution is the starting material for the production of the<br>
claimed complexes, the dissolution of the peptidic compound in water is obviously a<br>
critical step.<br>
By adding an aqueous solution of sodium carboxymethylcellulose to this not well<br>
defined and characterized, highly concentrated petide solutions in varying ratios<br>
(0.1:1 to 0.5: 1 w/w) complexes or precipitates are formed spontaneously in a non-<br>
defined, uncontrolled manner. The precipitates are collected by filtration or<br>
centrifugation, washed by rinsing with water and dried. The solid material is then<br>
powdered using a mortar and pestle. Afterwards the content of the peptidic<br>
compound is analytically determined. Due to the manufacturing procedure, the<br>
formation of stoichiometric complexes in a reproducible and well defined manner can<br>
not be guaranteed.<br><br>
Additionally, by adding a solution of sodium carboxymethylcellulose (containing 6,5-<br>
9,5 % sodium according to USP) a significant amount of metall ions, i.e. sodium ions.<br>
comes into contact with the peptidic compound. Peptides and proteins might be<br>
precipitated in the presence of salts. Therefore, it is not clear, whether the complexes<br>
or precipitates described in the prior art are formed because of interactions between<br>
the peptidic compound and the functional groups of carboxymethylcellulose itiself or<br>
solely by the peptide precipitating effect of the sodium ions or by unknown and non-<br>
controllable mixtures of these two processes.<br>
After drying and milling the peptide formulations described in the prior art are<br>
suspended in saline, which also can lead to further undesirable, uncontrolled<br>
interaction processes.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a stable,<br>
well defined, stoichiometric salt composed of an acidic or basic peptidic compound<br>
(like peptide, polypeptide protein, peptidominetic etc and of an ionic, basic or acidic,<br>
carrier macromolecule, respectively, allowing sustained delivery of the peptidic<br>
compound after in vivo administration of the salt of a specific peptidic compound.<br>
The ionic carrier macromolecule may be an anionic polymer, for example an anionic<br>
polyalcohol, a derivative or a fragment thereof.<br>
Furthermore the ionic carrier macromolecule can be an anionic polysaccharide, a<br>
derivative or a fragment thereof. Preferably the carrier macromolecule is<br>
carboxymethylcellulose.The carrier macromolecule in the pharmaceutical<br>
composition can further be selected from the group consisting of algin, alginic acid,<br>
sodium alginate, anionic acetate polymers, ionic acrylic or methacrylic polymers and<br>
copolymers, pectin, tragacanth, xanthan gums, anionic carageenan derivatives.<br><br>
anionic polygalacturonic acid derivatives, sulfated and sulfonated polystyrene,<br>
sodium starch glycolate. and fragments or derivatives thereof.<br>
The ionic carrier macromolecuie can also be albumin, gelatin (type A or type B), and<br>
a fragment or derivative thereof.<br>
Cationic polymers can also be poly-L-lysine and other polymers of basic amino acids.<br>
The peptide in the compound is a pharmaceutically active peptidic compound and<br>
can be a mono-, di- or multivalent cationic or anionic polypeptide, wherein the<br>
polypeptide is 5 to 100 amino acids in length, preferabely 5 to 20 amino acids in<br>
length, more preferabely the peptide is 8 to 12 amino acids in length. More in detail<br>
the peptidic compound is an LHRH analogue and the LHRH analogue is an LHRH<br>
antagonist. The LHRH analogue is for example Cetrorelix, Teverelix (Ahtarelix,<br>
Oeghenghi et al., Biomed &amp; Pharmacother 1993, 47, 107), Abarelix (Molineaux et al.,<br>
Molecular Urology 1998, 2, 265). Ganirelix (Nestor et al., J. Med. Chem. 1992,<br>
35,3942), Azaline B, Antide, A-75998 (Cannon et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 1995, 84, 953),<br>
Detirelix (Andreyko et al.. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992, 74, 399). RS-68439 ,<br>
Ramorelix (Stoeckemann and Sandow, J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1993, 119, 457),<br>
Nal-Glu. Structures of the above mentioned LHRH analogues are provided for<br>
example in the above cited references and in following reviews: Behre et al., GnRH<br>
antagonists: an overview, Proceedings of the 2nd World Conference on Ovulation<br>
Induction, The Parthenon Publishing Group Ltd. UK; Kutscher et al., Angew. Chem.<br>
1997, 109, 2240.<br>
Moreover a method of preparation of such salts is described.<br>
According to the invention, the free base or the free acid of the peptidic compound is<br>
prepared by removing the counter ion using ion exchangers. Also, the free base or<br>
the free acid of the carrier macromolecuie is prepared by removing the counter ion<br>
using ion exchangers. Thereupon, equivalent amounts of the freshly prepared<br>
peptide base or peptide acid solution, respectively, and of the counterionic-free<br>
macromolecuie carrier solution are combined. The ratio of peptidic compound to<br><br>
carrier macromolecule (w/w) can be, for example, 1:0.1,1:0.213,1:0.5,1:2.13. Non-<br>
limiting examples of conditions and procedures for preparing a water-insoluble<br>
complex of the invention are described in Examples 1 to 4.<br>
This process results in well defined, stoichiometric and pure salts of the peptidic<br>
compound with a counterionic macromolecule. These pure salts are not<br>
contaminated by other ions, neither anions (e.g. acetate) nor cations (e.g. sodium).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention permit sustained delivery of the<br>
peptidic compound to a subject in vivo after administration of the composition to the<br>
subject. The duration and the extent of the sustained delivery can be varied<br>
depending upon the concentration of the peptidic compound and the carrier<br>
macromolecule used to form the salt.<br>

A lyophilisate of cetrorelix-CMC-salt with a mass ratio cetrorelix : CMC of 1:0.1<br>
resembling a molar ratio cetrorelix : carboxylic function of CMC of 1:0.48 was<br>
prepared as follows. 0.22 g Na-CMC (low viscosity grade carboxymethylcellulose,<br>

The filtrated cetrorelix base solution was added under continuous stirring to the<br>
sodium-free CMC-solution yielding a clear solution. After 1 hour stirring the solution<br>
was evaporated under vacuum to remove the ethanol yielding a dispersion. Finally,<br>
the dispersion was frozen and freeze-dried.<br>

ion exchanger was removed by filtration using a glas fibre filter. The filtrated<br>
cetrorelix base solution was added under continuous stirring to the sodium-free<br>
CMC-solution yielding a clear solution. After 1 hour stirring the solution was<br>
evaporated under vacuum to remove the ethanol yielding a dispersion. Finally, the<br>
dispersion was frozen and freeze-dried.<br>
Example 3<br>
A lyophilisate of cetrorelix-CMC-salt with a mass ratio cetrorelix : CMC of 1.0.5<br>
resembling a molar ratio cetrorelix: carboxylic function of CMC of 1:2.41 was<br>
prepared as follows. 1.1 g Na-CMC (low viscosity grade carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
Hercules) was dissolved in 200 g water and 15 g ion exchanger (Amberiite®) was<br>
added. After stirring for 20 min the ion exchanger was removed by filtration using a<br>
glas fibre filter. 2.21 g cetrorelix acetate was dissolved in 23.4 g water and 74.6 g<br>
ethanol 96 % (v/v) was added. 20 g ion exchanger (Amberiite®) was added. After<br>
stirring for 20 min the ion exchanger was removed by filtration using a glas fibre filter.<br>
The filtrated cetrorelix base solution was added under continuous stirring to the<br>
sodium-free CMC-solution yielding a solution. After 1 hour stirring the solution was<br>
evaporated under vacuum to remove the ethanol yielding a dispersion. Finally, the<br>
dispersion was frozen and freeze-dried.<br>
Example 4<br><br>
A lyophilisate of cetrorelix-CMG-satt with a mass ratio cetrorelix : CMC of 1:2.13<br>
resembling a molar ratio cetroreix : carboxylic function of CMC of 1:10 was prepared<br>
as follows. 4.26 g Na-CMC (low viscosity grade carboxymethylcellulose, Hercules)<br>
was dissolved in 400 g water and 50 g ion exchanger (Amberlite®) was added. After<br>
stirring for 25 min the ion exchanger was removed by filtration using a glas fibre filter.<br>
2.21 g cetrorelix acetate was dissolved in 23.4 g water and 74.6 g ethanol 96 % (v/v)<br>
was added. 20 g ion exchanger (Ambertite®) was added. After stirring for 20 min the<br>
ion exchanger was removed by filtration using a glas fibre filter. The filtrated<br>
cetrorelix base solution was added under continuous stirring to the sodium-free<br>
CMC-solution yielding a turbid dispersion. After 1 hour stirring the dispersion was<br>
evaporated under vacuum to remove the ethanol. Finally, the dispersion was frozen<br>
and freeze-dried.<br>
Example 5<br>
The solubility of sodium-free, pure CMC-salts with varying compositions peptide-<br>
base : CMC acid was determined in isotonic Ringer solution. The cetrorelix-CMC-<br>
salts were prepared according to example 1 to 4. Additionally, the in vitro release in<br>
Ringer solution of cetrorelix out of these sodium-free CMC-salts was tested over a<br>
time period of 168 hours using a flow-through-system. The amount of cetrorelix<br>
released after 168 h is expressed as percentage of the cetrorelix dose applied in this<br>
in vitro test method.<br><br>
These in vitro data of the sodium-free CMC-salts according to this invention were<br>
compared with cetrorelix complexes manufactured with Na-CMC in identical mass<br>
ratios of peptide and CMC according to the prior art (WO 98/25642).<br><br><br>
The elimination of sodium and acetate ions in the peptide CMC-salts is leading to<br>
significant improvements in the in vitro bevaviour of such formulations, i.e. solubility<br>
and in vitro release characteristics.<br>
In the Na-CMC complexes according to the prior art the solubility in Ringer solution is<br>
very low and can not be modified by changing the ratio of the components peptide<br>
and Na-CMC. Thus, the release kinetics of the peptidic compound out of these<br>
formulations cannot be modified.<br>
In contrast, within the sodium-free CMC-salts of the peptidic compound prepared<br>
according to the invention there is a clear dependence between the mass ratio of the<br>
salt components and their in vitro behaviour. An increase in the percentage of<br>
sodium-free CMC acid within such formulations leads to a significant increase in the<br>
solubility of the peptidic compound in Ringer solution. Thus, the release kinetics of<br>
the peptidic compound out of these sodium-free CMC-salt formulations can be<br>
modified and controlled. Therefore, depending on the desired release kinetics for<br>
certain clinical applications, definite CMC-salt formulations with appropiate release<br>
patterns can be made available.<br>
Example 6<br>
Both sodium-free CMC-salts of cetrorelix according to Examples 1 (o 4 and Na-CMC<br>
complexes of cetrorelix with equivalent mass ratios cetrorelix : CMC according to the<br>
•prior art were prepared. Suspensions of such sodium-free CMC-salts of cetrorelix<br><br>
and of Na-CMC-complexes of cetrorelix, respectively, were prepared and a single<br>
dose was injected intramuscularly into rats in a dosage of 1,5 mg/kg. Plasma<br>
testosterone levels and plasma cetrorelix levels were determined at various time<br>
points. Additionally, at the end of the testosterone suppression the rats were killed.<br>
The muscle, into which the dose was injected, was removed and analyzed for the<br>
residual of the administered cetrorelix dose at the injection site.<br>
Results are shown in Figure 1.<br>
The absolute bioavailability of the Cetrorelix-CMC salts was in the range of 78%-<br>
111%. The bioavailability of the Cetrorelix-Na-CMC complexes was only 32%<br>
indicating the negative influence of the sodium ions on the properties of the<br>
formulations prepared according to the prior art.<br>
Example 7<br>
Sodium-free CMC-salts of cetrorelix accord ing to this invention as described in<br>
previous examples were prepared as lyophilisates. The lyophilisates were dispersed<br>
in aqueous media and a single dose was injected subcutaneously into dogs in a<br>
dosage of 1,0 mg/kg. Plasma testosterone levels and plasma cetrorelix levels were<br>
determined at various time points. Results are shown in Figure 2.<br><br>
