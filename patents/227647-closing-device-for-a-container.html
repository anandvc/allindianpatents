				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a closing device for a container in<br>
general and for a cooking pot or steam pressure cooking pot<br>
in particular.<br>
At a time of increasing health awareness, there is also a<br>
greater demand for food preparation methods which are<br>
advantageous from the point of view of nutrition. At the same<br>
time, in a hectic world in which people want to and are able<br>
to spend less and less time on everyday household chores,<br>
there is a desire for fast and efficient food preparation.<br>
Steam pressure cooking pots satisfy these two apparently<br>
conflicting requirements outstandingly by permitting rapid<br>
and gentle cooking of food.<br>
In principle/ steam pressure cooking pots have been known for<br>
decades. However, the known steam pressure cooking pots have<br>
a number of disadvantages.<br>
From the fifties, for example, and more specifically from<br>
patent specification DE 896 409, a steam pressure cooking pot<br>
is known with a lid which is closed by means of three jaws<br>
gripping round the edge of the lid. A disadvantage of this<br>
closure mechanism is that a substantial force is needed for<br>
closing it, this force being applied via an unwieldy lever.<br>
More recent developments in the field of steam pressure<br><br>
cooking pots are described in laid-open specifications WO<br>
96/01070, EP-A-1 029 483 and EP-A-1 082 932, for example.<br>
A closure device which is known from laid-open specification<br>
WO 96/01070 has a lid with two radially displaceable clamping<br>
jaws which are drawn together by a spring mechanism. A<br>
disadvantage here is that a seal is prestressed in an<br>
undefined manner by pressing vertically on the lid before the<br>
clamping jaws are closed. The clamping jaws then slide<br>
abruptly inward and cause an annoying noise when they strike<br>
the pot edge.<br>
Laid-open specification EP-A-1 082 932 discloses a steam<br>
pressure cooking pot with a similar lid as in document WO<br>
96/01070.<br>
US patent specification 5,613,424 discloses a control device<br>
for opening and closing closure jaws for a pressure pot. The<br>
device comprises a control element which is mounted on a lid<br>
and, engaging in movement arms, moves radially with respect<br>
to the lid.<br>
Furthermore, patent specification CH 254 203 describes a<br>
steam pressure cooking pot with an outwardly protruding edge.<br>
The lid of the steam pressure cooking pot comprises three<br>
gripping members which are bent in a U shape at their ends<br>
and which engage under the edge and press the lid with an<br>
interposed seal against the top face of the pot edge.<br>
The document FR 2 809 608 A1 discloses a closing and opening<br>
device for a lid of a steam pressure cooking pot, which lid<br>
has four arms with clamping jaws which are driven by rotation<br>
of a control element.<br><br>
In addition, laid-open specification EP-A-1 029 483 discloses<br>
a lid for a pressure pot with four movable clamping jaws<br>
which can be moved radially via a crank mechanism. This crank<br>
mechanism comprises a large number of movable components,<br>
some of them made of plastic. This crank mechanism is<br>
therefore complicated and expensive to produce and assemble,<br>
is not long-lasting, and is problematic with regard to<br>
hygiene requirements.<br>
All of said devices have, however, further serious<br>
disadvantages in common.<br>
The devices mentioned are cumbersome, esthetically<br>
unappealing, difficult to clean, and have to be produced with<br>
small tolerances.<br>
In addition, a further serious disadvantage is that the known devices can<br>
be used only on specially adapted<br><br><br>
to be able to properly	cooperate with the devices and<br>
be able to withstand the pressure loads during operation.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to make<br>
available a closing device for a container, in particular for<br>
a cooking pot or steam pressure cooking pot, which closing<br>
device avoids or at least reduces the disadvantages of known<br>
devices.<br>
Another object of the invention is to make available for a<br>
container, in particular for a cooking pot or steam pressure<br>
cooking pot, a closing device which is esthetically<br>
appealing, inexpensive, easy to clean, can be closed and<br>
opened with application of minimal force, easy to use and/or<br>
reliable.<br>
A further object of the invention is to make available a<br>
closing device with which different commercially available<br>
cooking pots, in particular with a downwardly beveled pouring<br>
edge, can be closed in such a way that a steam pressure<br>
cooking pot arrangement is obtained.<br>
The object of the invention is already solved in a<br>
surprisingly simple manner by the subject of claim 1.<br>
The closing device according to the invention is intended for<br>
a container with an opening, in particular for a cooking pot<br>
or steam pressure cooking pot with an outwardly protruding<br>
pouring edge. The closing device comprises a lid or inner lid<br>
for closing the opening of the container. The closing device<br>
further comprises a closing element arrangement with at least<br>
a first closing element, preferably with a plurality of in<br>
particular identical closing elements, and a movement device<br><br><br>
for moving at least the first closing element, preferably<br>
all of the closing elements.<br>
The container has an axis which extends from a base to the<br>
opening and which in the case of circular containers in<br>
particular constitutes the axis of symmetry of rotation of<br>
the container. The axis preferably extends perpendicular to<br>
the container base.<br>
The container moreover has an opening plane which is defined<br>
by the pouring edge and which preferably extends parallel to<br>
the container base and perpendicular to the axis. The first<br>
closing element or the closing elements is/are directed<br>
inward or moved toward the axis by an actuation of the<br>
movement device, and, during the inwardly directed movement<br>
or displacement, there occurs an upward movement, or movement<br>
away from the container base, of at least a portion of the<br>
closing element or closing elements.<br>
This movement or displacement, in particular directed<br>
obliquely inward and upward, of the closing element or<br>
closing elements advantageously ensures a controlled<br>
downwardly directed pressure of the closing device onto the<br>
container or cooking pot, in particular for the defined<br>
prestressing of a seal arranged between the lid and the<br>
container.<br>
Moreover, a reliable closure is ensured by the upward<br>
movement of the closing element or of the closing elements<br>
even in the case of considerable production tolerances. The<br>
closing device according to the invention is also especially<br>
suitable for commercially available cooking pots with an<br>
outwardly protruding pouring edge which is angled obliquely<br><br><br>
downward in the outer area. For cooking pots like these,<br>
most of the known lids for steam pressure cooking pots are<br>
not suitable, because their clamping jaws in most cases move<br>
horizontally, i.e. parallel to the opening plane or<br>
perpendicular to the axis. If known closing devices of this<br>
kind were nevertheless to be used in an inappropriate way,<br>
they would engage on the outermost, downwardly projecting<br>
portion of the pouring edge, i.e. with substantial leverage,<br>
and would possibly bend the pouring edge out of shape.<br>
By contrast, the closing element of the closing device<br>
according to the invention is able to engage farther inward<br>
in relation to the pot axis. For this reason, the closing<br>
device according to the invention can cooperate with<br>
commercially available cooking pots, including those with<br>
relatively thin walls, resulting in a steam pressure cooking<br>
pot arrangement that is able to withstand pressure.<br>
In particular, the closing element arrangement defines at<br>
least an open position in which the closing device can be<br>
removed from the container, and a closure position in which<br>
the lid seals the container, in particular in a substantially<br>
liquid-tight manner.<br>
The container sealed off in the closure position is<br>
preferably able to withstand pressures up to at least about 5<br>
bar internal pressure or internal overpressure.<br>
In the open position, the closing element or closing elements<br>
is/are preferably in a first, in particular outer position,<br>
and, in the closure position, the closing element or closing<br>
elements is/are preferably in a second, in particular inner<br>
position, and it/they can be moved or displaced between the<br><br><br>
first position and second position. The movement or<br>
displacement between the first position and second position<br>
takes the form in particular of an inwardly directed radial<br>
movement in which the first closing element or the closing<br>
elements slides/slide on the lid.<br>
The first closing element has in particular an outer edge for<br>
engaging on the pouring edge of the container. Upon the<br>
obliquely upward and radially inward movement of the first<br>
closing element, the outer edge comes to bear from underneath<br>
on the pouring edge of the container and, through the upward<br>
component of the movement, impacts the pouring edge with an<br>
axially upwardly directed force component.<br>
The outwardly protruding pouring edge particularly preferably<br>
has an outwardly extending, substantially horizontal inner<br>
ring portion and a downwardly or obliquely downwardly<br>
extending outer ring portion. By means of the obliquely<br>
inward and upward movement of the first closing element upon<br>
closure of the container, the outer edge of the closing<br>
element can bear, at least in parts, from below on the inner<br>
ring portion of the pouring edge. The bearing point or ring<br>
is preferably situated as far inward as possible, e.g. on the<br>
inner half of the inner ring portion, so that the lever<br>
conditions are optimized and only a slight torque is exerted<br>
on the pouring edge. In particular, the bearing point or ring<br>
is not situated on the outer ring portion of the pouring<br>
edge .<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
outer edge of the closing element comprises a downwardly<br>
extending first portion and an upwardly extending second<br>
portion, the second portion being arranged to the inside of<br><br><br>
the first portion with respect to the container axis. The<br>
second portion ascends, for example perpendicularly or<br>
obliquely inward in relation to the opening plane.<br>
Between the first portion and second portion there is<br>
preferably a third portion, which preferably extends<br>
substantially parallel to the plane of the pot. Upon closure<br>
of the closing device, the second portion in particular of<br>
the outer edge of the closing element comes to bear with<br>
force on the inner ring portion of the container, so that the<br>
closing device and with it possibly also the seal are pressed<br>
onto the container. In this case, the closure position is<br>
particularly preferably held with self-locking through the<br>
frictional forces generated.<br>
It has proven particularly advantageous, and it is therefore<br>
preferred, to have an angle in the range of 5° to 30°, in<br>
particular in the range of 10° to 20°, most preferably in the<br>
range of about 15°, between the obliquely upwardly directed<br>
movement of the outer edge of the closing element, upon<br>
closure, and the opening plane of the container.<br>
The seal is in particular designed as a sealing ring and<br>
preferably extends in a circle about the closing device. The<br>
seal is preferably attached to the lid in a releasable manner<br>
and is made for example of silicone or silicone-containing<br>
material.<br>
It is particularly expedient to use what is called a sealing<br>
lip or lip seal, which has a substantially U-shaped or V-<br>
shaped cross section. The lip seal has the particular<br>
advantage that the pressure generated in the inside of the<br>
container forces the seal apart and thus improves the sealing<br><br><br>
action. Thus, relatively slight prestressing, as is<br>
generated by the closing operation, is still sufficient to<br>
achieve a closure that is very resistant to pressure.<br>
According to a preferred development of the invention, the<br>
closing element has substantially the shape of a segment of a<br>
circle.<br>
In particular, however, the segment tip can be removed or cut<br>
out. The circle segment shape is advantageous particularly in<br>
connection with an arrangement consisting of a plurality of<br>
preferably identical closing elements.<br>
In the closure position, the closing elements particularly<br>
preferably form a substantially closed covering, by virtue of<br>
the fact that the circle- segment-shaped closing elements<br>
laterally adjoin one another, preferably flush with one<br>
another. There are preferably 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 or more<br>
closing elements used. An optionally remaining central<br>
opening in the arrangement of closing elements is preferably<br>
covered from sight by a handle which is part of the movement<br>
device, so that in the closure position the impression given<br>
is of a conventional pot lid. In particular, in the closure<br>
position the lid is covered or concealed more or less<br>
completely by the closing element arrangement.<br>
The lid and/or the closing element arrangement are preferably<br>
bulged outward at least in parts and preferably each form a<br>
sphere portion. In this embodiment, the closing elements<br>
preferably lie flat on the lid and slide on the latter. A<br>
radius in the range of 100 mm to 1000 mm, preferably in the<br>
range of 300 mm to 600 mm, has proven particularly expedient<br>
for the curvature of the sphere portions.<br><br><br>
The closing element arrangement and the lid can preferably be<br>
connected to one another in a releasable manner by a central<br>
securing means, for example a screw. This makes it much<br>
easier to thoroughly clean the closing device.<br>
The closing device, in particular the lid, preferably has<br>
centering means, for example projections extending downward<br>
from the lid. In the open position and/or the closure<br>
position, the centering means ensure a reliable and precise<br>
centering of the closing device, in particular of the lid, on<br>
the container.<br>
The movement device preferably comprises a slotted guide disk<br>
secured on the handle, for example. In addition to having an<br>
axial bore, the slotted guide disk has, for each closing<br>
element, a curved slot extending obliquely to the<br>
circumference of the slotted guide disk. In the slot there is<br>
a bolt which is connected in fixed position to the<br>
corresponding closing element. By turning the slotted guide<br>
disk, the bolt is thus radially displaced with the closing<br>
element. Alternatively or as a complement to this, a toothed<br>
gear arrangement can also be used.<br>
It is particularly preferable for the closing device,<br>
excluding the handle, to be made, in particular completely,<br>
of metal, for example of stainless steel. This gives a<br>
sturdy, long-lasting and hygienic closing device in which the<br>
coefficients of expansion of different component parts are<br>
adapted to one another and to the container.<br>
Moreover, the closing device according to the invention<br>
preferably comprises a safety means with a blocking means for<br><br><br>
blocking the movement of the closing elements and/or an<br>
overpressure relief valve, in order to meet the legal safety<br>
requirements. Such safety means are known in principle to the<br>
person skilled in the art.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below on the basis<br>
of preferred embodiments and with reference to the figures.<br>

Fig. 9 shows a sectional view through a safety means.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of the closing device 1 according<br>
to the invention with a closing element arrangement 2,<br>
comprising four closing elements 10, 20, 30, 40 which are<br>
substantially in the shape of segments of a circle, and a<br>
rotationally symmetrical and rotatable handle 50 which is<br>
arranged centrally with respect to the closing device 1. Each<br>
of the four closing elements 10, 20, 30, 40 has in each case<br>
a central arc-shaped cutout 12, 22, 32, 42 and in each case<br>
two mutually adjoining cutouts 14d, 14a, 24a, 24b, 34b, 34c,<br>
44c, 44d which are arranged at the outer corners of the<br>
closing elements located on the circumference.<br>
In the closure position of the closing device 1 shown in Fig.<br>
1, the cutouts 12, 22, 32, 42 substantially form a central<br>
circular cutout 4 of the closing element arrangement 2. The<br>
cutouts 14d, 14a, 24a, 24b, 34b, 34c, 44c, 44d form four<br>
cutouts 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d arranged at 90° along the<br><br><br>
circumference of the closing element arrangement 2.<br>
The four closing elements 10, 20, 30, 40 each have two radial<br>
edges 16d, 16a, 26a, 26b, 36b, 36c, 46c, 46d and in each case<br>
an outer arc-shaped edge area 18, 28, 38, 48.<br>
The closing element arrangement 2 is preferably first<br>
produced in one piece and shaped and then cut by means of a<br>
laser or a saw into four equal closing elements 10, 20, 30,<br>
40. The laser cutting is particularly advantageous, as this<br>
avoids deburring.<br>
The closing device 1 has been cut open in the area S so that<br>
a cutout of a slotted guide disk 60 and of a retaining and<br>
guide plate 70 can be seen.<br>
The diameter of the closing device is about 240 mm, and the<br>
thickness of the closing elements is about 1 mm to 1.2 mm.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the closing device 1 in a side view along the<br>
direction C in Fig. 1. This view includes the two closing<br>
elements 20 and 30, the handle 50, and a lid 80 which is<br>
arranged inside the closing element arrangement 2. The lid 80<br>
has four centering tabs 82a, 82b, 82c, 82d which are arranged<br>
in the cutouts 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d of the closing element<br>
arrangement 2, and of which the rear centering tab 82d is not<br>
shown.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the closing device 1 in the closure position<br>
(solid lines). An edge area 140 of the closing element 40 is<br>
also indicated in the open position by broken lines. The<br>
other closing elements 10, 20, 30 are essentially identical<br>
to the first closing element 40.<br><br><br>
Fig. 3 also shows a movement device 90 comprising the handle<br>
50 made of plastic, the metal slotted guide disk 60, the<br>
metal guide plate 70, a screw 92, a drive pin 94, a guide<br>
screw 96, a central screw 98, and a central nut 99.<br>
The handle 50 comprises a rotation knob 52 and a finger<br>
protection plate 54. The guide plate 70 is arranged between<br>
the slotted guide disk 60 and the closing element 40 and is<br>
completely concealed by the handle 50.<br>
The guide screw 96 connects the closing element 40 to the<br>
guide plate 70, the closing element 40 being radially<br>
displaceable with respect to the guide plate 70. Upon the<br>
displacement, the guide screw 96 slides in a radially<br>
extending oblong hole 71 in the closing element 40. The drive<br>
pin 94 connects the closing element 40 to the guide plate 70,<br>
likewise in a radially displaceable manner, with the drive<br>
pin 94 sliding in an oblong hole 72 of the guide plate 70.<br>
The drive pin 94 further extends through a curved oblong hole<br>
64 in the slotted guide disk 60. The mechanism of<br>
displacement for the other three identical closing elements<br>
10, 20, 30 is of equivalent design.<br>
By turning the handle 50 about an axis 122 and the slotted<br>
guide disk 60 secured on the handle 50, the closing element<br>
40 is displaced radially between the open position and the<br>
closure position by means of the drive pin 94.<br>
The closing element arrangement 2 and the lid 8 0 can be<br>
easily separated from one another by removing the central nut<br>
99, for example for cleaning purposes.<br><br><br>
An enlargement of the edge area 140 is illustrated in<br>
Fig. 4 in the open position. Fig. 4 shows a circularly<br>
extending lip seal 110. The lip seal 110 is made of silicone<br>
and is of substantially U-shaped cross section. The lip seal<br>
110 comprises a central portion 112 and an upper lip portion<br>
114 and lower lip portion 116. The central portion 112 and<br>
the upper lip portion 114 lie from inside and from below<br>
against the lid 80. The lower lip portion 116 comes to bear<br>
on a pouring edge 130 of a pot 120 of circular cross section,<br>
when the closing device 2 is fitted onto the pot or cooking<br>
pot 120.<br>
The closing element 40 has a lid portion 49 which curves<br>
outward in relation to the inside of the pot, and a claw-like<br>
edge portion 140 for engaging around the pouring edge 130.<br>
The surface of the lid portion 49 is in the shape of a<br>
spherical portion with a radius of about 400 mm. The claw-<br>
like edge portion 140 has a first downwardly extending<br>
portion 142 and a second upwardly extending portion 144.<br>
Here, the terms downward and upward are to be understood<br>
extending in the path of the closing element 40 away from the<br>
center or the axis 122. Arranged between the first portion<br>
142 and the second portion 144, there is a third portion 146,<br>
which according to this illustrative embodiment is<br>
horizontal. The second and third portions 144, 146 are<br>
arranged inward in the direction of the axis or pot axis 122<br>
in relation to the first portion 142, and under the lid<br>
portion 49. The closing element 40 is made of metal, in<br>
particular of stainless steel sheet, and the edge portion 140<br>
is bent, rolled or beaded, so that curved portions 141, 143<br>
and 145 are obtained between the portions 49, 142, 146 and<br>
144 of the closing element 40.<br><br><br>
The pouring edge 130 of the pot 120 has an inner ring<br>
portion 132 extending horizontally, or parallel to the pot<br>
surface 121, and a downwardly beveled outer ring portion 134.<br>
In this embodiment, the centering tabs 82a, 82b, 82c, 82d are<br>
produced in one piece with the lid 80 and are indicated by<br>
broken lines in Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a detail of a sectional view corresponding to a<br>
section along the line B-B in Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the centering<br>
tabs. A centering tab 82c is shown which has been secured,<br>
for example welded, from the outside onto the outer edge of<br>
the lid 80.<br>
Figures 6a through 6c show the movement of a closing element<br>
40' which has been modified compared to the closing element<br>
40. The closing element 40' comprises an outer, downwardly<br>
extending first portion 142', and an obliquely upwardly<br>
extending second portion 144'. Adjoining the second portion<br>
144' there is a substantially horizontally extending end<br>
portion 148'. Curved portions 141' and 143' are also present.<br>
Fig. 6a shows the closing element 40' in the open position.<br>
During closure, the closing element 40' slides on the lid 80<br>
in direction D.<br>
It is obvious that the second portion 144' and the end<br>
portion 148', together with the whole closing element 40',<br>
move upward during the inward closing displacement. As can<br>
best be seen from Fig. 3, the angle a between the direction<br>
of movement of the end portion 148' is about 18° in these<br><br><br>
illustrative embodiments.<br>
Fig. 6b shows the closing element 40' or closing device 1 in<br>
a half closed position, in which the inner portion 144'<br>
already overlaps the pouring edge 130 of the pot 120 in part.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 6c, the closing element 40' or closing<br>
element arrangement 2 is shown in the closed state or closure<br>
state. In the closure state, the second portion 144' of the<br>
closing element 40', or more exactly the inner horizontal end<br>
portion 148', bears with force on the pouring edge 130. It is<br>
obvious that, by means of the oblique upward movement of the<br>
closing element 40', a perpendicular or axial force is<br>
exerted on the lid 80 and lip seal 110, so that a defined<br>
prestressing of the lip seal 110 is obtained. In particular,<br>
the seal 110 is automatically prestressed when the movement<br>
device 90 is actuated to effect closure.<br>
The point of engagement of the horizontal inner portion 148'<br>
lies relatively far inward on the pouring edge 130, in this<br>
illustrative embodiment within the center of the inner ring<br>
portion 132. In this way, the torque on the pouring edge 130<br>
is kept low, with the result that the closing device 1 can<br>
even be used for pots 120 with a pouring edge thickness of<br>
less than 1.2 mm or less than 1.0 mm.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a fourth embodiment for the form of the outer<br>
edge of the closing element. According to this fourth<br>
embodiment, the outer edge 140' comprises an obliquely<br>
upwardly and inwardly extending second portion 144' with an<br>
end portion 148' which is bent downward in an arc shape and<br>
comes to bear on the pouring edge in the closure position.<br><br><br>
Fig. 8 shows a plan view looking at the center of the<br>
closing device without the handle 50. This view shows the<br>
slotted guide disk 60 of stainless steel with four curved<br>
oblong holes 61, 62, 63, 64 which do not extend parallel to<br>
the circumference of the slotted guide disk 60 and thus, upon<br>
rotation, radially displace the drive pins 94 and, with them,<br>
the four closing elements 10, 20, 30, 40.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a safety means 150 with a blocking device and<br>
integrated overpressure relief valve. The safety means 150<br>
comprises a housing 151, a screwed connection 152, a valve<br>
pin 153, a valve spring 154, a valve ball 155, and an O-ring<br>
156.<br>
If the internal pressure in the closed pot rises above a<br>
first threshold value, the valve pin 153 is pushed upward<br>
through an opening in the closing element 40, so that the<br>
closing element arrangement 2 is blocked and can no longer be<br>
opened. If the pressure rises above a second threshold value,<br>
e.g. 5 bar, pressure is released automatically via the valve<br>
ball 155.<br>
It will be clear to the skilled person that the invention is<br>
not limited to the embodiments described above and that<br>
instead it can be varied, particularly in relation to the<br>
concrete design of the outer edge of the closing elements and<br>
of the pouring edge, without departing from the spirit of the<br>
invention.<br><br>
