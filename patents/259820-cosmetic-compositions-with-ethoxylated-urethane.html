COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS WITH ETHOXYLATED URETHANE<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS WITH ETHOXYLATED URETHANE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to cosmetic compositions whose major component other than water is petrolatum incorporating additives achieving a product with good consistency to allow for a smooth aesthetic application onto human skin.<br>
Petrolatum is one of the oldest skin treatment products still in commerce today. For over 100 years, the Chesebrough Company and its successors have sold the substance under the brand, Vaseline®. There is good reason for the longevity of this product. Its occlusive and healing properties render this product especially efficacious against dry and damaged skin.<br>
Of course there are many drawbacks to petrolatum. This substance is greasy. When in contact with clothes or anything else, the product has a tendency to be transferred through rub off. An approach to this problem is found in US 5 407 678 (Rose et al.) which employs aluminum starch octenylsuccinate and a C12-C15 alkyl lactate to provide a non-greasy yet efficacious product active against dry skin.<br>
A non-greasy and easily spreadable composition of petrolatum is reported in US 5 595 745 (Znaiden et al.). The petroleum butter mentioned in this patent utilizes C18-C30 acyl lactylate as a facilitator to achieve improved skin healing, moisturization and other skin benefit properties.<br>
Despite these advances, problems remain. Traditional petrolatum has a rather stiff consistency. Pure petrolatum is not readily spreadable onto the skin surface. Thus there remains the problem of finding formulations easily rubbable onto skin.<br><br>
-2-<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A cosmetic composition is provided that includes:<br>
(i)        from 1 to 40% by weight of petrolatum;<br>
(ii)       from 20 to 90% by weight of water; and<br>
(iii)      from 0.01 to 0.15% by weight of an ethoxylated urethane.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Now it has been found that cosmetic compositions with substantial amounts of petrolatum can have their aesthetic properties improved through incorporation of an ethoxylated urethane. Not only is product stability improved but the ethoxylated urethane achieves a thickening effect without being sticky or tacky. Further the resultant thickened composition is still easily rubbable into skin.<br>
Amounts of the petrolatum for purposes of this invention may range from 1% to 40%, preferably from 5 to 30%, more preferably from 8 to 15% by weight of the composition.<br>
Water will also be present in compositions of this invention. Amounts of the water<br>
may range from 20 to 90%, preferably from 30 to 80%, and optimally from 50 to<br>
65% by weight of the composition.	"<br>
An essential further component of compositions according to the present invention is that of an ethoxylated urethane. Amounts of the ethoxylated urethane may range from 0.02 to 0.085%, and optimally from 0.05 to 0.075% by weight of the composition. In certain embodiments the amount of ethoxylated urethane may range from 0.01 to less than 0.1% by weight of the composition.<br>
Ethoxylated urethanes of the present invention that are particularly preferred are dimers such as those according to the structure below.<br><br><br>
wherein n is a whole number from about 50 to 120, preferably 75-100, and most preferably 75 or 100, and R is independently a C12-C24 alky! or alkenyl group, preferably an aikyl group, more preferably a Ci8 alkyl group.<br>
Particularly preferred are ethoxylated urethanes available commercially under the tradename Dermothix 75 (INCI Name: Disteareth-75 IPDI) and Dermothix 100 (INCI Name: Disteareth-100 IPDI) and their combinations, sold by Alzo International Incorporated (Sayreville, New Jersey).<br>
Another component which may be present in compositions of this invention is cocoa butter. Amounts of cocoa butter may range from 0.01 to 20%, preferably from 0.1 to 10%, and optimally from 0.8 to 2% by weight of the composition.<br>
The term "cocoa butter" is also defined as oleum theobromatis (theobroma oil). This material is obtained from the cacao bean by expression, decoction or extraction by solvent. Particularly common is a production method wherein cacao seeds are compressed between hot or cold plates. Typical properties are a specific gravity ranging from 0.858 to 0.864 (100/25°C), melting point between 30 to 35°C, refractive index (n 40/D) of 1.4537 to 1.4585; saponification number 188 to 200 and an iodine number from 32 to 43.<br>
Another useful component of the present invention is that of a taurate polymer or copolymer. A particularly preferred copolymer is one wherein the taurate repeating monomer unit is acryloyl dimethyltaurate (in either free acid or salt form). Monomers forming the copolymer with taurate may include: styrene, hydroxyethyl acrylic acid, hydroxyethyl methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, methacrylic<br><br>
acid, vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, vinyl pyrrolidone, isoprene, vinyl alcohol, vinyl methyiether, chloro-styrene, dialkylamino-styrene, maleic acid, acrylamide, methacrylamide and mixtures thereof. Where the term "acid" appears, the term means not only the free acid but also C1-C30 alky! esters, anhydrides and salts thereof. Preferably but not exclusively the salts may be ammonium, alkanolammonium, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts.<br>
Most preferred as the copolymer is a sodium acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer sold as Simulgel EG® by Seppic Corporation. Other taurate copolymers may also be useful and can include Simulgel NS® which is known by its INCI name of Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, also from Seppic Corporation.<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
A series of comparative experiments were conducted to evaluate ethoxylated urethane and other materials on their effects toward producing a product with good consistency and smooth aesthetic application onto skin (stick/slip friction).<br>
Procedure<br>
The procedure measured friction during the first 10 minutes of drying after application onto a surface. The test is conducted in an environmentally controlled chamber at 21 °C and 20% relative humidity. Sample size of 100 microliters is spread on a Lucite table over a 6 by 1.25 inch area (2.54 cm to the inch). The table is attached to the cross-head of an Instron Model 4501 Materials Testing System. A 3 by 1 inch 15 gram aluminum sled covered with a 100% rayon non-woven is pulled across the same area at a rate of 10 cm/min, starting one minute after application and repeated each minute for ten minutes. The integral of force versus a distance of 40 mm (i.e. amount of work of dynamic slip friction units of gram-mm) is calculated for each of the intervals. Also measured is the static load (grams) or stick. Three runs are conducted for each product<br>
Formulas and Results<br>
A series of samples were prepared for the evaluations.    The formulas are<br>
recorded in table 2.<br><br>

Results of the Instron tests are recorded in table 3. Lower values for stick indicate less stickiness (tack) of the sample. Stickiness (tack) is an undesirable skinfeel. Likewise lower values of friction indicate improved feel aesthetics.<br>

Samples 1-4 demonstrate that the most frictionless performance for the ethoxylated polyurethane peaked around 0.15%. Levels between 0.075 and 0.5% were within an operative range. Small amounts of cocoa butter were also useful as shown by comparison of sample 2 with sample 7. Likewise, performance was increased by the presence of hydrogenated polyisobutene as reflected in samples 8-10.<br><br>
