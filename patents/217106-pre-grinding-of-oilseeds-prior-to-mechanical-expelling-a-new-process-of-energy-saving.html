				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Oil expelling in India is usually done using mechanical expellers. In the oil expelling by mechanical expeller, generally seed is fed at 10% moisture content (wet basis) and then cake is again fed three times to get optimum oil recovery. Energy and time requirement in oil expelling through mechanical expeller are important factors that affect the cost of oil. Increase in number of passes required to get optimum oil recovery will lead to more time and energy requirement. Reducing number of passes lead to reduced energy requirement and expelling time. Grinding of the mustard seed at 10% moisture content (wet basis) to &lt; 0.5 mm size particles eliminates the requirement of fourth pass for oil expelling through mechanical expeller. Thus, 4% more oil can be recovered up to third pass only compare to oil expelling without grinding. Oil expelling from grounded mustard seed at 10% moisture content (wet basis) reduces the energy requirement by approximately 21% and oil expelling time by 25%.</td>

				<td>3.1	Introduction: Oil expelling is of interest as a potential on farm or community<br>
enterprise that can increase income and employment in rural areas. Many seeds, nuts and<br>
kernels contain oil that can be extracted and used for human consumption as well as<br>
industrial applications. Most of the oil expelling in India is done using mechanical<br>
expellers. Expellers achieve the pressure needed to express the oil by means of an auger<br>
that turns inside a barrel. The barrel is closed, except for openings through which oil<br>
drains. Generally four passes are given to the seed to extract oil by mechanical expellers.<br>
Increasing surface area may lead to exposing the meal and capillaries in which oil is<br>
present and hence, more oil can be recovered in less number of passes.<br>
3.2	Problem: In the oil expelling by mechanical expeller, generally seed is fed at 10%<br>
moisture content (wet basis) and then cake is again fed three times to get optimum oil<br>
recovery. So, increase in number of passes required to get optimum oil recovery will lead<br>
to more time and energy requirement. If number of passes required to get the same oil<br>
recovery can be reduced, it will reduce the energy requirement and hence energy can be<br>
saved. This will reduce the time required to extract oil also. If this can be achieved<br>
through simple means, it can be more advantageous.<br>
3.3	Description of the present invention: In this process mechanical expeller of one ton<br>
per day capacity was used. The Laxmi variety of mustard seed was used for experiments.<br>
The expeller has a 7.5 horsepower three-phase electric motor. It is a batch type expeller,<br>
and maximum capacity per batch is 35 kg. As per manufacturer's specifications, the<br>
material has to give four passes to get optimum oil recovery and around 7-9% oil is left in<br>
the cake. Whole mustard seed is fed at optimum moisture content (10-12%, wet basis)<br>
and then cake is fed three times. Around 60% oil is recovered in first pass, 15% in second<br>
pass, 10-15% in third pass, 5-10% in fourth pass and rest oil is left with cake. Passing<br>
cake for the fifth time gives very less (1-2%) oil recovery and more time is required to<br>
complete the pass. Burning of cake may also be possible.<br>
In the invention, first mustard seed was cleaned and graded. Grading was done using a cleaner with scalping screen of 2.1 mm round hole and grading screen of 1.18 mm round hole. The moisture content of the graded material was optimized for oil recovery. It was observed that 10% moisture content (wet basis) is most suitable for oil expelling. Whole mustard seed was fed to the expeller in 30 kg batch at 10% moisture content (wet basis) and four passes were given. Oil recovery, residual oil in cake in each pass was noted. Time and energy required in each pass was also recorded. The process flow chart of the oil expelling from whole mustard seed is as follows;<br>

Same graded material was first conditioned to 10% moisture content (wet basis) for 12 hours and then ground. A grinder developed by CIPHET, Ludhiana was used for grinding. The maximum dimension of the ground seed was less than 0.5 mm. Then 30 kg ground material was fed to oil expeller. Oil recovery and oil left in cake in each pass was recorded. Total three passes were given to the material. The process flow chart of the oil expelling is as follows;<br>

Oil<br>
The grinder is of 100 kg /hour capacity and one horsepower three-phase motor operates the grinder. It has two mild steel rolls rotating in opposite direction with gap adjusting mechanism.<br>
In the invention, it was observed that time required for first pass varies from 20-22 minutes. In second pass time required was 10-15 minutes. Third pass needed 10-15 minutes whereas fourth pass needed 10-13 minutes. Oil recovery in material without grinding is given in table 1 .<br>
Table 1: Percent oil recovery and oil left with cake of samples without grinding<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Oil recovery and residual oil in cake was recorded for material fed after grinding. Time required for each pass was same as of material fed without grinding. Data of oil recovery and residual oil in cake is given in table 2.<br>
Table 2: Percent oil recovery and oil left with cake of samples with grinding<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
From table 1 and table 2, it can be observed that oil recovery in the first pass of ground material is more than that of unground material. Again, residual oil in cake after third pass of ground material is 6-9% whereas residual oil in cake after third pass of unground material is 10-13% and in cake after fourth pass is 7-9%.<br>
Thus, grinding of the mustard seed prior to oil expelling through mechanical expeller may reduce the need of fourth pass to get the same recovery of oil.<br>
Time and energy required in each pass of unground and ground seed was also recorded. Data on time and energy required is given in Table 3.<br>
Table 3: Data on oil expelling time and energy required in each pass for unground and ground mustard seed<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Thus, from table 3, it can be observed that around 21% energy can be saved (subtracting the energy required for grinding the seed). This is achieved by eliminating the requirement of the fourth pass. Expelling time is reduced by 25%.<br>
Hence, oil expelling from grounded mustard seed (
<br>
4. Claim:<br>
We claim<br>
(a)	that the grinding of the mustard seed at 10% moisture content (wet basis)<br>
eliminates the requirement of fourth pass for oil expelling through mechanical<br>
expeller. 4% more oil can be recovered up to third pass only compare to oil<br>
expelling without grinding.<br>
(b)	that the grinding of the mustard seed at 10% moisture content (wet basis)<br>
reduces the energy requirement by approximately 21%.<br>
(c)	That the grinding of the mustard seed at 10% moisture content (wet basis)<br>
reduces the oil expelling time by 25%.<br></td>
