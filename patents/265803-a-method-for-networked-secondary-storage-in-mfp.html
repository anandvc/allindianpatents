FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention in general relates to a Multifunction Peripheral (MFP) device. Particularly the present invention relates to a plug-in application in an MFP More particularly the present invention relates to a method for networked secondary storage in M FP.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Low-end MFPs do not provide enough functional capabilities and features because of the low built-in memory available with itself. Similarly, the functional capabilities and features of higher-end MFPs cannot be enhanced because of the limits in the built-in memory available with them. Further, the limits in the amount of built-in memory restricts the enhancements that can be brought in the features like adding additional features and/or functional capabilities in the existing system. It also restricts the effective and efficient utilization of the available memory resources and networked peripherals connected to it; and also reduces the processing capability of the MFP due to the memory dependency of the processes. For example, a scan operation would scan a document, but if there is not enough memory to write the scanned data, the operation will have to be run the operation in parts. Similarly, a read operation will run better with increased memory resources.<br>
However attempts have been made to include a local hard-disk with a file system to manage the usage of the memory. However, the cost increases because of the additional resource included and the computational overhead in managing the additional resource is high.<br>
Patent publication US6216197B1 titled," Method and apparatus for extending printer memory using a network file system", describes a secondary memory for use with a computer output device such as a printer. As discussed in the patent<br><br>
'publication, the secondary memory is the system memory of the plurality of computers connected to the printer. When the allocated printer memory for a particular function falls short of the required memory for a print job, the less used data from the printer memory is moved to the secondary memory. This frees the space on the printer memory for the print job. Further, the patent publication also mentions the presence of a memory extension mechanism that extends the memory when the printer memory falls short of the memory required by a particular print job. However the patent publication does not explicitly mention the presence of a memory allocation/de-allocation mechanism but it mentions that the extended memory is freed after the print job is completed and the data is moved back to the printer memory.<br>
Another patent publication US6567184B2 titled, "Network system, printer, and information memory medium", describes a method and a system by which a printer on a network makes use of the memory of other devices on the network for processing print requests prior to printing. The devices on the network can be computers that use their own system memory for performing the processing request from the printer. When the printer receives a print job request that it cannot process, given its limited memory, it queries other devices on the network for available memory and other capabilities. The request is then transferred by the printer to a device that is capable of performing the processing part of the request. The processed request is then sent to the printer for printing. Dynamic allocation/de-allocation of memory and processing capabilities of other devices to the printer is not explicitly mentioned. The patent publication mentions that the allocation of a network device to the printer is based upon the queries made by the printer to the devices on the network. Further, according to the patent publication, the network device performing the processing of the request is freed upon completion of the request.<br><br>
NUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to propose a method for networked secondary storage in MFP, which is unique.<br>
The present invention relates to the networked secondary storage in MFP. The PC can be connected to an MFP through communication channels such as network ports and USB ports. The connected PC can be a network or a standalone device. The proposed invention proposes a method by which the MFP can share the system memory of the PC and hence increase its functional and computational capabilities which were earlier limited due to the small primary memory available within the MFP. The invention further includes the use of a stand-alone application to dynamically allocate or de-allocate the secondary memory for use by the MFP. Requests for use of the MFP can also be managed using the secondary memory.<br>
Accordingly the invention explains a method for networked secondary storage in MFP comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	connecting a secondary storage device to the    MFP through a communication channel;<br>
(b)	configuring an administrating module within the secondary storage to control the memory handling within the secondary storage; and<br>
(c)	allocating / de-allocating the secondary storage for use by the MFP<br>
The communication channel is a network port or a USB port. The secondary storage is networked or a standalone device. The secondary storage can be system memory of a personal computer. The MFP and the administrating module communicate using a set of pre defined commands. When the administration module receives pre defined commands from MFP, the module execute the corresponding pre defined action. When MFP receives pre- defined command from the administration module, then MFP does the corresponding pre-defined<br><br>
action. If any error is encountered in execution of a command the error message is displayed in the MFP or in the administration module. The administration module creates specified files and allocates memory to that file, during the allocation of secondary storage and informs the status back to MFP The administration module delete specified files and de-allocate memory, during the de-allocation of secondary storage and informs the status back to MFP.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts a Flow Diagram of Scan and Store method.<br>
Figure 2 depicts a Flow Diagram of Retrieve and Print method.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for connecting the MFP with an available networked PC to extend the memory of the MFP.    The additional<br><br>
■■■memory requirements of the MFP is therefore solved by utilizing the memory of the PC; thereby allowing the functional capabilities and the features to be enhanced and allowing increased support of functional capabilities and features.<br>
In an example where the MFP has a scanner or printer, the printer may be capable of handling ten store and print jobs (Initially all the documents are scanned and stored in memory and printed at a later point of time). At the same time, this printer has 2MB of in-built memory for storing scanned documents. If the first print job exhausts the available 2MB of space, then even though the printer can handle 10 print jobs, the printer cannot begin with the other queued jobs.<br>
In accordance with the current invention, the printer is connected with a networked PC. The printer therefore uses the hard-disk of the PC to store/process the queued jobs. The printer and the PC are connected via an available communication port such as the USB port. Software residing (or installed) within the hard disk of the PC would drive the process, control the memory utilization within the PC by the printer, etc.<br>
Application software that runs on a PC similar to a printer driver will manage the Memory Allocation and De- Allocation. This Application software will be written to OS specific which will make use of the OS calls to create a new file with specified file name or delete a specified file name. This basically acts as an interface between MFP and PC having Memory. The MFP and the application will use a set of pre defined commands through which they communicate. These pre defined values can be anything like some hex value, which when received from MFP application takes some pre defined actions like create a file, read data and store, etc. If MFP receives such command from Application then it does some predefined action like validating the result, show appropriate error message, send data to application, receive data and forward it to printer, etc. The physical Layer might change if USB it becomes a stand alone PC if network cable then a networked PC. When ever the networked PC or stand alone PC is accessed the connection details are checked for further processing.<br><br>
Figure 1 describes a scan and store process .Step 1 indicates the starting of the store and print job Then a check is made to confirm whether the count is less than the maximum number of stored jobs (step 2). If the count is less then scan is started (step 3). If multiple pages are there (step 4),the pages are scanned to the buffer memory and if memory exist in MFP (step 5) the said data is stored in the MFP memory (step 6). once scanning starts the memory availability of MFP is checked and if present then scanned data is stored in MFP memory itself, else the connection of MFP to PC is checked (step 7).If connection exists then command is send to check whether the application is installed to Memory Manage (step 8) This is a pre-requisite. If installed the application will be listening for command from MFP through the connection. The Application will respond. Once MFP gets the response it sends the data to be stored along with File name (step 10 ). The application will call the OS to create the specified file (step 11) and allocate memory to that file, and responds status back to MFP (steps 12 ) MFP on receipt of success(step 13) will send further data to PC (step 14) , and application will continue to store data in PC, MFP sets a FLAG in its memory to denote that while retrieving data it should fetch data from PC (steps 13, 14, 15 of Fig 1) Respective error messages are displayed to the user appropriately, (step 16 of Fig 1).<br>
Figure 2 describes the retrieval and print procedure. It starts with the start storing the print job function and selecting the first print job (step 1, step 2, step 3) once MFP receives the Print Store Jobs it checks for the FLAG (step 4) if false it retrieves from internal memory and prints the same (step 5), else it checks for connection to PC(step 6), checks for the software installed (step 7), if installed (step 9) send command to PC including the File name (steps 10 ).Application after receiving the File name will retrieve the data from the file stored and send it via the connection(step 11). Also error messages if any are shown to the user (step 12). If no error (step 13) the received data is forwarded to the printer (step 14). Further to this if Application receives command to delete the File name (step 15) it will do so by calling OS specific calls (step 16).<br><br>
The invention can be implemented for any of the MFP features like color (or b/w) scanning, receiving and sending color fax and IP fax. Further the invention can be implemented to enhance the storage capacity of the printer, in the case of fax jobs, scanned jobs and delayed jobs and it is also applicable in multiple-job handling capability of the printer.<br>
Further advantages of the invention can be summarized as follows:<br>
1.	Customizing secondary memory pointers for various users on their own PC in a network. For example, a particular user can have many print jobs queued on their PC memory (instead of the memory of the printer) and therefore the printer job handling capability in the network increases.<br>
2.	The PC can store the scanned data in a delay job (e.g., a delay fax) within the PC memory and allow the system to handle the fax operation later. Thus, the number of delay jobs that the system can handle at any given time can be increased.<br>
3.	Possible inclusions of network document scan capability through the use of additional memory resource (of the PC).<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood<br><br>
!as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
