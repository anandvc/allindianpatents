				<td>OPTICALLY READABLE MEDIA<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION;<br>
This invention relates to optically readable information storage media and, more<br>
particularly, to a technique for rendering a reading inhibit layer lightfast<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It has become commonplace to distribute software or other information, such as music and<br>
films, on optically readable media, such as CDs and DVDs. Successful readout of an<br>
optical disk by current disk readers heavily relies on a number of parameters that<br>
characterize the readout laser beam on its path from the laser to the reflective data layer<br>
of the disk and back to the optical pickup system of the reader. The electromagnetic wave<br>
structure of the readout beam is described by intensity, phase, polarization, and wave<br>
vectors of the wave components that constitute the readout beam. The wave structure of<br>
the beam determines geometrical and propagation parameters of the beam, such as beam<br>
size, angle of incidence, and angle of convergence.<br>
In addition to reading the data layer of a disk, the reader performs other functions, which<br>
are as critical for playability as the data readout itself. These functions include auto-<br>
focusing, auto-tracking and error correction. The first two functions allow the reader<br>
device to actively control motion of the laser head and spindle motor in order to maintain<br>
the required position of the beam relative to the disk. Therefore, maintaining the integrity<br>
of the wave structure of the beam throughout its path inside the disk material is a key not<br>
only to the successful detection and decoding of the information carried by the beam, but<br>
also for the continuity of the readout process.<br>
It is desirable in many applications to limit the duration of time during which the optical<br>
disk can be read. For example, one could rent an optical disk containing a film or a<br>
musical composition that, after some period of time, would become unreadable. In this<br>
case there would be no need to return the optical disk to place where it was rented.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,815,484 discloses an optical disk having a reflective metallic layer with<br>
a plurality of data structures (provided in the form of pits and lands) and a compound that<br>
reacts with oxygen that is superimposed over at least some of the data structures for<br>
inhibiting reading of the information.<br>
Commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,011,772 discloses a read inhibit mechanism that<br>
may also use a barrier layer. For example, the removal of a barrier layer enhances the<br>
action of a reading-inhibit agent to prevent machine reading of information encoding<br>
features on the optical disk. The reading-inhibit agent may also be activated by exposure<br>
to optical radiation, or by rotation of the disk.<br>
A disadvantage of some chemical moieties used in or proposed for use in a reading inhibit<br>
layer is that they exhibit poor lightfastness, which could allow the limited play optical disk<br>
to be photobleached and subsequently converted back, possiblypermanently, to areadable<br>
optical disk.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is a first object and advantage of this invention to provide an improved system and<br>
method for permanently limiting the readability of a media, such as an optically readable<br>
media, examples of which include, but are not limited to, a laser disk, a compact disk<br>
(CD), or a digital video disk (DVD).<br>
It is a second object and advantage of this invention to provide an improved system and<br>
method to render an optically readable media permanently unreadable, after having been<br>
read at least once.<br>
It is a further object and advantage of this invention to provide an optically readable media<br>
having a read inhibit layer that is rendered lightfast by the addition of a chemical<br>
compound.<br>
It is a another object and advantage of this invention to provide an optically readable<br>
media having a read inhibit layer that is resistant to being photobleached back to a<br>
readable state.<br>
It is one further object and advantage of this invention to provide an optically readable<br>
media having a read inhibit layer and a protective layer. The protective layer may also<br>
function as a barrier layer, and overlies the read inhibit layer. The protective layer includes<br>
an additive that oxidizes and becomes optically absorbing at the readout wavelength(s) in<br>
response to a source of light, such as UV light, that would also photobleach the read inhibit<br>
layer back to an optically transmissive and, hence, optically readable state.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The foregoing and other problems are overcome and the objects and the advantages of the<br>
invention are realized by methods and systems in accordance with embodiments of this<br>
invention.<br>
An optically readable media, such as a CD or a DVD, has an information-encoding layer<br>
and at least one color-forming layer that embodies an optical readout-limiting mechanism.<br>
In a first embodiment the at least one color-forming layer contains an additive that does<br>
not interfere with the optical readability of the media for a duration of a readout period.<br>
The additive, upon exposure to a source of optical radiation that is suitable for reversing<br>
the color-forming layer from an optical readout inhibiting state to an optical readout<br>
enabling state, undergoes a transformation that maintains the color-forming layer in the<br>
optical readout inhibiting state. More specifically, exposure to the source causes the color-<br>
forming layer to photobleach and the additive to oxidize, where the oxidation of the<br>
additive permanently inhibits the optical readability of the media The additive may be a<br>
leuco dye. In one embodiment the color-forming layer includes 3-[2,2-bis(4-<br>
diemylanimophenyl)vinyl]-6-dimethylaminophthalide and the additive includes benzoyl<br>
leucomethylene blue. In a further embodiment the additive is placed into a protective layer<br>
that overlies the color-forming layer.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The above set forth and other features of the invention are made more apparent in the<br>
ensuing Detailed Description of the Invention when read in conjunction with the attached<br>
Drawing, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view of an optically readable media that includes a lightfast<br>
readout inhibiting layer in accordance with this invention; and<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an equilibrium mechanism between a colorless lactone form and its<br>
cationic colored quininoid form in the optical readout inhibiting layer of Fig. 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view of an optically readable media 10 that includes a lightfast<br>
readout inhibiting layer 12 in accordance with this invention. It should be noted at the<br>
outset that as employed herein an optically readable media is intended to encompass a<br>
number of various devices wherein data (such as a computer program), audio (such as<br>
music) and/or video (such as a film or television programming), collectively referred to<br>
herein simply as information or content, is stored such that it can be readout when a<br>
lightbeam (either visible light or invisible light) is applied to the medium. Such a medium<br>
can include, but is not limited to laser disks, compact disks (CDs), CD-ROMs, digital<br>
video or versatile disks and certain kinds of tapes.<br>
The media 10 includes a substrate 14, a patterned, reflective surface 16 wherein the<br>
information is encoded using conventional techniques, the readout inhibiting layer 12, and<br>
optionally a top coat 18 or over coat that can function as a protective layer as well as a<br>
barrier layer to at least partially inhibit or slow the evaporation or sublimation of a reactive<br>
compound from the readout inhibiting layer 12. Reference in this regard can be made to<br>
commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application No.: 09/690,405, filed on 10/17/00, as well<br>
as to commonly assigned and allowed U.S. Patent Application No.: 09/338,959, filed on<br>
06/24/99, both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.<br>
In general, the media 10 of interest to this invention incorporates the readout inhibiting<br>
mechanism or layer 12 that is capable of altering an optical property of the light, for<br>
example, the wavefront, optical noise content, intensity and/or wave emission wavelength.<br>
Also, the reflectance and/or transmission property of the media can be changed.<br>
Limiting or inhibiting the readout of the media 10 can be effected by using a color forming<br>
coating. Such a coating functions as the readout-limiting layer 12 by initially permitting,<br>
when in a first state, an optically readable media to be read; after which the coating<br>
changes to a second state in which the coating prevents the readable of the media 10. The<br>
color forming coating changes color, or more precisely transitions from a substantially<br>
transparent state (at the readout wavelength(s) of interest) to a substantially absorbing state<br>
(again at the readout wavelength(s) of interest), thereby inhibiting readout of the media 10.<br>
By rendering the media "unreadable" it should be understood that it is not necessary to<br>
make the entire media 10 unreadable. For example, it may be necessary to make only a<br>
relatively small portion of a boot record or a directory of contents unreadable such that the<br>
entire media becomes unusable or unreadable, or such that some predetermined portion<br>
of the media becomes unusable or unreadable. Making the media unreadable may also<br>
imply adversely affecting a readout device optical feedback and tracking process.<br>
Further, it is not necessary for the readout inhibiting layer 12 to become optically opaque,<br>
as the media 10 may become unreadable or unplayable well before a state or condition of<br>
optical opacity is reached. In general, the readout inhibiting layer 12 can be effective in<br>
inhibiting the reading of desired information from the media 10 by causing a failure in any<br>
of at least three readout light beam functions: data readout, auto-focusing, and auto-<br>
tracking.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, in a presently preferred but not limiting embodiment the readout<br>
inhibiting layer 12, which may also be referred to as the color forming coating, includes<br>
at least three components: (1) a dye, such as a lactone type dye; (2) acidic sites; and (3) a<br>
solvent, such as an amine or amide-based solvent. The acidic sites may be provided by<br>
a polymer, a clay, or any other acidic substrate. When the components are combined, the<br>
amine or amide-based solvent serves to stabilize the lactone dye to the colorless form.<br>
When the amide or amine-based solvent evaporates, the lactone group reacts with the<br>
acidic sites and undergoes a ring opening to generate a highly colored substance with a<br>
strong absorption at a typical wavelength used to read DVD and CD disks (about 650 nm).<br>
In greater detail, the colorless lactone shown in the reaction scheme shown in Fig. 2 is<br>
protonated by an acid. Each nitrogen is shown with its free electron pair. The protonated<br>
lactone undergoes a ring opening to produce the colored compound, in this case, a blue<br>
quininoid form.<br>
The functioning of this color changing system is based on a four component equilibrium<br>
between the colorless lactone form, the colored quininoid form, and the number of acidic<br>
and basic sites associated with the permanent and the volatile components of the color<br>
changing system.<br>
In various embodiments of this invention, the material that comprises the readout-<br>
inhibiting layer 12 can include a lactone dye, such as crystal violet lactone, poly-p-<br>
(hydroxystyrene), ethanol, N-methyl pyrrolidinone and ammonia and formaldehyde, or the<br>
readout inhibiting layer 12 can comprise cellulose acetate butyrate, ethyl acetate, silica gel,<br>
and benzyl alcohol, or the readout inhibiting layer 12 can comprise a salt of a volatile<br>
amine, a non-volatile acid component and a lactone dye or a pH indicator dye, or the<br>
readout inhibiting layer 12 can comprise a water damp polymer film containing a pH<br>
indicator dye, wherein during storage the readout inhibiting layer 12 is exposed to an<br>
atmosphere of a gas whose water solution is one of acidic or basic, and wherein upon<br>
removal from storage a volatile gas evaporates from the water damp film, and the pH<br>
changes causing a color change in the pH indicator dye.<br>
In the preferred embodiments, the readout inhibiting layer 12 contains a dye, such as a<br>
lactone dye, having a cation with strong light absorbance properties around 650 nm, a<br>
currently preferred wavelength for the readout laser. A polymer material or some other<br>
material can be used to provide an acidic environment for causing a controlled ring<br>
opening of the lactone dye, and which can be cross-linked or otherwise modified to form<br>
a relatively inert or inactive coating layer. Lactone dyes are generally colorless so long<br>
as the lactone moiety remains intact. However, by modifying the environment, for<br>
example by lowering the pH and/or by changing the micropolarity, the lactone ring is<br>
cleaved and the intensely colored cationic form of the dye is obtained.<br>
In general, the rate of color change is dependent on the type of solvent and its boiling<br>
point. By selecting an appropriate solvent, complete color formation can occur within a<br>
range of a few minutes to several hours to even longer times. Moreover, the final<br>
maximum absorbance at the readout wavelength can be modified over a range of<br>
absorbances by changing the lactone moiety to acidic site ratio.<br>
In other embodiments of this invention, a polymer may provide a basic environment while<br>
the evaporating solvent has an acidic nature. In this case the color change occurs when the<br>
system transitions from acidic to basic due to evaporation.<br>
The "undyed" state of the media 10 may be maintained by storing the media 10 in a<br>
manner that prevents the solvent from evaporating. For example, the media 10 can be<br>
stored in a sealed container, such as a foil or plastic bag, that may contain a source of the<br>
volatile component of the readout inhibiting layer 12. In this manner the atmosphere<br>
within the container becomes saturated with the volatile component, which in turn inhibits<br>
the loss by evaporation (or sublimation in some embodiments) of the volatile component<br>
form the readout inhibiting layer 12.<br>
In any of the embodiments, the readout inhibiting layer 12 may be applied by a spin<br>
coating procedure. As an example, for the amino-phthalide dye in the 4-vinylphenol<br>
polymer embodiment a layer thickness equal to or less than about one micrometer was<br>
found to be optimum, and DVD readability was found to be disabled when the absorbance<br>
at 650 nm was equal to or greater than about 0.5.<br>
However, if the colored quininoid form of the color forming compound does not have a<br>
satisfactory lightfastness, exposing the limited-play system to ultraviolet (UV) light, such<br>
as that found in sunlight, may induce a photochemical reaction and hence break down the<br>
colored quininoid form into a mixture of colorless chemical compounds. As a<br>
consequence, the unreadable media 10 might be made permanently optically readable by<br>
exposing the media 10 to UV light, or to direct or indirect (i.e. behind window glass)<br>
sunlight.<br>
In accordance with the teachings of this invention, the problem of the media 10 reversal<br>
back to readability can be solved by adding an additive either to the color forming coating<br>
12 or to the top polymer protective coating 18. The additive preferably is colorless and<br>
remains colorless under regular room light, as well as under normal media readout light<br>
wavelengths. However, the additive oxidizes under sunlight or UV light into a colored<br>
compound, and the oxidized form has an absorption spectrum that overlaps with the<br>
absorption spectrum of the selected colored quininoid form. The additive thus adds a<br>
superior lightfastness.<br>
The quininoid photobleaching kinetics, the additive photooxidation kinetics and the optical<br>
properties of the quininoid and additive components are preferably matched so that the<br>
loss in absorbance of the quininoid form due to photobleaching is corrected by the<br>
appearance of the colored photooxidized additive.<br>
The additive can be co-mixed with color former in a polymer formulation that is used<br>
when constructing the readout inhibiting layer 12 . The lightfastness-enhancing additive<br>
need not interact with the performance of the readout inhibiting layer 12 or the protective<br>
top polymer coating 18.<br>
The additives may belong to different chemical classes depending on the selected color<br>
former(s) of the readout inhibiting layer 12. One such chemical class comprises leuco<br>
dyes.<br>
As an example, an appropriate additive for the color former 3-[2,2-bis(4-<br>
diethylaminophenyl)vinyl]-6-dimethylaminophthalide is benzoyl leucomethylene blue.<br>
Exposure to UV light and sunlight transforms benzoyl leucomethylene blue into methylene<br>
blue. Methylene blue is well known for its superior lightfastness, and its absorption<br>
spectrum very closely matches the spectrum of the quininoid form of the color former in<br>
the readout inhibiting layer 12. This additive can be incorporated into the formulation<br>
described as Example 1 below and in the co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. Patent<br>
Application No.: 09/690,405, filed on 10/17/00, the disclosure of which was incorporated<br>
herein in its entirety.<br>
Example 1:<br>
A solution of 1 g poly(4-vinylphenol) (MW=8,000) in 10 ml ethanol, 2 ml N,N-dimethyl<br>
formamide and 200 mg of 3-[2,2-bis(4-diethylaminophenyl)vinyl)-6-<br>
dimethylaminophthalide was prepared. A surface of an optical disc was coated with this<br>
formulation to produce a 500-700 nm thick layer that was substantially uncolored. The<br>
coating was dried at 60-70°C for a few minutes, which caused the generation of an<br>
intensely blue colored dye. This blue dye was transformed to a colorless state by exposure<br>
to UV light.<br>
The additive, benzoyl leucomethylene blue, is incorporated in the Example 2 formulation<br>
as follows:<br>
Example 2:<br>
A solution was prepared of 1 g poly(4-vinylphenol) (MW=8,000) in 10 ml ethanol, 2 ml<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide, 200 mg of 3-[2,2-bis(4-diethylaminophenyl)vinyl]-6-<br>
dimethylaminophthalide and 200 mg of benzoyl leucomethylene blue. An optical disc was<br>
coated with this formulation to produce a 500-700 nm thick layer that was substantially<br>
uncolored. The coating was dried at 60-70°C for a few minutes, which caused the<br>
generation of an intensely blue colored dye corresponding to a limited-play, unreadable<br>
state of the disc. However, exposing the coating to sunlight or UV-light did not result in<br>
a transformation back to the colorless state, and thus did not defeat the limited-play<br>
mechanism.<br>
While described in the context of a single readout wavelength, it is within the scope of<br>
these teachings to render lightfast composite and multi-player (multi-wavelength) readout<br>
inhibiting layer or layers 12. Such multi-wavelength layer(s) provide absorption maxima<br>
at two or more wavelengths that coincide with possible readout light wavelengths, e.g.,<br>
630 nm and 780 nm for CDs, 630 nm and 650 nm for DVDs, and may also accommodate<br>
future higher density readout wavelengths at shorted wavelengths. The multi-wavelength<br>
coating can also be used to absorb a specific wavelength and a range of wavelengths, such<br>
as 635 nm and the range of 750 nm to 800 nm.<br>
It can be appreciated that a number of embodiments of the teachings of this invention have<br>
been described herein, and it should be further appreciated that the teachings of this<br>
invention are not intended to be read in a limiting sense to encompass only these described<br>
embodiments.<br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. An optically readable media 10 comprising :<br>
an information-encoding layer 16 ;<br>
at least one color-forming layer 12 that embodies an optical readout-limiting mechanism; said<br>
color-forming layer prohibits, once activated, the readout of said information encoding layer 16 ; and<br>
an additive 12 or 18, said additive undergoes a transformation upon exposure to a predefined<br>
optical wavelength to prohibit the color-forming layer from reversing from a read prohibiting state to a<br>
read enabling state and thereby preserving the color-forming layer in its read prohibiting state.<br>

diethylaminophenyl)vinyl]-6-dimethylaminophthalide and where said additive is comprised of benzoyl<br>
leucomethylene blue.<br>
4. The media as claimed in claim 1, wherein when in said readout inhibiting state said color-<br>
forming layer exhibits an optical wavelength absorption range that comprises an optical readout<br>
wavelength of said media, thereby inhibiting optical readout of said media.<br>
5. The media as claimed in claim 4, where exposure to said source of optical radiation causes said<br>
additive to oxidize and to exhibit an optical wavelength absorption range that overlaps with said optical<br>
wavelength absorption range of said color-forming layer, thereby permanently inhibiting the readability<br>
of said media.<br>
6. The media as claimed in claim 4, where exposure to said source causes said color-forming layer<br>

an optical readout-limiting mechanism. In a first embodiment the at least one color -<br>
forming layer contains an additive that does not interfere with the optical readability of<br>
the media for a duration of a readout period. The additive, upon exposure to a source of<br>
optical radiation that is suitable for reversing the color-forming layer from an optical<br>
radiation that is suitable for reversing the color-forming layer from an optical readout<br>
inhibiting state to an optical readout enabling state, undergoes a transformation that<br>
maintains the color-forming layer in the optical readout inhibiting state. More<br>
specifically, exposure to the source causes the color-forming layer to photobleach and<br>
the additive to oxidize, where the oxidation of the additive permanently inhibits the<br>
optical readability of the media. The additive may be a leuco dye. In one embodiment<br>
the color-forming layer is comprised of 3-[2,3-bis(4-diethylaminophenyl)vinyl]-6-<br>
dimethylaminophthalide and the additive is comprised of benzoyl leucomethylene blue.<br>
In a further embodiment the additive is placed into a protective layer (18) that overlies<br>
the color-forming layer.</td>
