				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to an improved method of lancing skin<br>
and, more particularly, to an improved system wherein the lancing element is<br>
removed after creating an incision and then reinserted into the incision at a<br>
lesser depth of penetration.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In in-situ testing of blood glucose, a glucose meter is placed against the skin and<br>
blood is sampled and measured without moving the meter. In one method of in-<br>
situ testing, a glucose sensor strip is combined with a lancing element positioned<br>
at a distal end thereof, the glucose sensor strip is then positioned in a meter<br>
adapted to launch the strip and lancing element combination toward the skin<br>
where the lancing element forms an incision. Blood or other bodily fluids such as,<br>
for example, interstitial fluid, may then be extracted from the incision and moved<br>
to the glucose sensor strip where it can be measured using, for example, an<br>
electrochemical process.<br>
When lancing skin using an in-situ test strip, it is desirable to ensure that blood<br>
be transferred efficiently from the incision to the test strip, using as little blood<br>
as possible. Efficient transfer of blood from the incision means that more of the<br>
blood is actually used to test for analyte (e.g. glucose) levels, reducing the total<br>
blood required and, therefore, the incision size required for the test. Smaller<br>
incisions are particularly desirable because, in general, it is desirable to reduce<br>
the pain experienced by the user. Further, smaller incisions generally heal faster<br>
and are not as likely to re-open once healed.<br><br>
Thus, when using an in-situ test, it is desirable to create an incision which is very<br>
small while maximizing the amount of blood generated by that incision. A<br>
number of factors influence the amount of blood generated by a particular<br>
incision. Many of those factors cannot be controlled. One of the factors whicn<br>
reduces the amount of blood available at a particular incision is the tendency of<br>
the incision to close and reseal after the lancing element is removed. Another<br>
factor which reduces the amount of blood available at a particular incision is the<br>
tendency of the wound to seal around the lancing element if the lancing element<br>
is left in the wound.<br>
It would, therefore, be advantageous to develop a method of lancing which<br>
increases the amount of blood available for testing at a particular incision site. It<br>
would further be advantageous to develop a method of lancing which increases<br>
the amount of blood available for lancing by preventing the wound from<br>
resealing during the testing process. It would further be advantageous to<br>
develop a system of lancing skin through an outer surface of said skin to obtain a<br>
sample of blood which increases the amount of blood available for lancing by<br>
preventing the wound from sealing around the lancing element during the<br>
testing process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a according to the present invention, a lancing tip is first inserted and then is<br>
retracted completely out of the lance wound site. The lancing tip is then re-<br>
inserted into the same wound to a depth which is shallower than the original<br>
penetration. This method of lancing facilitates the expression of blood and its<br>
seamless transfer into a test strip integrated with a lance.<br><br>
In a system according to the present inventiop/the lancing element is inserted<br>
through an outer surface of the skin to obtain a sample of blood. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention, the method includes using a lancing instrument<br>
having a sharpened end and a fluid channel extending from the sharpened end<br>
to a sensor attached to a proximal end of the lancing instrument, forcing the<br>
sharpened tip of the lancing element into the skin to a first predetermined depth,<br>
wherein the sharpened tip creates an incision in the skin surface and a------------<br>
wound below the skin surface and completely withdrawing the lancing element,<br>
including the sharpened tip. After completely withdrawing the sharpened tip from<br>
the incision, sharpened tip is forced back into the incision to a second<br>
predetermined depth, wherein the second predetermined depth is not as deep as<br>
the first predetermined depth. Once the sharpened tip is positioned at the<br>
second predetermined depth, blood is drawn through the channel to the sensor.<br>
In a system in accordance with the present invention, as set forth above, the<br>
system may further include ensuring that the second predetermined depth is<br>
sufficient to ensure that a distal end of the channel is positioned below the<br>
surface of the skin. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
method may include setting the first predetermined depth in the range of<br>
approximately 0.25 to 1.5 mm. Further, in one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
method may include setting the second predetermined depth is in the range of<br>
approximately 0.05 to 0.25mm.<br>
In a system according to the present invention, the lancing element is inserted<br>
through an outer surface of the skin to obtain a sample of blood. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention, the method includes providing pressure on the skin j<br>
in a region surrounding the incision site (i.e. the site where the incision is to be<br>
made). Then using a lancing instrument having a sharpened end and a fluid<br>
channel extending from the sharpened end to a sensor attached to a proximal<br>
end of the lancing instrument, forcing the sharpened tip of the lancing element<br>
into the skin to a first predetermined depth, wherein the sharpened tip creates<br>
an incision in the skin surface and a wound below the skin surface and<br>
completely withdrawing the lancing element, including the sharpened tip. After<br>
completely withdrawing the sharpened tip from the incision, sharpened tip is<br>
forced back into the incision to a second predetermined depth, wherein the<br>
second predetermined depth is not as deep as the first predetermined depth.<br>
Once the sharpened tip is positioned at the second predetermined depth, blood<br>
is drawn through the channel to the sensor.<br>
In system according to the present invention, a lancing tip is extended beyond<br>
an opening at a distal end of a lancing device, such as, for example, an in-situ<br>
meter. The................................................................................................................<br>
lancing tip is extended to a first extension length beyond the opening to create a<br>
would and then retracted past the opening. The lancing tip is then re-extended<br>
past the opening to a second extension length which is less than the first<br>
extension length and blood is drawn up the lancing element from the wound into<br>
a test strip integrated with a lance.<br>
In a system according to the present invention, the lancing element is extended<br>
a first distance past an opening and through an outer surface of the skin to<br>
obtain a sample of blood. In one embodiment of the invention, the method<br>
includes using a lancing instrument having a sharpened end and a fluid channel<br>
extending from the sharpened end to a sensor attached to a proximal end of the<br>
lancing instrument, extending the sharpened tip a first extension length beyond<br>
an opening, forcing the sharpened tip of the lancing element into the skin,<br>
wherein the sharpened tip creates an incision in the skin surface and a wound<br>
below the skin surface, withdrawing the lancing element into the opening and<br>
extending the sharpened tip a second extension length beyond the opening,<br>
wherein the second extension depth is less than the first extension depth. Once<br>
the sharpened tip is positioned at the second extension depth, blood is drawn<br>
through the channel to the sensor.<br>
In a system in accordance with the present invention, as set forth above, the<br>
method may further include ensuring that the extension length is sufficient to<br>
ensure that a distal end of the channel is positioned below surface of the<br>
skin. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, the method may include<br><br>
setting the first extension length in the range of approximately 0.25 to 1.5 mm.<br>
Further, in one embodiment of the invention, the method may include setting the<br>
second extension length is in the range of approximately 0.05 to 0.25mm.<br><br>
In a system according to the present invention, the lancing element is inserted<br>
through an outer surface of the skin to obtain a sample blood. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention, the method includes providing pressure on the skin<br>
in a region surrounding the incision site (i.e. the site where the incision is to be<br>
made). Then using a lancing instrument having a sharpened end and a fluid<br>
channel extending from the sharpened end to a sensor attached to a proximal<br>
end of the lancing instrument, forcing the sharpened tip of the...........................<br>
lancing element though an opening into the skin to a first extension length<br>
beyond the opening, wherein the sharpened tip creates an incision in the skin<br>
surface and a wound below the skin surface and completely withdrawing the<br>
lancing element, including the sharpened tip into the opening. After completely<br>
withdrawing the sharpened tip into the opening, extending the sharpened tip<br>
through the opening and into the incision to a second extension length beyond<br>
the opening, wherein the second extension length is not as long as the first<br>
extension length. Once the sharpened tip is positioned at the second extension<br>
length, blood is drawn through the channel to the sensor.<br>
In a system in accordance with the present invention, as set forth above, the<br>
method may further include providing a milking ring wherein the pressure in the<br>
region surrounding the incision site is exerted by the milking ring. The milking<br>
ring is positioned on the skin prior to the step of forcing the sharpened tip into<br>
the skin and may be maintained throughout the remainder of the procedure. In<br>
this embodiment of the invention, the milking ring provides a pressure sufficient<br>
to facilitate the flow of bodily fluids into the channel after the reinsertion of the<br>
lancing tip into the wound. In one embodiment of the invention, the milking ring<br>
provides a pressure in a range of approximately 0.5 to 1.5 pounds. In a further<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the method may include positioning the<br>
milking ring against the skin for a predetermined period of time prior to<br>
launching the lancing element. In a further embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the predetermined period of time may be three seconds or more.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a lancing element and strip for use in a method<br>
according to the present invention. In Figure 1, lancing element 15 is connected to sensor<br>
strip 100. Sensor strip 100 may be, for example, a glucose sensor strip which uses<br>
electrochemistry to measure the amount of glucose in a bodily fluid, such as, for example,<br>
blood or interstitial fluid. In Figure 1, lancing element further includes lancing tip 22. Sensor<br>
strip 100 further includes first electrode contact 10, adhesive layer 11, conductive substrate<br>
12, vent hole 13, analyte sensing layer 14, second electrode contact 17, insulating substrate<br>
18, insulating layer 20, registration hole 23 and working electrode 36.<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view of the top layer of a lancing element and strip for use in<br>
a method according to the present invention. In Figure 2 top layer is formed of conductive<br>
substrate 12. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 2, conductive substrate 12 includes vent<br>
hole 13 and registration hole 23. In Figure 2, lancing element includes lancing tip 22, channel<br>
tip 24 and fill channel 21.<br>
One embodiment of a lancing element and sensor strip suitable for use in a method<br>
according to the present invention may be described with reference to Figures 1 and 2. In the<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, sensor strip 100 includes first electrode contact 10,<br>
wherein first electrode contact may be screen printed on an insulating substrate 18, and a<br>
second electrode contact 17, wherein said second electrode contact comprises a portion of<br>
conductive substrate 12 which is contiguous with top reference electrode 19 and lancing<br>
element 15.<br>
In the embodiment of the lancing element and sensor strip illustrated in Figures 1 and<br>
2, the orientation of said first electrode contact 10 and second electrode contact 17 are<br>
arranged such that an analyte measurement meter, such as, for example, a glucose meter (not<br>
shown) can establish electrical contact with sensor strip 100. In the illustrated embodiment,<br>
the electrodes are arranged on the same side of insulating substrate 18 to facilitate contact of<br>
both electrodes at the proximal end of sensor strip 100.<br>
Sensor strip 100 is manufactured using adhesive layer 11 to attach insulating substrate<br>
18 to conductive substrate 12. Adhesive layer 11 could be implemented in a number of ways,<br>
including using pressure sensitive material, heat activated material, or UV cured double sided<br>
adhesive material. Conductive substrate 12 may be, for example, a conductive substrate that<br>
is a sheet of electrically conductive material such as gold or plated stainless steel. The<br>
geometry of conductive substrate 12 may be formed by, for example, stamping process or<br>
photo-etching. In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, lancing element 15 may be<br>
manufactured as an integral part of conductive substrate 12. Vent hole 13, may be formed by,<br>
for example, punching through conductive layer 12. Vent hole 13 is used to facilitate the<br>
transport of bodily fluid up lancing element 15 and across analyte sensing layer 14.<br>
Registration hole 23 may be formed during the stamping process of making conductive<br>
substrate 12.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, analyte sensing layer 14 may be, for example, a<br>
glucose sensing layer, including an enzyme, a buffer, and a redox mediator. Analyte sensing<br>
layer 14 may preferably be deposited on top of working electrode 36. Where analyte sensing<br>
layer 14 is used to detect the presence and concentration of glucose in a bodily fluid, at least a<br>
portion of glucose sensing layer 14 dissolves in the bodily fluid and is used to convert the<br>
glucose concentration into an electrically measured parameter which is proportional to the<br>
glucose concentration in the sample.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, lancing element 15 has a proximal<br>
and distal end and the proximal end is integrated with the top reference electrode 19 and said<br>
distal end is integrated with a lancing tip 22 and channel tip 24. The lancing element is<br>
formed by the process of stamping or photo-etching a conductive material sheet and bending<br>
it to the geometry shown in Figure 2. In one embodiment, lacing tip 22 and channel tip 24 are<br>
slightly offset by about 0.005 to 0.020", the design of lancing element 15 is adapted to assist<br>
in improving skin separation. The geometry illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 may enhance fluid<br>
egress because it helps spread and hold open a skin wound. In the embodiment illustrated in<br>
Figures 1 and 2, the lancing element 15 is contiguous with the top reference electrode 19 and<br>
electrode contact 17.<br>
In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 2, lancing element 15<br>
includes fill channel 21, wherein capillary fill channel 21 facilitates the flow of body fluid<br>
from the wound to the analyte sensing layer 14. Fill channel 21 may facilitate the flow of<br>
bodily fluids by, for example, wicking or capillary action. In the embodiment illustrated in<br>
Figures 1 and 2 fill channel 21 has an open geometry which facilitates the wicking of viscous<br>
samples and provides for simpler manufacturing techniques when compared with closed<br>
capillary channels.<br>
In the embodiment of sensor strip 100 illustrated in Figure 1, insulating substrate 18<br>
consists of material such as polyester or ceramic on which a conductive material can be<br>
printed onto the insulating layer through silk-screening, sputtering, or electro-less deposition.<br>
Conductive material deposited on insulating substrate 18 forms first electrode contact 10 and<br>
working electrode 36. Insulating layer 20 may be, for example, screen printed to form a<br>
boundary for the electrode contact 10 and the bottom working electrode.<br>
Figure 3A is a perspective view of a lancing element tip immediately before<br>
penetration of the surface of the skin. More particularly, Figure 3 A is a perspective view of a<br>
lance 15 before lancing tip 22 penetrates skin surface 30. Figure 3B is a side view of the<br>
lancing element illustrated in Figure 3 A. More particularly Figure 3B is side view of lancing<br>
element 15 before lancing tip 22 penetrates skin surface 30. In Figures 3A and 3B, milking<br>
ring 31 is placed against skin surface 30, causing skin surface 30 to bulge into milking<br>
opening 32. Opening 32 may further be the opening at the distal end of a lancing device, such<br>
as, for example, an in-situ meter wherein the lancing element 15 extends through opening 32<br>
to puncture skin. Milking ring 32 maybe, for example, a substrate with a hole drilled through<br>
it which could be, for example, a plastic such as polystyrene, polyethylene, polycarbonate,<br>
polyester, or the like. The diameter of opening 32 of said milking ring may be, for example,<br>
in the range of between 3.5 and 12 mm. In operation, the milking ring 31 may be applied<br>
with gentle pressure onto a fingertip, forearm, or other suitable site such that the skin surface<br>
30 forms a raised mound within milking ring 31. In a one embodiment of a method according<br>
to the present invention, milking ring 31 is applied to skin surface 31 with a pressure of<br>
approximately 0.5 to 1.5 pounds of applied pressure. In one embodiment of a method<br>
according to the present invention, the use of a milking ring is intended to facilitate the<br>
collection of bodily fluids by applying a pressure around the incision site to provide a driving<br>
force for expressing fluid from the wound site.<br>
Figure 3C is a perspective view of a lancing element as the tip of the lancing element<br>
begins to penetrate the surface of the skin. As lancing tip 22 enters skin surface 30, deflecting<br>
skin surface 30 away from lancing tip 22 until skin surface 30 is punctured, forming an<br>
incision 37 in skin surface 30, enabling lancing element 15 to enter subcutaneous region 33.<br>
Figure 3D is a side view of the lancing element as the tip of the lancing element begins to<br>
penetrate the surface of the skin. More particularly, Figure 3D is a side view of lancing<br>
element 15 as lancing tip 22 enters incision 37 in skin surface 30.<br>
Figure 3E is a perspective view of the lancing element as it reaches its full depth of<br>
penetration beneath the surface of the skin. In one embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
penetration depth may be reached by extending the lancing tip 22 to a first extension length<br>
beyond opening 32. More particularly, Figure 3E is a perspective view of lancing element 15<br>
after lancing tip 22 has reached its full depth of penetration into subcutaneous region 33.<br>
Figure 3F is a side view of the lancing element 15 as it reaches its full depth of penetration<br>
beneath the surface of the skin. More particularly, Figure 3F is a side view of lancing<br>
element 15 after lancing tip 22 has reached its full depth of penetration into subcutaneous<br>
region 33. At full penetration, lancing tip 22 reaches a depth of Dl. The actual value of Dl<br>
for a particular application will depend upon a number of factors, including the bodily fluid<br>
being extracted. For example, if the bodily fluid being extracted is blood, the depth Dl will<br>
be greater than if the bodily fluid being extracted is interstitial fluid (i.e. ISF). In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, penetration depth Dl may be, for example, in the range<br>
of 0.25 to 1.5 mm deep. In a farther embodiment of the present invention, Dl may represent<br>
the first extension length measured from lancing tip 22 to opening 32.<br>
In a method according to the present invention, insertion of lancing element 15<br>
through skin surface 30 creates an incision 37 in addition to severing subcutaneous tissue and<br>
capillaries and providing fill channel 21 with access to the bodily fluid to be sampled,<br>
whether blood or interstitial fluid. Thus, with lancing element 15 positioned as shown in<br>
Figures 3E and 3F, bodily fluid will flow through fill channel 21 and into sensor strip 100.<br>
However, leaving lancing element 15 positioned as illustrated in Figures 3E and 3F will not<br>
provide an optimal flow of bodily fluid through fill channel 21. The reasons for the limited<br>
flow may include, for example, the blocking of lanced capillaries by the location oflancing<br>
element 15 which may, for example, prevent the capillaries or interstitial fluid from flowing<br>
freely and pooling in the wound created by lancing element 15.<br>
Fig 3G is a perspective view of the lancing element after it is fully withdrawn from<br>
the skin. More particularly, Figure 3G is a perspective view of lancing element 15 after<br>
lancing tip 22 has been withdrawn completely from incision 37. Fig 3H is a side view of the<br>
lancing element 15 after it is folly withdrawn from skin surface 30. In a further embodiment<br>
of the present invention, lancing tip 22 is withdrawn fully past opening 32. In a method<br>
according to the present invention, fully withdrawing lancing element 15 from incision 37<br>
creates an open wound 38 below incision 37 that facilitates expression of bodily fluid into<br>
wound 38. By fully removing lancing element 15 from the wound in accordance with the<br>
method of the present invention, bodily fluids flow more readily into wound 38. If lancing<br>
element 15 is not completely removed from wound 38, blood and/or interstitial fluid flow<br>
may be impeded. One possible explanation for the limited blood flow is the possibility that<br>
the partially retracted lancing element 15 may still effectively block severed capillaries<br>
because of the resiliency of the skin. After the initial skin stretching during the penetration<br>
event, the skin might revert back to its initial position around lancing element 15. Thus, in<br>
the method according to the present invention it is important that lancing element 15 be fully<br>
removed from wound 38 after the initial penetration to allow bodily fluid to pool in wound<br>
38.<br>
Figure 31 is a perspective view of the lancing element as it re-enters the surface of the<br>
skin through the incision created during the first entry. More particularly, Figure 31 is a<br>
perspective view of lancing element 15 after lancing tip 22 has been re-inserted through<br>
incision 37 into wound 38. Figure 3J is a side view of the lancing element as it re-enters the<br>
surface of the skin through the incision created during the first entry. More particularly,<br>
Figure 3J is a side view of lancing element 15 positioned within wound 38 such that channel<br>
tip 24 is below skin surface 30. In a method according to the present invention, illustrated in<br>
Figure 3J, lancing tip 22 is reinserted to a depth D2 which is less than D1. In a further<br>
embodiment of the present invention, D2 may represent a second extension length, wherein<br>
lancing tip 22 is extended past opening 32 to second extension length D2, in this embodiment<br>
of the invention, wherein second extension length D2 is less than first extension length Dl.<br>
Partially reinserting in accordance with a method according to the present invention facilitates<br>
the flow of bodily fluids into fluid channel 21. In one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the distance D2 to which lancing tip 22 penetrates is generally defined by the distance from<br>
lancing tip 22 to channel tip 22. In one embodiment of the invention, lancing tip 22 may be<br>
reinserted to a depth D2 of approximately 0.05 to 0.25 mm deep, wherein D2 is defined as the<br>
distance from a surface of the skin 34 to the lancing tip 22.<br>
Figure 3K is a perspective view showing the lancing element being used to draw<br>
blood from a forearm. More particularly, Figure 3K is a perspective view of a lancing device<br>
15 being used in a method according to the present invention to draw bodily fluids from a<br>
forearm 40 of a human being.<br>
In a method of lancing skin in accordance with the present invention, as set forth<br>
above, the method may further include using milking ring 31 to exert the pressure in the<br>
region surrounding incision 37 exerted by milking ring 31. Milking ring 31 is positioned on<br>
the skin prior to the step of forcing the lancing tip 22 into the skin and may be maintained<br>
throughout the remainder of the procedure. In this embodiment of the invention, the milking<br>
ring 31 provides a pressure sufficient to facilitate the flow of bodily fluids into fill channel 21<br>
after the reinsertion of lancing tip 22 into wound 38. In one embodiment of the invention,<br>
milking ring 31 provides a pressure in a range of approximately 0.5 to 1.5 pounds. In a<br>
further embodiment of the present invention, the method may include positioning the milking<br>
ring 31 against the skin for a predetermined period of time prior to launching the lancing<br>
element. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the predetermined period of time<br>
may be three seconds or more.<br>
It will be recognized that equivalent structures may be substituted for the structures<br>
illustrated and described herein and that the described embodiment of the invention is not the<br>
only structure which may be employed to implement the claimed invention. As one example<br>
of an equivalent structure which may be used to implement the present invention, a lancing<br>
element may be used which does not include a channel tip, with the channel extending from<br>
the distal end of the lancing element to the working electrode. While preferred embodiments<br>
of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those<br>
skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous<br>
variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to hose skilled in the art without<br>
departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the<br>
embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention.<br>
