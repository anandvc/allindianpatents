				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel indoloquinoxaline derivatives, to methods for preparing them as well as to their pharmaceutical use. In particular, the invention relates to novel indoloquinoxaline derivatives and their use in the treatment of viral infections.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As is well-known, viruses are the etiologic cause of many, sometimes life-threatening, diseases of both humans and animals. For example, herpes viruses such as herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex 2 (HSV-2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella zoster virus (VZV) and human herpes virus 6 (HHV 6) are associated with many common viral illnesses.<br>
Human CMV (HCMV) infection is a life-long affliction which can result in morbidity and mortality. The pathologies associated with HMCV include microcephaly, heptosplenomegaly, jaundice, encephalitis, infections of the newborn infants or fetuses in utero, and infections of immunocompromised hosts.<br>
For several reasons, increasing numbers of persons are at risk for HCMV infection, and presently an estimated 80% of adults in the United States are infected with HCMV. A particularly susceptible group is those of weakened immune system, such as ADDS patients, where HCMV infection may cause retinitis, gastritis and pneumonitis. Also, HCMV-induced pneumonias or hepatitis are frequent and serious complications of bone marrow transplants.<br>
European patent EP 0 238 459 relates to substituted indoloquinoxalines having the general formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 represents hydrogen or one or several, preferably 1 to 4, similar or different sub-stituents in the positions 1-4 and/or 7-10, selected from halogen, preferably Br, lower al-kyl/alkoxy group having not more than 4 carbon atoms, trifhioromethyl group, trichloro-methyl group; X is a group -(CH2)n-R2, wherein R2 represents a nitrogen containing basic residue such as NH2, NHR4 or NR5R6, wherein R4, R5 and R6 independently are lower alkyl or cycloalkyl and n is an integer of from 1 to 4 and R3 represents hydrogen, lower al-kyl/cycloalkyl group having not more than 4 carbon atoms, and the physiologically acceptable addition products of the compounds with acids and halogen adducts, preferably adducts with iodine, iodine monochloride or iodine monobromide.<br>

Biological test<br>
Tests of antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus as described herein below were performed on a compound according to the invention, viz. the compound la of EXAMPLE 1. The reference compound termed B-220 is 2,3-dimemyl-6-(N,N-dimemylarninoethyl)-6H-indolo(2,3-b)quinoxaline, disclosed in European patent EP 0 238 459.<br>
Test of inhibitory effects on viral infection<br>
In order to assess whether targeting structural viral proteins would be as efficient as targeting viral transcription a modified plaque assay was set up, wherein one of the new antiviral agents<br>
was compared with already acknowledged antiviral agents that inhibit either HCMV's transcription [GCV (Cymevene, Roche) and PFA (Foscavir, AstraZeneca)] or infection [IVIg (IVIG CP, Biotest Pharma), an antibody].<br>
In a 0 dpi (days post infection) experiment the antiviral agents and TB40/E were added simultaneously, thereby indicating how well the agents inhibit infection. The results from this experiment were obtained by comparing the amount of infected cells of the treated wells to that of the positive controls, thus calculating the inhibition of infection achieved by the agents in question. The experiment was repeated with the HCMV strain AD-169 and with a clinical isolate, respectively, with essentially the same results.<br>
The inhibitory effect of the tested substances is shown in Table 1, as the % of inhibition of infection. These data are the results from plaque assays using strain AD 169 and TB 40 of HCMV infected human lung fibroblasts.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results of the test indicate that the inventive compounds have excellent inhibitory effect on viral infection.<br>
Test of inhibition of HCMV Assembly and Egress<br>
Infected human lung fibroblast cells (HL cells) were treated with the antiviral agent B-220 and with other reference substances, as shown in Table 2, and with inventive compound la in order to assess the effect of the inventive compounds on HCMV infection, assembly and egress.<br>
The antiviral agents were added at 3 or 5 days post infection (dpi) in these experiments and left in culture until 7dpi. Thereafter supernatant and crushed cells were transferred to new cell cultures over night and subsequently stained for IE expression. The results indicate how well the substances impede viral assembly and egress. More specifically, at 3dpi the majority of the viral capsids are being assembled in the nucleus whereas at 5dpi they are mainly receiving their tegumentation in the cytoplasm and some have commenced their secondary envelopment.<br>
In Table 2 the inhibitory effect of the antiviral substances using the modified plaque assay system is shown. Several substances showed 100% inhibition of IE expression as measured by IE staining and no capsid formation was observed in the nucleus of the majority of the treated cells as observed by electron microscopy examination. The inventive compound termed la showed extremely good results matching the results obtained by Ganciclovir.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Mechanism of action<br>
Without wishing to be bound to any theory of the mechanism of action of the inventive compounds, it is noted that the tested inventive compound la shows very clear inhibition of IE expression. Furthermore, electron microscopy data indicate impairment of virus assembly. Indeed, the image analysis technique used to identify and quantify stable intermediate particles of HCMV indicated impairment of tegument protein binding to the viral capsid. Together these data show a high potential for the use of the inventive compounds in antiviral therapy. Also, by using the inventive compounds in combination with at least one other antivirally active agent, such as in a multidrug therapy, a synergistic effect is expected and the risk of acquired drug resistance may be reduced or avoided.<br>
Toxicity<br>
The inventive compounds did not show any toxicity as assayed by propidium iodide staining of cell cultures of infected and uninfected human lung fibroblasts. A concentration of compound la 10 times the one used in the experiments showed no toxicity during the time frame 0-7dpi. The concentrations of compounds used in the viral experiments were at the µM level. Cellular toxicity for B-220 has been shown for concentrations above l00µM.<br>
Materials and Methods Cell Culture<br>
The human lung fibroblasts, HL-cells (MRC-5), used in these experiments were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a solution of MEM with Earle's and L-glutamine (from GIBCO) into which 10% Foetal Calf Serum (FCS) and 1% Penicillin and Streptomycin (PeSt) were added.<br>
When the experiment commenced the HL cells were being kept in a Falcon cell culture flask of 175cm . Trypsin and EDTA were used to loosen the cells from the cell culture flask when transferring them to 48-well multiwells (Becton Dickinson) for infection and incubation with the antiviral agents.<br>
The cells were incubated until 50% confluence was reached under the same conditions as above and were used up to the 26th passage.<br>
Infection of Cells with HCMV<br>
The HL cells were infected with HCMV, viral strain TB 40/E [an endothelial adapted clinical isolate (UR1814) kindly provided by Prof. G. Jahn] and viral strain AD-169, respectively, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0,02 and incubated until 3 or 5 days post infection (dpi) at 37°C and 5% CO2 ha the same mediums as above. Some cells (for the 0dpi experiment) were simultaneously exposed to the antiviral agents (see below). The negative controls were left uninfected.<br>
Exposing the cells to inhibitors and antiviral agents<br>
The existing medium (in the 3 and 5dpi experiments) was changed and new medium added, with inhibitors and antiviral agents at different concentrations. However this was done simultaneously to the infection in the 0dpi experiment and left to incubate until ldpi. The medium containing IVIg was incubated for an hour with the virus on ice prior to being added to the cells.<br>
Modified Plaque Assay<br>
In the 3- and 5dpi-experiments the supernatant of the MRC-5 cells was transferred to uninfected cells to asses the amount of excreted virus. The remaining cells were given new medium and crushed with glass marbles by shaking the multiwells on an IKA-Vibrax-VXR at 300 shakes pm for l0min. Thereafter the cellular debris was transferred to uninfected cells to be able to evaluate the amount of infectious intracellular viral particles.<br>
After letting the viral particles infect the new cells for approximately one hour me medium was changed, thus washing away the cellular debris.<br>
In the Odpi-experiments the cells were fixed immediately ldpi (in accordance with the procedure explained below).<br>
Positive controls (untreated infected cells) and negative controls (untreated uninfected cells), were treated, respectively, as above.<br>
Immunofluorescent Staining of the Cells<br>
The new HL cells (in the 3 and 5dpi experiments) were fixed the following day with 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at room temperature (RT). To make the cells permeable, 0.3% TritonX in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) was used for 15 min incubation at RT followed by blocking of the background with background block from DAKO for 20 min at RT, with an amount just large enough to cover the entire surface. Thereafter all multiwells were incubated with primary antibodies (mouse), diluted to 1:100, against immediate early antigen (IEA, Antigene) for 45 min at 8 °C. Subsequently the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies, rabbit anti mouse FITC (Dako Cytomation), diluted to 1:100, for 45 min at 8 °C<br>
and simultaneously stained with DAPI (Sigma), diluted to 1:250 DAPI is a chemical substance that stains the nucleus of the cells.<br>
The positive and negative controls, of both cell types, were treated, respectively, as above.<br>
Immunofluroscence Microscopy Analysis<br>
The cells were analyzed by fluorescent microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-U. The amount of cells expressing IEA, in two different parts of the well, was counted by the naked eye and compared to the total amount of cells (indicated with DAPI), in those same parts. These values were used to appreciate the percentage of infected cells in each well from which the amount of inhibition achieved by the different substances was calculated. This method of calculating the percentage of infected cells in two parts of a well and then applying it to the entire well was chosen since the total amount of cells in a well would be impossible to count manually.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
