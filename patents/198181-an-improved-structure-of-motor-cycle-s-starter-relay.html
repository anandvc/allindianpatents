COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
AN IMPROVED STRUCTURE OF FOR MOTOR CYCLES STARTER RELAY<br>
LI-IN ELECTRICAL CO. LTD. of NO. 24, KUO CHENG 7 STR., PATE CITY, TAOYUAN, TAIWAN, R.O.C., TAIWANESE Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is related to an improved structure of motorcycle's starter relay that has a simple structure with proved low cost and also can be assembled easily.<br>
The conventional motorcycle's starter relay has shortcomings like too many (assembled) parts; besides, the assembling needs screws for fixation which causes a lot of labour and limit the production capacity. The moving part for pushing and pulling electromagnetic coil is directly combined with and fixed on connecting conductive plate through the use of an additonal special structure on the top of the moving part. When electromagnetic coil is pulling the moving part, it has to stand the resistance from not only the bottom spring but also the spring for the connecting conductive plate. Hence the electromagnetic has high manufacturing cost when high magnetic force is required. Under this situation, the production capacity is limited and the business acquires little profit. As a result, it has become a very important subject to overcome the shortcomings.<br>
In view of the circumstances, the inventor has developed an improved structure for motorcycle's starter relay based on his many-year experience in the product design and manufacturing.<br>
The primary objective of the invention is to provide a motorcycle's starter relay that the top pushing device can be detached from the connecting conductive plate through the designed structure when it is pulling downward by the electromagnetic coil and as a result, the electromagnetic only needs to stand the resistance from the spring under the top pushing device and the manufacturing cost for the electromagnetic is reduced.<br>
The secondary objective of the invention is to provide a motorcycle's starter relay that through the detached structure the assembling process is simplified and the production capacity is increased.<br><br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a motorcycle's starter relay that through the connecting structure of the parts the assembling process is automated and labour is reduced. As a result, the production capacity is increased and the production cost is decreased.<br>
For further explaining the detailed structure and features for the invention, the illustrating figures are listed and explained as follows:<br>
Figure 1: 3-Dimension Decomposed Structural Illustration for the Motorcycle's Starter Relay In the invention.<br>
Figure 2: Bottom Structure of the Cylindrical Case before Electromagnetic Coil illustrated in Figure 1 is placed inside.<br>
Figure 3: 3-Dimension Assembled Structural Illustration for the Motorcycle's Starter Relay in The Invention.<br>
Figure 4: A: Structural Illustration for the Motorcycle's Starter Relay in the Invention Before Activation.<br>
Figure 4: B: Structural Illustration for the Motorcycle's Starter Relay in the Invention After activation.<br>
With reference to the illustrating figures, the structures of motorcycle's starter relay disclosed in the invention is mainly composed of an electromagnetic activation section JO and a relaly device 30^ The electromagnetic activation section 10 has a cylindrical case that contains a round plate 12. On the top of the round plate 12 there is an electromagnetic coil 13 that has a central channel 14 with bulging ring 15 on the inner wall near bottom. At the proper position by the top of central channel 14 there is an upward wire fixation station 17 for the two wire terminals 16 provided to the electromagnetic coil 13. On the top of the electromagnetic coil 13 there is a dividing ring 19 for the bending up edge 18. The dividing<br><br>
ring 19 has a penetrating hole 20 corresponding to the central channel 14 in the electromagnetic coil 13. At a proper position by the penetrating hole 20 there is a hole 21 corresponding to the wire fixation station 17 in the magnetic coil 13. In the central channel 14 of the electromagnetic coil 13 there is a top supporting spring 22 that the spring bottom crosses on the bulging ring 15 and extends upward and through the penetrating hole 20 of the dividing ring 19. On the top of the top supporting spring 22 there is a pushing device 23 has a magnetic pulling section 24 properly extending downward along the inner section of the top supporting spring 22. On the top of the magnetic pulling section 24 there is a crossing section 25 for crossing on the top of the top supporting spring 22. The crossing section 25 has locating bulging edge 26 outside the top edge and a convace groove 27 at center of the top suitable for fixing a top insulating block 28 that properly extends upward.<br>
Besides, with reference to Figure 2-A and Figure 2-B, the cylindrical case 11 has two reinforcing bulging arcs 111 and 112 that have dividing sections 113 and 114 with different spacing between two terminals. At the bottom of the electromagnetic coil 13 there are two locking bulging blocks 131 and 132 corresponding to the two dividing sections 113 and 114. Therefore the electromagnetic coil 13 is set inside the cylindrical case 11 and the locking bulging blocks 131 and 132 are locked into the corresponding sections 113 and 114. As a result, the correct orientation can be controlled and the dislocation of the electromagnetic coil 13 can be avoided. The round concave 115 formed by the two reinforcing bulging arcs 111 and 112 functions as a place for setting the round plate 12.<br>
The relay device contains an electromagnetic activation section 10 and a cylindrical case 11 with a sealing cover 31 that has a shrinking ladder structure 32 formed at the edge of the bottom. When the sealing cover 31 is placed into the cylindrical case 11, the O ring 33 is fixed outside the ladder structure 32 for the sealing cover 31 and the bending edge 18 of the dividing ring 19. At a proper position of the sealing cover 31 there are wire outlets 34 for the two wire terminals 16 of the electromagnetic coil 13. At another proper position of the sealing cover 31 there are two penetrating holes 35 that are connected by a lateral fixation groove 36. The two conductive helical rods 38 with two extended Conductive plates 37 can<br><br>
pass through the two penetrating holes 35 upward. When the two conductive plates are locked in the lateral fixation groove 36, the two conductive helical rods 38 are just fixed to the two penetrating holes 35. The extended conductive plates 37 for the two conductive helical rods 38 have corresponding concave grooves 371. At the bottom of the two conductive helical rods 38, the sealing cover 31 has a concave groove 40 with suitable shape for holding connecting conductive plates 39. At the center of the connecting conductive plates 39 there is a supporting section 391 of the corresponding concave groove 371 for the two extended conductive plates 37. On the opposite side of the supporting section 391 there is a fixation groove for spring 392. At the center of the concave groove for conductive plate 40 there is a spring supporting rod 41 corresponding to fixation groove for spring 392. When the small top supporting spring 42 is set into the spring supporting rod 41 and the fixation groove for spring 392, the supporting section 391 for the connecting conductive plates 39 extends constantly downward. Therefore the connecting conductive plates 39 contact with the extended conductive plates 37 of the conductive helical rods 38. Because the elastic force of the small top supporting spring 42 is smaller than that of the top supporting spring 22 of the electromagnetic activation section 10, when the electromagnetic activation section 10 combines with the relay device 30, the supporting section 391 of the connecting conductive plate 39 will move upward due to the pushing force by the top insulating block 28 of the top pushing device 23. As a result, the connecting conductive plates are detached from the extended conductive plates 37 of the two conductive helical rods 38, as shown in Figure 4-A.<br><br>

When activating the electromagnetic coil 13 by the switch set at the two wire terminals 16, the magnetic pulling section 24 of the pushing device 23 will be pulled downward and the locating bulging edge 26 moves downward to the top edge of the central channel 14 for the electromagnetic coil 13. In the meantime, the top insulating block 28 of the top pushing device 23 is detached from the supporting section 391 of the connecting conductive plates 39, as shown in Figure 4-B. When the connecting conductive plates 39 move downward to<br><br>
contact with the two extended conductive plates 37 of the conductive helical rods 38, the circuit formed by the two conductive helical rods 38 is connected and the motor is activated.<br>
In the invention both the combination of the conductive helical rods 38 and the sealing cover 31 and the combination of top insulating block 28 and the concave groove 27 of the pushing device 23 are achieved by using mounting technology. Hence automation can be applied to the assembling process.<br>
To sum up, the motorcycle's starter relay has simple structure and can be asembled easily. Besides, through the structure that the pushing device is detached from the connecting conductive plates, the magnetic force provided by the magnetic coil is effectively reduced, which will also reduce the manufacturing cost. The invention has practical value in application, so it complies with the patent requirement that it is of new type patent, first time invention and practical value in application. The inventor is grateful to the patent reviewing committee for their effort in examining the invention and hopes to obtain the patent right as soon as possible.<br>
Accordingly there is provided an improved structure of motor cycle's starter relay comprising an electro magnetic activation section and a relay device; said electro magnetic activation section consisting of an electro magnetic coil (13) housed in a cylindrical case (11) with supporting spring (22) and extended through the penetrating hole (22) of the dividing ring (19); two extended conductive helical rod (38) with two extended conductive plate (37). pass through two penetrating hole (35); the conductive plates and support section (371) and (392) once get connected by the pushing device (23) which works against the spring supporting rod (41) hereby connecting the conductive plates downward to contact with the two extended conductive plates of the conductive helical rod, the circuit formed by the two conductive helical rod is connected and the motor is activated; the said conductive plate will move upward due to the pushing force by the insulating block of the pushing device and as a result the connecting conductive plates are detached from the extended conductive plates of the two conductive helical rods.<br><br>
