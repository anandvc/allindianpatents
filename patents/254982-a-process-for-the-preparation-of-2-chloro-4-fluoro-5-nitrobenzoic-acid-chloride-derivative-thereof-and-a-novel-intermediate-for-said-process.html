FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The subject-matter of the present invention is the preparation of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-<br>
nitrobenzoic acid and derivatives thereof, including the acyl chloride thereof and a<br>
novel synthetic intermediate. In particular, the subject-matter of the invention is a<br>
process for the preparation of the above-mentioned derivatives by nitration of 2-<br>
chloro-4-fluorobenzotrichloride and the transformation of the novel synthetic<br>
intermediate thus obtained into the acid and derivatives thereof, including the<br>
corresponding acyl chloride, or by a process comprising the nitration and<br>
simultaneous hydrolysis of said 2-chloro-4-fluorobenzotrichloride. A subject of the<br>
invention is likewise the transformation of the benzotrichloride synthetic<br>
intermediates into the corresponding benzotrifluoride derivatives.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND<br>
2-chloro-4-fiuoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid is a known product.<br>
Its preparation is described in the literature , solely by nitration of 2-chloro-4-<br>
fluorobenzoic acid, just as reported, for example, in WO87/07602, EP0863142 and<br>
WO01/83459.<br>
The reaction described has considerable drawbacks, including the fact that the<br>
starting product, 2-chloro-4-fluorobenzoic acid is a solid, and hence not so easily<br>
handled compared to a liquid compound at room temperature. Furthermore, its<br>
nitration requires significant volumes of sulfuric acid and, by no means least,<br>
nitration of 2-chloro-4-fluorobenzoic acid leads to the production of considerable<br>
amounts of impurities, such as unwanted by-products.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide an alternative synthetic process for 2-<br>
chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid and derivatives thereof including the acyl<br>
chloride, by a novel and original preparation process, with respect to the nitration<br>
process described in the aforementioned references, furthermore obviating the<br>
drawbacks of said nitration.<br><br>
Indeed, it has now been found that it is possible to prepare 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-<br>
nitrobenzoic acid by nitration, not of the corresponding non-nitrated acid, but of 2-<br>
chloro-4-flnorobenzotrichloride, the reaction proceeding via 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-<br>
nitrobenzotrichloride, a novel and versatile reaction intermediate which is easily<br>
converted into the desired acid or the acyl chloride thereof or into other possible<br>
compounds.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hence, according to one aspect thereof, the object of the present invention relates to<br>
a process for the preparation of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid and derivatives<br>
thereof, of formula (I):	<br><br>
wherein<br>
-	R is a -COOH, -COOR', -CO-Hal, -CONR"R"', -COSR"' or-CN group,<br>
-	Hal represents a halogen atom,<br>
-	R' represents a linear or branched alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group; an<br>
optionally substituted aryl group;<br>
R' and R'' represent, independently, a hydrogen atom; a linear or branched<br>
alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group; an optionally substituted aryl or arylalkyl<br>
group;<br>
comprising:<br>
 a) reacting 2-chloro-4-fluorobenzotrichloride of formula (II):<br><br><br>
with a sulfonitric mixture to give the intermediate compound 2-chloro-4-<br>
fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride of formula (III):<br><br>
b)	hydrolysing the intermediate to give the acid of formula (I) wherein R is -<br>
COOH; and optionally<br>
c)	converting the acid thus obtained into a derivative thereof.<br>
According to the present invention, by halogen is meant a substituent selected from<br>
chlorine, bromine, fluorine and iodine, with chlorine being a particularly preferred<br>
substituent.<br>
In particular, the preparation of the compound of formula (I) wherein R is -COCl (R<br>
= -CO-Hal with Hal = Chlorine) may proceed according to any of the following<br>
steps, including:<br>
c') treating the acid of formula (I) wherein R is -COOH with classic<br>
chlorinating agents; or alternatively<br>
c") reacting 2-chloro-4-fiuoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride of formula (III) with<br>
2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid (formula (I) wherein R is OH) in<br>
approx. 1/1 molar ratios; or alternatively still<br>
c'") reacting the 2-chioro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride of formula (III)<br>
with water in the presence of a suitable catalyst or in a weakly acidic<br>
medium,<br>
said stages (c'), (c") and (c'") providing the compound of formula (I) wherein R is -<br>
COCl.<br>
Examples of linear or branched allcyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups include lower<br>
allcyls such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, iso-pentyl,<br>
etc., optionally, whenever possible, mono- or poly-unsaturated,<br>
Examples of optionally substituted aryl and arylalkyl groups include phenyl,<br>
naphthyl, diphenyl, benzyl, etc., optionally mono or poly-substituted with linear or<br><br>
branched allcyl, alkenyl or allcynyl groups, with halogens or with functional groups<br>
such as carboxyls (optionally esterified), primary, secondary or tertiary amines etc..<br>
The starting product, 2-chloro-4-fluorobenzotrichloride of formula (II), is a liquid,<br>
easily measurable product, the preparation of which is described in the literature for<br>
example in US 4,711,905 (column 17) in which it is synthesised via the<br>
photoclilorination of the corresponding toluenic derivative.<br>
According to the present invention, by "sulfonitric mixture" is meant a mixture<br>
composed of concentrated nitric acid and either concentrated sulfuric acid or oleum,<br>
wherein the nitric acid content in said sulfonitric mixture is approx. 30% by weight<br>
with respect to the total mixture weight.<br>
According to one advantageous aspect of the invention, the nitric acid content in the<br>
sulfonitric mixture is less than 30% by weight, for example comprised of between 15<br>
and 30%. Indeed, it has been observed that said sulfonitric mixture is particularly<br>
advantageous when used on an industrial scale.<br>
According to one advantageous aspect, the nitration step (a) is performed with a<br>
nitric acid/compound of formula (I) ratio greater than 1/1, even better if greater than<br>
2/1 (mol/mol), for example with a ratio of 2.2/1 or even 3/1 or higher.<br>
The temperature of the nitration reaction (a) is at least slightly lower than room<br>
temperature, advantageously comprised of between 0 and 20°C, for example<br>
comprised of between 10 and 20°C or between 0°C and 10°C. Temperatures less<br>
than 0°C may likewise be used but involve longer reaction times, while temperatures<br>
above room temperature do not always give the selective nitration of the desired<br>
position in the benzene ring.<br>
In particular, it has been observed that using a temperature comprised of between 0-<br>
10°C, for example around 0-5°C, is particularly advantageous, above all when<br>
operating in the presence of a sulfonitric mixture with a nitric acid content of less<br>
than 30% by weight, allowing greater handleability of the reaction mixture with<br>
reduced production of by products.<br>
Hydrolysis (b) of the compound of formula (III) to give the acid form, is generally<br>
performed in an acid medium, for example in the presence of hydrochloric,<br>
hydrobromic, acetic and/or sulfuric acid, at a temperature comprised of between<br><br>
room temperature and the reaction mixture reflux temperature, for example at a<br>
temperature greater than. 50°C, advantageously comprised of between 80 and 120°C.<br>
With certain types of hydrolysis, it may be possible to add a suitable catalyst, such as<br>
for example FeCl3. The technical details of the hydrolysis step (b) are provided in the<br>
experimental section of this description.<br>
If desired, or indeed necessary, the acid of formula (I) (wherein R = -COOH) may be<br>
purified according to known techniques, for example by washing with water,<br>
advantageously in a water/alcohol mixture.<br>
For the good outcome of the process of the invention according to the<br>
aforementioned steps (a), (b), (c'), (c") or (c'"), it is essential that the sulfonitric<br>
mixture be used in pre-mixed form, instead of the starting product being dissolved<br>
firstly in sulfuric acid with nitric acid then being added later.<br>
Indeed, it has been observed that when the starting product of formula (II) comes into<br>
contact firstly with sulfuric acid or oleum and then with nitric acid, then besides the<br>
desired nitration, the hydrolysis of the trichloride group to the acid form is also<br>
obtained without the formation of the 2-chloro-4-fiuoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride<br>
intermediate of formula (HI), which as already mentioned, is a novel, potentially<br>
versatile compound with wide range of potential uses in the synthesis of organic<br>
compounds, that may be useful for example in the preparation of derivatives of said<br>
acid and particularly the compound of formula (I) wherein R is as defined previously<br>
but other than-COOH.<br>
The process for the preparation of the compound of formula (I) wherein R is -COOH<br>
by the nitration and simultaneous hydrolysis of 2-chloro-4-fluorobenzotrichloride of<br>
formula (II) comprising of the addition of said compound of formula (II) in sulfuric<br>
acid or oleum, with the subsequent addition of an appropriate quantity of nitric acid<br>
to the mixture, represents however a further aspect of the present invention. The<br>
details of this synthetic process are provided in the experimental section of the<br>
present description.<br>
In general, for carrying out the process of stage (a) of the invention, the starting<br>
product of formula (II) may be added slowly (over several hours, for example around<br>
2-3 hours) into the pre-chilled sulfonitric mixture and kept at a temperature<br><br>
comprised of between 0 and 10°C, the reaction mixture may then be left at said<br>
temperature for several hours until the nitration reaction is complete. Those skilled<br>
in the art are naturally able to check the progress of the reaction by means of<br>
conventional chromatographic techniques.<br>
Once the reaction is complete (i.e. when the starting product can no longer be<br>
detected) the reaction mixture may be treated according to known techniques for the<br>
isolation of the intermediate product of formula (III). For example, the desired<br>
product may be precipitated by treatment with ice water, and then isolated by<br>
filtration or be extracted from the suspension formed by using an appropriate solvent<br>
immiscible in water, for example a chlorinated solvent. Afterwards, using<br>
conventional isolation techniques, the compound of formula (HI) may be obtained<br>
with good yield and high purity. Said compound may be used directly for<br>
subsequent transformations without any further purification.<br>
2-Chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride of formula (III) is a novel compound and<br>
represents a further aspect of the present invention.<br>
The acid obtained from step (b) may be transformed into a derivative thereof (R is as<br>
defined above but ≠ -COOH) according to techniques well known to those skilled in<br>
the art and/or described in the literature.<br>
The transformation of the acid of formula (I) wherein R is -COOH into the acyl<br>
chloride thereof of formula (I) wherein R is -COCl (R = -CO-Hal with Hal =<br>
Chlorine) may be particularly useful. Said reaction may be carried out either by<br>
chlorination of the corresponding acid according to conventional techniques, for<br>
example through the action of chlorinating agents such as thionyl chloride, under<br>
reaction conditions well known to those skilled in the art or, according to a further<br>
aspect of the present invention, by reacting 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride<br>
of formula (III) with 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid.<br>
Thus, according to a further aspect thereof, the present invention also relates to a<br>
process for the preparation of the compound of formula (I) wherein R is -COCl<br>
comprising reacting the 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride of formula (III)<br>
and 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid (formula (I) wherein R is -COOH) in a<br>
molar ratio of 1/1, preferably in the presence of a Lewis acid, such as for example<br><br>
FeCl3 or ZnCl2, at a temperature comprised of between room temperature and 150-<br>
160°C, for example around 50°C or more advantageously around 80°C. The reaction<br>
is exothermic and produces hydrochloric acid. The technical details of said<br>
preparation are reported in the following experimental section.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to react the 2-chloro-4-fiuoro-5-nitrobenzotricloride of<br>
formula (III) with water in the presence of a catalyst such as FeCl3 or FeSO4, or even<br>
in a weakly acidic medium, for example in the presence of dilute sulfuric acid, to<br>
obtain the of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid chloride; in this case, it is<br>
advantageous to operate at temperatures ranging between approx. 120 and 160°C and<br>
the measured quantity of water must be added slowly and constantly in order to<br>
avoid inactivation of the catalyst and hydrolysis of the compound into its acid form.<br>
As already mentioned, the novel compound of formula (III) is a particularly versatile<br>
chemical intermediate and may be used, for example, as a starting product for the<br>
preparation of 2-chIoro-4-fiuoro-5-nitrobenzotrifluoride, for example by halogen<br>
exchange reaction with hydrofluoric acid (HF).<br>
2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrifluoride is itself a novel product and constitutes a<br>
further subject-matter of the present invention.<br>
This product may likewise be obtained by nitration of 2-chloro-4-<br>
fluorobenzotrifluoride, which may in turn be obtained from the 2-chloro-4-<br>
fluorobenzotricloride of formula (II) by means of the halogen exchange reaction with<br>
HF.<br>
Thus, according to another aspect thereof, a subject-matter of the invention is a<br>
process for the preparation of a compound of formula (IV)<br><br>
wherein R° is a hydrogen atom or a -NO2 group,<br>
comprising reacting a compound of formula (V):<br><br><br>
wherein R° is as defined above, with hydrofluoric acid (HF), optionally isolating the<br>
product and/or optionally subjecting the product of formula (IV), wherein R° is H, to<br>
a nitration reaction under the conditions of step (a) described above.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the above described fluorination<br>
reaction is carried out using an excess of HF and heating in an autoclave, for<br>
example up to 90°C for the amount of time necessary for conversion, which may be<br>
assessed for example by monitoring the production of gaseous hydrochloric acid.<br>
The fluorinated product of formula (IV) may then be isolated according to known<br>
techniques, for example by neutralising the reaction mixture using bases such as a<br>
solution of sodium bicarbonate and then distilling the product, or by crystallising it<br>
from a suitable solvent.<br>
The various aspects of the invention will now be non-limitingly illustrated by means<br>
of the following examples.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride (formula (III) (according to<br>
step (a))<br>
Into a 500 ml 4-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with mechanical means of<br>
stirring, means of cooling, thermometer and dropping funnel, 150.2 g of 30% oleum,<br>
and 60.2 g of concentrated nitric acid (99%) are added while maintaining the<br>
temperature below 10°C. To the sulfonitric mixture thus obtained 115.6 g of 2-<br>
chloro-4-fluorobenzotricliloride are added over approx. 2.5 hours while maintaining<br>
the temperature between 0 and 10°C. The reaction is left at said temperature for a<br>
further 2 hours to achieve completion, then poured into an ice/water mixture and the<br>
precipitation of a white solid is immediately observed. Approx. 300 g of<br>
dichloromethane is added to the mixture and the phases separated, the organic phase<br><br>
is washed with a solution of NaHCO3, then dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered<br>
and evaporated to dryness. 132 g of the title product (titre by GC = 93.7%, yield<br>
93%) are obtained as a white solid.<br>
M.P. = 65-68°C<br>
GC-MS identifies ion 256-262 [M-Cl]+<br>
1H NMR (spectra have been performed in CD3COCD3)<br>
doublet signal at 7.91 ppm 3JHF 9.91 Hz<br>
doublet signal at 8.93 ppm 4JHF 7.63 Hz<br>
(reference 2.03 ppm on the central line of the residual acetone signal)<br>
19F NMR<br>
Singlet signal at-113.68 ppm<br>
(trifluoroacetic acid reference, the signal of which is given at -77.00 ppm)<br><br>
Preparation of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride (formula (III) (according to<br>
step (a))<br>
Into a 500 ml 4-necked, cryostatically cooled round-bottomed flask equipped with<br>
mechanical means of stirring, a thermometer, dropping funnel and a acidic gas traps,<br>
602.8 g of sulfonitric mixture containing 22% nitric acid are loaded, and the<br>
temperature cryostatically cooled to 0°C. 251.8 g of 2-chloro-4-<br>
fiuorobenzotrichloride are added by means of the dropping funnel while maintaining<br>
the temperature between 0 and 2°C. The addition is completed over 4.5 hours, and<br>
the well-stirred, homogeneously appearing mixture has a pale yellow colour. The<br>
reaction mixture is left, still at 0-4°C, for a further 2 hours for the reaction to go to<br><br>
completion. The reaction is monitored by GC, following the disappearance of the<br>
reagent, and the acids are then diluted with 150.4 g of deionised water. The process<br>
is performed using external cooling in order to maintain the temperature below 10°C.<br>
20 minutes after the addition of the water to dilute the acids, still with cooling, the<br>
reaction mixture is filtered under reduced pressure to give 651.6 g of filtered acids<br>
and 328.5 g of a damp, pale yellow, coarse grained solid which is washed by stirring<br>
with deionised water for one hour. The desired product is filtered to give 304.1 g of<br>
a pale yellow coloured product upon drying.<br>
Nitration molar yield: 96.2%.<br>
Melting point (°C): 59-62<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Preparation of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-mtrobenzoic acid (according to step (b))<br>
Into a 250 ml reaction vessel 41.6 g of 96% H2SO4 are loaded and 8.4 g of water<br>
added dropwise (to adjust the acid concentration to 80%). The temperature of the<br>
acid is adjusted to approx. 70°C and the portionwise addition of 10 g of purified 2-<br>
chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride (titre by GC = 99.5%) commenced. The<br>
temperature is then set to 100-110°C, observing the progressive formation of a white<br>
solid product dispersed in the mixture. The temperature is kept for approx. 3 ore,<br>
then the reaction mixture cooled to approx. 50°C and diluted with 100 g of water,<br>
and the product then extracted with 40 g of ethyl acetate at room temperature. The<br>
phases are separated and the organic solution washed with 46 g of water. Finally, the<br>
solvent is evaporated to give 7 g of the title product, as a white solid.<br>
Titre by HPLC = 94.5%, molar yield 88%.<br>
Melting point (°C): 148-151.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Preparation of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoio acid (according to step (b))<br>
Into a 250 ml reaction vessel inside a 1 1 glass equipped with mechanical means of<br>
stirring, thermometer, bubble condenser, thermostatically controlled oil heater, acid<br>
vapour water traps, 750 g of 96% sulfuric acid are loaded and 75 g of deionised<br>
water added dropwise to dilute the acid to 85%. The operation is completed over 1.5<br>
hours, reaching a maximum temperature of 45°C. The acid is then heated to 80-90°C,<br><br>
and the portionwise addition of 302.6 g of crude 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-<br>
nitrobenzotrichloride commenced. The production of HCl may be observed<br>
immediately, both in the reaction mixture (seen by foaming), and in the water<br>
absorption traps. The reaction is moderately exothermic, however, the portionwise<br>
addition continues in safety, avoiding the accumulation of gas with vigorous stirring.<br>
The temperature is kept between 80-100°C for the entire duration of the reaction, and<br>
for 3/4 of the duration, the reaction has the appearance of a solution, then the acid<br>
product begins to form a suspension despite the high temperature. Addition of the<br>
organic component is completed in 3 hours 45 minutes, divided into 15 minute<br>
periods with the addition of 20-30 g each. The reaction mixture is kept stirring at<br>
100°C for a further 3 hours, until the reaction is complete. The gas absorbed in the<br>
traps (approx. 97.5 g) is an indication of the state of completion of the reaction. The<br>
reaction mixture is then cooled to 20°C, and then the product filtered to give 233 g of<br>
a creamy white, damp solid. It is then further purified by washing with water,<br>
filtration and drying to obtain 171.0 g of product.<br>
Hydrolysis molar yield: 82%.<br>
Melting point (°C): 148-152.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Preparation of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid (according to step (b))<br>
Into a 250 ml reaction vessel 50 g of 96% sulfuric acid are loaded then diluted to<br>
80% by the addition of 10 g of water. The mixture is then heated to approx. 70°C and<br>
then the portioirwise addition of 12 g of crude nitration product 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-<br>
nitrobenzotrichloride (titre by GC = 98%) commenced. The reaction mixture is<br>
heated to 100-110°C and kept at said temperature for approx. 3 hours to promote the<br>
formation of the hydrolysis product. While cooling, it is diluted with the addition of<br>
50 g of water and 50 g of ice, and the product extracted with 60 g of ethyl acetate.<br>
Following separation of the phases, the organic phase is washed with 60 g of water,<br>
and the ethyl acetate concentrated under reduced pressure. 10 g of heptane are then<br>
added and 8 g of title product isolated as a white solid.<br>
Titre by HPLC = 96.5%, molar yield 91%.<br>
Melting point (°C): 150-153.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Preparation of the chloride salt of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid (according<br>
to step (c"))<br>
Into a 100 ml reaction vessel 30 g of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride and<br>
0.85 g of FeC13 are loaded. The mixture is heated to approx. 50°C and 22.4 g of 2-<br>
chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid added. The temperature increases to 85°C with<br>
strong release of gaseous hydrochloric acid. The mixture becomes completely fluid<br>
and the reaction is left for approx. 1.5 hours to proceed to completion. The<br>
disappearance of the starting product and the corresponding appearance of the title<br>
compound are monitored by gas chromatography (GC).<br>
Final GC analysis: 94.7% the chloride salt of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid<br>
(via the methyl ester).<br>
Melting point (°C): 53-57.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Preparation of 2-chloro--4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid<br>
(by simultaneous nitration and hydrolysis of 2-chloro-4-fiuoro-5-<br>
nitrobenzotrichloride)<br>
Into a 3 litre round-bottomed flask equipped with mechanical means of stirring,<br>
means of cooling, thermometer and dropping funnel 2900 g of concentrated sulfuric<br>
acid are loaded which is then cooled to 0/5°C. 500 g of 2-chloro-4-<br>
fluorobenzotrichloride are then added of approx. 2 hours. The formation of a solid is<br>
observed, along with the liberation of gas (hydrochloric acid). 255 g of concentrated<br>
nitric acid (again at 0°C) are then added slowly and after 3 hours, the temperature of<br>
the mixture is allowed to return to 20°C and the reaction left stirring at this<br>
temperature for as further 17 hours. The reaction mixture is poured into ice water and<br>
the precipitate thus formed filtered then washed firstly with water, filtered once more<br>
and treated with a warm ethyl acetate and heptane mixture. Following cooling, the<br>
precipitate is filtered to give 340 g of title product in the form of a white solid.<br>
Titre by HPLC = 97.2%, molar yield 76%.<br>
Melting point (°C): 151-154.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br><br>
Illustrative preparation of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrifluoride<br>
2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-nitrobenzotrichloride is loaded into an autoclave and an excess<br>
of hydro fluoric acid added (&gt;100% molar), with a maximum pressure of 12 bar, at a<br>
maximum temperature of 90°C. When the release of gaseous hydrochloric acid has<br>
ceased (after approx. 10-15 hours) the contents of the autoclave are unloaded,<br>
neutralised with a solution of sodium bicarbonate and the product isolated by<br>
distillation.<br>
Melting point (°C):44.5°C<br>
