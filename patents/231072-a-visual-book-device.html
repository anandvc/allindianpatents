				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel visual book a<br>
.  This visual book is useful for the reader in understanding the text written<br><br>
therein by viewing the optical displays included on pages located in the book, which provides the visual representation of the relevant content of the text.<br>
Prior art references<br>
Illustrated text books have been made and used for centuries. In these books, the text and instructions are made of reading matter with sketches, illustrations, figures and/or drawings. Now-a-days, multi-colour presentations are quite common. Teaching aids have been developed which consist of a text manual together with different kits and models. The students have to operate the kit in conjunction with the text. These two arrangements i.e. the manual and the kit /models are two different physical entities.<br>
Recent developments have brought out "Talking Books" generally in the form of audio cassettes which have to be used with a cassette player. More recently, teaching aids are available on CD ROMs - for which a computer with a CD ROM drive is required.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
Here, the applicants present a "Visual Book", in which text matter and dynamic opto-electronics displays are integrated into a single unit. This technique enables the user to quickly grasp the subject matter and understand the concepts expressed in the text better as the phenomenon under study is being displayed dynamically,<br><br>
land interactively-with the text. It is also fascinating, especially to the children, to follow the concepts presented therein through the media of "moving lights"<br>
Detailed description of the Invention<br>
The present visual book comprising pages made of synthetic material such as plastics or natural material such as cardboard or wood or a combination of such materials and the book generally includes two parts namely-<br>
a)	text matter ; and<br>
b)	display section.<br>
The text/instruction matter comprising prose, cartoons, sketches, drawings, letters and/or figures. The display comprises static and/or dynamic opto-electronic presentation to portray time variant parameters of different phenomena according to the subject matter of the text under discussion. The display/ display means comprising various electrical and/or electronic components linked to one another to perform a required function. The text component and the display means are suitable arranged/located on the pages of the visual book. The various pages, once made, are compiled in any suitable manner such as spiral bound to form the book. The book may comprising of hard or flexible cover to provide protection for the pages and/or to display the title of the book.<br>
Statement of the Invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a visual book device  comprising plurality of pages (12)<br>
held together by a holding means(1) characterized in that one or morepages of the said plurality of pages<br>
(12) are text pages carrying a text section having drawings, sketches ,figures and/or written matter depicting<br>
one or more phenomenon.one or more pages of the said plurality of pages(12) are electrical display pages<br>
carrying display section having dynamicupto electronic display means display(6) wherein electrical<br>
display  page of text page of the operationally inter connected such that the electrical display page <br>
carrying the display section displays one or more of thephenomenon depicted by at lease one of the said text pages.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
The preferred aspects of the present invention are described with reference to the following figures and the following description should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention. In the accompanying drawings-<br>
Fig. 1 shows a page of the visual book,<br>
Fig. 2 shows pages containing text matter laminated in plastic sheet (front and<br>
back),<br>
Fig. 3 shows display mounted on the plastic sheet,<br>
Fig. 4 represents side view showing plywood buffer sandwiched between two<br>
acrylic sheets, each carrying a different dynamic display,<br>
Fig. 5 shows plywood buffer - front view, and<br>
Fig. 6 shows the binding process for displays and texts.<br>
The two parts of the Visual Book are manufactured as follows :<br>
1.	Text matter composed of cartoons, drawings  within material, figures, etc.<br>
are drawn on a computer and printed (in multiple colours, if desrred) on paper of<br>
dimensions slightly less than that of the book. Each page is then inserted between<br>
a set of two transparent plastic sheets of the same dimensions as the book and then<br>
laminated.    Preferably,    two pages can also be inserted, back to back, for<br>
lamination, so that both sides of the plastic sheet display text matter (fig.2).   As<br>
many sets of laminated texts are prepared as required and kept ready for binding at<br>
the final stage.<br>
2.	Dynamic displays are prepared keeping the following in mind.<br>
Each display forms a portion of a leaf (page) or whole of a leaf of the book, with vacant space around or by the side of the display; this space being utilised for providing, for example, by pasting, riveting or screwing instructions to operate that particular display.<br><br>
Preferably, the display can be subordinate to the text. In other words, it is preferred to keep the display as a low profile. To achieve this, they are fabricated with printed circuit boards having opto-electronic devices (LEDs etc.) on the front side and other components active devices like transistors and ICs, passive devices like resistors and capacitors on the reverse. The LEDs preferable be of miniature in size such as 0.5 to 2 mm, more preferably 1 to 1.5 mm in many cases, so that they do not protrude from the front of the page carrying the display. The pages carrying the displays are fabricated from any suitable material preferably acrylic sheets of approximately 2 mm thickness, with a slot of the same dimensions as the opto-electronic display. The PCB should extend beyond the display on all sides by at least 10 mm. It is fixed on the back face of the acrylic sheet by machine screws so that the display is visible through the slot.<br>
Even with low profile and surface-mount devices, the components side of the PCB protrudes from the back of the acrylic sheet by 4-6 mm. This will prevent the next page from sitting flush with the rear side of the acrylic which carries the previous display. This can be prevented as follows:<br>
A plywood sheet of 4 mm thickness, and with a slot to accommodate the entire PCB is fixed on the rear side. At the back of the plywood, a second acrylic sheet carrying another display is fixed back to back. If the display PCBs are less than half the acrylic size each, two such displays can be fixed on two acrylic sheets with the plywood sandwiched in between as a buffer. Care needs to be taken to see that if the first display is arranged at the upper half of the acrylic sheet, the second one is at the lower half of the acrylic sheet at the back. In this manner the total thickness of the display pages when jointed together will be 8 mm., accommodating two opto-electronic displays and their relevant instructional matter. This feature is shown in fig. 4. In this manner, the rear sides of each of the<br><br>
are accommodated in the plywood slots and covered by the acrylic sheets once they are screwed together. The cover and back pages of the "Visual Book" are also prepared from acrylic sheets. Uniformity is thus maintained and strength is added to the book which has to carry four or more displays.<br>
Each of the PCBs portrays a phenomena through static and dynamic displays using miniature LEDs, acrylic strips of various colours and, when required, optical fibres; separately illuminated. Some of the displays are inter-active, the viewer can change the display pattern at will. For this purpose, miniature push switches are installed on the display side of the PCB, these being operated through the slots in the acrylic panel.<br>
The displays on each of the PCBs are part of the text matter and arranged to be operated with reference to the context.<br>
The PCB of the last display in the book carries, in addition to the operating circuits, a power regulator circuit. Power is supplied to the "book" displays through a standard DC adapter which plugs into the AC mains. The output of the adaptor is nominally 9 volts DC for the PCB electronics and each of the PCBs is separately connected through flexible wires to this regulator output; through side slots in the plywood buffers. Each PCB is provided with a separate on-off push switch, on the display. Battery operation can be arranged if a separate slot is made to accommodate dry cells or re-chargeable Ni Cd ones. A minimum of 9 volts will be required to operate the regulator circuit on the PCB. This arrangement makes the "Visual Book" free from external power supply requirements.<br><br>
Once the acrylic sheets with displays and the text laminations are arranged in order, binding is completed using flexible sticker sheets as shown in the accompanying diagram.<br>
With reference to the drawings, the following parts of the display page can be identified.<br>
One or more pages of such text is followed by the display panel, which consist of, as shown hi Fig. 1:<br>
1.	A pre-arranged pattern of LEDs of one or more colours (6).<br>
2.	Electronic   drive   circuitry   incorporating  integrated   circuits,   resistors,<br>
capacitors, diodes, transistor and switches (9).<br>
All these devices are assembled on a PCB, specially fabricated for each display. In addition, it is necessary that the assembled ckcuit and display be of minimum thickness, otherwise incorporating these as a "page" of the book will prove a difficult exercise. Using 1.5 mm LEDs, surface-mount ICs and other devices, 2 mm thick custom built electronic displays are possible. When SMDs cannot be used, slots can be cut into the PCB at appropriate positions and the ICs recessed into these slots with their leads soldered at the back, after turning them at right angles.<br>
Some displays are inter-active. The student/user can change part of the display programme at will. In such cases, user operative switches of miniature size - 7 will need to be installed on the PCB. These also form part of the electronic display board.<br><br>
In designing the PCB, care should be taken that the overall dimensions (length and width) are less than the dimensions of the book page. In fixing the display panel a slot is cut in the sheet which forms the page of the book.<br>
In those pages which incorporate such displays, a slot has to be cut to accommodate the display on the PCB. The entire PCB is then fixed on to the page from the rear by using mechanical fasteners (8) e.g., wire loops or miniature machines screws. Holes (11) have to be drilled into the page on one side for inserting the plastic helical coil (1) (for turning the page). Sufficient border material should be left on all the four sides of the page.<br>
Power supply wires (2) are soldered on the PCB and emerge through the binding coil at the top. In case battery operation is required, a rechargeable nickel cadmium or dry cell of 9V can be used. For this purpose, a cavity is created in the book by cutting a slot slightly larger than the battery in all pages (9) except front and back covers.<br>
With reference to the drawing, the following parts of the display page can be identified.<br>
1.	Binding coil<br>
2.	Power cable for connecting to power unit - not required in case the book is<br>
operated from a battery<br>
3.	Accompanying text.<br>
4.	Outline of PCB (at rear).<br>
5.	Slot in page sufficiently large for display to be observed.<br>
6.	Opto-electronic LED display<br><br>
7.	Switches - If required - for interactive displays.<br>
8.	PC Board fastener (screws or wire loops).<br>
9.	ICs and other electronic components on PCB (not visible, back of page).<br>
10.	Operating instructions<br>
11.	Binding holes.<br>
12.	Page (leaf) made of card board / bakelite etc. of minimum thickness 2 mm.<br>
13.	Cavity for battery placement. Made of individual slots hi each page at the<br>
same position.<br>
By this method, different displays can be incorporated into different pages. Each page can also have more than one display. These display pages inserted between regular pages form the entire visual book which is now a useful teaching-aid.<br>
The following considerations will determine the selection of material for pages of the book (12).<br>
1.	Low cost, for consideration of economy hi production. Stiff cardboard of 2<br>
mm thickness is the lowest priced option.    Some others are poly-propylene,<br>
bakelight and acrylic. All these are suitable, the final choice being determined - hi<br>
any specific case - by weight and cost considerations.<br>
2.	Thickness of sheet which should be at least 2 mm so that when the display<br>
is fixed into the slot from rear, the display and devices should not protrude above<br>
the sheet.<br>
3.	Strength of material - which finally determines the maximum size of the<br>
PCB which can be accommodated in a page<br><br>
4.	Surface uniformity and smoothness<br>
5.	Light weight<br>
6.	Electrically non-conductive.<br>
The "Visual Book" has the following advantages over conventional texts, kits and teaching aids:<br>
1.	The displays, being dynamic and based on opto-electronic devices, are<br>
fascinating to watch; especially since we have colour associated with movement.<br>
They are of special interest to the younger generation, for whom these books have<br>
been designed.<br>
2.	In conjunction with texts, they explain difficult concepts through easily<br>
understandable language of moving lights.   When incorporated with miniature<br>
speakers, sound can also be provided in the display itself, making a multi-media<br>
book.<br>
3.	In displays which are inter-active, the viewer can exercise control over the<br>
displays.<br>
4.	The entire book constituted in the form described earlier is basically self-<br>
instructional, requiring little or no guidance from teachers.<br>
5.       The displays and accompanying texts will also arouse the curiosity of the student/viewer to investigate the topics more deeply.    It is well known that<br><br>
interesting subjects taught in a dull manner suppress whatever enthusiasm that exists in the minds of the young and curious ones.<br><br><br><br>
