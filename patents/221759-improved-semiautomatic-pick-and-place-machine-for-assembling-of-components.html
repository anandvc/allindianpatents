				<td>IMPROVED SEMI-AUTOMATIC PICK &amp; PLACE MACHINE FOR ASSEMBLY OF COMPONENTS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an improved version of semi-automatic pick and<br>
place machine for Surface Mount Devices and fine pitch components.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Pick and place machine for Surface Mount Device (SMD) is an electromechanical<br>
system that finds wide use in the component assembly stage of the PCB in electronics<br>
industry. These machines under the control of computer not only help the operator to<br>
pickup the correct SMD component automatically but also place these components<br>
very accurately onto the Printed Circuit Boards (PCB). The use of these machines<br>
provides more economical production of PCB's.<br>
The conventional leaded electronic components are mounted through holes and<br>
soldered on the flip side of the PCB. Because conventional leaded components are<br>
mounted through the holes of a PCB so they are called through hole type components<br>
whereas  Surface  Mount Devices (SMD) are  electronic  integrated  circuits and<br>
components, which are mounted and soldered on the surface of the Printed Circuit<br>
Board (PCB) without mounting holes.<br>
Pick and place machine for Surface Mount Devices is an electromechanical machine,<br>
which finds wide uses in the assembly of SMD components on the PCB in electronics<br>
industry.<br>
The following three types of such machines are currently available in the international<br>
market:<br>
i.         manual<br>
ii.        semiautomatic<br>
iii.       fully automatic MANUAL PICK &amp; PLACE MACHINE<br>
The manual pick &amp; place machine has a vacuum pickup head, a PCB holder and the rack to hold the 1C feeder. The vacuum gets activated or deactivated automatically on pressing the nozzle either against the 1C for picking or against the PCB while placing. However, this is used only when few SMD components are to be placed on the PCB and the number of such PCBs is small. SEMI-AUTOMATIC PICK &amp; PLACE MACHINE<br><br>
The semi-automatic machine uses computer as a partial control for accurate pick and place of SMD components onto the PCB's. The computer assists the operator in assembly operation of such PCBs'. These machines under the control of computer not only help the operator to pickup the correct SMD component but also place these components very accurately onto the PCB's. Such types of machines are useful for low to medium scale production where the total annual requirement of one type of PCB assembly is of the order of hundreds in number. FULLY AUTOMATIC PICK AND PLACE MACHINE<br>
The fully automatic pick and place machine for SMD is totally controlled by the computer and these machines are useful for large-scale assembly of PCBs1 of the order of thousands in number. The throughput in such systems is much higher as compared to the semi-automatic machines.<br>

Basic 6.0 as the software language. The Flow Chart of the user interface software<br>
developed for this machine is shown in Fig. 6.<br>
The Graphical User Interface provided in the present invention, comprises following<br>
menus:<br>
File Menu: The user selection of assembly of PCB by either opening a new file or<br>
using OPEN option of the File Menu if file already exists. This file is used to store the<br>
contents of the table in the EDIT menu as well as to store the statistics of components<br>
in the Start menu.<br>
Edit Menu: Two submenus are available under this menu<br>
i)         Online/Offline<br>
ii)        Table<br>
Online/Offline submenu: The user can edit the data either online i.e. when the<br>
machine is operational or in offline when machine is not connected to the computer.<br>
Table menu: The user can select the table option of EDIT menu for entering in the<br>
table the following data:<br>
(a)	the rack number,<br>
(b)	feeder or carrousel number,<br>
(c)	component name,<br>
(d)	X, Y co-ordinates of the pick position of the component.<br>
(e)	error tolerance in the X. Y pick co-ordinates.<br>
(f)	tool required for pick up the component,<br>
(g)	position of the component on the PCB,<br>
(h)	X, Y co-ordinates of the place position of the SMD components,<br>
(i)	error tolerance in the place co-ordinates, orientation of the component<br>
on the PCB;<br>
(j)	error messages; and<br>
(k)	orientation of component on the PCB.<br>
Various options under the table menu are: Insert, Paste, Delete, Mark, Teach, Sort and Esc.<br>
Using the above options the operator can complete the table for the assembly process. In the sort option the whole of the table data can be sorted based on either on rack<br><br>
number or on tool number so that user don't keep on changing the rack as well as tool<br>
frequently during assembly.<br>
Start Menu: In this menu two options have been provided in our software, which are<br>
as follows:<br>
1).   Offset: The user can feed the offset value either through keyboard or teach the<br>
machine the offset value by bringing the pickup head at the mark point of the PCB.<br>
The value entered for Offset is in mm if METRIC flag =1 or in inches if Metric flag=2<br>
as set in Environment METRIC option.<br>
2).  Assembly: In the assembly option of the start menu various options are available<br>
to the user like:<br>
(i)	Start assembly from line number<br>
(ii)	Start assembly from saved line number position<br>
(iii)	Save current assemble line number<br>
(iv)	Switch to Graphics screen<br>
(v)	Display of Current line number<br>
(vi)	Display of X, Y co-ordinate of the Pickup head<br>
(vi i)	Display of Orientation of the component<br>
The Assembly software subroutine performs the operation of sensing the completion<br>
of accurate placement of SMD component on the PCB in our machine.<br>
Two inductive sensors are used on the vacuum pickup head to sense the following<br>
conditions: vacuum is OFF and the pickup head is in home position and the current X,<br>
Y co-ordinate of the pickup head matches with the X,Y place co-ordinate of the<br>
component as defined in the table.<br>
Once the machine checks these parameters, the machine software embedded in<br>
HPROM communicates to the computer about successful completion of placement of<br>
the component.<br>
The RUMGRAPHICS subroutine of the graphics screen option displays on the<br>
computer video monitor the feeder location using a square symbol and the left and<br>
right circle displays the carrousel. The place co-ordinate is displayed by the square<br>
with a Crosshatch mark, the current head location is displayed by the square with cross<br>
mark. The graphics screen also displays the X, Y co-ordinates of the pick &amp; place<br>
location, current line number, orientation of the component, PCB number, PCB Type<br>
number This visual graphical aid to the user through computer helps the operator in<br>
the assembly process of the SMD component.<br><br>
The computer stores the name of the component assembled by this machine in a<br>
dynamic array as well as in a file.<br>
Print Menu: The Print Menu option helps the user to print the table either selected<br>
row or full table.<br>
Statistics Menu:<br>
Menu Statistics of SMD Components Assembled: This software menu is designed to<br>
count the number for each distinct name of the components assembled either by using<br>
the file or by using dynamic array as created in the Assembly submenu.<br>
Using Graph32.OCX ActiveX control the name and count of the components are<br>
plotted through bar graph.<br>
Using Grid32.OCX ActiveX control the name and count of the components are<br>
displayed in tabular form.<br>
Menu Statistics of SMD Components Per PCB:<br>
The names of the SMD components per PCB are available in the table, which is<br>
constructed during Table submenu, and these names are stored in a array variable.<br>
This software counts the number for each distinct name of the SMD components as<br>
per PCB available in the array.<br>
Total PCB Assembled: This option displays the total number of PCBs that have been<br>
assembled.<br>
Environment Menu:<br>
Under Environment Menu, the following features are available:<br>
Communication Port Setting: This option sets the communication port for the computer to<br>
communicate with the machine.<br>
Assembly Setting: The following three options are provided to set up the PCB:<br>
Type number, PCB Number and Skip line number<br>
Convert:<br>
Using this option, user can cause input of the PCB board file, whose table is to be<br>
created. Then the incorporated software operates the MODLOC.EXE command on<br>
this board file. MODLOC.EXE file of the ORCAD software generates a report of all<br>
the component information of a PCB board file like component reference designation,<br>
orientation, X, Y co-ordinates, name of the component from the board file and stores<br>
this in temporary data file. Thereafter, upon the prompt received from the system, X,<br>
Y reference co-ordinates of the PCB are entered. Then the system computes the X, Y<br><br>
place co-ordinates of the other components with reference to this reference X, Y point.<br>
Subsequently, the X, Y place co-ordinates of the components, orientation of the<br>
component, name of the component, component reference designation in the PCB are<br>
stored in a file<br>
Metric:<br>
By using this utility the software sets the METRIC flag to 1 for mm and to 2 for<br>
inches operation. This utility is used for the conversion of inch data to mm if METRIC<br>
flag is 2 and vice versa.<br>
The X, Y co-ordinates data are entered either in inches or in mm in the Table menu as well as<br>
during OFFSET Menu.<br>
Maximum number of components:<br>
The contents of table menu are assigned to dynamic variable array with maximum<br>
Number of components say ROWMAX as shown in the Flowchart 6(S1).<br>
The user inputs the range of number of components per PCB from 1 to 2000 say<br>
ROWE.  In case ROWE is less than or equal to ROWMAX then the software reduces<br>
the number of rows of the TABLE and assigns the contents of array to the table.<br>
If ROWE is greater than ROWMAX then the number of rows of the TABLE is<br>
increased and the contents of array are assigned to the table.<br>
In the Table menu the user can feed various parameters of the PCB whose maximum<br>
number of rows are defined by this option. In the Assembly menu, the computer<br>
communicates to the machine line by line of this dynamic table for assembly of<br>
components on PCB.<br>
Help menu: ON LINE HELP is provided with reference to hardware as well as<br>
software operation of the SAPP machine.<br>

The rack and feeder assembly (1) and the carrousel assembly provide the SMD components to the PCB (13) for assembly. The PCB (13) is held firmly by the mounting frame assembly (7). The components are picked up by the Vacuum pickup head (5) by manually translating the pickup head over the X, Y assembly block (3). Z and theta movement assembly (6) of the pickup head allows the pickup head assembly (5) to move in + Z direction during pick &amp; place operation. The pickup nozzle (5) can be rotated through 360 degree by the theta movement assembly (6). The X, Y air brake assembly (4) brakes the X,Y assembly(3) at the correct X,Y placement coordinate of the component. Moveable hand rest (8) provides firm support to the hand while moving pickup head (5) along the X, Y-axis. Periscopic vision system along with CCD camera assembly (9) performs the function to provide a magnified overhead picture of the SMD component showing simultaneously and parallax free all four sides of the fine pitch SMD components and the PCB pads (13) through CCD camera onto the video monitor. The computer having User Interface Software (11) communicates to the machine microcontroller (10) through RS-232 (12) interface and vice versa. The microcontroller and the associated electronics (10) perform the various functions required for the operation of this machine like identification of rack assembly, identification of feeder, rotation of carrousel assembly, operation of X, Y air brake, operation of Z brake, receiving and sending data to computer through RS-232, sending X, Y co-ordinates of the pickup nozzle to the computer, sending the status of completion of assembly of SMD component. The computer and the associated user interface software (11) handle the complete data of the PCB that is required to be assembled. The computer sends line by line the complete data for each SMD component to the microcontroller that performs the operation of the machine. In Fig 6. Flow Chart of the User Interfacing Software is given. When the user runs this software, it initialises the variables and loads the following Menu options to the user:<br>

FIG 7 shows the various block diagram of the electronics hardware required to achieve various functional requirements of the Pick &amp; Place machine. In fig 7 block 1 shows the Pentium-II computer having User Interface Software, block 2 is RS-232 physical interface cable, block 3 is a RS-232 driver, block 4 is a crystal oscillator, block 5 is microcontroller, block 6 is EPROM where microcontroller software resides, block 7 is a RAM for temporary storage of data, block 8 is input/output interface driver, block 9 is Rack sensor to decode the rack number, block 10 is a Feeder Led driver to indicate the correct feeder, block 11 is Carrousel stepper motor driver and optocoupler circuit , block 12 is tool, vacuum and carrousel LED driver, block 13 is brake relay driver for X,Y movement of pickup head , block 14 is brake relay driver for Z movement of the pickup head , block 16 is a vacuum ON/OFF relay driver circuit. Block 17 is a X, Y movement and direction measurement circuit, block 18 is X. Y linear encoder scale, block 19 is the power supply required to drive this electronics module.<br>
In fig. 7 Pentium II computer along with User Interface Software (1) communicates with microcontroller Intel 8032 (5) through RS-232 cable (2) and RS-232 driver MAX-232 (3). After receiving the command from the computer, microcontroller (5) decode this command and jump to the required subroutine stored in EPROM (6) to perform various machine functions through the electronics block. The data received from the computer is stored in RAM (7). The microcontroller (5) through the input/output interface driver (8) 74LS245 drives the various electronics hardware of the machine. The address decoder (20) 74LS138 decodes the address to various blocks of the microcontroller like RAM (7), EPROM (6), and input/output (8).<br>
When power is on for the machine, microcontroller initialises the machine by initialising the stepper motor through optocoupler circuit (10) and drives the feeder LED (10), tool LED (12), X, Y brake (13), Z brake (14) and initialises the X, Y position co-ordinate to zero, all these in a sequential manner. When user clicks ONLINE menu, the computer communicates with the microcontroller. By using the Table menu of the user interface software, and user inputs the Rack number in the table, the computer through interface software communicates this rack number to microcontroller (5). The microcontroller then checks through Rack sensor (9) and communicates to the computer as to whether correct Rack is placed on the machine or else the microcontroller sends an error message to the user through computer display. Similarly when user feeds the feeder number in the table menu, computer (1) communicates to microcontroller (5) about this, which then drives the Feeder LED driver circuit (10).<br>
When user feeds the Carrousel number in the Table menu, the computer interfacing software (1) communicates to the microcontroller (5) about this, which in turn drives the stepper motor (11) to place the correct carrousel bin for the user to pick the SMD components.<br>
During Teach option on Table menu, the microcontroller reads the X, Y co-ordinates of the pick up head through X, Y movement block (17) which is receiving the input from the X, Y linear encoder scale (18). Microcontroller keeps on incrementing /decrementing through its internal counter, the X&amp;Y movement of pickup nozzle. During Assembly option of the Start menu, computer interfacing software (1) communicates to the microcontroller (5) line by line data of the Table as stored in the EDIT menu. This data are stored by the microcontroller in the RAM (7). The microcontroller then performs the operation of sensing the correct Rack number through rack sensor (9), driving the feeder LED (10) or driving the carrousel motor (11) and driving the Tool LED (12) as per the data in the line of the table. Microcontroller keeps on tracking the X, Y movement of the pickup head through block (17). When the pickup head reaches the X, Y pickup co-ordinates the Z brake relay (14) gets deactivated to allow the user to lower the pickup head to pick the component. When the pickup head touches the component the proximity sensor (15) senses the touch pressure and makes the vacuum ON/OFF (16) circuit ON. The component gets lifted through vacuum, when the user lifts the pickup head the microcomputer senses it and activates the Z brake (14). The user now cannot lower the<br>
pickup head. The microcontroller keeps on tracking the X, Y co-ordinate (17) of the pickup head. When it reaches the X, Y place co-ordinate the Z brake gets deactivated and the X, Y air brakes (13) gets activated through the microcontroller (1). The user can now place the component on the PCB, when the pick up head is lowered, the proximity sensor senses the touch pressure of the pickup head with the PCB and toggle the vacuum ON/OFF driver i.e., it makes the vacuum relay OFF and the component get placed on the PCB. When the user releases the pickup head to its normal rest position after placing the component, the microcontroller senses it and communicates to the computer about completion of the assembly of the current line or the SMD component. Computer after this command sends the next line to the microcomputer for assembly.<br>
Fig.8 describes the Mounting Frame for holding the PCB. The guide block subassembly is shown in Fig. 8(a). The guide block sub-assembly moves forward and backward on guide channels. The novel idea of using strip which is attached at the bottom side of guide block, avoid the scratch generated on guide channels due to the tightening of the screw which is required to hold the guide block against the guide channels.<br>
