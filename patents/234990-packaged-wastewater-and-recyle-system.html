4<br>
A method and apparatus for recycling wastewater is described in US Pat. No. 5,456,829 to Brown dated 10/10/1995. Brown's apparatus for recycling wastewater solutions includes a treatment tank and an air-operated pump and piping system for pumping wastewater contaminated with oil, heavy metals, and suspended solids from industrial equipment such as a jetwasher to the treatment tank, and for subsequently returning the purified water solution to the industrial equipment for reuse.<br>
US Pat. No. 4,532,035 states a rotating biological contactor for the biological purification of waste water. With contactor bodies formed of spirally wound up corrugated panels providing ducts in the region of the corrugation profiles which are alternately filled with waste water and air, there is a problem to completely fill the ducts and to provide a continuous flow through the ducts in a body of simple and rigid construction. In order to solve this problem, according to the said US Pat. No. 4,532,035, the corrugation profiles of at least one corrugated panel are inclined at a predetermined angle relative to the axis of the contactor body. Thereby, the disadvantages of the known, mechanically unstable constructions comprising a tube bundle are avoided and an intensive flow of waste water and air within the ducts is achieved. Advantageously, the corrugation profiles of winding layers arranged radially above each other or axially beneath each other comprise different inclination angles, especially angles which are opened contrary to each other.<br>
In US Pat. No. 4,568,457 an industrial waste anaerobic digester is disclosed having separate sections therein, in which the acid forming and gas forming phases of the digestion process can occur separately under conditions optimized for each phase. A rotating biological contactor is provided in each section for increasing the liquid/gas interface to facilitate the anaerobic reaction. A series of partitions is provided in each section to create zones in which the waste concentration is extremely high and on which the biota can react at maximal reaction rates. The C02 produced in the acid forming phase is used in both acid and gas forming sections to mix and achieve pH adjustment, and the methane can be used in the gas forming sections for mixing. A thermophilic chamber in the center of the tank is surrounded by the mesophyllic chamber to minimize and utilize conductive heat loss.<br>
A modular rotating biological contactor apparatus is provided in US Pat. No. 4,737,278 which utilizes a plurality of hemicylindrical trough sections, a plurality of bulkhead means interconnecting adjacent trough sections, and a pair of endplate means as subassemblies. These subassemblies are prefabricated and adapted for simple and easy interconnection with one another by means of integrally formed disengagable associatable interfitting means. Using these subassemblies, a plurality of different configurational possibilities for rotating biological contactor apparatus are achievable.<br>
WO Pat. Application No. 1999035097 refers to the capacity of an aerobic bioconversion system for the wastewater treatment of an olive oil processing<br><br>
5<br>
plant, concerning the phytotoxicity reduction by means of a biocontactor having various shapes, which is either rotating and in line or in circle moving, while the treated wastewater is stationary or only statistically rotating, while the treated wastewater is moving. WO Pat. Application No. 1999035097 refers to an additional transport motion either of the biocontactor, implemented by placing the biocontactor on a trolley-frame, or of the treated wastewater with the rotating biocontactor remaining fixed, implemented by kinetic energy addition to the liquid (in all its treatment phases, especially while the gel phase) by means of mixers etc. The additional transport motion of the biocontactor allows treatment of a multiple wastewater volume. The suggested capacity increase allows for multiple greater efficiency of the whole plant in constructional and operating point of view, comparing with the biocontactor of the former technique. WO Pat. Application No. 1999035097 is applicable for bioreactors with aerobic microorganisms, whose breathing time can be practically utilized for the additional suggested motion (linear or circular) of either the biocontactor or the treaded wastewater, as is the case in olive oil processing plants.<br>
A method and apparatus for enhancing the settleability of suspended wastewater solids is provided in US Pat. No. 4,721,570 for a wastewater treatment system comprising a primary clarifier apparatus, a compartmentalized, sequential secondary biological treatment apparatus such as a rotating biological contactor tank, and a secondary clarifier, wherein a portion of waste sludge from the clarifier is diverted to compartments of the rotating biological contactor tank to enhance the flocculation of the suspended waste solids. The diverted sludge particles serve as flocculation nuclei which promote settleability and lower turbidity once the effluent reaches the secondary clarifier.<br>
WO Pat. Application No. 1995033694 discloses a media panel for a rotating biological treatment apparatus for treating waste water, the rotating biological treatment apparatus including a rotatable shaft having a longitudinal axis and a plurality of media panel assemblies stacked on the shaft and a plurality of media panels mounted on the hub, the media panel comprising a planar member having a first side and a second side, and the planar member being mountable on the hub to extend normal to the longitudinal axis for the shaft to form a portion of a generally disk-shaped media panel assembly extending normal to the longitudinal axis of the shaft; the first side of the planar member including at least one first set of alternating grooves and ridges, and the second side of the media panel including at least one second set of grooves and ridges; the grooves and ridges of the first and second sets of alternating grooves and ridges each having a first radially inner portion, a second radially inner portion spaced apart from the first radially inner portion, and a radially outer portion between and spaced radially outwardly with respect to the first and second radially inner portions when the media panel is mounted on the hub.<br>
After an exhaustive study on both relevant and related patent documents and on existing conventional wastewater treatment and recycle systems it has been found that there is a need for a packaged wastewater treatment and<br><br>
6<br>
recycle system suitable for housing, commercial and industrial complexes, hotels, hospitals, construction camps, etc. and having an odour-free environment. Moreover, the operation of the conventional wastewater treatment and recycling systems are not simple and the conventional systems require significant human intervention. There are many problems in the existing wastewater treatment and recycling systems which will be clear from the objectives of the present invention. Thus, it would be desirable to devise a wastewater treatment and recycle system that obviates the existing problems of the prior arts.<br>

5. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The packaged wastewater treatment and recycle system, according to the present invention, carries out biochemical oxidation using an attached growth aerobic biological system. The entire system, shown in Fig. 1, is a soundless unit. The system, according to the present invention, takes up atmospheric oxygen without any splashing and spraying of wastewater unlike aeration systems. The effluent is clarified meeting the most stringent standards with the greatest of ease. The entire system is a complete packaged and containerized assembly mounted on a "skid" type base. The system produces very little sludge - and that too in a completely mineralized form convertible into garden compost.<br>
Raw wastewater is collected in a tank (15) provided by the owner of the system, according to the present invention, and pumped at a steady rate into the system where organic matter in the wastewater comes into intimate<br><br>
11<br>
contact with a very large area of a rotating biofilm (12) residing on synthetic disks. The disks have a very high specific surface and hence support a very high microbial population. Aeration is achieved by rapid surface renewal of thin films of wastewater. As the film grows in thickness it sloughs off and a new film takes its place. Mixed liquor containing the said biofilm is passed through a biofilm separator (14). Separated biofilm is recycled to the sludge zone of the said collection tank (15). Where the treated effluent is to be recycled for toilet flushing and gardening etc., the effluent is pumped through a pressure sand filter and an activated carbon column for further polishing.<br>
Excess sludge from the sludge zone of the said collection tank (15) is drawn out once in 30 days and de-watered on sludge trolley or in a filter press (4). A control section (18) provides a direct reading of the flow-rate.<br>
The entire operation is extremely simple and the said system once stabilized, can be left to itself with very little human intervention. A control panel (18) takes care of the operation of the said system. The treated effluent meets the most stringent of standards for recycle.<br>
The system, according to the present invention, is elegantly designed with particular emphasis on compactness, aesthetics and ergonomics — suitable for housing, commercial and industrial complexes, hotels, hospitals, construction camps, etc. Even the geometry of the unit can be tailored to suit space constraints. The said system has wide choice of installation options, e.g., in basements, underground, on terraces etc. The fully enclosed design ensures an odour-free environment unlike conventional systems. The system, according to the present invention, requires low power input. The power input is at least less than 30% that of a conventional activated sludge system. The said packaged system, as for an example, ranges from 1m3/ day capacity to as large as 1000 m3 / day capacity and in multiples thereof. As the said system uses rubberized epoxy coating, the said coating gives excellent protection from corrosion and rusting. The design of the said system is optimized in such a way that the said system uses moving parts as minimum as required. Geared motor (13), pumps (6, 11, 19) and support bearings of the said system constitute the moving parts requiring lubrication and servicing — the easy accessibility of these makes maintenance very convenient. Installation of the said system is very easy as the said system is entirely prefabricated and is merely to be mounted at the site in the tank (15) constructed by the owner.<br>
The following Table shows space and power requirements of the basic module of the system, according to the present invention.<br>
