				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a method for determining a state variable of an electric arc furnace, especially for determining the level of the foamed slag (15) in an electric arc furnace. According to said method, the energy supplied to the electric arc furnace is determined with the aid of at least one electric sensor (13a, 13b, 13c) while solid-borne noise is measured in the form of oscillations on the electric arc furnace. The at least one state variable, particularly the level of the foamed slag (15), is determined by means of a transfer function which is determined by evaluating the measured oscillations, i.e. the solid-borne noise, and evaluating measured data of the at least one electric sensor (13a, 13b, 13c). The state of the level of the foamed slag (15) can thus be reliably recognized and be monitored over time. The level of the foamed slag (15) is decisive for the effectiveness with which energy is fed into the electric arc furnace. Furthermore, losses caused by radiation are reduced by covering the arc (18) with the foamed slag (15). The improved measuring method allows the level of the foamed slag to be automatically controlled or regulated in a reliable manner.</td>

Method for determining at least one state variable of an<br>
electric arc furnace, and electric arc furnace<br>
The invention relates to a method for determining at least one<br>
state variable of an electric arc furnace with at least one<br>
electrode, wherein the energy supplied to the electric arc<br>
furnace is determined with the aid of at least one electric<br>
sensor. The invention also relates to an electric arc furnace<br>
with a furnace casing and with at least one electrode, wherein<br>
a current lead is provided for each electrode.<br>
If is known from DE 197 48 310 C1 to predict foamed slag in an<br>
electric arc furnace on the basis of feed materials of the<br>
electric arc furnace, such as scrap, steel, alloying agents or<br>
admixed materials, in combination with the energy supplied to<br>
the electric arc furnace. However, it has been found that<br>
state variables of the electric arc furnace cannot be<br>
determined sufficiently reliably and accurately enough in this<br>
way.<br>
European patent application EP 0 637 638 A1 discloses a method<br>
for producing a molten metal in an electric arc furnace. Here,<br>
the layer height of a foamed slag is measured as the state<br>
variable of the electric arc furnace and possibly used for<br>
regulating the layer height of a foamed slag. Disclosed for<br>
measuring the level of the foamed slag are noise emissions<br>
originating from the electric arc furnace, which are used in<br>
the form of a measured noise level for controlling the layer<br>
height of the foamed slag. It is also disclosed that the<br>
electric operating parameters voltage and current intensity of<br>
the electric arc furnace may be used for measuring the level.<br><br>

PCT/EP2006/064156<br>
A method for regulating the electrode of a DC arc furnace and<br>
an electrode regulating device are known from the laid-open<br>
application EP 0 661 910 A1. Here, the supply of energy to the<br>
electric arc furnace is determined with the aid of at least one<br>
electric sensor. D2 also discloses that the slag level in the<br>
arc: furnace is a state variable.<br>

This object is achieved by a method of the type mentioned at<br>
the beginning, wherein oscillations on the electric arc furnace<br>

is determined by evaluating the measured oscillations and by<br>
evaluating measured data of the at least one electric sensor.<br><br>

state variables concerning the content of the electric arc<br>
furnace, can be determined according to the invention very<br>

operation, that is to say can be determined online. This<br>
satisfies an important prerequisite for improved automatic<br>
process control and regulation of the electric arc furnace.<br>

an excitation signal and from an output signal, the excitation<br>
signal being determined by evaluating measured data of the at<br>
least one electric sensor and the output signal being<br>
determined by evaluating the oscillations measured on the<br>
electric arc furnace.<br>

the at least one electric sensor and use it to form the<br>
excitation signal.<br>
in an advantageous development of the method, the excitation<br>
signal may be formed by multiplication of the current signal by<br>
itself, i.e. by squaring.<br><br>

the at least one electric sensor and used to form the<br>
excitation signal. if appropriate, the measurement and/or use<br>
of the voltage signal is performed as an alternative or in<br>
addition to the measurement and use of the current signal.<br>
The excitation signal may advantageously be formed by<br>
multiplication of the current signal by the voltage signal.<br>
The transfer function may advantageously be determined by way<br>
of a cross-power spectrum.<br>
The transfer function may preferably be evaluated at at least<br>
one discrete frequency.<br>
The at least one discrete frequency may advantageously be a<br>
multiple of the frequency of the power feed into the arc or<br>
into the electric arc furnace.<br>
If may bo expedient to determine the level of the foamed slag<br>
in dependence on the change in the transfer function at the one<br>
or more discrete frequencies.<br>
further advantageous forms of the method described above are<br>
specified in patent claims 14 to 20.<br>

Further advantages and details of the invention are described<br>
below on the basis of examples in conjunction with the<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
FIGURE 1 schematically shows an electric arc furnace according<br>
to the invention,<br>
FIGURE 2 schematically shows a section through the electric<br>
arc furnace.<br>
Figure 1 shows an electric arc furnace with a number of<br>
electrodes 3a, 3b, 3c, which are coupled with a current supply<br>
device 12 by way of current leads. The current supply device<br>
12 preferably has a furnace transformer.<br>
With the aid of at least one electrode, in the example shown<br>
three electrodes 3a, 3b, 3c, feed materials, such as for<br>
example scrap and/or steel, possibly with alloying agents<br>
and/or admixed materials, are melted in the electric arc<br>
furnace. When producing steel in the electric arc furnace,<br>
slag or foamed slag 15 (see Figure 2) is formed and is made to<br>
foam by blowing in a media mixture, as a means of improving the<br>
energy introduced by way of an arc 18 (see Figure 2), which<br>
forms at the at least one electrode 3, 3a, 3b, 3c.<br>
In the example shown, electric sensors 13a, 13b, 13c are<br>
provided on the current leads of the electrodes 3a, 3b, 3c and<br>
can be used to measure the current and/or voltage or the energy<br>
supplied to the electrodes 3a, 3b, 3c. The electric sensors<br>
13a, 13b, 13c are coupled with a signal processing device 8,<br>
for examp e by way of signal lines 14a, 14b, 14c for electric<br>
measuring signals, formed as cables.<br><br>

2005P11628WOUS<br>
Arranged on the wall 2 or on the panels of the furnace casing<br>
1, i.e. on the outer delimitation of the furnace casing 1, are<br>
structure-borne noise sensors 4a, 4b, 4c for measuring<br>
oscillations on the furnace casing 1. The structure-borne<br>
noise sensors 4, 4a, 4b, 4c may be arranged such that they are<br>
connected indirectly and/or directly to the furnace casing 1 or<br>
to the wall 2 of the furnace casing 1.<br>
As indicated in the example shown, the sensors for measuring<br>
structure-borne noise, i.e. the structure-borne noise sensors<br>
4, 4a, 4b, 4c, may be arranged on the outer wall of the furnace<br>
casing 1. Structure-borne noise sensors 4, 4a, 4b, 4c may, for<br>
example, be arranged at equal intervals around the furnace<br>
casing 1. In order to increase the accuracy of the structure-<br>
borne noise measurements, it may be expedient to provide a<br>
structure-borne noise sensor 4a, 4b, 4c respectively for each<br>
electrode 3a, 3b, 3c. In this case, the structure-borne noise<br>
sensors 4a, 4b, 4c do not necessarily have to be arranged on<br>
the outer wall of the furnace casing 1. At least one sensor<br>
4a, 4b, 4c that is assigned to an electrode 3a, 3b, 3c may<br>
preferably be arranged at a location at the smallest possible<br>
distance from this electrode 3a, 3b, 3c, preferably at a<br>
location on the outer wall of the furnace casing 1. The<br>
structure-borne noise is passed through the steel bath 16<br>
and/or through the foamed slag 15 to the furnace casing 1 and<br>
can be measured indirectly and or directly on the furnace<br>
casing 1 in the form of oscillations.<br>
The structure-borne noise sensors 4, 4a, 4b, 4c are connected<br>
to the signal processing device 8. The signals that are<br>
emitted by the structure-borne noise sensors 4, 4a, 4b, and 4c<br>
to the signal processing device 8 are at least partially passed<br>
by way of an optical waveguide 7. Arranged between the optical<br>
waveguide 7 and the structure-borne noise sensors 4, 4a, 4b, 4c<br>
is at least one optical device 6, which serves for amplifying<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/064156	- 6a -<br>
2005P1162 8WOUS<br>
and /or converting signals of the one or more st.ructurc-borne<br>
noise sensors<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/064156	- 7 -<br>
2005P11628WOUS<br>
4, 4a, 4b, 4c. Signal lines 5, 5a, 5b, 5c, which carry the<br>
signals of the structure-borne noise sensors 4a, 4b, 4c, may be<br>
provided in close proximity to the furnace casing 1, or under<br>
some circumstances even directly on the furnace casing 1. The<br>
signal lines 5, 5a, 5b, 5c are preferably routed such that they<br>
arc protected from heat, electromagnetic fields, mechanical<br>
loading and/or other loads.<br>
The electric sensors 13a, 13b, 13c may preferably be connected<br>
by way of signal lines 14a, 14b, 14c, which are formed as<br>
cables, to the signal processing device 8. In the signal<br>
processing device 8, evaluation data are determined from the<br>
measuring signals of the structure-borne noise sensors 4, 4a,<br>
4b, 4c and from the measuring signals of the electric sensors<br>
13a, 13b, 13c. The evaluation data relate to at least one<br>
state variable of the electric arc furnace, the evaluation data<br>
preferably relating to the foamed slag 15 (see Figure 2) or its<br>
level. The signal processing device 8 emits a state signal 10,<br>
preferably the currently calculated and/or pre-calculated level<br>
of the foamed slag 15, to a regulating device 9 for the<br>
electric arc furnace. The state signal 10 at least partially<br>
represents the evaluation data. Taking the state signals 10<br>
into account, the regulating device 9 determines regulating<br>
signals 11 for the electric arc furnace, for example for<br>
controlling the blowing-in of media mixture, the introduction<br>
of coal, the introduction of oxygen and/or other substances<br>
into the electric arc furnace.<br>
In an advantageous refinement of the invention, regulating<br>
signals 11 for controlling or regulating the position or the<br>
level of the at least one electrode 3, 3a, 3b, 3c may also be<br>
determined. In order to influence the position, in particular<br>
the level, of the electrodes 3, 3a, 3b, 3c, one or more control<br>
means for controlling the<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/064156 - 8 -<br>
2005P11628WOUS<br>
raising or lowering of the electrodes 3, 3a, 3b, 3c are<br>
provided and coupled with the regulating device 9.<br>
A control computer, which is not represented any more<br>
specifically and with the aid of which the buildup and level of<br>
the foamed slag 15 can be controlled or regulated, may be<br>
coupled with the electric arc furnace. The control computer<br>
emits actuating signals 11, in particular to a feeding device<br>
of the electric arc furnace. The control computer may include<br>
the signal, processing device 8 and/or the regulating device 9.<br>
A feeding device of the electric arc furnace may, for example,<br>
have a so-called injection lance, with the aid of which carbon,<br>
oxygen and/or lime are blown into the electric arc furnace,<br>
i.e. into the furnace casing 1 of the electric arc furnace.<br>
The substances mentioned above are blown in particular into the<br>
foamed slag 15 above the steel bath 16. With the aid of the<br>
feeding device, preferably carbon mixed with air is fed into<br>
the foamed slag 15. In the foamed slag, the carbon is<br>
transformed into carbon dioxide and/or carbon monoxide, so that<br>
foamed slag 15 is produced. By blowing in a media mixture with<br>
the aid of the feeding device, the introduction of energy by<br>
means of the arc 18 (see FIGURE 2) is improved. Furthermore,<br>
losses through radiation in the electric arc furnace are<br>
reduced.<br>
If is possible to measure the concentration of substances, in<br>
particular of gases, in the electric arc furnace directly or<br>
indirectly or determine such concentrations with the aid of<br>
models. The data on the concentration of substances, such as<br>
for example carbon, oxygen, carbon dioxide and/or carbon<br>
monoxide, are preferably fed to the control computer or the<br>
signal processing device and/or the regulating device 9. The<br>
fed data can be processed and used for determining regulating<br>
signals 11.<br><br>

2005P11628WOUS<br>
In a refinement given by way of example, the electric arc<br>
furnace shown in FIGURE 1 is formed as a three-phase AC arc<br>
furnace. In principle, the invention can be applied to arc<br>
furnaces of a wide variety of types, for example also to DC<br>
furnces.<br>
Figure 2 shows in a simplified representation an electrode 3,<br>
3a, 3b, 3c with an arc 18 in an electric arc furnace. Arranged<br>
on the wall 2 of the furnace casing 1 of the electric arc<br>
furnace is a structure-borne noise sensor 4, 4a, 4b, 4c, which<br>
is connected to a signal line 5, 5a, 5b, 5c, with the aid of<br>
which measuring signals can be passed to a signal processing<br>
device 8 (see Figure 1). The steel bath 16 and the foamed slag<br>
15 in the furnace casing 1 are schematically represented.<br>
The level of the foamed slag 15 can be determined in the signal<br>
processing device 8 with the aid of a transfer function of the<br>
structure-borne noise in the electric arc furnace. The<br>
transfer function characterizes the transfer path 17,<br>
schematically indicated in Figure 2, of the structure-borne<br>
noise from excitation to detection.<br>
The excitation of the structure-borne noise takes place by the<br>
power feed at the electrodes 3, 3a, 3b, 3c in the arc 18. The<br>
structure-borne noise, i.e. the oscillations caused by the<br>
excitation, are transferred through the liquid steel bath 16<br>
and/or through the foamed slag 15 that at least partially<br>
covers the steel bath 16 to the wall 2 of the electric arc<br>
furnace. A transfer of structure-borne noise may additionally<br>
also take place, at least partially, through not yet melted<br>
food material in the electric arc furnace. The detection of<br>
the structure-borne noise takes place by structure-borne noise<br>
sensors 4, 4a, 4b, 4c, which are arranged on the wall 2 of the<br>
furnace casing 1 of the electric arc furnace. The structure-<br>
borne noise sensors 4, 4a, 4b, 4c pick up oscillations on the<br>
walls 2 of the furnace<br><br>

2005P11628WOUS<br>
casing 1. The structure-borne noise sensors 4, 4a, 4b, 4c are<br>
preferably formed as acceleration sensors. The structure-borne<br>
noise sensors 4, 4a, 4b, 4c are preferably provided above the<br>
foamed slag zone. Structure-borne noise sensors 4, 4a, 4b, 4c<br>
are preferably arranged on the opposite sides of the electrodes<br>
3, 3a, 3b, 3c on the wall 2 of the electric arc furnace.<br>
The electric sensors 13a, 13b, 13c sense current and/or voltage<br>
signals of the electrodes 3, 3a, 3b, 3c. Current and/or<br>
voltage signals are preferably sensed in a time-resolved<br>
manner. The signals of the structure-borne noise sensors are<br>
led by way of protected lines 5, 5a, 5b, 5c into an optical<br>
device 6 (see Figure 1). The optical device 6 is preferably<br>
arranged relatively close to the actual electric arc furnace.<br>
The optical device 6 serves for amplifying and converting the<br>
signals of the structure-borne noise sensors 4, 4a, 4b, 4c. In<br>
the optical device 6, the signals are converted into optical<br>
signals and are passed by way of an optical waveguide 7 free<br>
from interference over comparatively longer distances, for<br>
example 50 to 200 m, into a signal processing device 8.<br>
In the signal processing device 8, signals are sensed and<br>
evaluated. In the signal processing device 8, the signals are<br>
preferably digitized at an adequately high sampling rate, for<br>
example 6000 samples/second. The excitation signals of the<br>
electrodes 3, 3a, 3b, 3c are preferably formed by<br>
multiplication of the associated current signals and/or<br>
associated voltage signals. The output signals form the<br>
structure-borne noise signals. The following applies here to<br>
the signals in the time domain:<br>
(1) Y(t)-h(t) ° X(t) ,<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/064156	- 11 -<br>
2005P11628WOUS<br>
where Y(t,) denotes a structure-borne noise signal, X(t) denotes<br>
the power feed in the arc 18 and h(t) denotes the step<br>
response. The variables h(t) and X(t) are linked to one<br>
another by a convolution operator.<br>
The transfer function H(ω) is determined in the frequency<br>
domain:<br>
(II) y(ω)=H(ω).x(ω) ,<br>
where x (Ω) and y(ω) are the Fourier transforms of the<br>
excitation and output signals.<br>
The variables x (Ω) , y(ω) and H(Ω) are complex. To avoid<br>
complex division, H(Ω) is calculated by way of the cross-power<br>
spectrum:<br>
(III) |H(ω) | = |Wxy(ω) |/Wxx(ω) ,<br>
where WXY(Ω) denotes the cross-power spectrum and Wxx denotes<br>
the power spectrum at the input, i.e. on the side of the<br>
excitation.<br>
The transfer function H(Ω) is only determined at discrete<br>
frequencies, the discrete frequencies being multiples<br>
(harmonics) of the fundamental frequency of the power supply to<br>
the electrodes 3, 3a, 3b, 3c, since the excitation only takes<br>
place by way of the fundamental wave and the harmonic waves of<br>
the coupled power. In the case of a power supply device 12 for<br>
the electric arc furnace that operates for example at 50 Hz,<br>
the discrete frequencies are multiples of 100 Hz.<br>
The transfer function H(ω) characterizes the medium in the<br>
electric arc furnace. Therefore, the variation of the medium<br>
over time, for example the level of the foamed slag 15, can be<br>
determined by the change in the transfer function.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/064156 - 12 -<br>
2005P11628WOUS<br>
The attenuation or amplification of the transfer function<br>
values can be used to calculate a resultant value that<br>
correlates with the level of the foamed slag 15. This has been<br>
confirmed in measuring experiments with a time resolution of<br>
about 1 to 2 seconds.<br>
The evaluation in the signal processing device 8 may be adapted<br>
with the aid of empirical values from the operation of the<br>
electric arc furnace. The signal sensing and evaluation and<br>
the slag determination are performed online during operation,<br>
so that the state signal that characterizes the slag level in<br>
the electric arc. furnace can be used for automatically<br>
regulating the process. The improved knowledge of the foamed<br>
slag process, improved by the measuring techniques according to<br>
the invention, makes improved process control and regulation<br>
possible, leading to the following advantages:<br>
-	Increase in productivity through higher specific smelting<br>
capacity by reducing the downtimes caused in particular by<br>
furnace repairs.<br>
-	Reduction in the specific smelting energy while maintaining a<br>
constant, tapping temperature.<br>
-	Reduction in the wearing of the wall by reducing the radiant<br>
energy to the inner wall of the furnace casing 1.<br>
- Reduction in electrode consumption.<br>
A concept that is important for the invention can be summarized<br>
as follows:<br>
The invention relates to a method for determining a state<br>
variable of an electric arc furnace, in particular for<br>
determining the level of the foamed slag 15 in an electric arc<br>
furnace, wherein the energy supplied to the electric arc<br>
furnace is determined with the aid of at least one electric<br>
sensor 13a, 13b, 13c and wherein structure-borne noise in the<br>
form of oscillations on the electric arc furnace is measured,<br>
the at least one<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/064156	- 13 -<br>
2005Pl1628WOUS<br>
state variable, in particular the level of the foamed slag 1b,<br>
being determined with the aid of a transfer function which is<br>
determined by evaluating the measured oscillations, i.e. the<br>
structure-borne noise, and by evaluating measured data of the<br>
at Least one electric sensor 13a, 13b, 13c. The state of the<br>
level of the foamed slag 15 is in this way reliably defected<br>
and monitored over time. The level of the foamed slag 15 is<br>
decisive for the effectiveness with which energy is introduced<br>
into the electric arc furnace. Moreover, losses through<br>
radiation are reduced by covering the arc 18 with the foamed<br>
slag lb. The improved measuring method makes it possible for<br>
the level of the foamed slag to be automatically controlled or<br>
regulated in a reliable manner.<br><br>

the level of the foamed slag (15) in an electric arc furnace. According to said method, the energy supplied to the electric arc<br>
furnace is determined with the aid of at least one electric sensor (13a, 13b, 13c) while solid-borne noise is measured in the form of<br>
oscillations on the electric arc furnace. The at least one state variable, particularly the level of the foamed slag (15), is determined by<br>
means of a transfer function which is determined by evaluating the measured oscillations, i.e. the solid-borne noise, and evaluating<br>
measured data of the at least one electric sensor (13a, 13b, 13c). The state of the level of the foamed slag (15) can thus be reliably<br>
recognized and be monitored over time. The level of the foamed slag (15) is decisive for the effectiveness with which energy is fed<br>
into the electric arc furnace. Furthermore, losses caused by radiation are reduced by covering the arc (18) with the foamed slag (15).<br>
The improved measuring method allows the level of the foamed slag to be automatically controlled or regulated in a reliable manner.</td>
