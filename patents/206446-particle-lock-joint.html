COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13] "PARTICLE LOCK JOINT"<br><br>
902/MUMNP/2003<br>
       23/09/03<br><br>
THE GATES CORPORATION, a corporation organised under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, of 900 South Broadway, Denver, Colorado 80209, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a method of making a joint.<br>
The invention relates to joints, and more particularly to joints comprising particles that mechanically interlock adjoining surfaces.<br>
■Background of the Invention It is well  known in the mechanical  arts that many methods are available to join or connect  one part to another.    These methods  range  from use .of a  chemical adhesive to welding.<br>
Chemical adhesives generally adhere two surfaces by chemical interaction with the body materials. The joints can be of great strength and durability. The problem is that there are attendant environmental issues that arise .with chemical adhesives, including storage, use and disposal of the adhesives. Further, they are often a health hazard to humans if used improperly. Chemical adhesives are primarily used on non-metallic materials, such as plastics and composites.<br>
A welded joint is the primary means of joining metallic components. For example, electrical arc welding .momentarily liquefies a portion of the bodies to be joined. The molten metal, in combination with metal from a welding rod, then solidifies to join the metallic bodies at a molecular level. The problem here is that some skill is required to weld properly.   Further, high electrical currents, voltages and<br><br>
temperatures are necessary to liquefy the materials to be joined.<br>
In addition to adhesives and welding, another 'non-fastener' option is the galled joint. Galling is a process 5 by which two bodies may be joined as a result of high levels of friction evenly disrupting the relevant surfaces causing controlled transfer of surface material from one body to another' to produce an array of mechanically meshing recesses and protrusions that couple together and interlock to resist 10  further lateral motion.<br>
Representative of the art is U.S. Pat. No. 5,348,210 to Linzell(1994) which discloses a method of making galled joints by asperity deformation using a material between the members leading to welding on a molecular level but not 15 sufficient to raise a temperature to a level where bulk welding will occur.<br>
Also representative of the art is U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,066 to Linzell(1998) which discloses a method of making galled joints between two metal joints in which there 20 are gaps prior to formation which comprises a composition comprises small metal particles combined with a gall enhancing material.<br>
The galling method teaches use of a gall-enhancing material' or composition that facilitates the galling 25 process. The gall-enhancing material generally comprises a polysiloxane, which increases the friction between the members to be joined. Further, the joints rely upon a precise manner of combining the members to allow the galled joint to be properly formed, including controlling 30 clearances, alignment and joint forming velocity. In addition, the joints disclosed in '210 specifically teach against the use of grit in the joint. On the other hand,<br><br>
'066 does teach the use of particles in the joint, however, the particles  are used to promote  galling between the surfaces  and  are  used  in  concert  with  gall-enhancing material,  namely polymethylsiloxane,  to  create  a  gall-5  enhancing composition. Also,  the particles are generally equiaxed,  meaning each is  substantially the same  in 3 dimensions, such as a sphere, or a cube or any irregular shape. This promotes joining of parts having substantially the same hardness, i.e., metal parts.  However, the methods 10' do not lend themselves to joining parts having a substantial difference in hardness, such as a plastic and metal. In particular, when one part is an elastomer, and the other part is metal, then the equiaxed particles can penetrate the relatively soft elastomer and disappear in them. 15       What is needed is a particle joint comprising particles that mechanically interlock adjoining surfaces.   What is needed is a particle joint comprising particles having a substantially flat shape. The present invention meets these needs. 20<br>
Summary of the Invention The primary aspect of the present invention is to provide a particle joint comprising particles that mechanically interlock adjoining surfaces. 25 Another aspect of the invention is to provide a particle joint comprising particles having a substantially flat shape.<br>
Other aspects of the invention will be pointed out or made apparent by the following description of the invention 30  and the accompanying drawings.<br>
The invention comprises a joint formed by mechanical interaction of particles with the parts to be joined.  The<br><br>
particles engage an interface surface of each part, creating a high friction condition that prevents further relative movement of the parts once they are assembled. The particles have a substantially flat or flake-like morphology. The 5 surface of each particle is rough to enhance mechanical engagement with each interface surface. The flake-like shape prevents the particle from penetrating an elastomeric part, which would render the particle ineffective in the bonding process. 10<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in<br>
and form a part of the specification, illustrate preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, and together with a<br>
15  description,  serve  to  explain  the  principles  of  the<br>
invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a cross-section of a gap between two parts being joined.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of a particle flake. 20  Fig. 3 is a side view of a particle flake.<br><br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiment of the Invention Fig. 1 shows a cross-section of a gap between two parts being joined.   The joint is generally between two or more concentric  components ' having  a  press  fit.  A  metallic material 100 and a non-metallic material 200 are shown in cross-section.   Non-metallic material 200 may comprise an elastomer or any other material having a hardness less than the  metallic ■ material  100.    Particles  101  engage  each, interface surface 103 and 104.  Surface roughness 102, see Fig, 3, enhances the engagement of each particle with the interface surfaces.<br>
The joint is shown having gaps Gl and G2 between the surfaces.   In the preferred embodiment, gap Gl is in the range of slightly less than the particle thickness in each area. This is due to particle partial  'penetration in the metallic and elastomer material,  particularly since  the elastomer is under compression. The gap G2 is zero in those areas where there are no particles.  As later described in this  specification,  it  is  also possible  to • create  an interference fit between the metallic part and the non-metallic part. The non-metallic part may also- comprise an elastomeric having a tensile.-modulus .in the case of a rotation part such as a pulley,  use of the elastomeric allows a rotating part to perform a damping function.<br>
The particles have a morphology of one plane being much larger than the others,  i.e.,  a flake shape, with rough surfaces as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. What this does is allow the particle to mechanically "lock" to both surfaces without penetrating and ^disappearing' into the elastomer. The  relatively  large  area  of  each  particle  prevents localized  high  pressures  causing  each  particle  to  cut through the elastomer and penetrate in it.  However,  some<br><br>
slight amount of penetration of the particles into the elastomeric is acceptable. The particles may also score the interface surfaces during assembly which serves to enhance the mechanical engagement and further increase the friction 5  between the surfaces.<br>
Particles are made by several different processes, including from molten material, from solids, or by chemical reactions. When fabricated from molten material, a molten alloy (harder than the metallic part or the elastomer) is 10 made into powder by atomization (blowing a high pressure inert gas such as argon into a stream of molten alloy) or by melt extraction.<br>
In atomization, the number of nuzzles, their direction, plus volume, temperature, and pressure of the gas • determines 15 the size, and the shape of the particles. For particles larger than a few microns, it would also be possible to make equiaxed particles with atomization and subsequently send them through cylindrical rollers with rough surfaces. Millions of tons of powder from different materials - are made 20 each year by atomization for powder metal industry, drug and food industries.<br>
For melt extraction, a wheel made of high temperature resistant alloy rotates on the surface of a bath of molten metal, touching the surface resulting the solidification of 25 a very narrow amount of the metal on the wheel. As the wheel turns, the solidified material is blown away on the upper side of the wheel by ah inert gas. The shape of the wheel and the depth of its penetration in the molten metal bath, determines the shape of particles. A rough wheel touching 30  the bath very slightly will make flaky rough particles.<br>
Mechanical methods of crushing and grinding are used more for ceramics and abrasives, such as what is used in<br><br>
sandpaper and construction industry. The particle shape from a mechanical crusher depends on the direction of forces (ball mill vs. parallel moving crushers), and the crystalline or amorphous (noncrystalline) structure of the 5 mineral. Bonding between the atoms of a crystal is much stronger in some directions than others, resulting in crystal dependent particle shapes.<br>
In'the preferred embodiment, atomization with adjusted nuz2les is used to create the proper shape from an alloy 10 steel, for example, D2,, a tool steel that has high hardness and good wear resistance. High hardness is obtained by heat treating the material. The temperature of the gas blowing on the molten alloy does the heat treating.<br>
The particles so created have a flake shape, see Fig. 15 2. As described previously, each flake 101 has a substantially flat surface. In order to facilitate joining between metallic 100 and non-metallic 200 parts, the surface of each flake has a surface roughness 102 for mechanically engaging each interface surfaces, 103 and 104. In the 20 preferred embodiment, each flake has a mean diameter of 1 to 1000 microns.<br>
Assembly of a Joint.<br>
The parts to be joined are first aligned in a jig or press to allow one part to be pressed into another. The 25 particles are applied to the surfaces to be joined. They may be applied by pneumatic application or by use of a lubricant that facilitates the assembly process. In the preferred embodiment the particles are combined with a lubricant to enhance the initial sliding engagement during 30  assembly.<br>
The parts are then pressed together.    During  the pressing  process  the  particles  engage  each  adjoining<br><br>
interface surface. In the preferred embodiment a metallic material 100 is joined to a non-metallic material 200, such as an elastomeric. The non-metallic material is fabricated having a diameter or width slightly greater than the slot 5 into which it is pressed by a factor of 5 to 45%, i.e., an interference fit. This allows the non-metallic material to be compressed between the metallic parts.<br>
Even though the description is in . terms of a cylindrical fit between parts, the method may be applied to 10 "any form of joint whereby a surface is held in pressing contact with another to which it is joined. Further the method may be applied to a wide range of joint shapes, including curved and staggered.<br>
Although a  single form of the invention, has been<br>
15  described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the<br>
art that variations may be made in the construction and<br>
relation of parts without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention described herein.<br>
