				<td>1.0 Field of invention<br>
This invention relates to a method of land application system for the safe disposal and<br>
treatment of coke plant effluent. More particularly, it relates to a novel method of testing of<br>
land treatment system of wastewater by applying it for irrigation without causing adverse<br>
effect on soil characteristics, ground water quality and surface runoff.<br>
2.0 Background of invention<br>
Wastewater is a misplaced resource and can be reused advantageously for harvesting<br>
crops through proper management. A differentiation can be made between water reuse and<br>
recycling. Reuse implies utilization of water that has been previously used for another purpose,<br>
and recycling implies reuse of water more than once for that same purpose. The approaches in<br>
wastewater management essentially entail waste volume reduction, waste strength reduction<br>
and byproduct recovery. There are a number of coke plants in operation in the vicinity of<br>
Jharia Coalfield (JCF). Liquid effluents generated during the process operations are highly<br>
polluted and difficult to handle. The importance of coal carbonizing industries from the Indian<br>
national point of view is great and growing . It is producing gas and also producing coke for<br>
metallurgical purposes, and other byproducts, which are responsible for entire supplies of<br>
benzene, toluene, anthracene and naphthalene and coal tar products, which constitute the raw<br>
materials for the manufacture of synthetic dyes, drugs and high explosives.<br>
In coke ovens, naturally found coal is converted into coke which is suitable for use<br>
in metal industries especially in iron and steel for blast furnaces, foundries and for domestic<br>
purpose. Coal is transformed by carbonization into a hard, porous mass, devoid of volatile<br>
matter called coke, Coking process essentially consists of heating of coal (pyrolysis) in the<br>
absence of air or with limited oxidant, it decomposes to coke, liquid products and gases.<br>
Coking coals are distinguished by the fact that they begin to soften at about 300° C. As the<br>
temperature rises, the fluidity of the mass reaches a maximum and finally the mass solidifies to<br>
form coke . The gases and vapors evolved during the plastic stage swells the mass, causing the<br>
coke to have a hard porous structure . Non-coking coal does not soften during heating and<br>
products known as char, crumbs easily. The production of the coke consists of heating<br>
bituminous coal in absence of air to final temperatures of 900° to 1100 °C in an oven or a<br>
report, driving of volatile products that are recovered as tar, light oil and gas .<br>
Several grades of coals are blended, crushed to about 50 mesh and transferred to a<br>
storage bin for charging. The coking operation is carried out in a battery of 10 to 100<br><br>
individual ovens designed to provide relatively uniform production of finished products and to<br>
recover heat in a way that minimizes the fuel requirements. During the coking period, the coke<br>
oven gas is collected through ascension pipe at the top of the oven, scrubbed in the gas<br>
collecting main with weak ammonia liquor to remove tar, and discharged to the by product<br>
recovery operation. At the completion of coking, the oven is isolated from the gas main and the<br>
incandescent coke is pushed into rail cars for prompt transfer to a quenching tower . Here,<br>
quench water showers the coke to cool it and prevent further loss by combustion,<br>
Large quantities of water are used for the quenching of hot coke and also for washing<br>
gas produced from ovens. Effluents generated from quenching of coke mainly contain<br>
suspended matter of coke breeze. Water used for washing gas comes out as strong ammonical<br>
liqueur, which contains high concentrations of ammonia, phenol, cyanide and other toxic<br>
substances. These effluents are finally discharged into the river stream and causing serious<br>
pollution to surface waters<br>
The wastewater produced during the carbonization and classification of fuel is of three<br>
basic types<br>
a)	Water used for quenching the coke discharged from the retorts or ovens.<br>
b)	Waste formed during cooling and washing the gas.<br>
c)	Waste formed during the purification of byproducts.<br>
Large amounts of water are used when the gas is washed but if it is only slightly<br>
contaminated it may be recycled. The most heavily polluted liquors from the coke plants are<br>
the washings from the ammonia stills, where the condensate from the gas coolers accumulates.<br>
It contains ammonia, phenol, cyanide, sulphide that are toxic to aquatic life. The insoluble<br>
pollutants, especially tar, form a surface layer that hinders the access of oxygen from air. Large<br>
particles of suspended matter settle on the bed of the stream and cause further pollution . Fine<br>
suspended particles clog the respiratory organs of fish, making it impossible for them to live in<br>
such a stream. If there is insufficient dilution, thiocyanates, free lime and pyridine may also<br>
cause serious difficulties. Much of the dissolved oxygen is consumed by sulphur compounds,<br>
mainly sulphides which also have direct harmful effects on fish life depending on temperature,<br>
pH and dissolved oxygen. Unless removed from the effluent, oil and grease lead to the<br>
formation of oil slicks, which limit the diffusion of oxygen from air into water. A fact-finding<br>
survey is essential to for the safe disposal of wastewater<br>
3.0 Drawback associated with the known art<br>
Chemical treatment methods are costly. In some old coke plants, where sufficient<br>
space is not available for making biological treatment, this system will solve the problem. Land<br><br>
disposal for treatment of effluents is cheap and does not require an expensive wastewater<br>
treatment plant, and not requiring high initial maintenance cost . It would give a very good<br>
nutrient removal from wastewater for raising useful crops in the region and the cost of fertilizer<br>
can be minimized. It will be economical as the available irrigation is limited in the area. Water<br>
of irrigation cannel can be saved by this system. Recycling the wastewater for irrigation can<br>
recharge ground water table.<br>
The agricultural potential of the coke plant effluent has not been considered in India.<br>
These effluents are rich in nutrients and could be useful in irrigated agriculture. Land disposal<br>
could abate surface water pollution due coke plant effluents , and has the potential for nutrient<br>
removal from the effluents, and thereby enhancing agricultural production, and at the same<br>
time, providing primary, secondary, and tertiary effluent treatment. This system will not only<br>
control the surface water pollution but also maintain the ecological balance of the ground<br>
water. The challenge is to utilize the chemical, physical, and biological properties of soil as an<br>
acceptor of the wastewater, with minimum unwanted effects to the crops to be grown, to the<br>
characteristics of the soil, and to the quality of ground water and surface water runoff. Under<br>
controlled application rates of wastewater it is also possible to maintain aerobic conditions<br>
within the soil. But no systematic study has been reported to evaluate how much land area can<br>
be irrigated safely with control application of wastewater, which will not affect the ground<br>
water quality and maintain the aerobic condition in the soil.A wellguided research is essential<br>
in this regard.<br>
4.0 Object of invention<br>
Activated sludge process being used in a number of large coke plants is not found to be<br>
successful. This may be due to the presence toxic cyanide in coke plant effluent, which is<br>
responsible for the killing of the useful microorganisms. In the activated sludge process, the<br>
bacteria are the most important microorganisms, because they are responsible for the<br>
decomposition of the organic material in the influent. In the reactor, a portion of the organic<br>
wastewater is used by the aerobic and facultative bacteria to obtain energy for the synthesis of<br>
the remainder of the organic material into new cells.. Further, while it is important that bacteria<br>
decompose the organic waste as quickly as possible, it is also important that they form a<br>
satisfactory flock, which is a prerequisite for the effective separation of the biological solids in<br>
the settling unit. Experience shows that the flock formation subsides after certain period of<br>
time for this reason land application of coke plant effluent may be considered as a suitable<br>
option for its treatment.<br><br>
Land treatment of wastewater includes the use of plants, land surface and soil matrix to<br>
remove the various constituents in wastewater by physical, chemical and biological means.<br>
When the wastewater is evenly spreaded on the surface of the land, it percolates into the<br>
ground and the suspended solids remain on the surface of the ground. The organic suspended<br>
solids are partly acted upon by bacteria and are partly oxidized by the atmospheric action of<br>
heat, light and air. Soil organisms convert the contents of wastewater into plant food and the<br>
roots of crops utilize the food. Decomposition of organic matter of wastewater may occur<br>
under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Oxygen required for the aerobic process is present in<br>
different layers of the soil.. Carbon dioxide, which is produced in the process of<br>
decomposition, is given up by the soil and in return the atmospheric oxygen, is absorbed by it.<br>
The interchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide may take place in different ways such as as<br>
wind movements, differences in temperature and pressure of the soil etc.<br>
Irrigation, the predominant land treatment process, involves the application of<br>
wastewater to the land for its treatment and for meeting the growth needs of plants. Effluent<br>
can be applied to crops or vegetation either by sprinkling or by surface techniques. System<br>
objectives are:<br>
•	Ground water recharge<br>
•	Natural treatment followed by pumped withdrawal or by under drains for recovery and<br>
•	Natural treatment with renovated water moving vertically and laterally into the soil.<br>
The capability of land treatment systems to remove organic matter, nitrogen,<br>
phosphorous , exchangeable cations, trace elements and microorganisms from applied<br>
wastewater depends on a variety of factors. For organic the soil is a highly efficient biological<br>
treatment systems. Organic matter is filtered by grass, liter and topsoil and is reduced by<br>
biological oxidation. Nitrogen can be removed by crop uptake and by denitrification. The<br>
major phosphorous removal process is chemical precipitation and adsorption, although plants<br>
do take up some amounts. Retention of trace metals especially heavy metals in the soil matrix<br>
occurs mainly through sorption and ion exchange. Bacterial removal mechanisms common to<br>
most methods of land treatment include straining, die-off, sedimentation, entrapment and<br>
adsorption. The object of this invention is to design method of testing to evaluate how much<br>
land area can be irrigated safely with control application of wastewater, which will not affect<br>
the ground water quality and maintain the aerobic condition in the soil.<br>
5.0 A summary of invention<br><br>
Coke plant effluents are one of the major contributors to the pollution of the river<br>
Damodar, effluent generated from coke plant contain high suspended matter of coke breeze,<br>
high BOD, COD, ammonia, phenol and other toxic substances. Effluents from coke plants are<br>
rich in nutrients and can be useful in irrigated agriculture. There are a number of coke plants in<br>
operation in the vicinity of Jharia Coal field (JCF).. Chemical treatment methods are costly. In<br>
some old coke plants, where sufficient space is not available for making biological treatment,<br>
land application system of wastewater for irrigation will solve the problem. Land disposal for<br>

S.2 Methods<br>
Effluent samples from the coke plant were collected each week on Monday and Friday .<br>
Since phenols were present in the wastewater, the samples were preserved and stored unless<br>
they were analyzed within 4 h after collection . It was acidified with H3PO4 to a pH of 4. One<br>
gram of CuSO4/l was added to inhibit biodegradation of phenol. The samples were kept at 4<br>
°C. Samples were preserved for COD by adding 2 ml/1 of H2SO4 and for BOD samples were<br>
refrigerated at 4 °C. All the water quality parameters were determined following methods given<br>
in Standard Methods by American Public Health Association. Temperature, pH and DO<br>
measurements were carried out at site immediately after the collection of samples. Total<br>
dissolved solids (TDS) were measured gravimetrically using precision balance, make Metier,<br>
model-AE 240. pH of the samples were measured by pH meter. Dissolve oxygen (DO) was<br>
measured by Winkler's method. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) was measured by<br>
determining the quantity of oxygen utilized by suitable aquatic microorganisms during a five-<br>
day period Ammonia was measured spectrophotometrically with the use of Nessler's reagent.<br>
Nitrate ion was first reduced to nitrite and determined spectrophotometrically by a<br>
diazotization method. Cyanide ion was first reacted with chloramine-T, which formed a blue<br>
dye with pyridine pyrazolene reagent and determined spectrophotometrically. Hardness was<br>
measured by complex metric titration using EDTA as titrant and EBT as an indicator. Ca and<br>
Mg hardness were determined by using mureoxide indicator. Chloride content was estimated<br>
by argentometric titration using standard silver nitrate as a titrant and potassium chromate as an<br>
indicator. Oil and grease were estimated with the use of soxhlet extraction method. Chemical<br>
oxygen demand (COD) was determined following open reflux method using ferrous<br>
ammonium sulfate as a titrant and ferroin as an indicator. Sodium and potassium content were<br>
measured by flame photometer, make-AMIL. Phenol was reacted with 4-aminoantipyrine in<br>
presence of potassium ferricyanide, extracted into chloroform and measured at 460 nm.<br>
Characteristics of the effluent from coke plant are given Table 1.<br><br><br>
Note: All parameters except pH are expressed in mg/1 unless otherwise noted<br>
5.3 Results<br>
The pH of the effluent was found to be slightly alkaline in nature. The dissolved oxygen<br>
(DO) was found to range from 1.42 to 3.17 with an average of 2.39 mg/1. COD value of the<br>
effluent was also found to exceed the permissible limit of 250 mg/1 as per IS 2490 due the<br>
presence of suspended solids of coal fines and organic matter. High value of BOD showed the<br><br>
presence of biodegradable substances . The aerobic decomposition of organic matter takes<br>
dissolved oxygen from the river water and is responsible for depletion of DO. Average oil and<br>
grease content of the effluent was found to be 19.61 mg/l. Increase of dissolved solid content<br>
observed in comparison to the raw water indicates contamination of inorganic salts. Suspended<br>
solids in the effluent were found to be very high ranging from 1521 mg/l to 2031 mg/l as<br>
compared to the tolerance limit of 100 mg/l. Ammonical nitrogen was contaminated during the<br>
extraction of coal tar from the coke oven gas ammonical nitrogen. Contamination with nitrate<br>
nitrogen, phenolic compounds cyanides and hardness was also observed.<br>
5.4 Discussion<br>
Coke plant effluent contains a large amount of suspended solids. After quenching of<br>
coke a large quantity of effluent is generated, which mainly contains suspended coke breeze.<br>
Settling tanks have been provided for the settlement of suspended solid but it was observed<br>
that the numbers were not adequate and sufficient retention time for the separation of TSS was<br>
not maintained. So a large amount of coke breeze is being lost every day along with the<br>
effluent. This showed the ineffectiveness of the present effluent treatment system. At the<br>
discharge point, the river water has a taken black color look due to the deposition of coke<br>
breezes. So, in addition to the surface water pollution and siltation on the riverbed a huge<br>
quantity of costly coke breeze is being lost every day . High BOD, COD, phenol content of<br>
effluent are causing serious surface water pollution. The test result reveals that proper<br>
treatment of the effluent is needed before discharging to surface water bodies.<br>
6.0 Design of lysimeter test<br>
High organic loadings may create anaerobic conditions in the soil matrix and result in the<br>
production of odors. Due to the nitrification in the soil matrix, nitrate nitrogen may<br>
contaminate the ground by leaching. Due to the accumulation of trace elements they may<br>
become toxic at higher levels to both plant life and microorganisms. So it is essential to make<br>
pilot study with wastewater to the land where it will be applied as irrigant to evaluate the<br>
flooding rate , which will effect the soil characteristics and ground water quality. In this study<br>
lysimeter test has been designed for the safe disposal of wastewater for harvesting crops. For<br>
this purpose the column lysimeters consisted of three-200cm length having 20cm diameter<br>
PVC pipes were designed. The lysimeters were equipped with three ports of 5-cm diameter, at<br>
30, 90 and 160 cm depth, which were driven inside the lysimeters. One end of each port was<br>
closed with a plug to prevent water from leaving the lysimeter, and the other end was<br>
connected to polythene tube of 1.27cm (1/2 in.) diameter (I.D.) used for collecting the leachate<br>
from each port depth. The top surface of the port was perforated, and just above it with a plug<br><br>
gravel and sand were placed so that leachate could be collected easily through the port as<br>
shown in Figure 1.<br>
Agricultural land near the coke plant was selected for harvesting with wastewater. Soil<br>
was collectedly auguring to a depth of 2m. To obtain samples for use in the lysimeter for a<br>
pilot study , an area of 2mx2m was cleaned of grasses, stones, and other unwanted materials.<br>
The soil was collected from three depths (0-30cm, 30-90cm, and 90-10cm) and placed in clean<br>
plastic bags after mixing. Disturber and un disturbed soil samples were also collected for<br>
physico-chemical analysis. The collected soil samples were carefully placed and compacted<br>
layer wise to simulate original in-situ condition pertaining to stratification and density.<br>
Raw effluents from coke plant were introduced to lysimeter No.l. In lysimeter No. 2,<br>
diluted effluents of the coke plants were introduced. In lysimeter No. 3 (blank), only distilled<br>
water were used. There were two irrigations per week in each lysimeter, with 5cm flooding at<br>
each irrigation, and the quantity of raw effluent added each time was noted. The irrigation was<br>
continued for three months. The leachates from 1 and 2 were collected and analyzed to assess<br>
the impact of wastewater on ground water quality. Then the soils from different layers in each<br>
lysimeter were analyzed to assess the impact soil quality due to the disposal of coke plant<br>
effluent.<br>
7.0 Description of the accompanying drawing<br>
The leachate of the bottom port of lysimeter No.l contained oil and grease in amounts<br>
ranging from 0.02mg/l to 0.09mg/l, with an average of value of 0.06mg/l (Figure 1). For<br>
drinking water, oil and grease should be absent according to IS: 10,500. Total dissolved solids<br>
with an average value of 541.27mg/l, also slightly exceeded the tolerance limit of 500mg/l. For<br>
nitrate nitrogen, the value was even higher from the raw effluent value, possibly because of<br>
conversion of ammonia to nitrate by the nitrification process. The percentage of organic matter<br>
in the soil of lysimeter No.l was more than in lysimeter No.3. The water holding capacity was<br>
also increased due the increase of organic matter . The leaching losses of available nitrogen<br>
from lysimeter No.l were less than those from lysimeter No.3. Only very small amounts of<br>
phosphorous were lost from the soil. There were larger losses of potassium but less from<br>
lysimeter No.l than from the other two. The soil pH increased within each lysimeter, but<br>
electrical conductivity decreased with depth due to the decrease of soluble salt. The cation<br>
exchange capacity of soil at various depths was found to decrease. Trace metals such as zinc<br>
and lead were found to decrease to a lesser extent.<br>
The experiment with lysimeter No. 2 was performed with diluted effluents to see how<br>
much this would decrease in contamination of ground water by oil and grease, high total<br><br>
dissolved solids (TDS), and nitrate nitrogen. When the dilution ratio was increased to 1:1 (one<br>
part of water and one part of raw effluent), the leachate from the bottom port was found to be<br>
within the tolerance limit.. TDS was in the range of 465.21-471.59mg/l, with an average of<br>
467.55mg/l. Nitrate nitrogen was in the range of 34.09-37.27mg/l , with an average of<br>
35.85mg/l. The use of land surface and soil matrix to remove various constituents in<br>
wastewater by land application is called a living filter system. The column lysimeter may be<br>
considered as a living filter . The renovation efficiency of living filter (RELF) may be<br>
expressed as<br><br>
Where OIC is the original irrigant constituent in mg/l and CCL is the concentration of<br>
the constituent in leachate in mg/l.<br>
The RELF at the bottom port of the lysimeter No.2 for COD was found to be 86.92%, for<br>
TDS 53.22% and for oil and grease 99.37%, calculated on the basis of quantity of effluent<br>
applied in lysimeter No. 2 for a period of three months (39Lit.) and on the average quantity of<br>
wastewater discharged by the coke plant(l 88m3 /d). It was also calculated that 12,400m3 /ha of<br>
effluent can be applied within a period of three months and about 2.73 ha of land can be<br>
irrigated with the wastewater produced from the coke plant effluent.<br><br>
claim<br>
1.	Method of land treatment by waste water from coke plant effluent, comprising the<br>
steps of<br>
a.) determination of physicochemical characteristics and agricultural potential of the<br>
effluent quantity<br>
b)collection of soils layer wise from the agricultural land to be irrigated<br>
c)preparation of column lysimeters by putting the collected soil layer wise<br>
d)	application of said wastewater as coke plant effluent to the said lysimeter by flooding<br>
e)	collecting the leachate from different ports of the lysimeters and analysis of the leachate<br>
thus collected to determine the impact of wastewater on ground water quality and surface<br>
runoff<br>
f )analysis of soils from the lysimeters after the completion of the irrigation period to<br>
determine the impact of wastewater on the soil quality,<br>
wherein,<br>
said preparation of column lysimeters consist of three lysimeters of 200cm long and 20cm<br>
diameter PVC pipes, equipped with three ports of 5-cm diameter, at 30cm , 90cm and 160<br>
cm depth of the said lysimeter respectively, said ports consists of pipes cross sectionally<br>
driven inside the lysimeter, one end of each port kept closed with a plug to prevent water<br>
from leaving the lysimeter, the other end of each port is connected to polythene tube of<br>
1.27cm internal diameter for collecting the leachate from each port at said different depths ,<br>
the top surface of the pipes of the port is configured as perforated with gravel and sand<br>
placed above the port so that leachate can be collected easily through the port.<br>
2.	Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein a pilot study is conducted with the application<br>
of wastewater to the land where it is to be applied as irrigant and the flooding rate of<br>
the effluent is determined which will not adversely effect the soil characteristics,<br>
ground water quality and surface runoff.<br>
3.	Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein soils are collected from three depths(0-30cm,<br>
30-90cm, and 90-10cm) from the agricultural land to be irrigated for raising crops with<br>
the wastewater and the soils placed layerwise and copmacted carefully to simulate the<br>
original land pertaining to startification and density .<br>
4.	Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein effluent samples collected from the plant are<br>
introduced to lysimeter No.1 (raw effluent), in lysimeter Mo. 2 ( diluted effluent), in<br>
lysimeter No. 3 (blank, plain water) with two irrigations per week in each lysimeter,<br><br>
with 5cm flooding at each irrigation , and the quantity of raw effluent added each time<br>
has been noted and the irrigation has been continued for three months.<br>
5.	Method as claimed in claim 4, wherein leachates from lysimeter No. 1 and 2 are<br>
collected and analyzed to determine the impact of wastewater on ground water quality<br>
6.	Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein soil samples from different layers of the<br>
lysimeters are analyzed to determine the impact on soil quality due to the disposal of<br>
coke plant effluent and the area of land can be irrigated without any adverse affect on<br>
soil and ground water quality.<br><br>
Reuse of wastewater for irrigation can be considered as a suitable option for raising<br>
useful crops in the region. When the wastewater is evenly spreaded on the surface of the land,<br>
it percolates into the ground and the suspended solids remain on the surface of the ground. The<br>
challenge is to utilize the chemical, physical, and biological properties of soil as an acceptor of<br>
the wastewater, with minimum unwanted effects to the crops to be grown, to the characteristics<br>
of the soil, and to the quality of ground water and surface water runoff. This invention relates<br>
to a novel method of testing of land treatment system of wastewater by applying on land for<br>
irrigation without having any adverse effect on soil and ground water quality. It determines the<br>
suitability of land treatment of wastewater for the abatement of surface water pollution,<br>
potentiality of nutrient uptake by crops from wastewater, thereby enhancing agricultural<br>
production. It also relates on the recharging of ground water through recycling this way. A<br>
pilot study has been conducted by designing column lysimeter with soils colleted from the<br>
nearby agricultural land, which can be irrigated. The study reveals that under controlled<br>
application rates of wastewater, it is possible to maintain aerobic conditions within the soil and<br>
lysimeter test gives an idea of how much area can be irrigated safely without adversely<br>
affecting land and ground water quality. It is claimed that the process may be considered as a<br>
low cost technology and as a suitable option for the treatment of wastewater and for<br>
developing rural economy and life through innovative and effective application of science and<br>
technology.</td>
