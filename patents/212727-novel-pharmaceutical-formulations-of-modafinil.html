				<td>NOVEL PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS OF MODAFINIL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to compositions of modafinil and processes for the preparation thereof. The present invention relates to compositions that include modafinil and one or more diluents, disintegrants, binders and lubricants. The present invention further relates to processes for the preparing a solid dosage form of modafinil by wet mixing modafinil and excipients with water.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Modafinil, C15H15NO2S, also known as 2-(benzhydrylsulfinyl) acetamide, or 2-[(diphenylmethyl) sulfinyl] acetamide, is a synthetic acetamide derivative with wake-promoting activity, the structure of which has been described in French Patent No. 78 05 510 and in U.S. Patent No. 4,177,290 ('290), and which has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Modafinil has been tested for treatment of several behavioral conditions in combination with various agents including apomorphine, amphetamine, reserpine, oxotremorine, hypnotics, yohimbine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, as described in the cited patents. A method of preparation of a racemic mixture is described in the '290 patent and a method of preparation of a levorotatory isomer is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,927,855 (both incorporated herein by reference). The levorotatory isomer is reported to be useful for treatment of hypersomnia, depression, Alzheimer's disease and to have activity towards the symptoms of dementia and loss of memory, especially in the elderly.<br>
The primary pharmacological activity of modafinil is to promote walcefulness. Modafinil promotes wakefulness in rats (Touret et al., 1995; Edgar and Seidel, 1997), cats (Lin et al., 1992), canines (Shelton et al., 1995) and non-human primates (Hernant et al, 1991) as well as in models mimicking clinical situations, such as sleep apnea<br><br>
-2-<br>
(English bulldog sleep disordered breathing model) (Panckeri et al, 1996) and narcolepsy (narcoleptic canine) (Shelton et al, 1995).<br>
Modafinil has also been described as an agent with activity in the central nervous system, and as a useful agent in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (U.S.     Patent No. 5,180,745); in the protection of cerebral tissue from ischemia (U.S. Patent No. 5,391,576); in the treatment of urinary and fecal incontinence (U.S. Patent No. 5,401,776); and in the treatment of sleep apneas and disorders of central origin (U.S. Patent No. 5,612,379). U.S. Patent No. 5,618,845 describes modafinil preparations of a defined particle size less than about 200 microns. In addition, modafinil may be used  in the treatment of eating disorders, or to promote weight gain or stimulate appetite in humans or animals (US Patent Application No. 09/640,824, incorporated herein by reference), or in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or fatigue, especially fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis (US Patent No. 6,346,548, incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Modafinil was known in the art in the form of a therapeutic package, marketed under the name Provigil®. Provigil   is a pharmaceutical product manufactured by Cephalon, Inc. of West Chester, PA and is also marketed by Cephalon, Inc. Provigil® is supplied as tablets containing 100 mg or 200 mg modafinil, with several excipients, including magnesium silicate and talc. In commercial use, modafinil-containing therapeutic packages in the prior art were labeled and otherwise indicated for use in narcolepsy patients.<br>
It is desirable to optimize the formulation of a solid dose form of modafinil, and the methods of their preparation on a commercial scale. In particular, new formulations of modafinil have been discovered which exhibit comparable stability,<br>
dissolution rate, hardness, friability, thickness, disintegration, size and shape, and<br>
© weight variation characteristics to that of Provigil  . Further, it has been discovered<br>
that solid dose forms of modafinil can be prepared, with properties similar to that of<br>
Provigil , without inclusion of magnesium silicate or talc.<br>
In addition, the newly discovered formulations preferably use a minima! number of excipients, and use pharmaceutical grade excipients that are inexpensive, readily available and that facilitate cost-effective manufacture on a commercial scale.<br>
Furthermore, there is a need to improve upon the manufacturing process of the tablet form of modafinil. Improvement in the commercial preparation include minimizing the number of excipients, eliminating the use of organic solvents, reducing<br><br>
-3-<br>
the number of steps, and reducing the time and expense of manufacture. The present invention is directed to these, as well as other, important ends.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

In particular, modafinil is admixed with various excipients to formulate a solid dose of modafinil. In certain embodiments, the solid dose is in tablet form, in other embodiments, it is in capsule form.<br>
An additional aspect of the present invention include processes for the preparation of modafinil formulations. In particular, the processes involve preparation of a solid dosage form of modafinil, preferably by wet mixing modafinil and excipients with water, followed by drying and milling of the granulated mixture.<br>
Other aspects of the present invention include use of these compositions for the treatment of a disease or disorder in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of the compositions of the present invention.<br>

In a second embodiment, the present invention provides for a process of preparing a solid dosage form of modafinil by wet mixing modafinil and excipients with water, drying and milling the granulated mixture. In certain embodiments, the final mixture is compressed into a tablet. In other embodiments, the final mixture is encapsulated. In particular, the process comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	dry blending of modafinil and one or more excipients to form a dry<br>
mixture;<br>
(b)	wetting the dry mixture with water, preferably with purified water, to<br>
form a wet granulation mixture;<br>
(c)	drying the wet granulation mixture to form a dried granulation mixture;<br>
(d)	milling the dried granulation mixture to form a milled granulation<br>
mixture;<br><br>
-10-<br>
(e)	mixing a lubricant in the milled granulation mixture to give a final<br>
blended mixture;<br>
(f)	preparing the final blended mixture in a solid dosage form suitable for<br>
oral administration.<br>
i	In certain preferred embodiments, the final blended mixture is compressed into<br>
tablets. In other preferred embodiments, the final blended mixture is enclosed in a    -capsule.<br>
Specifically, in step (a), modafinil is blended with all excipients in the final formulation, other than the lubricant. In particular, modafinil is thoroughly dry blended with the diluent(s), disintegrant(s) and binder to form a uniform dry mixture. Blenders appropriate for large scale dry blending include twin shell blenders, double cone blenders, and ribbon blenders. Ribbon blenders have the advantage of being used in continuous-production procedures. High-speed, high shear mixers may also be used and offer the advantage of shorter mixing times. The dry mixture may also be granulated, milled into a fine powder, passed through a mesh screen, or micronized, if necessary. Preferably, the dry blending was performed in high shear granulators.<br>
The resulting dry mixture is then wetted with a wetting agent to form a wet granulation mixture in step (b). The wetting agent is typically added over time, usually from about 1 to about 15 minutes, with continuous mixing. Typically, the wetting agent is added to the blender used in the dry blending step. Preferably the wet granulation is carried out in a high shear granulator. In certain embodiments, the wetting agent is an aqueous-based solution. Preferably, the wetting agent is water without any additional solvents, and in particular, without organic solvents. More preferably, the water is purified water. The type and amount of wetting agent, rate of addition of wetting agent, and the mixing time influences the structure of the granules. The different types of granules, such as pendular, funicular, capillary, etc., can be manipulated to achieve the desired density, porosity, texture and dissolution pattern of the granules, which in turn, determines the compressibility, hardness, disintegration and consolidation characteristics of the dried mixture.<br>
The wet granulation mixture is then dried in step (c) to form a dried granulation mixture with an appropriate moisture content. In certain embodiments, the drying means include a fluid bed or tray dryers. Fluid bed drying yield shorter drying times, in the range from 1 to 3 hours, while tray drying averages 10 to 13 hours. Preferably, the wet granulation mixture is dried in a fluid bed, for preferably about 1-3 hours.<br><br>
-11-<br>
Fluid bed drying has the added advantages of better temperature control and decreased costs. The method of drying, drying time, and moisture content are critical to avoid decomposition, chemical migration, and other adverse physical characteristics of dried mixture which can affect the dosage form performance.<br>
The dried granulation mixture is subsequently milled in step (d) to form a milled granulation mixture. The particle size of the dried granulation mixture is reduced to achieve an appropriate particle size distribution for the subsequent processes. In certain embodiments, milling is achieved using a high shear impact mill (such as Fitzpatrick) or a low shear screening mill (such as Comil). The dried granulation mixture may also be screened to select the desired granule size.<br>
In the next step (e), the lubricant was blended with the dried granulation mixture to give a final blended mixture. In certain embodiments, a V blender or bin blenders are used. A preferred blender is a V-shell PK blender. A gentle blending is preferred, such that each granule covered with the lubricant, while minimizing the breaking up of the granules. Increased breaking of the granules results in fine powder, or "fines". A high fine content results in variations of weight and density during compression into a tablet, as well as increases the need for cleaning of the compression machinery.<br>
The final blended mixture is then prepared in a solid dosage form suitable for oral administration. Solid dosage forms include tablets, capsules, pills, troches, cachets, and the like. In one embodiment, the final blended mixture is compressed into a tablet. The compression machinery typically contains two steel punches within a steel die cavity. The tablet is formed when pressure is exerted on the dried granulation mixture by the punches in the cavity, or cell. Tableting machines include single-punch machines, rotary tablet machines, gravity feed, and powder assisted machines. Preferably, gravity feed or powder assisted machines are used. Rotary machines operating at high speeds suitable for large-scale production include double rotary machines and single rotary machines. Tablets can also include sugar-coated tablets, film-coated tablets, enteric-coated tablets, multiple-compressed tablets, controlled-release tablets, tablets for solution, effervescent tablets or buccal and sublingual tablets.<br>
Compressed tablets may be characterized by a number of specifications, including diameter size, shape, thickness, weight, hardness, friability, disintegration time, and dissolution characteristics. The compositions of the current invention preferably have similar properties to that of Provigil®. The tablets preferably have<br><br>
-12-<br>
weights, friability and dissolution rates in accordance with USP standards. The preferred hardness and thickness ranges of various sized tablets are shown below in Table 1:     "<br><br>
In another embodiment, the final blended mixture is enclosed in capsules, preferably hard gelatin capsules. The hard gelatin capsules are commercially available, and are generally made from gelatin, colorants, optionally an opacifying agent such as titanium dioxide, and typically contain 12-16% water. The hard capsules can be prepared by filling the longer end of the capsule with the final blended mixture, and slipping a cap over the top using mG2, Zanasi, or Hofliger and Karg (H&amp;K) machines.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the present invention provides for a process of preparing a solid dose form of modafinil by dry mixing modafinil with the excipients. In certain embodiments, the mixture is compressed into a tablet. In other embodiments, the mixture is encapsulated. In particular, the process comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	dry blending of modafinil and one or more excipients to form a dry<br>
mixture;<br>
(b)	mixing a lubricant in the dry mixture to give a final blended mixture;<br>
(c)	preparing the final blended mixture in a solid dosage form suitable for<br>
oral administration.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the final blended mixture is compressed into tablets. In other preferred embodiments, the final blended mixture is enclosed in a capsule.<br>
Specifically, in step (a), modafinil is blended with all excipients in the final formulation, other than the lubricant. Preferably, modafinil is thoroughly dry blended with the diluent(s), disintegrant(s) and a binder to form a uniform dry mixture. Blenders appropriate for large scale dry blending include twin shell blenders, double cone blenders, V blenders or bin blenders. A preferred blender is a V-shell PK blender. High-speed, high shear mixers may also be used.  The dry mixture may also be<br><br>
-13-<br>
granulated, milled into a fine powder, passed through a mesh screen, or micronized, if necessary.<br>
In the next step (b), the lubricant was blended with the dry mixture to give a final blended mixture. In certain embodiments, a V blender or bin blenders are used. A preferred blender is a V-shell PK blender.<br>
The final blended mixture is then prepared in a solid dosage form suitable for * oral administration. Solid dosage forms include tablets, capsules, pills, troches, cachets, and the like. In one embodiment, the final blended mixture is compressed into a tablet. In another embodiment, the final blended mixture is enclosed in capsules, preferably hard gelatin capsules.<br>
Other aspects of the invention also include use of these compositions for the treatment of a disease or disorder in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of the compositions of the present invention. In particular, the present compositions are useful in the treatment of sleepiness, promotion of wakefulness, treatment of Parkinson's disease, cerebral ischemia, stroke, sleep apneas, eating disorders, stimulation of appetite and weight gain, treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and fatigue, and improvement of cognitive dysfunction.<br>
