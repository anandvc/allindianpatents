				<td>PIPERIDINE DERIVATIVES AS HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS<br>
INHIBITORS<br>
The present invention relates to novel antiviral compounds directed against the papilloma virus, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, to their preparation method and synthesis intermediates as well as to their use for treating or preventing an infection by the papilloma virus.<br>
The papilloma viruses  are  non-encased viruros,  the genome of which is formed by double strand DNA of about 8 kb. They are very widespread in nature and cause epithelial lesions in human as well as in many animals including rabbits, horses, dogs, and bovine species. More than a hundred human papilloma viruses (HPV) have been described. They are classified depending on their infection sites. About 30 HVP have been isolated from anogenital mucosas (cervix uteri, vagina, valva, penis, anus, rectum). The other HPVs are associated with skin lesions. The HPVs with cutaneous tropism include i.a., HPV1, HPV2, HPV3, HPV4, HPV5, HPV7, HPVS, HPV9, HPV10, HPV12, HPV14, HPV15, HPV17, HPV19, HPV20, HPV21, HPV22, HPV23, HPV24, HPV25, HPV26, HPV27, HPV28, HPV29, HPV38, HPV41, HPV4 7, HPV4 9. They are associated with lesions such as warts  (verruca vulgaris,  verruca plantaris, myrmecia  wart,  surface  wart,  verruca  plana...)  and diseases such as epidermo-dysplasia verruciformis.<br>
The mucogenital type HPVs are involved in laryngeal and anogenital diseases including certain cancers. They are often classified as high risk HPVs and low risk HPVs, with reference to the type of lesions with which they are associated. The low risk HPVs include, i.a., HPV6,<br><br>
HPVll, HPV13, HPV32, HPV34, HPV40, HPV42, HPV43, HPV44, HPV53, HPV54, HPV55, HPV57, HPV58, HPV74, HPV91. The low risk HPVs are associated with benign lesions such as condylomas  (genital warts such as acuminated condylomas    and   plane    condylomas),    laryngeal, conjunctive or buccal papillomas or other epithelial lesions  such as  intra-epithelial  neoplasias  of  low grade or recurrent respiratory papillomatoses, and more rarely  bowenoid  papuloses  or  high  grade  intra¬epithelial neoplasias or carcinomas.  High risk HPVs --include i.a., HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33, HPV35, HPV39, HPV45, HPV51, HPV52, HPV56, HPV59, HPV61, HPV62, HPV66, HPV67,  HPV6 8,  HPV72. They are involved in low grade intra-epithelial lesions which may develop into higher grade lesions right up to cancers, in particular cervix uteri cancer and other anogenital cancers.<br>
Genital infections by HPVs are the most frequent sexually transmitted infections in the world, including in the developed countries with more than 20 million people infected in the United States. Prevalence of HPV infections varies from 3-42% depending on the countries and affects 10-20% of the sexually active population in industrialized countries. In part of this population, the infection persists and may lead to cancers in the case of high risk HPVs.<br>
The prevalence of genital warts (condylomas) is estimated to be 1-2% in the sexually active population of industrialized countries, i.e. about 3,500,000 new cases every year in these countries and 28,000,000 worldwide. Genital warts may be found on parts of the body comprising the anus, vulva, vagina, cervix uteri and penis or peripheral bodies thereto.<br><br>
Treatments of genital warts are based on several strategies, from physical destruction (cryotherapy, C02 laser, electro-surgery, surgical excision), application of cytotoxic agents (TCA, podophyllin, podofilox) right up to the application of immuno-modulator agents (interferon, imiquimod}. However, none of these methods completely eliminates all the viral particles, and significant rates of recurrence, accompanied by severe secondary effects are observed with present therapeutic strategies. This reinforces a need for new strategies for controlling or eliminating infections by papilloma viruses.<br>
Unlike what exists in the treatment of other viral diseases, such as those caused by HIV, herpes viruses or influenza viruses, to this day there is no antiviral treatment which specifically targets viral pathogens which the papilloma viruses are.<br>
The papilloma viruses infect multistratified epitheliums and their viral cycle is closely related to organogenesis of theses organs and to differentiation of keratinocytes. After infection, the viral genome is present and replicated in a small number in basal cells of the epithelium. As the cells gradually differentiate, the expression of the viral genes and the number of copies of the viral genome increase until expression of the genes of the viral capsid and formation of infectious virions in totally differentiated keratinocytes.<br>
The genome of HPVs potentially codes for about ten proteins. The earliest expressed proteins, El and E2, are involved in the replication of the viral genome and the regulation of the expression of the viral genes.<br><br>
The other early proteins of these viruses (E4, E5, E6, E7) have functions in relationship with cell proliferation or roles which are not yet completely explained. The existence of E3 and E8 proteins is still uncertain. Late proteins LI and L2 are those which form the viral capsid.<br>
The only 2 viral proteins required and sufficient for replicating HPVs are El and E2 . They are capable of forming an E1/E2 complex and of binding on the replication origin (Ori) of the HPVs, a sequence contained in the viral genome and bearing close sites recognized by El and by E2 . E2 is capable of binding with very high affinity to the E2 sites whereas El, alone, does not have very high affinity for El sites. The interaction between El and E2 increases binding of El on Ori by cooperative binding to DNA. Once it is bound to DNA, El no longer interacts with E2 but forms a hexamer. The helicase and ATPase activities of El allow unfolding of the viral DNA which is then replicated by the cell replication mechanism.<br>
The inventors have sought to develop small molecules which inhibit replication of HPVs, preferably with a low risk, by notably interfering with the formation of the complex between the El and E2 proteins.<br>
A solution was found by elaborating novel derivatives.<br>
The object of the present invention is these novel derivatives, their synthesis, as well as their use in pharmaceutical compositions capable of being used in preventing and treating pathologies related to inhibition of HPV replication, such as for example, HPV1, HPV2, HPV3, HPV4, HPV5, HPV7, HPVS, HPV9, HPVl0,<br><br>

RESULTS OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
Activity of molecules against the papilloma virus may¬be evaluated in different in vitro and cell tests such as those described by Chiang efc al. (1992), Proc. jVatl. Acad. Sci . USA, 89: 5799-5803 or further by White et al. (2003), Journal of Biological Chemistry, 278: 26765-26772.<br>
Example 34 ; Pharmacological studies of the compoun<is of the invention in eel tests for replication viral dna hpvs></is>
These tests measure replication of viral genomic DNA in human cells. They are based on co-transfection of a reporter vector containing a viral replication oj-'igin (ori) and of expression vectors coding for the El and E2 proteins of HPV. With them, it is possible to f(pllow the whole of the biological functions of El and E2 required for replicating the HPV genome.<br>
A reporter 'rep1icon' vector containing the viral replication origin of HPV11/HPV6 (also called LCRs which bear sites for binding the El and E2 proteins of HPV) and the gene coding for firefly luciferase under the transcriptional control of the SV40 promoter were built. It was checked that the presence of the HPV replication origin does not have any transcriptional effect on expression of the gene of luciferase, this in the presence or in the absence of viral El or E2 proteins. Co-transfection of this replicon vector and of vectors for expressing HPV El and E2 proteins leads to an increase in luciferase activity depending on the presence of El and E2 and expresses the increase in the number of reporter vectors. This is due to the activity of  the  viral  El  and  E2  proteins  which  allow<br><br>
replication, in mammal cells, of this replicon vector containing a viral replication origin.<br>
The chemical compounds were evaluated for their activity inhibiting viral replication dependent on El and E2 of HPV11/HPV6 in these cell tests by co-transfecting, in human cell lines derived from kidney epithelial or cervical carcinoma cells, the replicon-reporter vector and pairs of HPV11/HPV6 El and E2 expression vectors. Various doses of the compounds were incubated for 2-6 days after transfection in the cell medium and luciferase activity was determined by means of a luminometer in order to evaluate IC50 of the compounds on replication of the HPV genome.<br>
All the compounds shown in the examples above inhibit replication dependent on El and E2 of HPVII/HPV6 in cells with an IC50 less than 2 0 uM. The preferred compounds are those for which IC50 may be less than 750 nM,<br>
With complementary cell tests, it was possible to show that the compounds shown in the examples above inhibit HPVll and HPV6 E1/E2 interaction.<br><br><br>
