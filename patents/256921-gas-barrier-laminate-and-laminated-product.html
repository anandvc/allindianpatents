DESCRIPTION GAS BARRIER LAMINATE AND LAMINATED PRODUCT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a gas barrier laminate that exhibits excellent gas barrier properties even under conditions of high humidity, suffers no reduction in lamination strength following boiling treatment, and exhibits superior adhesion, heat resistance and water resistance.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Thermoplastic resin films such as polyamide films and polyester films have excellent strength, transparency and moldability, and are consequently widely used as packaging materials. However, because these thermoplastic resin films also exhibit reasonably high levels of permeability to gases such as oxygen, if this type of thermoplastic resin film is used for packaging general foodstuffs, retort foods, cosmetics, medical supplies, or agricultural chemicals or the like, then during long-term storage, gases such as oxygen can permeate through the film, causing deterioration of the package contents.<br>
As a result, laminated films produced by coating the surface of a thermoplastic resin with an emulsion or the like of polyvinylidene chloride (hereafter abbreviated as PVDC), thereby forming a PVDC layer with good gas barrier properties, are widely used for applications such as food packaging. However, PVDC generates organic substances such as acidic gases on incineration, and with recent advances in environmental awareness, there is considerable demand for replacing PVDC with other materials.<br>
[0003]<br>
One example of an alternative material to PVDC is polyvinyl alcohol (hereafter abbreviated as PVA), which does not generate toxic gases, and exhibits excellent gas barrier properties under low humidity conditions. However, as the humidity increases, the gas barrier property declines rapidly, so that in most cases, PVA films cannot be used for wrapping foods that contam moisture.<br><br>
One example of a polymer known to improve upon the deterioration in gas barrier properties seen for PVA under high humidity conditions is a copolymer of vinyl alcohol and ethylene (hereafter abbreviated as EVOH). However, in order to ensure that the gas barrier property is maintained at a practical level under high humidity, the proportion of ethylene within the copolymer must be increased to a certain level, but the resulting polymer becomes difficult to dissolve in water. Accordingly, in order to produce a coating agent using EVOH with a high ethylene ratio within the copolymer, either an organic solvent, or a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent must be used. However the use of organic solvents is undesirable from an environmental perspective, and also results in increased costs due to the necessity of providing a process for recovering the organic solvent. [0005]<br>
Examples of methods that have been proposed for coating a film with a liquid composition comprising a water-soluble polymer in order to achieve favorable gas barrier properties even under conditions of high humidity include methods in which an aqueous solution comprising PVA and a partially neutralized product of polyacrylic acid or polymethacrylic acid is coated onto a film, and a heat treatment is then conducted to effect cross-linking via ester linkages between the two polymers (see patent references 1 to 7). However, in the methods proposed in these references, either a high-temperature heat treatment or a heat treatment over an extended period is required to achieve favorable gas barrier properties, and because large quantities of energy are therefore required during production, the impact on the environment is not insignificant. Moreover, if a high-temperature heat treatment is employed, then not only is there an increased danger of color changes or decomposition of the PVA and the like that constitute the gas barrier layer, but deformation such as wrinkling can occur in the plastic film substrate or the like to which the gas barrier layer is laminated, meaning the product cannot be used as a packaging material. In order to prevent deterioration of the plastic substrate, a special heat-resistant film that is capable of withstanding the high-temperature heat treatment must be used as the substrate, but this creates problems of practicality and economic viability. On the other hand, if the temperature of the heat treatment is lowered, then treatment must be conducted over an extremely long period, causing a deterioration in productivity.<br>
[0006]<br>
Furthermore, investigations are also being conducted into resolving the above problems associated with PVA film by introducing cross-linking structures into the PVA. However, although the humidity dependence of the oxygen gas barrier property of PVA<br><br>
film typically decreases with increasing cross-linking density, the inherent oxygen gas barrier property of the PVA film under dry conditions tends to deteriorate, meaning it is extremely difficult to achieve a favorable oxygen gas barrier property under high humidity conditions. Cross-linking of polymer molecules generally improves the water resistance, but the gas barrier property describes the ability of the material to prevent the penetration or diffusion of comparatively small molecules such as oxygen, and a favorable gas barrier property can not always be achieved simply by cross-linking the polymer. For example, three dimensional cross-linked polymers such as epoxy resins and phenolic resins do not exhibit effective gas barrier properties.<br>
[0007]<br>
Methods have also been proposed which, although using a water-soluble polymer such as PVA, are capable of providing gas barrier laminates with favorable gas barrier properties even under high humidity, by conducting heat treatments at lower temperatures or for shorter time periods than those conventionally used (see patent references 8 to 10).<br>
Although using water-soluble polymers, the gas barrier layer-forming coating materials disclosed in the patent references 8 to 10 are able to form gas barrier laminates with superior gas barrier properties to those conventionally obtained, by conducting heating at lower temperatures or for shorter time periods than those employed for the coating agents disclosed in the patent references 1 to 7. However, with the methods disclosed in the patent references 8 to 10, in which an esterification reaction is conducted between the hydroxyl groups of PVA and the COOH groups within an ethylene-maleic acid copolymer, or in which metal cross-linking structures are introduced, there is a limit to the degree of improvement than can be achieved in the gas barrier property under high humidity.<br>
[0008]<br>
As a result, other methods have been proposed that improve on the above techniques in order to achieve even better gas barrier properties (see patent references 11 to 14). These references disclose that, by heat treating a gas barrier coating material comprising PVA and a composition prepared by partially neutralizing an ethylene-maleic acid copolymer with a specific metal salt, a gas barrier coating can be obtained that is superior to those disclosed in the patent references 8 to 10, and that by heat treating the thus obtained gas barrier coating in the presence of water, or in the presence of water comprising a specific metal ion, an even more superior gas barrier coating can be obtained. Examples of the method used for conducting the heat treatment in the presence of water (or water comprising a specific metal ion) include immersion in hot water, hot water<br><br>
spraying, storage under high humidity conditions, and steam heating, wherein the treatment temperature is preferably not less than 90Â°C , and the treatment time is preferably not less than 1 minute.<br>
However, in these types of methods, because the film with the gas barrier layer coated thereon must be in contact with water for a comparatively long time, the production process can be expected to be more complex, and the productivity is expected to worsen. Moreover, the effects of heat and water absorption on the film during the treatment step are considerable, meaning that, for example, in those cases where a highly water-absorbent film such as a polyamide is used as the substrate, adverse effects on the product quality such as deformation and curling are a concern. [0009]<br>
As described above, although there are increasing demands for further improvements in the gas barrier properties under conditions of high humidity, obtaining a high-quality gas barrier laminate with superior performance in an industrially efficient manner has proven difficult with the conventional technology. Moreover, incorporating a metal compound into the coating agent causes a deterioration in the film-forming properties, and causes a deterioration in the adhesive strength, the heat resistance and the water resistance when a laminated structure (or a laminated product) is prepared with a heat seal layer, meaning performance problems arise in practical applications.

[0020]<br>
If required, the above heat-moldable thermoplastic resin may also contain either one, or two or more additives such as pigments, antioxidants, antistatic agents, ultraviolet absorbers, lubricants or preservatives, which can be added in a combined quantity within a range from 0.001 to 5.0 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the resin.<br>
[0021]<br>
Furthermore, in those cases where, as described below, the gas barrier laminate according to the present invention is used for forming a packaging material, in order to<br><br>
ensure adequate strength as a packaging material, any of the various reinforced plastics can be used as the plastic substrate (I) used for forming the gas barrier laminate. In other words, either one, or two or more reinforcing fibers such as glass fiber, aromatic polyamide fiber, carbon fiber, pulp, or cotton linter; powdered reinforcing materials such as carbon black or white carbon; or flake-like reinforcing materials such as glass flakes or aluminum flakes can be blended into the thermoplastic resin in a combined quantity within a range from 2 to 150 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the thermoplastic resin.<br>

[0023] <gas barrier layer><br>
The gas barrier layer (II) is formed from the gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C) containing the polyalcohol-based polymer (A) and the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B). By applying this gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C) to the surface of the plastic substrate (I) and then conducting a heat treatment, the two components (A) and (B) undergo cross-linking via ester linkages, forming a gas barrier layer having a dense, cross-linked structure,<br>
[0024]<br>
The relative blend proportions of the polyalcohol-based polymer (A) and the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) are set such that the molar ratio between OH groups and COOH groups (OH groups / COOH groups) is preferably within a range from 0.01 to 20, even more preferably from 0.01 to 10, even more preferably from 0.02 to 5, and is most preferably from 0.04 to 2. If the proportion of OH groups is smaller than the above range, then there is a danger of a deterioration in the film-forming performance, whereas if the proportion of COOH groups is smaller than the above range, then there is a danger that a cross-linked structure with an adequate cross-linking density to the<br><br>
polyalcohol-based polymer (A) cannot be formed, and the gas barrier properties under high humidity conditions may not manifest satisfactorily.<br>
[0025]<br>
From the viewpoint of workability, the gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C) is preferably either an aqueous solution or an aqueous dispersion, and is most preferably an aqueous solution. Accordingly, the polyalcohol-based polymer (A) is preferably water-soluble, and the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) is also preferably water-soluble.<br>
[0026]<br>
The polyalcohol-based polymer (A) is an alcohol-based polymer containing two or more hydroxyl groups within each molecule, preferred examples of which include polyvinyl alcohol, copolymers of ethylene and vinyl alcohol, and sugars.<br>
The saponification degree within the polyvinyl alcohol or copolymer of ethylene and vmyl alcohol is preferably not less than 95 mol%, and is even more preferably 98 mol% or greater, whereas the average polymerization degree is preferably within a range from 50 to 4,000, and is even more preferably from 200 to 3,000.<br>
[0027]<br>
Examples of sugars that may be used include monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. These sugars also include sugar alcohols and the various substituted forms or derivatives thereof, and cyclic oligosaccharides such as cyclodextrin. These sugars are preferably soluble in water.<br>
[0028]<br>
Examples of starches, which are included within the above polysaccharides, include raw starches (unmodified starches) such as wheat starch, com starch, waxy com starch, potato starch, tapioca starch, rice starch, ocarina starch and sago starch, as well as all manner of processed starches. Examples of processed starches include physically modified starches, enzymatically modified starches, starches modified by chemical decomposition, chemically modified starches, and grafted starches in which a monomer is graft polymerized to a starch. Of these starches, water-soluble processed starches such as roasted dextrin and glycosylated products of reduced starches in which the reducing terminals have been alcoholized are preferred. The starch may also be in the form of a hydrate. These starches may be used either alone, or in combinations of two or more different materials.<br>
The aforementioned polyalcohol-based polymer (A) may use either a single compound, or a combination of two or more different compounds.<br><br>
The polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) is a polymer (BP) containing carboxyl groups or acid anhydride groups, obtained by polymerizing a monomer (BM) containing a carboxyl group or acid anhydride group and an ethylenic unsaturated double bond. The monomer (BM) preferably contains an acryloyl group or methacryloyl group (hereafter, these groups are referred to jointly as a (meth)acryloyl group) as the ethylenic unsaturated double bond. Examples of the monomer include (meth)acrylic acid, 2-carboxyethyl (meth)acrylate, Ï-carboxy-polycaprolactone mono(meth)acrylate, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, fumaric anhydride, citraconic acid, citraconic anhydride, itaconic acid, and itaconic anhydride. Of these, (meth)acrylic acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, itaconic acid and itaconic anhydride are preferred.<br>
[0030]<br>
These monomers may be used alone or in combinations of two or more different monomers, or may also be used in a combination with another monomer. In other words, examples of the polymer (BP) obtained by polymerizing the monomer (BM) include homopolymers (BPl) obtained by polymerization of any one of the monomers (BM), copolymers (BP2) obtained by copolymerization of a plurality of the monomers (BM), and copolymers (BP3) obtained by copolymerization of a monomer (BM) and another monomer.<br>
[0031]<br>
Examples of other monomers that can be copolymerized with the monomer (BM) include any monomer that does not contain a carboxyl group or hydroxyl group, but is able to undergo copolymerization with the monomer (BM), Examples include esterified products of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids such as crotonic acid or (meth)acrylic acid that do not contain a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group, (meth)acrylamide, (meth)acrylonitrile, styrene, styrenesulfonic acid, vinyltoluene, Î± -olefins of 2 to 30 carbon atoms such as ethylene, alkyl vinyl ethers, and vinylpyrrolidone. These other monomers may be used either alone, or in combinations of two or more different monomers,<br>
[0032]<br>
The coating material (C) may include arbitrary combinations of homopolymers (BPl), copolymers of BM monomers (BP2), and copolymers of a BM monomer and another monomer (BP3), and for example, may include two or more homopolymers (BPl), two or more copolymers (BP2), or two or more copolymers (BP3). Altematively, other combinations such as a homopolymer (BPl) and a copolymer (BP2), a homopolymer<br><br>
(BPl) and a copolymer (BP3), a copolymer (BP2) and a copolymer (BP3), or a homopolymer (BPl), a copolymer (BP2) and a copolymer (BP3) may also be used.<br>
[0033]<br>
One example of a polymer (BP) that can be used favorably is an olefin-maleic acid copolymer, and an ethylene-maleic acid copolymer (hereafter abbreviated as "EMA") is particularly desirable. This EMA can be obtained by copolymerization of maleic anhydride and ethylene, using known methods such as a solution radical polymerization.<br>
[0034]<br>
The maleic acid units in EMA tend to form maleic anhydride structures under dry conditions via a cyclodehydration of adjacent carboxyl groups, but then undergo ring opening to form maleic acid structures under humid conditions or within an aqueous solution. Accordingly, unless stated otherwise, the combination of maleic acid units and maleic anhydride units is referred to generically using the term maleic acid units. The maleic acid units in the EMA preferably represent not less than 5 mol%, even more preferably 20 mol% or greater, even more preferably 30 mol% or greater, and most preferably 35 mol% or greater.<br>
The weight average molecular weight of the EMA is preferably within a range from 1,000 to 1,000,000, even more preferably from 3,000 to 500,000, even more preferably from 7,000 to 300,000, and is most preferably from 10,000 to 200,000.<br>
[0035]<br>
The polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) may use either a single polymer, or a combination of two or more different polymers.<br>
[0036]<br>
In order to promote the cross-linking reaction between the polyalcohol-based polymer (A) and the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B), and improve the gas barrier properties, a cross-linking agent may be added to the gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C).<br>
The quantity added of the cross-linking agent is preferably within a range from 0.1 to 30 parts by mass, and even more preferably from 1 to 20 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass of the combination of the polyalcohol-based polymer (A) and the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B). If the quantity added of the cross-linking agent is less than 0.1 parts by mass, then the addition of the cross-Unking agent yields no marked cross-linking effect compared with the case where no cross-linking agent is added, whereas if the quantity exceeds 30 parts by mass, then the cross-linking agent may actually impede the development of gas barrier properties, both of which are undesirable.<br><br>
The above cross-linking agent may be a cross-linking agent with self cross-linking properties, a compound that contains a plurality of functional groups within each molecule capable of reacting with carboxyl groups and/or hydroxyl groups, or a metal complex with polyvalent coordination sites. Of these, isocyanate compounds, melamine compounds, urea compounds, epoxy compounds, carbodiimide compounds and zirconium salt compounds and the like are preferred, as they yield superior gas barrier properties. A plurality of these cross-linking agents may also be used in combination.<br>
Alternatively, a catalyst such as an acid may be added to the coating material (C) in order to accelerate the cross-linking reaction and improve the gas barrier properties.<br>
Adding a cross-linking agent or a catalyst accelerates the cross-linking reaction that occurs via the formation of ester linkages between the polyalcohol-based polymer (A) and the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B), and is therefore able to further improve the gas barrier properties of the resulting gas barrier layer (II).<br>
[0037]<br>
Moreover, additives such as heat stabilizers, antioxidants, reinforcing materials, pigments, age resistors, weatherproofmg agents, flame retardants, plasticizers, release agents and lubricants may also be added to the gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C), provided such addition does not significantly impair the characteristics of the coating material.<br>
Examples of the above heat stabilizers, antioxidants and age resistors include hindered phenols, phosphorus compounds, hindered amines, sulfur compounds, copper compounds, alkali metal halides, and mixtures thereof<br>
Examples of reinforcing materials include clay, talc, calcium carbonate, zinc carbonate, woUastonite, silica, alumina, magnesium oxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminate, sodium aluminosilicate, magnesium silicate, glass balloons, carbon black, zinc oxide, zeolite, hydrotalcite, metal fibers, metal whiskers, ceramic whiskers, potassium titanate whiskers, boron nitride, graphite, glass fiber, and carbon fiber.<br>
[0038]<br>
In addition, an inorganic layered compound may also be added to the gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C) in order to further improve the gas barrier properties, provided such addition does not significantly impair the characteristics of the coating material. Here, the term "inorganic layered compound" refers to an inorganic compound in which unit crystal layers are superimposed to form a layered structure. Specific examples include zirconium phosphate (a phosphate-based derivative compound),<br><br>
chalcogenides, lithium-aluminum composite hydroxides, graphite, and clay minerals. Compounds that swell and undergo cleavage within solvents are preferred.<br>
[0039]<br>
Examples of preferred clay minerals include montmorillonite, beidellite, saponite, hectorite, sauconite, vermiculite, fluoromica, muscovite, paragonite, phlogopite, biotite, lepidolite, margarite, clintonite, anandite, chlorite, donbassite, sudoite, cookeite, clinochlore, chamosite, nimite, tetrasilylic mica, talc, pyrophyllite, nacrite, kaolinite, halloysite, chrysotile, sodium taenio lite, xanthophyllite, antigorite, dickite, and hydrotalcite, and of these, swelling fluoromica or montmorillonite are particularly preferred.<br>
These clay minerals may be naturally formed materials, artificially synthesized or modified materials, or compounds that have been treated with organic materials such as onium salts.<br>
[0040]<br>
Of the above clay minerals, a swelling fluoromica-based mineral is the most preferred compound in terms of its degree of whiteness, and such minerals can be represented by the formula (1) shown below, and can be readily synthesized.<br>
a(MF)'Î²(aMgF2'bMgO)-YSiO2	(1)<br>
(In the formula, M represents sodium or lithium, and Î±, Î², Î³ , a, and b each represent a coefficient, wherein 0J
[0041]<br>
One method of producing this type of swelling fluoromica-based mineral is a so-called melt method, wherein silicon oxide, magnesium oxide, and various fluorides are mixed together, the resuhing mixture is heated at 1,400 to 1,500Â°C in an electric or gas oven until the components have completely melted, and crystals of the fluoromica-based mineral are then grown within the reaction vessel during the cooling process.<br>
[0042]<br>
An alternative method uses talc as a starting material, and involves intercalating alkali metal ions within the talc to generate a swelling fluoromica-based mineral (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. H02-149415). In this method, the talc is mixed with an alkali silicofluoride or an alkali fluoride, and the mixture is then subjected to a short heat treatment in a magnetic crucible at a temperature of approximately 700 to 1,200Â°C, thereby yielding the swelling fluoromica-based mineral.<br>
In this method, from the viewpoint of achieving a favorable production yield for the swelling fluoromica-based mineral, the quantity of the alkali silicofluoride or alkali<br><br>
fluoride mixed with the talc preferably represents 10 to 35% by mass of the resulting mixture.<br>
In order to enable the above swelling fluoromica-based mineral to be obtained, the alkali metal of the alkali silicofluoride or alkali fluoride must be either sodium or lithium. These alkali metals may be used either alone, or in combination. Of the alkali metals, if potassium is used alone, then a swelling fluoromica-based mineral cannot be obtained, although potassium can be used in limited quantities in combination with either sodium or lithium, for the purpose of regulating the swelling characteristics.<br>
[0043]<br>
In addition, a small qntity of alumina may also be added during production of the swelling fluoromica-based mineral to regulate the swelling characteristics of the produced swelling fluoromica-based mineral. Of the above clay minerals, montmorillonite is represented by a formula (2) shown below, and can be obtained by purifying naturally occurring material.<br>
MaSi4(Al2-aMga)0,o(OH)2'nH2O	(2)<br>
(In the formula, M represents a sodium cation, and a represents a number within a range from 0.25 to 0.60. Furthermore, the number of water molecules bonded to the interlayer ion exchange cations varies depending on the nature of the cations and conditions such as the humidity, and this variability is expressed by the nH2O in the formula.)<br>
[0044]<br>
Montmorillonite also includes the homo ionic substituted materials of magnesian montmorillonite (3), iron montmorillonite (4), and iron magnesian montmorillonite (5), as represented by the group of formulas (3) to (5) shown below, and these materials may also be used.<br>
MaSi4(Al,,67.aMgoWO10(OH)2-nH2O	(3)<br>
MaSi4(Fe2-a^^Mga)0,o(OH)2-nH2O	(4)<br>
MaSi4(Fe,.67-a^^Mgo.5^a)Oio(OH)2-nH2O	(5)<br>
(In the formulas, M represents a sodium cation, and a represents a number within a range from 0.25 to 0.60.)<br>
Normally, montmorillonite contains ion exchange cations such as sodium or calcium between the layers of the material, but the quantity of these cations varies depending on the location from which the material is sourced. In the present invention, a montmorillonite in which an ion exchange process or the like has been used to substitute these interlayer ion.nge cations with sodium is preferred. Furthermore, the use of montmorillonite that has been purified by water treatment is also preferred.<br><br>
These types of inorganic layered compounds may also be added to the gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C) in combination with the aforementioned cross-linking agent.<br>
[0045]<br>
When mixing the polyalcohol-based polymer (A) and the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) to prepare an aqueous solution containing the two components that is then used as the coating material (C), an alkali compound is preferably added in sufficient quantity to provide from 0,1 to 20% equivalence relative to the carboxyl groups within the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B).<br>
If the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) contains a large quantity of carboxylic acid units, then the hydrophilicity of the polymer itself is high, and an aqueous solution can be formed without the addition of an alkali compound, but by adding an appropriate quantity of an alkali compound, the gas barrier properties of the film obtained by applying the gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C) can be improved markedly.<br>
The alkah compound may be any compound capable of neutralizing the carboxyl groups within the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B), and examples include the hydroxides of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, as well as ammonium hydroxide and organic ammonium hydroxides. Of these, alkali metal hydroxides are preferred.<br>
[0046]<br>
The method used for preparing the above aqueous solution may be a conventional method that uses a dissolution tank fitted with a stirrer. For example, in a preferred method, aqueous solutions of the polyalcohol-based polymer (A) and the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) are prepared separately, and then mixed together prior to use. In such cases, adding an aforementioned alkah compound to the aqueous solution of the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) can be used to improve the stability of the aqueous solution.<br>
[0047]<br>
The polyalcohol-based polymer (A) and the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) may also be added simultaneously to water within a dissolution tank, but adding the alkali compound to the water first improves the solubility of the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B).<br>
In order to enhance the solubility of the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) in water, shorten the drying process, and improve the stability of the aqueous solution, a small quantity of an alcohol or organic solvent may be added to the water.<br><br>
The concentration, namely the solid fraction, of the gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C) can be suitably adjusted in accordance with the specifications of the coating device, and/or the drying and heating device, although if the solution is overly dilute, then forming a thick enough layer (II) to ensure a satisfactory gas barrier property becomes difficult, and the subsequent drying process tends to require a long period of time. In contrast, if the concentration of the coating material is too high, then achieving a homogenous coating material becomes difficult, and coatability problems tend to develop. Considering these factors, the concentration (the solid fraction) of the coating material (C) is preferably within a range from 5 to 50% by mass.<br>
[0049]<br>
When forming the gas barrier layer (II) from the gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C), the coating material is first applied to the plastic substrate (I) or the anchor coat layer formed on top of the plastic substrate (I). There are no particular restrictions on the coating method used for applying the coating material (C), and typical methods such as gravure roll coating, reverse roll coating, wire bar coating and air knife coating can be used.<br>
[0050]<br>
Following application of the coating material (C), a heat treatment may be conducted immediately, thereby forming a dried coating and conducting a heat treatment simultaneously, or alternatively, the moisture and the like may be evaporated following application to first form a dried coating, by blowing hot air using a dryer or the like, or by irradiating infrared radiation, and a heat treatment then conducted subsequently. In terms of shortening the process, conducting the heat treatment immediately following coating is preferred, provided this does not impair the state of the gas barrier layer (II) or the physical properties such as the gas barrier property. There are no particular restrictions on the heat treatment method, and although conducting the heat treatment in a dry atmosphere such as an oven is considered typical, the heat treatment may also be conducted, for example, by bringing the coating into contact with a heated roller. In those cases where the substrate (I) is a stretched film, during formation of the gas barrier layer (II) from the gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C), either the coating material (C) may be applied to a stretched substrate (I), or the coating material (C) may be applied to the substrate (I) prior to stretching, and film stretching then conducted following coating,<br>
[0051]<br>
In either of the above cases, by subjecting the plastic substrate (I) with the gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C) coated thereon to a heat treatment of not more<br><br>
than 1 minute within a heated atmosphere of at least 100Â°C  the polyalcohol-based polymer (A) and the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) contained within the gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C) undergo a cross-linking reaction that forms ester linkages, and as a result of this cross-linking, the water-insoluble gas barrier layer (II) is formed.<br>
[0052]<br>
The heat treatment conditions are affected by factors such as the ratio between the polyalcohol-based polymer (A) and the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B), the existence of other added components, and the quantity of such added components if included, and ahhough it is impossible to generalize regarding the ideal heat treatment temperature for forming the gas barrier layer, the heat treatment is preferably conducted at a temperature within a range from 100 to 300Â°C , even more preferably from 120 to 250Â°C , even more preferably from 140 to 240Â°C, and most preferably from 160 to 220Â°C, If the heat treatment temperature is too low, then the cross-linking reaction between the polyalcohol-based polymer (A) and the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) may not proceed satisfactorily, making it difficult to obtain a gas barrier layer (11) with satisfactory gas barrier properties, whereas if the temperature is too high, then there is a danger that the coating may become brittle, both of which are undesirable.<br>
[0053]<br>
The heat treatment time is preferably not longer than 5 minutes, is typically within a range from 1 second to 5 minutes, preferably from 3 seconds to 2 minutes, and even more preferably from 5 seconds to 1 minute. If the heat treatment time is too short, then the above cross-linking reaction may not proceed satisfactorily, making it difficuh to obtain a gas barrier layer (II) with satisfactory gas barrier properties, whereas if the heat treatment time is too long, the productivity may deteriorate.<br>
[0054]<br>
In the present invention, the comparatively short heat treatment described above enables the formation of cross-linked structures based on ester linkages between the polyalcohol-based polymer (A) and the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B), thereby enabling the formation of the gas barrier layer (II).<br>
[0055]<br>
The thickness of the formed gas barrier layer (II) is preferably within a range from 0.05 to 3Âµm, even more preferably from 0.05 to 2Âµm, and is most preferably within a range from 0.08 to 1Âµm. If the thickness of the gas barrier layer (II) is less than 0.05 Âµm, then forming a layer of uniform thickness becomes problematic. In contrast, if the<br><br>
thickness exceeds 3 Âµm, then the heat treatment time may lengthen, and there is a danger of a deterioration in the productivity.<br>
[0056] <anchor coat layer><br>
An anchor coat layer may be used as required, is positioned between the plastic substrate (I) and the gas barrier layer (II), and has a principal role of improving the adhesion of the gas barrier layer (II),<br>
The coating agent used in the anchor coat layer can use conventional materials without any particular restrictions. Examples include isocyanate-based, polyurethane-based, polyester-based, polyethyleneimine-based, polybutadiene-based, polyolefin-based and alkyl titanate-based anchor coating agents. Of these, in view of achieving superior effects for the present invention, isocyanate-based,. polyurethane-based and polyester-based anchor coating agents are preferred. Moreover, mixtures and reaction products of either one, or two or more isocyanate compounds, polyurethanes or urethane prepolymers; mixtures and reaction products of one, or two or more polyesters, polyols or polyethers, and an isocyanate; or solutions or dispersions thereof are preferred.<br>
The coating agent can be applied to the substrate (I) using the same method as the coating method used for the coating material (C).<br>
[0057] <overcoat layer><br>
The overcoat layer (III) is a resin layer that is formed on top of the gas barrier layer (II) using an overcoat layer-forming coating material (F) that contains a monovalent metal compound (D) and/or a bivalent or higher metal compound (E).<br>
The overcoat layer (III) is preferably formed by applying the overcoat layer-forming coating material (F) to the surface of the gas barrier layer (II), and subsequently conducting a heat treatment.<br>
The monovalent metal compound (D) and/or bivalent or higher metal compound (E) within the overcoat layer (III) reacts with the polyalcohol-based polymer (A) or polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) within the gas barrier layer (II), forming cross-linked structures and therefore markedly improving the gas barrier properties of the laminate. The cross-linked structures formed by the reaction of the monovalent metal compound (D) and/or bivalent or higher metal compound (E) with the polyalcohol-based polymer (A) or the polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) may be coordination bonds, or the more obvious ionic or covalent bonds.<br><br>
In the present invention, these metal compounds are incorporated into the resin layer, and applied as a resin coating material, which is subsequently subjected to a heat treatment. By employing this method, superior gas barrier properties and transparency can be imparted to the laminate more easily, and in a more industrially efficient manner, than the case where the metal compound is applied as an aqueous solution and then subjected to a heat treatment.<br>
[0058]<br>
Examples of metals that may be used in the monovalent metal compound (D) include Li, Na, K, Rb and Se, of these, Li, Na and K are preferred, and of these, Li is the most desirable. The form of the metal compound used includes simple metals, as well as inorganic salts such as oxides, hydroxides, halides, carbonates and sulfates, and organic acid salts such as carboxylates and sulfonates. Of these, hydroxides and carbonates are preferred.<br>
[0059]<br>
Examples of the metal within the bivalent or higher metal compound (E) include Mg, Ca, Zn, Cu, Co, Fe, Ni, Al, and Zr. Of these, Mg, Ca and Zn are preferred, and Mg and Ca are particularly desirable. The form of the metal compound used includes simple metals, as well as inorganic salts such as oxides, hydroxides, halides, carbonates and sulfates, and organic acid salts such as carboxylates and sulfonates. Of these, oxides, hydroxides and carbonates are preferred.<br>
[0060]<br>
These metal compounds ((D) and/or (E)) may be used either alone, or in combinations of two or more different compounds, and for example, a plurality of compounds (D) and/or a plurality of compounds (E) may be used.<br>
The blend ratio of the metal compound ((D) and/or (E)) within the overcoat layer-forming coating material (F) varies considerably depending on factors such as the type of metal used, the form of the compound, and the type of resin used in forming the overcoat layer-forming coating material (F), but the quantity of the metal compound relative to 100 parts by mass of the solid fraction of the resin used in forming the overcoat layer-forming coating material (F) (or in those cases where a cross-linking agent is use, the combined solid fraction of the resin and the cross-linking agent) is preferably within a range from 0.1 to 100 parts by mass, even more preferably from 0.5 to 80 parts by mass, even more preferably from 0.75 to 75 parts by mass, and is most preferably from 1 to 65 parts by mass. If the blend quantity of the metal compound is less than 0.1 parts by mass, then the quantity of cross-linked structures formed by reaction with the polyalcohol-based polymer<br><br>
(A) or polycarboxylic acid-based polymer (B) within the gas barrier layer (II) decreases, meaning there is a danger of a deterioration in the gas barrier properties. In contrast, if the blend quantity of the metal compound exceeds 100 parts by mass, then the adhesion, heat resistance and water resistance of the formed overcoat layer (III) are prone to deterioration.<br>
[0061]<br>
The overcoat layer-forming coating material (F) may be an organic solvent-based coating liquid, an aqueous solution, or an aqueous dispersion. From the viewpoint of the gas barrier properties, and in terms of promoting the ionization of the metal, the overcoat layer-forming coating material (F) is preferably an aqueous solution or aqueous dispersion.<br>
However, in those cases where a monovalent metal compound (D) and/or bivalent or higher metal compound (E) that exhibits a comparatively high level of solubility in water is used, there is a danger that the water resistance of the overcoat layer (III) formed from the overcoat layer-forming coating material (F) may deteriorate. Moreover, in those cases where a basic monovalent metal compound (D) and/or bivalent or higher metal compound (E) is used, if the overcoat layer-forming coating material (F) is an aqueous solution or aqueous dispersion, then there is a danger that the stability and/or pot life of the overcoat layer-forming coating material (F) may deteriorate.<br>
For the above reasons, the overcoat layer-forming coating material (F) is preferably an organic solvent-based coating liquid. Here, the term "organic solvent-based coating liquid*' means that solvents other than water represent at least 90% by mass, and preferably 95% by mass or greater, of the total quantity of solvent within the coating liquid.<br>
Conventional organic solvents may be used as the solvent other than water, and examples include toluene, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), cyclohexanone, Solvesso, isophorone, xylene, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate and isopropyl alcohol (IPA), although this is not an exhaustive list, and most conventional organic solvents may be used either alone, or in mixtures containing two or more different solvents.<br>
[0062]<br>
From the viewpoint of achieving superior transparency following film formation, the monovalent metal compound (D) and/or bivalent or higher metal compound (E) is preferably in a finely powdered state at the time of mixing, and the average particle size is preferably not more than 10Âµm, even more preferably not more than 3Âµm, and is most preferably 1 Âµm or less.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
polyester polyol, polyacrylate polyol or polycarbonate polyol.<br><br><br><br><br>
blocking properties.<br><br><br>
gas barrier layer (II) and the overcoat layer (III) or the physical properties such a<br>
barrier property. There are no particular restrictions on the heat treatment  method and<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
the bag is sealed, bag rupture or sealing faults become more likely.<br><br>
Moreover, the ratio of the lamination strength (Y) following a hot water treatment for 30 minutes at 95Â°C relative to the strength (X) prior to the treatment (namely, Y/X) must be not less than 0.3, is preferably at least 0.4, and is even more preferably 0.5 or greater. If this ratio is less than 03, then it is not preferable because, when a packing bag is formed from the laminated product, contents are placed inside the bag, and the bag is sealed and then subjected to a hot water treatment, bag rupture or sealing fauhs become more likely.<br>
Here, the term "lamination strength" describes the interlayer adhesive strength between two arbitrary layers of a laminated product prepared by laminating a laminate adhesive layer (IV) and a heat seal layer (V), in that order, to the overcoat layer (III) or the plastic substrate (I) of a gas barrier laminate, either directly or with a printing ink layer disposed therebetween, and the expression "lamination strength of not less than 1 N/cm" means that the interlayer adhesive strength is at least 1 N/cm for each pair of layers.<br>
[0091]<br>
The laminate or laminated product according to the present invention can be employed in all manner of fields that require favorable gas barrier properties or lamination strength following boiling treatment. For example, the laminate can be used favorably for all maimer of packaging materials, and is particularly suited for packaging foodstuffs.<br>

[0092]<br>
As follows is a description of specifics of the present invention, based on a series of examples and comparative examples, although the present invention is not limited solely to these examples.<br>
[0093] <film elongation><br>
The resin used in forming the overcoat layer-forming coating material (F) was applied to a steel sheet in sufficient quantity to generate a dried film thickness of 500 Âµm, and was then dried for 15 hours at room temperature (25Â°C), 6 hours at 80Â°C, and 20 minutes at 120Â°C , thus forming a film. Using this film, the tensile elongation was measured in accordance with JIS A6021, and this value was reported as the film elongation.<br>
[0094] <oxygen gas barrier property><br><br>
The oxygen gas barrier property was evaluated by measuring the oxygen permeability under an atmosphere at a temperature of 20Â°C and a relative humidity of 85%, using an oxygen barrier measurement device (OX-TRAN 2/20) manufactured by Mocon, Inc. Using the measured results for the oxygen permeability of the gas barrier laminate and the substrate, the oxygen permeability of the formed layers comprising the gas barrier layer (II) and the overcoat layer (III) was calculated using the following formula,<br>
l/Pto,al-l/Pl+l/PlKIII<br>
In this formula,<br>
Ptotal (a measured value): the oxygen permeability of the gas barrier laminate (the laminated film)<br>
P1 (a measured value): the oxygen permeability of the plastic substrate (I)<br>
Pu+rn (a calculated value): the oxygen permeability of the formed layers comprising the gas barrier layer (II) and the overcoat layer (III)<br>
[0095] <lamination strength><br>
A test piece with dimensions of length: 100 mm x width: 15 mm was prepared from the obtained laminated product, and the lamination strength (X) was measured at a peel speed of 300 mm/minute using a T-type peel test, under conditions including a temperature of 20Â°C and a relative humidity of 65%.<br>
This laminated product was treated by immersion for 30 minutes in a hot water tank at 95Â°C, the lamination strength (Y) was then measured in a similar manner, and the ratio (Y)/(X) was determined.<br>
[0096] <example><br>
A PVA (Poval 105, manufactured by Kuraray Co., Ltd., (polyvinyl saponification degree: 98 to 99%, average polymerization degree: 500) was dissolved in hot water, and then cooled to room temperature, thus forming a PVA aqueous solution. An EMA (weight average molecular weight: 100,000, maleic acid units: 45 to 50%)) was dissolved in water, and an EMA aqueous solution was prepared by adding sufficient sodium hydroxide to neutralize 10 mol% of the carboxyl groups.<br>
The PVA aqueous solution and EMA aqueous solution were mixed together in quantities that yielded a solid fraction mass ratio of PVA to EMA of 30/70, thus yielding a gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C) with a solid fraction of 10% by mass.<br><br>
Using a biaxially stretched nylon film (tmblem UN, manutactured by Umtika, Ltd., thickness: 15Âµm) as the plastic substrate (I), the above gas barrier layer-forming coating material (C) was applied to the nylon film using a bar coater No. 4, was subsequently dried for 2 minutes at 80Â°C using a hot-air dryer, and was then subjected to further drying and a heat treatment for 20 seconds at 200Â°C using a hot-air dryer, thus forming a coating (a gas barrier layer (II)) with a thickness of approximately 0.5Âµm.<br>
Using an aqueous dispersion of a polyurethane resin with a film elongation of 640% (Superflex 470, manufactured by Dai-ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd.), and a polyisocyanate compound (HW-100, manufactured by BASF Corporation) as a cross-linking agent, these components were mixed together using the blend ratio shown in Table 1, thus yielding a polyurethane-based coating material with a solid fraction concentration of 10% by mass. To this coating material was added a predetermined quantity of a metal salt shown in Table 1 (lithium hydroxide), thereby forming an overcoat layer-forming coating material (F-1),<br>
The overcoat layer-forming coating material (F-1) was applied to the surface of the above gas barrier layer (II) using a bar coater No. 8, was subsequently dried for 2 minutes at 80Â°C using a hot-air dryer, and was then subjected to further drying and a heat treatment for 1 minute at 130Â°C using a hot-air dryer, thus forming a coating (an overcoat layer (III)) with a thickness of approximately `.0Âµm, and yielding a gas barrier laminate with layers laminated in the order (I) (II) (III). The oxygen gas permeability of this gas barrier laminate was measured.<br>
A dry laminator was used to coat the surface of layer (III) of the gas barrier laminate with a sufficient quantity of a coating agent (a mixture of products manufactured by Mitsui Takeda Chemical Co., Ltd., in which Takelac A515 / Takenate A50 is equal to 10/1 (mass ratio)) to form a dried film thickness of 3 Âµm, thus forming a laminate adhesive layer (IV). This adhesive layer (IV) was then bonded to a heat seal layer (V) (LLDPE, TUX-FCD manufactured by Tohcello Co., Ltd., thickness: 50 Âµm), and aging was conducted for 3 days at 40Â°C, thereby curing the adhesive layer (IV) and generating a laminated product in which the layers were laminated in the order (I) (II) (III) (IV) (V). The lamination strength of this laminated product was measured.<br>
[0097] <examples to comparative examples><br>
With the exception of altering the composition of the overcoat layer-forming coating material (F) as shown in Table 1, gas barrier laminates and laminated products were prepared in the same manner as the example 1. The resins used were all<br><br>
polyurethane resins (from the Superflex series, manufactured by Dai-ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd.).<br>
[0098] <example><br>
With the exception of altering the metal salt to a zinc oxide aqueous dispersion (ZW-143, manufactured by Sumitomo Osaka Cement Co., Ltd.), a gas barrier laminate and a laminated product were obtained in the same manner as the example 15.<br>
[0099] <example><br>
Vylon 630 (a polyester polyol resin, manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd., Tg: 7Â°C, number average molecular weight: 23,000) was added to a solvent comprising toluene/MEK = 8/2 (mass ratio), and the resulting mixture was stirred and heated for 1 hour at 80Â°C, yielding a resin solution with a sohd fraction of 30% by mass. This Vylon 630 resin solution and a polyisocyanate (BXX4773, manufactured by Toyo Ink Mfg. Co., Ltd.) as a cross-linking agent were mixed together using the blend ratio shown in Table 1, a 1% by mass ethyl acetate solution of dioctyltin laurate (STAN SNT-IF, manufactured by Sankyo Organic Chemicals Co., Ltd.) was added as a catalyst, and toluene was also added, yielding a polyester-based coating material with a solid fraction concentration of 10% by mass.<br>
To a suspended toluene solution of a magnesium oxide powder (average particle size: 3.5Âµ m, crystallite diameter: 0.01 Âµ m, BET specific surface area: 145 mVg) was added sufficient quantity of a dispersant (decaglycerol oleic acid ester, HLB = 7) to provide 25 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the magnesium oxide, and following stirring with a stirrer, the mixture was dispersed using a beads mill. The resulting magnesium oxide dispersed solution with a solid fraction of 20% by mass was added to the above coating material in a quantity (a solid fraction quantity) shown in Table 1, thereby forming an overcoat layer-forming coating material (F-2).<br>
With the exception of using the overcoat layer-forming coating material (F-2) instead of the overcoat layer-forming coating material (F-1) from the example 1, a gas barrier laminate and a laminated product were obtained in the same manner as the example 1.<br>
[0100] <example><br>
With the exception of using a calcium hydroxide dispersed solution prepared using a calcium hydroxide powder (average particle size: 3 to 8Âµ m, BET specific surface area:<br><br>
20 m2/g) instead of the magnesium oxide powder of the example 18, a gas barrier laminate and a laminated product were obtained in the same manner as the example 18.<br>
[0101] <examples and comparative example><br>
With the exception of altering the polyester resin as shown in Table 1, gas barrier laminates and laminated products were obtained in the same manner as the example 18. The resins used were all polyester polyol resins (from the Vylon series, manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.), as listed below.<br>
Vylon GK-140 (Tg: 20Â°C, number average molecular weight: 13,000)<br>
Vylon GK-590 (Tg: 15Â°C, number average molecular weight: 7,000)<br>
Vylon 200 (Tg: 67Â°C, number average molecular weight: 17,000)<br>
[0102] <example><br>
An aqueous ink (Aquaecol white ink, manufactured by Toyo Ink Mfg. Co., Ltd.) was printed onto the surface of the gas barrier laminate obtained in the example 18 using a bar coater No. 4, and was then dried for 30 seconds at 50Â°C using a hot-air dryer, thereby yielding a gas barrier laminate having a printing ink layer.<br>
Using the same technique as the example 1, a laminate adhesive layer (IV) and a heat seal layer (V) were formed on top of the printing ink layer of this gas barrier laminate having a printing ink layer, thereby yielding a laminated product with the layers laminated in the order (I) (II) (III) (printing ink layer) (IV) (V).<br>
[0103]<br>
The results of measuring the film elongation of the resins used in the examples and comparative examples, the oxygen gas permeability for each of the prepared gas barrier laminates, and the lamination strength for each of the laminated products are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0104]<br><br><br><br>
(Note 1): Solid fraction ratio between resin and cross-linking agent. (Note 2): Quantity (or solid fraction quantity in the case of a dispersion) relative to 100 parts by mass of the combined solid fraction of resin and cross-linking agent. (Note 3): Only the laminated product of the example 22 includes a printing ink layer.<br>
[0105]<br>
The gas barrier laminates obtained in the above examples all exhibited favorable gas barrier properties, and all yielded a laminated product with superior lamination strength. In contrast, in the comparative examples 1 to 4, and the comparative example 6, although the gas barrier properties for each of the prepared laminates were favorable, satisfactory lamination strength could not be obtained when a laminated product was formed. In the comparative example 5, because the coating material (F) contained no metal compound, there was no loss in the lamination strength of the laminated product, but the gas barrier properties of the laminate were inferior.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
