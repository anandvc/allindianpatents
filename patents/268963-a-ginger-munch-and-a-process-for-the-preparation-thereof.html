				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION: -<br>
The invention relates to a ginger munch and a process for the preparation thereof. Particularly the ginger munch of the present invention is a ready to eat product; has a long shelf life, rich in vitamin C and can serve as a bio-activator. Further, it is a chewable product and helps enhancing absorption of other desirable components thereby acts as an appetizer for personnel particularly those facing the problem of loss in appetite. The munch of the present invention also acts as health food particularly at high altitude where the rate of overall metabolic processes gets reduced. Specifically the munch with all its ingredients also helps in improved liver functioning through enhanced bile production, increase in hemoglobin, enhanced digestion, brain soothing and source of added energy. The invention also provides a process for preparation of ginger munch. The process is simple does not require any special infrastructure or operating conditions. Further the process helps retaining all the valuable nutritional and medicinal properties. Prior art:<br>
Ginger flavoured candies and toffees containing ginger only to the extent of less than one percent/traces, mainly as a flavouring component, are commercially available in the market.<br>
CN 1415223 granted to Liu Mengrong teaches a pepper ginger toffee prepared from pepper, ginger, granular white sugar, maltose, buttermilk powder, edible gelatin through vacuum drying, superfine pulverizing proportionally mixing with other ingredients stirring and granulating. The toffee is supposed to be effective to prevent and treat cold.<br>
CN 1465375 relates to a fresh ginger sucking candy made of fresh ginger and xylose. The candy claims to quickly eliminates halitosis and abnormal smell of oral cavity.<br>
WO 02/080682 discloses anti-inflammatory herbal composition for oral or topical application having in effective amount of a post supercritical carbon dioxide alcoholic extract of ginger as one of the ingredient. It appears that the process requires  stringent operational  conditions  and special infrastructure.<br>
Yanzhong reported ginger-honey beverage for preventing cold, bronchitis (Pat. No. CN 1421161, 2003). The beverage is prepared with date and ginger extractive liquid, brown sugar and water through a process of slow eating to get the decoction. The limitation of the process is the less stability because of water extract. Yet another disadvantage is the brown colour drink, which is unappealing to the consumer. Still another disadvantage is having only water extract of ginger which have lesser strength properties but claimed many functions.<br>
Zhang Yunpeng, has patented a ginger-sugar beverage for better health (Pat. No.CN1423975, 2003). The process is the preparation of beverage using sugar and ginger, which as a drink has the less stability during storage. The limitation is that the beverage can serve as a freshly made drink. Yet another disadvantage is the lack of colour to the drink. Still other disadvantage is low level of ginger, which exerts little functionalities.<br>
Prakash et al (Patent No. CA2378890, 2003) have patented sugarcane juice spread with ginger and cumin flavours. The concentration process<br>
of juice has lead to the higher brix to get a jelly spread. The limitation is<br>
the dark colour and a very common process is adopted. Root and flower<br>
powder based dry beverage for improved, biologically active properties<br>
have been patented by Kokhtala (Pat. NO. PU2204923). Along with many<br>
plant roots and flowers and spices, ginger is also used at about 3-7%<br>
level. Though it adds to the taste, but has decreased active properties.<br>
The disadvantage is the not likable smell of the product because of more<br>
plant roots.<br>
Theuer (USP 6051235, 2000) has patented ginger containing baby food<br>
preparation reducing gastro-esophageal reflux in infants.<br>
Mainly, the use of ginger in infant foods in what levels is of concern<br>
since ginger comes under hot foods or heat generating components class.<br>
The disadvantage is that in infants it may cause constipation problems.<br>
Vasquez (USP 6743461, 2001) has patented a composition as a substitute<br>
for table salt, which also contains ginger oil.<br>
The limitation is that it is an ingredient used in place of salt but not a<br>
wholesome product, which can be readily consumed.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is the presence of rice flour in the composition,<br>
which leads to undesirable flavour during storage.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the product is far away from naturality.<br>
Foreman   (USP   6399114,   2002)   patented   the   nutritional   system   for<br>
nervous   disorders,   which   also   contain   ginger   root   as   one   of   the<br>
components. The process is mainly the mixing of all synthetic vitamins,<br>
minerals and fructo-oligo-saccharides.<br>
The disadvantage is that the product is synthetic with the ginger root.<br>
The limitation is that it is considered as a medicine but not the food.<br>
Changyun Jiang (Patent No.  CN108484) reported the use of ginger in<br>
nutritive fruit - vegetable based essence for whetting one's appetite.<br>
There is a need for ready to eat tasty, nutritional, mouthwatering ginger<br>
product   having   high   concentration   of   ginger,   long   storage   ability,<br>
acceptability  by  the  consumer,   useful  as  health   food  and  useful  as<br>
alternative medicine system particularly at high altitude.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a ginger munch<br>
with  added  value  and  a  process  that  obviates  the  drawbacks  of the<br>
relevant existing products and processes.<br>
The other object of the invention is to provide a ginger munch as a ready<br>
to eat product; has a long shelf life, rich in vitamin C and can serve as a<br>
bio-activator. Another object of the invention is to provide a chewable<br>
ginger   munch,   which   helps   enhancing   absorption   of  other   desirable<br>
components thereby acts as an appetizer for personnel particularly those<br>
facing the problem of loss in appetite.<br>
Yet  other  object  of this   invention  is  to  provide   a  munch  that  acts<br>
additionally as health food particularly at high altitude where the rate of<br>
overall metabolic processes gets reduced.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a munch, which helps<br>
in improved liver functioning through enhanced bile production, increase<br>
in hemoglobin, enhanced digestion, and brain soothing. It also may serve<br>
as a source of added energy.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS:<br>
The present invention provides a ginger munch that is ready-to-eat tasty, flavoured, causes appetite and also serves as health food. Dates that are used as one of the ingredients provide a source of fibre and works for brain soothing effect. Raisins and honey improve the liver functioning as well as add to calorie. Almonds, though are calorie dense, provide flavour and functional fatty acids. Nutmeg javitry cardamom are generally used, either in isolation or in combination, as flavouring agents However,  cardamom  is  preferred  one  due  to  its  additional  role  as  a<br>
digestive. Red sugar used imparts property that avoids flame formation. Thus, the strengthful ingredients with functional properties have been used for achieving the end product with effectiveness of causing appetite. Ginger is well known for its medicinal properties and thus found in alternative medicine system. However the munch prepared using rhizome of ginger is useful as health food in addition to a tasty product. The presence of ginger imparts the stimulating effect on the digestive system and also contributes to the flavour of the product. The most important feature of invention is to produce the product-process to obtain a ready-to-eat, consumer acceptable, with a specific functionality of causing appetite with-a shelf stability of 10-12 months. According to present invention, a ready-to-eat, chewable munch based on ginger and other functional ingredients with a process for shelf stable product has been provided. The ingredient comprise of ginger, raisins, dates, almond, honey, red sugar, jaggery and ghee. The process of frying of the ingredients results in good flavour generation. Preparation of ingredients:<br>
Deshelled and almonds (2-3 kgs) and cleaned raisins (2-3 kgs) and dekerneled dates (4-5 kgs) were fried in pure ghee (2 litres) at a temperature of 130-140°C for about 60-80 sec to get a pleasing coloured fried product. After cooling, the fried products are kept at 5 -7 °C for about 20-30 minutes to facilitate grinding. All these were ground separately using a mixer-grinder. Cardamom is decorticated and the seeds  (1-2  kgs)  are powdered with about 0.2  kg  sugar to  get a  fine<br>
powder.   Quality   ginger   powder,   honey,   jaggery   and   red   sugar   are procured form the market. Preparation of ginger munch:<br>
Jaggery, 25-35 g wt% preferably 32% and red sugar, 6-10 g wt% are dissolved in just minimum quantity of water by heating and syrup is filtered to eliminate the impurities if any. To the syrup in the pan, almond powder, ginger powder, honey at 6-10 g wt%, dates powder 12-18 g wt%, cardamom 2-4%, raisin paste 7-10 g %wt and ghee 8-11 g %wt are added while stirring the contents of the pan and heated on a medium flame to concentrate at a temperature of 95-110°C. Heating continued for about 25-30 min to get a final consistency of one lump product and the whole processed material is poured on a plate greased with ghee. After cooling cut into 20 g pieces of munch, make oval shape and packed in cellophane followed by Al. foil.<br>
The   invention   is   further   illustrated   with   the   help   of  non-limiting examples.  Any alteration  in preparing the munch known to  a  skilled person is covered in the scope of the claimed protection accrued by this invention EXAMPLE 1;<br>
1 kg of whole diluted almond nuts and raisins were procured from market and cleaned. Further they were fried in pure ghee at temperature of 130-140°C for about 60-90 sec. respectively. 1 kg of dry dates was decorticated and seeds were discarded. The halved dates were fried at 130-140°C for about 90-120 seconds. Then all these were allowed to cool to room temperature and ground separately in a mixer grinder. Cardamom<br>
was decorticated and the seeds (1-2 kgs) were powdered with about 0.2 kg sugar to get a fine powder. Ginger powder was procured from market and was cleaned.<br>
For munch preparation first 92 g jaggery and 23 \g red sugar were dissolved in minimum quantity of water (just sufficient enough to dissolve the solids) by stirring and heating. Filtered for any impurities and then taken into an open pan. Then 50 g of ground dates, 25 g of ground almonds, 10 g of cardamom powder, 20 g honey, 20 g ginger powder, 22 g ground raisins and 30 g ghee were added one by one. Then all these things were mixed and concentrated by evaporation with continuous stirring and heating on medium flame. The time required for completion of this process to get a final product was approx. 25 minutes at around 95-110 °C. Then this material in the pan was poured in a tray greased with ghee. It was allowed to cool and further weighed and shaped in munches of about 20 g. This was wrapped in cellophane sheet and then in the aluminium wrapper. These munches were evaluated by a panel of 15 members and were scored on an average 7.6 on a 9 point hedonic scale while the % total sugars were 46.2.<br>
EXAMPLE 2:<br>
The raw materials - dates, almonds, raisins, cardamom, and ginger powder were prepared in the similar manner as in example 1. In this 113 g jaggery and 27.83 g red sugar were dissolved in minimum quantity of water (just sufficient enough to dissolve solids) by stirring and heating. The syrup was filtered for any impurities and taken into an open pan. Then 50 g ground dates, 25 g ground almonds, 10 g cardamom powder,<br>
25 g ginger powder, 28.5 g ground raisins, 20 g honey, 30 g ghee were added into it one by one. All these things were mixed and concentrated by evaporation with continuous stirring and heating on a medium flame. The time required for the process completion to get desired product was approx. 30 min. at around 95-100 °C. Then it was poured in a tray pre-greased with ghee. It was allowed to cool/ 20 g were weighed and shaped in the form of munch. Each munch was wrapped into cellophane sheet and then in aluminium wrapper. 90% yield was obtained at the end of the process. These munches were evaluated by a panel of 15 members and scored 7 on 9 point hedonic scale and % total sugars were 53.0. EXAMPLE 3;<br>
Raw materials were processed in similar manner as in example 1. For munch preparation 108 g jaggery and 27 g red sugar dissolved and filtered as in working example 1.<br>
The syrup was taken into open pan. Then 50 g ground dates, 25 g ground almonds, 10 g cardamom powder, 20 g ginger powder, 35 g ground raisins, 20 g honey, 30 g ghee were added in the pan one by one. All these materials were mixed and concentrated by evaporation with continuous stirring and heating on a medium flame. The time required for this process completion to get final product was 27 min (approx.) at around 95-100 °C. Then it was allowed to cool. About 90% yield was obtained. 20 g was weighed and shaped in the form of munches. Each munch was wrapped into cellophane sheet and then in aluminium wrapper. These munches were evaluated by a panel of 15 members and scored 6.9 on 9 point-hedonic scale while % total sugars were 32.3<br>
Thus, total 15 combinations were prepared and evaluated for sensory score and analysed for % total sugars. The effect of ingredient variation on these two responses (sensory score and % total sugar) was statistically analysed with design expert software using response surface methodology and the product was optimized to get the following final composition. All the ingredients are in weight %<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The sweetening (jaggery: red sugar, 4:1), ginger powder and raisins were independent variables with almonds, dates, cardamom and honey were fixed. The combinations were drawn and used for preparation of the product.<br>
