				<td>TITLE<br>
POROUS COMPOSITE ARTICLE<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Many enclosures require venting to an atmosphere external to an<br>
enclosure to relieve any pressure differential between the internal volume of<br>
the enclosure and the external atmosphere. Such venting may be required<br>
due to temperature fluctuations, altitude changes, and vapor pressure of liquid<br>
contained therein. Vents allow the flow of gas for pressure equalization while<br>
preventing the entry of liquid and particulate contamination. Market sectors<br>
which use porous materials as vents include, but are not limited to<br>
automotive, electronics, industrial, medical, and packaging. Expanded PTFE<br>
(ePTFE) is a known porous vent material in these applications. However,<br>
when these vent materials are exposed to viscous fluids of low surface<br>
tension, a loss in gas permeability may be observed. Residual liquid film or<br>
droplets remaining on the vent material may restrict the vent area available for<br>
gas flow. The fluid can dry and harden on the surface of the vent material,<br>
leaving an impermeable film layer on the entire surface, thereby rendering the<br>
vent inoperable by eliminating gas permeability. As used in this application,<br>
the term "gas permeability" means the property of a material having two sides<br>
allowing a gas to move from a first side to the second side when the material<br>
is subject to a differential pressure of such, gas across it. Air permeability, for<br>
example, can be characterized by Gurley number.<br>
There exists a need for a porous material that has adequate air flow<br>
after fluid exposure, especially in cases where the vent is exposed to a<br>
viscous fluid of low surface tension.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
In one aspect, a venting apparatus having an opening therein for<br>
venting an enclosure and for preventing passage of a liquid is provided. The<br>
venting apparatus comprises a porous composite venting element forming a<br>
gas-permeable barrier to said liquid, the porous composite venting element<br>
comprising a porous membrane having a structure defining a plurality of<br>
pores, extending therethrough, and a nonporous discontinuous surface<br>
coating. The nonporous discontinuous surface coating blocks at least some<br>
of the pores, whereby the porous composite surface has regions of gas<br>
permeability and regions of gas impermeability.<br>
In another aspect, a porous composite comprising a porous membrane<br>
having a structure defining a plurality of pores extending therethrough is<br>
provided. A nonporous discontinuous surface layer is affixed to the porous<br>
membrane, the nonporous discontinuous surface layer has rents, which form<br>
surface regions of gas permeability and surface regions of gas<br>
impermeablility. The porous composite has a coating which renders at least a<br>
portion of the surface oleophobic.<br>
In yet another aspect, a venting apparatus is provided. The venting<br>
apparatus has an opening therein for venting an enclosure and for preventing<br>
passage of a liquid, and comprising a porous composite venting element<br>
forming a gas-permeable barrier to the liquid. The porous composite venting<br>
element comprises a porous membrane having a structure defining a plurality<br>
of pores extending therethrough, and a nonporous discontinuous surface<br>
layer affixed to said porous membrane. The nonporous discontinuous surface<br>
layer has rents, whereby the nonporous discontinuous surface layer<br>
comprises regions of gas permeability corresponding to the rents.<br>
In a still further aspect, a venting apparatus is provided in which the<br>
venting apparatus has an opening therein for venting an enclosure. The<br>
enclosure defines an internal space and an external space, and the venting<br>
apparatus prevents passage of a liquid between the internal space and the<br>
external space. The venting apparatus comprises a porous composite<br>
venting element forming a liquid-tight, gas-permeable seal of the opening. The<br>
porous composite venting element has a liquid face adjacent to the liquid.<br>
The porous composite venting element comprises a porous membrane having<br>
a structure defining a plurality of pores extending therethrough and a<br>
nonporous discontinuous surface covering at least a portion of the liquid face<br>
of the porous membrane. The nonporous discontinuous surface blocks at<br>
least some of the pores and has openings therein to create surface regions of<br>
gas permeability and surface regions of gas impermeability.<br>
In another aspect, a venting apparatus has an opening therein for<br>
venting an enclosure and prevents passage of a liquid. The venting<br>
apparatus comprises a porous composite venting element that forms a gas-<br>
permeable barrier to a liquid. The porous composite venting element<br>
comprises a porous membrane having a first face and a second face opposite<br>
the first face, and a nonporous surface layer affixed to the first face of the<br>
porous membrane to form a liquid exposure face. The airflow recovery after<br>
liquid exposure to the liquid exposure face of the porous composite venting<br>
element exceeds the airflow recovery after liquid exposure to the second face<br>
of said porous composite venting element.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The porous composite articles described herein are useful as venting<br>
materials. They provide air flow even after exposure to viscous fluids of low<br>
surface tension. As used in this application, the term "viscous fluids of low<br>
surface tension' means fluids with a viscosity greater than 50 cP (Centipoise)<br>
and surface tension less than 35 mN/m. In applications that involve such<br>
fluids, these porous composite articles overcome disadvantages of known<br>
venting materials.<br>
In certain venting applications, gas permeability of the porous<br>
composite after exposure to viscous fluids of low surface tension is desired.<br>
Air flow after liquid exposure is referred to hereinafter as air flow recovery.<br>
Materials that have high air flow recovery after exposure to such fluids are<br>
particularly valuable. The porous composite articles described herein provide<br>
excellent air flow recovery after exposure to viscous fluids of low surface<br>
tension.<br>
The porous composite articles can be used in a venting apparatus. A<br>
venting apparatus may include a vent body having an opening therein to allow<br>
venting. The porous composite may be affixed to the body to form a liquid-<br>
tight, gas-permeable seal of the opening. The venting apparatus may be used<br>
in a liquid-tight enclosure. As used in this application, "liquid-tight" means a<br>
seal or enclosure that can withstand a water entry pressure of at least 0.5 psi<br>
without leakage. Examples include a container for enclosing liquids or an<br>
electronic enclosure as in computer disk-drives, automotive engine control<br>
units, or automotive head-lamps.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, venting apparatus 40 may include a vent body 42<br>
having a passageway 45 for a gas, and a venting element 43. Venting<br>
element 43 may form a gas permeable liquid-tight seal of passageway 45.<br>
The vent body 42 may take the form of an insert, cap, or a molded part.<br>
In other aspects, as represented in Fig. 2, an enclosure may have a vent body<br>
incorporated therein. In simple form, an enclosure may have an opening with<br>
a porous composite vent material sealed over it to provide venting.<br>
Preferably, the vent body is constructed from polymeric materials,<br>
which facilitate easy processing including heat sealing of the porous<br>
composite article to the body. This vent body may be constructed in various<br>
shapes and forms and installed in any orientation (vertical, horizontal, or<br>
inclined at an angle) on to the enclosure. The means for attachment of the<br>
vent body to the enclosure depends on the intended venting application.<br>
Exemplary attachment means include interference fittings, threads or<br>
adhesives. As such, the vent body may incorporate barbs, threads and the<br>
like to improve attachment.<br>
With reference to Fig. 3, the porous composite article 20 may be<br>
comprised of a porous membrane 22 having pores 23, a nonporous<br>
discontinuous surface layer 24 that is affixed to the porous membrane, and a<br>
coating 28 to provide oleophobic properties. The nonporous discontinuous<br>
surface layer 24 blocks at least some of the pores 23 of the porous membrane<br>
but has discrete, distributed openings 29 which provide regions of gas<br>
permeability. The nonporous discontinuous surface layer improves the air flow<br>
recovery of the composite after exposure to viscous fluids of low surface<br>
tension. The porous composite can be rendered oleophobic by application of<br>
a polymeric coating 28 such that the oil rating of the composite is greater than<br>
about 2.<br>
Figs. 4 through 7 are scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of<br>
representative porous composites. The porous membrane 22 has a structure<br>
comprising a plurality of pores 23. The porous membrane can be any porous<br>
material that has pores which render the membrane gas permeable. Porous<br>
membranes may include but are not limited to, Polyethylene, Polypropylene,<br>
Polysulfone, Polyethersulfone, Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF), Cellulose<br>
Acetate, Polycarbonate, Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE),<br>
and preferably expanded PTFE. The expanded PTFE membranes made in<br>
accordance with the teachings in U.S. Patent No. 3,953,566 to Gore are<br>
particularly useful. These porous membranes can be uni-axially, bi-axially or<br>
radially expanded.<br>
The nonporous discontinuous surface layer 24 is affixed to the porous<br>
membrane 22 and may provide a discontinuous surface blocking at least<br>
some of the pores 23 of the porous membrane 22 at the membrane surface,<br>
whereby the porous composite surface has regions of gas permeability and<br>
regions of gas impermeability. The nonporous discontinuous surface layer 24<br>
can be made from a wide range of materials including but not limited to<br>
thermoplastic materials, thermoset materials, and elastomeric materials.<br>
Thermoplastic materials are preferred and may include but are not limited to<br>
Polyester, Polyethylene, Polypropylene, Vinylidene Fluoride,<br>
tetrafluoroethylene/ hexafluoropropylene copolymers (FEP),<br>
tetrafluoroethylene/ perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether copolymers (PFA),<br>
chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE), and THV (polymer of tetrafluoroethylene,<br>
hexaffuoropropylene, vinylidene fluoride). Fluorinated thermoplastic materials<br>
such as FEP or PFA are particularly preferred.<br>
In one embodiment illustrated by Figs. 4 and 5, the nonporous<br>
discontinuous surface layer 24 is a fluorinated thermoplastic that is laminated<br>
to a PTFE tape and then co-expanded. Upon expansion, the fluorinated<br>
thermoplastic fractures to form a plurality of discrete rents 26. In another<br>
embodiment illustrated in Fig. 8, the nonporous discontinuous surface layer<br>
24 comprises a nonporous film 27 having perforations 25. The perforated film<br>
is affixed to the porous membrane layer to form a porous composite.<br>
In a further embodiment illustrated in Fig. 7, the nonporous<br>
discontinuous surface layer 24 comprises a coating of a thermoplastic<br>
material. The coating forms a nonporous discontinuous surface layer 24<br>
having openings 29 upon the porous membrane 22. The coating blocks some<br>
of the pores 23 to create regions of gas impermeability on the surface of the<br>
porous composite.<br>
The porous composites can be rendered oleophobic, thereby making<br>
them applicable in certain venting applications which require resistance to<br>
viscous fluids of low surface tension. As used in this application, the term<br>
"oleophobic" means an article with an AATCC Test Method 118-2002 oil<br>
rating of greater than about 2. For example, the porous composite may be<br>
coated with a solution of perfluorodioxole polymer as described in US Patent<br>
No. 5,116,650. The coating may also be applied to at least one of the<br>
elements of the porous composite before affixing them together. For<br>
example, the porous membrane may be treated with a coating solution to<br>
provide oleophobicity before the nonporous discontinuous layer is affixed or<br>
applied to it.<br>
A nonporous surface layer may be formed by a process of lamination<br>
and co-expansion. A nonporous thermoplastic film may be laminated to PTFE<br>
and subsequently expanded to form a composite of ePTFE membrane and a<br>
nonporous discontinuous surface layer comprised of fluorinated thermoplastic.<br>
This process may result in the thermoplastic film fracturing to form rents 26 as<br>
shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The thermoplastic may be laminated to the ePTFE by<br>
passing the ePTFE and thermoplastic over a surface, such as a roller or plate<br>
that is heated to above the melt temperature of the thermoplastic to bond<br>
them. The bonded layers can then be expanded uni-axially, bi-axially or<br>
radially to form the rents in the thermoplastic surface. The nonporous<br>
discontinuous surface layer 24 of polymer in this embodiment can be as thin<br>
as 0.5 micron. In a preferred embodiment, FEP is laminated to PTFE and<br>
then the laminate is expanded to form a porous composite.<br>
With reference to Fig. 8, the nonporous discontinuous surface layer 24<br>
may also be formed by perforating a nonporous film and then bonding it to a<br>
porous membrane. The preferred nonporous discontinuous surface layer is<br>
polymeric and may comprise a fluorinated thermoplastic film layer such as<br>
FEP or PFA. The nonporous polymeric film layer can be perforated using any<br>
conventional method, including but not limited to mechanical perforation, or<br>
laser drilling. The preferred method is laser drilling. The perforated<br>
nonporous discontinuous surface layer can then be affixed to a porous<br>
membrane through any conventional method including but not limited to, hot<br>
roll lamination, adhesive bonding, or ultrasonic bonding. In another aspect,<br>
the perforated nonporous film may be affixed to the PTFE and can be<br>
subsequently expanded.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 8, a 12.5 micrometer thick sheet of<br>
FEP was perforated using a 50 watt laser machine from Universal Laser<br>
Systems Inc. (Scottsdale, AZ). The perforations 25 were 0.76 mm in<br>
diameter, and the center-center distance between perforations was 1.02 mm.<br>
The perforated FEP layer may then be bonded to a porous ePTFE membrane<br>
to form the porous composite.<br>
Regardless of form or method of construction, the nonporous<br>
discontinuous surface layer forms a surface over the porous membrane layer<br>
such that some of the pores of the porous membrane are blocked. The<br>
nonporous discontinuous surface layer thus has a discontinuous surface with<br>
openings therein, whereby the porous composite has regions of gas<br>
permeability and regions of gas impermeability. The size and shape of the<br>
openings in the nonporous discontinuous surface layer can vary considerably.<br>
The porous composite articles may be used as a venting element in<br>
venting enclosures. The venting element may be advantageously used to<br>
form a liquid-tight seal in an enclosure for containing or excluding liquids. The<br>
venting element provides gas permeability necessary for gas expansion, off-<br>
gassing of chemicals, and the like. As shown in Fig. 2, venting apparatus 40<br>
may be constructed to have a liquid exposure side 41 and an opposite side<br>
47. A nonporous discontinuous surface layer 24 may be disposed upon the<br>
porous membrane 22 to construct a liquid exposure side 41 of the porous<br>
composite 20. The liquid exposure side 41 may be oriented towards the<br>
interior of an enclosure 32 containing a liquid 38. In these applications (e.g.<br>
liquid detergent containers) the liquid is contained, yet the porous composite<br>
provides gas permeability. The gas permeability may prevent enclosure<br>
deformation or rupture due to thermal cycling, or allow for off gassing of the<br>
liquid. In an alternate embodiment illustrated in Fig. 10, in which liquid entry is<br>
to be prevented, the liquid exposure side 41 may be oriented towards the<br>
outside of the enclosure 32. The opposite side 47 is oriented towards the<br>
inside of the enclosure. In such applications, (e.g. electronics enclosures or<br>
lighting enclosures) the porous composite may provide gas permeability while<br>
preventing liquid entry into the enclosure. In yet another construction<br>
illustrated schematically in Fig. 9, both sides of the porous composite may be<br>
constructed as liquid exposure sides.<br>
Preferably, the air flow recovery of the liquid exposure side exceeds<br>
the air flow recovery of the opposite side by a value of at least 1.1%. More<br>
preferably, the air flow recovery of the liquid exposure side exceeds the air<br>
flow recovery of the opposite side by a value of at least 5%. In embodiments<br>
in which the porous composite has two liquid exposure sides, it is preferable<br>
that the air flow recovery of the porous composite exceeds the air flow<br>
recovery of the porous membrane alone by at least about 5%.<br>
In an embodiment, the porous oleophobic composite may have an air<br>
flow recovery of at least about 33% when the liquid exposure side of the<br>
composite is exposed to viscous fluid of low surface tension. The airflow<br>
recovery of this composite when the same viscous fluid of low surface tension<br>
is exposed to the opposite side is 0%. More preferably, the porous composite<br>
has an air flow recovery of at least about 50% when the liquid exposure side<br>
of the composite is exposed to viscous fluid of low surface tension. The<br>
airflow recovery of this composite when the same viscous fluid of low surface<br>
tension is exposed to the opposite side is 0%.<br>
In another embodiment, the porous composite has an air flow<br>
recovery of 4% when the liquid exposure side of the composite is exposed to<br>
viscous fluid of low surface tension. The airflow recovery of the porous<br>
composite when the same viscous fluid of low surface tension is exposed to<br>
the opposite side is 0.4%. More preferably, the porous composite has an air<br>
flow recovery of 12% when the liquid exposure side of the composite is<br>
exposed to viscous fluid of low surface tension. The airflow recovery of the<br>
porous composite when the same viscous fluid of low surface tension is<br>
exposed to the opposite side is 0.1%.<br>
The porous composite can be constructed as a laminate. The laminate<br>
may be constructed by supporting the porous composite 20 on a support layer<br>
30, as shown in Fig. 3. Support layer 30 provides structural support and may<br>
also aid in attachment of the porous composite 20 to venting enclosure 32 as<br>
shown in Fig. 10. Suitable support layers can be in the form of air permeable<br>
media like knits, non-wovens, scrims, melt-blowns, woven fabrics, meshes,<br>
foams, porous ePTFE membranes, etc. Support layers may be affixed to the<br>
porous composite by, for example, hot-roll lamination, adhesives, or ultrasonic<br>
bonding. The support layer may be affixed to either side of the porous<br>
composite.<br>
The present invention will be further described with respect to the non-<br>
limiting examples provided below.<br>
Test Methods<br>
Density<br>
Samples die cut to form rectangular sections 2.54 cm by 15.24 cm<br>
were measured to determine their mass (using a Mettler-Toledo analytical<br>
balance model AG204) and their thickness (using a Kafer FZ1000/30 snap<br>
gauge). Using these data, density was calculated with the following formula:<br><br>
in which: p = density (g/cc); m = mass (g); w = width (cm); I = length (cm); and<br>
t = thickness (cm).<br>
Porosity<br>
Porosity was expressed in percent porosity and was determined by<br>
subtracting the quotient of the density of the article (described earlier herein)<br>
and that of the bulk density of PTFE from 1, then multiplying that value by<br>
100%. For the purposes of this calculation, the bulk density of PTFE was<br>
taken to be 2.2 g/cc<br>
Air Flow Recovery<br>
Figs 11 and 11a illustrate the apparatus used for airflow recovery<br>
testing. Vent material 100 is sealed between upper plate 102 and lower plate<br>
104. The plates each include an orifice of diameter 2.54cm. The upper plate<br>
incorporates a liquid well 106. The vent material 100 is secured between the<br>
plates using a gasket 108 and thumb screws 110. The assembled plates are<br>
then secured in an adapter 300 by means of clamps 302, thumb screws 304<br>
and a gasket 306. Adapter 300 includes an air chamber 301 and channel 310<br>
for delivering air to it. A Telydyne Genuine Gurley™ tester (Model Number<br>
4110) is attached to the inlet port 312 of the adapter 300 using the gasket<br>
308.<br>
100 cm3 of air is delivered to the sample at a pressure of 12.4 cm of<br>
water and the flow time recorded in seconds. This measurement is Gurley<br>
(seconds) before fluid contact.<br>
The plate is then removed from the adapter and the vent material is<br>
exposed to test fluid by filling liquid well 106 such that the entire surface of the<br>
vent material is covered by the fluid. This can be done by using a transfer<br>
pipette to add about 2 to 3 cm3 of test fluid to the well 106. After 60 seconds,<br>
the plate assembly was tilted ninety degrees. The liquid is allowed to drain off<br>
from the vent material for 60 seconds. The plate is then secured in the<br>
adapter 300 which is affixed to the Telydyne Genuine Gurley™ tester (Model<br>
Number 4110).<br>
100 cm3 of air is allowed to flow through the sample at a pressure of<br>
12.4 cm of water and the flow time recorded in seconds. This measurement is<br>
Gurley (seconds) after fluid contact. In cases where airflow did not start after<br>
ten minutes in this test, the test was stopped and samples were considered<br>
not to recover as denoted by NR for no recovery of airflow. The percentage air<br>
flow recovery is then determined by using the equation:<br><br>
Water Entry Pressure<br>
As used in this application, the term "water entry pressure" means the<br>
pressure required to drive water through a material, such as a membrane, as<br>
further described in the test methods contained herein. Water entry pressure<br>
provides a test method for water intrusion through membranes or vent bodies.<br>
The membrane (or vent body) is placed in a fixture and pressurized with<br>
water. A piece of pH paper may be placed on top of the membrane (or vent<br>
body) on the non-pressurized side as an indicator of evidence for water entry.<br>
The sample is then pressurized in small increments, until a color change in<br>
the pH paper indicates the first sign of water entry. The water pressure at<br>
breakthrough or entry is recorded as the Water Entry Pressure.<br>
Bubble Point<br>
The bubble point and mean flow pore size were measured according to<br>
the general teachings of ASTM F31 6-03 using a Capillary Flow Porometer<br>
(Model CFP 1500 AEXL from Porous Materials Inc., Ithaca, NY). The sample<br>
membrane was placed into the sample chamber and wet with SilWick Silicone<br>
Fluid (available from Porous Materials Inc.) having a surface tension of 19.1<br>
dynes/cm. The bottom clamp of the sample chamber had a 2.54 cm<br>
diameter, 3.175 mm thick porous metal disc insert (Mott Metallurgical,<br>
Farmington, CT, 40 micron porous metal disk) and the top clamp of the<br>
sample chamber had a 3.175 mm diameter hole. Using the Capwin software<br>
version 6.62.1 the following parameters were set as specified in the table<br>
immediately below. The values presented for bubble point and mean flow<br>
pore size were the average of two measurements.<br>
Oil Rating<br>
Oil rating testing was conducted in accordance with AATCC Test<br>
Method 118-2002. The oil rating of a membrane is the lower of the two<br>
ratings obtained when testing the two sides of the membrane.<br>
Surface Tension<br>
Surface tension of the challenge fluid was measured using a Kruss K12<br>
tensiometer using the Whilhelmy plate method. Kruss Laboratory Desktop<br>
Software Version 2.13a was used. Whilhelmy plate immersions were<br>
conducted with flamed glass cover slips and the software default dip<br>
parameters.<br>
Viscosity<br>
Viscosity was measured using a Brookfield DVII+ viscometer with a UL<br>
low volume spindle and tube accessory. Viscosities are reported in centipoise<br>
(cP) for a temperature of 22.5 degrees Celcius, at 30 RPM, and a shear rate of<br>
36.7 second-1. Viscosities were read after five minutes at 30 RPM for<br>
samples which had previously been run at the maximum RPM allowed by<br>
torque.<br>
Challenge Fluids<br>
Two representative challenge fluids were formulated and used for air<br>
flow recovery testing after fluid exposure. Properties of these fluids are listed<br>
in the table below. Challenge Fluid I was used for oleophobic articles with an<br>
oil rating of greater than about 2. Challenge Fluid II was used for hydrophobic<br>
articles.<br>
Challenge Fluid I was prepared in the following manner:<br>
A solution of PVP (Polyvinylpyrrolidone, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical,<br>
Catalog Number 437190-500G, Molecular Weight = 1,300,000, CAS Number<br>
9003-39-8), and De-ionized water was prepared by mixing the two<br>
components and allowing them to stir overnight. Tergitol®TMN6 (Dow<br>
Chemical, CAS Number 60828-78-6) was added and the solution was allowed<br>
to stir for about one hour and then used immediately for testing.<br>
Challenge Fluid II was prepared in the following manner:<br>
A solution of Tween® (Mallinckrodt Baker, Inc., Catalog Number X257-<br>
07, CAS Number 9005-65-6), and De-ionized water was prepared by mixing<br>
the two components and allowing them to stir overnight. Glycerol (Ultra Pure<br>
Grade, MP Biomedicals, Catalog Number 800688) was added and the<br>
solution was allowed to stir for about one hour and then used immediately for<br>
testing.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Fine powder of PTFE polymer (Daikin Industries, Ltd., Orangeburg,<br>
NY) was blended with Isopar K (Exxon Mobil Corp., Fairfax, VA) in the<br>
proportion of 0.25 g/g of fine powder. The lubricated powder was compressed<br>
in a cylinder to form a pellet and placed into an oven set at 25°C for<br>
approximately 24 hours. Compressed and heated pellets were ram extruded<br>
to produce tapes approximately 29 cm wide by 0.635 mm thick. The tape was<br>
then calendared between compression rolls to a thickness of 0.20 mm. The<br>
tape was then dried in an oven set at 250°C. The dry PTFE tape and a 12.5<br>
urn thick FEP film were layered together and longitudinally expanded between<br>
banks of rolls over two heated plates set to a temperature of 300°C. The<br>
speed ratio between the second bank of rolls and the first bank of rolls, and<br>
hence the expansion ratio on the first plate, was 1.15:1. The speed ratio<br>
between the third bank of rolls and the second bank of rolls, and hence the<br>
expansion ratio on the second plate, was 1.15:1. The composite FEP<br>
laminated PTFE tape was then longitudinally expanded 5:1, through a hot air<br>
oven set to a temperature of 320°C. The FEP film bonded to the PTFE tape<br>
as it melted and as the two layers expanded, rents were formed in the FEP<br>
film. The longitudinally expanded composite was then heat treated through a<br>
hot air oven set to a temperature of 360°C. The composite was then<br>
expanded transversely at a temperature of approximately 370°C to a ratio of<br>
approximately 7:1 and then constrained and heated in an oven set at 370°C<br>
for approximately 24 seconds.<br>
The porous composite thus produced had a Bubble Point of 6.9 psi.<br>
Both sides of the composite were tested for air flow recovery with challenge<br>
fluid II. Results are shown in Table I.<br>
The composite was treated to render it oleophobic according to the<br>
following procedure. A solution was prepared by adding 0.25 weight percent<br>
of Teflon AF 1600 (Dupont Fluoroproducts, Wilmington, DE) to PF-5070<br>
Brand Performance Fluid (CAS Number 86508-42-1, 3M) and allowing the<br>
fluid to mix overnight. The composite sample was held taut in an embroidery<br>
hoop (15.2 cm diameter). A pipette was then used to apply 5 to 6 cm3 of the<br>
above solution to the (liquid exposure side) of the composite sample. The<br>
composite sample was tilted and rotated such that the solution completely<br>
saturated the sample. At this point, the sample became transparent and was<br>
visibly wet throughout. The hoop was immediately hung vertically in a hood<br>
and allowed to dry overnight. Both sides of the oleophobic composite were<br>
then tested for air flow recovery using Challenge Fluid I. The results obtained<br>
are shown in Table I. The oil rating was measured to be 5.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Fine powder of PTFE polymer (Daikin Industries, Ltd., Orangeburg,<br>
NY) was blended with Isopar K (Exxon Mobil Corp., Fairfax, VA) in the<br>
proportion of 0.196 g/g of fine powder. The lubricated powder was<br>
compressed in a cylinder to form a pellet and placed into an oven set at 70°C<br>
for approximately 12 hours. Compressed and heated pellets were ram<br>
extruded to produce tapes approximately 15.2 cm wide by 0.73 mm thick.<br>
Two separate rolls of tape were produced and layered together between<br>
compression rolls to a thickness of 0.254 mm. The tape was then<br>
transversely stretched to 56 cm (i.e., at a ratio of 3.7:1), then dried in an oven<br>
set at 250°C. The dry tape was longitudinally expanded between banks of<br>
rolls over a heated plate set to a temperature of 340°C. A 12.5 micron thick<br>
FEP film was layered onto the PTFE tape prior to expansion over the plate.<br>
The speed ratio between the second bank of rolls and the first bank of rolls,<br>
and hence the expansion ratio, was 14:1. The FEP film bonded to the PTFE<br>
tape as it melted and as the two layers expanded, rents were formed in the<br>
FEP film. The longitudinally expanded composite was then expanded<br>
transversely at a temperature of approximately 350°C to a ratio of<br>
approximately 20:1 and then constrained and heated in an oven set at 380°C<br>
for approximately 24 seconds.<br>
The porous composite thus produced had a Bubble Point of 30 psi.<br>
Both sides of the composite were tested for air flow recovery with challenge<br>
fluid II. Results are shown in Table II.<br>
The composite was treated to render it oleophobic according to the<br>
following procedure. A solution was prepared by adding 0.25 weight percent<br>
of Teflon AF 1600 (Dupont Fluoroproducts, Wilmington, DE) to PF-5070<br>
Brand Performance Fluid (CAS Number 86508-42-1, 3M) and allowing the<br>
fluid to mix overnight. The composite sample was held taut in an embroidery<br>
hoop (15.2 cm diameter). A pipette was then used to apply 5 to 6 cm3 of the<br>
above solution to the liquid exposure side of the composite sample. The<br>
composite sample was tilted and rotated such that the solution completely<br>
saturated the sample. At this point, the sample became transparent and was<br>
visibly wet throughout. The hoop was immediately hung vertically in a hood<br>
and allowed to dry overnight. Both sides of the oleophobic composite were<br>
then tested for air flow recovery using Challenge Fluid I. Results are shown in<br>
Table II. The oil rating was measured to be 6.<br>

in a cylinder to form a pellet and placed into an oven set at 25°C for<br>
approximately 24 hours. Compressed and heated pellets were ram extruded<br>
to produce tapes approximately 29 cm wide by 0.635 mm thick. The tape was<br>
then calendared between compression rolls to a thickness of 0.20 mm. The<br>
tape was then dried in an oven set at 250°C. The dry PTFE tape and a 12.5<br>
micron thick PFA film were layered together and longitudinally expanded<br>
between banks of rolls over two heated plates set to a temperature of 320°C.<br>
The speed ratio between the second bank of rolls and the first bank of rolls,<br>
and hence the expansion ratio on the first plate, was 1.15:1. The speed ratio<br>
between the third bank of rolls and the second bank of rolls, and hence the<br>
expansion ratio on the second plate, was 1.15:1. The PFA/ PTFE tape<br>
laminate was then longitudinally expanded 8:1, through a hot air oven set to a<br>
temperature of 320°C. The longitudinally expanded composite was then heat<br>
treated through a hot air oven set to a temperature of 360°C. The composite<br>
was then expanded transversely at a temperature of approximately 380°C to a<br>
ratio of approximately 2.4:1 and then constrained and heated in an oven set at<br>
380°C for approximately 24 seconds.<br>
The porous composite thus produced had a Bubble Point of 0.5 psi.<br>
Both sides of the composite were tested for air flow recovery with challenge<br>
fluid II. Results are shown in Table III.<br>
The composite was treated to render it oleophobic according to the<br>
following procedure. A solution was prepared by adding 0.25 weight percent<br>
of Teflon AF 1600 (Dupont Fluoroproducts, Wilmington, DE) to PF-5070<br>
Brand Performance Fluid (CAS Number 86508-42-1, 3M) and allowing the<br>
fluid to mix overnight. The composite sample was held taut in an embroidery<br>
hoop (15.2 cm diameter). A pipette was then used to apply 5 to 6 cm3 of the<br>
above solution to the surface liquid exposure side of the composite sample.<br>
The composite sample was tilted and rotated such that the solution<br>
completely saturated the sample. At this point, the sample became<br>
transparent and was visibly wet throughout. The hoop was immediately hung<br>
vertically in a hood and allowed to dry overnight. Both sides of the oleophobic<br>
composite were then tested for air flow recovery Challenge Fluid 1. The<br>
results obtained are shown in Table III. The oil rating was measured to be 6.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
A 12.5 micrometer thick sheet of FEP was perforated using a 50 watt<br>
laser machine from Universal Laser Systems Inc. (Scottsdale, AZ). Size of<br>
the perforations were 0.76 mm in diameter, the center-center distance<br>
between perforations was 1.02 mm. The perforated FEP sheet was laminated<br>
to an ePTFE membrane (thickness of 22.8 microns, density of 0.39 g/cm3,<br>
and bubble point of 8 psi) using a web of co-polyester (Spunfab, Inc. Product<br>
Number PE2900-0.6-45W) as an adhesive layer. The materials were<br>
laminated together in a heat press (Geo. Knight &amp; Co, MA) using the following<br>
conditions: 160 degrees, 60 psi, 3 seconds. The composite was evaluated for<br>
air flow recovery using challenge fluid II. Results appear in Table IV.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
5 g FEP powder (Product Number 532-8000 from DuPont) was added<br>
to a mixture of 47.5g of 2-Propanol (IPA) and 47.5g of HFE-7500 (3M NOVEC<br>
(TM) Engineered Fluid). The dispersion was stirred for a few hours until a<br>
clear solution was formed. An ePTFE membrane having a thickness of 106<br>
micron, porosity of 64%, and density of 0.78g/cc was coated with this solution<br>
using a continuous immersion coating process. In this process, the ePTFE<br>
membrane was passed through a first roller and then passed through a bath<br>
containing the coating solution using a second immersion roller. After this<br>
coating step, the membrane was dried for 4 hours at room temperature in a<br>
ventilated hood. A thin layer of FEP particles was left on the surface of the<br>
membrane. To melt the particles, the coated membrane was fixed on a tenter<br>
frame, and placed in a sinter oven at a temperature of 320°C for 5 minutes.<br>
The porous composite thus produced had a nonporous discontinuous surface<br>
layer as shown in Figure 7. The porous composite was rendered oleophobic<br>
by coating with a solution of 0.75 weight percent Teflon AF1600 (DuPont<br>
Fluoroproducts, Wilmington, DE) in solvent PF-5070 (CAS Number 86508-42-<br>
1, 3M) and dried for 6 hours at room temperature in a ventilated hood.<br>
