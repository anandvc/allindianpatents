				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a center stand for a two wheeler motor vehicle, more particularly, though not exclusively, a scooter typo motor vehicle.<br>
The center stand is one of the essential parts of a vehicle, the function of which is to keep the vehicle in stable and static position, when the vehicle is not in use.<br>
The center stands known to the art are prone to this common drawback namely that they have a short fatigue life, mainly becausc the known center stands are made up of a number of welded joints, which gradually give way over a period of use.<br>
Welded joints are also prone to create dimensional and structural inaccuracies, which require to be set right at a later stage necessitating re-working; and resulting in waste of time, labour and money.<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a center stand as aforesaid which considerably reduces the use of welded joints in the center stand, produce** stronger and more durable center stand needing little attention for its upkeep.<br>
Another object of thisinvention is to reduce the number of working parts, rendering the structure of the centre stand simpler and more efficient not only from the point of manufacture, but also from the point of use.<br>
The known centrestand, generally, has a spring to help the stand to return to its normal position (its position of rest) When not in use. The stand remains in Oust position when the vehiclc is running. When the vehicle is required to be put on stand the user applieseffort on the stand lever against the spring action.<br>
/iuev<br>
Generally, the known standju welded to its main structure. The leverlength ts limited by the woldedjointas the increase in the length will make it dig into the ground hrUn 1**<br>
The invention proposed herein dispenses with fee need to have a welded joint and provides for a pin joint so that the lever length can be increased to increase the lever ratio and decrease<br>
ground is avoided as the lever rotates about the pin joint upon touching the ground. The pin joint allows the lever to rotate when it tries to dig into the ground.<br>
However the rotational movement of the lever needs to be restrained to avoid rattlmg of the lever. The user must be able to apply load on the lever as he had done on the welded lever. Accowhngly, a lever stopper is provided in this invention.<br>
The centre stand for atwo wheeler motor vehicle, according to this in vention, comprises a rotatable lever for being fixed to the base ofthe saetoMttaldty a pin joint whereby the length of the lever can beincreased to increase the lever ratio and thereby <br>
avoid Ac lever digging into the ground as the lever rotates	'<br>
about the pin joint and touches the ground; a pivotable cam<br>
provided for the lever, said cam ha ving a profile butting<br>
against a stop, on rotation of the lever towards its working<br>
position, thereby restricting the rotation of the lever to a<br>
predetermined angle^w serving as a safety stopper,^ tension<br>
spring provided for the lever, a hook welded on the cam to<br>
serve as an anchor for the spring, the spring providing a<br>
restraining action on the ksver whtfe also enabling thejlever to<br>
revert, fit&gt;m its working position, to its position of rest.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, the single Figure in which illustrates, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of possible embodiments of this invention.<br>
A rotatable stand-lever Lis provided for being fixed to the base ^ of the motor vrfiicle. A pi votable cam C is provided for the stand-lever, said cam having a profile P butting against a stop S, on rotation of the stand-lever towards its working position, thereby restricting the rotation of the stand-lever to a predetermined angle. A tension spring T is provided for, and enables, the stand-lever L to revert to its position of rest<br>
whenever the stand is pushed into such position when it is not	^<br>
in use.<br>
The cam serves as<br>
a)	a pivot<br>
b)	a lever stopper. The cam (welded to Hie lever) stops against a stopper to enable the user to apply effort on the stand lever to put the vehicle on stand<br>
c)	a safety stopper. The profile in the earn prevents the reveraerotationofthelever in case the spring gets cut.<br>
and it can rotate freely and may cause an accident which should not happen.<br>
spring anchor. The cam can also serve to anchor the spring. A separate hook His welded on the cam to serve as an anchor for the spring.<br>
The restmining action required for the lever has been achieved by the same spring that is used for stand return.<br>
It will be observed that the cam and stop ensure a positive restraining action on the stand-lever action. At the same time, the use ofa spring for restricting the movement of the lever beyond a given angle is eliminated. <br>
The terms and expressions herein are of description and not of limitatk^ sinoe the centre stand proposed hwein is not<br>
confined to its embodiment herein illustrated and described, but<br>
i ... various other embodiments are possible without departing from<br>
the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br>
