				<td>Process for the preparation of ketones by ozonolysis<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a ketone from an alcohol<br>
having a double bond in the alpha position.<br>
Alcohols having a double bond in the alpha position are conventionally converted<br>
into ketones in the presence of inorganic oxidizing agents (e.g. KMnO4, OsO4,<br>
H2SO4/H2CrO4). In particular, it is known to convert an alcohol of the formula (I)<br>
into a ketone of the formula (II) in this manner:<br><br>
wherein the radicals R1, R2 independently of one another can be alkyl, alkenyl,<br>
cycloalkyl or aryl. Alcohols of the formula (I) are obtained from natural sources in<br>
some cases, but are also accessible by synthesis.<br>
WO 91/09852 describes a two-stage process for the preparation of sclareolide<br>
(also (-)-norlabdan oxide) from sclareol, in which in a first stage an oxidative<br>
degradation of sclareol in the presence of ruthenium salts or potassium<br>
permanganate takes place, and in a second stage the intermediate product<br>
formed is oxidized with peracid and/or peracid salts to give sclareolide.<br><br>
Barton et al. (Tetrahedron Letters, 1994, 35(32), 5801) describe a further<br>
synthesis set-up for the preparation of sclareolide starting from sclareol, and in<br>
particular by oxidative reaction of the starting substance with a mixture of<br>
OsO4/NalO4<br>
The oxidizing agents used in conventional processes are a disadvantage<br>
because of their toxicity to man and the environment and their ease of handling<br>
being made difficult as a result. This disadvantage in particular makes the<br>
industrial reaction of alcohols having a double bond in the alpha position difficult.<br>
Attempts have therefore been made to modify these processes, and in particular<br>
to use novel oxidizing agents. Thus, EP 0 822 191 A1 and Fekih et al. (J. Soc.<br>
Chim. Tunisie, 2001, 4(9), 909) each describe two-stage processes for the<br>
preparation of sclareol oxide from sclareol by ozonolysis:<br><br>
In a first stage, the allyl alcohol group of the sclareol is converted into the<br>
corresponding ozonide by addition of ozone. In a second stage, the ozonide is<br>
then converted into the desired sclareol oxide by working up with alkaline H2O2.<br>
The reaction can be carried out in various organic solvents, such as methylene<br>
chloride, methanol or ethanol. In the reaction, however, large amounts of the<br>
highly reactive ozonide are obtained in the first step, so that considerably safety<br>
precautions are necessary for carrying out the reaction. In particular, an efficient<br>
cooling is required in order to be able to carry out the reaction safely. These<br>
disadvantages are important in particular in an industrial reaction.<br>
The invention is based on the object of providing a process for the preparation of<br>
a ketone from a tertiary alcohol having a double bond in the alpha position which<br>
limits or completely avoids the abovementioned disadvantages of conventional<br>
processes. In particular, it should be possible to carry out the process without the<br>
high safety precautions hitherto necessary.<br><br>
The object is achieved by a process for the preparation of a ketone from a<br>
tertiary alcohol having a double bond in the alpha position, comprising the steps:<br>
a)	provision of the alcohol,<br>
b)	treatment of the alcohol with ozone in the presence of an inorganic base.<br>
The process according to the invention leads to a surprisingly short reaction time<br>
with a simultaneously high yield, and avoids the occasional occurrence of large<br>
amounts of heat. Furthermore, the use of highly toxic oxidizing agents is<br>
dispensed with, so that overall lesser safety precautions have to be taken than<br>
with conventional processes.<br>
The possibility of achieving high yields with a simultaneously short reaction time<br>
was surprising in particular since it was known that in the presence of an<br>
inorganic base, ozone dissociates rapidly, especially at weakly basic pH values<br>
(Hollemann, Wiberg, Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie [Textbook of<br>
Inorganic Chemistry], 101st ed., p. 516). Accordingly, it was to be expected that<br>
large amounts of ozone would be required in order to provide a sufficient amount<br>
of ozone for reaction of the alcohol. It has now been found, surprisingly, thatthe<br>
amount of ozone required is not increased compared with conventional<br>
processes, in spite of the presence of an inorganic base, and that the reaction<br>
according to the invention, which is carried out in one step, can even be carried<br>
but significantly more rapidly and with a lower requirement of safety precautions<br>
than in the case of conventional processes.<br>
A further advantage of the process according to the invention is that only small<br><br>
amounts of heat are released in step b). Compared with conventional processes,<br>
only cooling units having a lower output are therefore required for carrying out<br>
the process according to the invention. This is a great advantage in particular in<br>
an industrial process procedure.<br>
Particularly good results can be obtained if, in step b), the alcohol employed is<br>
treated with 1-3 molar equivalents of ozone, based on the alcohol group to be<br>
reacted. In this context, a process according to the invention in which, in step b),<br>
the alcohol employed is treated with 1-2 molar equivalents of ozone, based on<br><br>
the alcohol group to be reacted, is particularly preferred. In both cases, the<br>
amount of ozone employed is advantageously kept low.This is of advantage in<br>
particular in an industrial process procedure, since ozone is expediently<br>
generated in a reaction which runs in parallel during the reaction of the alcohol<br>
and is added constantly or continuously to the reaction which proceeds in step<br>
b). The process according to the invention therefore renders possible a reaction<br>
of the alcohol with a low requirement of ozone to be provided.<br>
For generation of the ozone in an ozone generator, pure oxygen, but also<br>
mixtures of oxygen and inert gases in various volume ratios to oxygen, preferably<br>
between 1 and 80 vol.%, can be used. An ozone content of a gas passed into the<br>
reaction mixture in step b) is preferably in the range of from 1 to 12 wt.%, based<br>
on the gas employed, but particularly preferably in the range of from 4 to 8 wt.%.<br>
The ozone can be passed into the reaction mixture in a molar amount in the<br>
range of from 1 to 5, preferably in the range of from 1 to 3, particularly preferably<br>
in thejrange of from 1.1 to 2 molar equivalents to the double bond to be reacted<br>
in the alpha position of the compound. By-products of the ozonolysis can be<br>
decreased by this means.<br>
It is furthermore preferable if, in step b), the base is not already initially<br>
introduced completely at the start of the reaction, but is added constantly such<br>
that its equivalent concentration on discontinuation of the reaction is 1 to 3,<br>
preferably 1 to 2, based on the total alcohol group to be reacted which are<br>
employed. It is ensured in this way that the concentration of available ozone is at<br>
the optimum level to achieve a rapid reaction of the alcohol with high yields, and<br>
at the same time is low enough to prevent release of high amounts of heat in<br>
step b). The base can be added continuously or repeatedly when carrying out<br>
step b).<br>
Suitable inorganic bases are all the strong to medium-strong Bronstedt bases<br>
which are stable under ozonolysis conditions. The pKB value of the base is<br>
preferably 4 to 10. The base used in step b) is preferably chosen from the group<br>
consisting of NaOH, KOH, LiOH, NaHCO3, Na2CO3, CaCO3 or mixtures of two or<br>
more of these bases. In this context, the alkali metal bases mentioned are in turn<br>
advantageous, and the alkali metal hydroxides are preferred. LiOH, NaOH and<br><br>
KOH are particularly preferred bases. In the process according to the invention,<br>
with alkali metal bases, no corresponding alkali metal peroxides or alkali metal<br>
ozonides are formed or accumulated, in contrast to the process described in<br>
US 3,664,810 with alkaline earth metal bases, in which substantially<br>
stoichiometric amounts of the corresponding alkaline earth peroxides are formed.<br>
These bases, in particular the alkali metal hydroxides (which are mentioned as<br>
particularly preferred) have given particularly high yields of the desired<br>
compound in comparison experiments. The bases are expediently provided in<br>
dissolved form in step b), so that when choosing the base, the solubility thereof<br>
in the solvent used is also to be taken into account.<br>
EP 1 569 885 relates to the in situ dissociation of peroxides during the ozonolysis<br>
of optionally substituted alkenes to give the corresponding aldehydes or ketones.<br>
CaCO3, inter alia, can be used as the support material for the peroxide-<br>
dissociating metal catalysts used there. According to EP 1 569 885, CaCO3 is not<br>
employed for its basic properties, but, on the contrary, as an inert carrier material<br>
which does not dissolve in the solvent (mixture) employed in the ozonolysis and<br>
therefore also makes no noticeable contribution to the pH.<br>
The process according to the invention is preferably carried out a phi in the range<br>
of from 13 to 8.. The pH is regularly initially in the range of from 13 to 12 during<br>
the ozonolysis in the presence of the base in step b) of the process according to<br>
the invention, and in the range of from 9 to 8 at the end of the ozonolysis. In this<br>
context, it is to be noted that the selectivity of the ozonolysis in the process<br>
according to the invention substantially does not decrease as the duration of the<br>
reaction progresses. This is all the more surprising, since it is known that the<br>
stability of ozone decreases noticeably at lower pH values (below 14)<br>
(Hollemann, Wiberg, Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie [Textbook of<br>
Inorganic Chemistry, 101st ed., p. 508, 517). It would have been expected that<br>
the dissociation products of ozone would have reacted with the tertiary alcohols<br>
having a double bond in the alpha position which are to be employed according<br>
to the invention, to give undesirable by-products or degradation products of the<br>
tertiary alcohols.<br><br>
In preferred embodiments, the process according to the invention is carried out<br>
in the absence of a heterogeneous, inorganic peroxide-dissociating catalyst from<br>
the group consisting of iridium, manganese, cobalt, silver, gold, palladium,<br>
platinum or ruthenium.<br>
In further preferred embodiments, the process according to the invention is<br>
carried out in the absence of an emulsifier.<br>
Water or a solvent mixture of water and a water-miscible organic solvent is<br>
preferably employed as the solvent for the base in step b). The solvent mixture<br>
preferably comprises tetrahydrofuran and water, in particular with a mixture ratio<br>
by weight of tetrahydrofuran to water in the range of from 1:2 to 2:1, particularly<br>
preferably about 1:1. The solvent must be suitable for the ozonolysis. The base<br>
is preferably added in step b) by dropwise addition from a stock solution, the<br>
concentration of the base in the stock solution preferably being 2 to 50 wt.%,<br>
particularly preferably 7.5 to 10 wt.%, in each case based on the total stock<br>
solution.<br>
The solvent for the alcohol is chosen such that it is completely or largely inert<br>
towards ozone and is completely or largely stable towards the base added.<br>
Preferred solvents for the alcohol include substituted or unsubstituted aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons, or solvents which contain oxygen in the form of carbonyl, ether or<br>
alcohol functionalities. Halogenated aromatic and non-aromatic solvents likewise<br>
prove to be suitable for carrying out the reaction. Solvents with other oxidizable<br>
heteroatoms (nitrogen and sulfur) are not suitable because of their affinity for<br>
oxygen. Toluene is pariicularly preferred.<br>
It is particularly preferable for the reaction in step b) to be carried out in a two-<br>
phase system, the alcohol being provided in an organic solvent in step a) and the<br>
base being employed in an aqueous solvent in step b). This has the advantage<br>
that precipitation of the base on addition into the reaction mixture is prevented, a<br>
concentration of the base in the phase of the reaction mixture containing the<br>
alcohol remains low, and a reacton between the ozonide formed and the base<br>
takes place only in the region of the phase boundary. In this context, the reaction<br>
mixture is expediently mixed thoroughly by stirring. Particularly preferably, the<br>
solvent of the alcohol is toluene and the solvent of the base is water or a solvent<br><br>
mixture of water and tetrahydrofuran, in particular with a mixture ratio by weight<br>
of tetrahydrofuran to water in the range of from 1:2 to 2:1, particularly preferably<br>
about 1:1.<br>
Preferably, the base in step b) is added to the reaction mixture with a rate of<br>
addition which depends on the amount of ozonide formed. As a rule, the rate of<br>
addition of the base is increased when the amount of ozonide formed also<br>
increases during the period in question, and vice versa. It is particularly<br>
preferable for the dissolved base to be added in a molar amount of between 0.8<br>
to 1.2 molar equivalents to the ozonide formed. By this means, the concentration<br>
of the ozonide in the reaction mixture can be kept low, but possible side<br>
reactions or disturbances in the formation of the ozonide due to the base added<br>
are avoided.<br>
Preferably, in step b) the reaction temperature is -78 °C to +30 oC in particular<br>
-30 °C to +10 0C,particularly preferably -10 °C to 0 °C. By this means, side<br>
reactions of the ozonolysis and during the further reaction of the ozonide formed<br>
and the base can be suppressed, but at the same time sufficiently high<br>
conversions for the two component reactions can still be maintained.<br>
The alcohol employed in a process according to the invention, in particular by<br>
one of the preferred process embodiments described above, preferably has the<br>
general formula (la)<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 independently of one another denote an organic radical and<br>
the two radicals R1 and R2 together can form a ring, and wherein furthermore<br>
R3 and R4 independently of one another can denote hydrogen or substituted or<br>
unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl or aryl and the two radicals together can<br>
form a ring and/or one or both of the radicals R3 and R4 can form a ring together<br>
with one or both of the radicals R1 and/or R2.<br><br>
The process according to the invention can thus be carried out with an<br>
advantageously wide choice of tertiary alcohols.<br>
In preferred alcohols, R1 and R2 independently of one another are chosen from<br>
organic radicals having up to 30 carbon atoms and up to 10 nitrogen and/or<br>
oxygen atoms.<br>
Preferably, R1 and R2 independently of one another denote substituted or<br>
unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heterocycloalkyl or<br>
(hetero)aryl, wherein R1 and R2 together can form a ring, preferably a ring<br>
having 5 to 20 members in total.<br>
Particularly preferably, R1 and R2 independently of one another denote<br>
substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl or aryl.<br>
Preferably, R3 and R4 independently of one another denote hydrogen or<br>
substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl,<br>
heterocycloalkyl or (hetero)aryl, wherein R3 and R4 together can form a ring,<br>
preferably a ring having 5 to 20 members in total.<br>
If R1, R2, R3 and/or R4 are cyclic radicals, these are also to be understood as<br>
meaning rings bonded to one another, such as e.g. fused, polycyclic or<br>
condensed rings.<br>
R1 and R2 furthermore independently of one another preferably denote<br>
substituted or unsubstituted straight- or branched-chain C1-C20-alkyl, straight- or<br>
branched-chain C3-C20-alkenyl, C3-C20-cycloalkyl, C4-C20-cycloalkylalkyl, C3-C20-<br>
heterocycloalkyl or C5-C20-(hetero)aryl.<br>
R3 and R4 furthermore independently of one another preferably denote<br>
hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted straight- or branched-chain C1-C20-alkyl,<br>
straight- or branched-chain C3-C20-alkenyl, C3-C20-cycloalkyl, C4-C20-<br>
cycloalkylalkyl, C3-C20-heterocycloalkyl or C5-C20-(hetero)aryl.<br>
If R1, R2, R3 and/or R4 are substituted alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl,<br>
heterocycloalkyl or (hetero)aryl, in each case the following substituents are<br>
preferred:<br><br>
hydroxy I,<br>
C1-C8-alkyl, preferably methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-<br>
butyl,<br>
C3-C18-cycloa1kyl, preferably cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclooctyl,<br>
cyclododecyl, cyclopentadecyl, cyclohexadecyl,<br>
C2-C8-alkynyl, preferably ethynyl, propynyl<br>
C1-C8-perfluoroalkyl, preferably trifluoromethyl,<br>

C1-C20-alkoxyalkyl, in which 1 to 5 CH2 groups are replaced by oxygen, preferably<br>
-[-O-CH2-CH2-]n-Q or -[-O-CH2-CHMe-]n-Q, wherein Q is OH or CH3 and wherein<br>
n can denote 1 to 4,<br>
C1-C4-acyl, preferably acetyl,<br>

C1-C4-acyloxy, preferably acetyloxy,<br>
halide, preferably F or CI, and<br>
Si1-Si30-siloxy.<br>
Good results are obtained in particular if the double bond in the alpha position is<br>
not part of a system of conjugated double bonds. Preferably, the radicals R3 and<br>
R4 are therefore hydrogen or alkyl. In this context, alcohols in which R3 and R4<br>
are hydrogen are particularly preferred.<br><br>
If the alcohol to be reacted carries further alcohol groups or other groups which<br>
are not be reacted, in addition to an alcohol group which is to be reacted, these<br>
alcohol groups are expediently protected against ozonolysis.<br>
The process is suitable in particular for compound chosen from the group<br>
consisting of manool, sclareol, larixol, linalool, nerolidol or a derivative derived<br>
from the compounds mentioned. Derivatization of the compounds serves in<br>
particular to introduce protective groups for non-allylic double bonds (double<br>
bonds which are not in the alpha position) optionally present, preferably by<br>
selective epoxidation thereof.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail in the following with the aid of<br>
embodiment examples.<br>
General instructions for the reaction procedure<br>
The reactions were carried out in conventional laboratory apparatuses. In smaller<br>
batches, the reaction mixtures were kept at the appropriate temperature by dry<br>
ice baths. In the case of larger batches, double-jacketed vessels through which a<br>
cooling medium suitable for the desired temperature range was pumped were<br>
used.<br>
Non-allylic double bonds present in the compounds were as a rule protected<br>
from ozonolysis by epoxidation.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, all data in % are to be understood as % by weight data.<br>
Amounts data in the examples relate to weight ratios.<br>
The following compounds having a diterpene base structure were employed as<br>
educts in Examples 1 to 5:<br><br><br>
The compounds manool (III), sclareol (IV) and larixol (V) are accessible from<br>
plant raw materials by extraction and are distinguished by a tertiary alcohol<br>
function with an allylic substituent.<br>
Example 1 - Reaction of manool (III)<br>
a) Epoxidation<br><br>
45 g / 0.16 mol manool (III) was initially introduced into 150 g toluene, and 0.32<br>
g tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate was added. After addition of 150 g<br>
water, 110 g / 0.22 mol magnesium monoperoxyphthalate were added. After 4 h<br>
at 40 °C, the organic phase was separated off. The organic phase separated off<br>
was washed free from peroxide with sodium sulfite solution, after neutralization<br>
by saturated Na2CO3 solution. 39.8 g of a product comprising the compound<br>
(IlIa) in 80 % purity (GC-MS) were obtained. The product was employed in the<br>
ozonolysis without further working up.<br><br>
b) Ozonolysis<br><br>
28.3 g / 0.08 mol of compound (IlIa) were dissolved in nine times the amount of<br>
toluene and the solution was cooled to -25 °C. 2 molar equivalents of ozone were<br>
passed at a constant rate into the reaction mixture, while stirring and cooling.<br>
1.1 molar equivalents of 5 % strength aqueous NaOH solution were<br>
simultaneously added dropwise to the reaction mixture over the entire duration of<br>
the passing in of the ozone, a rate of addition of the solution being kept constant.<br>
A conversion of the compound (IlIa) was monitored by means of GC. After<br>
complete conversion, the reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature, the<br>
aqueous phase was separated off and the organic phase was washed neutral<br>
with aqueous saturated NaCI solution.<br>
Yield of compound (lllb): 21.6 g (71 %)<br><br>
Example 2 - Reaction of larixol (V)<br>
a)	Epoxidation<br><br>
15 g / 0.06 mol larixol (V) were initially introduced into 150 g toluene. After<br>
addition of 150 g water, 27.4 g magnesium monoperoxyphthalate were added.<br>
After stirring for 4 h at 40 °C, the organic phase was separated off. After<br>
neutralization with aqueous saturated NaCI solution, this was washed free from<br>
peroxide using sodium sulfite solution. 16.5 g of a product comprising the<br>
compound (Va) in 91 % purity (GC-MS) were obtained. The product was<br>
employed in the ozonolysis without further working up.<br>
b)	Ozonolysis<br><br>
20.0 g / 0.06 mol of compound (Va) were dissolved in 200 g CH2CI2, while<br>
stirring, and the solution was cooled to -40 °C. 2.5 molar equivalents of ozone<br>
were passed at a constant rate into the cooled solution, while stirring and<br>
cooling. A solution of 1.2 molar equivalents of NaOH (2.9 g / 0.07 mol), dissolved<br><br>
in 52 g tetrahydrofuran and 52 g water, was added dropwise at a constant rate<br>
over the entire duration of the passing in of ozone. After the excess ozone had<br>
been driven off, the reaction batch was warmed to room temperature and then<br>
neutralized with aqueous saturated NaCI solution and freed from the peroxides<br>
formed by washing with sodium sulfite solution. The crude product (Vb) was<br>
obtained as a pale to colourless oil after the solvent had been distilled off.<br>
The yield is 70 % (GC-MS), calculated for compound (V).<br>
Example 3 - Ozonolvsis of sclareol (IV)<br><br>
30.8 g / 0.1 mol sclareol (IV) were dissolved in 4.5 times the amount of<br>
methanol/CH2CI2 (1:1 (w/w)) and the reaction mixture was cooled to -20 °C.<br>
2 molar equivalents of ozone were then passed at a constant rate into the<br>
reaction mixture, while stirring and cooling. During the addition of the ozone, 1.1<br>
molar equivalents of NaOH, based on the sclareol and dissolved in five times the<br>
amount of water and tetrahydrofuran, were added dropwise into the reaction<br>
mixture at a constant rate. When the reaction had ended, the reaction mixture<br>
was warmed to room temperature and the organic phase was separated off.<br>
After neutralization with aqueous saturated NaCI solution and destruction of the<br>
peroxides formed with sodium sulfite solution, the solvent was distilled off and<br>
the reaction product sclareol oxide (IVa) was obtained with a yield of 97 % (GC-<br>
MS).<br>
Example 4 - Ozonolysis of sclareol (IV) using various bases<br>
162 g / 0.5 mol sclareol (IV) were dissolved in nine times the amount of toluene<br>
and the reaction mixture was cooled to -5 °C. 2 molar equivalents of ozone were<br><br>
then passed at a constant rate into the reaction mixture, while stirring and<br>
cooling. During the addition of the ozone, 1.5 molar equivalents of the bases<br>
mentioned in Tab. 1, based on the sclareol (IV) and dissolved in five times the<br>
amount of water and tetrahydrofuran, were added dropwise into the reaction<br>
mixture at a constant rate. When the reaction had ended, the reaction mixture<br>
was warmed to room temperature and the organic phase was separated off.<br>
After neutralization of the organic phase with aqueous saturated NaCI solution,<br>
washing with a sodium sulfite solution and distilling off of the solvent, the reaction<br>
product was obtained as a yellow solid and the content of sclareol (IV) and<br>
sclareol oxide (IVa) was determined by GC-MS (see Tab. 1).<br>
The highest selectivity in the conversion of sclareol (IV) into sclareol oxide (IVa)<br>
was achieved with a solution of KOH.<br><br>
82.0 g / 0.20 mol manool (III) (70 % pure natural substance) were initially<br>
introduced into 250 g toluene and the solution was cooled to -5 °C. 2.5 molar<br>
equivalents of ozone were then passed at a constant rate into the reaction<br>
mixture, while stirring and cooling. A solution of 12 g / 0.3 mol NaOH and water<br><br>
(weight ratio 1:9) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture at a constant rate<br>
during the entire reaction time. When the passing in of the ozone had ended, the<br>
reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and the organic phase was<br>
separated off. The organic phase was neutralized by washing several times with<br>
water. After concentration of the organic phase, the crude product was obtained<br>
as a colourless oil.<br>
Composition (GC-MS):	Compound (lllc)	66%<br>
Compound (llld)	33%<br><br>
7.7 g linalool (VI) were dissolved in 100 g toluene, 0.1 g tetrabutylammonium<br>
hydrogen sulfate was added and the reaction and working up were carried out<br>
analogously to the instructions under Example 1, a) Epoxidation.<br>
Crude yield: 7.4 g, content in this of compound (Via) 88 %<br><br>
b) Ozonolysis<br><br>
5.0 g of compound (Via) were dissolved in 100 g CH2CI2 and reacted analogously<br>
to the instructions under Example 1, b) Ozonolysis. After working up of the<br>
reaction mixture (washing neutral with NaCI solution, washing with sodium<br>
sulfite), 2.15 g 5,6-epoxy-6-methyl-heptan-2-one (Vlb) were obtained (yield: 49<br>
% (GC-MS)).<br>
Example 7 - Reaction of nerolidol (VII)<br><br>
a) Epoxidation<br><br>
22.0 g nerolidol (VII) were dissolved in 100 g toluene, 0.3 g tetrabutylammonium<br>
hydrogen sulfate was added and the reaction and working up were carried out<br>
analogously to the instructions under Example 1, a) Epoxidation.<br><br>
13.9 g of compound (VIla) were obtained.<br>
b) Ozonolysis<br><br>
7.5 g of compound (VIla), dissolved in 100 g CH2CI2, were initially introduced into<br>
the reaction vessel. 2.5 molar equivalents of ozone were then passed at a<br>
constant rate into the reaction mixture at -40 °C, while stirring. 1.1 molar<br>
equivalents of NaOH, dissolved in nine times the amount of<br>
water/tetrahydrofuran (1/1, w/w) were passed in at a constant rate during the<br>
entire reaction. When the ozonolysis had ended, the reaction mixture was<br>
warmed to room temperature and the organic phase was separated off. After<br>
neutralization of the organic phase with water and removal of the solvent by<br>
distillation, compound (VIlb) was obtained as a colourless oil.<br>
Yield: 4.33 g (43.70%)<br><br>
