COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
A GASKET FOR A FLUID SYSTEM, A FLUID.CONNECTION AND A COMPRESSOR SYSTEM HAVING SAID GASKET"<br>
WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION, of 1001 Air Brake Avenue, Wilmerding, Pennsylvania 15148, United States of America, a Delaware company,<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a gasket for a fluid system, fluid connection and a compressor system having said gasket.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compressors employed in airbrake systems used in locomotives generally liave air pressure connections having rectangular flanges with gaskets clamped therebetween. A prior art flange and gasket as employed in a locomotive air comp'ressor is shown in Figure 1. The flange 10 includes a port 11 for fluid communication with an air conduit (not shown) . Flange 10 has a plurality of holes 14 to accommodate bolts for attaching flange 10 to a similar flange (not shown) which receives the compressed air. The prior art gasket 12 is compressed between flange 10 and a second flange (not shown) by tension in the bolts to prevent air loss between the flanges. A plurality of holes 15 are provided for the bolts. The air pressure in port 11 presses outward on inner edge 16 of gasket 12. This pressure is sufficient to cause tensile stresses at regions island 20 of gasket 12 and compressive stresses at region 22.  These stresses tend to cause failure of gasket 12.<br>
SUMMARY OP THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the present invention is. a gasket for a fluid system containing a pressurized fluid.  The fluid system includes' a first rectangular flange having a first port for communicating the pressurized fluid to a second port in a second rectangular<br><br>
flange. The first flange is attached to the second flange by a predetermined number of fasteners passing through first flange fastener holes in the first flange and through second flange fastener holes in the second flange. The gasket consists of a i sheet of deformable material enclosed within an outer periphery. The outer periphery defining outwardly extending portions with concave segments between adjacent pairs of such outwardly extending portions. The gasket has a plurality of gasket fastener holes disposed in the outwardly extending portions. A central opening is<br>
Idi disposed within an inner periphery of the gasket. Such inner periphery is curved toward the central opening. The central opening enables passing the pressurized fluid from the first port to the second port. When the gasket is assembled between the first flange and the second flange to seal between the first flange and<br>
ii the second flange and the fluid system contains the pressurized fluid, a pressure of the fluid exerted on the inner periphery of the 'gasket is at least in part reacted by hoop tension in the gasket.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is a fluid connection<br>
	for connecting a first fluid passage in a first pressure<br>
containment structure to a second fluid passage in a second pressure containment structure. The fluid connection has a first flange having a first port. The first flange being for attachment to the first pressure containment structure so that the first port<br>
p$ is in fluid communication with the first fluid passage. The fluid connection also has a second flange having a second port.  The<br><br><br>
second flange being for attachment to the second pressure<br>
containment structure so that the second port is in fluid<br>
communication with the second fluid passage. A gasket is disposed<br>
between the first flange and the second flange to seal between the<br>
	first flange and the second flange.  A plurality of fasteners<br>
compress the gasket between the first flange and the second flange. The gasket has a central opening defined within an inner periphery of the gasket, the inner periphery being curved toward the central opening. The central opening provides fluid communication between<br>
 the first port and the second port. The gasket has a plurality of outwardly extending portions having gasket fastener holes enclosing the fasteners and it has an outer periphery having concave portions between adjacent pairs of the outwardly extending portions so that an area of the gasket is substantially less than an area of the<br>
ii first flange and is substantially less than an area of the second flange.<br>
In another aspect, the invention is a compressor system for supplying compressed air. It has at least one pressure connection having rectangular flanges and a gasket clamped between the flanges<br>
 to prevent air loss between the flanges. The gasket has a round central opening and a periphery with concave portions.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY<br>
	PREFERRED AND VARIOUS ALTERNATIVE<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Prior to proceeding to the much more detailed description of<br>
the present invention, it should be noted that identical components<br>
which have identical functions have been identified with identical<br>
reference numerals throughout the several views illustrated in the drawing figures for the sake of clarity and understanding of the invention.<br>
Attention is now directed to Figure 2 and 3 which show a rectangular flange 10 and a gasket, generally designated 30,<br>
   according to the presently preferred embodiment of the invention. Gasket 3 0 has an outer periphery 36 which encloses four outwardly extending portions 38 having fastener holes 15. Outer periphery 36 has concave segments 3 7 between adjacent pairs of the outwardly extending portions 38.  Preferably,  concave segments  37 are<br>
 substantially arcuate. These concave segments 37 serve to reduce the area of gasket 30. In the presently preferred embodiment, the fastener holes 15 in gasket 3 0 are disposed on the corners 33 of a<br><br>
square 31, seen in Figure 2. Such a gasket is employed for the case in which flange 10 is square.<br>
Gasket 30 has a central opening 32 disposed within an inner periphery 34 of gasket 30. Inner periphery 34 is curved toward  central opening 32. In the presently preferred einbodiment shown, central opening 32 is circular. A person skilled in the art will recognize that fluid pressure exerted in an outward direction on inner periphery 34 of gasket 3Q is, at least in part, reacted by hoop tension along tension lines 40, which are seen in Figure 2.<br>
10 Figures 4,5 and 6 show a fluid pressure connection, generally designated 80, consisting of flange 10 attached to a like flange 50 with gasket 3 0 disposed therebetween. Fasteners 13, preferably bolts, pass through flange fastener holes 14 and gasket fastener holes 15.  Fasteners 13 compress gasket 3 0 between flange 10 and<br>
   flange 50.<br>
In use, flange 10 and flange 50 are usually welded to or formed integrally with fluid containment structures. Figure 6 shows flange 10 welded to first conduit 64 having first passage 63, and it shows flange 50 welded to second conduit 74 having second<br>
?p   passage 73.  Port 11 in flange 10 communicates with the first passage 63 and port 51 in flange 50 communicates with second passage 73. Preferably, central opening 32 in gasket 30 (Figure 3) has the same diameter as ports 11 and 51 in flanges 10 and 50, respectively<br>
E5 The amount of clamping force available from the fasteners is limited by the size and grade of the fasteners.  Therefore, to<br><br>
increase the clamping pressure on gasket 3 0 (Figure 3) , its area is<br>
reduced so as to be substantially less than the areas of flanges 10<br>
and 50. That is the purpose of the concave segments 37 in the<br>
outer periphery 36 of gasket 30. Preferably, when a gasket 30,<br>
	according to the present invention, is used to replace a specific<br>
prior art gasket 12 (Figure 1) , the area of gasket 3 0 should be less than or equal to the area of gasket 12.<br>
Attention is now directed to Figures 7, 8 and 9. Figure 7 shows a flange 60 having holes 14 for fasteners 13 and a gasket 66<br>
   having holes 15 for fasteners 13 . Preferably, the fastener holes 14 and 15 are located on corners 69 of a regular polygon 68.  In the embodiment shown, polygon 68 is a regular hexagon. Preferably, holes 14 in flange 60 and holes 15 in gasket 66 are round.  In Figure 9, a fluid pressure connection, generally designated 90, is<br>
 shown, which employs flange 60 and gasket 66 assembled with the flange 70. Typically, flange 60 is attached to the first fluid pressure containment structure 64 so that port 61 in flange 60 communicates with first fluid passage 63. Flange 70 is attached to second fluid pressure containment structure 74 so that port 71 in<br>
   flange 70 communicates with second fluid passage 73,<br>
To provide a seal between flange 60 and flange 70, gasket 66 is clamped therebetween by bolts 13. To increase the clamping pressure, outer periphery 75 of gasket 66 has concave portions 67. Gasket 66 has an inner periphery 34 enclosing central opening 32.<br>
 Central opening 32, preferably, is circular. It permits fluid communication between port 61 in flange 60 and port 71 in the<br><br>
flange 70, so that first fluid passage 63 communicates with second fluid passage 73.<br>
Figure 10 shows a presently preferred embodiment of - the invention, which is a compressor system, generally designated 100. $ Compressor system 100 has low pressure cylinders 102 and 103. Low pressure cylinder 102 has inlet 104 to which an air filter {not shown) would be attached. Low pressure cylinder 102 has outlet 106 which employs rectangular flanges 10 and SO, and gasket 30 according to the present invention.  Air from outlet 106 of low<br>
 pressure cylinder 102 is received by low pressure conduit 108 which conveys the air to intercooler 110. Inlet 109 of intercooler 110 likewise preferably employs the square flanges 10 and 50 as well as gasket 30, according to the present invention. Outlet 112 of intercooler 110 also preferably employs square flanges 10 and 50 as<br>
i$ well as gasket 30, according to the present invention. A T-shaped piping connection 114 receives air from intercooler 110 and a second intercooler ill which receives air from a second low pressure cylinder 103.<br>
The T-shaped piping connection 114 supplies air to inlet 116<br>
 of high pressure cylinder 118. Inlet 116 of the high pressure cylinder 118, preferably, also employs flanges 10 and 50 as well as gasket 30 of the present invention. Outlet 120 of high pressure cylinder 118 also, preferably, employs square flanges 10 and 50 as well as gasket 30, in accordance with the present invention. High<br>
 pressure conduit 121 conveys air from high pressure cylinder 120 to inlet 122 of aftercooler 124. Inlet 122, preferably, also employs<br><br>
square flanges 10 and 50 as well as gasket 30, according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 11 shows a view of compressor system 100 which has some portions cut away to show internals of low pressure cylinders 102 and 103 and the high pressure cylinder 118. This figure also shows an outlet 126 of aftercooler 124. Outlet 126, preferably, also employs square flanges 10 and 50 as well as gasket 30, according, to the present invention.<br>
While a presently preferred and various additional alternative embodiments of the instant invention have been described in detail above in accordance the patent statutes, it should be recognized that various other modifications and adaptations of the invention may be made by those persons who are skilled in the relevant art without departing from either the spirit of the invention or the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br>
