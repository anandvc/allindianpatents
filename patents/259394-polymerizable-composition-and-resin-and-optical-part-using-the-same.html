				<td>DESCRIPTION POLYMERIZABLE COMPOSITION, AND RESIN AND OPTICAL PART USING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a polymerizable composition, a resin obtained by polymerization of the polymerizable composition, and an optical part composed of the resin.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Since an inorganic glass has excellent general properties such as excellent transparency and low optical anisotropy, the inorganic glass has been widely used in many fields as a transparent material. However, the inorganic glass has drawbacks such that it is heavy and easily breaks, and has bad productivity when producing a product by molding and processing. As a result, a transparent organic polymer material (optical resin) has been used as a material in place of the inorganic glass. As the optical part obtained from such an optical resin, there are, for example, a plastic lens such as a spectacle lens for vision correction or a camera lens of a digital camera, and the like. The optical parts have been put to practical use and have come into use. In particular, for the purpose of use in a spectacle lens for vision correction, the plastic lens is light-weight and hardly broken, and can be tinted for granting great fashionability,<br>
as compared to the lens made of an inorganic glass. Making good use of such merits, the plastic lens has been widely used.<br>
[0003]<br>
In the past, a crosslinking type resin obtained by casting polymerization of diethylene glycol bis (allyl carbonate) hereinafter, referred to as a DAC resin) as an optical resin used for a spectacle lens under heating has been put to practical use.  It has merits such that transparency and heat resistance are excellent, and the chromatic aberration is low.  Due to such merits, it has been used the most for a general-purpose plastic spectacle lens for vision correction.  However, there are problems like poor wearing comfort and fashionability because the central or edge thickness of the plastic lens becomes large due to the low refractive index (nd=1.50) . Therefore, a resin for a plastic lens with a high refractive index capable of solving these problems has been demanded and developed accordingly.<br>
[0004]<br>
During such a trend, since polythiourethane containing a sulfur atom obtained by casting polymerization of a diisocyanate compound with a polythiol compound is excellent in its transparency and impact resistance, while achieving highly superior characteristics such as attaining a high refractive index (nd = 1.6 to 1.7) and having relatively low chromatic aberration, and the like, polythiourethane has been used for the purpose of a high-quality plastic spectacle lens for vision correction in which the thickness is thin and its weight is light.<br>
[0005]<br>
On the other hand, in a trend to pursue an optical resin having a much higher refractive index, there have been proposed several resins such as a transparent resin obtained by polymerization of a compound having an episulfide group (Patent Documents 1 and 2) or a resin obtained by polymerization of a compound having a thietane group (Patent Document 3) , or a resin obtained by polymerization of a Se-containing compound (Patent Document 4).  However, the transparent resin obtained by polymerization of a compound having an episulfide group has a problem in mechanical properties; the compound having a thietane group has a problem in polymerizability; and the resin obtained by polymerization of a Se-containing metal compound has a problem in safety.  Therefore, they have been demanded for further improvement.  In recent years, there has been demanded and developed an optical resin with a high refractive index, having required general properties (transparency, thermal properties, mechanical properties, and the like) as a plastic lens, while attaining a much higher refractive index (nd) exceeding 1.7, for example.  Under these circumstances, there has been newly developed a metal-containing thietane compound, and there has been proposed an optical resin having a high refractive index (nd) exceeding 1.7 (Patent Document 5).<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]<br>

Furthermore, if a divalent thiol compound is selected, it is preferable to use a mixture of a thiol compound containing a polymerizable group and/or a trivalent or higher thiol compound.<br>
[0122]<br>
More specifically, the thiol compound is at least one selected from the group consisting of 3-mercaptothietane, 4-mercaptomethyl-l,8-dimercapto-3,6-dithiaoctane, 4,8-dimercaptomethyl-l,ll-dimercapto-3,6,9-trithiaundecane, and 2,5-bis(mercaptomethyl)-1,4-dithiane.<br>

[0123]<br>
As for the amount of the thiol compound used, based on 100 parts by weight of the total weight of the compound represented by General Formula (1) and the thiol compound, if the amount of the thiol compound used is too low, improvement in color and mechanical strength is unfavorably reduced in some cases.  Furthermore, if the amount of the thiol compound used is too high, based on 100 parts by weight of the total weight of the compound represented by General Formula (1) and the thiol compound, reduction in the heat resistance is unfavorably significant, in some cases.<br>
[0124]<br>
Thus, it is preferable that the thiol compound is used in an amount of 1 to 50 part(s) by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total weight of the compound represented by General Formula (1) and the thiol compound. It is further more preferable that the thiol compound is used in an amount of 1 to 25 part(s) by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total weight of the compound represented by General Formula (1) and the thiol compound.<br>
[0125]<br>
Since the polymerizable composition of the present invention contains the compound represented by General Formula (1) and the thiol compound, the obtained resin can have improved mechanical properties and color, for example.<br>
[0126]<br>
Furthermore, as the polymerizable composition of the present invention, the compound represented by General Formula (1) may be used singly, or a plurality of the different compounds represented by General Formula (1) may be used together.<br>
[0127]<br>
Furthermore, the polymerizable composition of the present invention contains the compound represented by General Formula (1) and the thiol compound as essential components, and further, it may contain sulfur as a monomer.  Further addition of sulfur as a monomer to the polymerizable composition composed of the compound represented by General Formula (1) and the thiol compound is one preferable embodiment that facilitates further high refractive indices.  Here, if necessary, a polymerization catalyst can be further contained.<br>
Furthermore, the compound may be represented by General Formula (1) , wherein m=0, and X1 is a sulfur atom.<br>
[0128]<br>
Sulfur as a monomer, used in the polymerizable composition according to the invention, refers to inorganic sulfur, and if used for the resin composition in the present invention or a transparent resin employing the composition, the purity is preferably 98% or more, more preferably 99% or more, and even more preferably 99.5% or more. In order to increase the purity, a method for removing volatile components is preferably used in some cases.<br>
[0129]<br>
Furthermore, the form of sulfur as a monomer is in any form, for example, that can be dissolved in the compound represented by General Formula (1) , and preferably in the form of powders, and more preferably in the form of fine powders.<br>
[0130]<br>
In the present invention, if the polymerizable composition containing the compound represented by General Formula (1) and the thiol compound is used, for example, to provide a resin having a higher refractive index, sulfur as a monomer may be added to the polymerizable composition.<br>
[0131]<br>
As for the amount of sulfur added to the polymerizable composition, from the viewpoint of a high refractive index, based on 100 parts by weight of the total weight of the compound represented by General Formula (1) , the thiol compound, and sulfur, if the amount of sulfur added as a monomer is too low, the effect of improvement<br>
in the refractive indices is unfavorably low in some cases. Furthermore, if the amount of sulfur added as a monomer is too high based on 100 parts by weight of the total weight of the compound represented by General Formula (1), the thiol compound, and sulfur, fogging unfavorably occurs in some cases.<br>
[0132]<br>

[0167]<br>
The used amount of the epoxy compound and/or the episulfide compound varies depending on the structure of the compound to be used and the structure or used amount of the thiol compound, but it is preferably 25% by weight or less based on the total amount of the polymerizable composition of the invention, from the viewpoint of a refractive index of the resin to be obtained. It is more preferably<br>
23% by weight or less, and even more preferably 20% by weight or less. From the viewpoint of color and mechanical strength of the resin to be obtained, it is preferably 2.5% by weight or more.<br>
[0168]<br>
The epoxy compound and/or the episulfide compound can be used singly or in combination thereof, and the ratio thereof is not particularly limited.  Furthermore, a plurality of the same epoxy compounds or the different epoxy compounds, or the same episulfide compounds or the different episulfide compounds may also be used in combination.  However, in order to obtain a resin having a high refractive index, it is preferable to use an episulfide compound.<br>
[0169]<br>
As for the ratio of the thiol compound used and the episulfide compound used, the ratio of the functional groups (SH groups/(epoxy groups + episulfide groups)) that is the ratio of the thiol groups in the thiol compound and the epoxy groups and/or episulfide groups in the epoxy compound and/or the episulfide compound is preferably 0.7 or more from the viewpoint of resin color. It is more preferably from 0.9 to 5, and even more preferably from 0. 9 to 3. If the ratio of the functional groups is too low, the obtained resin may be unfavorable due to the reduced transparency, whereas if the ratio is too high, the obtained resin may also be unfavorable due to the reduced heat resistance.<br>
[0170]<br>
If the polymerizable composition further includes the epoxy compound and/or the episulfide compound, the content of the compound represented by General Formula (1) in the total weight of the<br>
polymerizable compounds contained in the polymerizable composition of the present invention is not particularly limited, but it is usually 10% by weight or more.<br>
[0171]<br>
As the content of the compound represented by General Formula<br>
(1) is increased, there is a tendency that materials having higher<br>
refractive indice are obtained.  Thus, the content is preferably 30%<br>
by weight or more, more preferably 50% by weight or more, and even<br>
more preferably 70% by weight or more.<br>
[0172]<br>
However, if the content of the compound represented by General Formula (1) is too high, it relatively reduces the content of the thiol compound and the epoxy compound and/or the episulfide compound. From the viewpoint of improving the color of the resin and suppressing the reduction in mechanical strength, the content of the compound represented by General Formula (1) in the polymerizable composition is preferably 95% by weight or less.<br>
[0173]<br>
Furthermore, if the polymerizable composition further includes the epoxy compound and/or the episulfide compound, the amount of the thiol compound used depends on the structure of the compound used and the structure or amount of the epoxy compound and/or the episulfide compound.  However, since the compound represented by General Formula (1) provides a resin having a high refractive index, generally addition of a thiol compound leads to reduction in the refractive index of the obtained resin.  Thus, from the viewpoint of the refractive index of the obtained resin, it is contained in an amount<br>
of preferably 35% by weight or less based on the total amount of the polymerizable composition of the present invention, more preferably 30% by weight or less, and even more preferably 25% by weight or less. From the viewpoint of the color and the mechanical strength of the obtained resin, the amount is preferably 2.5% by weight or more.<br>
[0174]<br>
The polymerizable composition of the present invention includes the compound represented by General Formula (1) , the thiol compound, and a compound including a thietane compound containing no metal, and if necessary, a polymerization catalyst. Furthermore, the compound may be represented by General Formula (1) , wherein m=0, and X1 is a sulfur atom.<br>
[0175]<br>
The thietane compound containing no metal used in the present invention is a compound containing no metal in the molecule. The thietane compound containing no metal more specifically represents the compound represented by the following General Formula (8) , having one or more thietanyl groups in the molecule, and it can be any one having a structure that is compatible with the compound represented by General Formula (1).<br>

[0184]<br>
The amount of the thietane compound containing no metal used depends on the structure of the compound used and the structure or amount of the thiol compound used, but it is preferably 25% by weight or less based on the total amount of the polymerizable composition, from the viewpoint of the refractive index of the obtained resin. It is more preferably 23% by weight or less, and even more preferably 20% by weight or less.  From the viewpoint of the color and the mechanical strength of the obtained resin, it is preferably 2.5% by weight or more.<br>
[0185]<br>
As the thietane compound containing no metal, the thietane compounds containing no metal may be used singly, or a plurality of the different the thietane compounds containing no metal may also be used together.  However, the amount ratio is not particularly limited.<br>
[0186]<br>
As for the ratio of the thiol compound used and the thietane compound containing no metal used, the ratio of the functional groups (SH groups/thietanyl groups), that is the ratio of the thiol groups in the thiol compound and the thietanyl groups in the thietane compound containing no metal, is preferably 0.7 or more from the viewpoint of the color of the resin. It is more preferably from 0.9 to 5, and even more preferably from 0.9 to 3. If the ratio of the functional groups is too low, the obtained resin unfavorably has the reduced transparency in some cases, whereas if the ratio is too high, the obtained resin unfavorably has the reduced heat resistance in some cases.<br>
[0187]<br>
If the polymerizable composition further includes the thietane compound containing no metal, the content of the compound represented by General Formula (1) in the total weight of the polymerizable compounds contained in the polymerizable composition of the present invention is not particularly limited, but it is usually 10% by weight or more.<br>
[0188]<br>
As the content of the compound represented by General Formula<br>
(1) is increased, there is a tendency that materials having higher refractive indice are obtained. Thus, the content is preferably 30% by weight or more, more preferably 50% by weight or more, and even more preferably 70% by weight or more.<br>
[0189]<br>
However, if the content of the compound represented by General Formula (1) is too high, it relatively reduces the content of the thiol compound and the thietane compound containing no metal. From the viewpoint of improving the color of the resin and suppressing the reduction in mechanical strength, the content of the compound represented by General Formula (1) in the polymerizable composition is preferably 95% by weight or less.<br>
[0190]<br>
Furthermore, if the polymerizable composition further includes the thietane compound containing no metal, the amount of the thiol compound used depends on the structure of the compound used and the structure or amount of the thietane compound containing no metal. However, since the compound represented by General Formula (1) provides a resin having a high refractive index, generally addition of a thiol compound leads to reduction in the refractive index of the obtained resin. Thus, from the viewpoint of the refractive index of the obtained resin, it is contained in an amount of preferably 35% by weight or less based on the total amount of the polymerizable composition of the present invention, more preferably 30% by weight or less, and even more preferably 25% by weight or less. From the viewpoint of the color of the obtained resin, the amount is preferably 2.5% by weight or more.<br>
[0191]<br>
Furthermore, the polymerizable composition of the present invention may include one or two or more kinds of said components. For example, the polymerizable composition may include at least one of the compound having a carbon-carbon double bond, the iso(thio)cyanate compound, the epoxy compound and/or the episulfide compound, and the thietane compound containing no metal atom in the molecular structure, and sulfur as a monomer.  In this case, the polymerizable composition can be polymerized to provide the obtained resin with a higher refractive index.<br>
[0192]<br>
As for the amount of sulfur added, from the viewpoint of a high refractive index, if the amount of sulfur added is too low, the effect of improvement in the refractive indices is unfavorably low in some cases. Furthermore, if the amount of sulfur added as a monomer is too high fogging unfavorably occurs in some cases. Thus, the amount of sulfur added based on the total amount of the polymerizable composition of the present invention is preferably 5 to 50 parts by weight, and preferably 5 to 25 parts by weight.<br>
[0193]<br>
Furthermore, from the viewpoint of better balance among the refractive index, the mechanical properties, and the color of the polymerizable composition of the present invention, the molar ratio of the thiol groups in the polymerizable composition may be 1 or more, based on the total the iso(thio) cyanate groups, the epoxy groups, the episulfide groups, the carbon-carbon double bonds, and the thietanyl groups in the thietane compound containing no metal atom.<br>
That is, the molar ratio expressed by SH groups/(NCO groups and/or NCS groups + epoxy groups + episulfide groups + carbon-carbon double bonds + thietanyl groups) may be 1 or more.<br>
[0194]<br>
The polymerizable composition of the present invention includes the compound represented by General Formula (1) and the thiol compound as essential components, and further, it may contain a polymerization catalyst as described later.<br>
In the present invention, since the compound represented by General Formula (1) includes a compound that does not require particularly a polymerization catalyst, and auto-catalytically proceeds polymerization reaction, the polymerization catalyst may be used, if desired.<br>
In this case, as the compound represented by General Formula (1), the compound represented by General Formula (1) may be used singly, or a plurality of the different compounds may be used together.<br>
[0195]<br>
The content of the compound represented by General Formula (1) in the total weight of the polymerizable compounds contained in the polymerizable composition of the present invention is not particularly limited, but it is usually 10% by weight or more, and from the viewpoint of the high refractive index, it is preferably 30% by weight or more, more preferably 50% by weight or more, and even more preferably 70% by weight or more.<br>
Furthermore, the components other than the compound represented by General Formula (1) often decrease the refractive index of the resin obtained by using the polymerizable composition,<br>
and as a result, in order to obtain a resin having a high refractive index, it is preferable that the content of the compound represented by General Formula (1) in the total weight of the polymerizable compounds is 50% by weight or more.<br>
[0196]<br>

[0200]<br>
The polymerization catalyst of the polymerizable composition according to the present invention is added in a proportion of 0.0001 to 10% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, more preferably 0.01% by weight to 5% by weight, and most preferably 0.01% by weight<br>
to 1% by weight, based on the total amount of the polymerizable composition.<br>
With the amount of the polymerization catalyst added in this range, a sufficiently cured resin can be produced, and a pot life can be maintained.  Also, the obtained resin has good transparency and optical physical properties in some cases. [0201]<br>
The polymerization catalyst may be added directly to the polymerizable compositions or some of the compounds thereof, or may be dissolved or dispersed in another compound and then added.  In some cases, the polymerization catalyst is preferably dissolved or dispersed in another compound and then added, for obtaining good results in some cases.

[0202]<br>
The polymerizable composition of the present invention may include other polymerizable compounds, in addition to the compound represented by General Formula (1) , within the range not interfering with the desired effects of the present invention.<br>
[0203]<br>
Examples of the polymerizable compound include various polymerizable monomers or polymerizable oligomers, known in the art.<br>
Examples thereof include a (meth) acrylic acid ester compound, a vinyl compound, an epoxy compound, an episulfide compounds, an oxetane compound, a thietane compound and the like. [0204]<br>
The amount of the other polymerizable compounds occupied in the total weight of the polymerizable compounds contained in the polymerizable composition of the present invention is not particularly limited. But usually the refractive index becomes low by adding the other polymerizable compounds, it is usually not more than 90% by weight, preferably not more than 70% by weight, more preferably not more than 50% by weight, and further preferably not more than 30% by weight.  Furthermore, if the polymerizable composition of the present invention includes other polymerizable compounds, the content of the other polymerizable compounds is not particularly limited in their lower limits.<br>
[0205]<br>
As essential requirements for the polymerizable composition according to the present invention, the polymerizable composition includes the compound represented by General Formula (1) and the thiol compound.<br>
For the purpose of following improvement of the resin obtained by curing the polymerizable composition or following improvement of handling ability thereof, it may be preferable to subject the polymerizable composition of the invention to means and operations that are generally used upon synthesizing organic compounds, such as purification or washing, thermal insulation, cold storage, filtration or depressurization treatment, or to add known compounds<br>
or the like as stabilizers or resin modifying agents.  The improvement of the resin or the improvement of handling ability thereof includes further adjustment of the optical properties of the resin such as refractive index or Abbe number; the adjustment of various properties of the resin such as color, light resistance or weather resistance, heat resistance, impact resistance, hardness, specific gravity, linear expansion coefficient, polymerization shrinkage ratio, water absorbability, hygroscopicity, chemical resistance and viscoelasticity; the adjustment of transmittance or transparency; and the adjustment of the viscosity and handling ability of other storage or transportation method of the polymerizable composition. Examples of compounds added for improving stability such as long-term preservation stability, polymerization stability and thermal stability include a polymerization retardant, a polymerization inhibitor, a deoxidant, and an antioxidant.<br>
[0206]<br>
Purification of the polymerizable composition is a means for improving the transparency of the resin produced by curing, or increasing the purity of the resin to improving the hue thereof. As a method for purifying the polymerizable composition containing the compound having the structure represented by Formula (1) of the present invention, any known method, for example, distillation, recrystallization, column chromatography (a silica gel method, an activated carbon method, an ion-exchange resin method, or the like) , extraction, or the like, may be performed with any timing as long as the transparency and hue of the resin obtained by curing the purified composition are improved.<br>
[0207]<br>
As a method for washing the polymer!zable composition, a method for improving the transparency and hue of the resin obtained by curing may be used with timing when or after the synthesized polymerizable composition is taken out.  In this method, the composition is washed with a polar and/or nonpolar solvent to remove or reduce a resin transparency inhibitor, for example, an inorganic salt used for synthesizing the polymerizable composition or secondarily produced in synthesizing the composition, such as an ammonium salt, thiourea, or the like.  Although the solvent used depends upon the polymerizable composition to be cleaned and the polarity of a solution containing the polymerizable composition, and is not limited, a solvent which can dissolve a component to be removed, and which is incompatible with the polymerizable composition to be cleaned and the solution containing the polymerizable composition is preferably used. The solvent may be used singly, or a mixture of at least two solvents may be used.  Although the amount of a component to be removed depends upon the purpose and application, the amount is preferably as low as possible.  The amount is preferably 5000 ppm or less, and more preferably 1000 ppm or less.<br>
[0208]<br>
As a hot insulation, cold insulation or filtration method for the polymerizable composition, a method for improving the transparency and hue of the resin obtained by curing is generally used with timing when or after the synthesized polymerizable composition is taken out.  In the hot insulation method, for example, when the polymerizable composition is crystallized to deteriorate<br>
handleability during storage, the polymerizable composition is melted by heating within a range causing no deterioration in the performance of the polymerizable composition and the resin obtained by curing the polymerizable composition. Although the heating temperature range and heat melting method depend upon the compound constituting the polymerizable composition to be handled and are not limited, the heating temperature is generally in a range of the solidification point+50°C., and preferably the solidification point-t-20°C.  In this method, the composition may be melted by mechanically stirring with a stirring device or bubbling with an inert gas for moving an internal liquid.  The cold insulation method is generally performed for improving the preservation stability of the polymerizable composition.  However, when the composition has a high melting point and consideration must be given to the storage temperature in order to improve handleability after crystallization. Although the cold insulation temperature depends upon the structure and preservation stability of the compound constituting the polymerizable composition to be handled and is not limited, the polymerizable composition containing a compound having the structure represented by Formula (1) is typically required to be stored at a temperature no higher than a temperature that maintains stability of the polymerizable composition containing the compound represented by General Formula (1).<br>
[0209]<br>
Furthermore, in the case where the polymerizable composition according to the present invention is a polymerizable composition used for optical applications, it is required to have high<br>
transparency, and thus typically it is preferable that the polymerizable composition is filtered with a filter having a small pore size.  Although the pore size of the filter used is usually 0.05 to 10 um, the pore size is preferably 0. 05 to 5 jam, and more preferably 0.1 to 5 (j,m, from the viewpoint of operationality and performance. In many cases, filtration of the polymerizable composition containing the sulfur-containing cyclic compound of the present invention produces good results without exception. Although a low filtration temperature near the solidification temperature produces more desirable results in some cases, filtration is preferably performed at a temperature causing no trouble in the filtration work when solidification proceeds during filtration.<br>
[0210]<br>
The reduced-pressure treatment is a means for removing a solvent, dissolved gas and odor which deteriorate the performance of the resin generally produced by curing the polymerizable composition.  Since a dissolved solvent generally decreases the refractive index of the resultant resin and deteriorates the heat resistance thereof, the dissolved solvent must be removed as much as possible. Although the allowable amount of the dissolved solvent depends upon the structure of the compound constituting the polymerizable composition to be handled and the structure of the dissolved solvent and is not limited, the allowable amount is usually 1% or less, and preferably 5000 ppm or less.  The dissolved gas inhibits polymerization or causes the problem of mixing bubbles in the resultant resin, and is thus preferably removed.  Particularly, a moisture gas such as water vapor or the like is preferably removed<br>
by bubbling with a dry gas.  The amount of the dissolved gas depends upon the structure of the compound constituting the polymerizable composition, the physical properties, structure and type of the dissolved gas.<br>
[0211]<br>
Examples of the method for preparing the polymerizable composition of the present invention typically include a method including using a compound represented by General Formula (1) and a thiol compound, and other components such as sulfur as a monomer, and if necessary, using the above-described various known polymerizable compounds in combination, and then if necessary, adding the polymerization catalyst, mixing, and dissolving.<br>
[0212]<br>
In curing and molding the polymerizable composition of the present invention, a known molding method may be used according to purposes, and various additives in addition to the above-described additives, such as a stabilizer, a resin modifier, a chain extender, a crosslinking agent, a photostabilizer including a HALS-type photostabilizer or the like, an ultraviolet light absorber including a benzotriazole ultraviolet light absorber or the like, an antioxidant including a hindered phenol antioxidant or the like, a coloring inhibitor, a dye or bluing agent including an anthraquinone disperse dye or the like, a filler, an external mold releasing agent including a silicone-based external mold releasing agent, or an internal mold releasing agent including a surfactant such as acidic phosphate, quaternary ammonium salt or quaternary phosphonium salt, and an adhesion improving agent may be used.  Here, the internal mold<br>
releasing agent includes those that exhibit releasing effect among various additives as described above.<br>
[0213]<br>
Although the amount of each of the additives which can be added depends upon the type, structure and effect of each additive arid is not limited, the adding amount is usually in the range of 0.001% by weight to 10% by weight, and preferably 0.01 to 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the polymerizable composition. The amount of the dye added is preferably in the range of 1 ppb to 100 ppm, not in the above-described range. Within these ranges, a sufficiently cured resin can be produced, and the obtained resin has good transparency and optical physical properties in some cases.<br>
[0214]<br>
Next, the resin according to the present invention will be described.<br>
The resin and the optical part composed of such a resin according to the present invention are obtained by polymerization of said polymerizable composition.  Furthermore, the method for preparing the resin according to the present invention involves a process for polymerization of the polymerizable composition according to the present invention.  Such polymerization is suitably carried out according to various methods known in the art, used when producing plastic lenses. A typical method includes a casting polymerization.<br>
[0215]<br>
Namely, the polymerizable composition of the present invention produced by the above method is degassed under a reduced pressure or filtered off, as required, and then the polymerizable composition<br>
is poured into a mold, and heated as required for carrying out polymerization.  In this case, it is preferable to carry out polymerization by slowly heating from a low temperature to a high temperature.<br>
[0216]<br>
The mold as described above is composed of, for example, two pieces of mirror surface-ground molds via a gasket made of polyethylene, an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, and polyvinyl chloride.  Typical examples of the mold include, though not restricted to, combined molds such as glass and glass, glass and plastic plate, and glass and metal plate.  The mold may comprise two pieces of molds fixed by a tape such as a polyester adhesive tape or the like.  In addition, a known method such as the mold release process may be performed for the mold, as needed.<br>
[0217]<br>
When carrying out casting polymerization, the polymerization temperature is affected by the polymerization conditions such as the kind of the polymerization initiator, and the like, and is not particularly limited.  But, it is usually from -50°C to 200°C, preferably from -20°C to 170°C, and more preferably from 0 to 150°C.<br>
[0218]<br>
The polymerization temperature affects the polymerization time, but it is usually from 0.01 to 200 hours and preferably from 0.05 to 100 hours. Polymerization can also be carried out in combination of several temperatures by conducting low temperature, temperature elevation, and temperature dropping as required.<br>
[0219]<br>
Furthermore, the polymerizable composition of the present invention can be polymerized by applying the active energy line such as an electron beam, ultraviolet light, visible light or the like. At this time, a radical polymerization catalyst or a cationic polymerization catalyst for initiating polymerization by the active energy line is used, as required.<br>
[0220]<br>
If the heat resistance of the obtained resin is too low, some problems, such as thermal deformation, in the use as glass lens in daily life occur in some cases.  On the other hand, if the heat resistance of the obtained resin is too high, some problems such as resin intingibility of the resin occur in some cases.  In consideration of tingibility, the heat resistance of the obtained resin preferably has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of ]00°C to 150°C.<br>
Here, Tg is a temperature that is measured by a TMA (Thermal Mechanical Analysis) penetration method, from the cross-points in a TMA curve, which corresponds a heat distortion beginning temperature.<br>
[0221]<br>
After the thus-obtained resin and the optical lens composed of the resin are cured, they may be subjected to an annealing process as required. Furthermore, for purposes of anti-reflection, high hardness grant, wear resistance improvement, anti-fogging property grant or fashionability grant, various known physical or chemical processes such as surface polishing, antistatic treatment, hard coat treatment, non-reflective coat treatment, anti-reflective treatment,<br>
tinting treatment, and photochromic treatment (for example, photochromic lens process), may be performed as needed.<br>
[0222]<br>
Furthermore, for the optical lens including the obtained resin and the optical lens including the resin, if necessary, coating layers may be formed on either or both of the surfaces and used. Hereinbelow, the optical lens will be described by way of an example. Examples of the coating layer include a primer layer, a hard coat layer, an anti-reflection layer, an anti-fogging coat film layer, and an anti-fouling layer, a water-repellent layer. These coating layers may be used alone, respectively, or a plurality of coating layers may be formed into a multi-layer to be used. In the case of providing coating layers on both sides, the coating layers provided on each side may either be the same with or different from each other.<br>
[0223]<br>
For those coating layers, there may be employed in combination known additive agents for the purpose of improving properties of lenses. In particular,an UV absorber for the purpose of protecting lenses or eyes from UV light, an IR absorber for the purpose of protecting eyes from infrared rays, a light stabilizer or antioxidant for the purpose of improving the weatherability of lenses, dye or pigment for the purpose of increasing fashionability of lenses, photochromic dye or photochromic pigment, an antistatic agent, and other known additives for improving the properties of lenses, respectively.  Various leveling agents for improving the coatability may also be used for the layer which to be coated by application.<br>
[0224]<br>
The primer layer is usually formed between after<br>
mentioned the hard coat layer and lenses. The primer layer is typically a coating layer provided for the purpose of improving the adhesiveness between the hard coat layer and lenses, and there may be a case where the impact resistance is also improved.<br>
[0225]<br>
For the primer layer, any material can be used as long as it provides high adhesivity to the obtained optical lens, and usually employed are an urethane-based resin, an epoxy-based resin, a polyester-based resin, a melanin-based resin, a primer composition mainly including polyvinylacetal.  For the purpose of adjusting the viscosity of the composition, an appropriate solvent can be used, which does not affect the lens, in the primer composition.  Of course, the solvent may not be used.<br>
[0226]<br>
The primer composition can be formed by either of an application process or a dry process. If the application process is used, a spin coat, a dip coat, or the like is applied on the lens by means of a known application process, and then solidified to form a primer layer. If the dry process is used, the primer layer is formed by means of a CVD process, a vacuum deposition process, or the like. In order to improve the adhesion when the primer layer is formed, if necessary, the surfaces of the lens may be subject to preliminary treatments such as alkali treatment, plasma treatment, and ultraviolet light treatment.<br>
[0227]<br>
The hard coat layer is a coating layer provided for the purpose<br>
of giving functions such as an anti-scratching property, abrasion resistance, humidity resistance, hot-water resistance, heat resistance, and weather resistance, to the lens surface.<br>
[0228]<br>
For the hard coat layer, an organosilicon compound having curing property, and a hard coat composition having at least one particulate oxide of element selected from the group consisting of Si, Al, Sn, Sb, Ta, Ce, La, Fe, Zn, W, Zr, In, and Ti and/or at least one particulate constituted of a composite oxide of two or more elements selected from the group consisting of those elements, are generally used.  The fine particles composed of the oxide fine particles and/or the composite oxide may be used singly, or in combination of two or more kinds thereof in the hard coat composition. The hard coat composition preferably includes, in addition to said components, at least one selected from amines, amino acids, metal acetyl acetate complexes, organic acid salts, pechloric acids, pechloric acid salts, acids, metal chlorides, and polyfunctional epoxy compounds.  For the hard coat composition, an appropriate solvent can be used, which does not affect the lens.  Of course, the solvent may not be used.<br>
[0229]<br>
The hard coat layer is usually formed by applying a hard coat composition using a known process such as spin coat, and dip coat, and then curing it. Examples of the curing process include a thermal curing process, a curing process using an energy ray such as an ultraviolet light and a visible light. In order to inhibit generation of the interference fringe, the refractive index of the hard coat<br>
layer is preferably in the range of the refractive index of the lens ± 0.1.<br>
[0230]<br>
The antireflection layer is usually formed on said hard coat layer, if necessary. There are an inorganic type and an organic type for the antiref lection layer, and the inorganic type is provided by the use of inorganic oxide such as SiC&gt;2 and TiOa in accordance with the dry method such as a vacuum evaporation technique, a sputtering method, an ion plating method, an ion beam assist method, and a CVD method. The organic type is provided by the use of a composition which includes an organosilicon compound and a silica particle having internal cavity, in accordance with the wet method.<br>
[0231]<br>
The anti-reflection layer may be a mono-layer or a multi-leiyer, and if it is used as a mono-layer, it is preferable that its refractive index is lower than that of the hard coat layer by at least 0.1 or more.  In order to exhibit the anti-reflection function more effectively, a multi-layer is preferable as the anti-reflection layer. In this case, a layer having a low refractive index and a layer having a high refractive index are stacked alternately.  Also, in this case, the difference in the refractive indices of the layer having a low refractive index and the layer having a high refractive index ex is preferably 0.1 or more.  Examples of the layer having a high refractive index include ZnO, Ti02, Ce02, Sb205, Sn02/ Zr02, and Ta205 layer , and the film having a refractive index include a Si02 layer .<br>
[0232] If necessary, an antifogging coat layer, an anti-staining layer,<br>
and a water-repellent layer may be further formed on the antireflection layer. As the means for forming the antifogging coat layer, the anti-staining layer, and the water-repellent layer, methods and materials for the treatment thereof, or the like are not particularly limited as long as it is within the scope of not adversely affecting the antireflection properties, and there may be employed a generally known antifogging coat treatment method, anti-staining treatment method, water-repellent treatment method, and materials.<br>
For example, examples of the methods for anti-fogging coat and anti-fouling treatment include a method of covering a surface with a surfactant, a method of adding a hydrophilic layer on a surface to give absorptivity, a method of covering a surface with a fine unevenness to increase absorptivity, a method of using the activity of a photo-catalyst to give absorptivity, and a method of performing an ultra-water-repellency treatment to prevent attachment of water drops.<br>
Furthermore, examples of the water-repellency treatment method include a method of forming a water-repellent treatment layer by deposition or sputtering with a fluorine-containing silane compound, or the like, and a method of dissolving a fluorine-containing silane compound in a solvent, and then performing coating to form a water-repellency treated layer.<br>
[0233]<br>
In addition, the obtained resin, and optical lens composed of the resin may be tinted for a use with the use of a dye appropriate for the purpose so as to provide fashionability or photochromic property.  Hereinbelow, the tinting of optical lens will be described<br>
by way of an example.<br>
[0234]<br>
Tinting of the optical lens can be carried out in accordance with a generally known tinting method, and is carried out generally by the following methods:<br>
(a)	a method of immersing a lens in a dye liquid;<br>
(b)	a method of subjecting coating with the use of a coating<br>
agent containing a dye, or providing a coating layer which can be<br>
tinted and tinting the provided coating layer;<br>
(c)	a method of polymerizing monomer raw materials in which<br>
materials which can be tinted are contained;<br>
(d)	a method of heating a sublimation dye to allow sublimation;<br>
or the like.<br>
[0235]<br>
The method (a) is a method including immersing a lens material finished on a predetermined optical surface in a dye liquid in which the dye to be used is dissolved or uniformly dispersed (tinting process) , and solidifying the dye on the lens by heating (annealing process after tinting), if necessary.<br>
[0236]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the dye used in the tinting process and generally known dye can be used, but an oil-soluble dye or a disperse dye is usually used.  The solvent used in the tinting process is not particularly limited as long as it is the solvent in which the dye to be used can be dissolved or uniformly dispersed therein.<br>
In the tinting process, a surfactant for dispersing the dye<br>
in a dye liquid or a carrier which encourages tinting may also be employed, if necessary.<br>
[0237]<br>
In the tinting process, a colorant and a surfactant that is added, if necessary, are dispersed in water, or a mixture of water and an organic solvent, to prepare a tinting bath.  An optical lens is immersed in the tinting bath to perform tinting at a predetermined temperature for a predetermined time.  The tinting temperature and time vary depending on the color density, but they are usually 120°C or lower and several minutes to several decades, respectively. Tinting is performed at a concentration of the tinting bath of around 0.01 to 10% by weight.  Furthermore, if it is difficult to tint, the tinting is performed under pressure.  The annealing process, that is performed, if necessary, after tinting, is a process in which the tinted lens greige is subject to heat treatment.  The heat treatment is, for example, an infrared heating treatment at an atmosphere, or a resistant heating treatment, thereby allowing a predetermined retention in an oven, after removing water remaining on the surface of the tinted lens greige in the tinting process with a solvent, or the like, or removing the solvent by blowing air.  The annealing process after tinting prevents the tinted lens greige from decoloration (decoloration-preventing treatment), as well as remove the moisture penetrated into the inside of the lens greige upon tinting.<br>
[0238]<br>
The method (b) is not for directly tinting a plastic lens material, and it is the method either including a process of coating<br>
a plastic lens with an organic coating liquid in which a dye is dispersed or dissolved and subjecting to a curing treatment to form a tinted coating layer on a lens surface, or a process of forming a coating layer which can be tinted on a plastic lens surface, and then performing the method (a) , that is, immersing the plastic lens in a dye liquid, and subjecting to heating to be tinted.<br>
[0239]<br>
The method (c) is a method including preliminarily dissolving a dye in monomer raw materials for a plastic lens and thereafter carrying out a polymerization. The dye to be used is not particularly limited as long as it can be uniformly dissolved or dispersed to the extent of not deteriorating the optical properties, in monomer raw materials.<br>
[0240]<br>
As the method (d), there may be employed the following (dl) to (d3):<br>
(dl) a method which includes sublimating a solid sublimation dye and tinting a plastic lens;<br>
(d2) a method which includes facing a plastic lens to a substrate to which a solution containing a sublimation dye is applied in a non-contacting manner, and heating the substrate and the lens to allow tinting; or<br>
(d3) a method which includes transferring a colored layer containing a sublimation dye and a transfer layer comprising an adhesive layer to a plastic lens, and thereafter heating to allow tinting.<br>
The resin of the invention and the optical lenses composed of<br>
the resin may be tinted in accordance with any of those methods. The dye to be used is not particularly limited as long as it is a dye having a sublimating property.<br>
[0241]<br>

3-Thietanol was synthesized in accordance with the method as described in Patent Document 3 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-327583) .<br>
[0272]<br>
Further, 3-mercaptothietane was synthesized using the obtained 3-thietanol.  That is, 190 g of thiourea, 253 g of a 35% hydrochloric acid solution and 250 g of water were introduced into a reactor equipped with a stirrer and a thermometer, and stirred, while 156 g of 3-thietanol was added dropwise to the reaction solution over<br>
1 hour.  The resulting solution was stirred and reacted at 30°C for 24 hours, and then 177 g of 24% ammonia water was added dropwise thereto over 1 hour.  The solution was further reacted at 30°C for 15 hours, and then allowed to stand for taking out an organic layer (lower layer) to obtain 134 g of a crude composition.
