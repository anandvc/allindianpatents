A	COMPOUND	(S)-2-ETHOXY-3[4-(2-{4-<br>
METHANESULFONYLOXYPHENYL}ETHOXY)PHENYL]-PROPANOIC	ACID<br>
HAVING   THE   FORMULA   (I)   AND   PROCESS   FOR   THE   PREPARATION THEREOF"<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB, a Swedish company, of S-15185 Sodertalje, Sweden<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention releates to a novel 3-aryl-2-hydroxypropionic acid derivative, to a process and intermediate for preparing such a compound, having the utility in clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance, to methods for its therapeutic use and to pharmaceutical compositions containing it.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Insulin resistance, defined as reduced sensitivity to the actions of insulin in the whole body or individual tissues such as skeletal muscle, myocardium, fat and liver prevail in many individuals with or without diabetes mellitus. The insulin resistance syndrome, IRS, refers to a cluster of manifestations including insulin resistance with accompanying hyperinsulinemia, possibly non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM); arterial hypertension; central (visceral) obesity; dyslipidemia observed as deranged lipoprotein levels typically characterized by elevated VLDL (very low density lipoproteins) and reduced HDL (high density lipoproteins) concentrations and reduced fibrinolysis.<br>
Recent epidemiological research has documented that individuals with insulin resistance run a greatly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, notably suffering from myocardial infarction and stroke. In non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus these atherosclerosis related conditions cause up to 80% of all deaths.<br>
In clinical medicine there is at present only limited awareness of the need to increase the insulin sensitivity in IRS and thus to correct the  dyslipidemia which is considered to cause the accelerated progress of atherosclerosis.<br><br>
Furthermore there is at present no pharmacotherapy available to adequately correct the metabolic derangements associated with IRS. To date, the treatment of NIDDM has been focused on correction of the deranged control of carbohydrate metabolism associated with the disease. Stimulation of endogenous insulin secretion by means of secretagogues, like sulphonylureas, and if necessary administration of exogenous insulin are methods frequently used to normalize blood sugar but that will, if anything, further enhance insulin resistance and will not correct the other manifestations of IRS nor reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition such treatment involves a significant risk of hypoglycemia with associated complications.<br>
Other therapeutic strategies have focused on aberrations in glucose metabolism or absorption, including biguanides, such as methformin, or glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose. Although these agents have been efficacious to a degree, their limited clinical effect is associated with side effects.<br>
A novel therapeutic strategy involves the use of insulin sensitizing agents, such as the thiazolidinediones, which, at least in part, mediate their effects via an agonistic action on nuclear receptors. Ciglitazone is the prototype in this class. In animal models of IRS these compounds seem to correct insulin resistance and the associated hypertriglyceridaemia and hyperinsulinemia, as well as hyperglycemia in diabetes, by improving insulin sensitivity via an effect on lipid transport and handling, leading to enhanced insulin action in skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue.<br>
Ciglitazone as well as later described thiazolidinediones in clinical development eidier have been discontinued reportedly due to unacceptable toxicity or show inadequate potency. Therefore there is a need for new and better compounds with insulin sensitizing properties.<br><br><br>

This reaction can be performed at different temperatures and pressures depending on the reactivity of the aimed reaction.<br>
In case of hydrogen transfer reaction with diethyl-2,5-dimethyl-l,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate the reaction can be conducted by mixing cquimolar amounts of reactants and warming the mixture to melting (140-250°C) in inert atmosphere or in vacuum.<br>

This step may be carried out in the presence of an inert solvent or in the absence of a solvent at a temperature between -20°C and the melting point for the mixture. It might be necessary to add a dehydrating agent in order to achieve the olefinic compound.<br>
In a typical such reaction the compounds of formula VIII and formula DC are mixed in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. Anhydrous potassium tert-butoxide is slowly added at low temperature i.e. - 20°C. The reaction is quenched with acetic acid. The crude product is<br><br>

Pharmacological properties<br>
The present compound of formula (I) will be adapted for prophylaxis and/or treatment of clinical conditions associated with reduced sensitivity to insulin (insulin resistance) and associated metabolic disorders. These clinical conditions will include, but will not be limited to, abdominal obesity, arterial hypertension, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia (non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)) and the dyslipidaemia (plasma lipoprotein disturbances) characteristically appearing with insulin resistance. This<br><br>
dyslipidaemia, also known as the atherogenic lipoprotein profile of phenotype B, is characterised by moderately elevated non-esterified fatty acids, elevated very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) triglycerides, low high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol and the presence of small, dense, low density lipoproteins (LDL). Treatment with the present compound is expected to lower the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with atherosclerosis. These cardiovascular disease conditions include macro-angiophaties causing myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial insufficiency of the lower extremities. Because of their insulin sensitizing effect the compound of formula (I) is also expected to reduce the progress of clinical conditions associated with chronic hyperglycaemia in diabetes like the micro-angiophaties causing renal disease and retinal damage. Furthermore the compound may be useful in treatment of various conditions outside the cardiovascular system associated with insulin resistance like the polycystic ovarian syndrome. The compound of the invention is a non-toxic insulin sensitizing agent with surprisingly good therapeutic effect and pharmacokinetic properties and without undesirable weight gain.<br>

A solution of 2-(4-methanesulfonyloxyphenyl)ethylmethanesulfonate (described in Example la) (2.41 g; 8.14 mmole) in acetonitrile (11.8 ml) was added to a mixture of (S)-2-ethoxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid ethyl ester (1.3 g; 5.46 mmole), potassium carbonate (2.26 g; 16.4 mmole) and magnesium sulfate (1 g) in acetonitrile (50 ml). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 19 hours. More of 2-(4-<br>

Biological activity<br>
The biological activity of the compound of the invention was tested in obese diabetic mice of the Umea ob/ob strain. Groups of mice received the test compound by gavage once daily for 7 days. On the last day of the experiment the animals were anesthetized 2h after dose in a non-fed state and blood was collected from an incised artery. Plasma was analyzed for concentration of glucose, insulin and triglycerides. A group of untreated obese diabetic mice of the same age served as control. The weight of the mice was measured before and after the experiment and the obtained weight gain was compared to the weight gain of the control animals. The individual values for glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels of the mice from the test group were expressed as the percent rage of the corresponding values from the control group.<br>
The desired "therapeutic effect" was calculated as the average percent reduction of the three variables glucose, insulin and triglycerides below the levels in the control animals. The therapeutic effect of the tested compounds according to the invention was compared to the same effect in the prior art compound troglitazone, administered by gavage in the oral dose of 100 uraol/kg for 7 days.<br>
The superior effects of the tested compound according to the invention compared to that of troglitazone when given in the same oral dose demonstrate the increased potency and efficiacy of the claimed compound.<br>
