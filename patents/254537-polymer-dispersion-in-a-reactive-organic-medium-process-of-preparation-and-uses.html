POLYMER DISPERSION IN A REACTIVE ORGANIC MEDIUM,<br>
PROCESS OF PREPARATION AND USES<br>
The invention relates to a polymer dispersion in a<br>
reactive organic medium obtained by radical dispersion<br>
po1ymerization.<br>
Polymers in solution or in suspension are widely used,<br>
in particular in the field of glass strands intended<br>
for the reinforcing of organic materials of the polymer<br>
type, to produce sizing or coating compositions.<br>
Glass strands used for reinforcing are generally<br>
produced industrially from molten glass streams flowing<br>
from the multiple orifices of a bushing. These streams<br>
are drawn mechanically in the form of continuous<br>
filaments and are then gathered together into base<br>
strands which are subsequently collected, for example<br>
by winding off on a rotating support. Before they are<br>
gathered together, the filaments are coated with a<br>
sizing composition by passing over a suitable device,<br>
such as coating rolls.<br>
The sizing composition is essential for the manufacture<br>
of the glass strands and for the production of the<br>
composite materials incorporating these strands.<br>
During the manufacture of the strand, the sizing<br>
composition protects the glass filaments from the<br>
abrasion which occurs when the latter rub at high speed<br>
over the various members for guiding and gathering<br>
together and gives cohesion to the strand by binding<br>
the filaments together.<br>
During the manufacture of the composite materials, the<br>
sizing composition makes possible the impregnation of<br>
the strand by the matrix to be reinforced, on the one<br>
hand, and improves the adhesion between the glass and<br>
said matrix, on the other hand, thus contributing to<br><br>
better mechanical properties being obtained.<br>
The glass strands can be used as they are or can be<br>
gathered together prior to their incorporation in the<br>
matrix to be reinforced, for example in the form of<br>
woven fabrics, used in particular for the reinforcing<br>
of polymer matrices, or of grids, when nonpolymer<br>
matrices are to be reinforced. In this case, it is<br>
necessary to apply a coating to the grid which allows<br>
it to withstand the handling operations and to retain<br>
intact its structure up to the final processing stage.<br>
The polymer solutions, emulsions and dispersions<br>
available for producing sizing or coating compositions<br>
are very largely based on water or on volatile organic<br>
solvent (s) .<br>
In point of fact, the presence of water or of organic<br>
solvent in the size or the coating has a harmful effect<br>
on the quality of the reinforcement in the composite<br>
material and consequently has to be avoided.<br>
Water is removed by drying under conditions which vary<br>
according to whether the composition employed is a size<br>
or a coating:<br>
in the case of a size, drying is carried out at a<br>
temperature generally varying from 100 to 130°C<br>
for a period of time which depends on the<br>
presentation of the strarid, from a few seconds for<br>
cut strands to a few hours for wound packages of<br>
strands (rovings). The stage of drying the rovings<br>
is carried out in specific large-scale plants and,<br>
for this reason, it represents a significant part<br>
of the production cost for the strand,<br>
in the case of a coating, drying is carried out on<br>
the production line at a temperature which varies<br>
from 130 to 250°C, in particular with hot air or<br>
infrared radiation, for a period of time not<br>
exceeding a few minutes, preferably 1 to 5<br><br>
minutes.<br>
The drying is the important stage of the process which<br>
has a direct effect on the speed of: the manufacturing<br>
line. If drying is carried out too quickly, for example<br>
at a high temperature in order to reduce the time,<br>
blistering of the composition may occur at the surface<br>
of the strands .<br>
Some compositions require recourse to organic solvents<br>
in order to dissolve and/or disperse and/or emulsify<br>
all or part of the constituents. The solvents can be<br>
used alone or added to the aqueous solutions, emulsions<br>
and dispersions in order to improve their properties,<br>
for example in order to reduce the viscosity in order<br>
to allow better penetration between the constituent<br>
filaments of the glass strand. The use of organic<br>
solvents, generally volatile organic solvents in order<br>
to remove them more easily, makes it necessary to take<br>
additional precautions due to their higher flammability<br>
and the greater risk to the health of the personnel<br>
handling the size or the coating on the manufacturing<br>
line. In addition, it is necessary to have available plants for the continuous treatment of the effluents in<br>
order to reduce to a minimum their discharge to the<br>
atmosphere. As regulations with regard to discharging<br>
are becoming increasingly restrictive, the treatment<br>
cost, both with regard to the plants themselves and<br>
with regard to their operation, is constantly<br>
increasing .<br>
Even if the solutions, emulsions and dispersions<br>
available on the market are relatively concentrated in<br>
polymer (40 to 80% by weight), they still comprise<br>
water and/or organic solvents, with the result that the<br>
drying stage cannot be avoided.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to provide a<br>
polymer dispersion devoid of water and of volatile<br><br>
organic solvent which is capable of being used in a<br>
sizing composition for glass strands or a coating<br>
composition for glass strands and assemblages of such<br>
strands.<br>
Another aim of the invention is to provide a polymer<br>
dispersion comprising a high polymer content which<br>
remains stable under the normal storage conditions.<br>
These aims are achieved by the dispersion according to<br>
the invention, which comprises the product from the<br>
polymerization of at least one vinyl monomer in the<br>
presence of a radical initiator in a reactive organic<br>
dispersing medium.<br>
According to the invention, an organic latex is formed<br>
composed of a polymer resulting from the in situ<br>
polymerization of one or more vinyl monomers capable of<br>
polymerizing by the radical route, this polymer being<br>
dispersed in an organic medium including one or more<br>
reactive groups which can react with other compounds in<br>
a subsequent stage, said groups not, however, being<br>
capable of polymerizing by the radical route. In some<br>
cases, a small proportion of vinyl monomer(s), which<br>
can range up to 10%, is capable of reacting with the<br>
reactive organic medium, giving a grafted product which<br>
helps in the dispersing of the polymer.<br>
The dispersion in accordance with the invention is<br>
obtained as soon as the difference between the<br>
solubility parameter of the polymer (δtp) and the<br>
solubility parameter of the dispersing medium (δtm) is sufficient to make possible the formation of a two-<br>
phase system. Generally, the dispersion is obtained<br>
when the following relationship is satisfied:<br>
|δtP - δtm &gt; 4, preferably &gt; 5<br>
The dispersion is prepared according to the process<br><br>
which comprises a stage of mixing at least one vinyl<br>
monomer, the radical initiator and the reactive organic<br>
dispersing medium and a stage of reacting the mixture<br>
at a temperature of at least 20°C and lower than the<br>
boiling point of the compound in the mixture having the<br>
lowest boiling point. The vinyl monomer is chosen from<br>
the monomers of formula<br><br>
in which<br>
• X is a C1-C18 alkyl radical, an aryl radical,<br>
preferably the phenyl radical, which can comprise<br>
one or more C1-C4 alkyl substituents, preferably the<br>
tolyl radical, or a C7-C10 arylalkyl radical,<br>
preferably the benzyl radical, and Y represents a<br>
hydrogen atom or a C1-C4 alkyl radical,<br>
 X is the OR group in which R represents a C1-C18<br>
alkyl radical or a C5-C8 cycloalkyl radical,<br>
or a radical of formula<br><br>
in which<br>
R1 and R2 represent a hydrogen atom, a methyl radical<br>
or an ethyl radical, R1 and R2 being different,<br>
m and n, which are identical or different, are equal<br>
to 1, 2, 3 or 4, preferably 3 or 4,<br>
z and t, which are identical or different, are<br>
greater than 4,<br>
z + t is less than or equal to 80,<br>
and Y represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-C4 alkyl<br>
radical, X is the OCOR1 group in which R1 represents a C1-C12,<br>
preferably C1-C4, alkyl radical, a C5-C8 cycloalkyl<br>
radical, preferably the cyclohexyl radical, or an<br>
aryl radical, preferably the phenyl radical, and Y<br>
represents a hydrogen atom,<br><br>
 X is the COOR2 group in which R2 represents a C4-C20<br>
alkyl radical, a C6-C20, preferably C4-C12, cycloalkyl<br>
radical, an aryl radical, preferably the phenyl<br>
radical, or a C5-C20 arylalkyl radical, preferably<br>
the benzyl radical, and Y represents a hydrogen atom<br>
or a methyl radical,<br>
 X is the group of formula<br><br>
and Y represents a hydrogen atom.<br>
Preferably, the vinyl monomer is chosen from vinyl<br>
acetate, vinyl propionate, butyl acrylate, octyl<br>
acrylate, lauryl acrylate and N-vinylpyrrolidone.<br>
Particularly preferably, the vinyl monomer is vinyl<br>
acetate, butyl acrylate, octyl acrylate or<br>
N-viny1pyrro1idone.<br>
The radical initiator can be any known type of<br>
initiator which makes it possible to initiate the<br>
polymerization reaction by the radical route which can<br>
be activated thermally or by ultraviolet radiation.<br>
Preferably, the initiator can be activated thermally,<br>
that is to say that it can release radicals at the<br>
reaction temperature, preferably at a temperature lower<br>
by at least 10°C than the boiling point of the compound<br>
in the mixture having the lowest boiling point.<br>
Generally, it. is necessary for the initiator to be<br>
soluble preferentially in the vinyl monomer(s) to be<br>
polymerized, that is to say for the partition<br>
coefficient between the constituents of the mixture to<br>
be favorable to said monomer(s). Mention may be made,<br><br>
as examples of such initiators, of peroxides, hydro-<br>
peroxides, alone or in combination with a reducing<br>
agent of Fe(II), Co (II) or ascorbic acid type (redox<br>
initiators), and azo compounds. The choice is<br>
preferably made of benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide,<br>
2,2' -azobisisobutyronitrile, 2,2' -azobismethylbutyro-<br>
nitrile and 4,4'-azobis(cyanopentanoic acid), and<br>
advantageously of lauroyl peroxide, 2, 2'-azobisiso-<br>
butyronitrile. and 2,2'-azobismethylbutyronitrile.<br>
The radical initiator is introduced in a proportion of<br>
0.5 to 6% by weight of vinyl monomer, preferably 1 to<br>
4%, advantageously 1 to 3%.<br>
The organic dispersing medium is chosen from the<br>
compounds exhibiting at. least one reactive group below:<br>
silicones comprising at least one epoxy group,<br>
preferably at least two epoxy groups, in terminal<br>
position (s), for example poly(alkylsiloxane)s<br>
comprising glycidyl ending(s). The silicones<br>
exhibiting a molecular weight of between 450 and<br>
4000, preferably between 600 and 3000, are advantageous as they make possible good<br>
dissolution or dispersion of the vinyl monomer<br>
without increasing too significantly the viscosity<br>
of the composition.<br>
Preferably, the silicone corresponds to the<br>
formula<br><br>
in which<br>
n varies from 3 to 45, preferably 10 to 3 0<br>
m varies from 1 to 20<br>
polyols derived from saturated or unsaturated and<br>
linear, branched or cyclic hydrocarbons.<br><br>
Preferably, the polyols exhibit a molecular weight<br>
of less than 5000. Advantageously, the number of<br>
hydroxyl groups in the polyol is at most equal<br>
to 6.<br>
Mention may be made, by way of examples, of diols, such<br>
as ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol,<br>
1,6-hexanediol and cyclohexanedimethanol, of triols,<br>
such as glycerol and 1,2,4-butanetriol, of tetrols,<br>
such as erythritol and pentaerythritol, and of the<br>
mixtures of these compounds.<br>
Advantageously, the dispersing medium is an α,ω-di-<br>
glycidylpolydimethylsiloxane preferably having a<br>
molecular weight of the order of 2000 or ethylene<br>
glycol.<br>
If appropriate, when the viscosity of the dispersing<br>
medium is high, a small proportion of an organic<br>
compound which acts as diluent, namely that it is not<br>
capable of reacting with the vinyl monomer and with the<br>
dispersing medium but can optionally polymerize, can be<br>
added. The diluent is chosen, for example, from ethers<br>
of fatty alcohols including at most 20 carbon atoms,<br>
preferably between 6 and 18 carbon atoms and<br>
advantageously between 8 and 16 carbon atoms, in<br>
particular the monoglycidyl ethers and the diglycidyl<br>
ethers of these fatty alcohols. The diluent is chosen<br>
according to the chemical nature of the dispersing<br>
medium; for example, an alcohol, such as 2-propanol, is<br>
chosen when the dispersing medium is a glycol, such as<br>
ethylene glycol. Generally, the proportion of diluent<br>
does not exceed 30% by weight of the dispersing medium<br>
and preferably remains below 15%.<br>
In the mixture, the vinyl monomer and the dispersing<br>
medium are employed in a ratio by volume which does not<br>
exceed 70:30 in order to avoid phase inversion of the<br>
monomer in the dispersing medium. Preferably, the ratio<br><br>
is between 60:40 and 30:70.<br>
As has already been mentioned, the polymerization<br>
reaction is carried out at a temperature of at least<br>
20°C and lower than the boiling point of the compound<br>
in the mixture having the lowest boiling point. The<br>
reaction conditions, in particular the temperature and<br>
the duration, vary according to the desired degree of<br>
conversion of the vinyl monomer, the final polymer and<br>
the nature and level of initiator. Generally, the<br>
polymerization is carried out at a temperatur of<br>
greater than or equal to 40°C and lower by at least<br>
10 °C than the boiling point of the monomer having the<br>
lowest boiling point, preferably not exceeding 60°C,<br>
for a period of time which varies between 30 minutes<br>
and approximately 10 hours, preferably less than<br>
6 hours. These polymerization conditions make it<br>
possible to obtain a degree of conversion of the vinyl<br>
monomer of greater than 80%, preferably of greater than<br>
8 5%.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment using a redox<br>
initiator as defined above, the reaction temperature<br>
does not exceed 40°C and preferably does not exceed<br>
30°C.<br>
If appropriate, the content of residual vinyl monomer<br>
can be reduced by increasing the duration of the<br>
reaction or by adding an additional amount of radical<br>
initiator at the end of the reaction rather than by<br>
increasing the temperature, which can result in the<br>
evaporation of the residual vinyl monomer.<br>
In the dispersion obtained, the polymer is found<br>
dispersed directly in the reactive organic medium,<br>
which makes it possible to avoid the intermediate stage<br>
of removal of the solvent, as is necessary with the<br>
known dispersions.<br><br>
The polymer is found in the form of fine' substantially<br>
spherical particles with a size of less than 4 0 urn,<br>
preferably of less than or equal to 15 µm and better<br>
still of less than 3 µm, which form a stable dispersion<br>
in the dispersing medium, even for a high polymer<br>
content. These particles also exhibit a narrow size<br>
distribution centered on a mean diameter of between<br>
0.05 and 3 µm.<br>
The combination of the size and of the distribution of<br>
the abovementioned particles contributes to the<br>
production of a stable dispersion including 20 to 70%<br>
by weight of polymer, preferably 30 to 60% and better<br>
still 4 0 to 60%.<br>
The viscosity of the dispersion is generally less than<br>
or equal to 500 000 mPa.s but it can be adapted<br>
according to the application targeted, for example by<br>
adjusting in particular the amount of vinyl monomer in<br>
the starting mixture, the viscosity of the reactive<br>
organic dispersing medium, the molecular weight of the<br>
polymer and the size of the particles.<br>
Thus, the viscosity is generally chosen to be less than<br>
2000 mPa-s, preferably between 5 0 and 10 00 mPa.s, for<br>
the production of a coating, and to be less than<br>
250 mPa.s, preferably of the order of 30 to 150 mPa-s,<br>
for a size .<br>
The dispersion can additionally comprise a stabilizing<br>
agent which helps in a better dispersion of the polymer<br>
particles in the reactive medium and makes it possible<br>
to avoid separation by settling during storage. The<br>
stabilizing agent generally exhibits a structure<br>
comprising at least one part having an affinity with<br>
the polymer particles and at least one part exhibiting<br>
an affinity with the reactive organic medium.<br>
The stabilizing agent can be chosen from:<br><br>
alkylene oxide copolymers, for example copolymers<br>
of ethylene oxide and of propylene oxide, in<br>
particular in the form of diblock or triblock<br>
copolymers. Advantageously, the copolymers are<br>
poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(propylene oxide) diblock<br>
copolymers. These copolymers can be grafted and<br>
the pendent groups can include one or more<br>
carboxyl or sulfo functional groups,<br>
polymers of alkylene oxide and of at least one<br>
other polymerizable monomer, for example styrene<br>
and alkyl, in particular methyl, acrylate or<br>
methacrylate. Use is advantageously made of<br>
poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(methyl methacrylate) and<br>
poly (ethylene oxide)/polystyrene block copolymers,<br>
vinyl alcohol polymers preferably having a<br>
molecular weight of between 3000 and 250 000,.<br>
advantageously between 10 000 and 200 000 and<br>
better still between 25 000 and 150 000. These<br>
polymers are obtained in particular by hydrolysis<br>
of the corresponding poly(vinyl acetate)s, the<br>
degree of hydrolysis generally being less than or<br>
equal to 98%. Poly (vinyl alcohol)s are more<br>
particularly employed when the reactive medium is<br>
based on polyol(s),<br>
silicone polymers, for example poly(alkyl-<br>
siloxane)s, such as polydimethylsiloxanes<br>
comprising acrylic or methacrylic ending (s), and<br>
polydimethylsiloxanes grafted by a poly(alkylene<br>
oxd.de), in particular a poly (ethylene oxide).<br>
The stabilizing agent can be added to the mixture of the<br>
starting reactants in a proportion which can range up to<br>
35% by weight of vinyl monomer, preferably up to 20%.<br>
It has been found, entirely unexpectedly, that the<br>
polymerization of vinyl monomer(s) of vinyl acetate<br>
type in a dispersing medium including epoxy functional<br>
groups, in particular glycidyl functional groups, can<br>
be carried out without the addition of a stabilizing<br><br>
agent for the polymer. It would appear that the vinyl<br>
acetate can react with the epoxy, in particular<br>
glycidyl, functional group or groups of the dispersing<br>
medium under the conditions of the polymerization,<br>
forming a compound which acts as stabilizing agent. The<br>
fact that this compound is formed in situ in the<br>
dispersing medium during the course of the<br>
polymerization is particularly advantageous as it<br>
prevents the need to add an external stabilizing agent.<br>
The polymer dispersion in accordance with the invention<br>
can be satisfactorily stored under normal conditions<br>
for several days, indeed even several months, generally<br>
from 3 to 6 months, at a temperature varying from 20 to<br>
25 °C, with an acceptable level of sedimentation of the<br>
particles.<br>
The dispersion in accordance with the invention<br>
exhibits the following advantages:<br>
it does not comprise water and, consequently, the<br>
• energy-consuming drying stage is avoided,<br>
it does not comprise volatile solvent and the risk<br>
of contaminating emissions harmful to the<br>
environment and to the health of the operators are<br>
greatly reduced,<br>
the content of residual vinyl monomer is very low,<br>
less than 10% of the weight of the dispersion,<br>
preferab1y less than 5%,<br>
the content of polymer in the dispersion is high,<br>
which makes it possible to have low-volume storage<br>
facilities.<br>
The dispersion according to the invention can be used<br>
as has already been indicated for preparing sizing or<br>
coating compositions.<br>
The expression "sizing composition" has the meaning<br>
usually accepted in the field of glass strands: it<br>
denotes a composition capable of being deposited on<br><br>
glass filaments during drawing, before they are<br>
gathered together into one or more base strands. The<br>
sizing composition serves to protect the, glass<br>
filaments from abrasion during the manufacture of the<br>
strand and to improve the impregnation of the strand by<br>
the matrix to be reinforced and the coupling between<br>
the glass and said matrix.<br>
The expression "coating composition" denotes a<br>
composition which can be applied to the glass strand at<br>
various stages of the process after fiberizing, for<br>
example strands originating from wound packages<br>
(rovings), or to an assemblage of such strands, which<br>
may or may not be intertwined, for example a woven<br>
fabric, a knitted fabric, a grid or a material. The<br>
role of the coating is to bind the strands together and<br>
to improve their strength when they are finally used.<br>
Conventionally, these compositions are prepared by<br>
adding specific additives, in particular at least one<br>
compound which can react with the epoxy or hydroxyl<br>
reactive functional groups of the dispersing medium,<br>
such as amino compounds and isocyanates, to the<br>
dispersion. It is also possible to add cycloepoxide<br>
compounds which can react under the effect of<br>
ultraviolet radiation by catalysis of the Lewis acid<br>
type starting from compounds such as triarylsulfonium<br>
hexafluoroantimona te, triarylsulf onium hexafluoro-<br>
phosphate of antimony, triarylsulfonium tetrafluoro-<br>
borate of antimony, diaryliodonium hexafluoroantimonate<br>
and derivatives of ferrocene type.<br>
The sizing composition is applied to filaments formed of glass of any nature, for example E, C, AR (alkali-<br>
resistant) or with a low level of boron (less than 5%).<br>
Preference is given, to glass E and glass with a low<br>
level of boron.<br>
These filaments have a diameter which can vary to a<br><br>
large extent, for example 5 to 24 µm, preferably 9 to<br>
17 pm. The final glass strand generally has a count of<br>
between 10 and 4800 tex, preferably 68 to 2400 tex.<br>
The coating composition is for its part applied to a<br>
glass strand or to an assemblage of such strands, in<br>
particular in the grid or woven fabric form, for<br>
example by spraying or immersion in a bath.<br>
The glass strands coated with the size and the strands<br>
or assemblages of such glass strands treated with the<br>
coating are subjected to a treatment, for example a<br>
heat treatment or a treatment under ultraviolet<br>
radiation, in order to obtain the crosslinking of the<br>
size or of the coating.<br>
The examples which follow make it possible to<br>
illustrate the invention without, however, limiting it.<br><br>

The following measurements are carried out starting<br>
from the dispersion obtained:<br>
the mean size of the polymer particles, expressed<br>
in nanometers, is measured by photon correlation<br>
spectroscopy under an incident beam of laser light<br><br>
and measurement of the light scattered under an<br>
angle of 90° using a Coulter N4 Plus device (for<br>
sizes up to 3000 nm) and an LS 230 device (for<br>
sizes up to 2 x 106 nm) .<br>
the viscosity, in mPa.s, is measured at 25°C using<br>
a rotary viscometer (Rheomat RM 180).<br>
the stability is measured by giving the<br>
sedimentation time under static conditions<br>
corresponding to separation by settling of 25% by<br>
volume of the dispersion (t25, expressed in days).<br>
the degree of conversion of the vinyl monomer(s)<br>
is measured by 1H NMR.<br>
In table 1, it is found that the poly (vinyl acetate)<br>
dispersions are stable without the addition of a<br>
stabilizing agent for at least 30 days (Ex. 6 to 8) and<br>
more than 60 days at a lower content of polymer (Ex. 1<br>
to 5). For the more concentrated dispersions, the<br>
addition of a stabilizing agent is necessary to obtain<br>
a stability of at least 8 days (Ex. 30 to 34) . The<br>
degree of conversion of the vinyl monomer is at least<br>
equal to 90%.<br>
The addition of stabilizing agent to the vinyl-<br>
pyrrolidone and acrylic polymer dispersions makes it<br>
possible to obtain particles which are small in size<br>
(less than 1 µm) and makes it possible to increase the<br>
duration of the storage (Ex. 9 and 1.0; Ex. 23 and 24) .<br>
The solubility parameter of the polymer (δtp) and the<br>
solubility parameter of the dispersing medium (δtm) are<br>
calculated according to the method described by D.W.<br>
Van Krevelen in the work "Properties of polymers";<br>
Elsevier Science Publisher, 1990, pp. 212-213. The<br>
difference |δtP - δtm| for the examples of table 1 is<br>
given below:<br><br>
|δtp - δtm|<br>
Example 1-8 and 3 0-32	6.8<br>
