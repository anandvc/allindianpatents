RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application is related to United States provisional patent application number<br>
60/974,880 filed 25 September 2007, the contents of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference in their entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention pertains to the general field of chemical synthesis, and more<br>
particularly to methods for the synthesis of certain hydroxamic acid compounds, and in<br>
particular, (E)-N-hydroxy-3-(3-phenylsulfamoyl-phenyl)-acrylamide, also known as<br>
PXD101 and Belinostat速.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A number of publications are cited herein in order to more fully describe and disclose the<br>
invention and the state of the art to which the invention pertains. Each of these<br>
references is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety into the present disclosure, to<br>
the same extent as if each individual reference was specifically and individually indicated<br>
to be incorporated by reference.<br>
Throughout this specification, including the claims which follow, unless the context<br>
requires otherwise, the word "comprise," and variations such as "comprises" and<br>
"comprising," will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group<br>
of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers<br>
or steps.<br>
It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular<br>
forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates<br>
otherwise.<br>
Ranges are often expressed herein as from "about" one particular value, and/or to "about"<br>
another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes<br>
from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values<br>
are expressed as approximations, by the use of the antecedent "about," it will be<br>
understood that the particular value forms another embodiment.<br>
This disclosure includes information that may be useful in understanding the present<br>
invention. It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art or<br><br>
relevant to the presently claimed invention, or that any publication specifically or implicitly<br>
referenced is prior art.<br>
PXD101 /Belinostat速<br>
(E)-N-hydroxy-3-(3-phenylsulfamoyl-phenyl)-acrylamide, also known as PXD101 and<br>
Belinostat速, shown below, is a well known histone deacetylate (HDAC) inhibitor. It is<br>
being developed for treatment of a range of disorders mediated by HDAC, including<br>
proliferative conditions (such as cancer and psoriasis), malaria, etc.<br><br>
PXD101 was first described in WO 02/30879 A2. That document describes a multi-step<br>
method of synthesis which may conveniently be illustrated by the following scheme.<br><br><br><br>
There is a need for alternative methods for the synthesis of PXD101 and related<br>
compounds for example, methods which are simpler and/or employ fewer steps and/or<br>
permit higher yields and/or higher purity product.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are provided solely to illustrate the present invention and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the invention, as described herein.<br>
The methods of synthesis of the present invention are exemplified below for a<br>
representative compound, PXD101. The method is illustrated in the following scheme.<br><br>
To a 30 gallon (-136 L) reactor was charged aniline (2) (4.01 kg; 93.13 g/mol; 43 mol),<br>
toluene (25 L), and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) (12 g), and the mixture was<br>
heated to 50-60属C. 3-Bromobenzenesulfonyl chloride (1) (5 kg; 255.52 g/mol; 19.6 mol)<br>
was charged into the reactor over 30 minutes at 50-60属C and progress of the reaction<br>
was monitored by HPLC. After 19 hours, toluene (5 L) was added due to losses<br>
overnight through the vent line and the reaction was deemed to be complete with no<br>
compound (1) being detected by HPLC. The reaction mixture was diluted with toluene<br><br>
(10 L) and then quenched with 2 M aqueous hydrochloric acid (20 L). The organic and<br>
aqueous layers were separated, the aqueous layer was discarded, and the organic layer<br>
was washed with water (20 L), and then 5% (w/w) sodium bicarbonate solution (20 L),<br>
while maintaining the batch temperature at 45-55属C. The batch was then used in the next<br>
synthesis.<br>
Synthesis 2<br>
(E)-3-(3-Phenylsulfamoyl-phenyl)-acrvlic acid ethyl ester (5)<br><br>
To the batch containing 3-bromo-N-phenyl-benzenesulfonamide (3) (the treated organic<br>
layer obtained in the previous synthesis) was added triethylamine (2.97 kg; 101.19 g/mol;<br>
29.4 mol), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (119 g; 304.37 g/mol; 0.4 mol), and palladium (II) acetate<br>
(44 g; 224.51 g/mol; 0.2 mol), and the resulting mixture was degassed four times with a<br>
vacuum/nitrogen purge at 45-55属C. Catalytic palladium (0) was formed in situ. The batch<br>
was then heated to 80-90属C and ethyl acrylate (4) (2.16 kg; 100.12 g/mol; 21.6 mol) was<br>
slowly added over 2.75 hours. The batch was sampled after a further 2 hours and was<br>
deemed to be complete with no compound (3) being detected by HPLC. The batch was<br>
cooled to 45-55属C and for convenience was left at this temperature overnight.<br>
The batch was then reduced in volume under vacuum to 20-25 L, at a batch temperature<br>
of 45-55属C, and ethyl acetate (20 L) was added. The batch was filtered and the residue<br>
washed with ethyl acetate (3.5 L). The residue was discarded and the filtrates were sent<br>
to a 100 gallon (~454 L) reactor, which had been pre-heated to 60属C. The 30 gallon<br>
(~136 L) reactor was then cleaned to remove any residual Pd, while the batch in the<br>
100 gallon (~454 L) reactor was washed with 2 M aqueous hydrochloric acid and water at<br>
45-55属C. Once the washes were complete and the 30 gallon (~136 L) reactor was clean,<br>
the batch was transferred from the 100 gallon (~454 L) reactor back to the 30 gallon<br>
(-136 L) reactor and the solvent was swapped under vacuum from ethyl acetate/toluene<br>
to toluene while maintaining a batch temperature of 45-55属C (the volume was reduced to<br>
20-25 L). At this point, the batch had precipitated and heptanes (10 L) were added to<br>
re-dissolve it. The batch was then cooled to 0-10属C and held at this temperature over the<br>
weekend in order to precipitate the product. The batch was filtered and the residue was<br>
washed with heptanes (5 L). A sample of the wet-cake was taken for Pd analysis. The<br>
Pd content of the crude product (5) was determined to be 12.9 ppm.<br>
The wet-cake was then charged back into the 30 gallon (~136 L) reactor along with ethyl<br>
acetate (50 L) and heated to 40-50属C in order to obtain a solution. A sparkler filter loaded<br>
with 12 impregnated Darco G60速 carbon pads was then connected to the reactor and the<br><br>
solution was pumped around in a loop through the sparkler filter. After 1 hour, a sample<br>
was taken and evaporated to dryness and analysed for Pd content. The amount of Pd<br>
was found to be 1.4 ppm. A second sample was taken after 2 hours and evaporated to<br>
dryness and analysed for Pd content. The amount of Pd had been reduced to 0.6 ppm.<br>
The batch was blown back into the reactor and held at 40-50属C overnight before the<br>
solvent was swapped under vacuum from ethyl acetate to toluene while maintaining a<br>
batch temperature of 45-55属C (the volume was reduced to 20-25 L). At this point, the<br>
batch had precipitated and heptanes (10 L) were added to re-dissolve it and the batch<br>
was cooled to 0-10属C and held at this temperature overnight in order to precipitate the<br>
product. The batch was filtered and the residue was washed with heptanes (5 L). The<br>
filtrate was discarded and the residue was dried at 45-55属C under vacuum for 25 hours.<br>
A first lot of the title compound (5) was obtained as an off-white solid (4.48 kg, 69%<br>
overall yield from 3-bromobenzenesulfonyl chloride (1)) with a Pd content of 0.4 ppm and<br>
a purity of 99.22% (AUC) by HPLC.<br>
Synthesis 3<br>
(E)-3-(3-Phenylsulfamoyl-phenyl)-acrylic acid (6)<br><br>
To the 30 gallon (~136 L) reactor was charged the (E)-3-(3-phenylsulfamoyl-phenyl)-<br>
acrylic acid ethyl ester (5) (4.48 kg; 331.39 g/mol; 13.5 mol) along with 2 M aqueous<br>
sodium hydroxide (17.76 L; ~35 mol). The mixture was heated to 40-50属C and held at<br>
this temperature for 2 hours before sampling, at which point the reaction was deemed to<br>
be complete with no compound (5) being detected by HPLC. The batch was adjusted to<br>
pH 2.2 using 1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid while maintaining the batch temperature<br>
between 40-50属C. The product had precipitated and the batch was cooled to 20-30属C<br>
and held at this temperature for 1 hour before filtering and washing the cake with water<br>
(8.9 L). The filtrate was discarded. The batch was allowed to condition on the filter<br>
overnight before being charged back into the reactor and slurried in water (44.4 L) at<br>
40-50属C for 2 hours. The batch was cooled to 15-20属C, held for 1 hour, and then filtered<br>
and the residue washed with water (8.9 L). The filtrate was discarded. The crude title<br>
compound (6) was transferred to an oven for drying at 45-55属C under vacuum with a<br>
slight nitrogen bleed for 5 days (this was done for convenience) to give a white solid<br>
(3.93 kg, 97% yield). The moisture content of the crude material was measured using<br>
Karl Fischer (KF) titration and found to be 
was charged the crude compound (6) along with acetonitrile (47.2 L). The batch was<br>
heated to reflux (about 80属C) and held at reflux for 2 hours before cooling to 0-10属C and<br>
holding at this temperature overnight in order to precipitate the product. The batch was<br>
filtered and the residue was washed with cold acetonitrile (7.9 L). The filtrate was<br><br>
discarded and the residue was dried under vacuum at 45-55属C for 21.5 hours. The title<br>
compound (6) was obtained as a fluffy white solid (3.37 kg, 84% yield with respect to<br>
compound (5)) with a purity of 99.89% (AUC) by HPLC.<br>
Synthesis 4<br>
(E)-N-Hydroxy-3-(3-phenylsulfamoyl-phenyl)-acrylamide (PXD101)<br><br>
To the 30 gallon (~136 L) reactor was charged (E)-3-(3-phenylsulfamoyl-phenyl)-acrylic<br>
acid (6) (3.37 kg; 303.34 g/mol; 11.1 mol) and a pre-mixed solution of<br>
1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) in isopropyl acetate (IPAc) (27 g in 30 L;<br>
152.24 g/mol; 0.18 mol). The slurry was stirred and thionyl chloride (SOCI2) (960 mL;<br>
density ~1.631 g/mL; 118.97 g/mol; ~13 mol) was added to the reaction mixture and the<br>
batch was stirred at 20-30属C overnight. After 18.5 hours, the batch was sampled and<br>
deemed to be complete with no compound (6) being detected by HPLC. The resulting<br>
solution was transferred to a 100 L Schott reactor for temporary storage while the<br>
30 gallon (~136 L) reactor was rinsed with isopropyl acetate (IPAc) and water. Deionized<br>
water (28.9 L) was then added to the 30 gallon (~136 L) reactor followed by 50% (w/w)<br>
hydroxylamine (6.57 L; ~1.078 g/mL; 33.03 g/mol; ~214 mol) and another charge of<br>
deionized water (1.66 L) to rinse the lines free of hydroxylamine to make a 10% (w/w)<br>
hydroxylamine solution. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) (6.64 L) was then charged to the<br>
30 gallon (~136 L) reactor and the mixture was stirred and cooled to 0-10属C. The acid<br>
chloride solution (from the 100 L Schott reactor) was then slowly charged into the<br>
hydroxylamine solution over 1 hour maintaining a batch temperature of 0-10属C during the<br>
addition. The batch was then allowed to warm to 20-30属C. The aqueous layer was<br>
separated and discarded. The organic layer was then reduced in volume under vacuum<br>
while maintaining a batch temperature of less than 30属C. The intention was to distill out<br>
10-13 L of solvent, but this level was overshot. A larger volume of isopropyl acetate<br>
(IPAc) (16.6 L) was added and about 6 L of solvent was distilled out. The batch had<br>
precipitated and heptanes (24.9 L) were added and the batch was held at 20-30属C<br>
overnight. The batch was filtered and the residue was washed with heptanes (6.64 L).<br>
The filtrate was discarded and the residue was dried at 45-55属C under vacuum with a<br>
slight nitrogen bleed over the weekend. The title compound (PXD101) was obtained as a<br>
light orange solid (3.11 kg, 89% yield with respect to compound (6)) with a purity of<br>
99.25% (AUC) by HPLC.<br>
The title compound (PXD101) (1.2 kg, 3.77 mol) was dissolved in 8 volumes of 1:1<br>
(EtOH/water) at 60属C. Sodium bicarbonate (15.8 g, 5 mol%) was added to the solution.<br>
Water (HPLC grade) was then added at a rate of 65 mL/min while keeping the internal<br><br>
temperature &gt;57属C. After water (6.6 L) had been added, crystals started to form and the<br>
water addition was stopped. The reaction mixture was then cooled at a rate of 10属C/90<br>
min to a temperature of 0-10属C and then stirred at ambient temperature overnight. The<br>
crystals were then filtered and collected. The filter cake was washed by slurrying in water<br>
(2x1.2 L) and then dried in an oven at 45属C for 60 hours with a slight nitrogen bleed.<br>
1.048 kg (87% recovery) of a light orange solid was recovered. Microscopy and XRPD<br>
data showed a conglomerate of irregularly shaped birefringant crystalline particles. The<br>
compound was found to contain 0.02% water.<br>
As discussed above:<br>
the yield of compound (5) with respect to compound (1) was 69%.<br>
the yield of compound (6) with respect to compound (5) was 84%.<br>
the yield of PXD101 with respect to compound (6) was 89%.<br>
