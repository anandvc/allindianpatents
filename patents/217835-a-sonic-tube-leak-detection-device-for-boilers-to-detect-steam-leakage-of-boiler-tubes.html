				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to sonic tube leak detection device for boilers to take corrective measures to avoid damages of boilers.<br>
Tube failures are considered as one of the major causes for any boiler outrage. If the leakage of steam from the boiler tube could be detected at an early of operation planned correction measures can be taken up to avoid serious secondary damages.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
The conventional methods of detecting tube failure through steam leaks in boiler are either manually listening to audible leak or increase in make-up water requirements, both of which are operator dependent and hence such methods cannot detect leakage at an early stage for taking required precautions. The present invention intends to detect the steam leakage at its nascent stage itself, electronically through sensing acoustic emission thus increasing plant availability and improvement in performance.<br>
The applicants have developed a new device to avoid the disadvantages of the conventional methods. The present invention related to sonic tube leak detection system (STLD) comprising of the following sub systems;<br>
1.	.	Sonic tube assembly<br>
2.	Ac: ou s tic sen so r<br>
3.	Pre amplifier unit<br>
4.	System p an e1<br>
To locate the steam leakage inside the furnace, STLDs are installed into a number of zones and each zone is monitored by one channel. The system is designed to monitor 12, 18 or 24 zones (being modular in design, higher number of channels can also be accommodated as per customer requirement). In each zone, one sonic tube assembly is installed, which penetrates the boiler casing and terminates at the edge of the boiler water wall tubing. On the other side of the sonic tube assembly, an acoustic; sensor is mounted. Sound signal reaching the acoustic sensor assembly is converted into electrical signal and is amplified in the preamplifier unit, which is kept close to the sonic tube assembly. The preamplifier has specially designed filter to eliminate combustion noise. The filtered signal from the pre amplifier units of each channel is taken to system panel, which contains signal processor modules. The signal is processed further using solid-state circuitry to obtain the steam leak information in decibels (dB&gt;, A PC software acquires the output of the processed signal and produces output in various display formats like Bargrapb, Mimic, Group trend and History in the PC.<br><br>
The system has  provision to variably set threshold values of sound<br>
levels  (in dB) and to activate alarm if sound	level exceeds  the<br>
threshold  value  in any channel. Additionally	current   outputs<br>
representing  the  detected  sound levels from	each  channel  is<br>
provided, to be  useful for- the customer.<br>
PRIOR ART DISCUSSION<br>
Prior art search was conducted for leak detection systems and it is found that they have been generally disclosed i n t h e f o 11 o w i n g p ate n t s .<br>
US Patents 4998439 discloses the design of Acoustic wave guide shape with up to 90 bend along with tubular axis, whereas, the invented wave-guide design as described herein below<br>
is different from the above patent design is 1.2 meter long steel<br>
tube  with ball valve and 45  elbows at one end. The end  of  the<br>
elbow  is mounted with a heat insulated coupling to  reduce  heat transfer to acoustic sensor.<br>
US Patent: 5623421 reveals a method for monitoring pressurized vessels, where the transducers are physically attached to the vessel and transmit the vibratory acoustic signals, which are processed to extract the frequency spectra of the signals.<br>
In the invented new design, the method of detection is different since it is based on acoustic signals transmitted through air/gas medium and the sonic sensor is mounted away from the boiler waterwall steam pipes.<br>
In US Patent: 5,101774 acoustic leak detection has  been<br><br>
dislosed. Acoustic signals are passed to a sequential multiplex switching unit and the output of the multiplexer is further processed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques.<br>
The  present  invention  includes a  method  of  signal<br>
processing which is different from the above patent. The acoustic signal is processed by analog circuits for each channel separately and displayed in the color monitor. Failure of one channel will not affect the performance of other channels.<br>
US Patent: 535,16515 discloses acoustic emission signal. The signal travels along the surface of the tube and then along the surface of the attached waveguide into the cross member where it is detected by the acoustic emission sensor which is connected to signal processing controls.<br>
In the new method the construction of sonic tube is different with 45 degree elbow and also further sensing and processing are different from the above prior art patents.<br><br>
The  signals are digitalized in a rapid  time  sequence<br>
such  digital values are  temporarily stored in dsta memory  bank<br><br>
and displayed are known and disclosed in  US Patent: 4960079.<br>
In the design disclosed herein, the signals are processed by analog circuits and the values are displayed in a microprocessor based data scanner und also in a PC monitor.<br>
US Patents 4502322 describes an apparatus for detecting leaks in steam raising boilers.<br>
In the above referred patent the listening tube is 1 meter in length. The free end of the tube is formed with an elbow, the elbow is made of a plastic material. The sensor is mounted on the listening tube, it receives the acoustic signal and processed by analog circuits and the output is displayed in the LED Bargraph.<br>
The invented design is different and is provided  with  the<br>
free end of the sonic tube elbow is of steel material, with heat insulated coupling. The sonic sensor is located on the heat insulated coupling. The acoustic Bignal is sensed by the sonic sensor and the signal is processed and displayed in the microprocessor dB scanner and also displayed in the PC monitor using s o f t w are.<br>
Prior US Patents 43.27f.76 relates to acoustic leak d e t e c t o r.<br>
In this application for patent, the device processes the acoustic signals from the source of the leak and indicates the leak in the edgewise indicator.<br>
One of the objects of the present invention is to mitigate the drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a new sonic tube leak detection system in boiler in detecting the sound generated steam leakage.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a sonic tube leak detection system so as to avoid secondary damage for boilers,<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to minimize tube failure causing boiler outrage.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to detect the leakage of steam from boiler tube at an early stage of operation so that correct measure can be taken up to avoid serious damages in the boiler.<br>
To avoid all the disadvantages of the prior art in detection of the leakage in the boiler manually and to provide an effective sonic tube leakage detection, the scope of the present invention will be clear from the following description.<br>
In the present device, the steam leakage signals are processed by the analog circuits and are further scanned by the microprocessor based dB scanner. The leak dB values are indicated in this scanner itself. The output of this scanner is linked to a PC to indicate leak information in Bargraph, Mimic, History, Trend and Group trend formats<br>
