				<td>Title: Electric switchboard with plug-in type circuit control members.;<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates primarily to the low tension electric switchboards<br>
generally required for domestic and low power electric consumption as in<br>
dwelling units, pump houses, small manufacturing units etc.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART:-<br>
Low tension electric switchboards serve the purpose of accommodating a<br>
plurality of circuit control members like switches, regulators (for fans),<br>
multipin plug outlets, fuses, indication lamps (to show on / off status) with a<br>
compact structure. They are usually wall mounted and have connection<br>
wires connected to each such circuit control member.<br>
The far ends of these wires except in the case of fuses and indication lamps<br>
are connected to the electrical equipment to be operated or controlled, like<br>
light, fan, pump etc. Usually one switchboard is required for one unit or<br>
segment of the electrical consumption entity, like a residential flat, a room, a<br>
portion of a room, a floor or a particular utility unit like a pump, cooling<br>
unit, water purification plant etc.<br>
These switchboards find abundant use in practically all walks of life,<br>
wherever low voltage electric power consumption is involved. A<br>
switchboard is a very vital piece of equipment which enables the user to<br>
operate, regulate, control and monitor power consuming equipment from one<br><br>
location convenient to the user, although the operated / controlled entities may<br>
be located in a distributed fashion over a wide area.<br>
Switchboards are very common and are one of the most visible circuit<br>
elements. There are many types of low tension switchboards that are presently<br>
available. Although such switchboards have existed since the time electricity<br>
became a household commodity, all of them suffer from the undermentioned<br>
drawbacks, which the present invention seeks to ameliorate.<br>
a)	All such switchboards need to be wired individually, depending upon<br>
the users needs before installation.<br>
b)	The circuit control members on the switchboard, like switch, fuse, plug<br>
point, regulator etc. cannot be installed in or taken out from the<br>
switchboard without the switchboard being disconnected from the<br>
electric supply for safety reasons. As a result, operation of all the<br>
equipment powered from the particular switchboard is temporarily<br>
suspended during the period of work undertaken on a particular member<br>
of the switchboard.<br>
c)	Any of the above mentioned procedures calls for personnel specially<br>
skilled in the art (electricians) whose convenience and availability at<br>
times pose delay in execution.<br>
d)	Any such work consumes time, the duration again largely dependent on<br>
the skills of the electrician and<br><br>
e) Switchboards as per prior art do not offer any facility to change its<br>
original look, the facade or the visible portion of a switchboard<br>
remaining the original installed piece during its entire lifetime.<br>
The present invention addresses the above lacunae in the prior art.<br>
DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTS OF THE INVEENTION:<br>
The present invention provides a novel low tension switchboard which has the<br>
following unique features :<br>
i) All the circuit control members like switch, regulator, multipoint<br>
outlet, MCB etc. that are to be incorporated on the switchboard are<br>
of plug-in, plug-out type so that at any point of time it is possible to<br>
either install or replace or blank out any circuit member simply by<br>
withdrawing and replacing the same from the switchboard,<br>
ii) This is possible because the switchboard as per invention comes<br>
with its internal connection pre-wired during its manufacture in<br>
accordance with the feature of the respective circuit control member.<br>
The above two features (i) and (ii) greatly reduce the dependence on the<br>
availability of an electrician.<br>
Feature (i) reduces the time required for installation of the switchboard, which<br>
results in considerable monetary savings when large number of switchboards<br>
are to be installed, in a multi-storeyed apartment house for example, where<br>
each apartment has numerous rooms or other electrical units needing a<br>
switchboard each.<br><br>
Feature (ii) enables any user, whether familiar with the art or not, to undertake<br>
addition / alteration work by himself on the switchboard as per invention.<br>
Further, the interconnection being pre-wired at the manufacturers end it is<br>
standardized as per IE rules.<br>
(iii) The switchboard facia as per invention has standardized openings for the<br>
switchboard members which are all plug-in type.<br>
These facia can be of various colours, which enables the user to simply<br>
replace only the facia of the switchboard to impart to the switchboard the<br>
desired colour according to the interior decor of the room, for example,<br>
(iv) The plug-in circuit members also allow the user to replace or take out any<br>
member without disconnection of the main power to the switchboard. In other<br>
words, the rest of the electrical equipment connected to the switchboard can<br>
continue to operate even as one member of the particular switchboard is being<br>
worked upon.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION ;<br>
The invention relates to an electric switchboard with plug-in type circuit<br>
control members.<br><br>
The plug-in type switchboard of the present invention can be applied to both<br>
surface type and concealed type of wiring. The following description<br>
however, is mainly based on a plug-in type switchboard for a surface type<br>
wiring.<br>
In the present invention, a plurality of circuit control members like switches,<br>
regulators, multi-point outlets, MCBs etc. can be press fitted onto recesses<br>
provided in the front face of a base box for achieving plug-in features of the<br>
present invention such that these can be plugged in, taken out for replacement<br>
or blanking out. The female pins and terminals can be internally pre-wired in<br>
the base box of the switchboard and connected at the manufacturers end<br>
according to the features of the respective circuit control member. Male pins<br>
of the circuit control members when press fitted onto the base box make firm<br>
contacts with the respective female pins of the base box.<br>
Thus the present invention provides a plug-in type electric switchboard<br>
comprising a base box with a front face having a facia fitted thereto,<br>
characterized in that said front face of said base box is provided with a<br>
plurality of recesses for receiving a plurality of plug-in-type circuit control<br>
members with male pins to be placed in firm contact with respective female<br>
pins provided in the base box and in that said female pins and input/output<br>
terminals are internally pre-wired and connected according to the features of<br>
the respective control circuit members.<br><br>
