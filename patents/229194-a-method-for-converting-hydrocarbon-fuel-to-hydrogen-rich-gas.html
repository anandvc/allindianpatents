INTEGRATED FUEL PROCESSOR, FUEL CELL STACK AND TAIL GAS OXIDIZER<br>
WITH CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL<br>
Priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/284,684, filed April 18, 2001 is claimedunder35U.S.C.§119.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fuel cells provide electricity from chemical oxidation-reduction reactions and possess significant advantages over other forms of power generation in terms of cleanliness and efficiency. Typically, fuel cells employ hydrogen as the fuel and oxygen as the oxidizing agent. The power generation is generally proportional to the consumption rate of the reactants.<br>
A significant disadvantage which inhibits the wider use of fuel cells is the lack of a widespread hydrogen infrastructure. Hydrogen has a relatively low volumetric efficiency and is more difficult to store and transport than the hydrocarbon fuels currently used in most power generation systems. One way to overcome this difficulty is the use of reformers to convert the hydrocarbons to a hydrogen-rich gas stream that can be used as a feed for fuel cells.<br>
Fuel reforming processes, such as steam reforming, partial oxidation, and autothermal reforming, can be used to convert hydrocarbon fuels such as natural gas, LPG, gasoline, and diesel, into a hydrogen rich gas. In addition to the desired product hydrogen, undesirable byproduct compounds such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are found in the product gas. For many uses, such as fuel for proton exchange membrane (PEM) or alkaline fuel cells, these contaminants reduce the value of the product gas.<br>
In a conventional steam reforming process, a hydrocarbon feed, such as methane, natural gas, propane, gasoline, naphtha, or diesel, is vaporized, mixed with steam, and passed over a steam reforming catalyst. The majority of the feed hydrocarbon is converted to a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The reforming product gas is typically fed to a water-gas shift bed in which much of the carbon monoxide is reacted with steam to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen. After the shift step, additional purification steps are needed to bring the hydrogen purity to the desired level. These steps include, but are not limited to, selective oxidation to remove remaining carbon monoxide, flow through a hydrogen permeable membrane, and pressure swing absorption.<br><br>
between 35% and 99.999% with very low (
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure is generally directed to a method for converting hydrocarbon fuel<br>
to hydrogen rich gas.   In one such illustrative embodiment, the method includes: reacting the<br>
hydrocarbon fuel with steam in the presence of reforming catalyst and a carbon dioxide fixing<br>
material to produce a first hydrogen gas; and removing carbon monoxide from the first hydrogen<br>
gas to produce the hydrogen rich gas.    The carbon monoxide removing step utilizes either<br>
methanation or selective oxidation. The carbon dioxide fixing material is preferably selected so<br>
as to substantially reduce the content of the carbon dioxide present in the hydrogen containing<br>
gas. Illustrative materials include calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, strontium oxide, strontium<br>
hydroxide,  or minerals  such as  allanite,  andralite,  ankerite,  anorthite,  aragoniter, calcite,<br>
dolomite, clinozoisite, huntite, hydrotalcite, lawsonite, meionite, strontianite,vaterite-jutnohorite,<br>
minrecordite.  benstonite, olekminskite,  nyerereite,  natrofairchildite,  farichildite,  zemkorite,<br>
butschlite,    shrtite,    remondite,    petersenite,    calcioburbankite,    burbankite.    kharmeshite,<br>
carboncemaite, brinkite, pryrauite, and strontio dressenite   and other such materials or any<br>
combinations of these.   The reforming catalyst may be any suitable hydrocarbon reforming<br>
catalyst, but preferably, the reforming catalyst metal component is selected fi-om nickel,<br>
platinum, rhodium, palladium, ruthenium, or any effective combination of these. One of skill in<br>
the art should know and appreciate that the reforming catalyst metal is preferably supported on a<br>
high surface area, inert support material.  Such supports may be selected from alumina, titania,<br>
zirconia, or similar such materials or combinations of these. The temperature of the reacting step<br>
should be maintained in a range that is sufficient to support the reforming reaction and to achieve<br>
the desired outcome of producing a hydrogen rich gas.    In one preferred and illustrative<br>
embodiment, the temperature of the reacting step is maintained in a range from about 400°C to<br>
about 800°C, more preferably a temperature range of about 450°C to about 700°C is used and<br><br>
especially preferred is a temperature for the reacting step from about 500X to about 650°C. The illustrative method is carried out such that the hydrogen rich gas is suitable for use in a fuel cell and more preferably has a carbon monoxide concentration less than about 10 wppm.<br>
The present disclosure also encompasses a method for operating a fuel cell. Such an illustrative and preferred method includes: reacting a hydrocarbon fuel with stream in the presence of reforming catalyst and carbon dioxide fixing material to produce a first hydrogen gas; and removing carbon monoxide from the first hydrogen gas to produce a hydrogen rich gas. The removing of carbon monoxide step preferably utilizes a process for substantially decreasing the content of the carbon monoxide present in the hydrogen containing gas such as methanation or selective oxidation. Once generated, the hydrogen rich gas is fed to the anode of the fuel cell, in which the fuel cell consumes a portion of the hydrogen rich gas and produces electricity, an anode tail gas, and a cathode tail gas. The illustrative method may further include feeding the anode tail gas and the cathode tail gas to an anode tail gas oxidizer to produce an exhaust gas. As an alternative the cathode tail gas may be substituted by another oxygen gas source and combined with the anode tail gas and combusted to achieve substantially the same results. The exhaust gas so generated may subsequently be used to regenerate the carbon dioxide fixing material.<br>
Further integration of the process is contemplated such that the method may include preheating process v/ater with the anode tail gas and the cathode tail gas, such that the preheated process water is used to regenerate the carbon dioxide fixing material. The carbon dioxide fixing material may be selected from any suitable material that substantially decreases the content of the carbon dioxide in the hydrogen containing gas. Preferably, the carbon dioxide fixing material is selected from calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, strontium oxide, strontium hydroxide, or similar mineral materials such as allanite, andralite, ankerite, anorthite, aragoniter, calcite, dolomite, clinozoisite, huntite, hydrotalcite, lawsonite, meionite, strontianite, vaterite, jutnohorite, minrecordite, benstonite, olekminskite, nyerereite, natrofairchildite, farichildite, zemkorite, butschlite, shrtite, remondite, petersenite, calcioburbankite, burbankite, khanneshite, carboncemaite, brinkite, pryrauite, strontio dressenite and other such materials or any combination of these. The temperature of the reacting step should be maintained in a range that is sufficient to support the reforming reaction and to achieve the desired outcome of producing a<br><br>
hydrogen rich gas. In one preferred and illustrative embodiment, the temperature of the reacting step is maintained in a range from about 400°C to about SOO^^C, more preferably a temperature range of about 450*'C to about 700°C is used and especially preferred is a temperature for the reacting step from about 500*'C to about 650°C.

Another encompassed method includes a method for operating a fuel cell, including: reacting the hydrocarbon fuel with steam in the presence of reforming catalyst and a material selected from calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, strontium oxide, or strontium hydroxide to produce a first hydrogen gas^ wherein the reaction temperature is from about 500°C to about 650^C; methanating the first hydrogen gas to produce a hydrogen rich gas having a carbon monoxide concentration less than about 10 wppm; feeding the hydrogen rich gas to the anode of the fiiel cell, wherein the fuel cell consumes a portion of the hydrogen rich gas and produces electricity, an anode tail gas, and a cathode tail gas; and preheating process water with the anode tail gas and the cathode tail gas, wherein the preheated process water is used to regenerate the carbon dioxide fixing material.<br>
The present disclosure also encompasses an apparatus for producing electricity fi-om hydrocarbon fuel, that substantially carries out one or more of the methods disclosed herein. In one such illustrative embodiment, the apparatus includes: at least two reforming catalyst beds, in which each reforming catalyst bed is composed of a reforming catalyst and carbon dioxide fixing material; a first manifold that is capable of diverting a feed stream between the at least two<br><br>
reforming catalyst beds; a reactor that is capable of producing a hydrogen rich gas by reducing the carbon monoxide concentration of the effluent of at least one of the reforming catalyst beds; and a second manifold that is capable of diverting the effluent of each reforming catalyst bed effluent between the reactor and exhaust. In one preferable and illustrative embodiment, the reactor is designed such that the level of carbon monoxide in the hydrogen containing gas is selectively and substantially decreased and more preferably is a methanation reactor or a selective oxidation reactor. The illustrative apparatus further includes a fuel cell that produces electricity and converts the hydrogen rich gas to anode tail gas and cathode tail gas.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is generally directed to a method and apparatus for converting hydrocarbon fuel into a hydrogen rich gas. The present invention simplifies the conversion process by incorporating a carbon dioxide fixing material into the initial hydrocarbon conversion process as shown in Figure 1. This fixing material can be any substance capable of reacting with carbon dioxide and retaining carbon dioxide in a temperature range included in the temperatures range typical of hydrocarbon conversion to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Substances capable of fixing carbon dioxide in suitable temperature ranges include, but are not limited to, calcium oxide (CaO), calcium hydroxide (Ca(0H)2), strontium oxide (SrO). and strontium hydroxide (Sr(0H)2). Also suitable are mineral compounds such as allanite, andralite, ankerite, anorthite, aragoniter, calcite, dolomite, clinozoisite, huntite, hydrotalcite, lawsonite, meionite, strontianite, vaterite. jutnohorite, minrecordite, benstonite, olekminskite. nyerereite. natrofairchildite, farichildite, zemkorite, butschlite, shrtite, remondite, petersenite. calcioburbankite, burbankite, kharmeshite, carboncemaite, brinkite, pryrauite, strontio dressenite and similar such compounds. Figure 1 shows the predicted product gas composition (water free basis) from a steam reformer as a function of reaction temperature. The feed for this thermodyTiamic calculation was 1 mole methane and 2 moles water. At temperatures in excess of TOC'C. greater than 90% of the methane has been converted to hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The predicted composition is reasonably close to that seen experimentally when an active reforming catalyst is used. As can be seen from Figure 1, the product gas generally contains greater than 15% carbon monoxide and about 5% carbon dioxide. After a water gas shift step to convert most of the carbon monoxide to hydrogen and carbon dioxide, additional purification steps are necessary before use in a PEM or alkaline fuel cell or with a metal hydride storage system.<br>
Figure 2 shows the predicted product gas composition as a function of the reaction temperature when the same feed gas composition is reacted in the presence of calcium oxide. Calcium hydroxide is also present due to the reaction of water with calcium oxide. As can be seen in Figure 2, at 650°C, the predicted gas composition (water free basis) is greater than 95% hydrogen, less than 1% carbon monoxide, less than 0.1% carbon dioxide, with the balance of the<br><br>
gas as unconverted methane. With a product gas of this composition, no water-gas shift step would be needed. For a PEM fuel cell, only selective oxidation would be needed to make the product gas a highly desirable fuel. For alkaline fuel cells or for a feed to a metal hydride storage system, a methanation step to convert carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide to methane would create a highly desirable feed. In the aforementioned uses, a tail gas with unused hydrogen and methane would be available to provide the energy needed to convert the methane to hydrogen.<br>
Additional thermodynamic predictions show that other feeds, including but not limited to propane, diesel, methanol, and ethanol, would produce improved reformate streams if steam reformed in the presence of calcium oxide. Thermodynamic calculations also predict that strontium and magnesium oxides could be used in place of or in conjunction with calcium oxides.<br>
Figure 3 shows the experimental results using a 0.5% rhodium on alumina reforming catalyst mixed with calcium oxide extrudates. The extrudates were made by combining calcium hydroxide (33% by weight) with a clay (AMOCO No. X-II), extruding, and calcining at 600*^0 in air. .As can be seen in Figure 3. the product reformate contained about 80% hydrogen, 10% unreacted methane, 10% carbon monoxide, and little carbon dioxide. It is believed that the addition of a catalyst capable of improving the reaction rate of water and carbon monoxide will reduce the concentration of carbon monoxide in the product gas.<br>
It is important to note that the catalyst bed is comprised of a mixture of catalyst(s) and carbon dioxide fixing materials. The carbon dioxide fixing material can be a mixture of calcium, strontium- or magnesium salts combined with binding materials such as silicates or clays that prevent the carbon dioxide fixing material from becoming entrained in the gas stream and reduce crystallization that decreases surface area and carbon dioxide absorption. Salts used to make the initial bed can be any salt, such as an oxide or hydroxide, that will convert to the carbonate under process conditions. The catalyst(s) in this system serve multiple functions. One function is to catalyze the reaction of hydrocarbon with steam to give a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. Another function is to catalyze the shift reaction between water and carbon monoxide to form hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Many chemical species can provide<br><br>
these functions, including rhodium, platinum, gold, palladium, rhenium, nickel, iron, cobalt, copper, and other metal based catalysts.<br>
An important factor in this process is the recognition that the improved reformate composition is obtained by the reaction of calcium oxide with carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate. The calculations shown in Figures 2 and 3 also demonstrate that the carbon dioxide fixing material can be regenerated by heating to a higher temperature and allowing the CaC03 or SrCOj to release carbon dioxide and be reconverted to the original carbon dioxide fixing material. Heating of the carbon dioxide fixing material may be accomplished by a number of differing means known to one of skill in the art. In one such illustrative example the heating is accomplished by electrically resistant heating coils. Alternatively, a heat exchanger may be incorporated into the design of the reactor such that steam, exhaust or other heat source such as heat pipes heat the reactor. Another alternative is to heat the carbon dioxide fixing material by flowing gas through the bed under conditions in which the calcium carbonate or strontium carbonate is decomposed and the carbon dioxide is removed. This has been done in our labs using helium, nitrogen, and steam. It could also be done using the anode tail gas of a fuel cell or the tail gas of a metal hydride storage system.<br>
It is envisioned that the system will have two or more reforming beds such that one or more beds are generating reformate while the remaining beds are being regenerated. An integrated system in which tail gas from the fuel cell and'^or hydrogen storage system is used to provide heat needed to reform the feed fuel and regenerate the calcium oxide bed.<br>
Figure 4 shows a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Hydrocarbon fiiel and steam are mixed and flow into manifold or valve 40 that directs the mixture to reforming catalyst bed 41 or 42. Reforming catalyst beds 41 and 42 are comprised of a mixture of reforming catalyst and carbon dioxide fixing materials. The reforming catalysts are typically nickel, platinum, rhodiimi, palladium, and/or ruthenium metals deposited on a high surface area support such as alumina, titania, or zirconia with other materials added as promoters or stabilizers. It is important that the catalyst be stable at the high temperatures needed for regenerating the carbon dioxide fixing material. In Figure 4, the carbon dioxide fixing material is shown as calcium oxide. Upon contacting the active catalyst bed the hydrocarbon feed gas is converted to hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide fixing material removes the<br><br>
carbon dioxide from the stream and shifts the reaction equilibrium toward high hydrocarbon conversion with only small amounts of carbon monoxide being produced. The low level of carbon monoxide production allows the elimination of water-gas shift catalysts currently used in most fuel processors.<br>
The reformate from bed reforming catalyst bed 41 or 42 is cooled by optionally present heat exchangers 49a and 49b and then flows into manifold or valve 43 that directs the reformate to a polishing step 44 that removes carbon monoxide and possibly carbon dioxide. The low levels of carbon monoxide are reduced to trace levels 
Still with reference to Figure 4. the anode tail gas is then combined with the cathode tail gas, and is combusted in anode tail gas oxidizer 46. Exhaust from the anode tail gas oxidizer 46 is then passed through a heat exchanger 47 and to exhaust stack 48. Water is heated in heat exchanger 47 and is used as steam feed for the beginning of the process, and is flowed through manifold or valve 40 to regenerate one of the reforming catalyst beds 41 or 42. Once the carbon dioxide fixing material is regenerated the heated process water is diverted away from the regenerated bed. Heating of the carbon dioxide fixing material may be accomplished by a number of differing means known to one of skill in the art. In one such illustrative example the heating is accomplished by electrically resistant heating coils. Alternatively, a heat exchanger may be incorporated into the design of the reactor such that steam, exhaust or other heat source such as heat pipes heat the reactor. Another alternative is to heat the carbon dioxide fixing material by flowing gas through the bed under conditions in which the calcium carbonate or strontium carbonate is decomposed and the carbon dioxide is removed. This has been done in our labs using helium, nitrogen, and steam. It could also be done using the anode tail gas of a fuel cell or the tail gas of a metal hydride storage system. Once the regenerated bed cools to the<br><br>
desired hydrogen conversion temperature range the catalyst beds can be switched and another bed can be regenerated.<br>
The tail gas from the regeneration flows through manifold or valve 43 and out of the exhaust header. Alternatively, Figure 4 demonstrates that the anode tail gas oxidizer 46 can optionally be left out of the process. In such a scheme, the anode tail gas and the cathode tail gas are directly passed through heat exchanger 47 and to exhaust stack 48.<br>
Figure 5 shows an another preferred embodiment of the present invention. Hydrocarbon fuel and steam are mixed and flowed into manifold or valve 50 that directs the mixture to reforming catalyst bed 51 or 52. Reforming catalyst beds 51 and 52 are comprised of a mixture I of reforming catalyst and carbon dioxide fixing materials. The reforming catalysts are typically nickel, platinum, rhodium, palladium, ruthenium metals deposited on a high surface area support such as alumina, titania, or zirconia with other materials added as promoters or stabilizers. It is important that the catalyst be stable at the high temperatures needed for regenerating the carbon dioxide fixing material. In Figure 5, the carbon dioxide fixing material is shown as calcium oxide. Upon contacting the active catalyst bed the hydrocarbon feed gas is converted to hydrogen and CO:- The carbon dioxide fixing material removes the carbon dioxide from the stream and shifts the reaction equilibrium toward high hydrocarbon conversion with only small amounts of carbon monoxide being produced. The low level of carbon monoxide production allows the elimination of water-gas shift catalysts currently used in most fuel processors.<br>
The reformate from bed reforming catalyst bed 51 or 52 is cooled by optionally present heat exchansers 59a and 59b and then flows into manifold or valve 53 that directs the reformate to a polishing step 54 that removes carbon monoxide and possibly carbon dioxide. The low levels of carbon monoxide are reduced to trace levels 
 <br>
Still with reference to Figure 5, the anode tail gas is then combined with the cathode tail gas, and is combusted in anode tail gas oxidizer 56. Exhaust gas from the anode tail gas oxidizer 56 passes through manifold or valve 57 and manifold or valve 50, and is used to regenerate one of the reforming catalyst beds 51 or 52. Once the carbon dioxide fixing material is regenerated, the exhaust gas is switched to bypass the catalyst beds using manifold 57. Heating of the carbon dioxide fixing material may be accomplished by a number of differing means known to one of skill in the art. In one such illustrative example the heating is accomplished by electrically resistant heating coils. Alternatively, a heat exchanger may be incorporated into the design of the reactor such that steam, exhaust or other heat source such as heat pipes heat the reactor. Another alternative is to heat the carbon dioxide fixing material by flowing gas through the bed under conditions in which the calcium carbonate or strontium carbonate is decomposed and the carbon dioxide is removed. This has been done in our labs using helium, nitrogen, and steam. It could also be done using the anode tail gas of a fuel cell or the tail gas of a metal hydride storage system. Once the regenerated bed cools to the desired hydrogen conversion temperature range the catalyst beds can be switched and another bed can be regenerated. The tail gas from the regeneration flows through manifold or valve 53 and out of the exhaust header. Alternatively, the anode tail gas oxidizer 56 can optionally be left out of the process. In such a scheme, the anode tail gas and the cathode tail gas are directly passed through heat exchanger 47 and to exhaust stack 48.<br>
Although both Figures 4 and 5 show two reforming catalyst reactors, it is intended by the present invention that more than two reforming catalyst beds may be utilized. For example, three reforming catalyst beds can be utilized in the following marmer: one bed in operation, one bed in regeneration, and one bed cooling down from regeneration temperature to process temperature.<br>
A series of tests were conducted in laboratory scale reactors of the type generally disclosed herein. In such tests, 69.6 g of dolomite available commercially as Dolcron 4013 and 9.5 g of a 0.5% rhodium on alumina, commercially available from Johnson Mathey, were loaded into a tube reactor. The reactor was heated to a temperature of 550°C. After flowing nitrogen through the catalyst bed for several hours, methane was introduced into the reactor at a rate of about 5.125 1/h until carbon dioxide was detected in the exiting gas.   The test reactor bed was<br><br>
