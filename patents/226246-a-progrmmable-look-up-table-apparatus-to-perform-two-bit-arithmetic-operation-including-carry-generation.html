				<td>The present invention relates to an improved jrook up table apparatus to perform two bit arithmetic operation including carry generation.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Programmable logic devices are known in which programmable look up tables are used to perform any logic function of upto the number of inputs it has. The outputs of such look up tables can be combined together using similar look up tables to provide more complex functions of wide fanin.<br>
Look up tables which are used for performing elementary logic functions can be used for performing some of the special functions like additions, subtraction, counting etc. But the size of one look up table is quite large for peforming these special functions. For doing one bit full addition two look up tables are to be used, one for computing the sum and one for generating the carry. For example four input look up tables which are of very good size for general use but are larger than necessary for one bit full adder or counters. So it is the wastage of resources of look up table to use it for addition or counting. However the counters and adders are very often used in digital logic. If addition or counting of larger number of bits is required then larger number of look up tables are required (two for each bit of operation) and this results in reduced speed of operation and increased wastage of look up table resources.<br>
The US Patent No 5481486 and US Patent 5274581 describe look up tables for use in programmable logic devices, which are modified to facilitate use of these tables to provide adders (including substractors) and various types of counters. The invention in said US patents divide 4 input look up table (LUT) into two 3 input LUT for implementing the arthimetic functions. These implement only one bit full addition because they are using first 3 input LUT for sum generation<br><br>
bits and other 3 inputs LUT to generate the bits to control the carry logic. So finally they have a 4 input LUT with single output and a carry logic, whereas the instant invention provide 2-bit output with carry out logic using a single 4 input LUT.<br>
Object and summary of the invention:<br>
The object of this invention is to provide the improved ways to implement two bit arithmetic or counters using look up table in the programmable logic devices.<br>
The second object of this invention to use the look up table resources efficiently for implementing the funtions of two inputs or more than two inputs.<br>
Another object of this invention to provide programmable logic devices made up of look up tables in which two bit full addition or counting can be performed without much waste of resources in look up tables and this saves three look up table of four inputs .<br>
Yet another object of Jiis invention to provide ways of improving speed performance of these adders and counters in programmable logic devices made up of lookup tables.<br>
_<br>
To achieve said objectives this invention provides an improved-^LooK Up Table<br>
Apparatus to perform two bit arithmetic operation including carry generation comprising:<br>
a plurality of programmable data storage cells each providing a cell output signal indicative of data stored therein;<br>
means for selecting one of said cell output signals as an output signal and comprising<br>
a plurality of successive selection means each being responsive to a respective one of a plurality of input signals,<br>
a first selection means selecting one of two mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subsets of the cell output signals, and each successive selection means selecting one of two mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subsets of cell output signals selected by a preceding selection means until a last selection means produces the output signal;<br>
the look-up table apparatus being divided into equal first and second halves, excluding said last selection means, where each half comprises half of the remaining selection means, half of said programmable data storage cells, and half of the input signals;<br>
first means for selecting a selection input for a final selection means in each of said first and second halves to be a first input signal from the second half during a normal mode and a carry out signal from a previous bit operation during a two-bit arithmetic mode, said last selection means receiving a second input signal from the second half; and<br>
second means for connecting an output from said final selection means of said first half as a least significant output bit of the two-bit arithmetic operation and for connecting an output of said final stage of said second half as a most significant output bit of the two-bit arithmetic operation during the arithmetic mode, said second means also allowing normal selection operation using one of the input signals during the normal mode.<br>
The said improved look-up table apparatus further includes means for selectively applying at least one input signal of said second half and said first half as the first input signal to said second half.<br>
The said improved look-up table apparatus further comprises additional logic means connected to each half for generating the carry out signal for the corresponding bit operation and a sum output.<br>
The said additional logic means comprises an exclusive OR gate receiving the output from the final selection means of a respective half as a selection signal for selecting at least one of a carry in signal and the second input signal to generate the carry out signal.<br>
The look-up table apparatus further has a counting mode of operation; and further comprising a respective storage element connected to the output of each half for storing the result of a previous arithmetic operation for use as an input to each respective half for performing counting during the counting mode.<br>
The said first means in each half comprises a multiplexer. The said second means comprises a logic gate. The said logic gate comprises an AND gate.<br>
The said first means for each half receives the first input signal from the other half during the normal mode and the carry out signal from the least significant bit operation during the arithmetic mode; and wherein said last selection means comprises a logic gate receiving as inputs a last selection signal from each half<br>
to enable the look-up table to function as at least one of a single look-up table of n inputs or two independent look-up tables of n-1 inputs, each in the normal mode, while retaining the functionality of the arithmetic mode of operation.<br>
The invention also provides an electronic and counting unit comprising the above improved LUT apparatus.<br>

The invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings<br>

FIG 3 shows a schematic block diagram of a complete arithmetic and counting unit using look up table of FIG 2.<br>

FIG 5 shows the schematic block diagram of a complete arithmetic and counting unit using the modified look up table of FIG 4.<br>
Detailed description of the drawings:<br>
FIG 1 shows a conventional four input look up table. Look up table LI has 16 memory elements 12-1 through 12-16 each of which stores one bit of information.Each memory element (ME) may be a flip-flop, a random access memory(DRAM or SRAM) , EPROM, EEPROM, a cell of a first-in first-out (FIFO), a ferroelectric memory cell, a fuse, an antifuse or the like.The contents<br>
of these memory cells can be fixed or they can be programmed once or reneatedly. The four inputs A-D select the output of one of the memory elements to pass to the output of look up table LI. The output of each memory element is applied to one of inputs of respective AND gates<br>
14-1 through 14-16 . Input A is applied to other input of AND gates 14-2,14-4, 14-6, 14-8, 14-10, 14-12 and!4-14, and , after inversion is applied to other inputs of respective AND gates 14-1,14-3,14-5,14-7,14-9,14-11,14-13, and<br>
14-15. Accordingly half of AND gates 14 are enabled by input A and other half is disabled. OR gates 16 pass the outputs of enabled AND gates 14 to next level of AND gates 18.<br>
Input B is applied to one of the inputs of AND gates 18-2,18-4,18-6 and 18-8, and, inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gates 18-1,18-3,18-5 and 18-7. Input B enables half of the AND gates 18 and disables the second half of those AND gates. Input B therefore selects four of the eight memory cells 12 outputs selected by input A. OR gates 20 pass the outputs of enabled AND gates to next level of AND gates 22.<br>
Input C is applied to one of the inputs of AND gates 22-2 and 22-4, and, inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gates 22-1 and 22-3. Input C enables one half of AND gates 22 and disables the second half of those AND gates. Thus input C selects two of four memory cells 12 outputs selected by input B. OR gates 24 pass the outputs of enabled AND gates to next level of AND gates 26.<br>
Input D is applied to one of the inputs of AND gate 26-2, and , inversion is applied to one of inputs of AND gate 26-1. Input D enables one half of the AND gates 26 and disables second half of those AND gates. Thus input D selects one<br>
of the two memory cells 12 outputs selected by input C. OR gate 28 passes the output of enabled AND gate as final output of look up table LI.<br>
•*•<br>
Two look up tables are required for a full adder(Here this term refers to both adder and subtracter). One for sum generation and one for carry generation. With some modifications in the prior art look up table one look up table can be used for implementing two full adders. Accordingly,look up table LI is modified in accordance with this invention as shown in FIG 2 and Fig4 so that it can provide two sum outputs on leads OUTO and OUT1 with OUTO as LSB and OUT1 as MSB and outputs required to generate carry on leads C_L and C_Li corresponding to LSB and C_U and CJJi corresponding to MSB.<br>
LUT apparatus of Figl is modified in FIG 2for 2 bit arthimetic operation including carry generation by splitting D input into D and Di and C input is split into C and Ci. Output of sixteen memory cells 12 are connected to one of the inputs of respective AND gates 14- 1A through 14-16A. Input A is applied to one of inputs of AND gates 14-2A, 14-4A, 14-6A, and 14-8A, and its inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gates 14-1A, 14-3A, 14-5A,and 14-7A. Input Ci is applied to one of inputs of AND gates 14-10A, 14- 12A, 14-14A, and 14-16A and its inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gates 14-9A, 14-11A, 14-13A, and 14-15A. Thus inputs A and Ci enable half of the AND gates 14A and disable the other half of those AND gates. OR gates 16A pass the output of enabled AND gates 14A to the next level of AND gates ISA.<br>
Input B is applied to one of inputs of AND gates 18-2A and 18-4A, and, its inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gates 18-1A and 18-3A. Input Di is applied to one of inputs of AND gates 18-6A, and, its inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gates 18-5A and 18-7A. Inputs B and Di enable half of the AND gates 18A and disable the other half of those AND gates. Thus<br>
inputs B and Di select four of eight memory cells 12 outputs selected by inputs A and Ci. OR gates 20A pass the outputs of enabled AND gates 18A to next level of AND gates 22A and to the outputs C_L , C_Li, C_U, CJJi of look up table L2A.<br>
The output of switch 26-1A which selects one of the inputs Cin or C and is controlled by output of ME 172A is applied to one of inputs of AND gate 22-2A and its inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gate 22-1 A. The output of switch 26-2A which selects one of the inputs CYO or C and is controlled by output of ME 172A is applied to one of inputs of AND gate 22-4A and its inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gate 22-3A. Two of three inputs (either Cin and CYO or C) enable half of the AND gates 22 A and disable the other half of those AND gates. Thus two of four memory cells 12A outputs selected by inputs B and Di are selected by abovementioned two of four inputs. OR gates 24A pass the outputs of enabled AND gates 22A to next level of AND gates 28A. Output of OR gate 24A is passed to the next level AND gates 28A and output of OR gate 24-2A is also passed to the output OUT1 of look up table L2A.<br>
The output of AND gate 30A whose inputs are input D and output of ME 172 A is applied to one of inputs of AND gate 28-2A and its inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gate 28-1 A. The abovementioned output enables half of the AND gates 28A and disables the other half of those AND gates. Thus one of the two memory cells 12 outputs passed by previous level OR gates 24A is selected. OR gate 32A pass the outputs of enabled AND gates 28A to final output OUTO of look up table L2A.<br>
FIG 3 shows how the modified look up table L2A of FIG 2 can be used with other circuitry in accordance with this invention to provide highly flexible and<br>
powerful logic block for use in programmable logic arrays. Programmable logic block (PLB) as shown in FIG 3 has four regular data inputs A_arith - D_arith (these inputs are confgurably connected to A-D inputs respectively of look up table), carry in input CYin which is the carry out output of another PLB, add_sub input which can dynamically set the addition or subtraction mode during binary arithmetic operation or up or down counting mode during binary counter operation.<br>
PLB of FIG 3 has five outputs, four regular data outputs from output drivers and carry out output. The carry out output connects to the carry in input of another PLB, typically adjacent PLB and is used for carrying out addition, subtraction, addition and subtraction , or counting ( up, down, up and down, skip). Skip counting here means that while counting states can be skipped just by giving the value by which it should be skipped(both up and down).<br>
When PLB is used to perform normal logic operation rather than addition, subtraction or counting, switch 11-1 A, which is controlled by output of ME 170A, connects A_arith input of PLB to A input of look up table L2A, switches 11-2A and 11-3A, which are controlled by output of ME 171A and 172A respectively connect A_arith input of PLB to Ci input of look up table, switch 26-1A of look up table L2A passes C_arith input of PLB to its output, switch 26-2 A of look up table L2A also passes C_arith input of PLB to its output and AND gate 30A of look up table L2A passes D_arith input of PLB to its output. Switch 11-4A , which is controlled by output of ME 172A, connects B_arith input of PLB to Di input of look up table.The outputs OUTO and OUT1 of look up table L2A are applied to outputs of PLB OUTO and OUT1 respectively.These outputs OUTO and OUT1 of look up table L2A are also connected to the inputs of flip-flops 19-1A and 19-2A respectively to get registered outputs QO and Ql respectively.<br><br>
In normal mode of operation of PLB two functions of two inputs (these two inputs are A_arith and B_arith ,and, C_arith and D_arith) can also be implemented using same look up table L2A. In this mode all the connections remain the same as in normal mode (explained in last para) except that switch 26- 1A of look up table L2A passes Cin input of look up table L2A to its output and the output of AND gate 30A of look up table L2A is tied to logic low.<br>
hi arithmetic mode of operation one PLB can perform maximum of two places of binary addition or subtraction or addition and subtraction . hi this mode all the connections are same as that in the mode explained in last para. The outputs C_L, C_Li (which in this mode is inversion of C_L) and C_U, C_Ui (inversion of C_U) of look up table L2A are connected to inputs of switches 17-1A and 17-2A respectively which are controlled by output of OR gate 21A . OR gate 21A has add_sub input of PLB and output of ME 175A connected to its inputs. The switches 17A implement XOR functionality in this mode where second input to them is complement of first input. Output of switch 17-1A is connected to control input of switch 15-1A, whose inputs are outputs of gates 13-1A and 13-2A, which is used to generate carry out signal CYO . The output of gate 13-1A is passed to output of switch 15- 1A when its control input is logic low. Gate 13-2A has input CYin, output of ME 174A as its inputs. Gate 13-1A has input B_arith, output of ME 173A as its inputs, hi this mode gate 13-2A can be configured to pass either carry from previous stage or logic low signal and gate 13-1A is configured to pass B_arith signal . Output Cin of gate 13-2A is connected to Cin input of look up table L2A. Output of switch 17-2A is connected to one of the inputs of gate 22A and other input of this gate is connected to output of ME 172A. The output of gate 22A controls switch 15-2A which generates the carryout signal CYout. hi adder and counter modes AND gate 22A passes output of switch 17-2A and in normal mode it passes<br>
logic low value which maps D_arith input from the general routing matrix onto the carry chain. The switch 15-2A has input D_arith and CYO output of switch 15-1A as its inputs and D_arith is selected when its control input is at logic low value. Thus output of switch 15-2A generates signal CYout which is carry output of PLB. For two bit arithmetic operation D_arith and B_arith are taken as augend (for addition or minuend for subtraction and where D_arith is MSB) and C_arith and A_arith are taken as addend or subtrahend (where C_arith is MSB). The sum outputs (where output acts as MSB) are passed directly as outputs of PLB and they can be registered as explained in the normal mode of operation. While performing addition, output of OR gate 21A is tied to logic low value, in subtraction mode this output is tied to logic high and in addition and subtraction mode add_sub input signal is passed through the OR gate 21A whose other input is ME 175A which controls the additions and subtraction functions . Whenever one full addition is required MEs 12-9A through 12- 16A can be configured so as to pass CYO to the output Cyout / OUT1 of look up table L2A.<br>
In counter mode of operation of PLB the configuration is same as that explained in last para with some minor changes. The switch 11-1 passes the output QO of flip-flop 19-1A to its output thus connecting QO to input A of look up table L2A. Similarly switches 11-2A and 11-3A pass the output Ql of flip-flop 19-2A to its output so as to connect Ql to input Ci of look up table L2A. Gate 13-1A can pass either input B or can pull its output high. So if it is first stage of counter then it is pulled high otherwise it passes B to its output. Gate 13-2A passes the carry of previous stage to its output or pulls down its output to logic low value. If it is first stage of counter then it passes a logic low value to its output otherwise it passes the previous carry. The input add_sub can be used as up/down control just the same way it is used for addition/subtraction. For doing subtraction OR gate 21A is configured to pulls its output to logic high value.<br>
'In skip counting mode of operation the configuration is same as that in counter mode with some minor changes, hi this mode we provide difference of the value of next state and the current state as inputs to PLB and this differece is provided at inputs B_arith and D_arith. In this case gate 13-1A always passes input B_arith to its output.<br>
This architecture is very useful for implementing normal functions( 4 I/P functions) and arithmatic functions with less resources.<br>
Since more than one switches are controlled by a single ME (e.g ME 172 controls 6 switches), so by providing independent MEs to different switches , we can get more flexible architecture.<br>
FIG 4 is a further modification of FIG2 by providing XOR gate for upper and lower part selection by splitting A input into A and Ai and C input is split into C and Ci. Output of sixteen memory cells 12 are connected to one of the inputs of respective AND gates 14- IB through 14-16B. Input Ai is applied to one of inputs of AND gates 14-2B, 14-4B, 14-6B, and 14-8B, and its inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gates 14-1B, 14-3B, 14-5B,and 14-7B. Input Ci is applied to one of inputs of AND gates 14-10B, 14- 12B, 14-14B, and 14-16B and its inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gates 14-9B, 14-1 IB, 14-13B, and 14-15B. Thus inputs Ai and Ci enable half of the AND gates 14B and disable the other half of those AND gates. OR gates 16B pass the output of enabled AND gates 14B to the next level of AND gates 18B.<br>
Input B is applied to one of inputs of AND gates 18-2B and 18-4B, and its inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gates 18-1B and 18-3B. Input D is applied to one of inputs of AND gates 18-6B and 18-8B, and, its inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gates 18-5B and 18-7B. Inputs B and C<br>
enable half of the AND gates 18B and disable the other half of those AND gates. Thus inputs B and D select four of eight memory cells 12 outputs selected by inputs Ai and Ci. OR gates 20 pass the outputs of enabled AND gates 18B to next level of AND gates 22B and to the outputs C_L , C_Li, C_U, C_Ui of look up table L2B.<br>
The output of switch 26-1B which selects one of the inputs Cin or C and is controlled by output of ME 172B is applied to one of inputs of AND gate 22-2B and its inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gate 22-1B. The output of switch 26-2 which selects one of the inputs CYO or B and is controlled by output of ME 172B is applied to one of inputs of AND gate 22-4B and its inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gate 22-3B. Two of four inputs (either Cin and CYO or C and B) enable half of the AND gates 22B and disable the other half of those AND gates. Thus two of four memory cells 12 outputs selected by inputs B and C are selected by abovementioned two of four inputs. OR gates 24B pass the outputs of enabled AND gates 22B to next level of AND gates 28B. Output of OR gate 24B is passed to the next level AND gates 28B and output of OR gate 24-2B is also passed to the output OUT1 of look up table L2B<br>
The output of AND gate 32B whose inputs are XOR 30B of inputs A and D , and output of ME 172B is applied to one of inputs of AND gate 28-2B and its inversion is applied to one of the inputs of AND gate 28-1B. The abovementioned output enables half of the AND gates 28B and disables the other half of those AND gates. Thus one of the two memory cells 12 outputs passed by previous level OR gates 24B is selected. OR gate 34B pass the outputs of enabled AND gates 28B to final output OUTO of look up table L2B.<br>

'FIG 5 shows how the modified look up table L2B of FIG 4 can be used with other circuitary in accordance with this invension to provide highly flexible and powerful logic block for use in programmable logic arrays. Programmable logic block (PLB) as shown in FIG 5 has four regular data inputs A_arith - D_arith (These inputs are configurably connected to A-D inputs respectively of look up table), carry in input CYin which is the carry out output of another PLB, add_sub input which can dynamically set the addition or subtraction mode during binary arithmetic operation or up or down counting mode during binary counter operation.<br>
PLB of FIG 5 has five outputs, four regular data outputs from output drivers and carry out output. The carry out output connects to the carry in input of another PLB, typically adjacent PLB and is used for carrying out addition, subtraction, addition and subtraction, or counting (up, down, up and down, skip). Skip counting here means that while counting states can be skipped just by giving the value by which it should be skipped(both up and down).<br>
When PLB is used to perform normal logic operation rather than addition, subtraction or counting, switch 11-1B, which is controlled by output of ME 170B, connects A_arith input of PLB to Ai input of look up table L2B, switch 11-2B, which is controlled by output of ME 171B, connects C_arith input of PLB to Ci input of look up table, switch 26-1B of look up table L2B passes C_arith input of PLB to its output, switch 26-2B of look up table L2B passes B_arith input of PLB to its output and AND gate 32B of look up table L2B passes the XOR of A_arith and D_arith inputs of PLB. The outputs OUTO and OUT1 of look up table L2B are applied to outputs of PLB OUTO and OUT1 respectively.These outputs OUTO and OUT1 of look up table L2B are also connected to the inputs of flip-flops 19-1B and 19-2B respectively to get registered outputs QO and Ql respectively.<br>
In normal mode of operation of PLB two functions of two inputs (these two inputs are A_arith and B_arith ,and, C_arith and D_arith) can also be implemented using same look up table L2B. In this mode all the connections remain the same as in normal mode (explained in last para) except that switch 26- IB of look up table L2B passes Cin input of look up table L2 to its output, switch 26-2B of look up table L2B passes CYO input of look up table L2B to its output and the output of AND gate 32B of look up table L2B is tied to logic low.<br>
In arithmetic mode of operation one PLB can perform maximum of two places of binary addition or subtraction or addition and subtraction . In this mode all the connections are same as that in the mode explained in last para. The outputs C_L , C_Li (which in this mode is inversion of C_L) and C_U, C_Ui (inversion of C_U) of look up table L2B are connected to inputs of switches 17-lB and 17-2B respectively which are controlled by output of OR gate 21B . OR gate 21B has add_sub input of PLB and output of ME 175B connected to its inputs. The switches 17B implement XOR functionality in this mode where second input to them is complement of first input. Output of switch 17-lB is connected to control input of switch 15-1B, whose inputs are outputs of gates 13-1B and 13-2B, which is used to generate carry out signal CYO . The output of gate 13-1B is passed to output of switch 15- IB when its control input is logic low. Gate 13-1B has input B_arith, output of ME 173B as its inputs. Gate 13-2B has input CYin , output of ME 174B as its inputs. In this mode gate 13-2B can be configured to pass either carry from previous stage or logic low signal and gate 13-1B is configured to pass B_arith signal . Output Cin of gate 13-2B is connected to Cin input of look up table L2B. Output of switch 17-2B is connected to one of the inputs of gate 22B and other input of this gate is connected to output of ME 172B. The output of gate 22B controls switch 15- 2B<br>
'which generates the carryout signal CYout. In adder and counter modes AND gate 22B passes output of switch 17-2B and in normal mode it passes logic low value which maps D_arith input from the general routing matrix onto the carry chain. The switch 15-2B has input D_arith and CYO output of switch 15-1B as its inputs and D_arith is selected when its control input is at logic low value. Thus output of switch 15-2B generates signal CYout which is carry output of PLB. For two bit arithmetic operation D_arith and B_arith are taken as augend (for addition or minuend for subtraction and where D_arith is MSB) and C_arith and A_arith are taken as addend or subtrahend (where C_arith is MSB). The sum outputs (where output acts as MSB) are passed directly as outputs of PLB and they can be registered as explained in the normal mode of operation. While performing addition, output of OR gate 21B is tied to logic low value, in subtraction mode this output is tied to logic high and in addition and subtraction mode add_sub input signal is passed through the OR gate 2 IB whose other input is ME 175B which controls the additions and subtraction functions . Whenever one full addition is required MEs 12-9B through 12- 16B can be configured so as to pass Cyout / CYO to the output OUT1 of look up table L2B.<br>
The arithmetic operation comprises addition, subtraction and counting.<br>
hi counter mode of operation of PLB the configuration is same as that explained in last para with some minor changes. The switch 11-1B passes the output QO of flip-flop 19-1B to its output thus connecting QO to input Ai of look up table L2B. Similarly switch 11-2B passes the output Ql of flip-flop 19-2B to its output so as to connect Ql to input Ci of look up table L2B. Gate 13-1B can pass either input B or can pull its output high. So if it is first stage of counter then it is pulled high otherwise it passes B to its output. Gate 13-2B passes the carry of previous stage to its output or pulls down its output to logic low value. If it is first stage of counter then it passes a logic low value to its output<br>
otherwise it passes the previous carry. The input add_sub can be used as up/down control just the same way it is used for addition/subtraction. For doing subtraction OR gate 2IB is configured to pulls its output to logic high value.<br>
In skip counting mode of operation the configuration is same as that in counter mode with some minor changes. In this mode we provide difference of the value of next state and the current state as inputs to PLB and this differece is provided at inputs B_arith and D_arith. In this case gate 13-1B always passes input B_arith to its output.<br>
This architecture is very useful for implementing normal functions( 4 I/P functions) and arithmatic functions with less resources&amp; good speed.<br>
Since more than one switches are controlled by a single ME ( e.g ME 172 controls 4 switches), so by providing independent MEs to different switches, we can get more flexible architecture, e.g if all these 4 switches are controlled by independent ME , then this architecture will be able to implement two functions of three inputs with two common inputs (B &amp; C )<br><br><br><br><br><br>
