				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a nutritional composition for feeding infants, containing fat, protein, carbohydrate, a nucleotide component and to the use thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Breastfeeding optimally supports the development of the infant and protects against infections and allergies. However, not all infants are in the position to receive human milk. It is therefore a continuing aim to provide infant formula, which simulates the functions of human milk. In addition to the desired compositional similarity between infant formula and human milk, it is also particularly desirable to mimic the protective effects of human milk, in particular protection against allergies and infections.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have recognized that the molecular structure and density of charge of nucleotides is an important factor for the bioactivity of nucleotide components, particularly nucleotides. It was found that by combining nucleotide components with negatively charged non-protein components the bioactive effects of the nucleotide component in nutritional formulations may be enhanced significantly.<br>
Hence, the present invention provides a nutritional composition containing a nucleotide component; and a non-proteinaceous negatively charged, glycan or glycoconjugate component with a molecular weight between 200 and 20.000 dalton (hereinafter referred to as NCC).<br>
The present nutritional composition is particularly effective in:<br>
•	Enhancing immune cell proliferation, improving the development of T-lymphocyte<br>
sub populations, and enhancing the antibody response;<br>
•	Stimulating the development of the immune system of neonates<br><br>
•	Stimulating the development of the nerve system of neonates<br>
•	Stimulating the neonatal development and repair of the gastrointestinal tract after surgery or disease<br>
•	Modulating the gutflora, Stimulating the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids<br>
•	Providing anti-infective, antibacterial/viral effects<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, the improved activity is believed to be the result of an improved presentation and delivery of the negatively charged nucleotide component to the epithelial cells, due to interaction of the NCC and the nucleotide component e.g. via hydrogen and salt bridges. The biological active molecular anionic charge of nucleotides is condensed and the molecular distribution of charge is beneficially altered.<br>
The present nutritional composition can be even further improved by combining the nucleotide component and NCC with bivalent cations, preferably calcium and/or zinc. The cation will increase proximity of the nucleotide component and the NCC in a liquid environment (e.g. the intestinal tract) by formation of hydrogen/salt bridges, thereby further increasing the interactive effects between the NCC and the nucleotide components.<br>

Hence, the present composition advantageously comprises zinc, preferably in an amount of 2 to 100 mg zinc per 100 gram dry weight of the present composition, even more preferably between 3 and 25 mg zinc per 100 g dry weight of the present composition. The weight of zinc is calculated as elementary zinc.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the present composition contains calcium for improved charge interaction.

Macronutrients<br>
The present composition can be advantageously used as an infant formula,. The infant formula preferably administered to the infant in liquid form. The term infant includes weaning infants, and toddlers.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the present invention relates to an nutritional composition which provides the macronutrients of the infant diet. Hence, the present composition preferably contains 30 to 60 en% lipid; 5 to 15 en% protein; and 25 to 65 en% carbohydrate. Preferably, the present composition contains 43 to<br><br>
53 en% lipid; 7 to 11 en% protein; and 43 to 53 en% carbohydrate (en% is short for energy percentage and represents the relative amount each constituent contributes to the total caloric value of the preparation). The term "protein" or protein component in this context is the cumulative of protein, polypeptides, peptides and amino acids. The carbohydrate in the present composition is preferably provided largely by lactose, i.e. preferably at least 75 wt.% of total digestible carbohydrate is provided by lactose, preferably at least 90 wt.%.<br>
Essential fatty acids content<br>

The present composition preferably contains at least 1 wt.% alpha linolenic acid (ALA) based on total fatty acids, preferably between 1.5 and 4 wt.% ALA, even more preferably between 2 and 2.5 wt.%. To reduce intestinal stress, the weight ratio LA/ALA is preferably between 2 and 10, preferably between 5 and 7.5. The present composition preferably includes between 0.05 and 5 wt% gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) based on total fatty acids, preferably between 0.1 and 1 wt.%. Preferably the present composition contains between 0.05 and 5 wt% steraidonic acid (STA) preferably more preferably between 0.1 and 1 wt.%.<br>

Preferably the composition contains DHA in an amount exceeding 0.1 wt.% based on total fatty acids; and AA in an amount exceeding 0.1 wt.% based on total fatty acids.<br>
Preferably at least one LCPUFA of this group is included in an amount between 0.15 and 1 wt.% based on total fatty acid content of the composition. Preferably at least two of these LCPUFA's are present in an amount of between 0.15 and 1 wt.%<br><br>
based on total fatty acid content of the composition. Preferably the composition contains AA and DHA, even more preferably AA, DHA and EPA.<br>
The AA content preferably does not exceed 5 wt.%, more preferably does not exceed 1 wt.%, most preferably between 0.1 and 0.6 wt.% of the total fatty acids. In the present composition, EPA and/or DHA are advantageously added to balance the action of AA, e.g. reduce the potential pro-inflammatory action of AA metabolites. Excess metabolites from AA may cause inflammation. Hence, the present composition preferably comprises AA, EPA and/or DHA, wherein the weight ratio AA/DHA preferably is above 0.25, preferably above 0.5, even more preferably above 1. The ratio AA/DHA is preferably below 25, preferably below 10. The weight ratio AA/EPA is preferably between 1 and 100, more preferably between 5 and 20. The weight ratio EPA/DHA is preferably 1 or lower, more preferably below 0.5.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the content of LCPUFA does not exceed 3 wt.% of the total fatty acids as it is desirable to mimic human milk as closely as possible. For the same reason, the present composition preferably contains less than 1 gram omega-3 LCPUFA per 100 gram fatty acids, more preferably between 0.1 and 0.75 gram per 100 gram fatty acids.

The LCPUFAs and the other fatty acids may be provided as free fatty acids, in triglyceride form, in phospholipid form, or as a mixture of one of more of the above. The present composition advantageously comprises at least one of AA and DHA in phospholipid form, as these reduce the incidence of inflammatory disorders of the intestine. The present composition preferably comprises between 0.1 and 5 mg AA from phospholipid per gram total fat and between 0.1 and 5 mg DHA from phospholipid per gram total fat. Preferably the AA and/or DHA are at least partly present in the form of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and/or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), e.g. AA and/or DHA containing PE and/or PC.<br>
30 Oligosaccharides<br><br>
The present composition preferably comprises indigestible oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerisation (DP) of between 2 and 100. The oligosaccharides are believed to be important for providing a suitable intestinal environment for improved presentation and charge density of the combination of nucleotide component and NCC. The indigestible oligosaccharides reduce the pH of the intestinal environment, improving biological activity of the nucleotides. Preferably, the present composition contains 0.1 to 12 grams indigestible oligosaccharides per 100 gram dry weight of the composition, preferably between 3 and 8 grams, more preferably between 5 and 7.5 grams. After reconstitution of the powder in liquid and administration of the liquid formula to the infant, these amounts of indigestible oligosaccharides provide the desired effects without causing intestinal discomfort. Suitable indigestible oligosaccharides are not or only partially digested in the intestine by the action of acids or digestive enzymes present in the human upper digestive tract (small intestine and stomach), but are fermentable by the human intestinal flora. The oligosaccharides are preferably water-soluble (exceeding a solubility of 1 gram oligosaccharide per liter water). The average DP of the present oligosaccharide is preferably below 40, even more preferably below 20. Optimally, the present composition comprises between 2 and 12 grams oligosaccharides with a DP of 2 to 60, more preferably with a DP of 2 to 10 (i.e. the sum of the weights of those oligosaccharides with a DP of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10).<br>
According to a further embodiment at least one of the oligosaccharides of the<br>
present composition is selected from the group consisting of inulin,<br>
fructooligosaccharides, indigestible dextrins, galactooligosaccharides (including<br>
transgalactooligosaccharides), xylooligosaccharides, arabinooligosaccharides,<br>
glucooligosaccharides,	mannooligo-saccharides,	lacto-N-neotetraose,<br>
fucooligosaccharides (containing at least one fucose saccharide unit), acidic oligosaccharides (e.g. uronic acid oligosaccharides such as pectin oligosaccharides) and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, the present composition comprises at least one selected from the group consisting of inulins and fructooligo saccharides and at least one selected from the group	consisting	of	galactooligosaccharides	(including<br><br>
transgalactooligosaccharides) and pectin hydrolysate. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the present composition comprises 2 to 12 grams oligosaccharides with a DP of 2 to 10 and ß-linked galactose and glucose saccharides, more preferably transgalactooligosaccharides (i.e. [gal]n -glu, wherein n is 2 to 10). In a particularly preferred embodiment, the present composition comprises transgalactooligosaccharides (i.e. [gal]n -glu, wherein n is 2 to 10), pectin hydrolysate and at least one selected from the group consisting of fructooligosaccharides and inulin. The present oligosaccharide is preferably derived from animal milk, a mixture of oligosaccharides derived from animal milk or a fucosylated oligosaccharide (oligosaccharide containing at least one fucose saccharide unit).<br>
For further improvement of gut maturation over the whole area of the colon, preferably at least 10 wt.% of the oligosaccharides in the present composition has a DP of 2 to 5 (i.e. 2, 3, 4 and/or 5) and at least 5 wt.% has a DP of 10 to 100. Preferably at least 50 wt.%, more preferably at least 75 wt.% of the oligosaccharides have a DP of 2 to 10 (i.e. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and/or 10), because these are believed to work throughout the ileum and proximal and middle parts of the colon and because the weight percentage of oligosaccharides that needs to be incorporated in the composition to achieve the desired effect is reduced.<br>
Preferably, the weight ratios:<br>
(oligosaccharides with DP 2 to 5) : (oligosaccharides with DP 6 to 9); and<br>
(oligosaccharides with DP 10 to 100) : (oligosaccharides with DP 6 to 9)<br>
are both above 1. Preferably both weight ratios are above 2, even more preferably above 5.<br>
The present composition preferably comprises 0.5 to 10 gram galactooligosaccharide with DP between 2 and 10 per 100 gram dry weight of the composition, more preferably between 1 and 5 gram. The preferred galactooligosaccharides is transgalactooligosaccharide, as this best mimics human milk oligosaccharides. The present invention preferably comprises 0.5 to 10 gram fructopolysaccharide with DP between 10 and 60 per 100 gram dry weight of the composition,    more    preferably    between     1     and     5     gram.     The    term<br><br>
"fructopolysaccharide" refers to a polysaccharide carbohydrate comprising a chain of at least 10 ß-linked fructose units.<br>
Liquid<br>
The present nutritional composition is preferably in powder or liquid form or in tablet form, wherein said tablet has a weight between 5 and 25 grams. Preferably, the present composition is provided in powered form as this increases shelf life. The present composition is preferably administered orally in liquid form. Prior to the administration of the present composition, it is preferably admixed with a liquid, preferably water.<br>
Stool irregularities (e.g. hard stools, insufficient stool volume, diarrhea) is a major problem in many babies and ill subjects that receive liquid foods. It was found that stool problems may be reduced by administering the present composition in liquid form, having an osmolality between 50. and 500 mOsm/kg, more preferably between 100 and 400 mOsm/kg, most preferably between 220 and 300 mOsm/kg.<br>
In view of the above diarrhea problem, it is also important that the liquid food does not have an excessive caloric density as this causes significant intestinal stress. However, the formula needs to provide sufficient calories to feed the infant. Hence, the liquid food preferably has a caloric density between 0.5 and 0.9 kcal/ml, preferably between 0.6 and 0.8 kcal/ml.<br>
Application<br>
The present composition is advantageously administered to infants with the age between 0 and 2 years. The present composition can also be advantageously used in a method for providing the nutritional requirements of a premature infant (an infant born before 37 weeks gestation).
