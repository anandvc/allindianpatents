The chemically-treated solid oxide typically comprises the contact product of at least one solid oxide compound and at least one electron-withdrawing anion source. In one aspect, the solid oxide compound comprises an inorganic oxide. It is not required that the solid oxide compound be calcined prior to contacting the electron-withdrawing anion source. The contact product may be calcined either during or after the solid oxide compound is contacted with the electron-withdrawing anion source. In this aspect, the solid oxide compound may be calcined or uncalcined. In another aspect, the activator-support may comprise the contact product of at least one calcined solid oxide compound and at least one electron-withdrawing anion source.<br>
The chemically-treated solid oxide, also termed the activator-support, exnibits enhanced acidity as compared to the corresponding untreated solid oxide compound, The chemically-treated solid oxide also functions as a catalyst activator as compared to the corresponding untreated solid oxide. While the chemically-treated solid oxide activates the metallocene in the absence of cocatalysts, it is not necessary to eliminate cocatalysts from the catalyst composition. The activation function of the activator-support is evident in the enhanced activity of catalyst composition as a whole, as compared to a catalyst composition containing the corresponding untreated solid oxide. However, it is believed that the chemically-treated solid oxide can function as an activator, even in the absence of an organoaluminum compound, aluminoxanes, organoboron compounds, or ionizing ionic compounds. In other words, polymerization can be performed in the absence or substantial absence of such organoaluminum compounds, aluminoxanes, organoboron compounds, or ionizing ionic compounds.<br>
In one aspect, the chemically-treated solid oxide of this invention comprises a solid inorganic oxide material, a mixed oxide material, or a combination of inorganic oxide materials, that is chemically-treated with an electron-withdrawing component, and optionally treated with a metal. Thus, the solid oxide of this invention encompasses oxide materials such as alumina, "mixed oxide" compounds thereof such as silica-alumina , and combinations and mixtures thereof. The mixed oxide compounds such as silica-alumina can be single or multiple chemical phases with more than one metal combined with oxygen to form a solid oxide compound, and are encompassed by this invention.<br>
In one aspect of this invention, the chemically-treated solid oxide further comprises a metal or metal ion comprising zinc, nickel, vanadium, titanium, silver, copper, gallium, tin, tungsten, molybdenum, or any combination thereof.

In another aspect, the chemically-treated solid oxide of this invention comprises a solid oxide of relatively high porosity, which exhibits Lewis acidic or Br0nsted acidic behavior. The solid oxide is chemically-treated with an electron-withdrawing component, typically an electron-withdrawing anion, to form an activator-support. While not intending to be bound by the following statement, it is believed that treatment of the inorganic oxide with an electron-withdrawing component augments or enhances the acidity of the oxide. Thus in one aspect, the activator-support exhibits Lewis or Br0nsted acidity which is typically greater than the Lewis or Br0nsted acid strength than the untreated solid oxide, or the activator-support has a greater number of acid sites than the untreated solid oxide, or both. One method to quantify the acidity of the chemically-treated and untreated solid oxide materials is by comparing the polymerization activities of the treated and untreated oxides under acid catalyzed reactions.<br>
In one aspect, the chemically-treated solid oxide comprises a solid inorganic oxide comprising oxjygen and at least one element from Group 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 of the periodic table, or comprising oxygen and at least one element from the lanthanide or actinide elements. (See: Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary, 11th Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons; 1995; Cotton, F.A.; Wilkinson, G.; Murillo; C. A.; and Bochmann; M. Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, 6th Ed., Wiley-lnterscience, 1999.) In another aspect, for example, the

silica-titania, silica-zirconia, zeolites, many clay minerals, alumina-titania, alumina-zirconia, zinc-aluminate and the like.<br>
In one aspect of this invention, the solid oxide material is chemically-treated by contacting it with at least one electron-withdrawing component, typically an electron-withdrawing anion source. Further, the solid oxide material is optionally chemically-treated with a metal ion, then calcining to form a metal-containing or metal-impregnated chemically-treated solid oxide. Alternatively, a solid oxide material and an electron-withdrawing anion source are contacted and calcined simultaneously. The method by which the oxide is contacted with an electron-withdrawing component, typically a salt or an acid of an electron-withdrawing anion, includes, but is not limited to, gelling, co-gelling, impregnation of one compound onto another, and the like. In one aspect, for example, following any contacting method, the contacted mixture of oxide compound, electron-withdrawing anion, and optionally the metal ion is calcined.<br>
The electron-withdrawing component used to treat the oxide is any component that increases the Lewis or Bronsted acidity of the solid oxide upon treatment. In one aspect, the electron-withdrawing component is an electron-withdrawing anion derived from a salt, an acid, or other compound such as a volatile organic compound that may serve as a source or precursor for that anion. Examples of electron-withdrawing anions include, but are not limited to, sulfate, bisulfate, fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, fluorosulfate, fluoroborate, phosphate, fluorophosphate, trifluoroacetate, triflate, fluorozirconate, fluorotitanate, trifluoroacetate, triflate, and the like, including mixtures and combinations thereof. In addition, other ionic or non-ionic compounds that serve as sources for these electron-withdrawing anions may also be employed in the present invention.<br>
When the electron-withdrawing component comprises a salt of an election-withdrawing anion, the counterion or cation of that salt may be any cation that allows the salt to revert or decompose back to the acid during calcining. Factors that dictate the suitability of the particular salt to serve as a source for the electron-withdrawing anion include, but are not limited to, the solubility of the salt in the desired solvent, the lack of adverse reactivity of the cation, ion-pairing effects between the cation and anion, hygroscopic properties imparted fo the salt by the cation, and the like, and thermal stability of the anion. Examples of suitable cations in the salt of the electron-withdrawing anion include, but are not limited to, ammonium, trlkyt ammonium, tetraalkyl ammonium, tetraalkyl phosphonium, H+, [H(OEt2)2]+, and the like.<br>
Further, combinations of one or more different electron-withdrawing anions, in varying proportions, can be used to tailor the specific acidity of the activator-support to the desired level. Combinations of electron-withdrawing components may be contacted with the oxide material<br>
simultaneously or individually, and any order that affords the desired chemically-treated solid oxide acidity. For example, one aspect of this invention is employing two or more electron-withdrawing anion source compounds in two or more separate contacting steps. Thus, one example of such a process by which an chemically-treated solid oxide is prepared is as follows: a selected solid oxide compound, or combination of oxide compounds, is contacted with a first electron-withdrawing anion source compound to form a first mixture, this first mixture is then calcined, the calcined first mixture is then contacted with a second electron-withdrawing anion source compound to form a second mixture, followed by calcining said second mixture to form a treated solid oxide compound, in such a process, the first and second electron-withdrawing anion source compounds are typically different compounds, although they may be the same compound.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the solid oxide activator-support (chemically-treated solid oxide) may be produced by a process comprising:<br>
1)	contacting a solid oxide compound with at least one electron-withdrawing anion<br>
source compound to form a first mixture; and<br>
2)	calcining the first mixture to form the solid oxide activator-support.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, the solid oxide activator-support (chemically-treated solid oxide) is produced by a process comprising:<br>
1)	contacting at least one solid oxide compound with a first electron-withdrawing anion<br>

2)	calcining the first mixture to produce a calcined first mixture;<br>
3)	corltacting the calcined first mixture with a second electron-withdrawing anion source<br>
compound to form a second mixture; and<br>
4)	calf ining the second mixture to form the solid oxide activator-support. Thus, the solid<br>
oxide activator-support is sometimes referred to simply as a treated solid oxide compound.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is producing or forming the chemically-treated solid oxide by contacting at least one solid oxide with at least one electron-withdrawing anion source compound, wherein the at least one solid oxide compound is calcined before, during or after contacting the electron-withdrawing anion source, and wherein there is a substantial absence of aluminoxanes and organoborates.<br>

Examples of fluoroorgano boron compounds that can be used as cocatalysts in the present invention include, but are not limited to, tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron, tris[3,5-bis(trifluororhethyl)phenyl]boron, and the like, including mixtures thereof.<br>
Although not intending to be bound by the following theory, these examples of fluoroorgano borate and fluoroorgano boron compounds, and related compounds, are thought to form "weakly-coordinating" anions when combined with organometal compounds as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,919,983, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Generally, any amount of organoboron compound can be utilized in this invention. In one aspect, the molar ratio of the organoboron compound to the totai of the first and second metallocene compounds in the composition is from 0.1:1 to 10:1. Typically, the amount of the fluoroorgano boron or fluoroorgano borate compound used as a cocatalyst for the metallocenes is in a range of from 0.5 mole to 10 moles of boron compound per total mole of first and second metallocene compounds combined. In one aspect, the amount of fluoroorgano boron or fluoroorgano borate compound used as a cocatalyst for the metallocene is in a range of from 0.8 mole to 5 moles of boron compound per total moles of first and second metallocene compound.<br>
The Optional Ionizing Ionic Compound Cocatalyst<br>
In one aspect, this invention encompasses a catalyst composition comprising a first metallocene compound, a second metallocene compound, at least one chemically-treated solid oxide, and at least one organoaluminum compound. In another aspect, the present invention provides a catalyst composition comprising an optional ionizing ionic compound cocatalyst in addition to these other components. Examples of ionizing ionic compound are disclosed in U.S. Patent Numbers 5,576,259 and 5,807,938, each of which is incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety.<br>
An ionizing ionic compound is an ionic compound which can function to enhance the activity of the catalyst composition. While not bound by theory, it is believed that the ionizing ionic compound may be capable of reacting with the first, second, or both metallocene compounds and converting the metallocenes into a cationic metallocene compounds, or incipient cationic metallocene compounds. Again, while not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the ionizing ionic compound may function as an ionizing compounU by completely or partially extracting an anionic ligand, possibly a non-ŋ5-alkadienyl ligand Such as (X3) or (X4), from the metallocenes. However, the ionizing ionic compound is an activator regardless of whether it is ionizes the metallocenes, abstracts an (X3) or (X4) ligand in a fashion as to form an ion pair, weakens the metal-(X3) or metal-(X4) bond in the metallocenes, simply coordinates to an (X3) or (X4) ligand, or any other mechanisms by which activation may occur.<br>
Further, it is not necessary that the ionizing ionic compound activate the metallocenes only. The activation function of the ionizing ionic compound is evident in the enhanced activity<br>
of catalyst composition as a whole, as compared to a catalyst composition containing catalyst composition that does not comprise any ionizing ionic compound. It is also not necessary that the ionizing ionic compound activate both first and second metallocene compounds, nor is it necessary that it activate the first metallocene compound and the second metallocene compounds to the same extent.<br>

Howevter, the optional ionizing ionic compounds that are useful in this invention are not limited to these<br>
The Olefin Monomer<br>
In one aspect, unsaturated reactants that are useful in the polymerization processes with catalyst compositions and processes of this invention typically include olefin compounds having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms per molecule and having at least one olefinic double bond. This invention encompasses homopolymerization processes using a single olefin such as ethylene or propylene, as well as copolymerization reactions with at least one different olefinic compound. In one aspect of a copolymerization reaction of ethylene, copolymers of ethylene comprise a major amount of ethylene (&gt;50 mole percent) and a minor amount of comonomer 
Acyclic, cyclic, polycyclic, terminal (a), internal, linear, branched, substituted, unsubstituted, functionalized, and non-functionalized olefins may be employed in this invention. For example, typical unsaturated compounds that may be polymerized with the patalysts of this invention include, but are not limited to, propylene, 1-butene, 2-butene, 3-methyl-l-butene, isobutylene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 3-methyl-l-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene,<br>
3-hexene, 3-ethyl-l-hexene, 1-heptene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, the four normal octenes, the four normal nonenes, the five normal decenes, and mixtures of any two or more thereof. Cyclic and bicyclic olefins, including but not limited to, cyclopentene, cyclohexene, norbornylene, norbornadiene. and the like, may also be polymerized as described above.<br>
In one aspect, when a copolymer is desired, the monomer ethylene may be copolymerized with a comonomer. In another aspect, examples of the comonomer include, but are not limited to, propylene, 1-butene, 2-butene, 3-methyl-l-butene, isobutylene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 3-methyt- 1-pentene, 4-methyI- 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, 3-ethyl-l-hexene, 1 -heptane, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, the four normal octenes, the four normal nonenes, or the five norma| decenes. In another aspect, the comonomer may be 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, or styrene.<br>
In one aspect, the amount of comonomer introduced into a reactor zone to produce the copolymer is generally from 0.01 to 50 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. In another aspect, the amount of comonomer introduced into a reactor zone is from 0.01 to 40 weight percent comonomer, and in still another aspect, from 0.1 to 35 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. . Alternatively, an amount sufficient to give the above described concentrations by weight, in the copolymer produced can be used.<br>
While not intending to be bound by this theory, in the event that branched, substituted, or functionalized alefins are used as reactants, it is believed that steric hindrance may impede and/or slow the polymerization process. Thus, branched and/or cyclic portion(s) of the olefin removed somewhat from the carbon-carbon double bond would not be expected to hinder the reaction in the way that the same olefin substituents situated more proximate to the carbon-carbon double bond might. In one aspect, at least one reactant for the catalyst compositions of this invention is ethylene, so the polymerizations are either homopolymerizations or copolymerizations with a different acyclic, cyclic, terminal, internal, linear, branched, substituted, or unsubstituted olefin. In addition, the catalyst compositions of this invention may be used in polymerization of diolefin compounds, including but are not limited to, 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, 1,4-pentadiene, and 1,5-hexadiene.<br>
Preparation of the Catalyst Composition<br>
In one aspect, this invention encompasses a catalyst composition comprising the contact product of a" first metallocene compound, a second metallocene compound, at least one chemically-treated solid oxide, and at least one organoaluminum compound. In another aspect,<br>
this invention encompasses methods of making the catalyst composition encompassing contacting a first metallocene compound, a second metallocene compound, at least one chemically-treated solid oxide, and at least one organoaluminum compound, in any order. In this aspect, an active catalyst composition is obtained with the catalyst components are contacted in any sequence or order.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, the first metallocene compound, the second metallocene compound, or both can optionally be precontacted with an olefinic monomer, not necessarily the olefm monomer to be polymerized, and an organoaluminum cocatlyst for a first period of time prior to contacting this precontacted mixture with the chemically treated solid oxide. In one aspect, the first period of time for contact, the precontact time, between the metallocene compound or compounds, the olefinic monomer, and the ofganoaluminum compound typically range from time 0.1 hour to 24 hours, and from 0.1 to 1 hour is typical. Precontact times from 10 minutes to 30 minutes are also typical.<br>
In yet another aspect of this invention, once the precontacted mixture of the first, second, or both metallocene compounds, olefm monomer, and organoaluminum cocatalyst is contacted with the chemically treated solid oxide, this composition (further comprising the chemically treated solid oxide) is termed the postcontacted mixture. Typically, the postcqntacted mixture may optionally be allowed to remain in contact for a second period of time, the postcontact time, prior to being initiating the polymerization process. In one aspect, postcontact times between the precontacted mixture and the chemically treated solid oxide may range in time from 0.1 hour to 24 hours. In another aspect, for example, postcontact times from 0.1 hour to 1 hour are typical.<br>
In one aspect, the precontacting, the postcontacting step, or both may increase the productivity of the polymer as compared to the same catalyst composition that is prepared without precontacting or postcontacting. However, neither a precontacting step nor a postcontacting step are required for this invention.<br>
The postcontacted mixture may be heated at a temperature and for a duration sufficient to allow adsorption, impregnation, or interaction of precontacted mixture and the chemically treated solid oxide, such that a portion of the components of the precontacted mixture is immobilized, adsorbed, or deposited thereon. For example, the postcontacted mixture may be heated from between 0°F to 150°F. Temperatures between 40°F to 95°F are typical if the mixture is heated<br>
at all.<br>
In one aspect, the molar ratio of the total moles of first and second metallocene compounds combined to the organoaluminum compound may be from 1:1 to 1:10,000. In another aspect, the molar ratio of the total moles of first and second metallocene compounds<br>
combined to this organoaluminum compound may be from 1:1 to 1:1,000, and in another aspect, from 1:1 to1:100. These molar ratios reflect the ratio of the total moles of first and second metallocene compounds combined to the total amount of organoaluminum compound in both the precontacted mixture and the postcontacted mixture combined.<br>
When a precontacting step is used, generally, the molar ratio of olefin monomer to total moles of first and second metallocene compounds combined in the precontacted mixture may be from 1:10 to100,000:1, or from 10:1 to 1,000:1.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, the weight ratio of the chemically treated solid oxide to the organoaluminum compound may range from 1:5 to 1,000:1. In another aspect, the weight ratio of the chemically treated solid oxide to the organoaluminum compound may be from 1:3 to 100: 1, and in yet another aspect, from 1:1 to 50:1.<br>
In a further aspect of this invention, the weight ratio of the first and second metallocene compounds combined to the chemically treated solid oxide may be from 1:1 to 1:1,000,000. In yet another aspect of this invention, the weight ratio of the total moles of first and second metallocene compounds combined to the chemically treated solid oxide which may be from 1:10 to 1:100100, and in another aspect, from 1:20 to 1:1000.<br>
One aspect of this invention is that aluminoxane is not required to form the catalyst composition disclosed herein, a feature that allows lower polymer production costs. Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention can use AIR3-type organoaluminum compounds and a chemically treated solid oxide in the absence of aluminoxanes. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the organoaluminum compounds likely does not activate the metallocene catalyst in the same manner as an organoaluminoxane.<br>
Additionally, no expensive borate compounds or MgCl2 are required to form the catalyst composition of this invention, although aluminoxanes, organoboron compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, organozinc compounds, MgCb, or any combination thereof can optionally be used in the catalyst composition of this invention. Further, in one aspect, cocatalysts such as aluminoxanes, organoboron compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, organozinc compounds, or any combination thereof may be used as cocatalysts with the first and second metallocene compounds, either in the presence or in the absence of the chemically treated solid oxide, and either in the presence or in the absence of the organoaluminum compounds.<br>
In one! aspect, the catalyst activity of the catalyst of this invention is typically greater than or equal to 100 grams polyethylene per gram of chemically treated solid oxide per hour (abbreviated gP/(gCTSOhr)). In another aspect, the catalyst of this invention may be characterized by an activity of greater than or equal to 250 gP/(gCTSOhr), and in another<br>
aspect, an activity of greater than or equal to 500 gP/(gCTSO-hr). In still another aspect, the catalyst of this invention may be characterized by an activity of greater than or equal to 1000 gP/(gCTSO-hr), and in another aspect, an activity of greater than or equal to 2000 gP/(gCTSO-hr). This activity is measured under slurry polymerization conditions, using isobutane as the diluent, and with a polymerization temperature of 90 °C, and an ethyiene pressure of 550 psig. The reactor should have substantially no indication of any wall scale, coating or other forms of fouling upon making these measurements.<br>
In still another aspect of this invention, any combination of the first metallocene compound, the second metallocene compound, the chemically-treated solid oxide, the organoaluminum compound, and the olefin monomer, can optionally be precontacted. In this aspect, when any precontacting occurs with an olefinic monomer, it is not ne4essary that the olefin monomer used in the precontacting step be the same as the olefin to be polymerized. Further, in one aspect, when a precontacting step among any combination of the catalyst components is employed for a first period of time prior, this precontacted mixture may be used in a subsequent, postcontacting step between any other combination of catalyst components for a second period of time. In one aspect, for example, all the catalyst components and 1-hexene can be used in a precontacting step for a first period of time, and this precontacted mixture can then be contacted with the chemically treated solid oxide to form a postcontacted mixture, that is contacted for a second period of time prior to initiating the polymerization reaction. In one aspect, for example, the first period of time for contact, the precontact time, between any combination of the first metallocene compound, the second metallocene compound, the olefmic monomer, the chemically-treated solid oxide, and the organoaluminum compound typically range from 0.1 hour to 24 hours, and from 0.1 to 1 hour is typical. Precontad times from 10 minutes to 30 minutes are also typical. In this aspect, the postcontacted mixture may optionally be allowed to remain in contact for a second period of time, the postcontact time, prior to being initiating the polymerization process. In one aspect, postcontact times between the precontacted mixture and any remaining catalyst components may range in time from 0.1 hour to 24 hours. In another aspect, for example, postcontact times from 0.1 hour to 1 hour are typical.<br>

Such polymerization processes include, but are not limited to slurry polymerizations, gas phase polymerizations, solution polymerizations, and the like, including multi-reactor combinations thereof. Thus, any polymerization zone known in the art to produce<br>
ethylene-contajning polymers can be utilized. For example, a stirred reactor can be utilized for a batch process, pr the reaction can be carried out continuously in a loop reactor or in a continuous stirred reactor In one aspect, for example, the polymerization reaction of this invention is carried out in a loop reactor.<br>
After qatalyst activation, a catalyst composition is used to homopolymerize ethylene, or copolymerize ethylene with a comonomer. In one aspect, a typical polymerization method is a slurry polymerization process (also known as the particle form process), which is well known in the art and is,disclosed, for example in U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179, which is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety. Other polymerization methods of the present invention for slurry processes are those employing a loop reactor of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179, and those utilized in a plurality of stirred reactors either in series, parallel, or combinations thereof, wherein the reaction conditions are different in the different reactors, which is also incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety.<br>
In one aspect, polymerization temperature for this invention may range from 60°C to 280°C, and in another aspect, polymerization reaction temperature may range from 70°C to<br>
The polymerization reaction typically occurs in an inert atmosphere, that is, in an atmosphere substantial free of oxygen and under substantially anhydrous conditions, thus, in the absence of Water as the reaction begins. Therefore a dry, inert atmosphere, for example, dry nitrogen or dry argon, is typically employed in the polymerization reactor.<br>
The polymerization reaction pressure can be any pressure that does not terminate the polymerization reaction, and is typically conducted at a pressure higher than the pretreatment pressures. In one aspect, polymerization pressures may be from atmospheric pressure to 1000 psig. In another aspect, polymerization pressures may be from 50 psig to 800 psig. Further, hydrogen cart be used in the polymerization process of this invention to control polymer molecular weight.<br>
Polymerizations using the catalysts of this invention can be carried out in any manner known in the art. Such processes that can polymerize monomers into polymers include, but are not limited tq slurry polymerizations, gas phase polymerizations, solution polymerizations, and multi-reactor combinations thereof. Thus, any polymerization zone known in the art to produce olefin-contaiiting polymers can be utilized. For example, a stirred reactor can be utilized for a batch process, or the reaction can be carried out continuously in a loop reactor or in a continuous stirred reactor. Typically, the polymerizations disclosed herein are carried out using a slurry polymerization process in a loop reaction zone. Suitable diluents used in slurry polymerization<br>
are well known in the art and include hydrocarbons which are liquid under reaction conditions. The term "diluent" as used in this disclosure does not necessarily mean an inert material, as this term is meant to include compounds and compositions that may contribute to polymerization process. Examples of hydrocarbons that can be used as diluents include, but are not limited to, cyclohexane, isobutane, n-butane, propane, n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and n-hexane. Typically, isobutane is used as the diluent in a slurry polymerization. Examples of this technology are found in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,424,341; 4,501,885; 4,613,484; 4,737,280; and 5,597,892; each of which is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety.<br>
For purposes of the invention, the term polymerization reactor includes any polymerization reactor or polymerization reactor system known in the art that is capable of polymerizing olefin monomers to produce homopolymers or copolymers of the present invention. Such reactors can comprise slurry reactors, gas-phase reactors, solution reactors, or any combination thereof. Gas phase reactors can comprise fluidized bed reactors or tubular reactors. Slurry reactors can comprise vertical loops or horizontal loops. Solution reactors can comprise stirred tank or autoclave reactors.<br>
Polymerization reactors suitable for the present invention can comprise at least one raw material feed system, at least one feed system for catalyst or catalyst componehts, at least one reactor system, at least one polymer recovery system or any suitable combination thereof. Suitable reactors for the present invention can further comprise any one, or combination of, a catalyst storage system, an extrusion system, a cooling system, a diluent recycling system, or a control system. Such reactors can comprise continuous take-off and direct recycling of catalyst, diluent, and polymer. Generally, continuous processes can comprise the continuous introduction of a monomer, a catalyst, and a diluent into a polymerization reactor and the continuous removal from this reactor of a suspension comprising polymer particles and the diluent.<br>
Polymerization reactor systems of the present invention can comprise one type of reactor per system or multiple reactor systems comprising two or more types of realtors operated in parallel or in series. Multiple reactor systems can comprise reactors connected together to perform polymerization, or reactors that are not connected. The polymer can be polymerized in one reactor under one set of conditions, and then the polymer can be transferred to a second reactor for polymerization under a different set of conditions.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise at least one loop slurry reactor. Such reactors are known in the art and can comprise vertical or horizontal loops. Such loops can comprise a single loop or a series of loops. Multiple loop reactors can comprise both vertical and horizontal loops. The slurry polymerization can be<br>
performed in an organic solvent that can disperse the catalyst and polymer. Examples of suitable solvents include butane, hexane, cyclohexane, octane, and isobutane. Monomer, solvent, catalyst and arty comonomer are continuously fed to a loop reactor where polymerization occurs. Polymerization can occur at low temperatures and pressures. Reactor effluent can be flashed to remove the solid resin.<br>
In yet another aspect of this invention, the polymerization reactor can comprise at least one gas phase reactor. Such systems can employ a continuous recycle stream containing one or more monomers continuously cycled through the fluidized bed in the presence of the catalyst under polymerization conditions. The recycle stream can be withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product can be withdrawn from the reactor and now or fresh monomer can be added to replace the polymerized monomer. Such gas phase reactors can comprise a process for multi-step gas-phase polymerization of olefins, in which olefins are polymerized in the gaseous phase in at least two independent gas-phase polymerization zones while feeding a catalyst-containing polymer formed in a first polymerization zone to a second polymerization zone.<br>
In still another aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor can comprise a tubular reactor. Tubular reactors can make polymers by free radical initiation, or by employing the catalysts typically used for coordination polymerization. Tubular reactors can have several zones where fresh monomer, initiators, or catalysts are added. Monomer can be entrained in an inert gaseous stream and introduced at one zone of the reactor. Initiators, catalysts, and/or catalyst components can be entrained in a gaseous stream and introduced at another zone of the reactor. The gas streams are intermixed for polymerization. Heat and pressure can be employed appropriately to obtain optimal polymerization reaction conditions.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor can comprise a solution polymerization reactor. During solution polymerization, the monomer is contacted with the catalyst composition by suitable stirring or other means. A carrier comprising an inert organic diluent or excess monomer can be employed. If desired, the monomer can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures and pressures that will result in the formation! of a solution of the polymer in a reaction medium. Agitation can be employed during polymerization to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures throughout the polymerization zone. Adequate means are utilized for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization. The polymerization can be effected in a batch<br>
manner, or in a continuous manner. The reactor can comprise a series of at least one separator that employs high pressure and low pressure to separate the desired polymer.<br>
in a further aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise the combination of two or more reactors. Production of polymers in multiple reactors can include several stages in at least two separate polymerization reactors interconnected by a transfer device making it possible to transfer the polymers resulting from the first polymerization reactor into the second reactor. The desired polymerization conditions in one of the reactors can be different from the operating conditions of the other reactors. Alternatively, polymerizaion in multiple reactors can include the manual transfer of polymer from one reactor to subsequent reactors for continued polymerization. Such reactors can include any combination including, but not limited to, multiple loop reactors, multiple gas reactors, a combination of loop and gas reactors, a combination of autoclave reactors or solution reactors with gas or loop reactors, multiple solution reactors, or multiple autoclave reactors.<br>
After the polymers are produced, they can be formed into various articles, including but not limited to, household containers, utensils, film products, drums, fuel tanks, pipes, geomembranes, and liners. Various processes can form these articles. Usually, additives and modifiers are added to the polymer in order to provide desired effects. By using the invention described herein, articles can likely be produced at a lower cost, while maintaining most or all of the unique properties of polymers produced with metallocene catalysts.<br>
Ethylene Polymers Prepared According to this Invention<br>
Tables 1 through 8 and the Examples provide data for the polyethylene resins produced using the catalyst compositions of this invention, and for polyethylene resins produced using standard or comparative catalyst compositions. Table 1 provides a summary of catalyst pretreatments, while Table 2 provides a listing of components used for the precontacting step in the precontactor.<br>
A polymerization run using a first metallocene, (ŋ5-CsH4Bu)2ZrCl2 (A) alone was conducted because (ŋ5-C5H/Bu)2ZrCl2 is used as a first metallocene in many of the Examples provided herein. These data appear in Tables 3A and 3B and provide a baseline or control by which to compare the dual metallocene catalyst compositions.<br>
A polymerization   using the first metallocene, (ŋ5-C5Bu)2ZrCl2 (A) combined with<br>
the tightly-bridged second metallocene, methyl-3-butenylmethyiidene(ŋ5-cyclopentadienyl)(ŋ5-9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride (B) was also conducted. Tables 4A and 4B provide the resin and film properties for polyethylene prepared using this dual metallocene catalyst. Thus, when<br>
(ŋ5 -C5H4nBu)2ZCl2 was combined with a metallocene that is tightly-bridged by a single carbon atom, the resulting resin was characterized by a lower Ml as compared to using (ŋ5-C5H4Bu)eZrCl2alone, but also substantially decreases MD tear.<br>
A polymerization run using the first metallocene, (ŋ5-C5H4nBu)2ZrCl2 (A) combined with a tightly-bridged second metallocene, either compound C or D as shown in Tables 5A and 5B, was also conducted. Tables 5A and 5B provide the resin and film properties for polyethylene prepared using this dual metallocene catalyst. Thus, when (ŋ5-C5H4nBu)2ZrCl2 was combined with a tightly-bridged metallocene, specifically, a metallocene bridged by a single silicon atom, the resulting resin was characterized by a lower MI as compared to using (ŋ5-C5H4Bu)ZrCl2 alone, but also 4 substantially decreased MD tear.<br>
A polymerization run using the first metallocene, (ŋ5-C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2 (A) combined with a second, loosely-bridged metallocene, either compound E, F, or G as shown in Tables 6A and 6B was also conducted. Tables 6A and 6B provide the resin and film properties for polyethylene prepared using this dual metallocene catalyst. Thus, when (ŋ5-C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2 was combined with a loosely-bridged metallocene, specifically, a 3- or 4-carbon atom bridged metallocene, the resulting resin was characterized by a lower MI as compared to using (ŋ5-C5H4nBu)2ZrCl2 alone, without decreasing MD tear, and with generally decreasing haze.<br>
A polymerization run using the first metallocene, (ŋ5-C5Bu)2ZrCl2 (A) combined with a second, more highly-substituted metallocene, compound (ŋ5-C5H3nBuMe)2ZrCl2 (H), as shown in Tables 7A pnd 7B, was also conducted. Tables 7A and 7B provide the resin and film properties for polyethylene prepared using this dual metallocene catalyst. Thus, when (ŋ5-C5Bu)2ZrCl2 was combined with a more highly-substituted metallocene such as (ŋ5-C5H3nBuMe)22rCb, specifically, a metallocene wherein the cyclopentadienyl-type ligand is more highly-substituted, the resulting resin was characterized by a lower MI as compared to using (ŋ5 -C5H4nBu)2ZrCl2 alone, without substantially decreasing MD tear.<br>
A polymerization run using the first metallocene, (ŋ5-CsH4nBu)2ZrCl2 (A) combined with the second hafhium metallocene (ŋ5-C5H4Bu)2HfCl2 (I) was also conducted. Tables 8A and 8B provides the resin and film properties for polyethylene prepared using this dual metallocene catalyst. This, when (ŋ5-CsfVBu)ZrCb was combined with a hafnium metallocene (ŋ5-C5H4nBu)2HfCl2, the resulting resin was characterized by a lower MI as compared to using (ŋ5-CsHBuZrCl2 alone, without substantially decreasing MD tear.<br>
In one aspect, for example, the data disclosed herein indicate that, among other things, under the practical conditions of a loop reactor, a catalyst in which (ŋ5-CslVBu)2ZrCl2 (A) is<br>
the only metallocene employed affords polymer which is generally too high in MI to afford adequate melt strength for blowing film. Additionally, given the high Ml and narrow molecular weight distribution of such polymers, (ŋ5-C5H4nBu)2ZrCl2 (A) provides a polymen with too much haze for many LLDPE film applications. However, upon adding the second metallocene which produces higher molecular weight polymer to the catalyst composition provides aipolymer with a lower MI, and hence, increased melt strength for blowing film, without sacrificing useful polymer film properties such as MD tear. In this aspect, the second metallocene compounds, when employed in the catalyst compositions without a first metallocene compound, possess sufficient activity, the addition of hydrogen to control MI may not be necessary in the dual metallocene catalyst compositions of this invention.<br>

Definitions<br>
In order to more clearly define the terms used herein, the following definitions are provided. To the extent that any definition or usage provided by any document incorporated herein by reference conflicts with the definition or usage provided herein, the definition or usage provided herein controls.<br>
The term "polymer" is used herein to mean homopolymers comprising ethyiene and copolymers of ethyiene and another olefinic comonomer. Polymer is also used herein to mean homopolymers and copolymers of any other poiymerizable monomer disclosed herein.<br>
The term "cocatalyst" is generally used herein to refer to the organoaluminum compounds that may constitute one component of the catalyst composition, but also refers to the optional components of the catalyst composition including, but not limited to, aluminoxanes, organoboron compounds, organozinc compounds, or ionizing ionic compounds, as disclosed herein. The term cocatalyst may be used regardless of the actual function of the compound or any chemical mechanism by which the compound may operate. In one aspect, the term cocatalyst is used to distinguish that component of the catalyst composition from the first and second metaiiocene compounds.<br>
The term "precontacted" mixture is used herein to describe a first mixture of catalyst components that are contacted for a first period of time prior to the first mixture being used to form a "postcontacted" or second mixture of catalyst components that are contacfed for a second period of time. Typically, the precontacted mixture describes a mixture ,of metaiiocene compound (first, second, or both), olefin monomer, and organoaluminum compound, before this mixture is contacted with the chemically treated solid oxide and optionally additional organoaluminum compound. Thus, "precontacted" describes components that are used to contact each other, but prior to contacting the components in the second, postcontacted mixture. Accordingly, this invention may occasionally distinguish between a component  used to prepare the precontacted mixture and that component after the mixture has been prepares. For example, according to this description, it is possible for the precontacted organoaluminum compound, once it is contacted with the metaiiocene and the olefm monomer, to have reacted to form at least one different chemical compound, formulation, or structure from the distinct (organoaluminum compound used to prepare the precontacted mixture. In this case, t|e precontacted<br>
organoaluminum compound or component is described as comprising an organoaluminum compound that was used to prepare the precontacted mixture.<br>
Similarly, the term "postcontacted" mixture is used herein to describe a second mixture of catalyst components that are contacted for a second period of time, and one constituent of which is the "precontacted" or first mixture of catalyst components that were contacted for a first period of time Typically, the term "postcontacted" mixture is used herein to describe the mixture of first metallocene compound, first metallocene compound, olefin monomer, organoaluminum compound, and chemically treated solid oxide, formed from contacting the precontacted mixture of a portion of these components with any additional components added to make up the postcontacted mixture. Generally, the additional component added to make up the postcontacted rnixture is the chemically treated solid oxide, and optionally may include an organoaluminum compound the same or different from the organoaluminum compound used to prepare the precontacted mixture, as described herein. Accordingly, this invention may also occasionally distinguish between a component used to prepare the postcontacted mixture and that component after the mixture has been prepared.<br>
The term metallocene, as used herein, describes a compound comprising two ŋ5-cycloaikadienvil-type ligands in the molecule. Thus, the metallocenes of this invention are bis(ŋ5-cyclopentadienyl-type ligand) compounds, wherein the ŋ5-cycloalkadienyl portions include cyclopentadienyi Iigands, indenyl Iigands, fluorenyl Iigands, and the like, including partially saturated or substituted derivatives or analogs of any of these. Possible substituents on these Iigands include hydrogen, therefore the description "substituted derivatives thereof in this invention comprises partially saturated Iigands such as tetrahydroindenyl, tetrahydrofluorenyl, octahydrofluolenyl, partially saturated indenyl, partially saturated fluorenyl, substituted partially saturated indetiyl, substituted partially saturated fluorenyl, and the like. In some contexts, the metallocene is referred to simply as the "catalyst", in much the same way the term "cocatalyst" is used herein to refer to the organoaluminum compound. Unless otherwise specified, the following abbreviations are used: Cp for cyclopentadienyi; Ind for indenyl; and Flu for fluorenyl.<br>
The terms "catalyst composition," "catalyst mixture," and the like do not depend upon the actual product resulting from the contact or reaction of the components of the mixtures, the nature of the active catalytic site, or the fate of the aluminum cocatalyst, the first metallocene compound, tie second metaliocene compound, any olefm monomer used to prepare a precontacted mixture, or the chemically treated solid oxide after combining these components.<br>
Therefore, the terms catalyst composition, catalyst mixture, and the like may include both heterogeneous compositions and homogenous compositions.<br>
The term "hydrocarbyl" is used herein to specify a hydrocarbon radical group that includes, but is not limited to aryl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkadienyl, alkynyl, aralkyl, aralkenyl, aralkynyl, and the like, and includes all substituted, unsubstituted, branched, linear, heteroatom substituted derivatives thereof.<br>
The terms chemically treated solid oxide, solid oxide activator-support, acidic activator-support, activator-support, treated solid oxide compound, or simply activator, and the like are used herein to indicate a solid, inorganic oxide of relatively high porosity, which exhibits Lewis acidic or Br0nsted acidic behavior, and which has been treated with an electron-withdrawing component, typically an anion, and which is calcined. The electron-withdrawing component is typically an electron-withdrawing anion source compound. Thus, the chemically treated solid oxide compound comprises the calcined contact product of at least one solid oxide compound with at least one electron-withdrawing anion source compound. Typically, the chemically treated solid oxide comprises at least one ionizing, acidic solid oxide compound. The terms support or activator-support are not used to imply these components are inert, and this component should not be construed as an inert component of the catalyst composition.<br>
Although any methods, devices, and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, the typical methods, devices and materials are herein described.<br>
All publications and patents mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing, for example, the constructs and methodologies that are described in the publications, which might be used in connection with the presently described invention. The publications discussed above and throughout the text are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing herein is toibe construed as an admission that the inventors are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior<br>
invention.<br>
For any particular compound disclosed herein, any general structure presented also encompasses all conformational isomers, regioisomers, and stereoisomers that may arise from a particular set of substituents. The general structure also encompasses a|ll enantiomers, diastereomers, and other optical isomers whether in enantiomeric or racemic forms, as well as mixtures of stereoisomers, as the context requires.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which are not to be construed in any way as imposing limitations upon the scope thereof. On the contrary, it is to be<br>
clearly understood that resort may be had to various other aspects, embodiments, modifications, and equivalents thereof which, after reading the description herein, may suggest themselves to one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention or the scope of the appended claims.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 General Testing Procedures<br>
Melt index (MI, g/10 min) was determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 condition F at 190°C with a 2,160 gram weight.<br>
High l$ad melt index (HLMI, g/10 min) was determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 condition E at 190°C with a 21,600 gram weight.<br>
Polymer density was determined in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc) on a compression molded sample, cooled at 15°C per hour, and conditioned for 40 hours at room temperature in accordance wifi ASTM Dl 505 and ASTM Dl 928, procedure C.<br>
Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions were obtained using a Waters 150 CV gel permeation chromatograph with trichlorobenzene (TCB) as the solvent, with a flow rate of 1 milliliter minute at a temperature of 140°C. 2,6-Di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) at a concentration of 1.0 gram per liter was used as a stabilizer in the TCB. An injection volume of 220m liters was used with a nominal polymer concentration of 0.3 gram/liter at room temperature. Dissolution of the sample in stabilized TCB was carried out by heating at 160-170°C for 20 hours with occasional, gentle agitation. The column was two Waters HT-6E columns (7.8 nmx300 mm). The columns were calibrated with a broad linear polyethylene standard (Phillips Marlex.RTM. BHB 5003) for which the molecular weight had been determined.<br>
All the blown film samples were made on a laboratory-scale blown film line using typical linear low-derisity (LLDPE) conditions as follows: 100 mm (4 inch) die diameter, 1.5 mm (0.060 inch) die gap, 37.5 mm (1.5 inch) diameter single-screw extruder fitted with a barrier screw with a Maddock mixing section at the end (L/D=24, 2.2:1 compression ratio), 115 RPM screw speed f E7 kg/h (60 Ib/h) output rate], 2.5:1 blow up ratio (BUR), "in-pocket" bubble with a "freeze line height" (FLH) between 20-28 cm (8-11 inch), 190 °C (375 °F) barrel and die set temperatures and 1 mil (25 micron) thick film. Cooling was accomplished with a Dual Lip air ring using ambient (laboratory) air at 25 °C (75-80 °F). These particular processing conditions were chosen since the film properties so obtained are typically representative of those obtained from larger, cqmmercial scale film blowing conditions.<br>
The haze (%) was measured in accordance with the procedures specified in ASTM D 1003-97, using a Haze Gard Plus™ instrument (Model 4725) made by the BYK-Gardner® Company.<br>
Dart impact strength was measured in accordance with ASTM D-1709 (method A).<br>
Pendulum impact strength (more commonly known as Spencer impact) strength was measured in accordance with ASTM D-3420. However, a special (more severe) pendulum head, which was manufactured in-house, was used for these samples since they did not fail with the standard pendulum using the maximum pendulum weight.<br>
Machine (MD) and transverse (TD) direction Elmendorf tear strengths were measured on a Testing Machines Inc. tear tester (Model 83-11-00) in accordance with ASTM D-1922.<br>
Melt rheologica! characterizations were performed as follows. Smajll-strain (10%) oscillatory shear measurements were performed on a Rheometrics Scientitic, Inc. ARES rheometer using parallel-plate geometry. All rheological tests were performed at 190 °C. The complex viscosity versus frequency  data were then curve fitted using the modified three parameter Carreau-Yasuda (CY) empirical model to obtain the zero shear viscosity - % characteristic viscous relaxation time - r and the breadth parameter - a. The simplified Carreau-Yasuda (CY) empirical model is as follows.wherein:         |n*(α)| = magnitude of complex shear viscosity; ŋ0 = zero shear viscosity<br>
T = viscous relaxation time n<br>
a = "breadth" parameter<br>
n = fixes the final power law slope, fixed at 2/11; and a) = angular frequency of oscillatory shearing deformation.<br>
Details of the significance and interpretation of the CY model and derived parameters may be found in: C. A. Hieber and H. H. Chiang, Rheol. Ada, 28, 321 (1989); C.A. Hieber and H.H. Chiang, Polym. Eng. Sci., 32, 931 (1992); and R. B. Bird, R. C. Armstrong and 0. Hasseger, Dynamics of Polymeric Liquids, Volume 1, Fluid Mechanics, 2nd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons<br>
(1987); each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The CY "a" parameter is reported in the tables for the resins disclosed herein.<br>
A "Quantachrome Autosorb-6 Nitrogen Pore Size Distribution Instrument" was used to determined specific surface area ("surface area") and specific pore volume ("pore volume"). This instrument was acquired from the Quantachrome Corporation, Syosset, N.Y.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 Preparation oj a Fluorided Silica-Alumina Activator-Support<br>
The silica-alumina used to prepare the fluorided silica-alumina acidic activator-support in this Example was obtained from W.R. Grace as Grade MS13-110, containing 13% alumina, having a pore volume of 1.2 cc/g and a surface area of 400 m2/g. This material was fluorided by impregnation to incipient wetness with a solution containing ammonium bifluoride in an amount sufficient to equal 10 wt % of the weight of the silica-alumina. This impregnated material was then dried in a vacuum oven for 8 hours at 10Q°C. The fluorided silica-alumina samples obtained in this manner were then calcined as follows. 10 grams of the alumina were placed in a 1.75-inch quartz tube fitted with a sintered quartz disk at the bottom. While the silica was supported bn the disk, dry air was blown up through the disk at the linear rate of 1.6 to 1.8 standard cubic feet per hour. An electric furnace around the quartz tube was used to increase the temperature of the tube at the rate of 400°C per hour to a final temperature of 450°C. At this temperature, the silica-alumina was allowed to fluidize for three hours in the dry air. Afterward, the silica-alumina was collected and stored under dry nitrogen, and was used without exposure to the atmosphere<br>

Specific Preparations<br>
All manipulations involving air-sensitive reagents and materials were performed under nitrogen by using Schlenk line or dry box techniques. THF was distilled from potassium. Anhydrous diethyl ether, methylene chloride, pentane and toluene were obtained from Fisher Scientific Company and stored over activated alumina. All solvents were degassed and stored under nitrogen. Zirconium(IV) chloride (99.5%) and n-butyllithium were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Products were analyzed by 'H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, referenced against the peak of residual CHCI3 at 7.24 ppm) or I3C NMR (7: MHz, CDCb, referenced against central line of CDCb at 77.00 ppm).<br>
Preparation of rac-C3H6(Ind)2ZrCl2 (E)<br>
a. Synthesis of l,3-bis(3-indenyl)propane. Technical grade indene (92% GC purity) (200 mL) was mixed with 1 liter of dry THF under nitrogen. The solutjon was cooled with dry ice and n-BuLi (640 mL, 2.5 M in hexanes, 1.6 mols) was added over a period of 45 minutes. The dry ice bath was removed allowing the mixture to warm while stirring for 2 hours at room temperature. The resulting red solution was gradually added to 1,3-dibromopropane (75 mL, 0.74 moles) in 100 mL of dry THF at 0 °C over a period of 45 minutes, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 14 hours at room temperature. The final resulting solutior was cooled to below 5 °C and held below 6 °C while adding 600 mL of 3 M HCI aqueous solution. After the ice bath was removed, the yellow mixture was stirred for 1 hour. This mixturq was extracted with 200 mL of diethyl ether, and the resulting organic layer was washed with  x 300 mL of water and 100 mL of brine and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. As the solvent was removed under vacuum a white solid began to form. The mixture wa$ cooled to-15 °C in a freezer overnight. The solid was broken up, filtered off, and washed with cold methanol. After air drying and breaking up further and drying further, a slightly yellow solidj(I67.3 g, 83% yield) was obtained. 'H NMR (300 MHz, CDCb) 5 7.53 (d, J= 1.2 Hz, 2H), 7.43 [d, J= 7.2 Hz, 2H), 7.36 (t, J= 7.2 Hz, 2H), 7.26 (t, J= 7.2 Hz, 2H), 6.31 (broad s, 2H), 3.39 Jd, J= 1.8 Hz,<br>
4H), 2.65-2.80 (dt, J = 7.2 Hz, 1.2 Hz, 4H), 2.17 (quin, J= 7.2 Hz, 2H); I3C NMR (75 MHz, CDCI3)S 145.J, 144.5, 144.2, 127.9, 126.0, 124.5, 123.7, 118.9,37.7,27.6,26.2.<br>
b. Synthesis of rac-C3H6(Ind)2ZrCl2. The ligand l,3-bis(indenyl)propane (10.88 g, 40 mmol) was, dissolved in 400 mL of dry THF and cooled to -78 °C under nitrogen. A portion of n-BuLi (33.6 mL, 2.5 M in hexanes, 84 mmol) was added dropwise over 30 minutes to the solution. The resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for an additional 3 hours, giving rise to a red brown solution. Into a separate flask cooled to -78 °C and containing ZrCI4 (9.8 g, 412 mmol) was added 20 mL of pentane followed by a slow addition of 410 mL of THF, giving rise to a white suspension. After warming to room temperature and stirring for an additional 2 hfcurs, the suspension fully dissolved to yield a clear, colorless solution. Both solutions were lsimultaneously added, via cannula, over 4 hours to a third flask containing 50 mL of rapidly stirred THF at room temperature. After the addition was completed, the solution was stirred overnignt at room temperature, giving rise to an orange solution. Removal of the solvent gave an orange, solid (a crude product). According to the 'H NMR spectrum of the crude product, the ratio of racemic isomer to meso isomer is 10 to 1. Toluene (800 mL) was added to the crude product to givq an off yellow solid and an orange yellow solution. The solid was removed by centrifuge.

The solution was cooled with dry ice and n-BuLi (184 mL, 2.5 M in hexanes, 0.46 moles) was added dropwise. The dry ice bath was removed allowing the mixture to warm while stirring for 4 hours at room temperature. The resulting red solution was added dropwise to 1,4-dibromobutane (43.2g, 0.2 moles) in 80 mL of dry THI at 0 °C. The resulting mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The final resulting solution was quenched with 5 wt% HCI in ice bath. The mixture from above was extracted with diethyl ether. The resulting organic layer was washed with water and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. Removal of the solvent gave a pale yellow solid.<br>
The solid was washed with hot pentane to afford the product as a pale yellow solid (45 g, 78.7% yield).

b. Synthesis of rac-C4H8(Ind)2ZrCI2. The ligand l,4-bis(3-indenyl)butane (6.66 g, 23.2 mmol) was dissolved in 250 mL of dry THF and cooled to -78 °C under nitrogen. A portion of n-BuLi (19.5 mL, 2.5 M in hexanes, 48.7 mmol) was added dropwise to the ligand solution. The resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for an additional 3.5 hours. Into a separate flask cooled to -78 °C and containing ZrCl (5.7 g, 24 .5 mmol) was added 15 mL of pentane followed by a slow addition of 255 mL of THF, giving rise to a white suspension. After warming to room temperature and stirring for an additional 3 hours, the suspension fully dissolved to yield a clear, colorless solution. Both solutions were simultaneously added, via cannula, over 4 hours to a third flask containing 40' mL of rapidly stirred THF at room temperature. After the addition was completed, the solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. Removal of the solvent gave an orange-yellow solid (crude product). Toluene (700 mL) was added to the crude product to give an off yellow solid and a yellow solution. The solid was removed by centrifuge. After reducing the volume of the filtrate to 250 mL, pentane was added slowly until the solution just started to turn cloudly. The mixture was stored at -10 to -15 °C.

The solution was transferred to a steel vessel and diluted with isobutane to give a total of 40 pounds. This solution was fed to the precontactor.<br>
Method C. The appropriate amounts of metal locenes were dissolved in dry, degassed solvent under nitrogen. This solution was transferred to a steel vessel and diluted with isobutane to give a total of 40 pounds. This solution was fed to the precontactor.<br>
Method D. 150 mL of toluene was added to the flask containing the appropriate amounts of metal locenes followed by addition of TEA (triethylaluminum) and 1-hexene at room temperature. The mixture was stirred for 2 hr at room temperature, then charged into a steel vessel. The rest of toluene was then added and the contents were diluted with isobutane to a total of 40 pounds. This solution was fed to the precontactor.<br>

EXAMPLE 5 Description of a Typical Polymerization Run<br>
Ethylene copolymers were prepared in a continuous particle form process(also known as a slurry process) by contacting the catalyst of the present invention with ethylerie and 1-hexene comonomer. The polymerization medium and polymerization temperature are thus selected such that the copolymer is produced in the form of solid particles and is recovered in that form. General polymerization reaction details are as follows.<br>
Ethylene that was dried over activated alumina was used as the monomer Isobutane that had been degassed by fractionation and dried over activated alumina was used as the diluent.<br>
The polymerization reactor was a liquid-full 15.2 cm diameter pipe loop having a volume of 23 (87 liters) or 27 gallons (102 liters). The fluorided silica-alumina, the 0.1 wt% triethylaluminum solution in isobutane, the metallocene solution or solutions prepared as above and a portion of the total isobutane diluent were all fed to the reactor through a precontacting vessel (0.5 or 2.0 Liters), where the three ingredients contacted each other at room temperature for 10 to 30 minutes, before entering the reaction zone. The precontactor consisted of a stirred Autoclave Engineers Magnadrive reactor with a volume of either 0.5 or 2.0 Liters as indicated in the tables below, which fed directly into the loop reactor. The chemically trdated solid oxide (CTSO) was added to the precontactor through a 0.35 cc circulating ball-check feeder using a small isobutane flow, as indicated above. Occasionally some hydrogen was added to the reactor to regulate the molecular weight of the polymer product. The reactor pressure was 4 Mpa ( 580 psi). The reactor temperature was varied over a range, from 65°C to 110°C, as indicated. The polymerization reactor was operated to have a residence time of 1.25 hours At steady-state conditions the total isobutane feed rate was 46 liters per hour, the ethylene feed rate was 30 Ibs/hr, and the 1 -hexene feed rate was varied to control the density of the polymer product. Ethylene concentration in the diluent was from 14 to 20 mole percent. Catalyst concentrations in the reactor are such that the CTSO system content typically ranges from O.00l to 1 weight percent based on the weight of the reactor contents. Polymer was removed from the reactor at the rate of 25 Ibs per hour and recovered in a flash chamber. A Vulcan dryer was used to dry the polymer under nitrogen from 60°C to 80°C.<br>
To prevent static buildup in the reactor, a small amount (5 ppm relative to diluent) of a commercial antistatic agent sold as Stadis 450 was typically added.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 Ethylene Polymerization Using (ŋ5-CsHnBu)2ZrCl2<br>
Polymerization runs using the single metallocene, (ŋ5-C5Bu)2ZrCl2 (A), fluorided silica-alumina and triethylaluminum were conducted using the methods as described herein and in Tables 3A and 3B. Only fluorided CTSO and TEA were used in these Examples. See Table 1 for metallocene solution preparation, Table 2 for catalyst feeds to the precontactor, and Table 3A for reactor conditions.<br>
Table3B provides the resin and film properties for polyethylene prepared using the single metallcene catalyst comprising (ŋ5-C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2 (A) as shown. Because the metallocene compound (ŋ5 -C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2 (A) is used as a first metallocene in many of the Examples provided herein, these data provide a baseline or control by which to compare the dual metallocene catalyst compositions.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 Ethylene Polymerization Using (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2 and a Tightly-Bridged Metallocene<br>
Polymerization runs using the first metallocene, (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  (A), and the tightly-bridged sepond metallocene, methyl-3-butenylmethylidene((ŋ5cyclopentadienyl)((ŋ5-9-fluorenyl)zircnium dichloride (B), shown in Tables 4A and 4B, fluorided silica-alumina, and triethylaluminum were conducted using the methods as described herein. See Table 1 for metallocene solution preparation and Table 2 for catalyst feeds to the precontactor.<br>
Table 4A illustrates typical polymerization and reactor conditions for polyethylene prepared using a dual metallocene catalyst comprising compounds A + B as shown, while Table 4B provides the resin and film properties for polyethylene prepared using the dual metallocene catalyst comprising compounds A + B. Thus, when (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  is combined with a metallocene that is tightly-bridged by a single carbon atom, the resulting resin is characterized by a lower Ml as compared to using (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  alone, but also substantially decreases MD tear.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Ethylene Polymerization Using (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  and a Metallocene Tightly-Bridged with a SiMe2 Group'<br>
Polymerization runs using the first metallocene, (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2 (A), the second metallocene, either compound C or D as shown in Tables 5A and 5B, fluorided silica-alumina,<br>
and triethylaluminum were conducted using the methods as described herein.   See Table 1 for metallocene solution preparation and Table 2 for catalyst feeds to the precontactor.<br>
Table 5A illustrates the polymerization and reactor conditions for polyethylene prepared using a dual metallocene catalyst comprising compounds A + C or A + D, as shown, while Table 5B provides the resin and film properties for polyethylene prepared using the dual metallocene catalyst comprising compounds A + C or A + D. Thus, when (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  (A) is combined with a tightly-bridged metallocene, specifically, a metallocene bridged by a single silicon atom, the resulting resin is characterized by a lower MI as compared to using (r|5-alone, but also a substantially decreased MD tear.<br>
EXAMPLE 9 Ethylene Polymerization Using (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  and a Loosely- Bridged Metallocene<br>
Polymerization runs using the first metallocene, (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  (A) the second, loosely-bridged metallocene, either compound E, F, or G as shown in Tables 6A and 6B, fluorided silica-alumina, and triethylaluminum were conducted using the methods as described herein. See Table 1 for metallocene solution preparation and Table 2 for catalyst feeds to the precontactor.<br>
Table 6A illustrates the polymerization and reactor conditions for polyethylene prepared using a dual metallocene catalyst comprising compounds A + E, A + F, or A +G, as shown, while Table 6B provides the resin and film properties for polyethylene prepared using the dual metallocene catalyst comprising compounds A + E, A + F, or A + G. Thus, when (ŋ5<br>
(A) is combined with a loosely-bridged metallocene, specitically, a 3- or 4-carbon atom bridged metallocene, the resulting resin is characterized by a lower  as compared to using (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  alone, without decreasing MD tear, and with generally decreasing haze.<br>
This Example helps demonstrate, among other things, that under the practical conditions of a loop reactor, (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  (A) by itself affords polymer which is too high in Ml to give adequate melt strength for blowing film. Additionally, given its high Ml and narrow molecular weight distribution, (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  (A) provides a polymer with too much haze for many LLDPE film applications. Adding the second metallocene which produces higher molecular weight polymer provides a polymer with lower Ml, and hence, increased melt strength for blowing film, without sacrificing useful polymer film properties such as MC tear.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Ethylene Polymerization Using (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  and a More Highly-Substituted Zirconium Metallocene (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  (H)<br>
Polymerization runs using the first metallocene, (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  (A), the second, more highly-substituted metallocene, compound (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2 (H), as shown in Tables 7A and 7B, fluorided silica-alumina, and triethylaluminum were conducted using the methods as described herein. See Table 1 for metallocene solution preparation and Table 2 for catalyst feeds to the precontactor.<br>
Table 7 A illustrates the polymerization and reactor conditions for polyethylene prepared using a dual metallocene catalyst comprising compounds A + H, while Table 7B provides the resin and film properties for polyethylene prepared using the dual metallocene catalyst comprising compounds A + H. Thus, when (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2 (A) is combined with a more highly substituted metallocene, compound (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2 (H), specifically, a metallocene wherein the cyclopentadienyl-type ligand is more highly substituted, the resulting resin is characterized by a lower Ml as compared to using (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  alone, without substantially decreasing MD tear.<br>
EXAMPLE 11 Ethylene Polymerization Using (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  and its Hafnium Analog (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2 <br>
(I)<br>
Polymerization runs using the first metallocene, (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  (A), the second<br>
hafnium metallocene (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  (I) comprising substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands as shown in Table 8A and 8B, fluorided silica-alumina, and triethylaluminum were conducted using the methods as described herein. See Table 1 for metallocene solution preparation and Table 2 for catalyst feeds to the precontactor.<br>
Table 8A illustrates the polymerization and reactor conditions for polyethylene prepared using a dual metallocene catalyst comprising compounds A + I, while Table 8B provides the resin and film properties for polyethylene prepared using the dual metallocene catalyst comprising compounds A +1. Thus, when (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  (A) is combined with a hafnium metallocene (ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  (I), the resulting resin is characterized by a lower Ml as compared to uspng(ŋ5C5H4Bu)2ZrCl2  alone, without substantially decreasing MD tear.<br>
