				<td>A SEAT FRAME FOR USE WITH AN EXTRACORPOREAL<br>
HIGH INTENSITY FOCUS ULTRASONIC WAVE<br>
THERAPEUTIC APPARATUS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a means for use with a medical apparatus, especially to a seat frame which is mounted for a lower-mounted ultrasonic wave source of a high intensity focus ultrasonic wave (HIFU) therapeutic apparatus for treating the pathological tissues in the body parts like the pelvic cavity. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
At present, the existing extracorporeal HIFU therapeutic apparatus generally includes the following means: a HIFU source and a driving circuit thereof for providing the HIFU; a locating system for searching the object to be treated and moving it to the focal point of the ultrasound transducer, which includes a medical imaging system (such as the B-Mode Ultrasonoscope), a carrying device for carrying the patient such as a bed surface, and a displacement system for causing the spatial movement of the carrying device with respect to the ultrasonic wave source; a high intensity ultrasonic wave (HIU) transmitter and a processing system for transmission medium. Since the ultrasonic wave adapted to the HEFU must be transmitted into the patient body through a special transmission medium (such as deaerated water), a containing means for receiving the transmission medium ( such as a water tank etc.) in front of a emitting surface of a HIFU source and means for filling, discharging and processing the transmission medium are necessary.<br>
The high intensity ultrasonic wave (HIU) for therapy can not pass through some substance such as bones and air. All the existing extracorporeal HIFU therapeutic apparatus use the bed surface as a carrying device for patient and the patient is in a pronation pose when being treated. However, it is difficult for the HIU to reach an object to be treated from the front or the back of the patient due to the influence of the pelvic cavity on the diseased tissue in the rectum, prostate and unerine neck and $o on, so that the diseased tissues in those parts can not be treated.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages by providing a seat frame for use with an extracorporeal HIFU therapeutic apparatus, by which the patient can be in a sitting pose when being treated so that the the treatment range of the HIFU can be extended.<br>
In order to fulfill the above object, the present invention provides a seat frame for use with an extracorporeal HIFU therapeutic apparatus, wherein the HIFU therapeutic apparatus includes a HIFU source for providing HIFU; a carrying device for carrying the patient and a displacement system for causing the spatial movement of the carrying device for patient with respect to the HIFU source, A containing means for receiving the transmission medium is provided in front of an emitting surface of the HIFU source, said containing means for the transmission medium is an open-type water tank, and said seat frame includes a cushion which may be submerged in said open-type water tank. In the center of said cushion is provided an arrangement through which the power ultrasonic wave may passes, and the seat frame further includes a cushion supporting arrangement for supporting said cushion on said carrying device.<br>
The seat frame of the present invention can further includes the following features: said arrangement through which the power ultrasonic wave can pass is a center hole or a latex membrane, and said cushion is made of a softer and resilient material such as a foam plastic.<br>
Said cushion supporting arrangement includes a frame, said cushion is placed on a base plate made of a rigid material, the shape of said base plate corresponds to that of said cushion, and a hole corresponding to said arrangement of the cushion through which the ultrasonic wave can pass is formed in said base plate, said cushion supporting arrangemet further includes bearing plates provided on both sides of said cushion respectively, said bearing plate has one end connected to the base plate for cushion and the other end connected to said frame, so that the cushion supporting arrangement supports said cushion. One end of said bearing plate is connected to said<br><br>
base plate by a fastener, and the other end can also be connected to said frame by a fastemer.<br>
Further, said cushion supporting arrangement includes a backrest and an armrest connected to said frame.<br>
In use, said seat frame is mounted above said open-type water tank which is above the lower-mounted HIFU source. When said water tank is full of deaerated water, the water level will exceed the cushion of said seat frame, that is, said cushion will be submerged in the water. The patient sits on the seat frame when being treated and the perineum skin sufficiently contact the deaerated water. The ultrasonic wave will pass through said arrangement through which the power ultrasonic wave may pass and through the perineum, and then enter into the body so as to reach the parts like the rectum, prostate and unerine neck and so on so that the the pathological tissues in the body parts like pelvic cavity can be treated externally. Thus, the HIFU therapeutic apparatus allows the patient being treated in a sitting pose so as to treat the rectal cancer in situ, Mile's partial relapse of rectal cancer, prostatic cancer, cervical carcinoma, carcinoma of vagina and prostatic hyperplasia and so on, which extends the treatment range of the HIFU-BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
