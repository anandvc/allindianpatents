				<td>METHOD OF INCREASING DRUG ORAL BIO AVAILABILITY AND COMPOSITIONS OJ? LESS TOXIC OROTATE SALTS<br>
1. FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the method of increasing the oral bioavailability of pharmaceutical agents that are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and to methods of improved treatment of patients through the oral administration of such agents. In particular, the invention relates to poorly absorbed pharmaceutical drugs and converting them to orotate salts to enhance the drugs' oral bioavailability. Thus, the orotate salts of the drugs can be dosed at lower doses to provide the efficacy benefits of a higher dose, while reducing the drugs' toxic effects at lower doses and reduce acute and delayed-phase chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Additionally, the orotate salts have a higher clearance rate, i.e., the fraction of the drug escaping first pass metabolism is increased. Therefore, an especially useful formulation of the orotate salt of the pharmaceutical agent can provide rapid onset and consistent action using a lower dose and<br>
reduce drug interactions and side-effects because of consistent delivery.<br><br>
2. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Many pharmacologically active agents cannot be effectively administered by the oral route because of poor systemic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract Therefore, these agents ate generally administered via the intravenous or intramuscular routes. This requires hospitalization or care by a health professional, entailing discomfort, potential trauma to the patient and even added cost Other pharmacologically active agents may be administered by the oral route, but a combination of poor absorption and/or rapid breakdown during the first<br><br>
pass through the liver, requires large and toxic doses to achieve therapeutic concentrations systemically.<br>
Methods disclosed in the art for increasing gut absorption of drugs focus on the use of solubility and permeation enhancers as promoting agents. But the above methods suffer from numerous drawbacks. The solubility and permeability enhancers are often ineffective for oral administration in the doses required and may interfere with pharmacological activity of the target drug. Some even cause clinical consequences, for example, intravenous administration of quinidine may cause arrhythmias, peripheral vasodilation, upset gastrointestinal function and the like.<br>
Difficulties continue to exist in delivery systems for water-insoluble pharmaceutical agents despite tihe development of techniques using lipid vesicles and oil-in-water type of emulsions. However, these formulations require presence of solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide or polyethylene glycol that cause physical instability in the formulation. Ogawa et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,004,756; Tabibi et ai., U.S. Patent No 5,039,527; and Carter, U.S. Patent No 5,461,037.<br>
U.S. Patent No 6,838,090 claims a vesicular drug delivery system which comprises a drug solution comprising a water-insoluble drug, dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable water miscible organic solvent, and a surfactant suspension comprising water and 0.5% to 10% (w/v) of a surfactant wherein the surfactant forms vesicles having an average particle size from 50nm to 200nm, wherein the drug solution and surfactant suspension are stored and transported separately, and combined prior to use. The water-insoluble drugs included antihypertension drugs, antibiotics, anticancer or antitumor drugs, and specifically selected from the group consisting of 17-allylaminogeldanamycin and carboxyamidotriazole (CAI).<br>
The water-miscible organic solvent was selected from the group consisting of dimethyl fonnamide, ethanol, glycerine, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethyl acetamide.<br>
With the advent of nanotechnology, drug delivery systems have improved but the side<br>
effects and toxicity profiles of the drugs have remained unchanged.<br>
i<br>
It is well known that a series of membrane-bound P-glycoproteins function as energy-dependent transpqrt or efflux pumps to prevent certain pharmaceutical compounds from traversing the mucosal cells of the small intestine and, therefore from being absorbed into the systemic circulation. A number of non-cytotoxic pharmacological agents have been shown to inhibit P-glycoprotein, including cyclosporine, verapamil, tamoxifen, quinidine and phenothiazines, among others. Many of these studies were conducted to achieve greater accumulation of cytotoxic drugs inside tumor cells, for example, the effects of cyclosporine were studied on the pharmacokinetics and toxicities of paclitaxel, doxorabiciaand etoposide (Sugiyama et al Biochem Biophys Acta 1653:47-59 (2003); Malingre et al., J. Clin Oncol 19: 1160-1166 (2001)). All of these drugs are anti-cancer agents known to be subject to multidrug resistance (MDR). These studies indicated that concomitant administration of cyclosporine suppressed the MDR action of P-glycoprotein and resulted in larger intracellular accumulations of the therapeutic agents.<br>
Another approach taken to modulate the pharmacological profile of a drug is to inhibit or prevent its metabolism. Carboxyamidotraiazole (CAI) is a novel neoplastic agent in clinical development with limited oral bioavailabiliry (Bauer et al, Clinical Cancer Research 5:2324-2329, (1999). Since in vitro, ketoconazole has been demonstrated to inhibit CYP3A4 mediated metabolism of CAI, a phase I trial in forty seven patients was undertaken in which CAI and ketoconazole were co-administered. There was an increase in the area under curve (AUC) and Cmax with a decrease in CAI clearance compared to the control. However, the<br>
toxicity profile of CAJ was not altered (Desai et al, Cancer Chemotherapy Pharmacology 54: 377-384, (2004).<br>
Carboxyamidotriazole (CAI) is currently under development for clinical use as an antitumor agent based on its antiangiogenic, antiproliferative and antimetastatic effects Kohn et al Cancer Res 52: 3208-3212, (1992); Bauer et al J. Pharm Exp Ther 292: 31-37 (2000) and Purow et al, Cancer Investigation 22: 577-587, (2004).<br>
U.S. Patent No.5,861,406 issued on January 19,1999 and U.S. Pat No 5,912,346<br>
i<br>
issued on July 15,1999, describe treatment and prevention of neoplasms with salts of aminoimizazole carboxamide and CAI triazole, Specifically, an orotate salt of CAI compared with CAI, was found to have improved antitumor effect in the Dunning rat model for prostate cancer.  The mechanism of action for the enhancement in antitumor activity of CAJ orotate was not described but was suggested to involve an alteration in cyclic nucleotide activity in the liver.<br>
At most pharmaceutical companies, while many technologies such as combinatorial chemistry, nanotechnology, rapid analog synthesis, automated synthesis open access liquid chtomatography mass spectrometry, and high-speed automated Mgh-perfbrmance liquid<br>
chromatography are now affecting medicinal chemistry, their main effect has been to shorten<br>
/<br>
the cycle time of synthetic operations. One of the most difficult properties to build into a newly discovered lead molecule is the desired pharmacokinetic profile, particularly in the case of orally dosed compounds. "Most experienced medicinal chemists would prefer to start in a structural series that has inherently good pharmacokinetic properties, albeit with poor potency on the target receptor, and then set about improving the potency on the target, rather than working in the other direction", "Organic Chemistry in Drug Discovery, Drug Discovery", Science 303: 1810-1813 (2004) by Malcolm MacCoss and Thomas A. Baillie, Merck Research Laboraties, Rahway, NJ,<br>
The present invention describes novel effects of orotate salts of pharmaceutical agents including CAI, on oral bioavailability of the agent.  We have now, surprisingly found that oral administration of orotate salts of pharmaceutical agents, for example, CAI orotate, increases the bioavailability of charged CAI compared with the administration directly of the chemical equivalent of CAI. The CAI orotate salt has a better absorption profile which may be related to less side effects such as symptoms of emesis recorded, compared with CAI. These effects are expected to apply to other orotate salts of pharmaceutical agents in use.<br>
The present invention also demonstrates the advantage of administering a drug as an orotate salt on reducing the drug's toxicity. The orotate salts of pharmaceutical agents have better clearance, that is, the fraction of the drug escaping first pass metabolism is increased thus reducing the potential for hepatic toxicity. Therefore, the higher and more consistent bioavailability of a drug when administered as orotate salt of drug orally and/or intravenously, improves the effectiveness and also attenuates the potential effects of any drug side effects and interactions. Medicinal chemists and organic chemists have heretofore, overlooked the unique design of drugs of the present invention.<br>

5. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the method of increasing the oral bioavailability of pharmaceutical agents that are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and to methods of improved treatment of patients through the oral administration of such agents. In particular, the invention relates to poorly absorbed pharmaceutical drugs and converting them to orotate salts to enhance the drugs' oral bioavailability. Thus, the orotate salts of the drugs can be dosed at lower doses to provide the efficacy benefits of a higher dose, while reducing the drugs' toxic effects at lower doses. Additionally, the orotate salts of pharmaceutical agents have better clearance, that is, the fraction of the drug escaping first pass metabolism is increased, thus reducing the potential for hepatic toxicity. Therefore, an<br>
especially useful formulation of the orotate salt of the pharmaceutical agent can provide rapid onset and consistent action using a lower dose and reduce drug interactions and side-effects because of consistent delivery. The present invention provides methods to synthesize orotate salts of water-insoluble drugs having an ionizable center, to improve the drugs' oral bioavailability and efficacy.<br>
The absorption of drugs via the oral route is a subject of intense investigation in the pharmaceutical industry since good bioavailability implies that the drug is able to reach the systemic circulation by mouth. Oral absorption is affected by both lie drug properties and<br>
I<br>
the physiology of the gastrointestinal tract, including drug dissolution from the dosage form, the manner in which the drug interacts with the aqueous environment and membrane, permeation across the membrane, and irreversible removal by first-pass organs such as the intestine, liver and lung. Some pharmaceutical agents that exhibit low-solubility show poor bioavailability or irregular absorption, the degree of irregularity being affected by factors such as dose level, fed state of the patient, and physicochemical properties of the drug.<br>
The majority of drug absorption occurs at the small intestine because of the large surface area since the presence of the villi and microvilli increases the absorptive area manifold. The duodenum and jejunum possess the greatest surface areas due to the highest concentration of villi and microvilli in these regions compared with that of the ileum. The<br>
i<br>
circulation of the intestine is unique in that the intestine is the anterior or portal tissue that regulates the flow of substrates to the liver. The intestinal venous blood constitutes about 75% of the blood supply to the liver. Therefore, for drugs that are highly cleared by the intestine, the contribution of the liver, kidney or lung to drug metabolism will become reduced. Conversely, for drugs that are poorly extracted by .the intestine, the substrate is able to reach the next organs, the liver and the rung for removal. Therefore, the concentration of drug entering the intestine and the intestinal flow rate alter the rate of drug delivery and affect<br>
tiie rates of intestinal and clearance through hepatic first-pass metabolism. Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of the disposition of a drug after oral administration.<br>
" Drug bioavailability" is defined here as the amount of drug systemically available over time. The present invention increases drug bioavailability of pharmaceutical agents by converting them into orotate salts. This may be achieved by altering the bydrophilic and lipophilic properties of the drug so that the drug permeates the membrane well and blood perrusion rate becomes the overall rate-limiting step for absorption, or by inhibiting drug biotransformation in the gut and/or by inhibiting active back transport systems in the gut mat decrease the net transport of drugs across the gut membrane into the blood stream. In either case, the composition responsible for increased drug bioavailability is the orotate salt of the pharmaceutical agent. For reasons that are not immediately apparent, it has been discovered that conversion of a water -insoluble pharmaceutical agent into an orotate salts provides a method for increasing the bioavailability of an orally administered pharmaceutical agent to a mammal in need of treatment in sufficient amount to provided integrated systemic concentrations over time of the orotate agent over the agent without conversion to an orotate salt<br>
Changes in the integrated systemic concentrations overtime are indicated by area under the curve (AUC) or C ma, both parameters well known in the art, AUC is a<br>
i<br>
determination of me Area Under the Curve plotting the serum or plasma concentration of drug along the ordinate (Y-axis) against time along the abscissa (X-axis). Generally, the values for me AUC represent drug concentrations over time in units of mass Hime/vokime. When efficacy of the orotate salt of the agent is being measured, the amount and form of the active drug administered should be the same in both the administration of the drugs as orotate and the administration of the drug alone.<br>
The present invention provides methods wherein a composition provides an increase<br>
in bioavailability of the orotate salt of the pharmaceutical agent as measured by AUC of at least 25% relative to dosing of the pharmaceutical agent The present invention also provides methods wherein the composition provides an increase in faioavailability of the orotate salt of me pharmaceutical agent as measured by AUC of at least 50% relative to dosing of the pharmaceutical agent. The present invention further provides methods wherein said composition provides an increase in bioavailability of the orotate salt of the pharmaceutical agent as measured by AUC of at least 100% relative to dosing of the pharmaceutical agent The invention provides a composition that increases the bioavailability of the orotate salt of the pharmaceutical agent as measured by Cmax of at least 50% relative to dosing of the pharmaceutical agent. The invention also provides said composition that increases the bioavailability of the orotate salt of the pharmaceutical agent as measured by Cmax of at least 100% relative to dosing of the pharmaceutical agent. The invention further provides said composition which provides an increase m bioavailability of the orotate salt of the pharmaceutical agent as measured by Cmax of at least 200% relative to dosing of the pharmaceutical agent Systemic drug concentrations are measured using standard biochemical drug measurement techniques (Simmons et al., Anal Lett. 39:2009-2021 (1997).<br>
Characteristics of Drugs Used as Orotate Salts<br>
The word "drag" as used herein is defined as a chemical intended for use in the treatment or prevention of disease. Drugs include synthetic and naturally occurring bioaffecting substances as well as recognized Pharmaceuticals, such as those listed in "The Physician desk Reference, " 56th ed, pages 101-133 (or an updated edition). These references are incorporated by reference herein. The term "drug" also includes compounds that have the indicated properties that are not discovered or available. The present invention can be used with drugs consisting of charged, uncharged, hydrophilic, zwitter-ionic, or<br>
hydrophobia species, as well as any combinations of these physical characteristics. A hydrophobic drug is defined as a drug which in its non-ionized form is more soluble in lipid or fat than in water. A preferred class of hydrophobic drugs is those drugs that are more soiuble in octanol than in water.<br>
Compounds or drugs from a number of classes of compounds can be converted to orotate salts and administered orally as orotate salts. The compound or drug can be for example, but is not limited to the following classes: acetanilide, adriamycin, aminoacridine, aminoimidazole, aminoquinoline, am'Iide, anthracycline antibiotic, antestrogen, benzazepine, benzhydryl compound, bezodiazpine, benzofuran, cannabinoid, cephalosporme, cisplatin,<br>
/<br>
colchicines, cyclic peptide, cyclophosphamide, dibenzazepine, digitalis glycoside, dihydropyridine, doxorubicin, epiphodophyilotoxin, epzrubicin, ergeline, ergot alkaloid, fluorouracil, imidazole, isoquinoline, macrolide, medaotrexatef mitomycin, naphthalene, nitrogen mustard, opioid, oxazune, oxazole, paclitaxel, phenothiazine, phenylalkanaine, phenylpiperidine, piperazine, piperidine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, pyridine, pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrrolidine, pyrrolidinone, quinazoline, quinoline, quinine, rauwolfa aalkaloid, retinoid, salicylate, steroid, stilbene, sulfone, sulfonylurea, tamoxifen, taxol, taxotere, triazole, tropane, vincristine or vinca alkaloid,<br>
Bioavaiiability of a drug following oral dosing is the extent to which or rate at which the active moiety of the drug or metabolite enters systemic circulation, thereby gaining access<br>
/<br>
to the site of action. The physiochemical properties of a drug govern its absorptive potential, but the properties of the dosage form which partly depend on its design and manufacture, can largely determine drug bioavailability. Differences in bioavailability among formulations of a given drug can have clinical significance. The concept of equivalence among drug products is important in making clinical decisions.<br>
"Chemical equivalence" refers to drug products that contain the same compound in<br>
the same amount and that meet current official standards. However, inactive ingredients in drug products may differ.<br>
"Bioequivalence" refers to chemical equivalents that, when administered to the same person in the same dosage regimen, result in equivalent concentrations of drug in blood and tissues.<br>
"Therapeutic equivalence" refers to drug products that, when administered to the same person in the same dosage regimen, provide essentially the same therapeutic effect or toxicity. Bioequivalent products are expected to be therapeutically equivalent Sometimes therapeutic equivalence may be achieved despite differences in bioavailability, for example when the therapeutic index is wide (ratio of maximum tolerated dose to the minimum effective dose).<br>
"Absorption" rate is important because even when a drug is absorbed completely, it may be absorbed too slowly to produce a therapeutic blood level quickly enough or so rapidly that toxicity results from high drug concentrations given to achieve the therapeutic level after each dose.<br>
"Clearance" of drug occurs by perfusion of blood to the organs of extraction. "Extraction" refers to the proportion of drug presented to the organ which is removed irreversibly (excreted) or altered to a different chemical form (metabolism). Clearance (CL) is therefore calculated as the product of the flow of blodd through the organ and proportion of<br>
i<br>
the drug extracted by the organ. Fig. 2 is a schematic illustrating the interplay of hepatic and renal clearance.<br>
Clearance of drug normally occurs from the liver and kidneys and it is assumed that only free and not protein bound, drug is available for clearance. For hepatic clearance, passive diffusion through the lipid core of the hepatocyte membranes, available to lipopbilic drugs, is augmented by sinusoidal carrier systems particularly for ionized molecules (anionic<br>
and cationic) of molecular weights of above 400. Likewise other transporters on the canalicular face transport drugs or their metabolites into bile. This system has two separate processes, hepatic uptake and billiary excretion. With small sized lipophilic drugs that readily traverse membranes hepatic uptake is not a major factor, but with higher molecular weight compounds (above 500) and those containing considerable H-bonding hepatic uptake can become the key clearance process, even if metabolism occurs subsequent to this. Administration of ketoconazole, a potent cytochrome p450 inhibitor decreases the metabolism of some compounds, for example CAI. Desai AA et al, Cancer Chemotherapy Pharmacol 54: 377-384,2004.  Ketoconazole was reported to increase the bioavailability of CAI but failed to change the toxicity associate with CAI.<br>

The present invention a composition that increases clearance of the orotate salt of the<br>
pharmaceutical agent as measured by pharmacokinetic studies in of at least 50% relative to<br>
/ dosing of the pharmaceutical agent It also provides a composition that increases in clearance<br>
of the orotate salt of the pharmaceutical agent as measured by pharmacokinetic studies of at least 100% relative to dosing of the pharmaceutical agent. It further provides said composition that increases inclearance of the orotate salt of the pharmaceutical agent as measured by pharmacokinetic studies of at least 200% relative to dosing of the pharmaceutical agent.<br><br>
Causes of Low BioavailabjlitY<br>
When a drug rapidly dissolves and readily crosses the intestinal membranes, absorption tends to be complete, but absorption of orally administered drugs is not always complete. Before reaching the vena cava, a drug must move down the gastrointestinal tract and pass through the gut wall and liver, common sites of drug metabolism. Thus a drag may be metabolized during first-pass metabolism before it can be measured in the systemic circulation. Many drugs have low oral bioavailability because of expensive first-pass metabolism.<br>
Low bioavailability is most common with oral dosage forms of poorly water-soluble,<br>
/<br>
slowly absorbed drugs. More factors can affect bioavailability when absorption is slow or incomplete than when it is rapid and complete. That is, slow or incomplete absorption leads to variable therapeutic responses. Slow absorption in the gastrointestinal tract also leads to increased acute and delayed-phase chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting.<br>
Insufficient time in the gastrointestinal tract is a common cause of low bioavailability. Ingested drag is exposed to the entire gastrointestinal tract for no more than one to two days and to the small intestine for only 2 to 4 hours. If the drug does not dissolve readily or cannot penetrate the epithelial membrane (e.g., if it is highly ionized and polar), time at the absorption site may be insufficient In such cases, bioavailability tends to be highly variable as well as low. Age, sex, activity, genetic phenotype, stress, disease or previous<br>
i<br>
gastrointestinal surgery can affect drug bioavailability.<br>
Reactions that compete with absorption can reduce bioavailability. They include complex formation, hydrolysis by gastric acid or digestive enzymes, conjugation in the gut wall, absorption of other drugs and metabolism by luminal micro flora.<br>
Assessment of bioavailability from plasma concentration-time data usually involves determining maximum peak concentration, the time at which maximum peak plasma drug<br><br>
concentration occurs, and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), The plasma drug concentration increases with the extent of absorption. The peak is reached when the drug elimination rate equals absorption rate. AUC is the most reliable measure of bioavailability. It is directly proportional to the total amount of unchanged drug that reaches me systemic circulation.<br>
Drug products may be considered bioequivalent in extent and rate of absorption if their plasma level curves are essentially super imposable. Drug products that have similar AUCs but differently shaped plasma level curves are equivalent in extent but differ in their absorption rate-time profiles,<br>
/<br>
Absorption occurs by one of three methods, either passive diffusion, active transport or facilitated active transport. Passive diffusion is simply the passage of molecules across the mucosal barrier until the concentration of molecules reaches osmotic balance on both sides of the membrane. In active transport the molecule is actively pumped across the mucosa. In facilitated transport, a carrier generally a protein, is required to convey the molecule across the membrane for absorption.<br>
Methods of Enhancing Effectiveness and Reducing Side ffffects of an Agent bv<br>
The present invention describes the method of increasing the oral bioavailability of pharmaceutical agents that are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract by converting them into orotate salts. The invention also describes improved effectiveness "of CAI orotate in inhibiting tumor growth compared with CAI given directly. The invention describes increased clearance of the drug as an orotate salt than when given directly. Thus, the orotate salts of the drugs can be dosed at lower doses to provide the efficacy benefits of a higher dose, while reducing the drugs' toxic effects at lower doses and reduce acute and delayed-phase chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Therefore, an especially useful<br>
formulation of the orotate salt of the pharmaceutical agent can provide rapid onset and consistent action using a lower dose and reduce drug interactions and side-effects because of consistent delivery.<br>
Orotic acid, a free pyrimidine is important in the synthesis of uridylate (UPP) a major pyrimidine nucleotide. Pyrimidines play a central role in cellular regulation and metabolism They are substrates for DNA/RNA biosynthesis, regulators of the biosynthesis of some amino acids, and cofactors in the biosynthesis of phospholipids, glycoiipids, sugars and polysaccharides. The classical de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway ends with the sysnthesis of UMP. Biochemistry, ed Lubert Stryer, ed, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co NY, 4th ed,<br>

739-762 (1995). It has also been reported that 5-Fluorouracil is toxic to the liver, as measured by incorporation in the acid soluble fraction, UNA and DNA in normal tissues in the liver of rats. Orotic acid administration decreased the incorporation into the liver and intestinal RNA, thus suggesting that it reduces 5-FU induced toxicity in the liver. El Hag IA et al, In vivo 1: 309-312 (1987). Figure 3 describes the formula for Orotic acid and CAI orotate.  The present invention provides drug orotate salts that under go dissolution to release the drug as a charged molecule and free orotic acid, which in turn reduces drug-induced liver toxicity.<br>

6. EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1.<br>
Chemical Synthesis of CAI Orgtate<br>
Fig. 3 depicts the formula for CAI orotate. The orotate salt was prepared using the procedure described in U.S.Pat No 5,861,406, with the reaction solution of water/methanol (1:4 volume) replaced by N,N-dimethyl acetamide. 2 grams of CAI and 0.87 grams of orotic acid were added in N,N-dimethy acetamide and heated to boiling for 15 mins. The resulting solution was filtered . A white precipitate was formed upon cooling and drying. The molecular weight of CAI is 425. The molecular weight of CAI orotate is 581. Example 2 Pharmacokinetic Assay for Evaluation of Oral Absorption and Bioavailabilfv of CAI Orotate<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats were fasted overnight then dosed by oral gavage at CAI lOOmg/kg and CAI orotate 137mg/kg body weight. Blood samples were collected into tubes containing EDTA at various intervals including 30 mi'n, Ihr, 2,4,16 and 48 hrs . The plasma was separated and analyzed for CAI. PK data analysis was carried out using PK SolutionsPharmakokinetic Software Ihc, Montrose CO.<br>
Data are shown in Fig. 4. The purpose of the present study was to compare the phannacokinetic profiles of CAI and CAI orotate. CAI showed a PK profile similar to that previously reported with a half life of approximately 19 hours and a Tmax of about 16 hrs.<br>
/<br>
The CAI salt has a plasma half life of about 18 hrs . While the Tmax was similar for both compounds (16hrs) the Cmax was nearly double for CAI orotate. Higher plasma concentration appeared earlier in the plasma for the CAI orotate compared to CAI. Area under curve (AUC) was higher for CAI orotate and these data together suggest that CAI orotate is getting through the gastrointestinal tract more faster than CAI.<br>
Example 3<br>
Increasing the Therapeutic Efficacy of an Agent by Conversion to Orotate Salt.<br>
The purpose of the experiment was to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of CAI and CAI orotate against subcutaneousiy implanted LOXIMVI human melanoma xenografts in female araymic NCr-nu mice.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the results. Results obtained indicate that LOXIMVI human melanoma xenografts are sensitive to the treatment of cyclophosphamide- a control drug used to compare CAI and CAI orotate.  Results obtained show that oral administration of CAI<br>
i<br>
orotate once daily for 14 days at a dosage of 205 mg/kg/dose resulted in inhibition of the<br>
growth of the implanted LOX IMVI human melanoma xenografts significantly (p-0.0487)<br>
compared to the CAI treated group.<br>
Example 4<br>
Reducing the Side Effects of an Agent by Conversion to Orotate Salt<br>
CAI and CAI orotate were evaluated compared with Cisplatin induced emesis in the ferret. The ferret is very sensitive to emetic agents. The emetic effect of cytotoxic agents such as cisplatin /doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide can be shown in the ferret. CAI, CAI orotate and cisplatin were studied in ferrets according to the procedure described in Oncology 53: Suppl 1:8-17, (1996). Results obtained indicate that neither CAI or CAI orotate appeared to have acute toxic effects that were seen in dogs for CAI. The ferrets tolerated a dose of 250mg/kg CAI or 343 mg/kg PO with no obvious effects other than mild retching over a 5 hour observation period. CAI orotate appeared to have less potential for producing pre-emetic behavior and retching than CAI.<br>
Example 5. General Example<br>
A number of drags have very low aqueous solubility, mainly due to very high lipophilicity, but also due to lack of ionizable centres. These drugs are erratically and incompletely absorbed due to their inability to dissolve in the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration, for example, ketoconozaole, phenytoin and tiramterene. Poor dissolution is responsible for both intra- and inter-patient variability in drag absorption and therefore presents a major problem in drug design. However, for such drugs, if the drug has an ionizable centre then solubility can be improved by salt formation.<br>
For example, Fig. 6 shows some lead compounds currently in use that are suitable to convert to orotate salts to improve their oral bioavailabilrty including but not limited to, doxorubicin and methotrexate.<br>
