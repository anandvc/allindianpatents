The present invention relates to a novel pharmaceutical composition for treating and saving the wounded, and to a method for the preparation thereof<br>
Nowadays blood transfusion and fluid infiision are the important measures to treat and save the wounded, especially the traumatic shock. Usually, the principle of transfusion is "to infuse component the patient is deficient in, to supply how much the patient needs". For example, when the patient mainly lost his blood, he should be transfused with blood, even though sometimes the patient needs to be transfused with blood from normal individuals. When the patient mainly lost plasma, plasma or plasma volume expander should be transflised to him; when the patient mainly lost intercellular fluid, physiological saline should be infused. In fact, the treating and saving measures of formulating physiological solutions on the basis of normal composition of body, or transfusing with blood from normal individuals to the patient with evident physiopatho logical changes is to treat the organism as mechanical device, therefore these measures often have following disadvantages:<br>
(1)	Blood transfusion: In general, the volume of blood transfusion closes to or exceeds the volume of blood lost. If a big amount of blood is required, the blood source will be difficuh, the cost is expensive. The preparation and storage need certain conditions. In addition, before transfusion, some time should be taken for blood typing and cross match tests, and only the substitutes could be used for the individuals with rare blood types. Blood transfusion could result in production of anti-platelet antibodies and anti-leucocyte antibodies, as well as various hematogenic infectious diseases, for example, AIDS, hepatitis B, hepatitis C. etc.<br>
(2)	Albumin infusion: There is a great demand, a great expense difficult source, complicated preparation method and certain requirements for, the method storage. After albumin infusion, it could effuse through capillaries, and couldn't be<br><br>
reabsorbed into vessel. Therefore interstitial edema will occur, and might result in pulmonary edema, renal failure, and cardiac insufficiency, by contrast enhance the mortality. Albumin infusion could result in evident decrease of a i, Q 2, &amp; , V -globulins and fibrinogen, cause reduction of immunity, and affect function of blood coagulation.<br>
(3)	Infiision of fluorocarbon as plasma substitute: It requires a large amount of the substitute and simultaneous inhalation of oxygen with high component pressure. Otherwise the demand of the organism is not met. The fluorocarbon as plasma substitute should be preserved in low temperature, and its transport is not convenient. For example, tiiirty minutes before infusion the patient should be injected with 10 mg of dexamethasone. The frozen injection for infusion should be thawed. Thus, the procedures are complicated. After infusion, the observation should be continued for 5 — lOmin. The infusion of fluorocarbon as plasma substitute could induce adverse reactions, such as anaphylaxis, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, reduction of immunity, and abnormality of fibrinolysis system.<br>
(4)	Infusion of balanced buffers, Its amount infiased should be three times more than the volume of blood lost to maintain the blood pressure. 60--80% the solution infused could efluse out of the blood vessel, which results in tissue edema (for example, cerebral edema, pulmonary edema) and renal insufficiency, it could cause the difficulty for sequential therapy.<br>
(5)	Infiasion of physiological saline. Its amount infused should also be three times more than the volume of blood lost. Its efficacy is poorer than balanced buffers, and its adverse effects are more significant.<br>
To solve the problems in blood transfiasion and infusion, the skilled in the art had studied anti-shock therapy with hypertonic sodium chloride solution. For example, 7. 5% (w/v) NaCl solution suggested by Velasco. But the hypertonic NaCl solution has some toxicity to the organism.<br>
Most investigators have proposed intravenous injection of hypertonic NaCl<br><br>
solution for anti-shock therapy, but it usually leads to obvious complications, such as hypotension, rupture of blood cells induced by extra hypertonic solution, cardiac insufficiency, decreased renal fiinction and disorders of nervous system.<br>
Thus, it can be showed that there is a demand for novel anti-shock drugs to reverse the physiopathological condition of shock, in order to obtain time for sequential therapy after the emergency treatment, and to create opportunity with improved effect of treating and saving the wounded and patients, and with increased survival rate.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition with convenient source, less dosage, rapid and better efficacy, less side effects, wider uses, and without restriction by blood type as well as without special storage condition.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide the method for the preparation of the said pharmaceutical composition.<br>
The present invention proposes a new concept of liquid therapy for shock, based on three aspects of thinking. The first aspect in connection with the present unreasonable dosage regimen, following principle is adopted: "to infuse what component the patient needs, then to infiase how much the patient needs". Based on the physiopathological status of the patient with shock, there is a prior demand for the compound solution containing hypertonic sodium ion (or combination of various crystals, or combination of various crystals and various colloids, etc. ) to preliminarily improve micro-circulation, tissue perfusion, and hemodynamics immediately. Then in the light of practical demand the isosmotic solution or proper hypoosmotic solution or whole blood or concentrated red blood cell suspension is administered, in order to permit the latter infused solution better action when the patient's condition has improved preliminarily by the earlier hypertonic solution, and to remit over-dehydration of some cells caused possibly by the hypertonic solution infiised earlier. The second aspect, in connection with the present unreasonable ratio of colloids and crystals in the transfusion for patient<br><br>
with shock prepared on basis of their normal physiological concentrations, in view of the fact that the property and volume--expanding ability of artificial colloids are different from albumin in blood, it is considered that the transfusion with suitable ratio of colloids and crystals, instead of human normal physiological proportion, should be administered on basis of the physiopathological status of patients. Thus medicine administration according to indications could reduce the dosage, increase the eificacy, and decrease the complications. The iJiird aspect, in connection with a lot of inadequacy in the present anti—shock experimental studies (such as animal model, reasonable concentration and infusion rate of hyperosmotic solutions), a great number of experimental studies have been conducted, and met with success.<br>
Based on the above three aspects of thinking form the theoretical researches and the clinical experiences, the. particular embodiments of the present invention have been completed through the animal experiments and the clinical practice.<br>

Test I: Animal Experiment<br>
From adult healthy hybrid dogs, regardless of sex, under local anesthesia, isolate femoral artery and femoral vein, then insert catheters respectively.<br>
The arterial duct is connected to CF—II model monitor of cardiovascular function [Shanghai approval document number: Hu—Yao- Qi~Jian (Zhun)~97—221103] to monitor cardiovascular status. Bleed these dogs to mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40—50 mmHg for a period of about 15 min. Maintain this blood pressure level for 1 hour, then infuse the product prepared in Example 1 at the dose of 8 ml/kg.<br>
Monitor the cardiovascular function and urine volume over 4 hours after infusion. In the following tables, the blood pressure and other indexes are expressed as percentage of their basal levels respectively, the unit of urine volume is ml/kg body weight/h.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Test 2. Human body clinical experiment<br>
The composition of the Example 1 of the invention was administered to 48 patients in Hefei No. 105 Hospital, Anhui province. The total effective rate was 100%. Most patients, had the blood pressure raised, urine volume increased, mid the limbs became warm during transfusion. Several patients whom the conventional drugs couldn't already reverse, the composition of the Example 1 of the invention begin to play its role 5- lOminutes after infusion. The circulatory fianction of patients has recovered basically, (and there were no obvious clinical complications.<br>
Test 3. Experiment of acute toxicity<br>
when dogs were given at 2.5 times the dosage for human, no adverse effects have been showed. At 5 times the recommended dosage, salivation and vomiting were seen in the dogs. At 3. 75 times the recommended dosage vomiting was seen without salivation in the dogs. All the above administered dogs survived more than 45 days. At 7. 5 times the recommended dosage the death occurred in the administered dogs, focal hemorrhage was seen in the lungs as target organs.<br>
The composition of the present invention could be infused through vein at the dose of 8 ml of the composition of the present invention per kg body weight. It could be used directly in treating and saving the patients with shock, combined injuries or hematorrhea etc in order, to reverse the physio—pathological status of patients and to obtain time for sequential treatment.<br>
As compared with the prior art, the pharmaceutical composition of this invention has the following prominent features and improvement:<br>
1. Greatly decreased volume of transfusion: In general, the dose for most patients is 500 ml or less than 500 ml. Even if the patients suffered from lethal hematorrhea, to infuse only 1/4 to 1/6 of volume of lost blood is enough. Thus, it could obviously decrease the incidence rate of tissue edema or overload of heart.<br>
2. Rapid curative effect just during 5-- 10 minutes after infusion, the hemodynamics has been improved significantly.<br><br>
3.	Good efficacy. As Test 1 showed the composition of the invention had better efficacy than that of equal volume of fresh whole blood. Moreover, although the composition of the invention has no oxygen- carrying action, but it could improve micro—circulation and general status to decrease oxygen consumption and to increase oxygen transport. Thus at least 50% of blood transfiised could be saved, it could mitigate the contradiction with short supply of blood, decrease the complications induced by blood transftision, and reduce obviously the economic burden for the patients.<br>
4.	Maintain once of efficacy for long time. As Test 1 showed, after intusion of the composition of the invention, the improvement of hemodynamics and general condition could be maintained more than 3—4 hours, even if all other infusion and drugs were not administered.<br>
5.	Unnecessary special condition for storage: The composition could be stored at room temperature, simply used inflised intravenously or intraosseously and conveniently transported, without special devices and special vehicles.<br>
6.	Unnecessary blood typing and cross match tests: It is suitable for<br>
individual with any blood type. Thus the valuable time could be gained to rescue<br>
the wounded and patients.<br>
7.	Wider uses: It could widely be used in the treatment of patients with shock of various types, brain trauma, bum, combined injuries, cardiogenic shock induced by myocardial infarction of right ventricle, hypotension mduced by hemodialysis, biliary pancreatitis, cardiovascular intoxication induced by narcotic, hepatic echinococcosis, and patients under operation.<br>
8.	Change of administration model: The composition of the invention could be infused drop by drop intravenously, instead of pushing so it could be conveniently used with less complications.<br>
In general, as compared with prior therapy, the composition of the present invention possesses unique benefit and theoretical innovation, for treating and saving the wounded and patients, so it is active significance.<br><br><br>
