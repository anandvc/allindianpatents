DOCTOR TOOTH CARE PRESSURE WARNING AND TALKING TOOTH BRUSH<br>
Field Of The Invention : This invention relates to the dental cleaning or guides teaches brushing our teeth and maintaining oral hygiene. This is a particularly new item this field, It is a mechanical and an electronic instrument, and combination of two instrument first one part "A" has a mechanical and electronic instrument is there with this while brushing our teeth when we apply high pressure on our teeth it will give continues beep sound, and when we apply low pressure on teeth it will give intermittent beep sound (a beep sound between gaps each beep) is given. If we apply correct pressure on our teeth there is no sound produce. And the part "B" of the tooth brush is a voice player. It plays a speech through voice from the ear phone. The speech is concerned with dental care and says how to brush each side of 16 sides teeth. This dental care mater is composed as 16 parts for 16 sides of teeth. At the beginning of each part of the speech Al, to PI it says about how to brush the teeth that side (Brushing techniques). A2 to P2 is the dental cares speech these dental care speech is composed in a sufficient time when we are completed brushing that side. This speech is called "hear while brushing". Children brush their teeth same time they hear dental care speech and learn brushing technique and also learn the problem and solution when they are not maintaining proper oral hygiene and also following pressure warning beep sound for applying correct pressure on teeth.<br>
There is also another "hear and Brush" speech is there which is for the children who having less hearing problems. Don't brush your teeth in both speeches while you hear brushing techniques Al to PI brush only while you hear dental care speech A2 to P2 or a gap of 20 seconds.<br>
State Of The Are In The Field : This instrument "Doctor tooth care pressure warning and talking tooth brush" that is invented by me is totally new to this field. The item which is closer to this invention is not existing in the world.<br>
Object of the invention (Problems and solutions): In general brushing our teeth needs some techniques because of lack of knowledge people usually brush their teeth in different styles of with Different pressures on teeth. Dental medicine says we should brush our teeth in a proper proven scientific way and applying correct pressure on teeth which helps to protect our teeth life long strong and healthy as nature intended. It is most common in people they can not apply<br><br>
correct pressure on their teeth. They are applying either high pressure or low pressure on the teeth. Both are harmful to the teeth. Apply correct pressure on the teeth is very important It will protection our teeth and gums clean and healthy life long.<br>
If we apply the tooth brush with less pressure on our teeth. While brushing, plaque and bacterial byproducts does not clean properly. Then by time being plaque hardened as tartar, irritation of gums begins, inflammation starts bleeding of gums happened untreated this condition gums recedes further destroy more bone teeth become loose and fall out Secondly a small tooth cavity forming on the teeth causing by micro-organism then it becomes tooth decay. It spreads rapidly into the softer dentin, then severe pain starts. Eventually decay destroys tooth pulp. Then tooth will loss with infection extended tooth surrounding bone.<br>
If you apply the brush with high pressure on our teeth while brushing teeth gums and enamel are worn, softer dentin under mines the enamel expose. Then the condition in which "sharp current like pain" is produced in response to stimuli like hot, cold, sour or physical contact which disappear when the stimuli is removed. This is called "Dental hyper sensitivity or tooth sensitivity" we should have to suffer this life long.<br>
So my invention "Doctor tooth care pressure warning and talking tooth brush" give warning you with a beep sound. When you apply tooth brush on teeth with low pressure it will give intermittent beep sound is produced through ear phones. If we apply brush with high pressure on teeth it will give continues beep sound through ear phones. It we apply the brush with correct pressure on teeth there is no sound is produced. So children using this tooth brush and practicing few months then they will learn how much pressure required to apply on teeth then they will become habituated to maintain correct pressure on teeth life long.<br>
For talking part "B" generally children took less care about their neatness and dental care. Even through their parents asked them to maintain oral hygiene, like applying correct pressure on teeth and do brushing all 16 sides of the teeth while brushing, But they do not listen their words. Because of their child hood negligence they do brushing only 4 or 6 sides and neglect to do brush all 16 sides. And they apply either high pressure or low pressure on teeth while brushing and not following brushing techniques because of lack of knowledge, then they are going to face dental problems in future and teeth loss.<br>
So it is most common in children, and in adults they are feeing general problems tartor gum inflammation bleeding gums, tooth decay ultimately teeth become loose falling out. Tooth decay is the problem collection of bacteria causes a painful dental decay loss of the teeth. And<br><br>
vigorous brushing made the teeth hypersensitivity and also total health loss due to unclean bacteria in our mouth entered into our body damaging different organs causing 70 types of deceases. Because of bad breath they have to face so many social and economical problems in the society.<br>
World health organization has found that there are 500 crore people in the world suffering with dental problems. In those most of them are elders because they were not brought up with maintaining oral hygiene from their child hood because of negligence and not knowing brushing techniques. "If you want to live long you should maintain dental and oral hygiene". These words are the accordance of W.H.0 global oral health program president Dr. Powel eric peaterson.<br>
So, I made this "Doctor tooth care pressure warning and talking tooth brush" the talking part of this speech was composed as 16 parts for 16 sides of the teeth. Each part contains Al brushing techniques A2 contains because of poor dental hygiene what problems that you have to face in your dental health and their solutions. This matter is clearly recorded in the electronic circuit board which is fixed in the tooth brush handle. These parts of speech is Al, A2 to P1,P2 is there. Al to P1 parts are the brushing techniques and tells how to brush each side of the teeth. A2 to P2 part are the differentproblems to have facing is told by tooth brush. When you are not maintaining proper dental hygiene. And their solutions also while hearing the speech the pressure warning system is also works the beep sounds also hear from the same ear phone.<br>
As per the children psychology a tooth brush talks about dental care is strange to them. If it gives more enthusiasm rather than their parents talking about it So, they must hear the speech from "Doctor tooth care pressure warning and talking tooth brush". Then these words enter in their minds strongly. Then they should follow according the tooth brush says. They learn new things about the dental care and it important by time being they are habituated to maintain oral hygiene from their child hood to entire life.<br>
It has already being proposed by using this "Doctor tooth care pressure warning and talking tooth brush" children will came out of the dental problem and maintaining oral and dental hygiene life long. "The principal object of the invention is, they should learn the importance of the oral hygiene. If they are not maintaining proper oral hygiene and dental health the loss of oral and total health, in their life and loss of teeth and so on and they also learn the importance of brushing all 16 sides and maintaining correct pressure on teeth through a strange manner in the way what they are interested enthusiastic, that is a tooth brush talks about it. "Doctor tooth care pressure warning and talking tooth brush" says then they will learn and<br><br>
practicing according to the tooth brush guides and brought up with learned and habituated person about dental care from childhood then their teeth and they total health will protected life long. "Another object of this invention is when they were learned problems of dental health simultaneously they also learned immediate solution they have to take, when they find any decease in their mouth or in the teeth then they will take immediate action to go to the doctor and take treatment from that disease. "A further object of this invention while brushing they teeth hear the warning beep sounds from the tooth brush when they are applying high or low pressure on the teeth and habituated to maintain correct pressure on their teeth. Hence the worn of enamel and dental hypersensitivity is prevented.<br>
Statement of the invention: This invention that is invented by me is totally new to this field. The item which is closer to this invention is not existing. According the invention provides an operators consisting of a mechanical and an electronically tooth brush titled "Doctor tooth care pressure warning and talking tooth brush" which is characterized in that of this invention is a combination of two instruments part "A" and part "B". Part "A" is the pressure warning tooth brush part "B" is the talking tooth brush. Which was joined together and made a single tooth brush that is "Doctor tooth care pressure warning and talking tooth brush" this instrument contains to handles back handle contains (main handle) all mechanical and electronic equipment like active components and passive components there is a mechanical (see-saw like a) instrument is there. It is the pressure warning tooth brush is fixed at the front portion of the main handle. The front handle is a bristle handle, the bristle handle has a detachable bristle head is there. The bristle handle back portion and main handle front portion are joined together in a box. The boxes left and right sides have two circular holes. The front bristle handle back side, 1 inch from the back a horizontal cylinder shape is there and the back from the cylinder 1 inch portion towards main handle is called Bar. These are molded in 1 piece. The cylinder of the bristle handle sets into the holes of the box when we pull up and bristle handle the bar come down. Then we pull down the bristle handle the bar goes up it acts as a see-saw where children plays in the part<br>
Inside of the box under the "Bar" there is a compressible and come to normal (are expanded) rubber piece or a spring is fixed. Top side of the bar there is a hard plastic is fixed that stops the "Bar" for not going too much up as we actually needed. Then the normal position of the bristle handle is approximately 45 . The back side of the bar there is a half circular shaped wall is<br><br>
there. On that wall 3 metal plates are fixed bar is covered which a movable cone shaped metal cup. Which is pushed by a metal spring which is fixed inside the bar. So the metal cup of the bar touches the 3 metal half circular plates. The spring in the "Bar" is connected with a wire to the point in the electronic assembled P.C.B. "W2" in the main handle. Other wire is connected to the top metal plate to the electronic assembled F.C.B, to a point "Wl" another wire is connected to the bottom metal plate and to the electronic assembled P.C.B. to a point "W3" in the main handle. The middle plate does not connect to P.C.B.<br>
In part "B" the electronic system of the assembled P.C.B. is fixed at the back main handle. In that all electronic IC's transistors, resisters, capacitors, batteries and so on are fixed. Top side of the main handle there is a uon/off' and "stop" play switches are there "previous and next" "record" "reset" switches are keep inside the box for recording "hear and brush speech" because the speeches are divided into two types while brushing avoid the brushing sound for poor hearing children. The both voice and beep sounds are producing in one ear phone we can make beep sounds separately by using buzzer operated circuits. Another speech is called hear while brushing there should possible I can also make only player tooth brush with pressure warning by using one chip capable of playing two speeches in one IC or hard disk MP3 or with any existing or better existing new coming technology. We can also divide or split this "Doctor tooth care pressure warning and talking tooth brush" into two tooth brushes one is "pressure warning tooth brush" and second tooth care "talking tooth brush" for pressure warning tooth brush we can either use buzzer circuit or ear phone circuit. We can also use pins under and top of the "Bar" for giving beep sound instead of metal plates, but the metal plates system is absorbs the high pressure when we are applying on teeth with the tooth brush, It acts like a shakeubsor in the vehicles.<br>
These speeches are classified into two types one is "hear while brushing" two is "hear and brush" both are same speeches hear while brush is composed in 16 paragraphs Al, A2<br>
	to P1, P2. While hearing A2 to P2 each paragraph is completed in few seconds at<br>
that time we should complete brushing that side than change to next side of the teeth. There are another 16 paragraph speech Al to P1 which is in front of A2, P2 it say how to brush each side of 16 sides and tells brushing techniques. Remember don't brush by hearing Al to P1 for(2) type of speech and for hear and brush Al, A2 +20 seconds gape is given for brushing like up to P1, P2+20 seconds.<br>
The invention "Doctor tooth care pressure warning and talking tooth brush" can run by<br><br>
battery 9 volts or by D.C. adopter. To Jacks are there for ear phone and D.C. adopter it is completely water proof and detachable bristle head facility is also there it has on/off switch, vacuum cups for Jacks and ear phones are there. "There is also providing a method performing that is when the person starts brushing on the this tooth brush. The bristle handle moves up and down according to the pressure he is applying on teeth. If we apply less pressure on teeth the "Bar" metal cup touches the top metal plate. Then the "W2" of bar wire connection contact "Wl" of metal plate at the electronic assembled P.C.B. Then gives intermittent beep sound (Bee-Bee sound between gape) if he apply high pressure on teeth the bar goes down then the bar metal cup point "W2" connected to the bottom metal plate point "W3" than the electronic assembled P.C.B. gives continues beep sound, at the same time electronic assembled P.C.B. voice player plays tooth care speech both were hearing one ear phone or head phones. Children follow the speech of how to brushing that side of teeth Al to P1 and hear dental problem solution A2 to P2 and by time being they are practicing of doing brushing of 16 sides of teeth and get knowledge about dental care and also practiced to maintain correct pressure on teeth by the help of beep sounds given by the tooth brush.<br>
The speeches are as follows Hear while brushing<br>
Good morning children. Now you are starting this day morning by doing most important work. That is brush your teeth. To maintain oral hygiene as well as good health, brush your teeth on all 16 sides and cleaning your mouth is very important Keep the past on the bristles and tap the brush back on your hand until the past reaches bottom of the bristles.<br>
Al-	Bass method: Now start brushing beginning at the most distant tooth of upper right<br>
outside teeth. Place the head of the soft tooth brush covering with 3-4 teeth place the bristles at the gum margin at an angle of 45° exert gentle vibratory pressure using short back and forth motion. Complete approximately 20 strokes buy covering entire tooth surface always paying special attention to the areas where the tooth and gum meet Complete that side by changing the brush to the next three teeth.<br>
A2-	Mouth is the first entrance of our body anything we eat, so it is generally place of<br><br>
bacteria hide and growth. Because of poor dental hygiene, these bacteria combines with sugars present in food particles to produce acids which attack and harm your teeth and also enter your body and damage different organs like heart, lungs, kidneys and so on and causes 70 types of diseases. So brush your teeth in the morning and at night while going to the bed.<br>

Complete approximately 20 strokes buy covering entire tooth surface always paying special attention to the areas where the tooth and gum meet. Complete that side by changing the brush to the next three teeth.<br>
B2-	There are few brushing techniques we should learn. At present we are using bass<br>
method. The modified still men method; In this method brush is placed with the bristle ends resting partly on the teeth and partly on the gums at an oblique angle pointing towards root. Give 20 back and forth strokes simultaneously moving towards the crown. In charter method, brush on the teeth in a circular motion. Inside of front teeth and biting teeth are same in all methods.<br>
CI -	Place the head of the soft tooth brush covering with 3-4 teeth place the bristles at the<br>
gum margin at an angle of 45°, at upper left outside teeth, covering 3-4 teeth. Exert gentle vibratory pressure using short back and forth motion. Complete approximately 20 strokes buy covering entire tooth surface always paying special attention to the areas where the tooth and gum meet. Complete that side by changing the brush to the next three teeth.<br>
C2-	Remember vigorous brushing with high pressure usually in horizontal direction will<br>
damage your gums, enamel and the teeth. The gum joints become worn while dentin exposed. When you eat hot, cold, sour, or physical contact a sharp current like pain is produced. This is called tooth sensitivity or dental hyper sensitivity; we should bear this pain life long. So apply correct pressure on your teeth while brushing is important and use only soft tooth paste and powder.<br>
Dl-	Place the head of the soft tooth brush covering with 3-4 teeth place the bristles at the<br><br>

Complete approximately 20 strokes buy covering entire tooth surface always paying special attention to the areas where the tooth and gum meet Complete that side by changing the brush to the next three teeth.<br>
D2-	If you are applying and not doing brushing on all 16 sides of the teeth plaque<br>
collected on and around the teeth than inflammation of the gums starts, making them swollen and bleeding. With out dental treatment plaque hardened into tartar detached gum beginnings to recede pockets from between the teeth and gums without treatment destroying more bone and periodontal ligament teeth become loosen and falling out.<br>
El-Place the head of the soft tooth brush covering with 3-4 teeth place the bristles at the gum margin at an angle of 45°of upper left inside teeth. Exert gentle vibratory pressure using short back and forth motion. Complete approximately 20 strokes buy covering entire tooth surface always paying special attention to the areas where the tooth and gum meet. Complete that side by changing the brush to the next three teeth.<br>
E2-Visit your dentist once in six months and get your teeth proficiently scaling. Our teeth are firmly held together by supporting structure such as gum and bone. Poor dental hygiene result in deposition of plaque which causes bleeding of gums and teeth have covered. Hence dental procedure such as scalling removes plaque and tartar makes useful to help recovery that the teeth have loosened.<br>
Fl-Place the head of the soft tooth brush covering with 3-4 teeth place the bristles at the gum margin at an angle of 45°of lower right outside teeth. Exert gentle vibratory pressure using short back and forth motion. Complete approximately 20 strokes buy covering entire tooth surface always paying special attention to the areas where the tooth and gum meet Complete that side by changing the brush to the next three teeth,<br>
F2- Bad breath is usually due to tooth decay gingivitis, bleeding of gums, because of plaque and tartar, Smoking and gastrointestinal disturbances. Over the counter mouth washes only help you to mask this condition and will not treat it The underlined cause needs to be treated by your<br><br>

of the brush into the gum margin at a 45° angle to the long axis of teeth and brush with multiple short vibratory strokes covering teeth surface.<br>
K2-	If you have missing teeth you must replace it by artificial teeth. The adjacent teeth<br>
will over a period of time lean into the empty space. Food is likely accumulated between the remaining teeth providing a breeding ground for decay causing bacteria cleaning is difficult The pressure caused by chewing is not properly distributed. These artificial teeth are expensive and less strong than the original teeth. So protect your original teeth life long.<br>
LI-Clean the inside surface of front lower teeth insert the brush vertically press the end of the brush into the gum margin at a 45° angle to the long axis of teeth and brush with multiple short vibratory strokes covering teeth surface.<br><br>
L2- A finger does not able to reach all the places as well as tooth brush does. Change your tooth brush once in three or four months as the tooth brush bristle ends are round in shape after using four months. This round shape worn and they will become flat and flourish. They do not remove plaque and may cut gums also. Their edges do not touch the plaque straight so they should clean the teeth properly. Then you will face dental problems.<br>
Ml -	Place the tooth brush perpendicularly on the chewing and biting surface of the upper<br>
right teeth press the bristles firmly into the pits and fissures of the teeth and brush with about 20 short back and forth strokes.<br>
M2-	Do not use salt coal and rough substances neem sticks for dental cleaning. They can<br>
damage enamel of your teeth and also damage your gums and proper cleaning is not possible.

left teeth. Press the bristles firmly into the pits and fissures of the teeth and brush with about 20 short back and forth strokes.<br>
N2-	Avoid bad habits like thumb sucking, lip biting and tongue biting. These habits are<br>
leading to upper front teeth and jaw or push forward while lower teeth or push backward. Mouth breathing is because of nasal obstructions as by adnoadenoids and tonsils cause protrusion of the upper front teeth and narrow jaw. After brushing massage your gums with the help of your finger. Then your gum and teeth become healthier.<br>
1-	Place the tooth brush perpendicularly on the chewing and biting surface of the lower right teeth. Press the bristles firmly into the pits and fissures of the teeth and brush with about 20 short back and forth strokes.<br>
2-	At the presence of any following symptoms consult your dentist immediately. Tooth-<br><br>
ache, bleeding gums during brushing, persistent unpleasant breathe, cavities, painful sensation, teeth growing out of order, swollen loose of flabby gums, calicles and loose teeth. Take the child to the dentist immediately If the tooth is knocked out accidentally wrap in a wet cloth and take to the doctor along with the child immediately.<br>
PI-Place the tooth brush perpendicularly on the chewing and biting surface of the lower left teeth. Press the bristles firmly into the pits and fissures of the teeth and brush with about 20 short back and forth strokes.<br>
P2-Use dental floss for intradental cleaning. Pull 45 cm floss, hold the floss in one hand and wind the free end to the middle finger guide and place floss using your thumb between upper teeth and the gum line. Remove the harmful plaque by curving floss around each tooth and use up and down motion. Repeat same procedure with lower teeth. By using index finger to guide the floss. Take care that the gums does not get injured.<br>

A Recorded message is continuously played or a new message can be recorded a fresh to be continuously played with the help of the circuitry which is broadly indicated in the block diagram given above.<br>
The whole circuit consists of four blocks.<br>
1. Audio input section through line in jack. The analog output from the MIC point of any tape recorder is fed as an input to the APLUS Integrated Circuit for the purpose of recording the message. The 1C APR 6008/16 is a non - volatile, voice storage device using Multilevel Flash Memory. Up to 8/16 minutes of audio recording and playback can be accommodated in this device. The voice is recorded into APLUS by obtaining voice sampling at a rate of 6.4K.HZ, 8K.HZ, 4KHZ or 5.3KHZ depending on the quality of reproduced voice output from the 1C The voice 1C (APLUS) control is accomplished through an Industry standard SPI interface micro controller that allows APLUS to manage message recording and playback. This flexible arrangement allows the widest variety of messaging options. APLUS 1C<br><br>
achieves high level of storage capability by using analog multilevel storage technology. This allows the 1C to reproduce signals in their natural form. 2   The instructions or functions like RECORD, STOP, PREVIOUS, PLAY, NEXT, SAMPLE RATING, RESET are to be carried out with the help of a Operational Interface Micro Controller employing Industry standard SPI interface.<br>
3.	The Audio output from the APLUS 1C is further amplified by using another amplifier employing LM 386 before being fed to the loud speaker / Ear Phones.<br>
4.	The APLUS 1C, micro controller operates at DC 3.6 volts, and the amplifier requires DC 9Volts. This can be achieved by using 9V Adopter, full wave rectifier, a regulator circuit using transistor BC 547. Provision is also made for using 9 volts external Batteiy backup.<br>
5.	The binary counter CD 4040 is 12 stage binary ripple counter with a clock input at Pin No. 10. The clock input is obtained from 1C 555 timer Pin No.3. The binary counter also consists of a synchronous master reset input and twelve folly buffered outputs. The counter functions on the High to Low transition of clock pulse. The 4066B 1C has four independent bilateral switches. Each switch has two input / output terminals and an active HIGH enable input<br>
The binary counter output from Pin 9 of CD 4040 is connected to bilateral switch 1C at Pin No.4 &amp; 1. The intermittent and continues outputs are taken from Pin No.3 &amp; 2 respectively. The outputs are obtained at Pin No.3 &amp;2 only when Pin No.5.&amp;13 are made high / low with the help of transistors Ql &amp; Q2 by externally driving their bases connected to Wl, W3 points to high / low With the help of a common point W2. The output from Pin 2/3 which gives continues or intermittent beep sounds when connected to a speaker / Ear phones is connected to the output amplifier Pin No.3, 1C LM 3 86 via 500E preset and capacitor. This signal mixes with the voice signal of the amplifier fed at the same point obtained from 1C APR6016.<br>
When we operate this instrument doctor tooth care pressure warning and talking tooth brush. The brush handle moves up and down by touching Bars front metal plates and give intermittent beep sound. When it is low pressure and give continues beep sound. When it is high pressure on teeth. So we should maintain the pressure on no sound zone.* Mean while we should hear the tooth care speech. And fallow its brushing techniques then maintain dental hygiene. By time begins we<br><br>
will be the best person in maintaining oral hygiene. There then our teeth and total health will be in good condition.<br>
Scope and / or ambit of the invention: This invention is applicable for tooth cleaning. It is used as a tooth brush. When we use this invention doctor tooth care pressure warning and talking tooth brush. While brushing our teeth if we apply high pressure on teeth it will give continues beep sound and if we apply low pressure on teeth. It will give intermittent sound (a Beep-Beep sound with gap). If we apply correct pressure on teeth, there will be no sound, hence by using this we are habituated to maintain correct pressure on teeth. Then our teeth and gums are protected and teeth hypersensitivity and the deceases causing by un-cleaned tooth because of low pressure brushing were prevented.<br>
Secondary the tooth brush saying through voice the brushing techniques and how to do brushing each sides of 16 sides. Generally children are neglected to do brushing all 16 sides they completed brushing by doing brush 4 or 5 sides. So, they faces lot of dental problems, and deceases in their life. So, the brush talking mater consists of tooth care and problems, deceases happened while we are not brushing all 16 sides of teeth. The mater is composed 16 parts Al, A2 to PI, P2, Al to PI are the brushing techniques A2 to P2 are tooth care mater so children hear each part and complete brushing that side like that they complete all 16 sides of teeth brushing and get knowledge about dental and oral health and brought up with good dental and total health. We can make this invention large scale by industrial production so protection should from government. Note: Statements of claims should be on separate sheet.<br>
"Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, this description is not meant to be constructed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments, as well as alternate embodiments of the invention, will become apparent to persons skilled in the art up on reference to the description of the invention.

Nl- Place the tooth brush perpendicularly on the chewing and biting surface of the upper left teeth. Press the bristles firmly into the pits and fissures of the teeth and brush with about 20 short back and forth strokes.<br>
N2- Avoid bad habits like thumb sucking, lip biting and tongue biting. These habits are leading to upper front teeth and jaw or push forward while lower teeth or push backward. Mouth breathing is because of nasal obstructions as by adnoadenoids and tonsils cause protrusion of the upper front teeth and narrow jaw. After brushing massage your gums with the help of your finger. Then your gum and teeth become healthier.<br>
1-	Place the tooth brush perpendicularly on the chewing and biting surface of the lower right teeth. Press the bristles firmly into the pits and fissures of the teeth and brush with about 20 short back and forth strokes.<br>
2-	At the presence of any following symptoms consult your dentist immediately. Tooth-ache, bleeding gums during brushing, persistent unpleasant breathe, cavities, painful sensation, teeth growing out of order, swollen loose of flabby gums, calicles and loose teeth. Take the child to the dentist immediately If the tooth is knocked out accidentally wrap in a wet cloth and take to the doctor along with the child immediately.<br>
PI- Place the tooth brush perpendicularly on the chewing and biting surface of the lower left teeth. Press the bristles firmly into the pits and fissures of the teeth and brush with about 20 short back and forth strokes.<br>
P2- Use dental floss for intradental cleaning. Pull 45 cm floss, hold the floss in one hand and wind the free end to the middle finger guide and place floss using your thumb between upper teeth and the gum line. Remove the harmful plaque by curving floss around each tooth and use up and down motion. Repeat same procedure with lower teeth. By using index finger to guide the floss. Take care that the gums does not get injured.<br>
