FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to the Multi Function Peripherals (MFP) devices which stores the scanned data before transmitting or printing it. More particularly this invention relates to a method of adding user defined text information and the signature to the scanned images using facsimile devices, before transmission.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Currently when a user try to add some customized text information and the signature, they have to do it manually (write the text at the top of the document and sign it at the bottom) and then do the regular scanning procedure to send it as a fax or email or whatever it may be.<br>
The conventional method of sending some customized text information and the signature involves the following steps:<br>
1.	Get ready with the document that needs to have a customized text and/or signature;<br>
2.	Add the text manually at the top/bottom side of the document. (Write it wherever it is required);<br>
3.	Sign it manually at the bottom side of the document;<br>
4.	Do the regular scanning procedure for sending it as a fax/email/ print and so on.<br>
United States Patent Number 5,920,685 claims a printing device such as a facsimile machine for merging a scanned image with a merge image to produce a composite image.<br>
But the present invention claims a Password protected, user defined Signature addition and a USER Defined Caption (Text) to the scanned image to a scanned document before printing /sending/copying.<br><br>
 Japanese Patent Number 4072857 claims a facsimile switching system, which is capable of storing information in file memory. This information can then be inserted into a document before transmission.<br>
However, the patent does not mention password protection of signature related information and also does not mention insertion of captions or user-defined text into a scanned file before transmission/printing/copying.<br>
United States Patent Number 4918723 claims a keyboard to facsimile transmission device, which is capable of inserting an authorising signature into the document created before transmission.<br>
However, unlike the present invention, this patent does not discuss storing password-protected information such as a signature in the file memory of the facsimile machine. It also does not mention insertion of captions or user-defined text into a scanned file before transmission/printing/copying.<br>
Manually adding the text is a painful job and it will take time when one has to add the text in many documents.<br>
Putting signature in all the documents is also a painful job, which may take huge amount of time.<br>
Alignment may not be proper. And also the text is manually added. So the readability and look of the document is not good.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is to invent a method of adding user defined text information and the signature to the scanned images using facsimile devices, before transmission.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a method where once this text caption<br><br>
and/or the signature is added in to the scanned data then this can be transmitted to many destinations. For example eMail, Fax or Print.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a method which is useful to identify the context of the document when hundreds of documents are received at one fax machine. Some header/footer information can be added into the document.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
When an image is scanned by the MFP, the image is scanned line by line and the bitmap image is stored into the scanner buffer. With this invention the user defined text and the stored signature (in bitmap Format) can be added to this scanned data which will appear in the top and/or bottom side of the image. For this an option can be provided in the MFP menu to enter the text, to select the position of the text and the signature file to be added with this image. When the scanner buffer is full or the scanning of the page is over the configured text and/or the signature is embedded in to the scanned data available in the scanner buffer. This data is compressed and stored inside the memory.<br>
This user configured text and/or the selected signature is embedded into the scanned image now. This can then either be printed or faxed or emailed as per requirement. The output will have the scanned data embedded with the text configured by the user (either in the top or bottom or in both the sides) and with the signature selected through menu.<br>
Accordingly, this invention relates to a method of transmission characterized by adding user defined text information and the signature to the scanned images comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	scanning the image line by line by the MFP and storing the bitmap image into the scanned buffer;<br>
(b)	adding user defined text and stored bitmap image to the scanned data;<br><br>
(c)	providing an option in the MFP to enter the text and select position of the text;<br>
(d)	providing a password protected, user defined signature addition and a user defined caption to the scanned image to the scanned document;<br>
(e)	providing an option in the MFP to select the signature file to be added with the image;<br>
(f)	embedding the configured text and /or the signature into the scanned data available in the scanner buffer;<br>
(g)	compressing and storing the data inside the memory; and<br>
(h) printing, faxing or emailing the said data.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from a reading of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the proposed menu architecture for configuring the signature through menu.<br>
Figure 2 shows the proposed menu architecture for configuring the caption text through menu.<br>
Figure 3 shows the proposed menu architecture for selecting the stored signature through menu.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A Multi Function Peripheral device according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described while referring to the accompanying<br><br>
drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
This invention will provide the user to add the user defined text information and the signature to the image scanned by the MFP before transmitting.<br>
The devices shall have a menu through which the user can:<br>
1.	Enable or disable the Top or Bottom text;<br>
2.	Configure the text;<br>
3.	Add the password protected signature to the file memory of the MFP;<br>
4.	Enable the signature for the scanned document<br>
Figure 1 shows a flow diagram as how to configure signature through a menu. First the configure signature option is triggered through the menu. Then the menu asks for a name for the signature the user can set. The signature can be protected by a password. Hence the menu asks for a password and again asks to confirm the same password. Here both the signatures entered should be the same. The same procedure can be repeated for entering another signature.<br>
Figure 2 shows how a caption can be entered through the menu. Add caption in the menu is first triggered. Here the user can choose where he can have the caption, top or in bottom. Subsequently when the top option is enabled the caption text area is displayed where he can enter the text. This is the same with the bottom option also. When it is enabled caption text area is displayed where he can enter the text.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows how a stored signature can be added to the document. Add signature option is first triggered from the menu. When this is enabled, menu prompts for a signature name. When the signature name is given it checks in the database for the same entry. If the same exist in the database the user is asked to provide the password. If the password provided matches, the signature is added to the document.<br>
Steps to be followed by the user to add the signature to the file memory of the MFP<br>
1.	Put the signature in the bottom of a plain white paper and place it in the scanner for scanning the signature.<br>
2.	Go to menu and select the Add signature option<br>
3.	After selecting this option this signature will be scanned and menu will ask to enter the name for the signature. Then it will ask for the password for the signature which needs to be confirmed.<br>
4.	Give a name to the signature and the password.<br>
5.	Repeat it for all the signatures which needs to be stored in the Machine<br>
Steps to be followed by the user to add the stored signature to the scanned document<br>
1.	Go to menu and enable the add signature option<br>
2.	Select the signature which needs to be added at the bottom of the document<br>
3.	Give the correct password to select the signature.<br>
4.	Normal document scanning procedure<br>
Steps to be followed by the user to add a text to the document<br>
1.	Go to menu and enter the text to be embedded in the top and/or bottom side of the document.<br>
2.	Normal document scanning procedure<br><br>
Steps taken bv the MFP firmware to add the text and signature<br>
1.	Check for the text to be added if the option is enabled<br>
2.	Embed the bitmap converted text to the scanned data available in the scanner buffer<br>
3.	Check for the signature if the option enabled and embed the selected signature at the bottom.<br>
4.	Compress the data available in scanner buffer and store it in the disk.<br>
This invention first checks the caption text configuration which is configured through menu. If Add caption option is enabled (either top or bottom or both) then it embeds the bitmap form of the ASCII caption text into the scanned data and storing it in the scanner buffer while scanning the document. Then it checks the add signature configuration which is configured through menu, if there the selected signature is embedded into the scanned document After the full document is scanned then the scanned data available in the scanner buffer is compressed and stored in disk. This data will have the scanned image data embedded with the text message configured and the signature selected.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, printer or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as<br><br>
Included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>
