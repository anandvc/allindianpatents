				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a turbo encoder used for radio<br>
communication systems (including satellite, ISDN, digital cellular, W-CDMA,<br>
and IMT-2000 systems), and in particular, to an internal interleaver of a turbo<br>
encoder.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, an interleaver used for a turbo encoder randomizes an address<br>
of input information word and improves a distance property of a codeword. In<br>
particular, it has been decided that a turbo code will be used in a supplemental<br>
channel (or data transmission channel) of IMT-2000 (or CDMA-2000) and IS-<br>
95C air interfaces and in a data channel of UMTS (Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunication System) proposed by ETSI (European Telecommunication<br>
Standards Institute). Thus, a method for embodying an interleaver for this<br>
purpose is required. In addition, the invention relates to an error correction code<br>
which greatly affects performance improvement of the existing and future digital<br>
communication systems.<br>
For an existing internal interleaver for a turbo encoder (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as a turbo interleaver), there have been proposed various interleavers<br>
such as PN (Pseudo Noise) random interleaver, random interleaver, block<br>
interleaver, non-linear interleaver, and S-random interleaver. However, so far,<br>
such interleavers are mere algorithms designed to improve their performances in<br>
terms of scientific researches rather than implementation. Therefore, when<br>
implementing an actual system, the hardware implementation complexity must<br>
be taken into consideration. A description will now be made of properties and<br>
problems associated with the conventional interleaver for the turbo encoder.<br>
Performance of the turbo encoder is dependent upon its internal<br>
interleaver. In general, an increase in the input frame size (i.e., the number of<br>
information bits included in one frame) enhances the effectiveness of the turbo<br>
encoder. However, an increase in interleaver size causes a geometric increase in<br>
calculations. Therefore, in general, it is not possible to implement the interleaver<br>
for the large frame size.<br>
Therefore, in general, the interleavers are implemented by determining<br>
conditions satisfying several given criteria. The criteria are as follows:<br>
Distance Property : The distance between adjacent codeword symbols<br>
should be maintained to a certain extent. This has the same function as a<br>
codeword distance property of the convolutional code, and as a criterion<br>
indicating this, a minimum free distance is used which is a value of a codeword<br>
path or a codeword sequence with the minimum Hamming weight out of the code<br>
symbol sequences (or codeword paths) output on the trellis. In general, it is<br>
preferable that the interleaver should be designed to have the longer free distance,<br>
if possible.<br>
Random Property : A correlation factor between output word symbols<br>
after interleaving should be much lower than a correlation factor between<br>
original input word symbols before interleaving. That is, randomization between<br>
the output word symbols should be completely performed. This makes a direct<br>
effect on the quality of extrinsic information generated in continuous decoding.<br>
Although the above criteria are applicable to a general turbo interleaver,<br>
it is difficult to clearly analyze the properties when the interleaver increases in<br>
size.<br>
In addition, another problem occurring when designing the turbo<br>
interleaver is that the minimum free distance of the turbo code varies according<br>
to the type of the input codeword. That is, when the input information word has a<br>
specific sequence pattern defined as a critical information sequence pattern<br>
(CISP), the free distance of the output code symbols generated from the turbo<br>
encoder has a very small value. If the input information word has a Hamming<br>
weight 2, the CISP occurs when the input information word has two information<br>
bits of '1' and can also occur when the input information word has 3 or more<br>
information bits of '1'. However, in most cases, when the input information word<br>
has 2 information bits of '1', the minimum free distance is formed and most error<br>
events occur in this condition. Therefore, when designing the turbo interleaver,<br>
an analysis is generally made on the case where the input information word has<br>
the Hamming weight 2. A reason that the CISP exists is because the turbo<br>
encoder generally uses RSC (Recursive Systematic Convolutional Codes)<br>
encoders for the component encoders shown in FIG. 1 (described further below).<br>
To improve performance of the turbo encoder, a primitive polynomial should be<br>
used for a feedback polynomial (gf(x) of FIG. 1) out of the generator polynomials<br>
for the component encoder. Therefore, when the number of the memories of the<br>
RSC encoder is m, a feedback sequence generated by the feedback polynomial<br>
continuously repeats the same pattern at a period of 2m-1. Therefore, if an input<br>
information word ' 1' is received at the instance corresponding to this period, the<br>
same information bits are exclusive-ORed, so that the state of the RSC encoder<br>
becomes an all-zero state henceforth, thus generating the output symbols of all<br>
O's. This means that the Hamming weight of the codeword generated by the RSC<br>
encoder has a constant value after this event. That is, the free distance of the<br>
turbo code is maintained after this time, and the CISP becomes a main cause of a<br>
reduction in the free distance of the turbo encoder, whereas, as noted above, a<br>
larger free distance is desirable.<br>
In this case (In the prior art of turbo interleaver ) to increase the free<br>
distance, the turbo interleaver randomly disperses the CISP input information<br>
word so as to prevent a decrease in the free distance at the output symbol of the<br>
other component RSC encoder.<br>
The above-stated properties are fundamental features of the known turbo<br>
interleaver. However, for the CISP, it is conventional that the information word<br>
has the minimum Hamming weight, when the input information word has the<br>
Hamming weight 2. In other words, the fact that the CISP can be generated even<br>
when the input information word has the Hamming weight 1 (i.e., when the input<br>
information word has one information bit of '1') was overlooked, when the<br>
information word input to the turbo encoder had the type of a block comprised of<br>
frames.<br>
For example, a prime interleaver (PIL) designated as the working model<br>
of the turbo code interleaver specified by the present UMTS standard exhibits<br>
such problems, thus having a degraded free distance property. That is, the<br>
implementation algorithm of the model PIL turbo interleaver include 3 stages, of<br>
which the second stage, which plays the most important role, performs random<br>
permutation on the information bits of the respective groups. The second stage is<br>
divided into three cases of Case A, Case B and Case C, and the Case B always<br>
involves the case where the free distance is decreased due to the event where the<br>
input information word has the Hamming weight 1. In addition, even the Case C<br>
involves a possibility that such an event will occur. The detailed problems will be<br>
described later with reference to the PIL.<br>
In conclusion, when various interleaver sizes are required and the<br>
hardware implementation complexity is limited in the IMT-2000 or UMTS<br>
system, the turbo interleaver should be designed to guarantee the optimal<br>
interleaver performance by taking the limitations into consideration. That is, the<br>
required interleaver should be able to guarantee uniform performance for the<br>
various interleave sizes, while satisfying the above-stated properties. More<br>
recently, there have been proposed several types of the interleavers for a PCCC<br>
(Parallel Concatenated Convolutional Codes) turbo interleaver, and a LCS<br>
(Linear Congruential Sequence) turbo interleaver has been provisionally decided<br>
as the turbo interleaver in the IMT-2000 (or CDMA-2000) and IS-95C<br>
specifications. However, most of these turbo interleavers have the problems of<br>
the CSIP with Hamming weight 1, and the details of implementing these turbo<br>
interleavers are still not defined. Therefore, the present invention proposes a<br>
solution of the turbo interleaver's problems, and a new method for implementing<br>
the turbo interleaver. In addition, the invention shows the PIL interleaver which<br>
is a working assumption of the UMTS turbo interleaver, and proposes a solution<br>
of this interleaver's problem.<br>
To sum up, the prior art has the following disadvantages.<br>
(1) The turbo interleaver is designed for the infinite frame size on the<br>
basis of the CISP for which the input information word has the Hamming weight<br>
2, without considering the fact that determining the CISP according to the type of<br>
the input information word is limited to the frame size. However, in an actual<br>
system, the frame has a finite size, thus causing a decrease in the free distance of<br>
the turbo code.<br>
(2) In designing the existing turbo interleaver, the fact that the input<br>
information word may have Hamming weight 1 was not considered. In other<br>
words, for the finite frame size, the turbo interleaver design rule should be<br>
determined in consideration of the fact that the minimum free distance generated<br>
in the PCCC turbo encoder is determined by the CISP having the Hamming<br>
weight 1. However, this was not fully considered for the existing turbo<br>
inter leavers.<br>
(3) The Prime interleaver (PIL) designated as the working assumption of<br>
the turbo code interleaver defined by the UMTS specification involves such<br>
problems, thus having degraded free distance performance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
interleaving device and method taking into consideration properties of a turbo<br>
interleaver and a property of a critical information sequence pattern (CISP) to<br>
improve performance of the turbo interleaver including, but not limited to, the<br>
minimum free distance.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an interleaving<br>
device and method for improving free distance performance of a turbo code for<br>
the case where an input information word has a Hamming weight 1 when the<br>
information word input to a turbo interleaver has a block type comprised of<br>
frames.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an interleaving<br>
device and method for solving the problem that the free distance is decreased<br>
when an input information word has a Hamming weight 1 in a prime interleaver<br>
(PIL) that is the turbo interleaver specified in the UMTS specification.<br>
To achieve the above objects, there is provided a 2-dimensionai<br>
interleaving method comprising dividing a frame of input information bits into a<br>
plurality of groups and sequentially storing the divided groups in a memory;<br>
permuting the information bits of the groups according to a given rule and<br>
shifting an information bit existing at the last position of the last group to a<br>
position preceding the last position; and selecting the groups according to a<br>
predetermined order, and selecting one of the information bits in the selected<br>
group.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described herein<br>
below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description,<br>
well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they<br>
would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
Prior to describing the invention, the specification will present the<br>
problems occurring when an input information word, which is one of the design<br>
criteria used in the existing turbo interleaver/deinterleaver, is processed on a<br>
frame unit basis, and then analyze an affect that the CISP with a Hamming<br>
weight 1 has on the Hamming weight of the output code symbols. Next, the<br>
specification will propose a method for solving the problems and verify the<br>
performance difference through analysis of the minimum free distance.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a structure of a general parallel turbo encoder.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the turbo encoder includes a first component encoder<br>
111 for encoding input frame data, an interleaver 112 for interleaving the input<br>
frame data, and a second component encoder 113 for encoding an output of the<br>
interleaver 112. A known RSC (Recursive Systematic Convolutional CODES)<br>
encoder is typically used for the first and second component encoders 111 and<br>
113. Hereinafter, the first RSC component encoder 111 will be referred to as<br>
RSCl and the second RSC component encoder 113 will be referred to as RSC2.<br>
Further, the interleaver 112 has the same size as the input information bit frame,<br>
and rearranges the sequence of the information bits provided to the second<br>
component encoder 113 to reduce a correlation between the information bits.<br>
FIGS. 2 and 3 show fundamental structures of the general interleaver and<br>
deinterleaver, respectively.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, an interleaver for interleaving frame data output<br>
from the first component encoder will be described. An address generator 211<br>
generates a read address for changing the sequence of input data bits according to<br>
an input frame data size L and an input clock, and provides an interleaver<br>
memory 212 with the generated read address. The interleaver memory 212<br>
sequentially stores input data in a write mode of operation, and outputs the stored<br>
data according to the read address provided from the address generator 211 in a<br>
read mode of operation. A counter 213 counts the input clock and provides the<br>
clock count value to the interleaver memory 212 as a write address As describe<br>
above, the interleaver sequentially stores input data in the interleaver memory<br>
212 in the write mode of operation, and outputs the data stored in the interleaver<br>
memory 212 according to the read address provided from the address generator<br>
211 in the read mode of operation. Ahematively, it is also possible to change the<br>
sequence of the input data bits before storing them in the interleaver memory in<br>
the write mode of operation, and sequentially read the stored data in the read<br>
mode of operation.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a deinterleaver will be described. An address<br>
generator 311 generates a write address for restoring the sequence of input data<br>
bits to the original sequence according to an input frame data size L and an input<br>
clock, and provides a deinterleaver memory 312 with the generated write address.<br>
The deinterleaver memory 312 stores input data according to the write address<br>
provided from the address generator 311 in the write mode of operation, and<br>
sequentially outputs the stored data in the read mode of operation. A counter 313<br>
counts the input clock and provides the clock count value to the deinterleaver<br>
memory 312 as a read address. As described above, the deinterleaver has the<br>
same structure as the interleaver but has the reverse operation of the interleaver.<br>
The deinterleaver is merely different from the interleaver in that the input data<br>
has different sequences in both the read and write modes. 1 here fore, for<br>
convenience, the description below will be made with reference to the interleaver<br>
only.<br>
In general, since the turbo code is a linear block code, a new information<br>
word obtained by adding a non-zero information word to an input information<br>
word has the same codeword distribution property. Therefore, even though the<br>
property is developed based on the all-zero information word, the same<br>
performance will be given as compared with the performance determined using<br>
the non-zero information word. Thus, a description below will be made with<br>
reference to the case where the input information word is the all-zero codeword.<br>
That is, performance of the turbo code will be analyzed on the assumption that<br>
the input information word has all zero bits and only a given information bit is<br>
'1'.<br>
To improve performance of the turbo encoder, a primitive polynomial<br>
may be used for a feedback polynomial out of a generator polynomial for the<br>
component encoder. The feedback polynomial is given by expressing tapping<br>
which undergoes feedback in the RSC component encoders 111, 113 of FIG. 1 in<br>
a polynomial, and the feedback polynomial is defined as gf(x). If FIG. 1,<br>
gf(x)=l+x2+x3. That is, the highest order indicates the depth of a memory, and<br>
the rightmost connection determines whether the coefficient x3 of gf(x) is 0 or 1.<br>
Therefore, when the number of the memories for the RSC encoder is m, a<br>
feedback sequence generated by the feedback polynomial continuously repeats<br>
the same pattern at a period of 2m-1. Thus, when an input information word ' 1' is<br>
received at the instant corresponding to this period (e.g., for m=3, when an input<br>
information word of '10000001...' is received), the same information bits are<br>
exclusive-ORed, so that the state of the RSC encoder becomes an all-zero state<br>
henceforth, thus generating the output symbols of all O's. This means that the<br>
Hamming weight of the codeword generated by the RSC encoder has the<br>
constant value of 1 after this event. That is, it means that the free distance of the<br>
turbo code is maintained after this time, and the CISP becomes a main cause of a<br>
reduction in the free distance of the turbo encoder.<br>
In this case, to increase the free distance, the turbo interleaver randomly<br>
disperses the CISP input information word so as to prevent a decrease in the free<br>
distance at the output symbol of the other component RSC encoder. Table 1<br>
below shows a feedback sequence generated from gf(x)=l+x2+x3 In Table 1,<br>
X(t) indicates an input information bit at a time t of the input information word.<br>
Further, m(t), m(t-l) and m(t-2) indicate 3 memory states of the RSC encoder,<br>
respectively. Here, since the number of memories is 3, the period is 23-1=7.<br>
From Table 1, it is noted that if X(t)=l at time t=7, then m(t), m(t-l) and<br>
m(t-2) become all zero states henceforth. Therefore, the Hamming weight of the<br>
following output symbols becomes always zero. In this case, if the turbo<br>
interleaver provides the RSC2 with the input information sequence<br>
'10000001000...' as it is, the Hamming weight of the output symbols at the<br>
following time of t=7 will not change thereafter even in the RSC2 using the same<br>
feedback polynomial, for the same reason. This causes a decrease in the free<br>
distance of the whole output symbols of the turbo encoder. To prevent this, the<br>
turbo interleaver changes the original input information sequence<br>
'10000001000...' to an input information sequence of a different pattern (for<br>
example, changes a position of the information bit '1' such as 110000000...) and<br>
provides the resulting sequence to the RSC2. Therefore, even though an increase<br>
in the Hamming weight is stopped in the RSCl, the Hamming weight<br>
continuously increases in the RSC2, so that the total free distance of the turbo<br>
encoder increases. This is because the feedback polynomial, having the infinite<br>
impulse response (IIR) filter type, continuously generates the infinite output<br>
symbol '1' even for one input information bit '1'. Equation 1 below shows the<br>
relationship between the RSCl and the RSC2 in terms of the Hamming weight or<br>
free distance of the turbo encoder.<br>
[Equation 1]<br>
comparatively made regarding the problems of the prior art and the solutions of<br>
the problems.<br>
In FIGS. 4 to 10, the cross-hatching parts indicate the positions where<br>
the input information bit is '1', and the other parts indicate the positions where<br>
the input information bit is '0'.<br>
If, as shown in FIG. 4, the turbo interleaver shifts (or permutes) the<br>
position of the input information word, where the original symbol of the RSC1 is<br>
'1', to the last position of the frame after interleaving, the number of the output<br>
symbols '1' generated from the RSC2 will be very small. In this case, since the<br>
RSC 1 and the RSC2 generate a very small number of the output symbols ' 1' in<br>
accordance with Equation 1, the total free distance decreases drastically.<br>
However, if, as shown in FIG. 5, the turbo interleaver shifts the position of the<br>
input information word, where the original symbol of the RSCl is '1', to the first<br>
position or a position near the leading position of the frame after interleaving, the<br>
number of the output symbols ' 1' generated from the RSC2 will be increased.<br>
This is because a plurality of symbols ' 1' are output through (N(Interleaver Size)<br>
-h(a number of' '1')) state transitions of the RSC2 encoder. In this case, the RSC2<br>
generates a great number of the output symbols '1', thereby increasing the total<br>
free distance.<br>
In addition to the decreased free distance occurring when the internal<br>
interleaver shifts the input information bit '1' located at the last position of the<br>
frame to the last position of the frame as show in FIG. 4, if one of two<br>
information bits of' '1' located at the ending position of the frame are still located<br>
at (or near) the ending position of the frame even after interleaving as shown in<br>
FIG. 6, the total free distance will decrease.<br>
For example, if the internal interleaver operations in the frame mode<br>
shown in FIG. 6 wherein two symbols located at the ending position of the frame<br>
are 1's and the other symbols are all O's, then the Hamming weight of the input<br>
information word is 2. Even in this case, the number of the output symbols ' 1'<br>
generated from the RSCl becomes very small, since there is no more input<br>
information bit. Therefore, in accordance with Equation 1, the RSC2 should<br>
generate a great number of the output symbols ' 1' to increase the total free<br>
distance. However, if, as shown in FIG. 6, the turbo interleaver shifts the position<br>
of the above two symbols to the ending position (or somewhere near to the<br>
ending position) of the frame even after interleaving, the RSC2 will also generate<br>
a small number of the output symbols '1'. However, if, as shown in FIG. 7, the<br>
turbo interleaver shifts the position of the above two symbols to the leading<br>
position (or somewhere near the leading position) of the frame, the RSC2 will<br>
generate a great number of the symbols '1'. That is, the RSC2 encoder outputs a<br>
plurality of the symbols ' 1' through (N-h) state transitions (N= Interleaver Size,<br>
h=a number of symbol '1'). In this case, therefore, the RSC2 generates the<br>
increased number of output symbols '1', thereby increasing the total free distance.<br>
This principle can be expanded to the case where the turbo interleaver<br>
operates in the frame mode shown in FIG. 8 wherein a plurality of information<br>
bits '1' exist at the ending period (or duration) of the frame and the other<br>
information bits are all O's. Even in this case, the total free distance is increased<br>
by shifting the information bits exiting at the ending position of the frame to the<br>
leading position of the frame or to positions nearer to the leading position, as<br>
shown in FIG. 8. Of course, since the turbo code is the linear block code, even the<br>
new information word obtained by adding a non-zero information word to such<br>
an information word has the same property. Therefore, a description below will<br>
be made on the basis of the all-zero information word.<br>
In conclusion, when designing the turbo interleaver, the following<br>
conditions as well as the random property and the distance property should be<br>
satisfied to guarantee performance of the turbo decoder and the free distance of<br>
the turbo encoder.<br>
Condition 1 : In designing every turbo interleaver, the information bits<br>
corresponding to a specific period from the last position of the frame should be<br>
shifted to the foremost position of the frame by interleaving to increase the free<br>
distance of the turbo code.<br>
Condition 2 : The information bits corresponding to the last position of<br>
the frame should be shifted to a position preceding the last position (if possible,<br>
to the leading position of the frame) by interleaving, to increase the free distance<br>
of the turbo code.<br>
These conditions are applicable to a 2-dimensional turbo interleaver as<br>
well as the above-described 1-diemensional interleaver. The 1-dimensional<br>
interleaver performs interleaving, regarding the input information frame as a<br>
group, as shown in FIGS. 4 to 8. The 2-dimensional interleaver performs<br>
interleaving by dividing the input information frame into a plurality of groups.<br>
FIG. 9 shows 2-dimensional interleaving wherein the input information word has<br>
the Hamming weight 1.<br>
As illustrated, the input information bits are sequentially written in the<br>
respective groups (or rows). That is, the input information bits are sequentially<br>
written in the groups (or rows) rO, rl, . . ., r(R-l). In each group, the input<br>
information bits are sequentially written from the left to the right. Thereafter, a<br>
turbo interleaving algorithm randomly changes the positions of RxC elements<br>
(i.e., input information bits), where R is the number of rows, C is the number of<br>
columns or, equivalently, the number of information bits in a group. In this case,<br>
it is preferable to design the turbo interleaving algorithm such that the<br>
information bit located at the last position (or the rightmost position) of the last<br>
group should be located at the foremost position, if possible, during output. Of<br>
course, depending on the order of selecting the groups, the input information bit<br>
located at the last position may be shifted to the foremost position (or close<br>
thereto) of the corresponding group. Further, Condition 1 and Condition 2 can be<br>
normalized in a k-dimensional turbo interleaver (where k&gt;2) as well as the 2-<br>
dimensional interleaver.<br>
FIG. 10 shows a case where the input information word has the<br>
Hamming weight of over 2. As shown, the information bits located at the last<br>
position of the last group are shifted to the leading positions of the last group by<br>
interleaving. Of course, the detailed shifting (or interleaving) rule is determined<br>
according to an algorithm for a specific interleaver. The invention presents<br>
Condition 1 and Condition 2 which should be necessarily satisfied in determining<br>
the interleaving rule.<br>
Next, a description will be made of the PIL interleaver having the<br>
problems of the prior art, and then a further description will be made of a<br>
solution of the problems that the PIL interleaver has.<br>
First stage, (1) determine a row number such that<br>
R = 10 when the number of input information bit K is 481 to 530 (i.e., case (1))<br>
and R=20 at the case of the number of input information bit K is any other<br>
block length except 481 to 530 (i.e., case (2)), (2) determine a column number<br>
C such that in case (1) C=p=53 where, p = prime number, and in case (2)<br>
(i) find minimum prime number p satisfying <br>
(ii) <br>
(iii) <br>
A second stage, Case-B, if C=p+1 out of an interleaving algorithm for<br>
the PIL interleaver which was provisionally determined as the UMTS turbo<br>
interleaver will be first described. In Equation 2 below, R indicates the number of<br>
groups (or rows), and has a value of R=10 or R=20. Further, C indicates the size<br>
of each group and is determined by the minimum prime number p satisfying<br>
 determined in Stage 1 according to a value K/R where K is the<br>
size of the actual input information bits of a frame. In Case-B, it is always that<br>
C=p+1. Therefore, the actual size of the PIL interleaver becomes a value<br>
determined by RxC, which is larger than K. Further, Cj(i) indicates a position of<br>
the information bits obtained by randomly permuting the position of the input<br>
information bits in the group on the basis of an ith group, where i=0,1,2,3,..., p.<br>
In addition, Pj indicates an initial seed value given for an jth row vector, and is<br>
initially given by the algorithm.<br>
[Equation 2]<br>
B-1) A primitive root gO is selected from a given random initialization<br>
constant table(3GPP TS 25.212 table 2; table of prime number p and associated<br>
primitive root) such that gO is the primitive root of a field based on the prime<br>
number p.<br>
B-2) Construct base sequence C(i) to be used for row vector<br>
randomization is generated using the following formula.<br><br>
B-3) Select the minimum prime integer set {q, j=0,l,2,... ,R-l} such that<br><br>
where g.c.d is a greatest common divider and qo=l<br>
 which is a new prime number set is calculated<br>
from such that Pp(j) = qj where, j=0, 1, ... R-1 and P(j)is the<br>
inter-row permutation pattern defined in the third stage.<br>
B-5) Elements of the jth intra-row permutation as following method.<br><br>
A third stage,<br>
Perform the row-permutation based on the following <br>
patterns, where P(j) is the original row position of the j-th permuted row.<br>
The usage of these patterns is as follows; when the number of input information<br>
bit K is 320 to 480 bit perform group selection pattern p a, when the number of<br>
input information bit K is 481 to 530 bit perform group selection pattern p c.<br>
when the number of input information bit K is 531 to 2280 bit perform group<br>
selection pattern p a, when the number of input information bit K is 2281 to 2480<br>
bit perform group selection pattern p b, when the number of input information bit<br>
K is 2481 to 3160 bit perform group selection pattern p a, when the number of<br>
input information bit K is 3161 to 3210 bit perform group selection pattern pa.<br>
and when the number of input information bit K is 3211 to 5114 bit perform<br>
group selection pattern p a. The group selection pattern is as follow;<br>
Pa: {19,9, 14,4 0,2,5,7, 12, 18, 10, 8, 13, 17,3, 1, 16,6, 15, ll}for R=20<br>
Pb: {19,9, 14,40,2,5,7, 12, 18, 16, 13, 17, 15,3, 1,6, 11,8, 10} for R=20<br>
Pc: {9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0} for R=10.<br>
It should be noted herein that the last operation of B-5) is defined as<br>
Cj(p)=p. That is, this means that when the position of the input information bit<br>
before interleaving is p, the position of the input information bit is maintained at<br>
the position p even after PIL interleaving. Therefore, for the last group (j=19), the<br>
information bits Cr-1(P)=C19(p) existing at the last position maintain the same<br>
position i=P which is the last position of the 19th group. Therefore, Condition 2<br>
for designing the turbo interleaver is not satisfied.<br>
That is, to solve the problem that the PIL interleaver has, algorithm step<br>
B-5) may be modified as follows. The invention presents six methods of B-5-1)<br>
to B-5-6), by way of example Among these, an optimal performance can be<br>
determined through simulations in the light of the properties of the turbo<br>
interleaver.<br>
One of the following 6 methods are selected.<br>
B-5-1) Positions of CR-1(0) and CR-1(p) are interchanged. R=10 or 20<br>
B-5-2) Positions of CR-1(p-1) and CR-1(p) are interchanged. R=10 or 20<br>
B-5-3) For every j, positions of Cj(0) and Cj(p) are interchanged.<br>
j=0,l,2,...,R-l<br>
B-5-4) For every j, positions of Cj(p-l) and Cj(p) are interchanged.<br>
j=0,l,2,...,R-l<br>
B-5-5) For every j, an optimal exchanging position k for the used<br>
interleaving algorithm is searched to interchange positions of Cj(k) and Cj(p).<br>
B-5-6) For an (R-l)th row, an optimal exchanging position k for the used<br>
interleaving algorithm is searched to interchange positions of CR-1(k) and CR-1(p).<br>
FIGS. 11 and 12 show a block diagram and a flow chart according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, respectively..<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, a row vector permutation block (or row vector<br>
permutation index generator) 912 generates an index for selecting a row vector<br>
according to counting of a row counter 911, and provides the generated index to a<br>
high address buffer of the address buffer 918. The row vector permutation block<br>
912 is a group selector for sequentially or randomly selecting, when the input<br>
information word is divided into a plurality of groups, the divided groups. A<br>
column vector permutation block (or column vector's elements permutation<br>
index generator) 914 generates, depending on a modified PIL algorithm 915, an<br>
index for permuting the positions of the elements in the corresponding row<br>
vector (or group) according to counting of a column counter 913, and provides<br>
the generated index to a low address buffer of the address buffer 918. The<br>
column vector permutation block 914 is a randomizer for permuting the position<br>
of the information bits in the group, which were sequentially stored in the order<br>
of input, according to a given rule. A RAM (Random Access Memory) 917 stores<br>
temporary data generated in the process of the program. A look-up table 916<br>
stores parameters for interleaving and the primitive root. The addresses obtained<br>
by row permutation and column permutation (i.e., the addresses stored in the<br>
address buffer 918) are used as addresses for interleaving.<br>
FIG. 12 shows a flow chart of the modified PIL algorithm. A description<br>
below relates to the second stage, Case-B, in the PIL algorithm. Referring to FIG.<br>
12, a primitive root gO is selected from a given random initialization constant<br>
table, in step 1011. Thereafter, in step 1013, a base sequence C(i) for<br>
randomizing the elements (or information bits) of the group is generated using<br>
the following formula.<br><br>
Thereafter, in step 1015, a minimum prime number set {qj, j=0,l,2,...,R-<br>
1} given for the algorithm is calculated. Then, in step 1017, a prime number set<br>
{pj,j=0,l,2,...,R-l} is calculated from the calculated minimum prime number set.<br>
Next, in step 1019, the elements of an jth group are randomized in the following<br>
method.<br>
Cj(p-1)=0<br>
Here, in order to increase the minimum free distance of the turbo encoder<br>
while randomizing the elements of the group, one of B-5-1) to B-5-6) is selected<br>
to permute (or shift) the information bits existing at the last position of the frame<br>
to other positions after interleaving in step 1021.<br>
B-5-1) means that the positions of the first information bit and the last<br>
information bit in the last group are exchanged with each other. B-5-2) means<br>
that the last two information bits in the last group are exchanged with each other.<br>
B-5-3) means that for every group, the information bit existing at the last position<br>
and the information bit existing at the foremost position are exchanged with each<br>
other. B-5-4) means that for every group, the positions of the last two<br>
information bits are exchanged. B-5-5) means that for every group, an optimal<br>
position k for a given interleaving rule is searched to exchange a position of the<br>
information bit existing at the last position of each row with a position of the<br>
information bit existing at the position k. Finally, B-5-6) means that for the last<br>
group, an optimal position k for a given interleaving rule is searched to exchange<br>
a position of the information bit existing at the last position with a position of the<br>
information bit existing at the position k.<br>
By applying the modified algorithm to the PIL interleaver, it is possible<br>
to prevent a decrease in the free distance of the turbo encoder. Table 2 below<br>
shows a weight spectrum of the PIL interleaver before modification, and Table 3<br>
below shows a weight spectrum of the PIL interleaver after modification.<br>
In Tables 2 and 3, K indicates the size of the input information frame,<br>
Dfree(l) indicates a free distance calculated with the CISP for which the input<br>
information word has the Hamming weight 1, and Dfree(2) indicates a free<br>
distance calculated with the CISP for which the input information word has the<br>
Hamming weigh 2. For example, for K=600, Dfree(l) of the original PIL<br>
interleaver is indicated by 25/39/49/53/57/... in Table 2, and this means that the<br>
minimum free distance is 25 and the next minimum free distance is 39. Similarly,<br>
Dfree(2)=38/38/42/... means that the minimum free distance is 38. Therefore, it is<br>
noted that the minimum free distance is determined according to the free distance<br>
by the CISP with the Hamming weight 1. To prevent a decrease in the free<br>
distance by the CISP with the Hamming weight I, the invention uses the B-5-1)<br>
method in this example. That is, Dfree(l) is improved by removing the CISP with<br>
the Hamming weight 1.<br>
Table 2 below shows a weight spectrum of the PIL interleaver before<br>
modification.<br>
Table 3 below shows a weight spectrum of the PIL interleaver after<br>
modification.<br>
5 [Tables]<br>
As described above, the novel turbo encoder suppresses a decreases in<br>
the free distance caused by one or more information bits of '1' located at the last<br>
period of a data frame input to the component encoder, using the internal<br>
5 interleaver, thereby contributing to implementation of a turbo encoder with high<br>
performance.<br>

arranged In an internal interleaver of a turbo encoder, the method<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
a) permuting the Information bits position of the groups<br>
according to predetermined interleaving rule;<br>
b) exchanging an information bit existing at a last position of<br>
a last group of the frame with a first position within the<br>
last group.<br>
This invention relates to a 2-dimensional interleaving method is disclosed. The<br>
method comprises dividing a frame of input information bits into a plurality of<br>
groups and sequentially storing the divided groups in a memory; permuting the<br>
information bits of the groups according to a given rule and shifting an<br>
information bit existing at the last position of the last group to a position<br>
preceding the last position; and selecting the groups according to a<br>
predetermined order, and selecting one of the information bits in the selected<br>
group.</td>
