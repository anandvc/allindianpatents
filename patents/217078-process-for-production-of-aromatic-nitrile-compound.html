Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for produc¬ing an aromatic nitrile compound by oxidizing one of an aro¬matic hydroxymethyl compound, an aromatic alkoxymethyl com¬pound and an aromatic aldehyde compound, or a mixture thereof in the presence of ammonia or the like as a nitrogen source.<br>
Background Art<br>
Various processes have been known heretofore for pro¬duction of an aromatic nitrile compound from a raw material compound which is an aromatic hydroxymethyl compound, an aro¬matic alkoxymethyl compound or an aromatic aldehyde compound.<br>
There are known, for example, processes which comprise<br>
reacting an aromatic hetero-cyclic aldehyde [e.g. furfural<br>
(2-furylaldehyde), 2-thienylaldehyde or 3-pyridylaldehyde] or<br>
an aromatic aldehyde (e.g. benzaldehyde) with a hydroxyamine<br><br>
salt to form an oxime and then dehydrating the oxime to pro¬duce a corresponding nitrile (e.g. furonitrile) [see Syn¬thetic Communications, Vol. 30, pp. 3109-3114 (2000); Synthe¬sis, pp. 190-191 (1982); Synthesis, pp. 243-246 (2003); Syn¬thetic Communications, Vol. 13 No. 12, pp. 999-1006 (1983)].<br>
These processes, however, comprise two steps of oxime formation and subsequent dehydration; require a dehydrating reagent (e.g. phtalic anhydride or methanesulfonyl chloride) of ordinarily at least one equivalent; when hydroxyamine sul¬fate is used, it is difficult in some cases to separate the formed aromatic nitrile compound from an inorganic sulfate.<br>
There is also known a process which comprises reacting an aromatic aldehyde with ammonia gas in a gas phase in the presence of a catalyst consisting of copper and a solid acid, to produce an aromatic nitrile compound (JP-A-2000-239247) . In this process, however, catalyst preparation need be con¬ducted at a high temperature of 500°C and excessive ammonia of 2.7 to 10.3 equivalents is required, which is disadvanta¬geous industrially; moreover, a special facility is required for a gas phase reaction at high temperatures of 280 to<br><br>
330°C; furthermore, the raw material aldehyde compound is not usable when it is thermally unstable or has a high boiling point, which is a drawback.<br>
There is also known a process for converting an aro¬matic aldehyde into a corresponding aromatic nitrile compound, using sodium azide in the presence of aluminum chloride [Syn¬thesis, Vol. 7, pp. 641-642 (1992)]. However, use of highly toxic sodium azide in 6 equivalents and aluminum chloride in 2 equivalents is not preferred in industrial practice of the process, from the standpoint of safe operation.<br>
There is further known a process using either of an aromatic aldehyde and benzyl alcohol, and aqueous ammonia and potassium peroxodisulfate in the presence of a nickel cata¬lyst [Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, pp. 571-574 (1990) ] . In this process, however, there are problems that a large excess of ammonia (10 equivalents) is required and, moreover, a ben¬zoic acid compound corresponding to the raw material used is formed as a by-product in an amount of 10 to 20%.<br>
Thus, in the technical field to which the present in¬vention belongs, it has been desired to solve the drawbacks<br><br>
of the prior art and develop a process which can produce an aromatic nitrile compound easily under mild conditions with¬out using a special reaction apparatus or a special reaction reagent.<br>
In view of such a situation, the present inventor made a study on a process which can produce an aromatic nitrile compound from either of an aromatic hydroxymethyl compound, an aromatic alkoxymethyl compound and an aromatic aldehyde compound, or from a mixture thereof. As a result, the pre¬sent inventor found unexpectedly that the above aim could be solved by reacting the above aromatic compound with an oxi¬dized bromine compound in the presence of an acid catalyst, using ammonia or the like as a nitrogen source. The present invention has been completed based on this finding.<br>

of corresponding chlorotoluene derivatives (generally, a mix¬ture of a benzyl chloride compound, a benzyl chloride com¬pound, etc.) and the mixture per se is hydrolyzed in water or decomposed in an alcohol to produce a mixture of a corre¬sponding benzyl alcohol compound, a benzyl ether compound and a benzaldehyde compound (i.e. a raw material compound com¬prising a plurality of kinds of compounds) and this mixture itself is used as a raw material of the present invention process without purifying it to obtain a single product of a benzyl alcohol compound, a benzyl ether compound or a benzal¬dehyde compound.<br>
Successively, description is made on the oxidized bro¬mine compound represented by the general formula (2) .<br>
In the general formula (2), M is a hydrogen atom, or a metal atom of alkali metal (e.g. sodium, potassium or lith¬ium), alkaline earth metal (e.g. magnesium or calcium) or the like; and m is an integer of 1 to 3.<br>
Therefore, as the oxidized bromine compound represented by the general formula (2), usable in the reaction with one of the aromatic hydroxymethyl compound, aromatic alkoxymethyl<br><br>
compound and aromatic aldehyde compound all represented by the general formula (1), or with a mixture thereof, there can specifically be mentioned, for example, bromic acid; bromates typified by bromic acid metal salts, such as sodium bromate, potassium bromate, calcium bromate and the like which are compounds of general formula (2) wherein m is 3; bromous acid; bromites represented by bromous acid metal salts, such as sodium bromite, potassium bromite and the like which are compounds of general formula (2) wherein m is 2; hypobromous acid and hypobromites which are compounds of general formula (2) wherein m is 1- These compounds may be used as a hydrate. Use of bromic acid, bromate or bromite is preferred from the standpoints of availability, easiness of handling, reactivity, etc., and use of bromate is preferred particularly.<br>
These oxidized bromine compounds represented by the general formula (2) are known compounds.<br>
With respect to the molar ratio of the oxidized bromine compound represented by the general formula (2), used in the present reaction, the reaction proceeds at any molar ratio relative to the raw material compound represented by the gen-<br><br>
eral formula (1) . However, when the raw material compound represented by the general formula (1) is either of an aro¬matic hydroxymethyl compound and an aromatic alkoxymethyl compound, the amount of the oxidized bromine compound repre¬sented by the general formula (2) used relative to 1 mole of the raw material compound can be, for example, ordinarily 0.66 to 1.0 mole, preferably 0.7 to 0.8 mole when the m of the general formula (2) is 3; ordinarily 1.0 to 1.5 moles, preferably 1.1 to 1.2 moles when the m of the general formula (2) is 2; and ordinarily 2.0 to 3.0 moles, preferably 2.2 to 2.4 moles when the m of the general formula (2) is 1.<br>
When the raw material compound is an aromatic aldehyde compound, the amount of the oxidized bromine compound repre¬sented by the general formula (2) used relative to 1 mole of the raw material compound can be, for example, ordinarily 0.33 to 0.5 mole, preferably 0.35 to 0.4 mole when the m of the general formula (2) is 3; ordinarily 0.5 to 0.75 mole, preferably 0.55 to 0.6 mole when the m of the general formula (2) is 2; and ordinarily 1.0 to 1.5 moles, preferably 1.1 to 1.2 moles when the m of the general formula (2) is 1.<br><br>

Also when the raw material compound has a plurality of groups -X, only part of the plurality of groups -X may be converted into nitrile group by controlling the molar ratio of the used oxidized bromine compound of general formula (2).<br>
The reaction is conducted by adding ammonia or an ammo¬nium salt as a nitrogen source. The form of ammonia added may be any; however, from the availability, aqueous ammonia or ammonia gas is preferred, and aqueous ammonia is particu¬larly preferred.<br><br>
As the ammonium salt, there can be mentioned, for exam¬ple, ammonium salts of straight chain or branched chain CI to C6 aliphatic carboxylic acids which may have substituents such as hydroxy1 group, straight chain or branched chain CI to C6 alkoxy group, straight chain or branched chain hydroxy CI to C6 alkyl group, straight chain or branched chain (CI to C6 alkoxy)-(CI to C6 alkyl) group, carboxyl group or metal salt thereof, straight chain or branched chain (CI to C6 alk¬oxy) carbonyl group, halogen atom, nitro group, amino group, straight chain or branched chain mono- or di(Cl to C6 al¬kyl) amino group, straight chain or branched chain (CI to C6 alkyl)carbonylamino group, cyano group, formyl group, straight chain or branched chain (CI to C6 alkyl)carbonyl group, phenyl group [the phenyl group may have substituents such as straight chain or branched chain CI to C6 alkyl group, hydroxyl group, straight chain or branched chain CI to C6 alkoxy group, straight chain or branched chain CI to C6 hy-droxyalkyl group, straight chain or branched chain (CI to C6 alkoxy)-(CI to C6 alkyl) group, straight chain or branched chain CI to C6 haloalkyl group, carboxyl group or metal salt<br><br>

Preferred are am¬monium carboxylates, more preferred are ammonium salts of straight chain or branched chain CI to C6 aliphatic carbox-ylic acids which may have substituents, particularly pre¬ferred are ammonium acetate and ammonium propionate.<br>
The amount of ammonia or ammonium salt used is at least an equivalent relative to the raw material compound used and may be ordinarily 1.0 to 5.0 equivalents and preferably 1.0 to 3.0 equivalents relative to 1 mole of the raw material compound represented by the general formula (1).<br>
However, when the raw material compound represented by the general formula (1) has a plurality of groups -X (hy-droxymethyl group, alkoxymethyl group or formyl group), that is, when the raw material compound is a compound of general formula (1) wherein the n is 2 to 9, or a compound of general<br><br>
formula (1) wherein the R is a X-substituted phenyl group or X-substituted hetero-aryl group, or a compound of general formula (1) satisfying both of such conditions, it is pre¬ferred to use the ammonia or ammonium salt at equivalents ob¬tained by multiplying the above-mentioned equivalents of am¬monia or ammonium salt by the total number of the substitu-ents.<br>
Use of an amine (primary amine, secondary amine or ter¬tiary amine) in place of the ammonia or ammonium salt is not desired because it produces an amide compound (a by-product) besides an intended product) or because an intended reaction does not proceed smoothly and no intended product is obtained at all.<br>
The reaction is conducted using an acid catalyst. As the acid catalyst used in the reaction, there can be men¬tioned, for example, carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, fluoroacetic acid, lac¬tic acid, amino acids and the like; organic acids typified by organic sulfonic acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid and the like; in-<br><br>
organic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phos¬phoric acid and the like; Lewis acids such as aluminum chlo¬ride, boron trifluoride-tetrahydrofuran complex (BF3-THF com¬plex) , polyphosphoric acid and the like; and solid acids. Use of carboxylic acid such as acetic acid, propionic acid or the like is preferred in the reaction.<br>
The amount of the acid catalyst used in the reaction may be any amount as long as the reaction proceeds suffi¬ciently. However, the amount is, for example, 0.01 to 100 moles, preferably 0.05 to 30 moles, more preferably 0.1 to 30 moles, particularly preferably 0.2 to 10 moles per 1 mole of the raw material compound represented by the general formula (1). In the reaction, the above molar ratio is sufficient when the raw material compound is neutral.<br>
Meanwhile, for example, when the hetero-cycle portion of the raw material compound shows basicity and is in a neu¬tral state (that is, does not take a form of salt such as hy¬drochloride or the like), it is presumed that the acid cata¬lyst forms a substance like an ion pair, with the raw mate¬rial compound in the reaction system and accordingly the<br><br>
amount of the acid catalyst required to exhibit an intended function decreases in the reaction system; therefore, it is preferred that, for example, the acid catalyst is used exces¬sively by an amount matching the number of basic portion in the hetero-cyclic aromatic compound molecule represented by the general formula (1) and the amount of the acid catalyst capable of exhibiting its intended function is controlled in the above-mentioned range of the use amount of the acid cata¬lyst. The use amount of the acid catalyst may not be limited to the above-mentioned range and may be a large excess when the acid catalyst functions also as a solvent as mentioned later.<br>
The reaction may take place sufficiently in a solvent-free state but may also be conducted using a solvent. The solvent usable in the reaction may be any solvent as long as it does not hinder the reaction. There can be mentioned, for example, carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid and the like; water; aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene and the like; halogenated aliphatic hy¬drocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform and the like;<br><br>
acetic acid esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, bu¬tyl acetate and the like; aprotic polar solvents such as di¬methyl formamide,   dimethylacetamide,   N-methylpyrrolidone, tetramethylurea, hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA), pro¬pylene carbonate and the like; ether type solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and the like; and aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, n-hexane and the like. Use of carboxylic acid (e.g. acetic acid, propionic acid) or water is preferred from the standpoints of solubility and re¬activity of oxidizing reagent (oxidized bromine compound), and use of carboxylic acid as the solvent is particularly preferred because the carboxylic acid functions also as an acid catalyst.  The solvent may be used singly or as a mixed solvent of any mixing ratio.<br>
The amount of the solvent used may be an amount ena¬bling sufficient stirring of the reaction system. However, the amount is ordinarily 0.05 to 10 liters, preferably 0.5 to 2 liters relative to 1 mole of the raw material compound rep¬resented by the general formula (1). Use of a solvent of too low polarity is not desired because it reduces the solubility<br><br>
of oxidizing reagent (oxidized bromine compound), which may retard the reaction.<br>
The reaction may be conducted by feeding, at one time, materials necessary in the reaction, such as raw material compound represented by the general formula (1), catalyst, an oxidized bromine compound represented by the general formula (2), ammonia or ammonium salt, solvent and the like. However, from the standpoint of easier removal of the heat generated in the reaction, it is preferred to use, for example, a proc¬ess which comprises feeding the oxidized bromine compound represented by the general formula (2), in a solid form per se in portions, a process which comprises making the oxidized bromine compound represented by the general formula (2) into a slurry using a solvent (e.g. water) and then adding the slurry gradually, or a process which comprises adding drop-wise an aqueous solution or hot aqueous solution of the oxi¬dized bromine compound represented by the general formula (2); and it is particularly preferred to use a process which comprises adding dropwise an aqueous solution or hot aqueous solution of the oxidized bromine compound represented by the<br><br>
general formula (2) .<br>
The temperature of the reaction is 50°C to the reflux temperature of the solvent used, preferably 70°C to the re¬flux temperature of the solvent used, particularly preferably<br>
70°C to 100°C.<br>
Incidentally, when the reaction is conducted at high temperatures, heat may be generated vigorously with the vig¬orous proceeding of the reaction, depending upon the scale of the reaction. Therefore, it is advantageous in some cases to, for example, carefully set the reaction temperature low or dropwise add the present raw material compound into the reac¬tion system.<br>
The time of the reaction is not restricted particularly. However, it is preferred to be 1 to 30 hours from the stand¬point of, for example, suppression of by-product formation.<br>
According to the present reaction, an aromatic nitrile compound represented by the general formula (3) is formed at a high selectivity under mild conditions without using any special reactor or an excessive amount of an oxidizing re¬agent (oxidized bromine compound) or a nitrogen source.  The<br><br>
obtained aromatic nitrile compound represented by the general formula (3) is a compound which is useful as an intermediate for medicine, agricultural chemical, etc.<br>
