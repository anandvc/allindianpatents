				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel glycosyl-D-fructoses of formula I and isomers thereof,<br>
wherein, R1, R2,R3,R4,R5,R6 is hydrogen, hydroxyl or ester amide, alkyl and alkyl ether protected or unprotected monosaccharide, disaccharide, anhydro sugar, olefinic sugar, deoxy sugar, modified sugar and mixture thereof,<br>
R7 is hydrogen, methyl or CH2OR10;<br>
R8 is hydrogen or methyl;<br>
R9 and R10 is hydrogen or glycosyl moiety<br>
More particularly it relates to the glycosyl-D-fructoses, polymorphic forms, salts con.aining such compounds and compositions having such compounds as active ingredients. It also relates to the process of preparation of such compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glycosyl-D-fructoses, also termed as "fructo oligosaccharides" comprises a large class of oligosaccharides, which have been isolated from the various honeydews. Most of these compounds are water-soluble and crystalline in nature having low optical rotations and have a slightly sweet to very sweet taste.<br>
D-Raffinose and D-melezitose are the most commonly found fructo oligosaccharides isolated from the natural sources. Most of the fructo oligosaccharides isolated have been put to various pharmaceutical uses such as bifidus factor [Okhusa, Toshifumi; Ozaki, Yoshinori; Satochifumi; Miken,<br>
Katasuhika; Ikeda, Hiroshi. Digestion, 1995, 56, 415-20] and anti-cariogenic agents [Mikuni, Katsuhiko; Fujita, Takateru; Osawa, Takeshi; Aoyama, Yoko; Hara, Kozo; Hashimoto, Hitoshi. JP 03 083 992]. Among all isolated fructo oligosaccharides, raffinose, lactosucrose and melezitose have been used in health food materials [Hayakawa, Kunihiko; Omura, Kazutaka; Mizutani, Jun; Shirayanagi, Satoru; Kato, Yasuhito; Ikeda, Nagisa. JP 03 151 854], [Uchida, Yukio; Iritani, Satoshi; Mayake, Toshio. JP 07 298 833], as low cariogenic sugar substitute [Biton Jacques; Michael-Jean, Marc; Le Beller, Dominique; Pelenc, Vincent; Paul, Francois; Monsan, Pierre, F; Gelf, Gerard. Ann. NY. Acad. Sci. 1995, 750 (Enzyme Engineering XII), 312-14], as well as food substituents for various animals [Satoya, Hiroaki. JP 05 003 758] and [Kihara, Minoru; Mino, Riyuusuke. JP 07 203 868]. They have been used as osteoporosis preventing agents [Ohta, Atsutane; Takizawa, Toshio. EP 0753302]. They have also been used as prophylaxis for hepatopathy and as laxatives [Suga, Tatsuhiko; Kobayashi, Yoichi; Sonoike, Yoshiko; Terajima, Tsuneo; Mutai, Masahiko. JP 62 220 169]. Sulfated Raffinose derivatives have also been reported as antiarteriosclerotic agent [Hosang, Markus; Iberg, Niggi; Tschopp Thomas, Beat; Wessel-Hans, Peter. EP 504645]. Raffinose and Melibiose have also been used as carcinostatic Pharmaceuticals [Watanabe, Atsushi; Nukada, Akira. JP 57 077 620]. Lactosucrose has been used as an active ingredient in atopic dermatitis [Watanabe, Atsushi; Nukada, Akira. JP 11 124 390].<br>
Coronary heart disease is a multifactorial disease in which the incidence and severity are affected by the lipid profile, the presence of diabetes and the sex of the subject. Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of death in the industrialized countries. The primary cause of CHD is arteriosclerotic, a disease characterized by the deposition of lipids, including cholesterol, in the arterial vessel wall, resulting in a narrowing of the vessel passages and ultimately hardening of the vascular system. There are two types of cholesterol mainly present in the human body, among which the harmful cholesterol is low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Several clinical studies have established that lowering of LDL-cholesterol in mammal is an effective way to treat and prevent<br>
heart attacks, sudden death and angina. Lowering LDL-cholesterol is now one of the primary objectives of medicinal chemists for treating patients who have hypercholesterolemia, or who have a tendency to develop cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease. It is therefore recommended that the compounds which increase high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL) and therefore HDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol ratio (H/C) are effective curative agents against hypercholesterolemia.<br>
Recently it has been reported that, lactic acid bacteria present in the body produce an abundant variety of exopolysaccharides (EPS's), which provide an important contribution to human health by acting as prebiotic substrates, nutraceuticals, cholesterol lowering agents or immunomodulants [Van, Hijum; Sacha Adrianus Fokke Taco Groningen; Van, Geel-Schutten; Gerritdina, Hendrika; Dijkhuizen; Lubbert; Rahaoui; Hakim. US 6,730,502]. These compounds are also synthesized using extracellular sucrase enzymes, fructosyltransferases and glucosyltransferases. These fructosyltransferases have already been used for the chemoenzymatic preparation of various fructo-oligosaccharides. For example maltosylfructose has been prepared by using levansucrase from Bacillus subtilis [Jimenez-Estrada, M; Cassani, J; Lopez-Munguia, A. Biocatal. Biotransform. 1999,16 (6), 475-485],<br>
A number of reports appeared in the literature for the use of fructose containing oligosaccharides as prebiotic substrates [ACS Symposium Series, 2003, 849 (oligosaccharide in food and agriculture), 76-89], nutraceuticals. However their use in the treatment of metabolic disorders like hypercholesterolemia has not been explored. As a part of the ongoing research program to develop antihyperlipidemic agents, the present inventors set out to explore the pharmaceutical potentiality of several glycosyl-D-fructoses as antihyperlipidemic agents. A series of chemically synthesized and commercially available novel fructose containing oligosaccharides have been evaluated for their antihyperlipidemic activity.<br>

EXAMPLE 6<br>
ANTIHYPERLIPIDEMIC ACTIVITY OF COMPOUNDS (la-Ik)<br>
Male golden Syrian hamsters weighing 120-130g were divided into hyperlipidemic and hyperlipidemic plus drug treated groups. Each group consisted of the eight animals. Hyperlipidemia was produced by feeding with high fat diet (HFD). Hyperlipidemic hamsters had a free access to the HFD and water ad lib during the entire period of the experiment. The test samples were given orally at dose of 100mg/kg using water as a drug vehicle from day 4 to day 10 (7 days) in the HFD hamsters.<br>
Normal hamsters fed with HFD and given drug vehicle (water) only served as control animals. Body weight and diet intake of each animal group was recorded daily to check the effect of the drug on food intake and body weight of the animals. At the end of experiment i.e. on the 10th day, the blood of the non fasted animals were withdrawn in two sets of tubes in which one set contains<br>
120)j| NaF (4.5 mg/ ml) and tubes were cooled to 0°C for 15 min. The cold plasma was separated and biological analysis of the plasma without NaF was performed on the same day for triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and High Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (HDL) using commercially available enzymatic diagnostic kits. Similarly the plasma containing NaF was assayed for glycerol (GLY) and free fatty acids (FFA) using Synchron CX-5 Clinical System Beckmann Coulter Instrument. The data was analyzed for its significance on Prism Software.<br>
Among the total eleven compounds tested, Compounds la, Ic, Id, Ij and Ik were found to possess antihyperlipidemic activity in terms of lowering triglyceride (TG) concentration and increase in HDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol ratio (H/C).<br>
Compound Ik was found to possess maximum lipid lowering activity at the dose of 100 mg. per kg. body weight as compared to control animals. Animals treated orally with this compound showed 51% lowering in TG concentration, significant increase of the plasma HDL by 59% thereby increase of HDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol ratio (H/C) by 38%.<br>
