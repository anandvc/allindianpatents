				<td>The invention relates to a method of making a three-phase transformer with triangular core structure and a three-phase transformer with triangular core structure thereof.<br>
Conventional three phase transformers are made with cut laminations of high permeability material such as silicon steel forming a top yoke, a bottom yoke and three limbs in the same plane. The wound coils with primary and secondary windings for each phase are inserted on each of said limbs to form the transformer.<br>
The invention provides a three-phase transformer whose magnetic core is formed with trapezium shaped laminates of high permeability material. The magnetic core consists of a triangular bottom yoke, an identical triangular top yoke and three limbs connecting the vertices of the triangular bottom yoke and triangular top yoke. The magnetic core structure of such a transformer look like a triangle projected upwards.<br>
The three-phase transformer made according to the invention uses reduced quantity of high permeability material in a particular transformer compared to that in a conventional three-phase transformer of the same rating. The quantity of transformer oil and steel sheets used are also considerably less than that in a conventional three-phase transformer of equivalent rating.<br><br>
Thus the invention provides a method of manufacturing a transformer with a triangular core structure comprising the steps of cutting laminations in the shape of trapeziums with predetermined sizes from a high permiability sheet material; stacking the said trapezium shaped laminations to form the four sides of three rectangular frames to obtain a triangular core structure with a bottom yoke, top yoke and three vertical limbs connecting the three vertices of said bottom yoke and top yoke; clamping the said bottom yoke with clamps; removing the said top yoke and introducing three wound coils comprising primary and secondary windings through each vertical limb; replacing the said top yoke and clamping the same with clamps and clamping the bottom clamps and top clamps by tie-rods to obtain a transformer with a triangular core structure.<br>
The invention also provides a transformer with a triangular core structure made by the method hereinabove described, comprising a triangular core structure made of high permeability laminations consisting of a triangular bottom yoke, a triangular top yoke and three vertical connecting limbs connecting the three vertices of the said bottom yoke and top yoke, a wound coil with primary and secondary windings for each phase around each vertical limb and clamps to hold the triangular core structure intact wherein the said bottom yoke, top yoke and vertical connecting limbs are formed with stacks of trapezium shaped laminations of high permeability -material-<br><br>
The   invention   will   be   described   further   with   reference   to   the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows the cutting lines in a strip of high permeability material to obtain trapezium shaped laminations.<br>
Figure 2 shows a typical trapezium shaped lamination.<br>
Figure 3 shows a rectangular frame formed by the trapezium shaped laminations shown in figure 2.<br>
Figure 4 shows an isometric view of a stack of rectangular frames of laminations shown in figure 3.<br>
Figure 5 shows a triangular core structure assembled with three stacks of rectangular frames of laminations shown in figure 4.<br>
Figure 6 shows a triangular core structure with clamps.<br>
Figure 7 shows the wound coils with primary and secondary windings for each phase of the transformer.<br>
Figure 8 shows the triangular core structure after removing the top yoke.<br><br>
Figure 9 shows the triangular core structure shown in figure 8 with wound coils inserted on each vertical limb.<br>
Figure 10 shows the triangular core structure shown in figure 9 with top yoke.<br>
Figure 11 shows an isometric view of the assembled transformer with triangular core structure according to the invention.<br>
Figure 12 shows the cross-sectional view of the assembled transformer with triangular core structure according to the invention.<br>
Trapezium shaped laminations (2, 2') are cut from strip of high permiability material (1) along the cutting lines shown in figure 1. The trapezium shaped laminations for forming bottom yoke (4) and top yoke (5) will be identical and the trapezium shaped laminations for forming each of the vertical limbs (6) will be identical. These trapezium shaped laminations are held together to form a frame (3) and such frames (3) are stacked to form each side of a triangular core structure (7) with a bottom yoke (4), top yoke (5) and vertical limbs (6) at the vertices of said triangular core structure. The triangular core structure is provided with bottom clamps (8) for holding the bottom yoke (4) and top clamps (9) for holding the top yoke (5). These bottom clamps (8) and top clamps (9) are held together by tie-rods (11). Wound coils (10) are made with primary and secondary windings in a conventional manner. The top yoke (5) is removed by removing the top clamps (9) and the wound coils (10)<br><br>
are introduced on each vertical limb (6). The top yoke (5) is replaced and clamped with top clamps (9). The bottom clamps (8) and top clamps are held together by tightening the tie rods (11) to complete the three phase transformer with triangular core structure.<br>
The core structure of the transformer according to the invention is preferably made with laminations of cold rolled grain oriented high permeability material. However it can also be made from laminations obtained from thin film high permeability material or any other high permeability material.<br>
The three-phase transformer according to the invention considerably reduces the quantity of high permeability material used resulting in reduced cost and reduced magnetic loss in the transformer. The cost of steel sheets is also reduced. Thus the transformer according to the invention is more efficient and cost effective compared to conventional three phase transformers.<br><br><br><br>
