				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a data processing device adaptable in an ad-hoc<br>
network. The invention further relates to an ad-hoc network for interchange of<br>
information between an application and central service.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Data processing devices are arranged in networks or are connected to networks<br>
so that information (data) can be interchanged between the data processing<br>
devices in the networks. The data processing devices (computers, PDAs, servers,<br>
printers, gateways etc.), including the communication components (telephones,<br>
VoIP telephones, searching systems, etc.) in the form of data processing devices,<br>
have a respective unique address, these addresses being able to be used by<br>
each network element (data processing device) to interchange information with<br>
another network element in the same network.<br>
Networks frequently contain, besides the data processing devices, central<br>
services which are often also called "servers" or are installed on "servers", the<br>
central services being used by applications which are installed on the individual<br>
data processing devices. In this context, information is interchanged between a<br>
central service of this kind and an application which uses the central service.<br>
Normally, one and the same central service is available to a plurality of<br>
applications and hence a plurality of data processing devices for use, for example<br>
an e-mail server produced as a central service stores and conveys all electronic<br>
messages (e-mails, etc.) which are interchanged by the applications (in this case<br>
these are e-mail programs) on the connected data processing devices.<br><br>
A special case of the networks described is what are known as<br>
"ad-hoc networks", where the data processing devices arranged<br>
in an ad-hoc network frequently change. An example of an ad-hoc<br>
network of this kind is what are known as "WLAN hotspots", in<br>
which all data processing devices which are situated within the<br>
radio range of the transmission/reception device can be part of<br>
the ad-hoc network. Data processing devices, particularly those<br>
with a wireless connection for data transmission, may even form<br>
an ad-hoc network without a central infrastructure ("hotspot")<br>
as soon as at least two data processing devices connect to one<br>
another and can interchange information. Another example of ad-<br>
hoc networks is what are known as "peer-to-peer networks", in<br>
which some (at least two) data processing devices in a network<br>
of any size (e.g. the internet) enter into a logical<br>
relationship with one another. Peer-to-peer networks of this<br>
kind are frequently used for file interchange, for example, or<br>
else for voice data communication ("VoIP telephony"), without<br>
using a circuit-switched network (telephone network) to do so.<br>
It has been found to be a drawback of ad-hoc networks that the<br>
applications which are normally used and installed on the data<br>
processing devices are equipped with a data interface for a<br>
central service or for a few central services. When a data<br>
processing device of this kind with an application of this kind<br>
is introduced into an (another) ad-hoc network the application<br>
can be operated successively in this ad-hoc network only if an<br>
appropriate central service is available or can be contacted in<br>
this ad-hoc network. In the example of the e-mail servers, this<br>
means that all e-mail applications in the ad-hoc network need<br>
to have a connection to an e-mail server, with it<br>
understandably needing to be ensured that<br><br><br>
an e-mail server of this kind is actually present or can be contacted in the<br>
respective ad-hoc network.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to ensure or improve operation of the applications<br>
provided for a central service in ad-hoc networks.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object is achieved by a data processing device and an ad-hoc network<br>
according to the features of the invention.<br>
The object is achieved by providing a data processing device for use in an ad-hoc<br>
network, having an application for processing first information, the application<br>
for processing the first information being equipped with a data interface for a<br>
central service. The data processing device is equipped with a representative<br>
entity, where the representative entity is connected to the application via a first<br>
data link for the purpose of interchanging the first information, the<br>
representative entity is connected to a plurality of further data processing<br>
devices via second data links for the purpose of interchanging second<br>
information via the ad-hoc network, the representative entity is designed to form<br>
the first information from the second information and to form the second<br>
information from the first information, and the first information is interchanged<br>
between the application and the representative entity using the data interface.<br>
The application installed on the data processing device can therefore also be<br>
operated in ad-hoc networks in which the relevant central service is not or not<br>
yet available.<br><br><br>
The object is also achieved by providing an ad-hoc network which contains at<br>
least a first and a second of the previously described data processing devices,<br>
the application on the first data processing device being designed to interchange<br>
information with the representative entity of the second data processing device.<br>
In an ad-hoc network of this kind, the representative entity of the second data<br>
processing device is therefore able to provide the functionality of the central<br>
service for the application on the first data processing device. If the interchange<br>
then takes place via the first representative entity, the latter then forms the<br>
central service for the first application, which means that in this case even if the<br>
data processing device changes to another ad-hoc network any existing<br>
registration with the service (formed by the first representative entity) by the<br>
first application can persist.<br>
Advantageous refinements of the data processing device can be found in the<br>
features of preferred embodiments of the invention. The features and<br>
advantages described therein apply mutatis mutandis to the inventive ad-hoc<br>
network too.<br>
If the central service is a service for electronic messages and the first information<br>
is electronic messages, a user of the data processing device with the familiar<br>
application can also interchange electronic messages in networks in which it is<br>
not possible to contact a central service (central server) for electronic messages.<br>
If the representative entity is designed to forward the electronic messages<br>
received from the application as first information to at least one of the further<br>
data processing devices, the received electronic message comprising an address<br><br>
for the at least one further data processing device, and the representative entity<br>
effecting the forwarding to the data processing device defined by this address,<br>
then the data processing devices in the ad-hoc network can use the familiar<br>
application, set up for a central server (central service), to interchange electronic<br>
messages with one ...<br><br>
another without first setting up a connection to a central<br>
service. In this case, the representative entity is<br>
advantageously designed to buffer-store electronic messages<br>
which are to be interchanged, as a result of which it is also<br>
possible to continue to operate applications requiring a<br>
central service (server) as an information store unchanged.<br>
This produces a comprehensive functionality if the electronic<br>
messages are e-mail messages, fax messages, appointment<br>
elements or calendar entries.<br>
If the application is an apparatus for accessing a resource,<br>
where at least one of the second data links allows the resource<br>
to be used by at least one of the further data processing<br>
devices, then one and the same resource can be made available<br>
to a plurality of or all data processing devices in the ad-hoc<br>
network. This is particularly advantageous if the resource<br>
which can be used by the at least one further data processing<br>
device is a printer or a network access point (router,<br>
gateway) , because these resources do not then need to be<br>
provided separately for each data processing device, but rather<br>
can be used alternately or simultaneously by a plurality of<br>
data processing devices. In this context, the representative<br>
entity is advantageously provided with an authorization<br>
apparatus, the authorization apparatus being designed to enable<br>
and/or disable the resource, which can be accessed via the<br>
application, for at least one of the further data processing<br>
devices. An authorization apparatus of this kind firstly allows<br>
abuse of resources to be avoided and secondly allows the use of<br>
resources for which payment is required only by those data<br>
processing devices or their applications where the payment of<br>
usage fees is assured.<br>
A user of the data processing device can obtain information<br>
about the state of the other data processing devices or about<br>
the availability of their users if the application<br><br>
is designed to process presence information from at least one<br>
of the further data processing devices, and the representative<br>
entity is set up to receive the presence information as second<br>
information via at least one of the second data links from at<br>
least one of the further data processing devices and to forward<br>
the presence information as first information to the<br>
application. In this context, the application is advantageously<br>
designed to generate presence information about the data<br>
processing device and/or a user of the data processing device<br>
as first information, and the representative entity is set up<br>
to send the generated presence information as second<br>
information via at least one of the second data links to at<br>
least one of the further data processing devices. This allows<br>
the representative entity to produce and send the presence<br>
information for the further data processing devices or their<br>
users, so that the applications on the further data processing<br>
devices can also be operated without access to a central<br>
presence server (central service). In this case, customary<br>
applications and applications which are frequently already<br>
present can continue to be operated if the applications are set<br>
up to interchange the presence information as first information<br>
on the basis of the SIP protocol, and at least one of the<br>
representative entities has an SIP presence registration<br>
function and an SIP presence server function.<br>
If the application comprises a display function or a processing<br>
function for addresses, and the representative entity is<br>
designed to transmit the address of at least one of the further<br>
data processing devices as first information to the<br>
application, a user of the application can access the display<br>
function or the processing function in order to access the<br>
address of the at least one further data processing device<br>
without the need for this address to be transmitted manually to<br>
the application. The administration is simplified further by<br>
virtue of the representative<br><br>
entity being set up to retrieve the address which is to be<br>
transmitted to the application as second information from the<br>
at least one further data processing device, as a result of<br>
which even data processing devices which have recently been<br>
introduced into the ad-hoc network can automatically be<br>
accessed by the application using their addresses. In this<br>
case, the application is advantageously a display and<br>
processing program for electronic messages, with the address<br>
then ideally being able to be used to send electronic messages.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of a data processing device based on the<br>
invention are explained below with reference to the drawings<br>
and serve simultaneously to explain exemplary embodiments of<br>
ad-hoc networks based on the invention. In the drawings:<br>
figure 1 shows a network with three data processing devices,<br>
figure 2 shows a data processing device with an electronic<br>
message application and a representative entity with<br>
a mail proxy component and a mail queue,<br>
figure 3 shows a network with three data processing devices,<br>
two resources and a further network, and<br>
figure 4 shows two data processing devices with applications<br>
for interchanging presence information in a network.<br>
Figure 1 shows the data processing devices DV1, DV2, DV3 which<br>
are arranged in an ad-hoc network NW and can use this ad-hoc<br>
network NW to transmit (interchange) information (data) among<br>
one another. In the present exemplary embodiment, the ad-hoc<br>
network NW is what is known as a "wireless LAN", that is to say<br>
a network based on radio technology. In this arrangement, the<br>
data processing devices DV1, DV2, DV3 shown can interchange<br>
information with one another directly without<br><br>
the need for a central entity (router, network node etc.). As<br>
an alternative to the wireless ad-hoc network NW shown, it is<br>
naturally also possible to use a wired network. The particular<br>
distinguishing feature of the ad-hoc network NW is that all the<br>
data processing devices DV1, DV2, DV3 which are currently able<br>
to contact one another "at random" according to their radio<br>
range or are arranged in the same radio cell are part of the<br>
ad-hoc network NW or form this network. The inventive data<br>
processing devices DV1, DV2, DV3 can naturally also be operated<br>
alternatively in a non-ad-hoc network; in this case, it may be<br>
necessary to register with a network node which is to be used.<br>
The data processing devices DV1, DV2, DV3 shown are<br>
respectively provided with an application AW1, AW2, AW3, the<br>
data processing devices DVl, DV2 being equipped with a<br>
respective representative entity SI1, SI2. In principle, the<br>
data processing devices DV4, DV5, DV6, DV7, DV8, DV9 described<br>
in figures 2 to 4 and also the networks NW2, NW3, NW4 shown<br>
therein are also of similar design to the previously described<br>
data processing devices DV1, DV2, DV3 and to the ad-hoc network<br>
NW, respectively. If the data processing devices and components<br>
described below are not described differently, the features and<br>
properties described above apply to them.<br>
The text below uses the data processing device DV4 shown<br>
schematically in figure 2 to explain the operation of an<br>
application ENA for interchanging electronic messages in an ad-<br>
hoc network. The application ENA is what is known as a "mail<br>
client", that is to say an application program which provides a<br>
user interface for sending and receiving electronic messages,<br>
the electronic messages including not only the known e-mails<br>
but also appointment and calendar entries, fax messages, voice<br>
files (particularly from what are known as "unified messaging"<br><br>
systems) etc. In the present exemplary embodiment, the program<br>
Microsoft Outlook is used; it is naturally also possible to use<br>
another application program of this kind.<br>
The application ENA is in a form such that it interchanges the<br>
electronic messages with a central service, in the present<br>
exemplary embodiment the Microsoft Exchange Server. In this<br>
case, a central service of this kind forms the basis for a<br>
large number of similar or identical applications according to<br>
the type of the application ENA. The application ENA is<br>
equipped with a data interface which is provided for<br>
interchanging information (data) with the central service via a<br>
network. To this end, in the "server-based" application<br>
instance, the data interface is connected to the central<br>
service directly, e.g. by means of a data channel.<br>
The data processing device DV4 is equipped with a<br>
representative entity SI4 which is connected to the application<br>
ENA via the data interface. The application ENA thus now<br>
interchanges information (data) with the representative entity<br>
SI4 via the data interface instead of interchanging the<br>
information with the central service (which is not present in<br>
the ad-hoc network under consideration).<br>
Like all the data processing devices shown in the exemplary<br>
embodiments, the data processing device DV4 has a search<br>
function for finding other data processing devices in the ad-<br>
hoc network. Search functions of this kind are known from what<br>
are known as "peer-to-peer networks" and are not described in<br>
more detail at this juncture. A repeatedly performed search for<br>
other data processing devices provides the data processing<br>
device DV4 with the addresses (network addresses) of other data<br>
processing devices which are likewise equipped with a<br>
representative entity in the style of the representative entity<br>
SI4 and with an application in the style of or similar to<br><br>
the application ENA. This provides the representative entity<br>
SI4 with the communication addresses (network addresses) of the<br>
other data processing devices and with the access parameters of<br>
the representative entities installed there (if present).<br>
A user of the application ENA now writes an electronic message,<br>
for example an e-mail message or an appointment request, and<br>
activates the "send" function on the application ENA. This<br>
causes the application ENA to transmit the electronic message<br>
as first information to the representative entity SI4, where<br>
the electronic message is received by the module MPK (mail<br>
proxy component). In this context, the module MPK interchanges<br>
the first information with the application ENA in the same way<br>
in which it is also done by a central service (not present<br>
here). The module MPK then decides whether the data processing<br>
device DV4 is currently part of a network (ad-hoc network)<br>
without a central service for processing electronic messages,<br>
or is part of a network in which a central service of this kind<br>
is available. In the present exemplary embodiment, a central<br>
service is not available in the network, which means that the<br>
module MPK forwards the electronic message to another module MQ<br>
(mail queue); otherwise, the central service would be used.<br>
Here, the electronic message is buffer-stored and the receiver<br>
address contained in the electronic message is used to check<br>
whether the desired receiver is a user of another application<br>
available in the network for interchanging electronic messages.<br>
In situations in which this is not the case, the module MQ<br>
stores the electronic message either until an application<br>
associated with the desired receiver is available in the<br>
network or until an appropriate central service (mail server)<br>
is available. In the present exemplary embodiment, however, it<br>
is possible to forward the electronic<br><br>
message to another data processing device. For this reason, the<br>
electronic message is converted into second information by the<br>
representative entity SI4, and for this conversion the<br>
electronic message is provided with the address information of<br>
the further data processing device. The electronic message is<br>
now transmitted via the network to the further data processing<br>
device, is received by the representative entity there, is<br>
buffer-stored and, if required, is converted into the data<br>
format of the application there. The electronic message can<br>
then be retrieved by the application there from the buffer<br>
store in the representative entity there.<br>
Alternatively, the application installed on the further data<br>
processing device can also interchange data with the<br>
representative entity SI4 of the data processing device DV4<br>
directly. The further application then needs to be registered<br>
as a "client" with the representative entity SI4 in the same<br>
way as the application ENA.<br>
Networks frequently have resources available, such resources<br>
being connected to a data processing device and being able to<br>
be used by at least one application from the connected data<br>
processing device. Figure 3 shows a network NW2 containing the<br>
data processing devices DV5, DV6, DV7. The data processing<br>
device DV5 has the resource PR connected to it (PR = printer),<br>
this resource being used by the application AW5 (in this case:<br>
what is known as a "printer driver"). The data processing<br>
device DV7 has the resource GW (GW = gateway) connected to it,<br>
with the resource GW allowing the change of information to a<br>
further network NW3 . In this case, the resource GW is used on<br>
the network NW2 by the application AW7 from the data processing<br>
device DV7. In this context, the application AW7 is what is<br>
known as a "driver", which is designed to interact with a<br>
central service program, in this case what is known as "gateway<br>
server software".<br><br>
The text below describes the way in which the application AW6<br>
(a word processing program) installed on the data processing<br>
device DV6 uses the resource PR (printer) which is connected to<br>
the data processing device DV5.<br>
The operating system on the data processing device DV6 uses the<br>
connections to the network NW2 to search the network for a<br>
central service "print server" , that is to say for a network-<br>
based service for printing documents. Such a search message<br>
transmitted in this context is received by the representative<br>
entity SI5, where the application AW5 (printer driver) is<br>
connected to the consequently available resource PR (printer).<br>
The representative entity SI5 therefore responds to the search<br>
message, so that it is registered as "printer server" with the<br>
application AW6. To print a document, the application AW6 sends<br>
the document as second information via the network NW2 to the<br>
representative entity SI5, where the document is received and<br>
converted into first information. This conversion involves the<br>
document being converted into an internal data format for the<br>
data processing device DV5, so that the document to be printed<br>
is received by a data interface of the application AW5 in the<br>
same way as if the application AW6 were a word processing<br>
program installed on the data processing device DV5.<br>
Consequently, the document is printed by the application AW5<br>
using the resource PR. It goes without saying that status<br>
messages from the resource PR which are produced in the process<br>
are returned to the application AW6 via the same route.<br>
It is subsequently assumed that the application AW6 is a<br>
communication application for a voice data network (VoIP<br>
network). In a similar way to the example described above, the<br>
application AW6 can then use the representative entity SI7 and<br>
the application AW7 to use the resource GW for communication<br>
links to communication partners in the network NW3. In<br><br>
this context, the representative entity SI7 is what is known as<br>
a "proxy", which uses the application AW7 and hence the<br>
resource GW in the data processing device DV7 instead of a<br>
locally installed application. In so doing, the representative<br>
entity SI7 "terminates" the connections which are routed from<br>
the application AW6 via the network NW2 to the communication<br>
partner. The second information (useful data) interchanged via<br>
this connection is converted by the representative entity SI7<br>
into a further data stream (further connection), which is<br>
routed via the application AW7 and the resource GW to the<br>
communication partner in the network NW3 . It goes without<br>
saying that the use of the representative entity SI7 is<br>
dependent on authentication which has taken place beforehand,<br>
which is used to ensure that the application AW6 is authorized<br>
to use the resource GW.<br>
Figure 4 is now used to explain the way in which the data<br>
processing devices DV8, DV9 in the network NW4 interchange<br>
presence information among one another without a central<br>
presence server. In this context, the applications WMl, WM2 are<br>
applications which are set up to process and display presence<br>
information which said applications respectively interchange<br>
with a central service (presence server) as first information.<br>
Instead of being connected to the central service the<br>
applications WMl, WM2 - in this exemplary embodiment they are<br>
the known Microsoft Windows Messenger - are connected to the<br>
representative entities SI8, SI9 by means of a respective data<br>
interface. In the present exemplary embodiment, the first<br>
information interchanged via the data interfaces is<br>
respectively interchanged on the basis of the SIP protocol. In<br>
a similar way to an SIP compliant central service (which is not<br>
present in this case), the representative entities SI8, SI9<br>
respectively have an SIP registrar RG8, RG9, an (internal) SIP<br>
presence server PS8, PS9 and what is known as an "SIP proxy"<br>
PR8, PR9.<br><br>
It is subsequently assumed that the data processing devices<br>
DV8, DV9, having started, have respectively searched for other<br>
data processing devices of the same type and are respectively<br>
in possession of the communication address (access parameter)<br>
of the respective other data processing device DV8, DV9 shown.<br>
In a first step, the application WM1 registers with the SIP<br>
register RG8, and the application WM2 registers with the SIP<br>
registrar RG9. Whereas, when a central service (central<br>
presence server) is present, each application WM1, WM2<br>
registers with the SIP registrar of the (one) central service,<br>
the representative entity SI8 is this central service for the<br>
application WM1, while the representative entity SI9 forms the<br>
central service (central presence server) for the application<br>
WM2 .<br>
For this exemplary embodiment, it is assumed that the<br>
application WM1 is to be used to monitor the presence state of<br>
a user of the application WM2, that is to say to establish<br>
whether or not the application WM2 can be used to contact the<br>
user of the application WM2, for example. To monitor the<br>
application WM2, the application WM1 uses its data interface to<br>
send a "Subscribe" message S8A to the SIP presence server PS8<br>
of the representative entity SI8. In this context, the<br>
"Subscribe" message S8A is addressed to the representative<br>
entity SI8 and is thus available as first information in a<br>
first data format. It is converted into second information by<br>
the representative entity SI8 by (re)addressing it to the data<br>
processing device DV9, and is then sent to the SIP proxy PR9<br>
via the network NW4. For the SIP presence server PS8, the SIP<br>
proxy PR9 represents the application WM2 to be monitored, and<br>
receives the converted "Subscribe" message S8A as "Subscribe"<br>
message S8B. The representative entity SI9 recognizes that the<br>
"Subscribe" message S8B relates to the application WM2,<br>
addresses it to the "internal"<br><br>
application WM2 and forwards it thereto as "Subscribe" message<br>
S8C.<br>
The application WM2 checks whether the requesting application<br>
WM1 is authorized to monitor its state and from then on reports<br>
any change of state by sending a respective appropriate<br>
"Notify" message N9A to that SIP proxy PR9 from which the<br>
application WM2 has received the Subscribe message S8C. A<br>
"Notify" message N9A of this kind which has been received from<br>
the SIP proxy PR9 is evaluated by the SIP proxy PR9, where it<br>
is established that this "Notify" message N9A is a response<br>
message to the "Subscribe" message S8B from the present server<br>
PS8. Accordingly, the "Notify" message N9A is converted<br>
(readdressed) and transmitted to the presence server PS8 as<br>
"Notify" message N9B. There, the correspondingly changed state<br>
of the application WM2 is registered and, on the basis of the<br>
"Subscribe" message S8A received earlier, is converted into a<br>
"Notify" message N9C which is sent to the application WM1 and<br>
is displayed or processed there.<br>
In another embodiment, the representative entity SI8 is<br>
designed such that in networks which contain a central presence<br>
service the "internal" presence server PS8 is not used, but<br>
rather the messages from the application WM1 which are sent to<br>
it are forwarded to the central presence service which is then<br>
provided.<br>
If the data processing device DV8 holds a further application<br>
(not shown) with an address directory, for example in the<br>
manner of the application ENA outlined using figure 2, the<br>
representative entity SI8 can temporarily enter the names and<br>
the communication addresses of the users of other data<br>
processing devices (in this case data processing device DV9<br>
with application WM2) into the address directory of the<br>
respective application. The "dynamic" result of this is<br>
convenient access to all those applications<br><br>
and users which are currently available via the ad-hoc network<br>
and have previously been found using a presence service or a<br>
search function. This also relates to those other data<br>
processing devices which have "registered" themselves with the<br>
data processing device DV8 without a search.<br><br>
