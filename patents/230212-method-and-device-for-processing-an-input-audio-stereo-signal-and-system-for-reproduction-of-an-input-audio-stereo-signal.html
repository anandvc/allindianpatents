				<td>METHOD AND DEVICE FOR PROCESSING AN INPUT AUDIO STEREO SIGNAL<br>
AND SYSTEM FOR REPRODUCTION OF AN INPUT AUDIO STEREO SIGNAL<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method, a device and a<br>
system for processing an audio stereo signal, and in particular<br>
the present invention relates to a method and device for<br>
processing an input audio stereo signal and system for<br>
reproduction of an input audio stereo signal as described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A large number of methods and systems exist intended for<br>
faithful reproduction of the sound experienced by a listener at<br>
the recording position. The system coming closest to virtually<br>
move the listener to the recording location, i.e. to convey an<br>
impression of the true location of the different sound sources<br>
of the original event, is the binaural method of recording and<br>
the binaural method of reproduction (headphones). This method<br>
has as its shortcomings in that the sound is interpreted by ear<br>
canals both in the recording stage and in the reproduction<br>
stage and in a worst case even by two sets of pinna (outer<br>
ears) on its way to the listeners brain where the sound<br>
information is to be interpreted. There are solutions that<br>
utilize a simplified recording method including a foam ball of<br>
head size with the microphone elements on each side of the ball<br>
instead of a replica of a head. This is a compromise to gain<br>
sound quality but loses the distinction of localization between<br>
front and back and the elevation. All other ways than the<br>
binaural method to record and reproduce sound is a creation of<br>
an imaginary sound image that is truly subjective. This is the<br>
case for both the recording stage and the reproduction stage.<br><br>
As opposed to previously known methods, the object of the<br>
reproduction stage should only be to convey the electrical<br>
differences to the listener's auditory system with minimal<br>
loss or addition of information. The place where the stereo<br>
sound image is created is then the recording and/or mixing<br>
stage. The stereo image might be made as a truthful, but still<br>
subjective, interpretation of the sound experienced by a<br>
listener in a venue, or as an illusion of an imaginary event<br>
that never have physically occurred or a mixture of the two.<br>
Most reproduction systems of today are based on a pair of<br>
widely spaced loudspeakers, and true reproduction of the<br>
electrical stereo signal, both in terms of relative intensity<br>
between the sound waves perceived by the ears of the listener<br>
and the time difference between these, can at best be<br>
perceived only at one single position in relation to the<br>
loudspeakers. These methods are often subject to incorrect<br>
translation of the electrical stereo information dependant on<br>
the preferences of the separate loudspeakers and how the<br>
loudspeakers are positioned in relation to the listener.<br>
There is thus a need for a sound reproduction system that<br>
provides identical reproduction of the stereo sound image<br>
regardless of setup and quality of the loudspeakers.<br>
A system that solves this problem is described in the patent<br>
application WO01/39548, assigned to the applicant of the<br>
present invention, which discloses a method of processing and<br>
reproducing an input audio stereo signal. A side sigsnal is<br>
split into a first and a second intermediate signal, where the<br>
first intermediate signal is equal to the side signal and the<br>
second intermediate signal is equal to the first intermediate<br>
signal phase shifted 180°, a mid signal is attenuated by a<br>
facto α which compensates for imperfections in the balance<br><br>
between the mid and side signals appearing in the audio<br>
reproduction stage, the attenuated mid signal is added to both<br>
the first and the second intermediate signals, so as to form<br>
the output audio stereo signal, and the output stereo signal is<br>
directed to an audio stereo signal reproduction system<br>
comprising a pair of loudspeaker units located in close<br>
proximity to each other. The system described in W001/39548<br>
allows an audio stereo signal to be reproduced with a high<br>
degree of fidelity with high consistency in the perceived<br>
stereo image regardless of the quality of system.<br>
A problem with such a system with closely located<br>
loudspeaker units, however, is that at high frequencies, above<br>
1-5 kHz, the degree of fidelity in perceived stereo effect<br>
degrades or vanishes totally.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method for processing an audio stereo signal, which solves the<br>
above mentioned problem. This object is achieved by a method of<br>
processing an input audio stereo signal comprising two input<br>
signals, for reproduction of a processed stereo signal in an<br>
audio stereo reproduction system comprising at least one pair<br>
of loudspeaker elements, the method comprising the steps of :<br>
a) providing a mid input signal and a side input signal, b)<br>
producing a left output signal for transmission to a left<br>
loudspeaker in said pair, which is, or is equivalent to, the<br>
sum of the mid input signal and the side input signal, c)<br>
producing a right output signal for transmission to a right<br>
loudspeaker in said pair, which is, or is equivalent to, the<br><br>
sum of the mid input signal and the side signal phase shifted<br>
180°, the method further being characterised in the step of :<br>
at least a part of the side input signal or the mid input<br>
signal in the frequency range 4 kHz - 9 kHz is phase shifted at<br>
least 45° but no more than 135° relative to the other signal<br>
prior to or at the production of the left and right output<br>
signals in steps b) and c).<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
device for processing an audio stereo signal, which solves the<br>
above mentioned problem. This object is achieved by a device<br>
for processing an input audio stereo signal comprising two<br>
input signals, for reproduction of a processed stereo signal in<br>
an audio stereo reproduction system comprising at least one<br>
pair of loudspeaker elements, the device comprising : a) means<br>
for producing a left output signal for transmission to a left<br>
loudspeaker in said pair, which is, or is equivalent to, the<br>
sum of the mid input signal and the side input signal, b) means<br>
for producing a right output signal for transmission to a right<br>
loudspeaker in said pair, which is, or is equivalent to, the<br>
sum of the mid input signal and the side signal phase shifted<br>
180°, the device further being characterised in that it<br>
comprises: c) means for phase shifting at least a part of the<br>
side input signal or the mid input signal in the frequency<br>
range 4 kHz - 9 kHz at least 45° but no more than 135° relative<br>
to the other signal prior to or at the production of the left<br>
and right output signals in steps a) and b).<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
system for processing an audio stereo signal, which solves the<br>
above mentioned problem. This object is achieved by a system<br>
for reproduction of an input audio stereo signal comprising two<br>
input signals consisting of a mid input signal and a side<br>
input signal, or of a kind from which a mid input signal and a<br>
side input signal are derivable, such as a left input signal<br>
and a right input signal, comprising a pair of loudspeaker<br>
elements, the system further comprising : a) means for<br>
producing a left output signal for transmission to a left<br>
loudspeaker in said pair, which is, or is equivalent to, the<br>
sum of the mid input signal and the side input, signal, b) means<br>
for producing a right output signal for transmission to a right<br>
loudspeaker in said pair, which is, or is equivalent to, the<br>
sum of the- mid input signal and the side signal phase shifted<br>
180°, the system further being characterised in that it<br>
comprises: c) means for phase shifting at least a part of the<br>
side input signal or the mid input signal in the frequency<br>
range 4 kHz - 9 kHz at least 45° but no more than 135° relative<br>
to the other signal prior to or at the production of the left<br>
and right output signals in steps a) and b).<br>
According to the present invention, a left output signal<br>
for transmission to a left loudspeaker in a loudspeaker pair is<br>
produced, which signal is, or is equivalent to, the sum of a<br><br>
mid input signal M and a side input signal S, at least part of<br>
which side signal S or mid signal M being phase shifted<br>
approximately 45°-135° with respect to the other signal, and a<br>
right output signal for transmission to a right loudspeaker in<br>
said pair is produced, which signal is, or is equivalent to,<br>
the sum of the mid input signal M, and a 18 0° phase shifted<br>
side signal S, at least part of which side signal S or mid<br>
signal M being phase shifted approximately 45°-135° with<br>
respect to the other signal.<br>
This has the advantage that the phase difference that the<br>
present invention introduces into the stereo signal translates<br>
incoming level difference into phase difference between the<br>
stereo channels. This phase difference will be translated into<br>
a level difference when the stereo signal is played back<br>
through a loudspeaker pair. Level difference, in contrast to<br>
phase difference, is a strong localization cue for shorter<br>
wavelengths, and consequently the phase shift introduced by<br>
the present invention will improve the degree of fidelity in<br>
perceived stereo effect considerably.<br>
The mid input signal M may be attenuated by a factor a and/or<br>
the side input signal S may be amplified a factor (3 in the<br>
production of the left output signal and the right output<br>
signal. This has the advantage that a stereo audio signal<br>
composed of level difference for long wavelengths and phase<br>
difference for short wavelengths may be obtained, which signal<br>
will be played back through a loudspeaker pair as phase<br>
difference for low frequencies, which is a strong localization<br>
cue for low frequencies, and level difference for high<br>
frequencies, which, as mentioned above, is a strong<br>
localization cue for high frequencies.<br><br>
The input signals in the present invention may be a left input<br>
signal L and a right input signal R, in which case the mid<br>
input signal M is produced as the sum of the left input signal<br>
L and the right input signal R, and the side input signal is<br>
produced as the difference of the left input signal L and the<br>
right input signal R. This has the advantage that a<br>
conventional stereo signal may be used as input signals in the<br>
present invention.<br>
The loudspeaker elements may be closely located, and in<br>
particular the pair of loudspeaker elements may consist of a<br>
pair of identical loudspeaker elements being acoustically<br>
isolated from each other, and located within less than one<br>
quarter of the shortest wavelength emitted by the elements,<br>
or, if the shortest wavelength emitted by the elements is less<br>
than 68 cm, less than 17 cm. This has the advantage that the<br>
present invention is very well suited for use in a method and<br>
system as described in WO01/39548.<br>
The phase shift may be accomplished such that all of the side<br>
input signal S or the mid input signal M is phase shifted 45°-<br>
135°, preferably 90°..This may advantageously be accomplished<br>
by digital signal processing, e.g. by a Hilbert transform.<br>
Alternatively, the phase shift may be accomplished by a<br>
frequency dependent filter, such as an analogue all-pass<br>
filter. This has the advantage that a less expensive solution<br>
may be obtained for cost sensitive applications and/or<br>
applications where the processing time is critical.<br>
The mid input signal M may be delayed a time corresponding to<br>
the delay of the phase shifting means. This may facilitate the<br>
obtaining of a desired phase relation between the side input<br>
signal S and the mid input signal M.<br><br>

processing stereo signals;<br>

DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the functional principle for a prior art<br>
device for processing an audio stereo signal. The input audio<br>
stereo signal comprises a left input stereo signal L and a<br>
right input stereo signal R. The L and R signals are used to<br>
obtain a mid signal M, and a side signal S, corresponding to<br>
the sum of the left L and right R input stereo signals, and<br>
the difference between the left L and right R input stereo<br>
signals, respectively. The output stereo signal LOUT which is<br>
to be sent to a left sound reproducing unit, such as a<br>
loudspeaker, is the sum of the side signal, S, and the mid<br>
signal M multiplied by an attenuating factor a, while the<br>
output stereo signal ROUT, which is to be sent to a right sound<br>
reproducing unit is the sum of the inverted side signal, S,<br>
and the mid signal M multiplied by an attenuating factor a.<br>
The system described in fig. 1 allows an electrical audio<br>
stereo signal to be reproduced with a high degree of fidelity<br>
with high consistency in the perceived stereo image regardless<br>
of the quality of system. As stated above, however, the system<br><br>
in fig. 1 suffers from the problem that the degree of fidelity<br>
in perceived stereo effect degrades or vanishes totally at<br>
frequencies above 1-5 kHz.<br>
This is due to the fact that level difference in L0UT and ROUT<br>
resulting from the respective addition and subtraction of the<br>
S signal is transformed into phase difference when played back<br>
through the loudspeaker elements. This phase difference is a<br>
strong localization cue for low frequencies, and results in<br>
excellent stereo resolution for these lower frequencies. Due<br>
to the characteristics of the human ear, however, the ability<br>
to detect phase differences between two signals received by<br>
the left and the right ear, respectively, vanishes at high<br>
frequencies. The reason for this is the phase locking of the<br>
auditory nerve that tend to fire at a particular phase of a<br>
stimulating low frequency tone (
spikes per cycle for frequencies below about 1000 Hz. Inter-<br>
spike intervals tend to occur at integer multiples of the<br>
period of the tone. With high frequency tones (&gt; 4 - 5 kHz)<br>
phase locking gets weaker and then disappear, because the<br>
capacitance of inner hair cells prevents them from changing in<br>
voltage sufficiently rapidly. The lack of phase locking above<br>
4-5 kHz affirms that the system in fig. 1 conveys week<br>
localization cues for sounds containing only short wavelengths<br>
with only level difference between the stereo channels.<br>
The present invention seeks to solve the above problem with a<br>
device as illustrated in fig. 2. The device in fig. 2 is<br>
similar to the device in fig. 1 with the difference that in<br>
fig. 2 an extra unit 20 has been added. As in fig. 1, a mid<br>
signal M is obtained by summing the left L and right R input<br>
stereo signals, and a side signal S is obtained by subtracting<br>
the right input stereo signal R from the left input stereo<br><br>
signal L. The side signal S is then phase shifted -90° prior<br>
to the creation of the output stereo signals LOUT, and ROUT The<br>
output stereo signal LOOT is then obtained by taking the sum of<br>
the phase shifted side signal S and the mid signal M<br>
multiplied by an attenuating factor a, while the output stereo<br>
signal R0UT is obtained by subtracting the phase shifted side<br>
signal S from the mid signal M multiplied by an attenuating<br>
factor a. This is equal to taking the sum of an inverted phase<br>
shifted side signal S and the mid signal M multiplied by an<br>
attenuating factor a. Inverting the side signal is equivalent<br>
to negating it or phase shifting it 180°.<br>
The attenuation factor a would typically be -6 dB to -12dB. In<br>
a general case, however, the attenuation factor a is adapted<br>
to optimise the stereo effect perceived by the listener, and<br>
is allowed to vary in an interval from -3 dB to -15 dB.<br>
The phase shift may be accomplished by a digital signal<br>
processor, e.g. by a Hilbert transform. Digital signal<br>
processing has the advantage that a true 90° phase shift can<br>
be performed for all wavelengths and may be obtained with<br>
little or no amplitude change over frequency (use of analogue<br>
circuits may result in a phase drift in the audible spectra in<br>
the range of 500°-700° or more, however with a relative phase<br>
difference of 90° between the mid signal M and the side signal<br>
S). This type of phase shifting is particularly suitable for<br>
systems in which digital signal processing means already are<br>
present, and where the applications are not time critical.<br>
Further, it may be desirable to include a delay circuit in the<br>
device, shown as 21 in fig. 2, to delay the mid input signal M<br>
with a time corresponding to the processing time of the phase<br>
shifting means. This facilitates maintaining of the desired<br><br>
phase relation between the side input signal S and the mid<br>
input signal M.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The second embodiment of the present invention is a<br>
solution for applications where the phase shift is desired but<br>
the application is cost sensitive and/or where the processing<br>
time is critical, such as in professional recording studios.<br>
In the second embodiment, the mid signal M and side signal S<br>
is obtained as in fig. 2, and the side signal is then S<br>
altered by a unit 30 including a frequency dependent analogue<br>
all pass filter with its centre frequency set well above the<br>
shortest audible wavelength. This means that the phase shift<br>
is starting with only a few degrees at e.g. 500 Hz to reach<br>
+90° at e.g. 10 kHz. The phase response of the all pass filter<br>
is thus tailored to gradually translate the phase difference<br>
of the output stereo signal into level difference as the phase<br>
locking gets weaker for higher frequencies. As the phase<br>
response of an analogue filter rarely can be of negative<br>
nature the unit 30 further includes means to invert the signal<br>
to get the desired result of a phase shift of -90°. The phase<br>
shift should preferably be negative since otherwise the<br>
original L and R signals might be switched. An example of a<br>
phase response for the all pass filter is shown in fig. 4. As<br>
can be seen in the figure, the phase shift starts from<br>
substantially 0° at low frequencies to reach 90° at high<br>
frequencies (e.g. 10 kHz). It is also possible to create the<br>
frequency dependent phase shift with the aid of digital signal<br>
processing, however with the extra cost this might incur.<br>
The factor a in fig. 3 can be made frequency dependant so that<br>
the factor is different for separate drivers of, for example,<br>
different elements in a multi-way loudspeaker configuration.<br><br>
The mid signal M is then added to the phase shifted side<br>
signal S to form a first output signal, and the phase shifted<br>
side signal S is then subtracted from the mid signal M to form<br>
the second output signal.<br>
Generally, the method described in the present application<br>
could equivalently be used for any input terms which can be<br>
described as a linear transformation of the R and L signals or<br>
the M and S signals, but as a matter of convenience, the<br>
method has been exemplified using the M and S, and the R and L<br>
pictures, respectively. The method should therefore be<br>
interpreted as a method having an output, which is equivalent<br>
to Sp5+αM and-Sp5+αM, where Sp5 is the S signal phase shifted<br>
with 90°. As has been described, the M and S signals may be<br>
produced during an intermediate step in the process, but this<br>
does not have to be the case as long as the resulting output<br>
condition is fulfilled.<br>
In the above description the phase shift has been described as<br>
90°. This phase shift may however be any phase shift in an<br>
interval between 45°-135°. Further, in the above description<br>
the phase shift has been performed on the side signal S. It<br>
may however as well be performed on the mid signal M.<br>
Further, in the above description the analogue all pass filter<br>
could however be exchanged by a digital filter doing an<br>
identical filtering function as the above described analogue<br>
all pass filter. In this case, it may be desirable to include<br>
a delay circuit in the device, as shown as 21 in fig. 2, to<br>
delay the mid input signal M with a time corresponding to the<br>
processing time of the phase shifting means also in this<br>
embodiment.<br><br>
Further, in the above description the input stereo signals<br>
consist of a L and a R signal. The input signals could however<br>
as well consist of the M and S signals, in which case the<br>
first addition and subtraction steps are omitted.<br>
Further, in the above description the mid signal M has been<br>
attenuated a factor a. It is, however, of course possible to<br>
amplify the side signal S with a factor (3 instead.<br>
In the detailed description of the present invention the phase<br>
shift has been carried out on the side input signal S. The<br>
phase shift could however as well be carried out on the mid<br>
input signal M.<br>
Inasmuch as the present invention is subject to variations,<br>
modifications and changes in detail, some of which have been<br>
stated herein, it is intended that all matter described<br>
throughout this entire specification or shown in the<br>
accompanying drawings be interpreted as illustrative and not<br>
in a limiting sense.<br><br>
