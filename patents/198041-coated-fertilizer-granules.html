				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to novel coated fertilizer granules which are coated with a carboxyl carrying ethylene copolymer in which the carboxyl groups may also be in the form of their alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or ammonium salts, the carboxyl-carrying ethylene copolymer being composed of<br>
a)	from 75 to 90% by weight of ethylene and<br>
b)	from 10 to 25% by weight of an a—olefinically unsaturated C3—Cg—alkanecarboxylic acid,<br>
and those coated fertilizer granules which contain an active ingredient for crop protection being excepted. The present invention furthermore relates to a process for their preparation and to fertilizer application methods in which the novel coated fertilizer granules are used.<br>
It is generally known that fertilizer granules which are coated with a water-impermeable layer of a polymer can be used as fertilizer. As a result of the coating, the efficiency of these fertilizers is increased because the coated fertilizer releases in a sustained manner the substances serving as plant nutrients and can thus display its action over a long period. Such slow-release fertilizers are described, for example, in Ullraann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th edition 1987, volume A 10, pages 363 to 369, and their advantages are summarized in Fert. Res. ^   (1993), 1-12.<br>
US—A—4 851 027 discloses the use of aqueous dispersions which contain a polymer having a glass transition temperature of 60°C or more for coating fertilizer granules. A large number of monomers, including ethylene and unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, are specified as monomers which are suitable for the preparation of these polymers.<br>
No specific information about the use of copolymers of ethylene and olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids as coating polymers is given.<br>
EP—A—337 298 recommends the use of copolymers of ethylene, vinyl chloride and at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of acrylamide, methacrylamide, N—methylolacrylamide, N—butoxymethacrylamides, acrylic acid, glycidyl methacrylate and<br><br>
hydroxyethyl acrylate as coating polymers for coating fertilizer granules.<br>
Japanese Preliminary Published Application 71 698/87 discloses coated fertilizer granules which are prepared by applying a solution or a dispersion of an ethylene/acrylic acid copolymer in which the solvent or the continuous phase is an organic solvent, for example a hydrocartJon.<br>
The coated fertilizer granules have to meet a variety of requirements with regatd to simple and economical preparation and their performance characteristics.<br>
The polymers should be capable of being applied to the fertilizer granules without the use of organic solvents. Furthermore, the amount of polymer required for coating the granules should be very small in order to achieve an adequate slow-release effect.<br>
In addition, the coated fertilizer granules should show no tendency to stick together, in particular at temperatures as usually occur during their storage or during transport, without special measures being necessary in this respect. On the other hand, the coating polymers must not be excessively hard and brittle, since the coats would otherwise be damaged or even flake off when the coated fertilizer granules are subjected to mechanical stress as occurs, for example, during transfer or broadcasting on the arable land.<br>
Coated fertilizer granules which meet these complex requirements have not been disclosed to date. Only the non-prior-published German Patent Applications with the file reference P 43 43 176.2 describe coated fertilizer granules which contain a crop protection agent and whose coat consists of a polymer which is composed of from 75 to 90% by weight of ethylene and from 10 to 25% by weight of an a-olefinically unsaturated mono- or dicarboxylic acid.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide coated fertilizer granules which meet the abovementioned requirements.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the coated fertilizers defined at the outset. We have also found a process for their preparation and fertilizer application methods in which these coated fertilizers are used.<br><br>
starting fertilizer granules wnicn  are suztable tor  coating are generally known granules of organic or mineral fertilizers, as described, for example, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th edition 1987, volume A 10, pages 323 to 431 (cf. in particular sections 2.1 and 4) .<br>
For example, single-nutrient and multinutrient fertilizers which contain nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium or phosphorus in the form of their salts, individually or, if required, in combination, are suitable. Examples of these are NP, NK, PK and NPK fertilizers, such as calcium ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate sulfate and urea.<br>
It is also possible to use starting fertilizer granules which contain salts of Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zu, Mo and/or B in minor amounts, ie. usually in amounts of from 0.5 to 5% by weight, in addition to the stated main components.<br>
The longest average diameter of the starting fertilizer granules is in general from 0.5 to 10, preferably from 0.7 to 5, mm. Their bulk density is usually from 0.5 to 1.3 kg/1. The coating consists of a carboxyl-carrying ethylene copolymer in which some or all of the carboxyl groups may also be in the form of their salts, preferably the zinc, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or ammonium salts, the sodium or ammonium salts being particularly preferred.<br>
Particularly suitable ammonium salts are those which are derived from ammonia, a mono—, di— or trialkanolamine, each having 2 to 18, preferably 2 to 6 carbon atoms in the hydroxyalkyl radical, or mixtures of the stated alkanolamines, or a<br>
dialkylmonoalkanolamine having 2 to 8 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical and 2 to 8 carbon atoms in the hydroxyalkyl radical, or mixtures thereof. Examples of these are diethanolamine, triethanolamine, 2^amino-2—methylpropan-1—ol and dimethylethanolamine.<br>
Preferably from 40 to 100, particularly preferably from 70 to 90, % of the carboxyl groups are in the form of their salts.<br>
The carboxyl-carrying ethylene copolymer is composed of<br>
a)  from 70 to 90, preferably from 75 to 85, % by weight of ethylene and<br><br>
b)  from 10 to 30, preferably from 15 to 25, % by weight of an a—olefinically unsaturated C3—Cg—alkanecarboxylic acid.<br>
Particularly suitable monomers (b) are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid and itaconic acid and mixtures of these acids.<br>
The carboxyl-carrying ethylene copolymers preferably have a melt flow index (MFI) of from 1 to 25, particularly preferably from 8 to 15 (measured at 160°C and 325 kp}.<br>
The MFI indicates the amount of polymer melt, in grams, which can be forced, at a certain temperature and in a certain time, through a nozzle of certain dimensions when a certain force (load) is applied. The melt flow indices {MFI units) are determined similarly to the standards ASTM D 1238-65 T, ISO R 1133-1696 (E) or DIN 53 735 (1970), which are identical to one another.<br>
The carboxyl-carrying ethylene copolymers preferably have a melting range whose final melting point (Tf^) is above SO'C, preferably above 110'C. The TpM is in general not higher than 2O0'C. The TFM can be determined, for example, by the differential scanning caloriraetry (DSC) method, the procedure of DIN 53765 usually being employed.<br>
The carboxyl-carrying ethylene copolymers furthermore preferably have a glass transition temperature (TG) of less than SO'C, preferably from —20 to +20'C, and no glass transition temperature above 50'C. The TQ is likewise usually determined by the DSC method according to DIN 53765.<br>
The proportion of carboxyl-carrying ethylene copolymer in the total amount of the coated fertilizer granules is in general from 0.5 to 15, preferably from 2 to 10, % by weight.<br>
The novel coated fertilizer granules are generally prepared by applying an aqueous solution or an aqueous dispersion of the carboxyl-carrying ethylene copolymer to starting fertilizer granules.<br>
Examples of suitable aqueous dispersions are the aqueous dispersions of ethylene copolymer waxes, which dispersions are described in DE~A—34 20 168, which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br><br>
The aqueous dispersions preferably contain from 5 to 45, preferably from 10 to 30, % by weight of the carboxyl-carrying ethylene copolymers in dispersed form.<br>
Substances which control the release of the fertilizers may furthermore be added to the solutions or dispersions. Thes^ are in particular substances such as lignin, starch and celluloses. The amount thereof is, for example, from 0.1 to 5, preferably from 0.1 to 3, % by weight, based on the coating substance.<br>
The solutions or dispersions of the carboxyl-carrying ethylene copolymers are advantageously applied by spraying on at in general from 10 to llO'C.<br>
En order to avoid superficial dissolution of the starting fertilizer granules when an aqueous dispersion or solution is applied, only a limited amount of the solution or dispersion is applied per unit time, and it is ensured that the water can Bvaporate rapidly.<br>
En an advantageous procedure, a fluidized bed which is produced Dy fluidizing the starting fertilizer granules by means of a Eluidizing gas is sprayed with the solutions or dispersions at Erom 10 to 110°C, preferably from 30 to lO'C. After the solutions Dz  dispersions have been sprayed on, the fluidized bed is generally maintained until the solvent or the dispersing medium las evaporated.<br>
3uch fluidized-bed application methods are generally known and lave been described for the preparation of coated fertilizer granules in US—A—5 211 985. These processes permit the production of  particularly uniform and thin coats.<br>
En order additionally to reduce the tendency of the coated fertilizer granules to stick together and cake, it may be advantageous to apply powdered solids, such as talc, Si02, AI2O3 or  Ti02, after the coating of the granules with the carboxyl-carrying ethylene copolymers.<br>
[he coated fertilizer granules contain no effective amounts.of active ingredients for crop protection, for example fungicidal active ingredients.<br>
The coated fertilizer granules, if required together with litrification inhibitors or growth regulators, are applied by conventional methods to the arable land, where they release the fertilizer over a relatively long period in a form available to<br><br>
plants. The fertilizer granules are distinguished in particular by the fact that they show comparatively little tendency to stick together and cake, even at elevated temperatures, and their coat are insensitive to mechanical stresses as typically encountered during transfer and transport.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of coated fertilizer granules applying to fertilizer granules, an aqueous dispersion of a carboxyl-carrying ethylene copolymer in which the carboxyl groups may also be in the form of their alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or ammonium salts, the carboxyl-carrying ethylene copolymer being composed of<br>
(a)	from 75 to 90% by weight of ethylene and<br>
(b)	from  10 to 25% by weight of an a-olefinically unsaturated Cj-Cg-alkanecarboxylic acid.<br><c></c><br>
Examples<br>
Preparation of the coated fertilizer granules<br>
In a commercial fluidized-bed coater (eg. Multiprozessor MP 1 from Aeromatic, 4416 Bubendorf, Switzerland; Kugelcoater HKC-5 from Hiittlin, 79585 Steinen, Germany}, the fertilizer granules were fluidized by means of preheated air and heated to the desired temperature. The particular aqueous polymer dispersions were sprayed by means of nozzles present in the apparatuses, and the granules were thus coated with a polymer film. The spray rate was chosen so that superficial dissolution of the fertilizer was avoided. After the end of spraying, the product was dried for a few minutes in the fluidized bed. By varying the amount of coating material, it was possible to adjust the release rate of the nutrients and hence the desired duration of action of the fertilizer (cf. Example 12).<br>
The composition of the fertilizer granules used is indicated by the combinations of numbers stated in parentheses in the Examples:<br>
1st number  Nitrogen, the corresponding amount by weight of N2 is stated<br>
2nd number  Phosphorus, the corresponding amount by weight of P2O5 is stated<br>
3rd number  Potassium, the corresponding amount by weight of K2O is stated<br>
4th number  Magnesium, the corresponding amount by weight of MgO is stated<br>
The fertilizer Nitrophoska® Perfekt (15-5+20-i-2) thus contains nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium in the same ratio as a fertilizer mixture comprising 15 parts of N, 5 parts of P205» 20 parts of K2O and 2 parts of MgO.<br><br>
Investigation of the slow-release effect<br>
10 g of the particular coated fertilizer granules were continuously extracted with water. For this purpose, the granules were arranged in a layer in a cylindrical glass vessel filled with water, so that the granules were completely surrounded by water. Water was passed at a flow velocity of 1 ml/min through this layer of granules, and the water passed through this layer was removed from the vessel and its nitrogen content analyzed. The total amount of fertilizer which had been extracted from the granules after a certain period was calculated from the amount of water removed and its nitrogen content. This amount was stated in each case as the N leaching rate.<br>
