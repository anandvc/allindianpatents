				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a thermoplastic molding composition.<br>
The subject of the present invention are compositions containing matrix polymer, graft polymer and special additive mixtures, their use for the production of moulded articles, as well as the moulded articles obtainable therefrom. The subject of the invention is also the additive combination.<br>
ABS moulding compositions have already been used for many years in large quantities as thermoplastic resins for the production of all types of moulded parts. The property spectrum of these resins ranges from relatively brittle to extremely tough.<br>
A special area of use of ABS moulding compositions is the production of moulded parts by injection moulding (e.g. housings, toys, vehicle parts), an important factor being in particular a very good flowability of the polymer material.   Also, the moulded parts produced in this way must as a rule have a good notched-bar impact strength as well as a good resistance to thermal stresses.<br>
The object therefore exists of achieving, for a given rubber content, a given rubber particle size and given matrix resin molecular weight, toughness values that are as high as possible while retaining the good thermoplastic flowability.    In this<br>
connection the high toughness  values .should as far as possible be  obtained independently of the type of matrix resin that is employed, and especially when<br>
using   the   styrene/acrylonitrile   copolymers   and   α-methylstyrene/acrylonitrile<br>
copolymers typical of ABS.<br>
One possible way of improving the toughness of ABS polymers with a given rubber content, given rubber particle size and given matrix molecular weight is to add special silicone oil compounds (see EP-A 6521); however, disadvantages may arise such as poor paintability, unsatisfactory prmtability or impaired yield stress values (danger of stress whitening).  The addition of minor amounts of EPDM rubber (see BP-A 412 370) or AES polymer (see EP-A 412 371) has also been described. Both<br>
methods require the use of considerable amounts of relatively expensive additive components however.<br>
The use of large amounts of individual low molecular weight additive components may m special cases improve the processability, although this is normally offset by a negative effect on other properties such as for example toughness, modulus of elasticity and thermal stability<br>
It has now been found that by using special additive mixtures, ABS products can be obtained having a very good combination of notched-bar impact strength (at room temperature as well as at low temperatures) and excellent processability.<br>
The invention provides thermoplastic moulding compounds or compositions containing<br>
A)	5 to 95 wt.%, preferably 10 to 90 wt.% and particularly preferably 20 to 75 wt.% of one or more thermoplastic homopolymers, copolymers or terpolymers of styrene, α-methylstyrene, nuclear-substituted styrene, methyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, maleic anhydride, N-substituted maleimide or mixtures thereof,<br>
