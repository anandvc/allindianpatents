Polyethylene Composition for Injection Moulding with Improved Stress<br>
Crack/Stiffness Relation and Impact Resistance<br>
The present invention relates to a polyethylene composition for shaped<br>
articles, especially injection and compression moulded articles, in<br>
particular for caps and closures, transport packaging, houseware and thin<br>
wall packaging applications. Furthermore, the present invention relates to<br>
an injection or compression moulded article comprising said composition<br>
and to the use of said composition for the production of an injection or<br>
compression moulded article.<br>
Injection moulding may be used to make a wide variety of articles<br>
including articles having relatively complex shapes and a range of sizes.<br>
Injection moulding is, for instance, suited for the manufacture of caps and<br>
closures, and articles used in transportation packaging which often have a<br>
particular form suited to the objects which they carry. Examples of such<br>
articles include boxes, bins, pallets, pails, trays and crates. Furthermore,<br>
injection moulding is widely used to produce articles for houseware<br>
applications, such as sink bowls and drainers, mixing bowls, food<br>
containers and buckets, as well as to produce thin wall packaging articles<br>
such as open top plastic containers for frozen or fresh food or non-food<br>
applications like paint, adhesives, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.<br>
Injection moulding is a moulding process in which a polymer is melted and<br>
then filled into a mould by injection. During initial injection, a high<br>
pressure is used and the polymer melt is compressed. Thus, upon injection<br>
into the mould the polymer melt initially expands or "relaxes" to fill the<br>
mould. The mould, however, is at a lower temperature than the polymer<br><br>
WO 2007/042216	PCT/EP2006/009683<br>
2<br>
melt therefore as the polymer melt cools, shrinkage tends to occur. To<br>
compensate for this effect, further polymer melt may be slowly injected<br>
into the mould. Thereafter the polymer melt is cooled further to enable the<br>
moulded article to be removed from the mould without causing<br>
deformation.<br>
Important properties of the polymer to be injection moulded are its<br>
mechanical properties which, in turn, determine the properties of the final<br>
moulded article. In particular, the polymer must have good impact<br>
resistance, and, simultaneously, a good balance between environmental<br>
stress crack resistance ESCR (which e.g. is measured in terms of the bell<br>
test) and stiffness (which e.g. is measured in terms of the E-modulus). Of<br>
course, the polyethylene composition at the same time must have good<br>
processability, such as good flowability.<br>
There remains a need for a polyethylene composition suitable for use in<br>
injection and compression moulding, in particular for caps and closure,<br>
transport packaging and houseware applications, which provides a<br>
combination of, on the one hand, excellent mechanical properties including<br>
excellent impact strength, stress crack resistance and stiffness as well as a<br>
good balance between these mechanical properties, and, on the other hand,<br>
good processability, including good flowability.<br>
It is emphasized that although these properties at least in part are contrary<br>
to each other, e.g. high ESCR and high stiffness, to provide a polyethylene<br>
composition for injection moulding, each of them must be achieved.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that such a composition must<br>
contain a fraction, usually from 1 to 20 wt%, of a copolymer of ethylene<br><br>
WO 2007/042216	PCT/EP2006/009683<br>
3<br>
with one or more types of alpha-olefin comonomers which has a<br>
comparatively high molecular weight, usually above 300,000 g/mol.<br>
The present invention thus provides a polyethylene composition wherein<br>
(i) the composition has an MFR2 of 0.05 to 100 g/10min,<br>
(ii) the environmental stress crack resistance ESCR<br>
measured in hours according to ASTM 1693, condition<br>
B and E-modulus EM measured according to ISO 527-<br>
2:1993 in MPa satisfy the following relation:<br>
ESCR &gt; - EM h/MPa + 1150 h.<br>
The polyethylene composition according to the invention has improved<br>
mechanical properties including an improved ESCR/stiffness relation. The<br>
E-modulus is a measure for the stiffness. At the same time, the composition<br>
has good impact strength and good processability.<br>
Preferably, the ESCR in hours and the EM of the composition satisfy the<br>
following relation:<br>
ESCR &gt; - EM h/MPa + 1200 h.<br>
Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment, in the polyethylene composition<br>
(iii) the Charpy impact strength CIS (23 °C) measured in<br>
kJ/m2 according to ISO 179:2000 and the MFR2 in<br>
g/10min satisfy the following relation:<br>
CIS &gt; -12 log(MFR2/g/10min) kJ/m2 +21.6 kJ/m2.<br>
Preferably, the CIS and the MFR2 of the composition satisfy the following<br>
relation :<br><br>
WO 2007/042216	PCT/EP2006/009683<br>
4<br>
CIS &gt; -12 log(MFR2/g/10min) kJ/m2 + 22.6 kJ/m2,<br>
more preferred :<br>
CIS &gt; -12 log(MFR2/g/10min) kJ/m2 + 23.6 kJ/m2, and<br>
still more preferred:<br>
CIS &gt; -12 log(MFR2/g/10min) kJ/m2 + 24.6 kJ/m2.<br>
Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment in the polyethylene composition<br>
(iv) the Charpy impact strength CIS (23°C) measured in kJ/m2<br>
according to ISO 179:2000 and the flowability (FA) measured<br>
in terms of the spiral length in cm at a pressure of 1000 bar<br>
satisfy the following relation:<br>
CIS &gt; - 0.5 FA kJ/m2/cm + 39 kJ/m2.<br>
This preferred embodiment of the polyethylene composition of the<br>
invention provides a material with an improved balance of impact strength,<br>
which is an important property for the final product, and flowability, which<br>
is especially important when producing the product by injection moulding.<br>
Preferably, the CIS and FA of the composition satisfy the following<br>
relation:<br>
CIS &gt; - 0.5 FA kJ/m2/cm + 40 kJ/m2, and<br>
still more preferably<br>
CIS &gt; - 0.5 FA kJ/m2/cm + 41 kJ/m2.<br>
Further preferred, the polyethylene composition has a melt flow rate MFR2<br>
of at least 0.1 g/10min, preferably of at least 0.3 g/10 min, more preferably<br><br>
WO 2007/042216	PCT/EP2006/009683<br>
5<br>
at least 0.5 g/10min, even more preferably of at least 0.8 g/10 min and most<br>
preferably above 1.0 g/10min.<br>
Furthermore, the composition preferably has an MFR2 of 25 g/10min or<br>
less, more preferably 15 g/10min or less, still more preferably 10 g/10 min<br>
or less, and most preferably 5 g/10min or less.<br>
Still further, preferably the polyethylene composition has an ESCR<br>
measured according to the bell test of 150 h or more, more preferably of<br>
200 h or more, and most preferably of 250 h or more<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polyethylene composition comprises<br>
(A) a fraction of a copolymer of ethylene with one or more<br>
alpha-olefins, with a weight average molecular weight Mw of<br>
300,000 g/mol or more.<br>
Where ever the term "molecular weight" is used herein, the weight average<br>
molecular weight is meant. By ethylene copolymer is meant a polymer the<br>
majority by weight of which, i.e. more than 50 wt%, derives from ethylene<br>
monomer units.<br>
Preferably, the molecular weight Mw of fraction (A) is 320,000 g/mol or<br>
more, still more preferably is 350,000 g/mol or more.<br>
Preferably, the Mw of fraction (A) is 1,000,000 g/mol or below, more<br>
preferably 800,000 g/mol or below, and most preferably 600,000 g/mol or<br>
below.<br><br>
WO 2007/042216	PCT/EP2006/009683<br>
6<br>
Furthermore, it is preferred that fraction (A) has a molecular weight<br>
distribution Mw/Mn of 3 or higher, more preferably of 4 or higher, and most<br>
preferably of 5 or higher.<br>
Still further, it is preferred that fraction (A) has a molecular weight<br>
distribution Mw/Mn of 15 or lower, more preferably of 10 or lower.<br>
The comonomer content in fraction (A) preferably is up to 15 mol%, more<br>
preferably up to 10 mol%, and most preferably up to 6 mol%.<br>
Furthermore, the comonomer content preferably is 0.1 mol% or more, more<br>
preferably is 1.0 mol% or more, and still more preferably is 2.0 mol% or<br>
more.<br>
Preferably, the alpha olefin comonomer is a C3.2o&gt; especially C3_i0,<br>
comonomers, particularly singly or multiply ethylenically unsaturated<br>
.comonomers, in particular C3.i0 alpha-olefins such as propene, but-1-ene,<br>
hex-1-ene, oct-1-ene, 4-methyl-pent-l-ene etc.. Preferably, but-1-ene, hex-<br>
1-ene and oct-1-ene are used. But-1-ene is an especially preferred<br>
comonomer.<br>
Fraction (A) preferably is present in the polyethylene composition in an<br>
amount of from 1 to 15 wt%, more preferred from 2 to 10 wt%.<br>
Furthermore, the density of fraction (A) preferably is 940 kg/m3 or less,<br>
more preferably is 935 kg/m3 or less, and most preferably is 930 kg/m3 or<br>
less.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the polyethylene composition comprises<br>
(B) a first ethylene homo- or copolymer fraction, and<br><br>
WO 2007/042216	PCT/EP2006/009683<br>
7<br>
(C) a second ethylene homo- or copolymer fraction,<br>
which are different from fraction (A), and wherein fraction (B) has a lower<br>
average molecular weight than fraction (C).<br>
Usually, a polyethylene composition comprising at least two polyethylene<br>
fractions, which have been produced under different polymerisation<br>
conditions resulting in different (weight average) molecular weights and<br>
molecular weight distributions for the fractions, is referred to as<br>
"multimodal". Accordingly, in this sense the compositions of the invention<br>
are multimodal polyethylenes. The prefix "multi" relates to the number of<br>
different polymer fractions the composition is consisting of. Thus, for<br>
example, a composition consisting of two fractions only is called<br>
"bimodal".<br>
The form of the molecular weight distribution curve, i.e. the appearance of<br>
the graph of the polymer weight fraction as function of its molecular<br>
weight, of such a multimodal polyethylene will show two or more maxima<br>
or at least be distinctly broadened in comparison with the curves for the<br>
individual fractions.<br>
For example, if a polymer is produced in a sequential multistage process,<br>
utilising reactors coupled in series and using different conditions in each<br>
reactor, the polymer fractions produced in the different reactors will each<br>
have their own molecular weight distribution and weight average molecular<br>
weight. When the molecular weight distribution curve of such a polymer is<br>
recorded, the individual curves from these fractions are superimposed into<br>
the molecular weight distribution curve for the total resulting polymer<br>
product, usually yielding a curve with two or more distinct maxima.<br><br>
WO 2007/042216	PCT/EP2006/009683<br>
8<br>
Preferably, the weight fraction of fraction (B) with regard to the total<br>

Furthermore, preferably the weight fraction of fraction (B) with regard to<br>
the total weight of fractions (B) and (C) is less than 60 %, more preferably<br>

of at least 2, more preferably at least 2.5. Preferably, the Mw of fraction (A)<br>
relative to the Mw of fractions (B) and (C) is higher by a factor of at most<br>
6, more preferably of at most 5.<br>

lower, more preferably of 1500 g/10min or lower and most preferably of<br>
1000 g/10min or lower.<br>
Fractions (B) and (C) may both be ethylene copolymers or ethylene<br>
homopolymers, although preferably at least one of the fractions is an<br>
ethylene copolymer.<br>
Preferably, the composition comprises an ethylene homopolymer and an<br>
ethylene copolymer component.<br>
Preferably, fraction (B) is an ethylene homo- or copolymer with a density<br>
of at least 965 kg/m3.<br><br>
WO 2007/042216	PCT/EP2006/009683<br>
9<br>
Where one of the components is an ethylene homopolymer, this is<br>
preferably the component with the lower molecular weight, i.e. fraction<br>
(B).<br>
Preferably, fraction (C) is an ethylene homo- or copolymer with a density<br>
of less than 965 kg/m3.<br>
Most preferably, fraction (C) is a copolymer. It may be noted that the term<br>
ethylene copolymer is used herein to relate to a polyethylene deriving from<br>
ethylene and one or more copolymerisable comonomers. Preferably, the<br>
copolymer component(s) of the composition of the invention will contain at<br>
least 0.01 mol%, more preferably at least 0.05 mol%, and most preferably<br>
at least 0.1 mol % of non-ethylene comonomer units. Furthermore,<br>
preferably the copolymer contains at most 5 mol % of such comonomer<br>
units, more preferably at most 2 mol%.<br>
Preferred ethylene copolymers employ alpha-olefins (e.g. C3.i2 alpha-<br>
olefins) as comonomers. Examples of suitable alpha-olefins include but-1-<br>
ene, hex-1-ene and oct-1-ene. But-1-ene is an especially preferred<br>
comonomer.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the final polyethylene composition has a<br>
complex viscosity at 0.05 rad/s shear rate (eta0.o5) of 20,000 Pas or less,<br>
more preferably of 18,500 Pas or less, and most preferably of 15,000 Pas or<br>
less.<br>
Preferably, the composition has a complex viscosity at 300 rad/s shear rate<br>
(eta3Oo) of 1,000 Pas or less, more preferably of 700 Pas or less.<br><br>

The density of the composition preferably is 940 kg/m3 or higher, more<br>

Usually, the compositions have a Charpy impact strength (23°C) of up to<br>
40 kJ/m2, more preferably up to 50 kJ/m2.<br>
Furthermore, preferably the compositions have a Charpy impact strength (-<br>
20°C) of 3 kJ/m2 or more, more preferably of 5 kJ/m2.<br>
Usually, the compositions have a Charpy impact strength (-20°C) of up to<br>

Furthermore, the composition has a molecular weight distribution MWD<br>
(Mw/Mn) of higher than 5, more preferably higher than 10, and most<br>
preferably higher than 20.<br>
The polyethylene composition may also contain minor quantities of<br>
additives such as pigments, nucleating agents, antistatic agents, fillers,<br><br>
WO 2007/042216	PCT/EP2006/009683<br>
11<br>
antioxidants, processing aids, etc., generally in amounts of up to 10 % by<br>
weight, preferably up to 5 % by weight.<br>
Fraction (A) of the polyethylene composition may be produced in any<br>
conventional ethylene homo- or copolymerisation method, e.g. in gas<br>
phase, slurry phase, liquid (bulk) phase using conventional reactors, such<br>
as loop reactor, gas phase reactor, semi-batch or batch reactor.<br>
Preferably, component (A) is produced in a slurry reaction, preferably in a<br>
loop reactor, or in a gas phase reaction.<br>
The polyethylene composition of the invention may be produced by<br>
blending fraction (A) with a polyethylene base resin, either mechanically,<br>
e.g. by in-line compounding, or in-situ.<br>
By "in-situ blending", production of a multimodal polymer is meant<br>
wherein the fractions are produced either simultaneously in one reaction<br>
stage (e.g. by using two different catalysts), and/or are produced in a<br>
multistage process. A multistage process is defined to be a polymerisation<br>
process in which a polymer comprising two or more fractions is produced<br>
by producing each or at least two polymer fraction(s) in a separate reaction<br>
stage, usually with different reaction conditions in each stage, in the<br>
presence of the reaction product of the previous stage which comprises a<br>
polymerisation catalyst. The polymerisation reactions used in each stage<br>
may involve conventional ethylene homopolymerisation or<br>
copolymerisation reactions, e.g. gas-phase, slurry phase, liquid phase<br>
polymerisations, using conventional reactors, e.g. loop reactors, gas phase<br>
reactors, stirred tank reactors, batch reactors etc. (see for example<br>
WO97/44371 and WO96/18662).<br><br>
WO 2007/042216	PCT/EP2006/009683<br>
12<br>
In the preferred embodiment wherein the composition comprises fractions<br>
(A), (B) and (C), it is preferred that fractions (A), (B) and/or (C) are<br>
produced in a multistage reaction.<br>
Further in that preferred embodiment, the composition is produced so that<br>
at least one of fractions (B) and (C), preferably (C), is produced in a gas-<br>
phase reaction.<br>
Further preferred, one of the fractions (B) and (C) of the polyethylene<br>
composition, preferably fraction (B), is produced in a slurry reaction,<br>
preferably in a loop reactor, and one of the fractions (B) and (C), preferably<br>
fraction (C), is produced in a gas-phase reaction.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferred that fractions (B) and (C) of the polyethylene<br>
resin are produced in different stages of a multistage process. Further, it is<br>
preferred that also fraction (A) is produced in a stage of said multistage<br>
process. However, it is also possible to add fraction (A) to (B) and (C) by<br>
in-line compounding.<br>
Preferably, the multistage process comprises at least one gas phase stage in<br>
which, preferably, fraction (C) is produced.<br>
It is also possible to produce components (A) and (C) or (A) and (B),<br>
preferably (A) and (C) in the same reaction stage, preferably in a gas phase<br>
reaction, by adding a second catalyst to said reaction stage with high Mw<br>
capability and appropriate comonomer incorporation capability.<br>
Further preferred, fraction (C) is produced in a subsequent stage in the<br>
presence of fraction (B) which has been produced in a previous stage. Still<br>
further, it is preferred that fraction (A) is produced in a stage preceding the<br>
stages in which fraction (B) and (C) are produced. This means that if the<br><br>
WO 2007/042216	PCT/EP2006/009683<br>
13<br>
final composition consists of fractions (A), (B) and (C), (A) is preferably<br>
made in the first stage.<br>
It is previously known to produce multimodal, in particular bimodal, olefin<br>
polymers, such as multimodal polyethylene, in a multistage process<br>
comprising two or more reactors connected in series. As instance of this<br>
prior art, mention may be made of EP 517 868, which is hereby<br>
incorporated by way of reference in its entirety, including all its preferred<br>
embodiments as described therein, as a preferred multistage process for the<br>
production of the polyethylene resin.<br>
The polymerisation catalysts include coordination catalysts of a transition<br>
metal, such as Ziegler-Natta (ZN), metallocenes, non-metallocenes, Cr-<br>
catalysts etc. The catalyst may be supported, e.g. with conventional<br>
supports including silica, Al-containing supports and magnesium dichloride<br>
based supports. Preferably the catalyst is a ZN catalyst.<br>

Experimental and Examples<br>
1. Definitions and measurement methods<br>
a)	Molecular weight<br>
The weight average molecular weight Mw and the molecular weight<br>
distribution (MWD = Mw/Mn wherein Mn is the number average molecular<br>
weight and Mw is the weight average molecular weight) is measured by a<br>
method based on ISO 16014-4:2003. A waters 150CV plus instrument was<br>
used with column 3 x HT&amp;E styragel from Waters (divinylbenzene) and<br>
trichlorobenzene (TCB) as solvent at 140 °C. The column set was<br>
calibrated using universal calibration with narrow MWD PS standards (the<br>
Mark Howings constant K: 9.54*10"5 and a: 0.725 for PS, and K: 3.92*10'4<br>
and a: 0.725 for PE). The ratio of Mw and Mn is a measure of the broadness<br>
of the distribution, since each is influenced by the opposite end of the<br>
"population".<br>
b)	Density<br>
All densities are measured according to ISO 1183/D.<br>
c)	Melt Flow Rate<br><br>
WO 2007/042216	PCT/EP2006/009683<br>
15<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is<br>
indicated in g/10 min. The MFR is an indication of the flowability, and<br>
hence the processability, of the polymer. The higher the melt flow rate, the<br>
lower the viscosity of the polymer. The MFR is determined at 190°C and<br>
may be determined at different loadings such as 2.16 kg (MFR2), 5 kg<br>
(MFR5)or21.6kg(MFR21).<br>
d) Shear Thinning Index SHI<br>
Dynamic rheological measurements were carried out with a rheometer,<br>
namely Rheometrics RDA-II QC, on compression moulded samples under<br>
nitrogen atmosphere at 190 °C using 25 mm diameter plates and plate<br>
geometry 1.2 mm gap. The oscillatory shear experiments were done within<br>
the linear viscosity range of strain at frequencies from 0.05 to 300 rad/s<br>
(ISO 6721-1).<br>
The values of storage modulus (G'), loss modulus (G") complex modulus<br>
(G*) and complex viscosity (eta*) were obtained as a function of frequency<br>
(omega). Eta(100 rad/s) is used as abbreviation for the complex viscosity at<br>
100 rad/sec shear rate.<br>
Shear thinning index (SHI), which is correlating with MWD and is<br>
independent of Mw, was calculated according to Heino ("Rheological<br>
characterization of polyethylene fractions" Heino, EX., Lehtinen, A.,<br>
Tanner J., Seppala, J., Neste Oy, Porvoo, Finland, Theor. Appl. Rheol.,<br>
Proc. Int. Congr. Rheol, 11th (1992), 1, 360-362, and "The influence of<br>
molecular structure on some rheological properties of polyethylene",<br>
Heino, E.L., Borealis Polymers Oy, Porvoo, Finland, Annual Transactions<br>
of the Nordic Rheology Society, 1995.)<br><br>
WO 2007/042216	PCT/EP2006/009683<br>
16<br>
SHI value is obtained by calculating the complex viscosities eta(1)~and<br>
eta(ioo) at a constant shear stress of 1 kPa and 100 kPa, respectively. The<br>
shear thinning index SHI(l/100) is defined as the ratio of the two<br>
viscosities eta(i) and eta(ioo&gt;-<br>
The definitions and measurement conditions are also described in detail on<br>
page 8 line 29 to page 11, line 25 of WO 00/22040.<br>
e)	Charpy impact strength<br>
Charpy impact strength was determined according to ISO 179:2000 on V-<br>
notched samples at 23 °C (Charpy impact strength (23°C)) and -20 °C<br>
(Charpy impact strength (-20°C)). The samples were produced by injection<br>
moulding.<br>
f)	ESCR<br>
Environmental Stress Crack Resistance (ESCR) was determined in hours<br>
according to ASTM 1693, condition B, at 50 °C and using 10% Igepal co-<br>
630.<br>
g)	Stiffness<br>
As a measure for the stiffness, the E-modulus (tensile modulus) of the<br>
compositions was measured on injection moulded samples according to ISO<br>
527-2:1993. The modulus was measured at a speed of 1 mm/min.<br>
h) Spiral flow<br>
Spiral Test is carried out using an Engel ES330/65 cc90 injection moulding<br>
apparatus with a spiral mould and pressure of 600, 1000 or 1400 bar<br><br>

2. Polyethylene Compositions<br>
a) Ultra-High Molecular Weight Fractions (fraction (A))<br>
Ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) ethylene polymers were prepared in<br>
the following manner:<br><br>
WO 2007/042216	PCT/EP2006/009683<br>
18<br>
Reactor:	stainless steel reactor, 2 1 and 17 1<br>
Reactor medium:	iso-Butane (900 ml, 8500 ml)<br>
Inert gas:	Nitrogen<br>
Temperature:	85°C<br>
Comonomer:	1-Butene<br>
Hydrogen addition:	Batchwise<br>
Ethylene feed:	Batchwise and continuous<br>
Comonomer addition:	Batchwise and continuous<br>
Al/Ti (mol/mol):	25<br>
The polymerisations were carried out in a stainless steel reactor equipped<br>
with an anchor stirrer. The polymerisations were done in i-butane slurry at<br>
85°C at a total pressure of 22.2 bar (except for one test, as indicated in<br>
Table 1). For reactor size 2 1, 906"ml i-butane was used and for reactor size<br>
17 1, 8500 ml i-butane was used.<br>
As a catalyst, Lynx 200™, a MgCl2 supported titanium containing catalyst<br>
available from Engelhard Corporation Pasadena, U.S.A.<br>
TEAL was used as cocatalyst. An Al/Ti (mol/mol) ratio of 25 was used.<br>
The comonomer was 1-butene. Hydrogen was added as one batch at the<br>
outset of reaction. Ethylene was added continuously during the<br>
polymerisation to maintain a constant reactor pressure. 1-Butene was added<br>
both as a batch at the outset of reaction, and cascaded with ethylene during<br>
polymerisation.<br>
After polymerisation was completed, the reactor was vented and the content<br>
was exposed to air.<br>
The properties of these polymer are shown in Table 1.<br><br>

In Examples 2 to 5, 5 wt% of UHMW polymers, Al to A4, respectively,<br>
were mechanically blended with a reference bimodal polyethylene base<br>
resin (Example 1). The reference bimodal resin has been prepared in<br>
accordance with EP 1 187 876, in particular with the examples described<br>
therein. The split between high and low molecular weight fraction<br>
(fractions (B) and (C)) was 50/50.<br>
Blends were compounded on a small scale twin-screw Prism 24 mm<br>
extruder two times with a melt temperature of 190 to 230°C (logged<br>
process data). 1000 ppm of Irganox B561 was added to the blends.<br>
