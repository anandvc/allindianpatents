The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is performed.<br><br>
TITLE:<br><br>
PRODUCTION OF FEED SUPPLEMENT COMPOSITIONS OF ANIMALS<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION AND USE OF INVENTION<br><br>
This invention relates to the ruminants feed supplements formulations. This invention more particularly relates with feed composition in the treatment of skeletal deformities; loss of appetite and immunity towards foot and mouth diseases of the livestock is of NPN (non--protein nitrogen) mineral salt premix.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION (Prior Art and problem to be solved)<br><br><br>
This invention relates to the field of animal nutrition and more particularly, to feed supplements for ruminants.<br><br><br>
Livestock which are being raised for consumption may be considered as chemical factories, wherein nutrient chemicals are used as the input and products such as meat and milk are latter recovered. As with any other chemical factory, the animals have certain requirements for the input materials, if a maximized production efficiency is to be obtained. It is desired to feed a ration which is balanced to provide all nutritional requirements for the expected production.<br><br><br>
Unfortunately, however, it is very difficult to supply all of the nutritional requirements of livestock, using only the readily available crop feeds.<br><br><br>
Cattle, for example, may be fed a ration including roughage, such as in alfalfa hay, and concentrates (low-fiber, higher energy materials), such as silage and corn or other grains. The nutritional composition of the ration will be found to vary considerably over a period of time, due to the changes in the nutrient content which are observed during various harvesting period of time, due to the changes in nutrient content which are observed during various harvesting periods of even a single crop growing season, losses in nutrients during storage, and the wide variation in soil nutrient contents from one plot to another.<br><br><br><br>
For this reason, it may not be practical to provide a completely balanced ration using only crop materials.<br><br><br>
Supplements have been commonly used to correct nutritional deficiencies in livestock feeds. In ruminants such as cattle, urea or other non-protein nitrogenous compounds can be added to compensate for a deficiency of protein in the ration. Various minerals, particularly calcium, phosphorus, salt, iodine, and iron are frequently not present in feed in their required amounts, so are added to those feeds as supplements. Further, the caloric content of feeds can be increased by supplementation with various fats, sugar such as molasses. The vitamin content of feeds frequently is insufficient; this situation is corrective by appropriate supplementation.<br><br><br>
Due to the high cost of usual animal feeds, it is not always economically feasible to supply a balanced ration with crop materials, even if an appropriate mixture could be procured. Therefore, locally available by-products, such as sugar beet pulp, waste from potato processing, grain waste from breweries or distilleries. Whey's, grain hulls, and many other by-products which can be obtained at a relatively low cost, are fed to live stock in place of some or all of a more customarily fed crop material. Some supplementation is normally required when such by-products are used.<br><br><br>
Supplements are fed in three different manners: (1) special feeding, separately from other feeds; (2) offered to the animals on continuing, a free-choice basis; or (3) mixed with other feeds. To assure a more uniform ingestion of the supplements, it is preferable to mix desired amounts with other feeds and present the mixture to the animals at scheduled feeding times. However, considerable problems are often encountered in blending and distributing the mixed, supplemented feeds, particularly in facilities such as cattle feed lots and large dairy farms where large quantities of feed must be handled every day. In addition, even if it would be possible to satisfactorily mix dry- feed and dry supplement materials, separation invariably will be a problem, as the mixture is handled and distributed to the animals. Further, finely divided particulate solids present a palatability problem with many animals.<br><br><br>
These difficulties are avoided, to a large degree, by the use of fluid supplements which can be applied to feeds, such as by simple spraying before or during distribution. It is, of course, possible to dissolve several supplements (e.g., salt, urea, etc.) in water for application to dry feed materials.<br><br><br>
US 3,988,483 relates the formation of an aqueous slurry of a starch bearing feed material and urea, then cooking the slurry to gelatinize starch and form a suspension. US 4,055,667 describes the formation of suspension from brewer's spent yeast slurry, a material providing "colloidal water-binding capacity" (such as attapulgite clay), and a number of optional materials.<br><br><br>
US 4,382,966 utilizes xantun gum as an aid to maintaining an aqueous suspension of calcium carbonate and other animal feed supplements.<br><br><br>
A good-quality fodder should contain more than 60% total digestible nutrients (NTN) on dry matter basis .Feed for ruminants normally include protein, roughage, and carbohydrates. Carbohydrates (normally grain) provides; various source of roughage include hay, pasture, silage, ground cotton burrs. Protein is commonly supplied by oil seed meal supplements for example, alfalfa hay, sunflower, safflower, ground nut meal, in addition to protein found in grain or hay, and typically feed also contains vitamins, minerals, and other supplements.<br><br>
Most animals rose for dairy or slaughter is fed in a free choice environment. By a free choice environment is meant that feed is placed in a feed bunk or other suitable container and the animal eats until it is satisfied or until the feed bunk is empty. <br><br>
Feed supplements are offered to cattle in addition to roughage sources such as pasture or hay. Typically, the feed supplement is placed on a daily or twice daily basis in a feed bunk either manually or automatically and the animals are permitted to feed at will. Some animals eat more than their share of feed supplement while other are denied their share of feed supplement.<br><br><br>
Overeating by animals is generally wasteful since an animal will eat more feed supplement than it can efficiently metabolize. Individually administering a predetermined amount of	feed supplement to individual animals where large numbers of animals are involved is not a practical alternative.<br><br>
Research and discussion on the use of non-protein nitrogen (NPN) in ruminant feeding have been continued for over 120 years since Zuntz (1891 formulated the hypothesis that rumen microorganisms are capable of decomposing cellulose and converting NPN into true protein. Since that time, studies show that these compounds are broken down to ammonia during the normal fermentation process in the rumen. Microorganisms in the rumen combine the ammonia with products of carbohydrate metabolism to form amino acids and hence, proteins (US 3,753, 723). The proteins formed in this manner (from NPN compounds) are similar in amino acid content to the proteins available to the animal when the principal source of dietary nitrogen is intact protein There have been attempts to include various compositions into feed supplements to control consumption by individual cattle. High levels of salt (sodium chloride) have been used for many years to limit free choice feed supplement consumption by cattle. However, for salt to be effective as a feed intake limitor, high levels of salt such as 18% by weight must be used. In addition, it has been found that cattle have become used to salt so that even higher levels, as high as 50%, have had to be used to limit the intake of feed supplements. Such high levels of salt are deleterious to pasture land, especially where animals congregate.<br><br><br>

US 5,733,590 relates with the urea: calcium compounds as a slow release source of nitrogen ruminant feed supplement.<br><br><br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,642,317; 4,826,694; 4,853,233; and 4,909,138 describe the incorporation of insoluble fatty acid salts in ruminant feed as a means of increasing the fat content of the feed without deleteriously affecting the ruminant digestion cycle. A feed additive such as fatty acid calcium salt functions as a rumen inert product which passes through the rumen without interfering with rumen fermenation (i.e., a rumen bypass product), and is subsequently metabolized in the abomasum or small intestine of the ruminant.<br><br><br>
US 3,860, 723 relates to a method of increasing feed intake in animals not in by administering internally the active ingredient, a phenylalkylsulfamide or phenylalkylurea as such or in a standard premix in the feed of the animals.<br><br><br>
US 5,250,307 relates with the conventional cattle feeds such as corn and alfalfa often fail to provide sufficient energy for cattle, especially lactating dairy cattle during periods of heavy milk production. Feed containing a high proportion of corn also has a tendency to depress the milk fat content of the milk produced by such cattle. Fat is a concentrated energy source, and it is known that if the proportion of fat in cattle feed is increased, lactating dairy cattle produce high milk yields without draining their reserves of body fat and without diminishing the proportion of milk fat in the milk produced.<br><br><br>
Indian pending patent 217/CHE/2008 relates with dietary synchronization of estrus in livestock ruminants using urea mineral salt premix feed supplements for natural estrus synchronization.<br><br>
US 5250307 provide the process for preparing a dietary fatty acid salt supplement composition which contains a combination of additional nutrient or medicament ingredients. This dietary composition can function as a rumen bypass animal feed supplement, and permit a beneficial increase in the nutrient fat content of the feed.<br><br><br>
US 4,533,557 relates with feed additives composition containing biologically active ingradients, chitosan and protective material which are one or more substance(s) selected from the group consisting of saturated or unsaturated aliphatic mono-carboxylic acids hardened vegetable oils which pass easily through rumen to digest easily.<br><br><br>
US 4,857,332 relates with the an acids of sodium and magnesium and an electrolytes to increase the fat percent in milk.<br><br><br>
US 4,027,043 relates with the urea mineral salt lick block with molasis and starch, inorganic salts as binding agents.<br><br><br>
US 4,248,899 relates with the feed supplements for ruminants are prepared from protein from leafy green source. The protein is combined with lipid material and the mixture is emulsified and coagulated dried to solid content of 855 or more at a temperature 80°C-	j 100°C.<br><br><br>
US 4,452,779 relates with application of 0.5 % of diuretics in the feed supplements to improve the quality and quantity of the milk produced.<br><br>

It has been already proposed in this invention that  to minimize the intervention of human in regulating the behavior and environment ruminants.<br><br><br>
The principle object of this invention is feed composition which can increase the immunity of the ruminants to the foot and mouth diseases.<br><br><br>
Another object of this invention is to give protection against dysentery in bovines with the feed supplements.<br><br>
A further object of this invention is to minimize the use of inorganic salts as mineral supplements and optimize the salt and urea in feed consumption.<br><br><br>
A one more objective of this is that feed supplements built up self immunity for microbial and viral diseases.<br><br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br><br><br>

The present invention is accomplished by a relatively low cost process. This NPN, vitamins, mineral salt mixture to be mixed with the feed concentrates available at the farmer's source.<br><br><br>
There has been a continuing need for new dietary supplements for animal feed which can be fed to ruminant animals without interfering with the rumen microorganisms, or being rendered ineffective by the rumen microorganisms.<br><br><br>
The compositions and methods of this invention definitely benefit the economics of animal production by inducing the animals to eat more than their normal feed intake. The animals eat more, gain weight more rapidly, and get to market faster resulting in a saving of feed cost and labor.<br><br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention shall become apparent from the accompanying description and examples.<br><br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention is a fluid feed supplement, particularly for adding a feed intended for ruminants, which can be made to incorporate several components. In ruminants (cattle, sheep, etc.) the rumen-reticulum acts as a common denominator for all nutritional regimen imposed. The rumen-reticulum harbors many microorganisms (bacteria and protozoa) which ferment all feed components into characteristic end products. The biochemical activities which permit consumption of cellulose and NPN are unique characteristics of ruminant digestion.<br><br><br>
The optimum amount of feed supplement eaten by ruminants will generally be the intake amount necessary for the feed supplement's desired benefits. Such benefits include satisfying the basic nutritional and metabolic requirements of the ruminant and maintaining the animal's weight or inducing weight gain. Variations of the predetermined optimum amount will depend upon the type of animal as well as the environmental conditions present. For example, the type and availability of forage and selective grazing of the animal may vary the animal's daily intake of feed supplement. Average daily intakes of feed supplement range from about 2 pounds to about 8 pounds per head with a preferred intake of about 3 pounds to about 5 pounds per head.<br><br><br>
The feed supplement containing composition of the present invention is preferably given to self-feeding cattle and is known to work well with dairy and beef cattle.<br><br><br>
The feed supplement of the present invention is a mixture of materials intended to meet the complete nutritional requirements of the animal, except for ruminants which also require a roughage source for proper feed utilization. The feed supplement includes primarily farinaceous materials such as grain, corn, or by-products and blends thereof. Other conventional adjuvants include vitamin and mineral supplements, calcium sources, nitrogen sources such as urea and other additives.<br><br>
Forage or roughage materials such as hay, grass, silage, haylage, and/or corn cobs are fed along with the feed supplement for the best results. Given that the availability of various roughage sources will be variable depending upon the geographic locality, local vegetation, time of year, and other factors, it is intended that the present invention not be limited to any particular roughage source used in combination with the feed supplement containing the feed intake limiting composition.<br><br><br><br>
The supplement composition is mixed in any convenient manner which ensures uniform distribution in the feed supplement and it is fed in any form which is suitable for feeding the animals. The feed supplement is pelletized, is compressed into large blocks, or is in meal form. Once mixed will remain well distributed throughout the feed supplement.<br><br><br>
The present invention is further illustrated in the following examples which describe various formulations of the feed supplement.<br><br><br>
In the market there are different categories of mineral mixtures like, for example, as given below.<br><br><br>
