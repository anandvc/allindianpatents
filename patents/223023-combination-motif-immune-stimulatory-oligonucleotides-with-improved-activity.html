				<td>COMBINATION MOTIF IMMUNE STIMULATORY OLIGONUCLEOTIDES WITH<br>
IMPROVED ACTIVITY<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to immunostimulatory nucleic acids,<br>
compositions thereof, and methods of using the immunostimulatory nucleic acids.<br>
Background<br>
Two main classes of immune stimulatory sequences are known in the art which have<br>
differing profiles of immune stimulatory activity. Krieg AM (2001) Trends Microbiol 9:249-<br>
52. These are so-called class B CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN), which are strong<br>
activators of B cells, and class A CpG ODN, which are strong activators of natural killer<br>
(NK) cells. In addition to these immune stimulatory sequences, at least two classes of<br>
neutralizing sequences are known, including CpG sequences in which the CG is preceded by<br>
a C or followed by a G (Krieg AM et al. (1998) Proc Natl AcadSci USA 95:12631-12636),<br>
and DNA sequences in which the CG is methylated. A neutralizing motif is a motif which<br>
has some degree of immunostimulatory capability when present in an otherwise non-<br>
stimulatory motif, but, which when present in the context of other immunostimulatory motifs<br>
serves to reduce the immunostimulatory potential of the other motifs.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A new class of immune stimulatory nucleic acids is provided herein. In some<br>
instances these nucleic acids have a CG-rich palindrome or CG-rich neutralizing motif.<br>
Applicants previously recognized and described oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing<br>
neutralizing motifs consisting of repeats of the sequence CG such as CGCGCG or a CG<br>
dinucleotide preceded by a C (i.e., CCG) and/or followed by a G (i.e., CGG, CCGG). These<br>
neutralizing motifs were believed cause some reduction in stimulatory effects of CpG<br>
containing ODN on multiple readouts, such as secretion of IL-6, IL-12, IFN-?, TNF-a, and<br>
induction of an antigen-specific immune response. Krieg AM et al. (1998) Proc Natl Acad<br>
Sci USA 95:12631-6.<br>
The present invention is based in part on the surprising discovery by the Applicants<br>
that certain ODN containing a combination of a stimulating motif and a neutralizing motif are<br>
highly immunostimulatory. The present invention is also based in part on the surprising<br>
discovery by the Applicants that ODN having certain CG-rich palindromic sequences,<br>
including palindromic sequences containing neutralizing motifs, are highly<br><br>
immunostimulatory. The neutralizing motif thus, may, but need not occur within the context<br>
of a palindromic sequence to be highly immunostimulatory.<br>
Furthermore, the immunostimulatory ODN of the instant invention have<br>
immunostimulatory effects previously associated with both of two distinct classes of CpG<br>
ODN, those that characteristically activate B cells (class B CpG ODN) and those that<br>
characteristically activate NK cells and induce production of interferon (IFN)-a (class A CpG<br>
ODN). The novel immunostimulatory ODN of the instant invention thus have a spectrum of<br>
immunostimulatory effects distinct from either class A CpG ODN or class B CpG ODN. The<br>
new class of immunostimulatory ODN of the instant invention is referred to as type C CpG<br>
ODN. As described in greater detail below, in certain embodiments the ODN of the present<br>
invention involve a combination of motifs wherein one motif is a CG-rich palindrome or a<br>
neutralizing motif, and another motif is a stimulatory motif, e.g., a CpG motif or the sequence<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
It has been discovered that certain oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN), which contain at<br>
least two distinct motifs have unique and desirable stimulatory effects on cells of the immune<br>
system. Some of these ODN have both a traditional "stimulatory" CpG sequence and a<br><br>
"GC-rich" or "B-cell neutralizing" motif. These combination motif nucleic acids have<br>
immune stimulating effects that fall somewhere between those effects associated with<br>
traditional "class B" CpG ODN, which are strong inducers of B cell activation and dendritic<br>
cell (DC) activation, and those effects associated with a more recently described class of<br>
immune stimulatory nucleic acids ("class A" CpG ODN) which are strong inducers of IFN-a<br>
and natural killer (NK) cell activation but relatively poor inducers of B-cell and DC<br>
activation. Krieg AM et al. (1995) Nature 374:546-9; Ballas ZK et al. (1996) J Immunol<br>
157:1840-5; Yamamoto S et al. (1992) J Immunol 148:4072-6. While preferred class B CpG<br>
ODN often have phosphorothioate backbones and preferred class A CpG ODN have mixed or<br>
chimeric backbones, the new class of combination motif immune stimulatory nucleic acids<br>
may have either stabilized, e.g., phosphorothioate, chimeric, or phosphodiester backbones.<br>
In one aspect the invention provides immune stimulatory nucleic acids belonging to<br>
this new class of combination motif immune-stimulatory nucleic acids. The B cell<br>
stimulatory domain is defined by a formula: 5' X1DCGHX2 3'. D is a nucleotide other than C.<br>
C is cytosine. G is guanine. H is a nucleotide other than G.<br>
X1 and X2 are any nucleic acid sequence 0 to 10 nuclcotides long. X1 may include a<br>
CG, in which case there is preferably a T immediately preceding this CG. In some<br>
embodiments DCG is TCG. X1 is preferably from 0 to 6 nucleotides in length. In some<br>
embodiments X2 does not contain any poly G or poly A motifs. In other embodiments the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid has a poly-T sequence at the 5' end or at the 3' end. As used<br>
herein, "poly-A" or "poly-T" shall refer to a stretch of four or more consecutive A's or T's<br>
respectively, e.g., 5' AAAA 3' or 5' TTTT 3'.<br>
As used herein, "poly-G end" shall refer to a stretch of four or more consecutive G's,<br>
e.g., 5' GGGG 3', occurring at the 5' end or the 3' end of a nucleic acid. As used herein,<br>
"poly-G nucleic acid" shall refer to a nucleic acid having the formula 5' X1X2GGGX3X4 3'<br>
wherein X1, X2, X3, and X4 are nucleotides and preferably at least one of X3 and X4 is a G.<br>
Some preferred designs for the B cell stimulatory domain under this formula comprise<br>
TTTTTCG, TCG, TTCG, TTTCG, TTTTCG, TCGT, TTCGT, TTTCGT, TCGTCGT.<br>
The second motif of the nucleic acid is referred to as either P or N and is positioned<br>
immediately 5' to X1 or immediately 3' to X2.<br>
N is a B-cell neutralizing sequence that begins with a CGG trinucleotide and is at<br>
least 10 nucleotides long. A B-cell neutralizing motif includes at least one CpG sequence in<br><br>
which the CG is preceded by a C or followed by a G (Krieg AM et al. (1998) Proc Natl Acad<br>
Sci USA 95:12631-12636) or is a CG containing DNA sequence in which the C of the CG is<br>
methylated. As used herein, "CpG" shall refer to a 5' cytosine (C) followed by a 3' guanine<br>
(G) and linked by a phosphate bond. At least the C of the 5' CG 3' must be unmethylated.<br>
Neutralizing motifs are motifs which has some degree of immunostimulatory capability when<br>
present in an otherwise non-stimulatory motif, but, which when present in the context of<br>
other immunostimulatory motifs serve to reduce the immunostimulatory potential of the other<br>
motifs.<br>
P is a GC-rich palindrome containing sequence at least 10 nucleotides long. As used<br>
herein, "palindrome" and, equivalently, "palindromic sequence" shall refer to an inverted<br>
repeat, i.e., a sequence such as ABCDEE'D'C'B'A' in which A and A', B and B', etc., are<br>
bases capable of forming the usual Watson-Crick base pairs.<br>
As used herein, "GC-rich palindrome" shall refer to a palindrome having a base<br>
composition of at least two-thirds G's and C's. In some embodiments the GC-rich domain is<br>
preferably 3' to the "B cell stimulatory domain". In the case of a 10-base long GC-rich<br>
palindrome, the palindrome thus contains at least 8 G's and C's. In the case of a 12-base long<br>
GC-rich palindrome, the palindrome also contains at least 8 G's and C's. In the case of a 14-<br>
mer GC-rich palindrome, at least ten bases of the palindrome are G's and C's. In some<br>
embodiments the GC-rich palindrome is made up exclusively of G's and C's.<br>
In some embodiments the GC-rich palindrome has a base composition of at least 81<br>
percent G's and C's. In the case of such a 10-base long GC-rich palindrome, the palindrome<br>
thus is made exclusively of G's and C's. In the case of such a 12-base long GC-rich<br>
palindrome, it is preferred that at least ten bases (83 percent) of the palindrome are G's and<br>
C's. In some preferred embodiments, a 12-base long GC-rich palindrome is made<br>
exclusively of G's and C's. In the case of a 14-mer GC-rich palindrome, at least twelve bases<br>
(86 percent) of the palindrome are G's and C's. In some preferred embodiments, a 14-base<br>
long GC-rich palindrome is made exclusively of G's and C's. The C's of a GC-rich<br>
palindrome can be unmethylated or they can be methylated.<br>
In general this domain has at least 3 Cs and Gs, more preferably 4 of each, and most<br>
preferably 5 or more of each. The number of Cs and Gs in this domain need not be identical.<br>
It is preferred that the Cs and Gs are arranged so that they are able to form a self-<br>
complementary duplex, or palindrome, such as CCGCGCGG. This may be interrupted by As<br><br>
or Ts, but it is preferred that the self-complementarity is at least partially preserved as for<br>
example in the motifs CGACGTTCGTCG (SEQ ID NO: 80) or CGGCGCCGTGCCG (SEQ<br>
ID NO: 81). When complementarity is not preserved, it is preferred that the non-<br>
complementary base pairs be TG. In a preferred embodiment there are no more than 3<br>
consecutive bases that are not part of the palindrome, preferably no more than 2, and most<br>
preferably only 1. In some embodiments the GC-rich palindrome includes at least one CGG<br>
trimer, at least one CCG trimer, or at least one CGCG tetramer. In other embodiments the<br>
GC-rich palindrome is not CCCCCCGGGGGG (SEQ ID NO: 31) or GGGGGGCCCCCC<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 32), CCCCCGGGGG (SEQ ID NO: 33) or GGGGGCCCCC (SEQ ID NO:<br>
34).<br>
At least one of the G's of the GC rich region may be substituted with an inosine (I).<br>
In some embodiments P includes more than one I.<br>
In certain embodiments the immunostimulatory nucleic acid has one of the following<br>
formulas 5' NX1DCGHX2 3', 5' X1DCGHX2N 3', 5' PX,DCGHX2 3', 5' X,DCGHX2P 3', 5'<br>
X,DCGHX2PX3 3', 5' X1DCGHPX3 3', 5' DCGHX2PX3 3', 5' TCGHX2PX3 3', 5' DCGHPXj<br>
3', or 5' DCGHP 3'.<br>
In other aspects the invention provides immune stimulatory nucleic acids which are<br>
defined by a formula: 5' N|PyGN2P 3'. N| is any sequence 1 to 6 nucleotides long. Py is a<br>
pyrimidine. G is guanine. N2 is any sequence 0 to 30 nucleotides long. P is a GC-rich<br>
palindrome containing sequence at least 10 nucleotides long.<br>
N1 and N2 may contain more than 50% pyrimidines, and more preferably more than<br>
50% T. N1 may include a CG, in which case there is preferably a T immediately preceding<br>
this CG. In some embodiments N1PyG is TCG (such as ODN 5376, which has a 5' TCGG),<br>
and most preferably a TCGN2, where N2 is not G.<br>
N1PyGN2P may include one or more inosine (I) nucleotides. Either the C or the G in<br>
Nl may be replaced by inosine, but the Cpl is preferred to the IpG. For inosine substitutions<br>
such as IpG, the optimal activity may be achieved with the use of a "semi-soft" or chimeric<br>
backbone, where the linkage between the IG or the CI is phosphodiester. N| may include at<br>
least one CI, TCI, IG or TIG motif.<br>
In certain embodiments N|PyGN2 is a sequence selected from the group consisting of<br>
TTTTTCG, TCG, TTCG, TTTCG, TTTTCG, TCGT, TTCGT, TTTCGT, and TCGTCGT.<br><br>
In other aspects the invention provides immune stimulatory nucleic acids which are<br>
defined by a formula: 5' NiPyG/ItyP 3'. Ni is any sequence 1 to 6 nucleotides long. Py is a<br>
pyrimidine, G/I refers to single nucleotide which is either a G or an I. G is guanine and I is<br>
inosine. N2 is any sequence 0 to 30 nucleotides long. P is a GC or IC rich palindrome<br>
containing sequence at least 10 nucleotides long. In some embodiments N1PyIN2 is<br>
TCITCITTTT (SEQ ID NO: 47).<br>
Some non-limiting examples of combination motif immune stimulatory nucleic acids,<br>
which are described by the formulas above, include the following:<br>

TCITCITTTTCGGCGGCCGCCG (ODN 5570, SEQ ID NO: 70).<br>
As used herein, "nucleic acid" and "oligonucleotide" are used interchangeably and<br>
shall refer to mean multiple nucleotides (i.e., molecules comprising a sugar (e.g., ribose or<br>
deoxyribose) linked to a phosphate group and to an exchangeable organic base, which is<br>
either a substituted pyrimidine (e.g., cytosine (C), thymine (T) or uracil (U)) or a substituted<br>
purine (e.g., adenine (A) or guanine (G)). As used herein, the terms refer to<br>
oligoribonucleotides as well as oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODN). The terms shall also<br>
include polynucleosides (i.e., a polynucleotide minus the phosphate) and any other organic<br><br>
base containing polymer. Nucleic acid molecules can be obtained from existing nucleic acid<br>
sources (e.g., genomic or cDNA), but are preferably synthetic (e.g., produced by nucleic acid<br>
synthesis).<br>
The terms nucleic acid and oligonucleotide also encompass nucleic acids or<br>
oligonucleotides with substitutions or modifications, such as in the bases and/or sugars. For<br>
example, they include nucleic acids having backbone sugars which are covalently attached to<br>
low molecular weight organic groups other than a hydroxyl group at the 31 position and other<br>
than a phosphate group at the 5' position. Thus modified nucleic acids may include a 2'-O-<br>
alkylated ribose group. In addition, modified nucleic acids may include sugars such as<br>
arabinose instead of ribose. Thus the nucleic acids may be heterogeneous in backbone<br>
composition thereby containing any possible combination of polymer units linked together<br>
such as peptide- nucleic acids (which have amino acid backbone with nucleic acid bases). In<br>
some embodiments, the nucleic acids are homogeneous in backbone composition. Nucleic<br>
acids also include substituted purines and pyrimidines such as C-5 propyne modified bases.<br>
Wagner RW et al. (1996) Nat Biotechnol 14:840-4. Purines and pyrimidines include but are<br>
not limited to adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymidine, 5-methylcytosine, 2-aminopurine,<br>
2-amino-6-chloropurine, 2,6-diaminopurine, hypoxanthine, and other naturally and<br>
non-naturally occurring nucleobases, substituted and unsubstituted aromatic moieties. Other<br>
such modifications are well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
The immunostimulatory oligonucleotides of the instant invention can encompass<br>
various chemical modifications and substitutions, in comparison to natural RNA and DNA,<br>
involving a phosphodiester internucleoside bridge, a p-D-ribose unit and/or a natural<br>
nucleoside base (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, uracil). Examples of chemical<br>
modifications are known to the skilled person and are described, for example, in Uhlmann E<br>
et al. (1990) Chem Rev 90:543; "Protocols for Oligonucleotides and Analogs" Synthesis and<br>
Properties &amp; Synthesis and Analytical Techniques, S. Agrawal, Ed, Humana Press, Totowa,<br>
USA 1993; Crooke ST et al. (1996) Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 36:107-129; and Hunziker<br>
J et al. (1995) Mod Synth Methods 7:331-417. An oligonucleotide according to the invention<br>
can have one or more modifications, wherein each modification is located at the a particular<br>
phosphodiester internucleoside bridge and/or at a particular p-D-ribose unit and/or at a<br>
particular natural nucleoside base position in comparison to an oligonucleotide of the same<br>
sequence which is composed of natural DNA or RNA.<br><br>
For example, the invention relates to an oligonucleotide which may comprise one or<br>
more modifications and wherein each modification is independently selected from:<br>
a)	the replacement of a sugar phosphate unit from the sugar phosphate backbone by<br>
another unit,<br>
b)	the replacement of a p-D-ribose unit by a modified sugar unit, and<br>
c)	the replacement of a natural nucleoside base by a modified nucleoside base.<br>
More detailed examples for the chemical modification of an oligonucleotide are as<br>
follows.<br>
A sugar phosphate unit (i.e., a P-D-ribose and phosphodiester internucleoside bridge<br>
together forming a sugar phosphate unit) from the sugar phosphate backbone (i.e., a sugar<br>
phosphate backbone is composed of sugar phosphate units) can be replaced by another unit,<br>
wherein the other unit is for example suitable to build up a "morpholino-derivative" oligomer<br>
(as described, for example, in Stirchak EP et al. (1989) Nucleic Acids Res 17:6129-41), that<br>
is, e.g., the replacement by a morpholino-derivative unit; or to build up a polyamide nucleic<br>
acid ("PNA"; as described for example, in Nielsen PE et al. (1994) Bioconjug Chem 5:3-7),<br>
that is, e.g., the replacement by a PNA backbone unit, e.g., by 2-aminoethylglycine.<br>
A p-ribose unit or a p-D-2'-deoxyribose unit can be replaced by a modified sugar unit,<br>
wherein the modified sugar unit is for example selected from ß-D-ribose, a-D-2'-<br>
deoxyribose, L-2'-deoxyribose, 2'-F-2'-deoxyribose, 2'-O-(C1-C6)alkyl-ribose, preferably 2'-<br>
O-(C1-C6)alkyl-ribose is 2'-O-methylribose, 2'-O-(C2-C6)alkenyl-ribose, 2'-[O-(C1-C6)alkyl-<br>
O-(C1-C6)alkyl]-ribose, 2'-NH2-2'-deoxyribose, ß-D-xylo-furanose, a-arabinofuranose,<br>
2,4-dideoxy-ß-D-erythro-hexo-pyranose, and carbocyclic (described, for example, in Froehler<br>
J (1992) Am Chem Soc 114:8320) and/or open-chain sugar analogs (described, for example,<br>
in Vandendriessche et al. (1993) Tetrahedron 49:7223) and/or bicyclosugar analogs<br>
(described, for example, in Tarkov M et al. (1993) Helv Chim Acta 76:481).<br>
A natural nucleoside base can be replaced by a modified nucleoside base, wherein the<br>
modified nucleoside base is for example selected from hypoxanthine, uracil, dihydrouracil,<br>
pseudouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-aminouracil, 5-(C1-C6)-alkyluracil, 5-(C2-C6)-<br>
alkenyluracil, 5-(C2-C6)-alkynyluracil, 5-(hydroxymethyl)uracil, 5-chlorouracil,<br>
5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-hydroxycytosine, 5-(C1-C6)-alkylcytosine, 5-(C2-C6)-<br>
alkenylcytosine, 5-(C2-C6)-alkynylcytosine, 5-chlorocytosine, 5-fluorocytosine,<br>
5-bromocytosine, N2-dimethylguanosine, 2,4-diamino-purine, 8-azapurine, a substituted<br><br>
7-deazapurine, preferably 7-dcaza-7-substituted and/or 7-deaza-8-substituted purine or other<br>
modifications of a natural nucleoside bases. This list is meant to be exemplary and is not to<br>
be interpreted to be limiting.<br>
As used herein, "immune stimulatory nucleic acid" and, equivalently,<br>
"immunostimulatory nucleic acid" shall refer to a ribonucleic acid or deoxyribonucleic acid<br>
molecule, derivative or analog thereof, characterized by its capacity to induce a functional<br>
aspect of a cell of the immune system. Such functional aspect of a cell of the immune system<br>
can include, for example, elaboration of a cytokine or chemokine, expression of a cell surface<br>
marker, secretion of an antibody, proliferation, or other activity in response to or directed<br>
against an antigen or antigen-bearing membrane-bound target.<br>
For use in the instant invention, the nucleic acids of the invention can be synthesized<br>
de novo using any of a number of procedures well known in the art, for example, the<br>
ß-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite method (Beaucage SL and Caruthers MH (1981) Tetrahedron<br>
Lett 22:1859); and the nucleoside H-phosphonate method (Garegg et al. (1986) Tetrahedron<br>
Lett 27:4051-4; Froehler et al. (1986) Nucl Acid Res 14:5399-407; Garegg et al. (1986)<br>
Tetrahedron Lett 27:4055-8; Gaffney et al. (1988) Tetrahedron Lett 29:2619-22). These<br>
chemistries can be performed by a variety of automated nucleic acid synthesizers available in<br>
the market. These nucleic acids are referred to as synthetic nucleic acids. Alternatively,<br>
nucleic acids of the invention can be produced on a large scale in plasmids, (see Sambrook T<br>
et al., "Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual", Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,<br>
New York, 1989) and separated into smaller pieces or administered whole. Nucleic acids can<br>
be prepared from existing nucleic acid sequences (e.g., genomic or cDNA) using known<br>
techniques, such as those employing restriction enzymes, exonucleases or endonucleases.<br>
Nucleic acids prepared in this manner are referred to as isolated nucleic acids. An isolated<br>
nucleic acid generally refers to a nucleic acid which is separated from components which it is<br>
normally associated with in nature. As an example, an isolated nucleic acid may be one<br>
which is separated from a cell, from a nucleus, from mitochondria or from chromatin. The<br>
combination motif nucleic acids of the instant invention encompass both synthetic and<br>
isolated combination motif nucleic acids.<br>
For use in vivo, the combination motif immunostimulatory nucleic acids may<br>
optionally be relatively resistant to degradation (e.g., are stabilized). A "stabilized nucleic<br>
acid molecule" shall mean a nucleic acid molecule that is relatively resistant to in vivo<br><br>
degradation (e.g., via an exonuclease or endonuclease). Nucleic acid stabilization can be<br>
accomplished via phosphate backbone modifications. Preferred stabilized nucleic acids of<br>
the instant invention have a modified backbone. It has been demonstrated that modification<br>
of the nucleic acid backbone provides enhanced activity of the combination motif<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids when administered in vivo. Combination motif<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids having phosphorothioate linkages in some instances<br>
provide maximal activity and protect the nucleic acid from degradation by intracellular<br>
exonucleases and endonucleases. Other modified nucleic acids include modified<br>
phosphodiester nucleic acids, combinations of phosphodiester and phosphorothioate nucleic<br>
acids (i.e., chimeric), methylphosphonate, methylphosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, p-<br>
ethoxy, and combinations thereof.<br>
Modified backbones such as phosphorothioates may be synthesized using automated<br>
techniques employing either phosphoramidate or H-phosphonate chemistries. Aryl-and<br>
alkyl-phosphonates can be made, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,469,863; and<br>
alkylphosphotriesters (in which the charged oxygen moiety is alkylated as described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,023,243 and European Patent No. 092,574) can be prepared by automated solid<br>
phase synthesis using commercially available reagents. Methods for making other DNA<br>
backbone modifications and substitutions have been described. Uhlmann E and Peyman A<br>
(1990) Chem Rev 90:544; Goodchild J (1990) Bioconjugate Chem 1:165.<br>
Other stabilized nucleic acids include: nonionic DNA analogs, such as alkyl- and aryl-<br>
phosphates (in which the charged phosphonate oxygen is replaced by an alkyl or aryl group),<br>
phosphodiester and alkylphosphotriesters, in which the charged oxygen moiety is alkylated.<br>
Nucleic acids which contain diol, such as tetraethyleneglycol or hexaethyleneglycol, at either<br>
or both termini have also been shown to be substantially resistant to nuclease degradation.<br>
In other embodiments the immunostimulatory nucleic acids may have phosphodiester<br>
or chimeric e.g., soft or semi-soft backbones. A chimeric backbone includes a combination<br>
of phosphodiester and modified backbone linkages. A chimeric oligonucleotide, for<br>
instance, may be a soft oligonucleotide or a semi-soft oligonucleotide.<br>
A soft oligonucleotide is an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide having a partially<br>
stabilized backbone, in which phosphodiester or phosphodiester-like internucleoside linkages<br>
occur only within and immediately adjacent to at least one internal pyrimidine nucleoside-<br>
guanosine (YG) dinucleotide. The at least one internal YG dinucleotide itself has a<br><br>
phosphodiester or phosphodiester-like intemucleoside linkage. A phosphodiester or<br>
phosphodiester-like intemucleoside linkage occurring immediately adjacent to the at least one<br>
internal YG dinucleotide can be 5', 3', or both 5' and 3' to the at least one internal YG<br>
dinucleotide. Preferably a phosphodiester or phosphodiester-like intemucleoside linkage<br>
occurring immediately adjacent to the at least one internal YG dinucleotide is itself an<br>
internal intemucleoside linkage. Thus for a sequence N1YGN2, wherein N1 and N2 are each,<br>
independent of the other, any single nucleotide, the YG dinucleotide has a phosphodiester or<br>
phosphodiester-like intemucleoside linkage, and in addition (a) N1 and Y are linked by a<br>
phosphodiester or phosphodiester-like intemucleoside linkage when N1 is an internal<br>
nucleotide, (b) G and N2 are linked by a phosphodiester or phosphodiester-like<br>
intemucleoside linkage when N2 is an internal nucleotide, or (c) N1 and Y are linked by a<br>
phosphodiester or phosphodiester-like intemucleoside linkage when N1 is an internal<br>
nucleotide and G and N2 are linked by a phosphodiester or phosphodiester-like<br>
intemucleoside linkage when N2 is an internal nucleotide.<br>
A semi-soft oligonucleotide is an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide having a<br>
partially stabilized backbone, in which phosphodiester or phosphodiester-like intemucleoside<br>
linkages occur only within at least one internal pyrimidine nucleoside-guanosine (YG)<br>
dinucleotide. Semi-soft oligonucleotides can have a number of advantages over<br>
immunostimulatory oligonucleotides with fully stabilized backbones. For instance, semi-soft<br>
oligonucleotides may possess increased immunostimulatory potency relative to<br>
corresponding fully stabilized immunostimulatory oligonucleotides.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids may be used to treat a subject to induce an<br>
immune response or treat an immune related disease such as, for example, infectious disease,<br>
cancer, and allergic disorders. As used herein, "subject" shall refer to a human or vertebrate<br>
animal including, but not limited to, a dog, cat, horse, cow, pig, sheep, goat, chicken,<br>
monkey, rabbit, rat, mouse, etc.<br>
As used herein, the terms "treat", "treating" and "treated" shall refer to a prophylactic<br>
treatment which increases the resistance of a subject to developing a disease or, in other<br>
words, decreases the likelihood that the subject will develop a disease or slows the<br>
development of the disease, as well as to a treatment after the subject has developed the<br>
disease in order to fight the disease, e.g., reduce or eliminate it altogether or prevent it from<br>
becoming worse. For example, when used with respect to the treatment of an infectious<br><br>
disease the terms refer to a prophylactic treatment which increases the resistance of a subject<br>
to a microorganism or, in other words, decreases the likelihood that the subject will develop<br>
an infectious disease to the microorganism, as well as to a treatment after the subject has been<br>
infected in order to fight the infectious disease, e.g., reduce or eliminate it altogether or<br>
prevent it from becoming worse. When used with respect to a disease such as cancer the<br>
terms refer to the prevention or delay of the development of a cancer, reducing the symptoms<br>
of cancer, and/or inhibiting or slowing the growth of an established cancer.<br>
Thus, the nucleic acids are useful as prophylactics for the induction of immunity of a<br>
subject at risk of developing an infection with an infectious organism or a subject at risk of<br>
developing an allergic disorder or cancer. A "subject at risk" as used herein is a subject who<br>
has any risk of exposure to an infection-causing infectious pathogen, exposure to an allergen,<br>
or developing cancer. For instance, a subject at risk may be a subject who is planning to<br>
travel to an area where a particular type of infectious agent or allergen is found or it may be a<br>
subject who through lifestyle or medical procedures is exposed to bodily fluids which may<br>
contain infectious organisms or even any subject living in an area that an infectious organism<br>
or an allergen has been identified and is exposed directly to the infectious agent or allergen.<br>
It also may be a subject at risk of biowarfare such as military personnel or those living in<br>
areas at risk of terrorist attack. Subjects at risk of developing infection also include general<br>
populations to which a medical agency recommends vaccination with a particular infectious<br>
organism antigen. If the antigen is an allergen and the subject develops allergic responses to<br>
that particular antigen and the subject is exposed to the antigen, i.e., during pollen season,<br>
then that subject is at risk of exposure to the antigen. Subjects at risk of developing cancer<br>
include those with a genetic predisposition or previously treated for cancer, and those<br>
exposed to carcinogens such as tobacco, asbestos, and other chemical toxins or excessive<br>
sunlight and other types of radiation. The nucleic acids are also useful as therapeutics in the<br>
treatment of infectious disease, cancer and allergic disorders.<br>
A "subject having an infection" is a subject that has been exposed to an infectious<br>
pathogen and has acute or chronic detectable levels of the pathogen in the body. The nucleic<br>
acids can be used alone, or in conjunction with other therapeutic agents such as an antigen or<br>
an antimicrobial medicament to mount an immune response that is capable of reducing the<br>
level of or eradicating the infectious pathogen. The method entails administering to a subject<br>
having or at risk of developing an infection an effective amount of a combination motif<br><br>
immune stimulatory nucleic acid of the invention to treat the infection. The method can be<br>
used to treat viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections in human and non-human<br>
vertebrate subjects.<br>
As used herein, "infection" and, equivalently, "infectious disease" shall refer to a<br>
disease arising from the presence of a foreign microorganism in the body of a subject. A<br>
foreign microorganism may be a virus, a bacterium, a fungus, or a parasite.<br>

The foregoing lists of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other infectious microorganisms is<br>
understood to be representative and not limiting. Other medically relevant microorganisms<br>
have been described extensively in the literature, e.g., see C.G.A Thomas, Medical<br>
Microbiology, Bailliere Tindall, Great Britain 1983, the entire contents of which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
Although many of the microbial agents described above relate to human disorders, the<br>
invention is also useful for treating non-human vertebrates. Non-human vertebrates are also<br>
capable of developing infections which can be prevented or treated with the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids disclosed herein. For instance, in addition to the treatment<br>
of infectious human diseases, the methods of the invention are useful for treating infections<br>
of animals.<br>
Infectious viruses of both human and non-human vertebrates include retroviruses,<br>
RNA viruses and DNA viruses. This group of retroviruses includes both simple retroviruses<br>
and complex retroviruses. The simple retroviruses include the subgroups of B-type<br>
retroviruses, C-type retroviruses and D-type retroviruses. An example of a B-type retrovirus<br>

include viruses which do not fit into the above families, such as Kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jacob<br>
disease viruses and chronic infectious neuropathic agents (CHINA virus).<br>
The nucleic acids may be administered to a subject with an anti-microbial agent. An<br>
anti-microbial agent, as used herein, refers to a naturally-occurring, synthetic, or semi-<br>
synthetic compound which is capable of killing or inhibiting infectious microorganisms. The<br>
type of anti-microbial agent useful according to the invention will depend upon the type of<br>
microorganism with which the subject is infected or at risk of becoming infected. Antimicrobial <br>
agents include but are not limited to anti-bacterial agents, anti-viral agents, anti-<br>
fungal agents and anti-parasitic agents. Phrases such as "anti-infective agent", "anti-bacterial<br>
agent", "anti-viral agent", "anti-fungal agent", "anti-parasitic agent" and "parasiticide" have<br>
well-established meanings to those of ordinary skill in the art and are defined in standard<br>
medical texts. Briefly, anti-bacterial agents kill or inhibit bacteria, and include antibiotics as<br>
well as other synthetic or natural compounds having similar functions. Antibiotics are low<br>
molecular weight molecules which are produced as secondary metabolites by cells, such as<br>
microorganisms. In general, antibiotics interfere with one or more bacterial functions or<br>
structures which are specific for the microorganism and which are not present in host cells.<br>
Anti-viral agents can be isolated from natural sources or synthesized and are useful for killing<br>
or inhibiting viruses. Anti-fungal agents are used to treat superficial fungal infections as well<br>
as opportunistic and primary systemic fungal infections. Anti-parasite agents kill or inhibit<br>
parasites.<br>
Antibacterial agents kill or inhibit the growth or function of bacteria. A large class of<br>
antibacterial agents is antibiotics. Antibiotics, which are effective for killing or inhibiting a<br><br>
wide range of bacteria, are referred to as broad spectrum antibiotics. Other types of<br>
antibiotics are predominantly effective against the bacteria of the class gram-positive or<br>
gram-negative. These types of antibiotics are referred to as narrow spectrum antibiotics.<br>
Other antibiotics which are effective against a single organism or disease and not against<br>
other types of bacteria, are referred to as limited spectrum antibiotics. Antibacterial agents<br>
are sometimes classified based on their primary mode of action. In general, antibacterial<br>
agents are cell wall synthesis inhibitors, cell membrane inhibitors, protein synthesis<br>
inhibitors, nucleic acid synthesis or functional inhibitors, and competitive inhibitors.<br>
Antiviral agents are compounds which prevent infection of cells by viruses or<br>
replication of the virus within the cell. There are many fewer antiviral drugs than<br>
antibacterial drugs because the process of viral replication is so closely related to DNA<br>
replication within the host cell, that non-specific antiviral agents would often be toxic to the<br>
host. There are several stages within the process of viral infection which can be blocked or<br>
inhibited by antiviral agents. These stages include, attachment of the virus to the host cell<br>
(immunoglobulin or binding peptides), uncoating of the virus (e.g., amantadine), synthesis or<br>
translation of viral mRNA (e.g., interferon), replication of viral RNA or DNA (e.g.,<br>
nucleoside analogues), maturation of new virus proteins (e.g., protease inhibitors), and<br>
budding and release of the virus.<br>
Nucleotide analogues are synthetic compounds which are similar to nucleotides, but<br>
which have an incomplete or abnormal deoxyribose or ribose group. Once the nucleotide<br>
analogues are in the cell, they are phosphorylated, producing the triphosphate formed which<br>
competes with normal nucleotides for incorporation into the viral DNA or RNA. Once the<br>
triphosphate form of the nucleotide analogue is incorporated into the growing nucleic acid<br>
chain, it causes irreversible association with the viral polymcrase and thus chain termination.<br>
Nucleotide analogues include, but are not limited to, acyclovir (used for the treatment of<br>
herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus), gancyclovir (useful for the treatment of<br>
cytomegalovirus), idoxuridine, ribavirin (useful for the treatment of respiratory syncitial<br>
virus), dideoxyinosine, dideoxycytidine, and zidovudine (azidothymidine).<br>
Anti-fungal agents are useful for the treatment and prevention of infective fungi.<br>
Anti-fungal agents are sometimes classified by their mechanism of action. Some anti-fungal<br>
agents function as cell wall inhibitors by inhibiting glucose synthase. These include, but are<br>
not limited to, basiungin/ECB. Other anti-fungal agents function by destabilizing membrane<br><br>
integrity. These include, but are not limited to, immidazoles, such as clotrimazole,<br>
sertaconzole, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, and voriconacole, as well<br>
as FK 463, amphotericin B, BAY 38-9502, MK 991, pradimicin, UK 292, butenafine, and<br>
terbinafine. Other anti-fungal agents function by breaking down chitin (e.g., chitinase) or<br>
immunosuppression (501 cream).<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids may be used, either alone or in combination<br>
with an anti-cancer therapy, for the treatment of cancer. The method entails administering to<br>
a subject having or at risk of developing cancer an effective amount of a combination motif<br>
immune stimulatory nucleic acid of the invention to treat cancer.<br>
A "subject having a cancer" is a subject that has detectable cancerous cells. The<br>
cancer may be a malignant or non-malignant cancer. Cancers or tumors include but are not<br>
limited to biliary tract cancer; brain cancer; breast cancer; cervical cancer; choriocarcinoma;<br>
colon cancer; endometrial cancer; esophageal cancer; gastric cancer; intraepithelial<br>
neoplasms; lymphomas; liver cancer; lung cancer (e.g., small cell and non-small cell);<br>
melanoma; neuroblastomas; oral cancer; ovarian cancer; pancreas cancer; prostate cancer;<br>
rectal cancer; sarcomas; skin cancer; testicular cancer; thyroid cancer; and renal cancer, as<br>
well as other carcinomas and sarcomas. In one embodiment the cancer is hairy cell leukemia,<br>
chronic myelogenous leukemia, cutaneous T-cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, follicular<br>
Iymphoma, malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, prostate<br>
carcinoma, bladder cell carcinoma, or colon carcinoma.<br>
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in companion animals (i.e., cats and<br>
dogs). Malignant disorders commonly diagnosed in dogs and cats include but are not limited<br>
to lymphosarcoma, osteosarcoma, mammary tumors, mastocytoma, brain tumor, melanoma,<br>
adenosquamous carcinoma, carcinoid lung tumor, bronchial gland tumor, bronchiolar<br>
adenocarcinoma, fibroma, myxochondroma, pulmonary sarcoma, neurosarcoma, osteoma,<br>
papilloma, retinoblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, Wilms' tumor, Burkitt's lymphoma,<br>
microglioma, neuroblastoma, osteoclastoma, oral neoplasia, fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma and<br>
rhabdomyosarcoma. Other neoplasms in dogs include genital squamous cell carcinoma,<br>
transmissible venereal tumor, testicular tumor, seminoma, Sertoli cell tumor,<br>
hemangiopericytoma, histiocytoma, chloroma (granulocytic sarcoma), corneal papilloma,<br>
corneal squamous cell carcinoma, hemangiosarcoma, pleural mesothelioma, basal cell tumor,<br>
thymoma, stomach tumor, adrenal gland carcinoma, oral papillomatosis,<br><br>
hemangioendothelioma and cystadenoma. Additional malignancies diagnosed in cats include<br>
follicular lymphoma, intestinal lymphosarcoma, fibrosarcoma and pulmonary squamous cell<br>
carcinoma. The ferret, an ever-more popular house pet, is known to develop insulinoma,<br>
lymphoma, sarcoma, neuroma, pancreatic islet cell tumor, gastric MALT lymphoma and<br>
gastric adenocarcinoma.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids may also be administered in conjunction with<br>
an anti-cancer therapy. Anti-cancer therapies include cancer medicaments, radiation and<br>
surgical procedures. As used herein, a "cancer medicament" refers to an agent which is<br>
administered to a subject for the purpose of treating a cancer. Various types of medicaments<br>
for the treatment of cancer are described herein. For the purpose of this specification, cancer<br>
medicaments are classified as chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapeutic agents, cancer<br>
vaccines, hormone therapy, and biological response modifiers.<br>
The use of immunostimulatory nucleic acids in conjunction with immunotherapeutic<br>
agents such as monoclonal antibodies is able to increase long-term survival through a number<br>
of mechanisms including significant enhancement of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity<br>
(ADCC), activation of NK cells and an increase in IFN-a levels. ADCC can be performed<br>
using an immunostimulatory nucleic acid in combination with an antibody specific for a<br>
cellular target, such as a cancer cell. When the immunostimulatory nucleic acid is<br>
administered to a subject in conjunction with the antibody the subject's immune system is<br>
induced to kill the tumor cell. The antibodies useful in the ADCC procedure include<br>
antibodies which interact with a cell in the body. Many such antibodies specific for cellular<br>
targets have been described in the art and many are commercially available. The nucleic<br>
acids when used in combination with monoclonal antibodies serve to reduce the dose of the<br>
antibody required to achieve a biological result.<br>
Other types of chemotherapeutic agents which can be used according to the invention<br>
include Aminoglutethimide, Asparaginase, Busulfan, Carboplatin, Chlorombucil, Cytarabine<br>
HC1, Dactinomycin, Daunorubicin HC1, Estramustine phosphate sodium, Etoposide (VP16-<br>
213), Floxuridine, Fluorouracil (5-FU), Flutamide, Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide),<br>

analogue), Lomustine (CCNU), Mechlorethamine HC1 (nitrogen mustard), Mercaptopurine,<br>
Mesna, Mitotane (o.p'-DDD), Mitoxantrone HC1, Octreotide, Plicamycin, Procarbazine HC1,<br>
Streptozocin, Tamoxifen citrate, Thioguanine, Thiotepa, Vinblastine sulfate, Amsacrine (m-<br><br>

(2'deoxycoformycin), Semustine (methyl-CCNU), Teniposide (VM-26) and Vindesine<br>
sulfate.<br>
Cancer vaccines are medicaments which are intended to stimulate an endogenous<br>
immune response against cancer cells. Currently produced vaccines predominantly activate<br>
the humoral immune system (i.e., the antibody dependent immune response). Other vaccines<br>
currently in development are focused on activating the cell-mediated immune system<br>
including cytotoxic T lymphocytes which are capable of killing tumor cells. Cancer vaccines<br>
generally enhance the presentation of cancer antigens to both antigen presenting cells (e.g.,<br>
macrophages and dendritic cells) and/or to other immune cells such as T cells, B cells, and<br>
NK cells. In some instances, cancer vaccines may be used along with adjuvants, such as<br>
those described above.<br>
Some cancer cells are antigenic and thus can be targeted by the immune system. In<br>
one aspect, the combined administration of immunostimulatory nucleic acids and cancer<br>
medicaments, particularly those which are classified as cancer immunotherapies, is useful for<br>
stimulating a specific immune response against a cancer antigen, used herein, the terms<br>
"cancer antigen" and "tumor antigen" are used, interchangeably to refer to antigens which are<br>
differentially expressed by cancer cells and can thereby be exploited in order to target cancer<br>
cells. Cancer antigens are antigens which can potentially stimulate apparently tumor-specific<br>
immune responses. Some of these antigens are encoded, although not necessarily expressed,<br>
by normal cells. These antigens can be characterized as those which are normally silent (i.e.,<br>
not expressed) in normal cells, those that are expressed only at certain stages of<br>
differentiation and those that are temporally expressed such as embryonic and fetal antigens.<br>
Other cancer antigens are encoded by mutant cellular genes, such as oncogenes (e.g.,<br>
activated ras oncogene), suppressor genes (e.g., mutant p53), fusion proteins resulting from<br>
internal deletions or chromosomal translocations. Still other cancer antigens can be encoded<br>
by viral genes such as those carried on RNA and DNA tumor viruses. "Tumor-associated"<br>
antigens are present in both tumor cells and normal cells but are present in a different<br>
quantity or a different form in tumor cells. Examples of such antigens are oncofetal antigens<br>
(e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen), differentiation antigens (e.g., T and Tn antigens), and<br>
oncogene products (e.g., HER/neu).<br><br>
Cancer antigens, such as those present in cancer vaccines or those used to prepare<br>
cancer immunotherapies, can be prepared from crude cancer cell extracts, as described in<br>
Cohen PA et al. (1994) Cancer Res 54:1055-8, or by partially purifying the antigens, using<br>
recombinant technology, or de novo synthesis of known antigens. Cancer antigens can be<br>
used in the form of immunogenic portions of a particular antigen or in some instances a<br>
whole cell or a tumor mass can be used as the antigen. Such antigens can be isolated or<br>
prepared recombinantly or by any other means known in the art.<br>
Other vaccines take the form of dendritic cells which have been exposed to cancer<br>
antigens in vitro, have processed the antigens and are able to express the cancer antigens at<br>
their cell surface in the context of MHC molecules for effective antigen presentation to other<br>
immune system cells. Dendritic cells form the link between the innate and the acquired<br>
immune system by presenting antigens and through their expression of pattern recognition<br>
receptors which detect microbial molecules like LPS in their local environment.<br>
The combination motif immunostimulatory nucleic acids are useful for the treatment<br>
of allergy, including asthma. The combination motif immune stimulatory nucleic acids can<br>
be used, either alone or in combination with an allergy/asthma medicament, to treat allergy.<br>
The method entails administering to a subject having or at risk of developing an allergic or<br>
asthmatic condition an effective amount of a combination motif immune stimulatory nucleic<br>
acid of the invention to treat the allergic or asthmatic condition.<br>
As used herein, "allergy" shall refer to acquired hypersensitivity to a substance<br>
(allergen). Allergic conditions include eczema, allergic rhinitis or coryza, hay fever,<br>
bronchial asthma, urticaria (hives) and food allergies, and other atopic conditions. A "subject<br>
having an allergy" is a subject that has or is at risk of developing an allergic reaction in<br>
response to an allergen. An "allergen" refers to a substance that can induce an allergic or<br>
asthmatic response in a susceptible subject. The list of allergens is enormous and can include<br>
pollens, insect venoms, animal dander, dust, fungal spores and drugs (e.g., penicillin).<br>
Examples of natural animal and plant allergens include proteins specific to the<br>
following genuses: Canine (Canis familiaris); Dermatophagoides (e.g., Dermatophagoides<br>
farinae); Felis (Felis domesticus); Ambrosia (Ambrosia artemiisfolia; Lolium (e.g., Lolium<br>
perenne or Lolium multiflorum); Cryptomeria (Cryptomeriajaponica); Alternaria (Alternaria<br>
alternata); Alder; Alnus (Alnus gultinosa); Betula (Betula verrucosa); Quercus (Quercus<br>
alba); Olea (Olea europa); Artemisia (Artemisia vulgaris); Plantago (e.g., Plantago<br><br>
lanceolata); Parielaria (e.g., Parietaria officinalis or Parietaria judaica); Blattella (e.g.,<br>
Blattella germanica); Apis (e.g., Apis multiflorum); Cupressus (e.g., Cupressus sempervirens,<br>
Cupressus arizonica and Cupressus macrocarpa); Juniperus (e.g., Juniperus sabinoides,<br>
Juniperus virginiana, Juniperus communis and Juniperus ashei); Thuya (e.g., Thuya<br>
orientalis); Chamaecyparis (e.g., Chamaecyparis obtusa); Periplaneta (e.g., Periplanela<br>
americana); Agropyron (e.g., Agropyron repens); Secale (e.g., Secale cereale); Triticum<br>
(e.g., Triticum aestivum); Dactylis (e.g., Dactylis glomerata); Festuca (e.g., Fesluca elatior);<br>
Poa (e.g., .Poor pratensis or Poa compressa); Avena (e.g., Avena sativa); Holcus (e.g., Holcus<br>
lanatus); Anthoxanthum (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum); Arrhenatherum (e.g.,<br>
Arrhenatherum elatius); Agrostis (e.g., Agrostis alba); Phleum (e.g., Phleum pratense);<br>
Phalaris (e.g., Phalaris arundinacea); Paspalum (e.g., Paspalum notatum); Sorghum (e.g.,<br>
Sorghum halepensis); and Bromus (e.g., Bromus inermis).<br>
As used herein, "asthma" shall refer to a disorder of the respiratory system<br>
characterized by inflammation, narrowing of the airways and increased reactivity of the<br>
airways to inhaled agents. Asthma is frequently, although not exclusively, associated with<br>
atopic or allergic symptoms.<br>
An "asthma/allergy medicament" as used herein is a composition of matter which<br>
reduces the symptoms, inhibits the asthmatic or allergic reaction, or prevents the development<br>
of an allergic or asthmatic reaction. Various types of medicaments for the treatment of<br>
asthma and allergy are described in the Guidelines For The Diagnosis and Management of<br>
Asthma, Expert Panel Report 2, NIH Publication No. 97/4051, July 19, 1997, the entire<br>
contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the medicaments as<br>
described in the NIH publication is presented below.<br>
In most embodiments the asthma/allergy medicament is useful to some degree for<br>
treating both asthma and allergy. Some asthma/allergy medicaments are preferably used in<br>
combination with the immunostimulatory nucleic acids to treat asthma. These are referred to<br>
as asthma medicaments. Asthma medicaments include, but are not limited, PDE-4 inhibitors,<br>
bronchodilator/beta-2 agonists, K+ channel openers, VLA-4 antagonists, neurokin<br>
antagonists, TXA2 synthesis inhibitors, xanthanines, arachidonic acid antagonists, 5<br>
lipoxygenase inhibitors, thromboxin A2 receptor antagonists, thromboxane A2 antagonists,<br>
inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase activation proteins, and protease inhibitors.<br><br>
Other asthma/allergy medicaments are preferably used in combination with the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids to treat allergy. These are referred to as allergy<br>
medicaments. Allergy medicaments include, but are not limited to, anti-histamines, steroids,<br>
immunomodulators, and prostaglandin inducers. Anti-histamines are compounds which<br>
counteract histamine released by mast cells or basophils. These compounds are well known<br>
in the art and commonly used for the treatment of allergy. Anti-histamines include, but are<br>
not limited to, loratidine, cetirizine, buclizine, ceterizine analogues, fexofenadine,<br>
terfenadine, desloratadine, norastemizole, epinastine, ebastine, ebastine, astemizole,<br>
levocabastine, azelastine, tranilast, terfenadine, mizolastine, betatastine, CS 560, and HSR<br>
609. Prostaglandin inducers are compounds which induce prostaglandin activity.<br>
Prostaglandins function by regulating smooth muscle relaxation. Prostaglandin inducers<br>
include, but are not limited to, S-5751.<br>
The steroids include, but are not limited to, beclomethasone, fluticasone,<br>
tramcinolone, budesonide, corticosteroids and budesonide. The combination of<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids and steroids are particularly well suited to the treatment of<br>
young subjects (e.g., children). To date, the use of steroids in children has been limited by<br>
the observation that some steroid treatments have been reportedly associated with growth<br>
retardation. Thus, according to the present invention, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids<br>
can be used in combination with growth retarding steroids, and can thereby provide a "steroid<br>
sparing effect." The combination of the two agents can result in lower required doses of<br>
steroids.<br>
The immunomodulators include, but are not limited to, the group consisting of anti-<br>
inflammatory agents, leukotriene antagonists, IL-4 muteins, soluble IL-4 receptors,<br>
immunosuppressants (such as tolerizing peptide vaccine), anti-IL-4 antibodies, IL-4<br>
antagonists, anti-IL-5 antibodies, soluble IL-13 receptor-Fc fusion proteins, anti-IL-9<br>
antibodies, CCR3 antagonists, CCR5 antagonists, VLA-4 inhibitors, and , and<br>
downregulators of IgE.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids of the invention can be used to induce type 1<br>
IFN, i.e., IFN-a and IFN-ß. The method involves contacting a cell capable of expressing a<br>
type 1 IFN with an effective amount of a combination motif immune stimulatory nucleic acid<br>
of the invention to induce type 1 IFN expression by the cell. It has recently been appreciated<br>
that the major producer cell type of IFN-a in humans is the plasmacytoid dendritic cell<br><br>
(pDC). This type of cell occurs at very low frequency (0.2-0.4 percent) in PBMC and is<br>
characterized by a phenotype that is lineage negative (i.e., does not stain for CD3, CD 14,<br>
CD19, or CD56) and CD11c negative, while positive for CD4, CD123 (IL-3Ra), and class II<br>
major histocompatibility complex (MHC class II). Grouard G et al. (1997) J Exp Med<br>
185:1101-11; Rissoan M-C et al. (1999) Science 283:1183-6; Siegal FP et al. (1999) Science<br>
284:1835-7; Cella M et al. (1999) Nat Med 5:919-23. Methods of measuring type 1 IFN are<br>
well known by those skilled in the art, and they include, for example, enzyme-linked<br>
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), bioassay, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).<br>
Assays of this sort can be performed using readily available commercial reagents and kits.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids of the invention may be used to activate NK<br>
cells. The method involves contacting an NK cell with an effective amount of a combination<br>
motif immune stimulatory nucleic acid of the invention to activate the NK cell. The<br>
activation of the NK cells may be direct activation or indirect activation. Indirect activation<br>
refers to the induction of cytokines or other factors which cause the subsequent activation of<br>
the NK cells. NK cell activation can be assessed by various methods, including<br>
measurement of lytic activity, measurement of induction of activation markers such as CD69,<br>
and measurement of induction of certain cytokines. In addition to their characteristic ability<br>
to kill certain tumor targets spontaneously, NK cells participate in ADCC and are major<br>
producers of IFN-?, TNF-a, GM-CSF and IL-3.<br>
The prototypical NK-sensitive cell target for mouse NK cells is yeast artificial<br>
chromosome (YAC)-1, a thymoma derived from Moloney virus-infected A strain mice. For<br>
human NK cells, a standard target is K562, a cell line derived from an erythroleukemic<br>
lineage. In microtiter plates, a constant number of radiolabeled targets (e.g., 5lCr-labeled<br>
K562) is incubated either alone (spontaneous), with detergent (maximum), or with varying<br>
numbers of effector cells (experimental). The ratio of effector to target cells is referred to as<br>
the E.T ratio. Enriched, activated NK cells typically are effective at E:T ratios of less than<br>
10:1, while unfractionated PBMCs or splenocytes require E:T ratios of 100:1 or more.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids also are useful as adjuvants for inducing a<br>
systemic and/or mucosal immune response. The combination motif immune stimulatory<br>
nucleic acids of the invention can be delivered to a subject exposed to an antigen to produce<br>
an enhanced immune response to the antigen. Thus for example combination motif immune<br>
stimulatory nucleic acids are useful as vaccine adjuvants.<br><br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids may be administered in combination with non-<br>
nucleic acid adjuvants. A non-nucleic acid adjuvant is any molecule or compound except for<br>
the immunostimulatory nucleic acids described herein which can stimulate the humoral<br>
and/or cellular immune response. Non-nucleic acid adjuvants include, for instance, adjuvants<br>
that create a depot effect, immune stimulating adjuvants, and adjuvants that create a depo<br>
effect and stimulate the immune system. A non-nucleic acid mucosal adjuvant as used herein<br>
is an adjuvant other than a immunostimulatory nucleic acid that is capable of inducing a<br>
mucosal immune response in a subject when administered to a mucosal surface in<br>
conjunction with an antigen.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids of the invention may be formulated as<br>
pharmaceutical compositions in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids may be directly administered to the subject or may be<br>
administered in conjunction with a nucleic acid delivery complex. A nucleic acid delivery<br>
complex shall mean a nucleic acid molecule associated with (e.g., ionically or covalently<br>
bound to; or encapsulated within) a targeting means (e.g., a molecule that results in higher<br>
affinity binding to target cell (e.g., B-cell surfaces) and/or increased cellular uptake by target<br>
cells). Examples of nucleic acid delivery complexes include nucleic acids associated with a<br>
sterol (e.g., cholesterol), a lipid (e.g., a cationic Iipid, virosome or liposome), or a target cell<br>
specific binding agent (e.g., a ligand recognized by target cell specific receptor). Preferred<br>
complexes may be sufficiently stable in vivo to prevent significant uncoupling prior to<br>
internalization by the target cell. However, the complex can be cleavable under appropriate<br>
conditions within the cell so that the nucleic acid is released in a functional form.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acid and/or the antigen and/or other therapeutics may<br>
be administered alone (e.g., in saline or buffer) or using any delivery vehicles known in the<br>
art. For instance the following delivery vehicles have been described: Cochleates (Gould-<br>
Fogerite et al., 1994, 1996); Emulsomes (Vancott et al., 1998, Lowell et al., 1997); ISCOMs<br>
(Mowat et al., 1993, Carlsson et al., 1991, Hu et., 1998, Morein et al., 1999); Liposomes<br>
(Childers et al., 1999, Michalek et al., 1989, 1992, de Haan 1995a, 1995b); Microspheres<br>
(Gupta et al., 1998, Jones et al., 1996, Maloy et al., 1994, Moore et al., 1995, O'Hagan et al.,<br>
1994, Eldridge et al., 1989); Polymers (e.g., carboxymethylcellulose, chitosan) (Hamajima et<br>
al., 1998, Jabbal-Gill et al., 1998); Polymer rings (Wyatt et al., 1998); Proteosomes (Vancott<br>
et al., 1998, Lowell et al., 1988, 1996, 1997); Virosomes (Gluck et al., 1992, Mengiardi et al.,<br><br>
1995, Cryz et al., 1998); Virus-like particles (Jiang et al., 1999, Leibl et al., 1998). Other<br>
delivery vehicles are known in the art.<br>
Subject doses of the compounds described herein for mucosal or local delivery<br>
typically range from about 0.1 µg to 10 mg per administration, which depending on the<br>
application could be given daily, weekly, or monthly and any other amount of time<br>
therebetween. More typically mucosal or local doses range from about 10 µg to 5 mg per<br>
administration, and most typically from about 100 µg to 1 mg, with 2 - 4 administrations<br>
being spaced days or weeks apart. More typically, immune stimulant doses range from 1 µg<br>
to 10 mg per administration, and most typically 10 µg to 1 mg, with daily or weekly<br>
administrations. Subject doses of the compounds described herein for parenteral delivery for<br>
the purpose of inducing an antigen-specific immune response, wherein the compounds are<br>
delivered with an antigen but not another therapeutic agent are typically 5 to 10,000 times<br>
higher than the effective mucosal dose for vaccine adjuvant or immune stimulant<br>
applications, and more typically 10 to 1,000 times higher, and most typically 20 to 100 times<br>
higher. Doses of the compounds described herein for parenteral delivery for the purpose of<br>
inducing an innate immune response or for increasing ADCC or for inducing an antigen<br>
specific immune response when the immunostimulatory nucleic acids are administered in<br>
combination with other therapeutic agents or in specialized delivery vehicles typically range<br>
from about 0.1 µg to 10 mg per administration, which depending on the application could be<br>
given daily, weekly, or monthly and any other amount of time therebetween. More typically<br>
parenteral doses for these purposes range from about 10 µg to 5 mg per administration, and<br>
most typically from about 100 µg to 1 mg, with 2-4 administrations being spaced days or<br>
weeks apart. In some embodiments, however, parenteral doses for these purposes may be<br>
used in a range of 5 to 10,000 times higher than the typical doses described above.<br>
As used herein, "effective amount" shall refer to the amount necessary or sufficient to<br>
realize a desired biological effect. For example, an effective amount of an<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid for treating an infection is that amount necessary to treat the<br>
infection. Combined with the teachings provided herein, by choosing among the various<br>
active compounds and weighing factors such as potency, relative bioavailability, patient body<br>
weight, severity of adverse side-effects and preferred mode of administration, an effective<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic treatment regimen can be planned which does not cause<br>
substantial toxicity and yet is entirely effective to treat the particular subject. The effective<br><br>
amount for any particular application can vary depending on such factors as the disease or<br>
condition being treated, the particular immunostimulatory nucleic acid being administered,<br>
the antigen, the size of the subject, or the severity of the disease or condition. One of<br>
ordinary skill in the art can empirically determine the effective amount of a particular<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid and/or antigen and/or other therapeutic agent without<br>
necessitating undue experimentation.<br>
For any compound described herein the therapeutically effective amount can be<br>
initially determined from animal models. A therapeutically effective dose can also be<br>
determined from human data for CpG oligonucleotides which have been tested in humans<br>
(human clinical trials have been initiated) and for compounds which are known to exhibit<br>
similar pharmacological activities, such as other mucosal adjuvants, e.g., LT and other<br>
antigens for vaccination purposes, for the mucosal or local administration. Higher doses are<br>
required for parenteral administration. The applied dose can be adjusted based on the relative<br>
bioavailability and potency of the administered compound. Adjusting the dose to achieve<br>
maximal efficacy based on the methods described above and other methods as are well-<br>
known in the art is well within the capabilities of the ordinarily skilled artisan.<br>
The formulations of the invention are administered in pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
solutions, which may routinely contain pharmaceutically acceptable concentrations of salt,<br>
buffering agents, preservatives, compatible carriers, adjuvants, and optionally other<br>
therapeutic ingredients.<br>
For use in therapy, an effective amount of the immunostimulatory nucleic acid can be<br>
administered to a subject by any mode that delivers the nucleic acid to the desired surface,<br>
e.g., mucosal, systemic. Administering the pharmaceutical composition of the present<br>
invention may be accomplished by any means known to the skilled artisan. Preferred routes<br>
of administration include but are not limited to oral, parenteral, intramuscular, intranasal,<br>
intratracheal, inhalation, ocular, sublingual, vaginal, and rectal.<br>
For oral administration, the compounds (i.e., immunostimulatory nucleic acids,<br>
antigens and other therapeutic agents) can be formulated readily by combining the active<br>
compound(s) with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers<br>
 enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules,<br>
liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a subject to be<br>
treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained as solid excipient,<br><br>
optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding<br>
suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in<br>
particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose<br>
preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch,<br>
gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents<br>
may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt<br>
thereof such as sodium alginate. Optionally the oral formulations may also be formulated in<br>
saline or buffers for neutralizing internal acid conditions or may be administered without any<br>
carriers.<br>
Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated<br>
sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions,<br>
and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the<br>
tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active<br>
compound doses.<br>
Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made<br>
of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol<br>
or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler<br>
such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate<br>
and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or<br>
suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene<br>
glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. Microspheres formulated for oral<br>
administration may also be used. Such microspheres have been well defined in the art. All<br>
formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration.<br>
For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges<br>
formulated in conventional manner.<br>
For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present<br>
invention may be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from<br>
pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g.,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide<br>
or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined<br><br>
by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e.g., gelatin for<br>
use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound<br>
and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
The compounds, when it is desirable to deliver them systemically, may be formulated<br>
for parenteral administration by injection., e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion.<br>
Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in<br>
multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as<br>
suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory<br>
agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions<br>
of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active<br>
compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic<br>
solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as<br>
ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain<br>
substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable<br>
stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the<br>
preparation of highly concentrated solutions.<br>
Alternatively, the active compounds may be in powder form for constitution with a<br>
suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
The compounds may also be formulated in rectal or vaginal compositions such as<br>
suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as<br>
cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be<br>
formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be formulated with<br>
suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable<br>
oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly<br>
soluble salt.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase<br>
carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include but are not limited to<br>
calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin,<br>
and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br><br>
Suitable liquid or solid pharmaceutical preparation forms are, for example, aqueous or<br>
saline solutions for inhalation, microencapsulated, encochleated, coated onto microscopic<br>
gold particles, contained in liposomes, nebulized, aerosols, pellets for implantation into the<br>
skin, or dried onto a sharp object to be scratched into the skin. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions also include granules, powders, tablets, coated tablets, (micro)capsules,<br>
suppositories, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, creams, drops or preparations with protracted<br>
release of active compounds, in whose preparation excipients and additives and/or auxiliaries<br>
such as disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, lubricants, flavorings,<br>
sweeteners or solubilizers are customarily used as described above. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions are suitable for use in a variety of drug delivery systems. For a brief review of<br>
methods for drug delivery, see Langer(1990) Science 249:1527-33, which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids and optionally other therapeutics and/or<br>
antigens may be administered per se (neat) or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt. When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the<br>
following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic,<br>
salicylic, p-toluene sulphonic, tartaric, citric, methane sulphonic, formic, malonic, succinic,<br>
naphthalene-2-sulphonic, and benzene sulphonic. Also, such salts can be prepared as alkaline<br>
metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium, potassium or calcium salts of the carboxylic<br>
acid group.<br>
Suitable buffering agents include: acetic acid and a salt (1-2% w/v); citric acid and a<br>
salt (1-3% w/v); boric acid and a salt (0.5-2.5% w/v); and phosphoric acid and a salt (0.8-2%<br>
w/v). Suitable preservatives include benzalkonium chloride (0.003-0.03% w/v);<br>
chlorobutanol (0.3-0.9% w/v); parabens (0.01-0.25% w/v) and thimerosal (0.004-0.02% w/v).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention contain an effective amount of an<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid and optionally antigens and/or other therapeutic agents<br>
optionally included in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier" means one or more compatible solid or liquid filler, diluents or<br>
encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration to a human or other vertebrate<br>
animal. The term "carrier" denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic,<br><br>
with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application. The components of<br>
the pharmaceutical compositions also are capable of being commingled with the compounds<br>
of the present invention, and with each other, in a manner such that there is no interaction<br>
For treatment of a subject, depending on activity of the compound, manner of<br>
administration, purpose of the immunization (i.e., prophylactic or therapeutic), nature and<br>
severity of the disorder, age and body weight of the patient, different doses may be necessary.<br>
The administration of a given dose can be carried out both by single administration in the<br>
form of an individual dose unit or else several smaller dose units. Multiple administration of<br>
doses at specific intervals of weeks or months apart is usual for boosting the antigen-specific<br>
responses.<br>
Other delivery systems can include time-release, delayed release or sustained release<br>
delivery systems. Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the compounds,<br>
increasing convenience to the subject and the physician. Many types of release delivery<br>
systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. They include polymer<br>
base systems such as poly(lactide-glycolide), copolyoxalates, polycaprolactones,<br>
polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polyhydroxybutyric acid, and polyanhydrides.<br>
Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are described in, for example, U.S.<br>
Patent 5,075,109. Delivery systems also include non-polymer systems that are: lipids<br>
including sterols such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids or neutral fats such as<br>
mono-, di-, and tri-glycerides; hydrogel release systems; silastic systems; peptide based<br>
systems; wax coatings; compressed tablets using conventional binders and excipients;<br>
partially fused implants; and the like. Specific examples include, but are not limited to: (a)<br>
erosional systems in which an agent of the invention is contained in a form within a matrix<br>
such as those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,452,775, 4,675,189, and 5,736,152, and (b)<br>
diffusional systems in which an active component permeates at a controlled rate from a<br>
polymer such as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,854,480, 5,133,974 and 5,407,686. In<br>
addition, pump-based hardware delivery systems can be used, some of which are adapted for<br>
implantation.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following Examples, which in no<br>
way should be construed as further limiting. The entire contents of all of the references<br>

Examples<br>
Example 1. ODN 2395 is a remarkably strong activator of NK cells and IFN-a production.<br>
We previously recognized and described oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing<br>
neutralizing motifs consisting of repeats of the sequence CG such as CGCGCG or where the<br>
CG is preceded by a C and/or followed by a G. These neutralizing motifs were believed to<br>
reduce the stimulatory effects of ODN on multiple readouts, such as secretion of IL-6, IL-12,<br>
IFN-?, TNF-a, and induction of an antigen-specific immune response. Krieg AM et al.<br>
(1998) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95:12631 -6.<br>
In many cases, the presence of a neutralizing motif in an oligonucleotide together with<br>
a stimulatory motif was believed to prevent immune activation. One such ODN containing<br>
both stimulatory and neutralizing motifs is ODN 2136, which has the sequence<br>
TCCTGACGTTCGGCGCGCGCCC (SEQ ID NO: 19). The 3' end of this ODN contains a<br>
fairly typical neutralizing motif, CGGCGCGCGCCC (SEQ ID NO: 37), derived from the 3'<br>
end of the inhibitory ODN 2010 (GCGGCGGGCGGCGCGCGCCC, SEQ ID NO: 38).<br>
Surprisingly, ODN 2136 had strong activity for inducing NK cell lytic activity (lytic units,<br>
L.U.). As shown in Table 1, ODN 2136 at a concentration of 3 µg/ml was actually stronger<br>
than our standard B-cell and NK cell stimulatory phosphorothioate ODN 2006<br>
(TCGTCGTTTTGTCGTTTTGTCGTT, SEQ ID NO: 39) for induction of L.U. More<br>
strikingly, whereas ODN 2006 only induced the production of 2,396 pg/ml of IFN-a, ODN<br>
2136 induced the production of 14,278 pg/ml (Figure 1). This indicated that, surprisingly,<br>
the presence of this neutralizing sequence was not necessarily to be avoided.<br><br><br><br>
However, in an effort to understand this observation, an even stronger NK activator<br>
and IFN-a inducer was created by combining the 3' end of ODN 2136 with the 5' end of<br>
ODN 2006. The resulting ODN 2395 (TCGTCGTTTTCGGCGCGCGCCG, SEQ ID NO: 1)<br>
serendipitously incorporated a change of the last base on the 3' end from a C to a G. This<br>
single base change has the effect of creating a perfect 12-base-long palindrome at the 3' end<br>
of ODN 2395 where in ODN 2136 the palindrome is only 10 bases long.<br>
Table 2 shows another example of data where ODN 2395 is remarkably potent at<br>
inducing NK cell L.U. compared to most other all-phosphorothioate backbone ODN. In this<br><br>
assay ODN 2395 is weaker than the positive control ODN 1585, which has a chimeric<br>
phosphorothioate/phosphodiester (SOS) backbone. ODN 1585<br>
(ggGGTCAACGTTGAgggggG, SEQ ID NO: 35), is described in published PCT Application<br>
WO 01/22990. At the low concentration of 0.6 ug/ml tested in this experiment, ODN 2136<br>
induced no L.U. above the background of 0.03 in the no-ODN control. Figure 2 and Figure<br>
3 show the level of monocyle chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and IFN-inducible protein (IP)-<br>
10, respectively, in the supernatants from the NK cell cultures in Table 2. MCP-1 is a<br>
chemokine that is a ligand for CCR2 and is associated with both Th1 and Th2-type immune<br>
responses. IP-10 is a CXC chemokine that is a ligand for CXCR3 and is associated with Th1<br>
responses. Loetscher P et al. (2001) J Biol Chem 276:2986-91. These data show that ODN<br>
2395 is a relatively strong inducer of IP-10 production, but induces only average levels of<br>
MCP-1.<br><br><br><br>
Based on these and other data, we concluded that the ODN 2395 sequence was a<br>
remarkably strong activator of NK cells and IFN-a production.<br>
Example 2. ODN related to ODN 2395 are also strong activators of NK cells and IFN-a<br>
production.<br>
Additional ODN 2427-2433 (SEQ ID NOs: 2 - 8) were designed and synthesized to<br>
test the possibility that the palindrome.at the 3' end of ODN 2395 may be important in its<br>
immune stimulatory activity. Table 3 compares the ability of these different ODN to activate<br>
NK L.U. As is evident from these data, the strongest ODN at the concentration of 1 µg/ml is<br>
ODN 2429 (TCGTCGTTTTCGGCGGCCGCCG, SEQ ID NO: 4) which induced 2.85 L.U.<br>
of NK activity. ODN 2006 was very weak in the experiment, and all of the other oligos that<br>
were tested except for the control ODN 2118 (GGGGTCAAGCTTGAGGGGGG, SEQ ID<br>
NO: 36) that has no CG were stronger than 2006. ODN 2429 is notable because it is the only<br><br>
one that maintains a 12-base palindrome, although this is a different palindrome from the one<br>
that was present in 2395. ODN 2430 (TCGTCGTTTTCGGCGCGCCGCG, SEQ ID NO: 5),<br>
which is the second strongest ODN at the 1 µg/ml concentration, is similar; but the<br>
palindrome has been slightly shortened to 10 bases long. The remainder of the ODN have<br>
either no or shorter palindromic sequences, and induce less NK activity.<br><br><br>
2432	TCGTCGTTTTCGGCCCGCGCGG (SEQ ID NO: 7)<br>
2433	TCGTCGTTTTCCGCCGCCGGGG (SEQ ID NO: 8)<br>
Figure 4 shows the ability of these oligos to induce IFN-a production compared to<br>
the positive control SOS ODN 2216 (GGGGGACGATCGTCGGGGG, SEQ ID NO: 55),<br>
2334 (GGGGTCGACGTCGACGTCGAGGGGGGG, SEQ ID NO: 56), and 2336<br>
(GGGGACGACGTCGTGGGGGGG, SEQ ID NO: 57). All of the 2395-related ODN induce<br>
a higher level of IFN-a production than ODN 2006, although the levels are below the levels<br>
induced by the chimeric SOS ODN. The rank order of induction of IFN-a expression is<br>
roughly similar to that of NK L.U., with the strongest effects seen by ODN 2395 and 2429.<br>
Example 3. The strong stimulatory effects on NK cells and IFN-a production do not<br>
correspond to B-cell effects.<br>
As shown in Figure 5A, ODN 2395 and its relatives were significantly weaker at a<br>
0.25 µg/ml concentration than ODN 2006 or its relative 2397, in terms of their ability to<br>
induce B-cell expression of CD86 at 48 hours. As we have noticed previously, at higher<br>
ODN concentrations such as 1 µg/ml, less difference was seen between the various ODN<br>
(Figure 5B). In the same experiment, we also measured B-cell activation by a proliferation<br>
assay (3H-thymidine incorporation; Figure 6). Again, at the 0.25 µg/ml concentration ODN<br>
2006 and ODN 2397 (SEQ ID NO: 44) were by far the strongest (Figure 6A). However, at<br>
higher concentrations, the 2395-related ODN were similar in their efficacy (Figure 6B).<br>
Example 4. ODN 2395 and related ODN are weak inducers of IL-10.<br>
Our previous studies have suggested that most of the IL-10 production that is induced<br>
by CpG is derived from B cells. As shown in Figure 7, IL-10 expression correlated well<br>
with B-cell proliferation. Again, ODN 2006 and its relative ODN 2397 were the strongest at<br>
the low concentration of 0.25 µg/ml. ODN 2395 and its relatives induced less IL-10<br>
production at this concentration.<br>
Example 5. Concentration dependence of immune stimulatory effect.<br>
Additional studies on this class of oligonucleotides and the derivatives involved ODN<br>
numbers 2427-2433 (SEQ ID NOs: 2 - 8). Data for these ODN are shown in Figure 8. This<br>
demonstrates again that ODN 2006 was very weak at inducing IFN-a production at a<br>
concentration of either 1 or 6 µg/ml. However, ODN 2395 induced substantial amounts of<br>
IFN-a, especially at the lower concentration of 1 µg/ml. We have occasionally seen ODN<br>
where the stimulatory activity was reduced at higher concentrations, such as 6 µg/ml, in<br><br>
comparison to the effects seen at lower concentrations such as 1 µg/ml. In the experiments<br>
shown in Figure 8, ODN 2395 was more potent at the lower concentration than at the higher<br>
concentration, but ODN 2429 was more potent at the higher concentration. In contrast to the<br>
common inverted dose-response curve of phosphorothioate ODN, chimeric ODN such as<br>
ODN 2336 in this experiment typically showed increased immune stimulatory effects at<br>
higher concentrations. The stimulatory effect of ODN 2432 in this experiment shown in<br>
Figure 8 was interesting considering that this ODN has no good palindrome. This system<br>
with the relatively weak B cell stimulatory activity is shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6.<br>
Example 6. Reciprocal relationship between B-cell stimulation and NK stimulation and<br>
IFN-a secretion.<br>
Figure 9 shows another experiment, where ODN 2395 at a low concentration of<br>
0.4 µg/ml was significantly weaker than ODN 2006 at inducing B cell expression of CD86.<br>
The other relatives of 2395 show a less marked loss of B cell stimulation. Interestingly, there<br>
is the suggestion of the same rank order for loss of B cell stimulation that had previously<br>
been seen for gain of NK stimulation: ODN 2429, followed by ODN 2430, are the weakest B<br>
cell stimulators among the 2395 relatives. This raises the possibility that the loss of B cell<br>
stimulation by the 2395-like ODN is closely related to the gain of NK stimulation and IFN-a<br>
secretion. Figure 10 and Figure 11 show the IFN-a induction is seen with ODN 2395 and<br>
ODN 2429, followed by ODN 2430. Table 4 and Figure 12, from a separate experiment,<br>
also show the strong ability of ODN 2395 and ODN 2429 to induce IFN-a secretion in two<br>
different human donors (D141 and D142).<br><br><br>

Example 7. Characteristics of the GC-rich domain.<br>
Surprisingly, none of the ODN 5293-5297 demonstrated strong immune stimulatory<br>
responses. ODN 5293 contains a 10-base palindrome, but the palindrome differs from that in<br>
2395 in that the central CG is inverted to a GC. However, it is believed that this change by<br>
itself cannot explain the loss of activity since ODN 2429 also has such an inversion. Rather,<br>
greater levels of activity may occur with a 12-base palindrome unless there is a central CG in<br>
the palindrome. However, ODN 2430 also has only a 10-base palindrome with a central GC<br>
dinucleotide. The immune stimulatory activity of ODN 2430 may be enhanced by the fact<br>
that it contains five CpG dinucleotides in the 3' terminus, whereas ODN 5293 contains only<br>
three.<br>
ODN 5294 contains only a 6-base palindrome, which could possibly be related to its<br>
low activity. ODN 5295 likewise has no good palindrome. The low activity of ODN 5296<br>
suggests that simple repeats of CCG are not sufficient to confer the immune stimulatory<br>
effects of ODN 2395. ODN 2397 has a perfect 12-base palindrome at the 3' end, but has no<br>
CpG motifs at the 5' end. Since the 12-base palindrome in ODN 5297 is the same at that in<br>
ODN 2429, it can be concluded that the 5' TCGTCG motif of ODN 2429 is important for its<br>
immune stimulatory activity. That is, it is believed that the presence of the neutralizing<br>
palindrome of ODN 2429 at one end of an oligonucleotide will be insufficient to provide<br>
immune stimulatory activity in the absence of at least one stimulatory motif at the other end.<br>
Example 8. Effects on IFN-? production.<br>
Several additional types of assays have been performed to better understand the range<br>
of immune stimulatory effects of this new class of immune stimulatory nucleic acid. Figure<br>
13 shows some of the effects of these ODN on IFN-? production from the supernatants of<br>
human PBMCs. These cells were the same as those used in the experiments shown in Table<br>
3, but the supernatants from the cultures were assayed for their IFN-? levels. Panel C in<br>
Figure 13 shows that SOS CpG ODNs such as ODN 1585 induce some IFN-? production,<br><br>
whereas ODNs without the CpG motif (e.g., control ODN 2118) do not. Panels A and B of<br>
Figure 13 show that ODN 2006 is relatively weak at inducing IFN-? production, while ODN<br>
2395 and its cousins are somewhat stronger.<br>
Another set of studies was performed to examine the effects of these different ODN<br>
on dendritic cells. The plasmacytoid DC (pDC) is the source of the IFN-a that is produced in<br>
response to ODN 2395 and its relatives. The effects of the various ODN on myeloid DC<br>
(mDC) are relatively similar in that all of the ODN induce partially purified mDC to activate<br>
CD4+ T cells to produce IFN-? (Figure 14 and Figure 15). Myeloid DC were isolated from a<br>
buffy coat and incubated with GM-CSF (4.4 ng/ml) and various ODN for 2 days. CD4+<br>
naïve T cells were then isolated from a different donor and mixed with the DC at selected<br>
effector to target (E:T) ratios and incubated for 6 more days. Cells were then stained and<br>
analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Results were measured in terms of<br>
the percentage of CD3+ cells that stained for IFN-?. Figure 14 shows the percentage of T<br>
cells that stained positive for IFN-? and Figure 15 shows the mean fluorescence intensity<br>
(MFI) of IFN-? staining in these T cells.<br>
Example 9. Not all GC-rich palindromes are effective.<br>
Several additional ODN were synthesized in order better to understand the structural<br>
requirements for this new class of ODN. Since we noted that potent immune stimulatory<br>
ODN contained GC-rich palindromes, ODN 2449 (TCGTCGTTTTCGGGGGGCCCCC,<br>
SEQ ID NO: 9) and 2450 (TCGTCGTTTTCCCCCCGGGGGG, SEQ ID NO: 10) were<br>
synthesized to have GC-rich palindromes which were simply straight Gs followed by straight<br>
Cs, or straight Cs followed by straight Gs. As shown in Figure 16, neither of these ODN<br>
induced IFN-a production.<br>
Example 10. Effect of orientation of immune stimulatory sequence and neutralizing motif.<br>
ODN 2451 (TCGGCGCGCGCCGTCGTCGTTT, SEQ ID NO: 11) was synthesized<br>
to test the possibility that the 5' and 3' orientation of the "stimulatory" TCGTCG motif and<br>
the "neutralizing" CGGCGCGCGCCG (SEQ ID NO: 23) palindrome could be inverted<br>
without losing immune stimulatory activity. Indeed, ODN 2451 was highly stimulatory<br>
(Figure 16). ODN 2452 (TCGTCGTTTTCGGCGCGCGCCGTTTTT, SEQ ID NO: 12) was<br>
synthesized to determine whether additional sequence could be added to the 3' end of the<br>
CGGCGCGCGCCG (SEQ ID NO: 23) palindrome without reducing the immune stimulatory<br><br>
activity, provided the stimulatory TCGTCG motif was on the 5' end. Indeed, this ODN was<br>
also highly immune stimulatory (Figure 16).<br>
Example 11. Variants of ODN 2395 and their induction of IFN-a.<br>
To study in more detail the structural requirements of this new class of ODN to<br>
induce IFN-a secretion, variants of ODN 2395 were synthesized and tested for their<br>
immunostimulatory activity. Table 5 summarizes the data concerning IFN-a induction.<br><br>
1Underlined are nucleotides that differ from 2395; palindromic sequences are in italics.<br>
2All except ODN 2336, that represents a chimeric backbone ODN (capitals indicate<br>
phosphodiester linkage and lower case represent phosphorothioate linkage), are completely<br>
phosphorothioate ODNs.<br>
From the first set of experiments using the phosphorothioate ODNs 2395 and<br>
2427-2433 it became clear that the palindromic sequence at the 3' end of the ODN has an<br><br>
important role for induction of IFN-a secretion by dendritic cells that are the main producers<br>
of IFN-a (see 2395 and 2429), although some ODN without such a palindrome at the 3' end<br>
(e.g., ODN 2430 and ODN 2432) also induced IFN-a in somewhat lower amounts (example<br>
in Figure 17A). ODN 2395 and ODN 2429 induced the highest amounts of IFN-a, whereas<br>
2006 (class B ODN) induced none to minimal amounts, and ODN 2336 (class A ODN)<br>
induced large amounts of this cytokine. Most experiments demonstrated that ODN 2429<br>
induced even higher amounts of this cytokine (Figure 17B). An introduction of an additional<br>
TCG motif (e.g., ODN 2427 and ODN 2428) appeared to have negative effects on IFN-a<br>
secretion. Based on data from these and other studies of ODN 2186, the gcc at the 3' end<br>
seemed to play a possible role in the observed effects.<br>
Therefore, we tested another set of ODNs all having GCC sequences at the 3' end.<br>
None of these ODN were observed to induce IFN-a. Therefore, only GCC itself in a<br>
palindrome seems not to be sufficient for the observed effects.<br>
In addition, ODN 5297 with a TGC at the 5' end did not induce any IFN-a despite<br>
bearing the palindromic 3' sequence. This led to the conclusion that not only the 3'<br>
palindromic sequence but also the 5' TCG motif is important for the activity of these ODNs.<br>
This was confirmed by using ODN 5328 (2395 with 5' TGC motif). In contrast to<br>
methylation of class A ODNs, methylation at least of the 5' motif decreased, but did not<br>
abrogate, IFN-a secretion. This finding is in accordance with results obtained with class B<br>
ODNs. Nevertheless, an ODN with part of the 3' palindrome but a different sequence at the<br>
5' end with only one CpG dinucleotide (ODN 2136) also induced IFN-a. In preliminary<br>
results using this ODN and an ODN with the full 3' palindrome (ODN 5315), ODN 5315 was<br>
better than ODN 2136 but not as good as ODN 2395.<br>
The fact that ODN 5329 seems to induce no or only very low amounts of IFN-a<br>
although having a full CG palindrome at the 3' end indicates that specific palindromic<br>
sequences are preferred for IFN-a activity.<br>
Example 12. Reciprocal relationship between B-cell activation and induction of IFN-a<br>
An additional B-cell activation experiment was performed with a panel of some of the<br>
ODNs of Example 11 (Figure 18). The results indicated that the better is an ODN for<br>
induction of IFN-a, the less active it is on B cells (compare especially ODNs 2006, 2336,<br>
2395 and 2429). Nevertheless, it also demonstrated that all of these ODNs were superior to<br>
2336 (class A ODN) in stimulating B cells.<br><br>
Example 13. Effect on secretion of IFN-y.<br>
We also determined secretion of IFN-? upon incubation of PBMCs with different<br>
concentrations of ODN at different time points (Figure 19 A - C). The ODNs tested induced<br>
IFN-y secretion with the rank order 2336 &gt; 2395, 2429 &gt; 2006. Nevertheless, the difference<br>
between the ODNs was not as clear as by using IFN-a as a read-out.<br>
Example 14. Effect on IFN-? in MLR.<br>
We also determined the effect of these ODN on the induction of IFN-? in a mixed<br>
lymphocyte reaction (MLR). In this setting lymphocytes of one donor respond to antigens<br>
expressed on cells of another donor. The results demonstrated that ODNs 2006, 2336, as well<br>
as 2395 were able to enhance IFN-? secretion during such an antigen-specific response<br>
(Figure 20). This indicated that all these ODN were able to enhance the reactivity to specific<br>
antigen(s).<br>
Example 15. ODN 2395 induces less IL-10 than ODN 2006.<br>
A further set of experiments focused on the induction of the pro-inflammatory<br>
cytokine IL-10. Again, as before for IFN-?, PBMCs were incubated for different times and<br>
with different concentrations of ODNs (Figure 21 A - C). The results demonstrate that, as<br>
shown before, ODN 2006 induces relatively high amounts of IL-10 in contrast to ODN 2336<br>
that induces only minimal to low amounts. In contrast, ODNs 2395 as well as ODN 2429<br>
induce more IL-10 than ODN 2336 but less than ODN 2006. This again confirms that ODN<br>
of this new class of immune stimulatory ODN have stimulatory activities that place them<br>
between those described for ODNs of class A and class B.<br>
Example 16. ODN 2395 induces less TNF-a than ODN 2006 but more than ODN 8954.<br>
Human PBMCs were cultured for 6 hours with 1.6 µg/ml of ODN 2006, 8954, 2395,<br>
2429, or LPS, and supernatants were then harvested and TNF-a measured by specific ELISA.<br>
Results are shown in Table 6.<br><br><br>
Additional experiments indicated that cytokines IL-5 as well as IL-15 could not be detected<br>
in our experimental settings upon incubation of PBMCs with these ODNs.<br>
Example 17. Induction of IP-10<br>
Human PBMCs were cultured either alone, in the presence of IL-2, in the presence of<br>
control ODN 1585 or control ODN 2118 at 10 µg/ml, or in the presence of various ODN at<br>
0.6 or 3.0 ug/ml. Supematants were harvested after 24 hours and IP-10 was measured by<br>
specific enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Results are shown in Figure 22.<br>
ODNs 2395, 2429, 2430, 2432, and 2451 at 3.0 µg/ml, and ODN 2452 at 0.6 µg/ml, all<br>
induced large amounts of IP-10.<br>
Example 18. Induction of IFN-a<br>
Human PBMCs were cultured either alone, in the presence of IL-2, in the presence of<br>
control ODN 1585 or control ODN 2118 at 10 µg/ml, or in the presence of various ODN at<br>
0.6 or 3.0 µg/ml. Supematants were harvested after 24 hours and IFN-a was measured by<br>
specific ELISA. Results are shown in Figure 23A (ODN at 0.6 µg/ml) and Figure 23B<br>
(ODN at 3.0 µg/ml). ODNs 2395,2427,2429, 2430, 2431,2432, and 2451 at 3.0 µg/ml, and<br>
ODN 2452 at 0.6 ng/ml, all induced large amounts of IFN-a.<br>
Example 19. Induction of IFN-?.<br>
Human PBMCs were cultured either alone, in the presence of IL-2, in the presence of<br>
control ODN 1585 or control ODN 2118 at 10 |ag/ml, or in the presence of various ODN at<br>
0.6 or 3.0 |xg/ml. Supematants were harvested after 24 hours and IFN-y was measured by<br>
specific ELISA. Results are shown in Figure 24. ODNs 2395, 2427, 2429,2430, 2431,<br>
2432,2451 and 2452 at 3.0 ug/ml, and ODN 2352 at 0.6 ug/ml, all induced large amounts of<br>
IFN-Y.<br>
