The following specification describes the invention<br>
"PHARMACEUTICAL	COMPOSITION	CONTAINING<br>
MEMANTINE AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF"<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to prepare stable, dose proportional, easily disintegrated &amp; dissolved immediate release oral pharmaceutical composition comprising memantine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, enantiomers or mixtures thereof, an uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA-Receptor antagonist for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In particular, invention related to pharmaceutical technology, which discloses the novel methods of manufacturing of pharmaceutical compositions of memantine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Memantine hydrochloride is a adamantine derivative, uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist that belong to the chemical class of l-amino-3,5-dimethyladamentane hydrochloride. The reported IUPAC name for memantine hydrochloride is 3,5-dimethyladamantane-1-amine hydrochloride. The molecular formula of memantine hydrochloride is C12H21N.HCI, and the molecular weight is 215.76.<br>
Memantine hydrochloride is currently marketed by Forest Labs in the form of film coated tablets under the trade name NAMENDA® in USA. In Europe, Memantine hydrochloride is marketed under the brand names of AUXURA® and EBIXA®. NAMENDA has been approved by the USFDA for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzeimer's disease.<br>
2<br><br>
US20060002999 A1 (Yang Y. et al, 2005), discloses pharmaceutical compositions of 1-aminocyclohexanes, such as memantine or neramexane, prepared by a direct compression method for preparing tablets, which are released at a dissolution rate of at least about 80 percent in 60 minutes, and have a hardness between 3 and 40 kp, i.e., between about 4.2 and 56 SCU (Stong Cobb Units). In this invention formulations suffered from problems like sticking and capping. Our invention completely does not involve all these problems and shown superiority over direct compression strategy.<br>
WO 2008005036 (Hrakovsky et al, 2006) discloses the manufacturing of solid dosage form of memantine by wet granulation method. Even though wet granulation method widely used in the manufacturing of various pharmaceutical dosage forms, it suffers from various disadvantages such as loss of drug during various processing steps like granulation, drying, milling and exposure of drug to harsh environment like granulating solvent, heat, which may lead to rise in impurity levels in the formulation.<br>
US20060251717 (Firestone et al, 2004) discloses the manufacturing of solid dosage form containing memantine, by milling memantine with microcrystalline cellulose. Milling of any active pharmaceutical ingredient during manufacturing of pharmaceutical dosage form is not preferable because, it may results in loss of drug during milling or polymorphic conversion may takes place.<br>
Even though many technologies with different compositions are disclosed to manufacture memantine oral compositions, however suffers from problems like sticking &amp; capping tendency, drug loss and high production costs . Therefore there is a need of, simple and effective composition which eliminates all these disadvantages.<br>
3<br><br>
