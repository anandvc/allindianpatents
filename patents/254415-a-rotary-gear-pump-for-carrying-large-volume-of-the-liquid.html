3.   PREAMBLE  TO  THE  DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed   :   -<br><br>
A Rotary Gear Pump for Carrying High Volume of the Liquid<br>
Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to gear pumps, specifically to an external type of rotary gear pump. More particularly it relates to a rotary gear pump handling high volume of liquid having impeller assembly associated with timing gears which acts as drive gears and reduction gears to facilitate adjustment of the speed of the impeller.<br>
Prior art:<br>
Gear pump is one among different types of rotary positive displacement pump such as vane, lobe, screw, tracoidal, shuttle block used for handling viscous and semi-viscous liquid each one having its own advantages, disadvantages and limitations. There are different kinds of gear pumps, but as the present invention is specifically relates to external gear pump we therefore, will discuss only about said pump. The constructional and functional mechanism of such gear pump is shown in figure 1(a) to 1(c). As shown in these figures, an external gear pump employs pair of external gear (G) acting as impeller which rotates in closed housing (H) to achieve desired flow and pressure to meet required application. As rotor rotates in the housing (H) vacuum is created at the suction side there by causing the liquid to enter the pump under atmospheric pressure acting on the liquid surface. The incoming liquid gets entrapped in the chamber (C) formed between the tooth gap (T) and housing (H) and it is bodily carried to the discharge side (D) where it is delivered overcoming the resistance in the discharge line.<br>
Gear pump has constrained in higher sizes of high flow applications as it requires higher size of impeller gear associated with deficiency of high power consumption and high noise level. Due to this gear pump are not generally recommended for sizes higher than 6' with capacity above 125 m3/hr. If at all they are used they are run at low RPM by using low RPM electrical motor or speed reducer this again require<br><br><br>
higher size of pump with costly drive, high maintenance &amp; higher space requirement. Since these pumps are designed to carry high volume of liquid the impeller size increases considerably in diameter and face width due to which if they are allowed to mesh directly to transmit power it develops considerable noise of prohibitive level.<br>
Therefore, there is a need of a gear pump which can overcome all these deficiencies and constrains.<br>
Object of Invention:<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a gear pump which will obviate all the deficiencies associated with the prior art gear pumps.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a gear pump which is compact, simple in construction and cost effective.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a gear pump with which is easily maintainable.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a gear pump with which is easily cleanable.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a gear pump which gives high efficiency.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a gear pump which is low in noise.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a gear pump which is reliable and long lasting.<br><br><br>
Accordingly to achieve the aforementioned objects, a rotary gear pump for carrying high volume of the liquid is provide with a pair of impeller gears associated with timing gears and reduction gears the said gear pump comprises of:<br>
An impeller assembly having a pair of extended rotor and stator shafts fitted with a pair of herringbone gears with 8 to 10 numbers of teeth to provide possible minimum diameter. Said herringbone gears are mounted on said stator and rotor shafts in a pair in such a way that three gears are fixed on shaft while forth gear is floating to facilitate adjustment of any running error;<br>
Hardened and ground timing gears provided on extended shaft to transmit the power at reduced noise level within acceptable limit while in operation, said timing gears are fitted on non-drive end side of the impeller assembly;<br>
a driven reduction gear fitted on the drive side of the impeller on extended stator shaft and a drive pinion is fitted on front cover with ball bearing mashing the drive gear to reduce the speed of impeller gears within pump;<br>
a pump casing along with covers accommodating the said impeller assembly, timing gears, drive gear and driven pinion.<br>
a pressure relief valve assembly to safeguard the pump against excess pressure of liquid being pumped;<br><br><br>
Brief description of Drawings :<br><br>
Figure    1(a)    to 1(c)		Shows the constructional and operational view of the external gear pumps.<br>
Figure 2		Shows the perspective view of the rotary gear pump in accordance to present invention.<br>
Figure 3		Shows the sectional view of the rotary gear pump in accordance to present invention.<br>
Detail description of the invention:<br>
The above, and the other objects, features &amp; advantages of invention will become apparent from following description read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
The no-load power consumption in the gear pump affects the overall efficiency of the gear pump. The improper design of the gear pump results into high power consumption at no-load there by reducing the overall efficiency. Present invention curtail this no load power consumption of very high nature to great extent by improved impeller gear design with lesser number of higher module teeth to enable impeller to carry high volume of liquid per unit weight per revolution of the pump. Along with the impeller assembly some other unique parts of the gear pump are also responsible for the improvement in gear pump which is illustrated with reference to drawings hereinafter.<br>
Now referring to figure 2, it shows the perspective view of the rotary gear pump in accordance to present invention comprising of an impeller gear assembly, timing gears and reduction gears the detailed construction is as follow.<br>
A pair of left and right gear (08) fitted on rotor shaft (07) with key (24) and positioned on either side by pair of bearing sleeve (36) and packing sleeve (37) with<br><br><br>
help of thrust washer (12) and washer (34) and cap screw (35) on one side and snap ring (40) on other side forms the rotor impeller assembly. Similarly, a pair of left and right gear (10) fitted on stator shaft (09) with key (32) and positioned on either size by pair of bearing sleeve (36) and packing sleeve (37) with help of thrust washer (12), washer (34) and cap screw (35) forms the stator impeller assembly.<br>
These two assemblies are then placed in casing (01) and packed on either size by wearing plate (06). Bearing cover (02) than closes the casing after fitting 4 nos. of needle bearing (13) in this bearing cover on either side. The bearing covers are dowelled to the casing with 4 nos. of dowel pin (25). A pair of timing gear (11) is fitted on the non-drive end side of this impeller assembly and this side is closed with back cover (04) with help of bolt (20) packing (33) and dowel (25).<br>
On the drive side, on the stator shaft the driven gear (16) is fitted. The pinion shaft (15) which also forms the drive shaft of the pump is fitted on front cover with help of 2 ball bearings (18). This front cover is then fitted on the pump with help of packing (33), bolt (38), dowel (25). An angular contact bearing (43) is fitted on this pinion which rests on the rotor shaft separating them while in operations. A relief valve assembly comprising of housing (27), piston (28), spring (29), lock nut (30) and adjusting screw (31) is then fitted on the top of the casing with help of packing (41) and bolt (22), Legs (26) are also fitted on the bottom of the pump with bolt (39).<br>
This makes a compact pump assembled to deliver high flow of viscous liquid at moderate pressure running quite efficiently with low noise level. The pump is protected against over pressure by putting the relief valve in operation. This is a unique perception transferred into a product by our team of engineers.<br>
Advantages of the gear pump of the present invention: <br>
1.   High efficiency.<br>
2.	High speed.<br>
3.	High volume of liquid carrying capacity.<br><br><br>
4.	Relatively quiet operation.<br>
5.	Simple construction and compact in nature.<br>
