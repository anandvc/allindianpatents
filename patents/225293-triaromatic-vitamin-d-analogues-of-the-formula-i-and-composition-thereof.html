				<td>Vitamin D Analogues<br>
The invention relates, as novel and useful industrial products, to triaromatic compounds which are vitamin D analogues. The invention also relates to a process for preparing them and to their use in pharmaceutical compositions intended for use in human or veterinary medicine, or alternatively in cosmetic compositions.<br>
The compounds according to the invention have pronounced activity in the fields of cell proliferation and differentiation and find applications more particularly in the topical and systemic treatment of dermatological (or other) complaints associated with a keratinization disorder, complaints with an inflammatory and/or immunoallergic component and hyperproliferation of tissues of ectodermal origin (skin, epithelium, etc.), whether benign or malignant. These compounds can also be used to combat ageing of the skin, whether light-induced or chronological, and to treat cicatrization disorders.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be used in cosmetic compositions for body and hair hygiene.<br>
Vitamin D is an essential vitamin for preventing and treating mineralization defects of cartilage (rickets) and of bone (osteomalacia), and even of certain forms of osteoporosis in elderly<br><br>
people. However, it is now accepted that its functions extend well beyond regulating bone metabolism and calcium homeostasis. Among these functions, mention may be made of its actions on cell proliferation and differentiation and the control of the immune defences. Their discovery has opened the way to novel therapeutic approaches in dermatology, carcinology and in the field of autoimmune diseases and that of organ or tissue transplants.<br>
An efficient therapeutic supply has long been confounded by the toxicity of this vitamin (occasionally fatal hypercalcaemia). Structural analogues of vitamin D are currently synthesized, some of which conserve only the differentiating properties and have no action on calcium metabolism.<br>
One of the aims of the present invention is to propose novel compounds which are structural analogues of vitamin D and which show selective activity on cell proliferation and differentiation without displaying any hypercalcaemiant nature.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to propose novel compounds which are analogues of vitamin D and which are more readily synthesized and thus more economical than those known previously.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to compounds which can be represented by the general formula (I) below<br>

According to the present invention, the compounds of formula (I) which are more particularly preferred are those for which at least one, and preferably all, of the conditions below are satisfied: - RI represents a CH3 or CH2OH radical,<br><br>
-	R2 represents a CH20H radical,<br>
-	X-Y represents a bond of formula (a) or (c) ,<br>
-	RS represents the radical C (Ria) (Ru) OH.<br>
A subject of the present invention is also processes for preparing the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Figures 1 to 5 represent reaction schemes which can be used to prepare the compounds according to the invention.<br>
Thus, the compounds of formula I(a) can be obtained (Figure 1) by reacting a halo compound, preferably a bromo compound (1) with a phenolic (Y=OH), thiophenolic (Y=SH) or aniline (Y=NH-COO-tert-butyl) derivative (3) in the presence of a base such as K2CC&gt;3 in a solvent such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone.<br>
The compounds of formula I(a) can also be obtained (Figure 1) by reacting a halo compound, preferably a bromo compound (1) with the sodium or potassium salt of a phenolic (Y=OH), thiophenolic (Y=SH) or aniline (Y=NH-COO-tert-butyl) derivative (3) in a solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF).<br>
The compounds of formula I(b) can be obtained (Figure 1) by reacting a benzoic derivative (2) with a phenolic (Y=OH), thiophenolic (Y=SH) or aniline (Y=NH2) derivative (3) in the presence of carbonyldiimidazole or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in a solvent such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran (THF).<br>
The compounds of formula I(b) can also be obtained (Figure 1) by reacting a benzoyl chloride<br><br>
(obtained by reacting a benzoic derivative (2) with thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride) with a phenolic (Y=OH), thiophenolic (Y=SH) or aniline (Y=NH2) derivative (3) in the presence of a base such as triethylamine in a solvent such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran (THF).<br>
The compounds (1), (2) and (3) can be<br>
obtained according to the reaction schemes presented in Figures 2, 3 and 4. The methods for preparing the compounds (1) and (2) have the advantage of limiting the number of preparation steps.<br>
In Figure 2, (a) represents a reaction with BH3 in dioxane, (b) represents a reaction with CH3OCH2C1 in the presence of sodium hydride in a dimethyl-formamide solvent, (c) represents a reaction with n-butyllithium in the presence of CC&gt;2 in tetrahydrofuran, (d) represents a reaction with n-butyllithium in tetrahydrofuran followed by a reaction with dimethylformamide, (e) represents a reduction reaction with sodium borohydride in a methanol-tetrahydrofuran solvent and (f) represents a reaction with carbon tetrabromide in the presence of triphenylphosphine in a dichloromethane solvent.<br>
In Figure 3, (a) represents a reaction with BH3 in dioxane, (b) represents a reaction with methanol in the presence of sulphuric acid, (c) represents a reaction with t-C/jHg (CHs) 2SiCl in the presence of imidazole in a dimethylformamide solvent, (d)<br><br>
represents a reaction with LiAlH4 in ether, (e) represents a reaction with benzoyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine in tetrahydrofuran, (f) represents a reaction with (C4H9)4NF in tetrahydrofuran and (g) represents a reaction with carbon tetrabromide in the presence of triphenylphosphine in a dichloromethane solvent.<br>
The derivatives (3) can be obtained according to the reaction scheme indicated in Figure 4. A Suzuki-type reaction between a boronic derivative (4) and an iodoaryl derivative (5) in the presence of a catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium gives the ester derivative (6) which is converted into the derivative (3) by reaction with an alkylmagnesium or cycloalkylmagnesium halide or an alkyllithium.<br>
The compounds of formula I© can be obtained (Figure 5) by a Horner-Emmons reaction between the phosphonate derivative (8) (obtained from the corresponding benzyl bromide by an Arbuzov reaction) and the benzaldehyde (7).<br>
The compounds of formula I(d) can be obtained from the compounds I© by hydrogenation of the double bond in the presence of palladium-on-charcoal.<br>
The compounds of formula I(e) can also be obtained (Figure 6) by a Sonogashira reaction between an acetylenic derivative (9) (obtained by reacting the benzaldehyde (7) by a Corey-Fuchs reaction) and a<br><br>
triflate derivative (X=OS02CF3) or iodo derivative (X=I) (10) in the presence of a transition metal catalyst such as Pd(Cl)2 (PPh3) 2 and Cul in a solvent such as triethylamine.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) have biological properties analogous to those of vitamin D, in particular the properties of transactivation of the vitamin D response elements (VDRE), such as an agonist or antagonist activity with respect to receptors of vitamin D or derivatives thereof. The expression “D vitamins or derivatives thereof” means, for example, the derivatives of vitamin D2 or D3 and in particular 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol).<br>
This agonist activity with respect to receptors of vitamin D or derivatives thereof can be demonstrated “in vitro” by methods known in the field of study of gene transcription (Hansen et al., The Society for Investigative Dermatologie, vol. 1, No. 1, April 1996).<br>
By way of example, the VDR agonist activity can be tested on the HeLa cell line by co-transfection with an expression vector for the human VDR receptor and the reporter plasmid p240Hase-CAT which contains the region -1399 to + 76 of rat 24-hydroxylase promoter, cloned upstream of the frame encoding the chloramphenicol-acetyl-transferase (CAT) gene. 18 hours after co-transfection, the test product is added to the medium. 18 hours after treatment, assay of the CAT<br><br>
activity in the cell lysates is carried out by an ELISA test. The results are expressed as percentages of the effect normally observed with 10”7M calcitriol.<br>
The agonist activity can also be<br>
characterized in this co-transfection system, by determining the dose required to reach 50% of the maximum activity of the product (AC50).<br>
The biological properties analogous to vitamin D can also be measured by the capacity of the product to inhibit the proliferation of normal human keratinocytes (NHK in culture). The product is added to NHKs cultured under conditions which promote the proliferative state. The product is left in contact with the cells for 5 days. The number of proliferative cells is measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into the DNA.<br>
The vitamin D receptor agonist activity of the compounds of the invention can also be evaluated “in vivo” by induction of 24-hydroxylase in SKH mice. (Voorhees et al., 1997.108: 513-518).<br>

EXAMPLE 31; Test example to evaluate the biological activity of the compounds of the invention<br>
The VDR agonist activity was tested on the HeLa cell line, by co-transfection of an expression vector of the human VDR receptor and of the reporter plasmid p240Hase-CAT which contains the region -1399 to +76 of the rat 24-hydroxylase promoter, cloned upstream of the coding frame of the chloramphenicol-acetyl-transferase (CAT) gene. 18 hours after co-transfection, the test product is added to the medium. After treatment for 18 hours, the CAT activity of the cell lysates is assayed by an ELISA test. The results are<br><br>
expressed as a percentage of the effect normally observed with 10”7 M of calcitriol.<br>
The agonist activity was characterized in this co-transfection system by determining the dose required to achieve 50% of the maximum activity of the product (AC50).<br><br>
