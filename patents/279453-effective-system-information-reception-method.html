EFFECTIVE SYSTEM INFORMATION RECEPTION METHOD<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1] The present invention relates to a wireless (radio) communication system for<br>
providing wireless communication services and a wireless (radio) terminal, and more<br>
particularly, to a method for informing, by the wireless communication system, to the<br>
terminal about information required for reception when the wireless terminal is<br>
connected to the wireless communication system, in which a base station updates<br>
system information according to a preset period, and the terminal efficiently receives<br>
or checks any update of the system information based on the period.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2] Figure 1 shows an exemplary network structure of an Evolved Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunications System (E-UMTS) as a mobile communication system to which a<br>
related art and the present invention are applied. The E-UMTS system is a system that<br>
has evolved from the UMTS system, and its standardization work is currently being<br>
performed by the 3GPP standards organization. The E-UMTS system can also be<br>
referred to as a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) system.<br>
[3] The E-UMTS network can roughly be divided into an Evolved Universal Terrestrial<br>
Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) and a Core Network (CN). The E-UTRAN<br>
generally comprises a terminal (i.e., User Equipment (UE)), a base station (i.e., eNode<br>
B), and an Access Gateway (AG) that is located at an end of the E-UMTS network and<br>
connects with one or more external networks. The AG may be divided into a part for<br>
processing user traffic and a part for handling control traffic. Here, an AG for<br>
processing new user traffic and an AG for processing control traffic can be com-<br>
municated with each other by using a new interface. One eNode B may have one or<br>
more cells. An interface for transmitting the user traffic or the control traffic may be<br>
used among the eNode Bs. The CN may comprise an AG, nodes for user registration of<br>
other UEs, and the like. An interface may be used to distinguish the E-UTRAN and the<br>
CN from each other.<br>
[4] Radio interface protocol layers between the terminal and the network can be divided<br>
into a first layer (L1), a second layer (L2) and a third layer (L3) based on three lower<br>
layers of an Open System Interconnection (OSI) standard model widely known in com-<br>
munications systems. A physical layer belonging to the first layer provides an in-<br>
formation transfer service using a physical channel. A Radio Resource Control (RRC)<br>
layer located at the lowest portion of the third layer controls radio resources between<br>
the terminal and the network. For this purpose, the RRC layer allows RRC messages to<br>
be exchanged between the terminal and the network.<br>
[5] Figs. 2 and 3 show radio interface protocol architecture between a terminal and E-<br>
UTRAN based on 3GPP radio access network standards. Particularly, Fig. 2 shows<br>
radio protocol architecture in a control plane, and Fig. 3 shows radio protocol ar-<br>
chitecture in a user plane.<br>
[6] The radio interface protocol in Figs. 2 and 3 has horizontal layers comprising a<br>
physical layer, a data link layer and a network layer, and has vertical planes comprising<br>
a user plane for transmitting user traffic and a control plane for transmitting control<br>
signals. The protocol layers in Figs. 2 and 3 can be divided into a first layer (L1), a<br>
second layer (L2) and a third layer (L3) based on three lower layers of an Open System<br>
Interconnection (OSI) standard model widely known in communications systems.<br>
Hereinafter, each iayer in the radio protocol control plane in Fig. 2 and a radio protocol<br>
user plane in Fig. 3 will be described.<br>
[7] A first layer, as a physical iayer, provides an information transfer service to an upper<br>
layer using a physical channel. The physical layer is connected to its upper layer,<br>
called a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, via a transport channel. The MAC layer<br>
and the physical layer exchange data via the transport channel. Data is transferred via a<br>
physical channel between different physical layers, namely, between the physical layer<br>
of a transmitting side and the physical layer of a receiving side. The physical channel is<br>
modulated based on an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)<br>
technique, and utilizes time and frequency as radio resources.<br>
[8] The MAC layer located at the second layer provides a service to an upper layer,<br>
called a Radio Link Control (RLC) layer, via a logical channel. The RLC layer of the<br>
second layer supports reliable data transmissions. The function of the RLC layer may<br>
be implemented as a functional block in the MAC layer. In this case, the RLC layer<br>
may not exist. A Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer of the second layer,<br>
in the radio protocol user plane, is used to efficiently transmit IP packets, such as IPv4<br>
or IPv6, on a radio interface with a relatively narrow bandwidth. For this purpose, the<br>
PDCP layer reduces the size of an IP packet header which is relatively great in size and<br>
includes unnecessary control information, namely, a function called header com-<br>
pression is performed.<br>
[9] A Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion of the third<br>
layer is only defined in the control plane. The RRC layer controls logical channels,<br>
transport channels and physical channels in relation to establishment, re-configuration<br>
and release of Radio Bearers (RBs). Here, the RB signifies a service provided by the<br>
second layer for data transmissions between the terminal and the E-UTRAN. If an<br>
RRC connection is established between the RRC layer of the terminal and the RRC<br>
layer of the radio network, the terminal is in the RRC connected mode. Otherwise, the<br>
terminal is in an RRC idle mode.<br>
[10] A Non-Access Stratum (NAS) layer located at an upper portion of the RRC layer<br>
performs functions, such as session management, mobility management and the like.<br>
[11] One cell constructing an eNB is set to one of bandwidths of 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, 5<br>
MHz, 10 MHz, 20 MHz and the like, so as to provide downlink or uplink transmission<br>
services to multiple terminals. Here, different cells may be set to provide different<br>
bandwidths.<br>
[12] Downlink transport channels for transmitting data from a network to a terminal may<br>
comprise a Broadcast Channel (BCH) for transmitting system information, a Paging<br>
Channel (PCH) for transmitting paging messages and a downlink Shared Channel<br>
(SCH) for fransrnitting other user traffic or control messages. Traffic or control<br>
messages of a downlink point-to-multipoint service (multicast or broadcast service)<br>
may be transmitted either via a downlink SCH, or via a separate downlink Multicast<br>
Channel (MCH). In addition, uplink transport channels for transmitting data from a<br>
terminal to a network may comprise a Random Access Channel (RACH) for<br>
transmitting an initial control message and an uplink Shared Channel (SCH) for<br>
transmitting user traffic or control messages.<br>
[13] Logical channels which are located at an upper portion of transport channels and<br>
mapped to the transport channels include a Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH), a<br>
Paging Control Channel (PCCH), a Common Control Channel (CCCH), a MBMS<br>
point-to-multipoint Control Channel / Multicast Control Channel (MCCH), a MBMS<br>
point-to-multipoint Traffic Channel / Multicast Traffic Channel (MTCH), and the like.<br>
[14] Fig. 4 shows a transmission on a control channel according to the related art.<br>
[15] A physical channel is composed of multiple sub-frames arranged on a time axis and<br>
multiple sub-carriers arranged oh a frequency axis. Here, a single sub-frame includes a<br>
plurality of symbols on the time axis. One sub-frame is composed of a plurality of<br>
resource blocks, each of which includes a plurality of symbols and a plurality of sub-<br>
carriers. Also, each sub-frame can use particular sub-carriers of particular symbols<br>
(e.g., a first symbol) at the corresponding sub-frame for a Physical Downlink Control<br>
Channel (PDCCH), namely, a L1/L2 control channel. One sub-frame is a time duration<br>
of 0.5 ms. A Transmission Time Interval (TTI) as a unit time for which da:a is<br>
transmitted is 1 ms corresponding to two sub-frames.<br>
[16] In E-UMTS system, radio resource(s) of in a cell is allocated for an uplink radio<br>
resource(s) and a downlink radio resource(s). The base station (eNode B) is in charge<br>
of controlling or allocating of the uplink and downlink radio resource(s). Namely, the<br>
base station decides which terminal can use which or how much radio resource(s) for<br>
which particular time period(s). After such determination is made, the base station<br>
transmits those information to a corresponding terminal so that the terminal can<br>
perform the uplink or downlink transmission according to the information.<br>
[17] In conventional art, the terminal continuously uses the radio resource(s) in a<br>
connected mode. However, in recent years, there are many service based on an IP<br>
(Internet Protocol) packet, and continuously using of the radio resource(s) in the<br>
connected mode may cause a drawback because these IP packet based service does not<br>
always communicates packet(s) all the time, rather there are many periods that packets<br>
are not communicated even in the connected mode. As such, continuously allocating<br>
and using of the radio resource(s) for whole time period in a connected mode may be<br>
ineffective and undesirable. In order to solve this drawback, the radio resource(s) may<br>
be allocated only when there is service data to be communicated.<br>
[18] Hereinafter, description of an RRC state of a terminal and a RRC connection method<br>
will be given in detail. The RRC state refers to whether the RRC of the terminal is<br>
logically connected to the RRC of the E-UTRAN, thereby forming a logical<br>
connection with the RRC of the E-UTRAN. If the RRC of the terminal forms a logical<br>
connection with the RRC of the E-UTRAN, this is referred to as an "RRC connected<br>
state." Conversely, if there is no logical connection between the RRC of the terminal<br>
and the RRC of the E-UTRAN, this is referred to as an "RRC idle state." When the<br>
terminal is in the RRC connected state and, accordingly, the E-UTRAN can recognize<br>
the existence of the corresponding terminal according to units of cells, the E-UTRAN<br>
can effectively control the terminal. On the other hand, the E-UTRAN cannot<br>
recognize a terminal that is in idle state. The terminal in idle state can be managed by<br>
the CN according to units of location areas or units of tracking (routing) areas, which<br>
are areas larger than the cell. Specifically, the existence of a terminal in idle state is<br>
only recognized according to units of large areas, such as location areas or tracking<br>
(routing) areas, and the terminal must transition into the connected state in order to<br>
receive typical mobile communication services such as voice or data.<br>
[19] When a user initially turns on the power of the terminal, the terminal first detects an<br>
appropriate cell and maintains its idle state in the corresponding cell. The terminal in<br>
idle state forms an RRC connection with the RRC of the E-UTRAN through the RRC<br>
connection procedure and transitions into the RRC connected state when the RRC<br>
connection needs to be formed. There are several instances in which a terminal in idle<br>
state is required to form the RRC connection. For example, an uplink data transmission<br>
may be required due to a call attempt by a user or the transmission of a response<br>
message in response to a paging message received from the E-UTRAN may be<br>
required.<br>
[20] Hereinafter, description of system information will be given. The system information<br>
may include all information required for a terminal to know for a connection with a<br>
base station. Accordingly, before the terminal attempts to connect to the base station, it<br>
should receive all system information and always have the most updated system in-<br>
formation. In addition, considering that all terminals within one cell should know the<br>
system information, the base station periodically transmits the system information.<br>
[21] The system information may be divided into a Master Information Block (MIB), a<br>
Scheduling Block (SB), a System Information Block (SIB) and the like. The MIB<br>
serves to inform the terminal about a physical construction of a corresponding cell<br>
(e.g., a bandwidth, and the like). The SB serves to inform the terminal about<br>
transmission information of SIBs (e.g., a transmission period and the like). The SIB<br>
refers to a collection (or aggregate) of system information that are related to each<br>
other. For instance, some SIB may include information of neighboring cells only, and<br>
other SIB may include information about an uplink radio channel only used by the<br>
terminal.<br>
[22] In the related art, in order for a terminal to receive appropriate services without<br>
causing any trouble in a system, the terminal should always have the most updated<br>
system information. However, such system information needs to be received by a<br>
terminal which has newly entered into a cell, or a terminal which has been newly<br>
turned on in a specific cell. Accordingly, the base station would repeatedly transmit the<br>
system information. In this case, requiring the terminal to always receive the system<br>
information may cause a problem of unnecessarily wasting power to a terminal which<br>
has already received the most updated system information. Accordingly, it is necessary<br>
for the terminal to read system information only if the system information is actually<br>
modified.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[23] The present invention is to provide a method for efficiently receiving and updating<br>
system information, by a terminal, if the system information is modified, wherein a<br>
base station which transmits control information required for a connection with the<br>
base station (i.e., system information) to the terminal uses a minimum radio resources<br>
of a cell under its management, thereby maximizing efficiency of radio resources as<br>
well as minimizing power consumption of the terminal which should receive the<br>
control information.<br>
[24] To implement at least the above feature in whole or in parts the present invention<br>
may provide a method of receiving system information for an uplink access in a<br>
wireless communication system, the method comprising: receiving the system in-<br>
formation and period information related to a modification of the system information;<br>
determining whether or not the system information needs to be modified; and receiving<br>
updated system information according to the period information if the system in-<br>
formation is determined to be modified.<br>
[25] The present invention may also provide a method of transmitting system information<br>
for an uplink access in a wireless communication system, the method comprising:<br>
transmitting the system information and period information related to a modification of<br>
the system information; notifying whether or not the system information needs to be<br>
modified; and transmitting updated system information according to the period in-<br>
formation if the system information is determined to be modified.<br>
[26] Additional features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which<br>
follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon<br>
examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The ob-<br>
jectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the<br>
structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[35] One aspect of the present invention is the recognition by the present inventors<br>
regarding the problems and drawbacks of the related art described above and explained<br>
in more detail hereafter. Based upon such recognition, the features of the present<br>
invention have been developed.<br>
[36] The present invention may be embodied in a 3GPP communication technology, in<br>
particular, in the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) system, a<br>
communication apparatus and method thereof. However, the present invention may<br>
also be applied to all wired/wireless communications to which the technical scope of<br>
the present invention can be applied.<br>
[37] Hereinafter, description of structures and operations of the preferred embodiments<br>
according to the present invention will be given with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings. Figure 5 shows an exemplary system information reception process<br>
according a first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 5, a BCCH<br>
period refers to a time period (time duration) in which system information (SI) having<br>
the same content is transmitted. That is, the system information is transmitted with the<br>
same content in the same BCCH period. More specifically, if system information needs<br>
to be modified while being transmitted within a certain BCCH period, such system in-<br>
formation may be modified in the next BCCH period or new (modified) system in-<br>
formation may be transmitted in the next BCCH period. In Fig. 5, the terminal is<br>
notified in the BCCH period 3 that the BCCH has been modified. Accordingly, the<br>
terminal considers (determines) that new system information, other than that<br>
transmitted in the BCCH period 2, would be transmitted in the BCCH period 3. In Fig.<br>
5, the terminal is notified in the BCCH period 4 that the BCCH is not modified. Ac-<br>
cordingly, the terminal determines that the system information having the same content<br>
as that transmitted in the previous BCCH period (e.g., in the BCCH period 3) would be<br>
transmitted in the BCCH period 4, thereby not receiving the system information. That<br>
is, the BCCH period refers to a minimum time interval in which the system in-<br>
formation can be modified. In other words, different system information cannot be<br>
transmitted within one BCCH period.<br>
[38] Figure 6 shows an exemplary system information reception process according a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 6, a period (duration)<br>
for indicating modification of system information by a base station, and a period<br>
(duration) for indicating the start of transmission of newly updated (modified) system<br>
information may be set differently. That is, if a modification of system information is<br>
indicated in a certain system information modification period, the modified system in-<br>
formation can be transmitted in the next system information modification period. More<br>
specifically, the base station may inform the terminal that the system information has<br>
been modified in a Nth system information modification period, and may transmit the<br>
actually modified system information in the next system information modification<br>
period.<br>
[39] For instance, if the terminal has obtained information indicating a modification of<br>
system information in a certain system information modification period, the terminal<br>
may be configured to receive modified system information in the next system in-<br>
formation modification period. That is, if the base station informs the terminal about<br>
the modification of the system information in the Nth system information modification<br>
period and, accordingly, the terminal receives such system information, the terminal<br>
would actually receive the system information in the next system information modi-<br>
fication period.<br>
[40] The present invention is to provide a method for efficiently receiving and updating,<br>
by a terminal, system information if the system information is modified, wherein a<br>
base station which transmits to the terminal control information required for a<br>
connection with the base station (i.e., system information) uses a minimum radio<br>
resources of a cell under its management, thereby maximizing efficiency of radio<br>
resources as well as minimizing power consumption of the terminal which should<br>
receive the control information. For this, the present invention proposes to operate the<br>
terminal and the base station by using information regarding a period related to<br>
reception or modification of system information. Here, the period related to the<br>
reception or modification of the system information refers to a minimum period in<br>
which system information can be modified, or a minimum period in which the base<br>
station can modify the system information. In addition, the period related to the<br>
reception or modification of the system information may also refer to a minimum time<br>
in which the base station should wait until the next system information modification<br>
after modifying the system information. In addition, the period related to the reception<br>
or modification of the system information may refer to a minimum time in which the<br>
base station should modify system information and wait until modified system in-<br>
formation is to be transmitted, if the base station notifies the terminal that system in-<br>
formation has not been modified. The period related to the reception or modification of<br>
the system information may refer to a maximum period, in regard to the system in-<br>
formation modification, which allows the terminal to check whether or not system in-<br>
formation has been modified. The period related to the reception or modification of the<br>
system information may refer to a period in which the terminal periodically checks<br>
whether or not system information is modified or periodically receives system in-<br>
formation. Here, the period related to the reception or modification of the system in-<br>
formation may refer to a maximum time which does not need to further receive system<br>
information, or a time period without needing to check the modification of the system<br>
information after the terminal verifies that system information has not been modified<br>
as compared to the previously received system information. Further, the period related<br>
to the reception or modification of the system information may refer to a period for<br>
starting reception of modified system information after the terminal verifies that<br>
system information has been modified when compared to the previously received<br>
system information.<br>
[41] The present invention proposes to operate the terminal and the base station by using<br>
time information related to reception or modification of system information. Here, the<br>
time information related to the reception or modification of the system information<br>
may refer to when modified system information, as compared to the previous system<br>
information, can be transmitted. In addition, the time information related to the<br>
reception or modification of the system information may indicate a starting time when<br>
a first portion of modified system information is and/or can be transmitted. The time<br>
information related to the reception or modification of the system information may<br>
indicate a time when the base station can modify system information or start the<br>
transmission of modified system information. The time information related to the<br>
reception or modification of the system information may refer to a time when the base<br>
station can perform the next modification of system information after having modified<br>
the system information. In addition, the time information related to the reception or<br>
modification of the system information may indicate a time when the system can start<br>
the transmission of actually modified system information, if system information needs<br>
to be modified after the system informs the terminal that the system information has<br>
not been modified when compared to the previous system information. The time in-<br>
formation related to the reception or modification of the system information may refer<br>
to a time, in regard to the modification of system information, when the terminal starts<br>
checking whether or not system information has been modified. In addition, the time<br>
information related to the reception or modification of the system information may<br>
refer to a limit time duration (or time period) in which there is no need to receive<br>
further system information, or a time when an operation to check whether or not<br>
system information modification is to be performed in the next time should be<br>
performed after the terminal checks that system information has not been modified<br>
when compared to the previously received system information. In addition, the time in-<br>
formation related to the reception or modification of the system information may refer<br>
to a time when the terminal starts the reception of new (modified) system information<br>
after checking that the system information has been modified when compared to the<br>
previous system information. The time information related to the reception or modi-<br>
fication of the system information may refer to a time when the terminal periodically<br>
checks whether or not system information is modified or periodically receives the<br>
system information.<br>
[42] The present invention proposes to operate the terminal and the base station by using<br>
time period (time duration) information related to reception or modification of system<br>
information. Here, the time period information related to the reception or modification<br>
of the system information may refer to a time period in which the system information<br>
is transmitted a number of times with the same content System information may be<br>
transmitted with the same content or with different content in a certain time period<br>
designated by the time period information related to the reception or modification of<br>
the system information. The time period information related to the reception or modi-<br>
fication of the system information may refer to the next time period which modified<br>
system information can be transmitted if the base station desires to change the system<br>
information that is being transmitted. Here, the time period information related to the<br>
reception or modification of the system information may refer to a unit of time in<br>
which the base station can modify system information, or a time period in which the<br>
base station can start the transmission of modified system information. Or, it may refer<br>
to a time period in which the base station may modify the system information. In<br>
addition, the time period information related to the reception or modification of the<br>
system information may refer to a time period in which the base station can perform a<br>
next modification of system information after changing the system information. In<br>
regard to the modification of the system information, it may refer to a time period in<br>
which the terminal starts checking whether or not the system information has been<br>
changed. The time period information related to the reception or modification of the<br>
system information may refer to a time period in which the terminal considers that the<br>
system information would be transmitted with the same content, after checking that the<br>
system information has not been modified as compared to the previously received<br>
system information. Or it may refer to a time period in which an operation should be<br>
performed to check whether or not system information modification is to be performed<br>
in the next time period. The time period information related to the reception or modi-<br>
fication of the system information may refer to a time period in which the terminal pe-<br>
riodically checks whether or not system information has been modified or periodically<br>
receives the system information.<br>
[43] That is, in the present invention, the base station sets the system information modi-<br>
fication periods, and transmits the system information with the same content in the<br>
same system information modification period. Accordingly, the base station may<br>
transmit system information with different content in different system information<br>
modification period only. That is, the system information modification period refers to<br>
a time period in which the system information is transmitted with the same content.<br>
[44] In regard to the system information modification period, the base station informs the<br>
terminal about information, such as a starting point, a period of time duration, a length<br>
of time duration, and the like. Based on such information, the terminal would know in-<br>
formation about each of the system information modification periods. Accordingly, in<br>
the present invention, the base station is configured to set system information modi-<br>
fication periods and notify information related to the system information modification<br>
periods. The terminal considers (determines) that system information of the same<br>
content is transmitted within the same system information modification period. Ac-<br>
cordingly, if it is checked that the system information is not modified in a current<br>
system information modification period, the terminal determines that the system in-<br>
formation has not been modified in this system information modification period as<br>
compared to the previous system information, thereby not reading the system in-<br>
formation. In addition, if the terminal checks that the system information has not been<br>
modified in the current system information modification period, the terminal checks<br>
whether or not the system information would be modified in the next system in-<br>
formation modification period. If the system information is determined to be modified<br>
in the current system information modification period, the terminal would read the<br>
system information. Here, when the system information should be read, the terminal<br>
would read such information in the current system information modification period.<br>
Accordingly, in the present invention, the base station sets the system information<br>
modification periods and notifies information related to such system information modi-<br>
fication periods. The system is configured to transmit the system information of the<br>
same content within the same system information modification period. Accordingly, if<br>
the base station determines that system information should be modified within a certain<br>
system information modification period during its transmission, the base station would<br>
transmit the system information that are already being transmitted within the current<br>
system information modification period, and then transmit modified system in-<br>
formation in the next system information modification period.<br>
[45] The system information change may only occur at specific radio frames (i.e., concept<br>
of a modification period is used). The system information messages may be<br>
transmitted a number of times with the same content within the modification period, as<br>
defined by its scheduling. The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN mod<br>
N, where N is configured by system information. When the network changes all or<br>
some of the system information, it first notifies the terminal (UEs) about this change,<br>
and this notification may be done throughout a modification period. In the next modi-<br>
fication period, the network may transmit the updated system information. Upon<br>
receiving a change notification, the terminal (UE) may know that the current system<br>
information is valid until the next modification period boundary. After this boundary,<br>
the terminal may acquire the new system information.<br>
[46] The present invention may provide a method of receiving system information for an<br>
uplink access in a wireless communication system, the method comprising: receiving<br>
the system information and period information related to a modification of the system<br>
information; determining whether or not the system information needs to be modified;<br>
and receiving updated system information according to the period information if the<br>
system information is determined to be modified, wherein the period information<br>
comprises at least one of a starting point of a modification period, an ending point of<br>
the modification period or total time duration (period) of the modification period, the<br>
period information indicates a minimum period in which the system information can be<br>
modified, the period information indicates a minimum period in which a base station<br>
can change the system information, the period information indicates a minimum time<br>
in which the base station should wait for the next updated system information after<br>
changing the system information, the period information indicates a maximum period<br>
in which the terminal checks whether or not the system information has been modified,<br>
the period information indicates a starting time to receive the modified system in-<br>
formation, the modified system information is also received in the certain modification<br>
period when the period information is received in a certain modification period, the<br>
modified system information is received in another modification period, other than the<br>
certain modification period when the period information is received in a certain modi-<br>
fication period, or the modified system information is received in the next modification<br>
period after the certain modification period when the period information is received in<br>
a certain modification period.<br>
[47] It can be also said that the present invention also provide a method of transmitting<br>
system information for an uplink access in a wireless communication system, the<br>
method comprising: transmitting the system information and period information<br>
related to a modification of the system information; notifying whether or not the<br>
system information needs to be modified; and transmitting updated system information<br>
according to the period information if the system information is determined to be<br>
modified, wherein the period information comprises at least one of a starting point of a<br>
modification period, an ending point of the modification period or total time duration<br>
(period) of the modification period, the period information indicates a minimum period<br>
in which the system information can be modified, the period information indicates a<br>
minimum period in which a base station can change the system information, the period<br>
information indicates a minimum time in which the base station should wait for the<br>
next updated system information after changing the system information, the period in-<br>
formation indicates a maximum period in which the terminal checks whether or not the<br>
system information has been modified, the period information indicates a starting time<br>
to transmit the modified system information, the modified system information is also<br>
transmitted in the certain modification period when the period information is<br>
transmitted in a certain modification period, the modified system information is<br>
transmitted in another modification period, other than the certain modification period<br>
when the period information is transmitted in a certain modification period, or the<br>
modified system information is transmitted in the next modification period after the<br>
certain modification period when the period information is transmitted in a certain<br>
modification period.<br>
[48] Namely, the present invention has an effect of efficiently receiving and updating, by<br>
the terminal, system information if the system information is modified, in which the<br>
base station which transmits to the terminal control information required for a<br>
connection with the base station (i.e., system information) uses a minimum radio<br>
resources of a cell under its management, thereby maximizing efficiency of radio<br>
resources as well as minimizing power consumption of the terminal which should<br>
receive the control information.<br>
[49] Although the present invention is described in the context of mobile commu-<br>
nications, the present invention may also be used in any wireless communication<br>
systems using mobile devices, such as PDAs and laptop computers equipped with<br>
wireless communication capabilities (i.e. interface). Moreover, the use of certain terms<br>
to describe the present invention is not intended to limit the scope of the present<br>
