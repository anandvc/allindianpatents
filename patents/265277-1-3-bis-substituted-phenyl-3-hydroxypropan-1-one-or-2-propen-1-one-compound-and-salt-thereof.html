1,3-BIS(SUBSTITUTED PHENYL)-3-HYDROXYPROPAN-l-ONE OR 2-PROPEN-l-ONE COMPOUND, AND SALT THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a l,3-bis(substituted phenyl)-3-substituent-3-hydroxypropan-1-one compound or salt thereof and a l,3-b&gt;is(substituted phenyl)-3-substituent-2-propen-l-one compound or salt thereof, which are novel process intermediates useful as an agricultural chemical but have never been described in a document. The compounds or salts thereof are especially useful as process intermediates of a noxious organism control agent described in WO 05/085216 pamphlet.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Previously, a 3-bromoalkyl-substituted compound (see Non-patent Documents 1 to 3, for example), a 3-chloroalkyl-substituted compound (see Non-patent Documents 4 and 5, for example), a 3-fluoroalkyl-substituted compound (see Non-patent Documents 6 and 7, for example), and the like have been known as a l,3-bis(substituted phenyl)-3-substituent-3-hydroxypropan-l-one compound, and 3-hydroxy-l-(4-methylphenyl)-3-phenyl-4,4,4-trifluorobutan-1-one is distributed by ChemBridge Corporation.<br>
A 3-halo(other than fluorine atom)alkyl-substituted compound (see Non-patent Documents 8 and 9, for example) and the like are known as a l,3-bis(substituted phenyl)-3-substituent-2-propen-l-one compound. A process intermediate of an agricultural chemical 4-(3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-oxo-1 -(trifluoromethy 1)-1 -propenyl)-2-methylphenylcarbamate tertiary-butyl ester (see Patent Document 1) is known as a 3-fluoroalkyl-substituted compound, and other 3-fluoroalkyl-substituted compounds (see Non-patent Documents 10 to 12, for example) are known. Compounds having benzyloxy group on a substituted phenyl are described in Patent Documents 2 and 3 as a 1,3-bis(substituted phenyl)-3-substituent-2-propen-l-one compound described as an agricultural chemical.<br>
However, there is no description in the documents regarding a l,3-bis(substituted phenyl)-3-substituent-3-hydroxypropan-l-one compound and a l,3-bis(substituted phenyl)-3-substituent-2-propen-l-one compound, both of which can be used as a process intermediate derivable into a compound described in Patent Document 4, of these compounds described in the documents.
