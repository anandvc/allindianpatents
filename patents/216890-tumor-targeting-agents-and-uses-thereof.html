FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to tumor targeting agents comprising<br>
at least one targeting unit and at least one effector unit, as well as to tumor<br>
targeting units and motits. Further, the present invention concerns pharmaceutical<br>
and diagnostic compositions comprising such targeting agents or targeting<br>
units, and the use of such targeting agents and targeting units as Pharmaceuticals<br>
or as diagnostic tools. The invention further relates to the use of such<br>
targeting agents and targeting units for the preparation of pharmaceutical or<br>
diagnostic compositions and for the preparation of reagents to be used in diagnosis<br>
or research. Furthermore, the invention relates to kits for diagnosing or<br>
treating cancer and metastases. Still further, the invention relates to methods<br>
of removing, selecting, sorting and enriching cells, and to materials and kits for<br>
use in such methods.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Malignant tumors are one of the greatest health problems of man as<br>
well as animals, being one of the most common causes of death, also among<br>
young individuals. Available methods of treatment of cancer are quite limited,<br>
in spite of intensive research efforts during several decades. Although curative<br>
treatment (usually surgery in combination with chemothreapy and/or radiotherapy)<br>
is sometimes possible, malignant tumors (cancer) still are one of the most<br>
feared diseases of mankind, requiring a huge number of lives every year. In<br>
fact, curative treatment is rarely accomplished if the disease is not diagnosed<br>
early. In addition, certain tumor types can rarely, if ever, be treated curatively.<br>
There are various reasons for this very undesirable situation but the<br>
most important one is clearly the fact that nearly all (if not all) treatment sched-<br>
ules (except surgery) lack sufficient selectivity. Chemotherapeutic agents<br>
commonly used, such as alkylating agents, platinum compounds (e.g. cis-<br>
platin), bleomycin-type agents, other alkaloids and other cytostatic agents in<br>
general, do not act on the malignant cells of the tumors alone but are highly<br>
toxic to other cells as well, being usually especially toxic to rapidly dividing cell<br>
types, such as hematopoietic and epithelial cells. The same applies to radio<br>
therapy.<br>
In addition to the above mentioned complications, two further major<br>
problems plague the non-surgical treatment of malignant solid tumors. First,<br>
physiological barriers within tumors impede the delivery of therapeutics at effective<br>
concentrations to all cancer cells. Second, acquired drug resistance resulting<br>
from genetic and epigenetic mechanisms reduces the effectiveness of<br>
available drugs.<br>
The treatment of cancer patients with currently available, largely<br>
non-selective, chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy results often also in<br>
undesirable side effects. In order to improve the effect of chemotherapeutic<br>
agents and to diminish the side effects it would be extremely important to identify<br>
agents that are capable of targeting to specific organs or tissues or to tumor<br>
tissues and to carry the desired cytotoxic or other drugs specifically to<br>
these organs or tissues.<br>
The same applies also to a specific field of cancer treatment,<br>
namely neutron capture therapy, in which a non-radioactive nucleus (e.g. 10B,<br>
157Gd or 6Li) is converted into a radioactive nucleus in vivo in the patient with<br>
the aid of thermal (slow) neutrons from an external source. In this case, some<br>
prior art agents are claimed to have some 2-3 fold selectivity for at least some<br>
types of tumors, but the results obtained have been mainly disappointing and<br>
negative. Specific targeting agents would offer remarkable advantages also in<br>
this field.<br>
Also in the diagnosis of cancer and of metastases, including the follow-up<br>
of patients and the study of the effects of treatment on tumors and metastases,<br>
more reliable, more sensitive and more selective methods and<br>
agents would be a great advantage. This is true for all methods currently in<br>
use, such as nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR, MRI), X-ray meth-<br>
ods, histological staining methods (for light microscopy and electron microscopy<br>
and related methods, and in the future possibly also NMR, infrared, electron<br>
spin resonance and related methods) and in general any imaging as well<br>
as laboratory methods (histology, cytology, cell sorting, hematological studies,<br>
FACS and so on) known by specialists in the field. Here, agents capable of<br>
targeting an entity for detection (a spin label, a radioactive substance, a paramagnetic<br>
contrast agent for NMR or a contrast agent for X-ray imaging or tomography,<br>
a boron atom for neutron capture and so on) specifically or selectively<br>
to tumor tissues, metastases or tumor cells and/or to tumor endothelium<br>
would be a great advantage.<br>
Solid tumor growth is angiogenesis-dependent, and a tumor must<br>
continuously stimulate the growth of new microcapillaries for continued growth.<br><br>
Tumor blood vessels are structurally and functionally different from their normal<br>
resting counterparts. In particular, endothelial cells lining new blood vessels<br>
are abnormal in shape, they grow on top of each other and project into the<br>
lumen of the vessels. This neovascuiar heterogeneity depends on the tumor<br>
type and on the host organ in which the tumor is growing. Therefore vascular<br>
permeability and angiogenesisis are unique in every different organ and in tu-<br>
mor tissue derived from the organ.<br>
There are numerous publications disclosing peptides homing to dif-<br>
ferent cell and tissue types. Some of these are claimed to be useful as cancer<br>
targeting peptides. Among the earliest identified homing peptides described<br>
are the integrin and NGR-receptor targeting peptides described by Ruoslahti et<br>
al., in e.g., US Patent No 6,180,084. These peptides home to angiogenic vas-<br>
culature and bind to the NGR-receptor.<br>
When tumors switch to the angiogenic phenotype and recruit new<br>
blood vessels, endothelial cells in these vessels express proteins on the lu-<br>
minal surface that are not produced by normal quiescent vascular endothe-<br>
lium. One such protein is avp3 integrin. US Patent publication, US 6,177,542,<br>
discloses a peptide that can bind specifically to av|33 integrin. The tumor ves-<br>
sel specific targets described are adhesion molecules that mediate binding of<br>
endothelial cells to the vascular basement membrane. This peptide is a nine-<br>
residue cyclic peptide containing an ArgGlyAsp (RGD) sequence. Pasqualini et<br>
al., (1997) showed that when injected intravenously the peptide was able to<br>
home to blood vessels of murine and human tumors in mice 40-80 fold more<br>
efficiently than to those of control organs. It was suggested that RGD peptides<br>
may be suitable tools in tumor targeting for diagnostic and therapeutic pur-<br>
poses. However, integrin-binding peptides may interfere with cell attachment in<br>
general, and are thus not suitable for clinical applications for selective tumor<br>
targeting.<br>
International Patent Publication WO 00/67771 provides endostatin<br>
peptides comprising the amino acid sequence RLQD, RAD, DGK/R. Other ex-<br>
amples of peptides that home to angiogenic vasculature are described in US<br>
Patent Nos 5.817,750 and 5,955,572. These peptides recognize RGD.<br>
US Patent 5.628.979 describes oligopeptides for in vivo tumor imag-<br>
ing and therapy. The oligopeptides contain 4 to 50 amino acids, which contain<br>
as a characteristic triplet the amino acid sequence Leu-Asp-Val (LDV). This<br>
triplet is reported to provide the oligopeptide with in vivo binding affinity for<br>
LDV binding sites on tumors and other tissues.<br>
International Patent publication WO 99/47550 describes cyclic pep-<br>
tides, containing an HWGF motif, that are specific inhibitors of MMP-2 and<br>
MMP-9. They have also found that the cyclic decapeptide CTTHWGFTLC spe-<br>
cifically inhibits the activities of these enzymes, suppresses migration of both<br>
tumor cells and endothelial cells in vitro, homes to tumor vasculature in vivo,<br>
and prevents the growth and invasion of tumors in mice. However, peptides<br>
that act as inhibitors of MMPs show background binding to non-tumor tissues.<br>
The fact that MMPs are expressed also in normal tissue throughout the body<br>
also makes the administration of such peptides to humans or animals hazardous<br>
and even fatal, since the activity of these enzymes is required for normal<br>
tissue functions (Hidalgo and Eckhardt, 2001).<br>
US Patent publication US 2002/0102265A1 describes a peptide,<br>
TSPLNIHNGQKL, that targets squamous cell cancer cell lines, and becomes<br>
internalized into cells in vitro. This peptide also targets experimental squamous<br>
carcinomas in nude mice.<br>
US Patent Nos. 5,622,699 and 6,068,829 disclose a family of peptides<br>
comprising an SRL motif, which selectively home to brain.<br>
International Patent publication WO 02/20769 discloses methods for<br>
identifying tissue specific peptides by phage display and biopanning. Some of<br>
the identified peptides are suggested to be tumor specific.<br>
Although there are known homing peptides that bind to tumor vasculature,<br>
there are still very scarce reports on targeting agents that actually<br>
target tumor cells and tissues in vivo. Most of the previously described targeting<br>
peptides are vasculature specific. Thus, there is still an established need<br>
for new agents that target selectively to tumor tissue, tumor vasculature, or<br>
both.<br>
For therapeutic applications, targeting peptides have been conju-<br>
gated to doxorubicin in an uncontrolled fashion, obviously resulting in mixtures<br>
of products or at least in an undefined structure and possibly also resulting in<br>
unefficient action and especially in difficulties in the identification, purification,<br>
quality control and quantitative analysis of the agent, even the amount of<br>
doxorubicin per peptide molecule remaining unknown (e.g. Arap et al., 1998).<br>
The unspecific conjugation process might also impair the targeting functions of<br>
the peptide.<br>
Another very serious disadvantage of the prior art is that most of the<br>
described targeting peptides appear to target to the tumor endothelium only<br>
and not to the tumor mass itself. For example, the targeting peptide used by<br>
Nicklin et al. (2000) directed adenovirus DNA transfection to resting endothelial<br>
cells in vitro, under conditions that hardly could be applied in vivo.<br>
The targeting units according to the present invention offer an advantage<br>
over the prior art in that they seem to target to both the tumor endothelium<br>
and the tumor cell mass. This fact provides the possibility to target and<br>
destroy tumor endothellum suporting tumor growth as well as the tumor mass<br>
itself. A major advantage of this approach comes from the fact that the endothelium<br>
is a genetically stable tissue that will not acquire drug resistance but<br>
will be irreversibly eliminated.<br>
It is not known whether the prior art targeting peptides are universal<br>
in the sense of being capable to target to any malignant tumor type. Thus, their<br>
use as targeting therapeutic agents to a certain specified tumor may be com-<br>
pletely useless, giving no therapeutic advantage or effect over the free thera-<br>
peutic agent itself. An even more serious drawback is that the use of such tar-<br>
geting agents in diagnostic procedures may not reveal all existing tumors and<br>
the malignant process may remain unrecognized.<br>
The present invention offers a significant improvement in view of the<br>
prior art, since the targeting agents here described were found to target to all<br>
of the various tumor types tested. Remarkably, they target, for example, sar-<br>
comas, such as Kaposi"s sarcoma, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) overex-<br>
pressing, highly angiogenic tumors, carcinomas, and to human primary and<br>
metastatic melanomas<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide novel tumor and<br>
angiogenic tissue targeting agents that comprise at least one targeting unit<br>
and, optionally, at least one effector unit. In particular, the invention provides<br>
targeting units comprising at least one motif that is capable of targeting both<br>
tumor endothelium and tumor cell mass. Such targeting units, optionally cou-<br>
pled to at least one effector unit, are therapeutically and diagnostically useful,<br>
especially in the treatment and diagnosis of cancer, including metastases. Fur-<br>
thermore the targeting agents according to the present invention are useful for<br>
cell removal, selection, sorting and enrichment.<br>
It is a second object of this invention to provide pharmaceutical and<br>
diagnostic compositions comprising at least one targeting agent or at least one<br>
targeting unit comprising at least one motif capable of specifically targeting tumors,<br>
tumor cells and tumor endothelium.<br>
Further, it is a third object of the invention to provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic<br>
methods and kits for the treatment and/or diagnosis of cancer.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that a group of pep-<br>
tides having specific amino acid sequences or motifs are capable of selectively<br>
targeting tumors in vivo and tumor cells in vitro. Thus, the peptides of this in-<br>
vention, when administered to a human or animal subject, are capable of se-<br>
lectively binding to tumors but not to normal tissue in the body.<br>
The present invention is also directed to the use of the targeting<br>
agents and analogues thereof for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical or<br>
diagnostic composition for treating or diagnosing cancer.<br>
The targeting units of this invention may be used as such or coupled<br>
to at least one effector unit. Such substances can destroy the tumors or hinder<br>
their growth. The targeting units and targeting agents of this invention can tar-<br>
get also metastases and therefore they may be used to destroy or hinder the<br>
growth of metastases. As early diagnosis of metastases is very important for<br>
successful treatment of cancer, an important use of the targeting units and tar-<br>
geting agents of this invention is in early diagnosis of tumor metastases.<br>
The present invention further encompasses salts, derivatives and<br>
analogues of the targeting units and targeting agents, as described herein, as<br>
well as uses thereof.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide diagnostic<br>
and pharniaceutical composition-comprising targeting agents according to the<br>
present invention, as well as therapeutic and diagnostic methods for the treatment<br>
and diagnosis of cancer, utilizing targeting agents according to the present<br>
invention. Also provided are kits for use in such methods or for research<br>
purposes, as well as in cell sorting or removal.<br>
Especially preferred embodiments of the present invention relate to<br>
a group of small, cyclic tumor targeting peptides comprising a motif, LRS or<br>
SRL, optionally coupled to an effector unit and other additional units, as de-<br>
scribed in more detail herein.<br>
ACCOMPANYING<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE RAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a graph showing the therapeutic effect of a targeting<br>
agent comprising doxorubicin.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
For the purpose of this invention, the term "cancer" is used herein in<br>
its broadest sense, and includes any disease or condition involving trans-<br>
formed or malignant cells. In the art, cancers are classified into five major cate-<br>
gories, according to their tissue origin (histological type): carcinomas, sarco-<br>
mas, myleomas, and lymphomas, which are solid tumor type cancers, and leu-<br>
kemias, which are "liquid cancers". The term cancer, as used in the present in-<br>
vention, is intended to primarily include all types of diseases characterized by<br>
solid tumors, including disease states where there is no detectable solid tumor<br>
or where malignant or transformed cells, "cancer cells", appear as diffuse infil-<br>
trates or sporadically among other cells in healthy tissue.<br>
The terms "amino acitf"and "amino alcohol" are to be interpreted<br>
herein to include also diamino, triamino, oligoamino and polyamino acids and<br>
alcohols; dicarboxyl, tricarboxyl, oligocarboxyl and polycarboxyl amino acids;<br>
dihydroxyl, trihydroxyl, oligohydroxyl and polyhydroxyl amino alcohols; and<br>
analogous compounds comprising more than one carboxyl group or hydroxyl<br>
group and one or more amino groups.<br>
By the term "peptide" is meant, according to established terminol-<br>
ogy, a chain of amino acids (peptide units) linked together by peptide bonds to<br>
form an amino acid chain. Peptides may be cyclic as described below. For the<br>
purposes of the present invention, also compounds comprising one or more D-<br>
amino acids, p-amino acids and/or other unnatural amino acids (e.g. amino ac-<br>
ids with unnatural side chains) are included in the term "peptide". For the pur-<br>
poses of the present invention, the term "peptide" is intended to include pepti-<br>
dyl analogues comprising modified amino acids. Such modifications may com-<br>
prise the introduction or presence of a substituent in a ring or chain; the intro-<br>
duction or presence of an "extra" functional group such as an amino, hy-<br>
drazino, carboxyl, formyl (aldehyde) or keto group, or another moiety; and the<br>
absence or removal of a functional group or other moiety. The term also in-<br>
cludes analogues modified in the amino- and/or carboxy termini, such as pep-<br>
tide amides and N-substituted amides, peptide hydrazides, /V-substituted hy-<br>
drazides, peptide esters, and their like, and peptides that do not comprise the<br>
amino-terminal -NH2 group or that comprise e.g. a modified amino-terminal<br>
amino group or an imino or a hydrazino group instead of the amino-terminal<br>
amino group, and peptides that do not comprise the carboxy-terminal carboxyl<br>
group or comprise a modified group instead of it, and so on.<br>
Some examples of possible reaction types that can be used to modify<br>
peptides, forming "peptidy analogues", are e.g.,cycloaddition, condensation<br>
and nucleophilic addition reactions as well as esterification, amide formation,<br>
formation of substituted amides, N-alkylation, formation of hydrazides, salt<br>
formation. Salt formation may be the formation of any type of salt, such as alkali<br>
or other metal salt, ammonium salt, salts with organic bases, acid addition<br>
salts etc. Peptidyl analogues may be synthesized either from the corresponding<br>
peptides or directly (via other routes).<br>
Compounds that are structural or functional analogues of the pep-<br>
tides of the invention may be compounds that do not consist of amino acids or<br>
not of amino acids alone, or some or all of whose building blocks are modified<br>
amino acids. Different types of building blocks can be used for this purpose, as<br>
is well appreciated by those skilled in the art. The function of these compounds<br>
in biological systems is essentially similar to the function of the peptides. The<br>
resemblance between these compounds and the original peptides is thus<br>
based on structural and functional similarities. Such compounds are called<br>
peptidomimetic analogues, as they mimic the function, conformation and/or<br>
structure of the original peptides and, for the purposes of the present invention,<br>
they are included in the term "peptide".<br>
A functional analog of a peptide according to the present invention<br>
; is characterized by a binding ability with respect to the binding to tumors, tumor<br>
tissue, tumor cells or tumor endothelium which is essentially similar to that of<br>
the peptides they resemble.<br>
For example, compounds like benzolactam or piperazine containing<br>
analogues based on the primary sequence of the original peptides can be<br>
used (Adams et al., 1999; Nakanishi and Kahn, 1996a, 1996b; Houghten et al.,<br>
1999; Nargund et al., 1998). A large variety of types of peptidomimetic sub-<br>
stances have been reported in the scientific and patent literature and are well<br>
known to those skilled in the art. Peptidomimetic substances (analogues) may<br>
comprise for example one or more of the following structural components: re-<br>
duced amides, hydroxyethylene and/or hydroxyethylamine isosteres, N-methyl<br>
amino acids, urea derivatives, thiourea derivatives, cyclic urea and/or thiourea<br>
derivatives, poly(ester imide)s, polyesters, esters, guanidine derivatives, cyclic<br>
guanidines, imidazoyl compounds, imidazolinyl compounds, imidazolidinyl<br>
compounds, lactams, lactones, aromatic rings, bicyclic systems, hydantoins<br>
and/or thiohydantoins as well as various other structures. Many types of com-<br>
pounds for the synthesis of peptidomimetic substances are available from a<br>
number of commercial sources (e.g. Peptide and Peptidomimetic Synthesis,<br>
Reagents for Drug Discovery, Fluka ChemieGmbH, Buchs, Switzerland, 2000<br>
and Novabiochem 2000 Catalog, Calbiochem-Novabiochem AG, Laufelfingen,<br>
Switzerland, 2000). The resemblance between the peptidomimetic compounds<br>
and the original peptides is based on structural and/or functional similarities.<br>
Thus, the peptidomimetic compounds mimic the properties of the original peptides<br>
and, for the purpose of the present application, their binding ability is<br>
similar to the peptides that they resemble. Peptidomimetic compounds can be<br>
made up, for example, of unnatural amino acids (such as D-amino acids or<br>
amino acids comprising unnatural side chains, or of b-amino acids etc.), which<br>
do not appear in the original peptides, or they can be considered to consist of<br>
or can be made from other compounds or structural units. Examples of synthetic<br>
peptidomimetic compounds comprise N-alkylamino cyclic urea, thiourea,<br>
polyesters, poly(ester imide)s, bicyclic guanidines, hydantoins, thiohydantoins,<br>
and imidazoi-pyridino-inoles (Houghten et al. 1999 and Nargund et al., 1998).<br>
Such peptidomimetic compounds can be characterized as being "structural or<br>
functional analogues" of the peptides of this invention.<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, the term "targeting unit"<br>
stands for a compound, a peptide, capable of selectively targeting and selec-<br>
tively binding to tumors, and, preferably, also to tumor stroma, tumor paren-<br>
chyma and/or extracellular matrix of tumors. Another term used in the art for<br>
this specific association is "homing". Tumor targeting means that the targeting<br>
units specifically bind to tumors when administered to a human or animal body.<br>
More specifically, the targeting units may bind to a cell surface, to a specific<br>
molecule or structure on a cell surface or within the cells, or they may associ-<br>
ate with the extracellular matrix present between the cells. The targeting units<br>
may also bind to the endothelial cells or the extracellular matrix of tumor vas-<br>
culature. The targeting units may bind also to the tumor mass, tumor cells and<br>
extracellular matrix of metastases.<br>
Generally, the terms "targeting" or "binding" stand for adhesion, at-<br>
tachment, affinity or binding of the targeting units of this invention to tumors,<br>
tumor cells and/or tumor tissue to the extent that the binding can be objectively<br>
measured and determined e.g., by peptide competition experiments in vivo or<br>
ex vivo, on tumor biopsies in vitro or by immunological stainings in situ, or by<br>
other methods known by those skilled in the art. The exact mechanism of the<br>
binding of targeting units according to the present invention is not known.<br>
Tageting peptides according to the present invention are considered to be<br>
"bound" to the tumor target in vitro, when the binding is strong enough to with-<br>
stand normal sample treatment, such as washes and rinses with physiological<br>
saline or other physiologically acceptable salt or buffer solutions at physiologi-<br>
cal pH, or when bound to a tumor target in vivo long enough for the effector<br>
unit to exhibit its function on the target.<br>
The binding of the present targeting agents or targeting units to tu-<br>
mors is "selective" meaning that they do not bind to normal cells and organs,<br>
or bind to such to a significantly lower degree as compared to tumor cells and<br>
organs.<br>

part of a larger structure, such as a peptide or some other structure. When the<br>
compound or structure in question comprises more than one motif Dd-Ee-Ff,<br>
the orientation and direction of the motifs may vary.<br>
TARGETING UNITS ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
It has also been found that peptides and structural or functional ana-<br>
logues thereof comprising a tumor targeting motif according to the present in-<br>
vention target to and exhibit selective binding to tumor cells and tissues. Pep-<br>
tides comprising a tumor targeting motif according to the present invention<br>
and, optionally, up to four additional amino acid residues or analogues thereof,<br>
likewise exhibit such targeting and selective binding and are especially pre-<br>
ferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Such peptides are highly advantageous for use as targeting units<br>
according to the present invention, e.g., because of their small size and their<br>
easier and more reliable and much cheaper synthesis, purification, analysis<br>
and quality control.<br>
Especially preferred targeting units according to the present invention<br>
are peptides cyclized by an amide bond, such as a lactam bridge or by an<br>
ester bond, such as a lacotone bridge.<br>
Such cyclic targeting units have now been shown to selectively target<br>
to tumors in vivo.<br>
Preferred tumor targeting units according to the present invention<br>
comprise a tumor targeting motif Dd-Ee-Ff as defined above, and additional<br>
residues selected from the group consisting of:<br>
natural amino acids;<br>
unnatural amino acids;<br>
amino acid analogues comprising maximally 30 non-hydrogen atoms and an<br>
unlimited number of hydrogen atoms,; and<br>
other structural units and residues whose molecular weight and/or formula<br>
weight is maximally 270;<br>
wherein<br>
the number of said additional residues ranges from 0 to 4, preferably from 0 to<br>
3, more preferably from 0 to 2, and most preferably is either 0 or 2.<br>
Cyclic peptides are usually more stable in vivo and in many other<br>
biological systems than are their non-cyclic counterparts, as is known in the<br>
art. It has now, however, surprisingly been found that the targeting property of<br>
the small peptides according to the present invention is more pronounced<br>
when the targeting unit is cyclic or contained in a cyclic structure.<br>
Preferred targeting units according to the present invention may<br>
comprise a structure<br>
wherein,<br>
Dd-Ee-Ff is a tumor targeting motif according to the present inven-<br>
tion, as described above,<br>
Rr is any amino acid residue,<br>
n and m are integers 0-4, preferably 0-3, more preferably 0-2,<br>
whereby the sum of n and m does not exceed four, and,<br>
Cy and Cyy are entities capable of forming a cyclic structure by<br>
means of a lactam ring.<br>
Lactams can be of several subtypes, such as "head to tail" (carboxy<br>
terminus plus amino terminus), "head to side chain" and "side chain to head"<br>
(carboxy or amino terminus plus one side chain amino or carboxyl group) and<br>
"side chain to side chain" (amino groug of one side chain and carboxys group<br>
of another side chaine).<br>
Preferred targeting units are such, where Rr is any amino acid resi-<br>
due, except histidine, lysine or tryptophane. Especially preferred are targeting<br>
units wherein Rr is R or G.<br>
Preferred structures are thus compounds of the general formula<br>
as defined above, and wherein Cy and Cyy are residues capable of forming a<br>
lactam bond, such as aspartic acid (D), glutamic acid (E), lysin (K), omithine<br>
(0) or analogues thereof comprising no more than 12 carbon atoms.<br>
Especially preferred targeting units according to the present inven-<br>
tion having a cyclic structure by virtue of a lactam bridge, are :<br>
DLRSK (SEQ ID NO: 1), DGRGLRSK (SEQ ID NO: 2), DRGLRSK (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 3), DRYYNLRSK (SEQ ID NO: 4), DSRYNLRSK (SEQ ID NO: 5),<br>
DLRSGRK (SEQ ID NO: 6), DLRSGRGK (SEQ ID NO: 7), OLRSE (SEQ ID<br>
NO. 8), OLRSGRGE (SEQ ID NO. 9) and KLRSD (SEQ ID NO. 10),<br>
as well as salts, esters, derivatives and analogues thereof, as defined above.<br>
TARGETING AGENTS ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
It has also been found that targeting agents comprising at least one<br>
tumor targeting unit according to the present invention, and at least one effec-<br>
tor unit, target to and exhibit selective binding to cancer cells and tissues as<br>
well as endothelial cells.<br>
The tumor targeting agents according to the present invention may<br>
optionally comprise unit(s) such as linkers, solubility modifiers, stabilizers,<br>
charge modifiers, spacers, lysis or reaction or reactivity modifiers, internalizing<br>
units or intemalization enhancers or membrane interaction units or other local<br>
route, attachment, binding and distribution affecting units. Such additional units<br>
of the tumor targeting agents according to the present invention may be cou-<br>
pled to each other by any means suitable for that purpose.<br>
Many possibilities are known to those skilled in the art for linking<br>
structures, molecules, groups etc. of the types in question or of related types,<br>
to each other. The various units may be linked either directly or with the aid of<br>
one or more identical, similar and/or different linker units. The tumor targeting<br>
agents of the invention may have different structures such as any of the non-<br>
limiting types schematically shown below:<br>
where EU indicates "effector unit" and TU indicates "targeting unit" and n, m<br>
and k are independently any integers except 0.<br>
In the targeting agents according to the present invention, as in<br>
many other medicinal and other substances, it may be wise to include spacers<br>
or linkers, such as amino acids and their analogues, such as long-chain<br>
omega-amino acids, to prevent the targeting units from being "disturbed", steri-<br>
cally, electronically or otherwise hindered or "hidden" by effector units or other<br>
unit of the targeting agent.<br>
In targeting agents according to the present invention it may be useful<br>
for increased activity to use dendrimeric or cyclic structures to provide a<br>
possibility to incorporate multiple effector units or additional units per targeting<br>
unit.<br>
Preferred targeting agents according to the present invention comprise<br>
a structure<br>
TU is a targeting unit according to the present invention as defined abover;<br>
and<br>
Ef and Eff are selected from the group consisting of:<br>
effector units, linker units, solubility modifier units, stabilizer units, charge modifier<br>
units, spacer units, lysis and/or reaction and/or reactivity modifier units, internalizing<br>
and/or internalization enhancer and/or membrane interaction units<br>
and/or other local route and/or local attachment/local binding and/or distribution<br>
affecting units, adsorption enhancer units, and other related units; and<br>
peptide sequences and other structures comprising at least one such unit; and<br>
peptide sequences comprising no more than 20, preferably no more than 12,<br>
more preferably no more than 6, natural and/or unnatural amino acids; and<br>
natural and unnatural amino adds comprising no more than 25 non-hydrogen<br>
atoms and an unlimited number of hydrogen atoms;<br>
as well as salts, esters, derivatives and analogues thereof.<br>
EFFECTOR UNITS<br>
For the purposes of this invention, the term "effector unit" means a<br>
molecule or radical or other chemical entity as well as large particles such as<br>
colloidal particles and their like; liposomes or microgranules. Suitable effector<br>
units may also consitute nanodevices or nanochips or their like; or a combina-<br>
tion of any of these, and optionally chemical structures for the attachment of<br>
the constituents of the effector unit to each or to parts of the targeting agents.<br>
Effector units may also contain moieties that effect stabilization or solubility<br>
enhancement of the effector unit.<br>
Preferred effects provided by the effector units according to the pre-<br>
sent invention are therapeutical (biological, chemical or physical) effects on the<br>
targeted tumor; properties that enable the detection or imaging of tumors or<br>
tumor cells for diagnostic purposes; or binding abilities that relate to the use of<br>
the targeting agents in different applications.<br>
A preferred (biological) activity of the effector units according to the<br>
present invention is a therapeutic effect. Examples of such therapeutic activities<br>
are for example, cytotoxicity, cytostatic effect, ability to cause differentiation<br>
of cells or to increase their degree of differentiation or to cause phenotypic<br>
changes or metabolic changes, chemotactic activities, immunomodulating activities,<br>
pain relieving activities, radioactivity, ability to affect the cell cycle, abil-<br>
ity to cause apoptosis, hormonal activities, enzymatic activities, ability to trans-<br>
fect cells, gene transferring activities, ability to mediate "knock-out" of one or<br>
more genes, ability to cause gene replacements or "knock-in", antiangiogenic<br>
activities, ability to collect heat or other energy from external radiation or electric<br>
or magnetic fields, ability to affect transcription, translation or replication of<br>
the cell"s genetic information or external related information; and to affect<br>
post-transcriptional and/or post-translational events.<br>
Other preferred therapeutic approaches enabled by the effector<br>
units according to the present invention may be based on the use of thermal<br>
(slow) neutrons (to make suitable nuclei radioactive by neutron capture), or the<br>
administration of an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing for example an ester bond<br>
or other bonds or the administration of a targeted enzyme according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Examples of preferred functions of the effector units according to<br>
the present invention suitable for detection are radioactivity, paramagnetism,<br>
ferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, or any type of magnetism, or ability to be detected<br>
by NMR spectroscopy, or ability to be detected by EPR (ESR) spectros-<br>
copy, or suitability for PET and/or SPECT imaging, or the presence of an im-<br>
munogenic structure, or the presence of an antibody or antibody fragment or<br>
antibody-type structure, or the presence of a gold particle, or the presence of<br>
biotin or avidin or other protein, and/or luminescent and/or fluorescent and/or<br>
phosphorescent activity or the ability to enhance detection of tumors, tumor<br>
cells, endothelial cells and metastases in electron microscopy, light microscopy<br>
(UV and/or visible light), infrared microscopy, atomic force microscopy or tun-<br>
neling microscopy, and so on.<br>
Preferred binding abilities of an effector unit according to the present<br>
invention include, for example:<br>
a) ability to bind to a substance or structure such as a histidine or other tag,<br>
b) ability to bind to biotin or analogues thereof,<br>
c) ability to bind to avidin or analogues thereof,<br>
d) ability to bind to an enzyme or a modified enzyme,<br>
e) ability to bind metal ion(s) e.g. by chelation,<br>
f) ability to bind a cytotoxic, apoptotic or metabolism affectin substance or a<br>
substance capable of being converted in situ into such a substance,<br>
g) ability to bind to integrins and other substances involved in cell adhesion,<br>
migration, or intracellular signaling,<br>
h) ability to bind to phages,<br>
i) ability to bind to lymphocytes or other blood cells,<br>
j) ability to bind to any preselected material by virtue of the presence of<br>
antibodies or structures selected by biopanning,<br>
k) ability to bind to material used for signal production or amplification,<br>
I) ability to bind to therapeutic substance.<br>
Such binding may be the result of e.g. chelation, formation of cova-<br>
lent bonds, antibody-antigen-type affinity, ion pair or ion associate formation,<br>
specific interactions of the avidin-biotin-type, or the result of any type or mode<br>
of binding or affinity.<br>
One or more of the effector units or parts of them may also be a part<br>
of the targeting units themselves. Thus, the effector unit may for example be<br>
one or more atoms or nuclei of the targeting unit, such as radioactive atoms or<br>
atoms that can be made radioactive, or paramagnetic atoms or atoms that are<br>
easily detected by MRI or NMR spectroscopy (such as carbon-13). Further ex-<br>
amples are, for example, boron-comprising structures such as carborane-type<br>
lipophilic side chains.<br>
The effector units may be linked to the targeting units by any type of<br>
bond or structure or any combinations of them that are strong enough so that<br>
most, or preferably all or essentially all of the effector units of the targeting<br>
agents remain linked to the targeting units during the essential (necessary)<br>
targeting process, e.g. in a human or animal subject or in a biological sample<br>
under study or treatment.<br>
The effector units or parts of them may remain linked to the target-<br>
ing units, or they may be partly or completely hydrolyzed or otherwise disinte-<br>
grated from the latter, either by a spontaneous chemical reaction or equilibrium<br>
or by a spontaneous enzymatic process or other biological process, or as a re-<br>
sult of an intentional operation or procedure such as the administration of hy-<br>
drolytic enzymes or other chemical substances. It is also possible that the en-<br>
zymatic process or other reaction is caused or enhanced by the administration<br>
of a targeted substance such as an enzyme in accordance with the present in-<br>
vention.<br>
One possibility is that the effector units or parts thereof are hydro-<br>
lyzed from the targeting agent and/or hydrolyzed into smaller units by the ef-<br>
feet of one or more of the various hydrolytic enzymes present in tumors (e.g.,<br>
intracellularly, in the cell membrane or in the extracellular matrix) or in their<br>
near vicinity.<br>
Taking into account that the targeting according to the present in-<br>
vention may be very rapid, even non-specific hydrolysis that occurs every-<br>
where in the body may be acceptable and usable for hydrolysing one or more<br>
effector unit(s) intentionally, since such hydrolysis may in suitable cases (e.g.,<br>
steric hindrance, or even without any such hindering effects) be so slow that<br>
the targeting agents are safely targeted in spite of the presence of hydrolytic<br>
enzymes of the body, as those skilled in the art very well understand. The for-<br>
mation of insoluble products and/or products rapidly absorbed into cells and/or<br>
bound to their surfaces after hydrolysis may also be beneficial for the targeted<br>
effector units and/or their fragments etc. to remain in the tumors or their closest<br>
vicinity.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the effector units may<br>
comprise structures, features, fragments, molecules or the like that make pos-<br>
sible, cause directly or indirectly, an "amplification" of the therapeutic or other<br>
effect, of signal detection, of the binding of preselected substances, including<br>
biological material, molecules, ions, microbes or cells.<br>
Such "amplification" may, for example, be based on one or more of<br>
the following non-limiting types:<br>
- the binding, by the effector units, of other materials that can further bind<br>
other substances (for example, antibodies, fluorescent antibodies, other "la-<br>
belled" substances, substances such as avidin, preferably so that several<br>
molecules or "units" of the further materials can be bound per each effector<br>
unit;<br>
- the effector units comprise more than one entity capable of binding e.g. a<br>
protein, thus making direct amplification possible;<br>
- amplification in more than one steps.<br>
Preferred effector units according to the present invention may be<br>
selected from the follwing group:<br>
_ cytostatic or cytotoxic agents<br>
_ apoptosis causing or enhancing agents<br>
_ enzymes or enzyme inhibitors<br>
_ antimetabolites<br>
_ agents capable of disturbing membrane functions<br>
_ radioactive or paramagnetic substances<br>
._ substances comprising one or more metal ions<br>
- substances comprising boron, gadolinium, litium<br>
- substances suitable for neutron capture therapy<br>
- labelled substances<br>
- intercalators and substances comprising them<br>
- oxidants or reducing agents<br>
- nucleotides and their analogues<br>
- metal chelates or chelating agents.<br>
In a highly preferred embodiment of the invention, the effector unit<br>
comprises alpha emittors.<br>
In further preferred embodiments of the invention, the effector units<br>
may comprise copper chelates such as frans-bis(salicylaldoximaro) copper(ll)<br>
and its analogues, or platinum compounds such cisplatin, carboplatin.<br>
Different types of structures, substances and groups ar known that<br>
can be used to cause or enhance e.g., intemalization into cells, including for<br>
example RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK; Penetratin (Prochiantz, 1996), as well as<br>
stearyl derivatives (Promega Notes Magazine, 2000).<br>
As an apoptosis-inducing structure, for example, the peptide se-<br>
quence KLAKLAK that interacts with mitochondria! membranes inside cells,<br>
can be included Ellerby et al. (1999).<br>
For use in embodiments of the present invention that include cell<br>
sorting and any related applications, the targeting units and agents of the in-<br>
vention can, for example, be used<br>
a) coupled or connected to magnetic particles,<br>
b) adsorbed, coupled, linked or connected to plastic, glass or other solid, po-<br>
rous, fibrous material-type or other surface(s) and the like,<br>
c) adsorbed, covalently bonded or otherwise linked, coupled or connected into<br>
or onto one or more substance(s) or material(s) that can be used in columns<br>
and related systems<br>
d) adsorbed, covalently bonded or otherwise linked, coupled or connected into<br>
or onto one or more substance(s) or material(s) that can be precipitated, centri-<br>
fuged or otherwise separated or removed.<br>

1. for linking units comprising amino groups: cyclic anhydrides, dicarboxylic or<br>
multivalent, optinally activated or derivatized, carboxylic acids, compounds<br>
with two or more reactive halogens or compounds with at least one reactive<br>
halogen atom and at least one carboxyl group;<br>
2. for linking units comprising carboxyl groups or derivatives thereof: com-<br>
pounds with at least two similar or different groups such as amino, substi-<br>
tuted amino, hydroxyl, -NHNH2 or substituted forms thereof, other known<br>
groups for the purpose (activators may be used);<br>
3. for linking an amino group and a carboxyl group: for example amino acids<br>
and their activated or protected forms or derivatives;<br>
4. for linking a formyl group or a keto group to another group are: a compound<br>
comprising e.g. at least one -N-NH2 or-0-NH2 or =N-NH2 or their like;<br>
5. for linking several amino-comprising units: polycarboxylic substances such<br>
as EDTA, DTPA and polycarboxylic acids, anhydrides, esters and acyl<br>
halides;<br>
6. for linking a substance comprising an amino group to a substance<br>
comprising either a formyl group or a carboxyl group: hydrazinocarboxylic<br>
acids or their like, preferably so that the hydrazino moiety or the carboxyl<br>
group is protected or activated, such as 4-(FMOC-hydrazino)benzoic acid;<br>
7, for linking an organic structure to a metal ion: substances that can be<br>
coupled to the organic structure (e.g. by virtue of their COOH groups or<br>
their NH2 groups) or that are integral parts of it, and that in addition<br>
comprise a polycarboxylic part for example an EDTA- or DTPA-like<br>
structure, peptides comprising several histidines or their like, peptides<br>
comprising several cysteines or other moieties comprising an -SH group<br>
each, and other chelating agents that comprise functional groups that can<br>
be used to link them to the organic structure.<br>
A large variety of the above substances and other types of suitable<br>
linking agents are known in the art.<br>
A large number of suitable solubility modifier units are known in the<br>
art. Suitable solubility modifier units comprise, for example:<br>
- for increasing aqeous solubility: molecules comprising SO3, O-SO3 COOH,<br>
COO", NH2, NH3+, OH groups, guanidino or amidino groups or other ionic and<br>
ionizable groups and sugar-type structures;<br>
- for increasing fat solubility or solubility in organic solvents: units comprising<br>
(long) aliphatic branched or non-branched alkyl and alkenyl groups, cyclic non-<br>
aromatic groups such as the cyclohexyl group, aromatic rings and steroidal<br>
structures.<br>
A large number of units known in the art can be used as stabilizer<br>
units, e.g. bulky structures (such as tert-butyl groups, naphthyl and adamantyl<br>
and related radicals etc.) for increasing steric hindrance, and D-amino acids<br>
and other unnatural amino acids (including b-amino acids, w-amino acids,<br>
amino acids with very large side chains etc.) for preventing or hindering enzymatic<br>
hydrolysis.<br>
Units comprising positive, negative or both types of charges can be<br>
used as charge modifier units, as can also structures that are converted or can<br>
be converted into units with positive, negative or both types of charges.<br>
Spacer units may be very important, and the need to use such units<br>
depends on the other components of the structure (e.g. the type of biologically<br>
active agents used, and their mechanisms of action) and the synthetic procedures<br>
used<br>
Suitable spacer units may include for example long aliphatic chains<br>
or sugar-type structures (to avoid too high lipophilicity), or large rings. Suitable<br>
compounds are available in the art. One preferred group of spacer units are co-<br>
amino acids with long chains. Such compounds can also be used (simultaneously)<br>
as linker units between an amino-comprising unit and a carboxyl-<br>
comprising unit. Many such compounds are commercially available, both as<br>
such and in the forms of various protected derivatives.<br>
Units that are susceptible to hydrolysis (either spontaneous chemical<br>
hydrolysis or enzymatic hydrolysis by the body"s own enzymes or enzymes<br>
administered to the patient) may be very advantageous in cases where<br>
it is desired that the effector units are liberated from the targeting agents e.g.<br>
for internalization, intra- or extracellularl DNA or receptor binding. Suitable<br>
units for this purpose include, for example, structures comprising one or more<br>
ester or acetal functionality, Various proteases may be used for the purposes<br>
mentioned. Many groups used for making pro-drugs may be suitable for the<br>
purpose of increasing or causing hydrolysis, lytic reactions or other decomposition<br>
processes.<br>
The effector units, the targeting units and the optional units according<br>
to the present invention may simultaneously serve more than one function.<br>
Thus, for example, a targeting unit may simultaneously be an effector unit or<br>
comprise several effector units; a spacer unit may simultaneously be a linker<br>
unit or a charge modifier unit or both; a stabilizer unit may be an effector unit<br>
with properties different from those of another effector unit, and so on.An effector<br>
unit may, for example, have several similar or even completely different<br>
functions.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the tumor targeting<br>
agents comprise more than one different effector units. In that case, the effector<br>
units may be, for example, diagnostic and therapeutic units. Thus, for example,<br>
it is preferred to use, for boron neutron capture therapy, such agents<br>
whose effector units, in addition to comprising boron atoms, also can be detected<br>
or quantified in the patient in vivo after administration of the agent, in<br>
order to be able to ascertain that the agent has accumulated adequately in the<br>
tumor to be treated, or to optimize the timing of the neutron treatment, and so<br>
on. This goal may be achieved e.g. by using such a targeting agents according<br>
to the invention that comprise an effector unit comprising boron atoms (preferably<br>
isotope-enriched boron) and groups detectable e.g. by NMRI. Likewise,<br>
the presence of more than one type of therapeutically useful effector units may<br>
also be preferred. In addition, the targeting units and targeting agents may, if<br>
desired, be used in combination with one or more "classical" or other tumor<br>
therapeutic modalities such as surgery, chemotherapy, other targeting modalities,<br>
radiotherapy, immunotherapy etc.<br>
PREPARATION OF TARGETING UNITS AND AGENTS ACCORDING TO<br>
THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The targeting units according to the present invention are preferably<br>
synthetic peptides. Peptides can be synthesized by a large variety of well-<br>
known techniques, such as solid-phase methods (FMOC-, BOC-, and other<br>
protection schemes, various resin types), solution methods (FMOC, BOC and<br>
other variants) and combinations of these. Even automated apparatuses/devices<br>
for the purpose are available commercially, as are also routine<br>
synthesis and purification services. All of these approaches are very well<br>
known to those skilled in the art. Some methods and materials are described,<br>
for example, in the following references:<br>
Bachem AG, SASRIN™ (1999), The BACHEM Practise of SPPS<br>
(2000), Bachem 2001 catalogue (2001), Novabiochem 2000 Catalog (2000),<br>
Peptide and Peptidomimetic Synthesis (2000) and The Combinatorial Chemistry<br>
Catalog &amp; Solid Phase Organic Chemistry (SPOC ) Handbook 98/99. Peptide<br>
synthesis is exemplified also in the Examples.<br>
As known in the art, it is often advisable, important and/or<br>
necessary to use one or more protecting groups, a large variety of which are<br>
known in the art, such as FMOC, BOC, and trityl groups and other protecting<br>
groups mentioned in the Examples. Protecting groups are often used for<br>
protecting amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, guanyl and -SH groups, and for any<br>
reactive groups/functions.<br>
As those skilled in the art well know, activation often involves<br>
carboxyl function activation and/or activation of amino groups.<br>
Protection may also be orthogonal and/or semi/quasi/pseudo-<br>
orthogonal. Protecting and activating groups, substances and their uses are<br>
exemplified in the Examples and are described in the references cited herein,<br>
and are also described in a large number of books and other sources of<br>
information commonly known in the art (e.g. Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis, 1999).<br>
Resins for solid-phase synthesis are also well known in the art, and<br>
are described in the Examples and in the above-cited references.<br>
Cyclic structures according to the present invention may be synthesized,<br>
for example, by methods based on the use of orthogonally protected<br>
amino acids. Thus, for example, one amino acid containing an orthogonally<br>
protected "extra" COOH function (e.g the (-allyl ester of<br>
N-(-FMOC-L-glutamic-acid, i.e., "FMOC-Glu-Oall"), or the (-tert-butyl ester of<br>
N-(-FMOC-L-glutamic acid (TMOC-Glu-OtBu), or the<br>
(-4{N-t1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)-3-methylbutyl]-amino}benzyl<br>
ester of N-(-FMOC-L-glutamic acid ("FMOC-Glu-Odmab") or the<br>
(-2-phenylisopropyl ester of N~(-FMOC-L-glutamic acid<br>
("FMOC-Glu(O-2-PhiPr)-OH"), or related derivatives of other dicarboxylic<br>
amino acids, such as aspartic acid; or resin-bound forms of any of the afore-<br>
mentioned), and one amino acid with an orthogonally protected "extra" amino<br>
group (e.g N-(-FMOC-N-(-4-methyltrityl-L-lysine ("FMOC-Lys(Mtt)-OH") or the<br>
corresponding derivative of ornithine or some other diaminocarboxylic acid or a<br>
resin-bound form of one of these; resin-bound forms, however, not simultane-<br>
ously with resin-bound forms of the orthogonally protected amino acids with<br>
"extra" COOH), may be incorporated in the structure and, after deprotection,<br>
the carboxyl and amino groups may be reacted, usually using activator(s). This<br>
type of methodology is well known and is described, for example, in the following<br>
references Novabiochem Catalog (2000), pp. 19-21 and 33 and specifically<br>
B9-B15, and in the references therein, Bachem 2001 catalogue (2001), pp.<br>
31-32, Chan et ai. (1995), Yue et al. (1993) and Hirschmann et al. (1998).<br>
Suitable starting materials are available commercially, and further<br>
ones can be made by methods known in the art. D-amino acid derivatives can<br>
also be used in this methodology. Instead of "truly" orthogonal protective<br>
groups, also quasiorthogonal/semi-orthogonal/pseudoorthogonal protecting<br>
groups can be employed, as those skilled in the art understand.<br>
Cyclic products made according to the above described methods<br>
are usually especially stable in biological milieu, and are thus preferred. This<br>
type of structures may be produced by any of the methods for the production<br>
of such structures (chemical, enzymatic or biological). Many such methods are<br>
well known for those skilled in the art. Cyclic structures of this type can be<br>
syntesized chemically with the aid of solid-phase synthesis but they can likewise<br>
be synthesized using solution methods or a combination of both, as those<br>
skilled in the art well know. Amino acids with an "extra" carboxyl or amino func-<br>
tion suitable for cyclization purposes (when adequately protected) include (as<br>
non-limiting possibilities), for example, those with the structures shown below:<br>
In solution cyclizations of any type, dilute solutions are normally advantageous,<br>
as is well known by those skilled in the art.<br>
The targeting units and agents according to the present invention<br>
may also be prepared as fusion proteins or by other suitable recombinant DNA<br>
methods known in the art. Such an approach for preparing the peptides according<br>
to the present invention is preferred especially when the effector units<br>
and/or other optional units are peptides or proteins. One example of a useful<br>
protein effector unit is glutathion-S-transferase (GTS).<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE TARGETING UNITS AND TARGETING AGENTS OF<br>
THIS INVENTION<br>
There are acknowledged problems related to peptides intended for<br>
diagnostic or therapeutic use. One of these problems stem from the length of<br>
the sequence; the longer it grows, the more difficult or even impossible the<br>
synthesis of the desired product becomes, especially if there are other<br>
synthetic problems such as the presence of difficult residues that require<br>
protection-deprotection and/or cause side reactions etc. The tendency to side-<br>
rections, and possible synthesis termination (that not only decreases the yield<br>
of the desired product if this is formed at all, but also gives rise to products with<br>
a wrong length of the peptide chain) and formation of serious amounts of<br>
harmful by-products is drastically increased by the presence in the desired<br>
sequence of any amino acid(s) that require(s) side-chain protection (e.g., basic<br>
side-chains such as those of lysine, histidine and tryptophan) and (of course)<br>
also deprotection. All of these problems also make, as those skilled in the art<br>
very well know, the purification of the desired peptides very much more difficult<br>
and may make production of adequately purified material impossible.<br>
As compared to known products that contain long and difficult-to-<br>
make sequences with problematic amino acid residues, the peptides of the<br>
present invention are clearly superior, as described in more detail below.<br>
Thus, the products and methods of the present invention and their<br>
use offer highly significant and very important advantages over the prior art.<br>
The targeting units of this invention can be synthesized easily and<br>
reliably. An advantage as compared to many prior art peptides is that the<br>
targeting units and motifs of this invention do not need to comprise the<br>
problematic basic amino acids lysine and histidine, nor tryptophan, all of which<br>
may cause serious side-reactions in peptide synthesis, and, due to which the<br>
yield of the desired product might be lowered radically or even be impossible<br>
to obtain in adequate amounts or with adequate quality.<br>
When present, histidine, lysine and tryptophan must be adequately<br>
protected using suitable protecting groups that remain intact during the<br>
synthesis prodecures. This may be very difficult and at least increases the<br>
costs and technical problems. Also costs are remarkably increased by the<br>
reagents and work-load and other costs of the deprotection steps and the<br>
costs per unit of desired product may be increased.<br>
Because of their smaller size and thus drastically less steps in the<br>
\ synthesis, the peptides of the present invention are much easier and cheaper<br>
to produce than targeting peptides of the prior art.<br>
As histidine is not needed in the products of the present invention,<br>
the risk of racemization of it is of no concern.<br>
It is a great advantage not only for the economic synthesis of the<br>
products of the present invention but also for the purification and analysis and<br>
quality control that any racemization of histidine is outside consideration. It<br>
also makes any administration to humans and animals safer and more<br>
straightforward.<br>
Because of their smaller size, the peptides of the present invention<br>
can also be purified much more reliably and easily and with much less labor<br>
and apparatus-time, and thus with clearly lower costs. Overall costs are thus<br>
drastically reduced and better products can be obtained and in greater<br>
amounts. Furthermore, the reliability of the purification is much better, giving<br>
less concern of toxic remainders and of fatal or otherwise serious side-effects<br>
in therapeutic and diagnostic applications.<br>
Shorter synthesis protocols with relatively few steps produce less<br>
impurities, making the peptides of the present invention highly advantageous.<br>
The risks of toxic and even fatal impurities, allergens etc. are dramatically<br>
lowered and, in addition, purification is easier.<br>
The analysis and thus the quality control of the products of the<br>
present invention is easier and less costly, than that of the longer and more<br>
"difficult" peptide sequences. This increases the reliability of the analyses and<br>
of quality control.<br>
As residues such as lysine are not present in the targeting unit,<br>
there is no the risk of the effector units being inadequately connected to such<br>
residues. This is a remarkable advantage.<br>
The effector unit can easily be linked to the peptides and peptidyl<br>
analogues and peptidomimetic substances of the present invention using<br>
(outside the targeting motif) for example protected lysine or ornithine as there<br>
is no risk of simultaneous reaction of any lysine residue in the targeting motif.<br>
For cyclization of the peptides of the present invention, protected<br>
lysine or ornithine can be used, as the targeting units do not contain such<br>
amino acids. This is an enormous advantage<br>
The lactam bridge is clearly superior to the commonly used<br>
disulphide bridge. This is due to a number of reasons, such as:<br>
1. Lactams are highly stable against reducing agents such as thiols<br>
that easily destroy disulphide bridges and can cause various undesired<br>
reactions, for example dimerization, polymerization and formation of disulphide<br>
bridges to other thiols;<br>
2. Lactams can be synthesized in a highly controlled fashion for<br>
example by using orthogonal protection;<br>
3. Lactams are more stable than disulphides in biological milieu.<br>
4. The purification of lactams is easier than with disulphides.<br>
5. Because of lack of reaction with macromolecules having SH-<br>
groups lactones probable are less prone to cause allergic reactions.<br>
In solid synthesis of targeting agents according to the present<br>
invention, the effector units and optional additional units may be linked to the<br>
targeting peptide when still connected to the resin without the risk that the<br>
removal of the protecting groups will cause destruction of additional unit.<br>
Similar advantage applies to solution syntheses.<br>
Another important advantage of the present invention and its products,<br>
methods and uses according to it is the highly selective and potent targeting<br>
of the products.<br>
As compared to targeted therapy using antibodies or antibody fragments,<br>
the products and methods of in the present invention are highly advantageous<br>
because of several reasons. Potential immunological and related risks<br>
are also obvious in the case of large biomolecules. Allergic reactions are of<br>
great concern with such products, in contrats to small synthetic molecules such<br>
as the targeting agents, units and motifs of the present invention.<br>
As compared to targeting antibodies or antibody fragments, the<br>
products and methods described in the present invention are highly advantageous<br>
because their structure can be easily modified if needed or desired.<br>
Specific amino acids such as histidine, tryptophan, tyrosine, threonine can be<br>
omitted if dersired, and very few functional groups are necessary. On the other<br>
hand, it is possible, without disturbing the targeting effect, to include various<br>
different structural units, to specific desired properties that are of special value<br>
in specific applications.<br>
USE OF TARGETING AGENTS ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The targeting units and targeting agents according to the present<br>
invention are useful in cancer diagnostics and therapy, as they selectively target<br>
to tumors in vivo, as shown in the examples. The effector unit may be chosen<br>
according to the desired effect, detection or therapy. The desired effect<br>
may also be achieved by including the effector in the targeting unit as such.<br>
For use in radiotherapy the targeting unit itself may be e.g., radioactively labelled.<br>
The present invention also relates to diagnostic compositions comprising<br>
an effective amount of at least one targeting agent according to the<br>
present invention. In addition to the targeting agent, a diagnostic composition<br>
according to the present invention may, optionally, comprise carriers, solvents,<br>
vehicles, suspending agents, labelling agents and other additives commonly<br>
used in diagnostic compositions. Such diagnostic compositions are useful in<br>
diagnosing tumors, tumor cells and metastasis.<br>
A diagnostic composition according to the present invention may be<br>
formulated as a liquid, gel or solid formulation, preferably as an aqueous liquid,<br>
containing a targeting agent according to the present invention in a concentra-<br>
tion ranging from about 0.00001 mg/l to 25 x 107 mg/l. The compositions may<br>
further comprise stabilizing agents, detergents, such as polysorbates and<br>
Tween, as well as other additives. The concentrations of these components<br>
may vary significantly depending on the formulation used. The diagnostic<br>
compositions may be used in vivo or in vitro.<br>
The present invention also includes the use of the targeting agents<br>
and targeting units for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions for the<br>
treatment of cancer.<br>
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one targeting agent<br>
according to the present invention. The pharmaceutical compositions may be<br>
used to treat, prevent or ameliorate cancerdiseases, by administering an<br>
therapeutically effective dose of the pharmaceutical composisiton comprising<br>
targeting agents or targeting units according to the present invention or therapeutically<br>
acceptable salts, esters or other derivatives thereof. The compositions<br>
may also include different combinations of targeting agents and targeting<br>
units together with labelling agents, imaging agents, drugs and other additives.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount of a targeting agent according to<br>
the present invention may vary depending on the formulation of the pharma-<br>
ceuticakl composition. Preferably, a composition according to the present invention<br>
may comprise a targeting agent in a concentration varying from about<br>
0.00001 mg/1 to 250 g/l, more preferably about 0,001 mg/\ to 50 g/l, most preferably<br>
0,01 mg/l to 20 g/l.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention is<br>
useful for administration of a targeting agent according to the present invention. <br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for peroral use, for intravenous or<br>
local injection, or infusion are particularly preferred. The pharmaceutical compositions<br>
may be used in vivo or ex vivo.<br>
The preparations may be lyophilized and reconstituted before ad-<br>
ministration or may be stored for example as a solution, solutions, suspen-<br>
sions, suspension-solutions etc. ready for administration or in any form or<br>
shape in general, including powders, concentrates, frozen liquids, and any<br>
other types. They may also consist of separate entities to be mixed and, pos-<br>
sibly, otherwise handled and/or treated etc. before use. Liquid formulations<br>
provide the advantage that they can be administered without reconstitution.<br>
The pH of the solution product is in the range of about 1 to about 12, prefera-<br>
bly close to physiological pH. The osmolality of the solution can be adjusted to<br>
a preferred value using for example sodium chloride and/or sugars, polyols<br>
and/or amino acids and/or similar components. The compositions may further<br>
comprise pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and/or stabilizers, such as<br>
albumin, sugars and various polyols, as well as any acceptable additives, or<br>
other active ingredients such as chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
The present invention also relates to methods for treating cancer,<br>
especially solid tumors by administering to a patient in need of such treatment<br>
a therapeutically efficient amount of a pharmaceutical composition according<br>
to the present invention.<br>
Therapeutic doses may be determined empirically by testing the<br>
targeting agents and targeting units in available in vitro or in vivo test systems.<br>
Examples of such tests are given in the examples. Suitable therpeutically ef-<br>
fective dosage may then be estimated from these experiments.<br>
For oral administration it is important that the targeting units and<br>
targeting agent are stable and adequately absorbed from the intestinal tract.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention<br>
may be administered systemically, non-systemically, locally or topically, par-<br>
enterally as well as non-parenterally, e.g. subcutaneously, intravenously, in-<br>
tramuscularly, perorally, intranasally, by pulmonary aerosol, by injection or in-<br>
fusion into a specific organ or region, buccaily, intracranically or intraperito-<br>
neally.<br>
Amounts and regimens for the administration of the tumor targeting<br>
agents according to the present invention can be determined readily by those<br>
with ordinary skill in the clinical art of treating cancer. Generally, the dosage<br>
will vary depending upon considerations such as: type of targeting agent em-<br>
ployed; age; health; medical conditions being treated; kind of concurrent<br>
treatment, if any, frequency of treatment and the nature of the effect desired;<br>
gender; duration of the symptoms; and, counterindications, if any, and other<br>
variables to be adjusted by the individual physician. Preferred doses for ad-<br>
ministration to human patients targeting targeting units or agents according to<br>
the present invention may vary from about 0.000001 ng to about 40 mg per kg<br>
of body weight as a bolus or repeatedly, e.g., as daily doses.<br>
The targeting units and targeting agents and pharmaceutical com-<br>
positions of the present invention may also be used as targeting devices for<br>
delivery of DNA or RNA or structural and functional analogues thereof, such as<br>
phosphorothioates, or peptide nucleic acids (PNA) into tumors and their metas-<br>
tases or to isolated cells and organs in vitro; i.e. as tools for gene therapy both<br>
in vivo and in vitro. In such cases the targeting agents or targeting units may<br>
be parts of viral capsids or envelopes, of liposomes or other "containers" of<br>
DNA/RNA or related substances, or may be directly coupled to the DNA/RNA<br>
or other molecules mentioned above.<br>
The present invention also includes kits and components for kits for<br>
diagnosing, detecting or analysing cancer or cancer cells in vivo and in vitro.<br>
Such kits comprise at least a targeting agent or targeting unit of this invention<br>
together with diagnostic entities enabling detection. The kit may comprise for<br>
example a targeting agent and/or a targeting unit coupled to a unit for detection<br>
by e.g. immunological methods, radiation or enzymatic methods or other<br>
methods known in the art.<br>
Further, the targeting units and agents of this invention as well as<br>
the targeting motifs and sequences can be used as lead compounds to design<br>
peptidomimetics for any of the purposes described above.<br>
Yet further, the targeting units and agents as well as the targeting<br>
motifs and sequences of the present invention, as such and/or as coupled to<br>
other materials, can be used for the isolation, purification and identification of<br>
the cells, molecules and related biological targets.<br>
The following non-limiting examples illustrate the invention further.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
A list of reagents used in the examples below and reagent suppliers<br>
is included after the last numbered example.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
SYNTHESIS OF TARGETING UNIT (PEPTIDE) LRS<br>
The functionally protected, resin bound targeting unit (protected<br>
peptide), comprising targeting motif LRS (leucyl arginyl serine), was synthesized<br>
by means of manual synthesis as described in Example 2 below,<br>
The following reagents were employed as starting materials (in this<br>
order):<br>
Fmoc-Ser(tBu) Resin<br>
Fmoc-L-Arg(Pbf)-OH<br>
Fmoc-L-Leu-OH<br>
After the last cycle of the coupling process, a small sample of the<br>
resin (comprising the still fully protected peptide) was subjected to the treatment<br>
described in Example 2 for Fmoc removal (steps 1-10 in that Example),<br>
after which the sample of peptide was cleaved from the resin by three hours"<br>
treatment with the cleavage mixture described in Example 2, and isolated as<br>
described in the same Example.<br>
Then, the product (LRS) was identified with the aid of its positive<br>
mode MALDI-TOF mass spectrum, in which the M+1 ion of LRS was clearly<br>
predominant.<br>
MALDI-TOF data (LRS):<br>
calculated molecular mass = 374.44<br>
observed signals:<br>
375.30 M+H<br>
397.22 M+Na<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR PEPTIDE SYNTHESIS: MANUAL SOLID<br>
PHASE SYNTHESES. MASS SPECTRAL MEASUREMENTS.<br>
All synthetic procedures were carried out in a sealable glass funnel<br>
equipped with a sintered glass filter disc of porosity grade between 2 and 4, a<br>
polypropene or phenolic plastic screw cap on top (for sealing), and two PTFE<br>
key stopcocks: one beneath the filter disc (for draining) and one at sloping an-<br>
gle on the shoulder of the screw-capped neck (for argon gas inlet).<br>
The funnel was loaded with the appropriate solid phase synthesis<br>
resin and solutions for each treatment, shaken powerfully with the aid of a<br>
"wrist movement" bottle shaker (Gallenkamp) for an appropriate period of time,<br>
followed by filtration effected with a moderate argon gas pressure.<br>
The general procedure of one cycle of synthesis (= the addition of<br>
one amino acid unit) was as follows:<br>
The appropriate Wang resin (Applied Biosystems), loaded with ap-<br>
proximately 1 mmol of Fmoc-peptide (= peptide whose amino-terminal amino<br>
group was protected with the 9-f!uorenylmethyloxycarbonyl group) consisting<br>
of two or more amino acid units, or with approximately 1 mmol of the appropri-<br>
ate Fmoc-amino acid (i.e., amino acid carrying the aforementioned protecting<br>
group; approximately 2g of resin, 0.5 mmol/g) was treated in the way described<br>
below, each treatment step comprising shaking for 2.5 minutes with 30 ml of<br>
the solution or solvent indicated and filtration if not mentioned otherwise.<br>
"DCM" means shaking with dichloromethane, and "DMF means<br>
shaking with A/,N-dimethylformamide (DMF may be replaced by NMP, i.e. N-<br>
methylpyrrolidinone).<br>
The steps of the treatment were:<br>
1. DCM, shaking for 10-20 min<br>
2. DMF<br>
3. 20% (by volume) piperidine in DMF for 5 min<br>
4. 20% (by volume) piperidine in DMF for 10 min<br>
5. to 7. DMF<br>

After the last treatment (18) argon gas was led through the resin for<br>
approximately 15 min and the resin was stored under argon (in the sealed re-<br>
action funnel if the synthesis was to continue with further units).<br>
Activation of the 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl-N-protected amino<br>
acid (Fmoc-amino acid) to be added to the amino acid or peptide chain on the<br>
resin was carried out, using the reagents listed below, in a separate vessel<br>
prior to treatment step no. 12. Thus, the Fmoc-amino acid (3 mmol) was dis-<br>
solved in approximately 10 ml of DMF, treated for 1 min with a solution of 3<br>
mmol of HBTU dissolved in 6 ml of a 0.5 M solution of HOBt in DMF, and then<br>
immediately treated with 3 ml of a 2.0 M DIPEA solution for 5 min.<br>
The activation reagents used for activation of the Fmoc-amino acid<br>
were as follows:<br>
HBTU= 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluoro-<br>
phosphate, CAS No. [94790-37-1], Applied Biosystems Cat. No. 401091, molecular<br>
weight: 379.3 g/mol<br>

Cat. No. 400934<br>
DIPEA = N.N-Diisopropylethylamine, 2.0 M solution in N-methylpyrrolidone,<br>
Applied Biosystems Cat. No. 401517<br>
The procedure described above was repeated in several cycles using<br>
the appropriate different Fmoc-amino acids, carrying suitable protecting<br>
group(s), to produce a resin-bound source of the appropriate peptide (i.e., a<br>
"resin-bound" peptide). The procedure provides also a practical way of connecting<br>
certain effector and/or spacer and/or linker units and so on, for instance biotin<br>
or the Fmoc-Ahx (= 6-(Fmoc-amino)-hexanoyl) moiety, to the resin-bound<br>
peptide.<br>
Cleavage from the resin was carried out using the following reagent<br>
mixture:<br>
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) 92.5 vol-%<br>
water 5.0 vol-%<br>
ethanedithiol 2.5 vol-%.<br>
After the removal of the protecting Fmoc group via steps 1. to 10.<br>
(as described in the general procedure above), the resin was treated with three<br>
portions of the above reagent mixture (each about 15 ml for 1 g of the resin),<br>
each for one hour. The treatments were carried out under argon atmosphere in<br>
the way described above. The TFA solutions obtained by filtration were then<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator and were recharged<br>
with argon. Some diethyl ether was added and the concentration repeated.<br>
The concentrated residue was allowed to precipitate overnight under<br>
argon in dietyl ether in a refrigerator. The supernatant ether was removed and<br>
the precipitate rinsed with diethyl ether. For mass spectrum (MALDI-TOF+) determination,<br>
a sample of the precipitate was dissolved in solvents adequate for<br>
the spectral method, followed by filtration and, as needeed, dilution of the filtered<br>
solution. Further purification was done using reversed phase high-<br>
performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods by means of a "Waters<br>
600" pump apparatus using a C-18 type column of particle size 10 micrometers<br>
and a linear eluent gradient whose composition was changed during 30<br>
minutes from 99.9% water/0.1% TFA to 99.9%,acetonitrile/0.1% TFA. The dimensions<br>
of the HPLC columns were 25 cm x 21.2 mm (Supelco cat. no.<br>
567212-U) and 15 cm x 10 mm (Supelco cat. no. 567208-U). Detection was<br>
based on absorbance at 218 nm and was carried out using a "Waters 2487"<br>
instrument.<br>
The cleavage mixture described above also simultaneously re-<br>
moved the following protecting groups: trityl (Trt) as used for cysteine -SH protection;<br>
2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf) as used for<br>
protection of side chain of arginine; the tert-butyl group (as an ester group on<br>
the carboxyl function; OtBu) as used for protection of the side-chain carboxyi<br>
group of glutamic acid and/or aspartic acid, and can normally be used also for<br>
removal of these protecting groups on analogous structures (thiol, guanyl, car-<br>
boxyl). It did not cause Fmoc removal.<br>
The cleavage procedure described above can be carried out also<br>
without the removal of the Fmoc group, to produce the amino terminal N-<br>
Fmoc-derivative of the peptide, or for a peptide linked to an effector unit (com-<br>
prising no Fmoc).<br>

GENERAL REMARKS ABOUT THE SPECTRA (CONCERNING POSITIVE<br>
ION MODE ONLY)<br>
In all cases the M+1 (i.e. the one proton adduct M+H+) signal with<br>
its typical fine structure based on isotope satellites was clearly predominant. In<br>
almost all cases, the M+1 signal pattern was accompanied by a similar but<br>
markedly weaker band of peaks at M+23 (Na+ adduct). In addition to the<br>
bands at M+1 and M+23, also bands at M+39 (K+ adduct) or M+56 (Fe+ adduct)<br>
could be observed in many cases.<br>
In case of substances with a low molecular mass, the "matrix signals"<br>
(signals due to the constituents of the matrix/ "the ionization environment")<br>
have been omitted (i.e., signals at 294 and 380 Da have been omitted).<br>
The calculated molecular mass values reported within synthesis examples<br>
correspond to the most abundant isotopes of each element, i.e., the<br>
"exact masses". The interpretations given for signals are only tentative.<br>

The resin (1 g) was swelled on CH2C12 (15 ml) and stirred for 20<br>
minutes. The solvent was removed by filtration and the resin was treated once<br>
with DMF (15 ml) for three minutes. After filtration, the resin-bound peptide (or<br>
targeting agent) was treated with iodine (5 molar equivalents) in DMF (10 ml)<br>
for 1 hour.<br>
The DMF-iodine solution was removed by filtration and the residue<br>
was washed three times with DMF (15 ml) and three times with CH2CI2 (15ml)<br>
for 3 minutes each time.<br>
In case that a "plain" peptide (without the Fmoc group) was to be<br>
prepared, the Fmoc group was removed and the peptide was released from<br>
the resin according to the general procedure described in Example 2 and purified<br>
by reversed phase HPLC. In the case of targeting agents comprising no<br>
Fmoc group, the product was released from the resin and purified analogously.<br>

IN THE SEQUENCE AT THE ENDS OF AN "INTERMEDIARY" SEQUENCE)<br>
The uncyclized, fully protected, resin-bound peptides were prepared<br>
manually by means of the general method described in Example 2 above.<br>
Prior to the cyclization, a selective, one-process, dismantling of the<br>
side-chain protecting groups of lysine and aspartic acid [the said groups were:<br>
4-methyltrityl on the iysine unit and 2-phenylisopropyl (ester) on the aspartic<br>
acid unit] was carried out with diluted TFA (4 % in dichloromethane). The cycli-<br>
zation involved a condensation between the side-chain carboxyl group of the<br>
aspartic acid unit and the 6-amino group (side-chain amino group) of the lysine<br>
unit. Activation was by a PyAOP/HOAt/DIPEA reagent mixture (for details and<br>
abbreviation explanation, see below) or, alternatively, by the<br>
HBTU/HOBt/DIPEA mixture described in Example 2. The equipment, common<br>
solvents, and practical techniques were similar to those described in Example<br>
2.<br>
The initially fully protected resin-bound peptide (0.3 mmol) was<br>
shaken under argon atmosphere at room temperature with different solutions<br>
(about 10 mL) for the periods of time indicated below, followed by filtration:<br>
1. dichloromethane, for 20 min.<br>
2. 4 % (by volume) trifuoroacetic acid in dichloromethane, for 15 min.<br>
3.0.2 M DIPEA in 1:10 mixture of NMP and dichloromethane, for 3 min.<br>
4. dichloromethane, for 3 min.<br>
5. dichloromethane, for 3 min.<br>
6. dichloromethane, for 3 min.<br>
7. DMF,for 3 min.<br>
8. activation, for 4 hours, according to the description below:<br>
A mixture of PyAOP and HOAt, or alternatively a mixture of HBTU<br>
and HOBt, 3 molecufar equivalents of both components with respect to the<br>
resin-bound peptide (thus, 0.9 mmol both) in DMF (7 mL), was shaken with the<br>
resin for 1 min without filtration, followed by addition of 6 molecular equivalents<br>
of 2 M DIPEA in NMP.<br>
After step 8 above, the procedures continued as described in Ex-<br>
ample 2, starting from step 13.<br>
The reagents for activation in this type of cyclization were:<br>

means of the general coupling methods described in Example 2 so that the<br>
sequence K-AhxDLRSK was continued first with one lysine unit (protected with<br>
one Fmoc-group on each of its two amino groups). Then, the procedure (lysine<br>
addition) was repeated using doubled amounts of coupling reagents and the<br>
doubly protected (Fmoc groups) lysine, in order to couple two more lysine<br>
units, one of them on the side-chain amino and one on the amino-terminal<br>

EXAMPLE 31<br>
IN VIVO TARGETING OF TUMORS IN MICE<br>
In this example in vivo targeting of the targeting units prepared in<br>
the previous examples is shown for three different types of primary tumors, fi-<br>
brosarcoma, melanoma and for melanoma metastases in lung. It is shown that<br>
the tested targeting units according to the present invention selectively target<br>
to primary tumors and to metastases in vivo but not to normal tissues or organs.<br>
CELL LINES AND TUMOR-BEARING MICE<br>
The following tumor cell lines were used to produce experimental<br>
tumors in mice:<br>
"ODC sarcoma cells", (OS), originally derived from tumors that were<br>
formed in nude mice to which had been administered NIH3T3 mouse fibro-<br>
blasts transformed by virtue of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) overexpression<br>
and have been described earlier (Auvinen et al., 1997);<br>
A human melanoma cell line C8161 (M) described by Welch et al.<br>
(1991).<br>
The cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco"s Modified Eagle"s Medium<br>
(DMEM; Bio-Whittaker) supplemented with 5-10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Bio-<br>
Whittaker), 1% L-glutamine (Bio-Whittaker) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin<br>
(Bio-Whittaker).<br>
EXPERIMENTAL TUMOR PRODUCTION<br>
For production of experimental tumors, the cells listed above (OS,<br>
KS and melanoma: 0.5 x 106 cells were injected subcutaneously into both<br>
flanks of nude mice of the strains Balb/c Ola Hsd-nude, NMRI/nu/nu or<br>
Athymic-nu (all mice of both strains were from Harlan Laboratories). Tumors<br>
were harvested when they had reached a weight of about 0.4 g.<br>
Metastases (mostly formed in the lungs) were produced by injection<br>
of melanoma cells i.v. into Balb/c Ola Hsd-nude mice. The mice were kept 4-6<br>
weeks, and then targeting experiments were performed.<br>
Tumor-bearing or metastase-bearing mice were anesthesized by<br>
administering 0.02 ml/g body weight Avertin [10 g 2,2,2-tribromoethanol<br>
(Fluka) in 10 ml 2-methyl-2-butanol (Sigma Aldrich)] intraperitoneally (i.p.).<br>
IN VIVO TARGETING AND DETECTION OF TARGETING<br>
For localization of the targeting peptides OS and melanoma tumor-<br>
bearing NMRI nude mice were anesthesized and 1 or 2 mg of biotinylated syn-<br>
thetic targeting peptide (prepared in Example 12) was injected i.v. 5-10 min af-<br>
ter the i.v. injections, the mice were perfused via the heart using a winged infu-<br>
sion 25G needle set (Terumo) with 50 ml DMEM. Then, their organs were dis-<br>
sected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tumors and control organs (liver, kidney,<br>
spleen, heart, brain) were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen.<br>
Biotinylated peptides (targeting agents) were detected on 10 mi-<br>
crometer cryosections using AB (avidin-biotin) -complex containing avidin, and<br>
biotinylated HRP (Vectastain ABC-kit, cat no. PK6100; Vector Laboratories)<br>
with diaminobenzidine (DAB substrate kit, cat no. 4100, Vector Laboratories).<br>
The results of the experiments are shown in Table 2<br>
EXAMPLE 32<br>
IN VIVO EFFECT OF TARGETING AGENT COMPRISING CYTOTOXIC EFFECTOR<br>
UNIT<br>
In this experiment the targeting agent, Dxrb-Aoa-DLRSK prepared<br>
in Example 24, comprising a cytotoxic effector unit, doxorubicin, linked by<br>
oxime ligation to the cyclic targeting unit DLRSK comprising the targeting motif<br>
LRS was used to demonstrate in vivo targeting and therapeutic effect on<br>
melanoma tumors.<br>
1 million C8161M/T1 melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously<br>
into flank of eight Athymic-nu mice and tumours were allowed to grow for one<br>
week. The mice were then divided into three groups those received the follow-<br>
ing treatments:<br>
- Group DMEM: two mice, DMEM only<br>
- Group Dox: two mice, 1,43 mg/kg doxorubicin dissolved in DMEM<br>
- Group pept + dox: four mice, 1,43 mg/kg Dxrb-Aoa-DLRSK (doxorubicin<br>
linked to targeting mofif LRS) dissolved in DMEM (dose equimolar to Group<br>
Dox)<br>
Treatments were administered i.v. twice a week (Tuesdays and Fridays),<br>
total of five doses were injected. Tumours were measured with a calliper<br>
in two perpendicular directions on each injection day and on the day the<br>
animals were sacrificed. Tumour volume was calculated by the formula for ellipsoid:<br>
Volume=(length x width2) x 0.5<br>
The result of the experiment is shown in Figure 1 and confirms that<br>
a targeting agent according to the present invention selectively targets to<br>
melanoma tumor in vivo and significantly increases the therapeutic effect of<br>
doxorubicin.<br>

The uncyclized, fully protected, resin-bound peptides are prepared<br>
manually by means of the general method described above.<br>
Prior to the cyclization, a selective, one-process, dismantling of particular<br>
protecting groups of ornithine and gutamic acid [the said groups are: 2-<br>
N-Fmoc on the ornithine unit and 5-(2-trimethylsilylethyl ester) on the glutamic<br>
acid unit] is carried out with tetrabutylammonium fluoride solution in DMF. The<br>
cyclization involves a condensation between the side-chain carboxyl group of<br>
the glutamic acid unit and the 2-amino group (N-terminal amino group) of the<br>
ornithine unit. Activation is by a PyAOP/DIPEA reagent mixture (for details and<br>
abbreviation explanation, see below) instead of the HBTU/HOBt/DIPEA mix-<br>
ture described in Example 2. The equipment, common solvents, and practical<br>
techniques are similar to those described in Example 2.<br>
This method can be modified for lysine (instead of ornithine) and<br>
aspartic (instead of glutamic) acid unitst by empoying respective derivatives of<br>
those amino acids.<br>
The initially fully protected resin-bound peptide (0.3 mmol) is shaken<br>
under argon atmosphere at room temperature with different solutions (about<br>
10 mL) for the periods of time indicated below, followed by filtration:<br>
1. Dichloromethane, for 20 min.<br>
2. 1 M tetrabutylammonium fluoride in DMF, for 20 min.<br>
3.-5. DMF, for 1 min (three treatments).<br>
6.-8. DCM, for 1 min (three treatments).<br>
9. DMF, for 1 min.<br>
10. 0.9 mmol of PyAOP (3 molecular equivalents with respect to the<br>
resin-bound peptide) in DMF (7 mL), is shaken with the resin for 1<br>
min without filtration.<br>
11. Addition of 6 molecular equivalents of 2 M DIPEA (thus, 1.8 mmol)<br>
in NMP, followed by shaking for 4 hours.<br>

general procedure for (manual) peptide synthesis (the steps after addition of<br>
activated amino acid).<br>

SYNTHESIS OF TARGETING UNIT AC-DLRSK-AHX, CYCLIC VIA SIDE<br>
CHAINS OF ASPARTIC ACID AND LYSINE<br>
The preparation of Ac-DLRSK-Ahx was executed by manual solid<br>
phase peptide synthesis technique that is described in details in Example 2.<br>
The binding of the first structural component (moiety), 6-amino-<br>
hexanoic acid (= Ahx) whose amino function was protected by 9-fluorenyl-<br>
methyloxycarbonyl group (= Fmoc group), to a hydroxyl-functionalized peptide<br>
synthesis resin was carried out by means of dichlorobenzoyl chloride method<br>
(the "equivalents" below are molecular or "mol" amounts relative to the loading<br>
capacity of the resin):<br>
The unloaded ("empty") resin was first washed by shaking with<br>
N.N-dimethylformamide (= DMF) for 20 min and filtered. After addition of five<br>
equivalents of the Fmoc-protected 6-aminohexanoic acid (Fmoc-Ahx-OH) in<br>
DMF (0.2 M solution) and eight equivalents of pyridine onto the resin it was<br>
shaked for 3 min. Next, five equivalents of 2,6-dichlorobenzoylchloride was<br>
added and the mixture was shaken for 18 h (overnight).<br>
After the lengthy treatment the resin was filtered and washed several<br>
times with DMF and dichloromethane in the way described in Example 2<br>
(steps 13 -18). Next, the resin was shaken for 2 hours with a mixture of acetic<br>
anhydride (2M solution, 94 equivalents) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine<br>
(DIPEA, 1.6M solution, 80 equivalents) in /V-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) solution,<br>
filtered and washed like earlier ending up in drying at argon gas flow.<br>

The still resin-bound product was next cyclized according to Example<br>
17. Finally the sequence was continued with acetic acid (I.e. end-capped at<br>
amino terminal) as follows: Amino protecting Fmoc-group was removed as de-<br>
scribed in Example 2 (steps 1-10). Then the still resin-bound product was<br>
treated with the mixture of acetic anhydride and DIPEA in NMP like was done<br>
after the initial binding of Ahx moiety to the resin. In the end the product was<br>
released from the resin and purified as described in Example 2. Identification<br>
was based on M+1 ion of MALDI mass spectrum.<br>
