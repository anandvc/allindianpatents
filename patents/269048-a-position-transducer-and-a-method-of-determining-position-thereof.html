opening from which the light exits the fiber to be reflected by some type of mirror. This presents a weaioiess, since the mirror can be displaced In relation to the fiber, leading to the need to mechanically align the light beam as well as problems related to the cleanliness of the optical surfaces (tip of the filler and mirror). Moreover, if dealing with transducers that must be located at the end of the fiber, serial multiplexing is not possible.<br>
The high sensitivity to angular misalignment of the fiber optic line in relation to the surface is one disadvantage of transducers based on light intensity that require a visually homogeneous target surface, with reduced result precision when the surface is less reflective.<br>
Magnetostriction, that occurs in the majority of cases with ferro-magnetic materials. Is a variation in the length of a segment subject to a magnetic field; the magnetostrlctlve material expands or contracts in response to changes in the strength of the magnetic field In the area where the segment is found. This effect is symmetrical in relation to the applied field, with distortions in only one direction, independent of the magnetic field signal.<br>
Some applications already exist that use these magnetostrlcHve materials (in the construction of devices for measuring magnetic field and torque for example) but up until now, there are few that are large enough to use as position sensors. Among these are found patents JP10253399-A and US6232769-BI, and those that are described in the articles, "Dynamic behavior of Terfenol-D", by Koshi Kondo; J. of Alloys and Compounds 258 (1997) 56-60; "On the calibration of position sensor based on magnetic delay lines" by E.Hristoforou, H.Chlriac, M.Neagu, V.Karayannis; Sensors and Actuators, A 59 (1997) 89-93; "A colly magnetostrictive delay line arrangement for sensing applications", by E.Hristoforou, D.Niarchos, H.Chiriac, M.Neagu; Sensors and Actuators A 91 (2001) 91 -94 and "New position sensor based on ultra acoustic standing waves in FeSIB amorphous wires", by H.Chiriac, C.S.Marinescu ; Sensors and Actuators 81 (2000) 174-175.  All the cited applications<br><br><br><br>
The prevailing technique uses electric induction as the functioning principle. The main advantage of this type of position transducer over the others is its highly resistant quality, since due to the absence of physical contact there is little wear on the sensor element. Its great advantage over the previous ones is its capacity to work under severe conditions with no changes in Its performance in humid environments and vibrations. However, they are susceptible to electromagnetic interferences.<br>
The most recent technology is based on fiber optics. There is not one, but several techniques which have in common the use of fiber optics as a light guide used for measurement. Among these techniques are those based on Bragg networks, which, until now, has not yet been applied to position transducers.<br>
A great advantage of fiber optic sensors and transducers, beyond its good performance and simplicity of construction, is the absence of electric signals next to the measurement point, which makes these sensors and transducers totally safe for applications in classified areas.<br>

DETAILED DESCRII^TION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A detailed explanation is given of a fiber optic position transducer with magnetostrictive material and Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors in flow control valves (choke), suitable for use in onshore and offshore installations of deep wells. The invention of course is not so limited and this description Is given by way of example only.<br>
The position transducer is resistant to high pressures and temperatures, with high sensitivity, simple construction, is compact, and uses Rber Bragg Grating Sensors (FBG) with a magnetostrictive material.<br>
The principle upon which the present invention is based has to do with the relative displacement between a magnetic field source and a segment of magnetostrictive material, which is connected to one or more Rber Bragg Grating Sensors. Changes in the relative position between a magnetic field source and a segment of magnetostrictive material causes changes in the size of this segment and, for this reason, in the sensor to which it is connected, which induces alterations in the wavelengths reflected by the Rber Bragg Grating Sensors. Once the spatial dependence of the magnetic field is known, the wavelengths reflected by the sensor are related to the displacement which has occurred.<br>
As the temperature is a factor that can cause alterations In \he wavelength of a Fiber Bragg Grating Sensor, the present invention is characterized by the use of at least two Rber Bragg Grating Sensors, to guarantee the necessary compensation for the effect of the temperature.<br><br>
The sensor can be made of a permanent magnet and/or by the application of a magnetic field (e.g. by using an electromagnet).<br>
Preferably, the Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors are made of the same optical fiber. This is advantageous due to its pure simplicity, allowing optical connection elements to be dispensed with, and due to the possibility of measuring other lengths throughout this same fiber.<br>
A graph of the basic configuration of the position transducer in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention is shown in HGURE 1. A magnetic or electromagnetic element, hereinafter called magnet 1, preferably made of NdFeB (Neodymium Iron Boron), and a supporting member 4, in the form of a rod, preferably of material Impermeable to magnetic fields, are supported and aligned so that they may suffer relative displacement only along the longitudinal axis defined for rod 4. A segment of magnetostrictive material 2 is fixed to the end of the rod 4, which may be made of, for example, a metal alloy of TbDyFe (Terbium, Dysprosium and Iron), such as TX, Terphenol-D or others. The magnet 1 and the end of the rod 4 are close enough to each other so that the relative displacements between them causes variations in the dimensions of the segment of magnetostrictive material 2, measurable by the reading system 6. Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors 3.1 and 3.2 have different wavelengths, equal respectively to Ai and A2, and in this embodiment are made of the same optiol fiber 5. In the basic configuration of the invention presented in FIGURE 1, only one of the Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors (3.2) is fixed to the segment of magnetostrictive material 2, It does not matter which of the sensors is fixed, it could be tiie first or second one. The method of fixation may be made, for example, using epoxy or cyanoacrylic glue, or by some other method that may be used to connect the sensors to segments whose distortions or temperature range you wish to measure. Only as an example, in RGURE 1, Sensor 3.2 is fixed to a segment of magnetostrictive material 2, while Sensor 3.1 Is free. This means that Sensor 3.1 will undergo alterations in its Ai wavelength, as a function of changes of temperature, while sensor 3.2, in addition to<br><br>
this type of alteration, will also have its A2 wavelength modified when suffering deformations following the expansion or contraction of the segment of magnetostrictive material 2 caused by changes in the magnetic field.<br>
Only as an example, in FIGURE 1, Sensor 3.2 is presented In the axial direction, aligned to the axis defined for rod 4. Since a magnetostrictive material undergoes changes in size in reaction to variations in the magnetic field in which it is immersed, keeping, however, its volume constant, sensor 3.2 (which Is fixed to the segment of magnetostrictive material 2), may be aligned in any direction.<br>
The Reading system 6 sends a beam of light through the optical fiber 5. When it reaches sensor 3.1, part of the Incident light is reflected In the Ai wavelength of sensor 3.1, while the remaining part of the light is transmitted, arriving at sensor 3.2, When the light falls on sensor 3.2, the same process occurs: part of the incident light is reflected In the A2 wavelength of sensor 3.2, and the remaining part of the light is transmitted, following along the optical fiber 5. The light reflected by each of the sensors (3.1 and 3.2) is recaptured by the reading system 6, where it is analyzed.<br>
One possible configuration for the reading system 6 contains a broadband light source, a coupler and an analysis and detection system. As an alternative, the position transducer in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention may operate connected to any applicable configuration for the interrogation of Rber Bragg Grating Sensors.<br>
When a displacement between the magnet 1 and the rod 4 occurs, the reading system 6 will measure a different reading of A2-<br>
If there is a variation in temperature in the area of sensors 3.1 and 3.2, the reading system 6 will measure different readings of both Ai and A2. The device in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention Is pre-calibrated by temperature, that is, curves that give information on variations of Ai and A2 with<br><br>
the temperature are previously known. In this basic configuration of the present invention, pre-callbratlon is carried out at Sensor 3.2, which is fixed to the segment of magnetostrictive material 2, In such a way that the temperature calibration curve for Sensor 3.2 will already take into account the effect of thermal distortion on the segment of magnetostrictive material 2. Since there will iDe no practical temperature gradient in the short distance between Sensors 3,1 and 3.2, when equation (I) is applied successively to sensors 3.1 and 3.2, it allows temperature compensation and the identification of the change of the A2 portion which is exclusively due to the effect the magnetic field has on the segment of magnetostrictive material 2.<br>
The values that the A2 wavelengtii takes on as a function of the relative position of rod 4 to magnet 1, with the possible effect of temperature already deducted, provide a calibration curve of the position of the device in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention, in the basic configuration shown in HGURE 1.<br>
The graph of FIGURE 7 is an example of a calibration cur/e, built from an application of the basic configuration of the present invention, using a solid magnet 1. Point zero of the position mark is when magnet 1 is placed next to the segment of magnetostrictive material 2. This element generates a magnetic field such as the one presented, as a function of the axial distance, as shown in the graph of HGURE 8. Since In this application the field decays along the axial length, the increase In the relative distance between the rod 4 and the magnet 1 causes a reduction in the size of the segment of magnetostrictive material 2 in the a)dal direction. If the temperature remains constant, and Sensor-3.2 stays aligned in the axial direction, as exemplified in HGURE I's drawing, a reduction in the value of A2 will occur. This is what is shown in the curve of HGURE 7, including compensation of the previously described temperature.<br>
In the case of all three variants of the basic configuration of the present invention described below, the passage of the light Is the same as previously<br><br>
described for the basic configuration of the invention: part of the light emitted by the reading system 6 is reflected by Sensors 3.1 and 3.2 in their respective wavelengths, Ai and A2, and then returns to the reading system 6, where it is analyzed.<br>
In the first variant of the basic configuration of the present invention, shown in FIGURE 2, the only difference between it and the basic configuration shown In RGURE I is that the two Rber Bragg Grating Sensors, 3.1 and 3.2 are each fixed upon the same segment of magnetostrictlve material 2. In tiiis configuration (RGURE 2), sensors 3.1 and 3.2 are aligned in different directions. They should not be parallel. In this way, when a relative displacement occurs between the magnet 1 and the rod 4, both sensors 3.1 and 3.2 will suffer different deformations due to the magnetic effects on the segment of magnetostrictive material 2. Each of the Sensors, 3.1 and 3.2, will be influenced by size alterations in tiie segment of magnetostrictive material 2 in the direction in which the Sensor, fc)e it 3.1 or 3.2, is aligned. In this way, in the variant shown in RGURE 2, when a displacement between the magnet 1 and the rod 4 occurs, the reading system 6 will measure different readings for Ai and A2, respectively. Where there is a temperature variation in the region of the Sensors, the reading system 6 will also measure a range of readings from Ai and A2, but this range does not follow the same pattern of variation due to the relative change of position between the magnetl and the rod 4.<br>
The distinct distortions caused by the magnetic effect on sensors 3.1 and 3.2 are related by the constant volume of the magnetostrictive material segment 2. As described above, the device is pre-calibrated by temperature. In this first variant (RGURE 2) of the basic configuration of the present invention, pre-calibration is carried out at Sensors 3.1 and 3,2, which are fixed to the segment .of magnetostrictive material 2, in such a way that the respective temperature calibration curve for these Sensors will already take into account the effect of thermal distortion on the segment of magnetostrictlve material 2. With the wavelength values reflected by Sensors 3.1 and 3,2, and the Information regarding the distortion suffered by each sensor, the same equation (I) is applied for each of<br><br>
the sensors, carrying out the same process for compensation of the effects of temperature for the basic configuration of the present invention. Since wavelengths Ai and A2 are linl<ed in function with the volume of magnetostrictive material segment it does not matter whether ai or a2 is used to construct a calibration curve for position device. wavelength values chosen be they assuming rod relative magnet possible effects temperature already deducted will provide device accordance an example embodiment present invention first variant shown rgure></ed>
A second variant of the basic configuration of device in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention is presented in RGURE 3. This variant may be seen as a result of connecting two equal modules in the basic configuration of the invention as diagramed in RGURE 1, except that instead of using only one segment of magnetostrictive material 2, in this variant in RGURE 3, two identical segments of magnetostrictive material, 2,1 and 2.2, are used, each one fixed to one of the ends of the rod 4. On each one of the segments of magnetostrictive material (2.1 and 2.2), a Fiber Bragg Grating Sensor (3.1 or 3.2) is fixed, respectively. In RGURE 3, Sensors 3.1 and 3.2 are presented as aligned in the same direction, parallel to the rod 4, only as an example of a method of easy alignment Sensors 3.1 and 3.2 may be oriented in other directions, and may be different from each other. leaking a more complex choice does not offer greater advantages. Magnet 1 is supported and positioned parallel with the rod 4, in such a way that relative displacements between both are allowed to occur in only one direction as determined by movement of the rod 4. In this configuration of the invention, segments of magnetostrictive material 2.1 and 2.2 will undergo different distortions in function of the different positions of each one In relation to the magnet 1. As one moves closer to the magnet, the other moves further away, and vice versa.<br>
Compared with the basic confiauration of the oresent invention, presented in<br><br>
RGURE I, and with the first variant, shown in HGURE 2, this variant, shown in RGURE 3, presents the advantage of allowing an extension of the dynamic range, as the reduction of the magnetic field's effect on the segment of magnetostrictive material 2.1, for example, due to a great distance between this segment 2.1 and magnet 1, may be compensated by the increase of the effect on the other segment of magnetostrictive material (2.2),<br>
This configuration of the present invention, shown in RGURE 3, also mal<es it possible to extend the dynamic range even more through connecting several modules lilce these. fiber bragg grating sensors witii different wavelengths are each fixed upon one of various segments magnetostrictive material spaced along rod as shown in drawing rgure alterations captured by reading system supply information on relative displacement between magnet and number be used distances them values their can calculated a function specific given application. calibration position for this set connected will described below detail.></es>
The device, in accordance witii tills example embodiment of the present invention, is pre-calibrated by temperature, as previously described. In this second variant of the basic configuration of the invention, the pre-calibration is carried out through the two sensors, 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, fixed upon the segments of magnetostrictive materials (2.1 and 2.2), so that the respective calibration curves of these temperature sensors have already talcen the effects of the thermal distortion of the respective segments of magnetostrictive material (2.1 and 2.2) into account. With the values of the reflected wavelengths from sensors 3.1 and 3.2, and the information referring to the deformations undergone by each sensor, equation (I) is applied to each one of the sensors. The procedure for calibrating the position for this second variant of the device will be described in detail below, together with the description of the third variant of the device in accordance with an example<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention,<br>
A third variant of the basic configuration of the device in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention is presented in RGURE 5. In this variant, the segments of magnetostrictive material 2.1 and 2.2, as well as the Rber Bragg Grating Sensors 3.1 and 3.2 are placed on the ends of the rod 4, in the same way as described previously regarding the second variant of the basic configuration of the present invention. In a similar way, the relative displacement between the magnet 1 and the rod 4 is allowed along the axis as defined by the rod 4. However, in this configuration of nGURE 4, the magnet 1, which may be In cylindrical format, for example, has a hole, preferably in the center, so that the rod 4 may pass through it. Compared with a configuration where the magnet 1 runs outside the rod 4, as in the diagram in RGURE 3, the configuration shown in HGURE 5 shows the advantage of providing greater proximity between the magnet 1 and the segments of magnetostrictive material (2.1 and 2.2), which intensifies the magnetic field, causing an increase in the dynamic range. Moreover, an analogous form has already been described in the second variant. This third variant of the basic configuration of the present invention, diagramed In RGURE 5 also makes it possible to extend the dynamic range even more through connecting several modules like these. RGURE 6 shows the diagram of the connection of modules like the third variant of the basic configuration of the invention. The relative calibration of the position for this set of various connected modules will be given by a sequence of calibration curves, each of which are constructed using a pair of consecutive sensors, covering, in this way, the entire length of the Rod. The construction of the calibration curve for the pair of sensors (3.1 and 3.2) will be described in detail below.<br>
In this third variant of the basic configuration of the invention, the pre-calibration is based on temperature and is carried out in the same manner as described previously for the second variant, through the two sensors, 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, fixed upon the segments of magnetostrictive materials (2.1 and 2.2), so that the respective calibration curves of these temperature sensors have already<br><br>
tal<en the effects thermal distortion of respective segments magnetostrictive material and into account with values reflected wavelengths from sensors informatioti referring to deformations undergone by each sensor equation is applied one tiie sensors.></en>
However, the more complex geometry of magnet 1 also translates into a magnetic field whose spatial dependency is more complex. FIGURE 9 shows a graph of the variation of the magnetic field with distance for an application of this third variant of the basic configuration in accordance to the present invention. In FIGURE 10, constructed with measurements obtained from the same application, it can be seen that there is not a one to one relationship between the wavelength of one of the sensors and the position of the rod 4 relative to the magnet 1- This problem can be solved by establishing a relationship between the difference (Ai - A2). in the wavelengths of the sensors (3.1 and 3.2), and the position. Then, an iterative process is carried out that alters the distance between Sensors 3.1 and 3,2, with the objective of maximizing the dynamic range of positions, keeping a one to one relationship between the difference of the wavelengths and the position. Taking into consideration this difference between the wavelengths of Sensors 3.1 and 3.2, there is still the advantage of compensation for the possible effect of the temperature. The graph in RGURE 11, constructed from the same application that formed the basis for the construction of RGURES 9 and 10, is an example relating the difference between the wavelengths of Sensors 3.1 and 3.2 and the position, in this third variant of the basic configuration in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention. A useful one-to-one relationship between position on Ai - A2 can be seen.<br>
In relation to the e)dsting position transducers, the invention presents innumerable advantages propitiated by optical fiber technology: Its great simplicity of construction, reduced size and weight, the possibility of making measurements in aggressive environments such as, for example, at high temperatures, and the<br><br>
possibility of taking remote readings, without needing electronic circuits at the point of measurement. Moreover, in contrast with transducers based on electrical induction, the present invention avoids the use of cables and electrical circuits dose to the place of measurement. However, In the same manner as those transducers, the present invention is capable of supplying measurements of great precision and trustworthiness, because, due to the absence of physical contact witii the magnetic field source, the sensing element does not wear out.<br>
The device, in accordance with example embodiments of the present invention, offers other advantages due to the use of existing optical fiber transducers: it can easily be multiplexed, it does not present problems with surfaces, whether they are clean or not or have a highly reflective quality, and since the light remains inside the fiber, there is no need to make a mechanical alignment<br>
A supporting member in the form of a rod (e.g. a cylindrical rod) has been disclosed and is preferred. However, any means for supporting the magnetostrictive material and allowing it to move relative to the magnet along a single axis can be<br>
used.<br>

This presents a weaioiess, since the mirror can be displaced In relation to the fiber, leading to the need to mechanically align the light beam as well as problems related to the cleanliness of the optical surfaces (tip of the filler and mirror). Moreover, if dealing with transducers that must be located at the end of the fiber, serial multiplexing is not possible.<br>
The high sensitivity to angular misalignment of the fiber optic line in relation to the surface is one disadvantage of transducers based on light intensity that require a visually homogeneous target surface, with reduced result precision when the surface is less reflective.<br>
Magnetostriction, that occurs in the majority of cases with ferro-magnetic materials. Is a variation in the length of a segment subject to a magnetic field; the magnetostrlctlve material expands or contracts in response to changes in the strength of the magnetic field In the area where the segment is found. This effect is symmetrical in relation to the applied field, with distortions in only one direction, independent of the magnetic field signal.<br>
Some applications already exist that use these magnetostrlcHve materials (in the construction of devices for measuring magnetic field and torque for example) but up until now, there are few that are large enough to use as position sensors. Among these are found patents JP10253399-A and US6232769-BI, and those that are described in the articles, "Dynamic behavior of Terfenol-D", by Koshi Kondo; J. of Alloys and Compounds 258 (1997) 56-60; "On the calibration of position sensor based on magnetic delay lines" by E.Hristoforou, H.Chlriac, M.Neagu, V.Karayannis; Sensors and Actuators, A 59 (1997) 89-93; "A colly magnetostrictive delay line arrangement for sensing applications", by E.Hristoforou, D.Niarchos, H.Chiriac, M.Neagu; Sensors and Actuators A 91 (2001) 91 -94 and "New position sensor based on ultra acoustic standing waves in FeSIB amorphous wires", by H.Chiriac, C.S.Marinescu ; Sensors and Actuators 81 (2000) 174-175.  All the cited applications<br><br><br><br>
The prevailing technique uses electric induction as the functioning principle. The main advantage of this type of position transducer over the others is its highly resistant quality, since due to the absence of physical contact there is little wear on the sensor element. Its great advantage over the previous ones is its capacity to work under severe conditions with no changes in Its performance in humid environments and vibrations. However, they are susceptible to electromagnetic interferences.<br>
The most recent technology is based on fiber optics. There is not one, but several techniques which have in common the use of fiber optics as a light guide used for measurement. Among these techniques are those based on Bragg networks, which, until now, has not yet been applied to position transducers.<br>
A great advantage of fiber optic sensors and transducers, beyond its good performance and simplicity of construction, is the absence of electric signals next to the measurement point, which makes these sensors and transducers totally safe for applications in classified areas.<br>

DETAILED DESCRII^TION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A detailed explanation is given of a fiber optic position transducer with magnetostrictive material and Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors in flow control valves (choke), suitable for use in onshore and offshore installations of deep wells. The invention of course is not so limited and this description Is given by way of example only.<br>
The position transducer is resistant to high pressures and temperatures, with high sensitivity, simple construction, is compact, and uses Rber Bragg Grating Sensors (FBG) with a magnetostrictive material.<br>
The principle upon which the present invention is based has to do with the relative displacement between a magnetic field source and a segment of magnetostrictive material, which is connected to one or more Rber Bragg Grating Sensors. Changes in the relative position between a magnetic field source and a segment of magnetostrictive material causes changes in the size of this segment and, for this reason, in the sensor to which it is connected, which induces alterations in the wavelengths reflected by the Rber Bragg Grating Sensors. Once the spatial dependence of the magnetic field is known, the wavelengths reflected by the sensor are related to the displacement which has occurred.<br>
As the temperature is a factor that can cause alterations In \he wavelength of a Fiber Bragg Grating Sensor, the present invention is characterized by the use of at least two Rber Bragg Grating Sensors, to guarantee the necessary compensation for the effect of the temperature.<br><br>
The sensor can be made of a permanent magnet and/or by the application of a magnetic field (e.g. by using an electromagnet).<br>
Preferably, the Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors are made of the same optical fiber. This is advantageous due to its pure simplicity, allowing optical connection elements to be dispensed with, and due to the possibility of measuring other lengths throughout this same fiber.<br>
A graph of the basic configuration of the position transducer in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention is shown in HGURE 1. A magnetic or electromagnetic element, hereinafter called magnet 1, preferably made of NdFeB (Neodymium Iron Boron), and a supporting member 4, in the form of a rod, preferably of material Impermeable to magnetic fields, are supported and aligned so that they may suffer relative displacement only along the longitudinal axis defined for rod 4. A segment of magnetostrictive material 2 is fixed to the end of the rod 4, which may be made of, for example, a metal alloy of TbDyFe (Terbium, Dysprosium and Iron), such as TX, Terphenol-D or others. The magnet 1 and the end of the rod 4 are close enough to each other so that the relative displacements between them causes variations in the dimensions of the segment of magnetostrictive material 2, measurable by the reading system 6. Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors 3.1 and 3.2 have different wavelengths, equal respectively to Ai and A2, and in this embodiment are made of the same optiol fiber 5. In the basic configuration of the invention presented in FIGURE 1, only one of the Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors (3.2) is fixed to the segment of magnetostrictive material 2, It does not matter which of the sensors is fixed, it could be tiie first or second one. The method of fixation may be made, for example, using epoxy or cyanoacrylic glue, or by some other method that may be used to connect the sensors to segments whose distortions or temperature range you wish to measure. Only as an example, in RGURE 1, Sensor 3.2 is fixed to a segment of magnetostrictive material 2, while Sensor 3.1 Is free. This means that Sensor 3.1 will undergo alterations in its Ai wavelength, as a function of changes of temperature, while sensor 3.2, in addition to<br><br>
this type of alteration, will also have its A2 wavelength modified when suffering deformations following the expansion or contraction of the segment of magnetostrictive material 2 caused by changes in the magnetic field.<br>
Only as an example, in FIGURE 1, Sensor 3.2 is presented In the axial direction, aligned to the axis defined for rod 4. Since a magnetostrictive material undergoes changes in size in reaction to variations in the magnetic field in which it is immersed, keeping, however, its volume constant, sensor 3.2 (which Is fixed to the segment of magnetostrictive material 2), may be aligned in any direction.<br>
The Reading system 6 sends a beam of light through the optical fiber 5. When it reaches sensor 3.1, part of the Incident light is reflected In the Ai wavelength of sensor 3.1, while the remaining part of the light is transmitted, arriving at sensor 3.2, When the light falls on sensor 3.2, the same process occurs: part of the incident light is reflected In the A2 wavelength of sensor 3.2, and the remaining part of the light is transmitted, following along the optical fiber 5. The light reflected by each of the sensors (3.1 and 3.2) is recaptured by the reading system 6, where it is analyzed.<br>
One possible configuration for the reading system 6 contains a broadband light source, a coupler and an analysis and detection system. As an alternative, the position transducer in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention may operate connected to any applicable configuration for the interrogation of Rber Bragg Grating Sensors.<br>
When a displacement between the magnet 1 and the rod 4 occurs, the reading system 6 will measure a different reading of A2-<br>
If there is a variation in temperature in the area of sensors 3.1 and 3.2, the reading system 6 will measure different readings of both Ai and A2. The device in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention Is pre-calibrated by temperature, that is, curves that give information on variations of Ai and A2 with<br><br>
the temperature are previously known. In this basic configuration of the present invention, pre-callbratlon is carried out at Sensor 3.2, which is fixed to the segment of magnetostrictive material 2, In such a way that the temperature calibration curve for Sensor 3.2 will already take into account the effect of thermal distortion on the segment of magnetostrictive material 2. Since there will iDe no practical temperature gradient in the short distance between Sensors 3,1 and 3.2, when equation (I) is applied successively to sensors 3.1 and 3.2, it allows temperature compensation and the identification of the change of the A2 portion which is exclusively due to the effect the magnetic field has on the segment of magnetostrictive material 2.<br>
The values that the A2 wavelengtii takes on as a function of the relative position of rod 4 to magnet 1, with the possible effect of temperature already deducted, provide a calibration curve of the position of the device in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention, in the basic configuration shown in HGURE 1.<br>
The graph of FIGURE 7 is an example of a calibration cur/e, built from an application of the basic configuration of the present invention, using a solid magnet 1. Point zero of the position mark is when magnet 1 is placed next to the segment of magnetostrictive material 2. This element generates a magnetic field such as the one presented, as a function of the axial distance, as shown in the graph of HGURE 8. Since In this application the field decays along the axial length, the increase In the relative distance between the rod 4 and the magnet 1 causes a reduction in the size of the segment of magnetostrictive material 2 in the a)dal direction. If the temperature remains constant, and Sensor-3.2 stays aligned in the axial direction, as exemplified in HGURE I's drawing, a reduction in the value of A2 will occur. This is what is shown in the curve of HGURE 7, including compensation of the previously described temperature.<br>
In the case of all three variants of the basic configuration of the present invention described below, the passage of the light Is the same as previously<br><br>
described for the basic configuration of the invention: part of the light emitted by the reading system 6 is reflected by Sensors 3.1 and 3.2 in their respective wavelengths, Ai and A2, and then returns to the reading system 6, where it is analyzed.<br>
In the first variant of the basic configuration of the present invention, shown in FIGURE 2, the only difference between it and the basic configuration shown In RGURE I is that the two Rber Bragg Grating Sensors, 3.1 and 3.2 are each fixed upon the same segment of magnetostrictlve material 2. In tiiis configuration (RGURE 2), sensors 3.1 and 3.2 are aligned in different directions. They should not be parallel. In this way, when a relative displacement occurs between the magnet 1 and the rod 4, both sensors 3.1 and 3.2 will suffer different deformations due to the magnetic effects on the segment of magnetostrictive material 2. Each of the Sensors, 3.1 and 3.2, will be influenced by size alterations in tiie segment of magnetostrictive material 2 in the direction in which the Sensor, fc)e it 3.1 or 3.2, is aligned. In this way, in the variant shown in RGURE 2, when a displacement between the magnet 1 and the rod 4 occurs, the reading system 6 will measure different readings for Ai and A2, respectively. Where there is a temperature variation in the region of the Sensors, the reading system 6 will also measure a range of readings from Ai and A2, but this range does not follow the same pattern of variation due to the relative change of position between the magnetl and the rod 4.<br>
The distinct distortions caused by the magnetic effect on sensors 3.1 and 3.2 are related by the constant volume of the magnetostrictive material segment 2. As described above, the device is pre-calibrated by temperature. In this first variant (RGURE 2) of the basic configuration of the present invention, pre-calibration is carried out at Sensors 3.1 and 3,2, which are fixed to the segment .of magnetostrictive material 2, in such a way that the respective temperature calibration curve for these Sensors will already take into account the effect of thermal distortion on the segment of magnetostrictlve material 2. With the wavelength values reflected by Sensors 3.1 and 3,2, and the Information regarding the distortion suffered by each sensor, the same equation (I) is applied for each of<br><br>
the sensors, carrying out the same process for compensation of the effects of temperature for the basic configuration of the present invention. Since wavelengths Ai and A2 are linl<ed in function with the volume of magnetostrictive material segment it does not matter whether ai or a2 is used to construct a calibration curve for position device. wavelength values chosen be they assuming rod relative magnet possible effects temperature already deducted will provide device accordance an example embodiment present invention first variant shown rgure></ed>
A second variant of the basic configuration of device in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention is presented in RGURE 3. This variant may be seen as a result of connecting two equal modules in the basic configuration of the invention as diagramed in RGURE 1, except that instead of using only one segment of magnetostrictive material 2, in this variant in RGURE 3, two identical segments of magnetostrictive material, 2,1 and 2.2, are used, each one fixed to one of the ends of the rod 4. On each one of the segments of magnetostrictive material (2.1 and 2.2), a Fiber Bragg Grating Sensor (3.1 or 3.2) is fixed, respectively. In RGURE 3, Sensors 3.1 and 3.2 are presented as aligned in the same direction, parallel to the rod 4, only as an example of a method of easy alignment Sensors 3.1 and 3.2 may be oriented in other directions, and may be different from each other. leaking a more complex choice does not offer greater advantages. Magnet 1 is supported and positioned parallel with the rod 4, in such a way that relative displacements between both are allowed to occur in only one direction as determined by movement of the rod 4. In this configuration of the invention, segments of magnetostrictive material 2.1 and 2.2 will undergo different distortions in function of the different positions of each one In relation to the magnet 1. As one moves closer to the magnet, the other moves further away, and vice versa.<br>
Compared with the basic confiauration of the oresent invention, presented in<br><br>
RGURE I, and with the first variant, shown in HGURE 2, this variant, shown in RGURE 3, presents the advantage of allowing an extension of the dynamic range, as the reduction of the magnetic field's effect on the segment of magnetostrictive material 2.1, for example, due to a great distance between this segment 2.1 and magnet 1, may be compensated by the increase of the effect on the other segment of magnetostrictive material (2.2),<br>
This configuration of the present invention, shown in RGURE 3, also mal<es it possible to extend the dynamic range even more through connecting several modules lilce these. fiber bragg grating sensors witii different wavelengths are each fixed upon one of various segments magnetostrictive material spaced along rod as shown in drawing rgure alterations captured by reading system supply information on relative displacement between magnet and number be used distances them values their can calculated a function specific given application. calibration position for this set connected will described below detail.></es>
The device, in accordance witii tills example embodiment of the present invention, is pre-calibrated by temperature, as previously described. In this second variant of the basic configuration of the invention, the pre-calibration is carried out through the two sensors, 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, fixed upon the segments of magnetostrictive materials (2.1 and 2.2), so that the respective calibration curves of these temperature sensors have already talcen the effects of the thermal distortion of the respective segments of magnetostrictive material (2.1 and 2.2) into account. With the values of the reflected wavelengths from sensors 3.1 and 3.2, and the information referring to the deformations undergone by each sensor, equation (I) is applied to each one of the sensors. The procedure for calibrating the position for this second variant of the device will be described in detail below, together with the description of the third variant of the device in accordance with an example<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention,<br>
A third variant of the basic configuration of the device in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention is presented in RGURE 5. In this variant, the segments of magnetostrictive material 2.1 and 2.2, as well as the Rber Bragg Grating Sensors 3.1 and 3.2 are placed on the ends of the rod 4, in the same way as described previously regarding the second variant of the basic configuration of the present invention. In a similar way, the relative displacement between the magnet 1 and the rod 4 is allowed along the axis as defined by the rod 4. However, in this configuration of nGURE 4, the magnet 1, which may be In cylindrical format, for example, has a hole, preferably in the center, so that the rod 4 may pass through it. Compared with a configuration where the magnet 1 runs outside the rod 4, as in the diagram in RGURE 3, the configuration shown in HGURE 5 shows the advantage of providing greater proximity between the magnet 1 and the segments of magnetostrictive material (2.1 and 2.2), which intensifies the magnetic field, causing an increase in the dynamic range. Moreover, an analogous form has already been described in the second variant. This third variant of the basic configuration of the present invention, diagramed In RGURE 5 also makes it possible to extend the dynamic range even more through connecting several modules like these. RGURE 6 shows the diagram of the connection of modules like the third variant of the basic configuration of the invention. The relative calibration of the position for this set of various connected modules will be given by a sequence of calibration curves, each of which are constructed using a pair of consecutive sensors, covering, in this way, the entire length of the Rod. The construction of the calibration curve for the pair of sensors (3.1 and 3.2) will be described in detail below.<br>
In this third variant of the basic configuration of the invention, the pre-calibration is based on temperature and is carried out in the same manner as described previously for the second variant, through the two sensors, 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, fixed upon the segments of magnetostrictive materials (2.1 and 2.2), so that the respective calibration curves of these temperature sensors have already<br><br>
tal<en the effects thermal distortion of respective segments magnetostrictive material and into account with values reflected wavelengths from sensors informatioti referring to deformations undergone by each sensor equation is applied one tiie sensors.></en>
However, the more complex geometry of magnet 1 also translates into a magnetic field whose spatial dependency is more complex. FIGURE 9 shows a graph of the variation of the magnetic field with distance for an application of this third variant of the basic configuration in accordance to the present invention. In FIGURE 10, constructed with measurements obtained from the same application, it can be seen that there is not a one to one relationship between the wavelength of one of the sensors and the position of the rod 4 relative to the magnet 1- This problem can be solved by establishing a relationship between the difference (Ai - A2). in the wavelengths of the sensors (3.1 and 3.2), and the position. Then, an iterative process is carried out that alters the distance between Sensors 3.1 and 3,2, with the objective of maximizing the dynamic range of positions, keeping a one to one relationship between the difference of the wavelengths and the position. Taking into consideration this difference between the wavelengths of Sensors 3.1 and 3.2, there is still the advantage of compensation for the possible effect of the temperature. The graph in RGURE 11, constructed from the same application that formed the basis for the construction of RGURES 9 and 10, is an example relating the difference between the wavelengths of Sensors 3.1 and 3.2 and the position, in this third variant of the basic configuration in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention. A useful one-to-one relationship between position on Ai - A2 can be seen.<br>
In relation to the e)dsting position transducers, the invention presents innumerable advantages propitiated by optical fiber technology: Its great simplicity of construction, reduced size and weight, the possibility of making measurements in aggressive environments such as, for example, at high temperatures, and the<br><br>
possibility of taking remote readings, without needing electronic circuits at the point of measurement. Moreover, in contrast with transducers based on electrical induction, the present invention avoids the use of cables and electrical circuits dose to the place of measurement. However, In the same manner as those transducers, the present invention is capable of supplying measurements of great precision and trustworthiness, because, due to the absence of physical contact witii the magnetic field source, the sensing element does not wear out.<br>
The device, in accordance with example embodiments of the present invention, offers other advantages due to the use of existing optical fiber transducers: it can easily be multiplexed, it does not present problems with surfaces, whether they are clean or not or have a highly reflective quality, and since the light remains inside the fiber, there is no need to make a mechanical alignment<br>
A supporting member in the form of a rod (e.g. a cylindrical rod) has been disclosed and is preferred. However, any means for supporting the magnetostrictive material and allowing it to move relative to the magnet along a single axis can be<br>
used.<br>
While the Invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, It is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiments, but on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</td>
