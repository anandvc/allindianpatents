				<td>The present invention relates to enantio enriched compound.<br>
The present invention relates to novel enantiomeric forms of phenyl-propargylether derivati¬ves of formula I below. It relates to the preparation of those enantiomeric substances and to agrochemical compositions comprising at least one of the compounds of formula I as active ingredient. The invention relates also to the preparation of the said compositions and to the use of the compounds or of the compositions in controlling or preventing the infestation of plants by phytopathogenic microorganisms, especially fungi.<br>
The invention relates to phenyl-propargylether derivatives of the general formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
including the optical isomers thereof and mixtures of such isomers, wherein<br>
R1 is hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl or optionally substituted aryl,<br>
R2 and R3 are each independently hydrogen or alkyl,<br>
R4 is alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl,<br>
R5, R6,R7, and R8 are each independently hydrogen or alkyl,<br>
R9 is hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl or optionally<br>
substituted alkynyl,<br>
R10 is optionally substituted aryl or optionally substituted heteroaryl, and<br>
Z is optionally substituted aryloxy, optionally substituted alkoxy, optionally substituted<br>
alkenyloxy or optionally substituted alkynyloxy<br>
The compounds of formula I is understood to encompass the pure enantiomer of the displa¬yed formula I as well as substantially enantio-enriched forms, as usually obtained from large scale synthesis processes. The asymmetrical carbon atom to which the enantiomeric form of present invention relates is the alpha-carbon atom in the carboxylic acid, forming the amide function in the compounds of formula I. This carbon atom is marked in formula I with the indication of the absolute configuration according to the Cahn-lngold-Prelog rules.  For example, where R9 is hydrogen, R10 is the optionally substituted phenyl moiety, and Z is any defined radical, the asymmetrically substituted carbon atom is in the (S)-configuration.<br><br><br>
The enantio-enriched forms according to present invention contain 70% or more of the pure enantiomer of formula I, while the difference to 100% of the compound of formula I is the mirror-image enantiomer. In contrast to present invention, the formerly known compounds of formula have been obtained in racemic forms, with in general comprised about equal amounts of the two enantiomer forms. In preferred embodiments of this invention the amount of the enantiomer in the compounds of formula I is above 80%, more preferred above 90%, especially above 95%, for example 97%, 98% or 99%.<br>
The presence of more asymmetrical carbon atoms in the compounds of formula I, in addition to the alpha-carbon atom of the carboxylic, means that the enantiomers of compounds of formula I can occur in stereoisomeric forms, i.e. as several diastereomers. As a result of the presence of a possible aliphatic C=C double bond, also geometric isomerism may also occur. Formula I is intended to include all those possible diastereomeric forms of the enantiomer of formula I, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Where the definition of formula I refers to optical isomers, for this document it shall be understood that the optical isomers are only those isomers which result from other possible asymmetrical elements in the molecule, if present, but not to the carbon atom in alpha-position of the amide functional group which is defined with its absolute configuration.<br>
In the above definition aryl includes aromatic hydrocarbon rings like phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl and biphenyl like 1,3-biphenyl and 1,4-biphenyl, with phenyl being preferred. The same definition applies where aryl is part of aryloxy or arylthio. Heteroaryl stands for aromatic ring systems comprising mono-, bi- or tricyclic systems wherein at least one oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom is present as a ring member. Examples are furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, tria-zinyl, tetrazinyl, indolyl, benzothiophenyl, benzofuranyl, benzimidazolyl, indazolyl, benzotria-zolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, phthalazinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinazolinyl, cinnolinyl and naphthyridinyl.<br>
The above aryl and heteroaryl groups may be optionally substituted. This means that they may carry one or more identical or different substituents. Normally not more than three substituents are present at the same time. Examples of substituents of aryl or heteroaryl groups are: alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkyl-alkyl, phenyl and phenyl-alkyl, it being possible in turn for all of the preceding groups to carry one or more identical or different halogen atoms; alkoxy; alkenyloxy; alkynyloxy; alkoxyalkyl; haloalkoxy, alkylthio;<br><br>
haloalkylthio; alkylsulfonyl; formyl; alkanoyl; hydroxy; halogen; cyano; nitro; amino; alkylami-no; dialkylamino; carboxyl; alkoxycarbonyl; alkenyloxycarbonyl; or alkynyloxycarbonyl.

In the above definitions "halogen" includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. The alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl radicals may be straight-chain or branched. This applies also to the alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl parts of other alkyl-, alkenyl- or alkynyl-containing groups. Depending upon the number of carbon atoms mentioned, alkyl on its own or as part of another substituent is to be understood as being, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl and the isomers thereof, for example isopropyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl or sec-butyl, isopentyl or tert-pentyl.<br><br>

Carboxy-activated derivatives of the acid of formula II are all compounds having an activted carboxyl group like an acid halide, such as an acid chloride, like symmetrical or mixed anhydrides, such as mixed anhydrides with O-alkylcarbonates, like activated esters, such as p-nitrophenylesters or N-hydroxysuccinimidesters, as well as in-situ-formed activated forms of the acid of formula II with condensating agents, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, carbo-nyldiimidazole, benzotriazol-1 -yloxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, O-benzotriazol-1 -yl-N,N,N',N'-bis(pentamethylene)uronium hexafluorophosphate, O-ben-zotriazol-1 -yl-N,N,N',N'-bis(tetramethylene)uronium hexafluorophosphate, O-benzotriazol-1 -yl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate or benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tripyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate.

Step D: A compound of formula VII wherein R4, R5l R6l R7 and R8 are as defined for formula I is alkylated with a compound of formula V (see Scheme 1) wherein RI, R2, Ra and Y are as defined for Scheme 1 under the same conditions as defined for step B in Scheme 1.<br>
Step E: A compound of formula VIII wherein R1f R2, R3, R4, RB, Re, Ry and R8 are as defined for formula I is dehydrated to an isocyanide of formula IX wherein RL R2, R3, R4, RB, Re, R/ and R8 are as defined for formula I under conditions known per se (D. Seebach, G. Adam, T. Gees, M. Schiess, W. Weigang, Chem. Ber. 1988, 121, 507).<br>
Step F: An isocyanide of formula IX wherein R,, R2, R3, R4, RS, Re, Ry and R8 are as defined for formula I is reacted in a three-component Passerini reaction (J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th ed., Wiley, 1992, p. 980) with an aldehyde or ketone of formula X, wherein R9 and R10 are as defined for formula I in the presence of a chiral carboxylic acid XI, typically an amino acid or a sugar acid like a glyconic acid or a glycuronic acid, preferably a glycuronic acid like 1,2,3,4-tetra-O-acetyl-cc-D-galacturonic acid or 1,2,3,4-tetra-O-acetyl-cc-D-glucuronic acid to give a O-acyl-cc-hydroxy amide of formula XII, wherein Ri, R2, R3, R4, RS, Re, Ry, Re, Rg and R10 are as defined for formula I. The reaction is advantageously performed in a solvent like aromatic, non-aromatic or halogenated hydrocarbons, such as chlorohydrocarbons e.g. dichloromethane or toluene; ketones e.g. acetone or 2-butanone; esters e.g. ethyl acetate; ethers e.g. diethylether, tert-butyl-methylether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran, amides e.g. dimethylformamide, nitriles e.g. acetonitrile, alcohols e.g. methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol or tert-butanol, sulfoxides e.g. dimethylsulfoxide or water. It is also possible to use mixtures of these solvents.<br>
Step G: The O-acyl-ct-hydroxy amide of formula XII wherein RL R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9&gt; R10 and RH are as defined above is hydrolyzed to a an a-hydroxy amide of formula XIII, wherein RL R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10 are as defined for formula I under classical conditions (J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th ed., Wiley, 1992).<br>
Step H: The a-hydroxy amide of formula XIII wherein R^ R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and Rio are as defined for formula I is reacted with a compound XIV wherein R12 is alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl and Y is a leaving group like a halide such as a chloride or bromide or a sulfonic ester such as a tosylate, mesylate or triflate to a compound of formula la wherein RL R2, R3, Ri, RS, Re, Ry, RS, Rg and Ri0 are as defined for formula I and Ri2 is alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl under the same conditions as defined for step B in Scheme 1.<br>
The compounds of formula I are oils or solids at room temperature and are distinguished by valuable microbiocidal properties. They can be used in the agricultural sector or related fields preventatively and curatively in the control of plant-destructive microorganisms. The compounds of formula I according to the invention are distinguished at low rates of concentration not only by outstanding microbiocidal, especially fungicidal, activity but also by being especially well tolerated by plants.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds of formula I have for practical purposes a very advantageous microbiocidal spectrum in the control of phytopathogenic microorganisms, especially fungi. They possess very advantageous curative and preventive properties and are used in the protection of numerous crop plants. With the compounds of formula I it is possible to inhibit or destroy phytopathogenic microorganisms that occur on various crops of useful plants or on parts of such plants (fruit, blossom, leaves, stems, tubers, roots), while parts of the plants which grow later also remain protected, for example, against phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
The novel compounds of formula I prove to be effective against specific genera of the fungus class Fungi imperfect! (e.g. Cercospora), Basidiomycetes (e.g. Puccinia) and Ascomycetes (e.g. Erysiphe and Venturia) and especially against Oomycetes (e.g. Plasmopara, Peronospora, Pythium and Phytophthora). They therefore represent in plant protection a valuable addition to the compositions for controlling phytopathogenic fungi. The compounds of formula I can also be used as dressings for protecting seed (fruit, tubers, grains) and plant cuttings from fungal infections and against phytopathogenic fungi that occur in the soil.<br>
The invention relates also to compositions comprising compounds of formula I as active ingredient, especially plant-protecting compositions, and to the use thereof in the agricultural sector or related fields.<br>
In addition, the present invention includes the preparation of those compositions, wherein the active ingredient is homogeneously mixed with one or more of the substances or groups of substances described herein. Also included is a method of treating plants which is distinguished by the application of the novel compounds of formula I or of the novel compositions.<br><br>
Target crops to be protected within the scope of this invention comprise, for example, the following species of plants: cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, maize, sorghum and related species); beet (sugar beet and fodder beet); pomes, stone fruit and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries); leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans); oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts); cucurbi-taceae (marrows, cucumbers, melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute); citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandarins); vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, paprika); lauraceae (avocado, cinnamon, camphor) and plants such as tobacco, nuts, coffee, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, and also ornamentals.<br>
The compounds of formula I are normally used in the form of compositions and can be applied to the area or plant to be treated simultaneously or in succession with other active ingredients. Those other active ingredients may be fertilisers, micronutrient donors or other preparations that influence plant growth. It is also possible to use selective herbicides or insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of several of those preparations, if desired together with further carriers, surfactants or other application-promoting adjuvants customarily employed in formulation technology.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be mixed with other fungicides, resulting in some cases in unexpected synergistic activities. Such mixtures are not limited to two active ingredients (one of formula I and one of the list of other fungicides), but to the contrary many comprise more than one active ingredient of the component of formula I and more than one other fungicide.

Suitable carriers and surfactants may be solid or liquid and correspond to the substances ordinarily employed in formulation technology, such as e.g. natural or regenerated mineral substances, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, tackifiers, thickeners, binders or fertilisers. Such carriers and additives are described, for example, in WO 95/30651.<br>
A preferred method of applying a compound of formula I, or an agrochemical composition comprising at least one of those compounds, is application to the foliage (foliar application), the frequency and the rate of application depending upon the risk of infestation by the pathogen in question. The compounds of formula I may also be applied to seed grains (coating) either by impregnating the grains with a liquid formulation of the active ingredient or by coating them with a solid formulation.<br>
The compounds of formula I are used in unmodified form or, preferably, together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in formulation technology, and are for that purpose advantageously formulated in known manner e.g. into emulsifiable concentrates, coatable pastes, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules, and by encapsulation in e.g. polymer substances. As with the nature of the compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, scattering, coating or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances.<br>
Advantageous rates of application are normally from 1 g to 2 kg of active ingredient (a.i.) per hectare (ha), preferably from 5 g to 1 kg a.i./ha, preferably from 25 g to 750 g a.i./ha, especially from 10 g to 500g a.i./ha, more preferably from 5 g to 500g a.i./ha. Most preferred is 5g to 250 g a.i./ha . When used as seed dressings, rates of from 0.001 g to 1.0 g of active ingredient per kg of seed are advantageously used.<br>
The formulations, i.e. the compositions, preparations or mixtures comprising the compound^) (active ingredient(s)) of formula I and, where appropriate, a solid or liquid adjuvant, are prepared in known manner, e.g. by homogeneously mixing and/or grinding the active ingredient with extenders, e.g. solvents, solid carriers and, where appropriate, surface-active compounds (surfactants).<br><br>
Further surfactants customarily used in formulation technology will be known to the person skilled in the art or can be found in the relevant technical literature.<br>
The agrochemical compositions usually comprise 0.01 to 99 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 95 % by weight, of a compound of formula I, 99.99 to 1 % by weight, preferably 99.9 to 5 % by weight, of a solid or liquid adjuvant, and 0 to 25 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 25 % by weight, of a surfactant.<br>
Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ dilute formulations.<br>
The compositions may also comprise further ingredients, such as stabilisers, antifoams, viscosity regulators, binders and tackifiers, as well as fertilisers or other active ingredients for obtaining special effects.<br>
