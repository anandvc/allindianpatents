Novel CIS-ImidazoIines<br>
The present invention relates to chiral cis-imidazolines which are small molecule inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction. p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that plays a central role in protection against development of cancer. It guards cellular integrity and prevents the propagation of permanently damaged clones of cells by the induction of growth arrest or apoptosis. At the molecular level, p53 is a transcription factor that can activate a panel of genes implicated in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. p53 is a potent cell cycle inhibitor which is tightly regulated by MDM2 at the cellular level. MDM2 and p53 form a feedback control loop. MDM2 can bind p53 and inhibit its ability to transactivate p53-regulated genes. In addition, MDM2 mediates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53. p53 can activate the expression of the MDM2 gene, thus raising the cellular level of MDM2 protein. This feedback control loop insures that both MDM2 and p53 are kept at a low level in normal proliferating cells. MDM2 is also a cofactor for E2F, which plays a central role in cell cycle regulation.<br>
The ratio of MDM2 to p53 (E2F) is dysregulated in many cancers. Frequently occurring molecular defects in the pl6INK4/pl9ARF locus, for instance, have been shown to affect MDM2 protein degradation. Inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction in tumor cells with wild-type p53 should lead to accumulation of p53, cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. MDM2 antagonists, therefore, can offer a novel approach to cancer therapy as single agents or in combination with a broad spectrum of other antitumor therapies. The feasibility of this strategy has been shown by the use of different roacromolecular tools for inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction (e.g. antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, peptides). MDM2 also binds E2F through a conserved binding region as p53 and activates E2F-dependent transcription of cyclin A, suggesting that MDM2 antagonists might have effects in p53 mutant cells.<br><br>
Wells et al. J. Org. Chem., 1972, 37, 2158-2161, report synthesis of imidazolines. Hunter et al., Can. J. Chem., 1972, Vol. 50, pgs. 669-77, report the preparation of amarine and isoamarine compounds which had previously been studied for chemiluminescence (McCapra et al. Photochem. and Photobiol. 1965,4,1111-1121). Zupanc et al. Bull Soc. Chem. &amp; Tech. (Yugoslavia) 1980-81, 27/28,71-80, report the use of triaryl imidazolines as starting materials in the preparation of EDTA derivatives.<br>
EP 363 061 to Matsumoto reports imidazoline derivatives useful as immunomodulators. The compounds were indicated to have low toxicity. Treatment and/or prevention of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus, erythemathodes, and rheumatic fever were implipated.   WO 00/78725 to Choueiry et al. report a method for making substituted amidine compounds, and indicate that imidazoline-type compounds maybe useful in the treatment of diabetes or related diseases involving impaired glucose disposal.<br>
US 6,617,346 Bl issued September 9,2003 and US 6,734,302 B2 issued May 11, 2004 disclose related racemic cis-imidazolines. US 6,734,302 B2 particularly discloses a closely related broad genus of racemic compounds which generally encompasses the presently claimed compounds save for the chirality and narrow genus of the present compounds.<br>
The present invention provides at least one compound of formula I<br><br><br>
wherein Xi, X^, Yi, Y2, and R are as described herewithin as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof.<br>
The present invention provides chiral cis-imidazolines which are small molecule inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction. In cell-free and cell-based assays, compounds of the present invention are shown to inhibit the interaction of MDM2 protein with a p53-like peptide with a potency that is approximately 100 fold greater than a p53-derived peptide. In cell-based assays, these compounds demonstrate mechanistic activity. Incubation of cancer cells with wild-type p53 leads to accumulation of p53 protein, induction of p53-regulated p21 gene, and cell cycle arrest in Gl and G2 phase,  resulting in potent antiproliferative activity against wild-type p53 cells in vitro. In contrast, these activities were not observed in cancer cells with mutant p53 at comparable compound concentrations. Therefore, the activity of MDM2 antagonists is likely linked to its mechanism of action. These compounds can be potent and selective anticancer agents.<br>

The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the following scheme 1.<br><br>
The synthesis commences with the coupling reaction of a benzimidate 2 (prepared from the corresponding benzonitriles using hydrogen chloride gas in ethanol, US 6,617,346 Bl) with a diamine 1, for example meso-l,2-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-ethane-l,2-<br><br>
diamine (prepared according to the procedure described by Jennerwein, M. et al. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol 1988, 114, 347-58; Vogtle, F.; Goldschmitt, E. Chern. Ber. 1976,109, 1-40), in a solvent such as ethanol. Treatment of the imidazoline 3 with phosgene in the presence of a base such as triethylamine gives the racemic carbamoyl chloride 4. The enantiomers of the carbamoyl chloride rac-4 can be separated using chiral chromatography. The chiral stationary phase R,R-Whelk-01, available through Regis Technologies, can be used. Coupling of the desired enantiomer 5 A with appropriate amine groups (indicated as R group) provides the compounds of the formula L<br>
If it is desired, the racemic compounds of formula I can be prepared from rac-6 using appropriate amine groups (indicated as R group). The enantiomers of I then can be separated by chiral chromatography. The chiral stationary phase Diacel ChiralPak OD or AD can be used.<br>
The absolute stereochemistry of the active enantiomer of I is determined based on the crystal structure of its complex with the human MDM2 (Vassilev et al. Science, 2004, 303, 844-848.<br>
The following examples and references are provided to aid the understanding of the present invention, the true scope of which is set forth in the appended claims.<br>

In Vitro Activity Assay<br>
The ability of the compounds to inhibit the interaction between p53 and MDM2 proteins was measured by an ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay) in which recombinant GST-tagged MDM2 binds to a peptide that resembles the MDM2-interacting region of p53 (B6ttger et al., J. Mol. Bio. 1997, Vol. 269, pgs. 744-756). This peptide is immobilized to the surface of a 96 well plate via N-terminal biotin which binds to streptavidin-coated wells. MDM2 is added to each well in the presence of anti-MDM2 mouse monoclonal antibody (SMP-14, Santa Cruz Biotech). After removal of the unbound MDM2 protein, a peroxydase-linked secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the amount of peptide-bound MDM2 is determined colorimetrically by the addition of a peroxydase substrate (MTB Microwell Peroxydase Substrate System, Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Labs).<br>
Test plates were prepared by coating with streptavidin (5 mg/ml in PBS) for 2 hours followed by a PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) wash and overnight blocking with 150 uL of blocking buffer containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) in PBS at 4 °C. Biotmylated peptide (1 uM) is added to each well in 50 uL of blocking buffer and washed extensively after 1 h incubation. Test compounds were diluted in a separate 96 well plate and added in triplicate to a compound incubation plate containing a mix of the MDM2 protein and anti-MDM2 antibody. After 20 min incubation, the content of the plate is transferred to the test plate and incubated for an additional 1 hour. The secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody is added to the test plate preceeded and followed by a triple wash with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. Finally, peroxydase substrate is added to each well and the absorption was read using a plate reader (MR7000, Dynatech) at 450 nm. The inhibitory activity of the test compounds was measured as a percentage of the bound MDM2 in treated vs. untreated wells and IC50 was calculated.<br><br>
IC50s showing biological activity that applies to compounds of the subject matter of this invention ranges from about 0.020 uM to about 20 uM. Specific data for some examples are as follows:<br>
