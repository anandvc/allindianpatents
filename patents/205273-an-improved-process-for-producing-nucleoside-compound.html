				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
This   invention   relates   to   an   improved  process   for  producing nucleoside   compound.<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a nucleoside compound using a nucleoside phosphorylase. A variety of nucleosides and their analogues are used as a starting material for synthesis or drug formulation in production of an antiviral, anticancer or antisense agent.<br>
Background Art<br>
The term "nucleoside phosphorylase" is a generic name for enzymes involved in phosphorolysis of an N-glycoside bond in a nucleoside in the presence of phosphoric acid. As an example using ribonucleoside, it catalyzes a reaction represented by the following formula:<br>
Ribonucleoside + Phosphoric acid (phosphate) <br>
Nucleic acid base + Ribose-1-phosphate<br>
The enzymes, which may be generally classified into purine<br>
nucleoside nucleoside phosphorylases and pyrimidine/phosphorylases, are widely<br>
distributed in the living world; for example, they are present in tissues of a mammal, bird or fish; yeasts; and bacteria.    The enzyme reaction<br>
1<br><br>
is reversible and synthesis of various nucleoside compounds using the reverse reaction is known several years past.<br>
For example, there is known a process for producing thymidine (JP-A 01-104190), 2'-deoxyadenosine (JP-A 11-137290) or 2'-deoxyguanosine (JP-A 11-137290) from 2'-deoxyribose-l-phosphate and a nucleic acid base (thymine, adenine or guanine, respectively). In addition, Agric. Biol. Chem., Vol. 50 (l), pp. 121-126 (1986) describes a technique to produce ribavirin, as an antiviral agent by decomposing inosine into ribose-1-phosphate and hypoxanthine as a reaction using a purine nucleoside phosphorylase derived from Enterobacter aerogenes in the presence of phosphoric acid and reacting ribose-1-phosphate isolated by an ion-exchange resin and l,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide also using purine nucleoside phosphorylase derived from Enterobacter aerogenes.<br>
However, since the reaction for forming the nucleoside compound from a pentose-l-phosphate or its salt and a nucleic acid base by the reverse reaction using the enzyme is an equilibrium reaction, there has been a technical drawback that a conversion rate could not be improved.<br>
When a nucleoside is industrially produced, it is essential to proceed with this reaction wit a higher conversion rate in order to reduce a raw material cost and improve purity of the product thus obtained.<br>
Thus, an object of this invention is to provide a process which is   more   widely   applicable   for   preparing   a   nucleoside   compound<br>
2<br><br><br>
comprising the step of reacting a pentose-1-phosphate with a nucleic acid base or its analogue in the presence of nucleoside phosphorylase activity with an improved rate of conversion into the nucleoside compound though the reaction.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
After intensive investigation for solving the these problems, we have found that the conversion rate can be improved by allowing a metal cation capable of forming a water-insoluble salt with a phosphate ion to be present in a reaction solution, because the reaction equilibrium sifts toward the direction for synthesizing the nucleoside compound by removing the phosphate ion, as a byproduct of the reaction, from the reaction system as a water-insoluble salt precipitate.<br>
We have further found that almost the same effect can be obtained by the presence of the metal cation capable of forming the water-insoluble salt with phosphoric acid in the form of a pentoee-1-phosphate salt in the reaction solution, in comparison with the above addition of the metal cation or its salt capable of forming a water-insoluble salt with phosphoric acid in to the reaction solution.<br>
This invention is based on these findings.<br>
Particularly, a process according to the present invention for preparing a nucleoside compound comprising a step of reacting a pentoselphosphate with a nucleic acid base or its analogue in the presence of nucleoside phosphorylase activity in an aqueous reaction medium to form the nueleoside compound, which is characterized in<br><br><br>
3<br><br>
allowing a metal cation capable of forming a water-insoluble salt with phosphate ion to be present in the aqueous reaction medium.<br>
Ribose'l-phosphate or 2-deoxyribose-l-phosphate may be used in this preparation process as the pentose-1-phosphate.<br>
As the metal cation capable of forming a water-insoluble salt with phosphoric acid, at least one selected from the group consisting of calcium, barium and aluminum ions may be used.<br>
The metal cation capable of forming a water-insoluble salt with phosphoric acid may be added to the aqueous reaction medium as a metal salt with at least one anion selected from the group consisting of chloride, nitride, carbonate, sulfate and acetate ions.<br>
The metal cation capable of forming a water-insoluble salt with phosphoric acid may be present as a pentose-1-phosphate salt in the aqueous reaction medium.<br>
According to this invention, a reaction yield can be significantly improved in the synthetic reaction of the nucleoside compound from the pentose-1-phosphate and the nucleic acid base or its analogue using the enzyme activity of the nucleoside phosphorylase in the presence of the metal cation capable of forming a water-insoluble salt with phosphoric acid, and, thus, an effective process for preparing the nucleoside compound can be provided.<br>

A nucleoside phosphorylase is a generic name for enzymes capable of phosphorolysis of an N-glycoside bond in a nucleoside in the presence of phosphoric acid, and its reverse reaction can be applied to this invention by using this enzyme activity. An enzyme used in the reaction may be of any type or origin as long as it has an activity of forming a desired nucleoside compound from a corresponding pentose-1-phosphate and a nucleic acid base or its analogue. The enzymes may be generally categorized into two types, purine and pyrimidine types. Known examples of a purine type enzyme include purine nucleoside phosphorylase (EC2.4.2.1) and guanosine phosphorylase (EC2.4.2.15). Examples of a pyrimidine type enzyme include pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase (EC2.4.2.2), uridine phosphorylase (EC2.4.2.3), thymidine phosphorylase (EC2.4.2.4) and deoxyuridine phosphorylase (EC2.4.2.23).<br>
Nucleoside phosphorylase activity in this invention may be applied to a reaction system by using a microorganism having the enzyme activity in an aqueous reaction medium or in contact with an aqueous reaction medium. Such a microorganism may be, with no restrictions, any microorganism expressing at least one nucleoside phosphorylase selected from the group consisting of purine nucleoside<br>
9<br><br>

Recent advance in molecular biology and genetic engineering has made preparation of a genetically engineered recombinant strain possible and relatively easier, by obtaining a gene for a nucleoside phosphorylase from the above strain though analysis of the molecular-biological properties, the amino acid sequence and the like of the protein in the strain; constructing a recombinant plasmid into which the gene and a regulatory region for its expression is inserted; and introducing the plasmid into a given host to obtain the recombinant strain to allow the recombinant strain to express the protein. In the light of the recent technical level, such a genetically engineered recombinant strain obtained by introducing the gene for a nucleoside<br>
10<br><br>
phosphorylase into a desired host may be included in the microorganisms capable of expressing the phosphorylase according to the present invention.<br>
A regulatory region necessary for expression herein may be a promoter sequence (may include an operator sequence controlling transcription), a ribosome binding sequence (SD sequence), a transcription termination sequence, or the like. Examples of a promoter sequence include a trp operator in a tryptophane operon derived from E. coli; a lac promoter in a lactose operon; a PL promoter and a PR promoter derived from lambda phageJ a gluconate synthase promoter (gnt) derived from Bacillus subtilis; an alkali protease promoter (apr); a neutral protease promoter (npr); and cramylase promoter (amy). An uniquely modified and designed sequence such as a tac promoter may be used. A ribosome binding sequence may be, for example, a sequence derived from E. coli or Bacillus subtilis, but any sequence may be used as long as it can function in a desired host such as E. coli and Bacillus subtilis. For example, one can use a consensus sequence formed by DNA synthesis, that is, a sequence with more than 4 consecutive bases complementary to 3'-terminal region in 16S ribosome RNA. A transcription termination sequence is not always necessary, but a pfactor independent terminator such as a lipoprotein terminator and a trp operon terminator may be used. Desirably, these regulatory regions on a recombinant plasmid may be sequentially aligned as follows; from upstream of 5'-terminal, a promoter sequence, a ribosome binding sequence, a nucleoside phosphorylase coding gene<br>
11<br><br>
and a transcription termination sequence.<br>
As concrete examples of a plasmid herein, pBR 322, pUCl8, Bluescript II SK(+), pKK223-3 and pSClOl having an autonomously replicable region in E. coli; pUBHO, pTZ4, pC194, pll,    and  105 having an autonomously replicable region in Bacillus subtilis may be used as a vector. As examples of a plasmid autonomously replicable in two or more hosts, pHVl4, TRp7, YEp7 and pBS7 may be used as a vector.<br>
A given host herein may be typically, but not limited to, Escherichia coli as described in Examples later, but other strains such as Bacillus sp. including Bacillus subtilis, as well as yeasts and actinomyces may be used.<br>
The nucleoside phosphorylase or the microorganism capable of expressing its activity in this invention may be a commercially available enzyme, a microorganism strain expressing its activity, a processed material of the strain or an immobilized product thereof. A processed material of the strain may be, for example, acetone-dried cells or bacterial debris prepared by an appropriate procedure such as mechanical destruction, ultrasonic disintegration, freezing and thawing, pressurization and depressurization, osmotic pressure methods, autolysis, cell-wall decomposition and surfactant treatment. If necessary, the strain may be further purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, acetone precipitation or column chromatography.<br>
In this invention, a metal cation capable of forming a water-insoluble salt with phosphate ion may be, without restriction,<br>
12<br><br>
any metal cation which can form a water-insoluble salt with phosphate ion as a byproduct in the reaction for precipitation. Examples of such metal cation include calcium, magnesium, barium, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, silver, molybdenum, lead, zinc and lithium ions. Among these, particularly preferable are industrially universal and safe metal ions which do not adversely affect the reaction, e.g., calcium, barium and aluminum ions.<br>
The metal cation capable of forming a water-insoluble salt with phosphate ion in this invention may be added in the reaction solution as a salt(s) of a metal cation(s) capable of forming a water"insoluble salt(s) with phosphate ion with at least one anion selected from chloride, nitride, carbonate, sulfate and acetate ions. Examples of such a salt include calcium chloride, calcium nitride, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, calcium acetate, barium chloride, barium nitride, barium carbonate, barium sulfate, barium acetate, aluminum chloride, aluminum nitride, aluminum carbonate, aluminum sulfate and aluminum acetate.<br>
A metal cation in this invention may be present as a salt with a pentose-1-phosphate in the reaction solution.    Concrete examples of such salt include ribose'l-phosphate calcium salt, 2-deoxyribose-l-phosphate calcium salt, 2,3-dideoxyribose-l-phosphate calcium salt, arabinose-1-phosphate   calcium  salt,   ribose-1-phosphate  barium   salt, 2-deoxyribose-l-phosphate barium salt,  2,3-dideoxyribose-l-phosphate barium   salt,   arabinose-1-phosphate   barium   salt,   ribose-1-phosphate aluminum salt, 2-deoxyribose-l-phosphate aluminum salt,<br>
13<br><br>
2,3-dideoxyribose-l-phosphate aluminum salt and arabinose-1-phosphate aluminum salt.<br>
An aqueous reaction medium constituting a reaction solution used in this invention is a reaction medium mainly comprising water. Any of such media may be used as long as it can eliminate phosphate ion from the reaction system as an insoluble salt precipitate by reacting it with a metal cation while the desired reaction utilizing enzyme activity in this invention proceeds. Examples of such an aqueous reaction medium include water and aqueous reaction media prepared by adding a water-soluble organic solvent such as a lower alcohol, acetone and dimethylsulfoxide to water. When using a water-soluble organic solvent, a rate of the water-soluble organic solvent to water may be, for example, 0.1 to 70 wt%. For ensuring stability of the reaction, a reaction solution comprising the aqueous reaction medium may be prepared as a buffer. Known buffers, which can be used for the enzyme reaction for this invention, may be used as the buffer.<br>
A reaction for preparing a nucleoside compound in this invention may be conducted under the conditions such as appropriate pH and temperature, depending on a target nucleoside, a pentose-1-phosphate and a nucleic acid base or its analogue as substrates, a nucleoside phosphorylase or a microorganism exhibiting the activity of the enzyme or one of various preparations from the microorganism as a reaction catalyst, and the type and the properties of a metal salt added for eliminating phosphoric acid from the reaction system.    The reaction may be generally carried out at a pH in the<br>
14<br><br>
range of 5 to 10 and a temperature in the range of 10 to 60 °C. If pH is not within the control range, it may be possible that the reaction conversion rate reduces due to, for example, poor stability of the target product or substrate, reduction in enzyme activity and failure to forming the water-insoluble salt with phosphoric acid. If pH varies in the course of the reaction, an acid such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid or an alkali such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide may be added at an appropriate timing, if necessary. The concentrations of a pentose-1-phosphate and a nucleic acid base or its analogue are suitably about 0.1 to 1000 mM. In terms of a molar ratio between them, a molar ratio of a nucleic acid base or its analogue to a pentose-lphosphate or its salt may be 1 to 10, preferably 0.95 or less in the light of a reaction conversion rate. When using two or more of nucleic acid bases or their analogues as a mixture, the above concentration and molar ratio may be selected for the total amount used.<br>
A metal cation capable of forming a water-insoluble salt with phosphoric acid to be added may be added in a molar ratio of 0.1 to 10, more preferably 0.5 to 5 to a pentose-1-phosphate used in the reaction. In a reaction with a higher concentration, a nucleic acid base or its analogue as a substrate or a nucleoside as a product may be not be completely dissolved in the reaction solution. This invention may be also applied to such a case. When using a mixture of two or more materials as a metal cation, the above molar ratio may be selected for the total amount used.<br>
15<br><br>
A nucleoside compound thus produced may be isolated from, the reaction solution by a common procedure such as concentration, crystallization,     dissolution,     electrodialysis     and     adsorption     and desorption using an ion-exchange resin or charcoal. Examples<br>
This invention will be explained with reference to, but not limited to, Examples and Comparative Examples. Analytical method<br>
