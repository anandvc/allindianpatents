				<td>ORAL CARE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING COMBINATIONS OF ANTIBACTERIAL AND HOST-RESPONSE MODULATING AGENTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to oral care compositions comprising combinations of therapeutic agents, specifically antibacterial agents combined with host-response modulating agents, in particular agents with anti-inflammatory activity for highly effective treatment and control of periodontal disease and for promotion of overall oral health and whole body or systemic health. The present compositions are particularly effective in inhibiting or killing bacterial pathogens in the oral cavity and in modulating host reaction to the presence of these pathogens and the toxins, endotoxins, inflammatory cytokines and mediators released by or prompted by these pathogens. By effectively treating and preventing periodontal disease, the present compositions also provide benefits to whole body or systemic health since periodontal infection is a risk factor in the development of a number of systemic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, diabetes, severe respiratory infections, premature births and low birth weight.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recent research has revealed that periodontal disease (gum disease) may be a far more serious threat to overall systemic health than previously realized. Periodontitis, a form of periodontal disease, is a tissue destructive process resulting from the accumulation of pathogenic bacteria along the gingival margin and the consequent tissue destructive host response to these pathogens. The presence of periodontitis can also result in the release of bacteria and/or bacterial toxins into the bloodstream. The host responses to the presence of these bacterial pathogens and/or toxins in the bloodstream may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis (heart disease), increase the risk of premature, underweight babies; and pose a serious threat to people whose health is compromised by diabetes, severe respiratory diseases, stroke and bacteremia (bacteria in the blood).<br>
For a long time, it has been known that bacteria may affect the heart. Now evidence is mounting that suggests people with periodontitis, a bacteria-mediated disease, may be more at risk for heart disease, and have a significantly higher risk of having a fatal<br>
heart attack, than patients without periodontitis. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in most developed countries, and periodontitis is one of the most common bacterial-mediated diseases in humans, affecting as many as one third of those over 50. Thus even if periodontitis has only a modest effect on increasing the risk of heart attack, its prevalence may make it a significant contributor to the risk for heart disease in the population as a whole.<br>
Several theories exist to explain the link between periodontal disease and heart disease. One theory is that oral bacterial pathogens enter the blood through inflamed gums, attach to fatty plaques in the coronary arteries (heart blood vessels) and cause small blood clots that contribute to clogged arteries. Researchers have found that 70% of the fatty plaque that blocks carotid arteries and causes stroke contains bacteria. Forty percent of those bacteria have been traced to the mouth. Coronary artery disease is characterized by a thickening of the walls of the coronary arteries due to the buildup of fatty proteins. Blood clots can obstruct normal blood flow, restricting the amount of nutrients and oxygen required for the heart to function properly. This may lead to heart attacks. Another possibility is that changes in systemic inflammatory mediators caused by periodontitis increase development of atherosclerotic plaque, which then contributes to thickening of the arterial walls.<br>
Research also suggests that people with diabetes are more likely to have periodontitis than people without diabetes, and the presence of periodontitis may make it more difficult for diabetics to control their blood sugar. It is known that the presence of periodontitis can increase blood sugar, contributing to increased periods of time when the body functions with a high blood sugar level, which puts a diabetic person at increased risk for diabetic complications. Thus, controlling periodontitis may help control diabetes. A recent study ("Heightened Gingival Inflammation and Attachment Loss in Type 2 Diabetics with Hyperlipidemia," in Journal of Periodontology, November, 1999) found that poorly controlled type 2 diabetic patients are more likely to develop periodontal disease than well-controlled diabetics. The study further explains why diabetics are more susceptible to severe periodontal disease. The study concluded that poorly controlled diabetics respond differently to bacterial plaque at the gum line than well-controlled diabetics and non-diabetics, possibly due to elevated serum triglycerides. Poorly controlled diabetics have more harmful proteins (cytokines) in their gingival tissue,<br>
causing destructive inflammation of the gums. In turn beneficial proteins (growth factors) are reduced, interfering with the healing response to infection, "Increased serum triglyceride levels in uncontrolled diabetics seem to be related to greater attachment loss and probing depths, which are measures of periodontal disease," said Christopher Cutler, D.D.S., Ph.D., the study's lead researcher.<br>
Evidence is also mounting that suggests pregnant women who have periodontitis may be significantly more likely to have a premature, low-birthweight baby. The inflammatory response prompted by periodontitis and/or the associated presence of bacterial pathogens/toxins in the bloodstream are cause for concern among pregnant women because they pose a risk to the health of the fetus. The presence of periodontitis appears to retard fetal growth by releasing into the woman's bloodstream bacterial toxins that reach the placenta and interfere with fetal development by increasing systemic levels of inflammatory mediators that could prompt pre-term birth. Scientists have also proposed that the presence of a low-grade infection may influence harmed cells to discharge inflammatory chemicals, similar to those used to induce abortion. This can cause the cervix to dilate and set off uterine contractions. The risk of having a premature baby of low birth weight was estimated to be at least 7.5 times as high for women with severe periodontal disease, and to occur in 5 percent of pregnancies, costing the U.S. $5.7 billion a year. [S. Offenbacher, J. Periodontol. 1996Oct;67(10Suppl): 1103-13].<br>
Research further suggests that periodontal disease may pose an increased risk for severe respiratory diseases like pneumonia, bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<br>
The VA Dental Longitudinal Study (DLS) and Normative Aging Study (NAS) examined the relationship of periodontal disease to mortality from all outcomes and concluded that periodontal status at baseline was a significant and independent predictor of mortality. [Annals of Periodontology, 3(1), 339-49, July 1998] The study was conducted starting in the mid- 1960s among men on good medical health and followed over more than a 25-year period. It was found that for each 20% increment in mean whole-mouth ABL (alveolar bone loss, measured with a Schei ruler using full-mouth series of periapical films), the subject's risk of death increased by 51%. The risk of death was also found to be associated with periodontal status as measured clinically by<br>
periodontal probing depth. Subjects in the population group with the deepest average probing depths were found to be at 74 % higher risk.<br>
According to Dr. Michael Roizen, University of Chicago internist and anesthesiologist, keeping teeth and gums healthy adds 6.4 years to a person's life. Indeed, the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) concurs that keeping teeth and gums healthy is as significant as taking vitamins, quitting smoking and reducing stress as among the top things that a person can do to add years to life.<br>
Periodontal disease ("gum disease") is a broad term used to describe those diseases which attack the gingiva and the underlying alveolar bone supporting the teeth. The disease exists in a number of species of warm blooded animals such as humans and canines, and includes a series of diseases exhibiting various syndromes which vary from each other according to the stage or situation of the disease or the age of the patient. The term is used for any inflammatory disease which initially occurs at a marginal gingiva area and may affect the alveolar bone. Periodontal disease affects the periodontium, which is the investing and supporting tissue surrounding a tooth (i.e., the periodontal ligament, the gingiva, and the alveolar bone). Two common stages of periodontal disease are gingivitis (inflammation of the gingiva) and periodontitis (inflammation of the periodontal ligament manifested by progressive resorption of alveolar bone, increasing mobility of the teeth, and loss of the teeth at advanced stage). Combinations of inflammatory and degenerative conditions are termed periodontitis complex. Other terms used for various aspects of periodontal disease are "juvenile periodontitis", "acute<br>
necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis", and "alveolar pyorrhea".<br>
Periodontal disease may involve one or more of the following conditions:<br>
inflammation of the gingiva, formation of periodontal pockets, bleeding and/or pus discharge from the periodontal pockets, resorption of alveolar bone, loose teeth and loss of teeth. Bacteria present in dental plaque which forms on the surface of the teeth and in the periodontal pocket contribute to both the initiation and progress of periodontal disease. Thus, in order to prevent or treat periodontal disease, these bacteria must be suppressed by some means other than simple mechanical scrubbing. Towards this end, there has been a great deal of research aimed at developing therapeutic dentifrices, mouthwashes, and methods of treating periodontal disease, which are effective in suppressing these bacteria. However, periodontal disease involves more than the<br>
bacterial infection. Severe periodontal disease involves the destruction of periodontal tissue, which is primarily caused by the indirect effects mediated by the host's reaction to the bacteria in the periodontium and gingival sulcus, specifically inflammation.<br>
As indicated, gingivitis is an inflammatory disease of the gingival and periodontium characterized by redness, swelling and bleeding upon probing. If left unchecked, gingivitis may progress into periodontitis, which may result in attachment loss, bone destruction and tooth loss. Anaerobic bacteria are generally regarded as the initiating agent of gingivitis, with subsequent progression and disease severity determined by the host immune response, i.e., inflammation, which is a nonspecific cellular and biochemical process involving multiple pro-inflammatory agents. /<br>
Bacterial metabolites induce leukocyte chemotaxis which results in the accumulation of inflammatory cells at the site of the bacterial challenge. Furthermore, bacterial metabolites induce the production of inflammatory mediators by leukocytic cells, in particular monocytes. Amongst these are local disease mediators such as metabolites of arachidonic acid, e.g. leukotrienes, prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Prostaglandins have been found to be particularly important in the metabolism and destruction of tissue and alveolar bone. Indeed, the production of prostaglandins in the periodontal tissues has been found to be an important mediator of the loss of alveolar bone in the periodontium. Patients with periodontal breakdown show an elevated prostaglandin E2 level both in the gingival tissue as well as in the crevicular fluid. Prostaglandins and thromboxanes are formed from arachidonic acid by an enzyme cascade, the first step of which is the cyclooxygenation by an enzyme called cyclooxygenase (COX). Inhibiting the cyclooxygenase would inhibit the formation of prostaglandins and thus reduce alveolar bone loss, and indeed certain cyclooxygenase inhibitors, particularly non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as indomethacin and flurbiprofen have been found to markedly reduce the resorption of alveolar bone.<br>
Once inflammation starts, the process can self-propagate even when the causative agent is removed. Therefore, an anti-bacterial, such as stannous, zinc, CPC and peroxide, in combination with an anti-inflammatory agent would be a more effective therapy for gingivitis than the conventional method of using anti-bacterial agents alone. The present invention involves such combination of particular anti-bacterial agents and anti-inflammatory, agents in oral care compositions to effectively treat and prevent bacteria-<br>
mediated diseases of the oral cavity and thereby inhibit periodontal bacteria-induced systemic disease.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention encompasses oral care compositions comprising the combination of particular antibacterial agents with agents having anti-inflammatory activity, i.e., against one or more of inflammatory factors produced by the body (host) in response to bacterial infection in the oral cavity, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMP's), cyclooxygenases (COX), PGE2, interleuldn 1 (DL/-1), DL-10 converting enzyme (ICE), transforming growth factor ß1 (TGF-ßl), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), hyaluronidase, cathepsins, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB), and IL-1 Receptor Associated Kinase (IRAK) to provide enhanced efficacy against bacteria-mediated diseases of the oral cavity. The present compositions are effective in inhibiting and/or killing pathogenic oral bacteria and in modulating host reaction to the presence of these pathogens in the oral cavity as well as to the toxins, endotoxins, inflammatory cytokines and mediators released by or prompted by these pathogens.<br>

Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed mat the present compositions promote whole body or systemic health by effectively modulating the body's response to pathogenic oral bacteria and associated bacterial toxins, endotoxins, inflammatory mediators and cytokines. The present compositions are effective in treating and preventing bacteria-mediated diseases present in the oral cavity, including plaque, gingivitis, periodontitis, and herpetic lesions, as well as infections that may develop following dental procedures such as osseous surgery, tooth extraction, periodontal flap surgery, dental implantation, and scaling and root planing. By controlling bacteria-mediated diseases and conditions present in the oral cavity, spread into the bloodstream and other parts of the body of pathogenic bacteria and associated harmful substances including toxins and endotoxins is prevented or minimized<br>
Oral infections can lead to systemic infection. Bacteria can spread from the mouth into the bloodstream and other parts of the body, putting a person's health at risk. Recent research has found that periodontitis may contribute to the development of a number of serious conditions including heart disease, diabetes, severe respiratory diseases and premature, underweight births.<br>
It is now known that chronic oral cavity infection produces a biologic burden of bacterial toxins and inflammatory cytokines that may initiate and exacerbate atherosclerosis and thromboembolic events. Additionally, a known periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis has been isolated from arteriosclerotic plaques. Periodontal disease has also been shown to induce episodes of significant bacteremias and thromboembolic events such as myocardial infarction; stroke can occur following bacteremia. Certain bacteria associated with oral cavity diseases, Streptococcus sanguis and Porphyromonas gingivalis, have been demonstrated to cause platelets to aggreggate upon contact with these bacteria. The resultant bacterially-mduced platelet agggregates can form the emboli which are responsible for the acute myocardial infarction or stroke.<br>
Periodontitis, a common form of periodontal disease, is believed to be caused by a small group of Gram-negative bacteria present on the tooth root surfaces as biofilms. Biofiltns are defined as matrix-enclosed bacterial populations adherent to each other and/or to surfaces or interfaces. Experts have recently concluded that three species, all of which are Gram-negative and anaerobic, are present in these biofilms and account for most cases of periodontitis. These are Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, with the latter found mostly in cases of juvenile periodontitis. The bacteria in the biofilms shed vesicles that are rich in lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Bacteria and bacterial substances, especially LPS, traverse the junctional and pocket epithelium to gain access to connective tissue and blood vessels, initiate and perpetuate immunoinflammation. All of the components of blood and serum pass into the connective tissue. B- and T-lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages appear in the periodontal tissues. LPS interacts with monocytes and macrophages to activate cells to synthesize large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1, TNFα, PGEα) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP's). MMP's destroy the connective tissues of the gingiva and periodontal ligament; IL-1, TNFα, and PGEz have been shown to mediate bone destruction. Periodontitis may enhance susceptibility to systemic diseases in several ways. LPS and viable Gram-negative bacteria from the biofilms and cytokines from inflamed periodontal tissues may enter the circulation in pathogenic quantities.<br>
In one aspect the present invention relates to topical oral compositions for humans and animals, including therapeutic rinses, especially mouth rinses; dentifrices such as toothpastes, tooth gels, and tooth powders; non-abrasive gels; mouth sprays; mousse; foams; chewing gums, lozenges and breath mints; dental solutions and irrigation fluids; dental implements such as dental floss and tape; and pet care products including nutritional supplements, food, drinking water additives, chews or toys, comprising a combination of<br>
(a) one or more of a first active agent having inhibitory activity against at least one of host pro-inflammatory factors selected from matrix metalloproteinases (MMP's), cyclooxygenases (COX), PGE2, inferleulein 1 (IL-1), IL-lß converting enzyme (ICE), transforming growth factor ß1 (TGF-ßI), iriducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS),<br><br>
12<br>
hyaluronidase, cathepsins, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB), and IL-1 Receptor Associated Kinase (IRAK); and<br>
(b) one or more of a second active agent having inhibitory activity against at least one of bacterial virulence factors selected from biofilm formation, biofilm adherence and bacterial enzymes selected from gingipains, METase, and Cystalysin.<br>
The combination of at least two different active agents provides enhanced efficacy to treat and prevent bacteria-mediated oral cavity conditions and to inhibit oral-bacteria-mediated systemic diseases.<br>
The first active agent has anti-inflammatory activity as demonstrated by activity against at least one, preferably two or more of key host pro-inflammatory factors including matrix metalloproteinases (MMP's), cyclooxygenases (COX), PGEi, interleukin 1 (DL-1), IL-lß} converting enzyme (ICE), transforming growth factor pi (TGF-ßl), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), hyaluronidase, cathepsins, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB), and IL-1 Receptor Associated Kinase (IRAK). Elevated levels of these factors are associated with gingivitis and periodontitis, indicating these components are major mediators of inflammation in the host.<br>
MMP's (including various subtypes, e.g., MMP 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 13), are host extracellular matrix proteases that contribute to tissue destruction and remodeling. COX enzymes catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which result in vasodilation, redness, puffiness and pain. IL-1ß is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which induces the synthesis of PGE and various MMP's and is likely involved in destruction of alveolar bone. IL-1ß is synthesized as a larger precursor peptide and requires the cleavage by ICE into the active form. ICE is thus the processing enzyme for the production of IL-1ß. IRAK'S are signaling molecules downstream from IL-1ß. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is an enzyme involved in the production of large amounts of nitric oxide, which may be cytotoxic. TGF-pl promotes cellular proliferation and is suggested to be one of the growth factors modulating exaggerated host response together other major mediators of inflammation. Hyaluronidase catalyzes the degradation of endogenous hyaluronic acid (hyaluronan), a glycosaminoglycan with anti-inflammatory and antiedematous properties, thus having a beneficial effect on plaque-induced gingivitis. Inhibiting hyaluronidase would thus increase the endogenous level of hyaluronic acid. A major feature of gingivitis and periodontitis is tile destruction of the collagenous matrix of<br>
the surrounding connective tissue. Cathepsins are proteolytic enzymes released from cells adjacent to the site of destruction. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-KB) is a transcriptional factor that is stimulated by LPS and stimulates the expression of multiple cytokines and MMP's, thus controlling multiple inflammatory pathways.<br>
Because inflammation in itself is a multi-factorial process, preferred anti-inflammatory agents are those that suppress at least two different pro-inflammatory factors. Even more effective are agents that suppress three or more of these pro-inflammatory factors. Or combinations of agents may be used to complement each other and provide activity against multiple, preferably most or all pro-inflammatory factors.<br>
The activity of potential agents was tested in terms of their ability to inhibit purified host and bacterial enzymes known to be involved in gingivitis and periodontitis. The inhibition of purified human MMP's (supplied by Biomol International) and ICE (supplied by Calbiochem) was measured by the cleavage of the fluorogenic substrates Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (Biomol International) and N-acetyl-Trp-Glu-His-Asp-AMC (Biomol International), respectively. Activity was measured using a fluorescence assay described in C.G. Knight, et al. FEES Lett. 296,263 (1992).<br>
The inhibition of cyclooxygenases COX1 and 2 was measured using the Cayman COX Screening Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical) according to manufacturer's instructions.<br>
TGF-P activity was measured using a ß-lactamase reporter gene under the control of the Smad Binding Element (SBE) expressed in human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells. The inhibiton of TGF-ß activity was monitored by a decrease of TGF-ß-induced ß-lactamase activity, ß-lactamase activity was measured by the cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate containing two fluoroprobes (coumarin and fluorescein) using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay.<br>
BL-1R (receptor) activity was measured using a gene reporter assay in human endothelial ECV 304 cells. The reporter gene ICAM-1/luciferase is under the control of the ICAM-1 promoter regulated by two transcriptional factors NF-KB and AP-1, which are activated by EL-1R. The inhibiton of EL-1R activity was monitored by a decrease of IL-lß-induced luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was measured using an ATP-dependent chemiluminescence assay.<br>
inhibition of PGE2 formation was measured by the reduction in XL-lß-induced-PGE2 release in human epithelial A549 cells.   The amount of PGE2 released into the<br>
tissue culture was measured using the PGEa Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) kit (supplied by CisBio) according to manufacturer's instructions.<br>
The assays identified agents having anti-inflammatory activity including vitamin compounds such as riboflavin, riboflavin phosphate, folic acid, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), and menadione (vitamin K3); curcuminoids such as curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, bismethoxycurcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin; oils and extracts from spices and botanicals such as clove, cinnamon, cassia, ginger, basil, coriander, cilantro and allspice which contain active compounds including cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, guaiacol and derivatives such as eugenol, isoeugenol, dihydroeugenol, vanillyl butyl ether, vanillin (4-formyl-guaiacol), 5-propenylguaethol, 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol, 4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol acetate, and 4-methyl guaiacol; oils or extracts of thyme, oregano and sage containing thymol, carvacrol and carvacryl ethyl ether; neem oil; flavonoids and flavones such as baicalein, baicalin, wogonoside, wogonin, and quercetin; phenolics from plant sources such as tea, cranberry, pomegranate and oak bark including catechin, gallocatechin gallate, epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), theaflavine, thearubigins, anthocyanidins/proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins (e.g., cyanidin, delphinidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, malvidin and petunidin); tannic acid; gallic acid; ellagic acid; ellagitannins; hexamidine; and berberine.<br>
Results of assays demonstrating the activity of representative useful agents are summarized in Table 1 below. Where no data are reported is not an indication that the compound/active has no activity; rather that the compound/active was not tested for that activity.<br>

Additional useful agents that have been identified as having activity, for example, as inhibitor of MMP's, include menthyl anthranilate, (used commercially in lip balm as a sunscreen agent); hexyl isobutyrate (grape flavorant); 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (flavor component of vanilla extract); a broad group of polyphenols including resveratrol (component of red wines, found in grape skins), isoliquertigenin (found in licorice), apigenin (found in chamomile), pratol (found in red clover), 4'-methoxyflavone, 8-methyl-4'-methoxyflavone and 6-merayl-4'-methoxyflavone. Additional agents with inhibitory activity include: brazil in and quercetin against iNOS; green tea and Echinacea extracts against hyaluronidase; cinnamon against cathepsins; curcumin, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, preparations of bee propolis, and silymarin against NF-kB; and curcumin, fisetin, quercetin, luteoline, apigenin and diosmetin against IRAK'S. Additional agents with anti-inflammatory activity include a wide variety of plant-derived chemicals: flavonoids, isoflavonoids and other phenolics (e.g., myricetin, kaempferol, luteolin, hesperitin, naringenin, pterostilbene, rutin, rosmarinic acid, glabridin); carotenoids (e.g., lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin, astaxanthin, beta-carotene); limonoids and terpenoids (e.g., limonene, geraniol, farnesol); phytosterols (e.g., beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, ursolic acid); allicin; chlorogenic acid; ferulic acid; emodin; isothiocyanates (e.g., sulphoraphane); N-acetyl cysteine; phytic acid; and betaine.<br>
One advantage of the present invention is that many of the most potent active agents are natural materials already known to be safe for ingestion. For example, a number of the polyphenols above that have potent anti-inflammatory activity are natural components of tea (Camellia sinensis) which are regularly consumed by humans. Some examples of teas suitable for providing polyphenols herein include but are not limited to, red tea, oolong tea, baozhong tea, hangzhou tea, and green tea. Furthermore, the present materials are not antibiotics but ameliorate the progress of periodontal disease without harming beneficial oral microbial flora. Tea polyphenols for instance have the ability to even enhance the growth of beneficial microbes (e.g., Bifidobacillus). Actives in practice today, such as chlorohexidine, doxycycline and metronidazole, are antibiotics with potential bacterial resistance issues along with a more widespread organism killing potential, i.e., both harmful and beneficial bacteria.<br>
The antibacterial agents preferred in the present invention are those with selectivity for gram negative anaerobic bacteria involved in periodontal  disease, such as P,<br>
gingivalis, B. forsythus* A. actinomycetemcomitans, T. denticola, 71 socranskii, F. nucleatum, and P. intermedia and against other oral cavity strains such as L. acidophilus, L. casei, A. viscosus, S. sobrinus, S sanguis, S. viridans, and S. mutans. The present compositions are effective in killing, and/or altering bacterial metabolism, and/or suppressing the growth of, these microorganisms which cause topically-treatable infections and diseases of the oral cavity.<br>
P. gingivalis is a gram-negative anaerobe responsible for most periodontal disease in humans and companion animals. P. gingivalis infects the gingival sulcus, producing a number of virulence factors including cysteine proteases known as gingipains. Gingipains act on several immune system molecules, including kinogens, complement factors, immunoglobins, resulting in fluid influx into the sulcus, neutrophil recruitment, and bleeding. The ultimate result is a host inflammatory response characterized by COX2 induction, protease expression (MMP's), prostaglandin elevation and reactive oxygen elevations which result in tissue damage and bone resorption, eventually leading to tooth detachment. Inhibition of the proteolytic action of gingipains on immuno-regulatory proteins should lead to a reduction in the inflammatory host-response and subsequent tissue damage. Antibacterial activity of oral care agents may thus be assessed in terms of their inhibitory activity against gingipains and other bacterial enzymes, for example, METase and Cystalysin, which are involved in degrading sulfur-containing amino acids to produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) such as hydrogen sulftde or methyl mercaptan that lead to bad breath or oral malodor.<br>
The activity of R-gingipain was measured by the cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMOHCl (Calbiochem). Recombinant catalytic domain of R-gingipain of Porphyromonas gingivalis was expressed in and purified from E. coli. Activity of R-gingipain was measured by a fluorescence assay.<br>
METase activity was measured by the conversion of L-methionine into ketobutyrate which is quantitated by coupling to a hydrazine, using a spectrophotometry method described in Takakura, et al. Analytical Biochemistry 327: 233-240 (2004). Cystalysin activity was measured by coupling pyruvate production to the reduction of NADH via lactate dehydrogenase.<br>
Another aspect of antibacterial activity of the present agents relates to biofilm formation and dispersion or disruption. Biofilms form when microorganisms establish<br>
themselves on a surface and activate genes involved in producing a matrix that includes polysaccharides. This matrix may provide protection of biofilm bacteria from biocides. Molecules called quorum-sensing signals help trigger and coordinate part of the process of forming a biofilm. Bacteria constantly secrete low levels of the signals and sense them either through receptors on their surfaces, or internally. The receptors trigger behavioral changes when there are enough bacteria to allow the signals' concentrations to achieve a critical threshold. Once this occurs, bacteria respond by adopting communal behavior, such as forming a biofilm, and in the case of pathogenic bacteria, deploying virulence factors such as toxins. In addition to communicating with members of their own species, bacteria also conduct inter-species communications, such that a biofilm may contain more than one species of bacteria. Biofilms that adhere to teeth and oral surfaces lead to plaque and calculus and eventually periodontal disease and other oral cavity infections. Useful antibacterial agents are those which prevent bacterial adherence, colonization in the mouth and maturation into biofilms. The activity of agents to inhibit biofilm formation and/or to disperse biofilms is measured using assay methods such as described in commonly assigned WO 02/088298A1. Control of biofilms is determined by assaying the amount of biofilm resulting from treatment in the presence of a test compound as compared to the amount resulting from treatment in the absence of a test compound. A change in the amount of biofilm present as a result of a treatment may result from an effect on the exopolysaccharide matrix of biofilm or an effect on a microorganism within the biofilm, or an effect on the relationship therebetween. For example, biofilm formation or dispersion may be measured using crystal violet as a quantitative, total biofilm staining dye that stains both cells and extracellular polysaccharide.<br>
The antibacterial agents that are particularly useful in the practice of the present invention are those that have demonstrated inhibitory activity against one or more of the above bacterial enzymes and/or biofilms. Preferred anti-bacterial agents are those with multiple inhibitory activities. Results of assays demonstrating the activity of representative useful agents are summarized in Table n below. , Where no data are reported is not an indication that the compound/active has no activity; rather that the compound/active was not tested for that activity.<br>
Table II. Inhibition of Bacterial Enzymes/Factors<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
+ % inhibition 
Suitable antibacterial agents include cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC), stannous ion agent, zinc ion agent, copper ion agent, iron ion agent, triclosan, ascorbyl stearate; oleoyl sarcosine, dioctyl sulfosuccinate, alkyl sulfate and mixtures thereof.<br>
In addition to their antibacterial activity, it has been discovered that the selected antibacterial agents above have anti-inflammatory activity as demonstrated using the same assays for the anti-inflammatory agents as shown in Table I above. For example, CPC was demonstrated to inhibit several MMP subtypes, with a rank order of potency of MMP13 &gt; MMP1 &gt; MMP9 &gt; MMP3 &gt; MMP2. CPC also inhibited other host pro-inflammatory enzymes including cyclooxygenases COX1 and COX2 and interleukin converting enzyme (ICE). Stannous fluoride was also demonstrated to have activity, with<br>
a rank order of potency of MMP13 &gt; MMP3 &gt; MMP2 &gt; ICE &gt; MMP9 &gt; MMP1. These findings indicate that the anti-gingivitis benefit of oral actives such as CPC and stannous is mediated in part by their anti-inflammatory action and prevention of tissue destruction in addition to their antibacterial action.<br>
A further discovery is that the anti-inflammatory agents above also have some anti-bacterial activity as measured using the in vitro assays for inhibition of bacterial virulence factors. For example, riboflavin, riboflavin monosodium phosphate, epigallocatechin and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were found to have strong inhibitory activity against gingipain, METase, cystalysin and biofilms. Significantly, the efficacy of these agents is confirmed in clinical testing. For example, in a mouse model, riboflavin monosodium phosphate at 10 mM in drinking water significantly reduced bone loss due to infection with P. gingivalis compared to a no treatment control. In a dog gingivitis model, twice,daily rinsing with aqueous riboflavin monosodium phosphate (0.39% by weight) was directionally better than treatment with chlorhexidine (0.12% by weight) for reduction of bleeding sites, and comparable to the chlorhexidine treatment for gingivitis index and inflammation index.<br>
Thus the combination of the present anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory agents provide enhanced efficacy against periodontal disease and its many aspects, specifically, reduction in plaque, reduction in puffy, bleeding gums and gingival inflammation; reduction in pocket depth, halt to the progressive loss of alveolar bone and tooth attachment; improvement in bad breath; and importantly, reduction in systemic inflammation leading to better whole body or systemic health. Most preferred combinations include agents having activity against both bacterial and host factors. The antibacterial agent will typically be present at from about 0.01 % to about 20% by weight of the composition and the anti-inflammatory agent at from about 0.001% to about 10% by weight. Additional Therapeutic Agents<br>
The present compositions may optionally comprise additional therapeutic agents to obtain an optimal effect. Thus, for example, the present compositions may comprise an additional agent such as antimicrobial/antiplaque agents, biofilm inhibiting agents, antibiotics; analgesics and local anesthetic agents; dentinal desensitizing agents; odor masking agents, and other host-response modulating agents.<br>
Antimicrobial antiplaque agents may include, but are not limited to, chlorhexidine (Merck Index, no. 2090), alexidine (Merck Index, no. 222); hexetidine (Merck Index, no.<br>
4624); sanguinarine (Merck Index, no. 8320); benzalkonium chloride (Merck Index, no. 1066); salicylanilide (Merck Index, no. 8299); domiphen bromide (Merck Index, no. '3411); tetradecylpyridinium chloride (TPC); N-tetradecyl-4-ethylpyridinium chloride (TDEPC); octenidine; delmopinol, octapinol, and other piperidino derivatives; nisin preparations; essential oils (including methyl salicylate, eucalyptol, menthol); metal ion sources, such as manganese and silver and analogs and salts of the above antimicrobial antiplaque agents. If present, the antimicrobial antiplaque agents generally comprise at least about 0.01% by weight of the compositions of (he present invention.<br>
Biofilm inhibiting agents may include furanones, cell wall lytic enzymes such as lysozyme, plaque matrix inhibitors such as dextranases and mutanases, and peptides such as bacteriocins, histatins, defensins and cecropins.<br>

Other types of host-response modulating agents that may be incorporated in the present compositions are described in the following paragraphs. H-2 Antagonists<br>
Histamine-2 (H-2 or H2) receptor antagonist compounds (H-2 antagonists) may be used in the oral care composition of the present invention. As used herein, selective H-2 antagonists are compounds that block H-2 receptors, but do not have meaningful activity in blocking histaihine-1 (H-l or HI) receptors. Selective H-2 antagonists stimulate the contraction of smooth muscle from various organs, such as the gut and bronchi; this effect can be suppressed by low concentrations of mepyrarhine - a typical antihistaminic drug. The pharmacological receptors involved m these mepyramine-sensitive histamine responses have been defined as H-1 receptors (Ash ,A.S.F. &amp; H.O. Schild, Brit. J.<br>
Pharmacol Chemother., Vol. 27 (1966), p. 427. Histamine also stimulates the secretion of acid by the stomach (Loew, E.R. &amp; O. Chickering, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., Vol. 48 (1941), p. 65), increases the heart rate (Trendelenburg, U., J. Pharmacol., Vol. 130 (1960), p. 450), and inhibits contractions in the rat uterus (Dews, P.B. &amp; J.D.P. Graham, Brit. J. Pharmacol. Chemother., Vol. 1 (1946), p. 278); these actions cannot be antagonized by mepyramine and related drugs. The H-2 antagonists useful in the oral care compositions or substances are those that blockade the receptors involved in mepyramine-insensitive, non-H-1 (H-2), histamine responses, and do not blockade the receptors involved in mepyramine-sensitive histamine responses.<br>
Selective H-2 antagonists are those compounds found to be H-2 antagonists through their performance in classical preclinical screening tests for H-2 antagonist function. Selective H-2 antagonists are identified as compounds which can be demonstrated to function as competitive or non-competitive inhibitors of histamine-mediated effects in those screening models specifically dependent upon H-2 receptor function, but to lack significant histamine antagonist activity in those screening models dependent upon H-l receptor function. Specifically, this includes compounds that would be classified as described by Black, J.W., W.A.M: Duncan, C.J. Durant, C.R. Ganellin &amp; E.M. Parsons, "Definition and Antagonism of Histamine H2-Receptors", Nature, Vol. 236 (April 21, 1972), pp. 385-390 (Black), as H-2 antagonists if assessed as described by Black through testing with the guinea pig spontaneously beating right atria in vitro assay and the rat gastric acid secretion in vivo assay, but shown to lack in significant H-l antagonist activity relative to H-2 antagonist activity, if assessed as described by Black with either the guinea pig ileum contraction in vitro assay or the rat stomach muscle contraction in vivo assay. Preferably selective H-2 antagonists demonstrate no significant H-l activity at reasonable dosage levels in the above H-l assays. Typical reasonable dosage level is the lowest dosage level at which 90% inhibition of histamine, preferably 99% inhibition of histamine, is achieved in the above H-2 assays.<br>
Selective H-2 antagonists include compounds meeting the above criteria which are disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,294,433 and 5,364,616 to Singer, et al., issued 3/15/94 and 11/15/94 respectively and assigned to Procter &amp; Gamble, wherein the selective H-2 antagonist is preferably selected from the group consisting of cimetidine, etintidine, ranitidine, ICIA-5165, tiotidine, ORF-17578, lupitidine, donetidine, famotidine,<br>

If present, the H-2 antagonist agents generally comprise from about 0.001% to about 20%, more preferably from about 0.01% to about 15%, more preferably still from about 0.1% to about 10%, still more preferably from about 1% to about 5%, by weight of the compositions of the present invention. In addition to cimetidine, preferred H-2 antagonists include ranitidine, famotidine, roxatidine, nizatidine and mifentidine. Anti-inflammatory Agents<br>

If present, the other anti-inflammatory agents generally comprise from about 0.001% to about 5% by weight of the compositions of the present invention. Ketorolac is described in USRE 036,419, issued November 30, 1999; US 5,785,951, issued July 28,1998 and US 5,464,609, issued November 7,1995. Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) Inhibitors<br>
Other matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors may also be present in the oral compositions of the present invention. Metalloproteinases (MPs) are enzymes that often<br>
act on the intercellular matrix, and thus are involved in tissue breakdown and remodeling. Examples of MPs include human skin fibroblast collagenase, human skin fibroblast gelatinase, human sputum collagenase, aggrecanase and gelatinase, and human stromelysin. Collagenase, stromelysin, aggrecanase and related enzymes are thought to be important in mediating the symptomatology of a number of diseases including periodontal disease. Potential therapeutic indications of MP inhibitors have been discussed in the literature, including treatment of: rheumatoid arthritis (Mullins, D. E., et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta. (1983) 695:117-214); osteoarthritis (Henderson, B., et al., Drugs of the Future (1990) 15:495-508); the metastasis of tumor cells (ibid, Broadhurst, M. J., et al., European Patent Application 276,436 (published 1987), Reich, R., et al., 48 Cancer Res. 3307-3312 (1988); and various ulcerations or ulcerative conditions of tissue. For example, ulcerative conditions can result in the cornea as the result of alkali burns or a$ a result of infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acanthamoeba, Herpes simplex and vaccinia viruses. Other examples of conditions characterized by undesired metalloproteinase activity include periodontal disease, epidermolysis bullosa, fever, inflammation and scleritis (DeCicco, et al., WO 95/29892 published November 9,1995).<br>

Modifiers of cell redox status include anti-oxidants such as N-acetyl cysteine and gallic acid; anti-oxidant enzyme inducers such as anethole-dithiothione, oltipraz, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and indole-3-carbinol; nutrients and vitamins such as Co-enzyme Q10, pyrroloquinoline quinbne (PQQ), vitamins A, C, and E, selenium and combinations thereof. Orally Acceptable Carrier Materials<br>
The orally acceptable carrier comprises one or more compatible solid or liquid excipients or diluents which are suitable for topical oral administration. By "compatible," as used herein, is meant that the components of the composition are capable of being commingled without interaction in a manner which would substantially reduce the composition's stability and/or efficacy. Such materials are well known in the art and are readily chosen by one skilled in the art based on the physical, aesthetic and performance properties desired for the compositions being prepared. These carriers may be included at levels typically from about 50% to about 99%, preferably from about 70% to about 98%, and more preferably from about 90% to about 95%, by weight of the oral composition.<br>

For subgingival gels used for delivery of actives into the periodontal pockets or around the periodontal pockets, a "subgingival gel carrier" is chosen as disclosed in, e.g. U.S. Pat Nos. 5,198,220 and 5,242,910, issued March 30, 1993 and Sept 7, 1993, respectively both to Damani. Carriers suitable for the preparation of compositions of the present invention are well known in the art. Their selection will depend on secondary considerations like taste, cost, and shelf stability, etc.<br>

Soluble fluoride ion sources include sodium fluoride, stannous fluoride, indium fluoride, amine fluoride and sodium monofluorophosphate. Stannous fluoride is a preferred soluble fluoride source. This ingredient may serve as both a/the stannous ion source and fluoride source. Norris et al., U.S. Patent 2,946,725, issued July 26,1960, and Widder et al., U.S. Patent 3,678,154 issued July 18,1972, disclose such fluoride sources as well as others.<br>
The present compositions may contain a soluble fluoride ion source capable of providing from about'50 ppm to about 3500 ppm, and preferably from about 500 ppm to about 3000 ppm of free fluoride ions. To deliver thfe desired amount of fluoride ions, fluoride ion sources may be present in the total oral composition at an amount of from about 0.1% to about 5%, preferably from about 0.2% to about 1%, and more preferably from about 0.3% to about 0.6%, by weight of the total composition delivered to the oral cavity. Peroxide Source<br>
The present invention may include a peroxide source in the composition. In addition to whitening, peroxide also provides other benefits to the oral cavity. It has long been recognized that hydrogen peroxide and other peroxygen-compounds are effective in curative and/or prophylactic treatments with respect to caries, dental plaque, gingivitis, periodontitis, mouth odor, recurrent aphthous ulcers, denture irritations, orthodontic appliance lesions, postextraction and postperiodontal surgery, traumatic oral lesions and mucosal infections, herpetic stomatitis and the like. Peroxide-containing agents in the oral cavity exert a chemomechanical action generating thousands of tiny oxygen bubbles produced by interaction with tissue and salivary enzymes. The swishing action of a mouthrinse enhances this inherent chemomechanical action. Such action has been recommended for delivery of other agents into infected gingival crevices. Peroxide thus prevents colonization and multiplication of anaerobic bacteria known to be associated with periodontal disease and is among the preferred antibacterials for use herein .<br>
The peroxide source is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen peroxide, calcium peroxide, urea peroxide, and mixtures thereof. The following amounts represent the amount of peroxide raw material, although the peroxide source may contain ingredients other than the peroxide raw material. The present composition may contain from about 0.01% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 5%, more preferably from about 0.2% to about 3%, and most preferably from about 0.3% to about 0.8% of a peroxide source, by weight of the oral composition. Alkali Metal Bicarbonate Salt<br>
The present invention may also include an alkali metal bicarbonate salt. Sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda, is the preferred alkali metal bicarbonate salt As indicated above, baking soda has some antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity and thus may be used as an active ingredient. The alkali metal bicarbonate salt also functions as a buffering agent. The present composition may contain from about 0.5% to about 50%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 30%, more preferably from about 2% to about 20%, and most preferably from about 5% to about 18% of an alkali metal bicarbonate salt, by weight of the oral composition. Anticalculus Agent<br>
The present compositions may optionally include an anticalculus agent, which are materials with chelating activity and effective in reducing mineral deposition related to calculus formation. Such chelating agents are able to complex calcium found in the cell walls of the bacteria and can also disrupt plaque by removing calcium from the calcium bridges which help hold this biomass intact. However, it is not desired to use a chelating agent which has an affinity for calcium that is too high, as this may result in tooth demineralization, which is contrary to the objects and intentions of the present invention. Suitable chelating agents will generally have a calcium binding constant of about 101 to 10s to provide improved cleaning with reduced plaque and calculus formation. Chelating agents also have the ability to complex with metallic ions and thus can be used to stabilize stannbus if present in the compositions.<br>
Such chelating agents useful for their anticalculus activity include pyroptosphates, fripblyphoSphates, and diphosphonates such as EHDP and AHP. The pyrophosphate salts useful as a source of pyrophosphate ion in the present compositions include the dialkali metal pyrophosphate salts, tetraalkali metal pyrophosphate salts, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Disodium dihydrogen pyrophosphate (Na2H2P2O7), tetrasodium pyrophosphate (Na4P2O7), and tetrapotassium pyrophosphate (K4P2O7) in their<br>
unhydrated as well as hydrated forms are the preferred species. In compositions of the present invention, the pyrophosphate salt may be present in one of three ways: predominately dissolved, predominately undissolved, or a mixture of dissolved and undissolved pyrophosphate.<br>
Compositions comprising predominately dissolved pyrophosphate refer to compositions where at least one pyrophosphate ion source is in an amount sufficient to provide at least about 1.0% free pyrophosphate ions. The amount of free pyrophosphate ions may be from about 1% to about 15%, from about 1.5% to about 10% in one embodiment, and from about 2% to about 6% in another embodiment. Free pyrophosphate ions may be present in a variety of protonated states depending on the pH of the composition.<br>
Compositions comprising predominately undissolved pyrophosphate refer to compositions containing no more than about 20% of the total pyrophosphate salt dissolved in the composition, preferably less than about 10% of the total pyrophosphate dissolved in the composition. Tetrasodium pyrophosphate salt is the preferred pyrophosphate salt in these compositions. Tetrasodium pyrophosphate may be the anhydrous salt form or the decahydrate form, or any other species stable in solid form in the dentifrice compositions. The salt is in its solid particle form, which may be its crystalline and/or amorphous state, with the particle size of the salt preferably being small enough to be aesthetically acceptable and readily soluble during use. The amount of pyrophosphate salt useful in making these compositions is any tartar control effective amount, generally from about 1.5% to about 15%, preferably from about 2% to about 10%, and most preferably from about 3% to about 8%, by weight of the dentifrice composition.<br>
Compositions may also comprise a mixture of dissolved and undissolved pyrophosphate salts. Any of the above mentioned pyrophosphate salts may be used.<br>
The pyrophosphate salts are described in more detail in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 17, Wiley-Interscience Publishers (1982).<br>

Other suitable amphoteric surfactants are betaines, specifically cocamidopropyl betaine. Mixtures of amphoteric surfactants can also be employed. Many of the suitable nonionic and amphoteric surfactants are disclosed by Gieske et al., U.S. Patent 4,051,234, issued September 27, 1977. The present composition typically comprises one or more surfactants each at a level of from about 0.25% to about 12%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 8%, and most preferably from about 1% to about 6%, by weight of the composition. Additional Carrier Materials<br>
Other emulsifying agents that may be used in the present compositions include polymeric emulsifiers such as the Pemulen® series available from B.F. Goodrich, and which are predominantly migh molecular weigh polyacrylic acid polymers useful as<br>
Titanium dioxide may also be added to the present composition. Titanium dioxide is a white powder which adds opacity to the compositions. Titanium dioxide generally comprises from about 0.25% to about 5% by weight of dentifrice compositions.<br>
Coloring agents may also be added to the present composition. The coloring agent may be in the form of an aqueous solution, preferably 1% coloring agent in a solution of water. Color solutions generally comprise from about 0.01% to about 5%, by weight of the composition.<br>
Other optional agents that may be used in the present compositions include dimethicone copolyols selected from alkyl- and alkoxy-dimethicone copolyols, such as C12 to C20 alkyl dimethicone copolyols and mixtures thereof. Highly preferred is cetyl dimethicone copolyol marketed under the trade name Abil EM90. The dimethicone copolyol is generally present in a level of from about 0.01% to about 25%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 5%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 1.5% by weight. The dimethicone copolyols aid in providing positive tooth feel benefits. Composition Use<br>
A safe and effective amount of the compositions of the present invention comprising the combination of one or more antibacterial agents and anti-inflammatory agents may be topically applied to the mucosal tissue of the oral cavity, to the gingival tissue of the oral cavity, and/or to the surface of the teeth, for the treatment or prevention of the above mentioned diseases or conditions of the oral cavity of subjects, in several conventional ways. The subject may be any person or animal in need of treatment or prevention of oral conditions including plaque, gingivitis, and periodontitis. By "annual" is meant to include in particular household pets or other domestic animals, or animals kept in captivity.<br>
For example, the gingival or mucosal tissue may be rinsed with a solution (e.g., mouth rinse, mouth spray); or if the composition is a dentifrice (e.g., toothpaste, tooth gel or tooth powder), the gingival/mucosal tissue or teeth is bathed in the liquid and/or lather generated by brushing the teeth. Other non-limiting examples include applying a non-abrasive gel or paste directly to the gingival/mucosal tissue or to the teeth with or without an oral care appliance described below; clewing gum; chewing or sucking on a breath tablet or lozenge. Preferred methods of topical oral application of the present compositions are via rinsing with a mouth rinse solution and via brushing with a<br>
dentifrice. Other methods of topically applying the present compositions to the gingival/mucosal tissue and the surfaces of the teeth are apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
The concentrations of antibacterial agent and anti-inflammatory agent in the compositions of the present invention depend on the type of composition (e.g., toothpaste, mouth rinse, lozenge, gum, etc.) used to apply composition to the gingival/mucosal tissue and/or the teeth, due to differences in efficiency of the compositions contacting the tissue and teeth, and due also to the amount of the composition generally used. The concentration will also depend on the specific agents being used and on the disease or condition being treated. Typically the antibacterial agent will be present in the compositions from about 0.01% to about 20% by weight and the anti-inflammatory agent from about 0.001% to about 10% by weight. These amounts refer to the amount of antibacterial or anti-inflammatory active agents in the source used. For example, tea polyphenols may be incorporated in the composition as a tea extract which will typically contain other components such as tannic acid, caffeine, vitamins and polysaccharides. The tea polyphenols may comprise from 85 % to 95% of the extract.<br>
The present compositions are preferably applied to the gingival/mucosal tissue and/or the teeth (for example, by rinsing with a mouthrinse, directly applying a non-abrasive gel with or without a device, applying a dentifrice or a tooth gel with a toothbrush, sucking or chewing a lozenge or breathmint, etc.) preferably for at least about 10 seconds, preferably from about 20 seconds to about 10 minutes, more preferably from about 30 seconds to about 60 seconds. The method often involves expectoration of most of the composition following such contact. The frequency of such contact is preferably from about once per week to about four times per day, more preferably from about thrice per week to about three times per day, even more preferably from about once per day to about twice per day. The period of such treatment typically ranges from about one day to a lifetime. For particular oral care diseases or conditions the duration of treatment depends on the severity of the oral disease or condition being treated, the particular delivery form utilized and the patient's response to treatment. If delivery to the periodontal pockets is desirable, such as with the treatment of periodontal disease, a motfttirihse cafi be delivered to the penoo'ontal pocket using a syringe or water injection device. These devices are known to one skilled in the art. Devices of this type include<br>
"Water Pik" by Teledyne Corporation. After irrigating, the subject can swish the rinse in the mouth to also cover the dorsal tongue and other gingival and mucosal surfaces. In addition a toothpaste, non-abrasive gel, toothgel, etc. can be brushed onto the tongue surface and other gingival and mucosal tissues of die oral cavity.<br>
The present compositions may also be delivered to tissues and/or spaces within the oral cavity using electromechanical devices such as metering devices, targeted application devices and cleaning or integrated oral hygiene systems.<br>
For treating oral tissue wounds and aiding tissue regeneration, fluid subgingival gel compositions that can be inserted via syringe and either a needle or catheter directly into the areas needing treatment, such as the periodontal cavities, are very useful and convenient. Preferred gel-like fluid compositions are those that transform unto near solid phase in the presence of aqueous fluid such as water or crevicular fluid, such gels typically comprising from 0.02 % to 6% of the active agent(s) in a carrier system comprising a poly(lactyl-co-glycolide) copolymer and solvent such as propylene carbonate . The hardened composition is thus retained at the site of application, and since the polymeric carrier undergoes slow degradation via hydrolysis, the active agent(s) continue to release in a sustained manner from such compositions.<br>
Pet care products such as foods, chews and toys may be formulated to contain the the present compositions. The active agent(s) may be incorporated for example, into a relatively supple but strong and durable material such as rawhide, ropes made from natural or synthetic fibers, and polymeric articles made from nylon, polyester or thermoplastic polyurethane. As the animal chews, licks or gnaws the product, incorporated active agents are released' into the animal's oral cavity into a salivary medium, comparable to an effective brushing or rinsing. In pet food embodiments, the active agent(s) may be incorporated as an ingredient or admixed into a pet food such as for example, a kibbled, semi-moist, or canned food. Highly preferred food embodiments include carriers that tend to increase residence time of the food in the oral cavity. For example, the active agent can be incorporated in a carrier that will tend to stick or adhere to the teeth, in order that a certain amount of product will remain in the mouth and not be ingested immediately. The present compositions may also be incorporated into other pet care products including nutritional supplements and drinking water additives.<br>
The following non-limiting examples further describe preferred embodiments within the scope of the present invention. The examples are given solely for illustration and are not to be construed as limitations of this invention as many variations thereof are possible without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.<br>

Example III In Vivo Efficacy Testing<br>
A study was conducted to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of a riboflavin + cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC) rinse in a canine model. At the beginning of the study beagle subjects received a prophylaxis. Approximately one week later, they were graded for baseline Gingival Index (GI) and Plaque Index. Gingival Index is a 0-3 scale (0=no inflammation; l=inflammation present, gingiva is red; 2=bleeding upon probing; 3=spontaneous bleeding). Plaque Index is percent plaque coverage of each tooth. The dogs were randomly allocated into treatment groups balanced on baseline inflammation index (IT) scores using a SAS randomization program. Treatments began the day after allocation. The animals were treated topically on the teeth/gingiva with a spray mist bottle twice daily during the week and once daily on weekends for thirty days (30 ml/treatment). At the end of thirty days, the animals received final clinical grading.<br>
Clinical gradings were done at baseline and final evaluation. For gingival index, the buccal surfaces of the following teeth in all four quadrants were measured for a total of twenty teeth: first molar, fourth, third and second premolars and first canine. Three scores were determined for each tooth for sixty scores. The maximum score of the three buccal surfaces per tooth was recorded. Then the average of these scores was computed (Mean Tooth-Level Score). The data were analyzed with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with the respective baseline as the model covariate using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). Plaque was measured by percent coverage of each tooth. The plaque is disclosed with a 1% basic fuchsin solution applied with a cotton tipped applicator. Water is sprayed to remove excessive staining solution. The percentage of purple is also recorded in 5% increments for each tooth. The plaque data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results are summarized below.<br>
These results demonstrate that the combination of an anti-inflammatory agent (riboflavin) and an anti-bacterial agent (CP.C) provides enhanced anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis efficacy. Indeed the combination provides efficacy even at lower levels of CPC. This is advantageous since quaternary ammonium antimicrobials such as CPC while efficacious, are known to impart unpleasant taste and to cause staining or discoloration of teeth particularly at concentrations that have been employed to provide efficacy. By Using such lower levels, the unpleasant taste and the tendency to cause<br>
dental stain will both be avoided. The present compositions therefore may not need the<br>
anti-staining and taste-masking additives that have been used in the art to address the negative aspects associated with CPC.<br><br>
