				<td>The present invention concerns a polypropylene composition, comprising at least one propylene copolymer component, a method for preparing same, a catalyst, suitable for the preparation of the polypropylene composition and the use of the polypropylene composition for the formation of wide variety of articles, such as preferably films and thermoformed as well as molded articles, particularly mouldings.<br>
Description of prior art<br>
Polypropylene   compositions   are   known   in  'the   art.   Polypropylene   compositions comprising a propylene copolymer component are in particular used for preparing mouldings. Such applications require, on the one hand a high degree of transparency of the polypropylene composition, while requiring on the other hand also satisfactory mechanical properties. In the art, it is well known in this respect to improve the optical properties of a polypropylene composition by adding nucleating agents, also designated clarifiers. The European patent application EP 1 514 893 A1, for example, discloses polypropylene blown films comprising nucleating agents, selected for example from phosphoric acid ester metal salts as well as polymeric nucleating agents, for example vinyl cycloalkane polymers. Concerning propylene copolymers this application discloses copolymer components having MFR values of about 1.5. Similar nucleating agents are also disclosed in the international applications WO 99/24478 and WO 99/24479.<br>
The international application WO 2004/055101 discloses a heterophasic propylene copolymer, containing nucleating agents, selected from phosphate-derived nucleating agents, sorbitol-derived nucleating agents, metal salts of aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acids as nucleating agents, polymeric nucleating agents, such as polyvinyl cyclohexane and inorganic nucleating agents, such as talc.<br>
The US patent 4,551,501 finally discloses a crystalline propylene polymer composition comprising a blend of a crystalline polypropylene with a polymer of a vinyl cycloalkane. This US patent discloses that the polymer of the vinyl cycloalkane is introduced into the polymer composition using master batch technology.<br>
In WO 2005026240 is disclosed a polypropylene based blown film which contains a clarifier containing phosphate-based alpha-nucleating agent and/pr polymeric alpha-nucleating agents. However, no example of the use of polymeric nucleating is disclosed.<br>
A drawback of the prior art compositions, however, is the fact that a sufficient transparency often cannot be obtained, in particular with polymeric nucleating agents. Approaches using the master batch technology often suffer from the drawback that it is very troublesome to incorporate by mechanical blending high amounts of nucleating agents with a satisfactory degree of evenness of the distribution into a polymer composition. On the other hand low molecular weight nucleating agents, such as sorbitol-derived nucleating agents, are relatively costly which is unfavourable, since high amounts thereof are often needed. Furthermore, such low molecular weight components may give rise to further problems during the lifetime of a manufactured product, such as migration, blooming etc., resulting in a deterioration of the product quality, with respect to the optical properties such as haze and transparency as well as with respect to physical properties.<br>
Object of the present invention<br>
Accordingly it is the object of the present invention to provide a further polypropylene composition overcoming the drawback associated with the prior art. In particular, the present invention aims at providing an advantageous polypropylene composition comprising at least one propylene copolymer component, wherein satisfactory optical properties, in particular haze values and transparency can be obtained in a simple and reliable manner. In this respect, the present invention also aims at providing a suitable process for preparing a polypropylene composition satisfying the requirements as outlined above and suitable catalysts therefor.<br>
Short description of the invention<br>
The present invention solves the above-outlined object by providing a polypropylene composition as defined in claim 1 or 2. Preferred embodiments of the polypropylene composition are defined in sub-claims 3 to 17. The present invention furthermore provides a polymerization catalyst as defined in claim 18. Preferred embodiments of the catalyst are defined in sub-claims 19 to 21. Furthermore, the present invention provides<br>
a process for producing a polypropylene composition as defined in claims 22 and 23 and also the use as defined in claim 24.<br>
Description of the figures<br>
Figure 1 shows the relationship between haze and the amount of PVCH in the polymer composition, for propylene copolymers in accordance with the present invention and two comparative examples (see Table 1). Figure 2 shows the relationship between haze and the weight ratio of VCH to catalyst for the examples as derivable from Table 1.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
As identified in claims 1 and 2 the polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention is characterized by the common feature that a specific combination of MFR2 and haze is provided, which may be expressed either by defining specific MFR2 values of 15g/10min or less in combination with a haze value of below 55% when determined according to ASTMD 1003 with 2mm thick injection molded plaque samples, as in claim 2, or by defining a lower limit for the MFR2 value of 0.5g/10 min and a haze definition by means of an inequality including the parameters MFR2, comonomer content and amount of polymeric nucleating agent, as done in claim 1. The following specification describes further embodiments which are valid for the polypropylene composition according to claim 1 as well as, independently, for the polypropylenen composition according to claim 2. Claims 1 and 2 are accordingly alternatives which describe novel and improved polypropylene compositions.<br>
However, the present invention also contemplates and claims polypropylene compositions being defined by specific MFR2 values of 15g/10min or less in combination with a haze value of below 55% when determined according to ASTMD 1003 with 2mm thick injection molded plaque samples, as in claim 2, and by defining a lower limit for the MFR2 value of 0.5g/10 min and a haze definition by means of an inequality including the parameters MFR2, comonomer content and amount of polymeric nucleating agent, as done in claim 1. Accordingly the present invention is also directed to a polypropylene composition being defined by a combination of claims 1 and 2. The following description thus concerns preferred embodiments for the subject-matter of claim 2 and for the<br>
subject-matter of claim 1, individually, as well as for the combination of subject-matters of claims 1 and 2.<br>
Further, for the present invention a polypropylene composition, comprising<br>
A)	at least one propylene copolymer component arid<br>
B)	a polymeric nucleating agent<br>
wherein the mixture of A) and B) has a MFR2 of 15 g/10 min or less as measured according to ISO 1133 (230°C, 2.16 kg load) and a haze, measured according to ASTMD 1003 in the form of an injection molded test piece having a thickness of 2 mm of below 55%, is a preferred embodiment of the polypropylene composition as defined in claim 1.<br>
Finally, for the present invention a polypropylene composition, comprising<br>
A)	at least one propylene copolymer component and<br>
B)	a polymeric nucleating agent,<br>
wherein the mixture of A) and B) has a MFR2 of 0.5 g/10 min or more as measured according to ISO 1133 (230°C, 2.16 kg load) and a haze, measured according to ASTMD 1003 in the form of an injection molded test piece having a thickness of 2 mm which satisfies the following relation:<br>
Haze (%) 
with    N = amount of polymeric nucleating agent in the propylene copolymer in ppm (weight)<br>
MFR2 = MFR2 of the mixture of A) and B) (ISO 1133, 230°C, 2.16 kg load)<br>
Z = comonomer content in the propylene copolymer component in wt-%, is a preferred embodiment of the polypropylene composition as defined in claim 2.<br>
The modality with respect to molecular weight distribution and thus with respect to melt flow ratio is not critical. Thus the polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention may be unimodal or multimodal including bimodal with respect to molecular weight distribution. The polypropylene composition of the invention may also be multimodal with respect to comonomer distribution.<br>
Accordingly, the polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention comprises at least one propylene copolymer component. Preferably the at least one propylene copolymer component is a random copolymer component, comprising propylene and at least one comonomer selected from ethylene, and C4 and higher a-olefins such as C4-C12, preferably C4 to C10, ore preferably C4 to C8 a-olefins, which may be linear, branched, aliphatic, cyclic, saturated, partially unsaturated or aromatic. Preferred as comonomer is ethylene.<br>
By the term "random copolymer" is meant herein that the comonomer in said copolymer is distributed randomly, i.e. by statistical insertion of the comonomer units, within the copolymer chain. Said term "random" copolymer is generally known and used in the art and abbreviated herein below as "polypropylene copolymer".<br>
In one embodiment the propylene copolymer component is unimodalwith respect to MWD and with respect to the comonomer content. The polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention may, however, also comprise more than one propylene copolymer component, preferably two components giving a bimodal composition, with respect to MWD and/ or comonomer content.<br>
Concerning suitable ranges of comonomer content, the present invention contemplates the use of comonomer contents in usual amounts, for example up to 20 wt%. Suitable lower limits are 0.5 and 1 wt%, so that suitable ranges for comonomer content are in particular 2 to 15 wt%, 2.5 to 10 wt%, and in particular 3 to 7 wt%.<br>
As identified above and as further explained below, the propylene copolymer component may also be bimodal or multimodal with respect to the comonomer content, meaning that different propylene copolymer components may be mixed with each other, differing with respect to the type of comonomer contained and/or with respect to the amount of comonomer contained. The skilled person is readily aware of how such bimodal or<br>
multimodal propylene copolymer components can be obtained, for example by mechanical blending including mixing and melt blending processes and any combinations thereof as well as in-situ blending during the polymerisation process of the propylene polymer component(s) as outlined further below.<br>
The mixture of A) and B) as defined in claim 1 has a MFR2 of from 0.5 g/10min or more (determined as defined below), preferably the MFR2 is 2 g/10min or more, and in some embodiments from 1 to 20 g/10min or from 1 to 10 g/10min.<br>
When the polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention is at least bimodal with respect to the molecular weight distribution concerning the propylene copolymer components, such an embodiment may be realized by including two different propylene copolymer components, differing at least with respect to the MFR2 and/or the comonomer content.<br>
Such a bimodal embodiment may be exemplified by a mixture of a lower molecular weight component with a higher molecular weight component. The lower molecular weight (LMW) component has a higher MFR2 than the higher molecular weight (HMW) component. The amount of the LMW component is typically between 30 to 70 wt%, preferably 40 to 60 wt% of the total amount of propylene copolymer. The amount of the HMW component is typically between 30 to 70 wt%, preferably 40 to 60 wt% of the total amount of propylene copolymer.<br>
In another bimodal embodiments, the ratio between the MFR2 of LMW component and MFR2 of HMW component is typically from 1 up to 400, preferably at least 20, preferably at least 30, more preferably at least 40. The upper limit of said ratio may be preferably up to 200. Other embodiments with lower ratios are, however, also envisaged by the present invention.<br>
The polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention may also comprise additional propylene components, including propylene homopolymers, and in particular also further propylene homopolymers and/or propylene copolymers with ethylene yielding heterophasic propylene compositions, comprising a matrix phase and a dispersed phase.<br>
The at least one propylene copolymer component preferably has a shear thinning index SHI0/50 of less than 10, preferably less than 8. A suitable range is in particular from 2 to 8.<br>
Iri accordance with the present invention, it is furthermore preferred that the polypropylene composition has a tensile modulus of below 1700 MPa, the lower limit typically being 500 MPa, such as 600 to 1500 MPa.<br>
In one embodiment of a unimodal polypropylene composition the polydispersity index (PI) is less than 5, preferably less than 3.5, preferably from 2 to 4.<br>
XS is not critical and depends on the ethylene content desired for the end polymer.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferred for the unimodal polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention to have a molecular weight distribution, MWD, as calculated from Mw/M,, values obtained from the size exclusion chromatography (SEC, also known as GPC) of preferably less than 10, in particular less than 5, lower limit being 2.<br>
The polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention is furthermore characterized in that it comprises a polymeric nucleating agent. Any known polymeric nucleating agent may be employed, preferably vinyl cylcoalkane and/or vinyl alkane. A preferred example of such a polymeric nucleating agent is a vinyl polymer, such as a vinyl polymer derived from monomers of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 and R2, together with the carbon atom they are attached to, form an optionally substituted saturated or unsaturated or aromatic ring or a fused ring system, wherein the ring or fused ring moiety contains four to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 5 to 12 membered saturated or unsaturated or aromatic ring or a fused ring system or independently represent a linear or branched C4-C30alkane, C4-C20cycloalkane or G4-C20aromatic ring. Preferably, R1 and R2, together with the C-atom they are attached to, form a five- or six-membered saturated or unsaturated or aromatic ring or independently represent a lower alkyl group comprising from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Preferred vinyl compounds for the preparation of a polymeric nucleating agent to be used in accordance with the present invention are in particular vinyl cycloalkanes,  in particular vinyl<br>
cyclohexane (VCH), vinyl cyclopentane, and vinyl-2-methyl cyclohexane, 3-methyl-l-butene, 3-ethyl-1-hexene, 3-methyM-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene or mixtures thereof. VCH is a particularly preferred monomer.<br>
The polymeric nucleating agent usually is present in the final product in an amount of from more than 15 ppm, such as more 20 ppm, (based on the weight of the polypropylene composition). Preferably this agent is present in the polypropylene composition in a range of from 20 to 800 ppm, more preferably in an amount of more than 50 ppm, such as 100 to 600 ppm.<br>
The polymeric nucleating agent usually is present in an amount of from 15 to 1000 ppm preferably this agent is present in the polypropylene composition<br>
The use of the polymer nucleating agent in accordance with the present invention enables the preparation of polypropylene compositions having very satisfactory optical properties and satisfactory mechanical properties, so that it is not required for the compositions in accordance with the present invention to contain low molecular weight nucleating agents, in particular costly sorbitol-derived nucleating agents. Accordingly, the present invention provides an alternative means for improving the transparency of propylene copolymer compositions, especially in end applications wherein the use of low molecular weight nucleating agents as cfarifiers is not desirable, such as in many medical and food applications with strict purity requirements and regulations.<br>
Moreover, the present invention achieves highly advantageous haze values of the polypropylene composition as defined herein using relatively low amounts of polymeric nucleating agents. The low molecular weight nucleating agents require usually-higher amounts to obtain comparable results in transparency.<br>
As defined in claim 1 of the present application, the polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention comprising the essential components as defined above, i.e. the at least one propylene copolymer component A) and the polymeric nucleating agent B), enables the preparation of polypropylene compositions giving rise to compositions having a haze, measured in the form of an injection molded test piece having a thickness of 2 mm (test method identified below) satisfying the following relation:<br>
Haze (%) 
with N = amount of polymeric nucleating agent in the propylene copolymer component in ppm (weight)<br>
MFR2 = MFR2 of the mixture of A) and B), determined as defined in claim 1<br>
Z = comonomer content in the propylene copolymer component in wt-%<br>
As outlined in the present application the comonomer preferably is ethylene. It is also preferred when the polymeric nucleating agent is PVCH, as disclosed herein. The preferred ranges for N, MFR2 and Z are, independently as follows:<br>
N: from 15 to 1000 ppm<br>
MFR2: from 1 to 50 g/10 min<br>
Z: from 0.5 to 7 wt%.<br>
For each of the ranges illustrated above the further preferred embodiments as derivable from the present application likewise apply.<br>
The polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention may be prepared by any suitable process, including in particular blending processes such as mechanical blending including mixing and melt blending processes and any combinations thereof as well as in-situ blending during the polymerisation process of the propylene polymer component(s). Such blending processes can be carried out by methods known to the skilled person, including batch processes and continuous processes.<br>
It is also possible to prepare the polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention by sequential polymerization processes, wherein the single components of the polypropylene composition are prepared, one after the other, in the presence of the already prepared components. Such a process for preparing the polypropylene composition is preferred and yields a reactor blend or reactor made polymer composition, which means herein the reaction product obtained from a<br>
polymerization reaction wherein, for example, the propylene copolymer component is polymerized in the presence of the polymeric nucleating agent.<br>
The reactor made polymer composition (in-situ blend) defines a different embodiment compared to a mechanical blend of a polymer with a nucleating agent,, wherein thepolymer is first produced in the absence of a polymeric nucleating agent and is then trended mechanically with the polymeric nucleating agent or with a small amount of nucleated polymer (so-called master batch technology) in order to introduce the polymeric nucleating agent into the polymer mixture. The preparation of a reactor made polymer composition ensures the preparation of a homogenous mixture of the components, for example a homogenously distributed polymeric nucleating agent in the polypropylene composition, even at high concentrations of polymer nucleating agent. As outlined above, the reactor made polymer composition is a preferred embodiment of the present invention, although also mechanical blends prepared, for example, by using master batch technology are envisaged by the present invention.<br>
Similar considerations also apply with respect to the preparation of multimodal including bimodal polypropylene compositions, in particular the compositions comprising two different propylene copolymer components with differing MFR2 values and/or comonomer contents. While such multimodal or bimodal components may also be prepared by mechanical blending processes, it is preferred in accordance with the present invention to provide such multimodal or bimodal compositions in the form of a reactor made compositions, meaning that the second (or any further) component is prepared in the presence of the first component (or any preceding components).<br>
A suitable process for preparing reactor made compositions is outlined below.<br>
The propylene copolymer component to be employed in accordance with the present invention in principle can be prepared by any polymerization method, including solution, slurry and gas phase polymerization. Slurry polymerization preferably designates a bulk polymerization. Bulk polymerization defines a polymerization in a reaction medium comprising at least 60 wt% monomer.<br>
In case of the unimodal polypropylene copolymer the copolymer is unimodal with respect to MWD and comonomer content, whereby the copolymer can be polymerised in a single<br>
stage batch or preferably continuous process. The polymerisation can be a slurry or gas phase, preferably a slurry, such as loop, polymerisation. Alternatively, the unimodal polymer may be produced in a multistage process using at each stage process conditions which result in similar polymer properties.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the polypropylene composition comprises two different propylene copolymer components,  preferably differing in particular with respect to MFR2 and/or comonomer content. Such a mixture of two propylene copolymer components preferably may be produced in accordance with the present invention in a multistage process using one or more polymerization reactors, which may be the same or different, for example, at least slurry-slurry, gas phase-gas phase or any combination of slurry and gas phase polymerization. Each stage may be effected in parallel or sequentially using same or different polymerization methods. Advantageously, the above-mentioned mixture of the two different propylene copolymer components is prepared in a sequence comprising at least one slurry polymerization and at least one gas phase polymerization. Suitably, the slurry polymerization is the first polymerization step, followed by a gas phase polymerization. This order, however, may also be reversed. In the case of such a sequential polymerization reaction, each component may be produced in any order by carrying out the polymerization in each step, except the first step, in the presence of the polymer component formed in the preceding step. Preferably, the catalyst used in the preceding step is also present in the subsequent polymerization step. Alternatively, it is also possible to add additional quantities of the identical catalyst or of a different catalyst in a subsequent polymerization step.<br>
A suitable possibility of forming a multimodal propylene copolymer component is a polymerization sequence comprising a first homo or copolymerization step in a slurry reactor, preferably a loop reactor, followed by a copolymerization step in a gas phase reactor, wherein the second propylene copolymer component is prepared in the presence of the already prepared first propylene copolymer component (prepared in the slurry reactor).<br>
A preferred multistage process is the above-identified slurry-gas phase process, such as developed by Borealis and known as the Borstar® technology. In this respect, reference<br>
is made to the European applications EP 0 887 379 A1 and EP 517 868 A1, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The above-outlined description of preferred and suitable multistage polymerization processes have been exemplified in connection with the preparation of compositions comprising different propylene copolymer components. These processes may, however, also be advantageously employed in order to prepare the above-outlined compositions in accordance with the present invention which not only comprise at least one propylene copolymer component but also propylene homopolymer component. With respect to the above-outlined preferred processes for preparing compositions in accordance with the present invention, it is, for example, envisaged to prepare first the propylene homo polymer component in the first stage of the reaction, for example in a slurry reaction (loop reactor) while preparing a propylene copolymer component then in an  a subsequent gas phase reaction (for example, fluidized bed reactor) in order to prepare a reactor blend in accordance with the present invention. According to this embodiment, it is also preferred to use a modified catalyst as discussed below in order to incorporate the polymeric nucleating agent already into the polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention during the preparation thereof. The above-outlined sequence of reaction steps of preparing the  copolymer component and the homopolymer component may, however! also be reversed in order, i.e. it is also contemplated to first prepare a propylene homopolymer component in a slurry reaction, followed by feeding the reaction product to a subsequent reaction, suitably a gas phase reaction in order to prepare the at least one propylene copolymer component in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Using these approaches, it is possible to prepare reactor blends in accordance with the present invention, i.e. comprising the polymeric nucleating agent and the at least one propylene copolymer component, in intimate admixture with a further component, such as the propylene homopolymer component identified above.<br>
Naturally, the multimodal copolymer composition of the invention may also have two or more copolymer components which differ with respect to the type of comonomer(s) used to prepare the two or more propylene copolymer components.<br>
In the case of multimodal compositions, at least with respect to the molecular weight distribution or MFR2, the composition comprises a low molecular weight component (LMW) and a higher molecular weight component (HMW). The LMW component and the HMW component are made in different steps in any order. Preferably, typically when a Ziegler-Natta catalyst is used, the HMW fraction is produced in the first step and the LMW fraction is produced in the subsequent step, in the presence of the HMW fraction.<br>
One example of a suitable sequential polymerization method for preparing multimodal, including bimodal compositions as exemplified above, is a process employing first a slurry reactor, for example a loop reactor, followed by a second polymerization in a gas phase reactor. Such a reaction sequence provides a reactor blend of different propylene copolymers for which the MFR2 values can be adjusted as, in principle, known to the skilled person during the sequential polymerization steps, ft is of course possible and also envisaged by the present invention to carry out the first reaction in a gas phase reactor while the second polymerization is earned out in a slurry reactor, for example a loop reactor. The process as discussed above, comprising at least two polymerization steps, is advantageous in view of the fact that it provides easily controllable reaction steps enabling the preparation of a desired reactor blend of propylene copolymers. The polymerization steps may be adjusted, for example, by appropriately selecting monomer feed, comonomer feed, hydrogen feed, temperature, pressure, type and amount of catalyst, in order to suitably adjust the properties of the polymerization products obtained.<br>
Optionally, the unimodal or multimodal processes described above can further comprise a prepoiymerisation step preceding the polymerization of above mentioned propylene polymer component(s) in a manner known in the field.<br>
Such a process can be carried out using any suitable catalyst for the preparation of propylene polymers, including single site catalyst, including metallocenes and non-metallocenes, and Ziegler-Natta. Preferably, the process as discussed above is carried out using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst, in particular a high yield Ziegler-Natta catalyst (so called fourth and fifth generation type to differentiate from low yield, so called second generation Ziegler-Natta catalysts). A suitable Ziegler-Natta catalyst to be employed in accordance with the present invention comprises a catalyst component, a co-catalyst<br>

All raw materials were essentially free from water and air and all material additions to the reactors and the different steps were done under inert conditions.<br>
200 mi Ondina oil 68 was added to a 1 litre glass reactor and heated to 85 °C and kept there for two hours while purging with nitrogen. While keeping about 0,5 bar nitrogen pressure in the reactor the temperature was decreased to 15 °C and 4.1 g triethyl aluminium, 1.8 ml dicyclopentyl dimethoxy silane and 18.1 g highly active and stereospecific Ziegler Natta catalyst (ZN catalyst) was added. The ZN catalyst was made according to Finnish patent No. 88047, and had Ti content 2.1 w-%. 36.2 g vinyl cyclohexane (VCH) (corresponds to VCH/catalyst weight ratio 2.0) was added during 23 minutes. The temperature was increased to 65 °C and kept there for 20 hours. 38 ml heated (85 °C) and nitrogen purged White Protopet wax was added. Finally the reactor was cooled to about 30 °C and samples of the VCH modified catalyst were taken for polymerization tests and for determining unreacted VCH content with gas chromatography.<br>
Polymerization of propylene with the VCH modified catalyst was done in a 5 litre reactor with stirrer. 0.114 ml TEA (=AI/Ti molar ratio 250), 0.019 ml donor dicyclopentyl dimethoxy silane (=AI/Do molar ratio 10) and 30 ml pentane were mixed and allowed to react for 5 minutes. Half of the mixture was added to the reactor and the other half was mixed with 81 mg of the catalyst/oil/wax mixture. After 10 minutes the catalyst/oil/wax/TEA/donor dicyclopentyl dimethoxy silane /pentane mixture was added to the reactor. 550 mmol hydrogen and 1400 gram propylene were added into the reactor and temperature was raised to 80 °C within 20 minutes while mixing. In total 39 g<br>

This example was done in accordance with Example 1, except that the catalyst used was not VCH modified (contained no polyVCH), hydrogen amount was 450 mmol and polymerisation temperature was 75 °C. The final polymer contained 3.1 w-% ethylene and had haze 88.3 %. The other results are seen in Table 1.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
The examples 6 to 12 were prepared in a continuous multistage process in pilot scale comprising a loop reactor and a fluidised bed gas phase reactor as follows:<br>
The catalyst used was a highly active, stereospecific transesterified MgCI2-supported Ziegler-Natta catalyst prepared analogously to Example 1.   The catalysts are further<br>
characterized in Table 2. The catalyst of examples 6 to 9, 11 and 12 was modified with VCH as disclosed in Example 1, except that the weight ratio of VCH:catalyst was 10:1 and pentane was used for the modification medium. The catalyst of Example 10 was modified with VCH as disclosed in Example 1, except that the weight ratio of VCHxatalyst was 3:1. The catalyst was prepolymerjsed in a known manner in the presence of propylene and the co-catalyst in a separate prepolymerisation step. Then propylene, ethylene and hydrogen were fed together with the prepolymerised catalyst into the loop reactor which operated as a bulk reactor at conditions given in Table 2 (production of loop fraction). Then the polymer slurry stream was fed from the loop reactor into the gas phase reactor and more propylene, ethylene and hydrogen were fed in the gas phase reactor (production of the gas phase reactor fraction in the presence of the loop-fraction).
