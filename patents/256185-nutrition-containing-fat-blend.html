DESCRIPTION	<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the use of a long chain polyunsaturated<br>
fatty acid composition for feeding an infant of a mother who suffered from<br>
a metabolic disorder during pregnancy and a nutritional composition with<br><br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids suitable for such use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The polyunsaturated fatty acid status of infants is of continuing interest in<br>
the art. Several functions have been attributed to different fatty acids. For<br>
example, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is the primary structural fatty acid<br>
component in both the gray matter of the brain and the retina of the eye<br>
and thus is essential for brain and eye function. Hence, DHA is of<br>
particular importance for the growing infant.<br>
As a result of DHA deficiency, n-6 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA n-6) is<br>
instead incorporated in the growing brain of the infant. This is<br>
undesirable because it is difficult to reverse and may result in impaired<br>
neurological development. Additional, insufficient DHA may lead to a<br>
hindrance of healthy development.<br>
DHA deficiency is of particular importance for infants of mothers who<br>
suffered from a disease during pregnancy. Hence, particularly for these<br>
infants, it is of crucial importance that the infant formula provides an<br>
optimal fatty acid profile in the infant.<br>
DE 4 327 310 describes a milk composition from cows containing<br>
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and n-3<br>
docosapentaenoic acid (DPA-n3), which is useful for promoting growth,<br>
intellectual function and sight function in children. The fat composition is<br>
however unsuitable for feeding to an infant because the weight ratio<br>
linoleic acid/ alpha-linolenic acid (LA/ALA) is not optimal.<br><br><br>
WO 01/78530 describes a nutritional composition containing specified<br>
amounts of docosahexaerioic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA) as<br>
well as their precursor essential fatty acids ALA and LA, for providing<br>
nutrition and for enhancing neurological development of preterm infants.<br>
WO 2004/052115 describes glyceride compositions, methods of making<br>
the glyceride compositions, and nutritional formulations containing the<br>
glyceride compositions. The glyceride compositions contain<br>
predominantly monoglycerides and diglycerides carrying one or more long<br>
chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Also disclosed are methods of using<br>
the glyceride compositions and nutritional formulations<br>
WO 98/36745 describes methods and compositions for reducing the<br>
incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis. Said compositions provide n-6 and<br>
n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a nutritional composition<br>
with polyunsaturated fatty acids suitable for feeding an infant of a mother<br>
who suffered from a metabolic disorder during pregnancy.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors believe that not only DHA and AA need to be<br>
abundantly present in infant formula for optimal brain development, but<br>
also the precursors of these fatty acids are essential because an<br>
important part of the DHA and AA are locally synthesized in the brains<br>
from its precursors. Hence, the present inventors believe that addition of<br>
DHA and/or AA alone to the standard infant formulas is insufficient to<br>
provide optimal DHA incorporation in the various neurological tissues.<br>
Hence the present composition also contains, besides DHA and AA,<br>
significant amounts of precursors of DHA and AA.<br>
For an optimal de novo synthesis, the present composition contains the<br>
precursors of DHA, including at least alpha-linolenic acid (ALA),<br>
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA-n3).<br>
However, EPA cannot be included in thecomposition in to high amounts,<br><br>
as EPA inhibits the metabolic conversion of linolenic acid (LA) to AA,<br>
another important fatty acid. The relatively low EPA amounts are<br>
compensated for by relatively high quantities of docosapentaenoic acid<br>
(DPAn-3) in the present composition. Both precursors are essential,<br>
because they are believed to provide the precursors, which stimulate the<br>
local DHA synthesis.<br>
Hence, in an optimal configuration,<br>
the weight EPA/DHA ratio in the present composition is between 0.05 and<br>
1, which is similar or a little below the ratio of the average human milk;<br>
the weight ratio long chain DHA precursor [DPAn-3 + EPA] per DHA is<br>
preferably between 0.25 and 1 in order to provide sufficient DHA<br>
precursor; and<br>
the weight ratio DPA-n3/EPA of the present composition is between 0.25<br>
and 5. Human milk generally has a weight ratio DPA-n3/EPA above about<br>
1.<br>
High DPAn-3 oils, which can be suitably used, include marine oils such<br>
as seal oil and DPAn-3-enriched fish oils. The present composition has a<br>
weight ratio DHA/DPAn-3 of between 2 and 25, slightly above the<br>
average content weight ratio DHA/DPA-n3 in human milk, but a major<br>
improvement over the available infant formula containing no or only trace<br>
amounts of DPA-n3.<br>
In order to further improve the composition, ALA is added in significant<br>
amounts to further reduce insufficiency of DHA. The ratio ALA/DHA in the<br>
present composition is preferably between 5 and 25.<br>
Furthermore, it is of great importance that arachidonic acid (AA) is<br>
included in the present composition, particularly in those compositions<br>
containing long chain precursors of docosahexaenoic acid. AA is an<br>
omega-6 fatty acid derived from linoleic acid and is found primarily in<br>
food sources such as meat, eggs and milk. AA contains twenty carbon<br><br>
atoms and four double bonds (20:4n-6) and is the principal omega-6 fatty<br>
acid found in the brain. Besides AA it is also of primary importance that<br>
the lipid contains significant amounts of AA precursor, i.e. gamma<br>
linolenic acid (GLA) and linoleic acid (LA). These fatty acids provide the<br>
precursor for local synthesis of AA. Because the present composition has<br>
a high GLA content, i.e. preferably between 0.05 and 0.4 wt.% GLA<br>
based on total weight of the lipid, the present composition has a low<br>
linoleic acid content, i.e. between 10 and 15 wt.% LA based on total<br>
weight of the lipid.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention provides a nutritional composition wherein the<br>
carbohydrate provides 40 to 75 % of the total calories, the lipid provides<br>
20 to 50 % of the total calories and the protein provides 5 to 12.5 % of<br>
the total calories, wherein the lipid contains at least one vegetable lipid<br>
source and a n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn-3) containing lipid<br>
source, said lipid contains an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction and<br>
an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction, wherein<br>
the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction contains<br>
at least 0.1 wt % docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) based on total weight of<br>
the lipid; at least 0.01 wt % DPAn-3 based on total weight of the lipid; at<br>
least 0.01 wt.% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) based on total weight of the<br>
lipid; wherein the sum DHA, DPAn-3 and EPA is below 1 wt.% of total<br>
lipid; and between 1.9 and 3 wt.% alpha linoleic acid (ALA) based on<br>
total weight of the lipid; and the weight ratio: EPA/DHA ratio between<br>
0.05 and 1; (DPAn-3 + EPA)/DHA 0.25 and 1; DPAn-3/EPA 0.25 and 5;<br>
DHA/DPAn-3 between 2 and 25; ALA/DHA between 5 and 25,<br>
the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction contains<br>
between 0.2 and 1 wt.% arachidonic acid (AA) based on total weight of<br>
the lipid; and between 10 and 15 wt.% linoleic acid (LA) based on total<br>
weight of the lipid; and<br><br>
the weight ratio LA/ALA is between 5 and 10.<br>
The present composition, which can be considered as a nutrition<br>
containing a lipid blend, can suitably be used for feeding healthy infants<br>
and is particularly suitable for feeding an infant of a mother who suffered<br>
from a metabolic disorder during pregnancy. The n-3 polyunsaturated<br>
fatty acid fraction as described above provides significant benefits for<br>
these infants. Optimally, the composition as described above contains<br>
both the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction and the n-6<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction as described herein.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides the use of long chain<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids for the manufacture of a nutritional<br>
composition, which is preferably a liquid composition, for feeding infants<br>
of a mother who suffered from a metabolic disorder during pregnancy,<br>
said composition comprising a n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction containing at least 0.1 wt % docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) based on total<br>
weight of the lipid; and at least 0.01 wt % n-3 docosapentaenoic acid<br>
(DPA-n3) based on total weight of the lipid; and at least 0.01 wt.%<br>
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, n3) based on total weight of the lipid; and<br>
wherein the sum DHA, DPA-n3 and EPA is below 1 wt.% of total lipid.<br>
Said nutritional composition can have any form desired and/or suitable<br>
for feeding purposes and is preferably in the form of a liquid.<br>
The present composition is particularly suitable for infants of mothers<br>
who suffered from one or more of diabetes type I, diabetes type II,<br>
overweight and obesity during pregnancy. These metabolic disorders are<br>
a particular cause of reduced DHA and/or DHA precursor transmittal of<br>
the mother to the infant and may result in increased DPAn-6<br>
incorporation into the brain membranes.<br>
n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction:<br><br>
Abbreviations for omega 3 (n-3) fatty acids: ALA = C18:3n-3 = alpha-<br>
linolenic acid; EPA = 20:5n-3 = eicosapentaenoic acid; DPAn-3 = 22:5n-3<br>
= n-3 docosapentaenoic acid; DHA = 22:6n-3 = docosahexaenoic acid.<br>
The present composition contains a n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid<br>
fraction comprising at least 0.1 wt %, preferably between 0.10 and 1<br>
wt.%, more preferably between 0.15 and 0.5 wt.% DHA based on total<br>
weight of the lipid. The present composition contains at least 0.01 wt %,<br>
preferably between 0.015 and 0.5 wt.% DPAn-3 based on total weight of<br>
the lipid. The EPA content is at least 0.01 wt.%, preferably between 0.03<br>
and 0.5 wt.%, even more preferably between 0.04 and 0.1 wt.% based on<br>
total weight of the lipid.<br>
The cumulative weight % (sum) of DHA, DPA and EPA in the present<br>
composition is below 1 wt.%, preferably below 0.5 wt.% of total lipid.<br>
The present composition has a weight ratio EPA/DHA between 0.05 and<br>
1, preferably between 0.1 and 0.5, more preferably between 0.2 and 0.5.<br>
The weight ratio DHA/DPAn-3 of the present composition is between 2<br>
and 25, preferably between 5 and 15. The weight ratio (DPAn-3 +<br>
EPA)/DHA of the present composition is between 0.25 and 1. More<br>
optimally, the weight ratio (precursors of DHA/DHA), i.e. (DPAn-3 +<br>
EPA)/DHA, is between 0.3 and 0.5. In mothers milk, the weight ratio<br>
DPAn-3/EPA is generally greater than 1. The present composition<br>
preferably has a weight ratio DPAn-3/EPA between 0.25 and 5, more<br>
preferably between 0.3 and 3. Particular DPAn-3-enriched fish oils,<br>
selected seal oils and biotechnologically produced high DPAn-3 oils may<br>
suitably be used for making the composition according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
The present composition contains between 1.9 and 3 wt.%, preferably<br>
between 2 and 2.5 wt.% ALA based on total weight of the lipid. The wt.%<br>
ALA is slightly increased compared to mother's milk. Mothers milk<br>
generally contains between about 0.5 and 1.6 wt.% ALA based on total<br>
weight of the lipid. However, mothers milk generally contains an<br><br>
increased weight percentage of long chain precursors of DHA, e.g.<br>
DPAn3 and EPA. Hence, the weight ratio ALA/DHA is higher in the<br>
present composition compared to mother's milk, i.e. between 5 and 25 in<br>
the present composition, versus about 2 in mother's milk. Preferably the<br>
ratio ALA/DHA in the present composition is between 7.5 and 15.<br>
n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction:<br>
Abbreviations for omega 6 (n-6) fatty acids: LA = 18:2n-6 = linoleic acid;<br>
GLA = 18:3n-6 = gamma-linolenic acid; DGLA = 20:3n-6 = dihomo-<br>
gamma-linolenic acid; AA = 20:4n-6 = arachidonic acid; DPAn-6 = 22:5n-<br>
6 = n-6 docosapentaenoic acid.<br>
The present composition contains between 0.2 and 1 wt.%, preferably<br>
between 0.25 and 0.75 wt.% AA based on total weight of the lipid. AA<br>
cannot be incorporated into the composition in to high amounts because<br>
of its pro-inflammatory effects. Hence, as a precursor of AA, the present<br>
composition preferably contains between 0.05 and 1 wt.%, preferably<br>
between 0.1 and 0.4 wt.%, more preferably between 0.15 and 0.3 wt.%<br>
GLA based on total weight of the lipid. The high content of GLA is<br>
included in the present composition to at least partially compensate for<br>
the reduced amount of DGLA in the present composition compared to<br>
human milk. As still the cumulative amount of precursor is relatively low,<br>
the present composition contains a high amount of LA, i.e. between 10<br>
and 15 wt.%, preferably between 11 and 14 wt.% LA based on total<br>
weight of the lipid, which is slightly elevated compared to the average<br>
content of LA in human milk, which is about 9 wt.% (Luukainen et al, Eur<br>
J Pediatr (1995) 154: 316-319). The incorporation of the present amounts<br>
of GLA and the optimal n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction does<br>
however not require excessive amounts of LA to be included in the<br>
present composition, i.e. above 15 wt.% LA based on total lipid.<br>
The weight ratio LA/ALA in the present composition is between 5 and 10.<br>
Infant nutrition:<br><br>
The present invention relates to nutritional formula suitable for feeding to<br>
an infant, i.e. nutritional compositions wherein the carbohydrate provides<br>
40 to 75 %, the lipid provides 20 to 50 % and the protein provides 5 to<br>
12.5 % of the total calories. Preferably the protein provides 7.5 to 12.5 %<br>
of the total calories.<br>
The present composition contains at least one vegetable lipid source and<br>
a DPAn-3 containing lipid source. More preferably, the present<br>
composition contains at least one lipid source selected from the group<br>
consisting of evening primrose oil, borage oil and blackcurrant seed oil;<br>
at least one lipid source selected from the group consisting of canola oil,<br>
sunflower oil, coconut oil, palm oil and soybean oil; and at least one<br>
DPAn-3 containing lipid source. In a further preferred embodiment, the<br>
present composition also contains a fungal oil. Preferably the DPAn-3<br>
containing lipid source contains at least 1 wt.%, even more preferably at<br>
least 2 wt.% DPA n-3 based on fatty acids of the DPAn-3 containing lipid<br>
source. For easy manufacturing, the DPAn-3 containing lipid source<br>
contains at least 15 wt.%, more preferably at least 20 wt.% DHA, even<br>
more preferably at least 25 wt.% DHA based on fatty acids of the DPAn-3<br>
containing lipid source.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a method for treating<br>
infants of a mother who suffered from a metabolic disorder during<br>
pregnancy by administering the present composition.<br>
For the preparation of the present composition, a blend of animal and<br>
vegetable lipid sources is used. Because the fatty acid constitution of<br>
lipid sources can vary significantly (even if obtained from the same plant<br>
or animal source), it is best to first analyze the lipid source to be used<br>
and than calculate the amounts of individual oils that are needed to<br>
achieve the present composition and admix the lipid sources.<br>
Alternatively, the skilled person can find the appropriated lipid sources in<br>
proper handbooks. The lipid source used are preferably of non-human<br>
origin. The fatty acids as described in the present invention may be<br><br>
provided as free fatty acids, in triglyceride form, in phospholipid form, or<br>
as a mixture of one of more of the above.<br>
The carbohydrate of the present composition is preferably provided<br>
mainly by lactose, because it is most suitable for feeding the infant.<br>
Hence, the digestible carbohydrate fraction (carbohydrate) preferably<br>
contains at least 50 wt.%, more preferably at least 90 wt.% lactose based<br>
on total weight of the carbohydrate fraction.<br>
Sleep is also of utmost importance for proper intellectual development of<br>
the infant. Hence, the infant preferably has reduced intestinal discomfort.<br>
Water-soluble indigestible fibers contribute a reduced occurrence of<br>
intestinal discomfort such as bloating. Hence, the present composition<br>
preferably also contains between 0.2 and 5 grams water-soluble<br>
indigestible fiber per 100 kcal of the present composition, more<br>
preferably between 0.5 and 1.5 gram per 100 kcal. Preferably the present<br>
composition contains at least one water-soluble indigestible fiber<br>
selected from the group consisting of galactooligosaccharide,<br>
fructooligosaccharide and inulin.<br>
Optimal brain development is of particular importance for the baby the<br>
first few months of life. Hence, the present invention particularly relates<br>
to nutritional formulas, which are optimally suitable for feeding during the<br>
first few months of life. A caloric content of between 0.600 and 0.800 kcal<br>
per ml is believed to reduce intestinal discomfort in these young infants<br>
and thereby stimulate the uptake of fatty acids. Hence, the present<br>
composition preferably contains between 0.600 - 0.800 kcal/ml, more<br>
preferably 0.650-0.680 kcal/ml.<br>
As the infants of mothers who suffered from a disease during pregnancy<br>
may have sometimes have to catch-up on neurological tissue<br>
development, the present invention preferably comprises nucleotides.<br>
The present composition preferably also comprises between 2 and 25 mg<br>
nucleotides and/or between 2 and 25 mg nucleosides per 100 kcal, more<br>
preferably between 3 and 10 mg nucleotides per 100 kcal. The present<br><br>
composition preferably contains at least 2 nucleotides selected from the<br>
group consisting of cytidine-5-monophosphate, uridine-5-monophosphate,<br>
adenosine-5-monophosphate, guanosine-5-monophosphate and inosine-<br>
5-monophosphate. The nucleotides and/or nucleosides further stimulate<br>
the immune system, acting synergistically with the other ingredients of<br>
the present composition.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
The invention relates to the use of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids<br>
for the manufacture of a nutritional composition for feeding infants of a<br>
mother who suffered from a metabolic disorder during pregnancy and to a<br>
corresponding composition. Said composition comprises a n-3<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction containing at least 0.1 wt %<br>
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) based on total weight of the lipid, at least<br>
0.01 wt % n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn-3) based on total weight of<br>
the lipid, and at least 0.01 wt.% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) based on<br>
total weight of the lipid, wherein the sum of DHA, DPAn-3 and EPA is below<br>
1 wt.% of total lipid.</td>
