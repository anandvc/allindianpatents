				<td>TITLE<br>
This invention relates to a free-radical polymerization process for the production of branched to-unsaturated polymers (macromonomers) of general structure 1 based on monosubstituted vinyl monomers.<br><br>
The synthesis of macromonomers based on monosubstituted monomers has previously been achieved by the use of addition-fragmentation chain transfer agents. For example, by polymerization of an acrylate monomer in the presence of an allyl sulfide chain transfer agent (Rizzardo et al, Macomol. Symp., 1996, 777, 1). The synthesis of macromonomers has also been achieved by copolymerization of a monosubstituted monomer with an alpha-methylvinyl monomer, e.g., a methacrylate monomer, in the presence of a cobalt catalytic chain transfer agent. See, for example, WO 9731030. The process of the current invention does not require added reagents other than the polymerization initiator.<br>
Polymerizations of various monomers (in particular, acrylic monomers) have previously been performed where reaction conditions have been chosen to maximize conversion and control molecular weight. For example, U.S. 4,546,160 describes a process for synthesizing polymers based.on acrylic and methacrylic monomers where reactions are carried out at high reaction temperatures<br>
2A<br><br>
to limit molecular weight. However, no attention was paid to the design of reaction conditions to optimize the macromonomer purity or the branch structure.<br>
U.S. 5,710,227 describes a synthesis of macromonomers based on monomers of acrylic acid and its salts. The process is performed at high reaction temperatures (typically &gt;225°C) and does not describe the conditions necessary to control the purity of the macromonomer or the extent of branch formation. Furthermore, patentees report that macromonomer purity decreases as the polymerization temperature drops below 200°C. The process is further restricted to polymers containing monomers of acrylic acid and its salts.<br>
In conventional practice, when polymerizations are carried out at high reaction temperatures, these are typically carried out under conditions where there is a high flux of initiator-derived radicals. These conditions are unsuited for high purity macromonomer synthesis. The process disclosed herein sets out guidelines wherebv the molecular weieht of the macromonomer and the deeree of branching in the macromonomer can be controlled. In the process described herein high purity (&gt;90%) macromonomers are prepared at any polymerization temperature including temperatures below 1OO°C. The process described herein can be applied to the preparation of co-unsaturated homopolymers of acrylates, styrene and vinyl esters. Furthermore, the process discloses guidelines for the preparation of high purity co-unsaturated random copolymers based on one or more monosubstituted vinyl monomers or based on one or more alpha-substituted vinyl monomers.<br>

The source of initiating radicals can be any suitable method of generating free radicals such as the thermally induced homolytic scission of a suitable compound(s) (thermal initiators such as peroxides, or azo compounds), the spontaneous generation from monomer (e.g., styrene), redox initiating systems, photochemical initiating systems or high energy radiation such as electron beam, X-or y-radiation. The initiator should also have the requisite solubility in the reaction medium and monomer mixture.<br>
Thermal initiators are chosen to have an appropriate half-life at the temperature of polymerization. These initiators can include one or more of the following compounds: 2,2'-azobis(isobutyTonitrile), 2,2'-azobis(2-cyano-2-butane), dimethyl 2,2'-azobisdimethylisobutyrate) 4,4'-azobis(4-cyanopentanoic acid), 1 ? 1 '-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile), 2-(t-butylazo)-2-cyanopropane, 2,2'-azobis[2-methyl-N-( 1,1 )-bis(hydoxymethyl)-2-hydroxyethyl] propionamide, 2,2'-azobis[2-methyl-N-hydroxyethyl)]-propionamide, 2,2'-azobis(N,N'-dimethyleneisobutyramidine) dihydrochloride, 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, 2,2'-azobis(N)N'-dimemyleneisobutyramine),<br>

While not wishing to be limited by any particular mechanism, it is believed that the process for macromonomer formation occurs as summarized in Scheme 1 and involves abstraction of a methine backbone hydrogen to give a radical of structure 3. Such chain transfer to polymer in acrylate polymerization is known (Lovell et al, Polym. Commun., 1991, 32, 98). However, the art would suggest that this process leads to formation of a branched polymer. We provide a set of conditions whereby formed radical 3 undergoes fragmentation to give a macromonomer and a new propagating species.<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
Abstraction of a hydrogen from the backbone can, in principle, occur by either an intermolecular (transfer to polymer) or intramolecular (backbiting) process. The mechanism of backbone hydrogen abstraction by backbiting is shown in Scheme 2. This mechanism best accounts for the observed manner in which molecular weight varies with conversion (see Example 1). In this mechanism, two possible fragmentation routes exist. In principle, fragmentation can occur by either pathway A or pathway B leading to Irimer macromonomer 4 (path A) or dimeric propagating radical 5 (path B).<br><br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
Under the conditions of the claimed process, if all radicals 3 (formed by any mechanism) undergo fragmentation, then the molecular weight of the polymer will be determined by the incidence of backbone abstraction. In the case of ethylene polymerization, it is known that high reaction temperatures favor backbiting. A similar situation is likely to apply in acrylate polymerization. Consequently, high reaction temperatures will increase the incidence of backbone methine hydrogen abstraction and increase the incidence of fragmentation. This has the overall effect of decreasing the molecular weight of the polymer (see Example 7). Similarly, lower monomer concentration reduces the propagation rate of polymerization providing an opportunity for an increase in the incidence of backbone hydrogen atom abstraction and hence fragmentation. As a consequence, lower molecular weights are observed (see Examples 10 and 11).<br>
To summarize, control over molecular weight can be obtained by: (a) controlling the reaction temperature. A higher reaction temperature will give a lower molecular weight. Using the process described herein, macromonomers have<br><br>
been prepared at polymerization temperatures of 60°C (see Example 9, entry 2). Preferably, the polymerization temperature should be above 80°C (see Example 9, entry 1) and most preferably above 100°C (see Example 4, entry 3); and by (b) controlling the monomer concentration. A lower monomer concentration will give a lower molecular weight.<br>
For polymerizations carried out at high temperatures the experimental results indicate fragmentation of radicals 3 dominates over bimolecular reaction with monomer even with relatively high monomer concentrations. Compare the results in Example 10 and Example 11 where lower molecular weights are obtained at 170°C (Example 11) compared with 150°C (Example 10). If lower reaction temperatures are employed there will be competition between fragmentation of radical 3 and reaction of radical 3 with monomer. The result is a polymer with a higher degree of branching for lower reaction temperatures (see Example 12). Furthermore, by increasing the monomer concentration the rate of the bimolecular reaction with radical 3 will increase giving rise to polymers with a higher degree of branching (see Example 13). The branched product can nonetheless still be a macromonomer. As the conversion to macromonomer increases, there is a greater likelihood that macromonomer will react giving a polymer with a higher degree of branching (see<br>
Example 14).<br>
To summarize, the degree of branching can be controlled by: (a) controlling the reaction temperature. Higher reaction temperatures give a lower degree of branching; (b) adjusting the monomer concentration. A lower monomer concentration leads to a lower degree of branching; (c) the degree of conversion of monomer to polymer. The degree of branching can be increased by increasing the degree of conversion of monomer to polymer.<br>
The macromonomers formed by the process of the present invention are likely to be reactive under the conditions of the experiment. However, the initial<br><br>
product is another radical of structure 3 and under the preferred reaction conditions these radicals will most likely undergo fragmentation. This process thus does not lead to impurity formation. The reaction offers some opportunity for chain length equilibration. Thus, these polymerizations can give narrower polydispersities than would otherwise be observed.<br>
It is important in designing the reaction conditions to use an initiator concentration (radical flux) such that the number of chains formed by chain termination processes (i.e., combination, disproportionation) are small with respect to those resulting in macromonomer formation.<br>
Macromonomer purity will in part be determined by the initiator concentration and the rate of generation of initiator-derived radicals which in turn, determines the kinetic chain length (the length of polymer chain that would be formed in the absence of chain transfer).<br>
Maximum purity = (moles of polymer formed)-( moles initiator derived radicals)<br>
(moles of polymer formed)<br>
moles polymer formed - (grams monomer converted)/(MW of polymer) moles initiator derived radicals = (moles of initiator consumed x 2) x initiator<br>
efficiency.<br>
The acceptable range of initiator concentrations to give a required purity of macromonomer depends on the molecular weight of the macromonomer. The above expression requires that there be no transfer to monomer, solvent, initiator, etc. If these occur, then the purity will be lower. The preferred initiator concentration relative to monomer is less than 1 mol percent, more preferably, less than 0.1 mol<br>
percent.<br><br><br>
ff the mechanism of macromonomer formation involves<br>
interrnolecular abstraction from polymer (rather than backbiting) there will also be up to an equivalent of non-macromonomer product of structure 6 formed. The observation that macromonomer purity is &gt;90% under the optimal conditions suggests that this pathway is of lesser importance.<br><br><br><br>
Thus, in general, macromonomer purity is increased by decreasing the molar ratio of initiator to total monomer(s) (see Example 4).<br>
The mechanisms and general improvement conditions highlighted thus far will also apply in copolymerizations of monosubstituted vinyl monomers (e.g., acrylates, vinyl esters, styrene, and the like) with other monosubstituted vinyl monomers (see Examples 15, 16, 23 to 26). In examples of copolymers prepared with more than one monosubstituted vinyl monomer, macromonomers with more than one type of end group will be obtained. For example, copoiymerizing butyl acrylate with styrene under the conditions specified in the present invention will give o)-unsaturated polymers possessing BMA derived end groups 7 and AMS derived end groups 8 (see Example 15 for 'H-NMR).<br><br><br>
H,<br><br><br><br>
The mechanisms and general improvement conditions highlighted thus far will also apply in copolymerizations of monosubstituted vinyl monomers (e.g., acrylates, vinyl esters, styrene, and the like) with other alpha-substituted vinyl monomers. In examples of copolymers prepared with one or more alpha-substituted vinyl monomer(s), co-unsaturated polymers are formed, possessing vinyl end groups derived from the monosubstituted vinyl monomers (see Examples 17 to 19, 27, 28). Under the disclosed conditions of the claimed process, the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the backbone can not occur from the alpha-substituted monomer unit, it can only occur from the monosubstituted monomer unit. This gives rise to a radical of general structure 9 which is likely to fragments as shown in Scheme 3. Scheme 3<br><br>
This will lead to macromonomer bearing an end group derived from the monosubstituted vinyl monomer. This is in contrast to the disclosure in WO 97/31030 where the co-unsaturated polymers have end groups derived exclusively from the alpha-substituted vinyl monomer.<br>
Furthermore, in examples of copolymers prepared with one or more alpha-substituted vinyl monomer(s), the purity of the formed co-unsaturaied polymers will depend on the relative amount of alpha-substituted vinyl monomer(s) used (see Examples 17 to 19). As the relative amount of alpha-substituted vinyl monomer units<br>
In-<br><br>
increase in the polymer chain, there is less likelihood of backbone hydrogen atom abstraction. This has the effect of increasing molecular weight of the polymer and as such will increase the likelihood of the propagating radical being involved in termination processes leading to dead polymer and thus decrease the purity of the formed macromonomer.<br>
In copoiymers composed of monosubstituted vinyl monomer(s) and alpha-substituted vinyl monomerCs), the purity of the copolymer macromonomer can be affected by the relative amount of alpha-substituted vinyl monomer(s). As the proportion of alpha-substituted vinyl monomer(s) decreases, purity of the copolymer macromonomer increases.<br>
In an extension of this process, the disclosed conditions are used to prepare co-unsaturated homopolyrners of general structure 10 containing one type of vinyl end group based on the monosubstituted vinyl monomer.<br><br>
In a further extension of this process, co-unsaturated copoiymers of general structure 11 composed of one monosubstituted vinyl monomer and one or more alpha-substituted vinyl monomer can be prepared which possesses a vinyl end group derived exclusively from the monosubstituted vinyl monomer.<br><br>
If<br><br>
Macromonomers of structure 1 have application in the synthesis of block and graft copoiymers. For examples of this utility, see U.S. 5,362,826 and WO 96/15157. "One pot" procedures for sequential macromonorner and block or graft copolymer synthesis are also within the scope of this invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
General experimental conditions:<br>
In all instances, monomers were purified (to remove inhibitors) and flash distilled immediately prior to use. Quantities of initiators were calculated based on total monomer amounts. For polymerizations performed in ampoules, degassing was accomplished by repeated freeze-evacuate-thaw cycles. Once degassing was complete, the ampoules were flame sealed under vacuum and completely submerged in an oil bath at the specified temperature for the specified times. All reaction mixtures were worked up by removing volatiles in vacuo. Heating under microwave irradiation was performed in a batch reactor (for description of apparatus see: Rainor, K.D., Strauss, C.R., Thorn, T.S., and Trainor, R.W. PCT-AU94-00659, 1994; Rainor, K.D., Strauss, C.R., Trainor, R.W., and Thorn, T.S., J.Org.Chem., 60, 2456, (1995)). The percentage conversions were calculated gravimetrically unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The structures of polymers and graft copoiymers were verified by application of appropriate chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to establish the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution (polydispersity) of the polymers. Unless otherwise specified, a Waters Associates liquid chromatograph equipped with differential refractometer and 106, 105, 104, 103, 500 and 100 A Ultrastyragel columns was used. Tetrahydroruran (flow rate of 1.0 mL/min) was used as eluent. The molecular weights are provided as polystyrene equivalents. The terms Mn, Mw and Mw/Mn (PD) indicate the number and weight average molecular weights and the ,13<br><br>
polydispersity respectively.<br>
Macromonomer purity was calculated from the expression:<br>
[1-(| Mn (calc) - Mn (obs)|/ Mn (obs) )] x 100 % Mn (obs) is the Mn obtained from GPC measurement.<br>
Mn (calc) is determined from the  H-NMR spectrum of the polymer.<br>
The poly(acrylic acid) macromonomer was characterized as its poly(methyl acrylate) derivative by methylating the poly(acrylic acid) macromonomer as follows:<br>
In a Young's vessel, poly(acrylic acid) macromonomer was dissolved in methanol (4 mL/0.1 g). This was followed by the addition of (25 wt % in methanol) tetramethylammonium hydroxide (1.1 mol equivalents) and methyl iodide (2 mol equivalents). The vessel was sealed and heated at 100°C for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness and the residue dissolved in ethyl acetate. The organic solution was washed with water and saturated sodium chloride solution, then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The organic solution was evaporated to give poly(methyl acrylate) as an oily residue.<br>
The I3C-NMR and 'H-NMR spectra of macromonomers were run in deuterochloroform unless otherwise stated. The 'H-NMR chemical shift data for poly(butyl acrylate) macromonomer is as follows unless otherwise stated; 'H-NMR (CDC13): 8 6.3 and 5.55, broad singlets, 2H, vinylic H; 4.0, broad singlet, 2H, OCH2.<br>
