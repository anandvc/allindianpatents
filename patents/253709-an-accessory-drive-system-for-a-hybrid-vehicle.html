VARIABLE SPEED ACCESSORY DRIVE SYSTEM FOR A HYBRID VEHICLE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention pertains generally to a variable speed accessory<br>
drive system for a hybrid vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Driven accessories in a hybrid vehicle may include, for example, an air<br>
conditioning compressor, a power steering pump, and an alternator. These<br>
accessories are generally powered by output from the engine. Some of the accessories<br>
in a hybrid vehicle may require power while the engine is off and the vehicle is being<br>
powered by an electric motor/generator. Traditionally, in order to power hybrid<br>
vehicle accessories when the engine is off, it was necessary to provide each such<br>
accessory with a separate electric motor.<br>
[0003]	Conventional automotive accessory drive systems include a drive<br>
pulley connected to an engine output shaft. A flexible chain or belt couples the<br>
drive pulley with a plurality of driven pulleys that are each operatively connected to<br>
an accessory. The operating speeds of the accessories in such a conventional drive<br>
system are directly proportional to the speed of the engine. Since the engine operates<br>
over a wide speed range (i.e., for example, between 500 rpm and 8,000 rpm), the<br>
accessories are typically designed to provide full capacity at the low end of the engine<br>
speed range in order to ensure that they remain operational. Therefore, at higher<br>
engine speeds, excess energy transferred to the accessories may be lost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	The present invention provides an accessory drive system for a hybrid<br>
vehicle. The accessory drive system includes a planetary gear set having a first,<br>
second, and third planetary member. A first torque transfer device operatively<br>
connects an engine with the first planetary member. A motor/generator is operatively<br>
connected to the second planetary member, and a plurality of accessories are<br>
operatively connected to the third planetary member through a second torque transfer<br><br>
2<br>
device.   A one-way clutch or brake is preferably operatively connected between a<br>
stationary member and either the first planetary member or the first torque transfer<br>
device such that it prevents the engine from being rotated backwards and such that it<br>
can provide the reaction torque to enable the accessories to be driven by the<br>
motor/generator when the engine is off.   Engine output is transferable through the<br>
planetary gear set to drive the accessories, and the speed at which the accessories are<br>
driven is selectable by controlling the speed of the motor/generator.<br>
[0005]	According to the preferred embodiment, the first planetary member is a<br>
ring gear member, the second planetary member is a sun gear member, and the third<br>
planetary member is a planet carrier member.<br>
[0006]	According to an alternate embodiment, the first planetary member is a<br>
sun gear member, the second planetary member is a planet carrier member, and the<br>
third planetary member is a ring gear member.<br>
[0007]	According to another alternate embodiment, the first planetary member<br>
is a ring gear member, the second planetary member is a planet carrier member, and<br>
the third planetary member is a sun gear member.<br>
[0008]	According to another alternate embodiment, the first planetary member<br>
is a planet carrier member, the second planetary member is a ring gear member, and<br>
the third planetary member is a sun gear member.<br>
[0009]	According to another alternate embodiment, the first planetary member<br>
is a planet carrier member, the second planetary member is a sun gear member, and<br>
he third planetary member is a ring gear member.<br>
[0010]	According to another alternate embodiment, the first planetary member<br>
is a sun gear member, the second planetary member is a ring gear member, and the<br>
third planetary member is a planet carrier member.<br>
[0011]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br>
of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0023]	Conventional accessory drive systems operate by transferring engine<br>
output directly to the accessories so the accessories are driven at a speed directly<br>
proportional to engine speed. Since the engine operates over a wide speed range<br>
(e.g., between 500 rpm and 8,000 rpm), the accessories are typically designed to<br>
provide full capacity at the low end of the engine speed range in order to ensure<br>
they remain fully operational. Therefore, when the engine is operating at higher<br>
speeds, conventional accessory drive systems transfer more energy to the<br>
accessories than necessary to provide adequate function. The excess energy<br>
transferred to the accessories causes inefficiency and diminishes fuel economy. The<br>
accessory drive system 10 (shown in Figure 1) of the present invention allows the<br>
accessories to be driven at a predetermined optimal speed independent from the<br>
speed at which the engine is running in order to improve fuel economy.<br>
[0024]	Referring to Figure 1, a schematic representation of an accessory drive<br>
system 10 for a hybrid vehicle is shown. The accessory drive system 10 includes an<br>
engine 12 configured to transmit output to a crank pulley 14 via a crankshaft or output<br>
shaft 16. A first belt or chain 18 couples the crank pulley 14 with an accessory drive<br>
input pulley 20. The accessory drive input pulley 20 is operatively connected to a<br>
differential transmission such as the planetary gear set 22. The planetary gear set 22<br>
has a plurality of members including: a sun gear 24; a plurality of pinions or planet<br>
gears 26; a ring gear 28; and a pinion carrier or planet carrier 30.<br>
[0025]	The  engine   12 also transfers output via the crankshaft  16 to a<br>
transmission 17. The transmission 17 transfers output from the engine 12 to a<br>
plurality of wheels 19 in order to drive a hybrid vehicle. It should be appreciated that<br>
the transmission 17 and wheels 19 may include any known configurations and are not<br>
included as part of the accessory drive system 10 of the present invention.<br><br>
5<br>
[0026]	The planetary gear set 22 is configured to convert the rotational<br>
velocity of the accessory drive input pulley 20 (which runs at a fixed ratio of engine<br>
speed) to a predetermined value selected to efficiently drive the accessories 38. In<br>
other words, the planetary gear set 22 can selectively increase or decrease the<br>
magnitude of the rotational velocity from the accessory drive input pulley 20 in order<br>
to drive the accessories 38 at more efficient speed and thereby improve fuel economy.<br>
Output from the planetary gear set 22 is transferred to an accessory drive output<br>
pulley 32. A second belt or chain 34 couples the accessory drive output pulley 32<br>
with one or more accessory pulleys 36. The accessory pulleys 36 are each operatively<br>
connected to an accessory 38.<br>
[0027]	A motor/generator 40 is configured to selectively transfer torque to the<br>
planetary gear set 22 either directly or through a transfer device such as, for example,<br>
a belt, chain, gear set, differential gear, etc. The motor/generator 40 is configured to<br>
receive power from and/or transfer power to a storage device such as the battery 46.<br>
As is known in the art, by transferring a first predetermined amount of input torque<br>
from the engine 12 to one of the planetary gear set 22 members, and transferring a<br>
second predetermined amount of input torque from the motor/generator 40 to another<br>
of the planetary gear set 22 members, the planetary gear set 22 can be controlled to<br>
produce a selectable amount of output torque from yet another of its members.<br>
Therefore, by controlling the amount of torque transferred from the motor generator<br>
40 to the planetary gear set 22, the planetary gear set 22 output speed is selectable<br>
within an operational range.<br>
[0028]	The engine 12 and the motor/generator 40 are operatively connected to<br>
a controller 42. The controller 42 receives input from the engine 12 indicating the<br>
current engine speed and calculates a corresponding motor/generator 40 speed or<br>
torque value required to produce a predetermined planetary gear set 22 output speed.<br>
As an example, if the engine 12 is running at 4,000 rpm and the accessories 38 are<br>
optimized to run at 1,500 rpm, the controller 42 calculates the motor/generator 40<br>
speed required to produce a planetary gear set 22 output speed of 1,500 rpm. These<br>
types of calculations which utilize the ring/sun tooth ratios of a planetary gear set are<br>
well known to those skilled in the art and therefore will not be described in detail<br>
hereinafter.  After calculating, the controller 42 commands the motor/generator 40 to<br><br>
6<br>
transfer the required amount of torque to the planetary gear set 22 such that the<br>
accessories 38 are driven in an optimally efficient manner.<br>
[0029]	A one-way clutch 44 is operatively connected between a stationary<br>
member 48 and either the crank pulley 14, the accessory drive input pulley 20, or a<br>
member of the planetary gear set 22. According to an alternate embodiment, the one<br>
way clutch 44 may be replaced with a selectively engageable brake. The one-way<br>
clutch 44 is implemented to allow the motor/generator 40 to efficiently power the<br>
accessories 38 when the engine 12 is off. It should be appreciated that without the<br>
one-way clutch 44, the motor/generator 40 could transfer at least a portion of its<br>
output torque back to the engine 12 when the engine 12 is off, and that the torque<br>
transferred back to the engine 12 could cause the engine to rotate backwards.<br>
Therefore, the one-way clutch 44 prevents the transfer of torque from the<br>
motor/generator 40 back to the engine 12 and provides the reaction torque necessary<br>
to enable the motor/generator 40 to efficiently run the accessories 38. Conventional<br>
hybrid vehicle accessory drive systems typically implement individual electric motors<br>
for each accessory in order to power the accessories when the engine is off. The<br>
accessory drive system 10 of the present invention reduces cost as compared to<br>
conventional systems by implementing fewer components (i.e., a single<br>
motor/generator 40) to drive all the accessories 38, and by allowing the use of mass-<br>
produced conventional accessories.<br>
[0030]	Having explained the components and functionality of the accessory<br>
drive system 10, the precise interconnection of these components will now be<br>
described in accordance with a plurality of different embodiments. Figures 2-11 each<br>
illustrate a separate embodiment that functions similarly to the previously described<br>
accessory drive system 10, but includes somewhat different component connections.<br>
Like reference numbers are used in Figures 2-11 to refer to like components from<br>
Figure 1. Additionally, the letters "a" through "j" added as a suffix to a reference<br>
numeral identifies a similar component in a different embodiment. As an example,<br>
the engine 12 of Figure 1 functions similarly to the engines 12a-12j of Figures 2-11,<br>
respectively. Therefore, unless specified otherwise, the components of Figures 2-11<br>
identified with a base reference number followed by one of the letters "a" through "j"<br>
should be considered to be identical to a respective component of Figure 1 identified<br>
with a common base reference number.<br><br>
7<br>
[0031]	Referring to Figure 2, an accessory drive system 10a is shown in<br>
accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The accessory<br>
drive input pulley 20a (which runs at a fixed ratio of engine speed) is operatively<br>
connected to the ring gear 28a of the planetary gear set 22a. The motor/generator 40a<br>
is operatively connected to the sun gear 24a of the planetary gear set 22a. The planet<br>
carrier 30a of the planetary gear set 22a is operatively connected to the accessory<br>
drive output pulley 32a. Therefore, in response to input from the engine 12a (via the<br>
ring gear 28a) and/or the motor/generator 40a (via the sun gear 24a), the planetary<br>
gear set 22a can transfer output to the accessory drive output pulley 32a (via the<br>
planet carrier 30a) and thereby drive the accessories 38a at a selectable rate. The one-<br>
way clutch 44a is operatively connected to the ring gear 28a and the stationary<br>
member 48a such that, when the engine 12a is off, the ring gear 28a is restrained from<br>
rotating in the reverse direction and the motor/generator 40a can be implemented to<br>
drive the accessories 38a at a selectable rate.<br>
[0032]	Referring to Figure 3, an accessory drive system 10b is shown in<br>
accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. The planetary<br>
gear set 22b of this embodiment preferably includes a double-pinion carrier 30b<br>
configuration. The accessory drive input pulley 20b (which runs at a fixed ratio of<br>
engine speed) is operatively connected to the sun gear 24b of the planetary gear set<br>
22b. The motor/generator 40b is operatively connected to the double-pinion carrier<br>
30b of the planetary gear set 22b. The ring gear 28b of the planetary gear set 22b is<br>
operatively connected to the accessory drive output pulley 32b. Therefore, in<br>
response to input from the engine 12b (via the sun gear 24b) and/or the<br>
motor/generator 40b (via the double-pinion carrier 30b), the planetary gear set 22b<br>
can transfer output to the accessory drive output pulley 32b (via the ring gear 28b)<br>
and thereby drive the accessories 38b at a selectable rate. The one-way clutch 44b is<br>
operatively connected to the accessory drive input pulley 20b and the stationary<br>
member 48b such that, when the engine 12a is off, the sun gear 24b is restrained from<br>
rotating in the reverse direction and the motor/generator 40b can be implemented to<br>
drive the accessories 38b at a selectable rate.<br>
[0033]	Referring to Figure 4, an accessory drive system 10c is shown in<br>
accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. The planetary<br>
gear set 22c of this embodiment preferably includes a double-pinion carrier 30c<br><br>
8<br>
configuration. The accessory drive input pulley 20c (which runs at a fixed ratio of<br>
engine speed) is operatively connected to the ring gear 28c of the planetary gear set<br>
22c. The motor/generator 40c is operatively connected to the double-pinion carrier<br>
30c of the planetary gear set 22c. The sun gear 24c of the planetary gear set 22c is<br>
operatively connected to the accessory drive output pulley 32c. Therefore, in<br>
response to input from the engine 12c (via the ring gear 28c) and/or the<br>
motor/generator 40c (via the double-pinion carrier 30c), the planetary gear set 22c can<br>
transfer output to the accessory drive output pulley 32c (via the sun gear 24c) and<br>
thereby drive the accessories 38c at a selectable rate. The one-way clutch 44c is<br>
operatively connected to the ring gear 28c and the stationary member 48c such that,<br>
when the engine 12a is off, the ring gear 28c is restrained from rotating in the reverse<br>
direction and the motor/generator 40c can be implemented to drive the accessories<br>
38c at a selectable rate.<br>
[0034]	Referring to Figure 5, an accessory drive system 10d is shown in<br>
accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. The accessory<br>
drive input pulley 20d (which runs at a fixed ratio of engine speed) is operatively<br>
connected to the planet carrier 30d of the planetary gear set 22d. The motor/generator<br>
40d is operatively connected to the ring gear 28d of the planetary gear set 22d. The<br>
sun gear 24d of the planetary gear set 22d is operatively connected to the accessory<br>

planet carrier 30d) and/or the motor/generator 40d (via the ring gear 28d), the<br>
planetary gear set 22d can transfer output to the accessory drive output pulley 32d (via<br>
the sun gear 24d) and thereby drive the accessories 38d at a selectable rate. The one-<br>
way clutch 44d is operatively connected to the planet carrier 30d and the stationary<br>
member 48d such that, when the engine 12d is off, the planet carrier 30d is restrained<br>
from rotating in the reverse direction and the motor/generator 40d can be<br>
implemented to drive the accessories 38d at a selectable rate.<br>
[0035]	Referring to Figure 6, an accessory drive system  10e is shown in<br>
accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. The accessory<br>
drive input pulley 20e (which runs at a fixed ratio of engine speed) is operatively<br>
connected to the planet carrier 30e of the planetary gear set 22e. The motor/generator<br>
40e is operatively connected to the sun gear 24e of the planetary gear set 22e. The<br>
ring gear 28e of the planetary gear set 22e is operatively connected to the accessory<br><br>
9<br>
drive output pulley 32e. Therefore, in response to input from the engine 12e (via the<br>
planet carrier 30e) and/or the motor/generator 40e (via the sun gear 24e), the planetary<br>
gear set 22e can transfer output to the accessory drive output pulley 32e (via the ring<br>
gear 28e) and thereby drive the accessories 38e at a selectable rate. The one-way<br>
clutch 44e is operatively connected to the planet carrier 30e and the stationary<br>
member 48e such that, when the engine 12e is off, the planet carrier 30e is restrained<br>
from rotating in the reverse direction and the motor/generator 40e can be implemented<br>
to drive the accessories 38e at a selectable rate.<br>
[0036]	Referring to Figure 7, an accessory drive system 10f is shown in<br>

connected to the sun gear 24f of the planetary gear set 22f. The motor/generator 40f<br>
is operatively connected to the ring gear 28f of the planetary gear set 22f. The planet<br>
carrier 30f of the planetary gear set 22f is operatively connected to the accessory drive<br>
output pulley 32f. Therefore, in response to input from the engine 12f (via the sun<br>
gear 24f) and/or the motor/generator 40f (via the ring gear 24f), the planetary gear set<br>
22f can transfer output to the accessory drive output pulley 32f (via the planet carrier<br>
30f) and thereby drive the accessories 38f at a selectable rate. The one-way clutch 44f<br>
