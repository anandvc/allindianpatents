COMPOSITION FOR CUTTING OFF HEAT-RAY, FILM FORMED THEREFORM AND<br>
METHOD FOR FORMING THE COMPOSITION AND THE FILM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to compositions for cutting of heat rays,<br>
and more particularly, to compositions for cutting off heat rays with being<br>
compatible with hydrolic or alcoholic and anti-hydrolic resin binder, films<br>
formed therefrom, and methods of forming them.<br>
Background Art<br>
Transparent films effective in screening heat is advantageous to be<br>
associated with means for preventing malfunctions of integrated circuits or<br>
electronic components, or for reducing the costs for cooling and heating by<br>
lessening the amount of solar energy going in and out of rooms and automobiles<br>
through windows. In addition, it is possible to offer effects of screening<br>
infrared rays when they are applied to various products such as optical fibers,<br>
sun visors, PET vessels, packaging films, glasses, textile goods, peep holes of<br>
heaters, heating apparatuses, and so on.<br>
There has been proposed several films, which is capable of transmitting<br>
light with the wavelength of 380 ~ 780 nm in a visible right range while<br>
reflecting light with the wavelength of 800 ~ 2500 nm around the range of<br>
infrared lays, formed by the methods of: (1) forming a film with ingredients of<br>
tin oxide and antimony oxide by means of a spray process (refer to JP03-<br>
103341); (2) forming a film of tin-doped indium oxide (hereinafter, "ITO") on a<br>
glass substrate by means of physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor<br>
deposition, or sputtering; and (3) coating an near-infrared absorber in the type of<br>
organic dyestuffs, such as pthalocyannine series, anthraquinone series,<br>
naphtoquinone series, cyanine series, naphtaloctannine series, condensed azo<br>
polymers; and pyrrol series, on a substrate by means of an organic solvent and<br>
an organic binder, or transform the about-infrared absorber into a coating.<br>
However, the method (1) needs a thick film because it has weak<br>
performance for screening heat rays, resulting in a low transmittance rate for<br>
visible light. The method (2) consumes a high product cost because it needs an<br>
apparatus with control of the atmosphere in high vacuum and accuracy, being<br>
restricted in sizes of coating films and shapes and disadvantageous to<br>
implementation due to insufficient mass-productivity. The method (3) is<br>
insufficient in advancing the heat cutoff efficiency because it has a low<br>
transmittance rate for visible light and dark colors and is restricted to absorb<br>
near-infrared rays with wavelengths 690 ~ 1000 nm. While the methods (1)<br>
and (2) are available to cut off ultraviolet rays as well as heat rays, they are<br>
incapable of receiving electric waves from mobile phones, televisions, or radios,<br>
because their materials reflects the electric waves due to small surface<br>
resistance, i.e., high electrical conductance.<br>
In order to overcome the problems, there have been proposed several<br>
techniques disclosed in Japanese Patent NOs. JP56-156606, JP58-117228, and<br>
JP63-281837, in which respectively an antimony-doped tin qxjde (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as "ATO") is mixed with a resin binder, ATO is directly added to a<br>
resin binder dissolved in an organic solvent, and a coating compound<br>
manufactured by adding an organic binder and tin oxide nanoparticles into a<br>
splittable surfactant is deposited to form a heat-ray cutoff film. But it still<br>
needs a thick film enough to perform an infrared ray cutoff function, which<br>
contains low transmittance rate for a visible light to lower the transparency.<br>
On the other hand, Japanese Patent NOs: JP07-24957, JP07-70363, JP07-<br>
70481, JP07-70842, JP07-70445, and JP08-41441 disclose the methods in which;<br>
a powder with an excellent performance of screening heat rays is made by<br>
processing or manufacturing ITO nanoparticles in the atmosphere of inert gas;<br>
and a heat cutoff film formed by mixing organic/inorganic binders with a<br>
dispersion sol made from using water or an alcoholic solvent without using an<br>
organic solvent, capable of screening heat rays over 90% under the condition of<br>
wavelength 100 nm. However, as the ITO nanoparticles is ingredient of a<br>
highly expensive indium and obtained by processing twice in the atmosphere of<br>
inert gas, it is limited in.practical implementation due to the high product cost.<br>
Moreover, the ITO nanoparticles cause delamination or cohesion when they are<br>
mixed with a ultraviolet-hardening resin binder and is in poor preservation.<br>
Japanese Patent NOs. JP09-324144, JP09-310031, JP09-316115, JP09-<br>
316363, JP10-100310, and JP12-169765 propose the method of mixing a<br>
dispersion sol of the first heat-ray cutoff nanoparticles and the second heat-ray<br>
cutoff compound (the near-infrared absorber or 6-boronic nanoparticles), or<br>
mixing respective coating compounds. However, in this case, it has<br>
disadvantages that a visible ray transmittance rate is remarkably degraded or it<br>
is not easy to induce dispersion while manufacturing a dispersion sol of the<br>
second heat-ray cutoff compound, which disables a low cost mass-production for<br>
the heat-ray cutoff films.<br>
Japanese Patent NOs. JP06-262717, JP06-316439, JP06-257922, JPO8-<br>
281860, JP09-108621 and JP09-151203, and U.S. Patent Publication NO.<br>
2002/0090507 disclose the methods of forming an organic solvent dispersion sol<br>
of an ATO Water dispersion sol and an organic ATO (i.e., enhancing co-usability<br>
to an organic solvent by converting a hydrophllic surface of an ATO into a<br>
hydrophobic surface) and of forming heat-ray cutoff coating films respective to<br>
a hydrolic binder and an organic resin binder. However, the water ATO sol is<br>
insufficient in co-usability with an organic resin binder, and the organic ATO sol<br>
is insufficient in co-usability with a hydrolic resin binder. Further, the organic<br>
ATO sol needs a secondary process to change the hydrophllic surface into the<br>
hydrophobic surface, which causes an increase of the product cost.<br>
Therefore, it is desired to develop an improved coating film having<br>
excellent property for cutting off heat rays.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is directed to provide a heat-ray<br><br>
 cutoff composition having a high transmission rate and an improved property of<br>
cutting off heat rays and a method of forming the same by means of conductive<br>
nanoparticles that is effective in cutting off beat rays.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of<br>
forming a coating film and formative substance by means of depositions or<br>
general forming techniques with conductive nanoparticles, that is effective in<br>
screening heat rays, and the coating film and formative substance manufacture<br>
by the method, in low cost.<br>
In order to accomplish the above objects of the present invention, the<br>
present invention is characterized in providing a heat-ray cutoff composition, i.e. ,<br>
a dispersion sol, which is formed by dispersing conductive nanoparticles in an<br>
amphoteric solvent in high concentration without an additional step for<br>
manufacturing powder to turn the nanoparticles into a hydrophobic condition,<br>
being good for commercial co-usability. The dispersion sol produced as such is<br>
efficient to manufacturing a heat-ray cutoff film and a formative object in low<br>
cost with excellent stability and co-usability to hydrolic or alcoholic resin<br>
binders and anti-hydrolic resin binders.<br>
According to the present invention, it overcomes a problem of co-<br>
usability to hydrolic or alcoholic resin binders and anti-hydrolic resin binders by<br>
dispersing hydrophobic-surfaced conductive nanoparticles in an amphoteric<br>
solvent, capable of resulting in the form of a coating film, a film, or other<br>
formative objects, enhancing visible light transmittance, heat-ray cutoff property,<br>
endurance of wearing and weathering, low cost as well.<br>
 A composition advanced by the present invention is good for preservation<br>
stability, and provides high visible light transmittance rate and heat-ray cutoff<br>
property when it is hardened after being deposited on various films, plastic<br>
objects, or glass.<br>
In addition, as the conductive nanoparticles such as ITO, ATO and AZO<br>
axe dispersed-in the amphoteric solvent, it can be easily hardened by an<br>
ultraviolet or an electronic ray even with using a hydrolic or alcoholic resin<br>
binder as well as an organic resin binder. Further, it is able to manufacture a<br>
film by way of heat or normal-termperature hardening processes.<br>
The present invention improves the co-usability, of the heat-ray cutoff<br>
film to hydrolic or alcoholic resin binders and anti-hydrolic resin binders, and<br>
provides an amphoteric solvent that enables a coating compound to be adaptable<br>
to processes of normal-temperature hardening, heat hardening, ultraviolet or<br><br>
electronic ray hardening. By adding a hydrolic or alcoholic resin binder, or<br>
anti-hydrolic resin binder into such an amphoteric solvent dispersion sol, a heat-<br>
ray cutoff film or a formative object thereof is manufactured. A production<br>
cost is cheaper than before because it does not need a secondary process for a<br>
water dispersion sol in order to use the anti-hydrolic resin binder.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
[Manufacturing a bilaternal solvent dispersion sol]<br>
1. Conductive nanoparticles<br>
 Conductive nanoparticles of the present invention were used with<br>
nanoparticles of metal oxides having excellent conductivity, such as ATOs, ITOs,<br>
and antimony-doped zinc oxides (AZOs). The metal oxide nanoparticles have<br><br>
grain diameters under 200 nm, preferably under l00nm, more preferably in the<br>
range of 10 ~ 80 nm, and the nanoparticles are dispersed into an amphoteric<br>
solvent such that particles more than 60 % have their diameters within 100 nm.<br>
Small particles under 200 nm do not induce the dispersion in the range of visible<br>
light, retaining the transparency of the coating film. For the composition in use<br>
of forming a coating film to screen heat rays, by the present invention,<br>
conductive nanoparticles, such as ATO, ITO, AZO, and so on, were used with<br>
varying a fine component ratio of powder in accordance with necessity. The<br>
conductive nanoparticles are manufactured by means of a general method,<br>
accompanying with a product made by PMT Co., Keeling &amp; Walker Co., Nano<br>
Korea Co., and so on, or a compound power having an appropriate fine<br>
component ratio.<br>
While there is no limit to the amount of the conductive nanoparticles<br>
used in the dispersion of the amphoteric solvent, it is exhorted to be established<br>
in the range of 1 ~ 80 wt%, preferably in the range of 20 ~ 60 wt%.<br>
2. Amphoteric solvent<br>
It is generally frequent for a solvent to be used in dispersion of the<br>
conductive nanoparticles to employ a polarized organic solvent such as water or<br>
alcohol, or a non-polarized organic solvent such as toluene or xylene. If a<br>
solvent of a dispersion sol manufactured by the above condition is a polarized<br>
solvent like water or alcohol, it is unable to be adoptable to anti-hydrolic resin<br>
binder. To the contrary, if a solvent of a dispersion sol is a non-polarized<br>
organic solvent, it is unable to be adoptable to hydrolic resin binder. Therefore,<br>
there has been a limit in application because it was impossible to use a single<br>
dispersion sol for a variety of resin binders. Further, as a powder surface in the<br>
conductive nanoparticles shows its hydrophilic property, it needs a process for<br><br>
manufacturing an additional powder to convert the powder surface into a<br>
hydrophobic property for the dispersion of non-polarized organic solvent, which<br>
raises a time and cost for that.<br>
Therefore, the present invention makes it enable to be used by mixing<br>
the nanoparticles with all kinds of resin binders without processing such a<br>
secondary treatment for converting the powder surface of the conductive<br>
nanoparticles into a hydrophobic property, by manufacturing a dispersion sol<br>
from using the amphoteric solvent. There are many kinds to be usable as the<br>
amphoteric solvent adoptable to the dispersion of the conductive nanoparticles,<br>
such as ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether,<br>
ethylene glycol monopropyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, so on, but<br>
other kinds of the amphoteric solvents may be also available without limitation<br>
on the above composites. While there is no limit to the amount of the solvent<br>
used in the dispersion of the amphoteric solvent, it is exhorted to be established<br>
in the range of 20 ~ 99 wt%, preferably in the range of 50 ~ 80 wt%.<br>
3. Additive<br>
When the conductive nanoparticles are dispersed in the amphoteric<br>
solvent, it is available to add several additives, such as a surface charge<br>
mediating agent and a dispersing agent, in order to enhance the efficiency of the<br>
surface property and dispersion of the dispersion sol formed therein.<br>
(1) Surface charge mediating agent: Dispersion by electrostatic repulsion.<br>
The conductive nanoparticles have charges on their surfaces in the<br>
dispersion sol. The surface charge mediating, agent can make the surface<br>
charges be stronger and all the nanoparticles have the same charges. Counter-<br>
ions surround the surface charges of the nanoparticles to form electrical double<br>
layers. As the double layers are thicker, the dispersion sol becomes more<br><br>
stable.<br>
While an isoelectric point of the surface in the conductive nanoparticles<br>
used in the present invention is variable in accordance with kinds and states of<br>
the nanoparticles, ATO has pHipe = 3.7 and ITO has pHipe =8.5. Thus, a<br>
suspension is stabilized in the conditions of pH &gt; 8 in ATO, while of pH 
ITO. The amount and kind of the surface charge mediating agent are preferred<br>
to be set in concordance with a dispersion condition because they are variable in<br>
accordance with the composition, the kinds and the additive amount of the<br>
nanoparticles. When an hydrochloric acid is used as a surface charge<br>
mediation agent for an ATO containing antimony of 10 wt%, it is available to<br>
use an acid of 5 x10-4 - 3.5 x 10-3 g per a nanoparticle of 1 g.<br>
The ITO nanoparticles has an isoelectric point higher different from the<br>
ATO nanoparticles and the mediation on the surface charges are determined in<br>
accordance with an object and use of the dispersion sol. In manufacturing a<br>
dispersion sol with a high concentration and a low viscosity, it is preferred to<br>
process it with a dispersing agent after dispersing the particles in the amphoteric<br>
solvent without mediating the surface charges. The kinds of acids usable in the<br>
present invention are organic acids, inorganic acids, and polymeric acids. The<br>
organic acids include acetic acids or glacial acetic acids, while the inorganic<br>
acids include hydrochloric acids, nitric acids, phosphoric acids, sulfuric acids,<br>
and so on. The polymeric acids include polyacrylic acids as an example. The<br>
kinds of the acids are not limited in the above and others are available thereto.<br>
(2) Dispersing agent: Dispersion by an effect of steric hindrance.<br>
A dispersing agent effective in the steric hindrance has two distinctive<br>
. structures as follows.<br>
a. The dispersing agent is able to be absorbingly adhesive to the<br>
surfaces of the conductive nanoparticles, retaining strong adhesion<br><br>
to a surface of a pigment because it has one or more functional<br>
radicals having affinities for the conductive nanoparticles.<br>
b. With hydrocarbon entities good for co-usability, after being<br>
absorbed on the conductive nanoparticles, the hydrocarbon entities<br>
 dangle from the araphoteric solvent around the conductive<br>
nanoparticles. Such a state, where the hydrocarbon entities are<br>
hanging down from the amphoteric solvent and absorbed on the<br>
surfaces of the conductive nanoparticles, is called steric hindrance<br>
or entropic stabilization.<br>
 Interactions between polymeric portions of the dispersion agent and the<br>
amphoteric solvent make envelopes around the conductive nanoparticles thicker,<br>
enforcing the stability thereof. Such stabilization enables the dispersion sol to<br>
be adaptable to all the hydroiic resin binders partially using the anti-hydrolic<br>
resin binders and solvents. The dispersing agent is assistant to a procedure of<br>
dispersing the conductive nanoparticles into the amphoteric solvent, or is<br>
assistant to a procedure of dispersing the conductive nanoparticles into the<br>
amphoteric solvent together with the surface charge mediating agent.<br>
Accordingly, the dispersion agent is effective in reducing the viscosity,<br>
preventing re-cohesion of the nanoparticles, by maintaining distances between<br>
the nanoparticles due to the electrostatic repulsion or the steric hindrance<br>
arising from the absorption to the dispersion sol dispersed into the amphoteric<br>
solvent.<br>
The dispersing agent is classified into one having an amiae radical and<br>
the other having an acid radical. In detail, it is available to use anti-terra-203,<br>
anti-terra-204, anti-terra-205, anti-terra-206, anti-terra-U, anti-terra-U100, anti-<br>

The coating film using the amphoteric solvent dispersion sol<br>
manufactured by the method of the present invention is a high surface resistance<br>
over 1x106 O-cm, which is advantageous to be adoptable to audio systems of<br>
various communication apparatuses and in automobiles because it is capable of<br>
transmitting radio frequencies emitted from mobile phones, televisions, or<br>
radios. The amount used in the dispersing agent is 1 -30 wt% in weight ratio<br>
to the conductive nanoparticles.<br>
4. Photopolymerization initiator<br>
It is available to add a photopolymerization initiator for the purpose of<br>
easily hardening the dispersion sol of the present invention when it is exposed to<br>
chemical rays (ultraviolet, infrared). Such photopolymerization initiators<br>
include 1-hydroxy-cyclo-hexyl-phenyl-ketone, benzyl-dimetyl-ketal, hydroxyl-<br>
dimetyl-aceto-phenone, benzoin, benzoin-metyl-ether, benzoin-isopropyl-ether,<br>
benzoin-butyl-ether, benzyl, benzophenone, 2-hydroxy-2-metylpropiophenone,<br>
2,2-dietoxy-ethophenone, antraquinone, chloroantraquinone, etylantraquinone,<br>
butylantraquinone, 2-chlorothyoksantone, alpha-chlorometylnaphthalene, and<br>
anthracene. In detail, there are Lucirin (Basf Co.), Darocur MBF, Igacure-184,<br>
Igacure-651, Igacure-819, Igacure-2005 (Ciba Geigy Co.), and so on. It is<br>
possible to combine more one agents among the photopolymerizalion initiators<br>
proposed above. A ratio of the photopolymerization initiators is preferred to<br>
be 0.1 ~ 10 wt% to 100 wt% of the dispersion sol, prederably 1 ~ 5 wt%.<br>
[Heat-ray cutoff coating film]<br>
1. Resin binder<br>
Although without a specific limitation in the kinds of the resin binders<br>
for the composition of the coating films, it is preferable to use one capable of<br>
forming a coating film with excellent transparency, and possible to select one or<br>
more two kinds in accordance with the condition of hardening such as ultraviolet<br>
hardening when there is co-usability between the resin binders. The hydrolic<br>
resin binders include water-soluble alkyd, polyvinylalcohol and<br>
polybutylalcohol, and hydrolic emulsion-type resin binders include acrylyl,<br>
acrylylstylene, and super-acid vinyl. Alcoholic resin binders include<br>
polyvinylbutyral and polyvinylacetal. Anti-hydrolic heat-hardening resin<br>
binders include acrylyl, polycarbonate, polychloride vinyl, urethane, melamine,<br>
alkyd, polyesther, and epoxy, while ultraviolet-hardening resin binders include<br>
epoxy acrylylate, polyether acrylylate, polyesther acrylylate, and urethane-<br>
metamorphosed acrylylate.<br>
The amount of the resin binder used, is 1 ~ 95 wt% for 100 wt% in a<br>
coating composition, preferably about 5-40 wt%<br>
2. Manufacturing heat-ray cutoff coating solution<br>
It is able to easily produce a heat-ray cutoff coating composition with<br>
superior properties in visible right transmission and heat-ray cutoff in low cost<br>
by mixing the resin binder with a sol obtained by dispersing the conductive<br><br>
nanoparticles in the amphoteric solvent.<br>
It is permissible to set a compounding ratio of the conductive<br>
nanoparticles dispersion sol and the resin binder from 97:3 to 30:70 in weight<br>
ratio, preferably 95:5 through 70:30.<br>
[Property of heat-ray cutoff coating film]<br>
There are a variety of ways to achieve coating of the composition for<br>
screening heat rays, such as spinal coating, deep coating, roll coating, bar.<br>
coating, screen printing, photogravure, microgravure, offset, and so on.<br>
A heat-ray cutoff coating film produced by the present invention has a<br>
structure that the conductive nanoparticles are uniformly distributed in a<br>
hydrolic or alcoholic, or anti-hydrolic resin binder. Such a heat-ray cutoff<br>
coating film displays its function of screening heat rays higher along much<br>
conductive nanoparticles used therein under the same conditions with the kinds<br>
of apparatus, conductive nanoparticles and additive. With the same amount of<br>
the conductive nanoparticles and the same amount of the additive, it is inclined<br>
to make an effect of screening heat rays higher as the conductance of the<br>
conductive nanoparticles, i.e., specific resistance is lower. For example, ATO<br>
nanoparticles, which has conductance variable dependent on an engagement<br>
ratio of antimony therein, is preferred to have its specific resistance under 10<br>
O-cm, preferably under 3.0 Ocm. Here, the best feature of screening heat rays<br>
appears from an ATO containing antimony of 10 wt% that corresponds to the<br>
lowest specific resistance.<br>
However, it is also inclined to cause a visible light transmission rate to<br>
be increased in accordance with an increase of the amount of antimony. Along<br>
the increase of antimony, a color of the ATO nanoparticles powder goes to pale<br>
blue-gray from blue-gray, from which a color of a coating film changes to<br><br>
yellowish green from blue. These changes of colors causes an absorption peak<br>
value to vary around a wavelength of 550 nm, which makes it predictable to<br>
change the visible light transmission rate. The absorption for a visible light is<br>
higher in a blue series while lower in a yellow, series.<br>
[Evaluation for heat-ray cutoff coating film]<br>
The coating film produced by the present invention was evaluated by<br>
means of the methods as follows.<br>
1. Optical characteristic<br>
A transmittance was carried out for light in the range of 200 nm through<br>
2500 nm by means of ITV/VIS/NIR Spectrometer (CARY SG, Varian Co.).<br>
(1) Visible light transmittance (VLT):<br>
The visible light transmittance was represented in a value obtained by<br>
calculating a ratio of a transmitted pencil to an incident pencil of sunlight on the<br>
standard of ASTM E903-82 (JIS R 3106, KS L2514), after measuring spectrum<br>
transmittance at 41 wavelength points every 10 nm in the range from 380 nm to<br>
780 nm by means of a spectrum photometer. The sunlight means a distribution<br>
of relative spectro-illumination in the scope of mixed direct and scattered light,<br>
as composite sunlight for designing illumination offered by International<br>
Commission on Illumination (CIE). The pencil means a wavelength integral<br>
with a product of spectro-emission flux and spectro-luminous efficiency.<br>
(2)IR cutoff<br>
The 1R cutoff represents an area ratio excepting an integral value of a<br>
transmitted area over the overall size after measuring a transmittance in the<br>
range of wavelength 800 ~ 1800 nm by means of a spectrum photometer.<br>
2. Endurance against wearing (measuring surface hardening)<br>
Pencil hardening intensity was measured on the standard of JIS K5651-<br>
1966<br>
3. Adhesion property<br>
A laminate test was performed with a cross-cut cellotape for a hardened<br>
coating film.<br>
In detail, a cellotape attaches and strip off three times from the coating<br>
film in which cutout lines reaching a substrate are inserted in the pitch of 1 mm<br>
with hundred scales of 1 mm2, the cutout lines being arranged crosswise and<br>
lengthwise in number of 11.<br>
o: No lamination of a crosslinked hardened coating film.<br>
A: The case that the number of lamination scales is 1 ~ 50.<br>
*: The case that the number of lamination scales is 51 ~ 100.<br>
4. Surface smoothness<br>
Monitoring flatness of the coating film, after being hardened, by means<br>
of vision or an electro-microscopy was carried out.<br>
o: Excellent as like a mirror face<br>
A: Some disordered on the surface<br>
x; So many wrinkles on the surface<br>
5. Weatherability <br>
It represented that "o" corresponds to when visible light and sunlight<br>
i transmittance retain over 80 % of their initial values contemporaneously, after<br>
illuminating for 2000 hours in a carbon arc sunshine weathermeter, while<br>
"x"corresponds when under 80 % of their initial values.<br>
6. Preservation stability<br>
It represented deterioration along a lapse of time in accordance with<br>
variations of phase separation, cohesion, and an increase of viscosity.<br>
[Manufacturing dispersion sol of conductive nanoparticles]<br>
[Example 1]<br>

amphoteric solvent of 120 ~ 160g, zirconia balls were charged up to 50 vol%<br>
L<br>
and then dispersed in the mixed solution for 24 hours. And, disperbyk-180<br>
(BYK Chemie Co.), as a dispersing agent, of 2 ~ l0g was added thereto and<br>
uniformly mixed therewith by an agitator, so that a high performance ITO<br>
nanoparticles dispersion sol was obtained with good co-usability to hydrolic or<br>
alcoholic, or anti-hydrolic resin binders. In the case of mixing the ITO<br>
nanoparticles with an ultraviolet hardening jesin binder, a photo-initiator<br>
Irgacurel84 (Ciba Geigy Co.) of 1 ~ 5g was added thereto to obtain the<br>
dispersion sol.<br>

s contain antimony of 5, 10, 15 and 20% in weight ratio, and an amphoteric<br>
solvent of 120 ~ 160g, zirconia balls were charged up to 50 vol% and then<br>

nanoparticles. And, Anti-Terra-Ul00 (BYK Chemie Co.). as a dispersing agent,<br>
of 2 ~ l0g was added thereto and uniformly mixed therewith by an agitator, so<br>
that a high performance ATO nanoparticles dispersion sol was obtained with<br>
good co-usability to hydrolic or alcoholic, or anti-hydrolic resin binders. In<br>
the case of mixing the ATO nanoparticles with an ultraviolet hardening resin<br>
binder, a photo-initiator Irgacurel84 (Ciba Geigy Co.) of 1 ~ 5g was added<br>
thereto to obtain the dispersion sol.<br>

deposition film, which had been made from an ultraviolet hardening resin (solid<br>
powder 100%, SK-UCB Co.) of acrylate series, in an agitator, after adjusting a<br>
volume ratio on conductive nanoparticles : binder = 5:95 ~ 80:20.<br>
A heat-ray cutoff film was obtained from that after coating a heat-ray<br>

was evaporated by hot air and then the coating film was hardened by being<br>
irradiated with a high-pressure mercury lamp of 100W in a conveying velocity<br>

(the samples #9~32), which were formed by dispersing the conductive<br>
nanoparticles in the amphoteric solvent or the hydrochloric acid, are similar to<br>
those of the samples #1~8 shown in Table 1. In other words, while the former<br>
examples used solvents different in polarity, the present invention was able to<br>
obtain the similar results even with a resin binder belonging to the same series,<br>
i.e., an ultraviolet hardening resin. By the contrary, in the cases of the<br>
comparisons 3~5, the non-polarized organic solvent, like toluene, xylene, and<br>
benzene, and the hydrochloric acid did not effective in dispersing the ATO as the<br>
conductive nanoparticles. In order to conduct dispersion to a non-polarized<br>
