(Section 10;   Rule 13)<br>
"SLIDING MOTION SIGN BILLBOARD".<br>
MR.	NALAVDE	PRADEEP<br>
KASHINATH (Indian National), having office at B5 Sindhi Colony, Near Baneshwar Mandir, Sasmira College Lane, Worli, Mumbai- 400 025, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention &amp; the manner in which it is performed:<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a  Sliding Motion Sign Billboard". Description of prior arts:-<br>
Large bill boards displaying advertising or public service Messages are common sight along roadways and other areas for communicating messages to the public are common type of billboard has a front display face that is fourteen feet high and forty- eight feet<br>
wide.<br>
in  past, such display messages were painted or printed on a paper-like sheet of Material, which was then cut into strips or sections that could be pasted or otherwise adhered to the front free of the billboard.<br>
In the cited document US 5613314, A collapsible sign, including a fixed frame, a plurality of sections hingedly and movabiy attached to the frame, the sign being movable the sections between a viewing position and a collapsed position. Adjacent pairs of the plurality of sections are positioned to provide an offset distance between axes of rotation located at each end of each section when the plurality of sections are in the viewing position.<br>
In the cited document US4862615, channel-shaped base member is secured to the rear of the  panel structure and includes a ratcheted clip member slidably connected to the base<br>
members.<br>
One available prior art is called "Triod" which comprises of a plurality of triangular prisms (1) vertically aligned side by side as shown in Figure 1. Each prism (1) is connected to a horizontal rod so that all the prisms can be rotated at one instant of time. Each prism (1) has 3 surfaces - surface V, surface "b" and surface V. The picture to be displayed is divided into equal number of parts and each part is pasted on surface "a" of each prism . similarly eqal parts of a second picture are posted on surface "b" of each prism, and likewise on surface "c".<br><br>
When first picture is to be displayed, the surface "a" of each prism is brought to the front after a certain amount of time, each prism (1) is simultaneously rotated through 120 ° so that surface "b" of each prism comes into the front view to display the second picture. The prism (i) is further rotated through 120 ° for the third picture. The lights are mounted over the top front side and bottom front side of the board.<br>
Another prior art called scroll-sign comprises of 2 vertical or horizontal rods (2) mounted at a distance as shown in figure 2. The two rods (2) are connected to a motor, such that when the motor starts both the rods rotate in the same direction. A sheet (3) with a number of posters pasted side-by-side is rolled around both these rods, so that at a time exactly one poster is displayed. For the next poster, the motor and consequently the two rods (2) have to be rotated through a certain number of rotations.<br>
However, these prior art have certain disadvantages as compared to present invention. Some of them are mentioned below:-<br>
The process of positioning a display message on such billboards and replacing one display message with another, has been found to be expensive, time-consuming and cumbersome.<br>
The person involved in anchoring and tensioning the display sheet are required to carry a large number of the strap and ratchet wheel mechanisms when climbing on to the rear face of the bill board.<br>
in  the case of the large billboards mentioned above the erection, anchoring and tensioning of sheet material billboard display frequently takes several hours to accomplish and present great danger and difficulty to persons performing the task.<br>
hi case of Triod, maximum three posters can be displayed.<br>
Further, no backlighting is possible since the prisms of Triod are solid and opaque. Hence lights have to be mounted in the front on the outside, which reduces the aesthetic value of the advertisement.<br>
3<br><br>
In presently available Triods, the prisms rotate in only one direction.<br>
In case of scroll signs, after scrolling through the available number of posters, to come back to the first one, the entire stretch of sheet has to be rewound.<br>
Further the appearance of scroll-sign is very simple.<br>
Size of scroll-signs is limited to 3" x 6 * maximum.<br>
Object of the present invention:-<br>
The main object of the present invention is to develop a sign which can accommodate more than 3 posters,   s<br>
Backlighting should be possible for the present invention so as to provide better visual.<br>

It should be understood that the present invention can be of any shape depending upon the requirements of the advertisement; hence the accompanying figures are not limiting in any respect but are merely for illustrative purpose.<br>
Description of the present invention:-<br>
The following descriptions are of exemplary embodiments of the invention only, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention in any way. Rather, the following description is intended to provide convenient illustrations for implementing different embodiments of the immtion, As wiJJ become nppmtnt, various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of the elements described in these embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
The present invention comprises of a plurality of sliding units. A sliding unit has two<br>
transparent acrylic rods (12) mounted vertically a certain distance apart from each other.<br>
Another rod (5) of a greater diameter is mounted at an equal distance from both the<br>
acrylic tods (12), such that the three rods form the three vertical edges of an isosceles<br>
4<br><br>
triangular prism. (An isosceles triangle is a triangle with two equal and opposite sides and one unequal side between them). The said thicker rod (5) is made of metal with rubber coating. An Aluminium plate (14) is mounted horizontally between the three rods for support.It is connected to each of the rods through a pair of ball bearings (13). The plate (14) has a central slot for a fluorescent tubelight (16) to be fixed vertically. A plurality of such Aluminium plates is mounted horizontally between the three rods, one over other with an equal distance between them, as shown in Figure 9. A flex sheet (15) is wrapped around the three rods so as to enclose the entire structure. The said flex sheet accommodates one part each of at least 7 pictures at a given time.<br>
The metal rod (5) has a gear (4) at its bottom which is in contact with a threaded horizontal bar (6). The distance between the adjacent threads on the said horizontal bar (6) is equal to the distance between any two adjacent teeth of the gear (4). The horizontal bar (6) is connected at one end to a threaded gear (7) which is attached to a motor (8). Thus the rotational motion of the motor (8) is transferred through the gears and horizontal bar (6) to the metal rod (5) and thus the flex sheet (15) moves. The metal rod (5) can rotate either in clockwise or in anticlockwise direction.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the sliding units are arranged as shown in figure 3.<br>
In another embodiment, the shape of the billboard is curved as shown in figure 5. In yet another embodiment, the shape of the billboard is circular; a part of which is shown in figure 6. In these two embodiments, the arrangement of gears is as shown in figure 7. The metal rod (5) from each sliding unit is formed into a conical gear (9) which is connected to another conical gear (9) on a threaded rod (10). This threaded rod is in turn connected to a horizontal threaded bar (11) which is connected to a motor (8) through conical gears (9). The length of each threaded rod (10) will depend on the curve of the billboard.<br>
Advantages;-<br>
In the present invention, seven posters can be displayed.<br>
5<br><br>
Lighting is done from within since the fluorescent tubeiight is mounted inside the sliding<br>
unit.<br>
The sliding unit can roll in any direction hence different visual effects can be obtained.<br>
After scrolling through to the last poster, automatically the first poster is displayed. Hence no rewinding is required as in scroll signs.<br>
6<br><br>
