Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2-[phenothiazin-10-yl]ethylmethane sulphonate of the formula (1).<br><br>
The compound of formula (1) is an intermediate for the preparation of many pharmaceutically active compounds.<br>
Several synthetic processes have been reported for the preparation of 2-[phenothiazin-10-yl]ethanol of the formula (4), which is an important intermediate in the preparation of 2"[phenothia2in-10-yl]ethylmethane sulphonate of formula (1).<br>
B. Dahlbom [Swed. 129, 842 (1950), Acta, Chem, Scand, 6, 310 (1952)], described the preparation of 2-[phenothia2in-10-yl]ethanol of the formula (4) by reaction of lOH-phenothiazine of the formula (2) with ethylene oxide in presence of condensing agent such as alkali amides, PhONa, or EtC02Li in toluene. The reaction is shown in scheme-1 below :<br><br>
This process has the following drawbacks :<br>
• Ethyleneoxide used for N-alkylation of lOH-phenothiazine of the formula (2) is a low boiling solvent and will polymerise easily into polyethylene oxide, which poses handling problem in bulk quantities.<br><br>
•   The reaction is carried out using moisture sensitive pyrophoric reagents such as NaNH2, which needs careful handling.<br>
M.G. Canquil, A Casadorall and M.E. Casadovall (Bull Soc. Chim,, France, 1566 (I960)] described the process for preparation of 2-[phenothiazin-10-yl]ethanol of the formula (4) by initial fusion reaction of lO-H-phenothiazine of the formula (2) with Lithium metal, followed by reaction of 10-lithiophenic thiazine with ethyleneoxide. The reaction is shown in scheme-2 below :<br><br>
0. Saburo, U. Koji [Japan Kokai, 74, 40, 675 (1974), CA 82 : 170988p (1975)] described the process for the preparation of 2-[phenothiazin-10-yl]ethanol of the formula (4) by initial fusion reaction of lOH-phenothiazine of the formula (2) with KOH at 30 °C, followed by reaction of potassium salt of phenothiazine with ethylene oxide in xylene medium. The reaction is shown in scheme-4 below :<br><br><br>
Scheme-4<br>
The processes described in the above schemes have the following drawbacks.<br>
•	The reactions are carried out at very high temperatures ranging from 200-300<br>
°C, which is very difficult for scale-up operations and also from safety point of<br>
view.<br>
•	At very high temperature charring of the RM was observed, affecting the yield.<br>
•	Ethylene oxide or ethylene carbonate used for N-alkylation of phenothiazine of<br>
the formula (4) can lead to radical polymerization, which poses handling<br>
problem in bulk quantities.<br>
In view of the importance of the compound of formula (1), it is essential to have a commercially viable, cost effective, high yielding process for preparing the compound of formula (1).<br>
Objective of the invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved process for the preparation of 2-[phenothiazin-10-yl]ethylmethane sulphonate of the formula (1).<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of 2-[phenothiazin-10-yl]ethylmethane sulphonate of the formula (1), avoiding pyrophoric reagents, thereby making the process easy to operate in commercial scales .<br>
The objective of the present invention has been achieved by employing polar aprotic solvents such as DMF, DMSO, DMAc and the like and avoiding column chromatography.<br><br>
Detailed description of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of 2-<br>
[phenothiazin-10-yi]ethylmethane sulphonate of the formula (1), which comprises :<br>
i).       N-alkylating the lOH-phenothiazine of the formula (2) with 2-haIoethanol of<br>
the formula (8) in the presence of a polar aprotic solvent and a nucleophilic organic or<br>
inorganic base to get 2-[phenothiazin-10-yl]ethanol of the formula (4),<br>
ii).       mesylating the 2-[phenothiazin-10-yl]ethanol of the formula (4) obtained in<br>
step (i) to yield compound of formula (1) by treating with methane sulphonyl chloride<br>
in the presence of an organic base and an organic solvent and<br>
iii).      isolating the compound of formula (1) by conventional methods.<br><br>
The N-alkylation lOH-phenothiazine of the formula (2) with 2-haloethanol of formula (8) wherein X represents halogen atom such as chlorine, fluorine, bromine or iodine in step (i) may be carried out using reagents such as 2-bromoethanol, 2-chloroethanol or 2-iodoethanol. This N-alkylation may' be affected in the presence of polar aprotic solvents such as DMF, DMSO, DMAc and the like in the presence of nucleophilic organic or inorganic bases such as sodium hydride, t-BuOH, and sodium methoxide. The yield of the resultant, 2-[phenothia2in-10-yl]ethanol of the formula (4) is in the order of 57-66 % and purity of 99 %. This compound can be used directly for the next step without purification involving column chromatography, thereby saving the time and cost. The reaction of 2-[phenothiazin-10-yl] with methane sulfonyl chloride may be carried out in the presence of solvent such as DCM, DCE, toluene and the like and a base such as triethylamine, tributylamine and the like. The final compound namely 2-[phenothiazin-10-yl]ethylmethane sulfonate of,the formula (1) is obtained in quantitative yield and purity of 99 %.<br><br>

DMF (200 ml) was added to the washed sodium hydride, freed from oil and toluene. lOH-phenothiazine (100 g) in DMF (100 ml) was added dropwise to the mixture in about 30 min. 2-Chloroethanol (87.3 g) in DMF (50 ml) was added at 50-60 °C in about 1 h. After addition, the reaction mass was maintained at room temperature for 1 h, monitoring the reaction by TLC.
