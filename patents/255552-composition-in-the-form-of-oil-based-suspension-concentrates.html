				<td>Oil-based suspension concentrates<br>
The present invention relates to new, oil-based suspension concentrates of cyclic keto enols, to a process for producing these formulations and to their use for applying the cyclic keto enols comprised.<br>
Numerous water-free suspension concentrates of active agrochemical substances have already been disclosed. For instance EP-A 0 789 999 describes formulations of this type which in addition to active substance and oil comprise a mixture of different surfactants - including some which serve as penetrants - and also a hydrophobicized aluminophyllosilicate thickener. The stability of these preparations is good. A disadvantage, however, is the mandatory presence of a thickener, since it makes production more complex. Moreover, the thickener absorbs in each case some of the added amount of penetrant, which is therefore unavailable for its proper function.<br>
From US-A 6 165 940, moreover, nonaqueous suspension concentrates are already known in which besides active agrochemical substance, penetrant and surfactant or surfactant mixture there is an organic solvent, suitable solvents of this type including liquid paraffin or vegetable oil esters. The crop tolerance and/or biological activity and/or the stability of the spray liquors preparable from these formulations by dilution with water is, however, not always sufficient.<br>
New, oil-based suspension concentrates have now been found which are composed of at least one room-temperature-solid compound of the formula (F)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which<br>
V        is oxygen or N-D,<br>
X        is halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy or cyano,<br><br>
W, Y and Z independently of one another are hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy or cyano,<br>
A is hydrogen, in each case optionally halogen-substituted alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, saturated, optionally substituted cycloalkyl, in which optionally at least one ring atom is replaced by a heteroatom,<br>
B        is hydrogen or alkyl,<br>
A and B together with the carbon atom to which they are attached are a saturated or unsaturated, unsubstituted or substituted ring optionally including at least one heteroatom,<br>
D is hydrogen or an optionally substituted radical from the series alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyalkyl, saturated cycloalkyl, in which optionally one or more ring members are replaced by heteroatoms,<br>
A and D together with the atoms to which they are attached are a saturated or unsaturated ring which optionally includes at least one heteroatom and is unsubstituted or substituted in the A,D moiety,<br>
G        is hydrogen (a) or is one of the groups<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br><br>
in which<br>
E        is a metal ion or an ammonium ion,<br>
L        is oxygen or sulphur,<br>
M       is oxygen or sulphur,<br><br>
R1 is in each case optionally halogen-substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy-alkyl, alkylthioalkyl, polyalkoxyalkyl or optionally halogen-, alkyl- or alkoxy-substituted cycloalkyl which may be interrupted by at least one heteroatom, or in each case optionally substituted phenyl, phenylalkyl, hetaryl, phenoxyalkyl or hetaryloxyalkyl,<br>
R2 is in each case optionally halogen-substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy-alkyl, polyalkoxyalkyl or is in each case optionally substituted cycloalkyl, phenyl or benzyl,<br>
R3 is optionally halogen-substituted alkyl or optionally substituted phenyl,<br>
R4 and R5 independently of one another are in each case optionally halogen-substituted alkyl, alkoxy, alkylamino, dialkylamino, alkylthio, alkenyl-thio, cycloalkylthio or are in each case optionally substituted phenyl, benzyl, phenoxy or phenylthio, and<br>
R6 and R7 independently of one another are hydrogen, in each case optionally halogen-substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, are optionally substituted phenyl, are optionally substituted benzyl or together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached are an optionally oxygen- or sulphur-interrupted optionally substituted ring, and<br>
at least one penetrant,<br>
at least one vegetable oil,<br>
at least one nonionic surfactant and/or at least one anionic surfactant, and<br>
optionally one or more additives from the groups of the emulsifiers, foam inhibitors, preservatives, antioxidants, colorants and/or inert filler materials.<br>
Additionally it has been found that the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention can be produced by mixing<br><br>
at least one room-temperature-solid compound of the formula (I1),<br>
at least one penetrant,<br>
at least one vegetable oil,<br>
at least one nonionic surfactant and/or at least one anionic surfactant, and<br>
optionally one or more additives from the groups of the emulsifiers, foam inhibitors, preservatives, antioxidants, colorants and/or inert filler materials<br>
with one another and optionally subsequently grinding the resultant suspension.<br>
Finally it has been found that the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention are highly suitable for applying the compounds of the formula (I1) comprised to plants and/or their habitat.<br>
It is to be considered extremely surprising that the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention exhibit a much better crop tolerance despite the fact that the biological action/uptake of foreign substances in plant tissue is clearly higher in comparison to the existing formulations most similar in composition. This effect could not have been foreseen on the basis of the prior art already described.<br>
The oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention are also notable for a series of advantages. For instance, their production is less complex than the preparation of corresponding formulations in which there are thickeners. A further advantage is that, when the concentrates of the invention are diluted with water, there is neither significant creaming nor disruptive flocculation, which is frequently the case with existing preparations of this kind. Finally, the formulations of the invention promote the crop tolerance and/or biological activity of the active components comprised, so that in comparison to conventional preparations either a higher activity is obtained or less active substance is needed.<br>

of compound of the formula (I1) are generally between 5% and 30%, preferably between 10% and 25% by weight,<br>
of penetrant are generally between 5% and 30%, preferably between 15% and 25% by weight,<br>
of vegetable oil are generally between 20% and 55%, preferably between 25% and 50% by weight,<br>
of surfactants are generally between 2.5% and 30%, preferably between 5.0% and 25% by weight, and<br>
of additives are generally between 0% and 25%, preferably between 0% and 20% by weight.<br>
The oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention are produced by mixing the components with one another in the respectively desired proportions. The order in which the constituents are combined with one another is arbitrary. Appropriately the solid components are used in a finely ground state. It is, however, also possible to subject the suspension which results after the constituents have been combined first to a coarse grinding and then to a fine grinding, so that the mean particle size is below 20 [*m. Preferred suspension concentrates are those in which the solid particles have a mean size between 1 and 10 um.<br>
The temperatures when carrying out the process of the invention can be varied within a certain range. The work is carried out generally at temperatures between 10°C and 60°C, preferably between 15°C and 40°C. Equipment suitable for carrying out the process of the invention includes customary mixing and grinding apparatus which is used for producing agrochemical formulations.<br>
The oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention constitute formulations which remain stable even following prolonged storage at elevated temperatures or in the cold, since no crystal growth is observed. By dilution with water they can be converted into homogeneous spray liquids. These spray liquids are applied by customary methods, i.e., for example, by spraying, pouring or injecting.<br>
The application rate of the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention can be varied within a relatively wide range. It is guided by the particular active agrochemical substances and by their amount in the formulations.<br>
With the aid of the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention it is possible to deliver active agrochemical substances to plants and/or their habitat in a particularly advantageous way. The active agrochemical substances included develop a better biological activity (in particular a better insecticidal action and/or better crop<br>
tolerance) than in the case of application in the form of the corresponding conventional formulations.<br>
In accordance with the invention it is possible to treat all plants and plant parts. By plants here are meant all plants and plant populations, such as desirable and unwanted wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants may be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and gene-technological methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars which can or cannot be protected by varietal property rights. By plant parts are to be meant all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of the plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, an exemplary listing embracing leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material and also vegetative and generative propagation material, examples being seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment of the plants and plant parts in accordance with the invention with the suspension concentrates is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or storage area in accordance with the customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, squirting, evaporating, atomizing, or brush application and, in the case of propagation material, especially seeds, additionally by single or multiple coating.<br>
As already mentioned above, all plants and their parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. In one preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant varieties, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and also parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment transgenic plants and plant varieties, which have been obtained by gene-technological methods in combination where appropriate with conventional methods (genetic modified organisms), and parts thereof, are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been elucidated above.<br>
With particular preference, plants of the plant varieties that are in each case available commercially or in use are treated in accordance with the invention. By plant varieties are meant plants having novel properties (traits) which have been bred by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They may be varieties, biotypes and genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant varieties, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, nutrition) the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive (synergistic) effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or extensions in the spectrum of action and/or an increase in the effect of the substances and compositions that can be used in accordance with the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water content or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvesting yields, greater quality and/or higher nutritional value of the harvested products, higher storage capacity and/or processing capability of the harvested products are possible that go beyond the effects that were actually to be expected.<br>
The preferred transgenic (i.e., obtained by gene technology) plants or plant varieties for treatment in accordance with the invention include all plants which by virtue of the gene-technological modification received genetic material which endows these plants with particularly advantageous, valuable traits. Examples of such traits are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water content or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvesting yields, greater quality and/or higher nutritional value of the harvested products, higher storage capacity and/or processing capability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such traits are a heightened defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to particular active herbicidal substances. Examples of transgenic plants include the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape, beet, sugar cane and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples,<br>
pears, citrus fruits and grapes), particular emphasis being given to maize, soya, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits given particular emphasis are the heightened defence of the plants against insects, by means of toxins which form in the plants, particularly those generated in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) ("Bt plants" below). Further traits given particular emphasis are the increased defence of plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses as a result of Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and also resistance genes, and proteins and toxins expressed accordingly. Further traits given particular emphasis include the increased tolerance of the plants to certain active herbicidal substances, examples being imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (e.g. "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in each case may also occur in combinations with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples that may be mentioned of "Bt plants" include maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (e.g. maize, cotton, soya), KnockOut® (e.g. maize), StarLink® (e.g. maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples that may be mentioned of herbicide-tolerant plants include maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, e.g. maize, cotton, soya), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, e.g. oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, e.g. maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (bred conventionally for herbicide tolerance) that may be mentioned also include the varieties (e.g. maize) sold under the name Clearfield®. It will be appreciated that these remarks also apply to plant varieties to be developed in the future or to appear on the market in the future and possessing these genetic traits or genetic traits developed in the future.<br>
The plants recited can be treated with particular advantage with the suspension concentrates of the invention. The ranges of preference indicated above for the suspension concentrates also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis may be given to the treatment of plants with the suspension concentrates recited specifically in the present text.<br>
