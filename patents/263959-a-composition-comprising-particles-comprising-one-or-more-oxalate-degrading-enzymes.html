RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/750,896, filed December 16, 2005, which is herein incorporated in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising one or more oxalate<br>
degrading enzymes for delivering the enzymes in active form to the stomach, where the one or<br>
more oxalate degrading enzymes exert their effect. Thus, the present invention provides means<br>
for reducing oxalate in the stomach. A composition of the invention comprises particles<br>
comprising one or more oxalate degrading enzymes embedded in a first polymeric material,<br>
wherein the embedded enzyme retains at least two times the activity of the one or more non-<br>
embedded free enzymes obtained from the same batch upon incubation in USP simulated gastric<br>
juice at 37°C for at least 60 min under similar conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Kidney/urinary tract stone disease (urolithiasis) is a major health problem throughout the<br>
world. Most of the stones associated with urolithiasis are composed of calcium oxalate alone or<br>
calcium oxalate plus calcium phosphate. Other disease states have also been associated with<br>
excess oxalate. These include, vulvodynia, oxalosis associated with end-stage renal disease,<br>
cardiac conductance disorders, Crohns's disease, and other enteric disease states.<br>
Oxalic acid, and/or its salts, oxalate, is found in a wide variety of foods, and is therefore,<br>
a component of many constituents in human and animal diets. Increased oxalate absorption may<br>
occur after foods containing elevated amounts of oxalic acid are eaten. Foods such as spinach<br>
and rhubarb are well known to contain high amounts of oxalate, but a multitude of other foods<br>
and beverages also contain oxalate. Because oxalate is found in such a wide variety of foods,<br>
diets that are low in oxalate and which are also palatable are hard to formulate. In addition,<br>
compliance with a low oxalate diet is often problematic.<br>
The risk for formation of kidney stones revolves around a number of factors that are not<br>
yet completely understood. Kidney or urinary tract stone disease occurs in as many as 12 % of<br>
the population in Western countries and about 70% of these stones are composed of calcium<br>
oxalate or of calcium oxalate plus calcium phosphate. Some individuals (e.g. patients with<br>
intestinal disease such as Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or steatorrhea and also<br>
patients that have undergone jejunoileal bypass surgery) absorb more of the oxalate in their diets<br>
than do others. For these individuals, the incidence of oxalate urolithiasis increases markedly.<br><br>
The increased disease incidence is due to increased levels of oxalate in kidneys and urine, and<br>
this, the most common hyperoxaluric syndrome in humans, is known as enteric hyperoxaluria.<br>
Oxalate is also a problem in patients with end-stage renal disease and there is recent evidence<br>
that elevated urinary oxalate is also involved in vulvar vestibulitis (vulvodynia).<br>
Enteric coated compositions comprising oxalate degrading bacteria have been suggested<br>
for reducing oxalate concentrations. However, enteric coated compositions pass through the<br>
stomach in intact form, i.e. the coating is intact and accordingly, no Oxalate can be degraded in<br>
the stomach. Accordingly, there is still a need for developing compositions that enable<br>
degradation of oxalate already in the stomach in order to degrade especially dietary oxalate.<br>
Moreover, such compositions are suitable for use in the treatment of enteric and absorptive<br>
hyperoxalurias such as hyperoxalurias causing recurrent stone disease. The objective with such<br>
a treatment is for the patients to have normal urinary oxalate levels.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention comprises compositions and methods for treating and preventing<br>
oxalate-related conditions. Compositions of the present invention comprise enzymes that<br>
reduce oxalate. Methods of the present invention comprise administering the compositions to<br>
treat or prevent oxalate-related conditions, and methods for making and using such<br>
compositions. Compositions of the present invention reduce oxalate under gastric conditions,<br>
such as low pH and in the presence of proteases. Composition of the present invention reduce<br>
oxalate in the stomach of humans and other animals. Compositions reduce non-systemic<br>
oxalate, e.g. oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract, notably in the stomach, and preventing<br>
exogenous oxalate (e.g. from food) from entering the systemic circulation.<br>
A composition according to the present invention comprises particles comprising one or<br>
more enzymes embedded in a first polymeric material, wherein the embedded enzymes retain at<br>
least two times the activity of the one or more non-embedded enzymes from the same batch,<br>
after incubation of both the embedded and the non-embedded (free) enzymes in simulated<br>
gastric fluid (84 mM HCl and 3.2 mg/ml pepsin at pH ranging from 1.0 to 4.0) at 37°C for at<br>
least 60 minutes. Compositions comprise particles that may further be coated with a second<br>
polymeric material. Compositions may also comprise polymeric materials that may be cross-<br>
linked, and optionally, the cross-links may be reduced. In specific embodiments, the first<br>
polymeric material is chitosan, alginate, pectin or hyaluronic acid. In addition to the one or more<br>
enzymes and the first polymeric material, the particle compositions may also contain one or<br>
more additives such as, e.g., pH adjusting agents, buffering agents, solubilizing agents,<br><br>
stabilizers, preservatives, cofactors for the enzymes or one or more pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipients such as, e.g. fillers, diluents, carriers or the like.<br>
Methods of the present invention comprise providing compositions for non-systemic<br>
treatment, for example, providing a composition that enables reducing oxalate in the stomach to<br>
avoid the absorption of oxalate from the gastrointestinal tract. The composition protects the<br>
oxalate-reducing enzymes embedded .therein from the acidic and enzyme-damaging<br>
environment in the stomach, and maintains the enzymatic activity in such a harsh environment.<br>
Methods of treatment and prevention comprise providing the compositions taught herein in<br>
which one or more oxalate degrading enzyme are embedded in a first polymeric material,<br>
optionally coating the obtained particles with a second polymeric material, optionally cross-<br>
linking the first and/or second polymeric material and optionally reducing the cross-linkages.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are suitable in methods of treatment or<br>
prevention of oxalate-related conditions including, but not limited to, hyperoxaluria, absorptive<br>
hyperoxaluria, enteric hyperoxaluria, primary hyperoxaluria, idiopathic calcium oxalate kidney<br>
stone disease (urolithiasis), vulvodynia, oxalosis associated with end-stage renal disease, cardiac<br>
conductance disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and<br>
patients who have undergone gastrointestinal surgery and bariatric surgery (surgery for obesity),<br>
and/or who have undergone antibiotic treatment. A method of treatment or prevention<br>
comprises orally administering to a subject a composition of the present invention, in an<br>
effective amount, to reduce the oxalate in the stomach of the subject, and thus reduce the overall<br>
oxalate burden of the subject in an efficient and effective manner. Such compositions are<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable for oral administration.<br>
Enzymes used in the compositions and methods of the present invention are oxalate<br>
reducing enzymes, and include, but are not limited to, oxalate oxidase, oxalate decarboxylase (in<br>
the present context abbreviated OxDc), oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, or formyl-CoA transferase,<br>
or combinations thereof. Moreover, other enzymes, cofactors and co-enzymes that are<br>
substituents of oxalate degradation pathways or involved in oxalate metabolic pathways,<br>
particularly oxalate reduction, are also of relevance alone or in combination with one or more of<br>
the oxalate reducing enzymes. In the present invention,, not only the enzymes (proteins) are<br>
encompassed by this definition, but also polynucleotide sequences that encode oxalate-reducing<br>
genes and proteins are contemplated by the present invention. The present invention also<br>
contemplates any binding partners of these enzymes and includes antibodies and antibody<br>
fragments that bind to or interact with the enzymes.<br><br>
The enzymes may be derived by isolation from organisms, they may be purified, they<br>
may be made synthetically, semi-synthetically or by recombinant means, or they may be used as<br>
a cell lysate. The enzymes used in the compositions may be purified recombinant protein, but<br>
since the enzymes can also be made in certain bacteria that are safe, it is also contemplated to<br>
use those bacteria as whole cells or as lysate.<br>
The oxalate-degrading enzyme is normally present in a composition of the invention in an<br>
amount that is sufficient to degrade substantially all oxalate normally present in a standard meal.<br>
Depending on the food choices, an average Western diet can contain 100 to 300 mg of<br>
oxalate/day. In general, about 0.2g of the particles comprising enzyme (equal to 20 mg of OxDc<br>
in 1 mL of suspension of particles) can remove 180 mg oxalate in simulated gastric conditions<br>
within 30 min.<br>
One aspect the present invention comprises a composition comprising particles<br>
comprising one or more oxalate degrading enzymes embedded in a first polymeric material,<br>
wherein the embedded enzyme retains at least two times the activity of the one or more non-<br>
embedded free enzymes, obtained from the same batch, upon incubation in USP simulated<br>
gastric juice containing 84 mM HCl and 3.2 mg/ml pepsin at pH&gt;l, e.g. in a range of pH about<br>
1 to pH about 5, such as, e.g., from pH about 2 to pH about 5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about<br>
4.5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about 3.5 such as pH about 3 at 37°C for at least 60 minutes.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention comprises compositions and methods for treating and preventing<br>
oxalate-related conditions. Compositions of the present invention comprise enzymes that reduce<br>
oxalate. The compositions of the present invention are designed so that the enzymes retain their<br>
activity even if the compositions are subjected to a gastric environment, Methods of the present<br>
invention comprise administering the compositions to treat or prevent oxalate-related<br>
conditions, and methods for making and using such compositions. More specific, the invention<br>
relates to a composition that is designed to enable reduction of oxalate under gastric conditions,<br>
thereby enabling a reduction of oxalate already in the stomach. Such a composition is<br>
specifically designed to reduce non-systemic oxalate, e.g. oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract,<br>
notably in the stomach, and preventing exogenous oxalate (e.g. from food) from entering the<br>
systemic circulation.<br>
As mentioned above, the background of the present invention was the need to be able to<br>
administer oxalate degrading enzymes to the stomach in order to degrade dietary oxalate and<br><br>
prevent the uptake of oxalate from the stomach and intestinal tract, which prevents oxalate-<br>
related diseases and disorders, such as, e.g., hyperoxaluria, primary hyperoxaluria, idiopathic<br>
calcium oxalate kidney stone disease (urothiliasis), and especially the absorptive and enteric<br>
hyperoxaluria. The administered enzymes are protected from the protein degradation and/or pH<br>
or acidic dependent degradation occurring under gastric conditions of the stomach, i.e. low pH<br>
and in the presence of pepsin.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to a composition, wherein the enzymes are embedded<br>
in a polymeric material which protects the enzymes from degradation under gastric conditions.<br>
It can be envisaged that this composition may comprise any enzyme, but for the purpose of the<br>
present invention, oxalate degrading enzymes, such as, e.g., oxalate decarboxylase, oxalate<br>
oxidase, or a combination of oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase and formyl CoA transferase, or a<br>
combination of any of these, is contemplated by the present invention.<br>
A composition according to the present invention comprises particles comprising one or<br>
more enzymes embedded in a first polymeric material, wherein the embedded enzymes retain at<br>
least two times the activity of the one or more non-embedded enzymes from the same batch,<br>
after incubation of both the embedded and the non-embedded (free) enzymes in simulated<br>
gastric fluid (84 mM HCl and 3.2 mg/ml pepsin at pH ranging from 1.0 to 4.0) at 37°C for at<br>
least 60 minutes. The particles may further be coated with a second polymeric material. As<br>
used herein, the term "enzymes from the same batch" means enzymes that are isolated or<br>
synthesized under identical conditions, and generally are isolated or synthesized in the same<br>
isolation or synthesis procedure where the resulting enzyme composition is generally referred to<br>
as a batch. For example, a solution of enzymes is divided into two portions in which one<br>
portion of enzymes is embedded in a particle and may undergo further treatment, and the other<br>
portion of enzymes is treated differently, and these enzymes are considered to be from the same<br>
batch.<br>
Normally, two different routes of treatment of oxalate-related disease can be employed,<br>
dependent on whether the aim of the treatment is systemic or non-systemic. Methods of the<br>
present invention provide a composition for non-systemic treatment, i.e. to provide a<br>
composition that enables reducing oxalate in the stomach in order to avoid absorption of oxalate<br>
from the gastrointestinal tract. To the best of the inventors' knowledge such a composition is<br>
novel and is based on a novel principle of, on the one hand protecting the enzyme from the<br>
acidic and enzyme-damaging environment in the stomach, and on the other hand, maintaining<br>
the enzymatic activity even in an acidic environment. This goal may be accomplished by<br>
embedding the one or more oxalate degrading enzyme in a first polymeric material, optionally<br><br>
coating the obtained particles with a second polymeric material, optionally cross-linking the<br>
second polymeric material and optionally reducing the cross-linked coated particles.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a reduction in oxalate absorption is achieved by<br>
providing oxalate-degrading enzymes to the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the stomach.<br>
Compositions of the present invention comprise oxalate reducing enzymes including, but not<br>
limited to, oxalate oxidase, oxalate decarboxylase, oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, or formyl-CoA<br>
transferase, or combinations thereof. These enzymes use oxalate as a'substrate. Methods of the<br>
present invention comprise providing enzymatic compositions for degradation of dietary oxalate<br>
in the stomach, thus lowering the concentration of available oxalate in the stomach for<br>
absorption. This will also reduce the amount of oxalate going into the intestine for absorption in<br>
this segment of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition to absorptive pathways, oxalate secretory<br>
pathways have been recently identified in the human stomach, The compositions of the present<br>
invention would also be useful in degrading the oxalate secreted into the stomach from the<br>
circulatory system, and thus the methods of the present invention contemplate an overall<br>
reduction of the oxalate load in an individual.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides compositions and methods for<br>
the delivery of an effective amount of an oxalate reducing enzyme to the stomach of a human or<br>
animal, particularly to those who are at increased risk for oxalate-related disease. Enzyme<br>
activity is used to degrade oxalate in the stomach and reduce the amount of oxalate present in<br>
the stomach and intestinal tract, thereby reducing the amount of oxalate available for absorption.<br>
Lower levels of oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract can also lead to increased oxalate excretion<br>
from the blood into the intestines through the oxalate secretory pathways.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are suitable for use in oxalate-related<br>
conditions including, but not limited to, hyperoxaluria, absorptive hyperoxaluria, enteric<br>
hyperoxaluria, primary hyperoxaluria, idiopathic calcium oxalate kidney stone disease<br>
(urolithiasis), vulvodynia, oxalosis associated with end-stage renal disease, cardiac conductance<br>
disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and patients who<br>
have undergone gastrointestinal surgery and bariatric surgery (surgery for obesity), and/or who<br>
have undergone antibiotic treatment.<br>
A feature of a composition of the present invention is the ability of the particle to protect<br>
the oxalate-degrading enzymes from degradation by conditions such as those found in the<br>
gastric environment including, but not limited to, degradation by a protease such as pepsin or<br>
degradation due to the acidic environment.<br><br>
The term "oxalate degrading enzyme" as used herein is intended to denote any enzyme<br>
that is capable of reducing oxalate. It may reduce oxalate per se and/or it may function in an<br>
oxalate reduction pathway. The present invention contemplates the use of any known oxalate<br>
reducing or degrading enzymes, and such terms "oxalate reducing" and "oxalate degrading" are<br>
used interchangeably herein.<br>
Enzymes used in the compositions and methods of the present invention include, but are<br>
not limited to, oxalate oxidase, oxalate decarboxylase (in the present context abbreviated<br>
OxDc), oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, or formyl-CoA transferase, or combinations thereof.<br>
Moreover, other enzymes, cofactors and co-enzymes that are substituents of oxalate degradation<br>
pathways or involved in oxalate metabolic pathways, particularly oxalate reduction, are also of<br>
relevance alone or in combination with one or more of the above-mentioned enzymes. In the<br>
present context not only the enzymes are encompassed by this definition, but also<br>
polynucleotide sequences that encode oxalate-reducing genes and proteins are contemplated by<br>
the present invention. The present invention also contemplates any binding partners of these<br>
enzymes and includes antibodies and antibody fragments that bind to or interact with the<br>
enzymes.<br>
The enzymes may be derived by isolation from organisms, they may be purified, they<br>
may be made synthetically, semi-synthetically or by recombinant means, or they may be used as<br>
a cell lysate. Normally, the enzymes will be employed as purified recombinant protein, but since<br>
the enzymes can also be made in certain bacteria that are safe, it is also contemplated to use<br>
those bacteria as whole cells or as lysate. Due to the medical use of a composition of the<br>
invention, it is preferred that the one or more enzymes used are well-defined with respect to<br>
purity and activity. The cell lysate, if used, may be made from any microorganism that has<br>
oxalate-reducing functions, e.g. O. formigenes.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also comprise one or more additional<br>
factors which may improve the enzyme activity. These additional factors may be, e.g., oxalyl<br>
CoA, MgCl2, and/or thiamine diphosphate (an active form of vitamin B1).<br>
In specific embodiments, one or more enzymes from the three main classes of oxalate-<br>
degrading enzymes are employed.<br>
The three main classes of oxalate-degrading enzymes include the following. The first,<br>
oxalate oxidase, is expressed in higher plants and catalyzes the oxygen dependent oxidation of<br>
oxalate to CO2 with concomitant formation of H2O2. This reaction forms the basis of current<br>
assays for the detection of urinary oxalate levels. A rapid three-step purification procedure has<br><br>
been developed to obtain oxalate oxidase from barley roots. This enzyme is also present in<br>
beetroot stem and root, amaranthus leaves, sorghum and many other grains.<br>
Oxalate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.2), the second class of oxalate metabolizing enzymes,<br>
is mainly present in various fungi. It has been reported and characterized in several fungi such<br>
as, Myrothecium verrucaria, certain strains of Aspergillus niger, white rot fungus, Coriolus<br>
versicolor and Collybia velutipes. This enzyme converts oxalate to formate and carbon dioxide<br>
in an oxygen dependent reaction. Oxalate decarboxylases also have been used in the clinical<br>
assay of oxalate in blood and urine and can be used to lower oxalate levels in foods and the<br>
environment. The first bacterial oxalate decarboxylase recently has been described as the<br>
product of the YvrK gene which is expressed as a cytosolic protein in Bacillus subtilis. The<br>
YvrK protein (the B. subtilis oxalate decarboxylase) has been expressed as a functional<br>
recombinant protein in E. coli, purified to homogeneity and fully characterized.<br>
The third class is the bacterial enzyme, oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, which is active on<br>
the CoA-activated substrate and converts it into formyl-CoA. A formyl-CoA transferase then<br>
acts to exchange formate and oxalate on CoA. These enzymes have been studied in the oxalate<br>
degrading bacteria, Pseudomonas oxalaticus commonly found in the soil and in Oxalobacter<br>
formigenes, residing in the GI tract of vertebrates and humans.<br>
The enzymes have been fully reviewed in, 'The enzymes of oxalate metabolism:<br>
Unexpected structures and metabolism" Svedruzic D. et al. Arch Biochem Biophys. 2005 Jan<br>
l;433(l):176-92, which is herein incorporated in its entirety. The enzymes, whether native<br>
enzymes, isolated proteins or those made by recombinant techniques, may be modified by<br>
recombinant or chemical means and may contain side groups or other appended molecules. For<br>
example, enzymes may be modified to have linker molecules for attachment to other molecules<br>
or chemical compounds.<br>
In a specific embodiment of the invention, a reduction in oxalate levels is achieved by<br>
use of oxalate-degrading enzymes produced by a recombinant means, such as, e.g., Escherichia<br>
Coli, or other organisms which have been transformed to express oxalate-degrading enzymes.<br>

SEQ ID 8<br><br>
DNA sequences encoding oxalate-degrading enzymes are known to those skilled in the<br>
art and are described in, e.g. WO 98/16632, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.<br>
Additionally, a composition according to the present invention may comprise enzymes<br>
that comprise modifications or mutations, including, but not limited to, chimeras formed using<br>
domains comprising the oxalate degrading active site of an oxalate reducing enzyme, or peptide<br>
fragments, notably those comprising or consisting of the active sites; modifications or<br>
mutations, including, but not limited to, deletions, insertions, replacements, reversions,<br>
mutations for increased activity, substitution of naturally occurring amino acids with non-<br>
natural amino acids, or other modifications known to those skilled in the art. Such modified<br>
enzymes may have more, less or the same activity as native enzymes, or may have<br>
characteristics that are the same or different from native or unmodified enzymes. The present<br>
invention contemplates methods and compositions comprising whole enzymes, fragments,<br>
peptides, binding regions, active sites or other functional regions, segments, sequences and<br>
promoter and control sequences of oxalate reducing enzymes.<br><br>
In one example, an oxalate decarboxylase was modified. In total, 7 genes were created<br>
from the original yvrk gene sequence (the wild-type yvrk). The original gene was from Bacillus<br>
subtilis, the gene sequence was optimized for expression in E. coli using an algorithm from<br>
GenScript Corporation, Piscataway, NJ. The gene was optimized for codon usage, balancing GC<br>
content, removing repetitive elements, and ensuring the absence of internal restriction sites for<br>
cloning. The codon optimized gene resulted in a protein with the identical amino acid sequence<br>
as the wild-type yvrk.<br>
Modifications were then made to the single cysteine codon of both the wild-type yvrk<br>
gene, and the optimized yvrk gene, resulting in 6 additional unique gene sequences. The<br>
cysteine codons were modified to serine, arginine, or alanine codons. The modifications were<br>
performed for the purposes of eliminating disulfide bonding, and modifying the secondary and<br>
tertiary structure of the enzyme.<br>
The gene sequence of the wild-type yvrk gene may be optimized for additional<br>
expression systems such as Pichia or Saccharomyces using the same methods. In addition,<br>
expression in a Bacillus expression system may be improved by optimizing the gene for<br>
optimum codon usage and GC content, and removal of repetitive elements. Codon optimization<br>
may also be used for modification of the secondary structure of the protein at positions other<br>
than the cysteine codon already modified, or in addition to the cysteine modification, for<br>
example, as a method to improve pegylation, microsphere binding or encapsulation, as a method<br>
to improve pH stability at low pHs, or as a method to improve the activity of the protein.<br>
SEQ ID 9<br>
Original.yvrk sequence with the cysteine codon marked in bold.<br><br><br><br>
Yvrk gene sequence optimized for E. coli, with restriction sites at the 5' and 3' ends<br>
(underlined), and the cysteine codon marked in bold.<br>
SEQ ID 10<br><br>
The oxalate-degrading enzyme is normally present in a composition of the invention in<br>
an amount that is sufficient to degrade substantially all oxalate normally present in a standard<br>
meal. Depending on the food choices, an average Western diet can contain 100 to 300 mg of<br>
oxalate/day. In general, about 0.2g of the particles comprising enzyme (equal to 20 mg of OxDc<br>
in 1 mL of suspension of particles) can remove 180 mg oxalate in simulated gastric conditions<br>
within 30 min.<br><br>
An effective amount comprises an amount of activity units of oxalate-reducing enzyme<br>
activity that will reduce a portion of the oxalate present, or a level of activity units of oxalate-<br>
reducing enzyme activity that will initiate a reduction in the amount of oxalate or maintain a<br>
lowered amount of oxalate in the individual, compared to the. amount of oxalate present before<br>
administration of the composition. The number of activity units of oxalate-reducing enzyme<br>
activity that can be used in a single dose composition can range from about 0.0001 units to<br>
about 5,000 units, from about 5 units to 100 units, from 0.05 to 50 units, to 0.5 to 500, from<br>
about 0.01 units to about 50 units, from about 0.01 units to about 5 units, from about 1 units to<br>
about 100 units, from about 25 units to about 50 units, from about 30 units to about 100 units,<br>
from about 40 units to about 120 units, from about 60 units to about 15 from about 50 units to<br>
about 100 units, from about 100 units to about 500 units, from about 100 units to about 300<br>
units, from about 100 units to about 400 units, from about 100 units to about 5,000 units, from<br>
about 1,000 units to about 5,000 units, from about 2,500 units to about 5,000 units, from about<br>
0.001 units to about 2,000 units and all ranges encompassed therein. A unit of the enzyme is the<br>
amount of enzyme that will degrade one micromole of oxalate per minute at 37°C.<br>
A composition of the present invention comprises a particle comprising an oxalate-<br>
degrading enzyme embedded in a first polymeric material. In the non-limiting examples herein<br>
are described methods of how to embed the enzyme in the first polymeric material. A person<br>
skilled in the art may find other methods suitable for use in order to prepare a composition<br>
according to the present invention. By incorporation of the enzyme in the first polymeric<br>
material, the enzyme obtains a certain protection against conditions similar to gastric fluid with<br>
respect to pH and pepsin. The resulting embedded enzyme composition appears as particles, i.e.<br>
discrete units in micron- or nano-size. Accordingly, the terms "particles", "microparticles" and<br>
"nanoparticles" are used herein to describe compositions containing one or more kinds of an<br>
oxalate-reducing enzyme embedded in a first polymer or in a first and a second polymer. In<br>
general the term "particles" are used as the broadest term, i.e. without any specific size or shape<br>
attribution, whereas the term "microparticles" is used when the particles obtained have mean<br>
particle sizes in the range of 1 fan to 1000 μm. Likewise, the term "nanoparticles" is used herein<br>
when the particles obtained have mean particle sizes ranging from 1 nm to 1000 nra. As used<br>
herein the singular of the term "an enzyme" refers to multiple copies of the enzyme molecule, as<br>
is commonly understood in reference to protein molecules. As used herein, the term "one or<br>
more enzymes" means that one type of enzyme may be present,, such as formyl-CoA transferase<br>
is intended, or more than one type of enzyme, such as a composition comprising, for example<br>
oxalyl CoA decarboxylase and formyl CoA transferase; oxalate decarboxylase and oxalate<br><br>
oxidase, or a combination of wild-type enzyme and mutant enzyme, are present in the<br>
composition..<br>
Normally, the particles of a composition of the invention have an average diameter of<br>
from about 50 nm to about 1 mm, such as, e.g., from about 500 nm to about 500 μm, from about<br>
1 μm to about 500 μm, from about 2 μm to about 100 μm, from about 4 μm to about 80 μm,<br>
from about 6 μm to about 60 μm, from about 8 μm to about 40 um, from about 10 μm to about<br>
20 um.<br>
The term "embedded" as used herein is intended to denote that the enzyme is admixed or<br>
contacted with the first polymeric material in such a way that<br>
i) the first polymeric material substantially envelopes the enzyme, i.e. the particle can<br>
be regarded as an enzyme-containing core surrounded by the first polymeric<br>
material; the core may contain other substances than the enzymes such as, e.g., a part<br>
of the polymeric material as well, or<br>
ii) the enzymes is incorporated in the first polymeric material in such a manner that the<br>
major part of the surface of the particles is composed of the first polymeric material,<br>
but a minor part of the enzyme may as well appear on the surface of the particles. In<br>
general, it is contemplated that at least 50% of the outer surface of the particles is<br>
composed of the first polymeric material and at the most about 20% by weight of the<br>
enzyme present in the particles may be present on the outer surface of the particles,<br>
and/or<br>
iii) the enzyme is substantially homogeneously distributed in the first polymeric<br>
material.<br>
Thus, in a composition of the invention the oxalate-degrading enzyme is protected from<br>
the (gastric) environment. Furthermore, the composition of the invention does not substantially<br>
release the enzyme to the (gastric) environment. In other words, the enzyme remains in the<br>
composition after oral administration for a sufficient period of time to enable oxalate in the<br>
stomach to be degraded. In a composition, a first polymeric material may function as a<br>
protective carrier for the enzyme and at the same time may allow the substrate, i.e. oxalate, to<br>
diffuse or otherwise be transported into the composition to enable an in situ degradation of<br>
oxalate. A feature of a composition of the present invention is the composition's ability to retain<br>
the enzymatic activity for a period of time longer than that observed for an enzyme that is not<br>
embedded in a polymeric matrix, especially under acidic conditions. Accordingly, one aspect<br>
the present invention comprises a composition comprising particles comprising one or more<br>
oxalate degrading enzymes embedded in a first polymeric material, wherein the embedded<br><br>
enzyme retains at least two times the activity of the one or more non-embedded free enzymes,<br>
obtained from the same batch, upon incubation in USP simulated gastric juice containing 84<br>
mM HCI and 3.2 mg/ml pepsin at pH&gt;l, e.g. in a range of pH about 1 to pH about 5, such as,<br>
e.g., from pH about 2 to pH about 5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about 4.5, from pH about 2.5 to<br>
pH about 3.5 such as pH about 3 at 37°C for at least 60 minutes. It is important that the test<br>
conditions for the composition according to the invention and the free enzymes are the same, for<br>
example, with respect to the nature and purity of the enzyme, the initial concentration of the<br>
enzyme, the test volume, the composition of the incubation medium (e.g. simulated gastric juice<br>
or fluid), the temperature etc.<br>
Normally, the embedded enzyme retains at least three times the activity., at least four<br>
times the activity, or at least five times the activity of the one or more non-embedded free<br>
enzymes obtained from the same batch upon incubation in USP simulated gastric juice<br>
containing 84 mM HC1 and 3.2 mg/ml pepsin at pH&gt;l, e.g. in a range of pH about 1 to pH about,<br>
5, from pH about 2 to pH about 5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about 4.5, from pH about 2.5 to pH<br>
about 3.5 such as pH about 3, at 37°C for at least 30 minutes, at least 45 min, at least 60<br>
minutes, at least 75 minutes, at least 90 minutes, at least 105 minutes or at least 120 minutes.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the one or more embedded oxalate degrading enzymes in a<br>
composition of the invention retain at least two times, at least 10 times, at least 50 times or at<br>
least 100 times, the activity of the one or more non-embedded free enzyme, obtained from the<br>
same batch, upon incubation in 84 mM HCl and 3.2 mg/ml pepsin at pH&gt;l, e.g. in a range of pH<br>
about 1 to pH about 5, from pH about 2 to pH about 5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about 4.5, from<br>
pH about 2.5 to pH about 3.5 such as pH about 3, at 37°C for at least 60 minutes.<br>
Simulated gastric juice (gastric fluid) referred to above is described in USP (United<br>
States Pharmacopoeia) and contains pepsin and has a specific ratio of concentrated HCl. (USP<br>
simulated gastric juice contains 2g NaCl, 3.2g pepsin and 7 mL concentrated HCl in 1 L<br>
volume. The pH of this solution usually ranged from 1.2 to 1.5, depending on the concentration<br>
of the HCl used. In some examples herein, the pH was adjusted to above 2. This may be the case<br>
when microparticles without any coating were employed. For the present purpose, the pH<br>
should be in the acid range, i.e. at the most about 7, at the most 6 and the pH range should<br>
normally be from about 1 to about 5, from about 2 to about 5. In the experimental section herein<br>
are more details relating to the above-mentioned test and to determination of the enzymatic<br>
activity.<br>
The residence time in the stomach of a human is on average about 120 min. It is<br>
contemplated that the enzymatic activity of the compositions of the present invention is retained<br><br>
at a sufficient level, an effective level, for 120 min or more. From the examples herein it is seen<br>
that it is possible to retain at least 50% of the enzymatic activity for a composition according to<br>
the invention after 120 min of exposure to an acidic environment. If the enzyme that is used is<br>
not embedded in a polymer, e.g., a non-embedded enzyme, the activity decline is very rapid, and<br>
no activity is left after 60 min in acidic environment.<br>
Normally, the activity of one or more oxalate degrading enzymes in a composition<br>
according to the invention at the most decreases to about 30%, at the most decreases to 40%<br>
such as at the most decreases to about 50%, at the most decreases to about 60% or at the most<br>
decreases to about 70%, when incubated in an aqueous buffer solution having a pH in the range<br>
of from about 1.0 to about 5, in a range of from about 1.0 to about 4.5, from about 1.5 to about<br>
4.5, from about 2.0 to about 4.0 or from about 2.2 to about 4.0, for about 60 min. for about 90<br>
min, for about 105 minutes or for about 120 minutes, with the initial activity being set to 100%.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the activity of the oxalate degrading enzyme in a composition<br>
of the present invention at the most decreases to 80%, with the initial activity being set to 100%,<br>
when tested at a pH of from about 2.0 to about 4.0 for a time period of 60 min.<br>
In a further specific embodiment, the activity of one or more oxalate degrading enzymes<br>
in a composition of the present invention at the most decreases to about 20% when incubated in<br>
an aqueous buffer solution having a pH in the range of from about 2 to about 4.5 for 2 hours,<br>
and the initial activity being set to 100%. Notably, the activity at the most decreases to 30%, and<br>
the initial activity being set to 100%.<br>
Suitable buffer substances for providing a buffer solution having a specific pH are<br>
known to persons skilled in the art. Examples are glycine buffers (pH 2-3), acetate buffers,<br>
phosphate buffers, borate buffers and the like. The buffer solution may contain additional<br>
ingredients such as e.g. inorganic salt in order to adjust the ionic strength of the buffer solution,<br>
or one or more proteases like e.g. pepsin in order to ensure that the conditions in the buffer<br>
solutions challenge whether the embedded enzyme can withstand such harsh conditions. In the<br>
event that one or more proteases are included, the concentration thereof is normally at the same<br>
level as that used in USP simulated gastric juice.<br>
As mentioned herein before, the oxalate degrading enzymes can be of various types,<br>
classes, identity and nature. In a preferred aspect, a composition of the present invention<br>
comprises one or more oxalate degrading enzymes including oxalate decarboxylase, oxalate<br>
oxidase, or a combination of oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase and formyl CoA transferase, or<br>
combination thereof.<br><br>
Suitable polymeric materials for use as a first polymeric material in a composition of the<br>
present invention, include, but are not limited to, man-made or natural polymers, including, but<br>
not limited to,<br>
i) a polysaccharide: alginate including alginic acid, alginate e.g. sodium alginate, potassium<br>
alginate, ammonium alginate, calcium alginate, propane-l,2-diol alginate, acacia, carrageenan,<br>
chitosan and its derivatives, chondroitin sulfate, dextran derivatives, heparin, hyaluronic acid,<br>
inulin, a cellulose or a cellulose derivative including methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
ethylmethylcellulose, or the like or combinations thereof;ii) a mucopolysaccharide, iii) a gum<br>
including locust bean gum, guar gum, tragacanth, agar, acacia gum, xanthan gum, karaya gum,<br>
tara gum, gellan gum, or the like or combinations thereof; iv) a gelling- or swelling agent<br>
including hydrocolloids and hydrogelling agents such as, agar, carrageenan, gelatin,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, or the like, or combinations thereof; v) others like e.g. protein and<br>
polyamide: collagen, albumin, protamine, spermine, synthetic polymer: poly (acrylic acid), poly<br>
amino acids (polylysine, etc), polyphosphoric acid, tripolyphosphate, poly (L-lactic acid), poly<br>
(vinyl alcohol), poly (DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid), or mixtures and combinations thereof.<br>
In specific embodiments the first polymeric material is chitosan, alginate, pectin or<br>
hyaluronic acid. In more specific embodiments, the first polymeric material is chitosan or<br>
alginate.<br>
Other polymeric materials may be biopolymers or synthetic polymers. Examples of<br>
biopolymers include, but are not limited to, proteins, polysaccharides, mucopolysaccharides,<br>
heparin, heparin sulfate, heparinoids, dermatan sulfate, pentosan polysulfate, chondroitin<br>
sulfate, cellulose, agarose, chitin, carrageenin, linoleic acid, and allantoin, cross-linked collagen,<br>
fibronectin, laminin, elastin, cross-linked elastin, collagen, gelatin, hyaluronic acid, chitosan<br>
alginate, dextran, methylcellulose, polylysine, and natural rubber. In the compositions of the<br>
present invention wherein polymeric matrices are formed, these matrices are porous such that<br>
small water soluble molecules can enter and exit the polymeric matrix, including, but not<br>
limited to molecules such as oxalate, formic acid, formate, carbon dioxide, oxygen, or oxalyl-<br>
CoA. A concentration of the first polymeric material in a composition of the invention is<br>
normally in a range from 20% to 70% of the total dry materials.<br>
In addition to the one or more enzymes and the first polymeric material, the particles<br>
may also contain one or more additives such as, e.g., pH adjusting agents, buffering agents,<br>
solubilizing agents, stabilizers, preservatives, cofactors for the enzymes or one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as, e.g. fillers, diluents, carriers or the like.<br><br>
Moreover, it may be advantageous to create a localized acidic pH environment around a<br>
protein when the physiological conditions result in a pH well above the reasonable working<br>
range of the enzyme. For example, in a higher pH location, an oxalate degrading protein with<br>
maximum activity at pH three would benefit from a delivery vehicle capable of reducing the<br>
local pH in the proximity around the enzyme to around three.<br>
One method for reducing the local pH is to incorporate a polymer that can undergo<br>
hydrolytic degradation in physiological conditions to produce acidic products that reduce the<br>
localized pH. For example, alpha polyesters such as PLA, PGA and PLGA biodegrade<br>
hydrolytically in vivo to form organic acids (lactic acid and giycolic acid) which can drive down<br>
the pH locally into to a functionally desirable range for the enzyme. Poly(dl-lactide) (DLPLA)<br>
is an amorphous polymer exhibiting a random distribution of both isomeric forms of lactic acid<br>
that can degrade quickly.<br>
In addition, it may be desirable to include a buffer in the delivery vehicle in the form of a<br>
base, base containing or base generating material that works in conjunction with the in vivo pH,<br>
or the localized pH, or a combination of both to optimize/control the local pH around the<br>
enzyme. These buffers may include salts of organic or inorganic compounds or a number of<br>
other buffers. It is understood that the pKa of the conjugate acids of which the buffering<br>
materials are associated/derived from can be utilized in the appropriate selection of buffering<br>
materials.<br>
The particles may be subjected to a cross-linking procedure. Such a cross-linking<br>
procedure may strengthen the properties of the particles such as to avoid loss of enzymatic<br>
activity by negative impact of pH or pepsin from the surroundings during storage or after oral<br>
administration, or to reduce release of the enzyme from the particles or to reduce or prevent<br>
migration of the enzyme towards the surface of the particles. The cross-linking procedures and<br>
suitable material for use in such a procedure are described herein.<br>
The particles of the invention may be constructed of polymers that are cross-linked by<br>
physical or chemical cross-linking. Physical cross-linking may comprise opposite charged<br>
polymers cross-linked with each other by salt bonds (for example: chitosan, which is positively<br>
charged, cross-links with tripolyphosphate or heparin, which are negatively charged polymers),<br>
charged polymers cross-link with opposite charged ions (for example: alginate with Ca2+,<br>
carboxymethyl-cellulose with Al3+). The term "physical cross-linking" used in the present<br>
context also includes non-covalent bindings and/or interactions.<br>
Chemical cross-linking generally comprises cross linking by cross-linkers with two<br>
reactive functional groups such as by polymer bearing amine groups such as proteins,<br><br>
polyamide, chitosan and its derivatives, may be cross-linked through glutaraldehyde or genipin.<br>
UV irradiation can be used to induce polymers bearing light sensitive groups to form covalent<br>
cross-links.<br>
Methods for preparation of nano- and micro-particles are known in the art and include<br>
emulsion, coacervation/precipitation, spray-drying techniques and others. The properties of<br>
nanoparticles or microparticles (for examples: micro-environmental buffer capacity, mechanical<br>
strength, particle size, oxalate diffusion rate, interactions with enzymes) largely depend on<br>
selected polymer(s), polymer composition and ratio, cross-linking method and preparation<br>
procedure. More than one type of cross-linking may be utilized in the microparticles of the<br>
invention (e.g. chemical cross-linking as well as physical cross-linking, see the examples<br>
herein).<br>
In a specific embodiment the first polymeric material is cross-linked to itself and/or to<br>
the one or more enzymes embedded in the first polymeric material.<br>
In a composition of the invention, such as a composition wherein the first polymeric<br>
material is cross-linked to itself and/or the enzymes embedded therein, the level of retained<br>
enzymatic activity upon incubation in 84 mM HCl and 3.2 mg/ml pepsin at pH&gt;l, e.g. in a<br>
range of pH about 1 to pH about 5, from pH about 2 to pH about 5, from pH about 2.5 to pH<br>
about 4.5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about 3.5 for pH about 3, at 37°C for at least 30 minutes, for<br>
at least 60 minutes, for at least for at least 80 minutes, for at least 100 minutes, for at least 120<br>
minutes, for at least 140 minutes, for at least 160 minutes, for at least 180 minutes, for at least<br>
200 minutes, for at least 220 minutes, or at for least 240 minutes is inpreased by a factor of at<br>
least 2, at least 5, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 50 or at least 100 as compared to<br>
compositions of enzymes of the same batch embedded in the polymer but without the polymer<br>
being cross-linked or the enzymes and polymer being cross-linked; or compared to the same<br>
batch of free enzymes.<br>
The particles, optionally the particles wherein at least a part of the first polymeric<br>
material is cross-linked, may also be provided with a coating. Such a coating has generally the<br>
same function as the first polymer, i.e. to avoid a substantial decrease in the enzymatic activity<br>
of the enzyme embedded in the first polymer during storage and/or after oral administration.<br>
Accordingly, in a specific embodiment, the particles aire coated with a second polymeric<br>
material. Suitable coating materials are such materials that allow an aqueous composition<br>
containing oxalate to diffuse into, or otherwise enter, the particle of the invention. As mentioned<br>
above, the substrate (i.e. the oxalate-containing medium) enters into the particle composition of<br>
the invention so that enzymatic degradation of oxalate can occur. Accordingly, coating materials<br><br>
resulting in either diffusion coating or otherwise permeable coatings (e.g. coatings containing<br>
pore-forming substances that are substantially water-soluble) can be applied.<br>
Examples of suitable coating materials include, but are not limited to, the materials<br>
contemplated as first polymeric materials. A coating material may be chosen that is different<br>
than that used as a first polymeric material, but the first polymeric material and the coating<br>
material may also be the same. Specific examples of coating materials are film-forming agents<br>
such as, e.g. polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC),<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, polydextrose, maltodextrin, or other<br>
polysaccharides including chitosan, alginates and hyaluronic acid. In specific embodiments, the<br>
coating material, if present, is one that can be subjected to cross-linking such as, e.g., chitosan<br>
and alginate.<br>
In a specific embodiment the first and/or second potymeric material is a polysaccharide<br>
such as chitosan, alginate, pectin or hyaluronic acid. The first and second polymeric materials<br>
may be the same or different.<br>
Normally, the polymer percentage of the first and, if present, second polymer material is<br>
from about 10% to about 80%, from about 60% to about 80% of the total dry material of a<br>
particle.<br>
If present, the coating material is normally applied in such an amount the weight gain of<br>
the particles is at the most about 40%. As seen from the examples herein, the concentration of<br>
the coating material in a particle composition is normally at the most 25% w/w such as at the<br>
most about 20% w/w, at the most about 15% w/w or at the most about 10%. A particle having a<br>
coating is referred to herein as a coated composition.<br>
In a composition of the invention, such as in a coated composition of the invention, the<br>
level of retained enzymatic activity upon incubation in 84 mM HCl and 3.2 mg/ml pepsin at<br>
pH&gt;l, e.g. in a range of pH about 1 to pH about 5, from pH about 2 to pH about 5, from pH<br>
about 2.5 to pH about 4.5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about 3.5, such as pH about 3, at 37°C for at<br>
least 60 minutes, for at least for at least 80 minutes, for at least 100 minutes, for at least 120<br>
minutes, for at least 140 minutes, for at least 160 minutes, for at least 180 minutes, for at least<br>
200 minutes, for at least 220 minutes, or at for least 240 minutes is increased by a factor of at<br>
least 2, at least 10, at least 50 or at least 100 as compared to compositions of the same batch of<br>
enzymes embedded in particles lacking a coating, or compared to the same batch of free<br>
enzymes.<br>
As mentioned above and as shown in the Examples herein, the stability of the enzymatic<br>
activity of the oxalate-degrading enzyme in a composition of the invention may be further<br><br>
improved by employing coated particles wherein the coating has been subjected to cross-<br>
linking. Cross-linking of a polymeric material is well-known in the art and may be performed by<br>
physical cross-linking or by use of a chemical cross-linking agent.<br>
Suitable chemical cross-linking agents for use in this context include, but are not limited<br>
to, dialdehyde, l-ethyl-3[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide (EDC), disuccinimidyl suberate<br>
(DSS) or (N-[p-maleimidophenyl]isocyanate (PMPI). In a specific embodiment, the cross-<br>
linking agent is a dialdehyde, notably glutaraldehyde or glyoxal. In an embodiment, the cross-<br>
linking agent is glutaraldehyde. The cross-linking is normally carried out in 1-5%<br>
gluteraldehyde in 50mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 at 37°C, shaking for 1-2 hours.<br>
As mentioned above, a feature of a composition of the invention is that the first and, if<br>
present, second polymeric material is permeable for small molecules to allow the substrates for<br>
and products of the reaction catalyzed by the one or more enzymes to diffuse through said<br>
polymeric materials. Moreover, the first and/or second polymeric materials remain substantially<br>
intact upon incubation in 84 mM HCl and 3.2 mg/ml pepsin at pH&gt;1, e.g. in a range of pH about<br>
1 to pH about 5, from pH about 2 to pH about 5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about 4.5, from pH<br>
about 2.5 to pH about 3.5 such as pH about 3, at 37°C for at least 60 minutes, for at least 80<br>
minutes, for at least 100 minutes, for at least 120 minutes, for at least 140 minutes, for at least<br>
160 minutes, for at least 180 minutes, for at least 200 minutes, for at least 220 minutes, or for at<br>
least 240 minutes.<br>
In another embodiment the first and/or second polymeric materials are cross-linked to<br>
themselves and/or each other and/or to the one or more enzymes.<br>
In a composition of the invention, such as in a coated or a coated and cross-linked<br>
coating composition of the invention, the level of retained enzymatic activity upon incubation in<br>
84 mM HCl and 3.2 mg/ml pepsin at pH&gt;l, e.g. in a range of pH about 1 to pH about 5, from<br>
pH about 2 to pH about 5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about 4,5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about<br>
3.5 such as pH about 3, at 37°C for at least 60 minutes, for at least for at least 80 minutes, for at<br>
least 100 minutes, for at least 120 minutes, for at least 140 minutes, for at least 160 minutes, for<br>
at least 180 minutes, for at least 200 minutes, for at least 220 minutes, or at for least 240<br>
minutes, is increased by a factor of at least 2, at least 10, at least 50 or at least 100 as compared<br>
to compositions of enzymes of the same batch embedded in particles but where the particles<br>
lack a second layer of polymeric material (a coating), or a second layer that is cross-linked, or<br>
compared to the same batch of free enzymes. .<br>
As seen from the Examples herein, a composition of the invention wherein the bonds<br>
between the chemical cross-linking agent and the one or more enzlymes and/or the first<br><br>
polymeric material and/or the second polymeric material have been reduced by a reducing<br>
agent, may lead to further improvements with respect to retaining the enzymatic activity of the<br>
composition. Such a reducing agent may be one well-known in the art such as e.g., a reducing<br>
agent such as NaBH4 or NaCNBH3.<br>
In a composition of the invention, notably in a coated, with cross-linked coating, and<br>
reduced cross-links composition of the invention, wherein the first and/or second polymeric<br>
material may be cross-linked, and such a cross-linked material may or may not be reduced, the<br>
level of retained enzymatic activity upon incubation in 84 mM HCl and 3.2 mg/ml pepsin at<br>
pH&gt;l, e.g. in a range of pH about 1 to pH about 5, from pH about 2 to pH about 5, from pH<br>
about 2.5 to pH about 4.5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about 3.5, such as pH about 3, at 37°C for at<br>
least 60 minutes, for at least for at least 80 minutes, for at least 100. minutes, for at least 120<br>
minutes, for at least 140 minutes, for at least 160 minutes, for at least 180 minutes, for at least<br>
200 minutes, for at least 220 minutes, or for at least 240 minutes is increased by a factor of at<br>
least 2, at least 10, at least 50 or at least 100 as compared to compositions of the same batch of<br>
enzymes in a particle that has not been subjected to a reducing agent; or compared to the same<br>
batch of free enzymes.<br>
In a specific embodiment of the invention, the one or more embedded enzymes retain at<br>
least two times, at least 10 times, at least 50 times or at least 100 times, the activity of the one or<br>
more non-embedded free enzymes obtained from the same batch of enzymes upon incubation in<br>
84 mM HCI and 3.2 mg/ml pepsin at pH&gt;l, e.g. in a range of pH about 1 to pH about 5, from<br>
pH about 2 to pH about 5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about 4.5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about<br>
3.5, such as pH about 3, at 37°C for at least 60 minutes, for at least 80 minutes, for at least 100<br>
minutes, for at least 120 minutes, for at least 140 minutes, for at least 160 minutes, for at least<br>
180 minutes, for at least 200 minutes, for at least 220 minutes, or for at least 240 minutes.<br>
In another specific embodiment of the invention, the one or more embedded enzymes<br>
retain at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95% of the<br>
initial activity of the embedded enzymes upon incubation in 84 mM HCl and 3.2 mg/ml pepsin<br>
at pH&gt;l, e.g. in a range of pH about 1 to pH about 5, from pH about 2 to pH about 5, from pH<br>
about 2.5 to pH about 4.5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about 3.5, such as pH about 3, at 37°C for at<br>
least 60 minutes, for at least 80 minutes, for at least 100 minutes, for at least 120 minutes, for at<br>
least 140 minutes, for at least 160 minutes, for at least 180 minutes, for at least 200 minutes, for<br>
at least 220 minutes, or for at least 240 minutes.<br><br>
In a further specific embodiment of the invention, the one or more enzymes retain from<br>
about 95% to about 100% of the initial activity of the embedded enzymes upon incubation in 84<br>
mM HCl and 3.2 mg/ml pepsin at pH&gt;l, e.g. in a range of pH about 1 to pH about 5, from pH<br>
about 2 to pH about 5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about 4.5, from pH about 2.5 to pH about 3.5,<br>
such as pH about 3, at 37°C for at least 60 minutes, for at least 80 minutes, for at least 100<br>
minutes, for at least 120 minutes, for at least 140 minutes, for at least 160 minutes, for at least<br>
180 minutes, for at least 200 minutes, for at least 220 minutes, or for at least 240 minutes.<br>
The enzyme embedded in a particle of the invention is capable of reducing oxalate<br>
content of food. As demonstrated in the Examples herein, a composition of the invention<br>
comprising 20 mg of one or more oxalate-degrading enzymes degrades at least 40%, such as,<br>
e.g., at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 95% or at least 99% of the<br>
oxalate present in 200 g spinach within 1 hour at pH=2.5.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Methods<br>
Assay for enzymatic activity<br>
Samples are appropriately diluted with Tris buffer (typically 5 or 10 times) to 0.5 - 1<br>
mg/ml, of which 10 uL are aliquoted into 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes. To each tube, 390μL warm<br>
substrate buffer (usually 20 mM oxalate in 20 mM citrate buffer, pH 4) is added and<br>
immediately placed on a thermomixer for exactly 10 minutes, at which time 100μL 0.5M H2SO4<br>
is added. Total formate produced is measured directly by HPLC. Using an ion exchange column<br>
(Aminex HPX-87H, BioRad) and an isocratic gradient of 20mM H2SO4, formate is detected by<br>
UV at 210nm with peaks typically eluting at 14.3 minutes.<br>
Stability test<br>
Incubation in buffer at a pH of from about 2 to about 3<br>
After incubation of OxDc free enzyme or the composition in question containing the<br>
OxDc enzyme embedded in a polymeric material in 100 mM glycine buffer at a pH range from<br>
2 to 3 for a certain period, the remaining OxDc activity was analyzed.<br>
Incubation in simulated gastric fluid<br>
A particle composition containing from about 2 mg OxDc to about 20 mg OxDc was<br>
placed in a vessel containing 100 mL of simulated gastric fluid prepared according to USP, i.e.<br>
by dissolving 2 g NaCl, 3.2 g pepsin, and 7 mL concentrated HCl in a final volume of 1L. At<br>
suitable time intervals, a sample was drawn and assayed for OxDc activity as described above.<br>
Incubation in buffer<br>
The same procedure as described above (for simulated gastric fluid). However, various<br>
buffer solutions were employed dependent on the pH value of interest. Suitable buffers include<br>
glycine buffers (pH 2-3), acetate buffers (pH 3-6), phosphate buffers (pH 5-8), borate buffers<br>
(pH 8-9) and the like. A protease may be added such as, e.g., pepsin in a concentration normally<br>
corresponding to the concentration found in the USP simulated gastric fluid.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
PREPARATION OF OXDC ALGINATE MICROPARTICLES AND INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS PROCESS<br>
PARAMETERS ON THE STABILITY<br>
This example illustrates the preparation and stability of OxDc alginate microparticles and,<br>
furthermore, illustrates the influence of various process parameters on the stability of OxDc<br>
embedded in the microparticles.<br>
Preparation of OxDc alginate microparticles<br>
Microparticles I - Emulsification 1:<br><br>
11 ml of the mixture of alginate (1.8%, w/v) and OxDc (10:1, v/v; OxDc, 20 mg/ml, in<br>
10 mM TrisHCl, pH 3.9) in 50 mM citrate buffer, pH 3.9, were mixed with 20 ml mineral oil<br>
containing 0.5% triton x-100 by magnetic stirring at 600 rpm for 10 min to reach stable<br>
emulsion state, then 4 ml CaCl2 mineral oil emulsion (2 ml 0.2 M CaCl2 + 2 ml mineral oil) was<br>
added and continued to stir for 30 min. 8 ml chitosan mineral oil emulsion (4 ml 0.8% chitosan<br>
and 4 ml mineral oil) was then added and stirred for another 30 min. Microparticles were<br>
collected by centrifugation. In the following these microparticles are denoted Microparticles I.<br>
Microparticles II - Emulsification 2:<br>
All the same as "Emulsification 1" except that the mixture of alginate and OxDc was in<br>
10 mM TrisHCl buffer, pH 8. In the following these microparticles are denoted Microparticles<br>
II.<br>
Chitosan coated OxDc alginate microparticles - alginate gelation at different concentrations<br>
(emulsification) and further coating of the microparticles with chitosan:<br>
8 ml of alginate (1.2% or 3%; w/v) was mixed with 0.5 ml OxDc (16 mg/ml) in 50 mM TrisHCl<br>
buffer, pH 9, then mixed with 15 ml mineral oil containing 0.8% triton x-100 by magnetic<br>
stirring at 600 rpm for 10 min to reach stable emulsion state, then 8 ml CaCl2 mineral oil<br>
emulsion (4 ml 1 M CaCl2 + 4 ml mineral oil) was added and continued to stir for 30 min, then<br>
added 50 ml 1 M CaCl2 under stirring. Microparticles were collected by centrifugation and<br>
washed with water twice. All microparticles (about 4 ml) were merged in the mixture of 36 ml<br>
0.4% chitosan, pH 5.45 and 4 ml of 4 M CaCl2 and shaken at 200 rpm for 1 h. In the following<br>
these microparticles are denoted as Chitosan coated OxDc alginate microparticles.<br>
All microparticles obtained in this example had a particle size distribution estimated to<br>
be in a range of about 1-100 urn.<br>
The microparticles obtained were assayed for enzymatic activity as described above.<br>
The total enzyme activity is the enzyme activity of the enzymes prior to embedding the enzymes<br>
in the polymeric matrix, and this amount is set to 100%. The following results were obtained:<br>
About 40% and 48% of the total enzyme activity was found in the microparticles<br>
prepared at pH 3.9 (Microparticles I) and at pH 8 (Microparticles II), respectively. The stability<br>
of the two kinds of microparticles was tested at pH 3 with 3.2 mg/ml of pepsin. About 42%<br>
and 60% of the total enzyme activity was found in the chitosan coated OxDc alginate<br>
microparticles prepared by 1.2% and 3% of alginate, respectively. The stability of the two kinds<br>
of chitosan coated OxDc alginate microparticles was tested at pH 3 with 3.2 mg/ml of pepsin<br>
(Fig. 2).<br><br>
Fig. 1 is a graph of the stability of OxDc in the microparticles I (prepared at pH 3.9) and<br>
in the microparticles II (prepared at pH 8) under pH 3 with pepsin. Squares are microparticles I,<br>
triangles are microparticles II. Fig. 2 is a graph showing the effects of alginate concentration for<br>
forming alginate microparticles on the stability of OxDc in the chitosan coated OxDc alginate<br>
microparticles at pH 3 with pepsin. Squares are microparticles formed with 3% alginate, solid<br>
circles are microparticles formed with 1.2% alginate.<br>
Accordingly, the pH present during the preparation of the microparticles seems to<br>
influence the stability of OxDc during incubation, i.e. an increase in pH favors better stability<br>
and an increase in alginate concentration also seems to have a positive impact on the stability.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of OxDc nanoparticles and coating thereof<br>
This example illustrates the preparation of OxDc-containing nanoparticles and various coatings<br>
thereof.<br>
OxDc chitosan/tripolyphosphate nanoparticles:<br>
40 ml 0.15% (w/v) of tripolyphosphate (TPP) containing 0.5 mg/ml OxDC, pH 8.1<br>
(adjusted by HCl before adding OxDC) was dropped into 120 ml 0.18% (w/v) chitosan in<br>
0.13% (w/v) acetic acid, pH 3.92. Nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation and washed<br>
with water twice. This process produced about 4 ml of nanoparticles suspension.<br>
OxDc chitosan/TPP nanoparticles coated with alginate:<br>
0.8 ml of the nanoparticle suspension.was diluted in 10 ml water under stirring, and then<br>
5 ml of 1.2% alginate solution (in 25 mM TrisHCl buffer, pH 8.6) was added by dropping. The<br>
mixture was kept under stirring for 5 min. The size of the coated nanoparticles increased to 2-<br>
400 μm, with the majority around 30 μm (see Fig.3), because of aggregation of nanoparticles<br>
and crosslinking by alginate. The microparticles were collected by centrifugation at 3000g for 3<br>
min. The microparticles were washed with water twice and resuspended. In Fig. 3 the volume<br>
statistics (Arithmetic) 17795s3_07_01.$ls. Calculations from 0.040 μm to 2000 μm. Volume:<br>
100%; Mean: 48.53 μm; Median: 29.10 μm, Mean/Median ratio: 1.668; Mode: 28.70 μm; S.D.:<br>
65.43 μm, C.V. 135%; Skewness: 4.384 Right skewed; Kurtosis 26.90 Leptokurtic; d10 8.814<br>
μm; d50 29.10 μm; d90 109.9 μm.<br>
OxDc chitosan/TPP nanoparticles coated with carrageenen:<br>
0.8 ml of the nanoparticle suspension was diluted in 10 ml water under stirring, then 5<br>
ml of 0.5% carrageenen solution (natural pH 8.9) was added by dropping. The mixture was kept<br>
under stirring for 5 min. The coated nanoparticles should form microparticles and have a similar<br><br>
distribution as those coated with alginate (see above). The microparticles were collected by<br>
centrifugation and washed twice with water, and resuspended.<br>
OxDc chitosan/TPP microparticles coated with either alginate or carrageenen were cross-<br>
linked with glutaraldehyde at different concentrations of glutaraldehyde:<br>
0.2 ml of the microparticle suspension was diluted in 0.8 ml water under stirring, and<br>
then 2 ml of 0.15-7.5% glutaraldehyde solution (in 50 mM KPB, pH 7.5) was added and mixed.<br>
The mixture was kept under stirring for 15-40 min and the microparticles were collected by<br>
centrifugation and washed twice with water.<br>
Reduction of glutaraldehyde cross-linked alginate coated OxDc chitosan/TPP microparticles<br>
Two different kinds of glutaraldehyde cross-linked alginate coated OxDc chitosan/TPP<br>
microparticles were prepared: one was cross-linked without addition of CaCl2 and the other with<br>
addition of 1.2 M CaCl2 10 min after cross-linking .reaction (1% of glutaraldehyde) started.<br>
After the cross-linking reaction ran for 1h, microparticles were collected by centrifugation and<br>
washed with water twice. The two kinds of microparticles were further suspended in 100 mM<br>
of KPB, pH 7.5. A certain amount of NaBEU powder was added to the suspension solutions to<br>
make final concentration of 20 mM NaBHU and kept in the dark and shaking for 14 h.<br>
The following results were obtained:<br>
OxDc chitosan/TPP nanoparticles:<br>
Nanoparticles were too small to be visually observed under the optical microscope.<br>
OxDc was almost 100% trapped by the nanoparticles under the current conditions. Under these<br>
conditions, OxDC was dissolved with TPP at high pH (8.6) and then dropped into a low pH<br>
(3.92) chitosan solution. The great preference of the enzyme dissolved in high pH over low pH .<br>
is a factor in maintaining the enzyme inside the nanoparticles at the nanoparticle formation<br>
period. The stability of OxDc at pH 3.0 in the OxDc chitosan/TPP nanoparticles was between<br>
that of microparticle I and microparticle II from Example 1 and Fig. 1.<br>
Alginate coated OxDC chitosan/TPP microparticles:<br>
The stability of OxDc at pH 3.0 was further improved when an alginate coating was<br>
applied, compared to uncoated nanoparticles See Fig. 4, where squares are nanoparticles with no<br>
coating, closed circles are microparticles with alginate coating, and triangles are microparticles<br>
with carrageenen coating.<br>
Carrageenen coated OxDc chitosan/TPP microparticles:<br>
The stability of OxDC at pH 3.0 was further improved when a carrageenen coating was<br>
applied (compared to uncoated nanoparticles) Fig. 4<br><br>
Alginate coated OxDc chitosan/TPP microparticles wherein the whole particle is cross-linked<br>
with glutaraldehyde at different concentrations of glutaraldehyde:<br>
(Though not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the glutaralaldehyde cross-<br>
linking occurs mostly within the chitosan molecule, linking chitosan molecules to itself and<br>
each other, and among chitosan molecules and enzyme molecules.)<br>
Alginate coated microparticles plus cross-linking showed higher stability at low pH than<br>
the nanoparticles without alginate coating. High level of cross-linking improved the OxDc<br>
stability inside the alginate coated microparticles at low pH (Fig. 5). The most stable<br>
microparticles can be submerged in a solution at pH 2.6 with pepsin for 4 h without losing<br>
activity. The activity was about 30% after 3.5 h incubation at pH 2.4 with pepsin. See Fig. 5<br>
which shows the effects of glutaraldehyde concentration for cross-linking on the stability of<br>
OxDc in the glutaraldehyde cross-linked alginate coated OxDc chitosan/TPP microparticles at<br>
pH 2.4 with pepsin. The squares are 1% glutaraldehyde with no alginate coating, solid circles<br>
are 0.5% glutaraldehyde, triangles pointing up are 1% glutaraldehyde.and triangles pointing<br>
down are 2% glutaraldehyde, and diamonds are 5% glutaraldehyde.<br>
Reduction of glutaraldehyde cross-linked alginate coated OxDc chitosan/TPP microparticles:<br>
The stability of the glutaraldehyde cross-linked alginate coated OxDc chitosan/TPP<br>
microparticles under low pH after the reduction of Schiff's double bounds was significantly<br>
improved. The glutaraldehyde cross-linked alginate coated OxDc chitosan/TPP microparticles<br>
with CaCl2 addition during cross-linking lost 80% of OxDc activity after 120 minutes whereas<br>
the microparticles without CaCl2 addition under pH around 2.0 lost 80% activity in a very short<br>
time. For details, see Fig. 6 which is a graph that shows the stability of OxDc in two kinds of<br>
cross-linked and reduced microparticles under pH 2.2 and 1.85, where the squares are pH 2.2,<br>
with no Ca+2, solid circles are pH 2.2 with the addition of Ca+2, triangles pointing up are pH<br>
1.85 with no Ca+2, and triangles pointing down are pH. 1.85 with Ca+2.<br>
From the above series of experiments, the formulation of reduced glutaraldehyde cross-<br>
linked alginate coated OxDc chitosan/TPP microparticles was selected for further development.<br>
EXAMPLE3<br>
EXPERIMENTS FOR IN VITRO TESTING OF REMOVING OXALATE FROM FOOD UNDER SIMULATED<br>
STOMACH CONDITION<br>
In vitro testing of reduced glutaraldehyde cross-linked alginate coated OxDc<br>
chitosan/TPP microparticles<br><br>
10, 20 and 40 g of spinach was mixed with 12 ml of simulated stomach juice (gastric<br>
fluid) (84 mM HCl with 3.2 mg/ml pepsin), respectively. Then water was added to make the<br>
final volumes of 40, 80 and 160 ml, respectively. After homogenizing the spinach, simulated<br>
gastric fluid and water,, reduced glutaraldehyde cross-linked alginate coated OxDc<br>
chitosan/TPP microparticles were added to degrade the oxalate released from the spinach. The<br>
(dosage) ratio of spinach/microparticle is 200 (200 g of spinach mixed with 1 g of<br>
microparticles) for all three conditions. Spinach was selected for this experiment, because it<br>
contains high amount of oxalate (about 200 mM of oxalate in the frozen spinach leaf).<br>
Results and discussion:<br>
The amount of soluble oxalate is significantly influenced by pH. The pH values were<br>
2.5, 3.5 and 4.2, for 10, 20 and 40 g of spinach conditions, respectively. The initial soluble<br>
oxalate concentrations were 30.0, 22.8 and 14.7 mM, for 10, 20 and 40 g of spinach conditions,<br>
respectively (Figure 7). If all oxalate is soluble, its concentration should be around 48 mM.<br>
Thus, there was insoluble oxalate present under all three conditions. Figure 7 indicates that the<br>
initial soluble oxalate was almost completely removed in a few minutes. The remaining soluble<br>
oxalate did not drop to 0, but remained at low level for a period, because insoluble oxalate<br>
started to dissolve when more soluble oxalate was removed. Figure 7 shows the bioavailability<br>
of oxalate (soluble portion) was quickly reduced under all three conditions. The squares are 10<br>
g of spinach with 0.05 g of washed microparticles, diamonds are 20 g of spinach with 0.1 g of<br>
washed microparticles, triangles pointing up are 40 g of spinach with 0.2 g of microparticles.<br>
The OxDc microparticles kept removing more and more soluble oxalate (Fig. 8). After 1<br>
h, almost all oxalate in spinach in the first condition (squares) and about 90% in the second<br>
condition (diamonds) was removed. For the third condition (triangles), only 50% oxalate was<br>
removed, but the soluble part was close to 0. Therefore, under all the three conditions,<br>
absorption of oxalate can also be effectively limited in GI tract, because the soluble oxalate<br>
concentration was very low and large part of oxalate was reduced. Figure 8 is a graph of a<br>
timecourse of total soluble oxalate in spinach removed by microparticles in three different<br>
simulated conditions. The total oxalate concentrations in each of the spinach samples was about<br>
50 mM. The squares are 10 g of spinach with 0.05 g of microparticles, diamonds are 20 g of<br>
spinach with 0.1 g of microparticles, triangles pointing up are 40 g of spinach with 0.2 g of<br>
microparticles.<br>
If using these results to simulate treatment in vivo, assume that a person whose stomach<br>
contains 120 ml of gastric fluid is to begin ingesting a total of 400g of spinach. After ingestion<br>
of 100 g spinach, 4 g of microparticles are taken. Almost all soluble oxalate will be removed<br><br>
within 2 min. Although ingestion of the spinach continues until 400 g is eaten, soluble oxalate is<br>
maintained below 3 mM during eating and quickly reduces to 0 after eating.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
FORMULATED OXDC ACCORDING TO THE INVENTION<br>
I. PREPARATION OF FORMULATED OXDC (MICROPARTICLES) AND TESTING ITS STABILITY AT LOW<br>
PH<br>
Reduced glutaraldehyde cross-linked alginate coated OxDc chitosan/TPP micropaiticles are<br>
produced as follows:<br>
1.	OxDc chitosan/TPP nanoparticles formed by dropping tripolyphosphate (TPP)<br>
solution into a mixture of chitosan and OxDc.<br>
2.	Coating the above nanoparticles with alginate by addition of alginate solution to<br>
above suspension. The nanoparticles formed microparticles because of the<br>
aggregation of nanoparticles and physical crosslinking by alginate occurred during<br>
this process.<br>
3.	Cross-linking of above microparticles by glutaraldehyde<br>
4.	Reduction of Schiff's base by NaBH4<br>
The preparation was made in accordance with the description in Example 2.<br>
Testing the stability of free or formulated OxDc at low pH:<br>
After incubation of OxDc as free enzyme or in this microparticle in 100 mM glycine<br>
buffer at a pH range from 2 to 3 for a certain period, the remained OxDc activity was analyzed.<br>
Fig. 9 is a graph showing the cross-linking with glutraldehyde (0.5-5%) improved the stability<br>
of OxDc in alginate coated chitosan/TPP microparticles at pH 2.4 and in the presence of pepsin.<br>
The squares are 0% glutaraldehyde, solid circles are 0.5% glutaraldehyde, triangles pointing up<br>
are 1% glutaraldehyde and diamonds are 5% glutaraldehyde.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, the activity of the alginate coated OxDc chitosan /TPP<br>
microparticles without cross-linking (control) represented by the square points is completely<br>
destroyed in less than 15 minutes at pH of 2.4. In contrast cross-linking with 0.5-5% of<br>
glutraldehyde stabilizes the enzyme activity of the alginate coated OxDc chitosan/TPP<br>
microparticles for up to 2 hours. Native (unformulated, free, non-embedded) OxDc is known to<br>
be irreversibly inactivated at pH
coated OxDc chitosan /TPP microparticles was further improved after reduction of the Schiff's<br>
base in these microparticles (Fig-10).<br><br>
Fig. 10 is a graph showing th reduction by Schiff s base improved the stability of OxDc in the<br>
glutaraldehyde cross-linked alginate coated OxDc chitosan/TTP microparticles at pH 2.2 and in<br>
the presence of pepsin (square points). The microparticles are inactivated rapidly at pH
(triangle points').<br>
Reduced glutaraldehyde cross-linked alginate coated OxDc chitosan/TTP microparticles<br>
retain stability at pH as low as 2.2. This is a significant improvement since the unformulated<br>
enzyme (free, non-embedded) is irreversibly inactivated at pH
II. Studies on the degradation of oxalate by OxDc microparticles<br>
A. Degradation of oxalate (as sodium oxalate) in low concentration range:<br>
OxDc microparticles (prepared as described under I, Example 4 above) containing 2 or<br>
20 mg of OxDc were mixed with 100 ml oxalate solution with concentration from 0.05 to 2 mM<br>
at pH 3 at 37 °C. The generated formate was measured during; a period of time.<br>
As shown in Fig 11 A and B, the reduced glutaraldehyde cross-linked alginate coated<br>
OxDc chitosan/TTP microparticles can degrade oxalate at least in the concentrations ranging<br>
from 0.05 mM to 2.0 mM.<br>
0.05 mM to 2 mM oxalate concentration in the human stomach corresponds to a dietary<br>
intake of 5 mg to 180 mg of oxalate and an assumed stomach volume of 1L. The average daily<br>
intake of oxalate in the Western diet is reported to be 100-500 mg/day in all the meals. The<br>
intake can be much higher if some high oxalate foods like spinach are eaten. Degradation of<br>
oxalate in the range of 15 to 30 mM from spinach has also been investigated and is described<br>
below.<br>
Fig. 11 A and B are graphs showing oxalate removed by reduced glutaraldehyde cross-<br>
linked alginate coated OxDc chitosan/TPP microparticles at pH 3. A, microparticles<br>
corresponding to 20 mg OxDc in 100 ml oxalate solution; B, microparticles corresponding to 2<br>
mg OxDc in 100 ml oxalate solution. The squares are 0.05 mM oxalate concentration, solid<br>
circles are 0.2 mM oxalate concentration, triangles pointing up are 1.0 mM oxalate<br>
concentration, and triangles pointing down are 2.0 mM oxalate concentration.<br>
20 mg of OxDc (estimated amount of enzyme protein in 1.0 ml of the microparticle<br>
formulation) almost completely degraded 0.05 mM to 2 mM oxalate in 2 minutes.<br>
Degradation of spinach oxalate in simulated gastric conditions:<br>
Mixing spinach with simulated gastric fluid: 10, 20 and 40 g of spinach was mixed with<br>
12 ml of simulated stomach juice (84 mM HCl with 3.2 mg/ml pepsin) then water was added to<br>
make the final volumes of 40, 80 and 160 ml, respectively.<br><br>
removing oxalate oy OxDC: After homogenization or the spinach, gastric fluid and<br>
water suspensions, OxDc microparticles were added to degrade oxalate released from spinach.<br>
The (dosage) ratio of spinach/OxDc is approximately 2000 (2000 g of spinach mixed with<br>
microparticles having the activity of 1 g of OxDc) for all three conditions.<br>
Calculated total oxalate in all of the above preparations was 50 mM (spinach is reported<br>
to contain 18 g of total oxalate /kg). Due to different levels of buffering of the gastric fluid by<br>
the presence of spinach, the final pH of three spinach suspensions was 2.5, 3.5 and 4.2,<br>
respectively. The pH of the medium is known to affect the availability of soluble oxalate and<br>
therefore the concentration of bioavailable oxalate in three preparations tested were 30 mM<br>
(square points), 22 mM (diamond points) and 15 mM (triangle points), respectively. (Fig.l2)<br><br>
Figure 12A is a graph showing the bioavailability of oxalate (soluble part) which was quickly<br>
reduced under all three conditions; 12 B is a graph showing the percentage of total oxalate<br>
removed. The squares are 10 g of spinach with an amount of microparticles equal to 5 mg of<br>
OxDc (by enzymatic activity ); diamonds are 20 g of spinach with an amount of microparticles<br>
equal to 10mg of _ OxDc, triangles pointing up are 40 g of spinach with an amount of<br>
microparticles equal to 20 mg of OxDc.<br>
The microparticles with OxDc were capable of degrading a wide range of oxalate<br>
concentration from 0.05mM to 30mM in simulated gastric conditions in pH ranging from 2.5 to<br>
4.2 (see Fig. 12 A and B) or in a buffer at pH 3 (Fig. 11 A and B). From this set of experiments<br>
it can be estimated that 20 mg of microparticles with OxDc (in 1.0 ml suspension) can degrade<br>
180 mg of oxalate within 30 minutes.<br><br>
