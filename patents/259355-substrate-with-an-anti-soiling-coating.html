2.	Description of related art<br>
It is well known in the field of ophthalmic lenses to apply anti-soiling coatings, especially hydrophobic and/or oleophobic top coats having low surface energy on antireflective (AR) stacks.<br>
The anti-soiling has generally reactive groups such as SiO-alkyl groups, Si-CI, Si-NH2 or Si-NH- groups that can hydrolyze and react with pendant reactive groups at the surface of the AR.<br><br>
When the anti-soiling coating is deposited on inorganic AR layers that have been vapour deposited, there is generally no severe problems of adhesion between the AR and the anti-soiling coating.<br>
When the anti-soiling coating is deposited on another coating, especially those of organic nature, such as an abrasion resistant coating, adhesion problems are encountered.<br>
According to the invention, it was found that it is necessary to use a specific coating composition in order to obtain a good adhesion at the interface between the coating and the anti-soiling coating.<br>

A hybrid of organic silane is added to a UV curable acrylic coating. This hybrid additive is designed to be subsequently reacting with the DSX and form a strong bond through silanol condensation.<br>
A UV curable coating formulation that consisted of:(Table Removed)<br>
Formulation :<br>
1-	5.90 grams of acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane were poured in a<br>
beaker.<br>
2-	5.86 grams of glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane were poured in a<br>
beaker.<br>
3-	3.15 grams of hydrochloric acid solution at 0.1 mole.L"1 were<br>
slowly added to acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane and<br>
glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane while mixing. Then, the hydrolysis<br>
was stopped after 2 hours.<br>
4-	6.00 grams of diethylene glycol diacrylate were added while<br>
mixing. Then this blend was mixed for 30 minutes.<br>
5-	6.00 grams of dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate were added while<br>
mixing. Then this blend was mixed for 30 minutes.<br>
6-	0.05 grams of Ebecryl 1360 were added while mixing. Then this<br>
blend was mixed for 30 minutes.<br>
7-	0.24 grams of Irgacure 500 were added to the previous blend<br>
while mixing. Then the blend was finally mixed for 30 minutes.<br>
Coating was spin coated on a polycarbonate lens 10 seconds at speed 4000 rpm and cured via Lesco system H+ U.V. Bulb during 2 times 35 seconds.<br>
The same coating was spin coated on a CR-39™ lens 10 seconds at speed 4000 rpm and cured via Lesco system H+ U.V. Bulb during 2 times 35 seconds.<br>
Next, the lenses were coated with a fluorinated solution (0.60% Optool DSX™ within Demnum™ solvent) top coating solution by dip coating technique.<br>
Subsequently the treated lenses were cured for 1 minute at 90°C by infra-red heater.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Based on the examples 2 to 4 and comparative example 1, it appears clearly that the contact angle is initially lower in comparative example 1, and moreover that there is a big decrease of the contact angle when the substrates are washed by solvent or treated with a caustic solution for comparative example 1, demonstrating a lower adhesion of the anti-soiling agent.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

having anti-soiling properties is hydrophobic and/or oleophobic.<br>
8-	A substrate according to claim 1, wherein compound II is a<br>
fluoro compound.<br>
9-	A substrate according to claim 3, wherein compound II is a<br>
silane   or   a   silazane   bearing   at   least   one   group   selected   from<br>
fluorocarbons,	polyfluorocarbons,	fluoropolyethers	and<br>
polyfluoropolyethers.<br><br>
10-	A substrate according to claim 1, wherein compound II is a<br>
silane comprising polyfluoro polyether groups.<br>
