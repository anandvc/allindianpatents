				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This  invention relates to a process for  the<br>
preparation of a  neutralizing  agent  for  neutralizing tonic  effects  of toxic organophosphorous  and  organo-<br>
sulfur—chlorine    compounds and        their   formulations 'specially,  but. without implying any  limitation   toxic<br>
organophosphorous compounds containing,  either or all  of the  four  elements Fluorine;,  Oxygen,  Phosphorous and<br>
Sulfur  and  'organo  sulfur chlorine compound:  such  as b.is(2—Chloroethyl ) sulfide and related  structure?©.<br>
Hany  of the organophosphorous compounds are known  as  potential  insecticides,    fungicides    and<br>
chemical warfare  agents.   These compounds  affect  the human body through  inhalation, contact and oral routes-<br>
Some  of  the compounds  like  cyanofenphos,  leptophos, which are earlier used as  effective insecticides,,  have<br>
since  been  banned as these  have been found  to  cause Organophosphorous Induced Delayed Neuropathy <opidn></opidn>
Generally, preventive measure are recommended to  avoid touching or inhalation of the preparations  of<br>
the  organophosphorous  compounds.   For  this  purpose, farmers, etc. who use/handle the imsecticxdal  compounds<br>
are  advised to use hand, glove® or face piece  to  avoid the  toxic  effects  of  these  chemicals.   The   empty<br>
containers  of  these chemicals, are     generally  cleaned<br>
before discarding to avoid  re-use by any person ignorant of the toxic  effects of these chemicals.  The contamination with organophosphorous based chemicals can also  occur due to leakage/spillage while producing, storage or transportation of these chemicals. In  case of contamination with highly toxic organophosphorous compounds such as  O-diisopropylmethylphosphonofluoridate and o-ethyl S-(2-diisopropylamino) ethyl methyl phosphonothiolate etc. the  body of the individual must be protected completely to avoid health hazards.<br>
However, many of the organophosphorous based formulations are generally insoluble in  water.  Therefore, residual toxic effect of organophosphorous based insecticides etc. cannot be completely detoxified by mere washing with water or even washing with soapy water. Any re-use of empty  containers of organophosphorous based insecticides/fungicides etc.  by any ignorant person  can therefore cause him health-hazard.  Similarly, any metal, wooden, fabric or plastic surface which gets contaminated due to contact with these compounds cannot be fully'de-toxified by washing with water or detergents.  Therefore, there  is  a need  for a<br>
chemical formulation which can completely de-toxify any surface/container from the residual toxic effects<br>
of the organophosphorous based insecticides, fungicides or highly toxic organophosphorous compounds.<br>
Alkaline solutions are known in the art  to be<br>
used for neutralising the residual   toxic-effect of the organophosphorous chemicals.<br>
One  of the disadvantages of the  use of strong alkaline solution for neutralising the<br>
residual toxic effects of the organophosphorous chemicals is that alkali has harmful effect on the human skin  and easy washing with water  is  difficult.<br>
Another disadvantage of the use of strong alkaline solution is that it corrodes the metal containers and also affects the wooden surface.<br>
Another neutralising formulation known in the  art is  Miceller solution which is prepared by a process involving of mixing surfactant<br>
and water followed by additon of alkali.<br>
However, on of the  drawbacks of the  miceller solution  is that it has ppor  solubilising property due to  which it is not very effective and is very slow-acting in neutralising  specially  organo-sulfur-chlorine compounds.  Besides, it does not dissolve some of  the organophosphorous compounds.<br>
Another  limitation /of the miceller solution is that it is unsuitable for use at low temperatures, as even at  10 C its ingredients tend to precipitate out.<br>
According to another process known in the art, RM  solutions are prepared and used for<br>
neutralising  residual toxic effects of organophosphorous compounds.<br>
The main  disadvantage of  the above solution is that  RM cleaning agents are to be used as an admixture with oxidizing agent (e.g. bleaching powder) for complete decontamination of the toxic organosulfur chlorine compounds, as the use of single solution does not give  effective detoxiffcation of the contaminated sufface.<br>
According to  Miceller process known in the art, the process provides formulation    comprising of alkali and surfactant.  This formulation has also the drawback  of not much effective as it  does not solubilise all toxic agents and due to which it is slow in neutralising the organophosphorous as well as organo-sulfur-chlorine compounds.<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of  a decontaminating or neutralizing agent for neutralising toxic  organophosphorous as well<br>
as as organo-sulfur chlorine chemicals so as to de-toxify  any contaminated metal, wooden,<br>
fabric or plastic surface to protect against the  residual toxic effects of these chemicals.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process for the preparation of a decontaminating<br>
or neutralizing agent  which is capable of decontamination/neutralisation of extremely toxic organophosphorous based chemicals containing either or all of the four elements namely Fluorine, Oxygen,  Phosphorous and  sulfur.  For this simple reason this formulation is rightly referred to as FOPS decontamination solution.<br>
Still another object  of the present invention<br>
is to propose  a process for the preparation   a decontaminating or neutralizing  agent which<br>
is also effective against highly toxic/delayed neurotoxic organophosphorous compounds like di-isopropyl phosphorofluoridate, ethyl pnitrophenyl phosphorothionate etc.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to  propose a process for the  preparation a decontaminating  or neutralizing agent which provides detoxification of surfaces contaminated with  organo-sulfur-chlorine compounds e.g., Bis {2-chloroethyl)  sulfide and compounds  of similar structures.<br>
A still further  object of the present invention is to propose a process for the preparation of  a decontaminating or neutralizing agent which is a ready to use  solution for detoxification of surfaces contaminated  with toxic organophosphorous  chemicals, i.e. the solution not requiring even preliminary processing like dissolution or dilution.<br>
Yet.  still a further object of the present invention is to propose a process for the preparation of a decontaminating or neutralizing agent which is non-corrosive to metal/wooden surfaces and is safer to handle.<br>
Yet still another object of the present invention<br>
is   to   provide  a  process  for  preparation   of   a decontaminating or neutralizing agent which has a  lower<br>
freezing point thereby enabling the  use of the solution of low-temperatures in colder regions.<br>
Yet  another object of the present  invention is  to  propose  a  process for  the  preparation  of  a<br>
decontaminating or neutralising agent which can also  be used  at. the site of decontamination in bulk  quantities<br>
within  a short notice, thereby obviating the  need  for storage of huge dump of these chemicals,  transportation<br>
and  delivery  of the decontaminating solutions  to  the area   of contamination,,<br>
Ac.cctrd.ing to this invention there is provided<br>
a  process for the preparation of a  decontaminating  or neutralising agent comprising of the steps of :<br>
a)     preparing  a first solution of  oil,  surfactant, alcohol,  monoethalamine, ethenediol, . sequestrine,  and<br>
water in the ratio of 4:4;5;15:1:1:2:1  respectively and mixed with each other, fa)     preparing  a  second solution  of  0,1%  alkaline<br>
solution in water and then c)     mixing  said first and second  solutions  in  the<br>
ratio   of   1:1  to  obtain  the   decontaminating   or neutra1izingagent.<br>
In accordance with the present  invention a first solution is prepared by mixing of  oil, surfactant, alcohol, monoethanolamine, ethenediol, sequestrrne.   and water in the ratio of 4:4:5 :15 :1:1: 2:1  The oil taken may be<br>
cyclic/acyclic hydrocarbon or chlorinated hydrocarbon e.g. tetrachloroethylene.  The alcohol may be represented as CnH2n+1OH(n = 4 to  .6) .  A 0.1% alkaline second<br>
solution  is prepared in water.  The first and second I solutions are then mixed in ratio  of 1:1 with<br>
stirring to obtain the required decontaminating<br>
or  neutralizing agent.<br>
Further in accordance with the present invention<br>
for preparation in bulk amounts of the decontaminating or neutralizing agent/  the first and second<br>
solutions  prepared as described above are charged<br>
in  separate compartments  of" a  mobile decontamination<br>
system, the second,  tsolution  obtained in as<br>
described above is flown  at equal rates and is<br>
alloWed to mix to obtain the desired  composttion.<br>
The first solution may be stored separately<br>
and diluted only at the time of its use. Thus it would solve.<br>
The  proposed formulation in addition to surfactant and alkaline solution (0.020 M) in water known in the art, incorporates additional chemical sonstituents namely alcohol (CnH2n+lOH with  n  = 4 to 6),  monoethanolamine, oil which may be cyclic/acyclic hydrocarbon or  chlorinated hydrocarbon like Tetrachloroethylene antifreezing chemical (e.g. ethylene glycol) and sequestering agent (HICO -Metclaw ) for softening the hard<br>
water. . The additional constituents have synergic effects in the overall composition of  the  proposed<br>
formulation,  Firstly, the proposed composition  of the invention provides a single solution for neutralising all types of organophosphorous and<br>
organosuffur chlorine based chemicals like insecticides fungicides and also the chemicals of warfare status,  Secondly, the additi©nal; \ constituents enhance the solubilising water and softening property of the proposed neutralising formulation thereby improving  greatly the efficacy of the solution in terms of  de-toxification against residual toxic effects of  toxic/highly toxic/delayed neurotoxic organophosphorous based chemicals/formulations.<br>
Thirdly, the additional constituents • in the proposed improved composition result in a compostition with  lower freezing point thereby extending the use of the solutions in the colder<br>
regions as compared to the solutions known in the<br>
o art in which ingredients separate out even at  IOC.<br>
Fourthly, the addition of monoethanolamine to  the proposed  composition results in imparting<br>
the composition an additional and special property of neutralising  the toxic organo-sulfur-chlorine compounds.  The monoethanolamine reacts- with bis (2-chloroethyl) sulfide and forms comparatively lesser toxic products.  This method has potential to find an application for decontamination of bulk quantities of chemicals.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated but not  limited by the  following  examples:-<br>
EXAMPLE;<br>
l.Og Sodium hydroxide is dissolved in  600 ml<br>
of water and is added to a mixture of oil (80ml), surfactant (80g), Butanol (100-120 ml), monoethanolamine<br>
(300ml), Ethananediol (20ml) and Metclaw (20ml). PRECAUTION:  The composite mixture is harmful to eyes hence direct contact must be avoided.  In case of  eyes coming in direct contact, wash thoroughly with water.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
