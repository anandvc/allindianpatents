Ibis invention relates to an automatic locking device for preventing reverse power flow in rotary power transmission.<br>
In. many applications a motor has to move a load and hold the load in. a fixed position either by employing a power brake or by controlling the motor current to prevent gravity or momentum from moving the Load. Solenoid operated brakes, worm gear reducers are solutions; however these mechanisms, consume power and are otherwise not efficient, so much so when a large power is involved this can cause substantial energy, lo%&amp;.<br>
This invention therefore proposes an automatic locking device for preventing reverse power flow in rotary power transmission without incurring energj' loss either when the load is bemg driven by a motor or other prune mover or when the transmission shaft is tacked against YoUtisn.<br>
An automatic locking device for preventing reverse power flow in rotar}' power transmission according to this invention^ comprises a power input shaft connected to a power output shaft; restraining means SOT preventing the output shaft from rotating when no torque is applied to the input shaft; an input member mounted on the input shaft and an output member mounted on the output shaft, said members having coupling means for coupling them together when brought into contact with each other, on a torque being applied to the input shaft-, connecting means connecting the input member to the output member<br><br>
for enabling tne output shatt to be initially driven by the input shaft until the input and output members are coupled together; resilient means disposed between the input and output members, exerting a thrust tending to keep the said members apart, the arrangement being such that a torque applied to the input shaft is imtiaUy transmitted to the output shaft through the input member, the connecting means and the output member, and simultaneously, thereafter, causes the output member to be drawn by the connecting means towards the input member so as to come in contact, and couple therewith, to enable the output shaft to be driven dh-ectiy by the coupled input and output members.<br>
This invention will now he described with reference to he accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example and not by way of limitation one of possible embodiments of the device proposed herein,<br>
Vie. 1 illustrating a general view in elevation of the embodiment<br>
Fi1£. 2 illustrating an exploded view of the embodiment<br>
Fig. 3 illustrating another general view of the embodiment<br>
tig. 4 illustrating a view in perspective of the embodiment from the<br>
output end;<br>
and<br>
I'ig. 5 illustrating a view in perspective of the embodiment from the<br>
input end.<br>
The embodiment has a power input shaft 1 supported hy two ball bearings 2 inside bearing bracket 3 fixed to the frame 4. The input<br><br>
member, which is the input dog 5, is linked to the output member, -which is the output dog 6, by connecting means which are two or more bail ended links 7, whose ends are anchored to the input dog and output dog respectively by split spherical concave sockets 8 bolted to the periphery of (he input dog and output dog. The said links 7 are thus free to swing in ail directions about their anchor points on the dogs. Resilient means, such as, the compressfon spring 9 disposed between the input and output members, exert a thrust tending to keep the said input dog and output dog apart, with the finks 7 in tension.<br>
The input dog 5 is fixed to the input shaft I by a key. The output shaft 1Q vs su\\vwvte*A «n ball beatin&amp;s I inswle the hiring bvacket 11 which is fixed to the frame 4. The said output shaft 10 has splines on it. The output dog 6 is assembled on to the output shaft 10 such that it is free to slide along the output shaft 10 but is constrained to rotate with it since the internal splines of the output dog 6 engage with the external splines of the output shaft 10.<br>
Fig. I illustrates the position when no torques is exerted on the input shaft 1.<br>
One side of the output dog 6 and an adjacent support, such as, the adjacent side of the hearing bracket 11, has jaws 13 which arc engaged together by the force exerted by the compression spring 9. It is not possible to rotate output shaft 10 because it would have to rotate output dog 6 too and that is not possible as the jaws 13 on the output dog 6 and stationary bracket 11 are meshed together. Figs. 3 and 4 show the<br><br>
angular displacements caused by (he links 7 on the input dog 5 pulling the output dog 6 towards the input dog 5, compressing the spring 9 resulting in the disengagement of jaws 13. A thrust bearing 1Z at the seating of the spring 9 on the input dog 5 ensures that the spring does not cause any torque due to winding or unwinding of the spring. Thus torque applied to the input shaft 1 can be transmitted to the input dog 5 and thereafter through the finks 7 to the output dog 6 and output shaft 10.<br>
When the torque transmitted at the input shaft is increased further, (he output dog 6 moves towards Hie input dog 5 to come into direct contact face to face. The coupling means, such as, the projections 14 on the said dogs, engage with each other such that further increments in torque will be transmitted directly between the dogs 5 and 6, limiting the forces on the links 7 and spring 9 as illustrated bv Fig.5 (the spring 9 has not been shown for the sake of clarity).<br>
It will be seen that no torque can be transmitted from the output shaft 10 to the input shaft 1 whereas torque can be transmitted from the input shaft 1 to the putput shaft 10. Furthermore when no torque is applied to the input shaft Ithe output shaft: 10 is effectively locked in position by the ja-ws 13. There is thus no loss of energy either on account of applying or releasing brakes.<br>
For smooth functioning it is necessary to have a resisting torque on the output shaft 10 at all times, to avoid chatter of the jaws by alternate engagement, disengagement and consequent wear.<br><br>
There are applications where, at times, the desired motion is in the direction of tiie load torque as when a crane is lowering a load, or when a vehicle is running down-hill JJI such apphcations another variant of the invention in which a disc brake or cone clutch type of brake to hold the output dog (6) to the fixed bearing bracket (11) by spring pressure is used instead of the jaws. In this case it is the friction between the male and female cones that provide the holding force. This would enable the motor coupled to the input shaft (t) to control the degree of braking. The input torque subtracts from me spring force, which is forcing the cones together and so controlling input torque controls the braking force. The output shaft (10) would of course rotate in synchronism with the input shaft (10) in this variant also and the output would stop when the input ceases.<br>
It will be appreciated that various other embodiments are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of the invention.<br><br><br>
