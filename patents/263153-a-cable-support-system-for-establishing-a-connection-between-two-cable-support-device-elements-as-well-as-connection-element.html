COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (SECTION 10; rule 13)<br>
"ARRANGEMENT FOR ESTABLISHING A CONNECTION BETWEEN TWO CABLE SUPPORT DEVICE ELEMENTS AS WELL AS CONNECTING ELEMENT"<br>
OBO BETTERMANN GMBH &amp; CO. KG<br>
A Company Incorporated under the German<br>
Company Act, having its address at<br>
Huingser Ring 52, 58710 Menden (DE)<br>
The  following   specification   particularly  describes  the   nature  of  this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an arrangement for establishing a connection between two cable support device elements disposed in the region of a connection section such that they overlap, for the formation of a cable support system utilizing at least one connecting element retaining together the two cable support device elements. The invention further relates to a connecting element for establishing in particular a mechanical connection between two cable support device elements disposed in the region of a connection section such that they overlap, for the formation of a cable support system.<br>
Such cable support device elements are cable ducting, cable channels, cable conduits or the like, of which several individual such elements are combined to form a cable support or cable guidance system. Cable support device elements, which are utilized for forming a cable support system by combining several such elements without tools and bolts, is disclosed in DE 198 41 643 Al. These known cable support device elements comprise at both ends a connection section with complementary mechanical connection members. The connection section of these known cable support device elements is formed by a crimping of the lateral cross-pieces, slightly enlarging the interior space, as well as of the bottom unit, while the other connection section is not crimped. As mechanical connecting members serve snap and latch recesses, on the one hand, and snaps and latches as complementary members, on the other hand. This known cable support device element is comprised of sheet metal, such that the snap and latch recesses are punch-outs and the snap and latch [are] outformings, reshaped notchings, clips or the like.<br>
While with said means individual cable support device elements can be connected to one another without tools, the development of the necessary connection members, such as outformings, notchings and the like, however,<br><br><br>
require not inconsiderable technical expenditures. For the intended connection of two cable support device elements, additionally, a certain material elasticity is assumed. However, not every cable support device element has such property to a sufficient degree.<br>
To connect two cable support device elements with one another, bolts are also applied as connection elements. Within such a concept, the cable support device elements, with the exception of the necessary breakthroughs for inserting the bolts, basically do not need to have any further connection members to be brought into engagement with one another, such that such cable support device elements can be produced with lesser expenditures. The connection of two cable support device elements, however, cannot be carried out without employing tools.<br>
Cable support systems serve primarily for supporting cables. A cable support system installed, for example, in a building must in many cases also meet further requirements, which go beyond a pure support function. The individual cable support device elements of a cable support system, in particular if these are comprised of metal, must be permanently connected with one another in an electrically conducting manner, such that between adjoining elements an equipotential bonding can occur. In order for such intended electrical contacting to be ensured in known cable support device elements, two adjoining cable support device elements each are connected with bolts. While this is in principle possible, it has however the disadvantage that thereby the meaning and purpose of bolt-less cable support systems, such as disclosed, for example, in DE 198 41 643 Al, are lost. While in this known prior art two cable support device elements connected with one another of sheet metal also border one another in the region of the overlapping connection sections, due to the necessary tolerances for realizing the snap and latch connections, electric contacting is left to chance.  In this known prior art, therefore, additionally bolts<br><br><br>
are employed, either for additionally bolt-connecting the lateral cross-pieces in the region of the overlapping connection sections or also by employing an additional bottom connector, which is bolt-connected with the two adjoining bottoms.<br>
Such additional bolt connection of two cable support device elements, otherwise to be connected tool- and bolt-free, is necessary especially when the cable support system formed of several cable support device elements is to assume grounding conductor function for diverting shortcircuit currents. In this case it must in any event be ensured that adjoining cable support device elements are connected with one another with the necessary contact area, such that they are electrically conducting for transmitting such shortcircuit current.<br>
Even if with the known cable support device element to be connected tool-free and bolt-free the connection established between two cable support device elements may possibly be sufficient for the requirements of equipotential bonding, these known elements have the disadvantage, that for the establishment of the occasionally necessary electrical connection for the diversion of a shortcircuit of two adjoining cable support device elements, additional mounting steps must be carried out to establish the necessary electrical connection, in particular such steps in which tools are required such as for example for tightening bolts.<br>
Building on this discussed prior art, the invention addresses the problem of providing an arrangement with which the tool-free connection of two cable support device elements is possible without this connecting having a disadvantageous effect on the production process for the production of the individual cable support device elements, and with which a permanent electrical connection, corresponding to the requirements, of two cable support<br><br><br>
device elements is also possible.<br>
This problem is solved according to the invention through an arrangement<br>
described in the introduction, in which<br>
-each cable support device element within its connection section(s) comprises at least one contact face on which, after the cable support device elements are connected, a contact face of the other cable support device element is in contact and each contact face is delimited on two sides by the particular breakthroughs extending through the particular connection section bearing the contact face and/or an edge of the connection section,<br>
-the connection element comprises a press-on section and two latching arms disposed on different sides with respect to the press-on section each with connection limbs extending in a transverse direction with respect to the extent of the press-on section and with a hook element disposed at the free end of the connection limb, which latching arms with their connection limbs are disposed for the extension through or girding of the connection section bearing a contact face and of which latching arms at least one has at least sectionally spring-elastic material properties, and -the connection element mounted for retaining together the two cable support device elements under spring loading is stayed with its press-on section on the surface of the connection section of the one cable support device element and with its hook elements on the opposite surface of the connection section of the other cable support device element.<br>
This problem is further solved through a connection element of the type described in the introduction, in which the connection element comprises a press-on section and two latching arms disposed on different sides with respect to the press-on section with connection limbs each extending in a transverse direction to the extent of the press-on section and with a hook element disposed<br><br><br>
at the free end of the connection limb, which latching arms are disposed with their connection limbs for extending through or girding the connection section bearing a contact face and of which latching arms at least one has at least sectionally spring-elastic material properties.<br>
With this disposition, the cable support device elements to be connected with one another, which can be developed as cable ducting, cable channels, cable conduits or the like, independently of their particular material condition, only need in each instance a connection section overlapping a connection section of the other cable support device element. Both connection sections in principle only need to comprise breakthroughs and/or insections as marginally open breakthroughs in order to form a defined contact face. The contact faces of the two cable support device elements to be connected are in their particular connection sections disposed such that, with the intended disposition of the two cable support device elements to be connected, the contact faces of the two connection sections are disposed aligned with respect to one another, preferably in contact on one another. Such development of the connection section is readily possible in particular independently of the material utilized for the construction of a cable support device element and also independently of its thickness. The mechanical connection proper between the two cable support device elements takes place by utilizing a connection element with which the two adjacently disposed contact faces of the overlapping connection section are fixed with respect to one another and the contact faces are pressed against one another with a defined press-on pressure. For the mechanical fixing of the two cable support device elements with respect to one another, the connection element comprises a press-on section and two latching arms disposed on different sides with respect to the press-on section. The latching arms extend with their connection limb through adjoining connection sections of the two cable support device elements and, so to speak, represent latches wherewith  the two  connection  sections  are  form-fittingly<br><br><br>
connected with one another. The dimensioning of the latching arms of the connection elements as well as of the breakthroughs or insections of the connection sections of the cable support device elements are usefully matched to one another, such that the height of two breakthroughs spaced apart from one another corresponds to the height of the connection limbs of the connection element or is minimally greater than the height of the connection limbs in order for them to be readily guided through the breakthroughs. The connection element is hereby fixed quasi play-free on that connection section with the breakthroughs spaced apart with respect to one another at the level of the connection limb. The inner clearance of the breakthroughs is usefully matched to the distance of the connection limbs of the latching arms in such manner that the mounted connection element is also held free of play in the transverse direction with respect to the height of the connection limbs and resilience is at most given via the material elasticity of the connection limbs.<br>
The latching arms of a connection element bear at their free end a hook element which extends behind the breakthrough of a connection section. While on the one top side of the connection section the press-on section is in contact, on the opposing top side of the breakthrough of the other connection section is stayed the connection element with its hook elements. The concept of the latching arms is provided in such form that the mounted connection element is stayed under a certain spring prestress with its press-on section on the one top side of a connection section. The prestress results therefrom that at least one of the two latching arms, usefully both, comprise spring-elastic material properties. According to a preferred embodiment example the entire connection element is produced of a sheet of spring steel.<br>
With such a connection element two overlappingly disposed connection sections of two cable support device elements can be mechanically connected with one another in a simple manner and free of tools.    According to an<br><br><br>
embodiment example this takes place thereby that both connection sections include breakthroughs aligned with one another for delimiting the particular contact faces and, after establishing the overlapping disposition, the latching arms of the connection element associated with a contact face are guided through the breakhroughs until the hook elements become stayed on the surface of the other connection section opposing the press-on section of the connection element. Due to the defined prestress applied by the latching arms, the contact faces of the overlapping connection sections of the two cable support device elements are subsequently in contact with one another under defined press-on force, which is desired in particular for developing an electrical connection of the two cable support device elements. Through the connection element, consequently, not only a precise mechanical, but in particular also a defined electrical, connection of two cable support device elements with one another takes place. The spacing of the breakthroughs for guiding through the latching arms defines inter alia the size of the contact face with which the two connection sections are under said conditions in contact on one another under definition. Utilizing a connection element, which includes at least two latching arms spaced apart from one another and girding the particular contact face, makes feasible the formation of the connection element in such manner that the two contact faces to be connected with one another can be retained in contact adjoining one another with an areally acting press-on force.<br>
The connection sections of the two cable support device elements to be connected are usefully located in the side walls. Depending on the height of the side walls, each of these includes one or more contact faces. To establish the desired connection, a corresponding number of connection elements is utilized.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, each cable support device includes at its end one complementarily formed connection section.<br><br><br>
The connection elements required for the establishment of a mechanical connection with a further cable support device element are usefully premounted on the one connection section, and specifically on that connection section whose contact faces are formed by two breakthroughs spaced apart from one another. To connect such a connection section with its premounted connection elements, the contact face of the complementary connection section of the other cable support device element is usefully defined by insections as marginally open breakthroughs, such that a connector tongue is developed as a blade terminal element. This can be formed by two insections spaced apart from one another or through an insection and an edge of the connection section. To establish the desired connection, such a connector tongue is slid under the press-on section of the connection element mounted on the other connection section. To facilitate this mounting, it is useful if the connection elements comprise an outwardly projecting runup ramp directed toward the connector tongue to be slid in. This [ramp] is preferably located at the free end of an additional latching extension on each connection element. This additional latching extension bears, according to a preferred embodiment, an inwardly projecting locking latch, which engages in a locking latch recess of the connection section after the two cable support device elements are assembled as intended. Through the locking latch engaging into the locking latch recess both cable support device elements are subsequently also latched in the joining direction. The run-up ramp can be utilized for detaching such a connection by sliding in a tool, for example a screw driver, with which the locking latch can be lifted out of the locking latch recess.<br>
In the following the invention will be described in conjunction with an embodiment example with reference to the enclosed Figures. In the drawing depict:<br><br><br>

Fig. 4   an illustration of the two cable support device elements connected with one another in partial longitudinal section, and<br>
Fig. 5  a schematic side view of two cable ducts connected with one another according to a further embodiment example.<br>
A cable duct 1 as a first cable support device element comprises at its end, which in Figure 1 is to the left, a connection section 2 . Figure 1 shows the cable duct 1 in a side view and, thus, shows the one side wall 3 of the cable duct 1. The connection section 2 forms the end section of the cable duct 1 and serves for connecting the cable duct 1 with a further cable duct 4 as a second cable support device element. In the connection section 2 of the cable duct 1 are introduced two elongated hole-like breakthroughs 5, 5' of vertical extent and spaced apart from one another. The breakthroughs 5, 5' are circumferentially closed and laterally gird a contact face 6, which is formed by the wall segment 6 located between the two breakthroughs 5, 5'. For the formation of a cable support system, the two cable ducts 1, 4 include at each of their two ends identical connection sections. The cable duct 1 therefore includes at its other end, not shown in the Figures, a connection section, which will be explained in the following in conjunction with the connection section 7 of the cable duct 4. The cable duct 4 includes equally at its end, not shown in the Figures, a<br><br><br>
connection section which is structured like the connection section 2 of cable duct 1. The connection section 7 of the cable duct 4 is formed by a crimping increasing the cross sectional area of the cable duct. The connection section 7 is thus formed as a sleeve for receiving the connection section 2 of cable duct 1, such that the two connection sections 2, 7 can be disposed such that they at least regionally overlap. In the connection section 7 is located a connector tongue 8, which is formed, on the one hand, by the front edge 9 of the connection section 7 and, on the other hand, by an insection 10 terminating at the upper edge of connection section 7. The backside of the connector tongue 8 forms the contact face of the connection section 7. The width of the connector tongue 8 corresponds approximately to the width of the spacing of the breakthroughs 5, 5' of the connection section 2 of cable duct 1. The connector tongue 8 is delimited on the underside by a locking latch reception 11. The cable ducts 1, 4 depicted in the embodiment example are produced of a zinc-plated sheet metal.<br>
To connect the two cable ducts 1, 4, connection elements 12 are utilized which, apart from the connection sections 2, 7 of the cable ducts 1, 4, are part of the arrangement for establishing the desired mechanical connection between the two cable ducts 1, 4. The number of utilized connection element is dependent on the number of contact faces which a connection section 2, 7 bears. Such a connection element 12 is depicted in Figure 1 (left) in a top view, a side view and a slightly oblique perspective view. The connection element 12 is produced by reshaping a spring steel sheet metal piece. The connection element 12 includes a press-on section 13, with which the connection element 12 is in contact on the outside of the connector tongue 8 of the cable duct 4. Formed onto the press-on section 13 opposite each side is one latching arm 14, 14' each. The latching arms 14, 14' are structured mirror-symmetrically with respect to one another. In the following the latching arm 14 is described. The same applies to<br><br><br>
the latching arm 14'. The latching arm 14 is structured in the shape of an "S" and comprises a first arc segment 15 extending outwardly from the press-on section 13. Adjoining the arc segment 15 is a connection limb 16, which bears at its free end a hook element 17. The hook element 17 in the depicted embodiment example is also formed as an arc piece such that the latching arm 14 overall has the above described S-shaped formation. As is evident in the top view of the connection element 12 of Figure 1, the free end 18 of hook element 17 is located behind the plane of the backside of the press-on section 13. This virtual plane is denoted in this Figure by the reference number 19. Due to its material elasticity and its concept, the latching arm 14 is spring-elastic in the direction of plane 19 as well as in the direction transversely thereto.<br>
Onto the lower end of the press-on section 13 is formed a latching extension 20. The latching extension 20 bears at its lower end an outwardly projecting run-up ramp 21 as well as an inwardly projecting locking latch 22 spaced apart from the run-up ramp 21 in the direction toward the press-on section 13. As is evident in the side view of the connection element 12, the locking latch 22 is inclined upwardly toward the press-on section 13 such that its underside represents a quasi run-up ramp.<br>
The latching arms 14, 14' of the connection element 12 serve for extending through the breakthroughs 5, 5' such that the free ends 18 of the hook elements 17 are stayed on the backside of the wall 3 of the connection section 2 of the cable duct 1. The insection 10 serves equally for the purpose that a section of the latching arm 14, namely the connection limb 16, is guided through it. The locking latch reception 11 serves for receiving the locking latch 22.<br>
In practice the connection element(s) 12 is(are) going to be premounted on the cable duct 1 before the two cable ducts 1, 4 are connected with one another.<br><br><br>
The partial longitudinal section of Figure 2 shows the connection element 12 premounted on the connection section 2 of the cable duct 1. The connection element 12 is stayed with the free ends 18 of a latching arm 14, 14' on the inside of wall 3 of the connection section 2. On the outside - the contact face 6 - the locking latch 22 is in contact. In an embodiment example not depicted in the Figures, below the contact face 6 of the connection section 2 is located a recess for receiving the locking latch 22 corresponding to the locking latch reception 11 of the cable duct 4. In such an embodiment the connection element 12 premounted on the cable duct is planarly in contact with its press-on section 13 on the contact face.<br>
To connect the two cable ducts 1, 4 the cable duct 1 with its two connection elements 12, premounted on the opposing walls, is set with a vertical joining movement into the connection section 7, formed in the manner of a sleeve, of the cable duct 4 (cf. Figure 3). During this process the connector tongue 8 is moved between the press-on section 13 of connection element 12 and the contact face 6 of connection section 2 of the cable duct 1. This is readily possible due to the lower run-up ramp 21 of the connection element and the upwardly directed, bent-off disposition of the locking latch 22. As a consequence of the material-elastic formation of latching arms 14, 14', locking latch 22 automatically snaps into the locking latch reception 11 of connection section 7 of cable duct 4 after the two cable ducts 1, 4 have been properly assembled. The bent pitching of the locking latch 22 subsequently acts as a counterhook element whereby the disassembly of the two cable ducts 1, 3 is not readily possible.<br>
The two connected cable ducts 1, 4 are depicted in Figure 4. This illustration makes clear that the press-on section 13 of connection element 12, after the locking latch 22 has snapped into the locking latch reception 11, is in contact<br><br><br>
over the entire area on the outside of the connector tongue 8. Due to the prestress provided through the latching arms 14, 14', which is equally transmitted onto the press-on section 13, the backside of the connector tongue 8 - the contact face 23 of the connection section 7 - is pressed onto the contact face 6 of the connection section 2 of the cable duct 1. Consequently both contact faces 6, 23 are under a press-on force predefined through the prestress of the latching arms 14, 14'. The area of the contact faces 6, 23 in contact with one another and the defined press-on force, with which the two contact faces 6, 23 are in contact on one another, permits the formation of a defined electrical connection of the two cable ducts 1, 4, such that this connection meets electrical requirements. The mechanical fixing of the two cable ducts 3, 4 with respect to one another takes place through the dimensioning of the latching arms 14, 14' and the breakthroughs 5, 5', wherein usefully the height of the breakthroughs 5, 5' is dimensioned only minimally greater than the height of the latching arms 14, 14'. The longitudinal extent of the locking latch 22 corresponds substantially to the longitudinal extent of the locking latch reception 11, such that in this manner through the connection element 12 the two cable ducts 1, 4 with their particular connection sections 2, 7 are connected with one another free of play or quasi free of play.<br>
Figure 5 depicts two cable ducts 24, 25 connected with one another which, in principle, are connected in the same manner as has been explained in connection with the previously described embodiment example of Figures 1 to 4. In contrast to the embodiment example of Figures 1 and 4, according to which the two cable ducts 1, 4 are connected through a vertical joining movement, the joining together of the cable ducts 24, 25 is carried out through a horizontal joining movement. For these reasons connection elements 12 premounted on the cable duct 24, are rotated by 90E with respect to the [Fig. 4] disposition on the cable duct 1 and disposed directed with their latching extension 20 toward<br><br><br>
the cable duct 25. Due to the wall height of the cable ducts 24, 25 in the depicted embodiment example two superjacent connection elements 12 are provided. The connection section 26, formed in the manner of a sleeve, of the cable duct 25 has two connector tongues 27, 28, which, in the process of joining the two cable ducts 24, 25, had been slid under the press-on section of the connection elements 12 and are subsequently with their insides in contact on the outside of the connection section of the cable duct 24.<br>
The description of the invention makes clear that, through the described disposition, the two cable support device elements to be connected can be equipped with elements simple of construction, which are required for the connection of the two cable support device elements utilizing the above described connection elements. The connection is possible in simple manner and especially free of tools. The connection element(s) - as described - is(are) usefully already premounted on a connection section of a cable support device element. Nevertheless, mounting the connection elements is also possible in situ during the formation of the cable support system. An identical connection of two cable support device elements in particular takes place independently of their material or also their material thickness. For different material thicknesses, differently dimensioned connection elements can be provided. Due to the planar formation of their press-on section, the connection elements themselves have, moreover, a suitable site for the application of an identification. Faulty mounting is avoided since the two cable support device elements can only be assembled according to a single joining movement.<br>
These explanations describe an embodiment example. Nevertheless, the claimed protection extends also to numerous other implementations which have not been explicitly described in these documents.<br><br><br>
