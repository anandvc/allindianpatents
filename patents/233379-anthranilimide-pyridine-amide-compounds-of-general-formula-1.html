				<td> The present invention relates to anthranilimide pyridine amide compounds of general formula I<br>
The invention relates to selective anthranilamide pyridinamides as VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 inhibitors, their production and use as pharmaceutical agents for treating diseases that'are triggered by persistent angiogenesis.<br>
Persistent angiogenesis can be the cause of various diseases, such as psoriasis; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, endometriosis, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombotic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases and aneriosclerosis or can result in an aggravation of these diseases.<br>
Persistent angiogenesis is induced by the factor VEGF via its receptor. So that VEGF can exert this action, it is necessary that VEGF bind to the receptor, and a tyrosine phosphorylation is induced.<br>
Direct or indirect inhibition of the VEGF receptor (VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor) can be used for treating such diseases and other VEGF-induced pathological angiogenesis and vascular permeable conditions, such as rumor vascularization. For example, it is known that the growth of tumors can be inhibited by soluble receptors and antibodies against VEGF.<br>
Anrhranilic acid amides that are used as pharmaceutical agents for treating psoriasis; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthriris, hemangioma, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; renal diseases, such as<br>
glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, tnrombotic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases and arteriosclerosis or can result in an aggravation of these diseases.<br>
Persistent angiogenesis is induced by the factor VEGF via its receptor. So that VEGF can exen this action, it is necessary that VEGF bind to the receptor, and a tyrosine phosphorylation is induced.<br>
Direct or indirect inhibition of the VEGF receptor (VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor) can be used for treating such diseases and other VEGF-induced pathological angiogenesis and vascular permeable conditions, such as tumor vascularization. For example, it is known that the growth of rumors can be inhibited by soluble receptors and antibodies against VEGF.<br>
Anthranilic acid amides that are used as pharmaceutical agents for treating psoriasis; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; renal diseases, such as<br>
glomerulonephnns, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferateve diseases, arteriosclerosis, injuries to nerve tissue, and for inhibiting the reocclusion of vessels after balloon catheter treatment, in vascular prosthetics or after mechanical devices are used to keep vessels open, such as, e.g., stems, are known from WO 00/27819.<br>
Strong angiogenesis is a prerequisite for the proliferation of the extrauterine endometrium in the case of endomerriosis. Angiogenesis inhibition can therefore also be used for the treatment of this form of disease that causes painful conditions and often results in infertility.<br>
The known compounds are generally effective in the indications cited, but their effectiveness generally accompanies toxicity and an inferior compatibility of the medication.<br>
There is therefore a desire, on the one hand, for more effective compounds, and, on the other hand, for more toxicologically harmless compounds, which, moreover, should also be more compatible.<br>
It has no\v been found that compounds of general formula 1<br>

The compounds according to the invention prevent a ryrosine phosphorylation or stop persistent angiogenesis and thus the growth and propagation of tumors, whereby they are distinguished in particular by a slighter inhibition of isoforms of Cytochrome P 450 (2C9 and2C19).<br>
Many pharmaceutical agents are degraded via these isoforms. In an inhibition of these isoforms, the plasma level of these pharmaceutical agents increases, which can result in undesirable side effects.<br>

The compounds according to the invention as well as their physiologically compatible salts prevent a ryrosine phosphorylanon or stop the persistent angiogenesis and thus the growth and a propagation of tumors, whereby they are distinguished in particular by a slighter inhibition of isoforms of Cytochrome P 450 (2C9 and 2C19). Medication using the compounds according to the invention can therefore be done at no risk even without regard 10 pharmaceutical agents that are adminisrered at the same lime and that are degraded via these isoforms.<br>
The compounds of formula I as well as their physiologically compatible salts can be used as pharmaceutical agents based on their inhibitory activity relative to the phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor. Based on their profile of action, the compounds according to the invention are suitable for treating diseases that are caused or promoted by persistent angiogenesis.<br>
Since the compounds of formula I are identified as inhibitors of the ryrosine kinases VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, they are suitable in particular for treating those diseases that are caused or promoted by persistent angiogenesis that is triggered via the VEGF receptor or by an increase in vascular permeability.<br>
The subject of this invention is also the use of the compounds according to the invention as inhibitors of the ryrosine kinases VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, or KDR and FIT.<br>
Subjects of this invention are thus also pharmaceutical agents for treating rumors or use thereof.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used either alone or in a formulation as pharmaceutical agents for treating psoriasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, restenosis, such as, e.g., stent-induced restenosis, endometriosis, Crohn's disease, Hodgkin's disease, leukemia; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases, arteriosclerosis, injuries to nerve tissue, and for inhibiting the reocclusion of vessels after balloon catheter treatment, in vascular prostherics or after mechanical devices are used to keep vessels open, such as, e.g., stents, as immunosuppressive agents, for supporring scar-free healing, in senile keratosis and in contact dermatitis.<br>
In treating injuries to nerve tissue, quick scar formation on the injury sites can be prevented with the compounds according to the invention., i.e., scar formation is prevented from occurring before the axons reconnect. A reconstruction of the nerve compounds was thus facilitated.<br>
The formation of ascites in patients can also be suppressed with the compounds according to the invention. VEGF-induced edemas can also be suppressed.<br>
Lymphangiogenesis plays an important role in lymphogenic meiastasizing (Karpanen, T. et al., Cancere Res. 2001 Mar 1, 61(5): 1786-90, Veikkola, T., et al., EMBO J. 2001, Mar 15; 20 (6): 1223-31).<br>
The compounds according to the invention now also show excellent action as VEGFR kinase 3 inhibitors and are therefore also suitable as effective inhibitors of lymphangiogenesis.<br>
By a treatment with the compounds according to the invention, not only a reduction in rhe size of metastases but also a reduction in the number of metastases is achieved.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are also effective in the case of diseases that are associated with excessive lymphangiogenesis and are therefore expected in the lymphangiohyperplasia and - dysplasia syndrome.<br>
Such pharmaceutical agents, their formulations and usca, arc also subjects of this invention.<br>
The invention thus also relates to the use of the compounds of general formula I for the production of a pharmaceutical agent for use as or for treatment of psoriasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, restenosis, such as, e.g., stent-induced restenosis, endometriosis, Crohn's disease, Hodgkin's disease, leukemia; arrhritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic rerinopathy, neovascuiar glaucoma, renal diseases, such as glomerulonephriiis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclcrosis, rhrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of rhe liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases, arteriosclerosis, injuries to nerve tissue, and for inhibiting the reocclusion of vessels after balloon catheter treatment, in vascular prosthetics or after mechanical devices are used to keep vessels open, such as, e.g., stems, as immunosuppressive agents, for supporting scar-free healing, in senile keratosis and in contact dermatitis.<br>
The formation of ascites in patients can also be suppressed with the compounds according to the invention. VEGF-mduced edemas can also be suppressed.<br>
To use the compounds of formula I as pharmaceutical agents, the latter are brought into the form of a pharmaceutical preparation, which in addition to the active ingredient for enteral or paremeral administration contains suitable pharmaceutical, organic or inorganic inert carrier materials, such as, for example, water, gelatin, gum arabic, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, vegetable oils, polyalkylene glycols, etc. The pharmaceutical preparations can be present in solid form, for example as tablets, coated tablets, suppositories, capsules or in liquid form, for example as solutions, suspensions or emulsions. They also contain, moreover, adjuvants such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents or emulsifiers, salts for changing osmotic pressure or buffers.<br>
For parenteral administration, especially injection solutions or suspensions, especially aqueous solutions of the active compounds in polyhydroxyethoxylated castor oil, are suitable.<br>
As carrier systems, surface-active adjuvants such as salts of bile acids or animal or plant phospholipids, but also mixtures thereof as well as liposomes or components thereof can also be used.<br>
For oral administration, especially tablets, coated tablets or capsules with talc and/or hydrocarbon vehicles or binders, such as for example, lactose, com starch or potato starch, are suitable. The administration can also be carried out in liquid form, such as, for example, as juice, to which optionally a sweetener or, if necessary, one or more flavoring substances, is added.<br>
The dosage of ihe active ingredients can vary depending on the method of administration, age and weight of the patient, type and seventy of The disease to be treated and similar factors. The daily dose is 0.5-1000 mg, preferably 50-200 mg, whereby the dose can be given as a single dose to be administered once or divided into 2 or more daily doses.<br>
The above-described formulations and forms for dispensing are also subjects of this invention.<br>
The production of the compounds according to the invention is carried out according to methods that are known in the an. For example, compounds of formula I are obtained, in that a compound of general formula II<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
in which A, B, D, G, L, M, Q, W and R1 have the meanings that are indicated in general formula I and E stands for a carboxylic acid -COOH,<br>
is reacted in a suitable solvent and a suitable organic base, with an arnme of general formula III<br>
in which RB and Ry have the meanings rhat are indicated in general formula I, according TO processes that are known in the literature, or iff means a nitnle group, the nitrile is saponified to form amide, or a compound of general formula IV<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
in which A, B, D, G, L, M, Q, W, R and R have the meanings that are indicated in general formula I, and Rx means an ester or acid group, is convened into the corresponding amide.<br>
The amide formation is carried out according to methods that are known in the literature.<br>
For amide formation, it is possible to start from a corresponding ester. The ester is reacted according to J. Org. Chem. 1995, 8414 with aluminum trimethyl and the corresponding amine in solvents such as toluene at temperatures of 0Â°C to the boiling point of the solvent. If the molecule contains two ester groups, both are convened into the same amide. Instead of aluminum trimethyl, sodium hexamethyldisilazide can also be used.<br>
For amide formation, however, all processes that are known from peptide chemistry are also available. For example, the corresponding acid can be reacted with the amine in aprotic polar solvents, such as, for example, dimethylformamide, via an activated acid derivative, obtainable, for example, wiih hydroxybenzotriazolc and a caibodiimide, such as, for example, diisopropylcarbodiirnide, or else with preformed reagents, such as, for example, HATU (Chem. Comm. 1994, 201) or BTU, at temperatures of between 0Â°C and The boiling point of the solvem, preferably at 80CC. For the amide formation, the process can also be used with the mixed acid anhydride, imidazolide or azide.<br>
Nitriles can also be saponified to form amides according to processes that are known in the literature. The reaction with potassium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide is very effective in an aprotic polar solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide, preferably at room temperature according to Synthesis, 1989, 949.<br>
In addition, the compounds of general formula I according to the invention can be produced in that a compound of general formula Ha<br>
in which A, B, D, G, L, M, Q, W and R1 have the meanings that are indicated in general formula 1, and E means a halogen or an 0-sulfonate, such as, e.g , a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, an 0-nifluoromethanesulfonate or O-methylsulfonate,<br>
a.	is reacted with appropriately substituted terminal alken.es in a Heck<br>
reaction (cf. "Palladium Reagents in Organic Syntheses," Academic Press<br>
1985, New York, pp. 179 ff.) or with vmylboronic acids or vinylboronic<br>
acid esters in a Suzuki reaction (cf. Tetrahedron Lett. 1983, 39, 3271 ff.) or<br>
with vinyl stannanes in a Siille reaction (cf. Pure &amp; Appl. Chem. 1985, 57,<br>
1771), or<br>
b.	is coupled with any substituted terminal alkines, for example, according to<br>
the method of Stephens-Casrro (cf. J. Org. Chem. 1963, 28, 3313 ff.) or<br>

c.	is coupled with aryl and hetaryl boronic acids or their esters in a Suzuki<br>
reaction (cf. Ace. Chem. Res. 1991, 63, 419 ff. or J. Am. Chem. Soc.<br>

(cf. Angew. Chem. 1986, 98, 504 ff. or Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999, 38,<br>
2411 ff.) or with aryl and hetaryl Grignard compounds or the analogous<br>
zinc-organic derivatives in a Negishi reaction (cf. "Metal-Catalyzed Cross-<br>
Coupling Reaction," Eds. Diederich/Stang, Wiley-VCH 1998, New York,<br>
Chapter 1 or else J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 2719 ff), or<br>
d.	is converted in a palladium-catalyzed carbonylation under 1 to 20 bar of<br>
carbon monoxide atmosphere in dimethylformamide in the presence of die<br>
corresponding alcohol (cf. "Palladium Reagents in Organic Syntheses,"<br>
Academic Press 1985, New York, pp. 352 ff. or Synth. Comm. 1997, 27,<br>
515 ff.) into the corresponding carboxylic acid ester, or<br>
e.	is convened in a palladium-catalyzed carbonylarion under 1 to 20 bar of<br>
carbon monoxide atmosphere in dimethylformamide-water mixtures into<br>
the corresponding carboxylic acid (cf. J. Org. Chem. 1981, 46, 4614 ff).<br>
The carboxylic acids can also be obtained by saponification of the<br>
carboxylic acid esters, or<br>
f.	the corresponding carboxylic acid amides are produced in a palladium-<br>
catalyzed carbonylation under 1 to 20 bar of carbon monoxide annosphere<br>
in dimethylformamide in the presence of amines (cf. "Palladium Reagents<br>
in Organic Syntheses," Academic Press 1985, New York, pp. 352 ff.,<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 1982, 23, 3383 ff.). The synthesis of the carboxylic acid<br>
amides can also be carried out from carboxylic acid esters; the method<br>
according TO Weinreb has especially proven its value here (cf. Tetrahedron<br>
Len. 1977, 17, 4171 ff., J. Org. Chem. 1995, 60, 8414 ff). The carboxylic<br>
acid amides can also be synthesized from the carboxylic acids that are<br>
produced under e); basically all processes that are known from the peptide<br>
chemistry are available for this purpose (cf. Synthesis 1972, 453-63 or<br>
"Comprehensive Organic Transformations," Wiley-VCH 1989, New<br>
York, 972-6). For example, the corresponding carboxylic acid in aprotic<br>
polar solvents, such as, for example dimethylformamide. can be reacted with an activated carboxylic acid derivative, produced, for example, by adding carbonyldiimidazole, at temperatures of benveen 0-120Â°C, preferably at room temperature, with amines, such as, for example HATU (Chem. Comm. 1994, 201), or<br>
g.   the corresponding Sulfide is convened with thioalkylene, thioarylene and rhiohetarylene directly, in the presence of bases, such as, for example, potassium hydride or potassium tert-butanolate or transition metals, such as, for example, copper chips, copper chlonde or copper bromide or palladium dichlonde in aprotic solvents, such as, for example, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide or xylene at temperatures of between 20-200Â°C. The execution of the reaction in a microwave device can rum out to be advantageous in this case (cf. Tetrahedron 1983, 39, 4153 ff.)- The production of 2-thio-substirur.ed pyridyl derivatives can also be carried out easily from the 2-pyridone derivative after tiuonylation with phosphorus pentasulfide (cf. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr.; 1953; 1001 ff.) aiLawesson's reagent (Tetrahedron 1984, 40, 2047 ff.) and subsequent alkylation with alkyl halides, preferably with alkyl iodides (cf. J. Org. Chenj. 1999; 64, 7935-9) or alkyl sulfonates, preferably aUcyltrifluorornethylsulfonates.<br>
h.   The corresponding sulfoxides can be obtained by oxidation of sulfides with standard oxidizing agents, such as, for example, hydrogen peroxide, sodium penodate, tert-butoxy hypochlorite, sodium chlorite;,<br>
metachloroperbenzoic acid, trifluoroperoxyaceric acid, dimethyl dioxiram, cerium ammonium nitrate or nitric acid (cf. "Oxidations in Organic Chemistry," ACS Washington 1990, pp. 252-63) in solvents, such as, for example, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, terrahydiofuran, aceronitrile, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone; dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethoxyethane, diglyme, tetraglyme or water, at temperatures of between 20Â°C and the boiling point of the solvent. The thus obtained Sulfoxides can further be oxidized to the corresponding sulfones; the latter is achieved, for example, by oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate, sodium perborate or potassium hydrogen persulfate (cf. Tetrahedron Lett. 1981, 22, 1287 ff.) in solvents, such as, for example, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, retrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or water, at temperatures of between 20Â°C and the boiling point of the solvent. The treatment of sulfides with an excess of the above-cited oxidizing agents results directly in the corresponding sulfones (cf. "The Chemistry of Sulphones and Sulfoxides" in Patai, Wiley 1988, New York, pp. 165-231). i.   By oxidation of the thiols that are obtained under gj, the chlorosulfonates can be produced; the oxidation with chlorine in aqueous hydrochloric acid (cf. J. Org.

J. Chan. Soc. Chem. Comm. 1989, 81 ff). From the laner in turn, the corresponding sulfonic acid chlorides can be obtained by oxidation with hypochlonte.<br>
k.   By reaction of the chlorosulfonates that are cited under i) with amines, in solvents, such as, for example, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, N-methyl-pyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethoxyethane or water, at temperatures of between 0Â°C and the boiling point of the solvent, the corresponding sulfonamides can be obtained (cf. Tetrahedron 2000, 56, 8253-62).<br>

diisopropylethylamine, ai temperatures of between 0Â°C and the boiling temperature of the solvent, preferably at 80Â°C, the corresponding phosphonates can be obtained (cf. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1982, 55, 909 ff.)-<br>
n.   By retaliation, for example with n-buryllithium. iec-butyllithium, tert-buryllithium, merhylhthium, lithium diisopropylamide or ethyl magnesium bromide, in aprotic solvents such as, for example, dierhyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, at temperatures of between -100Â°C and 0Â°C, preferably at-78Â°C in tetrahydrofuran and reaction with isocyanates, the corresponding carboxylic acid amides can be obtained. o.
