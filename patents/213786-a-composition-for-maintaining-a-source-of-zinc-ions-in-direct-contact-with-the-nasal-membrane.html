				<td>This invention relates to compositions and methods for delivering minor<br>
effective amounts of a substance to the blood in a body.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to a method and composition for<br>
delivering a minor effective amount of a substance to the nasal membrane.<br>
In a further respect, the invention relates to a composition which maintains<br>
zinc in an ionic state for delivery to the nasal membrane.<br>
In another respect, the invention relates to a composition which maintains a<br>
substance in direct contact with the nasal membrane for an extended period of time.<br>
The common cold is one of the most frequently occurring human illnesses and<br>
is responsible for substantial morbidity and economic loss. Ionic zinc is a known<br>
effective anti-rhino virus agent in vitro and in vivo.<br>
In one in vivo study reported in 1991, a double-blind clinical trial<br>
demonstrated the effectiveness of orally administered zinc gluconate/glycerine<br>
lozenges. The lozenges used in the study contained twenty-three milligrams of zinc<br>
provided by 179 milligrams of zinc gluconate trihydrate which provided a 13.1<br>
millimolar ionic zinc concentration in the oral cavity. During the study, lozenges<br>
administered at two hour intervals resulted in a forty-two percent reduction in mean<br>
cold duration and in a marked reduction in both the number and severity of<br>
symptoms if treatment with the lozenges was initiated within two days of the onset of<br>
cold symptoms. A second study reported in 1992 (Zarmebo J.E., Godfrey J. C,<br>
Godfrey N., J Pharm Sci 1992; 81: 128-130) confirmed the findings of the 1991<br>
study. Soon after the results of these studies became widely known, a number of<br>
companies began marketing their own versions of the zinc lozenge cold remedy.<br>
While zinc lozenges are usually beneficial in treating a cold, the lozenges<br>
A COMPOSITION FOR MAINTAINING A SOURCE OF ZINC IONS IN<br>
DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE NASAL MEMBRANE<br>
have several drawbacks. First, the majority of zinc in a zinc gluconate lozenge is<br>
released in the oral cavity. The principal site, however, of antiviral activity is<br>
believed to be the nasal cavity (Novick S. G., Godfrey J. C, Godfrey N. J.. Wilder<br>
H. R., Medical Hypothesis 1996; 46. 295-302). It is surmised that some ionic zinc<br>
released by a lozenge in the oral cavity makes its way to nasal passages where the<br>
zinc binds to viral ICAM-1 receptors and inhibits rhinovirus from binding to and<br>
infecting nasal mucosal cells. The difficulty encountered by ionic zinc or another<br>
substance in a lozenge in attempting to travel from the oral cavity to the nasal cavity<br>
limits the effectiveness of lozenges. Further, in a congested individual the route<br>
from the oral cavity to the nasal cavity may be completely blocked, rendering the<br>
lozenges ineffective.<br>
A second disadvantage associated with zinc lozenges is the production of<br>
significant side effects. In one study, twenty percent of the subjects complained of<br>
nausea and eight percent complained of bad taste reactions (Novick S. G., Godfrey J.<br>
C, Godfrey N. J., Wilder H. R., Medical Hypothesis 1996; 46: 295-302). With<br>
respect to the nausea, it is well established that excessive zinc in the intestinal tract<br>
interferes with copper absorption and that preventing the absorption by the body of<br>
sufficient quantities of copper can lead to a variety of undesirable pathological states.<br>
The overuse of zinc lozenges may contribute to copper depletion.<br>
We have discovered a novel gel composition and method for delivering ionic |<br><br>
 (positively charged) zinc and other active substances to the nasal epithelial membrane<br>
Without encountering the disadvantages normally associated with lozenges. The<br>
composition maintains ionic zinc or another active substance in direct contact with<br>
the nasal membrane, preferably for an extended period of time of at least one-quarter<br>
hour, and delivers zinc or another active substance into the nasal membrane and into<br>
blood in the nasal membrane.<br>
When the gel composition is a homeopathic composition, it includes from<br>
75% to 99.999% by weight of at least one carrier and a minor effective amount of an<br>
active substance. The minor effective amount in the gel composition includes from<br>
0.0000001% to 5.0% by weight of the active substance.<br>
When the gel composition is a pharmaceutical composition, it includes from<br>
75% to 99.999% by weight of at least one carrier and a minor effective amount of an<br>
active substance. The minor effective amount includes from 0.0000001 % to 10.0%<br>
by weight in the composition of the active substance. As would be appreciated by<br>
those of skill in the art, small concentrations of active substances may not be deemed<br>
homeopathic but can still be beneficial to the body. Such "non-homeopathic"<br>
concentrations of an acitve substance are herein deemed to produce a pharmaceutical<br>
composition.<br>
When the gel composition is a homeopathic composition and zinc is the active<br>
substance, the composition includes from 0.185% to 2.8% by weight (from about 4<br>
mM to 60 mM), preferably 0.9% to 2.0% by weight (from about 20 mM to 44 mM),<br>
zinc gluconate. Each 0.1% by weight zinc gluconate in the composition produces a<br>
concentration of approximately 0.014% by weight ionic zinc (i.e., of about 2.2 mM<br>
ionic zinc). At least a 4 mM concentration of ionic zinc is preferred in the gel<br>
composition to insure that a sufficiently high concentration of ionic zinc is produced<br>
by the composition at the interface between the composition and the nasal membrane.<br>
The composition has a viscosity in the range of 2,500 to 40,000 centipoise,<br>
preferably 5,000 to 20,000 centipoise. The viscosity of the composition is important<br>
because it facilitates maintenance of the composition in the nasal cavity in contact<br>
with the nasal membrane or with mucous on the membrane. When the viscosity is I<br>
less than about 2,500 centipoise, the composition tends to be drawn by gravity out of<br>
the nasal cavity. If the viscosity is in excess of about 40,000 centipoise, the<br>
thickness of the composition interferes with the diffusion of ionic zinc through the<br>
composition to the nasal membrane. During the development of the composition of<br>
the invention, nasal sprays were considered and discarded because the low viscosity<br>
of the liquids comprising such sprays allows the liquids to flow under gravity out of<br>
the nasal cavity, preventing the sprays from contacting the nasal membrane for an<br>
extended period of time. The effectiveness of a nasal spray usually substantially<br>
dissipates in less than five minutes. Similarly, applying the composition on a swab<br>
or nose plug is not believed efficient because the swab or nose plug, which may for<br>
example be made of cotton or of a sponge material retain the composition and<br>
interferes with the delivery of an additional supply of the composition into contact<br>
with the nasal membrane following dissipation of the composition which is on the<br>
surface of the swab or plug and is in direct contact with the nasal membrane.<br>
As noted, nasal sprays were avoided during development of the invention. By<br>
 way of background with respect to zinc—bearing nasal sprays, US. Patent No.<br>
5,688,32 concerns antiallergic spray preparations and discloses and claims a method<br>
for the treatment of an allergic condition in which a spray solution is applied to the<br>
eye or respiratory tract of a mammal having the allergic condition. The spray<br>
solution includes a non-toxic, anti-allergy effective amount of ionic zinc in a<br>
concentration below that which causes irritation to mucus membranes. The majority<br>
of the ionic zinc in the spray solution is unchelated zinc and is in the form of free<br>
ionic solution, wherein the solution has a zinc ion content of between about 0.002<br>
and about 0.12%(w/v). The allergic condition treated with the spray solution can<br>
comprises hay-fever and asthma. The spray solution can be selected from the group<br>
consisting of essentially aqueous and essentially saline solutions; can have a zinc ion<br>
content of about 0.04% (w/v); can comprise a mineral acid salt of zinc as solute; can<br>
comprise a solute selected from the group consisting of zinc sulfate and zinc chloride;<br>
can be dispensed in aliquots of about either 0.05 to 0.5 ml or 0.2 ml; and/or, can<br>
include at least one other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredient. The other<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable ingredient can be selected from the group consisting of<br>
antihistamines, scenting agents and active ingredients; or, can comprise ascorbate.<br>
 U.S. Patent No. 5,688,532 also discloses and claims an improvement in a method for<br>
treatment of an allergic condition by the administration of a zinc compound to a<br>
mammal possessed of an allergic condition. The improvement consists essentially of<br>
spraying a solution comprising a non-toxic, anti-allergy effective amount of ionic zinc<br>
to the eye or respiratory tract of a mammal possess of the allergic condition. The<br>
solution comprises a concentration of ionic zinc below that which causes irritation to<br>
mucus membranes. The majority of the ionic zinc in the spray is unchelated zinc and<br>
is in the form of free ionic solution. The solution has a zinc ion content of between<br>
about 0.002 and 0.12%(w/v).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,622,724 discloses and claims a method for the treatment of<br>
the symptoms of the common cold comprising administering a spray of a solution<br>
containing a non-toxic, symptom effective treating amount of a solution of a<br>
substantially unchelated ionic zinc compound. The solution contains substantially<br>
unchelated zinc ions in a concentration of from about 0.004 to about 0.12% (w/vol),<br>
to the nostrils and respiratory tract of a patient in need thereof. The solution can be<br>
selected from the group consisting of aqueous and saline solutions; can further<br>
comprises an effective amount of a flavor and/or odor enhancing agent; can have an<br>
unchelated zinc ion content of about 0.04% (w/v); or, can consist essentially of the<br>
substantially unchelated ionic zinc compound and at least one pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier. The substantially unchelated ionic zinc compound can comprise a<br>
mineral acid salt of zinc; can comprise a salt selected from the group consisting of<br>
zinc sulfate and zinc chloride; or, can comprise zinc sulfate. Utilization of zinc<br>
chloride at concentrations greater than 0.2%, especially greater than 0.4% is not<br>
preferred because, as is well known in the art, the zinc chloride is caustic. The<br>
carrier utilized in the invention can include 0.05% to 5.0% by weight glycerine. The<br>
glycerine is important and is presently preferred because it allows zinc to remain in<br>
an ionic state until the zinc contacts the nasal membrane and/or mucous on the nasal<br>
membrane. One problem encountered during development of the invention was<br>
identifying a carrier which maintains zinc in an ionic state.<br>
The gel composition of the invention which utilizes zinc as the active<br>
substance preferably permits ionic zinc to diffuse through the composition to the<br>
nasal epithelial membrane or mucous on the epithelial membrane. This facilitates the<br>
availability of a continuous supply of ionic zinc because the composition will<br>
continue via diffusion to supply zinc without requiring that the portion of the<br>
composition adjacent the nasal epithelial membrane (on mucous on the membrane)<br>
dissolve or dissipate and expose a fresh portion of the composition containing ionic<br>
zinc. As noted, composition viscosities in excess of about 40,000 centipoise are<br>
believed to interfere with the diffusion of zinc through the composition. Viscosity<br>
measurements recited herein were obtained using the Brookfield Syncho-Lectric<br>
Viscometer for the measurement of the apparent Viscosity of Newtonian and Non-<br>
Newtonian materials at low shear rates at given rotational speeds (ASTM D1824-87).<br>
See also ASTM D1084-88, ASTM D2196-86 and other ASTM protocols concerning<br>
the measurement of viscosity.<br>
We have also discovered a method of delivering minor effective amounts of a<br>
metal into the blood. The metal is the active substance. The method includes the<br>
step of providing a viscous delivery composition. The delivery composition includes<br>
90% to 99.995% by weight of at least one carrier and less than 1.5% by weight of<br>
the metal. The composition has a viscosity in the range of 2,500 to 40,000<br>
centipoise. The method includes the additional steps of applying the delivery<br>
composition in the nasal cavity in direct contact with the nasal membrane, and<br>
maintaining the delivery composition in contact with the nasal membrane for at least<br>
one-sixth hour.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, we provide an improved method of<br>
delivering minor effective amounts of an active substance into the blood. The<br>
method includes the step of providing a viscous delivery composition including 75 %<br>
to 99.999% by weight of at least one carrier, and a minor effective amount of the<br>
active substance. The composition has a viscosity in the range of 2,500 to 40,000<br>
centipoise. The method also includes the step of applying the delivery composition<br>
in the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity includes mucous, cilia and a nasal membrane.<br>
The delivery composition is applied such that a first portion of the composition<br>
directly contacts at least the nasal membrane, a second portion of the composition<br>
directly contacts at least mucous in the nasal cavity, and at least a third portion of the<br>
composition directly contacts at least cilia in the nasal cavity. The method also<br>
includes the step of maintaining the first portion of the delivery composition in<br>
contact with the nasal membrane for at least ten minutes.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, we provide an improved method of<br>
delivering a minor effective amount of an active substance to the blood and of<br>
reducing the time required to deliver the substance into the blood by increasing the<br>
ability of the active substance to penetrate the body. The improved method<br>
comprises the steps of providing at least one carrier; providing at least one active<br>
substance; and, providing at least one permeation enhancer to facilitate passage of the<br>
active substance through a nasal membrane in a nasal cavity. The nasal cavity also<br>
includes mucous and cilia. The improved method further includes the step of<br>
combining the carrier, active substance, and permeation enhancer to produce a<br>
viscous delivery composition including 75% to 99.999% by weight of said carrier,<br>
including a minor effective amount of the active substance, and including a minor<br>
effect amount of the permeation enhancer. The composition has a viscosity in the<br>
range of 2,500 to 40,000 centipoise. The method also includes the step of applying<br>
the delivery composition in the nasal cavity such that a first portion of the<br>
composition directly contacts at least the nasal membrane, such that a second portion<br>
of the composition directly contacts at least the mucous in the nasal cavity. and at<br>
least a third portion of the composition directly contacts the cilia in the nasal cavity;<br>
and, maintaining the first portion of said delivery composition in contact with the<br>
nasal membrane for at least ten minutes.<br>
In still another embodiment of our invention, we provide an improved method<br>
of delivering a minor effective amount of an active substance to the blood and of<br>
reducing the time required for the active substance to pass through membrane into the<br>
blood by increasing the surface area over which the active substance contacts the<br>
body. The improved method includes the step of providing a viscous delivery<br>
composition including 75% to 99.999% by weight of at least one carrier, and a<br>
minor effective amount of the active substance. The composition has a viscosity in<br>
the range of 2,500 to 40,000 centipoise. The method also includes the step of<br>
applying the delivery composition in the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity includes a<br>
nasal membrane, cilia and mucous. A first portion of the composition directly<br>
contacts at least the nasal membrane, a second portion of the composition directly ;<br>
contacts at least said mucous in the nasal cavity, and at least a third portion of the<br>
composition directly contacts at least the cilia in the nasal cavity. The improved<br>
method also includes the step of increasing the action of the cilia in the nasal cavity.<br>
In yet a further embodiment of our invention, we provide an improved<br>
method for controlling the rate at which minor effective amounts of an active<br>
substance are delivered into the blood. The improved method includes the step of<br>
providing a viscous delivery composition including 75% to 99.999% by weight of at<br>
least one carrier, and a minor effective amount of the active substance. The<br>
composition has a viscosity in the range of 2,500 to 40,000 centipoise. The method<br>
also includes the steps of determining the carrier diffusion rate at which the active<br>
substance diffuses through the carrier at a selected temperature and a selected<br>
pressure; determining the membrane diffusion rate at which the active substance<br>
penetrates a nasal membrane when the delivery composition contacts the nasal<br>
membrane at the selected temperature and pressure; selecting at least one of a<br>
diffusion rate pair comprising the carrier diffusion rate, and the membrane diffusion<br>
rate;and, adding a component to the viscous delivery composition to produce a<br>
modified viscous delivery composition in which the diffusion rate of the one of the<br>
diffusion rate pair is altered.<br>
The following examples depict the presently preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention for the purposes of illustrating the practice thereof and not be way of<br>
limitation of the scope of the invention. In the examples, all proportions are by<br>
weight, unless otherwise noted.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
One liter of a gel composition is prepared by mixing together purified water,<br>
glycerin, carbopol, and zinc gluconate. The gel includes:<br>
Component Weight Percent<br>
PURIFIED WATER 97.0<br>
GLYCERIN U.S.P. 2.0<br>
CARBOPOL 940 nf 0.5<br>
ZINC GLUCONATE (source of ionic zinc) 1.5 (33.3 millimolar<br>
concentration) * .<br>
* The molecular weight of zinc gluconate, about 450 g/mole, multiplied times<br>
0.0333 moles per liter of zinc gluconate gives a weight of about 15<br>
grams per liter of the gel composition.<br>
The concentration of zinc gluconate in the gel composition of the invention is<br>
preferably in the range of from 0.185% to 2.8% by weight (from about 4 mM to 60<br>
mM), preferably 0.9% to 2.0% by weight (from about 20 mM to 44 mM), zinc<br>
gluconate. The carrier in the gel composition can vary as desired, but presently<br>
preferably includes 90.0 to 99.0% purified water, 0.05 to 5.0% by weight glycerine<br>
(a thickener which also functions to permit zinc to maintain its ionic state), and<br>
0.000001% to 5.0% by weight, preferably 0.1% to 3.0% by weight, of a<br>
carbohydrate or other thickener. A carbohydrate thickener is presently preferred.<br>
Other thickeners which can be utilized include: carrageenan, sugar, guar gum, and<br>
methylcellulose. The glycerine in the carrier produces a matrix which permits zinc<br>
ions to readily diffuse therethrough. The glycerine is also preferred because it has<br>
the ability to dissolve into and permeate mucous and the nasal epithelial membrane,<br>
carrying with it ionic zinc.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Two hundred and fifty microliters of the zinc gel of Example 1 is placed in<br>
one nasal passage of a healthy thirty-nine year old male Caucasian patient. Two<br>
hundred and fifty microliters of the zinc gel of Example 1 is then placed in the other<br>
nasal passage of the patient. Consequently, a total of 500 microliters of the gel is<br>
placed in the patient"s nose. A first portion of the gel contacts at least a portion of<br>
the nasal epithelial membrane. A second portion of the gel contacts at least a portion<br>
of the mucous in the patient"s nose. A third portion of the gel contacts at least cilia<br>
in the patient"s nose. The gel remains in contact with at least a portion of the nasal<br>
epithelial membrane, the cilia, or mucous on the membrane. After four hours the<br>
zinc gel has completely dissipated.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Example 2 is repeated, except the individual is a twenty-four year old African<br>
American patient who has been experiencing mild cold symptoms for one day. The<br>
gel remains in contact with at least a portion of the nasal epithelial membrane or the.....<br>
mucous layer on the membrane. After four hours the zinc gel has completely<br>
dissipated and the patient notices a marked reduction in the severity of his cold<br>
symptoms.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Example 3 is repeated, except that the zinc gel of the invention is not<br>
administered to the twenty-four year old African American patient, nor is any other<br>
medication. After four hours, he does not notice any reduction in the severity of his<br>
cold symptoms.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Examples 3 and 4 are repeated, except the individual treated is a fifteen year<br>
old Japanese girl who has been suffering from mild cold symptoms for a day.<br>
Similar results are obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Examples 3 and 4 are repeated, except the individual treated is a fifty year old<br>
Caucasian man who has been suffering from cold symptoms for two days. Similar<br>
results are obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Example 2 is repeated except that the concentration of zinc in the nasal<br>
mucosa is measured just prior to insertion of the zinc gel; and, is measured ten<br>
minutes, thirty minutes, one hour, two hours, three hours, and four hours after the<br>
gel is inserted in the individual"s nasal cavity. The following results are obtained:<br>
Time of Measurement Zinc Concentration (Wt. %)<br>
Just prior to administration 0.003%<br>
of zinc gel<br>
Ten minutes after administration 0.008%<br>
of zinc gel<br>
One-half hour after administration 0.01 %<br>
of zinc gel<br>
One hour after administration 0.01 %<br>
of zinc gel<br>
Two hours after administration 0.011%<br>
of zinc gel<br>
Three hours after administration 0.012%<br>
of zinc gel<br>
Four hours after administration 0.012%<br>
of zinc gel<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Examples 1 to 6 are repeated, except that the concentration of ionic zinc in<br>
the composition is 20 mM instead of 33.3 millimolar. Similar results are obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Example 1 to 6 are repeated, except that the concentration of ionic zinc in the<br>
composition is 44 mM instead of 33.3 millimolar. Similar results are obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Examples 1 to 6 are repeated, except that the concentration of ionic zinc in<br>
the composition is 10 mM instead of 33.3 millimolar. Similar results are obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Example 1 is repeated, except mat the zinc gel composition is prepared<br>
utilizing 1.5% by weight of NATROSOL (TM) (hydroxyethylcellulose) in place of<br>
carbopol and 96% by weight purified water instead of 91% by weight purified water.<br>
The weight percent of each of the glycerin and zinc gluconate in the gel composition<br>
is unchanged.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>

obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
Examples 8 to 10 are repeated except that the zinc gel composition of<br>
Example 11 is utilized in place of the zinc gel composition of Example 1, and the<br>
ionic zinc concentration in the Example 11 zinc gel composition is altered as<br>
specified in each of Examples 8 to 10. Similar results are obtained.<br>
The NATROSOL utilized in Example 11 is obtained from Hercules<br>
Coporation of 1313 North Market Street, Wilimington, Delaware 19894.<br>
Hydroxyethylcellulose can be obtained from other vendors.<br>
One of the objectives of the invention is the delivery into the blood via the<br>
nasal membrane homeopathic concentrations of metals, chemical elements or other<br>
active substances. This ordinarily requires the delivery of specific selected titrated<br>
 concentrations (i.e., minor effective amounts) of a substance. If an active substance<br>
 or component is delivered to the blood stream in a concentration which is too high,<br><br>
this can have an adverse effect in the body. The delivery of minor effective amounts<br>
of active substances to the blood stream via the nasal membrane in accordance with<br>
the invention is believed highly advantageous because it offers a rapid delivery into<br>
the blood stream of selected metered minor effective amounts of a metal, chemical<br>
element(s), composition(s), or other active substance. Attempting to deliver orally<br>
homeopathic titrated amounts of chemical elements or compositions often is not<br>
believed practical because of the degradation of chemical elements which occurs in<br>
the oral cavity. As earlier noted, as used herein homeopathic concentrations of an<br>
active substance in the gel composition of the invention occur when the active<br>
substance is in the gel composition in a minor effective amount at a concentration in<br>
the range of 0.0000001% to 5.0%.<br>
As utilized herein, a metal, chemical element, or other component or chemical<br>
composition is deemed an active substance if the metal, chemical element, etc.<br>
produces a beneficial physiological effect on the body. An active substance produces<br>
a beneficial physiological effect on the body if the substance after entering a patient"s<br>
body the active substance benefits the skeletal system, the digestive system, the<br>
respiratory system, the circulatory system, the reproductive system, the urinary<br>
system, the endocrine system, the skin, or the nervous system of the body. One way<br>
an active substance can produce a beneficial physiological effect is by helping the<br>
body fight disease. Another way is by helping the body heal. Another way by<br>
improving the functioning of a system in the body. As would be appreciated by those<br>
of skill in the art, an active substance can comprise any of a large list of chemical<br>
compositions including, but not limited to vitamins, minerals, insulin and other<br>
polypeptides, nicotine, genes, substances which alter genes or which facilitate the<br>
formation of genes or which disable genes, and pharmaceutical and homeopathic<br>
substances. Nicotine can function as an active substance when used to compensate<br>
for the nicotine in cigarettes in order to facilitate a person in breaking the habit of<br>
smoking cigarettes. This benefits the lungs and other systems and organs in the<br>
body.<br>
As used herein, the carrier comprises all the components in the nasal gel<br>
composition other than the active substance(s) in the nasal gel. Consequently, the<br>
carrier includes the fluid component of the gel composition (i.e., water, oil, alcohol,<br>
etc.), includes any thickeners in the nasal gel (i.e., glycerin, carrageenan, sugar, guar<br>
gum, methylcellulose, etc.), includes permeation enhancers (i.e., liposomes,<br>
chitosan, cyclodextrin, etc.), and includes any other components besides active<br>
substances.<br>
As used herein, a permeation enhancer functions to facilitate the passage of an<br>
active substance through the nasal membrane, to protect an active substance from<br>
being damaged or altered as it passes through the nasal membrane, and/or to carry an<br>
active substance to a desired target in the body after the active substances passes<br>
through the nasal membrane. Examples of membrane permeation enhancers include<br>
liposomes, chitosan, and cyclodextrin, A liposome can encapsulate a drug or other<br>
active substance and can protect the drug from damage or alteration when the<br>
liposome passes through the nasal epithelial membrane. The liposome may also<br>
facilitate passage through the nasal epithelial membrane by entering, passing through,<br>
and exiting a cell which comprises a portion of the nasal membrane. A liposome can<br>
be constructed to be a "stealth" liposome which can not be "seen" by the liver and<br>
degraded by the liver. For example, putting polyethylene glycol in a small<br>
concentration in a liposome turns the liposome into a "stealth" liposome which is not<br>
"seen" and degraded by the liver. The liposome may also be targeted to a specific<br>
site in the body. For example, an antigen can be removed from cardiac tissue and<br>
used to make an antibody. The antibody is placed in the liposome carrying the active<br>
substance. When the liposome passes through the nasal membrane and enters the<br>
body, the antibody will-along with the liposome and active substance carried in the<br>
liposome-seek out an antigen on the heart corresponding to the kind of antigen used<br>
to produce the antibody. Protease inhibitor might function as a permeation enhancer,<br>
by altering the physical characteristics of a liposome or of the nasal membrane in<br>
order to facilitate the passage of an active substance through the nasal membrane.<br>
Permeation enhancers are present in the nasal gel in a concentration in the range of<br>
0.000001% to 5.0%.<br>
As used herein, the matrix includes the liquid (i.e., water, oil, alcohol, etc.)<br>
and the thickener (carrageenan, sugar, guar gum, etc.)<br>
Zinc in the nasal cavity acts as a decongestant, enhancing the discharge of<br>
mucous and inhibiting the generation of new mucous. Menthol is also a decongestant<br>
and can be incorporated in the composition of the invention in a concentration of<br>
0.000001% to 0.10% by weight. Menthol is a bronchial dilator, functioning to open<br>
air passages in the lungs and to help discharge mucous.<br>
When the zinc gel of the invention is applied to the nasal cavity, zinc ions<br>
diffuse from the gel matrix into the mucous or mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.<br>
It is believed that the zinc concentration in the mucous or mucous membrane creates<br>
a barrier which inhibits viral infection of the nasal epithelial membrane. As ionic<br>
zinc is absorbed from the gel into the mucous membrane and other nasal epithelial<br>
cells, the gel matrix permits new zinc to diffuse into the nasal membrane. The gel<br>
matrix has micelle cell-like properties which facilitate the diffusion of zinc through<br>
the gel matrix.<br>
The homeopathic concentration of zinc ions in the zinc gel of the invention is<br>
4 millimolar (mM) to 60 millimolar, preferably 20 mM to 44 mM. Concentrations<br>
of zinc in excess of 44 mM are not preferred unless an antioxidant or other<br>
component is included in the gel composition to protect the nasal epithelial membrane<br>
from abnormally high concentrations of zinc. Examples of antioxidants include<br>
ascorbic acid and SOD. The concentration of an antioxidant in the gel composition<br>
of the invention is in the range of 0.000001 % to 5.0%.<br>
The liquid component(s) in the carrier can be water, an oil(s), and/or an<br>
alcohol(s). The liquid component can from from 0% to 100% water, from 0% to<br>
100% oil, or from 0% to 100% alcohol. Examples of oils are polyunsaturated oils,<br>
monosaturated oils like omega 3 and omega 6, and DHA. An example of an alcohol<br>
is ethanol.<br>
Utilizing a oil, either alone or in combination with water and/or alcohol, can<br>
be desirable when the active substance is fat soluble. An example of a fat soluble<br>
active is vitamin A. Fat soluble actives typically are included in the nasal gel<br>
composition of the invention in a concentration in the range of 0.000001 % to 4%<br>
weight percent.<br>
Emulsifiers can be included in the nasal gel composition of the invention,<br>
especially when the carrier includes water and oil. Glycerol is an example of an<br>
emulsifier because it helps to combine oil with water and to protect the membrane by<br>
moisturizing it. The concentration of emulsifiers in the nasal gel composition is<br>
presently preferably in the range of 0.000001% to 5.0%.<br>
Proteins, polypeptides, nucleic acids, and amino acids are additional examples<br>
of potential active substances for the nasal gel composition of the invention. A<br>
polypeptide is not a protein but is a polyamide that is obtained by the partial<br>
hydrolysis of proteins or by synthesis. A polypeptide yeilds amino acids on<br>
hydrolysis but has a lower molecular weight than a protein. The nasal membrane<br>
does not, in general, like proteins and tends to prevent proteins and polypeptides,<br>
even the smallest polypeptides, from passing into and through the nasal membrane.<br>
The nasal membrane can also tend to prevent the passage of amino acids; however, in<br>
some cases the nasal membrane does not prevent the passage of amino acids because<br>
there are transporters in the nasal membrane for certain amino acids. Often times<br>
enzymes are polypeptides. Hormones like insulin, growth hormones, and secretin<br>
are polypeptides. Insulin is a polypeptide.<br>
Enzymes like protease inhibitors can function as permeation enhancers<br>
because they facilitate passage of the actives through the nasal membrane.<br>
Hydroxycellulose or other thickeners or components can, if desired, be<br>
utilized to form colloidal solutions (i.e., suspensions) in order to increase the<br>
viscosity of the carrier in the nasal gel composition. The presently preferred<br>
concentration for thickeners is 0.000001% to 5.0% by weight.<br>
Permeation enhancers can, by enlarging or loosening tight junctions between<br>
cells in the nasal membrane, facilitate the passage of an active substance, of a<br>
liposome, or of another permeation enhancer through the nasal membrane. By way<br>
of example, and not limitation, EDTA can chelate calcium. By taking calcium out of<br>
the cell junctions, EDTA may loosen up the junctions to facilitate passage of an<br>
active substance, liposome, etc. through the junction. Liquid permeation enhancers<br>
include ascorbic acid in water, glycerol in water, chitosan in water, and<br>
lysophosphotidylcholin in oil. The concentration of permeation enhancers in the<br>
nasal gel is in the range of 0.00001% to 5.0%<br>
Other antioxidants which can be utilized in the gel of the invention include<br>
green tea catechin, epigallate, and selenium. The presently preferred concentration<br>
range for an antioxidant in the gel composition is from 0.000001% to 5.0%.<br>
Varying the rate of diffusion of an active substance through the carrier. the<br>
nasal epithelial mucous membrane, or through mucous in the nose is important in the<br>
practice of the invention.<br>
In order to increase the rate of diffusion of an active substance through the<br>
nasal membrane, the concentration of a permeation enhancer like vitamin C or a<br>
liposome can be increased. Permeations enhancers like vitamin C or liposomes can<br>
be included in the nasal gel at concentrations in the range of 0.000001 % to 5.0% by<br>
weight. Making the nasal gel less viscous is another way of increasing the diffusion<br>
of an active substance through the nasal membrane. Normally an active substance or<br>
a permeation enhancer carrying the active substance can move more freely through<br>
the nasal gel when the gel is less viscous.<br>
Similarly, the rate of diffusion of an active substance through the nasal gel<br>
itself can be increased by decreasing the viscosity of the nasal gel or by using a<br>
liposome or other chemical component which facilitates the diffusion of an active<br>
substance through the nasal gel either by carrying the active substance or by<br>
interacting with the nasal gel to facilitate the passage and diffusion of the active<br>
substance through the nasal gel. The diffusion rate of an active substance through the<br>
nasal gel itself is important when the concentration of the active substance in the gel<br>
becomes less near or at the gel—nasal membrane interface. When the concentration<br>
in the gel of the active substance near or at the gel-nasal membrane interface becomes<br>
less than the concentration of the active substance in the remainder of the gel, it is<br>
desirable that the active substance readily diffuse through the gel to replenish the<br>
concentration of the active substance at or near the gel-nasal membrane interface.<br>
The concentration of the active substance at or near the gel-nasal membrane<br>
interface becomes less when the active substance is absorbed from the gel into the<br>
nasal membrane. Liposomes or other chemical components can be included in nasal<br>
gel at concentrations in the range of 0.000001% to 5.0% by weight.<br>
The rate of diffusion of an active substance through mucous in the nasal<br>
passage can be increased by using in the gel composition an agent like zinc or salt<br>
which facilitate the breakup and drying of mucous in the nose or by using in the gel<br>
composition a component which actually facilitates travel of an active substance<br>
through mucous. Mucous is a protein and has different properties than the nasal<br>
epithelial membrane. Agents like zinc or salt can be included in the nasal gel in<br>
concentrations in the range of 0.000001% to 5% by weight.<br>
Another method of facilitating the diffusion of an active substance into the<br>
nasal membrane is to spread the nasal gel over a larger surface area of the nasal<br>
membrane. One way this is facilitated is by enhancing the action of the cilia which<br>
tend to beat or carry mucous or foreign substances in the nose toward the back of the<br>
throat. Chemical components like lysozyme can be included in the nasal gel in<br>
concentrations in the range of 0.00001% to 5.0% by weight to increase the action of<br>
cilia and to therefore increase the rate at which the gel composition is, after being<br>
inserted in a patient"s nose, carried rearwardly from the nose down through the nasal<br>
passage into the back of the patient"s throat. Increasing the action of the cilia<br>
functions to increase the rate at which the nasal gel coats a greater surface area in the<br>
nasal passage. As used herein, the nasal passage begins inside the nose at a point<br>
about one-quarter of an inch to one-half from the opening in each nostril and extends<br>
to the back of a patient"s throat. The nasal passage includes portions of each nostril<br>
of a patient"s nose.<br>
Absorption of an active substance in the gel of the invention in the lungs or<br>
nasal membrane can be facilitated by sublimation. For example, camphor or iodine<br>
can be admixed with the nasal gel of the invention at some time prior to inserting the<br>
gel in a patient"s nose. The concentration of a sublimating active substance can vary<br>
as desired, but typically is in the range of 0.00001% to 5.0% by weight.<br>
In the nasal gel, it is sometime important to keep an active substance like zinc<br>
in its ionized state. One way of increasing the likelihood that an active substance will<br>
remain in its ionized state is by increasing the viscosity of the nasal gel. Still a<br>
further way of increasing the likelihood that an active substance will remain in its<br>
ionized state is by using a thickener which will not bind with the active substance<br>
when the active substance in an ionize state. For example, carbopol does bind with<br>
zinc and generally is therefore not a preferred thickener in gel compositions in which<br>
it is desired to maintain zinc in its ionized state. Most thickeners do not bind with<br>
zinc ions. Ascorbic acid also binds with zinc. Therefore ascorbic acid ordinarily is<br>
not utilized in combination with a gel composition including ionic zinc as an active<br>
substance. Glycerine functions to help maintain zinc and other components in their<br>
ionic state.<br>
When the nasal gel includes zinc ions and is being utilized to treat rhinovirus,<br>
it is important to use the gel in both nostrils of the patient"s nose. In other<br>
circumstances, for example delivering a vitamin into the patient"s bloodstream, it is<br>
not necessary that the gel be placed in both nostrils. Use of only one nostril may be<br>
sufficient.<br>
It may be desirable to utilize a nasal gel composition which thickens when<br>
placed in the nostril of a patient. Utilizing a component which is temperature<br>
sensitive and thickens due to the increased temperature in a patient"s nose is one<br>
avenue of producing an increased viscosity when the nasal gel is applied in the<br>
patient"s nose. Another avenue is to admix two or more components just prior to<br>
applying the nasal gel in the patient"s nose. The two components produce a<br>
composition having a viscosity greater than either component separately.<br>
The nasal gel of the invention can be packaged in a capsule or other container<br>
which dissolves on being inserted in the nose. When the container dissolves, the gel<br>
contacts the nasal membrane. The capsule can be fabricated from gelatin, from a soft<br>
pliable paper-like water soluble material, or from any other desired material that<br>
dissolves or disintegrates or otherwise degrades when placed in the nasal cavity.<br>

the gel contacts at least a portion of the nasal epithelial membrane. A second portion<br>
of the gel contacts at least a portion of the mucous in the patient"s nose. A third<br>

EXAMPLE 19<br>
One hundred and fifty microliters of the gel of Example 18 is placed in one<br>
nasal passage of a healthy fifty year old female African American patient.<br>
Consequently, a total of 150 microliters of the gel is placed in the patient"s nose. A<br>
first portion of the gel contacts at least a portion of the nasal epithelial membrane. A<br>
second portion of the gel contacts at least a portion of the mucous in the patient"s<br>
nose. A third portion of the gel contacts at least cilia in the patient"s nose. The gel<br>
remains in contact with at least a portion of the nasal epithelial membrane, the cilia,<br>
or mucous on the membrane. After three hours the zinc gel has completely<br>
dissipated.<br>
EXAMPLE 20<br>

PURIFIED WATER 94.75<br>
GLYCERIN U.S.P. 2.0<br>
CARBOPOL 940 nf 0.5<br>
ZINC GLUCONATE (source of ionic zinc) 2.25 (50 millimolar<br>
concentration) *<br>
SOD (antioxidant) 0.5<br>
* The molecular weight of zinc gluconate, about 450 g/mole, multiplied times<br>
0.05 moles per liter of zinc gluconate gives a weight of about 22.5<br>
grams per liter of the gel composition.<br>
The SOD antioxidant functions to protect the nasal epithelial membrane from damage<br>
due to the high concentrations of zinc ion in the nasal gel.<br>
EXAMPLE 21<br>
Examples 2 to 7 are repeated utilizing the gel composition of Example 20 in<br>
place of the gel composition of Example 1. Similar results are obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 22<br>
Example 7 is repeated except the patient has a layer of mucous about one-<br>
sixteenth of an inch thick covering the nasal mucosa. Similar results are obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 23<br>
Example 22 is repeated except that the gel composition of Example 1 also<br>
includes 1.0% by weight NaCl and that the weight percent of the purified water in<br>
the gel composition is 96% instead of 97%. The weight percent of glycerin,<br>
carbopol, and zinc gluconate in the gel composition of Example 1 remain the same.<br>
The salt is included in the gel composition in order to facilitate the diffusion of zinc<br>
through the layer of mucous.<br>
The results obtained in this Example 23 are similar to those in Example 22,<br>
except that zinc concentration in the nasal mucosa increases more rapidly in Example<br>
23 because the salt facilitates drying and dissipation of the layer of mucous.<br>
EXAMPLE 24<br>
Example 7 is repeated except that the gel composition of Example 1 is<br>
inserted in the nasal passage in the nose and, instead of measuring the concentration<br>
of zinc in the nasal mucosa just prior to administration of the zinc gel, ten minutes<br>
after administration of the zinc gel, one-half hour after administration of the zinc gel,<br>
etc., the distance the zinc gel has been carried back into the nasal cavity by cilia in ;.<br>
the nasal cavity after ten minutes, one-half hour, etc. is measured.<br>
EXAMPLE 25<br>
Example 24 is repeated except that the gel composition of Example 1 also<br>
includes 0.5% by weight lysozyme and that the weight percent of the purified water<br>
is 96.5% instead of 97%. The weight percent of glycerin, carbopol, and zinc<br>
gluconate in the gel composition of Example 1 remain the same. The lysozyme<br>
included in the gel composition increases the activity of cilia in the nose and, as a<br>
result, increases the rate at which cilia carry zinc gel from inside the nose back<br>
through the nasal cavity toward the back of the patient"s throat. The results obtained<br>
in Example 25 are similar to those obtained in Example 24. except in Example 25 the<br>
cilia more rapidly carry zinc gel toward the back of the patient"s throat.<br>
EXAMPLE 26<br>
The gel composition of Example 1 is placed against a surface which removes<br>
zinc from the gel at the gel --surface interface at a selected rate. The rate of diffusion<br>
of zinc from a selected point (the point being a selected distance from the interface)<br>
to the interface is measured.<br>
EXAMPLE 27<br>
Example 26 is repeated, except the viscosity of the gel composition of<br>
Example 1 is reduced by reducing the concentration of carbopol to 0.25 weight<br>
percent and reciprocally increasing the concentration of purified water to 97.25%.<br>
The concentration of glycerin and zinc gluconate remain the same. The results<br>
obtained are similar, except that the rate of diffusion of zinc ions is greater in this<br>
Example 27 than in Example 26 because of the reduced viscosity of the gel<br>
composition.<br>
EXAMPLE 28<br>
Example 15 is repeated, except that concentration of insulin in the nasal<br>
membrane is measured at 10, 20 and 30 minutes.<br>
EXAMPLE 29<br>
Example 28 is repeated, except that the liposomes are removed from the gel<br>
composition of Example 14 and the concentration of purified water is reciprocally <br>
increased to 97% by weight. The liposomes are permeation enhancers which are<br>
added to enhance the ability of the insulin to permeate the nasal epithelial membrane.<br>
The concentration of glycerin, carbopol, and insulin in the gel composition of<br>
Example 14 remain the same. The results obtained in this Example 29 are different<br>
from those obtained in Example 28, because the concentration of insulin in the nasal<br>
mucosa rise more slowly because the liposome permeation enhancers are no longer<br>
present in the gel composition.<br>
