				<td>[Field of the invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a method of controlling the flow of an amount of data<br>
from a sending peer to a receiving peer of a given communication protocol.<br>
[Background of the invention]<br>
In the field of communications, data transmission techniques are known where an amount<br>
of data to be transmitted is divided into a plurality of data segments, the data segments<br>
being ordered in a sequence. These data segments are then transmitted in the order of said<br>
sequence.<br>
This procedure occurs at a so-called sending peer of a communication governed by a<br>
predetermined protocol that contains the rules for handling such data segments. The<br>
receiving entity associated with the predetermined protocol is referred to as the receiving<br>
peer. The concepts of protocols, protocol hierarchies, layering, and protocol peers is well<br>
known in the art, see for example "TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 1, The Protocols" by W.<br>
Richard Stevens, Addison Wesley 1994. The well known Transmission Control Protocol<br>
(TCP) from the TCP/IP protocols suite is an example of such a protocol that arranges data<br>
to be sent into a sequence of segments.<br>
Typically, in order to be sent, the individual segments will be placed into data units having<br>
a structure defined by the given protocol. These data units may have different names in the<br>
context of different protocols, such as packets, frames, protocol data units, cells, etc. In the<br>
present description the term "data unit" shall be used generically to cover any such defined<br>
data structure. The present specification shall use the terms "segment" and "data unit"<br>
interchangeably.<br>
The sending peer will hand the data unit downwards to a lower layer, e.g. a TCP sending<br>
peer will hand a TCP segments via the IP layer to a link layer, and on the receiving side<br>
the receiving peer shall receive data units from the lower layers. The predetermined<br>
structure defining the data units, e.g. defining a beginning and an end, allows the receiving<br>
peer to identify individual segments.<br>
It may be noted that in accordance with the OSI layering concept, it does not matter how<br>
the data units passed to a lower layer are processed and transported there. Namely, the<br>
2<br><br>
given sending peer passes a stream of bits downward and the receiving peer receives a<br>
stream of bits, where this stream of bits contains certain identifying elements, such as<br>
frame boundary indicators, with the help of which the receiving peer can identify<br>
individual data units and individual segments.<br>
In order to ensure the reliable transmission of data, many protocols provide the feature of<br>
data unit retransmission, which means that segments from the sequence can be<br>
retransmitted if necessary. Typically this will be done with the help of an<br>
acknowledgement technique, which means that the correct receipt of a data unit by the<br>
receiving peer is acknowledged with an appropriate acknowledgement message that the<br>
receiving peer sends back to the sending peer. Once the sending peer has received such an<br>
acknowledgment message, it can appropriately continue sending further data units, or if no<br>
acknowledgement or a non-acknowledgement message is received, the data unit that was<br>
not correctly received by the receiving peer can be retransmitted by the sending peer.<br>
Several mechanisms are known with the help of which a sending peer is supposed to<br>
obtain an indication that the loss of a data unit or segment has occurred, such that an<br>
appropriate retransmission can take place. One such known feature is retransmission time-<br>
out, which means that after sending a data unit, a timer is monitored, and if a<br>
predetermined amount of time passes without having received an acknowledgement for<br>
the given data unit, then it is assumed that the data unit has been lost and it is accordingly<br>
retransmitted.<br>
Another such mechanism is that of counting duplicate acknowledgements. A duplicate<br>
acknowledgement is an acknowledgement that identifies as the last correctly received data<br>
segment a data segment that has already been acknowledged previously. Namely, many<br>
protocols, such as e.g. TCP, have an acknowledgement generating mechanism for<br>
receiving peers that operates to send out an acknowledgement message for each correctly<br>
received segment of the sequence, where the acknowledgement identifies the last correctly<br>
received data segment in the order of sequence. In other words, if for example the first to<br>
fourth data segments have been received and acknowledged, and then the fifth data<br>
segment arrives, the receiving peer will send out an acknowledgement for that fifth<br>
segment. If thereafter the seventh and eight segments correctly arrive, then the receiving<br>
peer will again send out one or two acknowledgement messages, but these<br>
acknowledgement messages will only identify the fifth segment, because the fifth was the<br>
last segment that was correctly received in the order of the sequence. Namely, the<br>
3<br><br>
receiving peer is expecting the sixth segment, and even if it correctly receives segments<br>
above the sixth segment, it will continue to acknowledge the fifth segment. Consequently,<br>
the receipt of duplicate acknowledgements by the sending peer gives the sending peer an<br>
indication that a data unit has been lost.<br>
As a consequence, in protocols that use the above described acknowledgement mechanism<br>
according to which acknowledgement messages only acknowledge the last data unit that<br>
was correctly received in the order of the sequence, even if data units are received that lie<br>
further on in said sequence, a retransmission mechanism may be implemented that<br>
performs a retransmission if a predetermined number of duplicate acknowledgements is<br>
received by the sending peer. In TCP, the corresponding mechanism is known as "fast<br>
retransmit", where a retransmission is enacted after the receipt of three duplicate<br>
acknowledgements. A detailed description of the fast retransmit mechanism in TCP can<br>
e.g. be found in the above mentioned book by Stevens, chapter 21.7.<br>
[Problem underlying the invention]<br>
All such mechanisms as described above for receiving an indication that a data unit has<br>
been lost, suffer from the problem that the sending peer only receives an indirect<br>
indication that a data unit was lost, and in fact the occurrence of the predetermined<br>
triggering event (a time-out or a predetermined number of duplicate acknowledgements)<br>
does not necessarily mean that a data unit was really lost. These triggering events can also<br>
be caused spuriously, e.g. if a data unit is delayed in the transmission network, while data<br>
units associated with segments further on in the sequence are delivered by the network.<br>
Such a phenomenon is also referred to as reordering.<br>
[Object of the present invention]<br>
It is the object of the present invention to generally improve the possibilities for handling<br>
the retransmission of segments in a sending peer.<br>
[Summary of the invention]<br>
This object of the invention is solved by a method of controlling the flow of a sequence of<br>
data segments from a sending peer to a receiving peer, comprising transmitting data<br>
segments from the sending peer to the receiving peer in the order of the sequence;<br>
4<br><br>
receiving acknowledgement messages from the receiving peer, wherein an<br>
acknowledgement message indicates the correct receipt of a data segment in the proper<br>
order of the sequence; receiving a duplicate acknowledgement message from the receiving<br>
peer at the sending peer, if a data segment was received but not in the proper order of the<br>
sequence, the duplicate acknowledgement message being received in association with the<br>
last correctly received packet in the order of the sequence of data segments; deciding that a<br>
data segment was lost, which was sent but not acknowledged, if the number of duplicate<br>
acknowledgement messages received by the sending peer reaches a duplicate<br>
acknowledgement message threshold determined based on the size of a receive window,<br>
the size of the receive window corresponding to a number of data segments which can be<br>
stored in a buffer space at the receiving peer; and retransmitting the data segment<br>
determined to be lost.<br>
Accordingly, the sending peer can set the duplicate acknowledgement message threshold<br>
by considering the situation at the receiving peer.<br>
According to another embodiment, the duplicate acknowledgement threshold is set such<br>
that the data segment determined to be lost is retransmitted before a point in time in the<br>
sequence of data segments selected such that the acknowledgement message indicating<br>
proper receipt of the data segment determined to be lost, i.e. the retransmitted data<br>
segment, is expected to be received at the sending peer before transmitting the data<br>
segment with a sequence number exceeding the sequence number of the data segment<br>
determined to be lost by the size of the receive window. Accordingly, the threshold can<br>
always be maintained on a value with optimum utilization of the resources at the receiving<br>
peer.<br>
According to another embodiment, the duplicate acknowledgement message threshold is<br>
determined on the basis of a size of a usable window constituted by the difference between<br>
the size of the receive window and a flight size, the flight size representing the number of<br>
transmitted data segments which have not yet been acknowledged.<br>
Still further, the duplicate acknowledgement message threshold may be determined based<br>
on the difference between the size of the usable window and the flight size.<br>
5<br><br>
According to another embodiment, the duplicate acknowledgement message threshold is<br>
determined one instant in time prior to receiving the first duplication message as the larger<br>
value of the value 1 and the value obtained by calculating<br>
(size of receive window - (k x flight size)),<br>
wherein k is a float. Advantageously, k = 2.<br>
Still further, the duplicate acknowledgement message threshold may be determined as<br>
size of the receive window - (2 x flight size) + N,<br>
with N constituting a tuning parameter satisfying the condition<br>
(2 x flight size) - size of receive window + 1 
According to another embodiment, the duplicate acknowledgement message threshold is<br>
updated upon determining a change in the size of the receive window.<br>
Alternatively, the duplicate acknowledgement threshold may be updated at least each first<br>
time a duplicate acknowledgement message for one of the data segments is received. In<br>
this case the tuning parameter N may preferably be set to 5.<br>
In another alternative, the duplicate acknowledgement message threshold is updated each<br>
time an acknowledgement message is received.<br>
According to another embodiment, the data segment determined to be lost is retransmitted,<br>
if the sending peer is blocked from transmitting a previously unsent data segment.<br>
In this embodiment, the sending peer is considered blocked, if one of the following<br>
conditions is fulfilled: the number of previously unsent data segments exceeds the size of<br>
the receive window; the number of previously unsent data segments exceeds the size of<br>
the send window; or an application constituting the source of the data segments does not<br>
supply data segments for transmission.<br>
6<br><br>
A computer program may be arranged to perform at least one of the above operations<br>
when executed on a computer.<br>
A computer readable memory device may store the computer program.<br>
Still further, the object of the invention is solved by a communication device controlling<br>
the flow of a sequence of data segments from a sending peer to a receiving peer,<br>
comprising means for transmitting data segments from the sending peer to the receiving<br>
peer in the order of the sequence, means for receiving acknowledgment messages from the<br>
receiving peer, where an acknowledgment message indicates the correct receipt of a data<br>
segment in the proper order of the sequence, means for receiving a duplicate<br>
acknowledgement message from the receiving peer at the sending peer, if a data segment<br>
was received but not in the proper order of the sequence, the duplicate acknowledgement<br>
message being received in association with the last correctly received packet in the order<br>
of the sequence of data segments, means for deciding that a data segment was lost, which<br>
was sent but not acknowledged, if the number of duplicate acknowledgement messages<br>
reaches a duplicate acknowledgement threshold determined based on the size of a receive<br>
window, the size of the receive window corresponding to a number of data segments<br>
which can be stored in a buffer space at the receiving peer; and means for retransmitting<br>
the data segment determined to be lost.<br>

[Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments]<br>
The present invention is applicable to any implementation of a given communication<br>
protocol to which an amount of data that is to be sent is divided into a plurality of data<br>
segments, and said data segments are ordered in a sequence, where the data segments are<br>
sent from the sending peer to the receiving peer in the order of said sequence, where a<br>
receiving peer sends acknowledgements to the sending peer, said acknowledgements<br>
indicating the correct receipt in the proper order of the sequence, such that an<br>
acknowledgement message indicates the last correctly received data segment of said<br>
sequence that was received in the proper order of the sequence, and where if the sending<br>
peer receives a threshold number of acknowledgement messages that each identify the<br>
same data segment as the last correctly received data segment of the segment that was<br>
received in the proper order, the segment that immediately follows the segment for which<br>
duplicate acknowledgements were received is retransmitted.<br>
An example of such a protocol is TCP. However, it is explicitly noted that the invention is<br>
also applicable to any other communication protocol that has the above described<br>
characteristics as far as they are relevant for implementing the inventive concept.<br>
According to the present invention, the threshold number of acknowledgement messages,<br>
i.e. the duplicate acknowledgement threshold is a parameter determined based on the size<br>
of a receive window, the size of the receive window representing a number of data<br>
segments which can be stored in a buffer space at the receiving peer.<br>
8<br><br>
As already mentioned previously, therefore, the duplicate acknowledgement threshold is a<br>
parameter that is associated with the sending peer's decision on how long to wait until a<br>
given segment for which duplicate acknowledgements are being received is assumed to<br>
have been lost. Due to the solution of the present invention, according to which the<br>
threshold is adapted, it is possible to make this decision itself adaptive and thereby more<br>
flexible.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates operations for controlling a flow of data segments between a sending peer<br>
and a receiving peer (not shown) according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
In a first operation 101 the sending peer is considered to carry out a normal routine of<br>
transmitting data segments to a receiving peer in a certain given sequence. For example,<br>
the data segments are numbered consecutively such as 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06,... and<br>
scheduled for transmission at the sending peer in the order of the sequential numbering.<br>
The sequential numbering may suitably correspond to the output of data segments of a<br>
data source, e.g. as known in the art. It is understood that the data segments may carry any<br>
kind of payload data, i.e. data relating to any kind of application or format, such as voice<br>
data, data exchange between computing device in a communication session, video data,<br>
audio data and similar.<br>
The receiving peer (not shown in Fig. 1) receives the data segments and acknowledges the<br>
receipt of the data segments with an acknowledgement message returned to the sending<br>
peer. These acknowledgement messages from the receiving peer are received at the<br>
sending peer in an operation 102. If operation is normal and data segments transmitted in a<br>
sequence are received in the same sequence at the receiving peer, each data packet is<br>
acknowledged with an acknowledgement message and the sending peer knows that the<br>
data segments are received in the proper order of the sequence. The data segments which<br>
have been transmitted from the sending peer and properly acknowledged, can be<br>
discarded, e.g. removed from a transmit buffer at the sending peer, as it a retransmission of<br>
the transmitted data segments will not be required.<br>
Generally, each correctly received data segment, i.e. error free and in the order of the<br>
sequence, triggers an acknowledgement message at the receiving peer, which is returned<br>
to the sending peer. If after a correctly received data segment a data segment is received<br>
which is not in the order of the sequence, i.e. a delay or fault in transmitting a data<br>
segment occurred, then the acknowledgement message for the last correctly received data<br>
9<br><br>
segment is repeated, and this repeated acknowledgement message is termed duplicate<br>
acknowledgement message.<br>
In the above example, if for one reason or the other a data segment is not received in the<br>
proper order of the transmitting sequence, e.g. if data segment 05 is received after<br>
segments 01, 02, 03 but before data segment 04, the receiving peer thus does not return an<br>
acknowledgement message to the sending peer. Instead, the receiving peer transmits a<br>
duplicate acknowledgement message to the sending peer, indicating that a data segment<br>
was received, but not in the order of the sequence. The duplicate acknowledgement<br>
message is associated with the last correctly received packet in the order of the sequence<br>
of data segments. The duplicate acknowledgement message in the above example of<br>
receiving data segment 05 before data segment 04 will indicate that the last data segment<br>
which was correctly received in the order of the sequence was data segment 03.<br>
The duplicate acknowledgement message received at the sending peer in an operation 103<br>
consequently notifies the sending peer that a retransmission of the packet following the<br>
last correctly received packet may be required, in case it turns out or is determined that<br>
this data packet was actually lost during the transmission path from the sending peer to the<br>
receiving peer. Hence, the sending peer may not discard all those data packets from the<br>
sending buffer, which were transmitted after the last correctly received data packet<br>
indicated by the duplicate acknowledgement message received in operation 103.<br>
However, the sending peer continuous to transmit data segments to the receiving peer, and<br>
thus, presuming that the data segment 04 of the above example is still not received at the<br>
receiving peer for a longer period of time, the receiving peer continues to transmit<br>
duplicate acknowledgement messages for each received data segment. Accordingly, the<br>
sending peer receives an increasing number of duplicate acknowledgement messages, and<br>
with each duplicate acknowledgement message the probability that the unacknowledged<br>
data segment was actually lost, increases.<br>
In an operation 104 the sending peer now decides whether the number of duplicate<br>
acknowledgement messages reaches or exceeds an appropriately set (as will be described<br>
later) duplicate acknowledgement message threshold set at the sending peer. If in<br>
operation 104 the decision is "NO", indicating that the duplicate acknowledgement<br>
message threshold is not yet been reached, the flow of operation returns to operation 101,<br>
i.e., the sending peer continues to transmit data segments in the order of the sequence.<br>
10<br><br>
However, if in operation 104 the decision is "YES", indicating that the duplicate<br>
acknowledgement message threshold is reached or exceeded, in an operation 105 the<br>
sending peer decides that the data segment was lost, which was sent but not<br>
acknowledged. Continuing with the above example, with the duplicate acknowledgement<br>
messages indicating that the last correctly received data segment in the order of the<br>
sequence was data segment 3, the sending peer will decide that the data segment 4 was<br>
actually lost.<br>
In an operation 106 the data segment determined to be lost, i.e. in the example data<br>
segment 04, is retransmitted. The retransmission may for example be carried out by a fast<br>
retransmit according to the TCP protocol.<br>
Of course, it is of highest importance to suitably set the duplicate acknowledgement<br>
message threshold keeping in mind that a to early retransmission of data packets causes<br>
unnecessary traffic, and that a refraining from retransmitting a data segment for too long<br>
may cause a blocking of further transmissions, as all data segments which have been<br>
transmitted but not acknowledged must be kept in the buffers of the sending peer receiving<br>
peer.<br>
Most importantly, for superior flow control, the duplicate acknowledgement message<br>
threshold can be set under consideration of the size of a receive window at the receiving<br>
peer, the size of the receive window constituting the number of data segments which can<br>
be stored in a buffer space at the receiving peer. This size of the receive window may be<br>
reported by the receiving peer for example with the acknowledgement messages, such that<br>
the sending peer is always aware of the present size of the receive window.<br>
More precisely, the threshold should be set such that a transmission of data segments at no<br>
point in time is prohibited due to reaching at the sending peer the maximum allowed<br>
transmitted but not acknowledged data segments, this maximum number being equal to the<br>
size of the receive window. Note that according to a sliding window protocol a data<br>
segment from the sending peer according to a communication protocol may only be<br>
scheduled for transmission, if the difference in sequence numbers of the oldest<br>
acknowledged data segment and the next data segment for transmission does not exceed<br>
the size of the receive window.<br>
11<br><br>
The above illustrated an embodiment where the calculation of the duplicate<br>
acknowledgement threshold uses the size of the receive window. It is noted that, even<br>
though not further described here, the duplicate acknowledgement threshold may in<br>
addition thereto be further adapted based on the situation at the sending peer, e.g. a size of<br>
a window at the sending peer to further improve the setting of the duplicate<br>
acknowledgement threshold.<br>
In the following a further embodiment of the invention will be described with regard to<br>
Fig. 2. Fig. 2 illustrates operations for suitably setting the duplicate acknowledgement<br>
message threshold.<br>
As noted above, the threshold is suitably to be selected such that a buffer overflow at the<br>
receiving peer can surely be avoided and that further a stalling of a transmission of data<br>
segments from the sending peer can surely be avoided. A stalling or blocking of a<br>
transmission at the sending peer can occur if the number of sent but unacknowledged data<br>
segments is about to exceed the sized of the receive window.<br>
To meet these conditions, it must always be assured that the number of data segments<br>
which have been transmitted after and including the oldest unacknowledged data segment<br>
does not exceed the size of the receive window at the receiving peer.<br>
Accordingly, if a data segment has not been acknowledged, a retransmission of this data<br>
segment is to be scheduled at a point in time that still allows an acknowledgement of<br>
proper receipt of the retransmission of this data segment to reach the sending peer before a<br>
data segment with a sequence number is scheduled for transmission which would<br>
potentially lead to an overflow of the receiver buffer if no proper acknowledgement of the<br>
retransmitted data segment were received.<br>
In other words, the retransmission of the unacknowledged data segment needs to be<br>
performed such that an acknowledgement pertaining to this retransmission is expected to<br>
be received at the sending peer before the transmitted number of data segments since and<br>
including the unacknowledged data segment exceeds the size of the receive window. If<br>
this condition were not met, the sending peer would not be allowed to transmit further data<br>
packets, and the connection would stall.<br>
12<br><br>
In Fig. 2, in an operation 201, it is decided whether the duplicate acknowledgement<br>
message threshold should be updated according to conditions to be described later. If the<br>
decision is "YES", in operation 202, in accordance with the above said, the duplicate<br>
acknowledgement message threshold is set such that the data segment determined to be<br>
lost is retransmitted at or before a point in time in the sequence of data segments selected<br>
such that the acknowledgement message indicating proper receipt of the data segment<br>
determined to be lost is expected to be received at the sending peer before the data<br>
segment with a sequence number exceeding the sequence number of the data segment<br>
determined to be lost by the size of the receive window is scheduled for transmission.<br>
Accordingly, it can be avoided that the sending peer is barred from transmitting further<br>
data segments.<br>
In this case a window stalling in the data transmission can be avoided and further, an<br>
overflow of the receive buffer can be avoided.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a flow chart that describes an embodiment of the present invention. The left<br>
hand side of the flow chart relates to general flow control, and due to the fact that the<br>
present invention is not concerned with the general type of flow control, e.g. as provided<br>
by TCP or any other flow control protocol, this part is only shown schematically as a<br>
dashed line. The right hand side of the Fig. discloses a procedure for handling duplicate<br>
acknowledgements. Namely, if in the course of the general flow control an<br>
acknowledgement (ACK) is received, see operation 301 then the procedure for handling<br>
duplicate acknowledgements is triggered.<br>
In operation 302 it is determined if the acknowledgement is a duplicate acknowledgement.<br>
Namely, the number of times N that the specific acknowledgement, which identifies the<br>
last correctly received data segment of the sequence that was received in the proper order<br>
of the sequence, is determined and it is judged if this number N is larger than 1. If not,<br>
then the ACK is not a duplicate ACK, and the procedure returns to the general flow<br>
control.<br>
If the outcome of operation 302 indicates that the acknowledgement is a duplicate<br>
acknowledgement, the procedure goes to operation 303, where it is determined if N(ACK)<br>
reached the duplicate acknowledgement threshold Th. Depending on the implementation,<br>
the duplicate acknowledgement threshold may be considered to be reached if N(ACK) is<br>
equal to the duplicate acknowledgement threshold. Alternatively, the duplicate<br>
13<br><br>
acknowledgement threshold may be considered to be reached if N(ACK) is larger than the<br>
duplicate acknowledgement threshold.<br>
This operation can be implemented in any appropriate way, for example by simply<br>
keeping a record of the last acknowledged segment and setting an associated counter, such<br>
that if a newly received acknowledgment is identical to the previous acknowledgement<br>
(i.e. a duplicate acknowledgement) the counter is incremented by one, and if the new<br>
acknowledgement identifies a segment that is subsequent to the segment identified in the<br>
last received acknowledgement, then the counter is reset to 1.<br>
In the example of Fig. 3, N(ACK) indicates the number of times that the sending peer has<br>
received the given acknowledgement ACK. In other words, N = 1 means that the<br>
acknowledgement for a given segment has been received the first time, and a number N &gt;<br>
1 indicates that it is a duplicate acknowledgement.<br>
If operation 303 determines that the number of acknowledgments has reached the<br>
threshold, then the oldest unacknowledged segment is retransmitted in operation 305. The<br>
oldest unacknowledged segment then immediately follows the segment identified in the<br>
duplicate acknowledgments. On the other hand, if the outcome of operation 303 is<br>
negative, the flow proceeds to operation 304 to also consider the situation at the sending<br>
peer.<br>
In operation 304 it is determined whether the sending peer is blocked from transmitting<br>
data segments due to a condition arising at the sending peer. Blocked in this connection<br>
means that the sending peer is not allowed or otherwise unable to transmit data segments<br>
to the receiving peer.<br>
According to an example, the sending peer is considered blocked, if the number of<br>
previously unsent data segments exceeds the size of the receive window. For example due<br>
to an error or an unforeseen condition the duplicate acknowledgement threshold may be<br>
selected to large and the receive window size may be reached. This situation may be<br>
termed receiver limited.<br>
According to another example, the sending peer is considered blocked, if the number of<br>
previously unsent data segments exceeds the size of the send window. For example the<br>
transmit buffer of the sending peer may be a shared memory area with a space left for<br>
14<br><br>
storing data segments reduced in size, such as below the size of the receive window. This<br>
situation may be termed sender limited.<br>
According to another example, the sending peer is considered blocked, if an application<br>
constituting the source of the data segments does not supply data segments for<br>
transmission. For example, data segments may be generated dynamically, e.g. of a web<br>
page, and the application may temporarily cease generating new data segments. Further,<br>
an application may simply presently have no further data segments for transmission. This<br>
situation may be termed application limited.<br>
If in operation 304 it is determined that the sending peer is blocked from transmitting data<br>
segments, then the oldest unacknowledged segment is retransmitted in operation 305.<br>
If in operation 304 it is determined that the sending peer is not blocked from transmitting<br>
data segments, then the next segment in the sequence following the segment that<br>
immediately follows the segment identified in the duplicate acknowledgment is<br>
transmitted in an operation 306.<br>
After operations 305 or 306, the procedure returns to the general flow control.<br>
It is noted that operation 304 may be optional and that in an alternative the flow may<br>
return, if the decision in operation 303 is "NO", to the general flow instead or proceed to<br>
operation 306 for transmitting the next data segment in the sequence.<br>
It may be noted that the embodiment of Fig. 3 is only one example, and this example can<br>
be varied in a number of ways. The skilled person will understand that the operations can<br>
also be arranged differently. Moreover, operation 306 is only an example, as the present<br>
invention is not specifically concerned with the procedure after the duplicate<br>
acknowledgment threshold is exceeded. In other words, the procedure after exceeding the<br>
duplicate acknowledgment threshold can be chosen in any appropriate or suitable way,<br>
where different possibilities for TCP-like protocols shall be discussed further on.<br>
Equally, the response in the general flow control to duplicate acknowledgments is not<br>
essential to the present invention. For example, after the negative outcome of operation<br>
303, which means that a duplicate acknowledgment has been received, but the number of<br>
15<br><br>
duplicate acknowledgments has not yet reached the threshold, the general flow control can<br>
stop sending any further segments, or can equally well continue to send further segments.<br>
The duplicate acknowledgment threshold can be set or updated in any suitable or desirable<br>
way. For example, it can be updated at regular intervals, based on one or more values used<br>
for adapting the threshold. In other words, these one or more values are regularly<br>
measured or determined, and the threshold Th is accordingly updated. This process occurs<br>
outside of what is shown in Fig. 3, in an independent procedure. Consequently, this<br>
independent procedure regularly updates the value of Th that is appropriately stored, and<br>
operations 303 and 304 simply access or call the current value of Th. On the other hand, it<br>
is also possible to update Th at the occurrence of a predetermined triggering event. One<br>
possibility can consist in updating Th only if one or more of the one or more values used<br>
to adapt Th have changed. Such a procedure would again be independent of what is shown<br>
in Fig. 3, and operations 303 and 304 would simply access or call the current value of Th.<br>
However, the specified triggering event can also be a part of the procedure shown in Fig.<br>
4. Namely, it is possible to perform an updating of Th at the occurrence of a triggering<br>
event that is associated with the receipt of acknowledgments. For example, Th can be<br>
updated at every first receipt of a duplicate ACK. This is shown in Fig. 4, where the same<br>
reference numerals as used in Fig. 3 refer to the same operations. In other words, the<br>
operations 401 and 402 shown in Fig. 4 are implemented between the operations 302 and<br>
303 as shown in Fig. 3. After operation 302 has determined that a duplicate<br>
acknowledgment has been received, operation 401 determines if the duplicate<br>
acknowledgment is the first duplicate acknowledgment, namely if N(ACK) = 2, and if this<br>
is the case, then Th is updated in operation 402. After operations 401 or 402, operation<br>
303 is performed, and all the other operations already discussed in connection with Fig. 3,<br>
such that a further discussion is not necessary.<br>
It is also possible to perform an updating of Th at every duplicate acknowledgment. This<br>
is shown in Fig. 5. Namely, the updating operation 501 follows after operation 302, such<br>
that every duplicate acknowledgment leads to an updating of Th.<br>
As another alternative, which is not shown in the figures, the threshold Th can also be<br>
updated at every acknowledgment. In other words, the updating operation would be<br>
implemented between operations 301 and 302 of Fig. 3. Another variation can consist in<br>
updating the threshold Th at every ACK that relates to outstanding data segments, i.e. only<br>
16<br><br>
for such acknowledgments where N(ACK) = 1. Consequently, the updating operation<br>
could be implemented at the negative output of operation 302 in Fig. 3.<br>
As described above, the updating of the duplicate acknowledgment threshold Th can be<br>
done whenever suitable or desirable. Equally, it can be done on any appropriate or suitable<br>
basis by taking into account the size of the receiving window at the receiving peer, as<br>
noted above.<br>
In the following a further embodiment of the invention will be described with regard to<br>
Fig. 6. Fig. 6 illustrates elements of a sending peer for controlling a flow of data segments<br>
transmitted between a sending peer and receiving peer, for example utilizing the TCP<br>
protocol or any other suitable communication protocol.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a sending peer 600, such as any kind of computing device, e.g. a desktop<br>
computer, laptop computer, mobile computing device such as PDA or mobile telephone<br>
and similar. The invention is equally applicable to wire-bound data exchange as well as<br>
wireless or at least partially wireless data transmission.<br>
The sending peer comprises transmitting/retransmitting means 601 for transmitting data<br>
segments from the sending peer to the receiving peer in the order of the sequence and for<br>
retransmitting a data segment determined to be lost, as noted with regard to previous<br>
embodiments.<br>
Further, the sending peer comprises receiving means 602, for receiving acknowledgement<br>
messages from the receiving peer, were an acknowledgement message in case the correct<br>
receipt of a data segment in the proper order of the sequence, and for receiving a duplicate<br>
acknowledgement message from the receiving peer if a data segment was received, but not<br>
in the proper order of the sequence, the duplicate acknowledgement message being<br>
received in association with the last correctly received data segment in order of the<br>
sequence of data segments.<br>
Further, the sending peer comprises packet loss determining means 603 for deciding that a<br>
data segment was lost which was sent but not acknowledged, if the number of duplicate<br>
acknowledgement messages reaches a duplicate acknowledgement message threshold<br>
determined based on the size of a receive window, the size of the receive window<br>
corresponding to a number of data segments which can be stored in a buffer space at the<br>
17<br><br>
receiving peer. The packet loss determining means may obtain information on the size of<br>
the receive window with acknowledgement messages received from the receiving peer, or<br>
by any other means.<br>
Further, the packet loss determining means may be adapted to set the duplicate<br>
acknowledgement threshold such that the data segment determined to be lost is<br>
retransmitted at a point in time in the sequence of data segments selected such that the<br>
acknowledgement message indicating proper receipt of the data segment determined to be<br>
lost, i.e. the retransmitted data segment, is expected to be received at the sending peer<br>
before transmitting the data segment with a sequence number exceeding the sequence<br>
number of the data segment determined to be lost by the size of the receive window.<br>
In the following a further embodiment of the invention will be described with regard to<br>
Fig. 6.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a detailed embodiment for further illustrating the principles of<br>
determining the duplicate acknowledgement message threshold by use an example of the<br>
TCP protocol.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a sending peer and a receiving peer, as for example noted with regard to<br>
previous embodiments.<br>
At the sending peer a sequence of data segments labelled 01, 02, 03 ... 30 for transmission<br>
to the receiving peer is illustrated, including a retransmission of data segment 01 which is<br>
considered lost or excessively delayed on the transmission path. Data segment 01 is<br>
retransmitted after data segment 22, for reasons explained in the following.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 7 the duplicate acknowledgement threshold is set based on the<br>
size of the receive window and more precisely, is set such that the data segment<br>
determined to be lost is retransmitted at a point in time in the sequence of data segments<br>
selected such that the acknowledgement message indicating proper receipt of the data<br>
segment determined to be lost is expected to be received at the sending peer before<br>
transmitting the data segment with the sequence number exceeding the sequence number<br>
of the data segment determined to be lost by the size of the receive window. The point in<br>
time for retransmitting the data segment 01 constitutes the latest point in time possible<br>
before stalling at the sending peer would occur. Therefore, while further delayed<br>
18<br><br>
transmission, i.e. a further increased duplicate acknowledgement threshold should be<br>
avoided, a lesser delay, i.e. a reduced duplicate acknowledgement threshold would<br>
generally be possible.<br>
In the present case the size of the receive window is considered to be 30, i.e., the receive<br>
buffer has 30 storage locations for data segments. This implies for the transmission of data<br>
segments, that a 31 st data segment can only be transmitted after an acknowledgement for<br>
the first data segment is received.<br>
In the example of Fig. 7, as noted before, and as indicated by the dashed arrow, data<br>
segment 01 transmitted at the sending peer as a first data segment, is considered to be lost<br>
along the transmission path. Data segments 02, 03 etc., are considered to be transmitted<br>
and received properly.<br>
Accordingly, as data segment 01 is missing at the receiving peer, the receipt of the data<br>
segment 02 at the receiving peer will trigger a return of a first duplicate acknowledgement<br>
message (DUPACK) which is considered to be received at the sending peer after<br>
transmission of data packet 10 and before transmission of data packet 11. This delay of the<br>
DUPACK is associated with the transmission delays, processing delays and similar.<br>
Similarly, as data segment 01 continuous to be missing, all subsequent receptions of data<br>
segments at the receiving peer will trigger the transmission of duplicate acknowledgement<br>
messages from the receiving peer to the sending peer, the sending peer receiving an<br>
increasing number of duplicate acknowledgement messages as indicated on the left hand<br>
side of Fig. 7. If the sending peer would continue to transmit data segments in the order of<br>
the sequence, without retransmitting the first data segment 01, eventually the data segment<br>
30 will be transmitted and transmission would have to be halted, as the size of the receive<br>
window would be reached. In other words, further transmissions after the data segment 30<br>
would be not allowed, as acknowledgements for 30 data segments are outstanding, 30 data<br>
segments from and including the data segment 01. A stalling or blocking of a transmission<br>
at the sending peer can for example occur if the number of sent but unacknowledged data<br>
segments is about to exceed the sized of the receive window.<br>
In order to avoid this situation, as shown in the figure, the first data packet 01 is<br>
retransmitted after receiving the 13th duplicate acknowledgement message triggered by the<br>
14th transmitted data packet, data packet 14, in order to allow enough time for the<br>
acknowledgement of the retransmitted data segment 01 to reach the sending peer before<br>
19<br><br>
data segment 31 is to be transmitted. Accordingly, data segment 01 should exactly or at<br>
the latest be transmitted after receiving the 13l duplicate acknowledgement message, after<br>
data segment 22, allowing to avoid a stalling of the transmission of the sequence of data<br>
segments beyond the data segment 30.<br>
Retransmitting the data segment 01 after the 13th duplicate acknowledgement message in<br>
this example must therefore be avoided unless a stalling of the transmission is accepted or<br>
by other means avoided. Earlier transmission does not lead to any stalling, but increases<br>
the network traffic caused by possibly unnecessary retransmissions. In other words, it<br>
should be waited as long as possible with retransmitting data segment 01 such that a<br>
stalling at the sending peer of the transmission can be avoided, as depicted in Fig. 7.<br>
Advantageously, the duplicate acknowledgement message threshold therefore is<br>
determined on the basis of a size of a usable window constituted by the difference between<br>
the size of the receive window and a flight size, the flight size representing the number of<br>
transmitted data segments which have not yet been acknowledged. If it is for example<br>
assumed that the duplicate acknowledgement message threshold is calculated when<br>
transmitting the data segment 10, the flight size, i.e., the transmitted but not yet<br>
acknowledged data segments, is 10. Further, the usable window as indicated in the figure<br>
is defined as the size of the receive window minus the size of the send window, i.e., the<br>
difference between the left edge of the send window being the lowest sequence number of<br>
data segments that has been sent but not acknowledged and the right edge of the send<br>
window being the lowest sequence number of data segments not yet being sent. The usable<br>
window, in other words, is the amount of data that a TCP sender could send at any given<br>
point in time, if permitted by conditions, until becoming limited by the receiving peer.<br>
Still further, it is preferred to set the duplicate acknowledgement threshold based on the<br>
difference between the size of the usable window and the flight size. More precisely,<br>
according to another example, if it is again assumed that the duplicate acknowledgement<br>
threshold is calculated just prior to receiving the first duplicate acknowledgement<br>
message, i.e., when transmitting the data segment 10, the duplicate acknowledgement<br>
message threshold meeting the condition shown in Fig. 7 and explained above, is the<br>
size of usable window + 2 - (flight size -1)<br>
which is equal<br>
20<br><br>
size of usable window - the flight size + 3.<br>
If in another alternative it were assumed that the duplicate acknowledgement threshold is<br>
calculated on receiving the first duplicate acknowledgement message, i.e., upon<br>
transmitting the data segment 11, please be referred to the previous embodiments for<br>
updating the threshold, the usable window would be reduced by 1, the flight size would be<br>
increased by 1 and thus the duplicate acknowledgement threshold would be calculated as<br>
usable window - flight size + 5.<br>
In more general terms the duplicate acknowledgement threshold can be calculated as the<br>
size of usable window - the flight size + N<br>
and with the above explained condition that the<br>
usable window = receive window - flight size<br>
the duplicate acknowledgement threshold is obtained as<br>
size of receive window - 2 x flight size<br>
or still more general,<br>
size of receive window - (k x flight size))<br>
wherein k is a floating value.<br>
Still further, according to another example, the duplicate acknowledgement threshold is<br>
determined as<br>
size of receive window - (2 x flight size) + N,<br>
with N constituting the tuning parameter satisfying the condition<br>
21<br><br>
(2 x flight size) - size of receive window + 1 
if it is assumed that the duplicate acknowledgement threshold is calculated one operation<br>
prior to receiving the first duplicate acknowledgement message, as indicated in Fig. 7.<br>
Again, as outlined before, if the duplicate acknowledgement threshold is calculated one<br>
operation later, i.e., upon receiving the first duplicate acknowledgement message, N 
to be replaced by N 
to 5, thus fulfilling the above discussed condition that an acknowledgement for the<br>
retransmitted data segment is received before the number of previously unsent data<br>
segments, i.e. data segments which are sent for the first time, exceeds the size of the<br>
receive window. If the condition were not fulfilled, this would lead to a transmission stall<br>
at the sending peer, as the sending peer is only allowed to transmit a further data segment<br>
in the sequence, if the number of sent but unacknowledged data segments does not exceed<br>
the size of the receive window as advertised by the receiving peer.<br>
Using the above formulas, it is possible that a negative duplicate acknowledgement<br>
threshold is obtained, in cases were the flight size is large in relation to the receive<br>
window. In order to avoid such a negative duplicate acknowledgement threshold, a max-<br>
operator can be used, which can prevent the duplicate acknowledgement threshold from<br>
obtaining such negative values. Accordingly, the preferred way of calculating the<br>
duplicate acknowledgement threshold at the time indicated in Fig. 7, i.e., prior to receiving<br>
the first duplicate acknowledgement message, is<br>
duplicate acknowledgement message threshold =<br>
max (size of receive window - 2 x flight size + N, 1).<br>
In the following examples are described, how the tuning parameter N can be determined.<br>
As noted above, with N = 3 and determining the duplicate acknowledgement message<br>
threshold one operation prior to receiving the first duplicate acknowledgement message,<br>
the acknowledgement for the retransmission of the first data packet 01 is exactly received<br>
after the receive window is "filled up". This is, however, valid only under the condition<br>
that only one packet was lost and that no packet reordering occurred. In cases where the<br>
two conditions are valid, any increase of N beyond 3 would eventually lead to a window<br>
stalling, i.e., the sending peer would not be allowed to transmit any further data packets.<br>
Therefore, N = 3 is considered the upper bound for N. However, it is noted that in cases<br>
where more than one segment has been lost, it is possible to increase N further, and still to<br>
22<br><br>
avoid window stalling. This however, should not be the typical case, and N = 3 may<br>
preferably be selected as upper bound.<br>
Regarding the lower bound for N it is a reasonable requirement that any algorithm for<br>
calculating the duplicate acknowledgement threshold should calculate a value larger or<br>
equal to 1. This is the value obtained if<br>
N = (2 x flight size - receive window -1).<br>
Generally, if N is decreased, the system is made less conservative, i.e., error recovery is<br>
triggered earlier, in other words it is earlier judged that a data packet is lost. However,<br>
with a decreased N and thus duplicate acknowledgement threshold, the sending peer is less<br>
robust to a packet reordering the network.<br>
As a reasonable value between the upper bound and lower bound leading to good results,<br>
the duplicate acknowledgement message threshold may be set to<br>
max (size of receive window - 2 x flight size, 1)<br>
i.e.N = 0.<br>
The communication device of Fig. 6 may be configured to perform the above calculations<br>
and operations.<br>
More precisely, in another embodiment, the communication device comprises means for<br>
setting the duplicate acknowledgement threshold such that the data segment determined to<br>
be lost is retransmitted before a point in time in the sequence of data segments selected<br>
such that the acknowledgement message indicating proper receipt of the data segment<br>
determined to be lost, i.e. the retransmitted data segment, is expected to be received at the<br>
sending peer before transmitting the data segment with a sequence number exceeding the<br>
sequence number of the data segment determined to be lost by the size of the receive<br>
window.<br>
Further, in another embodiment, the communication device comprises means for<br>
determining the duplicate acknowledgement threshold on the basis of a size of a usable<br>
window constituted by the difference between the size of the receive window and a flight<br>
23<br><br>
size, the flight size representing the number of transmitted data segments which have not<br>
yet been acknowledged.<br>
Further, in another embodiment, the communication device comprises means for<br>
determining the duplicate acknowledgement threshold based on the difference between the<br>
size of the usable window and the flight size.<br>
The means for determining the duplicate acknowledgement may be adapted perform the<br>
determination one instant in time prior to receiving the first duplication message as the<br>
larger value of:<br>
the value 1 and the value obtained by calculating<br>
(size of receive window - (k x flight size)),<br>
wherein k is a float.<br>
The means for determining the duplicate acknowledgement may be adapted to use k = 2.<br>
Further, in another embodiment, the communication device comprises means for<br>
determining the duplicate acknowledgement threshold as<br>
size of receive window - (2 x flight size) + N,<br>
with N constituting a tuning parameter satisfying the condition<br>
(2 x flight size) - size of receive window + 1 
Further, in another embodiment, the communication device comprises means for updating<br>
the duplicate acknowledgement threshold upon determining a change in the size of the<br>
receive window.<br>
Further, in another embodiment, the communication device comprises means for updating<br>
the duplicate acknowledgement threshold at least each first time that a duplicate<br>
acknowledgement message for one of the data segments is received.<br>
24<br><br>
Further, in another embodiment, the communication device comprises means for updating<br>
the duplicate acknowledgement threshold each time that an acknowledgement message is<br>
received.<br>
In addition to the above outlined setting of the duplicate acknowledgement message<br>
threshold based on the size of a receive window, with the size of the receive window<br>
representing a number of data segments which can be stored in a buffer space at the<br>
receiving peer, the situation at the sending peer may be taken into account as well. More<br>
precisely, according to another embodiment, the data segment determined to be lost is<br>
retransmitted, if the sending peer is blocked from transmitting a previously unsent data<br>
segment. In this case, the sending peer may be considered blocked, if one of the following<br>
conditions is fulfilled: the number of previously unsent data segments exceeds the size of<br>
the receive window; the number of previously unsent data segments exceeds the size of<br>
the send window; or an application constituting the source of the data segments does not<br>
supply data segments for transmission.<br>
The method of the present invention can be put to practice in any suitable or appropriate<br>
way, and can especially be present in the form of a computer program, and consequently<br>
also in the form of a storage medium carrying such a computer program. Equally, the<br>
invention can be present in the form of a communication device arranged to operate in<br>
accordance with the method of the invention.<br>

invention is by no means restricted to these embodiments, as it is defined by the appended<br>

9.	The method of at least one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the duplicate<br>
acknowledgement threshold is updated at least each first time that a duplicate<br>
acknowledgement message for one of the data segments is received.<br>
27<br><br>
10.	The method of claims 7 and 9, wherein N = 5.<br>
11.	The method of at least one claims 1 to 7, wherein the duplicate acknowledgement<br>
threshold is updated each time that an acknowledgement message is received.<br>
12.	The method of at least one of claims 1 to 11, wherein the data segment determined<br>
to be lost is retransmitted, if the sending peer is blocked from transmitting a<br>
previously unsent data segment.<br>
13.	The method of claim 12, wherein the sending peer is considered blocked, if one of<br>
the following conditions is fulfilled:<br>
the number of previously unsent data segments exceeds the size of the receive<br>
window;<br>
the number of previously unsent data segments exceeds the size of the send<br>
window;<br>
an application constituting the source of the data segments does not supply data<br>
segments for transmission.<br>
14.	A computer program arranged to perform the method of at least one of claims 1 to<br>
13 when executed on a computer.<br>
15.	A computer readable memory device that stores the computer program of claim 14.<br>
16.	A communication device controlling the flow of a sequence of data segments from<br>
a sending peer to a receiving peer, comprising:<br>
means for transmitting data segments from the sending peer to the receiving peer in<br>
the order of the sequence,<br>
means for receiving acknowledgment messages from the receiving peer, where an<br>
acknowledgment message indicates the correct receipt of a data segment in the<br>
proper order of the sequence,<br>
28<br><br>
means for receiving a duplicate acknowledgement message from the receiving peer<br>
at the sending peer, wherein the duplicate acknowledgement message indicates that<br>
a data segment was received but not in the proper order of the sequence, the<br>
duplicate acknowledgement message being received in association with the last<br>
correctly received packet in the order of the sequence of data segments,<br>
means for deciding that a data segment was lost, which was sent but not<br>
acknowledged, if the number of duplicate acknowledgement messages reaches a<br>
duplicate acknowledgement threshold determined based on the size of a receive<br>
window, the size of the receive window corresponding to a number of data<br>
segments which can be stored in a buffer space at the receiving peer; and<br>
means for retransmitting the data segment decided to be lost.<br>
Dated this 12th day of July 2007.<br><br>
29<br><br>
A method of controlling the flow of an amount of data from a sending peer to a receiving<br>
peer of a predetermined communication protocol is described. The method comprises<br>
dividing the amount of data into a plurality of data segments, where the data segments are<br>
ordered in a sequence. The segments are sent to the receiving peer in the order of said<br>
sequence. The receiving peer acknowledges the correct receipt of a data segment and<br>
identifies the last correctly received data segment of the sequence that was received in the<br>
proper order of the sequence. The sending peer is arranged such that if it receives a<br>
threshold number of duplicate acknowledgements, it performs a retransmission. The<br>
threshold number that trigger a retransmission is an adaptive parameter determined based<br>
on the size of a receive window, the size of the receive window representing a number of<br>
data segments which can be stored in a buffer space at the receiving peer.</td>
