Ceramic materials have enjoyed c|real i Uccess as igniters in gas fired furnaces, stoves and clothe:-, dryers.  A ceramic igniter typically contains conductive end portions and a highly resistive middle portion.  When the Icjnitor ends are connected to electrical leads and a current is run through the igniter, the highly resistive portion rises in temperature.<br>
In conventional igniter systems, tho nlectrical circuit is typically formed by connecting the metallized coatings B which cover the ends of a ceramic hot surface element C to the silver solder-coated ends AG of nickel clad copper (NCC) wires L which lead to a socket S or other electrical connection.  See Figure<br>
1.<br>
Although this system is suitable for many igniter<br>
applications, its design does engender some problems.  For<br>
example, when it is determined the ceramic hot surface element<br>
C must be replaced, the repair technician must disconnect the<br>
igniter at the interface between the NCC lead wire L and the<br>
socket S, and then introduce a new iqniter at the same	,<br>
interface.  Because the NCC lead wire is often at least 12 inches (and sometimes over 36 inches) in length, the situs of the lead wire/socket interface is often far removed from the service position of the hot surface element C, and is typically in a less accessible place. Since this interface is remote/the technician often expends considerable time arid effort merely removing and replacing the failed igniter.<br>
In addition, use of conventional igniter designs has become problematic at higher service tentperatures.  In particular, it has been observed that the NCC wire begins to degrade at about 450°C (the maximum service temperature of appliance grade wire) and the silver solder becomes liquid at about 600°C.  Moreover, the thermal expansion coefficient of NCC wire is so much greater than that of the typical ceramic that it promotes cracking in the ceramic at temperatures starting at about 450°C.   Since these phenomena become common when the igniter system is used in an application exceeding! about 450°C, use of this conventional igniter system is<br><br>
generally limited to applications having a "service temperature lower than 450°C. Accordingly, use of tl}e above design is precluded in many potential applications (such as self-cleaning ranges) which operate above 485°C      Therefore, there is a need for a high temperature-resistant igniter system which also provides for easy access by a repair technician. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

Simply substituting a conventional high temperature lead wire (such as 18 gauge Ni-Cr wire) for the silver solder-tipped NCC lead wire was considered by the present inventor.  Although this high temperature lead wire bonds well to conventional metallized coatings and would likely withstand the high temperatures surrounding the igniter, it is also very expensive.  Moreover, the extreme rigidity of the Ni-Cr wire imparts significant stress on the hot surface element, leading to igniter failure.  Lastly, since the distance between the hot surface element and the socket in conventional systems is often quite long, simple substitution would result in an expensive igniter system prone to disconnection.  Accordingly, further modification of the conventional system *wi pursued.<br>
The present invention has overcome t\m  drawbacks of the conventional NCC wire-based system by eitlitu t<br>
a)	plugging ends of the hot surf-^P* t1 lament directly<br>
into a socket having high temperature inetal contacts (and<br>
which is located next to the service position of] the hot<br>
surface element) so that the met it "(..li ;;ec| coatings covering<br>
the ends of the hot surface element m^ke direct electrical<br>
connection with the high temperature Hiatal contacts of the<br>
socket, or<br>
b)	electrically connecting the hot surf nee element to the<br>
high temperature contacts of a socket (which is again<br>
located next to the service position of the hot surface<br>
element) through a pair of short, high temperature wires.<br>
In each of these systems, there is no longer an easily     ; degradable material (e.g., NCC wire or low temperature contact) near the hot surface element. The high temperature contacts of the socket can then be connected to NCC wire (not shown) on the<br><br>
opposite side of the socket, where the more moderate temperatures (i.e., about 450°C) do not threaten the integrity of the NCC wire.  Moreover, since the socket is now close to the igniter, both the plug and the uhprt, high temperature wire embodiments provide a "modular" igniter which can be disconnected from its socket at the situs of the hot surface element, thereby allowing its easy original installation or replacement.<br>
The socket of the present invention can be any<br>
conventional socket used in the igniter field which can provide<br>
an electrical circuit through the ceramic hot surface element<br>
(either directly or through an intermediate wire) and maintain<br>
its integrity when exposed to temperatures of: at least 485°C,<br>
preferably at least 650°C.  Typically, the socket contains two<br>
parallel grooves which extend into the socket for reception of<br>
either the igniter ends or the high temperature wire.  In some<br>
preferred embodiments wherein the emits c: f the hot surface<br>
element are plugged into the socket, the grooves are large<br>
enough to securely receive the entire ent'tu of the hot surface<br>
element and further contain pad-like high t eifiperature contacts<br>
which are positioned on the sidewalk of the groove for direct<br>
electrical connection with the metallize;:} costings pf the<br>
igniter.  In other preferred embodiments utilizing high<br>
temperature lead wires, the grooves i\r:e  appropriately shaped<br>
for reception of the short high temperatme wires and contain<br>
high temperature contacts shaped as tubes J;or direct reception<br>
of and connection to the high temperature wires.  Materials<br>
suitable for use as a socket substrate include cordierite. On<br>
the face of the socket opposite its grooves, the socket! usually<br>
possesses electrical ports which are in electrical connection<br>
with the high temperature contacts.  These ports provide a :<br>
means of electrically connecting the high temperature contacts<br>
to an NCC lead wire in a less extreme environment.	r<br>
The contacts of the present invention can be any high . temperature material which can conduct a current and resist; degradation up to a temperature of no less than 485 C, ? preferably no less than 650°C. Typically, the contacts are! made of metal or a metal alloy. Some materials suitable for use as the contact include nickel alloys, nickel, gold, silver<br><br>
and platinum.  The size and shape of the obniacts depend upon the type of electrical connection des tred.  For example, the contacts can be shaped as flat pads and positioned along the sidewalls of a groove in the socket (If vjlrect connection to the metallized coating of the hot surface element is desired), or as tubes which essentially line the groove (if indirect ; connection to the metallized coatincjf* through a high temperature lead wire is desired) . in  s ])i)^ embodiments, the contacts can comprise a spring metal base having a noble metal-type coating.<br>
The ceramic hot surface element: of the. present invention can be made of any ceramic typically user) In the igniter field, including silicon carbide, silicon nitride, aluminum nitride,-or tungsten carbide-based,compositions.  preferred compositions include a bimodal silicon carbide blend an4 those compositions disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,045,237, the specification of which is incorporated by reference. Hot surface elements comprising a refractory metal element encased in a ceramic (as in U.S. Patent No. 4,357,526) are also suitable for use with the present invention. The size and composition of the hot surface element should be selected to be suitable for use in at least part of the voltage range between about 3 and about 300 volts, and in at least part of the temperature range of between about 980°C and about 1700°C.  The one basic shape requirement is that the hot surface element have two ends for conducting an  j electric circuit.  However, the shape can be any shape typically adopted in igniter geometries, including hairpins, coils, rods, serpentines and fibers.  In some embodiments of the present invention having AIN-baseci compositions, the hot surface element has a hairpin design (as in Figure 2), a height of between 1 cm and 8 cm, and a thickness of between 0.5 mm and 2.0 mm.  In some embodiments having bimodal silicon carbide compositions, the hot surface element has a serpentine configuration (as in Figure 4), a height oj: 5 to 10 cm, and a thickness of 2 to 13 mm.<br>
In embodiments employing a high temperature lead wire to provide electrical connection between the metallized coatings<br>
i<br>
of the igniter and the contacts of the socket, the high temperature lead wire has a melting point of at least 485°Cr<br><br>
preferably at least 650°c. Generally, the I'fttfh temperature lead wire is a metal or metal alloy.  Materia I!' miitable for use as the high temperature lead wire include nn:|;i.H alloys, nickel, silver, gold, and platinum.  Typical Vjy, 1;'"Mr fl i9h temperature lead wire has a length of 1 cm to 15 cm, Jcrnsfierably 1 cm to 2 cm. Likewise, its diameter is typically )ust.ween 0.5 and 1.5 mm.<br>
The metallized coating covering the igniter ends can be any coating commonly used to electrically connect ceramic hot -surface elements and lead-wires.  In aoitio preferred embodiments, the metallized coating is a fc&gt;raze, preferably an active metal braze.  When AIN-based hot surface elements are selected, the metallized coating is preferably a braze.1 In other preferred embodiments, the metallized coating is a flame spray coating, preferably comprising a nickel alloy.  When bimodal silicon carbide-based hot surface elements are selected, the metallized coating is preferably a flame spray coating (although a braze can also be suitably used). With either of these coatings, the metallised coating is applied to the ends of the ceramic hot surface element ih an amount sufficient to provide good electrical and physical connection    j between the ceramic hot surface element and the high<br>
temperature contacts or lead wires.	(<br>
i<br>
When a braze is used as the metallized coating, it is typically (but not exclusively) applied on one face of each, end of the ceramic hot surface element, in regions of about 0.5 to 4 sguare millimeters (mm ), by either brushing or silk-screening.  To obtain the required high degree of adhesion to the ceramic, the braze typically contains an active metal which can wet and react with the ceramic materials and so provide adherence thereto by filler metals contained in the braze. Examples of specific active metals include titanium, zirconium and niobium.  Preferably, the active metal is titanium or zirconium.  In addition to the active metal, the braze typically contains one or more filler metals such as silver, copper, indium, tin, zinc, lead, cadniiujn, and phosphorous. Preferably, a mixture of filler metals is used.  Most preferably, the braze will comprise titanium as the active I metal and a mixture of copper and silver mn the filler metal. Generally, the braze will contain between about 0.1 weight<br><br>
percent ("w/o") and about 5 w/o active inut al, with the balance being filler metal.  Suitable commercial brazes include Lucianex 721, available from Lucas' Milhaupt, the. o|: CUdahy, WI and Cusil &amp; Cusin Braze, available from Wesgo, Itic of Belmont,! CA, each of which contains about 70.5 w/o silver, 27.5 w/ojcopper, and about 2 w/o titanium.<br>
If a flame-sprayed coating is used, any conventional flame spray method can be employed for its delivery.  The coating is typically resistant to degradation at temperatures of at least 485°C, preferably at least 650°C.  Preferably, the flame-spray coating is a nickel alloy.  It is typically applied in a thickness of between 0.1 and 0.3 mm.<br>
In conventional systems, the region of the system around the NCC lead wire/metallized coating connection becomes unwieldy if the lead wire is too long (i.e., more than three inches).  This problem is conventionally solved by encasing    \ this region in a ceramic block. Since the present invention typically requires either a short lead wire or no lead wiret at all, the reduced mass of the assembly could he adequate for, maintaining stability without requiring the stabilizing ceramic block.  Accordingly, another advantage of the present invention is the possible elimination of the ceramic block.<br>

i) a ceramic hot surface element 62 comprising fiirst<br>

Also in accordance with the present invention, it has been found that the metallized coatings of the present invention can, be provided through conventional Rf sputtering techniques to produce thin, multi-layered metallized coatings.  A multi-layered metallized coating provides two advantages over conventional painted-on or silk-screened metallized coatings. First, whereas metallized coatings applied by conventional means have a thickness of at least 0,05 jnm, Rf sputtered   \ metallized coatings can have a thickness of only between 0.0:03  I and 0.020 mm. The thinner metallized coating provides a lower stress resulting from the inevitable thermal expansion     • mismatch.  Second, whereas the compon&amp;hts of the conventional metallized coatings are applied en mn^se, the components of the Rf sputtered metallized coating may be applied in discrete layers.  For example, a titanium layex may foe applied to thel ceramic hot surface element, a molybdenum layer may then b€ applied thereon, followed by a silver or nickel layer for connection to the high temperature metal contact.
