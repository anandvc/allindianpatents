				<td>The present invention relates to a method for purifying   a   crude   acetic   acid  product   mixture.<br>
The present invention also relates to an industrial<br>
method for purifying acetic acid, particularly to a<br>
method	for	purifying	acetic	acid	obtained	by<br>
carbonylation  of   methanol.<br>
Description   of   the   Related  Art<br>
Acetic   acid   is   a  basic   chemical   employed   as   a starting-  material   of   each   of,   for   example,   acetic esters,   acetic   anhydride,   vinyl   acetate   and terephthalic   acid   and   thus   employed   in   large   quantity in   the   petrochemical,   organic   chemistry, pharmaceutical   and   agricultural   chemical   production, polymer   chemistry   and   other   industries.<br>
Various   industrial   processes   are   known   for producing  acetic   acid,   which   include,   for   example, oxidation   of   acetaldehyde,    direct   oxidations   of hydrocarbons   such   as   petroleum   naphtha   and   butane,   and carbonylation   of  methanol.      Of   these,    the   process   in which   acetic   acid   is   produced   by   continuously carbonylating  methanol   with   carbon  monoxide   (see Japanese  Patent  Publication-B  No.   47-3334)    Is   now widely   employed   as   an   industrial   process   for   producing<br>
acetic   acid.<br>
In  recent  years,   reaction  conditions  and  catalyst improvements  have  been  studied  in  the  above  acetic acid  production  through   carbonylation  of  methanol. For   example,   a  process   in  which  a  catalyst  stabilizer such  as   an  iodide   salt   is  added  to   the   reaction  system has  been  disclosed   [see  G.B.   Patent  Publication-A  No. 2,146,637   (published  on  April   24,   1985)].      In  Japanese Patent  Publication-A  No.   60-54334,   it  has  been proposed  to  cause   a  relatively  large  amount  of   iodide ions   to  be  present   in  a  reaction  fluid   so  as   to  lower the   concentration  of  water   in  the   reaction  fluid, thereby  minimizing  the  energy  required  to  obtain purified  dry  acetic  acid  per  unit   quantity  thereof  and further  omitting  a  purification  process  for  obtaining acetic  acid  as  a  product   [see  European  Patent Publication-A  No.   573,189   (published  on  Dec.   8, 1993)].<br>
Although   the   acetic   acid  produced  by   the carbonylation  of  methanol   has   a   relatively  high purity,   it   is  known   that   the   acetic   acid   contains   a minute   amount   of   reductive   impurities   evaluated  by   the potassium  permanganate   test   conducted  in  accordance with   JIS   K   1351   [see   European  Patent  Publication-A  No. 322,215   (published  on  June   28,   1989)].     The  potassium<br>
permanganate   test   is  an  important   industrial   test which  acetic  acid  must  pass  when   it   is  put   in  various practical   uses   as   a  product.     Therefore,   the   removal of   the  above   impurities   leading  to  poor   results   in this   test   is  of  utmost   importance.<br>
The   conventional  purification  methods   for obtaining  commercially  available  high-quality  acetic acid  capable  of  meeting  the   standards   include,   for example,    (a)   chemical   addition  method   [for   example, addition  of  an  amine,   a  nonvolatile  acid  or  the  like as   disclosed   in  Japanese  Patent  Publication-B  No.   42-6243   (published  on  Mar.   14,   1967)]   and   (b)   oxidant addition  method   [for  example,   addition  of  peracetic acid  as  disclosed  in  Japanese  Patent  Publication-B  No. 48-30615   (published  on  Sep.   21,    1973)].      However,   the above  methods   require   the  use  of  various  fidditives,   so that  problems  arise  with  respect   to  handling  and aftertreatment.     That  is,   not  only  at  least   simple distillation  for   separating  the   additives   is   further required  but  also  there   is  a  potential  problem  of   the additives   remaining  in   the  acetic  acid  as  a  product. Especially,   the  oxidant  addition  method   (b)   has   a potential   danger   of  explosion  attributed  to  a  rapid reaction  of  peroxide   remaining  unreacted   in   separating the   additives.      Therefore,   a  purification  method   in<br>
which  no  additives   are  added  is  desired.<br>
While,   in  a  distilling  method,   concentration  of  a minute  amount  of   impurities  to  a  considerable  extent is  required  for  minimizing  acetic  acid  entrained  in the  separation  and  disposal  of   impurities  to  thereby suppress  the  purification  loss  of  the  acetic  acid. Thus,   the  distillation  column  must  have  a  considerably large  number  of  plates  and  a  considerably  high  reflux ratio.     Consequently,   a  considerably  large  amount  of thermal  energy  is   to  be  consumed,   thereby  bringing about  a  problem  of  gravely  pushing  up  the  cost  for purification.     Therefore,   a  method  of  economically removing  the  above   impurities  is  desired.<br>
Disclosure  of   the  Invention<br>
Summary  of  the  Invention<br>
Under  these  circumstances,   the  present  Inventors have  made   extensive   studies  with  respect   to  the purification  of  acetic  acid  which  contains  a  minute amount  of  impurities   composed  of  at   least  one component   selected  from  among  organoiodine   compounds, metalloiodine  compounds,   iodide  ions,   unsaturated compounds  and  carbonyl   compounds  and  which  exhibits poor  marks   in   the   potassium  permanganate   test.      As   a result,   a  distilling  method  of   the  present   invention<br>
which   ensures,   without   the  addition  of  chemicals  for separating  the  impurities,   energy-saving  economical purification  for   obtaining  high-quality  acetic  acid which  exhibits  high  marks   in  the  potassium permanganate   test,   has  been  completed.<br>
That  is,   the  present  invention  relates  to  a method  for  purifying  acetic  acid  containing  at  least one  component  selected  from  the  group  consisting  of organoiodine   compounds,   metalloiodine   compounds, iodide   ions,   unsaturated  compounds  and  carbonyl compounds  as  an  impurity,   which  comprises  purifying the  acetic  acid  with  a  distillation  column  having  at least   30  plates  by  operating  the   distillation  column under  a  pressure  ranging  from  40  to  760  mmHg  at  a reflux  ratio  of  at  least  4.<br>
In  other  words,   the  present  invention  relates  to a  method  of  purifying  acetic  acid  containing impurities   composed  of  at   least   one   component   selected from  among  organoiodine   compounds,   metalloiodine compounds,   iodide   ions,   unsaturated  compounds  and carbonyl   compounds,   characterized   in   that   the purification   is   conducted   in  a  distillation  column having  at   least   30   plates   operated  under   a  pressure ranging  from  40   to  760  mmHg  at  a   reflux   ratio  of  at least   4   to   thereby  obtain  high-quality  acetic  acid  as<br>
a  product.<br>
Although  the  present   invention  is   in  principle applicable   to  any  acetic  acid   irrespective  of   its production  process,   it   is  advantageously  applied especially  to  the  product  of  carbonylation  of  methanol or   the   like  performed  in  the  presence  of  a  metal catalyst   such  as  a  rhodium  catalyst  with  the  use  of  a cocatalyst  of  a  halide  such  as  an  organic  halide,   as described  in  G.B.   Patent  Publication-A  No.   1,233,121.<br>
Further  scope  and  applicability  of  the  present invention  will  become  apparent  from  the   detailed description  given  hereinafter.     However,   it  should  be understood  that  the  detailed  description  and  specific examples,   while  indicating  preferred  embodiments  of the   invention,   are   given  by  way  of   illustration  only, since  various  changes  and  modifications  within  the spirit  and  scope  of  the  invention  will  become  apparent to   those   skilled  in  the  art  from  this  detailed description.<br>
Detailed  Description  of  the  Invention<br>
The  production  of  acetic   acid  by  carbonylation  of methanol   is  performed   in   the   following  manner. Methanol   and  carbon  monoxide   as   the   starting  compounds are   continuously  charged   in  a   reactor   to   conduct  a reaction  at  a   given  temperature   under  a  given  pressure<br>
as   described  in,   for  example,   U.S.   Patent  No. 4,102,922   (published  on  July   25,   1978).      One   of   the starting  compound   is  not  limited   to  methanol,   but  at least   one   of  methyl   acetate,   dimethyl   ether  and methanol,   a  mixture  of  two  or  more  of   them  or  a mixture  of  at   least  one  of   the   above   compounds  and water  may  be  used.     The  reaction  temperature  ranges generally  from  about  150  to  250°C,   preferably  from about   180   to  220°C.     The  total   reaction  pressure   is controlled   so  as   to  range   from  about   15   to  40  kg/cm2G in  consideration  for  the  partial  pressures  of  carbon monoxide   and  hydrogen  and   the  vapor  pressures  of  the liquid  components  present   in  the  reactor.<br>
The  rhodium  catalyst  which  is  employed  in  the carbonylatlon  of  methanol  may  take  any  form,   as  far  as it   can  be   converted  into  a  complex  soluble   in  the reaction  fluid  under  the  reaction  conditions.      In  the reaction  fluid,   the   rhodium  concentration   ranges   from about   200   to  1000  ppm,   preferably  from  about   300   to 600  ppm.<br>
In  the   carbonylation  of  methanol,   methyl   iodide is   used  as   a  promoter   and   is   contained   in   the   reaction fluid   in   a   concentration   ranging  from  about   5   to   20% by  weight,   preferably  from  about   12   to   16%  by  weight.<br>
The   concentration  of  water   in   the   reaction  fluid<br>
is  about  10%  by  weight  or  below,   preferably  from  1   to 5%  by  weight.<br>
The  carbonylation  of  methanol   is  continuously performed,   so  that  methyl  acetate  formed  by  the reaction  between  methanol  as  the   starting  compound  and acetic  acid  is  present  in  the  reaction  fluid.     The amount  of  methyl  acetate  is  controlled  so  as  to  range from  about   0.1   to  30%  by  weight,   preferably  from  about 0.5   to  5%  by  weight.     Also,   acetic  acid  which  is  a product  and  a  reaction  solvent  is  present  in  the reaction  fluid  as  a  main  component.<br>
When  the  carbonylation  of  methanol   is  effected under  low  water  content  conditions,   an  iodide  salt  is added  to  the  reaction  fluid  for  the  stabilization  of the   rhodium  catalyst  and  as  a  cocatalyst.     The  above iodide  salt  is  not  particularly  limited  as  long  as  it dissociates  an  iodide  ion  in  the  reaction  fluid. Examples   of   the   iodide   salts   include  alkali  metal iodides   such  as  Lil,   Nal,   KI,   Rbl  and  Csl,   alkaline earth  metal   iodides   such  as  BeI2,   MgI2  and  Cal2  and aluminum-group  metal   iodides   such  as  BI3  and  AII3.      The iodide   salt   is  not   limited  to   these  metal   iodides,   and organic   iodides  may  be  used,   which   include,   for example,   quaternary  phosphonium   iodides   (such  as   an adduct  of   tributylphosphine  with  methyl   iodide  or<br>
hydrogen  iodide  and  an  adduct  of  triphenylphosphine with  methyl   iodide   or  hydrogen   iodide)   and  quaternary ammonium   iodides   (such  as   adducts   of   tertiary  amines with  methyl   iodide   or  hydrogen   iodide,   adducts   of pyridines  with  methyl   iodide  or  hydrogen  iodide, adducts  of  imidazoles  with  methyl   iodide  or  hydrogen iodide,   and  adducts  of  imides  with  methyl   iodide  or hydrogen  iodide).     Among  them,   alkali  metal   iodides such  as  Lil  are  preferred.     The   iodide   salt   is  used, irrespective  of   the   type  of   the   iodide   salt,   in  an amount  of   0.07   to  2.5  mol/ ,   preferably  0.25   to   1.5 mol/8   in   terms   of  iodide   ion,   i.e.,   as  a  molar concentration  of  iodide  ion  contained  in  the  reaction fluid.<br>
The   crude   acetic  acid  thus   formed   is  purified  by an  operation  such  as   distillation  for   removing  water. However,   after   the  purification,   the  acetic  acid generally  contains,   as  an  impurity,   at  least  one component   selected  from  the   group   consisting  of organoiodine  compounds,   metalloiodine  compounds, iodide   ions,   unsaturated  compounds   and  carbonyl compounds,   as   described   in  European  Patent Publication-A   No.    322,215   (published   on   June   28, 1989).     Examples   of   the  organoiodine   compounds   include ethyl   iodide,   butyl   iodide   and  hexyl   iodide.      Examples<br>
of  the  unsaturated  compounds   include  acetaldehyde, butyraldehyde,   crotonaldehyde  and  2-ethylcroton-aldehyde,   and  products   formed  by  aldol   condensation  of these  aldehydes.     It   is  described  in  Japanese  Patent Publication-A  No.   1-211548   that   the  main  components  of the   impurities  are  alkyl   iodides,   various  unsaturated compounds  such  as  crotonaldehyde,   ethylcrotonaldehyde and  2-methyl-2-pentenal,   and  carbonyl   compounds. These   impurities  present   in  minute  amounts   cause   the mark  of  the  potassium  permanganate  test  of  acetic  acid to  become  poor,   thereby  lowering  the  commercial  value and  industrial  availability  of  the  acetic  acid  as  a product.<br>
The  present   inventors  have  been  extensively studied  with  respect   to  the  purification  method  of  the above  acetic  acid.     As  a  result,   they  have  been  found that  the  purification  of  the  above  acetic  acid  by  the method  of   the  present   invention   realizes   economical conversion  of  the  crude  acetic  acid  to  high-quality acetic  acid  which  exhibits  high  marks   in  the  potassium permanganate   test.<br>
That  is,   the  present  invention  comprehends  a methods   of  purifying  acetic   acid   containing   impurities composed  of  at   least   one   component   selected  from  among organoiodine   compounds,   metalloiodine   compounds,<br>
iodide   ions,   unsaturated  compounds  and  carbonyl compounds   in  a  process   for  producing  acetic  acid  which comprises   reacting  methanol,   a  mixture  of  methyl acetate  and  water  or  a  mixture  of  methyl  acetate, methanol   and  water  with  carbon  monoxide   in  a  reaction medium  containing  a  rhodium  catalyst,   water,   acetic acid  and  methyl   iodide,   characterized  in  that  the purification  is  conducted  in  a  distillation  column having  at   least  30  plates  operated  under  a  pressure ranging  from  40   to   760  mmHg  at  a  reflux   ratio  of  at least  4   to   thereby  obtain  high-quality  acetic   acid  as a  product.<br>
Examinations  of  patent  and  other  documents published  heretofore  have  revealed  that  the distillation  of  acetic  acid  is  carried  out  under  the atmospheric  of  higher  pressure   [see  G.B.   Patent Publication-A  No.   1,294,432  and  U.S.   Patent  No. 4,029,553   (published  on  June   14,   1977)]   and  that  no purification  of  acetic  acid  is  effected  under  a reduced  pressure.     That   is,   the  operation  under   the atmospheric   or  higher  pressure  has  become   like   a matter   of   general   knowledge   in   the  purification  of acetic   acid  by  distillation.<br>
In   the  present   invention,   the  distillation   is effected  with  a  distillation   column  which  can  be operated  under  reduced  pressure.     Any  type  of distillation  columns  customarily  employed   in separation  and  purification  of   solutions,   including  a packed  column,   a  plate  column  and  a  combination thereof,   may  be  used   in  the  present   invention  as   long as  the  following  requirements  are  met.     Generally,   a plate   column   is   employed  for  vacuum  distillation.<br>
In  the  present   invention,   the  acetic  acid  to  be purified  which  exhibits  poor  marks   in  the  potassium permanganate  test  is  fed  into  the  distillation  column at   its  middle  and  heated  in  a  reboiler.      Organic iodides,   unsaturated  compounds  and  carbonyl impurities,   which  may  have  boiling  points  lower  than that  of  acetic  acid,   occasionally  together  with  iodide ion  impurities,   are  concentrated  at  the   top  of  the column.     Some  impurities  among  them  may  be concentrated  at  the  top  of  the  column  as  an  azeotropic mixture.     On  the  other  hands,   iodide   ion  impurities, and   organic   iodides,   unsaturated  compounds   and carbonyl   impurities,   which  have  boiling  points  higher than   that   of  acetic   acid,   are   concentrated   at   the bottom  of   the   column.<br>
For   achieving  the   concentration  and   separation  of the  above   impurities,   the  distillation  column  must have   a   large  number   of  plates   and  a  high   reflux   ratio<br><br>
is  necessitated.     The   distillation  column  has  at   least 30   plates,   preferably  at   least   50  plates.     The   reflux ratio   is  at   least  4,   preferably  at   least  50.<br>
The  high  reflux   ratio   inevitably  requires  a  great amount   of  thermal   energy   in   the   reboiler.     However,   in the  present  invention,   the  distillation  is  performed under   a  reduced  pressure,   so   that   the  boiling  points of  components  in  crude  acetic  acid  are  lowered. Accordingly,   a  great  amount  of  thermal  energy  is  not necessitated  even  when  a  high  reflux  ratio   is employed.     Therefore,   in  the  purification  method  of the  present  invention,   overhead  steam,   low-pressure waste   steam  and  the  like  available  from  other distillation  columns  can  be  used  as  the  heat  source for   the   reboiler  of  the  vacuum  distillation  column. Thus,   little  additional  thermal   energy  is  necessitated for   the  purification  method  of  the  present   invention.<br>
The  operating  pressure  of   the  vacuum  distillation column  for  use  in  the  present   invention  ranges  from  40 to  760  mmHg,   of  which  an  appropriate  one  can  be selected  by  taking  into  account   the   temperature  of  the heat   source  for  use   in  the   reboiler.     Especially,   it is   preferred   that   the   operating  pressure   ranges   from 40   to  400  mmHg,   at  which  the  temperature  of  bottoms   is not  higher   the  boiling  point  of  water  under   the<br>
atmospheric   pressure   to   thereby   widen   the   range   of employable   heat   source.<br>
The   organic   iodides,   unsaturated   compounds   and carbonyl   impurities,   occasionally   together  with   iodide ion   impurities,   which   have   been   concentrated   at   the top   of   the   column,   are  batchwise  or   continuously withdrawn   in   small   quantity,   and  wholly  or  partially recycled   to   a   carbonylation   reactor   for   effective reutilization.      On   the   other   hand,    the   bottoms   are batchwise   or   continuously  withdrawn,   if  necessary,   and recycled   to   the   previous   step.      Alternatively,    the components   concentrated   at   the   top   and   the   bottom   of the   column   may  wholly   or   partially  be   disposed   of outside   the   system   in   order   to   maintain   the   quality   of acetic   acid   as   a   product.<br>
In   the   present   invention,    the   distillation   is conducted  at   lower   temperatures,   so   that   the   thermal conversion   of   acetic   acid   to,   for   example,   acetic anhydride   can   be  minimized,    thereby   achieving purification  with  minimized   loss.<br>
Acetic   acid   as   a   product   is   withdrawn   in   vaporous or   liquid   form   from   the   distillation   column   at,    for example,    its   second   plate   counted   from   the   bottom.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides for a method for purifying a crude acetic acid product mixture, which  comprises   the   steps  of:<br>
purifying a crude acetic acid product mixture containing<br>
at least one impurity selected from the group consisting<br>
of unsaturated compounds and carbonyl compounds, wherein<br>
at least one impurity essentially consist of<br>
crotonaldehyde, ethyl-crotonaldehyde and 2-methyl-2-<br>
pentenal,	in    a    first    distillation    column    operated    at<br>
least at atmospheric pressure and then purifying the mixture in a second distillation column having at least 30 plates and operated at a pressure ranging from 40 to 760 mm Hg and a reflux ratio of at least four, wherein overhead vapour from the first column is used as the heat source for a reboiler of the second column and the pressure of the second column is less than the pressure of the first column to obtain the purified acetic acid from   said   second  distillation   column.<br>

In  the  above  figures,   reference  numerals   1   to  5, 8   to   13,   16  to  20  and  23  to  28  are   each  a  line,   those of   6,   14,   21  and  29   are   each  a   condenser,   and   those  of 7,   15,   22  and  30  are  each  a  reboiler.<br>
Description  of  the  Preferable  Embodiment<br>
One  embodiment  of  the  present  invention  will  be described  below  with  reference   to  Figs,   la,   lb  and  2 (Fig.   la  being  a  referential  view)   to  thereby  more clearly  demonstrate  the  availability  of  the  present invention.<br>
Referring  to  Fig.   lb,   the   column  B   is  a  vacuum distillation  column  suitable  for  use   in  the  present invention.     Acetic  acid   to  be  purified  which  has  poor marks   in   the  potassium  permanganate   test   is   charged through  a   line   8   into   the   column  B  at   its  middle. Overhead   steam  output   from  the   column  B   is   led   through a   line   10   into   a   condenser   14,    in  which   the   steam   is condensed.      Part   of   the   condensate   is  wholly   recycled through  a   line   11   to   a   carbonylation   reactor   or<br>
disposed  off.     Alternatively,   part  of  the  condensate is  partially  recycled  through  a   line   11   to  a carbonylation  reactor  and  partially  disposed  off.     The rest  of  the  condensate  formed  in  the  condenser  14  is recycled  through  a  line  12   to  the   column  B  as  a reflux.     Bottoms  are  withdrawn  through  a  line  9.     The bottoms  are  wholly  recycled  to  the  previous  step  or disposed  off.     Alternatively,   the  bottoms  are partially  recycled  to  the  previous   step  and  partially disposed  off.     The  fluid  withdrawn  through  a  line  13 is  used  as  a  product  acetic  acid.     Alternatively,   the fluid   is   further  purified  by  means  of,   for   example,   an ozone  treatment.<br>
Referring  to  Fig.   la,   the  column  A  is  a distillation  column  as  described   in  U.S.   Patent  No. 4,029,553   (published  on  June   14,   1977)   which  is  used for   removing,   through  a  line  2,   a  heavy  fraction  from acetic   acid  produced  by  carbonylation  of  methanol. This   column  A  constitutes   a   step   of   the   conventional acetic   acid     purification  process   and   is  operated under   the  atmospheric   or  higher   pressure.<br>
Acetic  acid   to  be  purified   in   the   column  A   is charged   through  a   line   1   into   the   column  A  at   its middle.      Overhead   steam  output   from  the   column  A   is led   through   a   line   3   into  a   condenser   6,   condensed<br>
there,   and  fed   through  a  line  4   to  the   subsequent purification  step.     As   shown  in  Fig.   la,   part  of  the flow  from  the   condenser   6   is   recycled   through  a  line   5 to   the   column  A  as   a  reflux.<br>
In  the  present   invention,   as   shown  in  Fig.   2,   the overhead  steam  led  through  a  line  18  of  the  column  A can  be  used  as  a  heat  source  for  a  reboiler  30  of  the column  B.     When  the  column  A  is  operated  at  about  1.03 kg/cm2,   the  temperature  of  the  overhead  is  118°C,   which is   satisfactory  for  use  as   the  heat   source   for   the column  B.     Therefore,   in  the  present   invention,   acetic acid  produced  by  the  carbonylation  of  methanol  can  be purified  into  high-quality  acetic  acid  which  has  high marks  in  the  potassium  permanganate  test  with  little addition  to  the  purification  energy  required  in  the conventional  acetic  acid  purification  process  by  the use  of  the  overhead  steam  output  from  the  distillation column  A  constituting  a   step  of   the   conventional acetic  acid  purification  process  as   the   heat   source for   the   reboiler   of   the  vacuum  distillation  column  B for   use   in   the   present   invention.<br>
Examples<br>
The   availability  of   the   present   invention  will now  be   described  with   reference   to   the   following examples  which   should  not  be   considered   to   limit   the<br>
scope  of   the  present   invention. Example  1<br>
An  acetic   acid  purification  experiment  was conducted  with  the  use  of  a   50-plate   Oldershaw distillation  column   (a  type  of  plate  column).<br>
The  pressure  of  the  distillation  column  was controlled  so  as  to  be  400  mmHg  at  the   top  of  the column,   where   the  temperature  was  about   90°C.     Acetic acid  to  be  charged  was  fed  at  a  flow  rate   of  about   1.1 kg/hr   to   the   23rd  plate  counted  from  the  bottom  of   the column.     Purified  acetic  acid  was  withdrawn  in vaporous  form  from  a  section  very  close  to  the  bottom of  the  column.     The  distillation  column  was  operated at  a  reflux  ratio  of  about  150.     Bottoms  and  overhead were  continuously  withdrawn  outside  the  system  at  flow rates  equal  to  about  1%  and  about  0.8%  of  the  charge flow  rate,   respectively.     Continuous  operation  under these   conditions   resulted   in  an   improvement  of   the marks  of  the  potassium  permanganate  test  from  125  min of   the   charged  acetic  acid   (this   poor   value  being attributed   to   the   inclusion  of  at   least   croton-aldehyde,   ethylcrotonaldehyde   and   2-methyl-2-pentenal) to  at   least   240  min  of   the  purified  acetic   acid. Example   2<br>
Methanol  was   continuously  carbonylated  at   185°C<br>
consisting  essentially  of   14%  by  weight   of methyl  iodide,   8%  by  weight  of  water,   1.6%  by  weight of  methyl   acetate,   71%  by  weight  of  acetic   acid,   5%  by weight  of   lithium   iodide  and  400  ppm  of   rhodium,   with the  use  of  a  continuous  withdrawal  autoclave   (a carbonylation  reactor),   thereby  producing  acetic  acid. The  obtained   reaction  fluid  was   introduced   into  an evaporator,   in  which   the   reaction  fluid  was   separated into  a  volatile  phase  containing  the  product  and  a nonvolatile  phase   containing  the   catalyst.     The volatile  phase  was  successively  distilled  for  removing a  low-boiling  fraction,   for  dehydration  and  for removing  a  high-boiling  fraction,   thereby  obtaining acetic  acid.     This  acetic  acid  contained  at  least crotonaldehyde,   ethylcrotonaldehyde  and  2-methyl-2-pentenal,   so   that   the  potassium  permanganate   test  mark of   the  acetic   acid  was  as  poor  as   110  min.<br>
A  purification  experiment  was   conducted  for   this acetic  acid  with  the  use  of   the   same   distillation column  as   that  of  Example   1   and  under   the   same operating  conditions   as   those  of  Example   1.      The resultant   purified   acetic   acid  had   the   potassium permanganate   test   mark   improved   to  at   least   240   min.<br>
Example   3<br>
The  heat  balance  was   calculated  with   respect   to the   operation  of   the  plant   of  Fig.   2.<br>
The  column  A  of  Fig.   2,   i.e.,   column  for  removing a  heavy  fraction  from  the   crude  acetic   acid,   could  be operated  according  to  the  balance  of  Table   1.     The operating  pressure  was  1.03  kg/cm2,   and  the  column  top temperature  was  118°C.<br>
Table   1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
From  the  above,   the  flow  rate  and  temperature  of the   overhead  steam   (line   18)   output  from  the  column  A which  can  be  used  as  a  heat   source  for   the   reboiler  of the   column  B  are   76.7  kg/hr   and   118°C,   respectively. On   the  heat  balance,   the   amount   of   the   fluid   (i.e., the   overhead   steam)   is   expressed   in   terms   of   acetic acid   because   the   amount   of   the   components   other   than acetic   acid   is   very  minute   in   the   fluid.      The   latent heat   of   evaporation  of  acetic   acid   is   97  kcal/kg,   so<br>
that   a   quantity   of  heat   of   7.4   x   l03  kcal/hr   can  be obtained  from  the   overhead   steam  output   from  the column  A.<br>
According  to   the  procedures  of  Example   1   of   the present   invention,   the   column  B  of  Fig.   2   can  be operated  in  accordance  with  the  balance   specified  in Table   2.     The   operating  pressure   at   the   column  top   is 400  mmHg  and  the   column  bottom  temperature   is  95°C.<br>
Table   2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In  this   instance,   the  quantity  of  heat  needed  for<br>
the   reboiler   of   the   column  B   is   7.1   x   103  kcal/hr.<br>
Hence,<br>
quantity  of  heat	quantity   of   heat<br>
carried  by  overhead	&gt;	needed  for   reboiler<br>
steam  from   column  A	of   column  B.<br>
Therefore,   when   the   column  B  of  Fig.   lb   according<br>
to   the   present   invention   is   added   to   the   purification<br>
system   including   the   column  A  of  Fig.   la  and  when   the<br>
process   of  Fig.   2   is   employed,   the   column  B  can  be<br>
operated  without  the  need  of  additional   thermal  energy to   thereby  obtain  a  high-quality  acetic   acid.<br>
The  invention  being  thus  described,   it  will  be obvious   that  the  same  may  be  varied  in  many  ways. Such  variations  are  not   to  be   regarded  as   a  departure from  the  spirit  and  scope  of  the   invention,   and  all such  modifications  as  would  be  obvious  to  one  skilled in  the  art  are  intended  to  be   included  within  the scope  of  the  following  claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A method for purifying a crude acetic acid product mixture, which<br>
