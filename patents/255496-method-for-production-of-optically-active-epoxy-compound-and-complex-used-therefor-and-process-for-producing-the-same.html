SPECIFICATION<br>
METHOD FOR PRODUCTION OF OPTIC ALLY ACTIVE EPOXY<br>
COMPOUND, AND COMPLEX USED THEREFOR AND PROCESS FOR<br>
PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a method for producing an<br>
optically active epoxy compound as well as a complex used therefor and a<br>
process for producing the same, and more particularly to a method for producing<br>
an optically active epoxy compound by subjecting a prochiral compound having<br>
a carbon-carbon double bond in its molecule to an asymmetric epoxidation using<br>
a Ti complex with a specific structure as a catalyst.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]        The optically active epoxy compounds are widely used as an<br>
intermediate for various drugs including optically active benzopyran compounds<br>
effective for the treatment of hypertension, asthma and so on, and various<br>
methods for the synthesis of the optically active epoxy compounds have been<br>
widely examined.    Among such synthesis methods, an asymmetric epoxidation<br>
is the most practical method, and since the discovery of asymmetric epoxidation<br>
using titanium tartrate as a catalyst (see T. Katsuki, K.B. Sharpless, J. Am. Chem.<br>
Soc. 1980, 102, 5974-5796), various synthesis methods using the asymmetric<br>
epoxidation have been developed (see E. N. Jacobsen, M. H. Wu, In<br>
"Comprehensive Asymmetric Catalysis" Ed. by Jacobsen, E. N.; Pfaltz, A.;<br>
Yamamoto, H. Springer (1999), Vol. II, Chap. 21, pp.649-677. and T. Katsuki, In<br>
"Comprehensive Coordination Chemistry II" Ed. by McCleverty, J., Elsevier<br>
Science Ltd., Oxford, 2003, Vol. 9, Chapter 9.4, pp.207-264).<br>
[0003]       However, many of these synthesis methods use an oxidant having a<br>
low atomic efficiency such as t-butyl hydroperoxide, hypochlorite,<br>
iodosobenzene or the like, so that it is strongly demanded to develop synthesis<br>
methods using an oxidant having a higher atomic efficiency and being<br>
environmentally benign.    Among various oxidants, hydrogen peroxide is an<br>
environmentally benign oxidant because the atomic efficiency is high but also<br>
only water is produced after the transition of oxygen atom.    For this end,<br>
05909KTo<br><br>
-2-<br>
asymmetric epoxidation using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant has been studied<br>
vigorously, but there are very few cases where epoxidation could be attained with<br>
a high enantioselectivity (see L. Shu, Y. Shi, Tetrahedron, 2001, 57, 5213-5218.<br>
and S. Colonna, H. Molinari, S. Banfi, S. Julia, J. Masana, A. Alvalez,<br>
Tetrahedron, 1983, 39, 1635-1641).    In many cases, there is a problem that the<br>
turnover number of the catalyst is insufficient.<br>
[0004]       On the other hand, the inventors have already discovered that (aRR A,<br>
aRR A)-di-u-oxo Ti(salen) complex is exceptional as a catalyst for asymmetric<br>
sulfonation using urea-hydrogen peroxide adduct (UHP) as the oxidant (see B.<br>
Saito, T. Katsuki, Tetrahedron Lett., 2001, 42, 3873-3876).    However, although<br>
the above (aRR A, aRR A)-di-^-oxo Ti(salen) complex is good for oxidizing<br>
various sulfide compounds with a high enantioselectivity, it cannot promote the<br>
epoxidation of olefins.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
[0005]       Under these circumstances, it is an object of the present invention to<br>
solve the problems of the conventional techniques and to provide an industrially<br>
useful method for producing an optically active epoxy compound, and a complex<br>
used as a catalyst in this process.    Also, it is another object of the present<br>
invention to provide a novel process for producing the above complex.<br>
[0006]        The inventors have made various studies for achieving the above<br>
objects and discovered that it is possible to promote the epoxidation of olefins<br>
using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant with a high enantioselectivity by using as<br>
a catalyst di-Î¼,-oxo titanium complex which is obtained by reducing at least one<br>
of the two imino bonds within its salen ligand in a reaction system and then self-<br>
assembling, and further the turnover number of the catalyst is very high, and as a<br>
result, the present invention has been accomplished.<br>

[0060]        As seen from Table 1, optically active epoxy compounds can be produced<br>
by asymmetrically epoxidizing various unsaturated compounds using complexes which<br>
have salalen ligands produced by reducing one of the two imino bonds within the salen<br>
ligand as a catalyst.<br>
[0061]       (Example 12)<br>
The complex 3 (5 umol) represented by the above formula (XXXI) and the<br>
substrate 1 (0.1 mmol) are dissolved in dichloromethane (1.0 ml).   To the resulting<br>
solution is added 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (0.12 mmol) and reacted by stirring<br>
at room temperature (25Â°C) for 24 hours.   Thereafter, the solvent is distilled off under<br>
a reduced pressure, and the residue is separated through a chromatograph with silica gel<br>
using a mixed solution of pentane:diethylether (40:1) to obtain a product 1.<br>
[0062]        (Example 13)<br>
The reaction is performed in the same way as in Example 12 except that the<br>
complex 4 (5 umol) represented by formula (XXXIV) is used instead of the complex 3<br>
(5 umol) represented by formula (XXXI) and the reaction time is 8 hours.<br>
[0063]        (Example 14)<br>
The reaction is performed in the same way as in Example 13 except that the<br>
reaction temperature is 0Â°C and the reaction time is 24 hours.<br>
[0064]        (Example 15)<br>
The reaction is performed in the same way as in Example 14 except that the<br>
amount of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide used is 0.15 mmol.<br>
[0065]        (Example 16)<br>
Salan ligands represented by formula (XXXIII) (10 umol) is added to a<br>
dichloromethane solution of Ti(O'Pr)4 (1.0 mL, 10 mM) and then stirred at room<br>
temperature.    After 30 minutes, one drop of water is added and further stirred for 30<br>
minutes.   Next, the substrate 1 (0.1 mmol) and 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (0.12<br>
mmol) are added and reacted by stirring at room temperature (25Â°C) for 6 hours.<br>
Thereafter, the solvent is distilled off under a reduced pressure, and the residue is<br>
separated through a chromatograph with silica gel using a mixed solution of<br>
pentane:diethylether (40:1) to obtain a product 1.<br>
[0066]        (Examples 17-22)<br>
The reaction is performed in the same way as in Example 15 except that a<br>
substrate 6, substrate 2, substrate 4, substrate 7, substrate 8 or substrate 5 is used instead<br>
of the substrate 1 and the reaction temperature is 25Â°C.<br>
[0067]        The above results are shown in Table 2.   Moreover, the yield of the product<br>
is analyzed by 1H-NMR (400 MHz).    As a result, products other than the epoxy<br>
05909KTo<br><br>
-35-<br>
compound are not confirmed.   In Table 2, the enantiomer excess of the product is<br>
analyzed through a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using Daicel<br>
chiralcel OB-H and hexane/isopropanol (99/1) mixture for product 1, Daicel chiralcel<br>
OB-H and hexane/isopropanol (90/10) mixture for product 6, Daicel chiralpak AS-H<br>

hexane/isopropanol (99/1) mixture for product 8, respectively.   Furthermore, the<br>
