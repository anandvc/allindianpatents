				<td>The   present invention relates to a   process for preparation of a novel    synergistic formulation useful as pest repellent for stored grains.<br>
The pest repellents are used to avoid the incidence of pests in a particular area where products are needed to be protected from serious damage of diffrent pests. Most of the repellents influences the olfactory systems of target organisms and avoid the feeding of products and mating in their both male and female sexes in a particular environment. Thereby, the population of pest do not build up and the product is saved.<br>
Presently available pest repellents contain the synthetic pesticides containing<br>
insecticidal and repellent formulations for pest control. There are few pest repellent tablets<br>
available in the market but they contain toxic mercury, sulphur and other toxic materials<br>
which, if continoush. used for longer period may affect the normal physiology of human<br>
beings and also may pose threat to man and environment. The main drawback of the<br>
presently available pest repellent material is accumulation of high percentage of residues of<br>
toxic substances beyond their prescribed limit and their removal from seed grains.The<br>
continous use of one type of chemical to protect the grains from damage may lead to quick<br>
development of resistance in insect-pests. A number of potential plant spp. has been<br>
identified as grain protectant to control insect pest of storage. Reference may be made to<br>
Singh. 1980. Emomon 5:161-162: Yadava. 1985 Neem Newsl. 2: 5-6: Singh et al.. 1989.<br>
Journal of Pic	Entomology 82 (3): 727-733: Singh and Upadhaya. 1993. Journal of<br>
Scientific and Industrial Research 52: 676-683: Ho and Tan. 1994. Post han-est Biology-and Pecimoiogy 4: 179-183: Gahukar 1994. Insect Science and its Application 15: 383-400: Xie et al 1995. Journal of Economic Entomology 88: 1024-1030: Shaaya et al 1997 Journal of Stored Products Research 33: 7-15. However, so far no formulation is prepared to control stored grain pests from their plant products.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel formulation useful as pest repellent for stored grains which obviates the drawbacks of the luther to known synthetic pesticides and formulations thereof.<br>
Another object is to provide a novel pest repellent formulation which is biodegradable, eco-friendh. non-toxic and non- polluting<br>
The menthol (synthetic and natural) is one of the biodegradable chemical possessing odorous activity. The molecule possesses travelling capability with their vapour and penetrates easily in stored product and does not have— to leave their residues, so far. in scientific record. Thereby, menthol attains tremendous use in pharmaceuticals, confectionary and cold drink industry etc. Due to it's faster biodegradabilify of natural menthol there is no record of this plant based material as side effects on man and environment. It is considered that unpleasant odour of menthol does not provide comfort, of insect pests, growth and development of insect pests and their progeny— does not enhance. The insect pests during their adult form sunives without mating and further growth and development of pest population is cheeked. Apart from biodegradable, non toxic and non-pollutant nature of menthol, the formulated product can easily evaporate from surface of seeds etc. when shade dried or soaked or washed. Formulated pest repellent tablets containing menthol as a.i may block the respiratory system and inhibit the biological<br>
oxygen demand of the insect attacking the stored grains. The main rational behind it's activity is considered as they may affect the more versatile olfactory system of the insect pest. Due to this reason of repellent odorous material present in methol, the growth and development of insect is checked and finally eyases production of non-viable eggs and inhibit the egg laying capacity in insects leading 10 death of insects on completion of their life cycle. This type of activity interacting with the insect are well known due to many other compounds. However , they do not affect human , animal and other wildlife , flora and fauna. The other specific activities which may be primary or secondary are of intriguing nature in future. It is considered that pest repellent development on the basis of menthol are supposed to minimize , if taken accidentally do not cause any harm. Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparation of a novel synergistic formulation useful as pest repellent for stored grains which comprises mixing by conventional manner 1 to 20 wt% powdered menthol , 1 to 10 wt.% solid preservative powder and 1 to 15 wt. % liquid preservative as described herein , 55 to 97 wt.% powdered earner, binder and adhesive selected from Vigno mungo , gum Arabic , gum tragacanth , gum karaya , guar gum , gum ghatti, dextran , starch dextrin &amp; british gum , starch amylopectin , methyl cellulose , calcium carbonate , powdered cellulose , ethyl cellulose , sodium alginate , lactose or mixture thereof , getting the desired synergistic formulation.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the menthol used may be such as synthetic or natural.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention solid preservative used may be such as<br>
sodium benzoate , hydroxy benzoate , benzyl hydroxy benzoate , bronopol, benzoic acid<br>
and sodium diacetate or mixture thereof.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention liquid preservatives used may be such<br>
as acetic acid , chloro butanol , dehydro acetic acid , diethyl pyrocarbonate , cinnamic<br>
acid, phenethyl alcohol and sorbic acid or mixture thereof.<br>
In an further embodiment of embodiment   of the invention , the formulation of the<br>
present invention may be used in the form of tablets , nuggets , powder and an<br>
ernulsifiable concentrates , prepared by known methods.<br>
In  another embodiment  edible colour used may be such as allura red AC, amaranth ,<br>
black PN. , brilliant blue FCE ., brown FK., canthaxanthin , caramel , carmine , edible<br>
lemon   yellow   colour , chocolate brown HT., cocheneal (B.P), cosin , erythrosine ,<br>
orange G , ponceu 4R , quinoline yellow , raspberry , red 2G , red cherry , red-poppy<br>
petal, red-rose petal, sunset yellow and tartragin or mixture thereof, if desired.<br>
The novel formulation of the present invention is not a mere admixture but is a<br>
synergistic mixture having enhanced properties different from the mere aggregation of<br>
the properties of the individual ingredients.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and<br>
should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example - 1 Tablets were prepared by conventional mixing methods using the following formulation:<br>
Powdered menthol	09.09 wt.%,<br>
Sodium benzoate powdered	05 68wt.%,<br>
Liquid acetic acid	11.36 wt.%,<br>
Powdered vingna mungo	73.64wt.%<br>
Edible lemon yellow colour	00.23 wt.%<br>
Water distilled	Q.S.<br>
The tablets so prepared were kept in plastic jars ( size 11 x 07 cm. Capacity 400 g) containing fresh , healthy and untreated grains of Cicer arietinum 250 g . Two tablets were kept in each jars . The standard pest repellent tablets were also added in different sets for the comparison and tablets were not used in the control sets. Ten healthy adults of pulse beetle ( Calhsobruchus chinensis L.) taken from the mass rearing jars were released in the each treated and untreated grains containing jars. Each sets were replicated five times. Observations on the total number of adults ( both dead and alive were counted after three and six months of tablets applications.<br>
The results indicated that the jars containing tablets so prepared , adversely affected the population build up of C. chinensis and no population of insect pest could multiplied as compared to control. The efficacy of this tablet formulation was found at par with promising standard tablets used in the experiment. Moreover , in control sets , highly damaged grains were found with the attack of fungal development and grains were also found unsuitable for human consumption after three and six months of treatment application. Besides , in treated sets with tablets so prepared , only released insects were found and recorded dead, no eggs on the grain surface, further progeny negligible and<br>
giains were found healthy and suitable for human consumption after six months of tretmunt application.<br>

The tablets, so prepared wete kept in plastic jars (size 1lx 07 cm; captcity 400 g) containing ftcsh. healthy and untreated giains of Oiyza saliva L. 250 g. Two tablets were also keptin each jars. The standard-pest repellent tablets were also added in different sets for the comparison and tablets were not used in the control sets. Ten healthy adults of rust red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum L.) taken fiom the mass rearing jars were released in the each tablet containing jais. Each sets were replicated five times. Observations on total number of adults (both dead and alive ) were counted alter thiec and six months of tablet application.<br>
The results indicated that the jars containing tablets so prepared, was not found at par with'promising standard tablets against population build up of T. caslaneum used in the experiment and in control sets. However, rice (O. Sativa) was not found to be damaged by fungal development in the treated, standard and control sets, after three and six months of tretment application.<br>
Tablets prepared by conventional methods using the following materials:<br>
Powdered menthol	09.09 wt. %;<br>
Sodium benzoate powdered	05.68 wt. %:<br>

Wafer distilled	Q S.<br>
were found effective in controlling the pest population oi pulse beetle ( Callosobruchus, chinensis L.) in the stoied grains of Ciccr arietinum and Lens esudantus after three and sk months of application under laboratoiy conditions. However, these tablets weie found ineffecive against rust red flour beetle ( Tribolium caslaneum) infesting rice ( Oryza saliva). Overall, experimental results indicated that the tablets prepared v\ith this formulation arc useful and economical in controlling the population buildup of pulse beetles in the stoied grains of gram ( C. arietinum ) and Lentil (L. esculantus).<br>
The main advantages of the novel formulation of the present invention are as follow :<br>
I. The menthol based pest repellent is a non- pollutant, non-toxie, and biodegradable product  which has no known side effects.<br>
2 The formulation of these herbal tablets will help in protecting huge amounts of food grains,crude drugs and other materials based on plant products during storages at small scald and godmvns etc.<br>
.1. After dose -dependent and modification of the formulation basd on menthol may be used in controlling the other pests namely silverlish and termites etc. infesting libraries, museums, archives, valuable cloths and herbarium etc.<br>
4, The raw materials are abundantly available and hence, lormulation is economical lo produce.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
