1. CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to application Serial No.<br>
60/628,199 filed November 15,2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
2. FIELD<br>
The present disclosure relates to stereoisomerically enriched compositions of 4N-(3-<br>
aminocarbony lbicyclo[2.2.1 ]hept-5-en-2-y l)-N2~substituted pheny I-2,4-pyrimidinediamine<br>
compounds that exhibit antiproliferative activity, prodrugs of the compounds, intermediates and<br>
methods of synthesis for making the compounds and/or prodrugs, pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising the compounds and/or prodrugs and the use of the compounds and/or prodrugs in a<br>
variety of contexts, including, for example, the treatment of proliferative disorders, such as<br>
tumors and cancers.<br>
3. BACKGROUND<br>
Cancer is a group of varied diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of<br>
abnormal cells. Generally, all types of cancers involve some abnormality in the control of cell<br>
growth and division. The pathways regulating cell division and/or cellular communication<br>
become altered in cancer cells such mat the effects of these regulatory mechanisms hi controlling<br>
and limiting cell growth fails or is bypassed. Through successive rounds of mutation and natural<br>
selection, a group of abnormal celb, generally originating from a single mutant cell, accumulates<br>
additional mutations that provide selective growth advantage over other cells, and thus evolves<br>
into a cell type that predominates in the cell mass. This process of mutation and natural selection<br>
is enhanced by genetic instability displayed by many types of cancer cells, an instability which is<br>
gained either from somatic mutations or by inheritance from the germ line. The enhanced<br>
mutability of cancerous cells increases the probability of their progression towards formation of<br>
malignant cells. As the cancer cells further evolve, some become locally invasive and then<br>
mestasize to colonize tissues other than the cancer cell's tissue of origin. This property along<br>
with the heterogeneity of the tumor cell population makes cancer a particularly difficult disease to<br>
treat and eradicate.<br>
Traditional cancer treatments take advantage of the higher proliferative capacity of cancer<br>
cells and their increased sensitivity to DNA damage. Ionizing radiation, including y-rays and<br>
x-rays, and cytotoxic agents, such as bleomycin, cis-platin, vinblastine, cyclophosphamide,<br>
5'-fluorouracil, and methotrexate rely upon a generalized damage to DNA and destabilization of<br>
chromosomal structure which eventually lead to destruction of cancer cells. These treatments are<br>
particularly effective for those types of cancers that have defects in cell cycle checkpoint, which<br>
limits the ability of these cells to repair damaged DNA before undergoing cell division. The<br>
non-selective nature of these treatments, however, often results in severe and debilitating side<br>
effects. The systemic use of these drugs may result in damage to normally healthy organs and<br>
tissues, and compromise the long-term health of the patient.<br>
Although more selective chemotherapeutic treatments have been developed based on<br>
knowledge of how cancer cells develop, for example, the anti-estrogen compound tamoxifen, the<br>
effectiveness of all chemotherapeutic treatments are subject to development of resistance to the<br>
drugs. In particular, the increased expression of cell membrane bound transporters, such as Mdrl,<br>
produces a multidrug resistance phenotype characterized by increased efflux of drugs from the<br>
cell. These types of adaptation by cancer cells severely limit the effectiveness of certain classes<br>
of chemotherapeutic agents. Consequently, identification of other chemotherapeutic agents,<br>
particularly active stereoisomers and/or stereoisomeric mixtures is critical for establishing<br>
therapies effective for attacking the heterogeneous nature of proliferative disease and for<br>
overcoming any resistance that may develop over the course of therapy with other compounds.<br>
Moreover, use of combinations of chemotherapeutic agents, including different stereoisomers<br>
and/or stereoisomeric mixtures of a particular chemotherapeutic agent, which may have differing<br>
properties and cellular targets, increases the effectiveness of chemotherapy and limits the<br>
generation of drug resistance.<br>

In some embodiments, the compound of structural formula (I) is a racemic mixture of (2-<br>
exo-3-exo) cis isomers according to structural formula (Ha):<br>
including prodrugs, salts, hydrates, solvates and N-oxides thereof, wherein R1, R2, R3 and<br>
R5 are as defined for structural formula (I), supra,<br>
In some embodiments, the compound is a stereoisomerically enriched diastereomer<br>
according to structural formula (la), supra, including prodrugs, salts, hydrates, solvates and Noxides<br>
thereof, that is substantially free of its enantiomer and any other diastereomer thereof.<br>
In still another aspect, prodrugs of the stereoisomerically enriched compounds are<br>
provided. Such prodrugs may be active in their prodrug form, or may be inactive until converted<br>
under physiological or other conditions of use to an active drug form. In the prodrugs, one or<br>
more functional groups of the stereoisomerically enriched compounds are included in promoieties<br>
that cleave from the molecule under the conditions of use, typically by way of hydrolysis,<br>
enzymatic cleavage or some other cleavage mechanism, to yield the functional groups. For<br>
example, primary or secondary amino groups may be included in an amide promoiety that cleaves<br>
under conditions of use to generate the primary or secondary amino group. Thus, the prodrugs<br>
include special types of protecting groups, termed "progroups," masking one or more functional<br>
groups of the compounds that cleave under the conditions of use to yield an active drug<br>
compound. Functional groups within the stereoisomerically enriched compounds that may be<br>
masked with progroups for inclusion in a promoiety include, but are not limited to, amines<br>
(primary and secondary), hydroxyls, sulfanyls (thiols), carboxyls, carbonyls, etc. Myriad<br>
progroups suitable for masking such functional groups to yield promoieties that are cleavable<br>
under the desired conditions of use are known in the art. All of these progroups, alone or in<br>
combination, may be included in the prodrugs. Specific examples of promoieties that yield<br>
primary or secondary amine groups mat can be included in the prodrugs include, but are not<br>
limited to amides, carbatnates, imines, ureas, phosphenyls, phosphoryls and sulfenyls. Specific<br>
examples of promoieties that yield sulfanyl groups mat can be included in the prodrugs include,<br>
but are not limited to, thioethers, for example S-methyl derivatives (monothio, dithio, oxythio,<br>
aminothio acetals), silyl thioethers, thioesters, thiocarbonates, thiocarbamates, asymmetrical<br>
disulfides, etc. Specific examples of promoieties that cleave to yield hydroxyl groups that can be<br>
included in the prodrugs include, but are not limited to, sulfonates, esters and carbonates.<br>
Specific examples of promoieties that yield carboxyl groups that can be included in the prodrugs<br>
include, but are not limited to, esters (including silyl esters, oxainic acid esters and thioesters),<br>
amides and hydrazides.<br>
In still another aspect, compositions comprising one or more stereoisomerically enriched<br>
compounds are provided. The compositions generally comprise the compound(s), and/or<br>
prodrugs, salts, hydrates, solvates and/or N-oxides thereof, and an appropriate carrier, excipient<br>
and/or diluent. The exact nature of the carrier, excipient and/or diluent will depend upon the<br>
desired use for the composition, and may range from being suitable or acceptable for /« vitro uses,<br>
to being suitable or acceptable for veterinary uses, to being suitable or acceptable for use in<br>
humans.<br>
The stereoisomerically enriched compounds described herein are potent inhibitors of<br>
proliferation abnormal cells, such as tumor cells, in in vitro assays. Thus, in still another aspect,<br>
methods of inhibiting proliferation of abnormal cells, and in particular tumor cells, are provided.<br>
The methods generally involve contacting an abnormal cell, such as a tumor cell, with an amount<br>
of one or more stereoisomerically enriched compounds described herein, and/or prodrugs, salts,<br>
hydrates, solvates and/or N-oxides thereof, effective to inhibit proliferation of the cell. The cells<br>
can be contacted with the compound per se, or the compound can be formulated into a<br>
composition. The methods may be practiced in in vitro contexts, or in in vivo contexts as a<br>
therapeutic approach towards the treatment or prevention of prolifeiative disorders, such as<br>
tumorigenic cancers.<br>
In still another aspect, methods of treating proliferative disorders are provided. The<br>
methods may be practiced in annuals in veterinary contexts or in humans. The methods generally<br>
involve administering to an animal or human subject an amount of one or more stereoisomerically<br>
enriched compounds described herein, and/or prodrugs, sans, hydrates, solvates and/or N-oxides<br>
thereof, effective to treat or prevent the proliferative disorder. The compound(s) per se can be<br>
administered to the subject, or the compound(s) can be administered in the form of a composition.<br>
Proliferative disorders that can be treated according to the methods include, but are not limited to,<br>
tumorigenic cancers.<br>
The stereoisomerically enriched compounds described herein are potent inhibitors of<br>
Aurora kinases. Aurora kinases are a family of enzymes known to be key regulators of cell<br>
division. Elevated levels of Aurora kinases have been found in several types of human cancer<br>
cells, such as breast, colon, renal, cervical, neuroblastomer, melanoma, lymphoma, pancreatic,<br>
prostate and other solid tumors (see, e.g., Bischott et al., 1998, EMBO J. 17:3052-3065; Geopfert<br>
&amp; Briokley, 2000, Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 49:331-342; Sakakura et aL, 2001, Br. J. Cancer 84:824-<br>
831), and ova-expression of Aurora kinases has been shown to result in cell transformation, a<br>
process by which normal cells become cancers. Although not intending to be bound by any<br>
particular theory of operation, it is believed that the stereoisomerically enriched compounds<br>
described herein, as well as the active prodrugs, salts, hydrates, solvates and/or N-oxides thereof,<br>
exert their antiproliferative activity by inhibiting one or more Aurora kinases.<br>
Thus, in yet another aspect, methods of inhibiting an activity of an Aurora kinase are<br>
provided. Hie methods generally involve contacting an Aurora kinase with an amount of one or<br>
more stereoisomerically enriched compounds described herein, and/or active prodrugs, salts,<br>
hydrates, solvates and/or N-oxides thereof, effective to inhibit its activity. The methods can be<br>
practiced in in vitro contexts with purified or partially purified Aurora kinase enzymes (e.g., with<br>
extracts of cells expressing an Aurora kinase), in in vitro contexts with intact cells expressing an<br>
Aurora kinase, or in in vivo contexts to inhibit an Aurora kinase-mediated process (for example<br>
cellular mitotis) and/or as a therapeutic approach towards the treatment or prevention of diseases<br>
or disorders that are mediated, at least in part, by Aurora kinase activity.<br>
hi still another aspect, methods of treating or preventing Aurora kinase-mediated diseases<br>
or disorders are provided. The methods generally involve administering to an animal or human<br>
subject an amount of one or more stereoisomerically enriched compounds described herein,<br>
and/or active prodrugs, salts, hydrates, solvates and/or N-oxides thereof, effective to treat or<br>
prevent the Aurora kinase-mediated disease or disorder. Aurora kinase-mediated diseases and<br>
disorders include any disease, disorder, or other deletarions condition in which a member of the<br>
Aurora kinase family of enzymes plays a role. Specific examples of such Aurora kinase-mediated<br>
diseases or disorders include, but are not limited to, melanoma, leukemia, and solid tumor<br>
cancers, such as, for example, colon, breast, gastric, ovarian, cervical, melanoma, renal, prostate,<br>
lymphoma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic and bladder cancers.<br>
Other aspects include, but are not limited to, intermediates and methods useful for<br>
synthesizing the stereoisomerically enriched compounds and prodrugs, as will be described in<br>
more detail herein below.<br>

on the same carbon atom, the nomenclature "alkylidene" is used. A "lower alkyldiyl" is an<br>
alkyldiyl group containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms. In some embodiments the alkyldiyl groups are<br>
saturated acyclic alkanyldiyl groups in which the radical centers are at the terminal carbons, e.g.,<br>
methandiyl (methano); ethan-l,2-diyl (ethano); propan-l,3-diyl (propano); butan-l,4-diyl<br>
(butano); and the like (also referred to as alkylenes, defined infra).<br>
"Alkylcne" by itself or as part of another substituent refers to a straight-chain saturated or<br>
unsaturated alkyldiyl group having two terminal monovalent radical centers derived by the<br>
removal of one hydrogen atom from each of the two terminal carbon atoms of straight-chain<br>
parent alkane, alkene or alkyne. The locant of a double bond or triple bond, if present, in a<br>
particular alkylene is indicated in square brackets. Typical alkylene groups include, but are not<br>
limited to, methylene (methano); ethylenes such as ethano, etheno, ethyno; propylenes such as<br>
propano, prop[l]eno, propa[l,2]dieno, prop[l]yno, etc.; butylenes such as butano, but[l]eno,<br>
but[2]eno, buta[l,3]dieno, but[l]yno, but[2]yno, buta[l,3]diyno, etc.; and the like. Where<br>
specific levels of saturation are intended, the nomenclature alkano, alkeno and/or alkyno is used.<br>
fa some embodiments, the alkylene group is (C1-C6) or (C1-C3) alkylene. In some<br>
embodiments, the alkylene group is a straight-chain saturated alkano group, e.g., methano, ethano,<br>
propane, butano, and the like.<br>
"Cycloalkyl" by itself or as part of another substituent refers to a cyclic version of an<br>
"alkyl" group. Typical cycloalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl; cyclobutyls<br>
such as cyclobutanyl and cyclobutenyl; cyclopentyls such as cyclopentanyl and cyclopentenyl;<br>
cyclohexyls such as cyclohexanyl and cyclohexenyl; and the like.<br>
"Parent Aromatic Ring gystero" refers to an unsaturated cyclic or polycyclic ring system<br>
having a conjugated K electron system. Specifically included within the definition of "parent<br>
aromatic ring system" are fused ring systems in which one or more of the rings are aromatic and<br>
one or more of the rings are saturated or unsaturated, such as, for example, fluorene, indane,<br>
indene, phenalene, tetrahydronaphthalene, etc. Typical parent aromatic ring systems include, but<br>
are not limited to, aceanthrylene, acenaphthylene, acephenanthrylene, anthracene, azulene,<br>
benzene, chrysene, coronene, fluoranthene, fluorene, hexacene, hexaphene, hexalene, indacene,<br>
s-indacene, indane, indene, naphthalene, octacene, octaphene, octalene, ovalene, penta-2,4-diene,<br>
pentacene, pentalene, pentaphene, perylene, phenalene, phenanthrene, picene, pleiadene, pyrene,<br>
pyranthrene, rubicene, tetrahydronaphthalene, triphenylene, trinaphthalene, and the like.<br>
"Aryl" by itself or as part of another substituent refers to a monovalent aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon group having the stated number of carbon atoms (i.e., C5-C15 means from 5 to 15<br>
carbon atoms) derived by the removal of one hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of a<br>
parent aromatic ring system. Typical aryl groups include, but are not limited to, groups derived<br>
from aceanthrylene, acenaphthylene, acephenanthrylene, anthracene, azulene, benzene, chrysene,<br>
coronene, fluoranthene, fluorene, hexacene, hexaphene, hexalene, ov-indacene, s-indacene,<br>

pentalene, pentaphene, perylene, phenalene, phenanthrene, picene, pleiadene, pyrene,<br>
pyranthrene, rubicene, triphenylene, trinaphtfaalene, and the like, as well as the various hydro<br>
isomers thereof. In some embodiments, the aryl group is (C5-C15) aryl, with (C5-C10) being<br>
more typical. Specific examples are phenyl and naphthyl.<br>
"Halogen" or "Halo" by themselves or as part of another substituent, unless otherwise<br>
stated, refer to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.<br>
"Haloalkyr by itself or as part of another substituent refers to an alkyl group in which<br>
one or more of the hydrogen atoms are replaced with a halogen. Thus, the term "haloalkyl" is<br>
meant to include monohaloalkyls, dihaloalkyls, trihaloalkyls, etc. up to perhaloalkyls. For<br>
example, the expression "(C1-C2) haloalkyl" includes fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl,<br>
trifluoromethyl, 1 -fluoroemyl, 1,1-difluoroethyI, 1,2-difluoroethyl, 1,1,1-trifluoroethyl,<br>
perfluoroethyl, etc.<br>
"Hydroxy alkyl" by itself or as part of another substituent refers to an alkyl group in which<br>
one or more of the hydrogen atoms are replaced with a hydroxyl substituent. Thus, the term<br>
"hydroxyalkyl" is meant to include ntonohydroxyalkyls, dihydroxyalkyls, trihydroxyalkyls, etc.<br>
The above-defined groups may include prefixes and/or suffixes that are commonly used<br>
in the art to create additional well-recognized substituent groups. As examples, "alkyloxy" or<br>
"alkoxy" refers to a group of the formula -OR, "alkylamine" refers to a group of the formula<br>
-NHR and "dialkylamine" refers to a group of the formula -NRR, where each R is independently<br>
an alkyl. As another example, "haloalkoxy" or "haloalkyloxy" refers to a group of the formula<br>
-OR', where R' is a haloalkyl,<br>
"Prodrug" refers to a derivative of an active compound (drug) that may require a<br>
transformation under the conditions of use, such as within the body, to release the active drug.<br>
Prodrugs are frequently, but not necessarily, pharmacologically inactive until converted into the<br>
active drug, Prodrugs are typically obtained by masking a functional group in the drug compound<br>
believed to be in part required for activity with a progroup (defined below) to form a pi;omoiefy<br>
which undergoes a transformation, such as cleavage, under the specified conditions of use to<br>
release the functional group, and hence the active drug. The cleavage of the promoiety may<br>
proceed spontaneously, such as by way of a hydrolysis reaction, or it may be catalyzed or Induced<br>
by another agent, such as by an enzyme, by light, by acid or base, or by a change of or exposure to<br>
a physical or environmental parameter, such as a change of temperature. The agent may be<br>
endogenous to the conditions of use, such as an enzyme present in the cells to which the prodrug<br>
is administered or the acidic conditions of the stomach, or it may be supplied exogenously.<br>
A wide variety of pro groups, as well as the resultant promoieties, suitable for masking<br>
functional groups in the active stereoisomerically enriched compounds described herein to yield<br>
prodrugs are well-known in the art For example, a hydroxyl functional group may be masked as<br>
a aulfbnate, ester or carbonate promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the<br>
hydroxyl group. An amino functional group may be masked as an amide, carbamate, imine, urea,<br>
phosphenyl, phosphoryl or sulfenyl promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the<br>
amino group. A car boxy 1 group may be masked as an ester (including silyl esters and thioesters),<br>
amide or hydrazide promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the carboxyl group.<br>
Other specific examples of suitable progroups and their respective promoieties will be apparent to<br>
those of skill in the art.<br>
"Progroup" refers to a type of protecting group that, when used to mask a functional<br>
group within an active stereoisomerically enriched drug compound to form a promoiety, converts<br>
the drug into a prodrug. Progroups are typically attached to the functional group of the drug via<br>
bonds that are cieavable under specified conditions of use. Thus, a progroup is that portion of a<br>
promoiery that cleaves to release the functional group under the specified conditions of use. As a<br>
specific example, an amide promoiery of the formula -NH-C(O)CH3 comprises the progroup<br>
-C(COCH3.<br>
"Proliferative disorder" refers to a disease or disorder characterized by aberrant cell<br>
proliferation, for example, where cells divide more than their counterpart normal cells. The<br>
aberrant proliferation may be caused by any mechanism of action or combination of mechanisms<br>
of action. For example, the cell cycle of one or more cells may be affected such that cell(s) divide<br>
more frequently than their counterpart normal cells, or as another example, one or more cells may<br>
bypass inhibitory signals, which would normally limit their number of divisions. Proliferative<br>
diseases include, but are not limited to, slow or fast growing tumors and cancers.<br>
"Antiproliferative compound" refers to a compound that inhibits the proliferation of a cell<br>
as compared to an untreated control cell of a similar type. The inhibition can be brought about by<br>
any mechanism or combination of mechanisms, and may operate to inhibit proliferation<br>
cytostatically or cytotoxically. As a specific example, inhibition as used herein includes, but is<br>
not limited to, arrest of cell division, a reduction in the rate of cell division, proliferation and/or<br>
growth and/or induction of cell death, by any mechanism of action, including, for example<br>
apoptosis.<br>
"Aurora kmase" refers to a member of the family of serine/threonine protein kinases that<br>
are generally referred to as "Aurora" kinases. The Aurora family of serine/threonine protein<br>
kinases are essential for cell proliferation (see, e.g., Bischhoff &amp; Plowman, 1999, Trends Cell<br>
Biol. 9:454-459; Giet &amp; Prigent, 1999, J. Cell Science 112:3591-3601; Nigg, 2001, Nat. Rev.<br>
Mol. Cell Biol. 2:21 -32; Adams et al., 2001, Trends Cell Biol. 11:49-54). Presently, there are<br>
three known mammalian family members: Aurora-A ("2"), Aurora-B ("1") and Aurora-C ("3")<br>
(see, e.g., Giet &amp; Prigent, 1999,1 Cell Sci. 112:3591-3601; Bischoff &amp; Plowman, 1999, Trends<br>
Cell BioL 9:454-459). As used herein, "Aurora kinase" includes not only these three known<br>
mammalian family members, but also later-discovered mammalian family members and<br>
homologous proteins from other species and organisms (for non-limiting examples of<br>
homologous members of the Aurora kinase family from other species and organisms see<br>
Schumacher et al., 1998, J. Cell Biol. 143:1635-1646; Kimura et al., 1997, J. BioL Chem.<br>
272:13766-13771).<br>
"Aurora kjf "fff-'Wfiiflted process" or "Aurora kinase-mediated disease or disprder" refers<br>
to a cellular process, disease or disorder hi which an Aurora kinase plays a role. The Aurora<br>
kinases are believed to play a key role in protein phosphorylation events that regulate the mitotic<br>
phase of the cell cycle. The human Aurora kinases display distinct subcellular locations during<br>
mitosis. For example, Aurora-A is upregulated during the M phase of the cell cycle and localizes<br>
to the spindle pole during mitosis, suggesting involvement in centrosomal functions. While<br>
Aurora-A activity is maximized during prophase, Aurora-B is believed to play an important role<br>
during chromatid separation and formation of the cleavage furrow in anaphase and telophase. The<br>
role of Aurora-C is less clear, but it has been shown to localize to centrosomes during mitosis<br>
from anaphase to cytokinesis. Moreover, inhibition of Aurora kinase activity in mammalian cells<br>
leads to abnormal cell growth and polyploidy (Terada et al., 1998, EMBO J. 17:667-676). Thus,<br>
Aurora kinases are thought to regulate ceil division, chromosome segregation, mitotic spindle<br>
formation, and cytokinesis. As used herein, all of these various processes are within the scope of<br>
"Aurora kinases-mcdiated process."<br>
Moreover, since its discovery in 1997, the mammalian Aurora kinase family has been<br>
closely linked to tumorigenesis. The most compelling evidence for this is that over-expression of<br>
Aurora-A transforms rodent fibroblasts (Bischoff et al., 1998, EMBO J. 17:3052-3065). Cells<br>
with elevated levels of this kinase contain multiple centrosomes and multipolar spindles, and<br>
rapidly become aneuploid. The oncogenic activity of Aurora kinases is likely to be linked to the<br>
generation of such genetic instability. Indeed, a correlation between amplification of the aurora-A<br>
locus and chromosomal instability in mammary and gastric tumors has been observed (Miyoshi et<br>
al., 2001, Int. J, Cancer 92:370-373; Sakakura et al., 2001, Brit. J. Cancer 84:824-831).<br>
The Aurora kinases have been reported to be over-expressed in a wide range of human<br>
tumors. Elevated expression of Aurora-A has been detected in over 50% of colorectal (Bischoff et<br>
al., 1998, EMBO J. 17:3052-3065; Takahashi etal., 2000, Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 91:1007-1014),<br>
ovarian (Gritsko et al., 2003, Clinical Cancer Research 9:1420-1426, and gastric tumors<br>
(Sakakura, 2001, Brit. J. Cancer 84:824-831, and in 94% of invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the<br>
breast (Tanaka, 1999, Cancer Research. 59:2041-2044). High levels of Aurora-A have also been<br>
reported in renal, cervical, neuroblastoma, melanoma, lymphoma, pancreatic and prostate tumor<br>
cell lines (Bischoff et al, 1998, EMBO J. 17:3052-3065; Kimura et al., 1999, J. Biol. Chem.<br>
274:7334-7340; Zhou et al., 1998, Nature Genetics 20:189-193; Li et al., 2003, Clin Cancer Res.<br>
9(3):991-7). Amplification/overexpression of Aurora-A is observed in human bladder cancers<br>
and amplification of Aurora-A is associated with aneuploidy and aggressive clinical behavior<br>
(Sen et al, 2002, J Natl Cancer List. 94(17): 1320-9. Moreover, amplification of the aurora-A locus<br>
(20ql3) correlates with poor prognosis for patients with node-negative breast cancer (Isola et al.,<br>
1995, American Journal of Pathology 147:905-911). Aurora-B is highly expressed hi multiple<br>
human tumor cell lines, including leukemic cells (Katayama et al., 1998, Gene 244:1-7). Levels<br>
of this enzyme increase as a function of Duke's stage in primary colorectal cancers (Katayama et<br>
al., 1999, J. Nat'I Cancer Inst. 91:1160-1162). Aurora-C, which is normally only found in germ<br>
cells, is also over-expressed in a high percentage of primary colorectal cancers and in a variety of<br>
tumor cell lines including cervical adenocarcinoma and breast carcinoma cells (Kimura et al.,<br>
1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274:7334-7340; Takahashi et al., 2000, Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 91:1007-1014).<br>
In contrast, the Aurora family is expressed at a low level in the majority of normal tissues,<br>
the exceptions being tissues with a high proportion of dividing cells, such as the thymus and testis<br>
(Bischoffet al., 1998, EMBO J., 17:3052-3065).<br>
For a further review of the role(s) Aurora kinases play in proliferative disorders, see<br>
Bischhoff &amp; Plowman, 1999, Trends Cell Biol. 9:454-459; Giet &amp; Prigent, 1999, J. Cell Science<br>
112:3591-3601; Nigg, 2001, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2:21-32; Adams et al., 2001, Trends Cell<br>
Biol. 11:49-54 and Dutertre et al., 2002, Oncogene 21:6175-6183.<br>
Although over-expression of proteins by cancer cells is not always indicative that<br>
inhibition of the protein activity will yield anti-tumor effect, it has been confirmed in functional<br>
assays that at least the following types of tumor cells are sensitive to inhibition of Aurora kinase<br>
activity: prostate (DU145), cervical (Hela), pancreatic (Mia-Paca2, BX-PC3), histological<br>
leukemia (U937), lung adenocarinoma, lung epidermoid, small lung cell carcinoma, breast, renal<br>
carcinoma, Mo!T3 (all) and Molt4 (all).<br>
Based on the established role of Aurora kinases in a variety of cancers, examples of<br>
"Aurora kinases-mediated diseases and disorders" include, but are not limited to, melanoma,<br>
leukemia, and solid tumor cancers, such as, for example, colon, breast, gastric, ovarian, cervical,<br>
melanoma, renal, prostate, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic and bladder cancers.<br>
"Therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount of a compound sufficient to treat<br>
a specified disorder, or disease or one or more of its symptoms. In reference to tumorigenic<br>
proliferative disorders, a therapeutically effective amount comprises an amount sufficient to,<br>
among other things, cause the tumor to shrink, or to decrease the growth rate of the tumor.<br>
In many situations, standard treatments for tumorigenic proliferative disorder involves<br>
surgical interaction to remove the tumor(s), either alone or in combination with drug (chemo)<br>
and/or radiation therapies. As used herein, a "therapeutically effect amount" of a compound is<br>
intended to include an amount of compound that either prevents the recurrence of tumors in<br>
subjects that have had tumor(s) surgically removed, or slows the rate of recurrance of tumor(s) in<br>
such subjects.<br>
Accordingly, as used herein, amounts of compounds that provide therapeutic benefit<br>
adjunctive to another type of therapy, such as surgical intervention and/or treatment with other<br>
antiproliferative agents, including, for example, 5-fluorouracil, vinorelbine, taxol, vinblastine,<br>
cisplatin, topotecan, etc.), are included within the meaning of "therapeutically effective amount."<br>
"ProphvlacticaUv effective amounf " refers to an amount of a compound sufficient to<br>
prevent a subject from developing a specified disorder or disease. Typically, subjects in which<br>
prophylaxis is practiced are not suffering from the specified disorder or disease, but are<br>
recognized as being at an elevated risk for developing this disease or disorder based factors such<br>
as, but not limited to, diagnostic markers and family history.<br>
6.2 Stereoisomerically Enriched and Stereoisomerically Pure Compounds<br>
It has been recently discovered that certain N4-(3-aminocarbonylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-<br>
ene-2-yl)-N2-substituted phenyl-2s4-pyrimidinediamine compounds, represented by structural<br>
formula (I), below, are potent inhibitors of Aurora kinase activity and tumor cell proliferation in<br>
in vitro assays (see, e.g., application Serial No, 11/133,419 filed May 18,2005, copending<br>
application Serial No. ___ , entitled "StereoisomerieaUy Enriched p-Lactams Using<br>
Candida Antarctica," filed concurrently herewith (identified by attorney docket no. 375462-<br>
030US), and international application No. PCT/US05/17470 filed May 18,2005 and the priority<br>
applications referenced therein):<br>
Skilled artisans will appreciate that in structural formula (I), the stereochemistry at<br>
carbons 1,2,3 and 4 is unspecified, such mat the compounds according to structural formula (I)<br>
include eight diastereomers, illustrated by structural formulae (laXIh), below:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Hie compounds of structural formula (I) also include two cis racemates, represented by<br>
structural formulae (Ila) and (nb), and two trans racemates, represented by structural formulae<br>
(ma) and (nib), below:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The cis racemate of structural formula (fla) can be referred to as the 2-exo-3-exo<br>
racemate, and includes the (1R,2R,3S,4S) and (1S,2S,3R,4R) diastereomers of structural formulae<br>
(la) and (0)), respectively The cis racemate of structural formula (nb) can be refened to as the 2-<br>
endo-3-endo racemate, and includes the (1R, 2S, 3R, 4S) and (1S, 2R, 3S, 4R) diastereomers of<br>
structural formulae (Ic) and (Id), respectively. As described in more detail in the Examples<br>
section, for compounds in which R5 is fluoro, R1 is hydrogen, R2 is 4-methylpiperazin-l-yl and R3<br>
is methyl, these two cis racemates exhibit antiproliferative activity against a variety of different<br>
tumor cell lines in in vitro antiproliferation assays. However, this 2-exo-3-exo racemate<br>
(racemate rl) is approximately twenty-fold more potent than the corresponding 2-endo-3-endo<br>
racemate (racemate r2) in all cell lines tested with both racemates. Moreover, it has been<br>
discovered that the (1 R,2R,3S,4S) diastereomer of racemate rl is largely responsible for the<br>
potency of the racemate rl. When tested as isolated stereoisomers, this (IR,2R,3S,4S)<br>
diastereomer (designated the "a" diastereomer) generally exhibited ICSO's in the nanomolar<br>
range, whereas the (1 S,2S,3R,4R) diastereomer (designated the "b" enantiomer) generally<br>
exhibited ICSO's in the micromolar range against the same cell lines. Thus, in general, the<br>
(1R,2R,3S,4S) diastereomer of this compound is generally 1000-fold more potent man its<br>
corresponding (1 S,2S,3R,4R) enantiomer. It is also approximately 20-50 times more potent than<br>
the corresponding 2-endo-3-endo r2 racemate in the cell lines tested. The (1R,2R3S,4S)<br>
diastereomer exhibited similarly superior results compared to its (1S,2S,3R,4R) enantiomer in<br>
cell-based inhibition assays against Aurora kinase B. Based on the observed potency of this<br>
(1R,2R,3S,4S) diastereomer, it is expected that the full range of (1R^2R,3S,4S) diastereomers<br>
according to structural formula (la) will exhibit similarly superior potencies as compared to their<br>
corresponding (1 8,28,3 R,4R) enantiomers, 2-exo-3-exo racetnates, 2-endo-3-endo racemates and<br>
other corresponding diastereomers.<br>
Accordingly, provided herein are compounds that are enriched in this particularly potent<br>
(]R,2R,3S,4S) diastereomer. hi one embodiment, such stereoisomerically enriched compounds<br>
include compounds according to structural formula (I):<br>

In another embodiment, such stereoisomerically enriched compounds include 2-exo-3-exo<br>
cis racemates according to structural formula (Ila), wherein R', R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as previously<br>
defined for structural formula (I), that are enriched in the diastereomer of structural formula (fa),<br>
supra.<br>
As used herein, a compound is "enriched" in a particular diastereomer when that<br>
diastereomer is present in excess over any other diastereomer present in the compound. The<br>
actual percentage of the particular diastereomer comprising the compound will depend upon the<br>
number of other diastereomers present. As a specific example, a racernic mixture is "enriched" in<br>
a specified enantiomer when that enantiomer constitutes greater man 50% of the mixture.<br>
Regardless of the number of diastereomers present, a compound that is enriched in a particular<br>
diastereomer will typically comprise at least about 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or even more, of the<br>
specified diastereomer. The amount of enrichment of a particular diastereomer can be confirmed<br>
using conventional analytical methods routinely used by those of skill in the art, as will be<br>
discussed in more detail, below.<br>
In another embodiment, the stereoisomerically enriched compounds include compounds<br>
according to structural formula (la), supra, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as previously<br>
defined for structural formula (I), that are substantially free of the corresponding enantiomer<br>
and/or any other corresponding diastereomer. By "substantially free of is meant mat the<br>
compound comprises less than about 10% of the undesired diastereomers and/or enantiomers as<br>
established using conventional analytical methods routinely used by those of skill in the art<br>
(discussed in more detail below). In some embodiments, the amount of undesired stereoisomers<br>
may be less than 10%, for example, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1% or even less.<br>
Stereoisomerically enriched compounds that contain about 95% or more of the desired<br>
stereoisomer are referred to herein as "substantially pure" stereoisomers. Stereoisomerically<br>
enriched compounds that contain about 99% or more of the desired stereoisomer are referred to<br>
herein as "pure" stereoisomers. The purity of any stereoisomerically enriched compound<br>
(diastereoisomeric purity; % de) can be confirmed using conventional analytical methods, as will<br>
be described in more detail, below.<br>

Additional exemplary embodiments of compounds according to structural formula (I) that<br>
may be stereoisomerically enriched in the corresponding diastereomer of structural formula (la),<br>
supra, substantially free of any enantiomets and/or diastereomer thereof, and/or substantially pure<br>
or pure in the diastereomer of structural formula (la), supra, are illustrated in TABLE 1 , below:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
R5<br>
When specific diastereomers and/or racemic mixtures of specific compounds described<br>
herein, such as the compounds described in TABLEl, are intended, the compound number is<br>
followed by a letter specifying the specific diastereomer or racemic mixture as follows:<br>
Thus, as a specific example, the (1R,R,3S,4S) diastereomer of compound 60 is referred<br>
to as compound 60s.<br>
Those of ski]] in the art will appreciate that the stereoisomerically enriched compounds<br>
described herein may include functional groups that can be masked with progroups to create<br>
prodrugs. Such prodrugs are usually, but need not be, pharmacologically inactive until converted<br>
into their active drug form. For example, ester groups commonly undergo acid-catalyzed<br>
hydrolysis to yield the parent carboxylic acid when exposed to the acidic conditions of the<br>
stomach, or base-catalyzed hydrolysis when exposed to the basic conditions of the intestine or<br>
blood. Thus, when administered to a subject orally, stereoisomerically enriched compounds that<br>
include ester moieties may be considered prodrugs of their corresponding carboxylic acid,<br>
regardless of whether the ester form is pharmacologically active.<br>
Included within the scope of the invention are prodrugs of the various stereoisomerically<br>
enriched compounds described herein. In such prodrugs, any available functional moiety may be<br>
masked with a progroup to yield a prodrug. Functional groups within the stereochemically<br>
enriched compounds described herein that may be masked with progroups for inclusion in a<br>
promoiety include, but are not limited to, amines (primary and secondary), hydroxyls, sulfanyls<br>
(thiols), carboxyls, etc. Myriad progroups suitable for masking such functional groups to yield<br>
promoieties that are cleavable under die desired conditions of use are known in the art. All of<br>
these progroups, alone or in combinations, may be included in the stereoisomerically enriched<br>
prodrugs of the invention.<br>
In one illustrative embodiment, the stereoisomerically enriched prodrugs are compounds<br>
according to structural formulae (I), supra, in which Ra Rb and Rc may be, in addition to their<br>
previously-defined alternatives, a progroup, that are enriched in the corresponding diastereomer of<br>
structural formula (la), supra.<br>
Those of skill in the art will appreciate that many of the compounds and prodrugs<br>
described herein, as well as the various compound species specifically described and/or illustrated<br>
herein, may exhibit the phenomena of tautomerism and conformational isomerism. For example,<br>
the compounds and prodrugs may exist in several tautomeric forms, including the enol form, the<br>
keto form and mixtures thereof. As the various compound names, formulae and compound<br>
drawings within the specification and claims can represent only one of the possible tautomeric or<br>
conformational forms, it should be understood mat the invention encompasses any tautomers or<br>
conformational isomers, of the compounds or prodrugs having one or more of the utilities<br>
described herein, as well as mixtures of these various different isomeric forms. In cases of limited<br>
rotation around the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine core structure, atrop isomers are also possible and are<br>
also specifically included in the compounds and/or prodrugs of the invention.<br>
Depending upon the nature of the various subsdtuents, the stereoisomerically enriched<br>
compounds and prodrugs may be in the form of salts. Such salts include salts suitable for<br>
pharmaceutical uses ("pharmaceutically-acceptable salts"), salts suitable for veterinary uses, etc.<br>
Such salts may be derived from acids or bases, as is well-known in the art.<br>
In some embodiments, the salt is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Generally,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those salts that retain substantially one or more of the<br>
desired pharmacological activities of the parent compound and which are suitable for<br>
administration to humans. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include acid addition salts formed<br>
with inorganic acids or organic acids. Inorganic acids suitable for forming pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid addition salts include, by way of example and not limitation, hydrohalide acids<br>
(e.g., hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic, etc.), sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric<br>
acid, and the like. Organic acids suitable for forming pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition<br>
salts include, by way of example and not limitation, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic<br>
acid, hexanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, glycolic acid, oxalic acid, pyruvic acid, lactic<br>
acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid,<br>
palmitic acid, benzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl) benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid,<br>
alkylsulfonic acids (e.g., methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 1,2-ethane-disulfonic acid,<br>
2-hydroxyethanesulfbnic acid, etc.), arylsulfonic acids (e.g., benzenesulfonic acid,<br>
4-chlorobenzenesulf onic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4-toluenesulfonic acid,<br>
camphorsulfonie acid, etc.), 4-methylbicyclo[2.2.2]-oct-2-ene-l-carboxylic acid, glucoheptonic<br>
acid, 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, tertiary butylacetic acid, lauryl sulfuric acid,<br>
gluconic acid, glutamic acid, hydroxynaphthoic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, muconic acid,<br>
and the like.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts also include salts formed when an acidic proton present<br>
in the parent compound is either replaced by a metal ion (e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline<br>
earth metal ion or an aluminum ion) or coordinates with an organic base (e.g., ethanolamine,<br>
diethanoiamine, triethanolamine, N-memylglucamine, morpholine, piperidine, dimethylamine,<br>
diethylamine, etc.).<br>
The stereoisomerically enriched compounds and prodrugs, as well as the salts thereof,<br>
may also be in the form of hydrates, solvates and/or N-oxides, as are well-known in the art.<br>
Stereoisomeric enrichment and/or purity of compounds and prodrug described herein may<br>
be established by conventional analytical methods well known to those of skill in the art. For<br>
example, use of chiral NMR shift reagents, gas chromatographic analysis using chiral columns,<br>
high pressure liquid chromatographic analysis using chiral columns, formation of diastereomeric<br>
derivatives through reaction with chiral reagents and conventional analysis may be used to<br>
establish the stereoisomeric enrichment and/or purity of a specific stereoisomer. Alternatively,<br>
synthesis using starting materials of known stereoisomeric enrichment and/or purity may be used<br>
to establish the stereoisomeric enrichment and/or purity of the compounds described herein.<br>
Other analytical methods for demonstrating stereoisomeric homogeneity are well within the ambit<br>
of the skilled artisan.<br>
6.3 Methods of Synthesis<br>
The stereoisomerically enriched compounds and prodrugs may be synthesized via a<br>
variety of different synthetic routes using commercially available starting materials and/or starting<br>
materials prepared by conventional synthetic methods. A variety of exemplary synthetic routes<br>
that can be used to synthesize the stereoisomerically enriched compounds and prodrugs are<br>
described in WO 03/063794 and US 2004/0029902, the disclosures of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
For purposes of illustration, an exemplary synthetic scheme that can be used to synthesize<br>
the full range of compounds described herein is illustrated in Scheme (I), below:<br>
Scheme (I)<br>
(other hotogenaBng agants)<br>
hi Scheme (1), R1, R2, R3 and R5 are as previously defined for structural formula (I),<br>
supra, X is a halogen (e.g., F, Cl, Br or I), and each G is, independently of the other, selected<br>
from O and S. It should be noted that an "*" in aminocarboxamide 6 indicates that the particular<br>
stereocenter is not specified. Accordingly, those of skill in the art will appreciate that Scheme (1)<br>
may be used to prepare racemic diastereomeric mixtures, diastereomerically enriched mixtures of<br>
omDOunas according to structural formula (I), as well as stereoisomers of the compounds of<br>
structural formula (I) that are substantially free of other specified diastereomers.<br>
Referring to Scheme (I), uracil or thiouracil 2 is dihalogenated at the 2- and 4-positions<br>
using the standard halogenating agent POX3 (or other halogenating agents) under standard<br>
conditions to yield 2,4-bis-halo pyrimidine 4. The halide at the C4 position is more reactive<br>
towards nucleophiles than the halide at the C2 position in pyrimidine 4. This differential<br>
reactivity can be exploited to synthesize the compounds and prodrugs described herein by first<br>
reacting 2,4-bis-halopyrimidine 4 with one equivalent of 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-3-<br>
carboxamide 6, yielding 8, followed by reaction with aniline 10 to yield compounds according to<br>
structural formula (I). Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the stereoisomeric<br>
configuration and optical purity of aminocarboxamide 6 will, in most circumstances, determine<br>
the stereoisomeric configuration and optical purity of the compounds of structural formula (I).<br>
In most situations, the C4 halide is more reactive towards nucleophiles, as illustrated in<br>
the Scheme. However, as will be recognized by skilled artisans, the identity of the R5 substituent<br>
may alter this reactivity. For example, when Rs is trifluoromethyl, a 50:50 mixture of<br>
4N-substituted-4-pyrimidinearnine 8 and the corresponding 2N-substituted-2-pyrimidineamine is<br>
obtained. Regardless of the identity of the Rs substituent, the regioselectivity of the reaction can<br>
be controlled by adjusting the solvent and other synthetic conditions (such as temperature), as is<br>
well-known in the art.<br>
The reactions depicted in Scheme (I) may proceed more quickly when the reaction<br>
mixtures are heated via microwave. When heating in this fashion, the following conditions may<br>
be used: heat to 17S°C in ethanol for 5-20 min. in a Smith Reactor (Personal Chemistry, Biotage<br>
AB, Sweden) in a sealed tube (at 20 bar pressure).<br>
The uracil or thiouracil 2 starting materials may be purchased from commercial sources 01<br>
prepared using standard techniques of organic chemistry. Commercially available uracils and<br>
thiouracils that can be used as starting materials in Scheme (I) include, by way of example and not<br>
limitation, uracil (Aldrich #13,078-8; CAS Registry 66-22-8); 2-thio-uracil (Aldrich #11,558-4;<br>
CAS Registry 141-90-2); 2,4-dithiouracil (Aldrich #15,846-1; CAS Registry 2001-93-6);<br>
5-bromouracil (Aldrich #85,247-3; CAS Registry 51-20-7; 5-fluorouracil (Aldrich #85,847-1;<br>
CAS Registry 51-21-8); 5-iodouracil (Aldrich #85,785-8; CAS Registry 696-07-1); 5-nitrouracil<br>
(Aldrich #85,276-7; CAS Registry 611-08-5); 5-(trifluoromethyl)-uracil (Aldrich #22,327-1; CAS<br>
Registry 54-20-6). Additional 5-suostituted uracils and/or thiouracils are available from General<br>
Intermediates of Canada, Inc., Edmonton, CA (http://www.generalintermediates.com) and/or<br>
Interchim, Cedex, France (http://www.interchim.com), or may be prepared using standard<br>
techniques. Myriad textbook references teaching suitable synthetic methods are provided infra.<br>
Anilines 10 may be purchased from commercial sources or, alternatively, may be<br>
synthesized utilizing standard techniques. For example, suitable anilines may be synthesized<br>
from nitro precursors using standard chemistry. Specific exemplary reactions are provided in the<br>
Examples section. See also Vogel, 1989, Practical Organic Chemistry, Addison Wesley<br>
Longman, Ltd. and John Wiley &amp; Sons, be.<br>
Skilled artisans will recognize that in some instances anilines 10 may include functional<br>
groups that require protection during synthesis. The exact identity of any protecting group(s)<br>
used will depend upon the identity of the functional group being protected, and will be apparent to<br>
these of skill in the art. Guidance for selecting appropriate protecting groups, as well as synthetic<br>
strategies for their attachment and removal, may be found, for example, in Greene &amp; Wuts,<br>
Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3d Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York (1999)<br>
and the references cited therein (hereinafter "Greene &amp; Wuts").<br>
Prodrugs as described herein may be prepared by routine modification of the<br>
above-described methods.<br>
As skilled artisans will appreciate, the desired (3 R,2R,3S,4S) diastereomer corresponding<br>
to structural formula (la), supra, can be isolated by chiral separation or other standard techniques.<br>
Methods for chirally resolving specific diastereomers are described in more detail in the Examples<br>
section.<br>
Stereoisomerically enriched compounds and/or substantially pure and/or pure<br>
diastereomers can also be synthesized from 2-amino-3-carboxamide storting materials 6 having<br>
specified stereochemistry, or with the aid of chiral auxiliaries.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment, illustrated in Scheme (IT), below, the desired diastereomer<br>
is resolved chemically using (R)-methyl-p-methoxybenzylamine 18 as a chiral auxiliary.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
to Scheme (II), 2-exo-3-exo racemic pMactam 14rl (prepared as described in Stajar et al.,<br>
1984, Tetrahedron 40(12): 2385) is protected with a Boc group, yielding the corresponding<br>
racemic Boc-protected p-lactam 16rl. Hoc-protected racemate 16rl is then reacted with<br>
(/?)-memyl-/?ora-methoxybenzylamine 18, yielding a mixture of diastereomers 20a and 20b. This<br>
diastereomeric mixture is treated with an acid such as TFA to cleave the Boc group, yielding a<br>
mixture of diastereomers 22a and 22b, which can be reacted with 2,4-dihalopyrimidine 4 to afford<br>
a racemic mixture of compounds 24a and 24b. At this stage, compounds 24a and 24b can be<br>
separated from one another by crystallization and reacted with aniline 10 to afford isolated<br>
diastereomers 25a and 25b. The chiral auxiliaries from isolated diasteromers 2Sa and 25b can<br>
then be cleaved to yield isolated diastereomers according to structural formulae (la) and (Ib),<br>
respectively.<br>
For compounds 25a and 25b in which R1 is hydrogen, R2 is 4-methyl-piperazin-l-yl, R3 is<br>
methyl and R5 is fluoro, cleavage of the chiral auxiliary proved difficult. For these and other<br>
compounds where such cleavage proves difficult, the chiral auxiliary can be cleaved from<br>
compounds 24a and 24b, and the resultant isolated compounds reacted with aniline 10 to yield<br>
isolated diastereomers according to structural formulae (la) and (Ib). Specific examples of such<br>
reactions are described in the Examples section.<br>
Compounds that are stereoisomerically enriched, substantially stereoisomerically pure<br>
and/or stereoisomerically pure in specified diastereomers can also be synthesized from<br>
stereoisomerically enriched, substantially stereoisomerically pure, and/or stereoisomerically pure<br>
p-lactams. Such stereoisomerically enriched and/or (substantially) stereoisomerically pure<br>
P-lactams can be enzymatically resolved and isolated, m one exemplary embodiment,<br>
(substantially) stereoisomerically pure P-lactams can be resolved and isolated from a racemic<br>
mixture of 2-exo-3-exo P-lactam 14rl using an immobilized lipolase (available from Sigma<br>
Chemical Co., catalog no. L4777) as described in Eniko et al., 2004, Tetrahedron Asymmetry<br>
15:573-575. In another exemplary embodiment, (substantially) stereoisomerically pure P-lactams<br>
can be resolved and isolated from 2-exo-3-exo Boc-protected racemic p-lactam 16rl using resin<br>
bound, immobilized chirazyme L-2-type B, c.f. enzyme (Candida antarctica Type B, c-f,<br>
available from Biocatalytics, Inc., Pasadena, CA) as described in application Serial<br>
No. 60/628,401, filed November 15, 2004, co-pending application Serial No. 11/133,419 filed<br>
May 18,2005, and international application No. PCT/US05/17470 filed May 18,2005, and<br>
copending application Serial No. , entitled "Stereoisomerically Enriched PLactams<br>
Using Candida Antarctica," filed concurrently herewith (identified by attorney docket<br>
no. 375462-030US), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. A specific<br>
example of the use of this enzyme to resolve specified diastereomers of p-lactams is described in<br>
the Examples section, as is a method of synthesizing 2-exo-3-exo racemic p-lactam 16rl.<br>
Examples of synthesizing specified diasteromers according to structural formula (la)<br>
utilizing enzyme reactions are illustrated in Schemes (HI) and (IV), below. A specific example of<br>
the use of Novozyme 435 enzyme as illustrated in Scheme (IV), which like the Chirazyme enyme<br>
discussed supra and illustrated in Scheme (III), can be used to resolve enantiomers from racemic<br>
p-lactams, is described in the Examples section.<br>

6.4 Activity of the Antiproliferative Compounds<br>
Active stereoisomerically enriched compounds typically inhibit proliferation of desired<br>
cells, such as tumor cells, with an IC5o in the range of about 20 μM or less, as measured in a<br>
standard in vitro cellular proliferation assay. Of course, skilled artisans will appreciate that<br>
compounds which exhibit lower ICsoS, for example on the order of 10 uM, 1 μM, 100 μM, 10 nM,<br>
1 nM, or even lower, may be particularly useful in therapeutic applications. The antiproliferative<br>
activity may be cytostatic or it may be cytotoxic. In instances where antiproliferative activity<br>
specific to a particular cell type is desired, the compound may be assayed for activity with the<br>
desired cell type and counter-screened for a lack of activity against other cell types. The desired<br>
degree of "inactivity" in such counter screens, or the desired ratio of activity vs. inactivity may<br>
vary for different situations, and may be selected by the user.<br>
Active compounds also typically inhibit an activity of an Aurora kinase, with an IC50 in<br>
the range of about 20 uM or less, typically in the range of about 10 uM, 1 uM, 100 nM, 10 mM,<br>
1 mM, or even lower. The IC50 against an aurora kinase can be determined in a standard hi vitro<br>
assay with an isolated aurora kinase, or in a functional cellular array. A suitable enzyme coupled<br>
assay that can be used to determine the degree of Aurora kinase activity is described in Fox et al.,<br>
1998, Protein Sci. 7:2249-2255. Kemptide peptide sequence LRRASLG (Bochern Ltd., UK) can<br>
be used as a substrate for Aurora kinase-A Aurora kinase-B and/or Aurora kinase-C, and reactions<br>
can be carried out at 30°C in a solution containing 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM Mg C12,25<br>
mM NaCl, 1 mM D1T. ICso values can be determined using computerized non-linear regression<br>
with commercially-available software (e.g., Prism 3.0, GraphPed Software, San Diego, CA). A<br>
suitable cell-based functional assay is described in the Examples section.<br>
6.5 Uses of the Antiproliferative Compounds<br>
The active stereoisomerically enriched compounds, including the various prodrugs, salts,<br>
hydrates and/or N-oxide forms thereof, may be used to inhibit Aurora kinases, Aurora kinasemediated<br>
processes, and/or cell proliferation in a variety of contexts. According to some<br>
embodiments, a cell or population of cells is contacted with an amount of such a compound<br>
effective to inhibit an activity of an Aurora kinase, an Aurora kinase-mediated process and/or<br>
proliferation of the cell or cell population. When used to inhibit cellular proliferation, the<br>
compound may act cytotoxically to kill the cell, or cytostatically to inhibit proliferation without<br>
killing the cell.<br>
In some embodiments, the methods may be practiced in vivo as a therapeutic approach<br>
towards the treatment or prevention of Aurora kinase-mediated diseases or disorders, and in<br>
particular proliferative disorders. Thus, in a specific embodiment, the stereoisomerically enriched<br>
compounds described herein, (and the various forms described herein) may be used to treat or<br>
prevent proliferative disorders in animal subjects, including humans. The method generally<br>
zomprises administering to the subject an amount of a stereoisomerically enriched compound, or a<br>
prodrug, salt, hydrate or N-oxide thereof, effective to treat or prevent the disorder. In one<br>
embodiment, the subject is a mammal, including, but not Umited to, bovine, horse, feline, canine,<br>
rodent, or primate. In another embodiment, the subject is a human.<br>
A variety of cellular proliferative disorders may be treated or prevented with the<br>
compounds described herein. In some embodiments, the compounds are used to treat various<br>
cancers in afflicted subjects. Cancers are traditionally classified based on the tissue and cell type<br>
from which the cancer cells originate. Carcinomas are considered cancers arising from epithelial<br>
cells while sarcomas are considered cancers arising from connective tissues or muscle. Other<br>
cancer types include leukemias, which arise from hematopoietic cells, and cancers of nervous<br>
system cells, which arise from neural tissue. For non-invasive tumors, adenomas are considered<br>
benign epithelial tumors with glandular organization while chondomas are benign tumor arising<br>
from cartilage. In the present invention, the described compounds may be used to treat<br>
proliferative disorders encompassed by carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemias, neural cell tumors, and<br>
non-invasive tumors.<br>

conditions described above, but encompasses other disorders characterized by uncontrolled<br>
growth and malignancy. It is further understood that proliferative disorders include various<br>
metastatic forms of the tumor and cancer types described herein. The compounds of the present<br>
invention may be tested for effectiveness against the disorders described herein, and a<br>
therapeutically effective regimen established. Effectiveness, as further described below, includes<br>

6.6 Combination Therapies<br>
The stereoisomerically enriched compounds described herein may be used alone, in<br>
combination with one another, or as an adjunct to, or in conjunction with, other established<br>
antiproliferative therapies. Thus, the compounds may be used with traditional cancer therapies,<br>

6.7 Formulations and Administration<br>
When used to treat or prevent such diseases, the active compounds and prodrugs may be<br>
administered smgly, as mixtures of one or more active compounds, or in mixture or combination<br>
with other agents useful for treating such diseases and/or the symptoms associated with such<br>
diseases. The active compounds and prodrugs may also be administered in mixture or in<br>
combination with agents useful to treat other disorders or maladies, such as steroids, membrane<br>
stabilizers. The active compounds or prodrugs may be administered/jer^e, or as pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising an active compound or prodrug.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the active compounds (or prodrugs thereof) may<br>
be manufactured by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making<br>
levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilization processes. The compositions<br>
may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers,<br>
diluents, excipients or auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into<br>
preparations which can be used pharmaceutically (see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 15th<br>
Ed., Hoover, J.E. ed.. Mack Publishing Co. (2003)<br>
The active compound or prodrug may be formulated in the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
per se, or in the form of a hydrate, solvate, N-oxide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, as<br>
previously described. Typically, such salts are more soluble in aqueous solutions than the<br>
corresponding free acids and bases, but salts having lower solubility than the corresponding free<br>
acids and bases may also be formed.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions may take a form suitable for virtually any mode of<br>
administration, including, for example, topical, ocular, oral, buccal, systemic, nasal, injection,<br>
transdermal, rectal, vaginal, etc., or a form suitable for administration by inhalation or<br>
insufflation.<br>

solutions, geis, ointments, creams, suspensions, etc. as are well-known in the art.<br>
Systemic formulations include those designed for administration by injection, e.g.,<br>
subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal or intraperitoneal injection, as well as those<br>
designed for transdermaJ, transmucosal oral or pulmonary administration.<br>
Useful injectable preparations include sterile suspensions, solutions or emulsions of the<br>
active compounds) in aqueous or oily vehicles. The compositions may also contain formulating<br>
agents, such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agent. The formulations for injection<br>
may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multidose containers, and may<br>
contain added preservatives.<br>
Alternatively, the injectable formulation may be provided in powder form for<br>
reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, including but not limited to sterile pyrogen free water,<br>
buffer, dextrose solution, etc., before use. To this end, the active compound(s) may be dried by<br>
any art-known technique, such as lyophilization, and reconstituted prior to use.<br>
For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are<br>
used in the formulation. Such penetrants are known in the art.<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for<br>
example, lozenges, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline<br>
cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica);<br>
disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g., sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate, lecithin). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art with, for<br>
example, sugars, films or enteric coatings.<br>
Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, elixirs,<br>
solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with<br>
water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by<br>
conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g.,<br>
sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin<br>
or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol, cremophore™ or<br>
fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or<br>
sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer salts, preservatives, flavoring, coloring and<br>
sweetening agents as appropriate.<br>
Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release<br>
of the active compound or prodrug, as is well known in the art<br>
For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges<br>
formulated in conventional manner.<br>
For rectal and vaginal routes of administration, the active compound(s) may be<br>
formulated as solutions (for retention enemas) suppositories or ointments containing conventional<br>
suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
For nasal administration or administration by inhalation or insufflation, the active<br>
compound(s) or prodrug(s) can be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from<br>
pressurized packs or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g.,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, fluorocarbons,<br>
carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be<br>
determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount Capsules and cartridges for use in<br>
an inhaler or insufflator (for example capsules and cartridges comprised of gelatin) may be<br>
formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose<br>
or starch.<br>
For ocular administration, the active compound(s) or prodrug(s) may be formulated as a<br>
solution, emulsion, suspension, etc. suitable for administration to the eye. A variety of vehicles<br>
suitable for administering compounds to the eye are known in the art Specific non-limiting<br>
examples are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,261,547; U.S. Patent No. 6,197,934; U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,056,950; U.S. Patent No. 5,800,807; U.S. Patent No. 5,776,445; U.S. Patent No. 5,698,219; U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,521,222; U.S. Patent No. 5,403,841; U.S. Patent No. 5,077,033; U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,882,150; and U.S. Patent No. 4,738,851.<br>
For prolonged delivery, the active compound(s) or prodrug(s) can be formulated as a<br>
depot preparation for administration by implantation or intramuscular injection. The active<br>
ingredient may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobia materials (e.g., as an<br>
emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, e.g., as a<br>
sparingly soluble salt Alternatively, transdermal delivery systems manufactured as an adhesive<br>
disc or patch which slowly releases the active compound(s) for percutaneous absorption may be<br>
used. To this end, permeation enhancers may be used to facilitate transdermal penetration of die<br>
active compound(s). Suitable transdermal patches are described in for example, U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,407,713; U.S. Patent No. 5,352,456; U.S. Patent No. 5,332,213; U.S. Patent No. 5,336,168; U.S.<br>

U.S. Patent No. 4,921,475.<br>
Alternatively, other pharmaceutical delivery systems may be employed. Liposomes and<br>
emulsions are well-known examples of delivery vehicles that may be used to deliver active<br>
compound(s) or prodrug(s). Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) may<br>
also be employed, although usually at the cost of greater toxicity.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser<br>
device which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active compound(s). The<br>
pack may, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or<br>
dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration.<br>
6.8 Effective Dosages<br>
The active compound(s) or prodrug(s), or compositions thereof, will generally be used in<br>
an amount effective to achieve the intended result, for example in an amount effective to treat or<br>
prevent the particular disease being treated. The compound(s) may be administered<br>
therapeutically to achieve therapeutic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or<br>
amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated and/or eradication or amelioration of one or<br>
more of the symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that the patient reports an<br>
improvement in feeling or condition, notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with<br>
the underlying disorder. Therapeutic benefit also includes halting or slowing the progression of<br>
the disease, regardless of whether improvement is realized.<br>
The amount of compound administered will depend upon a variety of factors, including,<br>
for example, the particular indication being treated, the mode of administration, the severity of the<br>
indication being treated and the age and weight of the patient, the bioavailability of the particular<br>
active compound, etc. Determination of an effective dosage is well within the capabilities of<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
Effective dosages may be estimated initially from in vitro assays. For example, an initial<br>
dosage for use in animals may be formulated to achieve a circulating blood or serum<br>
concentration of active compound that is at or above an IC50 of the particular compound as<br>
measured in an in vitro assay, such as the in vitro assays described in the Examples section.<br>
Calculating dosages to achieve such circulating blood or serum concentrations taking into account<br>
the bioavailability of the particular compound is well within the capabilities of skilled artisans.<br>
For guidance, the reader is referred to Fingl &amp; Woodbury, "General Principles," In: Goodman<br>
and Oilman "s The Pharmaceutical Basis of Therapeutics, Chapter 1, pp. 1-46, latest edition,<br>
Pergamon Press, and the references cited therein.<br>
Initial dosages may also be estimated from in vivo data, such as animal models. Animal<br>
models useful for testing the efficacy of compounds to treat or prevent the various diseases<br>
described above are well-known in the art. Dosage amounts will typically be in the range of from<br>
about 0.0001 or 0.001 or 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 100 mg/kg/day, but may be higher or lower,<br>
depending upon, among other factors, the activity of the compound, its bioavailability, the mode<br>
of administration and various factors discussed above. Dosage amount and interval may be<br>
adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the compound(s) which are sufficient to<br>
maintain therapeutic or prophylactic effect. For example, the compounds may be administered<br>
once per week, several times per week (e.g., every other day), once per day or multiple times per<br>
day, depending upon, among other things, the mode of administration, the specific indication<br>
being treated and the judgment of the prescribing physician. In cases of local administration or<br>
selective uptake, such as local topical administration, the effective local concentration of active<br>
compound(s) may not be related to plasma concentration. Skilled artisans will be able to optimize<br>
effective local dosages without undue experimentation.<br>
Preferably, the compound(s) will provide therapeutic or prophylactic benefit without<br>
causing substantial toxic ity. Toxicity of the compound(s) may be determined using standard<br>
pharmaceutical procedures. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic (or prophylactic)<br>
LD5o/EDSo effect is the therapeutic index (LDso is the dose lethal to 50% of the population and<br>
EDso is the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). Compounds(s) that exhibit<br>
high therapeutic indices are preferred.<br>
6.9 Kits<br>
The compounds and/or prodrugs described herein may be assembled in the form of kits,<br>
hi some embodiments, the kit provides the compound(s) and reagents to prepare a composition<br>

particularly a sterile solution. When the composition is in a dry form, the reagent may comprise a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable diluent for preparing a liquid formulation. The kit may contain a<br>
device for administration or for dispensing the compositions, including, but not limited to syringe,<br>
pipette, transdermal patch, or inhalant<br>
The kite may include other therapeutic compounds for use in conjunction with the<br>
compounds described herein, hi some embodiments, the therapeutic agents are other anti-cancer<br>
and anti-neoplastic compounds. These compounds may be provided in a separate form, or mixed<br>
with the compounds of the present invention.<br>

Procedure: Parti: A solution of 2,5-norbornadiene 47 (25.0 mL, 0.246 mole) in<br>
CH2C12 (110 ml,, fresh bottle) was cooled in an ice/NaCl bath (-10 °C). To this was added dropwise<br>
a solution of CSI (21.4 mL, 0.246 mole) in CH2C12 (45 mL, fresh bottle) at a rate to maintain<br>
the temperature below 5°C (the addition took approx. 1.25 hr.). Upon completion of the addition,<br>
the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 hour at 0-5°C and then removed from the cooling bath and<br>
allowed to warm to 20°C. The reaction mixture was quenched with water (60 mL) and vigorously<br>
stirred for several minutes. The organic layer was separated, washed with brine, and dried with<br>
NaaSCV Concentration gave light brown oil.<br>
Part 2: A mixture of Na2SOs (24.5 g), water (70 mL), and CH2C12 (30 mL) was cooled in<br>
an ice/NaCl bath. The oil from Part 1 was diluted to lOOmL with CH2C12 and added dropwise to<br>
the above mixture at a rate to maintain the temperature below 15°C (the addition took approx.<br>
1.75 hr). The pH of the reaction mixture was monitored with a pH meter and kept basic (pH 7-<br>
10) by adjusting with 10% NaOH (w/v) (as needed). Upon completion of the addition, the<br>
reaction mixture was stirred for 1 hour at 5-10°C (final pH was 8.5). The reaction mixture was<br>
poured into a separatory funnel and the CH2C12 layer separated. This organic phase was a thick<br>
and gelatinous solid suspension. It was diluted with water (approx. 400 mL) to make a more free<br>
flowing solution. The aqueous layer was further extracted with CH2C12 (4 x 100 mL).<br>

labeled with a fluorescent dye (secondary antibody donkey anti-mouse AlexFluor 488 (Invitrogen<br>
Molecular Probes; 1:2000) arid DAPI (1:15,000 of Img/ml stock) for 1 hr at room temperature,<br>
washed three times with DPBS (200 ul/well) and stored under DPBS (100 ul/well) at 4°C until<br>
ready for analysis.<br>
A Zeiss Axiovert SI00 inverted fluorescent microscope with a Plan-NEOFLUAR lOx<br>
objective, a Hamamatsu Lightningcure 200 Mercury-Xenon light source and an Omega Optical<br>
XF57 quad filter was used for all data collection. The system was equipped with a Ludl Mac2000<br>
motorized stage with X/Y/Z control, a Ludl filter wheel, a Zymark Twister robot arm and a<br>
Quantix digital camera from Roper Scientific. All hardware was controlled with ImagePro 4.5<br>
with the ScopePro/StagePro 4.1 module (Media Cybernetics) on a PC running Win2000. Visual<br>
Basic Scripts were written for ImagePro to automate hardware control and image collection.<br>
Focusing was performed with a software auto-focus routine contained with StagePro that used the<br>
maximum local contrast to determine the best plane of focus from a Z series captured once in each<br>
well. Once proper focus was achieved images were captured in a 3x3 grid pattern of adjacent<br>
images next to, but not including, the position of focusing. Images were captured and analyzed in<br>
12-bit format using segmentation and morphological routines contained in the Image Pro software<br>
package. Identified nuclei were counted and pixel data for each cell along with experimental<br>
conditions was stored in a database using MySQL 4.0.14. Subsequent analysis of experimental<br>
results and graph creation was done using Matlab 6.5.<br>
For phospho-histone H3 analysis the data is converted to Facs files and analysed using<br>
FlowJo. The percent Phospho-H3 cells are plotted at each compound concentration to determine<br>
an EC50 for Aurora B inhibition.<br>
Results. Compound 60a inhibited Aurora kinase-B with an ICso of about 7 nM in this<br>
assay. By contrast, the ICso of its enantiomer, compound 60b, was 2.49 uM, approx. 350 times<br>
greater.<br>
7.13 Phannacokinetics of Compound El in Monkeys<br>
ompound 60a was administered to monkeys intraveinously (1 mg/kg in saline) and orally<br>
(5 mg/kg in saline) and the plasma concentrations monitored over time. When administered by<br>
i.v., the plasma concentration of compound remained above the ICso of 7 nM for 11 hrs following<br>
administration; when administered orally, a plasma concentration of compound above the ICso<br>
was maintained for over 20 hrs.<br>
7.14 Compound 60a Shrinks Tumors In Vivo<br>
Compound 60a-2HCl, was tested for its ability to shrink A549 and Colo205 tumors in a<br>
standard xenograft therapeutic model in SCED mice, and Colo205 and MiaPaCa tumors in a<br>
standard xeuograph regression model in SCID mice. When palpable tumors appeared and were of<br>
a preselected volume (approx. 100 mm3 for treatment model; &gt;300 mm3 for regression model),<br>
the mice were administered test compounds in the amounts and according to the dosing regimens<br>
specified in TABLE 3 (treatment protocol) and TABLE 4 (regression protocol), below.<br>
(Table  Removed)<br>
Results. The inhibitory effects of Compound 60a-2HCl on Colo205 tumor growth in the<br>
treatment model are illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. The results of the daily dosing regimen are<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1; the results of the pulsed dosing regimens in FIG. 2. Both dosing regimens<br>
yielded significant (p
all dosage levels tested. A 549 tumors were less responsive to treatment resulting in an<br>
approximate 40% reduction hi mean tumor volume following a dosing regimen of S days on/2<br>
days off and a dose level of 10 rag/kg qd (p&gt;0.05).<br>
The inhibitory effects of Compound 60a-2HCl on Colo205 tumor growth in the<br>
regression model are illustrated in FIG. 3. The effects of Compound 60a-2HCI on MiaPaCa<br>
tumors in the regression model are illustrated in FIG. 4. Significant reductions in tumor growth<br>
rate were observed with both tumor lines. These reductions were independent of the mode of<br>
administration. Moreover, the reductions observed in MiaPaCa tumors were similar to those<br>
observed with taxol (see FIG. 4).<br>
