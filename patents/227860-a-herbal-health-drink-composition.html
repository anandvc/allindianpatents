				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a fermented herbal health drink, comprising extract<br>
from plant Andrographis, extract from barley, wheat, and/or fruit and ethanol<br>
concentration ranging between 3 to 13% in the total health drink and optionally extract<br>
from plant Tinospora and other additives, said drink not containing hops and still<br>
having characteristic taste of a beer with no adverse effect and contributing to several<br>
medicinal properties comprising anti-oxidant, nervine relaxant, cholerectic, cardiotonic,<br>
diurectic, digestive and immunomodulant, and a method of producing the herbal<br>
health drink, preferably a method of introducing bitterness into said health drink and<br>
using the same as a beer or to produce beer with said medicinal properties.<br>
Background Art<br>
Beer is an alcoholic beverage made from malted grains, hops, yeast and water. Fruit,<br>
herbs and spices are also used for flavors.<br>
In the distant past, the term beer and 'ale' meant different things - 'Ale' referred to drinkwithout<br>
using hops while 'beer' with hops. Since virtually all commercial products now use<br>
hops, obtained from the female strobiles of Himulus lupulus, a temperate growing plant,<br>
and cultivated in England, Germany, Belgium, France, Russia and California.<br>
In India it can be grown only in high attitude of Kashmir and Himalayas. The inventors<br>
undertook a critical study of wildly growing Indian medicinal plants, which are bitter in<br>
taste and can be a substitute of hops in alcoholic beverages, preferably in beer.<br>
Reference is made to website (http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/h/hops-<br>
32.html) wherein, recipes for herb beers like Dandelion, Nettle, Meadow, Sweet,-<br>
Yarrow hop and bitters are given. Hop Bitters are mentioned as appetizer and the Nettle<br>
Beer is often given as a remedy for gouty and rheumatic pains as shown in a website<br>
(http://www.botam'cal.com/botanical/mgnih/n/nettle.03.html').<br>

Diet or food therapy is emerging as the latest trend in health care programme. It is now<br>
believed that there will be more dieticians than physicians will in the present century,<br>
as many diseases can be prevented if the right kind of diet is prescribed. Consumption<br>
of the right kind of food articles and drinks suited to the climate, age and constitution.<br>
Nature of the individuals are getting greater scientific, with high stress on health<br>
protection. The rich and traditional diet practice is prevalent among various<br>
communities with the regional variations, which are now found to be health<br>
protective/promotive. Over 1000 different kinds of alcoholic drinks, soft drinks,<br>
beverages and medicinal drinks are traditionally consumed in India. But unfortunately,<br>
with the introduction of various exotic drinks, many of the local drinks, which are<br>
mostly plant based, are fast disappearing and some of them are totally forgotten.<br>

The medicinal plants used in the fermented herbal drink are reported to have<br>
antioxidant, immunomodulator, anti-fatigue and hepatoprotective properties. No<br>
commercial beer has the aforesaid properties.<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate the invention in accordance with the<br>
principles of this invention, but are not to be construed as limiting the invention in any<br>
way<br>
Example 1<br>
Mix 2.5kg of barley malt, 750g of sugar with 2.5 liters of distilled water. Add 40g of<br>
lower layer of Andrographis spp. extract 25g of yeast and keep the material in a<br>
fermenter for 48 hrs at a temperature of 30°C. After complete fermentation, filter the<br>
mixture and pasteurize, centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 15 minutes. Prepare the drink by<br>
adding 25ml of soda water to 15ml of the prepared beer. Add preservatives in the<br>

pasteurized. To get the transparent golden color the beer is centrifuged at 10,000 rpm<br>
for 30 minutes. To prepared a drink, 10ml of stock herbal drink is further diluted with<br>
25 ml of soda water. Add preservatives. Add tert-butyl hydroquinine as an anti-oxidant.<br>
Example 6<br>
Mix 20 litres of Mango juice with 6.4kg of sugar, add 20 liters of distilled water and<br>
autoclave the mixture. Add 2g of dried extract of Andrographis, 100ml of Sacromyces'<br>
