				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a particle motion sensor assembly for use in a seismic<br>
streamer cable. The present invention is related to marine geophysical exploration. More<br>
specifically, the invention is related to ser sors for detecting seismic signals and to marine seismic<br>
data gathering.<br>
2.	Description of Relevant Art<br>
In seismic exploration, geophysical data are obtained by applying acoustic energy to the earth<br>
at the surface and detecting seismic energy reflected from interfaces between different layers in<br>
subsurface formations. The seismic wave is reflected when there is a difference in impedance<br>
between the layer above the interface and the layer below the interface.<br>
In marine seismic exploration, a seismic shock generator, such as an airgun, for example, is<br>
commonly used to generate an acoustic pulse. The resulting seismic wave is reflected back from<br>
subsurface interfaces and detected by sensors deployed in the water or on the water bottom.<br>
In a typical marine seismic operation, a streamer cable is towed behind an exploration vessel<br>
at a water depth between about six to about nine meters. Hydrophones are included in the streamer<br>
cable for detecting seismic signals. A hydrophone is a submersible pressure gradient sensor that<br>
converts pressure waves into electrical signals that are typically recorded for signal processing, and<br>
evaluated to estimate characteristics of the earth's subsurface.<br>
After the reflected wave reaches the streamer cable, the wave continues to propagate to the<br>
water/air interface at the water surface, from which the wave is reflected downwardly, and is again<br>
detected by the hydrophones in the streamer cable. The reflection coefficient at the surface is nearly<br>
unity in magnitude and negative in sign. The seismic wave will be phase-shifted 180 degrees. The<br>
downwardly travelling wave is commonly referred to as the "ghost" signal, and the presence of this<br>
ghost reflection creates a spectral notch in the detected signal. Because of the spectral notch, some<br>
frequencies in the detected signal are amplified and some frequencies are attenuated.<br><br>
Because of the ghost reflection, the water surface acts like a filter, making it difficult<br>
to record data outside a selected bandwidth without excessive attenuation or notches in the<br>
recorded data.<br>
Maximum attenuation will occur at frequencies for which the distance between the<br>
detecting hydrophone and the water surface is equal to one-half wavelength. Maximum<br>
amplification will occur at frequencies for which the distance between the detecting<br>
hydrophone and the water surface is one-quarter wavelength. The wavelength of the acoustic<br>
wave is equal to the velocity divided by the frequency, and the velocity of an acoustic wave<br>
in water is about 1500 meters per second. Accordingly the location in the frequency<br>
spectrum of the resulting spectral notch is readily determinable. For example, for a streamer<br>
water depth of 7 meters, as illustrated by curve 54 in Figure 1, maximum attenuation will<br>
occur at a frequency of about 107 Hz. and maximum amplification will occur at a frequency<br>
of about 54 Hz.<br>
It has not been practical to tow cables deeper than about 9 meters because the location<br>
of the spectral notch in the frequency spectrum of the signal detected by a hydrophone<br>
substantially diminishes the utility of the recorded data. It has also not been practical to tow<br>
cables at a depth shallower than about 6 meters, because the ghost signal reflected from the<br>
water surface substantially attenuates the signal detected by a hydrophone within the<br>
frequency band of interest.<br>
It is also common to perform marine seismic operations in which in which sensors are<br>
deployed on the water bottom. Such operations are typically referred to as "ocean bottom<br>
seismic" operations. In ocean bottom seismic operations, both hydrophones and geophones<br>
are employed for recording the seismic data, with the geophone normally being placed in<br>
direct contact with the ocean bottom. To improve the contact between the geophone and the<br>
ocean floor, the geophone assembly is typically made to be quite heavy, with a typical<br>
density of between 3 and 7 grams per cubic centimeter.<br>
A geophone detects a particle velocity signal, whereas the hydrophone detects a<br>
pressure gradient signal. The geophone has directional sensitivity, whereas the hydrophone<br>
does not. Accordingly, the upgoing wavefield signals detected by the geophone and the<br>
hydrophone will be in phase, but the downgoing wavefield signals detected by the geophone<br>
and the hydrophone will be 180 degrees out of phase. Various techniques have been<br>
proposed for using this phase difference to reduce the spectral notch caused by the ghost<br>
reflection.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,486,865 to Ruehle, for example, teaches a system said to suppress<br>
ghost reflections by combining the outputs of pressure and velocity detectors. The detectors<br>
are paired, one pressure detector and one velocity detector in each pair. A filter is said to<br>
change the frequency content of at least one of the detectors so that the ghost reflections<br>
cancel when the outputs are combined.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,621,700 to Moldovenu also teaches using at least one sensor pair<br>
comprising a pressure sensor and a velocity sensor in an ocean bottom cable in a method for<br>
attenuating ghosts and water layer reve •berations.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,935,903 to Sanders et al. teaches a marine seismic reflection<br>
prospecting system that detects seismic waves traveling in water by pressure sensor-particle<br>
velocity sensor pairs (e.g., hydrophore-geophone pairs) or alternatively vertically-spaced<br>
pressure sensors. Instead of filtering to eliminate ghost reflection data, the system calls for<br>
enhancing primary reflection data for use in pre-stack processing by adding the ghost data.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,979,150 provides a method for marine seismic prospecting said to<br>
attenuate coherent noise resulting from water column reverberation by applying a scale factor<br>
to the output of a pressure transducer and a particle velocity transducer positioned<br>
substantially adjacent one another in the water. In this method, the transducers may be<br>
positioned either on the ocean bottom or at a location in the water above the bottom, although<br>
the ocean bottom is said to be preferred.<br>
Four component system have also been utilized on the sea floor, A four component<br>
system utilizes a hydrophone for detecting a pressure signal, together with a three-component<br>
geophone for detecting particle velocity signals in three orthogonal directions: vertical, in-<br>
line and cross line. The vertical geophone output signal is used in conjunction with the<br>
hydrophone signal to compensate for the surface reflection. The three orthogonally<br>
positioned geophones are used for detecting shear waves, including the propagation direction<br>
of the shear waves.<br>
The utility of simultaneously recording pressure and vertical particle motion in marine<br>
seismic operations has long been recogn zed. However, a geophone (or accelerometer) for<br>
measuring vertical particle motion must be maintained in a proper orientation in order to<br>
accurately detect the signal. Maintaining such orientation is non-trivial in a marine streamer<br>
and significantly more problematic than maintaining such orientation on the ocean bottom.<br>
Exploration streamers towed behind marine vessels are typically over one mile in length.<br>
Modern marine seismic streamers may use more than 10,000 transducers. To maintain a<br><br>
particle velocity sensor (a geophone or accelerometer) in proper orientation to detect vertical motion,<br>
the prior art has proposed various solutions. The use of gimbals has been proposed repeatedly. One<br>
example is a "gimbal lock system for seismic sensors" described in U.S. Patent No. 6,061,302 to<br>
Brink et al. Another example is a "dual gimbal geophone" described in U.S. Patent No. 5,475,652 to<br>
McNeel et al. Still another example is a "self-orienting directionally sensitive geophone" described<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 4,618,949 to Lister. Nevertheless, no streamers containing both hydrophone and<br>
geophones are in commercial use.<br>
In addition to the problem of maintaining orientation, severe noise from streamer cables has<br>
been considered prohibitive to use of particle velocity sensors in streamers. Because the voltage<br>
output signal from particle velocity sensors is normally not as strong as the output signal from<br>
hydrophones, the noise level in streamer cables has been a detriment to the use of particle velocity<br>
sensors.<br>
In ocean bottom cables, the sensors are located on the sea floor and therefore are less<br>
exposed to noise generated by vibrations in the cable. Geophones are typically gimbaled to ensure a<br>
correct direction and are made of heavy brass or similar material to ensure good contact with the sea<br>
floor. The geophone housing is typically filled with fluid to improve the coupling between the sensor<br>
and the sea floor. However, because of the variation in properties of the sea floor from location to<br>
location, impedance mismatch between the sea floor and the sensor and sensor housing can cause<br>
problems. Such mismatch in impedance can cause various types of distortion in both the hydrophone<br>
signal and the geophone signal. Also, the boundary effects for the hydrophone and the geophone due<br>
to their closeness to the sea floor can change the response for the hydrophone and the geophone,<br>
giving rise to a need to correct the amplitude values in processing to be able to use the signal for<br>
elimination of the surface "ghost" reflection.<br>
Accordingly a need continues to exis for an improved system for gathering marine seismic<br>
data.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to overcome the disadvantages of prior art, the present invention provides a particle<br>
motion sensor assembly for use in a seismic streamer cable, comprising :<br>
a housing ;<br>
a particle motion sensor gimbal-mounted in said housing ;<br>
a fluid within said housing substantially surrounding said particle motion sensor, said fluid<br>
having a viscosity providing sufficient damping of sensor movement to reduce noise while enabling<br>
sufficient movement of said sensor to maintain said sensor in a desired orientation as said housing is<br>
rotated;<br>
wherein said particle motion sensor assembly is constructed from components selected so<br>
that said particle motion sensor assembly las an acoustic impedance within the range of about<br>
750,000 Newton seconds per cubic meter to about 3,000,000 Newton seconds per cubic meter ; and<br>
wherein said particle motion sensor assembly has a configuration that enables said particle<br>
motion sensor assembly to be mounted within an internal diameter of a seismic streamer cable having<br>
an internal diameter no greater than about 66 millimeters.<br>
In one embodiment the invention comprises a particle velocity sensor that includes a housing<br>
with a geophone mounted in the housing. A fluid that substantially surrounds the geophone is<br>
included within the housing. The particle velocity sensor has an acoustic impedance within the range<br>
of about 750,000 Newton seconds per cubic meter ( Ns/m3 ) to about 3,000,000 Newton seconds per<br>
cubic meter (Ns/m3).<br>
This specification also discloses a method of geophysical exploration in which a seismic<br>
signal is generated in a body of water and detected with a plurality of co-located particle velocity<br>
sensors and pressure gradient sensors positioned within a seismic cable deployed in the body of<br>
water. The output signal of either or both of the particle velocity sensors or the pressure gradient<br>
sensors is modified to substantially equalize the output signals from the particle velocity sensors and<br>
the pressure gradient sensors within at least a selected frequency range. The output signals from co-<br>
located particle velocity sensors and pressure gradient sensors are then combined.<br><br>
The specification, in addition, discloses a method of processing marine seismic data to<br>
reduce spectral notches resulting from surface ghost reflections in which the amplitude and phase<br>
variation with frequency of the output of a particle velocity sensor of a co-located particle velocity<br>
sensor and pressure gradient sensor pair is determined independently of any variation in amplitude or<br>
phase with frequency of the particle velocity sensor output resulting from impedance mismatch<br>
between the particle velocity sensor and a medium from which a seismic wave is coupled to the<br>
particle velocity sensor. The output signal of one or both of the particle velocity sensors or pressure<br>
gradient sensors is modified to compensate for the determined amplitude and phase variation to<br>
generate modified output signals. The modified output signals are then summed.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a typical geophysical exploration configuration in which a<br>
plurality of streamer cables 30 are towed behind vessel 32. One or more seismic sources 34<br>
are also normally towed behind the vessel. The seismic source, which typically is an airgun,<br>
but may also be a water gun or other type of source known to those of ordinary skill in the<br>
art, transmits seismic energy or waves into the earth and the waves are reflected back by<br>
reflectors in the earth and recorded by sensors in the streamers. Paravanes 35 are utilized to<br>
maintain the cables 30 in the desired lateral position. The invention may also be<br>
implemented, however, in seismic cables that are maintained at a substantially stationary<br>
position in a body of water, either floating at a selected depth or lying on the bottom of the<br>
body of water, in which case the source may be towed behind a vessel to generate shock<br>
waves at varying locations, or the source may also be maintained in a stationary position.<br>
Seismic sensors, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention are deployed in<br>
streamer cables, such as cables 30.<br>
In a particular implementation, the present invention comprises a particle velocity<br>
sensor in the form of a geophone assembly. Such a geophone assembly is shown in Figures 3<br>
and 4. Figure 3 shows the geophone assembly 3 with the parts exploded or separated out for<br>
illustration. Figure 4 shows a cross section of the geophone assembly 3 of Figure 3 with the<br>
various parts assembled (not exploded).<br>
With reference to Figures 3 and 4, geophone 10 is mounted in a housing 20<br>
comprising outer sleeve 12 and end cups 1 and 13. Geophone 10 is secured in mounting ring<br>
(or cradle) 8. Shafts 9 extend from opposite sides of mounting ring 10 into bushings 2.<br>
Bearings 4, which are positioned between shafts 9 and bushings 2 enable rotational motion of<br>
shafts 9 with respect to bushings 2, thereby providing a gimbaled mounting. End caps 1 and<br>
13 are secured together by means of bolts 16 and threaded inserts 18. Spring 6 provides<br>
electrical contact between shafts 9, which are electrically conductive and are electrically<br><br>
connected to output terminals (not shown) of the geophone, and bushings 2, which are also<br>
electrically conductive, and which are electrically connected to the streamer cable wiring.<br>
Thrust washers 7 provide pre-load for bearings 4 to eliminate undesired bearing slack. O-<br>
rings 15 provide a seal between outer sleeve 12 and end caps 1 and 13, and O-rings 14<br>
provide a seal between bushings 2 and end caps 1 and 13. Plug 17 is utilized for plugging the<br>
conduit through which fluid is inserted into the interior of the geophone housing comprising<br>
the two end caps 1 and 13, and the outer sleeve 12. The configuration of the geophone<br>
assembly illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 is a particular implementation of an embodiment of<br>
the invention is not intended to be limiting. The geophone assembly 3 is secured to a seismic<br>
cable strain member for positive location.<br>
The housing 20, comprising end caps 1 and 13 and outer sleeve 12, contains a fluid,<br>
preferably an oil, which substantially surrounds the geophone. The fluid provides coupling<br>
between the geophone and the geophone housing of the geophone assembly. The fluid<br>
should preferably surround the geophone, but preferably will not entirely fill the housing so<br>
as to allow room for fluid expansion and contraction with changes in temperature and<br>
pressure. The fluid has a viscosity that provides sufficient damping of geophone movement<br>
to reduce noise, while enabling sufficient movement of the geophone 10 on the bearings to<br>
maintain the transducer in the desired orientation. That is, the viscosity of the fluid should be<br>
high enough to restrain the geophone from unwanted movements but low enough to prevent<br>
the geophone from following rotational movement of the housing and a streamer in which the<br>
geophone assembly may be mounted. A preferred viscosity for such fluid is in the range of<br>
about 500 to about 5000 centistokes.<br>
A positioner, such as a weight 11, may be mounted on the lower side of the geophone<br>
10 to assist in maintaining the sensor 10 in the desired orientation. Positioner 11 may be<br>
formed substantially from lead, although other materials having a density greater than the<br>
density of the geophone may be utilized. Alternatively, or additionally, a positioner (not<br>
shown) having a density lower than the density of the fluid that substantially surrounds the<br>
geophone 10, may be installed on the upper side of geophone 10 to assist in maintaining the<br>
geophone 10 in the desired orientation. Locating the center of gravity of the geophone below<br>
the rotational axis of the gimbal on which the sensor is mounted will also assist in<br>
maintaining the geophone in the desired orientation.<br>
The particle velocity sensor in accordance with this invention is sufficiently small to<br>
fit in the interior of a cylindrical streamer cable. Typical internal diameters of such<br><br>
cylindrical streamer cables are either 55 millimeters or 66 millimeters. The space within the<br>
streamer surrounding the seismic sensors and other apparatus (not shown) positioned within<br>
the streamer is typically filled with a liquid, such as an oil, which provides substantially<br>
neutral buoyancy to the cable. The space may also be filled with a gel or semi-solid material,<br>
and the streamer may also be a solid streamer.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the density of the overall geophone<br>
assembly (including the fluid and all other elements thereof) is selected to improve coupling<br>
between the geophone assembly anc its surroundings. In general, optimum coupling is<br>
obtained when the acoustic impedance of the geophone assembly is about the same as the<br>
acoustic impedance of its surroundings, which may be achieved by making the density of the<br>
geophone assembly about the same as the density of its surroundings, and the acoustic<br>
velocity of the geophone assembly about the same as the acoustic velocity of its<br>
surroundings.<br>
When an acoustic wave traveling in one medium encounters the boundary of a second<br>
medium, reflected and transmitted waves are generated. Further, when the boundary area of<br>
the second medium is much smaller than the wavelength of the acoustic wave, diffraction<br>
results rather than reflection. For plane waves the characteristic acoustic impedance of a<br>
medium is equal to density times velocity, i.e.,<br><br><br><br>
in which, z= acoustic impedance<br>
  =density, and<br>
c = velocity.<br>
Let the incident and reflected wave travel in a fluid of characteristic acoustic impedance,<br>
r1 = p1c1, where p1 is equilibrium density of the fluid and c1 is the phase speed in the fluid.<br>
Let the transmitted wave travel in a fluid of characteristic acoustic impedance r1 = p2c2. If<br>
the complex pressure amplitude of the ir cident wave is P1, that of the reflected wave PR , and<br>
that of the transmitted wave PT , then the pressure reflection coefficient R may be defined as:<br><br>
and since 1 + R = T, the pressure transmission coefficient T can be written as:<br><br><br>
It follows from the foregoing explanation that improved reception will be achieved if the<br>
particle velocity sensor is made in such a way that the density and speed in the sensor<br>
assembly, including its housing and other components, is similar to that of the surrounding<br>
fluid. If they are equal, the reflection coefficient will be R = 0 and the transmission<br>
coefficient will be T = 1.<br>
By making the acoustic velocity in the particle velocity sensor substantially equal to<br>
the acoustic velocity in the water in which the sensor is deployed, and by making the density<br>
of the particle velocity sensor similar to the density of the water, a good impedance match is<br>
generated between the water and the particle velocity sensor. The velocity sensor will have a<br>
good impedance match with the surrounding media and no distortion of amplitude or phase<br>
will occur due to reflection, diffraction or other anomalies of the traveling wave passing<br>
through the sensor and its housing.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the density of the particle velocity sensor is less that about<br>
twice the density of water (about 2 g/cm3), and more preferably about the same as the density<br>
of water (about 1 g/cm3). Accordingly, the density of the particle velocity sensor should<br>
typically be between about 0.5 g/cm3 and 2 g/cm3, and more preferably, about 1.0 g/cm3. It is<br>
understood, however, that water density may vary with salinity, and that it may be useful to<br>
vary the density of the particle velocity sensor, depending on the particular body of water in<br>
which the particle velocity sensor is to be employed. Because the density of particle velocity<br>
sensor in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention is substantially less than<br>
the density of geophone assemblies ypically available for use in ocean bottom seismic<br>
operations, different components are selected from which to assemble the geophone<br>
assembly. For example, at least a portion of the housing may be formed from a moldable<br>
elastomeric, such as isoplast or polypropylene, or a moldable composite material, such as<br>
fiber reinforced epoxy.<br>
Over and above the need for good acoustic coupling, a low-weight particle velocity<br>
sensor is useful because, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the seismic cable in<br>
which the sensors are included needs to be neutrally buoyant. As many as 10,000 particle<br>
velocity sensors may be utilized in a single cable. Accordingly, a particle velocity sensor<br>
having a density of less than 2 grams per cubic centimeter facilitates the mechanical<br>
construction of the seismic cable to achieve neutral buoyancy.<br>
In a particular implementation of the invention, particle velocity sensors 3 and<br>
pressure gradient sensors 5 are utilized together in a cylindrical seismic cable 30, as shown in<br><br>
Figure 5. Use of both particle velocity sensors and pressure gradient sensors enables signal<br>
degradation resulting from surface ghost reflections to be substantially eliminated from the<br>
recorded seismic data. Such signal improvement is achieved by combining the output signals<br>
from a particle velocity sensor (or an a Tay of particle velocity sensors) with the output signal<br>
from a pressure gradient sensor (or an array of pressure gradient sensors) positioned at<br>
substantially the same location. Paricle velocity sensors and pressure gradient sensors<br>
positioned at substantially the same location may be referred to hereinafter as "co-located"<br>
sensors.<br>
The phase and amplitude response for a pressure gradient sensor are substantially<br>
constant in the seismic frequency band of interest (from about 2 Hz. to about 300 Hz.). For<br>
example, for the T-2BX hydrophone marketed by Teledyne Instruments, Inc. of 5825<br>
Chimney Rock Road, Houston, Texas 77081, the variation in amplitude over a frequency<br>
range of 2 - 300 Hz. has been measured at less than 1 db, and the variation in phase at less<br>
than 0.1 degree. Figures 6A and 6B show a typical amplitude and phase response for a<br>
particle velocity sensor. In Figure 6A, curve 56 represents amplitude variation, and in Figure<br>
6B, curve 58 represents the phase varia ion. In contrast to the amplitude and phase response<br>
of the hydrophone, it is evident that there are substantial variations in both the amplitude and<br>
the phase response for a particle velocity sensor in the seismic frequency range of interest.<br>
Further, in prior art systems, in which the impedance of the particle velocity sensor<br>
was not substantially matched to the impedance of the substance (either the water or the<br>
water bottom) from which the seismic wave is coupled to the particle velocity sensor,<br>
additional variations in amplitude and phase occur in the seismic frequency range because of<br>
the impedance mismatch.<br>
In accordance with a particular embodiment of the present invention, where the<br>
impedance match between the water and the particle velocity sensor is more nearly equal,<br>
such additional variations in amplitude and phase are minimized, and, accordingly, the<br>
particle velocity sensor output and the pressure gradient sensor output can be matched by<br>
utilizing an appropriate filter, of a type known to those of ordinary skill in the art, without<br>
requiring additional matching for variations caused by impedance mismatch.<br>
In one implementation of the invention, the pressure gradient sensor is a hydrophone<br>
and the particle velocity sensor is a geophone. The ratio of acoustic pressure in a medium to<br>
the associated particle velocity speed is he specific acoustic impedance  For a<br><br>
hydrophone, having a good impedance match to the medium surrounding the hydrophone,<br>
and having (for example) a pressure sensitivity of 20 volts per bar, i.e.,<br><br>
which relationship may be expressed a s<br><br>
and a geophone or a group of geophones, having a good impedance match to the medium<br>
surrounding the geophone, and having (for example) a voltage sensitivity of:<br><br>
the scale factor (K), expressing the relationship between velocity output signal of the<br>
geophone and the pressure output signal of the hydrophone will be:<br><br>
which indicates that the geophone velocity output signal needs to be multiplied with a scale<br>
factor of K = 15 before the pressure ard the velocity can be compared. It will be understood<br>
that for hydrophones and geophones having different sensitivities than in the example<br>
discussed above, the scale factor (K) will be different. Further, because of the variation in<br>
the amplitude (as shown in Figure 6A) and phase (as shown in Figure 6B) of the geophone<br>
output as a function of frequency, it is necessary to compensate for the amplitude and phase<br>
response of the geophone before applying the scale factor.<br><br>
in which, G = geophone voltage sensitivity;<br>
The amplitude response (E) and phase response (Φ) for the geophone as a function<br>
of frequency may be represented by the following relationships:<br><br>
f = frequency;<br>
fn = natural resonance frequency;<br>
r = winding resistance;<br>
R = load resistance; anc<br>
b1 = total damping.<br>
Typical values may be: fn = 10; r = 3 50 ohms; R = ∞; and bt = 0.6.<br>
If the amplitude and phase of the geophone output signal is adjusted to compensate<br>
for this variation in phase and amplitude with frequency, the geophone output signal will<br>
have substantially the same phase and amplitude curve as the hydrophone signal. Normally<br>
the adjustment may be made on the basis of calculations based on Equations 8 and 9.<br>
As stated above, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, particle velocity sensors<br>
are constructed to have an acoustic impedance substantially similar to the acoustic impedance<br>
of the water in the body of water in which the particle velocity sensors are deployed.<br>
Accordingly, problems encountered in prior art system, in which the impedance of the sensor<br>
was not matched to the acoustic impecance of the medium from which a seismic wave was<br>
coupled to the sensor, are avoided. In prior art systems variations in amplitude and phase as a<br>
function of frequency caused by impedance mismatch compounded the difficulty of matching<br>
the particle velocity sensor output to he pressure gradient sensor output. Because of the<br>
impedance match achieved in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, only the<br>
variation in amplitude and phase of the particle velocity sensor itself needs to be compensated<br>
for to enable the particle velocity sensor output to be combined with the pressure sensor<br>
output to attenuate the spectral notches caused by the ghost reflection.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the phase and amplitude variations with<br>
frequency of the particle velocity sensor may be calculated based on known (or determinate)<br>
characteristics of the particle velocity sensor, itself. The output signal of the particle velocity<br>
sensor may be modified accordingly to correct for amplitude and phase variation with<br>
frequency using filter techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For co-<br>
located pressure gradient sensors and particle velocity sensors, the signal output of the<br>
pressure gradient sensor and the filtered output of the pressure gradient sensor may then be<br>
summed to attenuate the spectral notches resulting from the ghost reflection. Although, in a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, the phase and amplitude of the particle velocity<br>
sensor output is modified to substantially match the pressure gradient sensor output, those of<br><br>
ordinary skill in the art would understand that the phase and amplitude of the pressure<br>
gradient sensor output could be modif ed to match the particle velocity sensor output signal.<br>
Because the noise level is generally greater at shallower water depths, placing the<br>
streamer at depths greater than about nine meters (the greatest depth at which streamer cables<br>
are typically deployed) may reduce noise detected by the sensors, and the signal to noise ratio<br>
of the signals detected by the seismic sensors is accordingly improved. However, for such<br>
greater depths, notches in a hydrophone spectrum resulting from the surface ghost reflection<br>
are at lower frequencies, and such a hydrophone signal is normally regarded as undesirable<br>
because of the spectral notches in the frequency range of interest in seismic exploration. In<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the output signal from the particle<br>
velocity sensor, which will have notches in its frequency spectrum at different frequencies<br>
from the notches in the frequency spectrum of the hydrophone, may be combined with the<br>
hydrophone output signal to compensates for the notches and a substantially ghost free signal<br>
can be obtained. Figure 7 shows simulated output responses for a hydrophone (curve 42) and<br>
a geophone (curve 44) at a water depth of 26-meters. The graph indicates that two signals<br>
may be combined to compensate for the spectral notches resulting from the surface reflection.<br>
Figure 8 provides actual data from a field test with the cable at about 26 meters, which<br>
confirms the results indicated in the simulation. In Figure 8 the geophone output signal is<br>
designated by numeral 46 and the hydrophone output signal is designated by numeral 48.<br>
Figure 9 shows a summation (curve 60) of the hydrophone and geophone data shown in<br>
Figure 8, and illustrates the attenuation of the spectral notches<br>
Because of the potential high noise level in geophone signals at low frequencies,<br>
resulting from mechanical vibrations in the cable, in a particular implementation of the<br>
invention, low frequency geophone signals are not combined with the hydrophone signal. In<br>
one specific implementation of the invention, frequencies in the geophone signal lower than<br>
about the frequency of the lowest frequency spectral notch in the hydrophone spectrum are<br>
removed from the geophone signal before the geophone signal is combined with the<br>
hydrophone signal. In another implerr entation of the invention, geophone signals of less than<br>
about 30 Hz. are not combined with the hydrophone signal.<br>
Improved results are also afforded for operations at shallow depths by the use of<br>
particle velocity sensors in seismic cables in addition to pressure gradient sensors, over<br>
operations using solely pressure gradient sensors. At shallower depths, i.e., less than about 6<br>
meters, a hydrophone output signal will be attenuated by the surface ghost in the seismic<br><br>
frequency range of interest. Because of the phase difference between the upgoing pressure<br>
gradient wavefield and the downgoing pressure gradient wavefield within the seismic<br>
frequency band of interest, the downgoing wavefield is subtractive with respect to the<br>
upgoing wavefield and the downgoing wavefield effectively attenuates the upgoing<br>
wavefield. For a geophone signal, however, the result is the opposite, and the surface ghost<br>
signal effectively increases the amplitude of the signal detected by the geophone. The<br>
difference in phase between the upgoing wavefield and the downgoing wavefield is such that,<br>
for shallow depths, the signal detected by the geophone is additive. Accordingly,<br>
substantially improved results are achieved by use of particle velocity sensors in addition to<br>
pressure gradient sensors at shallow depths over what is achieved by use of pressure gradient<br>
sensors alone. In coastal regions where the water depth is quite shallow, it may be<br>
particularly useful to be able to deploy the sensors at such shallower depths.<br>
Figure 10 shows a simulation of a hydrophone signal (curve 52) and a geophone<br>
signal (curve 50) at one-meter depth. The attenuation of the hydrophone signal is evident.<br>
Combining the geophone output signal with the hydrophone output signal for data recorded at<br>
the one-meter water depth also compensates for the influence from the surface reflection.<br>
Generally, a hydrophone signal will have an amplitude that is 10 to 20 times greater<br>
than the amplitude of a geophone signal. This relationship will vary depending on the<br>
particular sensitivity of the particular sensors used. Typically a group of hydrophones,<br>
distributed across a selected spatial distance, will be connected in parallel for noise<br>
attenuation, and the hydrophone output signal that is recorded for use in seismic data<br>
processing and analysis is the combined output from a plurality of individual hydrophones<br>
connected in parallel. Because of the lower signal amplitude of the geophone output signal,<br>
in one implementation of the invention, a group of geophones, associated with a group of<br>
hydrophones (co-located geophones and hydrophones), will be connected in series, to<br>
increase the amplitude of the output signal as well as to attenuate noise, and the geophone<br>
output signal that is recorded for use in seismic data processing and analysis will be the<br>
combined output from a plurality of individual geophones connected in series. However,<br>
depending on the needs of a particular survey, the geophone groups may be connected in<br>
parallel or series, or in a parallel/series combination. Although, in general, the discussion<br>
herein refers to an output signal from vaious sensors, the output signal is typically the output<br>
signal from a plurality of discrete sensors interconnected into a sensor array. Further,<br>
although the discussion herein generally refers to a geophone and hydrophone, particle<br><br>
velocity sensors other than geophones and pressure gradient sensors other than hydrophones<br>
are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment, groups of about 8 pressure gradient sensors will be used in<br>
association with groups of about 2 to about 16 particle velocity sensors (with lower numbers<br>
rather than higher numbers of particle velocity sensors preferred), and each combined group<br>
will be about 12.5 meters apart from another such combined group. In this embodiment,<br>
combined groups of both pressure sensors and particle velocity sensors will be treated as<br>
single sensors.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, three-component particle velocity sensors are<br>
included in the seismic cable. By "three-component" is meant that, in addition a particle<br>
velocity sensor (typically a geophone) mounted to sense motion in the vertical direction, two<br>
particle velocity sensor are mounted ir orthogonal directions with respect to each other (and<br>
to the vertically mounted geophone) to sense horizontal motion. Accordingly, a three-<br>
component particle velocity sensor with sense motion in the vertical direction, in an in-line<br>
direction and a cross line direction. Positioning these sensors in these three directions<br>
enables the propagation direction of ar incoming signal to be detected, and also enables the<br>
detection of strumming or other mechanical behavior to the cable.<br>
Accelerometers could be used as particle motion sensor as an alternative to use of<br>
geophones, although the output signa will need to be integrated to obtain velocity. An<br>
example commercial accelerometer sui able for use in the present invention is the VECTOR-<br>
SEIS™, available from Input Output, Inc. in Houston, Texas. This particular accelerometer<br>
generates a DC output signal which is indicative of the variation in orientation of the<br>
accelerometer from a selected orientation, accordingly, if sets of 2 (for situations in which the<br>
in-line direction is known) or 3 (if the in-line direction is not known) of these accelerometers<br>
are utilized, the sensor orientation may be computed and it is not necessary to gimbal-mount<br>
the accelerometers. A single accelerometer could also be used, but it would need to be<br>
gimbal-mounted. Since the sensor can neasure acceleration to DC, it is possible to determine<br>
the true gravity vector by analyzing the magnitude of G (the gravity vector) each sensor is<br>
operable under. The results of this analysis are stored with the trace data as direction cosines<br>
and describe the tensor rotation required to recover the signals as if the sensor were deployed<br>
at true vertical orientation.<br><br>
The foregoing description of the invention is intended to be a description of preferred<br>

departing from the intended scope of this invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br>
