HEAT ACTIVATED EPOXY ADHESIVE AND USE IN A STRUCTURAL FOAM<br>
INSERT<br>
The present invention relates to a heat activated epoxy adhesive and its use in a foam insert that is bonded to a metal body. Structural foam inserts (SFIs) have been developed to reinforce structures within motor vehicles to add strength and stiffness to the vehicle at the site of insertion. Acoustical foam inserts (API) have been developed to reduce the impact of noise and vibration on vehicle passages. For example, an SFI coated with an uncured expandable epoxy adhesive is secured to the B-pillar cavity of an automobile. An AFI is typically placed in a hollow part of an automobile for the purpose of preventing the transmission of noise and vibration throughout the hollow cavity. AFI may comprise a foam coated with an expandable adhesive. The automobile body is then subjected to electrodeposition coating (e-coating) and bake, whereupon the epoxy adhesive expands through heat activation to form a bond between the foam insert and the sheet metal. However, one problem associated with expandable adhesives of the prior art is their propensity to crosslink before they expand. This premature crosslinking results in ineffective wet-out of the vehicular substrate and concomitant weaker bonding. Furthermore, solving the problem of premature crosslinking - for example, by reducing or eliminating catalyst - creates another problem, namely, the formation of a cured expanded polymer with acceptable adhesion at the expense of large voids (number weighted mean diameter of &gt; 2000 |im), the formation of which decreases durability and results in reduction in mechanical properties.<br>
It would therefore be an advance in the art of foam inserts to provide an expandable adhesive for the insert that efficiently wets out a substrate before crosslinking occurs, thereby creating optimal chemical bonding and enhanced durability, but which produces small voids, thereby resulting in enhanced mechanical properties.<br>
The adhesive of the present invention can expand up to 350 percent. To insure the cavity is filled, expansion is limited by the available space in the cavity. The adhesive present invention creates an equalizing pressure which helps align the part in the cavity.<br><br>
The present invention addresses a need in the art by providing an expandable adhesive comprising a) a cured 1-part epoxy resin; b) a viscosity increasing agent; and c) not greater than 25 parts by weight of an inorganic filler, based on 100 parts of the epoxy resin, wherein the adhesive when expanded contains voids having a number average or weighted mean diameter of less than 1000 urn.<br>
In a second aspect, the invention is a structural foam insert comprising a) an expanded polymer, and b) an expandable adhesive contacting the expanded polymer, which expandable adhesive contains i) a 1-part epoxy resin; ii) a polymeric viscosity enhancing agent; iii) a blowing agent; iv) a catalyst; and v) a curing agent, wherein the expandable adhesive has a Young's modulus of at least 500 mPa at 100 percent expansion, preferably 600 mPa at 150 percent expansion.<br>
In a third aspect, the present invention is a reinforced vehicular frame comprising a) an expanded polymer, and b) an expanded adhesive bonding the expanded polymer and the vehicular frame, which expanded adhesive contains i) 1-part cured epoxy resin; and ii) a polymeric viscosity enhancing agent; wherein the expanded adhesive has a Young's modulus of at least 500 mPa at 100 percent expansion.<br>
In a fourth aspect, the present invention is a method of preparing foam insert comprising the steps of 1) contacting an expandable adhesive with an expanded polymer under conditions sufficient to gel the expandable adhesive without crosslinking; b) placing the expanded polymer with the gelled expandable adhesive within a vehicular frame; c) heat -activating the expandable adhesive to create a expanded adhesive that forms a bond between the expanded polymer and the vehicular frame; d) curing the expanded adhesive; wherein the expandable adhesive contains i) a 1-part epoxy resin; ii) a polymeric viscosity enhancing agent; iii) a blowing agent; iv) a catalyst; and v) a curing agent, and wherein the expanded adhesive contains voids having a number weighted mean diameter of 
In a fifth aspect, the present invention is an expanded adhesive comprising a) a cured 1-part epoxy resin; b) a viscosity increasing agent; and c) not greater than 25 parts by<br><br>
weight of an inorganic filler, based on 100 parts of the epoxy resin, wherein the expanded adhesive contains voids having a number weighted mean diameter of 
The present invention addresses a problem in the art by providing an foam insert with an adhesive that efficiently wets out a substrate before crosslinking occurs, thereby creating superior chemical bonding and enhanced durability, but which produces reduced cell structure, thereby resulting in enhanced mechanical properties. The adhesive of the present invention can expand up to 350 percent. To insure the cavity is filled, expansion is limited by the available space in the cavity.

The viscosity increasing agent is preferably used as a fine powder (volume mean average 
The polymerization of the epoxy resin is catalyzed by an effective amount of a polymerizing promoting catalyst, preferably from 0.1 weight percent to 2 weight percent, based on the total materials used to make the expandable adhesive. Suitable catalysts include, but are not restricted to, ureas and imidazoles. An example of a preferred catalyst is Acclerine CEL 2191 (l-(2-(2-hydroxbenzamido)ethyl)-2-(2-hydroxyphenyl-2-imidazoline, which has the following chemical structure:<br><br><br>
The preparation of this catalyst is described by Bagga in U.S. Patent 4,997,951, which description is incorporated herein by reference.<br>

A preferred expandable adhesive is prepared by combining and mixing the epoxy resin, the blowing agent, the catalyst, the curing agent, the viscosity increasing agent, and optionally the fillers at a temperature above ambient temperature, preferably from 30° C to 50°C for 15 minutes to 2 hours. Entrapped air is removed in vacuo and the expandable adhesive is then injected into a hot mold (100°C to 130°C) that surrounds and conforms to the shape of the expanded polymer to achieve variable designed thicknesses of adhesive over the expanded polymer ranging from 1 mm to 4 mm. The resultant foam insert is affixed within a cavity of an automotive structure so as to create a 1-mm to a 4-mm gap between thefoam insert and the metal substrate. The metal structure is then e-coated, with residual e-coat liquid escaping through the gaps between foam insert and the metal.

The following example is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to limit the invention in any way. All percentages are weight percent unless otherwise specified.<br>
Example - Preparation of a Structural Foam Insert with Controlled Adhesive Cell Size<br>
A rigid polyurethane foam having a density of 0.64 g/cm3 and a Young's modulus of 400 mPa was conformed to a desired shape. An expandable adhesive was prepared by adding to a vessel with mixing DER 331 epoxy resin (40 percent), DER 337 epoxy resin (25 percent), CELOGEN AZ 120 blowing agent (1.5 percent), CaCO, filler (0.45 percent), carbon black (0.9 percent), ACCELERINE CEL 2191 catalyst (1 percent, obtained from Celerity LLC), AMICURE CG1200 dicydiamide, DEGALAN 4944F PMMA (12.1 percent), M1CROTHENE FE-532 polyethylene copolymer (10 percent), and CABOSIL TS-720 (4,1 percent) at 40°C for 1 hour. Entrapped air wa then removed by mixing under vacuum for 30 minutes. The blend was injected into a hot mold (120°C) surrounding and conforming to the shape of a polyurethane foam insert so that the expandable adhesive substantially covers the insert to achieve variable designed thicknesses ranging from 2-3 mm for designed variances in final mechanical properties of the expanded adhesive. The adhesive resided in the hot mold for 4 minutes, after which the mold wa cooled to room temperature over a 10-minute period and removed. The resultant FOAM INSERT was affixed within the cavity of an automotive structure to create a 2-mm gap between the SFI and the metal substrate. The metal structure was e-coated at ambient temperatures, with the residual liquid running through the gaps between the SFI and the metal. The structure was heated in an oven for 40 minutes at 180°C to cure the e-coat and to expand and cure the adhesive. The cured adhesive had a Young's modulus of 1033 mPa at 100 percent expansion.<br><br><br>
