HIGH  TEMPERATURE OXYGEN  PRODUCTION FOR  IRONMAKING PROCESSES<br>
FIELD OF THE  INVENTION<br>
The invention addresses the direct production of iron from iron oxides,   coal,  and oxygen,  and  in particular the high-temperature  recovery of oxygen for use in the jronmaking process.<br><br>
Integrated iron  reduction and smelting processes which  use  coal directly without the need for a separate coking step have been developed  in recent years as alternatives  to the widely-used blast furnace.    These newer ironmaking processes utilize oxygen  (typically greater than 95 vol% oxygen) rather than air as used in a blast furnace, and produce two to three times more med1um-BT(J gas  per unit of iron production than  a blast  furnace. These processes include the COREX® process developed and marketed by Voest-Alpine Industrieanlagenbau and Deutsche Voest-Alpine Industrieanlagenbau, as well  as other new or developing direct ironmaking methods such as the ROMELT,  HiSMELT®,  DIOS,  and the AISl   In-Bath Smelting processes.     Direct ironmaking processes have significant operating and environmental   benefits over the conventional  blast furnace process.    In addition,  direct ironmaking processes are well-suited for integration with combined cycle power generation  systems which  utilize the byproduct medium-BTU gas  as primary  fuel.    The COREX    process,  which is representative of these integrated reduction-smelting processes and which is currently in<br><br>
commercial   use,   is described in a paper entitled "Cogeneration with COREX®" by M.   Lemperle and D.   Siuka presented at the  1991 AISE Annual  Convention. Pittsburgh, PA, September 1991.<br>
Large volumes of oxygen are  required for direct  integrated ironmaking processes;  the COREX® process for example requires  approximately 0.6 to  1.0 ton of oxygen per ton  of iron produced.    This oxygen typically is  produced in a cryogenic air separation process which usually is not integrated with the ironmaking process.<br>
Oxygen can be recovered from air at high temperatures by metal oxide ceramic materials utilized in the form of selectively permeable nonporous  ion transport membranes.    An oxygen partial   pressure differential or a voltage differential across the membrane causes oxygen ions to migrate through the membrane from the  feed side to the permeate  side where the  ions recombine to form electrons and oxygen gas.    An ion transport membrane of the pressure-driven type is defined herein as a mixed conductor membrane, in which the electrons simultaneously migrate through the membrane to preserve internal electrical  neutrality.    An ion transport membrane of the electrically-driven type is defined herein as a solid electrolyte membrane in which the electrons flow from the permeate side to the feed side of the membrane in an external  circuit driven by a voltage differential.    A comprehensive review of the characteristics and applications of ion transport membranes is given in a report entitled "Advanced Oxygen Separation Membranes"  by J.  D.  Wright and R.  J.  Copeland,   Report  No.   TDA-6RI-90/0303 prepared for the Gas Research  Institute,   September 1990.<br><br>
In the recovery of oxygen from air at high  temperatures   (typically yOCC to 1100'C)   using  ion transport membranes,  a significant amount of heat energy is available in the membrane permeate and non-permeate streams. Energy recovery and effective utilization thereof is possible by the integration of compressors, combustors, hot gas turbines,  steam turbines, and heat exchangers with the mixed conductor membrane module.    Such integrated systems are described in U.S.  Patents 4,545,787,  5,035,727, 5,118,395.  5,174,866,  and 5.245.110.    An article entitled  "Separation of Oxygen by Using Zirconia Solid Electrolyte Membranes"  by 0.   J.  Clark et al in Gas Separation and Purification  1992,  Vol.  6,  No.  4,  pp.   201-205 discloses an integrated coal gasification-gas turbine cogeneration system with recovery of oxygen  for use in the gasifier.    Membrane non-permeate  is combusted with gas from the gasifier and passed to the gas turbine cogeneration system.<br>
A combined cycle power generation system is a highly efficient system which utilizes a gas turbine to drive an electric generator, wherein heat is recovered from the turbine exhaust as steam which drives an additional electric generator.    A description of typical combined cycle power generation  systems  is given  in The Chemical   Engineer.  28 January   1993,  pp. 17-20.    The compressor,  combustor,  and expansion  turbine are carefully designed and integrated to maximize the efficiency of each component and thus  the efficiency of the integrated  system.    Preferably  these systems  are operated at steady-state design conditions,  since significant deviations from these conditions will  adversely  affect system efficiency.<br><br>
Integrated coal-based  ironmaking processes,   combined, cycle power generation,  and the production of oxygen by high-temperature ion transport membranes are well-suited for integration  in highly-efficient  systems for the production of iron,  electric power,  and oxygen.    The  invention disclosed below and described in the claims which  follow advances  the art and provides improved methods for the production of iron,  electric power, and oxygen by means of integrated direct ironmaking,   ion  transport membrane, and combined cycle generation systems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE   INVENTION<br>
The present  invention  is an  integrated oxygen-based  ironmaking process which comprises partially oxidizing a portion of a carbonaceous feed with an oxidizing gas  to generate heat and a hot reducing gas comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide,  heating  iron oxide utilizing  a first portion of the heat, and reacting the resulting hot iron oxide with the hot reducing gas to yield reduced solid metallic iron and partially reacted reducing gas.    A stream of air is compressed and heated, wherein the heating is accomplished at least in part by utilizing a second portion of the heat generated by the partial  oxidation of the carbonaceous feed, and the resulting compressed and heated air is passed into a membrane separation  zone comprising one or more oxygen-selective  ion  transport membranes.    A hot oxygen permeate stream and a hot oxygen-containing  non-permeate stream are withdrawn  from the membrane zone.    At  least  a portion of the hot oxygen permeate stream is utilized to provide the oxidizing gas for the partial oxidation of the carbonaceous feed.    The hot oxygen nprnieate stream tvDically is cooled and compressed before use as the<br><br>
oxidizing gas,  and  the cooling of the hot oxygen permeate stream can  be accomplished by  indirect heat exchange with  liquid water to  generate steam.<br>
The heating of the iron oxide is accomplished by direct contact with the hot reducing gas.    The reduced solid metallic iron  is melted utilizing a third portion of the heat from partial  oxidation of the carbonaceous feed,  and carbon from the carbonaceous feed dissolveb in the resulting molten iron to yield a molten iron product.    A flux material  such as liinestone is added with the iron oxide in the heating step to capture impurities and  keep the slag  fluid,  and the molten  iron is  smelted  to form molten slag and the molten iron product.<br>
Heating of  the air feed to the ion transport membrane can be accomplished at least in part by indirect heat exchange of the air feed with a portion of the hot reducing gas.    Heating of the air feed also can be accomplished at least in part by direct or indirect combustion of a portion  of the partially reacted reducing gas from the iron  oxide reduction step.    The carbonaceous feed is selected from the group consisting of coal, coke made from coal, petroleum coke,   liquid hydrocarbon, natural  gas,  and other carbon-containing materials.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the hot oxygen-containing non-pemeate stream is heated and passed through an expansion turbine to produce shaft power.    A portion of the shaft power is used to compress the feed air to the ion transport membrane.    Another portion of the shaft power can be used to operate an electric generator to produce electricity. Heatina of the hot oxvqen-containing non-pemeate stream is accomplished by<br><br>
direct combustion with a portion of the partially reacted reducing gas. Preferably, hot exhaust gas from the expansion turbine is used to generate steam by indirect heat exchange of liquid water with the hot exhaust gas, and the steam is expanded through a steam turbine to drive an electric generator to generate additional electricity. Optionally, additional steam can be generated by cooling the hot ox&gt;'gen permeate stream by indirect heat exchange with liquid water, and the steam is expanded through the steam turbine.<br>
The invention thus integrates the ironmaking and oxygen generation processes by utilizing excess heat and low-BTU gas generated by the ironmaking process to heat the ion transport membrane system. Further, the ironmaking and oxygen generation processes are integrated with a combined cycle power generation system to produce iron, oxygen, and electricity in a highly-efficient manner.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an integrated ox&gt;'gen-based ironmaking process which comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	partially oxidizing a portion of a carbonaceous feed with an oxidizing gas to generate heat and a hot reducing gas comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide;<br>
(b)	heating iron oxide utilizing a first portion of said heat and reacting the resulting hot iron oxide with said hot reducing gas to yield reduced solid metallic iron and partially reacted reducing gases;<br>
(c)compressing and heating a stream of air, wherein said heating is accomplished at least in part by utilizing a second portion of said heat, passing the resulting compressed and heated air into a membrane separation zone comprising one or   more   ox&gt;gen-selective ion transport membranes, and<br><br>
withdrawing therefrom a hot oxygen permeate stream and a hot oxygen-containing non-permeate stream;<br>
(d)	utiHzing at least a portion of said hot oxygen permeate stream to provide said oxidizing gas in step (a); and<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE  I^VEHTION<br>
In the direct ironmaking process.  Iron ore and additives are preheated, the ore is reduced to sponge iron, the sponge iron is melted to produce molten pig iron, and coal  is partially oxidized and gasified to produce heat and reducing gas for the reduction step.    All of these steps are carried out in a single, continuous,  integrated process as illustrated in Fig. 1.    Iron ore 1, which essentially is a mixture of iron oxides and nonmetallic materials (gangue),  is charged with flux material  3 such as limestone or dolomite to heating and reduction zone 5 in which the solid material  is contacted with a stream of hot reducing gas 7 which contains primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide.    The ore and flux material  are preheated and the iron oxide reacts with the hydrogen and carbon monoxide in heating and reduction zone 5 to form elemental  iron, carbon dioxide, and water at temperatures in the range of 260°C to 1,300°C,    Partially reacted reducing gas 9, which contains hydrogen, carbon monoxide,  carbon dioxide, water, and fines is washed and cooled in scrubber 11 to yield cooled export gas  13.    This export gas  typically has a heating value of  150 to 300 BTU/cu ft.<br>
Combined sponge iron and heated flux material  15 moves into smelter-gasifier 17.    Coal  19,  flux 21, and oxygen 23 are introduced continuously into smelter-Qasifier 17 in which several  steps occur simultaneously at<br><br>
temperatures above 1200°C.    The sponge iron melts,   the coal   is partially oxidized and gasified by the oxygen to generate heat and reducing gas,  the flux material  combines with gangue in the ore and with ash and impurities in the coal  to form molten slag,  and carbon dissolves in the molten  iron. Molten pig  iron 25,  slag 27,  and hot,  dust-laden  reducing  gas 29 are withdrawn  from the smelter-gasjfier.     Reducing gas  29 is  treated  to  remove fines in cleaning zone 31 and cooled (not shown)  to the preferred ot^erating temperature of heating and reduction zone 5 to provide reducing gas 7.<br>
The generic direct ironmaking steps described in reference to Fig. 1 can be carried out in any of the ironmaking processes developed in recent years. These processes include the COREX process developed and marketed by Voest-Alpine Industrieanlagenbau and Deutsche Voest-Alpine Industrieanlagenbau, as well as other new or developing direct ironmaking methods such as the ROMELT, HiSHELT®, DIGS, and the AISI In-Bath Smelting processes.<br>
The present invention is an integrated ironmaking process in which the oxygen required for the melter-gasifier is produced by a high-temperature ion transport membrane from hot compressed air wherein the air is heated by excess heat from the ironmaking process.    Air heating can be accomplished by indirect heat exchange between compressed air and hot reducing gas 29 after particulate  remove],   by  indirect heat  exchange between the compressed a?r and partially reacted reducing gas 9,  by combusting a portion of export gas  13,  or a combination of  these heating steps.    In addition,  the air feed to the ion transport membrane can be<br><br>
:onipressed using shaft power generated by expansion of the hot pressurized non-permeate gas from the membrane as described below.<br>
The invention is described in detail with reference to Fig.  2 in which the ion transport membrane system is integrated with the earlier-cited COREX* direct ironmaking process.    Iron ore and additives 201 are fed to preheating and reduction shaft 203 and flow downward through the shaft against hot upward-flowing reducing gas 205.    The additives typically include dolomite and other fluxing agents in amounts up to 10% of the iron ore fed to the system.    The iron oxides are reduced in reduction shaft 203 at temperatures between 260°C to 1000°C and at pressures typically  between 14.7 and 40 psia; partially reacted reducing gas 207 is withdrawn,  cooled, and cleaned by contact with water in scrubber 209.    Solid reduced metallic iron 211, known as sponge iron, is discharged from reduction shaft 203 into melter-gasifier 213 which operates at temperatures in the range of lOOOX to leoOT and pressures up to 100 psia.    Coal  and additives 215 are fed into the top of melter-gasifier 213 and oxygen 217 is introduced near the bottom thereof.    Oxygen 217 preferably contains at least 90 vol% oxygen.    Partial oxidation of the coal with oxygen generates heat and gasifies the coal  to produce reducing gas comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide.    The sponge iron melts,  and the necessary metallurgical  reactions proceed to yield molten slag and pig iron which are withdrawn as 219 and 221 respectively.<br>
Hot, dust-laden reducing gas 222 from the melter-gasifier is combined with a stream of cool  reducing gas 223 and the combined cooled gas 225 at 800X to 1000°C passes into hot cyclone 227 which removes coal, ash,  and mot-3i  finps ??q which are returned to melter-gasifier 213 by inert gas<br><br>
:reaiii 231. A portion 233 of the cooled and cleaned reducing gas is ivided to provide reducing gas feed 205 to reduction shaft 203 and educing gas 235 which is further cooled and cleaned in scrubber 237 to ield cooled reducing gas 239, Another portion 241 of the cooled and leaned reducing gas from hot cyclone 227 is withdrawn for later process ;se. Partially reacted reducing gas 243 after cooling and cleaning in jcrubber 209 is divided into export gas 245 and fuel gas 247 for additional srocess use. Slurry streams 238 and 244 containing particulates and water are withdrawn from scrubbers 237 and 209 respectively.<br>
Oxygen 217 is provided by an ion transport membrane system which utilizes heat from the direct ironmaking process to provide the high temperatures required for oxygen recovery. Oxygen 217 can be preheated prior to melter-gasifier 213 if desired by indirect heat exchange with hot reducing gas 233 (not shown). Oxygen-containing gas 249, preferably air, is compressed in compressor 251 to a pressure between 50 and 500 psia, preferably 80 to 300 psia. Compressor 251 is a centrifugal, axial, or reciprocating compressor, optionally multistaged, and optionally intercooled. When operating without intercooling in an adiabatic mode, compressed feed 252 will be at a temperature of 360T to I.IOOT; when operated with intercooling in an isothermal mode, compressed feed 252 will be at lOOT to 300T. Compressed feed 256 is preheated in heat exchange zone 255 by indirect heat exchange with hot reducing gas 241 and heated stream 257 passes into direct-fired burner 259. Cooled process stream 242 is returned to the ironmaking process as described later. Burner 259 is a combustor, for example of the type known and used in the gas turbine art, and utilizes fuel gas 251 which 1s obtained as a portion of fuel gas 247<br><br>
after compression to 50 to 1,000 psia by compressor 263. Burner 259 is operated with sufficient excess air such that hot combustion stream 255 contains about 10-20 vol% oxygen at a temperature of SOCF to 2,000°F. preferably 1,000*^ to 1,600°F. Alternatively, burner 259 can be an indirect heater. I.e. a process furnace with internal heat exchange, so that combustion gases do not contact membrane 259 directly. This alternative would be selected if impurities in fuel gas 251 yield compounds in hot combustion product 265 which would degrade membrane 259.<br>
The heating of compressed air 265 to membrane separation zone 267 can be accomplished if desired solely by burner 259 without the use of heat exchange zone 255. Alternatively, if the temperature of reducing gas 241 is sufficiently high relative to the operating temperature of membrane zone 267, burner 259 optionally would not be required and heating would be accomplished solely by heat exchange zone 255.<br>
Hot air stream 255 at 80 to 300 psia passes through the feed side of membrane separation zone 267 comprising membrane 269, preferably a mixed conductor membrane, wherein oxygen diffuses through the membrane driven by an oxygen partial pressure differential in the range of 2 to 80 psi, and high purity oxygen stream 271 containing at least 90 vol% oxygen is withdrawn therefrom at a pressure of at least 2 psia. Hot non-permeate stream 273 is withdrawn at near feed pressure and contains 6 to 18 vol% oxygen. Membrane 269 operates in the temperature range of 8O0'F to 2,000'F, preferably 1,000 to 1,600°F. Membrane separation zone 257 typically is sized and operated such that up to about 80% of the oxygen in membrane feed 265 is recovered as product 271. Alternatively, ion transport membrane 269<br><br>
can be of the solid electrolyte type as described earlier which is driven by a voltage differential across the membrane in which electrons are conducted through an external circuit with porous electrodes attached to the surfaces of the membrane. In this mode of operation the oxygen permeate product can be recovered at or above the feed pressure.<br>
Ion transport membrane 269 typically comprises a solid ceramic assembly in the form of tubes, sheets, plates, or a monolithic honeycomb. The membrane divides membrane separation zone 257 into a feed side having a higher oxygen partial pressure and a permeate side having a lower oxygen partial pressure. Typical compositions of the active membrane material are given in representative articles by Y. Teraoka et al in Chemistry Letters. 1985, pp.1743-1746 and by H. Iwahara et al in Advances in Ceramics. Vol. 24: Science and Technology of Zirconia III, pp. 907-914, or in the article by J. D. Wright and R. J. Copeland earlier cited.<br>
Any solid ceramic membrane material which selectively permeates oxygen in the form of oxygen ions, of either the mixed conductor or solid electrolyte type described above, can be utilized in the present invention. Preferred membranes of the mixed conductor type are described in U.S. Patent 5,240,480, which is incorporated herein by reference. This patent discloses a membrane which comprises a porous layer with an average pore radius of less than 10 microns upon which is deposited a nonporous dense layer, in which both the porous substrate and the nonporous dense layer comprise multicomponent metallic oxides capable of conducting electrons and oxygen ions. This composite membrane operates at temperatures above 500'C and recovers high purity oxygen by the mechanism discussed earlier.<br><br>
Representative membranes are described  in which the porous   layer and/or the dense  layer are formed from a multicomponent metaUic oxide  selected  from the group consisting of Lao.jBao.eCo^aFeo^jOj.,,  Pr^.^Ba^.^Co^Jea^^O^.^,  and La,, ^BajgCOp jCjo_2Fe„_;03., where x is between 0 and  1.<br>
Preferred membranes of the solid electrolyte type can be fabricated by depositing a thin layer of miilticomponent oxide on a porous substrate as described in U.S.  Patent 5,160,618, which is incorporated herein by reference.    A preferred membrane comprises yttria-stabilized zirconia which has been deposited into the micropores of a lanthanum-doped  alumina surface layer of a porous alumina substrate having an average pore  diameter of less than about 50 nanometers and on the surface layer of the alumina substrate wherein the thickness of the yttria-stabilized zirconia  is  0.5 microns  or less.    The    yttria-stabi 1 ized zirconia layer is deposited  at  a temperature of 700-1100°C at a pressure of 1 to 750 torr over a time period ranging from 1 to 120 minutes by the following method.    At least two metal  halides,  for example yttrium chloride and zirconium chloride, are vaporized on one side of the substrate described above and an oxidizing gas such as a mixture of oxygen and water is contacted with the other side of the substrate.    The two gas mixtures diffuse and react within the pores  of the porous  surface layer to deposit the corresponding metal   oxides therein,   fonning the membrane capable of separating an oxygen-containing gas mixture by  the mechanism described earlier.    This thin coating of active membrane material can  be deposited on tubes,   sheets,  or monolithic honeycomb  before  or after assembly  in  a membrane module.<br><br>
Referring again to Fig.   2,  nonpemieate stream 273,   now containing  5 to  18 vo]% oxygen,  is combusted with fuel   275 in direct-fired  burner 277 (which typically is similar to burner 259)  to generate hot combustion product 279  at 800 to 3,000°F  at a pressure between 50 and  1,000 psia.     Fuel 275 is obtained as a portion of  fuel  gas 247 after compression  to 60 to 1,000 psia by compressor 253.     Hot combustion product 279 is  passed through hot gas expansion turbine 281 to generate shaft power, and exhaust 283 is withdrawn therefrom at SOCF to 1,400^ and a pressure slightly above atmospheric.    Turbine 281  is of the type well-known in the gas  turbine art and operates at a compression ratio of between 3 and 68.    Preferably, turbine 281  is mechanically linked with compressor 251  by  shaft 285 whereby the required compression power is supplied by turbine 281.    Optionally,   a portion of the shaft power of turbine 281  via shaft 282  is  used  to produce electricity  in generator 284.    Optionally,  at least a portion  of  turbine exhaust 283  can be utilized to preheat compressed  feed air 252   (not  shown). Preferably,  turbine exhaust 283  is utilized  in heat exchange  zone 286  to vaporize boiler feedwater 287  to generate steam 288 at  one or more pressure levels in the range of 50 to 2,500 psia.    Steam 288 can be exported as a major product,  or preferably  is expanded  in steam turbine 289  to drive generator 290 to produce additional  electricity for internal   use or export.<br>
Mixed conductor membrane separation zone 267 and expansion turbine 281 can be operated independently at different temperatures by appropriate control   of the respective firing  rates  of direct-fired  burners  259  and  277 by controlling  the  flow rates of fuel   gas 251  and 275  respectively.     For example,   a preferred membrane 269 operates  at  1,650'^F while  turbine 281 operates most efficiently at a  typical   inlet temperature of  2.000°F and  the<br><br>
process of the present  invention enables  independent control   of these temperatures by the two direct-fired burners 259 and 277.    Alternatively, direct-fired burner 277 can be controlled to produce a specified amount of power from turbine 281,<br>
In an  alternative mode of operation,  a portion 254 of compressed air 2b2 bypasses the oxygen recovery step and is combined with hot nonpermeate gas  273 prior to burner 277.     In this mode,  the firing rate of burner 277 is increased to maintain temperature to expansion turbine 281, which would be sized for a higher inlet gas rate.    This mode of operation would be chosen if excess export gas were available and increased power generation were required.     In  this option,  air 254 woujd be slightly throttled   (not shown)  or air 252 would be slightly boosted in pressure  (not  shown)   to compensate for pressure drop in heat exchange zone 255 and membrane separation zone 267.<br>
In an optional mode of operation, a portion 253 of compressed air 252 bypasses the oxygen recovery step and is combined with oxygen product 218 (not shown)   to produce a lower purity oxygen product.    Alternatively, compressed air 253 can be combined with the compressed high-purity oxygen from compressor 280 to yield a lower-purity oxygen stream 217 containing at least 90 vol% oxygen to melter-gasifier 213.    This alternative operation reduces  the required membrane surface area in membrane separation  zone 267 and allows the control of oxygen product purity.<br>
Hot oxygen penneate 271 is cooled,  for example by indirect heat exchange with water 272 in heat exchange zone 274 to generate steam 276,<br><br>
and the cooled oxygen 278 is compressed in compressor 280 to  100 to 250 psia to provide oxygen 217 to melter-gasifier 213.    Optionally,  a portion 218 of the compressed oxygen product from compressor 280 can be withdrawn as a product for external  use.    Cooled, partially reacted reducing gas streams 239 and 242 are combined into stream 292 which is compressed in compressor 293 to provide cooling gas 223, which then is mixed with hot reducing gas 222 from fnelter-gasifier 213.    Optionally,  inert gas 231 for conveying fines 229 into melter-gasifier 213 can be provided by removing residual oxygen from flue gas 291 by any known method and compressing the resulting inert gas  to the required pressure  (not shown).<br>
An alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig.  3 in which no electric power is generated and no additional oxygen is produced over that required for the melter-gasifier.    In this embodiment, compressed air 252 initially is heated in exchanger 254 by indirect heat exchange with partially reacted reducing gas 207 to yield heated air feed 258. which is further heated against hot gas 241 as earlier described in exchanger 255. Heated air feed stream 257 is further heated by burner 259 firing fuel  261 which is provided by cooled and compressed partially reacted reducing gas 251.    Hot feed 265 then passes through the feed side of membrane separation zone 267 and hot non-permeate stream 273 is withdrawn for further use. Such further use may include indirect heat exchange with water to raising steam,  indirect heat exchange with compressed oxygen 217 for preheat prior to introduction into melter-gasifier 213, or indirect heat exchange with compressed air 252 for preheat prior to membrane separation zone 267.<br><br>
Alternatively, compressed air 252 can be heated by one or a combination of any two of the heating means selected from heat exchanger 254, heat exchanger 255, and burner 259. For example, if desired the entire heating of compressed air 252 can be accomplished by burner 259, and beat exchangers 254 and 255 would not be required. If the temperature of cooled process stream 242 is at a temperature such that combined stream 292 is too hot for proper operation of compressor 293, a portion 294 of stream 242 can be combined with stream 235 before cooling and scrubbing in scrubber 237.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
A heat and material  balance was carried out to illustrate the invention according to Fig.  2 and the results are summarized  in Table  1. Coal  plus additives 215  (119,100 Ib/hr)   are reacted with oxygen 217   {99,900 Ib/hr)  in smelter/gasifier 213 at a pressure of 80 psia to melt iron therein and generate hot reducing gas.    Membrane separation zone 267  is operated at 870°C with a feed pressure of 200 psfa and a permeate pressure of 198 psia.    Reducing gas 205 after partial  cooling is used in preheating/reduction shaft 203 to heat and reduce iron ore plus additives 201   {200,800  Ib/hr).    The net products of the system are 113,400 Ib/hr of iron 221,  38,600 Ib/hr of slag 219,   54,500 Ib/hr of export fuel   gas  245. and  1,116,400 Ib/hr of flue gas 291  from turbine 281.    Air feed of 1,041,000  Ib/hr generates 99,900  Ib/hr of oxygen 217  via membrane zone  267 which  is  sufficient to supply the required amount of oxygen  for the process operation.    No export oxygen 218 is produced in this Example.    Export fuel gss 245 IS produced at the rate of 54,500 Ib/hr.     For each ton of iron 221<br><br>
produced,  0.88 ton of oxygen 217  is consumed,  0.48 ton  of export  fuel   gas 245 is produced,  and 1.02 MWhr of energy is generated by electric  generator 284.    The total   heat duties for oxygen cooler 274 and  flue gas  cooler 286 are 36.9 and 285.0 million BTU/hr respectively.<br><br><br><br>
While the invention as described above is illustrated  in  integration with the COREX    direct ironmaking process,  oxygen recovery by  an  ion transport membrane system can  be integrated with any ironmaking process which uses oxygen and generates sufficient amounts  of excess  heat.     The principles of integration described above can be utilized with other new or developing direct ironmaking methods including the ROMELT,  HiSMELT®,   DIOS, and the AISI In-Bath Smelting processes.    In addition, the principles of the present invention can be utilized with a modified blast furnace which utilizes the direct injection of fuels such as coal, oil, natural  gas.  and blast  furnace top recycle gas  in combination with oxygen.     In  this application of the invention,  the fuel   replaces or augments  a  portion  of the metallurgical  coke used in the blast furnace,  and the oxygen  is  added to replace or augment the oxygen normally  supplied to the blast  furnace  as air.<br>
Oxygen recovery by ion transport membrane systems can be utilized in conjunction with integrated with direct reduced iron (DRI)  processes which reduce  iron ore to yield a solid reduced metallic  iron  product   (sponge iron)  for further processing.    DRI product can be used as feed for electric furnace steelmaking and foundry operations,  as a replacement  for scrap  in open hearth furnaces,  and for increasing productivity and reducing coke ratio in blast furnaces and other smelting processes.    The DRI process utilizes  reducing gas comprising  hydrogen and carbon monoxide which   is 
 <br>
process technology  is well-known and  is described for example  in  the Encyclopedia of Chemical  Technology, Third Edition,  Vol   13,   pp.  754-763, John Wiley &amp; Sons,   1981.    Reducing gas can be generated by partial gasification of liquid hydrocarbons or by coal  gasification,  both of which require high purity oxygen.<br>
In an  alternative mode of the present invention,  oxygen  is  recovered by an ion transport membrane system as described above and used to generate reducing gas by any known partial  oxidation or coal   gasification process. The reduc-ing gas is used to convert iron ore to a reduced solid metallic iron product  in any known DRI  process,  and the partially reacted offgas   is cleaned and combusted to provide heat for operation of the ion transport membrane system.    Less heat is required in the OR! process than in direct ironmaking processes such as the COREX    process earlier described because the smelting step is omitted,  and therefore less carbon and oxygen are consumed  in  the DRI  process.    However,   the principle of  integration  of the DR!  process with the ion transport meinbrane system for oxygen  production   is similar to that earlier described for the COREX   process.<br>
Thus the essential   feature of the present  invention  is  that  the oxygen  required for either the integrated direct ironmaking  process  or  the direct reduced  iron   (DRI)   process  is produced at high  temperature  using heat and/or fuel  gas generated in the irornnaking or iron reduction process. In addition,   the nature of  the ionic transport membrane  is   such that  the nitrogen-enriched byproduct gas,   i.e.   nonpermeate  stream 273,   is withdrawn in a hot and pressurized state which is ideally suited for energy recovery in  a combustion  turbine system.    The  integration of the oxygen  separation<br><br>
and ironmaking processes  in  turn  is well-suited for further integration with combined cycle power generation,  and results  in a highly-efficient method for the production of Iron,  oxygen,   and electric power.    Optionally, the integrated system can be designed to provide oxygen, medium-BTU fuel gas,  and steam as one or more additional   products for export.<br>
The essential characteristics of the present invention are described completely in the foregoing disclosure.    One skilled in the art can understand the  invention and make various modifications  thereto without departing from the basic spirit thereof,   and without departing from the scope of the claims which follow.<br><br><br>
