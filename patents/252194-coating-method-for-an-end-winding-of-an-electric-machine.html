FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a coating method for an end winding of an electric<br>
machine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Coatings of different types and for different purposes are provided on the end<br>
winding of an electric machine, designed for example as an electrodynamic<br>
motor or generator. For example, they serve to provide electrical insulation,<br>
mechanical protection or chemical protection, and are produced by means of<br>
multiple impregnation with impregnating resins and impregnating varnishes or by<br>
casting with inorganically filled impregnating resins (=cast resin). Immersion<br>
methods or airless spray methods, for example, are used for this purpose.<br>
Because of the sometimes complex geometry of the end winding,-a layer<br>
produced using one of these known end winding coating methods does not have<br>
a uniform coating thickness throughout. Only lower coating thicknesses often<br>
result, particularly in the area of edges, points, clefts, undercuts or shaded areas.<br><br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention therefore consists in specifying a coating method of<br>
the kind described in the introduction with which a more uniform layer thickness<br>
of the end winding coating can be achieved.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This object is achieved by the features of the invention. The coating method<br>
according to the invention is such a method in which<br>
providing a laminated core (6,7) of an electric machine (4) with slots containing<br>
a conductor arrangement (2) which is fed out of the laminated core (6,7) at an<br>
end surface thereof to form an end winding (3);<br>
providing an electrostatic spray device (1);<br>
characterized by:<br>
applying an electrostatic potential to the laminated core (6,7) of the electric<br>
machine (4) to thereby establish an electrostatic potential difference (U) between<br>
the spray device (1) and the conductor arrangement (2);<br>
applying a first layer material (20) directly onto the conductor arrangement (2)<br>
to form a first coating with the spray device (1) such that atomized particles of<br>
the first layer material (20) are transported along electric field lines (14,16)<br><br>
which are generated as a result of the electrostatic potential difference (U); and<br>
applying a second layer material (21) that differs from the first layer material<br>
(20) all-round onto the first coating (20) with the spray device (1) such that<br>
atomized particles of the second layer material (21) are transported along<br>
electric field lines (14,16) which are generated as a result of the electrostatic<br>
potential difference (U).<br>
Very homogeneous layer thicknesses can be achieved with the coating method<br>
according to the invention, even in the case of complex end winding geometry.<br>
This also particularly applies to the problematic areas mentioned above. An<br>
increased field line density is present particularly at edges and points, which,<br>
inherently to the method, results in a higher transport rate of the atomized<br>
particles of the layer material, and the development of too low a layer thickness<br>
is counteracted virtually automatically. Shaded or undercut areas are also<br>
affected by the electric field lines so that an adequate layer thickness is achieved<br>
even here. No uncoated and therefore unprotected areas remain, even in these<br>
critical zones of the end winding. Furthermore, large layer thickness differences,<br>
such as are found with the known methods, are avoided.<br><br>
Particularly when applying an electrically insulating layer material, a kind of self-<br>
regulation occurs as the coating proceeds. An ever increasing electrical counter<br>
field is set up as the thickness of the applied material increases, as the charges<br>
are able to flow away less and less well or even not at all as a result of the<br>
growing insulating layer. This is beneficial, as electrically insulating layer<br>
materials are used almost exclusively, particularly when coating an end winding.<br>
The reason for using electrically insulating layer materials lies in the electrically<br>
active conductor arrangements to be coated, which carry current and are live<br>
during	the	operation	of	the	electric	machine.<br>
The coating method according to the invention is therefore used for coating<br>
electrically active parts. In contrast with this, the previously known electrostatic<br>
spray methods have always been used for coating electrically non-active parts.<br>
Furthermore, the coating method according to the invention is also very sparing<br>
on material consumption due to the field-line-controlled and therefore very<br>
accurate material feed as well as the described self-regulation. Compared with<br>
the conventional immersion methods or airless spray methods, this results in a<br>
reduction of the required layer material by about 30%.<br><br>
There is both a first variant, in which the spray device is connected to a high<br>
electrostatic potential, in particular lying in the kV range, and a second variant, in<br>
which the conductor arrangements of the end winding to be coated are<br>
connected to a high electrostatic potential. In the first variant, the end winding<br>
including its conductor arrangements are connected particularly to ground. In the<br>
second variant, a ground connection is particularly made to the spray device. In<br>
both cases, the particles are transported beneficially along the electric field lines.<br>
Furthermore, a laminated core, which is part of a stator or a rotor of the electric<br>
machine for example, can also be connected to a high electrostatic potential. The<br>
conductor arrangements are laid in slots of the laminated core, in particular<br>
electrically insulated with respect to the laminated core, and are fed out of the<br>
laminated core at two face surfaces. The conductor arrangements, which are fed<br>
out here, form an end winding at each face end. Electrical contact can easily be<br>
made to the laminated core, which in particular is made from electrically<br>
conducting iron sheets, and the laminated core can therefore easily be connected<br>
to the high electrical potential. Once again there is a beneficial path of the<br>
electric field lines from the spray device to the conductor arrangements of the<br>
end winding to be coated.<br><br>
In a further embodiment, the conductor arrangements of the end winding are<br>
coated with a layer material made from impregnating resin, insulating varnish or<br>
silicone rubber. These materials serve to provide mechanical or chemical<br>
protection or protection against moisture or saline mist, or electrical insulation.<br>
At the same time, depending on the application, the silicone rubber can also be<br>
in the form of a gel-like extensively self-healing polymer material. In particular, it<br>
is a silicone gel with a very good adhesive capability and a particularly high<br>
elasticity, accordingly with a very low modulus of elasticity (=Young's modulus).<br>
Preferably, in addition, a layer thickness of a coating to be applied to the<br>
conductor arrangements of the end winding is set by means of the value of the<br>
electrostatic potential difference, that is to say the electric field strength. In this<br>
way, layer thicknesses between 0.1 mm and 1 mm can be realized without any<br>
problems, a layer thickness in the range of 0.1 mm being used rather for a<br>
moisture-repellent coating, and a layer thickness in the range of 1 mm being<br>
used rather for a coating intended as the main electrical insulation.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Further characteristics, advantages and details of the invention can be seen from<br>
the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawing. In the drawing:<br>

coating of an end winding of an electric machine formed from several conductor<br>
arrangements,<br>

and<br>
FIG. 5 shows a cross section through a coated conductor arrangement according<br>
to FIG. 1.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Corresponding parts are given the same references in FIGS. 1 to 5.<br>
FIG. 1 shows an exemplary embodiment of a spray device 1 for the electrostatic<br>
coating of two end windings 3 of an electric machine 4, which is shown in partial<br>
cross section, wherein said windings are formed from several conductor<br>
arrangements 2.<br>
The section through the electric machine 4 runs along an axis of rotation 5<br>
through a stator 6 of the electric machine 4 and shows only part of the top half<br>
of the stator 6. An actually active area 7 with the iron laminations of the stator<br>
and the electric coil conductors guided in slots is not shown in detail but only<br>
schematically. The end windings 3 are arranged on both axial face ends of the<br>
active area 7. They are formed by a large number of electrical conductor<br>
arrangements 2, which are fed out of the iron laminations of the stator in the<br>
direction of the axis of rotation 5. The end windings 3 and in particular the<br>
conductor arrangements 2, which run in the area of the end windings 3, are<br>
protectively coated by means of the spray device 1.<br>
The spray device 1 comprises a spray gun 8, which is connected to a main unit<br>
11 by means of a material feed line 9 and an electrical feed line 10. Components<br>
such as a material storage container and an electrical high-voltage source, which<br>
are not shown in detail, are accommodated in the main unit 11.<br><br>
The spray device 1 works on the electrostatic spray method principle. Here, a<br>
high electrical voltage U is applied between the output nozzle of the spray gun 8<br>
and the object to be coated, that is to say in the exemplary embodiment the<br>
conductor arrangements 2 of the end winding 3. The layer material to be applied<br>
is atomized at the nozzle and in particular sprayed or squirted in the direction of<br>
the conductor arrangements 2, whereby the thus atomized electrically charged<br>
material particles move along the electric field lines toward the conductor<br>
arrangements 2 to be coated.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, the output nozzle of the spray gun 8 is at a high<br>
electrostatic potential of several kV, whereas the conductor arrangements 2 are<br>
connected to ground potential. However, in principle, these electrical potential<br>
connections can also be reversed.<br>
The electrostatic' spray method used enables the electrically active conductor<br>
arrangements 2 of the end windings 3 to be coated very uniformly. A good<br>
coating also results in problematic zones where only a reduced material coating<br>
or even none at all is achieved with other coating methods.<br><br>
Examples of such problematic zones are shown in FIGS. 2 to 4. An object 12 with<br>
a protruding edge 13 to be coated is shown in FIG. 2. Electric field lines 14,<br>
which form between the output nozzle of the spray gun 8 and the object 12, are<br>
also shown. A higher field line density is produced in the area of the edge 13 so<br>
that material is also transported to this point at a higher rate. A sufficiently thick<br>
coating is therefore also applied to the . edge 13.<br>
According to the illustration in FIG. 3, the conductor arrangements 2 can be<br>
placed next to one another in such a way that parts of the surfaces to be coated<br>
are shaded with respect to the spray gun 8 and are therefore barely or not at all<br>
accessible for conventional coating methods. These shadings or undercuts are<br>
shown by 15 in FIG. 3. With the electrostatic spray method, they are also<br>
affected by electric field lines 16 and consequently also coated.<br>
According to the illustration of FIG. 4, two adjacent conductor arrangements 2<br>
can be fed so that they form a cleft 17, which is also difficult to access for<br>
conventional coating methods. This critical area can also be coated by means of<br>
the electrostatic spray method.<br>
From the cross-section through one of the coated conductor arrangements 2<br>
shown in FIG. 5, it can be seen that, in the exemplary embodiment, the<br>
conductor arrangements 2 used for the coil windings are made up of several<br><br>
partial conductors 18, which are electrically insulated with respect to one<br>
another. The partial conductors 18 consist of copper bars. Each partial conductor<br>
18 is enclosed by a partial conductor insulation 19 made of a Kapton film.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, the coating produced by means of the<br>
electrostatic spray method has two layers. It includes an inner first covering layer<br>
20 and an outer second covering layer 21. The first covering layer 20, which is<br>
applied directly to the conductor arrangement 2, consists of a silicone gel, and<br>
the second covering layer 21 consists of a cast resin. However, in principle, a<br>
rubber-elastic silicone rubber can also be provided in place of the cast resin.<br>
Thanks to the particularly beneficial electrostatic spray method used for<br>
production, the two covering layers 20 and 21 each have a layer thickness, which<br>
is practically uniform overall. The two covering layers 20 and 21 also carry out<br>
the function of the main electrical insulation so that an additional intermediate<br>
insulation layer can be dispensed with. This simplifies the construction, and the<br>
manufacturing costs are reduced. The intermediate insulation layer, which is<br>
otherwise provided, consists of winding the conductor arrangements 2 with mica<br>
tape. This winding is laborious, particularly in the area of the end windings 3,<br>
and can often only be carried out by hand. In contrast, an electrostatic spray<br>
method can be carried out without any problems in an automated manner.<br><br>
