				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to methylol compounds used in a method for preservation of natural rubber latex.<br>
2.	Background of the Disclosure<br>
Natural rubber latex is the sap of a specialized type of cell in Hevea hrasiliensis and other rubber-supplying plants. As such, it is a complex biochemical system. It is therefore not surprising that obvious chemical changes occur shortly after the latex leaves the tree. The first of these changes is that the latex coagulates within a few hours. This process is known as spontaneous coagulation. The time required for coagulation depends upon the ambient temperature and upon the colloid stability of the latex. The second of the obvious changes is putrefaction with the development of bad odours. It is to prevent both these processes occurring that preservation is necessary,<br>
Today, ammonia is used as standard preservative for NR latex. Ammonia is a bactericide, enhances colloid stability of the latex, and deactivates magnesium ions. Although ammonia possesses such satisfactory preservative properties, it also has disadvantages. One of disadvantages arises when the preserved latex containing ammonia is processed since ammonia fumes are emitted which pollute or otherwise adversely affect the environment. The emission of the ammonia fumes makes the working environment very unpleasant for the workers or other personnel and may indeed be injurious or hazardous to the health of them, Another problem arising from the emission of ammonia fumes relates to corrosion of factory buildings and roofs. Moreover, because ammonia is easy to evaporate, the amount of ammonia in me latex<br>
is also difficult to control. This can affect the qualities of the latex, in particular its variability. Therefore, a continual search has been made for new preservative systems that are not subject to these disadvantages. Many alternatives to ammonia have been considered.<br>

known methods mentioned above for natural rubber latex preservation are not without disadvantages. For example, the uses of most of those reagents are toxicologically unacceptable and the preserved latex causes corrosion of equipments. Moreover, under certain conditions the reagents such as ZDEC and TMTD spilt off diethylamine or dimethylamine, from which carcinogenic nitrosamines can then be formed due to the action of the almost omnipresent nitrogen oxides or other nitrosation agents.<br>
Furthermore, in addition to the bacterial attacking problem, multivalent metal ions, especially magnesium ion, also tend to reduce the colloid stability of the natural rubber latex preserved by the traditional systems. In the present time, it is therefore necessary to remove them prior to the centrifugation process. Not only the preservative is added to the latex, but large amount of multivalent metal ions deactivating agent is also required.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to method for preservation of natural rubber latex by using methylol compound to prevent rubber coagulation. This method is useful in order to obtain neutral- pH (pH ~ 7-8), low corrosion and low toxicity natural rubber latex which can be stored for long time. Moreover, the method can reduce an amount of multivalent metal ions deactivating agent used in the concentrated natural rubber latex production process. The present invention consist of adding methylol compound to field natural rubber latex and then convert to concentrated natural rubber latex by centrifugation. After that, the concentrated natural rubber latex is added with multivalent metal ions deactivating agent and surfactant.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The overall method for preservation of field natural rubber latex by using methylol compounds will be explained below.<br>
1. The field natural rubber latex is mixed with methylol compound at least one type such as salts of hydroxylmethylaminoacetate (sodium hydroxymethylglycinate and/or potassium hydroxymethylglycinate etc.), bicyclic oxazolidine, diazolidinyl urea, imidazolidinyl urea, and include other chemicals which can release formaldehyde<br>
about 0.1-2.0% by weight of the latex. The mixture is then stirred to ensure thorough mixing of the system.<br>
2. The mixtures of field natural rubber latex and methylol compound are converted to concentrated natural rubber latex by centrifugation and then added with multivalent metal ions deactivating agent at least one type of disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetate (Na2EDTA) and tetrasodium ethylene diamine tetraacetate (Na4EDTA) about 0.01-10.0% by weight of the latex. The concentrated latex mixture is stirred and added with anionic surfactant and/or non-ionic surfactant in amount of 0.01-1.0% weight of the latex.<br>
This method is useful in order to obtain neutral pH (pH ~ 7-8), low corrosion and low toxicity natural rubber latex which can be stored for long time. Moreover, the method can reduce an amount of multivalent metal ions deactivating agent used in the concentrated natural rubber latex production process.<br>
Moreover, the multivalent metal ions deactivating agent can also be added before converting of field natural rubber latex to concentrated natural rubber latex. The method will be explained below.<br>
1.	The field natural rubber latex is added with methylol compound at least one type<br>
such as salts of hydroxylmethylaminoacetate (sodium hydroxymethylglycinate and/or<br>
potassium hydroxymethylglycinate etc.), bicyclic oxazolidine, diazolidinyl urea,<br>
imidazolidinyl urea, and include other chemicals which can release formaldehyde.<br>
The concentration of methylol compound is about 0.1-2.0% by weight of the latex.<br>
The mixture is then stirred to ensure thorough mixing of the system. After that, this<br>
mixture is mixed with multivalent metal ions deactivating agent at least one type such<br>
as disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetate (Na2EDTA), tetrasodium ethylene diamine<br>
tetraacetate (NaiEDTA), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), sodium metasilicate (Na2SiO3),<br>
sodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HP04), sodium phosphate (Na3PO4),<br>
tripolyphosphate (Na5P3O10), potassium hydrogen phosphate (K2HPO4), potassium<br>
carbonate (K2CO3), and diarnmonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH4)2HPO4) in amount<br>
of 0.01-10.0% weight of the latex. The mixture latex is stirred to ensure thorough<br>
mixing of the system at room temperature.<br>
2.	The latex mixtures are converted to concentrated natural rubber latex by<br>
centrifugation. The concentrated latex mixture is then stirred and added with anionic<br>
surfactant and/or non-ionic surfactant in amount of 0.01-1.0% weight of the latex.<br>
This method is useful in order to obtain neutral pH (pH ~ 7-8), low corrosion and low toxicity natural rubber latex which can be stored for long time. Moreover, in this method, the methylol compounds can also be use in combination with ammonium, base, and other antiseptic, bactericide, and fungicide such as iodopropynylbutylcarbamate (IPBC) to reduce used methylol compounds quantity. The other preservative is added in amount of 0.01-1.0% weight of the latex.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the following example.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 The field natural rubber latex form rubber tree was divided to the parts and then added with methylol compounds such as sodium hydroxymethylglycinate, diazolidinyl urea, and imidazolidinyl urea in various concentrations. This method might be combined with other preservatives such as iodopropynylbutylcarbamate (IPBC). The latex mixture was stirred to ensure thorough mixing of the system at room temperature. It was found that the latex mixture was neutral pH and had not problem in convert to concentrated latex. Table 1 showed volatile fatty acid number of the latex mixtures. From the results, it could be seen that the field natural rubber latex which was preserved with methylol compounds and/or combined with other perservative had long storage of time.<br>
