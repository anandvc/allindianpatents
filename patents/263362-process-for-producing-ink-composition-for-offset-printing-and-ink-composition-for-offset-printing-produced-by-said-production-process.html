TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing an ink composition for offset printing and the ink composition for offset printing obtained by the method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART. [0002]<br>
In order to produce a black ink composition for offset<br>
printing, it is necessary to enhance the fluidity and.the color<br>
developing effect of a carbon black by adequately dispersing<br>
the carbon black in ah oil-based varnish for a printing ink.<br>
[0003]<br>
Generally, a carbon black used in the black ink composition for offset printing is an acid powder carbon black, the surface of which is oxidation treated with ozone or chemicals.<br>
Even though the dispersion of this acid powder carbon black is carried out by an extremely simple method that the . powder carbon black .is milled-in the oi.l-based varnish for a printing ink in a dry condition, a carbon black in the black ink composition for offset printing to be obtained has excellent age stability. Further, when the black ink composition is used to perform sheet-fed printing, the resulting printed substances have good printing quality such as gloss and a jet-black property.<br>
In recent years, use of a neutral carbon black, however, . is studied because the neutral carbon black is less expensive than the acid powder carbon black.<br><br>
[0004]<br>
The neutral carbon black is inferior in wettability on ah oil-based varnish, which is an essential property for dispersing in the oil-based varnish although being able to be produced at low cost without a special treatment. Accordingly, when the neutral carbon black is dispersed in the oil-based varnish by a conventional dispersion method, the productivity is significantly decreased, a pigment remains without being dispersed, and a particle size distribution becomes broad. As the result of this, the printed substances obtained by performing sheet-fed printing with the black ink composition for offset printing had a problem of becoming lower in printing quality than the printed substances using the acid powder carbon black. [0005]<br>
In order to solve this problem, a black ink composition for offset printing, in which a neutral carbon black and a resin used in a printing ink which is solid at room temperature are kneaded and dry-milled in advance, and the resulting milled mixture is mixed and dispersed in a varnish for a printing ink, is proposed (for example, refer to Patent Document 1).<br>
However&gt; this method had a problem that in order to obtain-such a composition, facilities for dry-milling (dry type attritor, ball mill, vibration mill, or the like) is newly needed and determination of optimal milling conditions is difficult: Further, it is inevitable that the number of production processes increases and therefore production time and energy cost increase. [0006]<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Kokai Publication No. 2002-327143 .<br>
SUMMARY.OF THE INVENTION [0007]<br>
As described above, even when a low-cost neutral carbon<br><br>
black is used, 'a coriventional method of producing a printing ink had a defect of requiring extra facilities and production cost.  Further, when the ink prepared by the method of producing is used to perform sheet-fed printing, the resulting printed substances had a defect of declining in printing quality-compared with printed substances using the acid powder carbon black, or the like.  Thus, it was impossible to take advantage of the neutral carbon black by a conventional method of producing a printing ink. [0008]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of producing an ink composition for offset printing, which can improve the productivity of inks considerably while using the neutral carbon black.  Further, it is another object of the present invention to provide an ink composition for offset printing having a characteristic that when being used for sheet-fed printing, the printing quality of printed substances to be obtained is higher than that to be obtained in using the acid carbon black, which is obtained by the above-mentioned production method. [0009]<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the present inventors made earnest investigations, and consequently they have found that all of the problems can' be solved by wetting the neutral carbon black with a wetting agent containing at least water, and then using an oil-based varnish for a printing ink containing an alkyd resin having an acid value of 30 KOH mg/g or less to perform flushing.  These findings have now led to completion of the present invention. [0010]<br>
That is, the present invention pertains to (1) a method of producing an ink composition for offset printing, including the steps of<br>
wetting 300 parts by mass of a neutral carbon black with 100 to 900 parts by mass of a wetting agent containing at least<br><br>
water,<br>
using an oil-based varnish for a printing ink containing an alkyd resin having an acid value of 30 KOH mg/g or less to perform flushing of the wetted neutral carbon black, and then<br>
removing the wetting agent. [0011]<br>
In addition, the present invention pertains to (2) the method of producing an ink composition for offset printing as described in (1), further including the step of<br>
milling with a roll mill or a bead mill after completion of the.steps of wetting, performing flushing and then removing the wetting agent. [0012]<br>
In addition, the present invention pertains to (3) the method of producing an ink composition for offset printing as described in (1) or (2),<br>
wherein a neutral carbon black having a bulk density of 0.1 to 0.8 g/cm3 and an average primary particle diameter of 15 to 70 nm is used as the neutral carbon black. [0013]'<br>
In addition, the present invention pertains to (4) the method of producing an ink composition for offset printing as described in any one of (1) to (3),<br>
wherein the neutral carbon black is a neutral bead carbon black having a bulk density of 0.3 to 0.8 g/cm3 and an average primary particle diameter of 15 to 70 nm. [0014]<br>
In addition, the present invention pertains to (5) the method of producing anink composition for offset printing as described in any one of (1) to (4),<br>
wherein a vegetable oil modified alkyd resin is used as the alkyd resin. [00.15]<br>
In addition, the present invention pertains to (6) the method of producing an ink composition for offset printing as<br><br>
described in any one of (1) to (5),<br>
wherein the content of the alkyd resin is 1 to 40% by mass with respect to the neutral carbon black. [0016]<br>
Further, the present invention pertains to (7) an ink composition for offset printing prepared by the method of producing an ink composition for offset printing as described in any one of (1) to (6). [0017]<br>
Further, the present invention pertains to (8) the ink composition for offset printing as. described in (7),<br>
wherein the ink composition for offset printing is an ink composition for sheet-fed offset printing.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0018]<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail.<br>
First, constituent materials of an ink composition for offset printing in the present invention, and apparatuses used in the production method will be described. [0019]<br><constituent materials used in.the method of producing an ink composition for offset printing the present invention><br>
Constituent materials used in the method of producing an ink composition for offset printing of the present invention will' be described.<br>
First, the carbon black is not particularly limited'as long as it is a neutral carbon black having a pH value of 6.0 to 8.0, but the production method of the present invention is. effective for a neutral carbon black having a bulk density of 0.1 to 0.8 g/cm3 and an average primary particle diameter of 15 to 70 nm, and in particular, more effective for a neutral bead carbon black having a bulk density of 0.3 to 0.8 g/cm3 and an average primary particle diameter of 15 to 70 nm. Among the<br><br>
neutral bead carbon'blacks,' a neutral bead carbon black for color and a neutral bead carbon black for rubber are particularly effective in view of the objects of the present invention because they hardly cause dust particles and are low-priced and hard to disperse compared with the neutral powder carbon black. [0020]<br>
The bulk density was measured according to JIS K 6219. [0021]<br>
The average primary particle diameter is an arithmetic mean value of particle diameters determined by the observation of particles through an electron microscope. [0022]<br>
Next, in the present invention, in order to wet the neutral carbon black, a wetting agent containing at least water is used. As the wetting agent, water can be used and a solvent compatible with water which can be used in combination with water can be used as required, but it is preferred to reduce an amount of the solvent compatible with water as far as possible from the viewpoint of environment and the wettability of the neutral carbon black. Specifically, the wetting agent preferably contains water in an amount of 50% by mass or more of the total amount of the wetting agent, and it is particularly preferredthat the wetting agent contains only water; When the amount of water is less than 50% by mass, wettability tends to decrease.' In addition, kinds ofv"water to be used is not particularly limited, and for example, running water, ion-exchange water, distilled water can be used, but it is preferred to use ion-exchange water in that the content of water-soluble ionic substances having negative effects on printing is small. [0023]<br>
The solvent compatible with water is not particularly limited, and examples of the solvent include ethanol, ethylene glycol and the like.<br><br>
[0024]        '<br>
An amount of the wetting agent with which the neutral carbon black is wetted is 100 to 900 parts by mass with respect to 300 parts by mass of the neutral carbon black, and is preferably 150 to 550 parts by mass in consideration of quality of a paper face and ease of removal of the wetting agent containing water. When the amount of the wetting agent is less than 100 parts by mass, good dispersibility cannot be attained and there is a problem of deteriorating workability due to flying of the neutral carbon black.  On the other hand, when the amount of the wetting agent is more than 900 parts by mass, there are problems that the productivity is decreased since the time required to remove the wetting agent becomes longer and an extra treatment is needed since an amount of the wetting agent • to be removed increases. [0025]<br>
Next, as the alkyd resin which is a component of the oil-based varnish for a printing ink, an alkyd resin having an acid value of 30 KOH mg/g or less is used. An alkyd resin having .. ., an acid value of 10 KOH mg/g or less can be preferably used, and an alkyd resin having an acid value of 5 KOH mg/g or -less can be more preferably used.  The species of alkyd resin is not particularly limited, but it is preferably a vegetable oil modified alkyd resin. As the vegetable oil modified alkyd resin, specifically, a soybean oil.modified alkyd resin, a linseed oil .. modified alkyd resin, and a tung oil modified alkyd resin can be exemplified. Among vegetable oil modified alkyd resins, a vegetable oil modified alkyd resin having a basic skeleton consisting of isophthalic acid is preferred.  In addition, in the ink for sheet-fed printing to form an ink coat by oxidative polymerization, an alkyd resin modified with a semi-drying oil or a drying oil is preferred. [0026]<br>
An amount of the alkyd resin to be used is preferably in a range of 1 to 40% by mass with respect to 100% by mass of the<br><br>
neutral carbon black. When this amount is less than 1% by mass with respect to the neutral carbon black,, the dispersibility • is not adequate, and on the other hand, when this amount is more than 40% by mass, excessive emulsification of dampening water to the resulting ink composition for offset printing occurs and this tends to have a detrimental effect on printing suitability. However, since an adequate amount of the alkyd resin to be used varies with the species of the alkyd resin,, or the species or use amount of the neutral carbon black or other materials used in combination, it is preferred to select an adequate amount of the alkyd resin to be used within the above-mentioned range. [0027]<br>
Here, an acid value was measured according to JIS K 5601-2-1. [0028]<br>
As an oil-based varnish for a printing ink used for the production method of the present invention, a binder resin and an oily liquid are used in combination with the alkyd resin. [0029] '    •        .<br>
As the above-mentioned binder resin, rosin modified phenolic resins, rosin modified maleic resins, and polyester resins not containing phenol, used in inks for offset printing, can be used without particular limitation.  In addition, petroleum resins can be used together as required. [0030]<br>
It is proper that the total amount of the-alkyd resin and the binder resin to be used in the ink composition for offset printing is generally in a range of 20 to 60% by mass. [0031]<br>
An amount of the oily liquid is not particularly limited, '<br>
but it is preferred that the oily liquid is used so as to be<br>
20 to 70% by mass with respect to the whole oil-based varnish<br>
for a printing ink.<br>
[0032].	■	•    ■<br>
As the oily liquid, vegetable oil components and mineral<br><br>
oil components can be used.<br>
Examples of the vegetable oil components include vegetable oils and fatty acid ester compounds derived -from a vegetable oil.<br>
As the vegetable oil, drying oils or semi-drying oils suitable for offset printing such as a soybean oil, a cotton seed oil, a linseed oil, a safflower oil, a tung oil, a tall oil, a dehydrated caster oil and a canola oil can be exemplified. These oils may be used singly or in combination of two or more species. [0033] .<br>
Examples of the fatty acid ester compounds derived from a vegetable oil include monoalkyl ester compounds of fatty acids derived from the drying oils or semi-drying oils. As a fatty acid composing such fatty acid monoester, a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid having 16 to 20 carbon atoms is preferred, and stearic acid, isostearic acid, hydroxystearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, eleostearic acid and the like can be exemplified. Alkyl groups derived from an alcohol, which composes the fatty acid monoester, are preferably groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and alkyl groups of methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, 2-ethylhexyl or • the like can be exemplified.  These fatty acid monoesters can be used alone or in combination of two or more specie's.<br>
Examples of the mineral oil components include substances which are-not compatible with water, and have a boiling point<br>
of 160°C or higher, preferably a boiling point of 200°C or higher. Specifically, n-paraffinic solvents, isoparaffinic solvents, naphthenic solvents, aromatic solvents, a-olefinic petroleum •solvents, light gas oil, spindle oil, machine oil, cylinder oil, turpentine oil, mineral spirits and the like can be exemplified. [0034]<br>
In the oil-based varnish for a printing ink, as for vegetable oil components and mineral oil components, a vegetable oil component may be used singly, and a fatty acid<br><br>
ester or a mineral 'oil may be used singly, and the vegetable oil component may be used in conjunction with the mineral oil component. .[0035]<br>
Furthermore, additives such as a gelling agent, a drier,, a drying-retarder, an antioxidant, a anti scumming aid, a friction resistance improver, an antioffset agent and a nonionic surfactant, and the like can be appropriately used as required. [0036]<br><method of producing an ink composition for offset printing the present invention><br>
Next, the method of producing an ink composition for offset printing of the present invention will be described.<br>
The present invention pertains to a method of producing an ink composition for offset printing, including the steps of wetting 300 parts by mass of a neutral carbon black with 100 to 900 parts by mass of a wetting agent containing at least water, using an oil-based varnish for a printing ink containing an alkyd resin having an acid value of 30 KOH mg/g or less to perform flushing of the foregoing wetted neutral carbon black, and then removing the wetting agent. [0037]<br>
In the method of producing an ink composition for offset printing of the present invention, an apparatus to wet the neutral carbon black is not particularly limited,, but either' a disper or a flusher (kneader) is preferably used. [0038]<br>
In the method of- producing an ink composition for offset printing of the present invention, "flushing" refers to a step of mixing/stirring a neutral carbon black wetted with a wetting agent containing at least water and an oil-based varnish to convert the neutral carbon black from a water phase to an oily phase. An apparatus used in flushing is not particularly limited, and for example, a flusher (kneader) or a stirring<br><br>
apparatus having a mechanism capable of removing the wetting<br>
agent can be used.<br>
[0039]<br>
In the method of producing an ink composition for offset printing of the present invention, the wetting agent is removed until the content of the wetting agent containing water in the flushed composition becomes preferably 2% by mass or less. Further, in the production method of the present invention, it is preferred to undergo the step of milling after completion of the steps of wetting, performing flushing and then removing the wetting agent. An apparatus for milling is not particularly limited, and for example, a roll mill Or a bead mill can be used. In this step, the carbon black is milled until a particle diameter of the ink composition for offset printing becomes,<br>
for example, 5 um or less which is smaller than a printed film thickness.  This particle diameter can be measured with, for example, a grind gauge. [0040]<br>
In the present invention, an "oil-based varnish for a printing ink containing an alkyd resin having an acid value of 30 KOH mg/g or less" used at the time of flushing may become a state in which an oil-based varnish for a printing ink contains an alkyd resin having an acid value of 30 KOH mg/g or less in a predetermined amount as a result at the time of flushing. Therefore, methods of adding the respective components at the time of. preparing is not particularly limited, and the' ink composition may be prepared by any method. [0041]<br>
That is, the oil-based varnish for a printing ink may be prepared by dissolving the binder resin and the alkyd resin- in a vegetable oil component and/or a mineral oil component in advance when performing flushing so that the content of the alkyd resin becomes a predetermined amount. Alternatively, for example, when the alkyd resin is liquid, the oil-based varnish for a printing ink may be prepared in such a way that<br><br>
the content of the alkyd resin becomes a predetermined amount ultimately by a method in which the alkyd resin and a binder resin oil-based varnish formed by dissolving the binder resin in a vegetable oil component and/or a mineral oil component are separately added. [0042]<br>
A method of producing an ink composition for offset printing using the oil-based varnish for a printing ink prepared by dissolving the binder resin and the alkyd resin in a vegetable oil component and/or a mineral oil component in advance is not particularly limited, and example of this method include a method including the steps of putting/stirring the neutral carbon black and the wetting agent containing at least water in a disper or a- flusher (kneader) to wet the neutral carbon black, then adding the oil-based varnish for a printing ink to the wetted substance of the neutral carbon black, flushing the resulting mixture with the flusher (kneader) or a stirring apparatus having a mechanism capable of removing the wetting agent, and removing the wetting agent until the content of the wetting agent in the composition obtained by flushing becomes preferably 2% by mass or less.  Further, there, is a method in which after the above-mentioned method, the ink composition for offset printing is obtained by adding the oil-based varnish for a p'rinting ink or the binder resin oil-based varnished as required, undergoing the step of milling/dispersing with a bead mill or a three-roll mill,-- and adjusting the obtained milled mixture to a prescribed viscosity by adding a residual material. [0043]<br>
In addition, examples of a method in which the liquid alkyd resin and the binder resin oil-based varnish are separately added at the time of flushing to prepare the oil-based varnish for a printing, ink include, for example, a method in which the oil-based varnish' for a printing ink is obtained by following the same procedure as in the above-mentioned method except that the liquid alkyd resin and<br><br>
the binder resi'n oil-based varnish are separately added when<br>
performing flushing.<br>
[0044]<br>
In addition, aproper amount (about 15% by mass or less with respect to the binder resin) of a gelling agent can be added to the binder resin oil-based varnish as required to crosslink the resin.  In such a case, examples of the gelling agent to be used include aluminum alcoholates, aluminum chelate compounds and the like, and as preferable specific examples, aluminum triisopropoxide, mono-sec-butoxy aluminum diisopropoxide, aluminum, tri-sec-butyoxide, ethyl acetoacetate aluminum diisopropoxide, aluminum tris-ethyl acetoacetate and the like can be exemplified. [0045]<br>
As described above, by the method of producing an ink composition for offset printing of the present invention, it is possible to improve the productivity of inks considerably compared with the conventional method while using the neutral carbon black. Further, the printing ink composition obtained has performance which is equivalent to the printing, ink composition formed by using the acid carbon black, its carbon black has good dispersibility and age stability, and when the ink composition for offset printing of the present invention is used for sheet-fed printing, printing quality such as gloss and a degree of jet black becomes good.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION [0046]<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail by way of Examples, but the present invention'is not limited to these Examples. In addition, "%" and "part(s)" refer to "% by mass" and "part(s) by mass", unless otherwise specified. Further, in the following Examples, Comparative Examples and Reference Examples, a bulk density was measured according to JIS K 6219, and an acid value was measured according<br><br>
to JIS K 5601-2^1 as described above. Further, as described above, an average primary particle diameter is an arithmetic mean value of particle diameters determined by the observation of particles through an electron microscope. [0047] ' <example><br>
224 parts of a neutral bead carbon black for color (BLACK PEARL S430, produced by Cabot Corp. ) having a pH of 7 . 0, a primary particle diameter of 27 nm and a bulk density of 0.42 g/cm3, and 224 parts of a wetting agent (running water) were mixed at<br>
25°C for 30 minutes in a bench flusher (manufactured by Inoue KikaiCo., Ltd.) to wet the carbon black, and 56 parts of a liquid soybean oil modified alkyd resin 1 (acid value 5 KOH mg/g) having a basic skeleton consisting of isophthalic acid was added, and then 200 parts of a binder resin oil-based varnish 1 containing a rosin modified phenolic resin (a weight-average molecular weight 10000), a soybean oil, and AF Solvent No. 6 (trade name, a mineral oil component, a solvent for a printing ink, produced by Nippon Oil Corp. ) in a mass ratio of 40:25:35 was added, and<br>
. the resulting mixture was flushed at 50°C for 60 minutes (incidentally, herein, a substance formed by adding the liquid soybean oil modified alkyd resin 1 to the binder resin oil-based varnish 1 corresponds to an oil-based varnish 1 for a printing ink (refer to ..Table 1) ) . Thereafter, a main body of the flusher was inclined, and the transuded wetting agent was removed, and<br>
: • further the wetting agent was removed under a reduced pressure<br>
at 100°C over 60 minutes to reduce the content of the wetting agent remaining in the base to 2% or less .  Thereafter, 320 parts of a binder resin oil-based varnish 2 containing a rosin modified phenolic resin (a weight-average molecular weight 80000), a soybean oil, AF Solvent No. 6, and ALCH (ethyl acetoacetate aluminum diisopropoxide) in a mass ratio of 40:30:29:1 was added,, and the resulting mixture was milled and dispersed until measurement of a particle diameter by a grind gauge became 5 um or less with a three-roll mill (manufactured<br><br>
by Inoue Kikai Co., Ltd.) of 45°C to obtain a base ink 1 for offset printing. To 70 parts of this base ink 1 for offset printing, 13 parts of the binder resin oil-based varnish 2 and 7 parts of the AF Solvent No. 6 were added to obtain an ink composition 1 for .offset printing. [0048] <example><br>
A base ink 2 for offset printing and an ink composition<br>
2	for offset printing were obtained by using the same materials<br>
and the same production conditions as in Example 1 except for<br>
adding 256 parts of an oil-based varnish 2 for a printing ink<br>

[0063] <evaluation><br>
The dispersibility, the gloss and the jet-black property of each ink composition for offset printing of Examples 1 to 8, Comparative Examples 1 to 6, and Reference Examples 1 and 2 were evaluated according the following methods. The results of the evaluations are shown in. Tables 6 and 7. In addition, the compositions of the oil-based varnishes for printing inks are shown in Table 1. Further, the compositions of the base inks 1 to 16 for offset printing described above are shown in Tables 2 and 3, and the compositions of the ink compositions 1 to 16 for offset printing described above are shown in Tables 4 and 5.<br><br>
[0064]<br>
(1)	Dispersibility<br>
In preparation of the base inks 1 to 16 for offset printing, a number of passes of a roll mill that is required before a particle diameter measured by a grind gauge of a carbon black<br>
becomes 5 |am or less is taken as a measure of the dispersibility. [0065]<br>
(2)	Evaluation of gloss and jet-black property<br>
The ink compositions 1 to 16 for offset printing are developed on coated'paper (O.K Topkote 73K) by a printing suitability tester PM-902PT (manufactured by SMT Co-., Ltd.) . A gloss value of this developed substance was measured with a gloss meter GM-26 (manufactured by Murakami Color Research Laboratory Co., Ltd.).  In addition, as for the jet-black property, L* was measured with a colorimetric spectrophotometer GretagMacbeth SpectroEye (manufactured by GretagMacbeth AG. ) . Smaller L* indicates that a blackish tone is stronger. [0066] Table 1<br><br>
*1 The measure of amount in Table refers to "parts by weight".<br>
*2 The oil-based varnish 1 and 3 for a printing ink are respectively substances formed by adding<br>
a soybean oil modified alkyd resin and a binder resin oihbased varnish separately in a flasher.<br>
The oil-based vamish 2 for a printing ink is a substance prepared before adding to a flasher.<br>

[0073]<br>
As shown in Tables 6 and 7, the total production times of the ink compositions 1 to 6, and 12 for offset printing of the present invention, obtained in Examples 1 to 7, can be shortened compared with those of the ink compositions 7 to 10, and 14 for offset printing obtained in Comparative Examples. In addition, the total production time of the ink composition 13 for offset printing of the present invention, obtained in Example 8 on an industrial scale, can be shortened compared with that of the ink composition 15 for offset printing obtained in Comparative Example on an industrial scale.  Further, it can be understood that the ink compositions 1 to 6, 12 and 13 for offset printing of the present invention are superior in the dispersibility, the gloss and the jet-black property to the ink compositions 7 to 10, 14 and 15 for offset printing obtained in Comparative Examples since the ink compositions for offset printing of the present invention have high gloss values and small values of L*. [0074]<br>
Further, it can also be understood that the -ink-compositions 1 to 6, 12 for offset printing of the present invention are superior in all of the dispersibility, the gloss and the jet-black property in comparison to the ink composition 11 for offset printing using the acid powder carbon black in Reference Example 1. Also, it can be understood that the ink composition 13 for offset printing of the present invention, which is obtained on an industrial scale, is superior in all of the dispersibility, the gloss and the jet-black property in comparison to the ink composition 16 for offset printing using the acid powder carbon black in Reference Example 2, which is obtained on an industrial scale.<br>
