				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a cool air discharge duct for a refrigerator<br>
and, in particular, to a cool air discharge duct which prevents the formation of ice<br>
around discharge vents by not allowing cool air to flow into a gap between a duct<br>
injection member and a thermal insulation material constructing the cool air<br>
discharge duct for the refrigerator and at the same time improves its aesthetic<br>
appearance by not allowing the thermal insulation material to be exposed through<br>
the cool air discharge duct.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
Figure 1 is a vertical cross-sectional view illustrating a refrigerator having a<br>
cool air discharge duct in accordance with the conventional art.<br>
As illustrated therein, a general refrigerator includes a body 1, a freezing<br>
chamber 2 formed at an upper portion in the body 1 for storing frozen food, a<br>
refrigerating chamber 3 formed at a lower portion in the body 1 for storing cold<br>
food, a freezing chamber door 4 and a refrigerating chamber door 5 each<br>
connected to be open and shut to the front surface of the freezing chamber 2 and<br>
refrigerating chamber 3 of the body 1, a plurality of racks 6 installed at a<br>
predetermined interval in the refrigerating chamber 3 for putting food or vessels<br>
thereon, a vegetable box 7 for storing vegetable or fruits at a lower portion of the<br>
refrigerating chamber 3, an evaporator 8 installed on a rear wall of the freezing<br>
1A<br>
chamber 2 for generating cool air to be supplied to the refrigerating chamber 3 and<br>
the freezing chamber 2, a blast fan 9 for forcedly circulating cool air generated<br>
from the evaporator 8, and a cool air discharge duct 10 installed on the rear of the<br>
refrigerating chamber 3 for guiding cool air generated from the evaporator 8 to the<br>
refrigerating chamber 3.<br>
Herein, the structure for the cool air discharge duct 10 in accordance with<br>
the conventional art for guiding cool air to the refrigerating chamber 3 will now be<br>
described in detail with reference to Figure 2.<br>
Figure 2 is an expansion view of Part I of Figure 1, which partially<br>
illustrates a cool air discharge duct in accordance with the conventional art.<br>
As illustrated therein, the cool air discharge duct 10 constructed of a duct<br>
injection member 11 and a thermal insulation material 12 is installed on the rear of<br>
the refrigerating chamber 3 so that it discharges cool air into the refrigerating<br>
chamber 3, said duct injection member 11 of the cool air discharge duct 10 having<br>
a plurality of cool air discharge vents 11a and said thermal insulation material 12 of<br>
the cool air discharge duct 10 also having a plurality of cool air discharge vents 12a<br>
communicating with the cool air discharge vents 1 la.<br>
At this time, a gap (G) of 1.5mm~2mm is formed between the thermal<br>
insulation material 12 and the duct injection member 11.<br>
The operation of the refrigerator thus constructed will be described below.<br>
Firstly, when power is applied to the refrigerator, cool air generated from<br>
the evaporator 8 disposed at the freezing chamber 2 is supplied to the freezing<br>
chamber 2 by rotation of the blast fan 9, some of which cool air flows again into<br>
the cool air discharge vents 11a and 12a of the cool air discharge duct 10 through<br>
a cool air flow channel (F), for thereby being supplied to the refrigerating chamber<br>
However, some of the cool air from the cool air discharge vents 11a and /<br>
12a of the conventional cool air discharge duct 10 described above flows not into<br>
the refrigerating chamber 3, but into the gap (G) between the thermal insulation <br>
material 12 and the duct injection member 11 as illustrated in Figure 2. The cool air<br>
flowed into the gap (G) decreases the surface temperature of the duct injection<br>
member 11, to thereby generate a difference in surface temperature between the<br>
duct injection member 11 around the cool air discharge vents 11a and the<br><br>
refrigerating chamber 3. <br>
Therefore, when there occurs a load (food) of high temperature and high<br>
humidity in the refrigerating chamber 3 due to the above difference in temperature,<br>
aqueous vapor in the refrigerating chamber 3 is supersaturated around the cool air<br>
discharge vents 11a, and then condensed on the surfaces of the duct injection<br>
member 11, thereby generating dew.<br>
In the case that the dew thus generated is continuously cooled, there<br>
occurs a problem that ice is formed and the ice grows to close (block) the cool air /<br>
discharge vents 11a of the duct injection member 11 at times, thereby causing a I<br>
problem in the performance of the refrigerator.<br>
Therefore, in order to eliminate the above phenomenon the composition <br>
of the shapes of the duct injection member 11 and the thermal insulation material<br>
12 has to be performed perfectly so that no gap is generated between the two<br>
components. However, in an actual manufacture of the duct injection member 11<br>
and the thermal insulation material 12, it is inevitable that a gap is generated<br>
because the shrinkage of the components manufactured by molding is different<br>
from each other.<br>
Accordingly, as the best alternative plan to prevent the above<br>
phenomenon of ice formation, a method of reducing ice formation by enlarging the<br>
cool air discharge vents 11a' of the duct injection member 11' and thus decreasing<br>
the area of the injection member 11' exposed to cool air is employed.<br>
However, when observing the conventional cool air discharge duct 10 as<br>
in Figure 3 from the front surface, the thermal insulation material 12 is exposed by<br>
1.5~2mm, though different according to products. Therefore, there occur problems<br>
that the aesthetic appearance of the refrigerating chamber 12 is degraded and it is<br>
impossible to perfectly shut off leakage of cool air.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a cool air<br>
discharge duct for a refrigerator which prevents the formation of ice around cool air<br>
discharge vents due to super-cooling of a duct injection member by not allowing<br>
cool air to flow into a gap between the duct injection member and thermal<br>
insulation material of the cool air discharge duct installed on a rear wall of the<br>
refrigerator.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a cool air discharge<br>
duct for a refrigerator which improves the aesthetic appearance of the refrigerator <br>

extended toward the discharge vents of the thermal insulation material is formed<br>
around the cool air discharge vents of the duct injection member, to thereby shut<br>

injection member.<br>

in that an end jaw is formed around the cool air discharge vents of the thermal <br>
insulation material and thus the rib is connected to the end jaw by a force fit.<br>
There is provided a cool air discharge duct for a refrigerator, characterized<br>
in that the outer diameter of the rib is formed larger than that of the cool air<br>
discharge vents of the thermal insulation material by a predetermined degree and<br>

in that the end portion of the rib is formed in a wedge shape.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 4 is a partial perspective view of a refrigerating chamber in which a<br>
cool air discharge duct in accordance with the present invention is installed, and<br>
Figure 5 is a cross-sectional view taken along line IV-IV of Figure. The same<br>
elements as those in the conventional art are indicated by the same reference<br>
numerals.<br>
As illustrated therein, a cool air discharge duct 20 constructed of a duct<br>
injection member 30 and a thermal insulation material 40 is installed on the rear of <br>
a refrigerating chamber 3 so that it discharges cool air into the refrigerating i<br>
chamber 3, said injection member 30 of the cool air discharge duct 20 having a<br>
plurality of cool air discharge vents 31 and said thermal insulation material of the<br>
cool air discharge duct 20 also having a plurality of cool air discharge vents 41<br>
communicating with the cool air discharge vents 31.<br>
At this time, an end jaw 42 is formed on the thermal insulation material 40 <br>
around the front portions of the cool air discharge vents 41, and a rib curved and <br>
extended at a right angle toward a cool air flow channel (F) is formed on the duct<br>
injection member 30 around the cool air discharge vents 31.<br>
The rib 32 is, as illustrated in Figure No.5, is connected with the end jaw 42 by a<br>
force fit to form an overlap interval (0) of a predetermined thickness, thereby<br>
shutting off cool air flowing into a gap (G) between the duct injection member 30<br>
and the thermal insulation material 40.<br>
At this time, if the overlap interval (O) is too large, it is difficult to assemble<br>
the cool air discharge duct 20. Thus, the size of the overlap interval is<br>
appropriately 0.5mm, though there may be some difference according to the<br>
density of the thermal insulation material 40.<br>
Herein, the reason why the overlap interval is formed on the connecting<br>
surfaces of the rib 32 and the duct 42 is that if the rib 32 and the end jaw 42 are<br>
not completely adhered to each other, cool air is saturated into the gap between<br>
the rib 32 and the end jaw 42, resulting in the formation of ice around the<br>
discharge vents. Although the size of the rib 32 is made identical with that of the<br>
end jaw 42 by means of precision design, there may be a fine gap between them<br>
because the shrinkage of the duct injection member 30 and the thermal insulation<br>
material 40 is different from each other in the manufacture of the duct injection<br>
member 30 and the thermal insulation material 40.<br>
Meanwhile, the end portion 33 of the rib 32 is formed in a wedge shape so<br>
that it may be easily inserted, into the end jaw 42 of thermal insulation material 40<br>
made of Styrofoam.<br>
Of course, the end portion 33 of the rib 32 may have a different shape<br>
other than the wedge shape. In this case, the end portion 33 is connected to the<br>
end jaw 42 of the thermal insulation material 40 by a force fit<br>
The procedure of the assembly of the cool air discharge duct thus<br>
constructed in accordance with the present invention will now be described with<br>
reference Figures 6A and 6B.<br>
Figure 6A is a partial cross-sectional view illustrating a state of a duct<br>
injection member and a thermal insulation material constructing a cool air<br>
discharge duct in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention prior<br>
to being connected with each other, and Figure 6B is a partial cross-sectional view<br>
illustrating a state of a duct injection member and a thermal insulation material<br>
constructing a cool air discharge duct in accordance with one embodiment of the t<br>
present invention after being connected with each other.<br>
First of all, the cool air discharge vents 31 and 41 of the duct injection <br>
member 30 and the thermal insulation material 40 are matched with each other in<br>
a state where the thermal insulation material 40 is positioned at the rear surface of<br>
the duct injection member 30, and thereafter the rib 32 of the duct injection<br>
member 30 is connected to the end jaw 42 of the thermal insulation material 40 by<br>
a force fit in the state as in Figure 6A.<br>
At this time, connecting the rib 32 by a force fit means completely adhering I<br>
the rib 32 to the end jaw 42 by the overlap interval (O) of the rib 32. Therefore, as illustrated in Figure 4, when cool air flowing through the cool<br>
air flow channel (F) in the cool air discharge duct 20 flows into the refrigerating <br>
chamber 3 via the cool air discharge vents 31 and 41 of the thermal insulation <br>
material 40 and duct injection member 30 in a state where the cool air discharge <br>
duct 20 is installed, a phenomenon that the cool air flows into the gap (G) between<br>
the duct injection member 30 and the thermal insulation material 40 can be<br>
prevented.<br>
Herein, the rib 32 can be easily separated from its mold during injection,<br>
and the end portion 33 thereof can be easily inserted into the end jaw 42 because<br>
it is formed in a wedge shape.<br>
In addition, the duct injection member 30 and the thermal insulation<br>
material 40 are connected by a force fit by the overlap interval (O) of the rib 32,<br>
and thus the connecting surfaces of the end jaw 42 and the rib 32 are completely <br>
adhered to each other.<br>
Meanwhile, Figure 7 is a partial vertical cross-sectional view illustrating<br>
another embodiment of a cool air discharge duct in accordance with the present<br>
invention, and Figures 8A and 8B are partial cross-sectional views illustrating a<br>
state of a duct injection member and a thermal insulation material constructing a<br>
cool air discharge duct in accordance with another embodiment of the present<br>
invention respective of prior to and after being connected with each other.<br>
A cool air discharge duct 20 constructed of a duct injection member 60<br>
and a thermal insulation material 50 is installed at the rear of a refrigerating<br>
chamber (not shown) so that it discharges cool air into the refrigerating chamber<br>
(not shown), said duct injection member 30 of the cool air discharge duct 20<br>
having a plurality of cool air discharge vents 31 and said thermal insulation<br>
material 40 of the cool air discharge duct 20 also having a plurality of cool air<br>
discharge vents 41 communicating with the cool air discharge vents 31 of the duct<br>
injection member 30.<br>
There is formed a rib 61 curved at a right angle toward a cool air flow<br>
channel (F) around the cool air discharge vents 31 of the duct injection member 60<br>
and connected to the inner surface of the cool air discharge vents 41 of the<br>
thermal insulation material 50 by a force fit for thereby preventing cool air from<br>
flowing into a gap between the duct injection member 60 and the thermal<br>
insulation material 50.<br>
At this time, the thickness of the rib 61 is the same as that of the duct<br>
injection member 60, and the end portion 62 of the rib 61 is formed to slope toward<br>
the inside of the discharge vents 31 at an angle of 450<br>
When connecting the duct injection member 30 and thermal insulation<br>
material 40 of the cool air discharge duct 20 which is installed to the rear wall of<br>
the refrigerating chamber(not shown) in the refrigerator in accordance with another<br>
embodiment of the present invention thus constructed, first of all, the cool air<br>
discharge vents 31 and 41 of the duct injection member 60 and thermal insulation<br>
material 50 are matched with each other in a state where the thermal insulation<br>
material 50 is positioned at the duct injection member 60, and thereafter one<br>
surface of the duct injection member 60 and an inner surface of the rib 61 are<br>
completely adhered and connected with each other by a force fit as in Figure 6A<br>
as the rib 61 of the duct injection member 60 is pushed toward the thermal<br>
insulation material 50 in the state as in Figure 8A.<br>
In addition, the curved length of the rib 61 is formed large to a<br>
predetermined extent thereby increase the channel resistance of a fine gap<br>
between the duct injection member 60 and the thermal insulation material 50 and<br>
thus decrease the inflow of cool air, and the end portion 62 of the rib 61 is formed<br>
to slope at an angle of 45° thereby to minimize the channel resistance of<br>
discharged cool air. By this, the inflow of cool air into the gap (G) between the duct<br>
insulation member 60 and the thermal insulation material 50 is reduced and the<br>
discharge of cool air into the refrigerating chamber is made easy, thereby making<br>
cool air coming out from the cool air flow channel (F) of the cool air discharge duct<br>
20 move diagonally toward the cool air discharge vents 61 of the duct injection<br>
member 60<br>
As described above, in the cool air discharge duct in accordance with the<br>
present invention, one advantage is that the formation of ice around cool air<br>
discharge vents due to super-cooling of a duct injection member is prevented by<br>
not allowing cool air to flow into a gap between the duct injection member and<br>
thermal insulation material of the cool air discharge duct installed on a rear wall of<br>
the refrigerator, and another advantage is that the aesthetic appearance of the<br>
refrigerator is improved by not allowing the thermal insulation material to be<br>
exposed around cool air discharge vents during an assembly of the cool air<br>
discharge duct.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be<br>
understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the<br>
details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should<br>

6. A cool air discharge duct, substantially as herein described, particularly<br>
with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
7. A refrigerator incorporating a cool air discharge duct, substantially as<br>
herein described, particularly with reference to and as illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
Dated this 13th day of April, 2000.<br>
The present invention relates to a cool air discharge duct for a refrigerator,<br>
wherein some of cool air from cool air discharge vents of the conventional cool air<br>
discharge duct flows not into a refrigerating chamber, but into a gap between a<br>
thermal insulation material and a duct injection member and then condensed on<br>
the surfaces of the duct injection member when there occurs a load (food) of high<br>
temperature and high humidity in the refrigerating chamber, thereby generating<br>
dew. In the case that the dew thus generated is continuously cooled, there occurs<br>
a problem that ice is formed and the ice grows to close the cool air discharge<br>
vents. Another problem is that the thermal insulation material of the cool air<br>
discharge duct is exposed through the cool air discharge vents to thereby degrade<br>
the aesthetic appearance of the refrigerating chamber. In the cool air discharge<br>
duct of the present invention including a cool air flow channel formed therein, a<br>
thermal insulation material having a plurality of cool air discharge vents, and a duct<br>
injection member having a plurality of cool air discharge vents corresponding to<br>
the cool air discharge vents of the thermal insulation material, there is formed a rib<br>
curved and extended inwardly around the cool air discharge vents formed at the<br>
duct injection member for thereby shutting off cool air flowing into the gap between<br>
the duct injection member and the thermal insulation material. The thus formed rib<br>
is connected to the cool air discharge vents by a force fit, so that cool air does not<br>
flow into the gap between the duct injection member and the thermal insulation<br>
material and the thermal insulation material is not exposed to the outside after<br>
assembling the cool air discharge duct, to thereby improve the aesthetic<br>
appearance of the refrigerating chamber.</td>
