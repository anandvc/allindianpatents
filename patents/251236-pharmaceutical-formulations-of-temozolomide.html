				<td>This application claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application. Serial No. 60/359,198 filed February 22. 2002.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention pertains to pharmaceutical formulations comprising antineoplastic agents, such as Temozolomide, and dissolution enhancing agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Antineoplastic agents are useful in cancer therapies against a wide array of cancer and other diseases. Temozolomide is one such antineoplastic agent. U.S. Patent 6.096,759 lists a variety of antineoplastic agents including Temozolomide, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Temozolomide is known for its anti-tumor effects. For example, one study showed that clinical responses were achieved in 17% of patients having advanced melanoma (Newiands ES, et ai Br J Cancer 65 (2) 287-2981 (1992)). In another study, a clinical response wan achieved in 21 % of patients with advanced melanoma (Journal of Clinical Oncology, 13(4) 910-913 (1995)). Treatment of gliomas in adults with Temozolomide is also Known {Eur. J. Cancer 29A 940 (1993)). Treatment of the following cancers in adults with Temozolomide has also been disclosed: metastatic melanoma; malignant melanoma, high grade glioma, glioblastoma and other brain cancers; lung cancer; breast cancer; testicular cancer, colon and rectal cancers; carcinomas; sarcomas; lymphomas; teukemias; anaplastic astrocytoma; and mycosis fungoides.<br>
Temozolomide is a water-insoluble compound. Temozolomide has been administered in patients as micronized suspensions, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,251,886. However, suspension formulations are not desirable because they may lead to clogged veins.<br>
Storage of pharmaceutical and biological agents, especially antineoplastic agents, as a frozen solution can cause the active ingredient therein to rapidly deteriorate.<br>
Lyophilization, also known as freeze-drying, is a process whereby water is sublimed from a composition after it is frozen. In this process, pharmaceutical and biological agents that are relatively unstable in an aqueous solution over a period of time can be placed into dosage containers in an easily processed liquid state, dried without the use of damaging heat and stored in a dried state for extended periods. Most pharmaceutical and biological agents, including antineoplastic agents, require additional ingredients to protect the active ingredient during lyophilization. In addition, it can be difficult to reconstitute a lyophilized antineoplastic agent into an aqueous solution.<br>
Accordingly there is an increased need for formulations containing antineoplastic agents, such as Temozolomide, which are water soluble, stable and/or suitable for lyophilization, long term storage and ^constitution of the lyophilized formulation into an aqueous solution.<br>
Furthermore, there is an increased need for administering to a patient an antineoplastic agent, sucli as Temozolomide, as a water soluble and stable formulation.<br>

The lyophilized formulations of the pharmaceutical formulations can be diluted or reconstituted prior to administration with a suitable aqueous diluent(s) to obtain a finished concentration. For example, a concentration of from about 0.5 mg/ml to about 5 mg/ml, preferably from about 1 mg/ml to about 3 mg/ml, and more preferably from about 2 mg/ml to about 3 mg/ml is suitable for transfer to an infusion bag for use by a patient in need of an antineoplastic agent such as Temozolomide.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to a process for treating or preventing disease in a patient comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the <br>
pharmaceutical formulation of the invention to a patient in need thereof. The pharmaceutical formulation in this aspect of the invention can be a formulation which are the Iyophilized powders reconstituted with water or other aqueous diluents, or the formulations which are not prepared by reconstituting the Iyophilized powders. Non- limiting examples of diseases which can be treated or prevented include carcinoma, sarcoma, melanoma, glioma, glioblastoma, brain cancer, lung cancer, thyroid follicular cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, anaplastic astrocytoma, bladder cancer, myelodysplasia, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, colon and rectal cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, or mycosis fungoides.<br>
The dosage regimen utilizing the pharmaceutical formulations of the invention is selected based upon consideration of a variety of factors, including species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the specific disease to be treated, the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular active ingredient or salt thereof employed. An ordinarily skilled physician can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of antineoplastic agent required to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the disease condition. For example, the adult dosage of temozolomide for an adult is generally about 150mg/m2 of body surface area.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulation of the invention can be used for treating or preventing one or more diseases such as carcinoma, sarcoma, melanoma, glioma, glioblastoma, brain cancer, lung cancer, thyroid follicular cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, myelodysplasia, anaplastic astrocytoma, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, anaplastic astrocytoma, colon and rectal cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, and mycosis fungoides.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulation, its Iyophilized powder, and the pharmaceutical formulation formed by reconstituting the Iyophilized powder with at least one aqueous diluent can provide enhanced chemical stability. Enhanced chemical stability of the pharmaceutical formulation means the pharmaceutical formulation is stable in solution for at least 60 hours at room temperature (about 250C) and ambient light conditions. Enhanced chemical stability of the Iyophilized powder means the Iyophilized powder is suitable for storage from about 4°C to about 40°C preferably for about 12 months or more. Enhanced chemical stability of the pharmaceutical formulation formed by reconstituting the Iyophilized powder with water or other aqueous diluent means the<br>
reconstituted lyophilized powder is stable in solution for about 48 hours or more at room temperature and ambient light conditions. One advantage of the stability of the lyophilized powder is extended pharmaceutical product shelf life. Extended pharmaceutical shelf life offers significant economic advantages.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the present invention discloses stable pharmaceutical formulations comprising temozolomide and at least one dissolution enhancing agent sufficient to substantially dissolve temozolomide in at least one aqueous diluent. The dissolution enhancing agent can be urea, L-histidine, L- threonine, L-asparagine, L-serine, L-glutamine, or mixtures thereof. The pharmaceutical formulation comprising Temozolomide may have at least one other ingredient such as, for example, a bulking agent, buffer or pH adjuster, which are described above both as to their nature and amounts. Such pharmaceutical formulations can have the stability as discussed above. The invention additionally describes a process of preparing such stable pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
In a further embodiment, the above-described formulations comprising Temozolomide can be lyophilized into a lyophilized powder and stored in a suitable container or such article of manufacture in a condition suitable to be reconstituted later at an appropriate time in water or other aqueous diluent(s) for administration to a patient in need of treatment as described above. The lyophilized powders can have long term storage stability as discussed above.<br>
The stable pharmaceutical formulations and lyophilized forms comprising Temozolomide are described in more detail in the EXAMPLES section below.<br>
The invention is therefore advantageous in that it allows the formation of a stable aqueous solution containing an antineoplastic agent. Other advantages include the ability of the pharmaceutical formulation to be lyophilized and stored as a lyophilized powder suitable to be reconstituted as an aqueous solution, which solution is suitable to be administered to a patient in need thereof.<br>

1.	4.00 g of L-Threonine, 3.00 g of polysorbate 80, 15 g of mannitol, 5.88 g of sodium citrate dihydrate, and 1.48 g of Hydrochloric acid, in that order, were charged and dissolved in water with agitation. The amount of water was about 80% of the total volume (batch volume).<br>
2.	*2.58 g of Temozolomide was charged and dissolved with agitation into the solution from Step 1. Complete dissolution of Temozolomide may require up to 2 hours of mixing.	%<br>
3.	**Water is added to bring the batch to the final volume with a solution density of 1.008 ± 0.002 g/mL at 25°C. The solution was mixed for at least 15 minutes.<br>
4.	The solution was aseptically filtered through a sterilized 0.22 pm filter (Millipore, GVWP, Durapore), which was washed and tested for integrity, into a sterilized, stainless steel pressure vessel or equivalent. For a batch of 10 liters or less, a 293- mm membrane filter or equivalent was used. For batch sizes greater than 10 Liters, a 0.22 jim cartridge filter (MCGL40S Minidisk, Durapore GVWP) was used.<br>
The compounded batch can be stored at room temperature (19 - 25°C) for up to 8 hours in a sealed, sterilized, stainless steel pressure vessel, and then refiltered following storage.<br>
5.	The solution from step 4 was aseptically filled into 20-mL Type 1 flint glass vials in aliquots of 10.7 ± 0.2 mL. The vials were washed and sterilized prior to being filled.<br>
6. 20-mm Daikyo D-713 lyoshape rubber stoppers, which were washed, siliconized and sterilized, were asepticaily inserted into the glass vials from step 5 in the lyophilization position.<br>
EXAMPLE 3: 1L of Batch B was prepared by the procedure described above except that 2 g of L-Histidine was used instead of 4.00 g of L-Threonine, and 2.08 g of hydrochloric acid was used instead of 1.48 g of hydrochloric add in step 1.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4: 1L of Batch C was prepared by the procedure described above except that 4 g of L-Asparagine was used instead of 4.00 g of L-Threonine in step 1.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 5:	1L of Batch D was prepared by the procedure described<br>
above except that 5 g of Urea was used instead of 4.00 g of L-Threonine and 3.00 g of Polysorbate 80 in step 1.   <br>
1 v<br><br><br>
After lyophilization of batches A-D, the resulting powder was stored and, over a period of one week, four weeks, eight weeks and twelve weeks, the samples were reconstituted with water for analysis. The results are present in Table 1 below.<br>
The results show that the temozolamide in batches A-D was stable over one, four, eight and twelve week periods.<br>

6.	The condenser temperature was lowered to about -45°C or below, and then the chamber was evacuated to about 100 nm Hg.<br>
7.	Once the chamber reached 100 jim Hg pressure, full vacuum (50-70 jiM Hg) was applied and held for about 2 hours with the shelf temperature at about -50 ± 5°C.<br>
8.	The pressure was changed to about 150 \xm Hg and held for 30 minutes.<br>
9.	The shelves were heated to about 5°C in 1 hour and 45 minutes. The shelf temperature was then maintained at about 5°C for about 6 hours at approximately 150 jim Hg pressure.<br>
10.	The shelves were cooled to -2°C in about 3 hours and the shelf temperature was maintained at about -2 ± 2°C for 32 hours at approximately 150 pm Hg pressure..<br>
11.	The shelves were heated to about 456C in 8 hours and maintained at a temperature of about 45 ± 2°C for about 5 hours at about 150 |im Hg pressure. The product temperature was then kept above -10°C.<br>
12.	The shelves were cooled to about 4°C at a chamber pressure of about 150 nm and maintained at about 4°C for a minimum of about 1 hour.<br>
13.	The chamber was vented with sterile filtered nitrogen to about 933 mBar.<br>
14.	The vials were stoppered inside the lyophilizer.<br>
15.	The chamber was vented with sterile filtered nitrogen to atmospheric pressure. <br>
16.	The vials were removed from the lyophilizer and crimped with 20-mm aluminum seals.<br>
17.	The vials were stored at about 2° to about 8°C until inspection was completed.<br>
