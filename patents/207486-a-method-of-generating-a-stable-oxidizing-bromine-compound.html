				<td>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION    <br>
 The present invention relates to/formulations used in biofouling control in industrial water systems.  More specifically, the present invention relates to methods of preparing stable oxidizing bromine formulations and their use in biofouling control in industrial water systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
While elemental liquid bromine is an effective biocide, its low solubility (
A mixture of an aqueous bromine solution and a bromine stabilizer has been used to generate stable oxidizing bromine compounds for use as a biocide.  An unstabilized aqueous bromine solution is very acidic, unstable and emits very pungent bromine fumes.  The concentration of stabilized hypobromite solution that can be made from liquid bromine, however, has been limited due to the low solubility of bromine in water.<br>
It has also been suggested that, in addition to a bromine stabilizer, an oxidizer, such as hypochlorite, be added to activate the bromide to hypobromite.  After the completion of the conversion of bromide to hypobromite, the hypobromite is stabilized by the addition of a halogen stabilizer, such as sulfamate.  While this is an improved process with a higher level of oxidizing halogen content (around 14% as Br2) , this process still requires the separate step of synthesizing sodium hypobromite<br><br>
(NaOBr) as a bromine source.  NaOBr is known to be very unstable and will rapidly disproportionate to bromide and bromate, both of which have little or no antimicrobial activity.  In addition, because sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is used as an activation agent, the concentration of stabilized product is limited by the available concentration of NaOCl.<br>
Also known are methods of generating bromine for on-site use.  Such processes involve electrolytically converting bromate into active bromine compounds such as bromine, hypobromous acid, hypobromite ion and hydrogen tribromide under acidic conditions.  However, because the above process generates bromine for on-site use, methods or measures for optimizing bromine stabilization are not addressed.<br>
Therefore, methods of generating higher<br>
concentrations of stable oxidizing bromine formulations in a safer manner are heeded.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF' THE INVENTION The present invention provides a plurality of formulations and methods for generating a wide concentration of stable oxidizing bromine compounds for biofouling control in cooling water and other industrial systems.<br>
In an embodiment, the strategy employed by the present invention utilizes a mixture of alkali or alkaline earth metal bromide and alkali or alkaline earth metal bromate in water as the bromine source.  Bromate also serves as an oxidizing agent.  The molar ratio of bromide to bromate is optimally 2:1.  The solution is then cooled to a temperature preferably of less than 25°C and even more preferably of less than 10°C.  An acidic stabilizer or acidic stabilizing solution, such as sulfamic acid, is then added to the solution to lower the pH of the solution to less than 2.  Additional stabilizer is then added to achieve equal molar amounts relative to bromine for optimal stabilization.  Without being limited by theory, the following reactions are believed to occur:<br>
HO-SO2-NH2	&gt; H+ + O-SO2-NH2	(1)<br>
2Br + BrO3 + 3H+	&gt; 3HBrO	(2)<br>
HBrO + O-SO2-NH2	&gt; O-SO2-NH-Br, O-SO2-NBr2,<br>
and other stable oxidizing bromine compounds (3)<br>
Since bromide, bromate and sulfamate co-exist in the<br>
resulting solution, reaction (1) to reaction (3) occurs<br>
sequentially with respect to each other. Without being<br>
limited by theory, the existence of an oxidizing bromine<br>
stabilizer and correct bromide to bromate ratio are<br>
believed to prevent the formation of bromine according to<br>
the following reaction:<br>
5NaBr + NaBrC3 + 6H+	&gt; 3Br2 + 6Na+ + 3 H2O     (4)<br>
-8-<br><br>
If reaction (4) were to happen instead of reaction<br>
(2), half of the raw bromine source would convert back to<br>
non-biocidal and non-oxidizing bromide, according to<br>
reaction (5):<br>
Br2+ H2O	&gt; HBrO + HBr ,	(5)<br>
However, an analysis of products prepared in accordance with the present invention confirms that the reaction yield is higher than 50%.  In fact, more than 80% of the bromine source was converted to oxidized bromine forms.  Accordingly, the reaction yield of at<br>
least 80% was achieved.<br><br>
The reaction time for reactions 1-3 at a pH of less than 2 ranges from 5 to 10 minutes with good agitation. If the product is not going to be used immediately, a strong base, such as NaOH, is added to raise the product pH to a level greater than 13 making the product thermally stable.  During the pH adjustment, temperature control is important because the temperature increase by the heat generated from the acid-base reaction can cause the product to decompose.  Accordingly, cooling may be necessary.<br>
The product made with the above process has good thermostability and a high total available halogen concentration, as high as 34% as Br2.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are intended to be<br>
illustrative of the present invention and to teach one of ordinary skill how to make and use the invention.  These examples are not intended to limit the invention or its protection in any way.<br>
Example I<br>
By way of an example, synthesis of a stable oxidizing bromine product in accordance with the above described method is carried out by mixing 21.2 grams of NaBrO3, 32.8 grams of NaBr and 100 grams of water, cooling the solution to 3°C, adding 43 grams of sulfamic acid to<br>
-9-<br><br>
the solution and agitating the solution for 10 minutes.<br>
Then, 48 grams of 50% aqueous NaOH is added slowly, to the solution while controlling the solution temperature to a range between 4°C and l-4°C.  The resulting product was a golden yellow solution with a pH of 13.77 and available halogen concentration of 25.1% as Br2.  In this example, the theoretical Br2% is 29.9 if all of the bromine sources (bromide and bromate) were to convert to stable oxidizing bromines.  Therefore, the yield is about 84%.<br>
Example II<br>
By way of another example, synthesis of stable oxidizing bromine formulations in accordance with the above-described method is carried out by mixing 21.2 grams of NaBrO3, 32.8 grams of NaBr and 100 grams of water in a reactor, cooling the solution to 3°C, adding 44 grams of sulfamic acid to the solution and agitating the solution for 10 minutes, slowly adding 43 grams of 50% aqueous NaOH while controlling the reactor temperature between 3°C and l4°C.  The resulting product was a golden yellow solution with a pH of 14.11 and available halogen concentration of 27.7% as Br2.  In this example, the theoretical Br2% is 31.2 if all of the bromine sources (bromide and bromate) are converted into stable oxidizing bromines.  Therefore, the product yield is about 88.8%.<br>
In another embodiment, liquid bromine is used as both oxidizer and bromine source.  Sulfamate or other nitrogen base compounds are used as stabilizers.  In addition, an adequate amount of alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide is required to maintain product pH. Formulation temperature is also extremely critical in insuring the formation of stable oxidizing bromines. Without adequate pH and temperature control, the heat generated by the exothermic reaction will cause rapid decomposition of the oxidizing species.<br>
The process of making high concentration stable   oxidizing bromine formulations consists of two steps.  In<br>
-10-<br><br>
the first step, a caustic stabilizing solution is prepared by mixing sulfamic acid, water and alkali or alkaline metal hydroxides (preferably NaOH, Mg(OH)2 or other hydroxides).  The pH of the alkali or alkaline earth metal sulfamate solution is higher than 14.  Excess hydroxides are purposely added to neutralize the acids generated by the subsequent bromination step and to maintain a high pH {preferably greater than 13) in the finished product.  The preferred molar ratio of sulfamate to liquid bromine is 1:1.  The preferred molar ratio of hydroxide to liquid bromine is 2.2:1.  The stabilizer solution can also be obtained by dissolving alkali or alkaline metal sulfamate in water and adding an appropriate amount of hydroxide.<br>
The process is normally carried out in a jacketed glass reactor equipped with a proper mixing device.  A cooling system for the reactor should be set up so that the reactor temperature can be controlled at an optimal range.  An excessively high reaction temperature during the bromination step will accelerate sulfamate hydrolysis and cause decomposition of the desired product.<br>
The second step of the process is to slowly add liquid bromine into the stabilizer solution under good agitation.  Bromine is preferably added directly into the stabilizer solution through a Teflon tube to prevent elemental bromine exposure to air.  The addition rate is controlled so that the reaction temperature is preferably below 25°C.  The higher the reaction temperature, the lower the product yield.  If the reaction temperature gets over 35°C, sulfamate will start hydrolyzing into sulfate and ammonium.  The resulting ammonium will react with and consume hypobromite and produce nitrogen gas which can be observed as vigorous foaming.  With proper addition rates of liquid bromine, the liquid bromine will react instantaneously and will be stabilized.  The process does not produce detectable bromine fumes.<br><br>
The  product  made  with  the   above-described  process was   found   to include  no  detectable   bromate   (less   than  50 ppm with  ion  chromatography  analysis) ;   no  detectable product   concentration  change  was   observed  during  a   2 month  storage  period  at   room  temperature.      For  a   16.2% (as  Br2)   product,   the  product   has   a  half   life   of   74.5  days at   57°C.<br>
Example   III<br>
By way of an example, synthesis of a stable oxidizing bromine product using the above-described method is achieved by mixing 52.16 grams of sulfamic acid, 42.0 grams of water and 128.0 grams of 50% aqueous NaOH in a 500 ml three-neck glass reactor.  The mixture is cooled to a temperature of about 3°C under constant agitation and refrigerated in a water bath.  82.5 grams of liquid bromine (99.8% Br2) is slowly added to the solution and the reaction temperature is controlled and maintained below 10°C.  The resulting solution has a pH of 12.5.  The solution pH was increased to a level greater than 13 by adding 3.0 grams of 50% NaOH.  The bromine content in the resulting solution was 26.2% as Br2 while a theoretical content if 100% conversion is achieved is 27.0% as Br2 .<br>
After overnight storage at room temperature i21°C), the formation of large amounts of crystals was observed in the solution.  Using a 0.45   m filter to separate the crystal from the liquid, followed by dehydration of the crystals under vacuum overnight, 46.8% as Br2 was detected in the solid product while 18.7% of bromine content as Br2 remained in the liquid.  The solid product was found to be extremely water soluble.  Accordingly, the present invention provides a solid stable oxidizing bromine product which is water soluble.<br>
The solid product obtained in the above example has a very high concentration of stable oxidizing bromine<br>
-12-<br><br>
compounds.  The remaining content is believed to be water, excess NaOH and NaBr.<br>
Other hybrid methods can be used to generate stable<br>
oxidizing bromine compounds.  One such method consists of<br>
using bromate salt as an oxidizer and bromine source,<br>
liquid_bromine as an oxidizer, bromine source and acidic<br>
compound and sulfamate or another suitable halogen<br>
stabilizer as the bromine stabilizer.  The reaction<br>
mechanism would be as follows:<br>
Br2 + H2O ---&gt; 2H+ + Br + OBr	(6)<br>
BrO3  + 2Br  + H+ 	&gt; 3OBr	(7)<br>
OBr + Stabilizer 	&gt; Stable oxidizing bromines (8)<br>
The process can be carried out by dissolving bromate salt and water, adding sulfamate or other stabilizer to the solution, slowly adding liquid bromine, adjusting the pH to a level greater than 13 by adding NaOH,- if the resulting product is to be stored for a long period of time.  The process should be conducted at a temperature<br>
less than 25°C, especially during the addition of liquid<br>
bromine.<br>
In an embodiment, the stable oxidizing bromine compound of the present invention can be used to provide improved bi6fouling control in industrial water systems, pulp and paper processing systems, food and beverage processing systems and recreational water systems.  The stable oxidizing bromine compound of the present invention can also be used as a bleaching agent and to disinfect a hard surface.  By way of example only, the present invention may be added to an aqueous media used to transport food through various processing systems and also to disinfect process equipment and waste water streams.<br>
It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.  Such changes and modifications can be made without<br>
- 13-<br><br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present<br>
invention and without diminishing its attendant<br>
advantages.  It is therefore intended that such changes<br>

preparing a caustic solution comprising a halogen stabilizer, water and an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, the halogen stabilizer being selected from the group consisting of saccharin, benzenesulfonamide, urea, thiourea, creatinine, cyanuric acids, alkyl hydantoins, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, organic sulfonamides, biuret, sulfarnic acid, organic sulfamates and melamine,<br>
adding bromine chloride to the solution in a molar amount approximately equal to a molar amount of halogen stabilizer and approximately one-half of a molar amount of alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide and without exposing the bromine chloride to air,<br>
mixing the solution,<br>
16<br><br>
cooling the solution to a temperature of less than 25° C, and<br>
17<br>
adding an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide to the solution to increase the pH of the solution above 13.<br><br>
Stable oxidizing bromine compounds are prepared by preparing a caustic solution comprising a halogen stabilizer, water and an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, the halogen stabilizer being selected from the group consisting of R-NH.sub 2, R--NH--R.sup.l, R--SO.sub.2 -NH.sub.2, R-SO.sub.2 -NHR.sup.l, R--CO--NH.sub.2, R--CO--NH-R.sup.l and R--CO--NH-CO- R.sup.l wherein R is a hydroxy group, an alkyl group or an aromatic group and R.sup.1 is an alkyl group or an aromatic group, adding bromine chloride to the solution while mixing the solution, and cooling the solution.</td>
