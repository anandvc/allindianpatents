The existing help line facilities are such that at the times when urgent action is needed, then calling help lines or Police is not feasible as the urgency of the situation might be a constraint in seeking help from the existing means. It would also be a futile attempt to locate some weapon or shout for help as the severity of the incident could increase within seconds. As a consequence of the incident it is difficult to locate any evidence of the happening so that it comes out as timely task to apprehend the offender.<br>
Further, existing electronic systems do not provide multiple safety features that can be configured by the user before any eventuality.<br>
Referring to the limitations and problems of the existing system of the prior art an electronic system is desirable that can provide instant defensive measures and transmit information to a safe place for tracking evidence of the incident.<br>
Object and Summary of the Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to obviate the shortcomings of the prior art and provide an electronic system that provides speed efficient execution of defense mechanisms to ward off the offender.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to disable the normal operation of the electronic system and enable the safety devices to function as configured.<br>
It is further an object of the invention to provide a safety device in the form of an audio device to blow a high intensity alarm to seek immediate help.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention is to provide a safety device in the form of fluid spraying device that sprays a fluid / powder to distract the offender.<br>
It is another object of the invention is to provide a safety device in the form of ambient noise detection that detects the ambient noise at the place of incident to track the evidences of-the incident and to provide storage means for storing the information received from safety devices.<br>
To achieve said objectives the present invention provides an electronic system (E) coupled to at least one safety device (7,8,9,10,11), said electronic system comprising a switch (1) for initiating software safety module (2,3), characterized in that;<br><br>
the output of said software safety module is connected to the input of an actuator ^a) for producing at least two control signals,<br>
a first logic gate j3tf)is coupled at its first input to the first output of said actuator (3a)"and is connected to a higher voltage j2e)"supply at its second input for enabling a preprogrammed defense mechanism (corresponding to the said software safety module, and<br>
0d)is<br><br>
a second logic gate $u) is connected at its first input to the second output of said actuator (3^f and is connected to the output of the said preprogrammed defense mechanism (tf for disabling the principle function of said electronic system (E) and enabling said safety devices.<br>
Brief Description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an electronic system for disabling the principle function of said electronic system and enabling the safety devices.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Detailed Description of the drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows the main features of the electronic system of the present invention. The user manages to press the multiple switch 1 at the time of the incident. The switch passes signals to the software means 2 that invokes the safety module 3 of the software means 2, hereinafter collectively referred to as software safety module.<br>
The safety module is connected to the input of an actuator 3a that generates a logic high signal and a logic low signal. The logic high signal is coupled to first logic gate 3b and logic low signal to second logic gate 3d at their first inputs. The logic gates are preferably AND gates.<br>
The second input of the first logic gate 3b is connected to a higher voltage supply 3c that provides a logic high signal to the logic gate input. The logic gate 3b generates a logic high signal at its output.<br>
The output of the first logic gate 3b is connected to a preprogrammed defense mechanism 4 that is enabled by the output of the logic gate and is programmed to operate safety devices either sequentially or simultaneously or two at a time. The preprogrammed defense mechanism 4 can be used at the time of settings of the electronic system or at any leisure time. The safety<br>
functions are enabled as per the sequence of the safety devices programmed by the user in the preprogrammed defense mechanism 4.<br>
The second input of the second logic gate 3d is connected to the output of the preprogrammed defense mechanism 4 for disabling the principle function of the said electronic system (E) by providing a logic low signal to the electronic system.<br>
The preprogrammed defense mechanism 4 is a plurality of switches on the external periphery of the device. .<br>
The multiple safety devices 7, 8, 9, 10 and storage means 11 start their operation sequentially or simultaneously as programmed with the preprogrammed defense mechanism 4. The first safety device is a Digital Camera 7 that captures the picture of the incident and then transfers the picture instantly to the server stationed at remote place wherein said remote place is an anti-crime department such as a police station.<br>
The second safety device is an Audio Device 8 that blows on a high intensity alarm to distract the offender and effortless apprehension. The third safety device is a Fluid Spray device 9 that sprays an fluid or powder towards the offender to distract the offender. The fourth safety device is an Ambient Noise detection device 10 that detects the noise of the happenings of the surroundings of the place of incidence so that an evidence could be tracked even if the offender manages to escape. The fifth device is a storage means 11 connected to the safety devices for storing information received from safety devices. The storage means 11 is built in the electronic system the said storage means being covered in a protective enclosure, so as to track the evidence of the incident if the electronic system is destroyed.<br>
A server 12 is networked to the electronic system and is stationed at a remote place as mentioned above, to store information received from the safety devices and to generate signals calling for help such as an SOS message.<br>
The electronic system with multiple safety devices can be a normal computer system that can be equipped with multiple safety functions to seek immediate defensive measures at places as banks or other commercial sectors. The electronic system can be a handheld PDA or cellular phone that provides safety features for professionals apart from its normal features.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an embodiment of the present invention, wherein the electronic system is a compact electronic device, which has three specific functions that make it extremely beneficial as compared to the conventional electronic systems.The objective of the compact electronic device is to provide safety along with existing electronics and communication facilities. All the features are incorporated in such a manner that the end use becomes very easy, yet safe and foolproof.<br>
As soon as the user presses the multi function switch, the defense mechanism is enabled and the principal functionality of the compact electronic device is momentarily disabled to provide a standalone defense mechanism.<br>
Further, the software means within the compact electronic device determines whether the defense mechanism has commenced or not. If the defense mechanism is operational then the software means disables the defense mechanism after execution of the defense operations and thereafter enables the principal functionality of the compact electronic device.<br>
The first function of the defense mechanism is to capture and transfer the photograph of the offender and the surroundings, the photograph being duly preserved at a remote server.<br>
The second function of the defense mechanism is to switch on the alarm system that functions after the photograph acquisition. Instant power supply is provided to the speaker, said power supply being generated from battery<br>
of compact electronic device that further generates an alarm. The switching off procedure of the alarm is either by removal of battery or completion of alarm duration as per the instructions in the software.<br>
The third function of the defense mechanism is to invoke a spray ejection for distracting the offender for offering a chance of escape to the victim.<br>
Another feature in the compact electronic device the recordal and transmission of the ambient noise to a remote storage for taking preventive action to avoid any further mishaps.<br>
Finally, the defense mechanism provides the recordal of the captured pictured and the ambient noise within a centralized storage means that is built in the compact electronic device; the storage being enclosed in an unbreakable covering. This measure being taken to preserve the recordal of the incident even if the offender attempts to destroy the external periphery of the compact electronic device.<br><br><br><br>
