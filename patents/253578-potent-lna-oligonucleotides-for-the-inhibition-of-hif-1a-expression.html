POTENT LNA OLIGONUCLEOTIDES FOR THE INHIBITION OF HIF-1A EXPRESSION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides compositions and methods for modulating the expression of<br>
HIF-1a. In particular, this invention relates to LNA oligonucleotides, which are specifically<br>
hybridisable with nucleic acids encoding HIF-la. The LNA oligonucleotides have been shown<br>
to modulate the expression of HIF-1a and pharmaceutical preparations thereof and their use<br>
as treatment of cancer diseases, inflammatory diseases and eye diseases are disclosed.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Solid tumors must establish a blood supply and have enhanced glucose metabolism to grow<br>
beyond a few millimeters. How they sense hypoxia, and respond by activating hypoxia-<br>
inducible genes and secreting angiogenrc factors to establish a blood system is central to<br>
cancer biology. Many tumors contain hypoxic microenvlronments, which have been<br>
associated with malignant progression, metastasis and resistance to radiotherapy and<br>
chemotherapy.<br>
The discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) gave some insight into the regulation of<br>
hypoxia-mducible genes (US 5,882,914 and WO 96/39426; WO 99/48916). HIF-1 is<br>
composed of two subunits HIF-la (HIF-lalpha; referred to herein as "HIF-la") and HIF-ip<br>
and it binds - 1 hypoxia-response elements (HREs) in enhancers of genes encoding<br>
angiogenic factors such as VEGF and glycolysis-related proteins such as glycolytic enzymes<br>
and glucose transporter 1 and 3 (GLU-1 and 3).<br>
It has been demonstrated that engineered down-regulation of HIF-la by intratumoral gene<br>
transfer of an antisense HIF-la plasmid leads to the down-regulation of VEGA and decreased<br>
tumor microvessel density (WO 00/76497, Sun X et al. Gene Therapy (2001) 8, 638-645).<br>
The plasmid contained a 320-bp cDNA fragment encoding 5'-end of HIF-la (nudeotldes 152-<br>
454; Genebank AF003698).<br>
WO 2003/085110 shows LNA antisense oligonucleotides which down-regulates human HIF-la<br>
expression. One compound Is named CUR813 (SEQ ID NO. 11).<br>
The present invention disclosed LNA oligonucleotides, which are more potent than CUR813<br>
(SEQ ID NO. 11). Also the specific LNA oligonucleotides, according to the Invention, induce<br><br>
WO 2006/050734	PCT/DK2005/000721<br>
2<br>
apoptosis and inhibit proliferation. Also, the LNA oligonucleotides which have a 100%<br>
sequence identity to the mouse HIF-la down-regulate the HIF-la expression in the liver,<br>
colon and kidney in mice.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides compositions and methoos for modulating the expression of<br>
HIF-la. In particular, this invention relates to LNA oligonucleotides over 2 specific motifs<br>
targeting HIF-la. These motifs are disclosed as SEQ ID NOS. 3.and 4. Specifically preferred<br>
LNA oligonucleotides are SEQ ID NO. 1 and SEQ ID NO. 2. The LNA oligonucleotides of the<br>
invention are potent inhibitors of HIF-la mRNA expression and protein levels.<br>
More particularly, the present invention provides an LNA oligonucleotide consisting, of a<br>
sequence selected from the group consisting of<br><br>
wherein capital letters designate a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleotide analogue, small letters<br>
designate a 2-deoxynucleotide, underline designates either a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleotide<br>
analogue or a 2-deoxynucleotide, subscript "s" designates a phosphorothioate link between<br>
neighbouring nucleotides/LNA nucleotide analogues, and subscript "x" designates either a<br>
phosphorothioate link or a phosphorodiester link between neighbouring nucleotldes/LNA<br>
nucleotide analogues, and where the nucleotide units in the bracket, (Ix), (T) or (Gx), (A),<br>
respectively, represent optional units, and<br>
wherein the sequence is optionally extended by up to five 2-deoxynucleotide units.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the LNA oligonucleotide of the invention are also<br>
provided. Further provided are methods of modulating the expression of HIF-la in cells or<br>
tissues comprising contacting said cells or tissues with one or more of the LNA<br>
oligonucleotides or compositions of the invention. Also disclosed are methods of treating an<br>
animal or a human, suspected of having or being prone to a disease or condition, associated<br>
with expression of HIF-la by administering a therapeutlcally or prophylactically effective<br>
amount of one or more of the LNA oligonucleotides or compositions of the invention. Further,<br><br>
WO 2006/050734	PCT/DK2005/000721<br>
3<br>
methods of using LNA oltgonucleatides for the Inhibition of expression of HIF-la and for   .<br>
treatment of diseases associated with HIF-la activity are provided.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention employs particular LNA oligonucleotides, namely LNA oligonucleotides<br>
comprising the sequence SEQ ID NO. 3 and SEQ ID NO. 4, for use in modulating the function<br>
of nucleic acid molecules encoding HIF-la. The modulation is ultimately a change in the<br>
amount of HIF-la produced. In one embodiment, this is accomplished by providing antisense<br>
LNA oligonucleotides, which specifically hybridise with nucleic acids encoding HIF-la. The<br><br>
WO 2006/050734	PCT/DK2005/000721<br>
8<br>
modulation is preferably an inhibition of the expression of BIF-1a, which leads to a decrease<br>
in the number of functional HIF-1a proteins produced.<br>
The LNA oligonucleotides<br>
More particular, the present invention provides an LNA oligonucleotide consisting of a<br>
sequence selected from the group consisting of<br><br>
wherein capital letters designate a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleotide analogue, small letters<br>
designate a 2-deoxynudeotide, underline designates either a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleotide<br>
analogue or a 2-deoxynucleotide, subscript "s" designates a phosphorothioate link between<br>
neighbouring nucteotides/LNA nucteotidc analogues, and subscript "x" designates either a<br>
phosphorothioate link or a phosphorodiester link between neighbouring nucleottdes/LNA<br>
nucleotide analogues, and where the nucleotide units in the bracket, (Ix), (T), or (£x),(A),<br>
respectively, represent optional units, and<br>
wherein the sequence is optionally extended by up to five 2-deoxynucleotide units.<br>
The terms "LNA oligonucleotide defined herein", "LNA oligonucleotide according to the<br>
invention", and the like, refer to the "LNA oligonucleotide" defined above as well as the<br>
embodiments, variants, salts, prodrugs, etc. provided in the following.<br>
The above-defined LNA oligonucleotides based on SEQ ID NO. 3 and SEQ ID NO. 4 have a<br>
length of 13-20 nucleotide units. The minimal sequence length of 13 is obtained if the<br>
nucleotide units in the bracket, (Tx), (T) or (Gx), (A), respectively, are absent, and the<br>
maximum sequence length of 20 is obtained if the nucleotide units in the bracket, (Tx), (T) or<br>
(Gx), (A), respectively, are present and if the sequence SEQ ID NO. 3 or SEQ ID NO. 4 is<br>
extended by five 2-deoxynucleotide units.<br>
In one embodiment, the nucleotide units In the bracket, (Tx), (T) or (Gx), (A), respectively,<br>
are absent, and in another currently more preferred embodiment, the nucleotide unit in the<br>
bracket, (Tx), (T) or (Gx), (A), respectively, are present. Also interesting are the<br><br>

embodiments, where the 5'-terminal optional unit, (Tx) or (Gx), respectively, is present and<br>
where the 3'-terminal optional unit, (T) or (A), respectively, is absent, and the embodiments<br>
where the 5'-terminal optional unit, (Tx) or (Gx), respectively, is absent and where the S'-<br>

The selection of a beta-D-oxy7LNA.nucleotide analogue or a 2-deoxynucleotfde for the<br>
underlined nucleotide units in the above SEQ ID NO. 3 and SEQ ID NO. 4 appears to be less<br>
critical. However, in one embodiment, both-of the underlined- nudeotide units designate a 2-<br>
deoxynucleotide. In another currently more preferred embodiment, one or both of the<br>
underlined nucteotide units designate a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleatide analogue.<br>
In one variant, the S'-terminal nucleotide unit tn the bracket, (Tx) or (Gx), respectively, is<br>
absent, and the 3'-terminal other underlined nucleotide unit, (I) or (A), respectively,<br>
designates a 2-deoxynucleotide, or more preferable, a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleotide analogue.<br>
In another variant, the 5'-terminal nucleotide unit in the bracket, (Tx) or (Gx), respectively,<br>
designate a 2-deoxynucleotide, or, more preferable, a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleotide analogue,<br>
and the 3'-terminal other underlined nucleotide unit, (T) or (A), respectively, is absent.<br>
In another variant, the nucleotide units in the bracket are present, and one or both of the<br>
underlined nucteotide units designate a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleotide analogue, i.e. (i) the S'-<br>
terminal underlined nucleotide designates a beta-D-oxy-LNA nudeotide analogue and the S'-<br>
terminal underlined nucleotide units designates a 2-deoxynucleotide, or (ii) the 3'-terminal<br>
underlined nucleotide designates a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleotide analogue and the 5'-termmal<br>
underlined nucleotide units designates a 2-deoxynucleotide, or (iii) the 3'-termlnal as well as<br>
the 5'-terminal underlined nucleotides designate a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleotide analogue.<br>
In a further variant, the nucleotide units in the bracket, (Tx) or (Gx), respectively, is present,<br>
and both of the underlined nucleotide units designate a 2-deoxynucleotide.<br>
Although the sequences referred to as SEQ ID NO. 3 and SEQ ID NO. 4 (and more particular<br>
the sequences referred to as SEQ ID NO. 1 and SEQ ID NO. 2 (see further below)) are<br>
believed to substantially represent the full functionality of the defined LNA oligonucleotides,<br>
extension of SEQ ID NO. 3 and SEQ ID NO. 4 with up to five 2-deoxynucleotide units, e.g. 1<br>
unit, 2 units, 3 units, 4 units, or even 5 units, is believed to be possible without detrimental<br>
effects on the beneficial properties of the base sequences, SEQ ID NO. 3 and SEQ ID NO. 4.<br>
This being said, the sequence may be extended at the 3'-terminal end, the 5'-terminal end or<br>
at the 3'-terminal end as well as at the 5'-terminal end, provided that the total number of 2-<br>
deoxynucleotide units does not exceed 5.<br><br>

Hence, in one embodiment (which may be combined with the foregoing)the LNA<br>
otigonucleotide consists of 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 nucleotide units selected from 2-<br>
deoxynudeotides and beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleotide analogues, in particular the LNA<br>
oligonucleotide consists of 16 nucleotide units selected from 2-deoxynucleotides and beta-D-  ■<br>
oxy-LNA nucleotide analogues. In other embodiments (which may be combined with the<br>
foregoing) the LNA oligonucleotide consists of 13,14, 15, or 16 nucleotide units selected<br>
from 2-deoxynudeotides and-beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleotide-analogues, in particular the LNA<br>
oligonucleotide consists of 14 or 15 nucleotide units selected from 2-deoxynucleotides and<br>
beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleotide analogues.    -<br>
At least for the sake of convenience in the preparation of the LNA oligonucleorides, it is often<br>
preferred that the sequence is extended by one 2-deoxynucleotide unit at the 3'-end, cf.,<br>
e.g., SEQ ID NO. 1 and SEQ ID NO. 2 below. Most preferable, SEQ ID NO. 3 is extended by<br>
an adenosine 2-deoxynucleot)de unit at the 3'-cnd, and SEQ ID NO. 4 is extended by a<br>
cytosine 2-deoxynuc!eotide at the 3'-end.<br>
As mentioned above, subscript "s" designates a phosphorothioate (-O-P(O,S)-O-) link   -<br>
between neighbouring nudeotides/LNA nucleotide analogues, and subscript "x" designates<br>
either a phosphorothioate (-O-P(O,S)-O-) link or a phosphorodiester (-O-P(O)2-O-) link<br>
between neighbouring nudeotides/LNA nucleotide analogues. It follows that any 2-<br>
deoxynudetides by which the sequence ts extended may be linked by either either a<br>
phosphorothioate (-O-P(O,S)-O-) link or a phosphorodiester (-O-P(O)2-O-) link.<br>
It is noted that subsequence CsasasgsastsCsCsT of SEQ ID NO. 3 and subsequence<br>
asCstsgsCsCststsCsT of SEQ ID NO. 4 are indicated as fully phosphorothiolated, cf. subscript "s".<br>
Although is it is not currently preferred, it is believed that one, and possibly also two, of the<br>
phosphorothioate links may be replaced by other links, in particular phosphorodiester links,<br>
without severely compromising the stability of the LNA oligonucleotide. Thus, such variants<br>
where one or two of the phosphorothioate links are replaced by, e.g., phosphorodiester links<br>
also fall within the intended scope of the present Invention.<br>
In one currently preferred embodiment, however, all nucteotide units in the sequence are<br>
linked by a phosphorothioate group.<br>

In the present context, the term "nucleoside" Is used In its normal meaning, i.e. it contains a<br>
2-deoxyribose or ribose unit which is bonded through its number one carbon atom to one of<br>
the nitrogenous bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), thymine (T), uracil (U) or guanine (G).<br>
In a similar way, the term "nudeotide" means a 2-deoxyribose or ribose unit which is bonded<br>
through its number one carbon atom to one of the nitrogenous bases adenine (A), cytosine<br>
(C), thymine (T), uracil (U) or guanine (G), and which is bonded through its number five<br>
carbon atom to an internucleoside phosphate group, or to a terminal group.<br>
The term "nucleic acid" is defined as a molecule formed by covalent linkage of two or more<br>
nucleotides. The terms "nucleic acid" and "polynucleotide" are used Interchangeable herein.<br>
The term "nucleic acid analogue" refers to a non-natural nucleic acid binding compound.<br><br>

Beta-D-oxy-LNA is the LNA nucleotlde analogue use-In the LNA oligonucleotidesof the   <br>
present invention, and the monomer structure (nucleoside) is shown in Scheme 1.<br><br>
Beta-D-oxy-LNA<br>
Scheme 1<br>
In Scheme 1, Z* and Z indicate the position of a internucleotide linkage to a neighbouring<br>
nucleoside or a terminal group (i.e. either a 5'-terminal group or a 3'-terminal group).<br>
One particular example of beta-D-oxy-LNA monomer is the thymidine LNA monomer (LNA<br>
nucleoside analogue) (1S,3R, 4R, 7S)-7-hydroxy-l-hydroxymethyl-5-methyl-3-(thymin-lyl)-<br>
2,5-dioxa-bicyclo[2:2:l]heptane, i.e. T-beta-D-oxy-LNA.<br>
The term "oligonucleotide" refers, in the context of the present invention, to an ollgomer<br>
(also called oligo) or nucleic acid polymer (e.g. ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic<br>
acid (DNA)) or nucleic acid analogue of those known in the art, preferably Locked Nucleic<br>
Acid (LNA), or a mixture thereof. This term includes ollgonucleotldes composed of naturally<br>
occurring nucleobases, sugars and internucleoside (backbone) linkages as well as<br>
oligonucleotides having non-naturally-occurring portions which function similarly or with<br>
specific improved functions. Fully or partly modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often<br>
preferred over native forms because of several desirable properties of such oligonucleotides<br>
such as for instance, the ability to penetrate a cell membrane, good resistance to extra- and<br>
intracellular nucleases, high affinity and specificity for the nucleic acid target. The LNA<br>
oligonucleotides of the invention exhibit the above-mentioned properties.<br><br>

13<br>
By the terms "unit" and "nucteotide unit" Is understood a monomer, i.e. a 2-deoxynucleotide<br>
or a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucieotlde analogue.<br>
The term "at least one" comprises the integers larger than or equal to 1, such as 1, 2, 3, 4,<br>
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and so. forth.<br>
The term "a" as used about a nuclcoside, a nucleoside analogue, a SEQ ID NO, etc. is<br>
intended to mean one ormore. In particular, the expression "a component (such as a<br>
nucteoside, a nucleoside analogue, a SEQ ID NO or the like) selected from the group<br>
consisting of ..." is intended to mean that one or more of the cited components-may be<br>
selected. Thus, expressions like "a component selected from the group consisting of A, B and<br>
C" is intended to include all combinations of A, B and C, i.e. A, B, C, A+B, A+C, B+C and<br>
A+B+C.<br>
Throughout this specification, the word "comprise", or.variations such as "comprises" or<br>
"comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element, integer or step,<br>
or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other element, integer<br>
or step, or group of elements, integers or steps.<br>
Preparation of the LNA oligonudeotides<br>
The LNA nucleotide analogue building blocks (8-D-oxy-LNA) can be prepared following<br>
published procedures and references cited therein, see, e.g., WO 03/095467 Al; D. S.<br>
Pedersen, C. Rosenbohm, T. Koch (2002) Preparation of LNA Phosphoramidites, Synthesis 6,<br>
802-808; and WO 2004/069991 A2.<br>
The LNA oligonudeotides can be prepared HS described In the Examples and in WO 99/14226,<br>
WO 00/56746, WO 00/56748, WO 00/66604, WO 00/125248, WO 02/28875, WO<br>
2002/094250 and WO 03/006475. Thus, the LNA oligonudeotides may be produced using the<br>
oligomerisation techniques of nucleic acid chemistry well-known to a person of ordinary skill<br>
in the art of organic chemistry. Generally, standard oligomerisation cycles of the<br>
phosphoramidite approach (S. L. Beaucage and R. P. Iyer, Tetrahedron, 1993, 49, 6123; S.<br>
L. Beaucage and R. P. Iyer, Tetrahedron, 1992, 48, 2223) are used, but e.g. H-phosphonate<br>
chemistry, phosphotriester chemistry can also be used.<br>
For some monomers, longer coupling time, and/or repeated couplings and/or use of more<br>
concentrated coupling reagents may be necessary or beneficial.<br><br>
WO 2006/050734	PCT/DK2005/000721<br>
14<br>
The phosphoramidites employed couple typically with satisfactory &gt;95% step-wise yields.<br>
Oxidation of the phosphorous(lll) to phosphorous(V) is normally done with e.g.<br>
iodine/pyridme/HzO. This yields after deprotection the native phosphorodiester<br>
mtemucteoside linkage. In the case that a phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage is<br>
prepared a thtoiation step is performed by exchanging the normal, e.g. iodine/pyridine/H2O,<br>
oxidation used for synthesis of phosphorodiester internucleoside linkages with an oxidation<br>
using the ADTT reagent (xanthane hydride (0.01 M in acetonitrile:pyridine 9:1; v/v)). Other<br>
thiolation reagents are also possible to use, such as Beaucage and PADS. The<br>
phosphorothioate LNA otiganucleotides were efficiently synthesized with stepwise coupling<br>
yields &gt;= 98%.<br>
Purification of LNA oligonucleotides can be accomplished using disposable reversed phase<br>
purification cartridges and/or reversed phase HPLC and/or precipitation from ethanol or<br>
butanol. Capillary gel electrophoresis, reversed phase HPLC, MALDI-MS, and ESI-MS were<br>
used to verify the purity of the synthesized LNA oligonucleotides.<br>
Salts<br>
The LNA oligonucleotide can be employed in a variety of pharmaceutically acceptable sails.<br>
As used herein, the term refers to salts that retain the desired biological activity of the LNA<br>
oligonucleotide and exhibit minimal undesired toxicological effects. Non-limiting examples of<br>
such salts can be formed with organic amfno acid and base addition salts formed with metal<br>
cations such as zinc, calcium, bismuth, barium, magnesium, aluminum, copper, cobalt,<br>
nickel, cadmium, sodium, potassium, and the like, or with a cation formed from ammonia,<br>
/V,/V-dlbenzylethylene-diamine, D-glucosaminer tetraethylammonium, or ethylenediamine; or<br>
combinations, e.g., a zinc tannate salt or the like.<br>
Such salts are formed, from the LNA oligonucleotide which possess phosphorodiester group<br>
and/or phosphorothioate groups, and are, for example, salts with suitable bases. These salts<br>
include, for example, nontoxic metal salts which are derived from metals of groups la, Ib, Ha<br>
and lib of the Periodic System of the elements, in particular suitable alkali metal salts, for<br>
example lithium, sodium or potassium salts, or alkaline earth metal salts, for example<br>
magnesium or calcium salts. They furthermore include zinc and ammonium salts and also<br>
salts which are formed with suitable organic amines, such as unsubstituted or hydroxyl-<br>
substituted mono-, di- or tri-alkylamines, in particular mono-, di- or trl-alkylamines, or with<br>
quaternary ammonium compounds, for example with N-methyl-N-ethylamine, diethylamlne,<br>
triethylamine, mono-, bis- or tns-(2-hydroxy-lower alkyl)amines, such as mono-, bis- or tris-<br>
(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, 2-hydroxy-tert-butyiamine or tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine, N,N-<br><br>
WO 2006/050734	PCT/DK2005/000721<br>
15<br>
di-lower alkyl-N-(hydroxy-lower alkyt)amlnes, such as N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-<br>
amine or tri-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, or N-metnyl-D-glucamine, or quaternary ammonium<br>
compounds such as tetrabutytammonium salts. Lithium salts, sodium salts, magnesium salts,<br>
zinc salts or potassium salts are preferred, with sodium salts being particularly preferred.<br>
Prodrugs<br>
In one embodiment, the LNA oligonucleotide may be in the form of a pro-drug.<br>
Oligonucleotides are by virtue negatively charged ions. Due to the lipophilic nature of cell<br>
membranes, the cellular uptake of oligonucleotides is reduced compared to neutral or<br>
lipophilic equivalents. This polarity "hindrance" can be avoided by using the pro-drug<br>
approach (see e.g. Crooke, R. M. (1998) in Crooke, S. T. Antisense research and Application.<br>
Springer-Vertag, Benin, Germany, vol. 131, pp. 103-140). In this approach, the LNA<br>
oligonucleotides are prepared in a'protected mannerso that the LNA oltgonucleotldcs are<br>
neutral when it is administered. These protection groups are designed in such a way that<br>
they can be removed then the LNA oligonucleotide is taken up be the cells. Examples of such<br>
protection groups are S-acetylthioethyl (SATE) or S-pivaloylthioethyl (r-butyl-SATE). These<br>
protection groups are nuclease resistant and are selectively removed intracellulary.<br>
Conjugates<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a conjugate comprising an LNA oligonucleotide as<br>
defined herein at least one non-nucleotide or non-polynucleotide moiety covalently attached<br>
to said LNA oligonucleotide.<br>
In a related aspect of the Invention, the LNA oligonucleotide of the invention is linked to<br>
ligands so as to form a conjugate, said ligands intended to increase the cellular uptake of the<br>
conjugate relative to the antisense oligonucleotides.<br>
In the present context, the term "conjugate" is intended to indicate a heterogenous molecule<br>
formed by the covalent attachment of an LNA oligonucleotide as described herein (i.e. an LNA<br>
oligonucleotide comprising a sequence of nucleosldes and LNA nucleoside analogues) to one<br>
or more non-nucleotide or non-polynucleotide moieties.<br>
Thus, the LNA oligonucleotides may, e.g., be conjugated or form chimera with non-nucleotide<br>
or non-polynucleotide moieties including Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNA), proteins (e.g.<br>
antibodies for a target protein), macromolecules, low molecular weight drug substances, fatty<br>
acid chains, sugar residues, glycoproteins, polymers (e.g. polyethylene glycol), micelle-<br><br>
WO 2006/050734	PCT/DK2005/000721<br>
16<br>
forming groups, antibodies, carbohydrates, receptor-binding groups, steroids such as<br>
cholesterol, polypeptides, intercalating agents such as an acridine derivative, a long-chain<br>
alcohol, a dendrimer, a phosphoiipid and other llpophilic groups or combinations thereof, etc.,<br>
just as the LNA oligonucteotides may be arranged in dimenc or dendritic structures. The LNA<br>
oligonucleotides or conjugates of the invention may aiso be conjugated or further conjugated<br>
to active drug substances/ for example; aspirin, ibuprofen, a-sutfa drug,-an antidiabetic, an<br>
antibacterial agent, a chemotherapeutic agent or an antibiotic.<br>
Conjugating in this way may confer advantageous properties with regard to the<br>
pharmacokinetic characteristics of the LNA oligonucleotides. In particular, conjugating in this<br>
way achieves increased cellular uptake.<br>
In one embodiment, an LNA oligonucleotide is linked to ligands so as to form a conjugate,<br>
said ligands intended to increase the cellular uptake of the conjugate relative to the antisense<br>
LNA oligonucleotides. This conjugation can take place at the terminal positions 5'/3'-OH but<br>
the ligands may also take place at the sugars and/or the bases. In particular, the growth<br>
factor to which the antisense LNA oligonucleotide may be conjugated, may comprise<br>
transfernn or folate. Transferrin-polylysine-oligonucleotide complexes or folate-polylysine-<br>
oligonucleotide complexes may be prepared for uptake by cells expressing high levels of<br>
transferrin or folate receptor. Other examples of conjugates/ligands are cholesterol moieties,<br>
duplex intercalators such as acridine, poly-L-lysine, "end-capping" with one or more<br>
nuclease-resistant linkage groups such as phosphoromonothioate, and the like.<br>
The preparation of transferrin complexes as carriers of oligonucleotide uptake into cells is<br>
described by Wagner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 3410-3414 (1990). Cellular<br>
delivery of folate-macromolecule conjugates via folate receptor endocytosis, including<br>
delivery of an antisense oligonucleotide, is described by Low et al., U.S. Patent 5,108,921.<br>
Also see, Leamon et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 88, 5572 (1991).<br>
Pharmaceutical composition<br>
A particularly interesting aspect of the invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising an LNA oligonucleotide as defined herein or a conjugate as defined herein, and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or adjuvant.The pharmaceutical composition Is   .<br>
preferably suitable for injection, for topical administration, or for intraocular administration<br>
(see further below).<br><br>
WO 2006/050734	PCT/DK2005/000721<br>
17<br>
Directions for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions can be found in "Remington:<br>
The Science and Practice of Pharmacy" by Alfonso R. Gennaro, and in the following.<br>
Pharmaceuticslly acceptable diluents, carriers or adjuvants are part of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition. Capsules, tablets and pilis etc. may contain for example the following<br>
compounds: microcrystalline cellulose, gum or gelatin as binders; starch or lactose as<br>
excipients; stearates as lubricants; various sweetening or flavouring agents. For capsules the<br>
dosage unit may contain a liquid carrier like fatty oils. Likewise coatings of sugar or enteric<br>
agents may be part of the dosage unit. The pharmaceutical composition may also be<br>
emulsions of the active pharmaceutical Ingredients (including the LNA oligonucleotide) and a<br>
lipid forming a micellular emulsion.<br>
An LNA otigonudeotide may be mixed with any material that do not impair the desired action,<br>
or with material that supplement the desired action. These could include other drugs<br>
including other oligonucieoside compounds.<br>
For parenteral, subcutaneous, intradermal or topical administration, the formulation may<br>
include a sterile diluent {e.g. water), buffer(s), regulators of tonicity and ionic strength and<br>
antlbacterials. The active LNA oligonucleotide may be prepared with carriers that facilitate<br>
uptake, protect against degradation or protect against immediate elimination from the body,<br>
including implants or microcapsules with controlled release properties. For intravenous<br>
administration the preferred carriers are physiological saline (0.9%) or buffered saline (e.g.<br>
phosphate buffered saline).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, injections or infusions of the LNA oligonudeotides are given at or<br>
near the site of neovascularization. For example, the LNA oligonudeotides of the invention<br>
can be delivered to retinal pigment epithelial cells in the eye. Preferably, the LNA<br>
oligonudeotides is administered topically to the eye, e.g. in liquid or gel form to the lower<br>
eye lid or conjunctival cul-de-sac, as is within the skill in the art (see, e.g., Acheampong AA<br>
et al, 2002, Drug Metabol. and Disposition 30: 421- 429, the entire disclosure of which is<br>
herein incorporated by reference).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in a number<br>
of ways depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon" the area to '<br>
be treated. Administration may be (a) oral, (b) pulmonary, e.g., by inhalation or insufflation<br>
of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal, intranasal, (c) topical including<br>
epidermal, transdermal, ophthalmic and to mucous-membranes including vaginal and rectal<br>
delivery; or (d) parenteral including intravenous, Intraarterial, subcutaneous, mtraperttoneat .<br>
or intramuscular injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., Intrathecal or intraventricular,<br><br>
WO 2006/050734	PCT/DK2005/000721<br>
    18<br>
administration. In one embodiment, the active LNA oligonudeotide is administered<br>
intravenous, intraperitonal, orally, topically or as a boius injection or administered directly in<br>
to the target organ.<br>
It is currently believed that the most appropriate administration form is by intravenous<br>
infusions or oral.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include<br>
transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, sprays, suppositories, liquids<br>
and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases,<br>
thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like<br>
may also be useful. Preferred topical formulations include those in which the oligonucleotides<br>
of the invention are in admixture with a topical delivery agent such as liplds, liposomes, fatty<br>
acids, fatty acid esters, steroids, chelating agents and surfactants. Compositions and<br>
formulations for oral administration include but are not restricted to powders or granules,<br>
microparticulates, nanoparticulates, suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media,<br>
capsules, gel capsules, sachets, tablets or minitablets. Compositions and formulations for<br>
parenteral, intrathecal or intraventricular administration may include sterile aqueous<br>
solutions which may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives such as, but<br>
not limited to, penetration enhancers, carrier compounds and other pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
solutions, emulsions, and liposome-containing formulations. These compositions may be<br>
generated from a variety of components that include, but are not limited to, preformed<br>
liquids, self- emulsifying solids and self-emulsifying semisolids. Delivery of drug to tumour<br>
tissue may be enhanced by carrier-mediated delivery including, but not limited to, cationic<br>
liposomes, cydodextrins, porphyrin derivatives, branched chain dendrimers, polyethylenimine<br>
polymers, nanoparticles and microspheres (Dass CR. J Pharm Pharmacol 2002; 54(l):3-27).<br>
A particularly preferred parenteral administration route is Intraocular administration. It is<br>
understood that intraocular administration of the present LNA oligonucleotides can be<br>
accomplished by injection or direct (e.g., topical) administration to the eye, as long as the<br>
administration route allows the LNA oligonucleotides to enter the eye. In addition to the<br>
topical routes of administration to the eye described above, suitable intraocular routes of<br>
administration include inlravitreat, intraretinal, subretinal, subtenon, pen- and retro-orbital,<br>
trans-corneal and trans-scleral administration.<br><br>
WO 2006/050734	PCT/DK2005/000721<br>
19<br>
For intraocular administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be administered<br>
topically, for example, by patch or by direct application to the eye, or by tontophoresis<br>
Ointments, sprays, or droppable liquids can be delivered by ocular delivery systems known in<br>
the art such.as applicatora or eyedroppers. The compositions can be administered directlyto<br>
the surface of the eye or to the interior af the eyelid. Such compositions can include<br>
mucomimetics such as hyaluronic add, chondrottin sulfate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or<br>
poly(vinyl alcohol), preservatives such as sorbic acid, EDTA or benzyichronium chloride, and<br>

The LIMA oligonucleotide of the invention may be provided in sustained release compositions,<br>
such as those described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5, 672,659 and 5,595,760. The use<br>
of immediate or sustained release compositions depends on the nature of the condition being<br>
treated. If the condition consists of an acute or over-acute disorder, treatment with an<br>
immediate release form will be preferred over a prolonged release composition. Alternatively,<br>
for certain preventative or long-term treatments, a sustained release composition may be<br>
appropriate.<br>

therapeutically effective amount without causing serious side effects in the treated patient.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention, which may conveniently be.<br>
presented in unit dosage form, may be prepared according to conventional techniques well-<br>
known in the pharmaceutical industry. Such techniques include the step of bringing into<br>
association the active ingredients with the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient(s). In<br>

the active ingredients with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if<br>
necessary, shaping the product.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be formulated Into any of many possible<br>
dosage forms such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gel capsules, liquid syrups, soft<br>
gels and suppositories. The compositions of the present invention may also be formulated as<br>

In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is administered in combination with a<br>
taxane compound.<br>
The term "taxane compound" is intended to encompass paclitaxel (Taxol®), paclitaxel<br>
derivatives, docetaxel, taxotere, modified taxanes, and taxoid analogues. Paclitaxel (Taxol®)<br>
is a diterpene isolated from the bark of the Western (Pacific) yew, Taxus brevifolia and is<br>
representative of a class of therapeutic agents having a taxane ring system. Paclitaxel and its<br>
analogs have been produced by partial synthesis from 10-deacetylbaccatln III, a precursor<br>
obtained from yew needles and twigs, and by total synthesis. See Holton, et al., J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 116:1597-1601 (1994) and Nlcolaou, et al., Nature 367:630 (1994). Paclitaxel<br>
has demonstrated efficacy in several human tumours in clinical trials. See McGuire, et al.,<br>
Ann. Int. Med. 111:237-279 (1989); Holmes, etal., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 83:1797-1805<br>
(1991); Kohn et at., J. Natt. Cancer Inst. 86:18-24 (1994); and Kohn, et al., American<br>
Society for Clinical Oncology 12 (1993). The modified taxane or taxoid analogs are those<br>
compounds having a taxane ring bearing modified side cnains. A number of these analogs<br>
have improved properties, such as greater water solubility and stability than that of naturally<br>
occurring paclitaxel. These analogs are known to those skilled in the art and are disclosed, for"   <br>
example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,278,324; 5,272,171; 5,254,530; 5,250,683; 5,248,796; and<br>
5,227,400, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Paclitaxel and<br>
taxotere can be preparedby the methods in WO 93/18210, EP 0 253 739; EP 0 253 739, and<br>
WO 92/09589, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. In particular<br>
embodiments, the taxane compound is paclitaxel or taxotere.<br><br>
WO 2006/050734	PCT/DK2005/000721<br>
23<br>

composition is typically in the range of 50:1 to l:25,.such.as In the range of 25:1 to 1:25,.or.<br>
in the range of 10:1 to 1:25, or in the range of 1:1 to 1:25, or in the range of 50:1 to 1:10,<br>
or in the range of 1:1 to 1:50, or in the range of 25:1 to 1:10.<br>
In a further embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions of the Invention may contain one or<br>
more LNA aligonudeotides and one or more additional antisense compounds targeted to a<br>
second nucleic acid target. Two or more combined compounds may be used together or<br>
sequentially.<br>
Anti-inflammatory drugs, including but not limited to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs<br>
and corticosteroids, antiviral drugs, and immuno-modulating drugs may also be combined in<br>
compositions of the invention. Two or more combined compounds may be used together or<br>
sequentially.<br>

Medical treatment<br>
LNA oligonucleotides of the invention are useful for a number of therapeutic applications as<br>
indicated herein. In general, therapeutic methods of the invention include administration of a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of an LNA-modified oligonucleotide to a mammal,<br>
particularly a human.<br>
Hence, the present invention also relates to an LNA oligonucleotide as defined herein or a<br>
conjugate as defined herein for use as a medicament.<br>
Dosing is dependent on seventy and responsiveness of the disease state to be treated, and<br>
the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is<br>
effected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can also<br>
be assessed by measurements of drug in the body of the patient or by surrogate markers.<br>
Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual oligonucleotides.<br>
Generally, it can be estimated based on EC50s found to be effective in in vitro and in vivo ■<br>
animal models. In general, dosage is from 0.01 pg to 1 g per kg of body weight, and may be<br>
given once or more daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, or even once every. 2 to 10 years or by<br>
continuous infusion for hours up to several months. The repetition rates for dosing can be<br><br>
WO 2006/050734	PCT/DK2005/000721<br>
24<br>
estimated based on measured residence times and concentrations of  the drug in bodily fluids<br>
or tissues. Following successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the patient undergo .<br>
maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease state. It is currently believed<br>
that the most relevant doses are 0.01 mg to 100 mg, such as 0.1 mg to 40 mg, or 0.5 mg to<br>
10 mg, per kg of body weight. Such doses may be given once daily, but more preferably less<br>
frequent, e.g; 1-3 timesper week, for a period of 1-4 weeks. Maintenance therapy may be<br>
continued, e.g. 1-4 times per month or even less frequent such 1-10 times per year.<br>
A person skilled In the art will appreciate that LNA oligonucleotides can be used to combat<br>
HIF-1a linked diseases by many different principles, which thus falls within the spirit of the<br>
present invention.<br>
As used herein, the terms "target nucleic acid" encompass DNA encoding the HIF-la, RNA<br>
(including pre-mRNA and mRNA) transcribed from such DNA, and also cDNA derived from<br>
such RNA.<br>
As used herein, the term "gene" means the gene including exons, introns, non-coding 5'and<br>
3 'regions and regulatory elements and all currently known variants thereof and any further<br>
variants, which may be elucidated.<br>
As used herein, the term "LNA oligonucleotide" refers to an oligonucleotide which can induce<br>
a desired therapeutic effect in humans through for example binding by hydrogen bonding to<br>
either a target gene "Chimeraplast" and TFO", to the RNA transcript(s) of the target gene<br>
"antisense inhibitors", "siRNA", "miRNA", "rlbozymes" and oligozymes" or to the proteln(s)<br>
encoding by the target gene "aptamer", splegelmer" or "decoy".<br>
As used herein, the term "mRNA" means the presently known mRNA transcript(s) of a<br>
targeted gene, and any further transcripts, which.may be identified.<br>
As used herein, the term "modulation" means either an increase (stimulation) or a decrease<br>
(inhibition) in the expression of a gene. In the present invention, inhibition is the preferred<br>
form of modulation of gene expression and mRNA is a preferred target.<br>
As used herein, the term "targeting" an antisense compound to a particular target nucleic<br>
acid means providing the antisense oligonucleotide to the cell, animal or human in such a<br>
way that the antisense compound are able to bind to and modulate the function of its<br>
intended target.<br><br>
WO 2006/050734	PCT/DK2005/000721<br>

The LNA ofigonucleotides may be designed as siRNA' s which are small double stranded RNA<br>
molecules that are used by celts to silence specific endogenous or exogenous genes by an as<br>
yet poorly understood "antisense-lfke" mechanism.<br>
The clinical effectiveness of antisense oligonucieotides depends to a significant extent on<br>
their pharmacokinetics e.g. absorption, distribution, cellular uptake, metabolism and<br>
excretion. In turn, these parameters are guided significantly by the underlying chemistry and<br>
the size and three-dimensional structure of the oligonucleotide.<br>
Modulating the pharmacokinetic properties of an LNA oligonucleotide according to the<br>
invention may further be achieved through attachment of a variety of different moieties. For<br>
instance, the ability of oligonucieotides to pass the cell membrane may be enhanced by<br>
attaching for instance llpid moieties such as a cholesterol moiety, a thioether, an aliphatic<br>
chain, a phosphotipid or a polyamine to the oliganucieotide. Likewise, uptake of LNA<br>
oligonucieotides into cells may be enhanced by conjugating moieties to the oligonucleotide<br>
that interacts with molecules in the membrane, which mediates transport into the cytoplasm.<br>
The pharmacodynamic properties can according to the invention be enhanced with groups<br>
that improve LNA oligonucleotide uptake, enhance biostability such as enhance LNA<br>
oligonucleotide resistance to degradation, and/or increase the specificity and affinity of<br>
oligonucieotides hybridisation characteristics with target sequence e.g. a mRNA sequence.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention can be used for the treatment of<br>
many different diseases. Like cancer ceils proliferating vascular endothelial cells are sensitive<br>
to down-regulation of HIF-la expression. The pharmaceutical composition according to the<br>
invention can therefore be used in the treatment of diseases characterized by abnormal<br>
disease causing angiogenesis. Examples of such diseases are cancers in general and<br>
artherosclerosis, psoriasis, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritrs,<br>
asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, warts, allergic dermatitis and Karposis sarcoma.<br>
Generally stated, one aspect of the invention :s directed to a metnod of treating a mammal<br>
suffering from or susceptible to a disease caused by abnormal angiogenesis, comprising . -<br>
administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of an LNA oligonucleotide or<br>
a conjugate as defined herein.<br>
Furthermore, the invention also relates to a method of .inhibiting angiogenesis comprising the<br>
administration of an LNA oligonucleotide as defined herein or a conjugate as defined herein or<br>
a pharmaceutical composition asr defined herein.<br><br>

An Interesting aspect of the invention is directed to the use of an LNA oligonucleotide as<br>
defined herein or as conjugate as defined herein for the preparation of a medicament for the<br>
treatment of a disease selected from artherosclerosis, psoriasis, diabetic retinopathy, macular<br>
degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, warts, allergic<br>
dermatitis, inflammation, and skin inflammation, or other skin related diseases.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention can also be used In the treatment<br>
of inflammatory disease, inflammations such as skin inflammations or other skin diseases or<br>
disorders, e.g. psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Similarly, another interesting aspect of the invention is directed to a method for treating a<br>
disease selected from the group consisting of artherosclerosis, psoriasis, diabetic retinopathy,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, warts, allergic dermatitis,<br>
inflammation, and skin inflammation, said method comprising administering an LNA<br>
oligonucleotide as defined herein or a conjugate as defined herein or a pharmaceutical<br>
composition as defined herein to a patient in need thereof.<br>
Particularly interesting are angiogenic diseases include diabetic retinopathy, macular<br>
degeneration, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease, and other<br>
inflammatory diseases. These diseases are characterized by the destruction of normal tissue<br>
by newly formed blood vessels in the area of neovasculanzation. For example, in macular<br>
degeneration, the choroid is invaded and destroyed by capillaries. The angiogenesis-dnven<br>
destruction of the choroid in macular degeneration eventually, leads to partial or full<br>
blindness.<br>
The methods of the Invention is preferably employed for treatment or prophylaxis against<br>
diseases caused by cancer, particularly for treatment of cancer as may occur ir&gt; tissue such<br>
as lung, breast, colon, prostate, pancreas, liver, thyroid, kidney, brain, tastes, stomach,<br>
intestine, bowel, spinal cord, sinuses, bladder, urinary tract or ovaries cancer.<br>
Furthermore, the invention described herein encompasses a method of preventing or treating<br>
cancer comprising a therapeutically effective.amount of a HIF-1a modulating LNA    -<br>
oligonucleotide, including but not limited to high doses of the LNA oligonucleotide, to a<br>
human in need of such therapy. The Invention further encompasses the use of a short period<br>
of administration of a HIF-la modulating LNA oligonucleotide. Normal, non-cancerous ceils<br>
divide at a frequency characteristic for the particular cell type. When a cell has been<br>
transformed into a cancerous state, uncontrolled cell proliferation and reduced cell death<br>
results, and therefore, promiscuous cell division or cell growth is a hallmark of a cancerous<br>
cell type.<br><br>

Kits<br>
If the pharmaceutical composition in liquid form is under risk of being subjected to conditions<br>
which will compromise the stability of the LNA oligonucleotide, it may be preferred to produce<br>
the finished product containing the LNA oligonucleotide in a solid form, e.g. as a freeze dried<br>
material, and store the product is such solid form. The product may then be reconstituted<br>
(e.g. dissolved or suspended) in a saline or in a buffered saline ready for use prior to<br>
administration.<br>
Hence, the present invention also provides a kit comprising<br><br>

EXPERIMENTALS<br>
Example 1: Monomer synthesis<br>
The LNA monomer building blocks and derivatives thereof were prepared following published<br>
procedures and references cited therein, see, e.g. WO 03/095467 Al and D. S. Pedersen, C.<br>
Rosenbohm, T. Koch (2002) Preparation of LNA Phosphoramidites, Synthesis 6, 802-808.<br>
Example 2: Oiigonucleotide synthesis<br>
Oligonucleotides were synthesized using the phosphoramldite approach on an Expedite<br>
8900/MOSS synthesizer (Multiple Oligonucleotide Synthesis System) at 1 |jmol or 15 umol<br>
scale. For larger scale synthesis an Akta Oligo Pilot was used. At the end of the synthesis<br>
(DMT-on), the oligonucleotides were cleaved from the solid support using aqueous ammonia<br>
for 1-2 hours at room temperature, and further deprotected for 4 hours at 65°C. The<br>
oligonucleotides were purified by reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC). After the removal of the<br>
DMT-group, the oligonucleotides were characterized by AE-HPLC, RP-HPLC, and CGE and the<br>
molecular mass was further confirmed by ESI-MS. See below for more details.<br><br>

Preparation of the LNA-solid support:<br>
Preparation of the LNA succinyl hemiester<br>
5'-O-Dmt-3'-hydroxy-LNA monomer (500 mg), succinic anhydride (1.2 eq.) and DMAP (1.2<br>
eq.) were dissolved in DCM (35 mL). The reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight.<br>
After extractions with NaH2PO4 0.1 M pH 5.5 (2x) and brine (1x), the organic layer was<br>
further dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 filtered and evaporated. The hemiester derivative was<br>
obtained in 95% yield and was used without any further purification.<br>
Preparation of the LNA-support<br>
The above prepared hemiester derivative (90 μmol) was dissolved in a minimum amount of<br>
DMF, DIEA and pyBOP (90 umol) were added and mixed together for 1 mm. This pre-<br>
activated mixture was combined with LCAA-CPG (500 A, 80-120 mesh size, 300 mg) in a<br>
manual synthesizer and stirred. After 1.5 hours at room temperature, the support was<br>
filtered off and washed with DMF, DCM and MeOH. After drying, the loading was determined<br>
to be 57 μmol/g (see Tom Brown, Dorcas J.S.Brown. Modern machine-aided methods of<br>
oligodeoxynbonucleotide synthesis. In: F.Eckstein, editor. Oligonucleotides and Analogues A<br>
Practical Approach. Oxford: IRL Press, 1991: 13-14).<br>
Elongation of the oliqonucleotide<br>
The coupling of phosphoramidites (A(bz), G(ibu), 5-methyl-C(bz)) or T-p-cyanoethyl-<br>
phosphoramldite) is performed by using a solution of 0.1 M of the 5'-O-DMT-protected<br>
amidite in acetonitrile and DCI (4,5-dicyanoimidazole) in acetonitrile (0.25 M) as activator.<br>
The thiolatlon is carried out by using xanthane chloride (0.01 M in acetonitrile:pyndine 10%).<br>
The rest of the reagents are the ones typically used for oligonucleotide synthesis. The<br>
protocol provided by the supplier was conveniently optimised.<br>

Treatment of subcutaneous tumour xenografts on nude mice using LNA oligonucleotides.<br>
Tumour cells were implanted subcutaneously and then serially passaged by three consecutive<br>
Transplantations. Tumour fragments of 1 mm were Implanted subcutaneously with a krocar<br>
needle in NMRI nude mice. Alternatively, cancer cells typically 10E6 to 10E7 cells suspended<br>
in 300 uL matrigel (BD Bioscience), were subcutaneously injected Into the flanks of NMRI:<br>
nude mice. Mice were treated by intra-peritoneal injections 5 mg/kg/day. Individual<br>
treatment of the mice started when tumour volume reached 50 mm3. Treatment with PBS<br>
was initiated when mean tumour volume of the control (saline treated) group reached 50<br>
mm3. The experiment was terminated when tumours of any group reached maximum allowed<br>
sizes. The tumour sizes of all mice were measured daily by callper measurements. The effect<br>
of treatment was measured as tumour size and tumour growth rate.<br>
In another study using SEQ ID NO. 1, vital tumor pieces from U373 donor mice are<br>
transplanted onto the fat tissue of the ovaries (day 0) of nude mice. On day four and nine<br>
after transplantation mice are treated with LNA oligonucleotide at 50 mg/kg (i.p). Mice are<br>
sacrificed 2 days after the last dose (day 11) and tumor weight plus staining of tumors with<br>
CD-31 ab is performed (See Figures 8A and 8C).<br>

Sections were chosen for phosphor imaging to best represent the tissues and organs of<br>
interest. Together with a set of 3H calibration standards, the sections were covered with a<br>
thin layer of talcum powder and put on Imaging plates. Due to the low energy of 3H, talcum<br>
powder was used instead of plastic foil in order to protect the image plate. The imaging<br>
plates were exposed for 3-7 days at room temperature, enclosed in light tight cassettes in a<br>
lead shielding box to protect from environmental radiation.<br>
Following exposure the imaging plates were scanned at a pixel size of 50 μm using BAS 2500<br>
(Fuji Film Sverige AB, Sweden). The tissues and organs of interest were quantified using<br>
AIDA, version 2.43 (Raytest, Germany).<br>
A water-soluble standard test solution of 3H radioactivity was mixed with whole blood and<br>
used for the production of the calibration scale. The standard series consisted of 10 dilutions<br>
from 65.44 to 0.30 nCi/mg. For the purpose of quantification, it was assumed that all tissues<br>
had similar density and quench characteristics as that of whole blood. The tissue density was<br>
set to 1 g/ml. The limit of quantification was defined as the mean concentration value of<br>
eight measurements for background plus three-times thestandarddeviation value of these<br>
measurements.<br>
The various tissues and organs were identified either on the autoradiograms or on the<br>
corresponding tissue sections. The term uvea used in this study includes the retinal pigment<br>
epithelium representing melanin containing structures, chorowds and sclera "of-the eye. (see<br>
Figures 14A and 14B}.<br>
Example 22: Western clot of HUVEC ceils transfected with SEQ ID NO. 1-<br>
Normal Human Umbilical VelivEndothelial (HUVEC) celis were cultured in Cambnx-EGM2<br>
medie were transfected as described in example using 2 and 5 nM SEQ ID NO. 1 or 5 nM SEQ<br>
ID NO. 8. Following transfectson celts were exposed hypoxia (1% Oxygen) for 16 hours. At<br>
harvest cells were washed in PBS and iysed in a SDS containing lysis buffer (as described in<br>
example). 50 μg was loaded to-Tris-Acetategels and run at 150 V for 1 hour. Western<br>
blotting was performed as described in example and the blot was incubated in anti-human-<br>
HIF-1a (i:500) prior to visualisation by enhanced chemiluminescence. A potent down-<br>
regulation by SEQ ID NO. 1 is seen, whereas the scrambled control SEQ ID NO. 8-does not<br>
down-regulate HIF-1a expression in HUVEC cells.<br><br>

WO 2006/050734	PCT/DK2005/000721<br>
64<br>
35. A kit comprising<br>
(a)	a first component containing an LNA oligonudeotide as defined in any one of the claims<br>
1-11 or a conjugate as defined in claim 12 in solid form, and<br>
(b)	a second component containing saline or a buffer solution adapted for reconstitution of<br>
said LNA oligonucleotides.<br><br>
The present disclosure relates to an LNA oligonucleotide consisting of a sequence selected from the group consisting of 5'-(Tx GxGxcsasasasgscsastscscsTxGx T-3' and 5'-(Gx )TxTxascstsgscscststscsTxTx A-3', wherein capital letters designate a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleotide analogue, small letters designate a 2-deoxynucleotide, underline designates either a beta-D-oxy-LNA nucleotide analogue or a 2-deoxynucleotide, subscript "s" designates a phosphorothioate link between neighbouring nucleotides/LNA nucleotide analogues, and subscript "x" designates either a phosphorothioate link or a phosphorodiester link between neighbouring nucleotides/LNA nucleotide analogues, and wherein the sequence is optionally extended by up to five 2-deoxynucleotide units. The LNA oligonucleotides are useful for modulating the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), e.g. in the treatment of cancer diseases, inhibiting angiogenesis, inducing apoptosis, preventing cellular proliferation, or treating an angiogenic disease, e.g. diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration (ARMD), psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases.</td>
