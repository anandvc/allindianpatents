IMPROVED STRIPPABLE CABLE SHIELD COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The invention relates to semiconducting insulation shield compositions for electric<br>
power cables having a base polymer and a two-component adhesion modifying additive<br>
system. The invention also relates to the use of these semiconducting insulation shield<br>
compositions to manufacture semiconductive insulation shields for use in electric cables,<br>
electric cables made from these compositions and methods of making electric cables from<br>
these semiconducting insulation shield compositions. The semiconducting insulation shield<br>
compositions of the invention may be used as strippable insulation shields in power cables,<br>
primarily with medium voltage cables having a voltage from about 5 kV up to about 100 kV.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] A typical insulated electric power cable generally comprises one or more conductors<br>
in a cable core that is surrounded by several layers of polymeric materials including an inner<br>
semiconducting shield layer (conductor or strand shield), an insulating layer, an outer<br>
semiconducting shield layer (insulation shield), a metallic wire or tape shield used as the<br>
ground phase, and a protective jacket. Additional layers within this construction such as<br>
moisture impervious materials, are often incorporated. The invention pertains to the outer<br>
semiconducting insulation shield layer, i.e., the insulation shield and cables made with the<br>
outer semiconducting insulation shield in accordance with the invention.<br>
[0003] In general, semiconducting dielectric insulation shields can be classified into two<br>
distinct types, the first type being a type wherein the dielectric shield is securely bonded to<br>
the polymeric insulation so that stripping the dielectric shield is only possible by using a<br>
cutting tool that removes the dielectric shield alone with some of the cable insulation. This<br>
type of dielectric shield is preferred by companies that believe that this adhesion minimizes<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/119067	PCT/US2006/016350<br>
the risk of electric breakdown at the interface of the shield and insulation. The second type of<br>
dielectric shield is the "strippable" dielectric shield wherein the dielectric shield has a<br>
defined, limited, adhesion to the insulation so that the strippable shield can be peeled cleanly<br>
away from the insulation without removing any insulation. Current strippable shield<br>
compositions for use over insulation materials selected from polyethylene, cross-linked<br>
polyethylenes, or one of the ethylene copolymer rubbers such as ethylene-propylene rubber<br>
(EPR) or ethylene-propylene diene terpolymer (EPDM) are usually based on an ethylene-<br>
vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer base resin rendered conductive with an appropriate type and<br>
amount of carbon black.<br>
[0004] Strippable shield formulations of EVA and nitrile rubbers have been described by<br>
Ongchin, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,286,023 and 4,246,142; Burns et al. EP Application No.<br>
0,420,271B, Kakizaki et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,412,938 and Janssun, U.S. Pat. No. 4,226,823,<br>
each reference being herein incorporated by reference into this application. A problem with<br>
these strippable shield formulations of EVA and nitrile rubber is that the EVA's needed for<br>
this formulation have a relatively high vinyl acetate content to achieve the desired adhesion<br>
level with the result that the formulations are more rubbery than is desired for high speed<br>
extrusion of a commercial electric cable.<br>
[0005] Alternative adhesion-adjusting additives have also been proposed for use with EVA,<br>
for example waxy aliphatic hydrocarbons (Watanabe et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,933,107, herein<br>
incorporated by reference); low-molecular weight polyethylene (Burns Jr., U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,150,193 herein incorporated by reference); silicone oils, rubbers and block copolymers that<br>
are liquid at room temperature (Taniguchi et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,493,787 herein incorporated<br>
by reference); chlorosulfonated polyethylene, ethylene-propylene rubbers, polychloroprene,<br>
styrene-butadiene rubber, and natural rubber. However, the only adhesion-adjusting<br>
additives that appear to have found commercial acceptance have been paraffin waxes.<br>

WO 2006/119067	PCT/US2006/016350<br>
[0006] U.S. Patent No. 6,284,374 to Yamazaki, et al discloses a multi-component polymer<br>
composition for use in strippable semiconductive shields suitable for a polyolefin-insulated<br>
wire and cable crosslinked by silane grafting/water crosslinking. The main polymer<br>
component of the composition is mainly composed of an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer<br>
having a weight average molecular weight not less than 300,000.<br>
[0007] Commonly assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 6,274,066 and 6,013,202 disclose a strippable<br>
semiconductive shield made from a base polymer and an adhesion modifying additive.<br>
[0008] US Published Patent Application 2004/0217329A1 to Easter discloses a two<br>
component base polymer together with adhesion adjusting additives<br>
[0009] WO 2004/088674 Al to Person discloses a strippable semiconductive shield made<br>
from a base polymer which is a soft polymer and a hard polymer.<br>
[0010] The use of amide wax additives in a conductor shield has been proposed in commonly<br>
assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,491,849 to Easter to improve aging characteristics of the electric<br>
cable.<br>
[0011] In the manufacture of commercial quantities of electric cable, minor cost<br>
improvements to polymeric compositions where the resulting composition and/or cable<br>
employing the composition have acceptable physical or electric properties are considered<br>
significant advances in the art. This is because the competitive environment places great<br>
demands on product pricing as well as performance and longevity. An improvement which<br>
not only reduces cost but improves properties is considered extremely significant, as it<br>
positively impacts both cost and quality.<br>
[0012] It would be desirable to develop lower cost, easier to compound, strippable<br>
semiconductive insulation shield compositions. Other proposals require complicated<br>
compounding methods or additives that are, on average, twice as expensive as the base<br>
polymers when used to achieve lower adhesion and/or strippability.<br>

WO 2006/119067	PCT/US2006/016350<br>
[0013] A novel two component adhesion modifying additive system for strippable insulation<br>
shields is proposed which provides remarkable adhesion results while also improving cost<br>
over earlier systems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] The invention provides an insulation shield material with improved performance<br>
without the need for expensive additives, complex polymer formulations, or specially<br>
prepared carbon black.<br>
[0015] The invention also provides a semiconductive composition for use as a strippable<br>
semiconductive insulation shield layer in contact with the outer surface of a wire and cable<br>
insulation layer, the composition comprising a base polymer having a weight average<br>
molecular weight of not more than 200,000 and an adhesion modifying additive system<br>
comprising at least two components, each of said an adhesion modifying additive system<br>
components being different from said base polymer, said first component comprising a<br>
hydrocarbon wax or ethylene vinyl acetate wax and said second component comprising an<br>
amide wax; and a conductive carbon black.<br>

consisting of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene alkyl acrylate copolymers wherein<br>
the alkyl group is selected from Cl to C6 hydrocarbons, ethylene alkyl methacrylate<br>
copolymers wherein the alkyl group is selected from Cl to C6 hydrocarbons and ethylene<br>
alkyl acrylate alkyl methacrylate terpolymers wherein the alkyl group is independently<br>
selected from Cl to C6 hydrocarbons, and mixtures thereof. Preferably the base polymer<br>
comprises ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer having from about 28% to about 40% vinyl<br>
acetate.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/119067	PCT/US2006/016350<br>
[0017] In preferred embodiments of the invention the first component of the adhesion<br>
modifying additive system is an ethylene vinyl acetate wax having a vinyl acetate content of<br>
from about 10% to about 20% vinyl acetate.<br>
[0018] The amide wax may be selected from stearamide, oleamide, erucamide, ethylene bis-<br>
stearamide, ethylene bis-oleamide, ethylene bis-erucamide, behenamide, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
[0019] An electrically conductive cable utilizing the insulation shield in accordance with the<br>
invention is also provided.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0020] Conventional electrical insulators used in medium voltage cables include<br>
polyethylenes, cross-linked polyethylenes (XLPE), ethylene-propylene rubbers and ethylene<br>
propylene diene rubbers (EPDM rubbers). The term polyethylene is meant to include both<br>
polymers and copolymers wherein ethylene is the major component, this would include, for<br>
example metallocene or single site catalyzed ethylenes that are copolymerized with higher<br>
olefins.<br>
[0021] The polymers (other than those described below for use in the semiconductive<br>
composition for use as a strippable semiconductive insulation shield layer in accordance with<br>
the invention) utilized in the protective jacketing, insulating, conducting or semiconducting<br>
layers of the inventive cables may be made by any suitable process which allows for the yield<br>
of the desired polymer with the desired physical strength properties, electrical properties, tree<br>
retardancy, and melt temperature for processability.<br>
[0022] The strippable semiconductive insulation shields of the invention comprise a base<br>
polymer, a two-component adhesion modifying additive system and conductive carbon<br>
blacks. The conductive carbon blacks are added in an amount sufficient to decrease the<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/119067	PCT/US2006/016350<br>
electrical resistivity to less than 550 ohm-meter. Preferably the resistivity of the<br>
semiconductive shield is less than about 250 ohm-meter and even more preferably less than<br>
about 100 ohm-meter.<br>
SHIELD POLYMERS<br>
[0023] The invention provides a semiconductive resin composition for use as a<br>
semiconductive layer in contact with a wire and cable insulation layer. The resin<br>
composition comprises about 40 to about 85 weight percent, based upon the weight of the<br>
semiconductive resin composition, of a base polymer.<br>
[0024] The base polymer has a weight average molecular weight of not more than 200,000,<br>
preferably not more than 150,000 and more preferably not more than 100,000.<br>
[0025] The base polymer may be selected from ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene<br>
alkyl acrylate copolymers wherein the alkyl group is selected from Cl to C6 hydrocarbons,<br>
ethylene alkyl methacrylate copolymers wherein the alkyl group is selected from Cl to C6<br>
hydrocarbons and ethylene alkyl acrylate alkyl methacrylate terpolymers wherein the alkyl<br>
group is independently selected from Cl to C6 hydrocarbons.<br>
[0026] The ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer used in the base polymer can be any EVA<br>
copolymer with the following properties: the ability to accept high loadings of conductive<br>
carbon filler, elongation of 150 to 250 percent and sufficient melt strength to maintain its<br>
shape after extrusion. EVA copolymers with vinyl acetate levels above about 25 percent and<br>
below about 45 percent having these properties are known. Accordingly, the EVA<br>
copolymers in accordance with the invention can have a vinyl acetate percentage range of<br>
about 25 to 45 percent. A preferred EVA copolymer will have a vinyl acetate percentage<br>
range of about 25 to 40 percent and an even more preferred EVA copolymer will have a vinyl<br>
acetate percentage of about 28 to 40 percent, most preferably about 28 to about 33 percent.<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/119067	PCT/US2006/016350<br>
[0027] The ethylene alkyl acrylate copolymers used in the base polymer can be any suitable<br>
ethylene alkyl acrylate copolymers with the following properties: the ability to accept high<br>
loadings of conductive carbon filler, elongation of 150 to 250 percent and sufficient melt<br>
strength to maintain its shape after extrusion. The alkyl group can be any alkyl group selected<br>
from the Cl to C6 hydrocarbons, preferably the Cl to C4 hydrocarbons and even more<br>
preferable methyl. Some ethylene alkyl acrylate copolymers with alkyl acrylate levels above<br>
about 25 percent and below about 45 percent have these properties. The ethylene alkyl<br>
acrylate copolymers can have an alkyl acrylate percentage range of about 25 to 45 percent. A<br>
preferred ethylene alkyl acrylate copolymer will have an alkyl acrylate percentage range of<br>
about 28 to 40 percent and an even more preferred ethylene alkyl acrylate copolymer will<br>
have an alkyl acrylate percentage of about 28 to 33 percent. The ethylene alkyl acrylate<br>
copolymer used in the base polymer has a weight average molecular weight of not more than<br>
200,000, preferably not more than 150,000 and more preferably not more than 100,000.<br>
[0028] The ethylene alkyl methacrylate copolymers used in the base polymer can be any<br>
suitable ethylene alkyl methacrylate copolymer with the following properties: the ability to<br>
accept high loadings of conductive carbon filler, elongation of 150 to 250 percent and<br>
sufficient melt strength to maintain its shape after extrusion. The alkyl group can be any alkyl<br>
group selected from the Cl to C6 hydrocarbons, preferably the Cl to C4 hydrocarbons and<br>
even more preferable methyl. Some ethylene alkyl methacrylate copolymers with alkyl<br>
methacrylate levels above about 25 percent and below about 45 percent have these properties.<br>
The ethylene alkyl methacrylate copolymers can have an alkyl methacrylate percentage range<br>
of about 25 to 45 percent. A preferred ethylene alkyl methacrylate copolymer will have an<br>
alkyl methacrylate percentage range of about 28 to 40 percent and an even more preferred<br>
ethylene alkyl methacrylate copolymer will have an alkyl methacrylate percentage of about<br>
28 to 33 percent.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/119067	PCT/US2006/016350<br>
[0029] The ternary copolymers of ethylene with alkyl acrylates and alkyl methacrylates used<br>
in the base polymer can be any suitable ternary copolymer with the following properties: the<br>
ability to accept high loadings of conductive carbon filler, elongation of 150 to 250 percent<br>
and sufficient melt strength to maintain its shape after extrusion. The alkyl group can be any<br>
alkyl group independently selected from the Cl to C6 hydrocarbons, preferably the Cl to C4<br>
hydrocarbons and even more preferable methyl. Usually a ternary copolymer will be<br>
predominantly either an alkyl acrylate with a small portion of an alkyl methacrylate or an<br>
alkyl methacrylate with a small portion of an alkyl acrylate. The proportions of alkyl acrylate<br>
and alkyl methacrylate to ethylene will be about the same as the proportions described for<br>
ethylene alkyl acrylate copolymers or for ethylene alkyl methacrylate copolymers as well as<br>
the molecular weight ranges described for ethylene alkyl acrylate and ethylene alkyl<br>
methacrylate.<br>
[0030] The adhesion modifying additive system comprises at least two components, each of<br>
the adhesion modifying additive system components being different from the base polymer.<br>
The first component comprises a hydrocarbon wax or ethylene vinyl acetate wax and the<br>
second component comprises an amide wax.<br>
[0031] Suitable hydrocarbon waxes and ethylene vinyl acetate waxes for use in the invention<br>
are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 6,274,066 and 6,402,993, the<br>
disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. EPO334992 to Watanabe and U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,150,193 to Burns, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference,<br>
also disclose suitable hydrocarbon waxes and ethylene vinyl acetate waxes for use in the<br>
invention. In preferred embodiments, the semiconductive composition adhesion modifying<br>
additive system has an ethylene vinyl acetate wax having a vinyl acetate content of from<br>
about 10% to about 20% vinyl acetate, more preferably about 14%, and most preferably<br>
about 11%. One of the advantages of the invention is that the more expensive 14% vinyl<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/119067	PCT/US2006/016350<br>
acetate wax can be replaced with the less expensive 11% vinyl acetate wax (in combination<br>
with the amide wax additive component) while still maintaining performance. In other<br>
preferred embodiments the first component additive is an ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) wax<br>
and has a molecular weight from about 15,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons and a vinyl<br>
acetate content of from about 2% to about 28%, preferably from about 10% to about 20%. In<br>
other preferred embodiments, the EVA wax has a molecular weight from about 15,000<br>
Daltons to about 30,000 Daltons and a vinyl acetate content of from about 12% to about 15%.<br>
[0032] The ethylene vinyl acetate wax or hydrocarbon wax is about 0.5 to about 5 weight<br>
percent, based upon the weight of the semiconductive composition, preferably about 1 to<br>
about 3 weight percent, based upon the weight of the semiconductive composition. Mixtures<br>
of ethylene vinyl acetate waxes and/or hydrocarbon waxes may be used as well.<br>
[0033] The amide wax is about 0.5 to about 5 weight percent, based upon the weight of the<br>
semiconductive composition, preferably about 1 to about 3 weight percent, based upon the<br>
weight of the semiconductive composition. Mixtures of amide waxes may be used as well.<br>
[0034] The present invention is based upon the discovery that certain waxes in combination<br>
produce a shield composition having enhanced strippability. The amide waxes of the<br>
invention, i.e., the second component of the additive system, are selected from stearamide,<br>
oleamide, erucamide, ethylene bis-stearamide, ethylene bis-oleamide, ethylene bis-<br>
erucamide, behenamide, oleyl palmitamide, and mixtures thereof. Refined erucamides,<br>
refined oleamides, ethylene bis-stearamide and blends of ethylene bis-stearamide and<br>
ethylene bis-oleamide are preferred.<br>
[0035] In the present invention, commercially available, conventional carbon black is added<br>
to the polymer compositions to impart semi-conductive properties to the composition. The<br>
carbon black added to the polymer may be one of the various available conventional carbon<br>
blacks, including finely divided carbon such as lamp black, furnace black, or acetylene black,<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/119067	PCT/US2006/016350<br>
i.e. carbon black made by pyrolyzing acetylene. Ketjin black may be used in the<br>
compositions of the invention as well as many of the commercial carbon black grades<br>
described in ASTM D 1765 98b, for example, N351, N293 and N550. Preferably, to avoid<br>
problems associated with carbon black dust, the carbon black is pelletized, although non-<br>
pelletized carbon black, such as in its fluffy form, may also be used with equal success. The<br>
carbon black is generally present in the composition in the amount of from about 0.1% to<br>
about 65% by weight of the polymer composition. Preferably the carbon black is present in<br>
an amount of from about 10% to about 50% by weight, based on the weight of the total<br>
composition.<br>
[0036] A tremendous number of compounds have been suggested for use as additives in<br>
semiconducting shield compositions. Typically, these compounds fall into the category of<br>
antioxidants, curing agents, vulcanizing agents, crosslinking agents, boosters and retardants,<br>
processing aids, pigments, dyes, colorants, fillers, coupling agents, ultraviolet absorbers or<br>
stabilizers, antistatic agents, nucleating agents, slip agents, plasticizers, lubricants, viscosity<br>
control agents, tackifiers, anti-blocking agents, surfactants, extender oils, acid scavengers,<br>
and metal deactivators.<br>
[0037] All of the components of the compositions utilized in the invention are usually<br>
blended or compounded together prior to their introduction into an extrusion device from<br>
which they are to be extruded onto an electrical conductor. The polymer and the other<br>
additives and fillers may be blended together by any of the techniques used in the art to blend<br>
and compound such mixtures into homogeneous masses. For instance, the components may<br>
be fluxed on a variety of apparatus including multi-roll mills, screw mills, continuous mixers,<br>
compounding extruders and Banbury mixers.<br>
[0038] After the various components of the composition are uniformly admixed and blended<br>
together, they are further processed to fabricate the cables of the invention. Prior art methods<br>
10<br><br><br>
WO 2006/119067	PCT/US2006/016350<br>
for fabricating polymer insulated cable and wire are well known, and fabrication of the cable<br>
of the invention may generally be accomplished any of the various extrusion methods.<br>
[0039] In a typical production method of, for example, a peroxide cross-linked insulation<br>
layer of a cable, an (optionally) heated conducting core to be coated is pulled through a<br>
heated extrusion die, generally a cross-head die, in which a layer of melted polymer is<br>
applied to the conducting core. Upon exiting the die, the conducting core with the applied<br>
polymer layer is passed through a heated vulcanizing section, or continuous vulcanizing<br>
section where they are completely cross-linked in a short time, and then a cooling section,<br>
generally an elongated cooling bath, to cool. Multiple polymer layers may be applied by<br>
consecutive extrusion steps in which an additional layer is added in each step, or with the<br>
proper type of die, multiple polymer layers may be applied simultaneously. The<br>
semiconductive shield, insulating layer and strippable semiconductive shield are then passed<br>
through a heated vulcanizing section, or continuous vulcanizing section where all three layers<br>
are cross-linked simultaneously and then a cooling section, generally an elongated cooling<br>
bath, to cool. The vulcanizing section is heated as hot as possible without thermally<br>
decomposing the polymer layers of the cable.<br>
[0040] In other production methods for producing a peroxide cross-linked insulation layer of<br>
a cable, the extruded core and polymer layers are passed through a heated salt bath or an<br>
electron beam section where all three layers are cross-linked simultaneously. In yet another<br>
method, the extruded core and polymer layers are passed through a heated bath of lead or<br>
heated lead is extruded over the core and the heat energy in the lead cures the cable in a short<br>
time.<br>
[0041] In contrast, moisture crosslinked cables are typically extruded directly into a<br>
elongated cooling trough and cooled in an uncross-linked state. The process used is the same<br>
as that for the production of a thermoplastic cable that is not cross-linked. The moisture<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/119067	PCT/US2006/016350<br>
cross-linkable cable is then placed in a bath of hot water or in a source of steam, sometimes<br>
referred to as a "sauna", where it slowly cures over time. The rate of cure is dependent on the<br>
thickness and the moisture permeability of the layers of the cable and the type of catalyst<br>
used and can range from several hours to several days. While heat slightly increases the rate<br>
at which water permeates the cable, the temperature must be kept below the melting point of<br>
the outer layer of the cable to prevent it softening and sticking to itself. Because of this<br>
moisture cure is undesirable for cables of higher voltage that require thicker layers of<br>
insulation. The number of water tanks or saunas required becomes too great.<br>
[0042] The conductor of the invention may generally comprise any suitable electrically<br>
conducting material, although generally electrically conducting metals are utilized.<br>
Preferably, the metals utilized are copper or aluminum. In power transmission, aluminum<br>
conductor/steel reinforcement (ACSR) cable, aluminum conductor/aluminum reinforcement<br>
(ACAR) cable, or aluminum cable is generally preferred.<br>
[0043] The weight average molecular weight may be measured by light scattering or by other<br>
conventional means. The number average molecular weight may be measured by osmometry<br>
or by other conventional means. The melting point may be measured based on the melting<br>
point determined from a crystal melting peak obtained using a differential scanning<br>
calorimeter, or by other conventional means.<br>

EXPERIMENTAL<br>
[0044] The compositions described in the examples were made up by the procedure set out<br>
below, and made up into molded plaques measuring 150 mm square by 2 mm thick, one face<br>
being plaques measuring 150 mm square by 2 mm thick, one face being bonded to an XLPE<br>
block of the same dimensions and the two compositions cured together in the press for 20<br>
minutes at 180°C. In each case adhesion was measured by the peel strength tests detailed<br>
below. Identification of ingredients also follows.<br>
[0045] Batches of about 1350 g (3.31b) of each composition were made up using a Farrell<br>
model BR Banbury mixer with a capacity of 1.57 1. All of the ingredients were added to the<br>
Banbury mixer and the ram was lowered. They were then mixed for two minutes at the<br>
middle speed setting. The mixture was discharged, milled into a flat sheet and promptly<br>
molded.<br>
[0046] Plaque samples were tested by cutting completely through the thickness of the layer<br>
of the experimental shield composition in parallel lines to define a strip 12.5 m (1/2 inch)<br>
wide; one end was lifted and turned back 180° to lie along the surface of the portion still<br>
adhered, and the force required to peel at a rate of 0.0085 m/s (20 in/min) measured; peel<br>
strength was calculated in pounds per 1/2 inch.<br>
RESULTS<br>
Comparative Examples A through G shown in Table I are the adhesion results on plaques for<br>
compositions having either having no adhesion modifying additive (A) or a single type of<br>
adhesion modifying additive, such as an EVA wax (B &amp; C), one amide wax (D, E &amp; G), or<br>
combination of two amide waxes (F). It can also be seen that 14% EVA wax yields the best<br>
results in Table I, however as stated above, 14% EVA wax is an expensive material.<br>

Results on Plaques<br><br>
[0047] Examples 1 through 8 shown in Table II are the adhesion results on plaques for<br>
compositions in accordance with the invention. In all instances, the invention is an<br>
improvement over both the performance of the single type of prior art adhesion modifying<br>
additive and an improvement over the cost of the prior art adhesion modifying additives.<br><br>

TABLE II<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Results on Plaques<br><br>
[0048] Comparative Examples H through K shown in Table III are the adhesion results on<br>
plaques for compositions having EVA wax as a single type of adhesion modifying additive.<br>
They clearly demonstrate that increasing the amount of a single type of adhesion modifying<br>
additive above 2.5 weight percent has little or no positive effect. Moreover, at levels of 10<br>
weight per cent, performance dramatically decreases. Thus, Comparative Examples H<br>
through K also show (when compared to Table II) that the two-part strippable additives in<br>
accordance with the invention clearly have a synergistic effect. In particular, the total amount<br>
of adhesion modifying additive in accordance with the invention for Examples 1-6 &amp; 8 is<br>
approximately 7 weight percent, of which approximately 4 weight percent is 11% EVA wax.<br>
The adhesion results for the adhesion modifying additive in accordance with invention are<br>
dramatically improved when compared to the similar amounts of 11% EVA wax shown in<br>
Table III.<br>
