				<td>The present invention in general relates to the means of carrying liquid and gas. Particularly the present invention relates to water and oxygen bottles.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
In the past few years bottled water has become common place. The public has shown willingness to purchase water for the convenience and purity of bottled water. Bottled water is perceived to be relatively free of contaminants and can be placed in coolers, refrigerators, etc. and allow consumers to drink cold clean water almost everywhere without relying on the often dirty warm drinking fountains of the past. This seems to represent a shift in the public attitude towards purchasing something that has traditionally been thought of as “free”.<br>
Additionally, because of pollution, some people living in big cities such as Tokyo and San Francisco are breathing pure oxygen in “oxygen bars” where consumers typically inhale oxygen often mixed with a scent for a per minute fee. Users claim that they feel refreshed and invigorated after inhaling the oxygen. Because the systems used in the oxygen bars to produce the oxygen can often produce contaminants and the addition of some scents can introduce dangerous bacterium into the lungs of a user, some serious health concerns have been raised as being associated with the use of such oxygen bars. Also, in order to benefit from breathing the oxygen, the consumer must visit the bar. There is a need for safe, pure and convenient access to pure oxygen without, the danger or inconvenience associated with visiting an oxygen bar. There are many companies selling breathable pure Oxygen in cans. But they are bulky and very expensive. Also, joggers and other health conscious people find it difficult to carry the Oxygen can in one hand and water bottle in other.<br><br>
It is of course possible to obtain breathable oxygen with a doctor’s prescription, but this is both impractical for majority of the consumers who want to benefit from conveniently being able to breath pure oxygen at their pleasure without the bulk of conventional breathable oxygen cylinders. Additionally, doctors will prescribe oxygen only to patients who need them for diseases such as emphysema, etc. This does not help those who want to breathe pure oxygen for personal reasons.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention proposes a container comprising at least one liquid bottle and one gas chamber. These bottles are held tightly by a sleeve and are meant to carry water and oxygen respectively. Water bottle contains generic cap to open and use the water. The oxygen chamber further comprises a face mask with an inner surface on which a user rests his face to inhale the oxygen. The said mask is connected with the oxygen chamber by a connecting tube and valve. In usef a user ensures that cap of water bottle is secure and presses mask gently allowing oxygen to enter mask. As the user stops pressing mask against water bottle, oxygen stops flowing and the user is free to drink water conventionally from container.<br>
There is a need for a clean, inexpensive and safe manner of dispensing both water and oxygen to any user in one convenient package in order to meet a need for clean water and pure Oxygen and the same is addressed by the invention proposed herein.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention particularly with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1, 2 and 5, a container (shown generally as 100) is shown having a valve 102 and a mask 104. The mask 104 has a cut out portion 112 that fits over a user’s nose (not shown) when used to inhale oxygen. The container 100 consists of a water bottle 106 with an air bottle 110 partially disposed within water bottle 106 and contained within a sleeve 108. Sleeve 108 may completely surround both water bottle 106 and air bottle 110 or may only partially surround the bottles. Sleeve 108 helps hold air bottle 110 in places and gives extra structural support to container 100. Sleeve 108 is made of a suitable insulative material as is known in the art to provide insulative qualities to container 100 to help keep water cool.<br><br>
Mask 104 also functions as a protective cover for container 100 and conceals both water bottle cap 206 and oxygen nozzle 204. Oxygen nozzle 204 has a valve assembly 202 that allows oxygen to flow when valve 102 is fitted into nozzle 204 and depressed. In use, mask 104 is removed form container 100 and valve 102 is placed against nozzle 204. This place mask 104 in a generally horizontal orientation allowing a user to comfortably place mask 104 against face (not shown) and by pressing down on valve 102 oxygen is released allowing user to inhale oxygen. The oxygen stops flowing when valve 102 is released. Any appropriate valve structure will work as is know in the art. A biasing spring (not shown) may be used to provide a normally closed valve function. Mask 104 may be removed from nozzle.204 and used to cover container 100 for later use. Mask 104 may remain in place while a user removes water bottle cap 206 and drinks from the water bottle 106 or the user may temporarily remove mask 104 while drinking.<br>
Oxygen bottle 110 is ideally pressurized at a level that remains safe in the unlikely event of structural failure. Although many materials would be acceptable, PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) Plastics are generally best for this application because PET plastics are clear, tough and are a good barrier to gas and moisture. PET plastics also have very good heat characteristics. A typical PET bottle is designed to withstand pressure of up to 150 psi. The present invention uses oxygen at a pressure well below 150 psi providing a very reliable safety margin. A typical 2 liter carbonated soft drink is pressurized at approximately 35 psi at 45 degrees F.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment a container 300 comprises a water bottle 304 and an oxygen bottle 306. The inner bottles are linearly arranged in a vertical orientation. These inner bottles are held tight with each other using a sleeve 320 which can be made of plastic, rubber or any other material suitable to hold containers/bottles. In this embodiment the upper portion of the container 300 is a water bottle 302 which holds water 304 for drinking. Water 304 may be purified, spring, fortified with trace minerals, distilled etc. as is<br><br>
common in the art. Other liquids such as soda, tea, milk or other liquid beverages may be contained by replacing the water bottle 302 with corresponding upper bottle portion 302. The lower portion of container 300 is an oxygen bottle 306 which contains pressurized oxygen 324 suitable for breathing. Water bottle 302 has a conventional cap 326 used to access water 304. Again, PET plastic is used in this embodiment. A sleeve 320 extends down past the bottom of the water bottle 302 and forms a hollow space which holds an oxygen bottle 306 and the oxygen mask 314. In another embodiment, mask 314 includes a hinged sanitary cover 328 that covers a bottom section of mask 314 so that foreign matter will not contaminate mask 314 when container 300 is set down on an unclean surface. The outer cap 328 conceals the oxygen chamber from the bottom and also forms a natural base for container 300. The said outer container cap can be made of plastic or any other suitable material. In use, a user would simply flip open the hinged cover 328 when breathing oxygen and then close it before setting it back down on a surface.<br>
The said oxygen bottle 306 has an oxygen mask 314 as shown in the figure 6. Like the previous embodiment, mask 314 has a nose cutout portion 316 that allows a user to comfortably press mask 314 against the face (not shown) and breath in* oxygen. Mask 314 is connected to oxygen bottle 306 by a valve 310. Valve 310 includes a central portion (not shown) that is connected to mask 314. A spring (not shown) biases center portion to close against a seal (not shown) such as an O-ring or other sealing means as is known in the art. In use, a user ensures that cap 326 is secure and turns container 300 upside down and presses mask 314 gently allowing oxygen 324 to enter mask 314. As the user stops pressing mask 314 against water bottle 302, oxygen 324 stops flowing and the user is free to drink conventionally from container 300. The outer cap 328 may remain intact while a user uses the water container. Oxygen container 306 is ideally pressurized at a level that remains safe in the unlikely event of structural failure.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4, a container 400 is shown having two oxygen spheres 412 centrally disposed within a water bottle 414. Oxygen spheres 412 are made from any suitable material but again PET plastic is particularly well suited for this<br><br>
application. Although two spheres 412 are shown, other embodiments such as one, three spheres or even a radial arrangement of cylindrical oxygen cells (not shown) would be possible. Container 400 has a mask 402 for breathing oxygen. A user places mouth and nose against mask 402 and presses to start the flow of oxygen. The oxygen is controlled using a valve 422 that is biased with a spring 406. A stepped plunger 408 is provided to control the oxygen flow as it enters mask 402. Any suitable valve structure such as a needle valve or ball valve as is well known in the art could be used to control the flow of oxygen. Valve 422 is enclosed by a PET plastic cone 410 and includes threads 424 which fit into threaded cap 404. Water bottle 414 includes a water outlet 420 secured with a threaded cap 418.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br>
