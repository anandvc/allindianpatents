				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to refrigeration<br>
compressors. More particularly, the present invention relates to a reciprocating<br>
piston type refrigeration compressor which incorporates capacity modulation by<br>
utilization of blocked suction.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Refrigeration and air conditioning systems are commonly<br>
operated under a wide range of loading conditions due to changing<br>
environmental conditions. In order to effectively and efficiently accomplish the<br>
desired cooling under these changing conditions, it is advantageous to<br>
incorporate a system which varies the capacity of the refrigeration compressor in<br>
the system.<br>
[0003] A wide variety of systems have been developed in order to<br>
accomplish capacity modulation. The various types of unloading and capacity<br>
control found in the prior art for refrigeration compressors all have been subject<br>
to 'various drawbacks and/or durability issues. Some of these prior art systems<br>
have operated satisfactorily but they have required a substantial amount of<br>
external tubing or other components which are subject to damage during<br>
shipping and/or possible accidental damage after installation. In addition, the<br>
field labor required in the installation and maintenance of these external systems<br>
is subject to error which creates problems during actual<br>
operation and increases the field labor costs.<br>
{OOO4} Other designs for capacity modulation systems are<br>
installed during the manufacture of the compressor. These designs<br>
have all the major components internal to the compressor itself<br>
except for a single component which is typically the only element<br>
to require servicing during the expectable life of the<br>
compressor. This single external component is constructed such<br>
that it is easily accessible for service while still being<br>
positioned to limit the danger of accidental damage.<br>
US Patent 3,578,883 discloses an unloader for<br>
multicylinder refrigeration compressor which comprises valve<br>
means for closing off the inlet to one or more cylinders<br>
motivated by the fluid pressure discharge of the compressor and<br>
controlled by a solenoid operated servo valve.<br>
{0005} While the prior art internal systems have<br>
proven to operate satisfactorily, there is still a need to<br>
improve both the reliability and durability of these capacity<br>
modulation systems.<br>
{OOO6} The present invention provides the art with a<br>
capacity modulation system which utilizes a piston for blocking<br>
the suction inlet to reduce the capacity of the compressor. The<br>
high-pressure gas which is supplied to the piston during<br>
activation is throttle in order to reduce the piston impact<br>
velocity. The reduction in the piston impact velocity improves<br>
the reliability and durability of the piston, the piston seals<br>
and the piston seat.<br>
{O007} Further areas of applicability of the present<br>
invention will become apparent from the detailed description<br>
provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed<br>
description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0014] The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses.<br>
[0015] Referring now to the drawings in which like reference numerals<br>
designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is<br>
shown in Figure 1 a body or cylinder block portion of a multicylinder refrigeration<br>
compressor in accordance with the present invention and which is designated<br>
generally by the reference numeral 10. Compressor 10 illustrates three<br>
cylindrical banks 12, 14 and 16. Although only cylindrical banks 14 and 16 are<br>
illustrated, it is to be understood that each cylinder bank may contain one, two or<br>
more cylinders and that the construction illustrated typifies known commercial<br>
practice and is merely illustrative insofar as the compressor itself is concerned.<br>
[0016] Each cylinder bank 12, 14 and 16 defines a compression<br>
cylinder 20 within which a piston 22 is slidingly disposed. Cylinder bank 14 is<br>
illustrated with a capacity control system 24 while cylinder bank 16 is illustrated<br>
without capacity control system 24. As detailed below, one or more of cylinder<br>
banks 12, 14 and 16 may include capacity control system 24. Cylinder bank 16<br>
includes a cylinder head 26 which closes cylinder 20 and which defines a suction<br>
chamber 28 and a discharge chamber 30. A suction valve 32 controls the<br>
communication between suction chamber 28 and cylinder 20 and a discharge<br>
valve 34 controls the communication between discharge chamber 30 and<br>
cylinder 20. A suction passage 36 extends between suction chamber 28 and a<br>
common suction chamber (not shown) of compressor 10 which is in turn open to<br>
the inlet of the compressor. Discharge chamber 30 is in communication with the<br>
outlet of compressor 10 through a discharge passage (not shown).<br>
[0017] Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, cylinder bank 14 is illustrated<br>
incorporating capacity control system 24. Capacity control system 24 comprises<br>
a cylinder head 40, a control piston assembly 42 and a solenoid valve assembly<br>
44. Cylinder head 40 closes cylinder 20 and it defines a suction chamber 46 and<br>
a discharge chamber 48. A suction valve 32 controls the, communication<br>
between suction chamber 46 and cylinder 20 and a discharge valve 34 controls<br>
the communication between discharge chamber 48 and cylinder 20. A suction<br>
passage 50 extends between suction chamber 46 and the common suction<br>
chamber of compressor 10. Discharge chamber 30 is in communication with the<br>
outlet of compressor 10 through a discharge passage (not shown). Cylinder<br>
head 40 defines a discharge pressure passage 52 which extends between<br>
discharge chamber 48 and solenoid valve assembly 44, a suction pressure<br>
passage 54 (Figure 2) which extends between suction chamber 46 and solenoid<br>
valve assembly 44 and a control passage 56 which extends between solenoid<br>
valve assembly 44 and a control chamber 58 defined by cylinder head 40.<br>
[0018] Control piston assembly 42 is slidingly disposed within control<br>
chamber 58 and it comprises a valve body or piston 60 and a biasing spring 62.<br>
Piston 60 is slidingly disposed within control chamber 58 with a seal disposed<br>
between piston 60 and control chamber 58. Biasing spring 62 is disposed<br>
between piston 60 and cylinder bank 14 with a seal 64 attached to piston 60.<br>
Seal 64 engages cylinder bank 14 to block suction passage 50 when piston<br>
assembly 42 is in its closed position. Biasing spring 62 urges piston assembly 42<br>
into an open position.<br>
[0019] Solenoid valve assembly 44 comprises a valve block 66 and a<br>
solenoid valve 68. Valve block 66 is secured to cylinder head 40 and it defines a<br>
discharge control passage 70 in communication with discharge pressure<br>
passage 52, a suction control passage 72 in communication with suction<br>
pressure passage 54 and a common control passage 74 in communication with<br>
control passage 56. A discharge valve seat 76 is disposed between discharge<br>
control passage 70 and common control passage 74 and a suction valve seat 78<br>
is disposed between suction control passage 72 and common control passage<br>
74.<br>
[0020] Solenoid valve 68 includes a solenoid coil 80 and a needle<br>
valve 82. Needle valve 82 is disposed between valve seats 76 and 78 and<br>
moves between a first position and a second position. In its first position,<br>
communication between discharge control passage 70 and common control<br>
passage 74 is blocked but communication between suction control passage 72<br>
and common control passage 74 is permitted. In its second position,<br>
communication between discharge control passage 70 and common control<br>
passage 74 is permitted but communication between suction control passage 72<br>
and common control passage 74 is prohibited. Needle valve 82 and thus<br>
solenoid valve 68 is normally biased into its first position by a biasing member 84<br>
which allows full capacity for compressor 10. Activation of solenoid coil 80<br>
moves needle valve 82 and thus solenoid valve 68 to its second position which<br>
results in operation of compressor 10 at a reduced capacity.<br>
[0021] Referring now to Figure 2, capacity control system 24 is<br>
illustrated in its full capacity or first position. In this position, solenoid coil 80 is<br>
de-energized and needle valve 82 is biased against discharge valve seat 76.<br>
The biasing of needle valve 82 against discharge valve seat 76 closes discharge<br>
control passage 70 and opens suction control passage 72. Thus, control<br>
chamber 58 is in communication with the common suction chamber of<br>
compressor 10 through common control passage 74, suction valve seat 78,<br>
suction control passage 72 and suction pressure passage 54. Fluid at suction<br>
pressure reacts against both the upper and lower surfaces of piston 60 and<br>
piston 60 is urged away from cylinder bank 14 by biasing spring 62. The<br>
movement of piston 60 away from cylinder bank 14 places suction passage 50 in<br>
communication with suction chamber 46 allowing for the free flow of suction gas<br>
and the full capacity operation of cylinder bank 14.<br>
[0022] Referring now to Figure 3, capacity control system 24 is<br>
illustrated in its reduced capacity or second position. In this position, solenoid<br>
coil 80 is energized and needle valve 82 is biased against suction valve seat 78.<br>
The biasing of needle valve 82 against suction valve seat 78 closes suction<br>
control passage 72 and opens discharge control passage 70. Thus, control<br>
chamber 58 is in communication with discharge pressure from the outlet of<br>
compressor 10 through common control passage 74, discharge valve seat 76,<br>
discharge control passage 70 and discharge pressure passage 52. Fluid at<br>
discharge pressure reacts against the upper surface of piston 60 to urge piston<br>
60 into engagement with cylinder bank 14 against the force produced by biasing<br>
spring 62. The engagement of piston 60 and seal 64 with cylinder bank 14<br>
closes suction passage 50 which blocks fluid at suction pressure from entering<br>
suction chamber 46. The capacity of cylinder bank 14 is essentially reduced to<br>
zero. Discharge control passage 70 is provided with an orifice 90 which limits the<br>
flow of fluid at discharge pressure from control passage 70 to control chamber<br>
58. By limiting the flow of fluid at discharge pressure into control chamber 58,<br>
the velocity of piston 60 is reduced which then diminishes the impact force<br>
between piston 60 and cylinder bank 14. The diminishing of the impact force<br>
reduces damage and wear on piston 60, seal 62 and the seat on cylinder bank<br>
14. This, in turn, significantly improves the reliability of compressor 10.<br>
[0023] In the preferred embodiment, piston 60 has a diameter of<br>
approximately one inch and a stroke of approximately 0.310 inches. With these<br>
dimensions, the preferred diameter for orifice 90 is between 0.020 inches and<br>
0.060 inches and more preferably between .030 inches and .050 inches.<br>
[0024] While the present invention is described as having only cylinder<br>
bank 14 incorporating capacity control system 24, it is within the scope of the<br>
present invention to include capacity control system 24 on more than one<br>
cylinder bank but not all of the cylinder blocks because discharge pressurized<br>
fluid is required for the movement of piston 60. With the present invention having<br>
three cylinder banks, the incorporation of one capacity control system allows the<br>
capacity of compressor 10 to vary between 2/3 capacity and full capacity. The<br>
incorporation of two capacity control systems 24 allows the capacity of<br>
compressor 10 to vary between 1/3 capacity and full capacity.<br>
[0025] Solenoid coil 80 is described as being de-energized to place<br>
needle valve 82 in a first position which provides full capacity and as being<br>
energized to place needle valve 82 in a second position which provides reduced<br>
capacity. It is within the scope of the present invention to operate solenoid coil<br>
80 in a pulsed width modulation mode in order to provide an infinitesimal number<br>
of capacities between the fully reduced capacity and the full capacity. In this<br>
manner and by incorporating capacity control system 24 on two of the cylinder<br>
blocks, the capacity of compressor 10 can be selected at any capacity between<br>
1/3 capacity and full capacity.<br>
[0026] Referring now to Figures 4 and 5, a capacity control system 124<br>
is illustrated. Capacity control system 124 is the same as capacity control<br>
system 24 except that orifice 90 has been relocated from discharge control<br>
passage 70 to a gasket 92 disposed between cylinder head 40 and valve block<br>
66. The operation and function of capacity control system 124 is identical to that<br>
described above for capacity control system 24. Figure 4 illustrates capacity<br>
control system 124 at full capacity and Figure 5 illustrates capacity control<br>
system 124 at reduced capacity.<br>
[0027] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended<br>
to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as<br>
a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
