Section 10<br>
A heterocyclic substituted aminoazacylces<br>
Abbott Laboratories, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of USA, of Dept. 377 BIdg Ap6A-1,100 Abbott Park Road, Abbott Park, Illinois 60064-6008 USA.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be<br>
performed:	<br><br>
HETEROCYCLIC SUBSTITUTED AMINOAZACYCLES USEFUL AS CENTRAL<br>
NERVOUS SYSTEM AGENTS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention is directed to a series of heterocyclic substituted aminoazacycles, a method for selectively controlling neurotransmitter release in mammals using these compounds, and pharmaceutical compositions including those compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Compounds that selectively control chemical synaptic transmission offer therapeutic utility in treating disorders that are associated with dysfunctions in synaptic transmission. This utility may arise from controlling either pre-synaptic or post-synaptic chemical transmission. The control of synaptic chemical transmission is, in turn, a direct result of a modulation of the excitability of the synaptic membrane. Presynaptic control of membrane excitability results from the direct effect an active compound has upon the organelles and enzymes present in the nerve terminal for synthesizing, storing, and releasing the neurotransmitter, as well as the process for active re-uptake. Postsynaptic control of membrane excitability results from the influence an active compound has upon the cytoplasmic organelles that respond to neurotransmitter action.<br>
An explanation of the processes involved in chemical synaptic transmission will help to illustrate more fully the potential applications of the invention. (For a fuller explanation of chemical synaptic transmission refer to Hoffman et al., "Neuro-transmission: The autonomic and somatic motor nervous systems." In: Goodman and Gilman's, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th ed., J.G. Hardman, L.E. Limbird, P3. Molinoff, R.W. Ruddon, and A. Goodman Gilman, eds., Pergamon Press, New York, (1996), pp. 105-139).<br>
Typically, chemical synaptic transmission begins with a stimulus that depolarizes the transmembrane potential of the synaptic junction above the threshold that elicits an all-or-<br><br>
none action potential in a nerve axon. The action potential propagates to the nerve terminal where ion fluxes activate a mobilization process leading to neurotransmitter secretion and "transmission" to the postsynaptic cell. Those cells which receive communication from the central and peripheral nervous systems in the form of neurotransmitters are referred to as "excitabie cells." Excitable cells are cells such as nerves, smooth muscle cells, cardiac cells and glands. The effect of a neurotransmitter upon an excitable cell may be to cause either an excitatory or an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (EPSP or IPSP, respectively) depending upon the nature of the postsynaptic receptor for the particular neurotransmitter and the extent to which other neurotransmitters are present. Whether a particular neurotransmitter causes excitation or inhibition depends principally on the ionic channels that are opened in the postsynaptic membrane (i.e., in the excitable cell).<br>
EPSPs typically result from a local depolarization of the membrane due to a generalized increased permeability to cations (notably Na+ and K+), whereas IPSPs are the result of stabilization or hyperpolarization of the membrane excitability due to a increase in permeability :o primarily smaller ions (including K+ and Cl+). For example, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine excites at skeletal muscle junctions by opening permeability channels for Na and K., At other synapses, such as cardiac cells, acetylcholine can be inhibitor.'. primarily resulting from an increase in K+ conductance.<br>
The biological effects of the compounds of the present invention result from moduiation of a particular subtype of acetylcholine receptor. It is, therefore, important to undersold the differences between two receptor subtypes. The two distinct subfamilies of acetylcholine receptors are defined as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. (See Goodman and Oilman's, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. op. cit.).<br>
The responses of these receptor subtypes are mediated by two entirely different classes of second messenger systems. When the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is activated, the response is an increased flux of specific extracellular ions (e.g. Na+, K+ and Ca++) through the neuronal membrane. In contrast, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation leads to changes in intracellular systems that contain complex molecules such as G-proteins and<br><br>
inositol phosphates. Thus, the biological consequences of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activation are distinct from those of muscarinic receptor activation. In an analogous manner, inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors results in still other biological effects, which are distinct and different from those arising from muscarinic receptor inhibition<br>
As indicated above, the two principal sites to which drug compounds that affect chemical synaptic transmission may be directed are the presynaptic membrane and the post¬synaptic membrane. Actions of drugs directed to the presynaptic site may be mediated through presynaptic receptors that respond to the neurotransmitter which the same secreting structure has released (i.e., through an autoreceptor), or through a presynaptic receptor that responds to another neurotransmitter (i.e., through a heteroreceptor). Actions of drugs directed to the postsynaptic membrane mimic the action of the endogenous neurotransmitter or inhibit the interaction of the endogenous neurotransmitter with a postsynaptic receptor.<br>
Classic examples of drugs that modulate postsynaptic membrane excitability are the neuromuscular blocking agents which interact with nicotinic acetylcholine-gated channel receptors on skeletal muscle, for example, competitive (stabilizing) agents, such as curare, or depolarizing agents, such as succinylcholine.<br>
In the central nervous system (CNS), postsynaptic cells can have many neurotransmitters impinging upon them. This makes it difficult to know the precise net balance of chemical synaptic transmission required to control a given cell. Nonetheless, by designing compounds that selectively affect only one pre- or postsynaptic receptor, it is possible to modulate the net balance of all the other inputs. Obviously, the more that is understood about chemical synaptic transmission in CNS disorders, the easier it would be to design drugs to treat such disorders.<br>
Knowing how specific neurotransmitters act in the CNS allows one to predict the disorders that may be treatable with certain CNS active drugs. For example, dopamine is widely recognized as an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous systems in humans and animals. Many aspects of the pharmacology of dopamine have been reviewed by Roth and Elsworth, "Biochemical Pharmacology of Midbrain Dopamine Neurons", In: Psychopharmacology: The Fourth Generation of Progress, F.E. Bloom and D.J. Kupfer, Eds.,<br><br>
Raven Press, NY, 1995, pp 227-243). Patients with Parkinson's disease have a primary loss of dopamine containing neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway, which results in profound loss of motor control. Therapeutic strategies to replace the dopamine deficiency with dopamine mimetics, as well as administering pharmacologic agents that modify dopamine release and other neurotransmitters have been found to have therapeutic benefit ("Parkinson's Disease", In: Psychopharmacology: The Fourth Generation of Progress, op. cit., pp 1479-1484).<br>
New and selective neurotransmitter controlling agents are still being sought, in the hope that one or more will be useful in important, but as yet poorly controlled, disease states or behavior models. For example, dementia, such as is seen with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinsonism, remains largely untreatable. Symptoms of chronic alcoholism and nicotine withdrawal involve aspects of the central nervous system, as does the behavioral disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Specific agents for treatment of these and related disorders are few in number or nonexistent.<br>
A more complete discussion of the possible utility as CNS active agents of compounds with activity as cholinergic ligands selective for neuronal nicotinic receptors, (i.e., for controlling chemical synaptic transmission) may be found in U.S. Patent 5,472,958, to Gunn et al., issued Dec. 5,1995, the disclosure of is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Existing acetylcholine agonists are therapeutically suboptimal in treating the conditions discussed above. For example, such compounds have unfavorable pharmacokinetics (e.g., arecoline and nicotine), poor potency and lack of selectivity (e.g., nicotine), poor CNS penetration (e.g., carbachol) or poor oral bioavailability (e.g., nicotine). In addition, other agents have many unwanted central agonist actions, including hypothermia, hypolocomotion and tremor and peripheral side effects, including miosis, lachrymation, defecation and tachycardia (Benowitz et al., in: Nicotine Psychopharmacology, S. Wonnacott, M.A.H. Russell, &amp; LP. Stolerman, eds., Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1990, pp. 112-157; and M. Davidson, et al., in Current Research in Alzheimer Therapy, E. Giacobini and R. Becker, ed.; Taylor &amp; Francis: New York, 1988; pp 333-336).<br>
Williams et al. reports the use of cholinergic channel modulators to treat Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases (M. Williams et al., "Beyond the Tobacco Debate: Dissecting Out<br><br>
the Therapeutic Potential of Nicotine", Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs 5. pp. 1035-1045 (1996). Salin-Pascual et al. reports short-term improvement of nonsmoking patients suffering from depression by treatment with nicotine patches (R. J.Salin-Pascual et al., "Antidepressant Effect of Transdermal Nicotine Patches in Non-Smoking Patients with Major Depression", J. Clin. Psychiatry, v. 57 pp. 387-389 (1996).<br>
Various 2-pyridines substituted with a 4-aminopiperidine have been disclose by (US 5,604,245) as serotoninergic agonists. Certain pyridazines substituted with an azacycle have been disclosed by (EP 156433B1) as anti-viral agents. Azacyclic pyridazines of the present invention are distinct in that the azacycle is substituted with an alkylamino or dialkylamino substituenL Pyrrolidine and azetidine azacycles substituted at the 3-position have been disclosed (cf. U.S. Patents 4,592,866 to A.D. Cale; 4,705,853 to A.D. Cale; 4,956359 to Taylor et al.; and 5,037,841 to Schoehe et al. and European patent application EP296560A2, to Sugimoto ex al.).<br>
Certain nicotine related compounds having utility in enhancing cognitive function have been reported by Lin in U.S. Patent 5,278,176, issued Jan. 11,1994. Also, 2-(mtrophenoxymethyl)heterocyclic compounds with similar function have been reported by Gunn et al., U.S. Patent 5,472,958, issued Dec. 5, 1995.<br>
Certain (pyrid-3-yIoxymethyI)heterocyclic compounds useful in controlling chemical synaptic transmission have been'described by Lin et al. in U.S. Patent 5,629,325, issued May 13,1997.<br>
WO 94/08922 describes pyridyl ether compounds which enhance cognitive function. U.S. patent applications 08/474,873 and 08/485,537 describe certain substituted pyridyl ether compounds as well as other compounds which also act at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to stimulate or inhibit neurotransmitter release. WO 96/31475 describes certain 3-substituted pyridine derivatives which are described as being useful for a variety of disorders as modulators of acetylcholine receptors. While some of these references have alluded to pain control as a potential use of the compounds or analogs recited therein, the Applicants have discovered that compounds of formula I shown below have a surprising and unexpected analgesic effect<br><br>
In addition, cholinergic channel modulators may be useful in treating pain. The search for more potent and more effective pain controllers or analgesics continues to be a significant research goal in the medical community. A substantial number of medical disorders and conditions produce pain as part of the disorder or condition. Relief of this pain is a major aspect of ameliorating or treating the overall disease or condition. Pain and the possible allievation thereof is also attributable to the individual patient's mental condition and physical condition. One pain reliever, or a class, may not be effective for a particular patient, or group of patients, which leads to a need for finding additional compounds or pharmaceuticals which are effective analgesics. Opioid and non-opioid drugs are the two major classes of analgesics (Dray, A. and Urban, L.. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 36: 253-280,1996). Opioids, such as morphine, act at opioid receptors in the brain to block transmission of the pain signals in the brain and spinal cord (Chemey, NX, Drug, 51:713-737,1996). Opioids such as morphine have abuse and addiction liability. Non-opioids such as non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents (NSAlDs) typically, but not exclusively, block the production of prostaglandins to prevent sensitization of nerve endings that facilitate the pain signal to the brain (Dray, et al, Trends in Pharmacol. 5ci.r 15: 190-197,1994.; Carty, T.J. and Marfat, A., COX-2 Inhibitors. Potential for reducing NSAID side-effects in treating inflammatory diseases", In: Emerging Drugs: Prospect for Improved Medicines. (W. C. Bowman, J.D. Fitzgerald, and J.B. Taylor, eds.), Ashley Publications Ltd., London. Chap. 19., pp. 391411). Most of the commonly prescribed over-the-counter (OTC) NSAlDs are also commonly associated with at least one side effect or another, such as stomach ulceration or pain. For example, NSAlDs such as aspirin are also known to cause irritation and ulceration of the stomach and duodenum.<br>
Certain compounds, with primary therapeutic indications other than analgesia, have been shown to be effective in some types of pain control. These are classified as analgesic adjuvants, and include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and some anticonvulsants such as gabapentin (Williams et al., J. Med. Chem. (1999), 42,1481-1500). The exact mechanism of action of these drugs is not fully understood, but they are used increasingly for treatment, especially for pain resulting from nerve injury due to trauma, radiation, or disease.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention are novel and may have utility in treating disorders and medical conditions listed herein. The compounds of the present invention may also have utility when administered in combination with an opioid such as morphine, or a non-steroid anti-inflammatory agent such as aspirin, or a tricyclic antidepressant, or an anticonvulsant such as gabapentin or pregabalin for treating disorders and medical conditions listed herein.<br>

In Vitro Data Determination of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Binding Potencies Compounds of the invention were subjected to in vitro assays against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor as described below and were found to be effective binders to the 25     receptor. The In Vitro protocols for determination of nicotinic acetylcholine channel receptor binding potencies of ligands were determined as follows.<br>
Binding of [3H]-cytisine ([3H]-CYT) to neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors was accomplished using crude synaptic membrane preparations from whole rat brain (Pabreza et al., Molecular Pharmacol., 1990, 39.9). Washed membranes were stored at -SO 800C prior to<br><br>
use. hrozen aliquots were slowly thawed and resuspended in 20 volumes of buffer (containing: 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl,2 mM MgCl2,2 mM CaCI2 and 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 @.4 °C). .After centrifuging at 20.000x g for 15 minutes, the pellets were resuspended in 30 volumes of buffer.<br>
The test compounds were dissolved in water to make 10 mM stock solutions. Each solution was then diluted (1:100) with buffer (as above) and further taken through seven serial log dilutions to produce test solutions from 10"5 to 10"11 M.<br>
Homogenate (containing 125-150 ug protein) was added to triplicate tubes containing the range of concentrations of test compound described above and [3H]-CYT (1.25 nM) in a final volume of 500 uL. Samples were incubated for 60 minutes at 4 °C, then rapidly filtered through Whatman GF/B filters presoaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine using 3 x 4 mL of ice-cold buffer. The filters are counted in 4 mL of Ecolume® (ICN). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM (-)-nicotine and values were expressed as a percentage cf total binding. IC50 values were determined with the RS-1 (BBN) nonlinear least squares curve-fitting program and IC50 values were converted to Ki values using the Cheng and Prusoff correction (K1=IC5o(1÷[ligand]/Kd of ligand).<br>
The results are detailed in Table I.<br>

In Vivo Data Determination of Effectiveness of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Ligands as Analgesic<br>
Agents in the Mouse Hot Plate Paradigm<br>
An in vivo protocol was utilized to determine the effectiveness of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligands as analgesic agents in the mouse hot plate paradigm.<br>
Separate groups of mice, (n=8/group) were utilized for each dose group. All drugs were administered by the intraperitoneal route of administration. Test drugs were dissolved in water to make a 6.2 mM stock solution. Animals were dosed with this solution (10 mL/kg body weight) for a 62 micromol/kg dose. Lower doses were administered similarly, following serial dilution of the stock solution in half-log increments. Animals were dosed 30 minutes prior to testing in the hot plate. The hot-plate utilized was an automated analgesia monitor (Model #AHP16AN, Omnitech Electronics, Inc. of Columbus, Ohio). The temperature of the hot plate was maintained at 55 °C and a cut-off time of 180 seconds was utilized. Latency until the tenth jump was recorded as the dependent measure. An increase in the tenth jump latency relative to the control was considered an effect.<br>
Table 2 shows the minimally effective dose (MED), among the doses tested, at which<br><br>
a significant effect, as defined above, was observed for the present compounds. The data shows that selected compounds of the invention show a significant antinociceptive effect at doses ranging from 0.62 to 62 umol/kg.<br><br><br><br>
Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound is mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives, buffers or propellants which can be required. Opthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.<br>
Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active compound(s) which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, compositions and mode of administration. The selected dosage level will depend upon the activity of the particular compound the route of administration, the severity of the condition being treated and the condition and prior medical history of the patient being treated. However, it is within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required for to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.<br>
When used in the above or other treatments, a therapeutically effective amount of one of the compounds of the present invention can be employed in pure form or, where such forms exist, in pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug form. Alternatively, the compound can be administered as a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound of interest in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" of the compound of the invention means a sufficient<br><br>
amount of the compound to treat disorders, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgement. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient: the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental '-vith the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.<br>
The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a human or lower animal may range from about 0.001 to about 1000 mg/kg/day. For purposes of oral administration, more preferable doses can be in the range of from about 0.001 to about 5 mg/kg/day. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration; consequently, single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submulupies thereof to make up the daily dose.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions that comprise compounds of the present invention formulated together with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutical!)' acceptable carriers. The pharmaceutical compositions can be specially formulated for cral administration in solid or liquid form, for parenteral injection or for rectal administration.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other mammals orally, rectally, parenterally , intracistemally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term "parenterally," as used herein, refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrastemai, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and<br><br>
infusion.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like), vegetable oils (such as olive oil), injectable organic esters (such as ethyl oleate) and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.<br>
These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chiorobutanol. phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This can be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.<br>
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and<br><br>
poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in iiposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.<br>
Tne Injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteriai-reiair.ing filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be mixed with at least one inert, phannaceuticaliy acceptable excipient or carrier, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol and silicic acid: b) binders such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia; c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates and sodium carbonate; e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; g) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate and mixtures thereof.
