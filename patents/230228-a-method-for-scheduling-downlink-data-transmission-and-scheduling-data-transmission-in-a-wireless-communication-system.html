BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
11001] I'he preiient invention relates generally to data communication, and more j;]&gt;eci{i';ally i:C' techniques for allocating downlink resources in a multiple-input multiple-ijutput (MINEC)) communication system.<br>
;3ack]j round<br>
11002J W:ir;5less communication :jyj;tems arc widely deployed to provide various i)^es Cff communication such as voice, data, and so on, for a number of users. These systems ma} lie based on code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDM\), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), or some other multiple access; techniques.<br>
11003j A, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system employs JtLultipJe (Ni) transmit antsnnas and multiple (NK) receive jintennas for transmission of multiple ind2]:&gt;e:ndent data streams. In one conmion MIMC' system implementation, of the data streamij are transmitted to a single terminal at any given time all. However, a jriultiple access coromunication system having a base station with multiple antennas may aho coiicurrendy communicate with a number of terminals. In tiiis case, the base station employs a number of antemias and each terminal employs NR antennas to leceive one or more of the multiple data streams.<br>
11,004] The connectio:^ between a multiple-antenna base station and a single multiple-anti^rma teiminal is called a MIMO channel. A MIMO channel formed by these MT trari;i;mit and NR receive anr,ennas may be decomposed into Nc independent channels, with Nc ^ min {NT. NR}. Each of the Nc i.n<iependent channels is also teferr to a: a spatial subchannel of the mimo ch-annel and corresponds climension. system can provide improved performance increased></iependent><br>

SUMMARY<br>
"1007] /liipects of the invention provide techniques to increase the downlink &gt;erfonaanc€: of a wireless communication system. In an aspect, data may- be lansmitted fio3 a base station to one or more terminds using one of a number of diffennt optnating modes. In a MIMO mode, all available downlink data streams are illocatjd to a single terminal that employs multiple antennas (i.e., a MIMO terminal). ji an N-SIMO mode, a single data stream is allocated to each of a number of distinct erminiils, with each terminal employing multiple antennas (i.e., SIMO terminals). And :n a niJted-niD-de, the dov/nlink resources may be allocated to a combination of SIMO itid MMO '.errtiinals, with both type^. of terminals being simultaneously supported. By 'lansmitting data simultaneously to multiple SIMO terminals, one or more MIMO ierminjds, or a combination therecf, the tmnsmission capacity of the system is increased.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIFIION<br>
[1023] FIG. 1 is a diagram of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communicaten system ICO that may be designed and operated to implement various cspects and embodiments of die invention. MEMO system 100 employs multiple (NT) ininsnriit anti5r]ji.2;s and multiple (NR) receive antennas for data transmission. MIMO sj-stem 100 is effectively formed for a multiple access coroinunication system having a c-ase stiition QiS) 104 that can concuiTcntly communicate &gt;vith a number of terminals [T) 106. In tliis case, base station 104 employs multiple antennas and represents tlie ::iultipli5-input (MI) for downlink transmissions from the base station to the terminals. [1024] A siet of one or more "conmunicating" terminals 106 collectively represents iJi5   multiph;-output   (MO)   for  downlink   transmissions.      As   used   herein,   a<br><br>
comiiiunicaung lenmnai is one mat receives user-speciT:ic aaia rrora uie case siauon, ind an "activ'«,;" tenninal is one that desires data transiTiission in an upcoming or future lansniissior interval. Active terrainjds may include terminals that are currently i;omir:unicatirg.<br>
11025] Ml^'IO system 100 may be designed to implement any number of standairds itnid designs ibr CDMA, 'TDMA, FDMA, and other multiple access techniques. The CDNLfi. standards include tlie IS-95, (xima2000, and W-CDMA standards, and the TDNL^. standards includt; the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) :;l:and£ud. Thtse standards are known in the art and inco:rporated herein by reference. [1026] ISCIMO system. 100 may b

Tcnrlaals 106e through lOfh may receive pilot references and other signaling irioraxition from base station 104 (as indicated by the dashed lines), but are not itceiving us<ir-si data from the base station.></ir-si>
11028] Eadi terminal 106 in MIMO system 100 employs NR antennas for reception o:: one or more data streams. Generally, the number of antennas at each terminal is ujual to or greater than the number of data streams transmitted by the base station. However, the tJJttninals in the system need not all be equipped with equal number of i€ceiv2 antennas.<br>
11029] FQ:r.MIMO system 100, the number of antentiai; at each of the terminals (NR) is typically g::iiiU:er than or equal to the number of antennas at the base station (NT). In this caie, for the downlini:, the numb€;r of spatial subchannels is limited by the number of trariimit anxnnas at the base station. Each transmit anienna may be used to send an<br><br>
iadependeni: data stream that may be coded and modulated based on a scheme supported by tht spatial !;ubcharmel associated with the MIMO channel between the base station and tli'j selei;i.e(J terminal<br>
[1030] i\ ;{3ejcts of the invention provide lecl-miques to increase the performance of a v;irele&gt;s communication system. These techniques may be advantageously used to increase the ii
[1032] la another aspect, scheduling schemes are provided to schedule data transirissions to active terminals. A scheduler selects tlie best operating mode to use based on v.;irious factors such as, for example, the services being requested by the ujrrmnals. In addition, the scheduler can perform an additional level of optimization by s^lcctiig a i^jorlicular set of terminals for simultaneous dati transmission and assigning tlie a.\ailable transmit antennas to die selected terminals such that high system perfonnance and otiier requirements are achieved. Several scheduling schemes and antenna assignment schemes are described in further detail [)eIow. [1033] ^Vith MMO, multiple independent data streiuiis may be transmitted from the base siation via multiple transmit antennas to one or mote scheduled terminals. If the propagation environment has sufficient scattering,. MIMO receiver processing :echn];([ues riiiy be used at the terminals to efficiently exploit the spatial dimeriiiionalities of the IvUMO chaiinel to increase triinsmission capacit}'. MIMO ::^K:eivc:r procisiJJting techniques may be used when the bai;e station is communicating Alth multiple: ajrminals simultaneously.   From the terminal's perspective, the same<br><br>
r5ceiv(5r prooi^ssing techniques may be used to process Nj different signals intended for rliat termins.l (i^.g., a single MIMO terminal) or just one of the Nr signals (i.e., SIMO terminals).<br>
[1034] A.:; shovm in HG. 1, the tenninais may he i-andomly distributetl in the base station's coverage jjrea (or "cell") or may be co-located-. For a wireless communication systeir., the iialc ch;iracteristics typically vary over time due to a number of factors such as fading am:! ]:nult:path. At a particular instant in time, tl:,e channel response between ilie base statjoii's aiTay of Kj transmit antennas and the NR receive antennas for a single terminal ma]/ be characterized by a matrix H v/hose elements are composed of independent (j;iijssian random variables, as follows:<br><br>
tf/here; H is 1J)S channel rei^onse matrix for the terminal, £jid hij is the coupling between tlie baie station's f-th transmit antenna and the tcrminal'sy-th receive antenna. [1035]      i'u. shov^-n in equation (1), the channel estimates for each terminal may be r»;prest:nted v-'idi a matrix, having N^-xN^ elements corresponding to the number of<br>
ti'ansrnit antennas at the base station and the number of receive antennas at the tenninal. Elach clement of the matrix H describes the response for a respective transmit-receive antenna paL* between the base station and one terminal. For simplicity, equation (1) jescril'cs a channel characterization based on a flat fading charmel model (i.e., one ■:omp"l<a vaue for the en system bandwidth in an actual operating environment he chinnel may be frequency selective channel response varies across jystern bandi and a more detailed charactotz used each jlemert of tie matrix h include set values different subchannels time delay></a>
1036] The active terminals in the MEMO system periodically estimate the channel :-cspon5e for each transmit-receive antenna pair. The channel estimates may be "acilitated in a number of ways such as, for example, with the use of pilot and/or data ilecisicn directed techniques known in tlie art. The channel estimates may comprise the complex-value channel response estjfnate for each triinsmit-receive anteima pair, as<br><br>
jescribed ahovij in equation (1). The channel estimateis give infomiation on the 3*ansrnissiori characteristios of each of the spatial sub:;hafinels, i.e., what data rate is suppC'itable on each subchannel with a given set oi' li^uismission parameters. The information jpven by tlie channel estimates may be distilled into a post-processed 5tgna]-to-noise ]?lu5.-interfsrence ratio (SNR) estimate for each spatial subchannel (described bo!x^^v), i^r some other statistic that allows the Ixajismitter to select the proper tiansrnissioii piiranaeters for that spatial subchannel. Typically, this process of Jerivation of the essential statistic reduces the amount of d£ta required to characterize a :hannel. I:Q eittier cai;e, this infonnation represents one form of channel state iuforraation [CSI) that may be repon:ed to the base station. Other forms of CSI may ilso be repoite«J and are described below.<br>
[1037] The aggregate CSI received from the collection of terminals may be used to [1) selsct a ""best" set of one or more terminals for data transmission, (2) assign the ivailaWe transrrdt antennas to the sekx:ted terminals in the set, and (3) select the proper :Dding and modulation scheme for each transmit antenna. With the available CSI, /arioui; scheduling schemes may be designed to maximize tlie downlink performance by ivaluiiing vv'Iiich specific combination of tenninals and antenna assignm^ints provide he best syitsin performance (e.g., the highest throughput) subject to any system oonstrzints and requirements. By exploiting the spatial (and possibly frequency) 'signaiures" of the individual active terminals (i.e., their channel estimates), the average down'tink thxiughput can l)e increased.<br>
;i0381 Ttic terminals may be scheduled for data trarsmission based on various "actors. One -set of factors may relate to system constraints imd requirements such as the iesirec. quality of service (QoS), max:imum latency, average data rate, and so on. Some or all of the.-!!5 factors may need to te satisfied on a per terminal basis (i.e., for each 'erminid) in u multiple access commuiiication system. Another set of factors may relate 10 system pc:rrain3ance, which may b
110391 The scheduling schemes can be designed to select the best set of terminals for si:3iultaneous data transmission on the available tiransnaission channels such that iiystem perfomiance is maximized while conforming to the system constraints and resquirsmentii. Por simplicity, various aspects of the invention are described below for a<br><br>
jvtnvKJ sysi.em without OFDM in which one indeptMident data stream may be iransxnitted by the base station fron} each transmit aji:eiina. In this case, (up to) NT •ndep NT-<br>
110401 for simplicity, the number of receive antennas in assumed to be equal to the numtHi: of ti aa:;:rait antennas (i.e., NR = NT) for much of thci description below. This is not a nscessaiy coniiition since all of the analysis applies for the case where NR ^ NT-11041] S::heduling of data transn:isi;ion on the dov/nhnk comprises two parts: (1) iielection of ont or more sets of tenninals for evaluation, and (2) assignment of the available trajHrtdt fintennas to the teiminals in each set. All or only a subset of the active terminals; may be considere<l for scheduling find these terminals may be combired to form one or more sets hypotheses evaluated. each the available transmit antennas can assigned in l. en any of a number antenna assignment schemes. terminijs best hypothesis then scheduled data transmission an ii irlerval. flexibility both selecting set iransm: ssion tie transniitted selected tenninals dlows>»:heduler to optimize ])eiformance by exploiting muhi-user diversity snvirorment.<br>
[1042] Li order to determine the "optimum" transmission to a set of terminals, the DNRs or soric other sufficient statistics are provided for each terminal and each spatial :ubcha'ineL If die statistic is the SNR. then for each set of t-^rminals to be evaluated for :iita transmiiisicii in an upcoming transmission interval, a h^^othesis matrix T of "post-C'locessed'* SMls (defined below) for this terminal set may be expressed as:<br><br>
7/here y^j is trie post-prc»cessed SNR for a data stream (hypothetically) transmitted ;'-om til 3 /~th uansmit antenna to the;-th teraiinal.<br><br>
;1043] In tlis; N-SIMC&gt; mode, the Nr rows in the h&gt;'pot]iesis matrix T correspond to &gt;rT vectors of SNl^s from NT different temoiiials. m t!iis mode, each row in the lypotbesis riiiitrix T gives tlic SNR of each transmit data stream for one tenninal. And II the nixed-ai(xle. for a particular MMO terminal designated to receive two or more data stream:;, t.hat 'terrain.il*s vector of SNRs may be replicated such that the vector ippears in a:&gt; Tiany rows as the number of data streams to be transmitted for the terminal ;i.e., oie vo'M p<ir data stkjam alternatively one n in the hypothesis matrix f may>e uswl for cach SIMO or MIMO terminal, and the scheduler may be designed to mark ind ev aluatc: l:hi:se different types of tiirminals accordingly.<br>
;;1044] i^i.1 e^ach terminal in the set to be evalaatcd, the NT (hypothetically) lansrnitted -lata stn^aras are received by the terminal's NR jeceive antennas, and the NR :Tt:ceiv(d signals can be processed using spatial or spa^e-time equalization to separate )\xt the NT trginsniitted data streams, as described below. The SNR of a post-processed -lata st-eam (i.e., after equalization) may be estimated atic comprises the post-processed SNR for that data stream. For each tenninal, a set of N'T post-processed SNRs may^be jrovidid foi the NT data streams that may be received by that terminal. 1045] ir a successive equalization and interference cancellation (or "successive cancellation") receiver processing technique is used at a tenninal to process the received .signals, ther iht post-proc:essed SNR achieved at the tenninal for each transmitted data :;iream depends, on the order in which the transmitted data streams arc detected (i.e., 'l^modulatecl and decoded) to recover tlie transmitted data, as described below. In this i:;ase, a nurcber of sets of SNRs may be provided for each terminal for a number of jjDSsibie deta»:;tion orderings. Multiple hypothesis matrices may then be formed and (jvaluuled to detennine which specific combination of terminals and detection ordering jjrovidi^s the test system performance.<br>
[1046] In any case, each hypothesis matrix T includes the post-processed SNRs for ;i specific set a:" tenoinals (i.e., hypoth»esis) to be evaluated. These post-processed SNRs represent the^ !5:S[Rs achievable by the teiminals and are u&amp;^d to evaluate the hypothesis. 110471 FTG. 2 is a flow diagram of a process 200 to schedule terminals for data iransmission, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. For clarity, the overall proceiis is first described and Ae details for some of the steps in the process are Inscribed subi^icjuently.<br><br>
[1048] Iri:.ti2tlly, metrics, to be used to select the best set of tenninals for data transrcissioij arc imtialized, at step 212. Various pexfonn^Lnce metrics may be used to 3valu;i:e the teimnal sets and some of these are descrit&gt;ed in further detail below. For example, a ];erfbrmance metric that miiximizes system tiir^tighput may be used. [1049] A. (rigw) set of one or moie active terminals is tien selected from among all active termin:aj.s co:asider«;d for scheduling, at step 214. This set of terminals forms a hypothesis to- IK' evaluated. Various t
all terriinalJ in i:he hypothesis form the hypothesis matrix P shown in equation (2). [1050]      Fcir isach hypothesis matrix F of Nx transmit antennas and Nt tenninals, there iire Nr factorial possible combinations of assig:iments of transmit antennas, to terminals (.e.,  N7!  sub-hypotheses).     Thus,  a particular  (new)  combination of-antenjia/teriminal assignments is selected for evaluation, at step 218.   This particular :omb;inatior of ;antenna/termina] assi|pments forms a sub-hypothesis to be evaluated.

For example, the antenna assigmnents may be based on an idiaustive ;ic:an:h or the max-max criterion described above. In another antenna issigTiment scheme, the transmit antennas are assigned to the terminals such that their ^riorilJes are; iionnalized as close as pos^iible, after the termi;tial metrics are updated. "1074] The data rates imd coding iind modulation schemes for the terminals are then determined bt^cd on the antenna assij^nments, at step 418. The scheduled transmission iitcrval and liiita rates may be repo::ted to the scheduled terminals. Hie metrics of ;icheduled (and unscheduled) terminals in the list are up«3ated to reflect the scheduled data tnmsmiiyion (md non-transnrission), and system metrics are also updated, at step 420.<br>
|'10751 \'Brious metrics and factors may be used to determine the priority of the active erminalj:.. In an embodiment, a "score" may be maintained for each terminal in ihe list and f«:&gt;r each metric to be used for scheduling. In one embodiment, a score indicat.ve of ai average throughput over a particulai" averaging time interval is inaintaned for each active terminal.   In one implementation, the score ^„(k) for<br>
lermirud n at frame k is computed as a linear average throughput achieved over some time interval, md can be expressed as:<br><br>
where r^(z) is tie realized data rate (in unit of bits/frame) fox teiminai n at frame i and may be comjuititd as shown in equation (4). Typically. r^(i) is bounded by a particular<br><br>
aiaxiir.um a:hievable daUt rate, rmax. iind a particular niimmum data rate (e.g., zero). In another impIcrnentation, the score p^{k) for terminal n m frame fc is an exponential avera.gs thrc iighput achieved over sorae time interval, and can be expressed as:<br><br>
vi^here a is a dme constant for the exponential averaging, with a larger value for a :orresii&gt;onding \o a longer averaging tjne interval<br>
[1076] ^^^hinl a terminal desires data transmission, it is added to the list and its score if. initialized to zen). The score for each temainal in the list is subsequently updated on 3ach Irame. 'vSHiencver a terminal is not scheduled for tritnsmission in a frame, its data rate.fa: the iiTinie is set to zero (i.e., r^(/:) = 0) and its score is updated accordingly. If a<br>
frame is received in error by a terminal, the terminal's effective data rate for that frame may bt; set to zero. The frame error may not be known iimnediately (e.g., due to round nip delay of rn acknowledgment/negative acknowledgnent (Ack/Nak) scheme used for Jie da:!a traniaris&amp;ion) but the score c;m be adjusted accordingly once this information is ivailable.<br>
[1077] Trie pricrity for the active terminals may also be determined based in part on jystern conso^nts and requirements.. For example, if tlie maximum latency for a ^axticijlar tcnninal exceeds a threshold value, then the terminal may be elevated to a ligh piiorit}.<br>
1078] Othsr factors may also be considered in detemdning the priority of the active :ermin.ils. Ox such factor may be related to the type of data to be transmitted to the *ermin.ils. E^elay sensitive data may be associated with higher priority, and delay insensitive rruiv be associated with lower priority. Retransmitted data due to decoding errors for a prior transmission may also be associated witli higher priority since other ;&gt;rocesi;es may be awaiting the retransimitted data. Another factor may be related to the ij^e of datii service being provided for the terminals. Other factors may aJso be i;onsid
 <br>
value;; (i.e., Iu|2h or low priority, depending on whetiicr or not the constraints and ::^Mquiiement&gt; have been violated) and the scores represent "soft" values. For this i;:mbodinienl, terminals for v/hich the system constraints and. requirements have not been :iiet ai-t; imir^jdiately considered, alonj? v/ith other tenninals based on tlxeir scores. i'lOSOJ Pi. piiority-bas-^d scheduling scheme may be designed to achieve equal average thrctughput (i.e., equal QoS) for all tenninals in the list. In this case, active venniniils ars prioritized based on thieir achieved average throughput, which may be ticterroined .u; ;ii]iown in equation (6) or (7). In this ptioiity-based scheduling scheme, ihe scheduhrr i.ises the scores to prioritize terminals for lissignment to the available Mansmit antijnriis. The scores of the terminals are updated based on their assipments or non-assij;:DD:ii5nts. to transmit antennas. The active terminals in the list may be jiriorirized sji;h thai: the terminal with the lowest score is given the highest priority, and ihe terminal with nhe hij^est score is conversely given the lowest priority. Other jTiethods for ranking terminals may jdso be used. Tlic prioritization may also assign non-uniforrr weighting factors to the lerminal scores.<br>
110811 For a. scheduling scheme in which terminals are selected and scheduled for data tr;msmi£;;:;ion based on their priority, it is possible for poor tenninal groupings to ' (&gt;:cur c»ccasiona:.ly- A "poof terminal set is one that results, in similar channel response iriatrictJS Hit which cause similar and p<x>r SNRs for all terminals on all transmit data ittreamii as given in the hypothesis matrix T. This then results in low overall throughput Tor ca:h tenrdnel in the set. When this happen, the priorities of the terminals may not diange subs:inljally over several frames. In this way, the scheduler may be stuck with this particular terminal set until the pricMities change sufficiently to cause a change in membership -n the set.<br>

ITie post-processed SlSRs for each SIMO terminal are dettjnnined using MM^SE linear spatial equalization (witliout successive cancellation receiver pro(:esii;ing). The transmit antennas are assigned to the selected terminals based<br><br>

The four scheduled leradnals are transmitted four independent iJaia streams and each terminal uses MNISE equaUzation to process the receive signal and recover its data stream. The throughputs for each scheduled SIMO tisrminal are s:epara*:ely recorded, and the average throughput for all scheduled terminals is also recorded.<br>

In tlie MIMO mode, the MMO terminals benefit by jsing succeaiivc cancellation receiver processing to achieve higher post-processed SNRs. In tLe SD40 m«xle. the scheduling schemes are able to exploit multi-user selection divursily to acliieve improved performance (i.e., higher throughput) even iiough cacti SIMO terminal uses linear spatial equaiizarion, Jxi fact, the multi-user Jiveniity pro\'ided in the N-SIMO mode results in an average downlink throughput that exceeds the throughput achieved by dividing a transmission interval into four equal-iuraticn sut-slots and assigning each MIMO terminal to a respective sub-slot. ;illl] Trie scheduling schemes used in the simulations for both operating modes A'cre not desigxicd to provide proportionate fairness and some terminals will observe liigher average throughput than others. When a fairness criterion is imposed, the diffens ices in throughput for the two operating modes may diminish. Nevertheless, the .ibility to accommodate both MMO and N-SIMO terminajis provides added flexibility 10 the inrovisioriing of wireless data services.<br>

[1113] ]^'ic:h scheduled terminal :i\Ziy also be equipped with more receive antennas than tlie total ::iuml)er of data streams. Moreover, multiple terminals may share a give transjiiit anicniia, and the sharing may be achieved via time division multiplexing (e.g., assigning dfferent fractions of a transmssion interval to different tenninals), frequency division mL:':tipIexing (e.g., assigning different frequency subchannels to different terminals), codm division multiplexing (e.g., assigning different orthogonal codes to different terminals), some other multiplexing schemes;, or any combinations of these scheroes.<br>
[1114' The scheduling schemes described herein select terminals and assign antenrasfor data tj-ansmission based on channel state infojmation (e.g., post-processed SlNRs]. The post-processed SNRs :~or the terminals are dependent on the particular transirit power level used for the data streams transmittiic from the base station. For simplicity, th^ same transmit power level is assumed for all data streams (i.e., no power control of the tranvsmit power). However, by controlling the transmit power for each antenca, th^ achievable SNRs may be adjusted. For exan^le, by decreasing the ti.^ansirit pow^ for a particular transmit antenna via power control, the SNR associated . v/ith a data slri^am transmitted from this antenna is reduced, the interference caused bv this ciita sti'e:an:i on other data streams would also be reduced, and other data streams may te able to achieve better SNRs Thus, power control may also be used in conjurction wjth the scheduling schemes described herein, and this is within the scope of the :nvendiD::i.<br>

11153] III one embodiment, the CSl coniprisas sig?iiil-to-noise-plus-interference lEtio (SNR): '^'hich is derived as the ratio of the signal power over the noise plus interference po\ver. The SNR is typically estimated <ind prc for each transmission channel used data trans:mit stream although an aggregate sis jnay also be provided a numter of channels. the snr e may b quantiz to value having particular number bits. in one ihs s estimate is mapped index e.g. using look-up table. another emlx csi comprises signal power and interference plus ncise pi:: these two components separately derived tj transnoission.></ind>
11155] In yet another embodiment, the CSL comprises signal power, interference j&gt;ower, and r
11156]      bi yet another embodiment, the CSI comprises signal-to-noise ratio plus a h:st of interference powers for each observable interference term. This infonnation may Ixi derived and provided for each transmission channel used for data transmission. 11157]      In yei: another embodiment, tlie CSI comprises signal components in a matrix lonn M5.g,, t&gt;T5<n complex entries for all transmit-receive antenna pairs and the></n>
noise plus interference components in-matrix form (e.g., N^xNj^ complex entries).<br>
~.7hQ ba&gt;c statiiDn may then properly combine the signal components and the noise plus interference components for the appropriate transmit-receive antenna pairs to derive the c[uality for each transmission channel used for data trEJismission (e.g., the post-{&gt;rocessed SNR for each transmitted data stream, as received at the terminals). [1158] In 'yt^t another embodiment, the CSI comprises a data rate indicator for each tninsnriit.dati stream. The quality of a transmission channel to be used for data tnmsffiission m;iy be determined initially (e,g., based on the SNR estimated for the • nmsnriission channel) and a data rate corresponding to the determined channel quality caay tlisn be identified (e.g., based on a look-up table). The identified data rate is indicadve of tine maximum data rate that may be transmitted on the transmission :hanne; for ric required level of performance. The diOa rate is then mapped to and represcited by a data rate indicator (DIRT), which can be efilcientiy coded. For example, : :f (up t^) sev£;n possible data rates ars supported by the base station for each transmit<br><br>
ititenna, then i\ 3-bit value may be used to represent tlie DRI where, e.g., a zero may ndicats a davi rate of zero (i.e., don't use the transmit antenna) and I through 7 may be iscd to indicate: seven different data rates. In a typical implementation, the quality jieasuremerts (e.g., SNR estimates) are mapped directly to the DRI based on, e^g., a ook-u]3tabh.<br>
;:11S9] In £iriother embodiment, the CSI comprises power control information for iach transmission channel The power control infonnation may include a single bit for jach tiansmiission chaimel to indicate a request for either more power or less power, or t may include multiple bits to indic:ate the raagnitudci of the change of power level :355que!iied Irii tiiis embodiment, the base station may mal«:e use of the power control ' : riformation fed back from, tlie terminzils to adjust the data piocessing and/or the transmit<br>
1 &gt;ower. ;il60I L:i yet ar other embodimcni, the CSI comprises an indication of the particular jfocejiiiing scheme to be used at the base station for each transmit data stream. In this «i:iibo<iimen the indicator may identify particular cixiing scheme and riodulution to be used for transmit data strciun such that desired level of>2rfomance is achieved.<br>
[11611 i"! yet another embodiment, the CSI compnses a diffcrcntiaJ indicator for a ]3articular rae^ascire of quality for a transmission channel Initially, the SNR or DRI or some 3ther quiditj' measurement for the transmission channel is determined and itiported as a :re ference measurement value. Thereafter, monitoring of the quality of the iransm.ssion channel continues, and the difference between Lhe last reported ineasinement and the current measurement is determined. The difference may then be qaantized to one or more bits, and the quantized difference is mapped to and represented by the differential indicator, which is then reported. The differential indicator mjiy indicate to increase or decrease the last reported measurement by a ]);irticular step size (or to maintain tlie last reported measurement). For example, the (Lffercntial indicator may indicate ttiat (1) the observed SNR for a particular Jransniission channel has increased or decreased by a particular step size, or (2) the data r£;te should be adjusted by a particuhir amount, or some other change. The reference iceasurement n:iay be transmitted peiiodically to ensure that errors in the differential irdicators and'or cnoneoujj reception of these indicators do not accumulate.<br><br>
11162]      Cvtiier fcrms of CSI may also be used and ^:e within the scope of the invent! Dn.   Ji tjeneral, the CSI includes sufficient iofonnation in whatever fonn that . ir;ay bt. used i:o adjust the processing at the base station such thiat the desired level of perfornance is i3chieved for the transmitted data streams.<br>
11163] The CSI may be derived based on the signals transmitted from the base jtation and rex:eived at the terminals. In an embodiment, the CSI is derived based on a pilot reference: included in the transmitted signals. Alternatively or additionally, the CSI inay be deri\ tid based on die data included in the transmitted signals. 11164] In yiit imothex embodiment, the CSI comprises one or more signals transmitted on the liplink from the terminals to the base station. In some systems, a (Uigree of co;:i:^;Iaiicn may exist between the uplink and downlink (e.g. time division (luplexiid (TOD) systems where the uplink and downlinlc share the same band in a time division multiplexed manner). In tht^se systems, the quEiIity of the downlink may be £ s-timatsd (tct \i requisite degree of accui'acy) based on the quality of the uplink, which may be estiinited based on signals (e.g., pilot signals) trimsmitted from the terminals. "jie pibi signiilii wculd then represent a means for which the base station could estimate the CSI as obser/ed at the terminals.<br>
