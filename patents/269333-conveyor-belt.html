				<td>CONVEYOR BELT<br>
The invention relates to a conveyor belt with at least one belt edge arranged at<br>
one edge, in particular a longitudinal side of the conveyor belt.<br>
A generic conveyor belt is known, for example, from EP 1 299 295 01. A<br>
conveyor belt with a belt edge is described therein, where the belt edge in an<br>
outer partial section is made of a harder material since contact with the guide<br>
rollers takes place there. Another conveyor belt with a belt edge is known, for<br>
example, from the document US 4,955,456. The belt edges disclosed in these<br>
documents also show two different types of belt edges in which the beading<br>
against which the guide rollers abut is arranged once in the outer region and<br>
once in the inner region of the belt edge. The present invention relates to both<br>
these types of belt edge.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a conveyor belt of the type specified<br>
initially which is constructed as particularly stable and long-lived.<br>
This object is achieved with a conveyor belt having the features of claim 1-<br>
Advantageous further developments of the invention are described in the<br>
dependent claims.<br>
In a conveyor belt comprising at least one belt edge arranged at one edge, jn<br>
particular a longitudinal side, of the conveyor belt, it is important to the<br>
invention that threads of a tear-proof material are additionally arranged in the<br><br>
belt edge. This substantially increases the strength, in particular the tearing<br>
strength of the belt edge.  Overall the lifetime of the conveyor belt is<br>
significantly increased by this means since the belt edge is a particularly highly<br>
stressed part of the conveyor belt in the entire system. Preferably not only<br>
individual threads but a fabric of a tear-proof material are provided in the belt<br>
edge. The threads of the fabric of the tear-proof material are more favourably<br>
arranged in a plane extending parallel to the conveyor belt. Preferably, one<br>
layer of the tear-proof fabric or threads of the tear-proof material is arranged<br>
on each side of the conveyor belt in a plane extending parallel to the conveyor<br>
belt. Alternatively, a continuous inlay of such a fabric which therefore wraps<br>
around the outer conveyor belt edge can be provided in the belt edge. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, a region which directly adjoins the<br>
conveyor belt and which is aligned parallel to the conveyor belt has a greater<br>
hardness than a region which adjoins this region towards the outside. This<br>
particularly reduces the wear of the belt edge. The usually very stiff material of<br>
the conveyor belt itself can move inside the belt edge to a certain extent as a<br>
result of transverse twisting and thereby results in stressing and wear of the<br>
belt from inside. Such wear effects are minimised by the formation of an inner<br>
region in direct contact with the conveyor belt, which is made of a harder<br>
material that the following region.<br>
The conveyor belt according to the invention is particularly suitable for use in<br>
curved belt conveyors.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the belt edge is composed of two<br>
different parts, namely an inner layer and an outer layer which surrounds this.<br>
In this case, the inner layer is made of a harder material and the outer layer is<br>
made of a softer material. Both materials are preferably made of polyurethane.<br>
However, other materials are also possible. In a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the inner region and the outer region are<br>
produced by co-extrusion. The belt edge can thus be produced particularly<br>
simply and rapidly.<br><br>
The region of greater hardness preferably completely encloses the<br>
conveyor belt within the belt edge. The conveyor belt is naturally constructed<br>
as continuous so that the complete enclosure relates to the upper side and<br>
lower side of the conveyor belt and also relates to the outer side edge of the<br>
conveyor belt arranged in the belt edge. The threads or the fabric described<br>
above are preferably arranged in a plane between the inner region of greater<br>
hardness and the outer region of lower hardness.<br>
The belt edge forms a bead and furthermore preferably comprises arms which<br>
enclose the conveyor belt. In a preferred embodiment, the bead of the belt<br>
edge is arranged in the outer region and the arms enclosing the conveyor belt<br>
extend inwards into the conveyor belt. In another preferred embodiment, the<br>
bead is located at the end of these arms, that is in the region of the conveyor<br>
belt itself so that the arms extend outwards from the bead.<br>
A further aspect of the invention consists in providing a belt edge for the<br>
conveyor belt described above or for joining to the conveyor belt described<br>
above. This can be used in particular as a spare part or as a part for<br>
retrofitting, The belt edge is characterised in that threads of a tear-proof<br>
material iare arranged in the belt edge. Another aspect of the invention consists<br>
in providing a belt conveyor with an conveyor belt comprising at least one belt<br>
edge having threads of a tear-proof material, which are arranged in the belt<br>
edge. Reference Is made to the above description with regard to the further<br>
embodiments of the conveyor belt.<br>
The invention is explained further hereinafter with reference to a preferred<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in the drawings. In detail, the schematic<br>
diagrams show in:<br>
Fig. 1;	a perspective partial view of a belt edge of a conveyor belt<br>
according to the invention with pulled-out or cut regions of<br>
different width;<br>
Fjg. 2:	a partial section of a belt edge with "transparent" outer region;<br><br>

second embodiment of the invention;<br>
Fig. 5;         a perspective view of a partial region of the belt edge according<br>
to Fig. 4:<br>
Fig. 6;         a cutaway view of a conveyor belt with two belt edges In a third<br>
embodiment of the invention;<br>
Fig. 7;         a perspective view of a section of a belt edge according to Fig. 6.<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a belt edge 1 of a conveyor belt. The belt<br>
edge 1 in this case comprises a region consisting of two parallel arms 2 which<br>
forms a receiving pocket on the inside into which the conveyor belt is inserted.<br>
The conveyor belt can then be joined to the belt edge 1, in particular to the<br>
arms 2, in particular sewn or glued. In the outer region there is provided a<br>
bead-like elevation 3 which serves to abut against conveying rollers. The inner<br>
region 4 which is embodied as double-layered in this case, is used to receive<br>
the conveyor belt The inner region 4 is designed to have a greater hardness<br>
than the outer region 5. Different polyurethane mixtures can be used for this<br>
purpose. The regions are preferably produced by co-extrusion. A fabric is<br>
inserted between these regions in this case to increase the tearing strength.<br>
This fabric is preferably made of plastic fibres. The inlay 6 fs preferably<br>
arranged at a short distance from the open edge. As a result, the inlay cannot<br>
act as an obstacle at which the objects to be transported can become trapped.<br>
In the inner region the fabric 6 is aligned parallel to the conveyor belt, two<br>
separate parallel layers of fabric 6 being provided. Alternatively, a single fabric<br>
element can also be provided which is embodied such that it surrounds the<br>
conveyor belt according to the configuration of the inner region.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows the section of the belt edge 1 with the arms 2 and the bead<br>
3, the outer region 5 being embodied as transparent in this diagram so that the<br>
fabric 6 is completely visible, In the lower region the second fabric layer 6' can<br>
be seen below the groove 8 for receiving the conveyor belt. The fabric 6 is<br>
located above the conveyor belt and the fabric layer 6' is located below the<br>
conveyor belt.<br>
Figure 3 shows a cross-section through the belt edge 1. The same parts are<br>
characterised by the same reference numerals. The two inlays 6 and 6' made<br>
of fabric to increase the further tearing strength are readily identified here,<br>
these being formed on both sides between the inner region 5 of greater<br>
hardness and the adjoining region 4 of lower hardness. In this case, the region<br>
4 is preferably embodied as continuous and forms the entire remaining belt<br>
edge. It is also feasible to provide additional layers or regions of different<br>
hardness in the outer region of the belt edge, as is known from the prior art.<br>
Figure 4 shows a second embodiment of a conveyor belt according to the<br>
invention, the conveyor belt 1 being constructed in this case such that the<br>
arms 2' are in the outer region of the conveyor belt 10 whilst the bead 3' is<br>
arranged at the end of the belt edge 1 op the conveyor belt side. The conveyor<br>
belt 10 is inserted in the recess formed by the belt edge 1 and in particular is<br>
sewed and/or glued thereto in the region of the arms 2'. In this case, the belt<br>
edge 1 also has an inner region 5 made of a harder material, in particular<br>
made of a harder-set polyurethane and an outer region 5 made of a softer<br>
material, in particular a softer-set polyurethane. The belt edge or the region of<br>
the belt edge can also be described as resin mouldings.<br>
Figure 5 shows the belt edge according to Fig. 4 in a perspective view, the<br>
inner region 5 being shown as pulled out.<br>
Figure 6 shows a conveyor belt 10 with belt edges 1 on each longitudinal side<br>
of the conveyor belt 10. Also jn the preceding embodiments, the belt edges 1<br>
can each be arranged on one or both sides, preferably on both sides.<br>
Otherwise, the embodiment of the belt edge 1 in Fig. 6 corresponds to the<br><br>
embodiment according to Fig, 3, an inlay 6 being provided in the<br>
embodiment according to Fig. 6.<br>
Figure 7 shows a corresponding three-dimensional representation of the belt<br>
edge 1 from Fig. 6. The inner region of greater hardness and the outer region<br>
of lower hardness can also be identified therein.<br><br>
