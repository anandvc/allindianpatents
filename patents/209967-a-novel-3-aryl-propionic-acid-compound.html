THE PATENTS RULES, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A NOVEL 3-ARYL PROPIONIC ACID COMPOUND"<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB, a Swedish company of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
2 9 MAY 2007<br><br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention releates to certain novel 3-aryl-2-hydroxypropionic acid compounds and analogs, to a process for preparing such compounds, having die utility in clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance, to methods for their therapetitic use and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
; Insulin resistance, defined as reduced sensitivity to the actions of insulin in the whole body or individual tissues such as skeletal muscle, myocardium, fat and liver prevail in many individuals with or without diabetes mellitus. The insulin resistance syndrome, IRS, refers - to a cluster of manifestations including insulin resistance with accompanying _.hyperinsuiinemia, possibly noa insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), arterial hypertension, central (visceral) obesity, dyslipidemia observed as deranged lipoprotein levels typically characterized by elevated VLDL (very low density lipoproteins) and reduced HDL (high density lipoproteins) concentrations and reduced fibrinolysis.<br>
Recent epidemiological research has documented that individuals with insulin resistance run a greatly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, notably suffering from myocardial infarction and stroke. In non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus these atherosclerosis related conditions cause up to 80% of all deaths.<br>
In clinical medicine there is at present only limited awareness of the need to increase the insulin sensitivity in IRS and thus to correct the dyslipidemia which is considered to cause the accelerated progress of atherosclerosis.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 99/62371	PCT/SE99/00942<br>
Furthermore there is at present no pharmacotherapy available to adequately correct the metabolic derangements associated with IRS. To date, the treatment of NTDDM has been focused on correction of the deranged control of carbohydrate metabolism associated with the disease. Stimulation of endogenous insulin secretion by means of secretagogues, like sulphonylureas, and if necessary administration of exogenous insulin are methods frequently used to normalize blood sugar but that will, if anything, further enhance insulin resistance and will not correct the other manifestations of IRS nor reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition such treatment involves a significant risk of hypoglycemia with associated complications.<br>
Other therapeutic strategies have focused on aberrations in glucose metabolism or absorption, including biguanides, such as methformin, or glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose. Although these agents have been efficacious to a degree, their limited clinical effect is associated with side effects.<br>
A nove! therapeutic strategy involve,; the use of insulin sensitizing agents, such as the thiazolidinediones which at least in part mediate their effects via an agonistic action on nuclear receptors. Ciglitazone is the prototype in this class. In animal models of IRS these compounds seem to correct insulin resistance and the associated hypertriglyccridacmia and hyperinsulinernia, as well as hyperglycemia in diabetes, by improving insulin sensitivity via an effect on lipid transport and handling, leading to enhanced insulin action in skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue.<br>
Ciglitazone as well as later described thiazolidinediones in clinical development either have been discontinued reportedly due to unacceptable toxicity or show inadequate potency. Therefore there is a need for new and better compounds with insulin sensitizing properties.<br>

24<br><br>
WO 99/62871	PCT/SE99/00942<br><br>
step may be carried out in the presence of an inert solvent or in the absence of solvent in which case the temperature should be sufficiently high to cause at least partial melting of the reaction mixture, a preferred such temperature is in the range of 100°C to 250°C.<br>
Sometimes it is necessary to add a dehydrating agent such as p-toluenesulfonic acid in order to achieve the formation of the double bond.<br>
In a typical such reaction the aldehyde or ketone starting material and the compound of formula HI are combined in approximately equimolar amounts and molar excess, preferably 1-5 fold, of anhydrous sodium acetate and the mixture is heated until it melts if necessary under vacuum. The compound of formula I wherein A is the unsaturated moiety, can then be isolated by mixing with water and acetone, followed by filtration of the formed precipitate. The crude product can be purified if desired, e.g. by recrystallization or by standard chromatographic methods.<br>
This reaction can also be performed conveniently in a solvent such as toluene in the presence of piperidine acetate. The reaction mixture is refluxed in a Dean-Stark apparatus to remove water. The solution is then cooled and the olefin product isolated and purified, by standard methods.<br>
The reaction can also be performed by mixing the aldehyde or ketone and me compound of formula III in dry tetrahydrofuran, slowly adding potassium tert-butoxide at -20°C and quenching the reaction with acetic acid. The crude product is isolated and then dissolved in toluene and refluxed with p-toluenesulfonic acid in an Dean-Stark apparatus to remove the water. The product is then isolated and purified, by standard methods.<br>

Pharmacological properties<br>
The present compounds of formula (I) will be adapted xbr die prophylaxis and/or treatment of clinical conditions associated with reduced sensitivity to insulin (insulin resistance) and associated metabolic disorders. These clinical conditions will include, but will not be limited to, abdominal obesity, arterial hypertension, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and the dyslipidaemia characteristically appearing with insulin resistance. This dyslipidaemia, also known as the atherogenic lipoprotein profile of phenotype B, is characterised by moderately elevated non-estcrified fatty acids, elevated very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) triglycerides, low high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol and the presence of small, dense, low density lipoproteins (LDL). Treatment wim the present compounds is expected to lower the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with atherosclerosis. These cardiovascular disease conditions include macro-angiophaties causing myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial insufficiency of the lower extremities. Because of their insulin sensitizing effect compounds of formula (I) are also expected to reduce the progress of clinical conditions associated with chronic hyperglycaemia in diabetes like the micro-angiopharies causing renal disease and retinal damage. Furthermore the compounds may be useful in treatment of various conditions outside the cardiovascular system associated with insulin resistance like the polycystic ovarian syndrome.<br>

Biological activity<br>
The biological activity of the compounds of the invention was tested in obese diabetic mice of the Umei ob/ob strain. Groups of mice received the test compound by gavage once daily for 7 days. On the last day of the experiment the animals were anesthetized 2h after dose in a non-fed state and blood was collected from an incised artery. Plasma was analyzed for concentration of glucose, insulin and triglycerides. A group of untreated obese diabetic mice of die same age served as control. The weight of the mice was measured before and after die experiment and the obtained weight gain was compared to the weight gain of die control animals. The individual values for glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels of die mire from die test gioup were expressed as *he percent range of *he corresponding values from the control group.<br>
The desired "therapeutic effect" was calculated as the average percent reduction of die three variables glucose, insulin and triglycerides below die levels in the control animals. The therapeutic effect of the tested compounds according to the invention was compared to die same effect in die prior art compound trogUtazone, administrated by gavage in die oral dose of 100 umol/kg for 7 days.<br>
The superior effects of die tested compounds according to uie invention compared to diat of trogUtazone when given in die same oral dose demonstrate die increased potency and efficiacy of die claimed compounds.<br><br><br>
