The present invention relates to vat dye mixtures, proces(for their preparation and their use for dyeing ceilulosic fibre materials.<br>
Vat dyes and their use for dyeing ceilulosic fibre materials have been known for a long time. However, the existing vat dyes and vat dye mixtures often do not meet the recently increased requirements to the full extent, in particular in respect of a broader range of shades.<br>
The object of this invention was therefore to provide novel vat dye mixtures which meet the current requirements.<br>
It has been found that this object can be achieved with the vat dye mixtures according to the invention.<br>
The present Application thus relates to a vat dye mixture comprising at least two structurally different dyes, each of which have the foiTnula<br><br>
in which<br>
X is phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by Ci-C4alkyl, Ci-C4alkoxy or halogen;<br>
morpholino; or the radical -SR3;<br>
Rj and R2 independently of one another are each hydrogen or tlie radical -NHCO-C6H5,<br>
and<br>
R3 is Ci-C4alkyl, or phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by Ci-C4alkyl or<br>
halogen.<br><br>
In the formula (1), Ci-C4alkyl is methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl or tert-butyl.<br>
In the formula (1), Ci-C4alkoxy is methoxy, ethoxy, ptopoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, isobutoxy, sec-butoxy or tert-butoxy.<br>
In the formula (1), halogen is, for example, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
X is preferably unsubstituted phenyl or morpholino.<br>
Important vat dye mixtures are those comprising a dye of the formula (1) in which<br>
X is phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by Ci-C4alkyl, Ci-C4alkoxy or halogen;<br>
Rj is hydrogen and<br>
R2 is the radical -NHCO-C6H5,<br>
and a dye of the formula (1) in which<br>
X is phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by C) •C4alKyl, Ci-C4alkoxy or halogen;<br>
and<br>
Rj and R2 are each the radical -NHCO-CgHs.<br>
j <br><br><br><br>
Vat dye mixtures which are likewise particularly preferred are those comprising 10 to 90 % by weight of the vat dye of tiie formula (4) and 90 to 10 % by weight of the vat dye of the formula (5).<br>
The vat dye mixture comprising 70 % by weight of the vat dye of the formula (2) and 30 % by weight of the vat dye of the formula (3) is especially preferred.<br>
The vat dye mixture comprising 60 % by weiglit of the vat dye of the formula (4) and 40 % by weight of the vat dye of die formula (5) is likewise especially preferred.<br>
The dyes of the formulae (2) to (5) are known or can be |)repared by known methods.<br>
The vat dye mixtures according to the invention are |prepared from known starting substances by known methods, for example by reacting 2-phenyl-4,6-dichlorotriazine with 1-aminoanthraquinone and l-amino-5-benzoylamin(mnthrac|uinone, the ratio of 1-aminoanthraquinone to l-amino-S-benzoylaminoanthratjuinone being chosen according to the desired content of the two individual dyes in the vat dye mixture, or by first reacdng 2-phenyI-4,6-dichlorotriazine with 1-aminoanihrm.minone and 1,5-diaminoanthraquinone, the ratio of 1-aminoanthraquinone to 1,5-diaminoanihraquinone being chosen according to the desired content of the two individual dyes in the vat dye mixture, and then reacting the resulting intermediate with benzoyl chloride, or by first reacting cyanuric chloride with 1-aminoanthraquinone and l-amino-5-benzoylaminoanthraquinone, the raUo of 1-amino¬anthraquinone to l-amino-5-benzoylaminoanthraquinone being chosen according to the desired content of the two individual dyes in the vat dye mixture, and then reacdng the resuUing intermediate with morpholine.<br>
The vat dye mixtures according to the invention are advantageously prepared in organic solvents, for example higher-boiling aUphatic hydrocarbons, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, l,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, teiramethylurea, dimethyl-fonnamide, xylene, phenol, trichiorobenzenc, nitrolicnzeiie or methyl benzoate.<br>
The preferred solvent is nitrobenzene.<br>
Suitable cellulosic fibre materials are, in particular, iion-|iic:|ieated cellulose, for example hemp, linen, jute and natural cotton, and fibre mixtures, fureKurnple those of polyacrylonitrile/coiton or polyester/cotton, and fibre materials Inised on regenerated<br><br>
cellulose (viscose) are furthermore also suitable. The cellulosic material can be in widely varying processing forms here, for example as loose material, yarn, woven fabric, a nonwoven or knitted fabric.<br>
The amount of vat dye mixture added to the dye liquor depends on the desired tinctorial strength. In general, amounts of 0.001 to 10, preferably 0 01 lo 3 percent by weight, based on the weight of the cellulosic fibre material employed, hiive |)i(»ved apprqpriate.<br>
In addition to one of the vat dye mixtures according lo the. invention, the dye liquors comprise the auxiliary chemicals customary for vat dyeing. These are, for example, alkali, such as sodium carbonate, potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide, or alkali donors, for example sodium chloroacetate. Sodium hydroxide is preferred. They also include reducing agents, hydrosulfite preferably being used.<br>
The dye liquor can additionally also comprise other customary dyeing auxiliary products, for example electrolytes, such as sodium chloride or sodium sulfate, or commercially available wetting agents, levelling agents and dispersants.<br>
The vat dye mixtures according to the invention can be applied from an aqueous solution by the padding or exhaust methods customary in vat dyeing. The exhaust method is preferred. The liquor ratio depends on the circunisiances of the apparatus, on the substrate and on the make-up form. However, it can be chosen within a wide range, for example 1:4 to 1:100, but is preferably between 1:6 and 1:20.<br>
The dyeing process can be carried out at temperatures from 20 to 110°C. The temperature is preferably between 30 and 100°C, in particular between 30 and 80°C.<br>
After the dyeing, the dyed cellulosic material is souped in the customary manner. For this, the substrate is treated at boiling point in a solution which comprises soap or synthetic detergent and, if appropriate, sodium carbonate.<br>
Level and strong yellow dyeings which are distingiiished by good colour yields and good light and wet fastness properties are obtained with ilie vat dye mixtures according to the invention.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention. In these examples, parts are parts by weight and percentages are percentages by weight. The temperatures arc stated in<br><br><br><br>
Example 1:<br>
40.3	g of 98.2 % 2-phenyl-4,6-dichlorotriazine,<br>
29.7 g of 98.6 % 1-aminoanthraquinone,<br>
82.6 g of 90.6 % l-amino-5-benzoylaminoanthraquinone and<br>
1050 ml of nitrobenzene are initially introduced into a 2 1 reaction vessel, under a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere, and are heated up to a temperature of 100-105°C and stirred for 6 hours.<br>
The reaction mass, which changes via a dark solution into an orange suspension, is then<br>
heated up to 140-145°C and subsequently stirred at this temperature for 15 hours.<br>
The orange-red suspension formed is then cooled to room temperature and filtered. The<br>
precipitate is first washed with nitrobenzene until a pale-coloured filtrate results, and is<br>
then washed with ethyl alcohol until the filtrate becomes nitrobenzene-free and<br>
water-clear.<br>
Thereafter, the precipitate is washed with water until the pH is neutral and dried.<br>
138.7	g of a condensation product which comprises about 75 % of the dye of the formula<br>
(2) and about 25 % of the dye of the formula (3) are obtained.<br>
Example 2:<br>
55.4	g of cyanuric chloride,<br>
95.1 g of 98.6 % 1-aminoanthraquinone and<br>
68.0 g of 90.6 % l-amino-5-benzoylaminoanthraquinone are suspended in<br>
2000 ml of nitrobenzene in a 3 1 reaction vessel, under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the<br>
suspension is heated up to a temperature of 100-105°C and stirred for 6 hours.<br>
The reaction mass is then heated up to 140-145°C and subsequently stirred at this<br>
temperature for 15 hours. Thereafter,<br>
149.8	g of morpholine are added and the reaction mass is subsquently stirred at 140-145°C<br>
for a further 8 hours.<br>
The resulting orange suspension is then cooled to room temperature and filtered. The<br>
precipitate is first washed with nitrobenzene until a pale-coloured filtrate results, and is<br>
then washed with ethyl alcohol until the filtrate becomes nitrobenzene-free and<br>
water-clear.<br>
Thereafter, the precipitate is washed with water until the pH is neutral and dried.<br>
191.1 g of a condensation product which comprises about 60 % of the dye of the formula<br>
(4) and about 40 % of the dye of the formula (5) are obtained.<br><br>
Example 3:<br>
34.50 g of 98.2 % 2-phenyl-4,6-dichlorotriazine and<br>
27.15 g of 98.6 % 1-aminoanthraquinone in<br>
600 ml of nitrobenzene are initially introduced into a 750 ml reaction vessel, under a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere, and are heated up to a temperature of 100-105°C and stirred for 3<br>
hours (reaction mass A).<br>
In the meantime,<br>
42.48 g of 96.9 % 1,5-diaminoanthraquinone in<br>
500 ml of nitrobenzene are initially introduced into a 1.5 1 reacdon vessel, under a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere, and are heated up to a temperature of 140-145°C (reaction mass B).<br>
Reaction mass A is now metered into reaction mass B in the course of 1 hour, the reaction<br>
temperature in the 1.5 1 reaction vessel being kept at 140-145°C.<br>
The 750 ml reaction vessel is then rinsed with<br>
50 ml of nitrobenzene.<br>
The combined reaction masses A and B are now kept at 140-142°C in the 1.5 1 reaction<br>
vessel under a nitrogen atmosphere for 6 hours. Thereafter,<br>
30.30 g of benzoyl chloride are added and the contents of the reactor are subsequently<br>
stirred at 140-142°C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 15 hours.<br>
The orange-red suspension formed is then cooled to room temperature and filtered. The<br>
precipitate is first washed with nitrobenzene until a pale-coloured filtrate results, and is<br>
then washed with ethyl alcohol until the filtrate becomes nitrobenzene-free and<br>
water-clear.<br>
Thereafter, the precipitate is washed with water until the pH is neutral and dried.<br>
102.50 g of a condensation product which comprises about 80 % of the dye of the formula<br>
(2) and about 20 % of the dye of the formula (3) are obtained.<br>
Example 4:<br>
A piece of 10 g of cotton tricot is prewetted in water, healed to about 70-80°C, for 10<br>
minutes and then brought to a moisture content of about 60 % by weight, calculated with<br>
respect to the weight of the cotton tricot, by means til' a laboruiory spin-dri^r. The cotton<br>
tricot prepared in this way is treated in an Ahiba® laboratory tlyeing apparatus, at 30*'C<br>
and at a liquor ratio of 1:10, with a liquor comprising<br>
0.25 g of a vat dye mixture comprising:<br>
0.175 g of the vat dye of the formula (2) and<br>
0.075 g of the vat dye of the formula (3), 2 g/1 of a commercially available levelling agent,<br><br>
12 ml/1 of a 30 % sodium hydroxide solution,<br>
4 g/1 of sodium hydrosulfite and<br>
14 g/1 of sodium chloride.<br>
After addition of the cotton tricot, the temperature of the liquor is increased to 50°C in the<br>
course of 15 minutes and maintained for 45 minutes. Thereafter, the cotton tricot is<br>
removed from the dyebath, rinsed with water and oxidized for 20 minutes at 50°C with an<br>
aqueous solution comprising 5 ml/1 of 30 % H2O2.<br>
The cotton tricot is then rinsed with water and soaped for 20 minutes at 90 to 100°C with<br>
an aqueous solution comprising 1 g/1 of a commercially available detergent and wetting<br>
agent and 1 g/1 of calcined sodium carbonate.<br>
Thereafter, the cotton tricot is rinsed with hot and cold water and dried.<br>
A golden orange dyeing with very good fastnesses to light and washing is obtained.<br><br><br><br>
