				<td>Unsarurated polymer composition<br>
Field of invention<br>
The invention relates to an unsaturated polymer composition compnsing a free radical generating agent, a process for modifying such an unsaturated polymer composition (e.g. to crosslink it), to modified polymer compositions, preferably cross-linked polymer compositions, to an article, preferably wire or cable, comprising said polymer composition, e.g. modified polymer composition, to a process for preparing an article, preferably a wire or cable and to the use of said polymer composition in one or more layers of a wire or cable..<br>
Background art<br>
It is known to use free radical generating agents to modify a product, such as a polymer composition via a radical reaction.<br>
Free radical agents are used e.g. to initiate (a) crosslinking in a polymer, i.a. primarily a formation of interpolymer crosslinks (bridges) by radical reaction, (b) grafting in a polymer, i.e. introduction of compounds to a polymer chain (to backbone and/or side chains) by radical reaction, and (c) visbreaking in a polymer, i.e. modification of melt flow rate (MFR) of a polymer by radical reaction. These polymer modifications are well known in the art.<br>
When added to a polymer composition, free radical generating agents act by generating radicals, typically by decomposing to radicals, under conditions which enable the radical formation. The decomposed radicals initiate further radical reactions within a polymer composition. The resulting decomposition products of the free radical generating agent are typically a result of several reactions of the decomposition products of initial radical forming reaction. Said resulting decomposition products typically remain in the modified polymer and may include detrimental, undesired decomposition products.<br>
Peroxides are very common free radical generating agents used i.a. in the polymer industry for said polymer modifications. The resulting decomposition products of peroxides may include volatile by-products. For example, dicumylperoxide, which is commonly used peroxide in polymer field, decomposes i.a. to methane, acetophenone and cumylalcohol during the radical formation step, e.g. during a crosslinking step. The formed gaseous methane (CH4) is flammable, explosive and volatile and thus a risk in a working environment.<br>
In wire and cable applications a typical cable comprises at least one conductor surrounded by one or more layers of polymeric materials. In some power cables, including medium voltage (MV), high voltage (HV) and extra high voltage (EHV) cables, said conductor is surrounded by several layers including an inner semiconductive layer, an insulation layer and an outer semiconductive layer, in that order. The cables are commonly produced by extruding the layers on a conductor. One or more of said layers are then typically crosslinked to improve i.a. deformation resistance at elevated temperatures, as well as mechanical strength and/or chemical resistance, of the layer(s) of the cable. The free radical generating agent, such as a peroxide, is typically incorporated to the layer material prior to the extrusion of the layer(s) on a conductor. After formation of the layered cable, the cable is then subjected to a crosslinking step to initiate the radical formation and thereby crosslinking reaction.<br>
The decomposition products of the free radical forming agent remain mostly captured within the cable layer after crosslinking. This causes problems in view of the cable manufacturing process as well as in view of the quality of the final cable.<br>
Accordingly, after crosslinking the cable must be cooled with great care to prevent the gaseous volatile decomposition products like methane forming voids within the polymer layer. These voids have typically an average diameter of between 10 to 100 µm. Partial discharges can take place in such voids within a cable that is subjected to an electrical field and thereby reduce the electrical strength of the cable.<br>
The MV, HV and EHV power cables must have high layer quality in terms of safety during installation and in end use thereof. In service, volatile decomposition products in a cable resulting from a crosslinking step can create a gas pressure and thus cause defects in the shielding and in the joints. For example, when a cable is equipped with a metal barrier, then the gaseous products can exert a pressure, especially on the joints and terminations, whereby a system failure may occur.<br>
For the above reasons the volatile decomposition products, such as methane e.g. where dicumylperoxide is used, are conventionally reduced to a minimum or removed after crosslinking and cooling step. Such removal step is generally known as a degassing step.<br>
The degassing step is time and energy consuming and is thus a costly operation in a cable manufacturing process. Degassing requires large heated chambers which must be well ventilated to avoid the build-up of, for example, flammable methane and ethane. The cable, typically wound to cable drums, is normally degassed at elevated temperature in the range of 50-80°C, e.g. 60-70°C, for lengthy time periods. At these temperatures however, thermal expansion and softening of the insulation can occur and lead to undue deformation of the formed cable layers resulting directly in failures of the cable. The degassing of MV, HV and EHV cables with high cable weight needs thus often be carried out at decreased temperatures.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need to find new solutions to overcome the prior art problems.<br>
The skilled man is also targetting cross-linking agents which are excellent cross-linkers. This invention concerns unsaturated polymers (further defined below) and the successful cross-linking of such polymers is made more complex by the presence of unsaturated groups i.a. in the polymer side chains. The present inventors have found peroxides which not oniy minimise the formation of volatile decomposition<br>
products but are also excellent cross-linkers for the unsaturated polymers which are the subject of this invention.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
One of the objects of the present invention is to provide an alternative process for modifying a polymer composition by using a free radical generating agent with superior properties.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a polymer composition exhibiting excellent properties, such as high quality, useful for many end applications of polymers, i.a. for wire and cable applications.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an article produced from said polymer composition, such as a cable which comprises one or more layers comprising said polymer composition, which article has highly advantageous properties, such as high quality and superior processability properties.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a process for producing an article using said polymer composition, preferably a cable, as defined above, which process enables the preparation of high quality products with shorter production time and/or lower energy consumption.<br>
The invention and further objects thereof are described and defined in details below.<br>

The preferable embodiments and subgroups of the polymer composition of the invention, the components thereof and its modification, i.e. at least the crosslinking method, are described below generally for the invention and can be combined in any combination.<br>
Polymer composition<br>
The polymer composition of the invention comprises an unsaturated polymer (A). The expression "Polymer Composition" is used herein to mean the polymer composition of the invention. In a first embodiment, the amount of carbon-carbon<br>
 (abbreviated to C-C) double bonds is measured based on the total amount of C-C double bonds present in the Polymer Composition as a whole. It is evident that at least the unsaturated polymer contains said C-C double bonds which contribute to the total amount of C-C double bonds. The Polymer Composition may optionally comprise further component(s) containing said C-C double bonds which then also contribute to the total amount of said C-C double bonds. In the first embodiment therefore, the C-C double bond content is thus measured on the composition as a whole not just on the unsaturated polymer component (A) thereof.<br>
The carbon-carbon double bonds of the Polymer Composition preferably originate from vinyl groups, vinylidene groups or trans-vinylene groups, or from a mixture thereof, which are present in said Polymer Composition. The Polymer Composition does not necessarily contain all types of double bonds mentioned above. However, if it does, they all contribute to the "total amount of carbon-carbon double bonds" as defined above or below. The determination method for calculating the amounts of the carbon-carbon bonds in the above and below definitions is described under "Determination Methods".<br>
The below defined preferable subgroups, further features, such as further properties or ranges thereof, and preferable embodiments apply generally to said Polymer Composition, to end applications and to any processes thereof, and can be combined in any combination.<br>
The Polymer Composition contains preferably carbon-carbon double bonds in an amount of at least 0.05 or more, e.g. 0.1 or more, more preferably of 0.2 or more, and most preferably more than 0.37 carbon-carbon double bonds/1000 carbon atoms, e.g. at least 0.6/1000 carbon atoms, or preferably at least 0.8/1000 carbon atoms. The upper limit of the amount of carbon-carbon double bonds present in the Polymer Composition is not limited and may preferably be less of than 5.0/1000 carbon atoms, preferably less than 3.0/1000 carbon atoms, or more preferably less than 2.5/1000 carbon, or of up to 2.0/1000 carbon atoms.<br>
The Polymer Composition comprises preferably at least vinyl groups as said carbon-carbon double bonds, which vinyl groups originate preferably from<br>
i) a polyunsaturated comonomer,<br>
ii) a chain transfer agent,<br>
iii) an unsaturated low molecular weight compound which is, for example, a compound known as a crosslinking booster or a scorch retarder; or<br>
iv) any mixture thereof.<br>
In general, "vinyl group" means herein CH2=CH- moiety which can be present in any of i) to iv) above.<br>
The i) polyunsaturated comonomers and ii) chain transfer agents will be described below in relation to the unsaturated polymer of the Polymer Composition. The iii) unsaturated low molecular weight compound may be added into the Polymer Composition. The iii) unsaturated low molecular weight compound is preferably a crosslinking booster which is a compound containing at least 1, preferably at least 2, unsaturated groups, such as an aliphatic or aromatic compound, an ester, an ether, or a ketone, which contains at least 1, preferably at least 2, unsaturated group(s), such as a cyanurate, an isocyanurate, a phosphate, an orthoformate, an aliphatic or aromatic ether, or an allyl ester of benzene tricarboxylic acid. Examples of esters, ethers and ketones are compounds selected from general groups of diacrylates, triacrylates, tetraacrylates, triallylcyanurate, triallylisocyanurate, 3,9-divinyl-2,4,8,10-tetra-oxaspiro[5,5]-undecane (DVS) or triallyl trimellitate (TATM) or any mixtures thereof. The crosslinking booster can be added in an amount of less than 2.0 wt%, preferably of less than 1.5 wt%, more preferably of less than 1.0 wt%, and the lower limit thereof is typically at least 0.05 wt%, preferably of at least 0.1 wt%, based on the weight of the polymer composition.<br>
Scorch retarders (SR) (further described below) as said iii) unsaturated low molecular weight component can also contribute to the total amount of C-C double bonds in the polymer compostion. Suitable scorch retarders include for example unsaturated dimers of aromatic alpha-methyl alkenyl monomers, such as 2,4-di-<br>
phenyl-4-methyl-l-pentene, substituted or unsubstituted diphenylethylene, quinone derivatives, hydroquinone derivatives, monofunctional vinyl containing esters and ethers, or mixtures thereof. More preferably, the scorch retarder is selected from 2,4-diphenyl-4-methyl-l-pentene, substituted or unsubstituted diphenylethylene, or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the amount of scorch retarder is within the range of 0.005 to 2.0 wt.-%, more preferably within the range of 0.005 to 1.5 wt.-%, based on the weight of the Polymer Composition. Further preferred ranges are e.g. from 0.01 to 0.8 wt%, 0.03 to 0.75 wt%, 0.05 to 0.70 wt%, or 0.05 to 0.60 wt%, based on the weight of the Polymer Composition.<br>
In one preferable embodiment, the C-C double bonds present in the Polymer Composition include vinyl groups and the total amount of said vinyl groups is, in the given preference order, of at least 0.05 or more, e.g. 0.1/1000 carbon atoms, preferably 0.2/1000 carbon atoms, 0.3/1000 carbon atoms, at least 0.4/1000 carbon atoms. In embodiments where higher vinyl content is desired the following ranges are preferable in the given preference order, at least 0.5/1000 carbon atoms, at least 0.6/1000 carbon atoms, or of at least 0.7/1000 carbon atoms. The upper limit of said vinyl groups is as defined above for carbon carbon double bonds. Accordingly, the total amount the vinyl groups, if present, contributes to the total amount of C-C double bonds present in the Polymer Composition. When the Polymer Composition contains vinyl groups from one or more of the sources (i) to (iv) as defined above, then the total amount of vinyl groups is the sum of vinyl groups amounting from each of one or more sources (i) to (iv) present in the Polymer Composition.<br>
Preferably the unsaturated polymer of the Polymer Composition of the invention is a copolymer and comprises at least vinyl groups which originate from a polyunsaturated comonomer.<br>
In a further preferable embodiment the MFR2 of the Polymer Composition is from 0.01 to 50 g/10min, more preferably is from 0.1 to 20 g/lOmin, and most preferably is from 0.2 to 10 g/10min.<br>
The Polymer Composition is preferably crosslinkable and is highly suitable for producing crosslinkable articles, preferably one or more crosslinkable layers of a cable, which are subsequently crosslinked.<br>
"Crosslinkable" is a well known expression and means that the Polyolefin Composition can be crosslinked, e.g. via radical formation, to form bridges i.a. amongst the polymer chains.<br>
The free radical generating compound of formula (I) is preferably used as a crosslinking agent and is capable of generating radicals which can initiate a crosslinking reaction.<br>
The Polymer Composition may contain also further additive(s). Such further additive(s) include:<br>
-	The above mentioned crosslinking booster(s) including the given specific compound(s), which can contribute to the crosslinking efficiency and/or to the total amount of C-C double bonds.<br>
-	Preferably one or more scorch retarders (SR) which are defined herein to be compounds that reduce the formation of scorch during extrusion of a polymer composition, at typical extrusion temperatures used, if compared to the same polymer composition extruded without said compound. As mentioned above scorch retardants can also contribute to the total amount of C-C double bonds in the polymer compostion. Preferred SR's and the usable amounts of SR are as given above.<br>
-	Further additive(s), such as antioxidant(s), stabilisers), and/or processing aid(s).<br>
As an antioxidant, sterically hindered or semi-hindered phenol(s), aromatic amiiie(s), aliphatic sterically hindered amine(s), organic phosphate(s), thio compound(s), and mixtures thereof, can be mentioned. As further additive(s), flame<br>
retardant additive(s), water tree retardant additive(s), acid scavenger(s), inorganic filler(s) and voltage stabilizer(s) can be mentioned.<br>
The Polymer Composition may additionally comprise further polymer component(s) including further unsaturated polymer(s) which are different from the at least one unsaturated polymer (component A), and polymer(s) that are not unsaturated.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the Polymer Composition does not contain further polymer components, i.e. it consists of the at least one unsaturated polymer as the sole polymer component. However, it is to be understood herein that the Polymer Composition may comprise further components such as above additives which may be added in a mixture with a carrier polymer, e.g. in so called master batch.<br>
The Polymer Composition can be provided in the form of a powder or pellets in any shape and size including granules. Pellets can be produced, e.g. after polymerisation of the unsaturated polymer, in a well known manner using the conventional pelletising equipment, such as a pelletising extruder. Preferably, the Polymer Composition is provided in the form of pellets.<br>
Preferably, the Polymer Composition comprises, more preferably consists of, the A) unsaturated polymer and the B) compound of formula (I), optionally together with further additive(s), and is in the form of pellets.<br>
Compound of formula (I) as a free radical generating agent (B)<br>
In a preferred embodiment the compound of formula (I) is not diphenylcyclohexyl peroxide.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the compounds of the invention are subject to the proviso that when R2 and R3 together with the carbon atom (C1) to which they are attached form a carbocyclic ring moiety of 3 to 14 C-atoms as defined above, and R2' and R3' together with the carbon atom (C1') to which they are attached form the<br>
carbocyclic ring moiety of 3 to 14 C-atoms as defined above, then R or R ' cannot be an aromatic hydrocarbyl as defined.<br>
The use of the compounds of formula (I) ensures that a reduced amount of a volatile decomposition products is formed during any cross-linking reaction compared to the prior art. Compounds of formula (I) are also believed to be ideal for the cross-linking of unsaturated polymers.<br>
Preferably, the compound of formula (I) as defined above results in CH4 content of less than 300 ppm (weight), preferably of less than 200 ppm (weight), preferably less than 100 ppm (weight), more preferably is without CH4 as a decomposition product thereof, during an industrial process for generating free radicals, e.g. during a modification step of a polymer composition.<br>
Generally, in above and below definitions the given values in ppm for methane and/or other volatile content are determined by gas chromatography from the obtained crosslinked polymer composition as such or from a crosslinked cable layer, depending on the definition, according to a method as described below under "GC-analysis protocol". Accordingly, the produced methane or other volatile content can equally be determined from a crosslinked polymer composition as such or from a crosslinked manufactured article thereof, as desired, each consisting of the polymer composition of the invention. The sample under the test is crosslinked using the test free radical generating agent in such an amount which results in a crosslinking degree expressed as gel content of 50 %, and preferably gel content of at least 50 %. The gel content (%) is measured according to ASTM D2765-01 Method A or B (depending on the nature of the sample). Such a crosslinked sample is then used for preparing the sample for volatile content measurement of GC-analysis protocol.<br>
Without limiting to any theory, the terms "a decomposition produces) thereof or "a decomposition product of a free radical generating step" etc. as used above and below mean herein a by-product(s) formed during a free radical generating step, e.g. crosslinking step, and possibly also during the cooling step, by initiation of the free<br>
radical generating agent, as well known in the art. As an example methane may be one decomposition product which is an undesired decomposition product of the invention. Further decomposition products are specified below, which may not be desired in various embodiments of the invention.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) are preferably without CH4 as a decomposition product thereof. The absence of methane can be determined according to a method described below under "GC-analysis protocol". These compounds of the invention are suitable for embodiments where a high quality of a product which is modified with said compound are desired.<br>
The term "without resulting in CH4 as a decomposition product thereof means that a compound of formula (I) of the present invention generates no methane, or in alternative terms does not decompose to the undesired volatile CH4 by-product during a radical formation step in an industrial process.<br>
The solution of the invention provides a new principal which is surprising and unobvious, since in the prior art there is no teaching or any indication to modify the free radical generating agent in order to avoid formation of CH4 as a decomposing product during the free radical formation step in an industrial process. For example, in crosslinking applications, the prior art has proposed merely solutions relating to balance the amount of free radical generating agent and the needed degree of crosslinking.<br>
In one embodiment said compound of formula (I) of the invention results in reduced amount of or preferably does not decompose to low molecular weight compounds selected from (C1-C3) alkanes when generating free radicals, e.g. in industrial applications.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention it is advantageous that said compound of formula (I) as a free radical generating agent results in reduced amount of or<br>
preferably is without (C1-C4) alkanes as decomposition products thereof when generating free radicals, e.g. in industrial applications.<br>
In embodiments, wherein very high quality is required for the products modified by using a free radical agent, then it is preferable that said compound of formula (I) results in reduced amount of or is preferably without (C1-C6) alkanes as decomposition products thereof during a free radical forming step, e.g. in an industrial process.<br>
The term "a free radical generating agent" is defined herein above or below to be any compound of formula (I) capable of generating radicals, e.g. in industrial applications, e.g. which can initiate a modification reaction in a polymer, such as a crosslinking, grafting or visbreaking reaction in a polymer.<br>

"Hydrocarbon" has the same meaning as given below for "hydrocarbyl" which represents a hydrocarbon as a monovalent substituent.<br>
The terms used for defining the compounds of formula (I) are well known in the organic chemistry.<br>
When the substituents are defined herein as "hydrocarbyl", "aromatic hydrocarbyl", "alkyl" etc. it is evident that they mean "a hydrocarbyl group", "an alkyl group" etc. For the avoidance of doubt, the term "hydrocarbyl" used herein does not encompass aromatic groups as is clear from the definitions used herein. The substituents are referred herein interchangeably as "radical" or "group", as known in the field.<br>
Any hydrocarbyl group of the invention will preferably have up to 40C, atoms, preferably up to 30 C atoms, e.g. up to 20 C atoms, especially up to 12 carbon atoms. Some highly preferred hydrocarbyls may have 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>

The expression "partially unsaturated" means that the moiety may comprise one or more double or triple bonds and include alkenyl radicals comprising at least one double bond and alkynyl radicals comprising at least one triple bond. In case of "partially unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbyl" there can be one or more double bonds in the ring systems meaning that the ring is non-aromatic to differentiate said "partially unsaturated" ring moieties from "aromatic rings" such as phenyl or pyridyl radicals.<br>
"Hetero atoms" present in the moieties of the invention are selected from N, O, P, S or Si. Such moieties include e.g. hydrocarbyl or cyclic hydrocarbyl moieties containing one or more heteroatoms, as defined above and below, and to heteroring or heterocyclic ring moieties as defined above and below, which are understood to contain C-atoms in addition to the heteroatoms.<br>

H, (Cl-C12)alkyl or -NR2, wherein each R is as defined for -NR2; COOR", wherein R" is as defined for -COR". A further functional group is a halogen, such as -F, -CI or -I.<br>
Other preferred functional groups include alkoxy, e.g. OCi.^alkyl, nitro, thiol, thioC1-12alkyl and CN.<br>
The term "optional" means "may or may not be present", e.g. "optionally substituted" cover the possibilities that a substituent is present and or not present. The term "unsubstituted" naturally means that no substituent is present.<br>
When R2 and R3 together with C1 to which they are attached form a ring system as defined above, or respectively, R2 and R3 together with C1 to which they are attached form a ring system as defined above, then, as C'/C1 are folly valenced, it is understood herein that any optional substituents or substituent(s) Z as used above and below means substituents linked to ring atom(s) other than C1 and C1, respectively.<br>
In compounds (I), when R2 and R3 form together with C! an aromatic ring as defined above, then R1 is not present, and, respectively, when R2' and R3' form<br>
together with C1' an aromatic ring, as defined above, then R1' is not present. Preferably however R2 and R3 togedier with C1 and R2' and R3' together with C1' do not form an aromatic ring.<br>
By functional derivative of compounds of formula (I) means that at least one of R1, R2, R3, R1', R2', R3' is in form of functional derivative.

The amount of the compound of formula (I) used as a free radical generating agent (B) in the Polymer Compostion is not critical and can vary depending on the desired crosslinking degree and the type of the crosslinkable polymer. As an example only, the amount of compound of formula (I) may be less than 10.0 wt%, less than 6.0 wt%, less than 5.0 wt%, less than 3.5 wt%, e.g. between 0.1 to 3.0 wt%, such as 0.2 to 2.6 wt%, based on the weight of the polymer composition. Factors affecting the amount of free radical generating agent (B) in the Polymer composition include the molecular weight of Compound of formula (1) and the desired degree of crosslinking.<br>
Preparation of the compounds of formula (I)<br>
The compounds of the invention include novel and known compounds. The use of the known compounds as a free radical generating agent, preferably for modifying a polymer composition, is novel. Thus said known compounds may be commercially available. Alternatively, the compounds of the invention can be prepared according to or analogously to known methods described in the chemical literature.<br>

Thus for example, a tertiary alcohol can be converted to a tertiary halide and reacted with hydrogen peroxide, perhaps in the presence of a promoter such as silver trifluoroacetate and a non nucleophilic base such as sodium hydrocarbonate to form a teriary hydroperoxide. The tertiary hydroperoxide can then be reacted with the a tertiary bromide (perhaps the same as used earlier in the reaction or optionally a difference tertiary bromide) to form the final diperoxide materials of formula (I). Again, a promoter such as silver trifluoroacetate/NaHC03 might be used. These reactions are summarised in the scheme below:<br>

The unsaturated LDPE, preferably unsaturated LDPE copolymer, of the Polymer Composition is preferably produced at high pressure by radical polymerisation. High pressure polymerisation can be effected in a tubular reactor or an autoclave reactor. Preferably, it is a tubular reactor. When preparing the unsaturated LDPE copolymer in a high pressure process, polymerization is generally performed at a pressure of 100 to 400 MPa and a temperature of 150 to 350°C. The MFR can be adjusted using, for example, a chain transfer agent during the polymerisation, or by adjusting reaction temperature or pressure. The unsaturation, preferably C-C double bond content, can be adjusted by the polymerisation conditions, by polymerising the ethylene together with, for example, a polyunsaturated comonomer, chain transfer agent, or both.  The feed ratio between C2 and polyunsaturated comonomer and/or chain transfer agent can be used to manipulate the amount of C-C double bonds present in the unsaturated LDPE copolymer. Preferably, at least the polyunsaturated comonomer is used for providing the unsaturation, preferably C-C double bonds. The high pressure polymerisation and the adjustment of process conditions to provide a desired MFR and unsaturation, preferably C-C double bond content, are known and described in the literature.<br>
The unsaturated polymer (A) of the Polymer Composition of invention can be prepared using i.a. any conventional polymerisation process and equipment, the conventional means as described above for providing unsaturation in order to control and adjust the process conditions to achieve the desired unsaturation, preferably C-C double bond content, of the polymerised polymer. The double bond content can be further tailored depending on the desired embodiment. The unsaturated LDPE polymer as defined above, preferably the unsaturated LDPE copolymer, of the Polymer Composition is preferably produced in high pressure by free radical initiated polymerisation (referred to as high pressure radical polymerization). The usable high pressure polymerisation (HP) and the adjustment of process conditions are well known and described in the literature, and can readily be used by a skilled person to provide the above inventive balance. High pressure polymerisation can be effected in a tubular reactor or an autoclave reactor, preferably in a tubular reactor. One preferable HP process is described below for polymerising ethylene optionally together with one or more comonomer(s), preferably at least with one or more polyunsaturated comonomer(s), in a tubular reactor to obtain a LDPE homopolymer or copolymer as defined above. The process can be adapted to other polymers as well: Compression:<br>
Ethylene is fed to a compressor mainly to enable handling of high amounts of ethylene at controlled temperature. The compressors are usually a piston compressor or diaphragm compressors. The compressor is usually a series of compressors that can work in series or in parallel. Most common is 2-5 compression steps. Recycled ethylene and comonomers can be added at feasible points depending on the pressure. Temperature is typically low, usually in the range of less than 200°C or less than 100°C.<br>
Tubular reactor:<br>
The mixture is fed to the tube reactor. First part of the tube is to adjust the temperature of the feed ethylene; usual temperature is 150-170°C. Then the radical initiator is added. As the radical initiator, any compound or a mixture thereof that decomposes to radicals at an elevated temperature can be used. Usable radical initiators are commercially available. The polymerization reaction is exothermic.<br>
There can be several radical initiator injections points, e.g. 1-5 points or more, usually provided with separate injection pumps. There can also be additional monomer and/or comonomer injection points, e.g. 1-5 points or more, with separate compressors. The reactor is continuously cooled e.g. by water or steam. The highest temperature is called peak temperature and the lowest temperature is called radical initiator temperature.<br>
Suitable temperatures range from 80 to 350°C and pressure from 100 to 400 MPa. Pressure can be measured at least in compression stage and after the tube. Temperature can measured at several points during all steps. Using various temperature profiles selected by a person skilled in the art will allow control of structure of polymer chain, i.e. Long Chain Branching and Short Chain branching, density, branching factor, distribution of comonomers, MFR, viscosity, Molecular Weight Distribution etc. E.g. the MFR of the unsaturated LDPE polymer (A), preferably unsaturated LDPE copolymer, can be adjusted by using e.g. chain transfer agent during the polymerisation, or by adjusting reaction temperature or pressure. The reactor ends conventionally with a valve. The valve regulates reactor pressure and depressurizes the reaction mixture from reaction pressure to separation pressure.<br>
Separation:<br>
The pressure is typically reduced to approx 35 MPa (40 MPa) bars or below. The polymer is separated gaseous products such as unreacted monomer and unreacted optional comonomer(s) and most of the unreacted gaseous products are recovered. Normally low molecular compounds, i.e. wax, are removed from the gas. The pressure can further be lowered to recover and recycle the unused gaseous products such as ethylene. The gas is usually cooled and cleaned before recycling.<br>
Then the obtained polymer melt is normally pressurized mixed and pelletized. Preferably additives can be added in the mixer. Further details of the production of ethylene (co)polymers by high pressure radical polymerization can be found in in WO 93/08222, WO 9635732 and the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Vol. 6 (1986), pp 383-410.<br>
When the unsaturated LDPE copolymer of the invention is prepared, then, as well known, the unsaturation, preferably C-C double bond content, can be adjusted by polymerising the ethylene e.g. in the presence of one or more polyunsaturated comonomer(s), chain transfer agent(s), or both, using the desired feed ratio between C2 and polyunsaturated comonomer and/or chain transfer agent, depending on the nature and amount of C-C double bonds desired for the unsaturated LDPE copolymer. I.a. WO 9308222 describes a high pressure radical polymerisation of ethylene with polyunsaturated monomers, such as an α,- alkadienes, to increase the unsaturation of an ethylene copolymer. The non-reacted double bond(s) thus provides pendant vinyl groups to the formed polymer chain at the site, where the polyunsaturated comonomer was incorporated by polymerization. As a result the unsaturation can be uniformly distributed along the polymer chain in random copolymerisation manner. Also e.g. WO 9635732 describes high pressure radical polymerisation of ethylene and a certain type of polyunsaturated α,-divinylsiloxanes. Moreover, as known, propylene can be used as a chain transfer agent to provide said double bonds, whereby it can also partly be copolymerised with ethylene.<br>
The alternative unsaturated LDPE homopolymer may be produced analogously using process conditions as for the unsaturated LDPE copolymer, except that ethylene is polymerised in the presence of a chain transfer agent only.<br>

The most preferred range is from 0.915 to 0.930 g/cm3.<br>
Further preferably, the unsaturated copolymer, preferably the LDPE copolymer, of the Polymer Composition may contain comonomer(s) in a total amount of up to 30 wt%, e.g. of from 0.05 to 25 wt.-%, or more preferably from 0.1 to 15 wt.-%, based on the amount of the unsaturated polymer component (A).<br>

2 Preparation process of an article<br>
The present invention further provides a process for producing an article by using said polymer composition of the invention.<br>
2.2. Preparation process of a cable<br>
A preferable embodiment of the process for preparing an article of the invention is a process for producing a cable comprising steps of applying, preferably by (co)extrusion, one or more layers on a conductor, which layers comprise a polymer composition, wherein at least one layer comprises said polymer composition of the invention.<br>
The term "(co)extrusion" means herein that in case of two or more layers, said layers can be extruded in separate steps, or at least two or all of said layers can be coextruded in a same extrusion step, as well known in the art.<br>
In said process of the invention the components of a layer material are mixed in a separate mixer before introducing to the extruder for producing said layers or are added directly to an extruder and mixed therein before forming to a layer. Additives and further components can be added during the mixing step. The mixture in extruder is subjected to an elevated temperature, typically above the melting point of<br>
the polymer components and then (co)extruded on a conductor in a manner very well known in the field. E.g. conventional extruders and mixers may be used in the process of the invention.<br>
A polymer powder, polymer pellets or melt, which comprise said polymer composition of the invention, can each equally be used in said process for preparing cables and they can be prepared prior their use in the cable preparation step or they can be prepared directly in a cable production line during a cable manufacturing process. Accordingly, 1) preformed powder or pellets of a polymer composition of the invention may be subjected to the cable production line; or 2) said compound of formula (I) may be added together with pellets or powder of the unsaturated polymer in a mixing step before forming the cable layer(s). Such mixing step can be a separate step in a separate mixing device arranged in the cable production line to precede the cable layer formation step, e.g. an extrusion step. Alternatively, the compound of formula (I) can be added during the layer formation step e.g. in an extruder, whereby it can be introduced to the extruder together with or after the addition of polymer powder or polymer pellets. The addition point in an extruder is not limited, whereby the compound of formula (I) can be added at the inlet of the extruder or at a later feed point arranged along the extruder. Accordingly the addition of compound of formula (I) may take place at the time the polymer material is in solid non-molten, partly molten or molten state, i.e. a melt mixture. The obtained molten mixture of a layer material is then (co)extruded on to a conductor to form a cable layer. In a preferred cable preparation process of the invention a low voltage cable or, more preferably, a power cable of the invention as defined above under 1.1, cable is produced. The obtained cable can be further processed for the end use application.<br>

Preferably said crosslinking step (C1) is carried out without producing methane as a decomposition product of said crosslinking step.<br>

The cooling is effected in a cooling zone, which may be optionally integrated with the preceding crosslinking zone, e.g. in a known vulcanization tube. As an example only, continuous catenary vulcanization (CCV) tube can be mentioned. The temperature at the layer closest to conductor is typically below 200°C, e.g. 160-190°C, at the beginning of the cooling zone/step. The pressure during the cooling step of the invention is typically kept above atmospheric pressure, e.g. up to 20 bar, preferably up to 13 bar, such as 10-12 bar. The cable is removed from the pressurized cooling step, when the temperature of the cable layers is clearly below the melting point of the polymer layer material thereof. Accordingly, the crosslinked<br>
cable of the invention may leave the pressurized cooling step of the invention e.g. when the temperature of the conductor of said cable is below 110°C depending on the layer polymer material, preferably between 70-90°C, at the exit of the pressurized cooling zone.<br>
The crosslinking and cooling step is normally carried out under pressurized conditions to prevent the formation of voids due to volatile decomposition products of e.g. peroxides. In a preferable embodiment of the crosslinking process of the invention thus enables to remove the crosslinked and cooled cable from the pressurized cooling zone in a temperature higher than in the prior art, when measured from the conductor. Also preferably, the cooling may be effect at lower pressures compared to prior art.<br>
Optionally, if desired, the crosslinked cable of the invention may be subjected to an additional non-pressurised cooling step after said pressurized cooling step, for further cooling of the cable.<br>
The cable preparation process of the invention optionally comprises a further recovering step of the cable coming from the cooling step. Recovering may be effected by winding the cable on a cable drum in a known manner.<br>
In a further embodiment of the process of the invention the cable obtained from the cooling step and optionally recovered, e.g. wound to a cable drum, may optionally be subjected, if needed in some applications, to a subsequent degassing step i.a. for removing or reducing any volatile decomposition products possibly resulting from said crosslinking step of the invention. In said degassing step the cable of the invention is preferably exposed either in ambient or elevated temperature for a period of time. As an example only, said degassing temperature may be e.g. 50-80°C, for a time period of one to four weeks. In one embodiment of the crosslinking process said degassing step may be shortened considerably or even avoided due to decreased level of said volatile by-products.<br>
The cable of the invention produced by the above process of the invention may finally be further processed, e.g. protected with a protective layer, and/or optionally covered by a jacketing layer in a subsequent finishing step in a known manner and recovered for the end use thereof.<br>
The invention thus provides also a crosslinked cable comprising a crosslinked polymer composition as defined above, preferably a crosslinked low voltage cable or power cable, more preferably a crosslinked power cable, as defined above. Preferably said crosslinked cable is obtainable by any of the crosslinking process as defined above.<br>
In one embodiment of a crosslinking process of the invention a crosslinked power cable is produced which is selected from a crosslinked MV cable, wherein the lowest degree of crosslinking in a cable layer(s) meets the requirements as specified in IEC 60502, or a crosslinked HV cable, wherein the lowest degree of crosslinking in a cable layer(s) meets the requirements as specified in IEC 60840, which specifications are well known in the Wire &amp; Cable field.<br>
The advantageous compositions of the invention contain free radical generating agents which can be used for improving the quality of the products, e.g. in cable production processes. Due to the present invention the amount of voids in polymer products, such as cable layers can be reduced or even avoided, since less or no volatile decomposition products are formed. Moreover, the invention also enables improvement in the processability of a cable, i.a. in terms of safer and faster processing. E.g. the crosslinking process of the invention can be faster and/or more economical, since both cooling and/or degassing steps may be carried out in a reduced time and/or in a less energy consuming manner, if desired.<br>
Determination methods<br>
Unless otherwise stated the below determination methods were used to determine the properties defined generally in the description part and claims and in the experimental part.<br>
Melt Flow Rate<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is indicated in g/10 min. The MFR is an indication of the flowability, and hence the processability, of the polymer. The higher the melt flow rate, the lower the viscosity of the polymer. The MFR is determined at 190 °C for polyethylenes and may be determined at different loadings such as 2.16 kg (MFR2) or 21.6 kg (MFR21). The MFR is determined at 230 °C for polypropylenes.<br>
Density<br>
The density was measured according to ISO 1183D. The sample preparation was executed according to ISO 1872-2.<br>
Amount of double bonds in the Polymer Composition or in the unsaturated polymer<br>
This method applies both for the Polymer Composition and for the unsaturated polymer (A). Both are referred below as a Composition or a polymer, respectively. The procedure for the determination of the amount of double bonds/1000 C-atoms is based upon the ASTM D3124-72 method. In that method, a detailed description for the determination of vinylidene groups/1000 C-atoms is given based on 2,3-dimethyl-1,3 -butadiene. The described sample preparation procedure has also been applied for the determination of vinyl groups/1000 C-atoms, vinylidene groups/1000 C-atoms and trans-vinylene groups/1000 C-atoms in the present invention. However, for the determination of the extinction coefficient for these three types of double bonds, the following three compounds have been used: 1-decene for vinyl, 2-methyl-1-heptene for vinylidene and trans-4-decene for trans-vinylene, and the procedure as described in ASTM-D3124 section 9 was followed. The total amount of double bonds was analysed by means of IR spectrometry and given as the amount of vinyl bonds, vinylidene bonds and frans-vinylene bonds per 1000 carbon atoms.<br>
The composition or polymer to be analysed were pressed to thin films with a thickness of 0.5-1.0 mm. The actual thickness was measured. FT-IR analysis was performed on a Perkin Elmer 2000. Four scans were recorded with a resolution of 4 cm"1.<br>
A base line was drawn from 980 cm-1 to around 840 cm-1. The peak heights were determined at around 888 cm-1 for vinylidene, around 910 cm-1 for vinyl and around 965 cm-1 for trans-vinylene. The amount of double bonds/1000 carbon atoms was calculated using the following formulas:<br>
vinylidene/1000 C-atoms = (14 x A)/(18.24 x L x D)<br>
vinyl/1000 C-atoms = (14 x A)/(13.13 x L x D)<br>
trans-vinylene/1000 C-atoms = (14 x A)/(15.14 x L x D)<br>
wherein<br>
A: absorbance (peak height)<br>
L: film thickness in mm<br>
D: density of the material (g/cm3)<br>
The amount of vinyl groups originating from the polyunsaturated comonomer per 1000 carbon atoms was determined and calculated as follows: The polymer to be analysed and a reference polymer have been produced on the same reactor, basically using the same conditions, i.e. similar peak temperatures, pressure and production rate, but with the only difference that the polyunsaturated comonomer is added to polymer to be analysed and not added to reference polymer. The total amount of vinyl groups of each polymer was determined by FT-IR measurements, as described above. Then, it is assumed that the base level of vinyl groups, i.e. the ones formed by the process and from chain transfer agents resulting in vinyl groups (if present), is the same for the reference polymer and the polymer to be analysed with the only exception that in the polymer to be analysed also a polyunsaturated comonomer is added to the reactor. This base level is then subtracted from the measured amount of vinyl groups in the polymer to be analysed, thereby resulting in the amount of vinyl groups/1000 C-atoms, which result from the polyunsaturated comonomer.<br>
Calibration procedure for measuring the double bond content of an unsaturated low molecular weight compound (iii). if present (referred below as Compound)<br>
The molar absorptivity for Compound (e.g. a crosslinking booster or a scorch retarder compound as exemplified in the descritpion part) can be determined according to ASTM D6248-98. At least three solutions of the Compound in CS2 (carbon disulfide) are prepared. The used concentrations of the solutions are close to 0.18 mol/1. The solutions are analysed with FTIR and scanned with resolution 4 cm"1 in a liquid cell with path length 0.1 mm. The maximum intensity of the absorbance peak that relates to the unsaturated moiety of the Compound(s) (each type of carbon-carbon double bonds present) is measured.<br>
The molar absorptivity. B, in litres/molxmm for each solution and type of double bond is calculated using the following equation: B = ( 1 / CD x A<br>
C = concentration of each type of carbon-carbon double bond to be measured, mol/1 L = cell thickness, mm<br>
A = maximum absorbance (peak height) of the peak of each type of carbon-carbon double bond to be measured, mol/1.<br>
The average of the molar absorptivity. B. for each type of double bond is calculated. The average molar absorptivity. B. of each type of carbon-carbon double bond can then be used for the calculation of the concentration of double bonds in the reference polymer and the polymer samples to be analysed.<br>

GC-Analysis protocol<br>
In definitions of the Compounds, Polymer compositions, cables and preparation process and modification methods thereof as defined above and in claims below, the volatile, e.g. CH4, content given in ppm (weight) or as "absent" is determined by gas chromatography (GC) from a sample which is modified, e.g. crosslinked.<br>
The test is used to determine the produced volatiles, e.g. methane, content of a free radical generating agent. The test free radical generating agent is used in such an amount with which a crosslinking degree expressed as gel content of SO % was achieved, preferably gel content of at least 50%. Crosslinking conditions of the sample are not critical and may be effected e.g. as described below under "Preparation of samples, crosslinking"<br>
Volatiles are measured by taking a sample specimen of 1 g with a thickness of 1.5 mm from a modified, e.g. crosslinked composition, e.g. a plaque or cable. In the case of a cable comprising a crosslinked layer(s), the sample specimen is taken from a layer material of a crosslinked and cooled cable sample that is taken at the exit of a crosslinking/cooling zone, such as at the exit of a vulcanisation tube, after pressurised cooling step in a manner known for a skilled person.<br>
The collection of volatiles from said sample specimen (to a head space bottle, see below) is started within one hour after the modification step is stopped, or in case of a crosslinked and cooled cable, within one hour after the cable sample is taken at the exit of a crosslinking/cooling zone.<br>
A sample specimen of a thickness of 1.5 mm and of a weight of 1 g is cut from the middle of a plaque which is 100 mm wide and 100 mm long. The obtained sample (specimen) is placed in a 120 ml head space bottle with an aluminium crimp cup with seal and heat treated at 60 ° C for 1.5 h for collecting any gaseous volatiles present in said sample. Then 0.3-0.5 ml of the gas captured in the sample bottle is<br>
injected into a gas chromatograph, wherein the presence and content of the volatiles, e.g. methane, which are desired to be measured in a known manner. Double samples are analysed and a "zero-sample" without free radical generating agent/modification is used as a reference.

Preparation example of the crosslinked cable of the invention:<br>
A power cable comprising an inner semiconductive layer, an insulation layer and an<br>
outer semiconductive layer for experimental testing is prepared by coextruding on a<br>
conductor said layers in given order using a conventional extruder line and<br>
conventional extrusion conditions.<br>
The layer materials are conventional polymer grades and each layer comprises a<br>
peroxide compound of the invention as a crosslinking agent.<br>
The semiconductive material used in the cable, both as inner and outer semicon, is a<br>
poly(ethylene-co-butylacrylate) polymer (with a butylacrylate content of 17wt%)<br>
containing 40 wt% of a furnace black. The composition is stabilised with an<br>
antioxidant of the polyquinoline type and contains 1 wt% of the peroxide of the<br>
invention as a crosslinking agent.<br>
The middle insulation layer is formed of low density polyethylene LDPE (MFR2=2 g/10 min) containing 2 wt-% of the peroxide of the invention and 0.2 wt-% of 4,4'-thiobis(2-tert.-butyl-5-methylphenol).<br>
The obtained cable is immediately after extrusion subjected to a conventional vulcanisation tube and crosslinked in a known manner using well known crosslinking conditions. After crosslinking the cable is then cooled in cooling zone of said vulcanisation tube at a desired pressure and temperature. The cooling step is stopped when the desired temperature measured from the conductor is achieved. Typically the cooling step can be effected in a lower pressure and/or the cooling step can be stopped in a higher temperature at conductor compared to corresponding cable crosslinked to a same gel content, but using dicumylperoxide as the crosslinking agent. The crosslinked and cooled layer is wound to a cable drum and transferred to a degassing step to remove the volatile(s) content, if any. This step can typically be done in a lower temperature and/or a shorter period compared to corresponding cable crosslinked to a same gel content, but using dicumylperoxide as the crosslinking agent.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
