SOLID  DISPERSIONS   COMPRISING  TACROLIMUS<br>
The present invention relates to a solid disperion comprising tacroiimus or an analogue thereof and having enhanced bioavailabiiity, more specifically a solid solution or dispersion of tacroiimus in a hydrophilic vehicle; a pharmaceutical composition comprising the solid solution or dispersion; and dosage forms comprising the solid solution or dispersion.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tacroiimus, also known as FK-506 or FR-900506, has the chemical tricyciic structure shown below:<br><br>
corresponding to C44H69NO12. Tacroiimus appears in the form of white crystals or<br>
crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in ethanol and very soluble in methanol and chloroform.<br>
The preparation of tacroiimus is described in EP-A-0 184 162 and analogues of tacroiimus are disclosed e.g. in EP-A-0 444 659 and US 6,387,918, which are both hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Tacroiimus is a macrolide compound with useful immunosuppressive activity, antimicrobial activity and other pharmacological activities and is of value for the treatment or prevention of rejection reactions by transplantation of organs or tissues, graft versus host diseases, autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases. Tacroiimus prolongs the survival of the host and transplanted graft in animal transplant models of liver, kidney, heart, bone marrow and small bowel and pancreas, lung and trachea, skin, cornea and limb.<br>
In animals, tacroiimus has been demonstrated to suppress some humoral immunity<br><br>
and, to a greater extent, cell-mediated reactions such as allograft rejection, delayed type hypersensitivity, collagen-induced arthritis, experimental allergic encephalomyeiitis and graft-versus-host disease.<br>
Tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation, although the exact mechanism of action is unknown. Experimental evidence suggest that tacrolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12. A complex of tacrolimus-FKBP-12, calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin is then formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin inhibited. This effect may prevent the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells, a nuclear component thought to initiate gene transcription for the formation of lymphokines. The net result is the inhibition of T-lymphocyte activation, i.e. immunosupression.<br>
Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme in the gut wall and liver. Therefore, drugs that affect this isoenzyme may influence absorption and the subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed tacrolimus. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase tacrolimus levels, while inducers of CYP3A4 may increase the metabolism of tacrolimus and decrease tacrolimus levels. Accordingly, tacrolimus may be administered together with one or more CYP3A4 inhibitors in order to improve the overall bioavailability.<br>
Usually tacrolimus is administered orally and is therefore absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It has been observed that the absorption is negatively influenced by the simultaneous ingestion of food. Thus, the rate and extent of tacrolimus absorption were greatest under fasted conditions.<br>
In general, it is known that the absorption and bioavailability of a therapeutically active substance can be affected by a variety of factors when administered orally. Such factors include the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract and, in general, the gastric residence time of a drug substance is significantly longer in the presence of food than in the fasted state. If the bioavailability of a drug substance is affected beyond a certain point due to the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the drug substance is said to exhibit a food effect. Food effects are important because absorption and hence the plasma levels becomes highly variable depending on food intake. Absorption into the bloodstream may be adversely affected to the point that the patient risks insufficient absorption to remedy the condition for which the drug was administered. On the other hand, the very high peak concentrations seen at fasted conditions occasionally, may very well induce significant side effects, of nephro- or neuro-toxic origin, as well as Gl side-effects and others.<br>
Absorption of tacrolimus from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration is rapid with a mean time-to-peak concentration (W) of approximately 1-2 hours after administration to healthy subjects or kidney or liver transplanted patients, but incomplete and variable. The bioavailability is generally as low as at the most about 20% after oral administration.<br><br>
Frequently observed side effects are vomiting and nausea but side effects like tremor, headache, hypertension, renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesaemia, hyperglycemia, insomnia, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity are also observed.<br>
For oral administration, tacrolimus is currently formulated and marketed as soft gelatine capsules comprising the equivalent of 0.5, 1 or 5 mg anhydrous tacrolimus and marketed under the trade name Prograf® and Protropic®. The recommended initial oral dose is from about 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg/day in patients. The dose aims at a certain trough plasma level from about 5 to about 20 ng/ml. Prograf® is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving allogeneic liver or kidney transplants.<br>
There remains a need for novel pharmaceutical compositions and/or dosage forms comprising tacrolimus exhibiting enhanced bioavailability. An increased bioavailability may allow a reduction in the dosage units taken by a patient, e.g. down to a single dose daily, and may also reduce or negate the need for food to be takes simultaneously with the dosage form thereby allowing patients more freedom on when the drug is taken. Furthermore, it is contemplated that fluctuations in the plasma concentration versus time profile may be significantly reduced. Further, enhanced bioavailability may also result in a more reproducible (i.e. less variable compared to that of Prograf®) release profile.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors have now found that the bioavailability of tacrolimus can be significantly enhanced by dispersing or dissolving tacrolimus in a hydrophilic or water-miscible vehicle in an amount which is efficient for use in the preparation of a useful drug dosage form. Tacrolimus is known to have a very low solubility in water, but this invention provides pharmaceutical compositions and formulations exhibiting very fast in vitro release profiles, i.e. immediate release compositions which are contemplated having significantly increased in vivo bioavailability in patients in need thereof.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect the present invention relates to a solid dispersion comprising an active ingredient selected among tacrolimus and analogues thereof dispersed or dissolved in a hydrophilic or water-miscible vehicle, wherein the melting point of the vehicle is at least 20°C and the active ingredient is present therein in a concentration of between about 0.01 w/w% and as much as up to about 15 w/w% to form a solid dispersion or solid solution at ambient temperature. It is believed, that this dispersion is capable of releasing at least 50 w/w% of the amount of tacrolimus within about 30 minutes, when tested in any dissolution test according to USP using an aqueous dissolution medium.<br><br>
In a further aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the solid dispersion and/or solution of tacrolimus and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, which may be fillers, disintegrants, binders or lubricants. In yet another aspect, the invention relates to dosage forms such as solid oral unit dosage forms comprising the solid dispersion and/or solution of tacrolimus, pharmaceuticaliy acceptable excipients and optionally pharmaceutically acceptable additive such as flavoring agents, coloring agents, taste-masking agents, pH-adjusting agents, buffering agents, preservatives, stabilizing agents, anti-oxidants, wetting agents, humidity-adjusting agents, surface-active agents, suspending agents, absorption enhancing agents and release modifying agents. Especially, the present invention relates to a dosage form comprising tacrolimus and release-modifying agents, especially dosage forms having dealyed release such as solid oral unit dosage forms including enteric coating. Delaying the release of tacrolimus to the distal part of duodenum may reduce the drug related gastro-intestinal related side effects and the relatively high degree of metabolism in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract (CYP3A4 mediated metabolism). Owing to the novel solid dispersion and/or solution according to this invention, this is done without loosing systemic bioavailability.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions<br>
As used herein, the term "active ingredient" or "active pharmaceutical ingredient" means any component that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals. The term includes those components that may undergo chemical change in the manufacture of the drug product and are present in the drug product in a modified form intended to furnish the specified activity or effect.<br>
In the present context, the term "hydrophilic11 describes that something 'likes water1, i.e. a hydrophilic molecule or portion of a molecule is one that typically is electrically polarized and capable of forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules, enabling it dissolve more readily in water than in oil or other "non-polar" solvents.<br>
In the present context, the term "amphiphilic" describes a molecule (as a surfactant) having a polar water-soluble group attached to a water-insoluble hydrocarbon chain. Thus, one end of the molecule is hydrophilic (polar) and the other is hydrophobic (non-polar).<br>
As used herein, the term "vehicle" means any solvent or carrier fluid in a pharmaceutical product that has no pharmacological role. For example, water is the vehicle for xilocaine and propylene glycol is the vehicle for many antibiotics.<br><br>
In the present context, the term "solid dispersion" denotes a drug or active ingredient or substance dispersed on a particulate level in an inert vehicle, carrier, diluent or matrix in the solid state, i.e. usually a fine particulate dispersion.<br>
In the present context, the term "solid solution" denotes a drug or active ingredient or substance dissolved on a moiecuiar level in an inert vehicle, carrier, diluent or matrix in the solid state.<br>
As used herein, the term "analogue" means a chemical compound that is structurally simitar to another.<br>
The term "drug" means a compound intended for use in diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals.<br>
In this context, the term "dosage form" means the form in which the drug is delivered to the patient. This could be parenteral, topical, tablet, oral (liquid or dissolved powder), suppository, inhalation, transdermal, etc.<br>
As used herein, the term "bioavailability" denotes the degree means to which a drug or other substance becomes available to the target tissue after administration. As used herein, the term "bioequivaiency" denotes a scientific basis on which generic and brand name drugs are compared with one another. For example, drugs are bioequivalent if they enter circulation at the same rate when given in similar doses under similar conditions. Parameters often used in bioequivalence studies are tmax, cmax, AUCwniinityi AUC0-t- Other relevant parameters may be W5Ol W75 and/or MRT. Accordingly, at least one of these parameters may be applied when determining whether bioequivaience is present. Furthermore, in the present context, two compositions are regarded as bioequivalent if the value of the parameter used is within 80-125% of that of Prograf® or a similar commercially available tacrolimus-containing product used in the test.<br>
In the present context "tmax" denotes the time to reach the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) after administration; AUC0-mnntty denotes the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity; AUCD-t denotes the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 to time t; W5o denotes the time where the plasma concentration is 50% or more.of Cmax; W75 denotes the time where the plasma concentration is 75% or more of Cmax; and MRT denotes mean residence time for tacrolimus (and/or an analogue thereof).<br>
In this context, the term "medicine" means a compound used to treat disease, injury or pain. Medicine is justly distributed into "prophylactic," i.e. the art of preserving health, and "therapeutic", i.e. the art of restoring health.<br>
As used herein, the term "delayed release" means a release profile of a drug from a pharmaceutical composition or formulation which, in relation to the immediate release profile,<br><br>
has an unchanged Cmax, but simply a lag time from the time of administration until drug release. Accordingly, tma&gt;: is delayed, and t% is usually unchanged.<br>
In this context, the term "erosion" or "eroding" means a gradual breakdown of the surface of a material or structure, for example of a tablet or the coating of a tablet.<br>
Solid dispersion and/or solid solution of tacrolimus<br>
The solid dispersion of the invention comprises an active ingredient selected among tacroiimus and analogues thereof, which ingredient is dispersed or dissolved in a hydrophilic or water-miscible vehicle having a melting point (freezing point or pour point) of at least 20°C in a concentration of between about 0.01 w/w% and about 15 w/w%, and which dispersion is forming a solid dispersion or solid solution at ambient temperature (room temperature).<br>
The active ingredient is preferably tacrolimus or any analogue or derivative of tacrolimus, which exhibits either a pharmacological or a therapeutical activity, which is at least equivalent to that of tacrolimus (FK-506 or FR-900506). However, within the scope of the present invention is tacrolimus in any physical form (crystals, amorphous powder, any possible polymorphs, any possible solvates including the hydrate, anhydrate, complexes thereof etc.). Included is also any analogue, derivative or active metabolite of tacrolimus, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, complexes and prodrugs thereof.<br>
The concentration of the active ingredient in the hydrophilic or water-miscible vehicle is at the most 15w/w%? preferably at the most 10w/w%, preferably at the most 8w/w%, more preferably at the most 6w/w%, even more preferably at the most 5w/w%, at the most 4%w/w, especially at the most 3w/w%i in particular at the most 2% w/w; and/or is at least about 0.05w/w%, preferably at least about 0.1w/w%, more preferably at least about 0.5w/w%, especially at least about 0.7w/w%, in particular at least about 1w/w%.<br>
Physically, the combination of active ingredient and vehicle may either form a solid dispersion, i.e. the active ingredient is dispersed in the vehicle in particulate form, or may form a solid solution, i.e. the active ingredient is dissolved in the vehicle at a molecular level. The active ingredient and the vehicle may also form a solid dispersion having therein a part of the active ingredient dissolved at a molecular levet. The physical state of the dispersion and/or solution may be determined by using various techniques such as Hot Stage Microscopy (HSM)f Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) optionally in combination with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), and X-ray powder diffraction. In a preferred embodiment, the active ingredient is fully dissolved in the vehicle to form a solid solution at ambient temperature.<br>
Increasing the bioavailability, the Area Under the Curve (AUC), will normally reduce the intra- and inter- variability related to absorption of a drug substance. This is particularly true; whenever the low and impaired bioavailability is a consequence of poor water solubility.<br><br>
It-is contemplated that compositions according to the invention will provide a CV (Coefficient of Variation) on AUC data having a significantly lesser value than that of Prograf® and like products.<br>
As mentioned hereinbefore, one of the basic features of the present invention is that it is possible to obtain an improvement in the bioavailability by oral administration of a composition of the present invention. Normally, a low bioavailability of a drug substance after oral administration is a barrier for design of a controlled or modified release composition of the drug substance due to the fact that it is almost impossible to obtain effective drug levels over a prolonged period of time. However, with the present technology it is possible to obtain a significantly improved bioavailabiiity and thereby possible to design for example delayed release compositions.<br>
The sofid dispersion of the invention exhibits a very fast immediate release of tacrolimus, when a composition comprising the dispersion or solution is tested in a dissolution test according to USP using an aqueous dissolution medium, and at least 50 w/w% of the active pharmaceutical ingredient is released within about 30 minutes, preferably within 20 minutes, more preferably within 15 minutes; such as at least 75 w/w% of the active pharmaceutical ingredient is released within about 40 minutes, or even better at least 90 w/w% of the active pharmaceutical ingredient is released within about 60 minutes, preferably within 45 minutes. For example, the test may be carried out according to the any method and any specifications cited in USP. Thus, the dissolution test may be carried out in an aqueous dissolution medium at a neutral or near-neutral pH, for example at pH 6.8, or at any acidic pH simulating the pH conditions in the gastrointestinal tract. However, variations with respect to the specific method employed and the ingredients contained in the dissolution medium etc. are within the scope of the present invention. A person skilled in the art will know how to carry out a suitable dissolution test e.g. with guidance from USP, Ph.Eur. and the like. Suitable conditions for the in vitro dissolution test are employing USP dissolution test (paddle method) and a buffer pH 7,5 containing 2.5% SDS and 1g/mL of pancreatin as dissolution medium.<br>

Examples of useful hydrophilic or water-miscible vehicles to be used according to this invention are selected from the group consisting of polyethylene glycols, polyoxyethylene oxides, poloxamers, polyoxyethylene stearates, poly-epsilon caprolactone, polyglycolized glycerides such as Geiucire®, and mixtures thereof.<br>
It is also contemplated that certain amphiphilic vehicles may be useful in the present invention, including those vehicles disclosed herein which may be amphiphilic in addition to being water-miscible.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the vehicle is a polyethylene glycol (PEG), in particular a PEG having an average molecular weight of at least 1500, preferably at least 3000, more preferably at least 4000, especially at least 6000. The polyethylene glycol may advantageously be mixed with one or more other hydrophilic or water-miscible vehicles, for example a poloxamer, preferably in a proportion (on a weight/weight basis) of between 1:3 and 10:1, preferably between 1:1 and 5:1, more preferably between and 3:2 4:1, especially between 2:1 and 3:1, in particular about 7:3. A specific example of a useful mixture is a mixture of PEG6000 and poloxamer 188 in the ratio 7:3.<br>
For polyethylene glycols (PEG), the melting point (freezing point or pour point) increases as the average molecular weight increases.

"Polyglycolized glycerides" denotes a mixture of mono-, di- and triglycerides and polyethylene glycol (PEG) mono- and diesters, preferably of molecular weight between 200 and 600, where appropriate of free glycerol and free PEG, whose HLB value is adjusted by the length of the PEG chain, and whose melting point is adjusted by the length of the chains of the fatty acids, of the PEG and by the degree of saturation of the fatty chains, and hence of the starting oil; examples of such mixtures are Gelucire®. Gelucire®compositions are inert semi-solid waxy materials which are amphiphilic in character and are available with varying physical characteristics. They are surface active in nature and disperse or solubilize in aqueous media forming micelles, microscopic globules or vesicles. They are identified by their melting point/HLB value. The melting point is expressed in degrees Celsius and the HLB (Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance) is a numerical scale extending from 0 to approximately 20. Lower HLB values denote more lipophilic and hydrophobic substances, and higher values denote more hydrophilic and lipophobic substances. The affinity of a compound for water or for oily substances is determined and its HLB value is assigned experimentally. One or a mixture of different grades of Gelucire® excipient may be chosen to achieve the desired<br><br>
pharacteristics of melting point and/or HLB value. They are mixtures of monoesters, diesters and/or tnesters of glycerides of long chain (C12 to C1S) fatty acids, and PEG (mono- and/or di) esters of long chain (C12 to C1B) fatty acids and can include free PEG. Gelucire® compositions are generally described as fatty acid esters of glycerol and PEG esters or as polyglycolized glycerides. Gelucire® compositions are characterized by a wide range of melting points of from about.33°C to about 64°C and most commonly from about 35°C to about 55°C, and by a variety of HLB values of from about 1 to about 14, most commonly from about 7 to about 14. For example, Gelucire® 50/13 designates a melting point of approximately 50°C and an HLB value of about 13 to this grade of Gelucire®.<br>

In a specific aspect of the invention, the at least one of the one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is selected from the group consisting of silica acid or a derivative or salt thereof including silicates, silicon dioxide and polymers thereof; magnesium<br><br>
-aluminosilicate and/or magnesium aluminometasilicate, bentonite, kaolin, magnesium trisilicate, montmorilionite and/or saponite.<br>
Such materials are is especially useful as a sorption material for oils or oily materials in Pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and/or foodstuff. In a specific embodiment, the material is used as a sorption material for oils or oily materials in Pharmaceuticals. The material that has the ability to function as a sorption material for oils or oily materials is also denoted "oil sorption material". Furthermore, in the present context the term "sorption" is used to denote "absorption" as well as "adsorption". It should be understood that whenever one of the terms is used it is intended to cover the phenomenon absorption as well as adsorption.<br>
Notably, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient may comprise a silica acid or a derivative or salt thereof such as, e.g., silicon dioxide or a polymer thereof as a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Dependent on the quality employed a silicon dioxide may be a lubricant or it may be an oil sorption material. Qualities fulfilling the latter function seem to be most important.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the composition or solid dosage form according to invention comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient that is a silicon dioxide product that has properties corresponding to Aeroperl® 300 (available from Degussa, Frankfurt, Germany).<br>
As it appears from the examples herein, a very suitable material is Aeroperl® 300 (including materials with properties like or corresponding to those of Aeroperl® 300).<br>
Use of an oil sorption material in compositions or dosage forms according to the invention is very advantageous for the preparation of pharmaceutical, cosmetic, nutritional and/or food compositions, wherein the composition comprises oil or an oily material. One of the advantages is that is it possible to incorporate a relatively large amount of oil and oily material and still have a material that is solid. Thus, it is possible to prepare solid compositions with a relatively high load of oil or oily materials by use of an oil sorption material according to the invention. Within the pharmaceutical field it is an advantage to be able to incorporate a relatively large amount of an oil or an oily-Iike material in a solid composition especially in those situation where the active substance does not have suitable properties with respect to water solubility (e.g. poor water solubility), stability in aqueous medium (i.e. degradation occurs in aqueous medium), oral bioavailability (e.g. low bioavailability) etc., or in those situations where it is desired to modify the release of an active substance from a composition in order to obtain a controlled, delayed, sustained and/or pulsed delivery of the active substance. Thus, in a specific embodiment it is used in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The oil sorption material for use in the processing into solid compositions normally absorbs about 5% w/w or more, such as, e.g., about 10% w/w or more, about 15% w/w or<br><br>
♦more, about 20% w/w or more, about 25% w/w or more, about 30% w/w or more, about 35% w/w or more, aboui 40% w/w or more, about 45% w/w or more, about 50 w/w or more, about 55% w/w or more, about 60% w/w or more, about 65% w/w or more, about 70% w/w or more, about 75% w/w or more, about 80% w/w or more, about 85% w/w or more, about 90% w/w or more or about 95% w/w or more of an oil or an oily material and is still a solid material.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition in particulate form comprising tacrolimus and/or an analogue thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, wherein the composition upon oral administration to a mammal in need thereof exhibits an AUC/AUCprograf® value of at least about 1.3, the AUC values being determined under similar conditions.<br>
As it appears from the examples herein the bioavaiiability obtained after administration of a composition according to the invention is markedly improved. Thus, in specific embodiments, the AUG/AUCPrDgraf® value is at least about 1.5 such as about 1.75 or more, about 1.8 or more, about 1.9 or more, about 2.0 or more, about 2.5 or more, about 2.75 or more, about 3.0 or more, about 3.25 or more, about 3.5 or more, about 3.75 or more, about 4.0 or more, about 4.25 or more, about 4.5 or more, about 4.75 or more or about 5.0 or more, the AUG values being determined under similar conditions.<br>
After oral administration of a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention it is contemplated that the plasma concentration versus time profile show an extended period of time in which the plasma concentration is maintained within the therapeutic window (i.e. the plasma concentration leads to a therapeutic effect) without leading to serious unwanted side effects. Thus, a reduction in peak concentration may be observed. Accordingly, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition in particulate form comprising tacrolimus together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, wherein the composition upon oral administration to a mammal in need thereof exhibits a Cmax that is at the most about 80% of that of Cmax for Prograf® tablets such as, e.g., at the most about 75%, at the most about 70%, at the most about 65%, at the most about 60%, at the most about 55%, at the most about 50%, at the most about 45% or at the most about 40%.<br>
However, a reduction in peak concentration may not lead to a decrease in therapeutic effect as long as the plasma concentration of tacrolimus is maintained within the therapeutic window. Accordingly, the present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition, wherein W5o is at least about 2 hours, such as, e.g., at least about 3 hours, at least about 4 hours, at least about 5 hours, at least about 6 hours, at least about 7 hours, at least about 8 hours, at least about 9 hours, about 10 hours or more, about 11 hours or more, about 12 hours or more, about 13 hours or about 14 hours or more.<br><br>
'max<br>
Furthermore or moreover, a composition according to the invention has a Cdiff= [C, - Ct(t=12 hours)] that is less than that of Prograf® under the same conditions. If Cd[ff for Prograf® is set to 100 then Cd,ff of a composition according to the invention is preferably 90 or less such as, e.g., about 85 or less, about 80 or less, about 75 or less, about 70 or less, about 65 or less, about 60 or less, about 55 or less, about 50 or less, about 45 or less or about 40 or less.<br>
It is contemplated that the need for simultaneous food intake in order to secure a sufficient uptake of tacroiimus is significantly reduced or even completely abolished, when administering a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form of the present invention.<br>
Thus, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention provide significant higher bioavaiiabiiity of tacroiimus, which may reduce the number of daily administered dosage units, and reduce or abolish the need for administration in connection with food intake, which provide for a higher degree of freedom for the recipient of the pharmaceutical compositions, and consequently the patients acceptance and/or compliance may be significantly improved. Furthermore, the compositions provide a significant reduction in side effects, especially side effect related to a high peak concentration (such as, e.g., nephro- and neuro-toxicity, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea etc) and provide for an extended release of tacroiimus leading to a better therapy.<br>
One of the major challenges with respect to formulation of tacroiimus compositions is to avoid an adverse food effect. In general, tacroiimus is much better absorbed when it is administered orally without food. A great variation in bioavaiiabiiity is therefore seen following administration with or without food. This dependency makes it difficult to give precise guidelines as to how large a dose that should be administered and, furthermore, it requires information to the patient about the dosing regime. The present invention aims at providing compositions wherein the adverse food effect is reduced. Thus, the present invention provides a composition, which does not exhibit a significant adverse food effect after administration of the composition to a mammal in need of such a treatment as evidenced by a value of (AUCfed/AUCfested) of at least about 0.85 with a lower 90% confidence limit of at least 0.75.<br>
More specifically, a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention has a value of (AUCfed/AUCfasted) of about 0.9 or more such as, e.g., about 0.95 or more, about 0.97 or more or about 1 or more such as, e.g., up to about 1.1 or up to about 1.2.<br>
Apart from tacroiimus, the composition of the invention may also comprise a further therapeutically, prophylactically and/or diagnostically active substance. Notably combinations of tacroiimus with at least one of the following active substances are of interest: Substances that are indicated for use in connection with organ transplantation such as, e.g., steroids, calcineurin inhibitors and/or anti-proliferative agents. Specific examples include prednisone,<br><br>
^prednisolone, methylprednisone, cyclosporin, mycophenolate, azathioprine, sirolimus, everolimus, mycophenolate-sodium, and FTY720 (developed by the pharmaceutical company Novartis).<br>
Dosage forms<br>
Useful dosage forms of the invention are solid oral dosage forms comprising the solid dispersion and/or solid solution and one or more pharmaceutically aceptable excipients, preferably unit dosage forms.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is in particulate form and may be employed as such. However, in many cases it is more convenient to present the composition in the form of granules, pellets, microspheres, nanoparticles and the like or in the form of solid dosage forms including tablets, capsules and sachets and the like.<br>
A solid dosage form according to the invention may be a single unit dosage form or it may in the form of a polydepot dosage form contain a multiplicity of individual units such as, e.g., pellets, beads and/or granules.<br>
The dosage forms may further comprise pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as flavoring agents, coloring agents, taste-masking agents, pH-adjusting agents, buffering agents, preservatives, stabilizing agents, anti-oxidants, wetting agents, humidity-adjusting agents, surface-active agents, suspending agents, absorption enhancing agents and release modifying agents.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the dosage form comprises silica acid or a derivative or salt thereof including silicates, silicon dioxide and polymers thereof; and/or magnesium aluminosilicate and/or magnesium aiuminometasilicate, bentonite, kaolin, magnesium triplicate, montmoriilonite and/or saponite. A particularly useful excipient to be included in the dosage forms is any silicon dioxide product having properties corresponding to Aeroperl® 300 (available from Degussa, Frankfurt, Germany).<br>
A solid dosage form according to the present invention comprises a pharmaceutical composition in particulate form as described above. The details and particulars disclosed under this main aspect of the invention apply mutatis mutandis to the other aspects of the invention. Accordingly, the properties with respect to increase in bioavailability, changes in bioavailability parameters, reduction in adverse food effect as well as release of tacrolimus and/or an analogue thereof etc. described and/or claimed herein for pharmaceutical compositions in particulate form are analogues for a solid dosage form according to the present invention.<br>
Normally, the concentration of the pharmaceutical composition in particulate form is in a range of from about 5 to 100% w/w such as, e.g., from about 10% to about 90% w/w, from about 15% to about 85% w/w, from about 20% to about 80% w/w, from about 25% to about<br><br>
-80% w/w, from about 30% to about 80% w/w, from about 35% to about 80% w/w, from about 40% to about 75% w/w, from about 45% to about 75% w/w or from about 50% to about 70% w/w of the dosage form. In an embodiment of the invention, the concentration of the pharmaceutical composition in particulate form is 50% w/w or more of the dosage form.<br>
A solid dosage form according to the invention is obtained by processing the particuiate material according to the invention by means of techniques well-known to a person skilled in the art. Normally, it involves further addition of one or more of the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients mentioned herein.<br>
The composition or solid dosage form according to the invention may be designed to release tacrolimus and/or an analogue thereof in any suitable manner provided that the increase in btoavailability is present. Thus, the active substance may be released relatively fast in order to obtain an enhanced on-set of action, it may be released so as to follow zero or first order kinetics or it may be released in a modified manner in order to obtain a predetermined pattern of release. All of these ways are considered controlled manners. Plain formulations are also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The recommended dosage range for Prograf® is 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg/day given every 12 hours in two divided doses. More importantly the blood levels has to be monitored. The typical level for 1 - 3 months is 7 -20 ng/mL and 4-12 months the levels should be 5 - 15 ng/mL This is only guiding values and may vary from types of transplant and etnicity.<br>
The following data have been found for kidney transplant patients:<br><br>
The contemplated dosage recommendation for products of the present invention will be from 0.02 mg/kg/day to 0.15 mg/kg/day, dosed once a day.<br>
Enteric coatings - delayed release<br>
It has been found that the efficacy of oral tacrolimus treatment can be greatly improved through proper design of the tacrolimus release profile. On the one hand relatively<br><br>
high doses of tacrolimus are required to avoid transplant rejection and on the other hand side effects often get too pronounced even at therapeutically relevant levels. Thus, the side effects such as acute nausea, vomiting, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity are directly linked to high peak plasma concentrations. This link has been demonstrated in dogs. In those cases where a lower dose has been used in order to avoid a high peak level, the dose-dependent side effects almost cease to occur at a certain threshold level and, if they occurred, they were much less pronounced. However, due to the decrease in dose (without increasing the bioavaiiability) the therapeutically effective level is only maintained for a short duration of time. The present invention addresses this problem by providing a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form containing tacrolimus, wherein the release of tacrolimus is designed to avoid high peak concentrations and at the same time, the composition is designed so that the overall bioavaiiability is maintained or increased as compared to commercially available tacrolimus-containing dosage forms. Moreover, by delaying the release of tacrolimus and at the same time provide a composition wherein tacrolimus is at least partly in dissolved form, it is possible to obtain a significant absorption in the distal part of the gastrointestinal tract.<br>

A delayed release of active ingredient is desired in order to increase the bioavailability of active ingredient by delivering the ingredient in the gastrointestinal tract, i.e. the release predominantly takes place after passage of the stomach. For example, the dosage form of the present invention may be designed in order to release, after oral administration to a mammal in need thereof, at the most about 10 w/w%, preferably at the most about 7.5 w/w%, more preferably at the most about 5 w/w%, especially at the most about 2 w/w% of the total amount of active ingredient within the first 3 hours, preferably<br><br>
within 2 hours, more preferably within 1 hours, in particular within about 30 minutes after administration.<br>
Further, the solid dosage form of the invention may, upon oral administration to a mammal in need thereof, release at least about 50 w/w% of the active ingredient within 24 hours, preferably within about 20 hours, more preferably within about 18 hours, especially within about 15 hours, in particular within about 12 hours.<br>
Delayed release is mainly brought about by some kind of enteric coating. Whereas semipermeable coating will show some kind of delayed release, it may not preciously enough "delay" release. Additionally it requires a certain amount of time to release the content. The coating sought for this invention, is a pH dependant coating. This type of coating is very resistant to release of drug until a certain pH is reached. Within a small increment in the pH value, i.e. within an increase in pH of about 0.2 to 0.4, the film alters properties and becomes permeable.<br>
Accordingly, the solid dosage forms of the invention may exhibit a delayed release of active ingredient by means of an enteric coating using a water-miscibie polymer having a pH-dependant solubility in water. Examples of pH-sensitive polymers, which are rel^ively insoluble and impermeable at the pH of the stomaGh, but which are more soluble and permeable at the pH of the small intestine and colon include, but are hot limited to, polyacrylamides; phthalate derivatives such as acid phthalates of carbohydrates including amylose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate terephtahalate, cellulose acetate isophthalate, other cellulose ester phthalates, cellulose ether phthalates, hydroxypropyl cellulose phthalate, hydroxypropylcellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl ethytcellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (HMPCP), methylcellulose phthalate, methyl cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate hydrogen phthalate, sodium cellulose acetate phthalate, starch acid phthalate; phthalates of other compounds including polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP); other cellulose derivatives including hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), carboxymethylcellulose, cellulose acetate trimellitate; alginates; carbomers; polyacrylic acid derivatives such as acrylic acid and acrylic ester copoiymers, polymethacrylic acid and esters thereof, poly acrylic methacrylic acid copoiymers, methacrylic acid copoiymers (for example Eudragit® L and Eudragit® S); styrene-maleic acid dibutyl phthalate copolymer, styrene-maleic acid polyvinylacetate phthalate copolymer, styrene and maleic acid copoiymers; shellac, starch glycolate; polacrylin; vinyl acetate and crotonic acid copoiymers and mixtures thereof. pH-sensitive polymers of specific interest include shellac; phthalate derivatives, particularly cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate; polyacrylic acid derivatives, particularly polymethyl<br><br>
methacryiate blended with acrylic acid and acrylic ester copolymers; and vinyl acetate and crotonic acid copolymers.<br>
A first delayed release embodiment according to the invention is a "pH-dependent coated dosage form" such as, e.g., a tablet or a capsule. In the case of a tablet it comprises a tablet core comprising tacrolimus e.g. in a solid solution/dispersion as a multiparticulate product, a controlled release matrix of e.g. HPMC, a disintegrant, a lubricant, and one or more pharmaceutical carriers, such core being coated with a material, preferably a polymer, which is substantially insoluble and impermeable at the pH of the stomach, and which is more soluble and permeable at the pH of the small intestine. Preferably, the coating polymer is substantially insoluble and impermeable at pH 5.0. The tablet core may be coated with an amount of polymer sufficient to assure that substantially no release of tacrolimus from the dosage form occurs until the dosage form has exited the stomach and has resided in the small intestine for about 15 minutes or greater, preferably about 30 minutes or greater, thus assuring that minimal tacrolimus is released in the duodenum. Mixtures of a pH-sensitive polymer with a water-insoluble polymer may also be employed. Tablets are coated with an amount of polymer comprising from about 10% to about 80% of the weight of the tacrolimus-containing tablet core. Preferred tablets are coated with an amount of polymer comprising about 15% to about 50% of the weight of the tacrolimus tablet core.<br>
pH-sensitive polymers which are very insoluble and impermeable at the pH of the stomach, but which are more soluble and permeable at the pH of the small intestine and colon include polyacrylamides, phthalate derivatives such as acid phthalates of carbohydrates, amylose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, other cellulose ester phthalates, cellulose ether phthalates, hydroxypropylcellulose phthalate, hydroxypropylethylcellulose phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, methylcellulose phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate hydrogen phthalate, sodium cellulose acetate phthalate, starch acid phthalate, styrene-maleic acid dibutyl phthalate copolymer, styrene-maleic acid polyvinylacetate phthalate copolymer, styrene and maleic acid copolymers, polyacrylic acid derivatives such as acrylic acid and acrylic ester copolymers, polymethacrylic acid and esters thereof, poly acrylic methacrylic acid copolymers, shellac, and vinyl acetate and crotonic acid copolymers.<br>
Preferred pH-sensitive polymers include shellac; phthalate derivatives, particularly cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate; polyacrylic acid derivatives, particularly polymethyl methacryiate blended with acrylic acid and acrylic ester copolymers; and vinyl acetate and crotonic acid copolymers.<br>
The delay time before release of tacrolimus, after the "pH-dependent coated tablet" dosage form has exited the stomach, may be controlled by choice of the relative amounts of<br><br>
Eudragit-L® and Eudragit-S® in the coating, and by choice of the coating thickness. Eudragit-L® films dissolve above pH 6.0, and Eudragit-S® films dissolve above 7.0, and mixtures dissolve at an intermediate pH. Since the pH of the duodenum is approximately 6.0 and the pH of the colon is approximately 7.0, coatings composed of mixtures of Eudragit-L® and Eudragit-S® provide protection of the duodenum from tacrolimus. If it is desired to delay release of tacrolimus until the tacrolimus-containing "pH-dependent coated tablet" has reached the colon, Eudragit-S® may be used as the coating material, as described by Dew et al. (Br. J. CIin. Pharmac. 14 (1982) 405-408). In order to delay the release of tacrolimus for about 15 minutes or more, preferably 30 minutes or more, after the dosage form has exited the stomach, preferred coatings comprise from about 9:1 to about 1:9 Eudragit-L® /Eudragit-S®, more preferably from about 9:1 to about 1:4 Eudragit-L®/Eudragit-S®. The coating may comprise from about 3% to about 70% of the weight of the uncoated tablet core. Preferably, the coating comprises from about 5% to about 50% of the weight of the tablet core.<br>
The release of the active substance from a composition having a delayed release coating could also be an enzymatic reaction, if for example Zein or mono/dwgiyceride mixtures are employed as coating material.<br>
Manufacture of the compositions and dosage forms of the invention<br>
The present invention also provides a method for the preparation of the solid dispersion and/or solid solution of the invention, the method comprising the step of dispersing and/or dissolving tacrolimus or an analogue thereof in a hydrophilic or water-miscible vehicle to obtain a solid dispersion and/or solid solution at ambient temperature.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be prepared by any convenient method such as, e.g. granulation, mixing, spray drying etc. An example of a useful method is the controlled agglomeration method disclosed in WO 03/004001, i.e. a method enabling a controlled growth in particle size. The method involves spraying a first composition comprising an active ingredient and a melted vehicle onto a second solid carrier. Normally, the meltable vehicle has a melting point of at least 5°C, but the melting point is preferably below the melting point of tacrolimus. The melting point of the vehicle may be in the range of 10°C to 150°C.<br>
An advantage of using the controlled agglomeration method described in WO 03/004001 is that it is possible to apply a relatively large amount of a melt to a particulate material without having an undesirable growth in particle size.<br>
The solid dispersion may also be obtained e.g. by employing organic solvents or by dispersing or dissolving the active substance in another suitable medium (e.g. an oil or an oily material that is in liquid form at room temperature or at elevated temperatures).<br><br>
Solid dispersions (solvent method) are prepared by dissolving a physical mixture of the active substance (e.g. a drug substance) and the vehicle or carrier in a common organic solvent, followed by evaporation of the solvent. The vehicle carrier may be a hydrophilic polymer. Suitable organic solvents include pharmaceutical acceptable solvent in which the active substance is soluble such as methanol, ethanol, methylene chloride, chloroform, ethylacetate, acetone or mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable water soluble carriers include polymers such as polyethylene glycol, poloxamers, polyoxyethylene stearates, poly -s-caprolactone, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinylpyrrolidone-polyvinylacetate copolymer PVP-PVA (Kollidon VA64), poly-methacrylic polymers (Eudragit RS, Eudragit RL, Eudragit NE, Eudragit E) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), hydroxypropyi cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), methyl cellulose, and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO).<br>
Polymers containing acidic functional groups may be suitable for solid dispersions, which release the active substance in a preferred pH range providing acceptable absorption in the intestines. Such polymers may be one ore more selected from the group comprising hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phtalate (HMPCP), polyvinyl acetate phtalate (PVAP), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), alginate, carbomer, carboxymethylcellulose, methacrylic acid copolymer (Eudragit L, Eudragit S), shellac, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), starch glycolate, polacrylin, methyl cellulose acetate phtalate, hydroxypropyulcellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate terephtahalate, cellulose acetate isophthalate and cellulose acetate trimellitate.<br>
In relations to amounts of the active substance and the polymer in the solid dispersion, the weight ratio of active substance to polymer may be in a range of from about 3:1 to about 1:20. However, narrower ranger of from about 3:1 to about 1:5, such as, e.g., from about 1:1 to about 1:3 or about may also be used.<br>
The solid dispersion is preferably formed by spray drying techniques, controlled agglomeration, freeze-drying or coating on carrier particles or any other solvent removal process. The dried product contains the active substance present in the form of a solid dispersion including a molecular dispersion and a solid solution.<br>
As an alternative to the use of organic solvents the drug and polymer may be co-grinded or extruded at elevated temperatures (melt extrusion).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions comprising tacrolimus at least partly in form of a solid dispersion or solution may in principle be prepared using any suitable procedure for preparing pharmaceutical compositions known within the art.<br>
Apart from using the organic solvent based method, solid dispersion or solid solutions of tacrolimus and/or an analogue thereof may be obtained by dispersing and/or dissolving tacrolimus in the carrier composition used in the controlled agglomeration method. Stabilizing<br><br>
agents etc. may be added in order to ensure the stability of the solid dispersion/solution.<br>
Uses<br>
The solid dispersion and/or solution of the invention or the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be used in the preparation of an solid oral dosage form such as tablets, capsules or sachets; or for the preparation of granules, pellets microspheres ornanoparticles.<br>
Preferably, the solid dispersion or solid solution is used in the preparation of an immediate release solid dosage form or a delayed release solid dosage form.<br>
Other uses of the solid dispersion or solid solution of the invention is for the preparation of a topical dosage form.<br>
A further advantage of a composition of the present invention is the possibility of obtaining an effective therapeutic response with a decreased dosage compared to traditional oral treatment. Thus it is contemplated that the solid dosage form of the invention, when orally administered to a mammal in need thereof in a dose that is at the most about 85% w/w such as, e.g., at the .most about 80% w/w, at the most about 75%, at the most about 70% w/w, at the most about 65% w/w, at the most about 60% w/w, at the most about 55% w/w or at the most about 50% w/w of the dose of tacrolimus administered in the form of Prograf® or a similar commercially available tacrolimus-containing product, Is essentially bioequivalent with Prograf® or a similar commercially available tacrolimus-containing product.<br>
