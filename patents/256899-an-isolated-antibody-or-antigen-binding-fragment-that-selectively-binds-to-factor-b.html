				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention generally relates to novel inhibitors of the alternative complement pathway<br>
and particularly, novel anti-factor B antibodies. The invention also generally relates to the use of<br>
such inhibitors to reduce or prevent airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation and<br>
thereby treat diseases in which such conditions play a role.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Complement activation occurs primarily by three pathways: the so-called classical pathway,<br>
the lectin pathway and the alternative pathway. The key proteins involved in the activation of the<br>
alternative pathway are factor B (fB) and factor D (Â£D). These proteins work in concert to initiate<br>
and/or to amplify the activation of C3, which then leads to the initiation of a number of<br>
inflammatory events. A third protein, properdin, stabilizes the complex of C3 and factor B but is<br>
not absolutely required for the alternative pathway to function. Factor B also helps sohibilize<br>
immune complexes, has been reported to act as a B cell growth factor and can activate monocytes<br>
(Takahashi, 1980; Hall, 1982; Peters, 1988). Factor B-deficient mice (fB-/- mice) have been<br>
generated and IgGl antibody response to T-cell dependent antigens and sensitivity to endotoxic<br>
shock appear normal in these mice (Matsumoto, 1997).<br>
The alternative complement pathway is usually initiated by bacteria, parasites, viruses or<br>
fungi, although IgA Abs and certain Ig L chains have also been reported to activate this pathway.<br>
Alternative pathway activation is initiated when circulating factor B binds to activated C3 (either<br>
C3b or C3H20). This complex is then cleaved by circulating factor D to yield an enzymatically<br>
active fragment, C3Bb. C3Bb cleaves C3 generating C3b, which drives inflammation and also<br>
further amplify the activation process, generating a positive feedback loop. Both components<br>
(factor B and factor D) are required to enable activation of the alternative pathway.<br>
Recent studies have shown that the alternative pathway of complement plays an important<br>
role in the pathogenesis of several animal models of disease. Complement activation within the<br>
kidney after I/R is mediated almost exclusively by the alternative pathway (Thurman) and the<br>
alternative pathway plays a critical role in the development of arthritis. Perhaps most surprisingly,<br>
mice deficient in the alternative pathway have been demonstrated to be protected from nephritis in<br>
the MRL/lpr model of lupus nephritis (Watanabe) and from anti-phospholipid mediated fetal loss<br>
(Girardi), models that would traditionally have been assumed to be mediated by the classical<br>
complement pathway.<br>
Several inhibitors have already been developed to inhibit the complement system at various<br>
stages of activation (Holers), although specific inhibitors of the alternative pathway have not been<br>
widely reported prior to the present invention. PCX Publication WO 01/47963, published July 4,<br>
2001, describes polypeptides from ectoparasitic leeches that inhibit the alternative pathway of<br>
complement activation in vitro and have substantially no effect on the complement activation by the<br>
classical route. These peptides were shown to bind to factor D; however, no in vivo application of<br>
these polypeptides was demonstrated. A reagent with the ability to specifically inhibit the<br>
alternative pathway in vivo would theoretically have several advantages compared with existing<br>
inhibitors of the complement cascade. First, for models such as renal I/R and antiphospholipid<br>
mediated fetal loss, that are primarily mediated by the alternative pathway, such an inhibitor should<br>
be equally effective as a pan-complement inhibitor yet should have fewer immunosuppressive sideeffects.<br>
Although only one human patient with congenital deficiency of factor B has been reported<br>
(Densen), studies of gene targeted factor B deficient mice (/B-/-) have not yet demonstrated an<br>
immune-modulating effect for this factor (Densen; Matsumoto). Patients with congenital<br>
deficiencies of classical pathway components, in contrast, appear to have an increased risk of<br>
infection (most commonly Staphylococcus and Streptococcus). Inhibition of classical pathway<br>
components or C3 (common to all of the complement pathways) might also be associated with the<br>
autoimmunity (Figueroa), perhaps explaining why factor B deficiency protects MRL/lpr mice from<br>
developing glomerulonephritis, but C3 deficiency does not (Watanabe). Thus, inhibition of the<br>
alternative pathway may be better tolerated and in some cases more effective than classical pathway<br>
complement inhibition.<br>
Allergic asthma is a common syndrome associated with airway inflammation and airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness (AHR) (Busse). hi patients with allergic asthma exposure to inhaled allergen<br>
leads to increase in AHR and airway inflammation and studies have shown increased levels of<br>
biologically active fragments derived from the complement C3, C4 and C5 family of proteins,<br>
especially C3a (Humbles) and C5a (Krug) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. This suggests that<br>
hi these patients, following allergen exposure, activation of the complement pathway through an<br>
allergen-induced mechanism occurs in the lung. Animal models have provided further insight in the<br>
role of complement for the development of allergic airway disease. Animals deficient in C3 or C3a<br>
receptor animals appear protected from the development of allergen induced airway disease<br>
(Humbles, Drouin; Bautsch; Walters).<br>
Several different possibilities have been proposed to induce complement activation<br>
following allergen exposure. For example, allergen-IgG immune-complexes could trigger activation<br>
ot the classical pathway and certain antigens may directly activate C3 via the alternative pathway<br>
(Kohl). In addition, neutral tryptase released from mast cells or pulmonary macrophages may<br>
directly (proteolytically) cleave either C3 or C5 (Schwartz; Mulligan). The three pathways of<br>
complement activation (classical, alternative, and lectin) converge at the central complement<br>
component C3. Therefore inhibition of C3 activation prevents cleavage into active C3 fragments<br>
but also largely reduces the downstream activation of C5 and the release of CS-derived activated<br>
fragments (Sahu). Recent studies have shown that inhibition of complement activation during<br>
allergen exposure of sensitized animals by using C3 convertase inhibitors, and therefore inhibiting<br>
all three activation pathways, reduces the late airway response (Abe) as well as the development of<br>
AHR and airway inflammation (Taube). PCT Publication No. WO 2004/022096, published March<br>
18, 2004, describes the inhibition of the complement pathway, preferably through the terminal<br>
complement components of C5-C9 that are shared by all pathways, and most preferably through<br>
inhibition of C5a.<br>
Currently, therapy for treatment of inflammatory diseases involving AHR, such as moderate<br>
to severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, predominantly involves the use of<br>
glucocorticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory agents. These agents, however, have the potential<br>
of serious side effect, including, but not limited to, increased susceptibility to infection, liver<br>
toxicity, drug-induced lung disease, and bone marrow suppression. Thus, such drugs are limited<br>
in their clinical use for the treatment of lung diseases associated with airway hyperresponsiveness.<br>
The use of anti-inflammatory and symptomatic relief reagents is a serious problem because of their<br>
side effects or their failure to attack the underlying cause of an inflammatory response. There is a<br>
continuing requirement for less harmful and more effective reagents for treating inflammation.<br>
Thus, there remains a need for processes using reagents with lower side effect profiles, less toxicity<br>
and more specificity for the underlying cause of allergic airway diseases such as asthma and the<br>
condition known as AHR.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
One embodiment of the present invention relates to the provision of novel factor B<br>
antibodies that selectively block the alternative complement pathway, and the use of such antibodies<br>
to inhibit the alternative complement pathway in any condition or disease where such inhibition is<br>
desired, useful or anticipated to be useful. Specifically, given the great potential therapeutic benefit<br>
of an inhibitor specific for the alternative complement pathway for use in methods of treatment for<br>
many diseases, the present inventors have developed several novel, inhibitory monoclonal<br>
antibodies directed against factor B. Several of these antibodies have been characterized, and one<br>
of these antibodies has been characterized in great detail. This antibody has been tested in vitro as<br>
well as in vivo in both a well-accepted model of allergic inflammation and asthma, and in a model<br>
of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, which is generally applicable to ischemia-reperfusion injury.<br>
To produce such antibodies, gene-targeted factor B deficient mice (/B-/-) were injected with a fusion<br>
protein comprised of the second and third short consensus repeat (SCR) domains of factor B linked<br>
to an immunoglobulin. Mice were screened for an immune response to factor B, and spleen cells<br>
from one of the injected mice were fused to myeloma cells. One of the resulting hybridomas, named<br>
1379, produces an IgG, antibody that inhibits alternative complement pathway activation in vitro<br>
and in vivo, although the present inventors have produced and characterized multiple monoclonal<br>
antibodies with the ability to inhibit the alternative complement pathway (see Table 4). The 1379<br>
antibody (also referred to herein as mAb 1379) inhibits alternative pathway activation in serum from<br>
multiple animal species including, mice, rats, humans, baboons, rhesus monkeys, cyno monkeys,<br>
pigs, rabbits, and horses. Fab fragments made from this antibody also resulted in complete inhibition<br>
of the alternative pathway. The inventors have also shown that the antibody can completely inhibit<br>
the lysis of erythrocytes by human serum, thus confirming the ability of this reagent to completely<br>
block alternative complement pathway activation. Epitope mapping was used to demonstrate that<br>
this antibody binds to factor B within the third short consensus repeat (SCR) domain, and the<br>
antibody prevented formation of the C3bBb complex. A detailed description of the epitope<br>
recognized by this antibody is provided below. Therefore, one embodiment of the present invention<br>
is directed to selective inhibitors of the alternative complement pathway, and particularly these<br>
novel factor B antibodies, that have broad species reactivity, demonstrated in vitro and in vivo<br>
efficacy, and are highly effective therapeutic tools for use in any of a variety of conditions and<br>
diseases wherein selective inhibition of the complement pathway is be useful, necessary and/or<br>
preferred (e.g., conditions associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation<br>
(see below), ischemia-reperfusion injury, etc.). These antibodies can also be humanized or<br>
otherwise manipulated to reduce potential side effects from the immune system and are therefore<br>
a valuable new therapeutic reagent.<br>
The antibodies that have been produced by the present inventors recognize a site on factor<br>
B that is shared among several mammalian species (including humans) in which pre-clinical proofof-<br>
principle experiments are performed, thus allowing discoveries in models of human disease to<br>
be readily translated into human therapies. Prior to the present invention, the inventors are not<br>
aware of any other antibody against factor B that exhibits the broad species inhibition of the protein<br>
as the does the antibody of the present invention. Therefore, the present inventors have also<br>
identified a unique site on factor B against which new inhibitory reagents can be developed.<br>
Identification of factor B and the other proteins in the alternative complement pathway as specific<br>
therapeutic targets provides both a rational therapeutic strategy as well as lead compounds that can<br>
be pursued to treat inflammatory diseases of the airways and other diseases. There are advantages<br>
in selectively blocking the alternative pathway. For example, C4 -/- mice (mice lacking the C4<br>
complement component that is generic to the classical, alternative and lectin complement pathways),<br>
but not^B -/- (factor B deficient) mice, appear more susceptible to experimental bacterial infection,<br>
suggesting that by leaving the classical pathway intact, an inhibitor of the alternative pathway poses<br>
less risk for serious infection. Blockade of the classical pathway may also result in autoimmunity<br>
and patients with congenital deficiencies of classical pathway components have an increased risk<br>
of infection and autoimmunity. Selective inhibition of the alternative pathway prevents generation<br>
of C3-derived ligands for the C3a receptor as well as for complement receptors 1-4 and C5a. The<br>
effects of blocking of the alternative pathway may in fact be more direct, due to as yet poorly<br>
characterized receptors for the Ba or Bb activation products of factor B that are generated during<br>
the activation process.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a surprising discovery by the present<br>
inventors that activation of the complement cascade through the alternative pathway is critical, and<br>
in fact necessary and sufficient, for the development of airway hyperresponsiveness and airway<br>
inflammation. More particularly, the present inventors disclose herein the discovery that inhibition<br>
of the alternative pathway, but not the classical complement pathway, prevents airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness and reduces airway inflammation. The inventors demonstrate this discovery<br>
using mice deficient in factor B (i.e., via knock out technology) and by inhibition of factor B with<br>
monoclonal antibodies (delivered both systemically and by aerosol). The inventors therefore<br>
disclose herein the selective inhibition of the alternative complement pathway by this or by any other<br>
means (e.g., by a deficiency or inhibition of factor D or properdin), to inhibit airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation. The present inventors have demonstrated that factor<br>
B is necessary for the induction of experimental asthma. Importantly, factor B is essential to the<br>
challenge (or effector) phase of this model, and inhalation of a monoclonal antibody that selectively<br>
binds to factor B into the lung or administered systemically blocks the development of airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and airway inflammation associated with allergic inflammatory disease,<br>
as exemplified in an experimental asthma model. Moreover, the present inventors have discovered<br>
that this inhibition is specifically achieved via the inhibition of the alternative complement pathway,<br>
since additional results showed that C4 knockout (C4-/-) mice were not protected from AHR,<br>
whereas factor B knockout (fB-/-) mice were protected from AHR in this model system. Therefore,<br>
the present inventors have discovered that inhibition of the alternative complement pathway (by any<br>
means) is necessary and sufficient to inhibit AHR and airway inflammation and thereby treat or<br>
prevent conditions and diseases related thereto. Furthermore, the inventors show that inhibition of<br>
the classical complement pathway is not required for inhibition of AHR or airway inflammation and<br>
therefore, as discussed above, undesirable consequences associated with inhibition of the classical<br>
complement pathway can be avoided following the teachings of the present invention.<br>
Factor B Antibodies<br>
Accordingly, a first embodiment of the present invention relates to an antibody or an antigen<br>
binding fragment thereof that selectively inhibits the alternative complement pathway and<br>
particularly, a factor B antibody. Similarly, an antigen binding polypeptide with the same specificity<br>
is also particularly preferred for use in the present invention. In one aspect, the antibody selectively<br>
binds to the protein of the alternative complement pathway in a manner such that the protein is<br>
inhibited or prevented from binding to another protein with which it normally (under natural or<br>
physiological conditions) interacts. In another aspect, the antibody selectively binds to the protein<br>
in a manner such that the protein is inhibited or prevented from activating another, protein with<br>
which it normally interacts, even though the protein may at least partially bind to the other protein.<br>
Particularly preferred antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof for use in selective<br>
inhibition of the alternative complement pathway include the factor B antibodies described herein,<br>
and particularly, the mAb!379 antibody described in detail herein.<br>
Antibodies (and antigen binding fragments thereof) that selectively bind to factor B and<br>
inhibit the alternative complement pathway according to the invention are described and<br>
exemplified in detail herein. In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof<br>
binds to a conserved binding surface or epitope of such a protein (e.g., factor B) that is conserved<br>
among animal species, and particularly mammalian, species (i.e., the antibody is cross-reactive with<br>
the protein from two or more different mammalian species). In particular, the present invention<br>
includes an antibody that binds to factor B from at least two, and preferably, several different<br>
mammalian species, including, but not limited to, human, non-human primate, mouse, rat, pig, horse<br>
and rabbit. Preferably, the present invention includes an antibody that binds to factor B from human<br>
and at least one additional animal species, and preferably, at least one additional mammalian<br>
species, including, but not limited to, non-human primate, mouse, rat, pig, horse and rabbit. In one<br>
embodiment, the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof binds to the third short consensus<br>
repeat (SCR) of factor B. In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof<br>
binds to a region of factor B that prevents the cleavage of factor B by factor D. In one embodiment,<br>
the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. In one embodiment, the antibody is the antibody referred<br>
to herein as 1379 (i.e., the antibody produced by the hybridoma cell line of the same number, also<br>
having ATCC Deposit Designation PTA-6230), or an antigen binding fragment thereof.<br>
The hybridoma described herein as 1379 (or mAbl379) was deposited on September 21,<br>
2004, with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, located at lOSOlUniversity Blvd,<br>
Manassas, VA 20110-2209), under the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the International<br>
Recognition of The Deposit of Microorganisms For the Purposes of Patent Procedure, and has<br>
received ATCC Deposit Designation PTA-6230.<br>
According to the present invention, the minimum size of a protein, portion of a protein (e.g.<br>
a fragment, portion, domain, etc.), or region or epitope of a protein, is a size sufficient to serve as<br>
an epitope or conserved binding surface for the generation of an antibody or as a target in an in vitro<br>
assay. In one embodiment, a protein of the present invention is at least about 4, 5, 6,7 or 8 amino<br>
acids in length (e.g., suitable for an antibody epitope or as a detectable peptide in an assay), or at<br>
least about 25 amino acids in length, or at least about 50 amino acids in length, or at least about 100<br>
amino acids in length, or at least about 150 amino acids in length, and so on, in any length between<br>
4 amino acids and up to the full length of a protein or portion thereof or longer, in whole integers<br>
(e.g.,8,9,10,...25,26,...500,501,...).<br>
The nucleotide sequence for the gene and coding region encoding human factor B and other<br>
complement proteins, as well as the amino acid sequence of such proteins, are well known hi the<br>
art. For example, the gene encoding human factor B and other complement proteins is found in<br>
NCBI Database Accession No. NG_000013. The coding sequence for factor B is found in NCBI<br>
Database Accession No. NM_001710 and the amino acid sequence for factor B preproprotein is<br>
found in NCBI Database Accession No. NP_001701 or P00751. The amino acid sequence forNCBI<br>
Database Accession No. P00751, which is a human preproprotein factor B sequence, is represented<br>
herein by SEQ ID NO: 1. Sequences from other animal species are also known in the art. By way<br>
of comparison, in the mouse factor B sequence (e.g., see NCBI Database Accession No. P04186,<br>
represented herein by SEQ ID NO:6), the third SCR domain is located at positions 160-217 of this<br>
761 ammo acid preprotein, and the mature murine factor B protein spans positions 23-761 of SEQ<br>
ID N0:6.<br>
The human factor B preprotein represented by SEQ ED NO: 1 is a 764 amino acid protein<br>
with a signal peptide spanning from amino acid positions 1-25. The mature chain of factor B<br>
corresponds to positions 26-764 of SEQ ID NO: 1 and is represented herein by SEQ ID NO:2. The<br>
three SCR regions of human factor B are represented herein by SEQ ID N0:3 (SCR1, also known<br>
as Sushi 1, spanning from about position 35 to about position 100 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or from about<br>
position 5 to about position 75 of SEQ ID N0:2), SEQ ED N0:4 (SCR2, also known as Sushi 2,<br>
spanning from about position 101 to about position 160 of SEQ ID N0:l or from about position 76<br>
to about positionl 35 of SEQ DD N0:2), and SEQ ID N0:5 (SCR3, also known as Sushi 3, spanning<br>
from about position 163 to about position 220 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or from about position 13 8 to about<br>
position 195 of SEQ ID N0:2).<br>
Based on the epitope mapping of an exemplary antibody of the invention using the fragments<br>
described by Hourcade, l995,J.Biol. Chem. (see Examples), in one preferred embodiment, an antifactor<br>
B antibody of the present invention preferably binds to an epitope or conserved binding<br>
surface within or containing a part of the third SCR domain, and more preferably, to an epitope of<br>
human factor B that includes at least a portion of the sequence comprising from about position<br>
Tyrl39 to about position Serl85 with respect to the mature factor B protein (SEQ ID NO:2), to an<br>
epitope of human factor B that includes at least a portion of the sequence comprising from about<br>
position Tyrl39 to about position Serl41 with respect to the mature factor B protein (SEQ ID<br>
N0:2), to an epitope of human factor B that includes at least a portion of the sequence comprising<br>
from about position Glul82 to about position Serl85 with respect to the mature factor B protein<br>
(SEQ ID N0:2), to an epitope of factor B that includes at least a portion of human factor B (SEQ<br>
ID NO:2) comprising any one or more of the following positions or their equivalent positions in a<br>
non-human factor B sequence: Tyrl39, Cys 140, Serl41, Glul82, Glyl84, or Serl85, or to an<br>
epitope of factor B that includes at least a portion of the equivalent positions with respect to nonhuman<br>
animal species. One of skill in the art can readily align the sequence of human factor B with<br>
the sequence of factor B from another animal species and determine the positions of the SCR<br>
regions and the specific portions of the third SCR regions corresponding to the amino acid positions<br>
above. For example, two specific sequences can be aligned to one another using BLAST 2 sequence<br>
as described in Tatusova and Madden, (1999), "Blast 2 sequences - a new tool for comparing protein<br>
and nucleotide sequences", FEMS Microbiol Lett. 174:247-250, incorporated herein by reference<br>
in its entirety.<br>
Based on additional epitope modeling and mapping of an exemplary antibody of the<br>
invention, in another preferred embodiment, an anti-factor B antibody of the present invention<br>
preferably binds to an epitope (conserved binding surface) within or containing a part or portion of<br>
the third SCR domain of factor B that includes at least one or more of the following amino acid<br>
positions, with respect to SEQ ED N0:2, or their equivalent positions in a non-human factor B<br>
sequence: A137, Y139, S141, E182, S185, T189, El 90, and S192. In one aspect of the invention,<br>
the epitope is within or containing a part of portion of the third SCR domain of factor B that<br>
includes all or substantially all of (at least five, six, or seven of) the following amino acid positions<br>
of SEQ IDNO:2, or their equivalent positions in a non-human factor B sequence: Alal37, Tyrl39,<br>
Ser 141, Glul 82, Serl 85, Thrl 89, Glul 90, and Serl 92. In yet another aspect, the epitope recognized<br>
by an anti-factor B antibody of the present invention is within or contains a part or portion of the<br>
third SCR domain of factor B consisting of the following ammo acid positions of SEQ ID N0:2,<br>
or their equivalent positions in a non-human factor B sequence: Alal37, Tyrl39, Serl41, Glul82,<br>
Serl85, Thrl89, Glul90, and Serl92.<br>
In one embodiment, the epitope recognized by a factor B antibody of the invention can also<br>
be defined more particularly as being non-linear epitope located within the three-dimensional<br>
structure of a portion of the third SCR domain of factor B. The portion that contains the epitope is<br>
the three-dimensional structure of factor B that is defined by at substantially all of (e.g., at least<br>
about 90% of) amino acid positions Alal37-Serl92 of SEQ ID N0:2, or equivalent positions in a<br>
non-human factor B sequence, when such sequence is conformationally arranged as it occurs in the<br>
natural full-length factor B sequence. A model of the three-dimensional structure of factor B, which<br>
illustrates an epitope for mAb 1379 is illustrated in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, for example. As used herein,<br>
the "three dimensional structure" or "tertiary structure" of a protein refers to the arrangement of the<br>
components of the protein in three dimensions. Such term is well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
As used herein, the term "model" refers to a representation in a tangible medium of the three<br>
dimensional structure of a protein, polypeptide or peptide. For example, a model can be a<br>
representation of the three dimensional structure in an electronic file, on a computer screen, on a<br>
piece of paper (i.e., on a two dimensional medium), and/or as a ball-and-stick figure.<br>
According to the present invention, an "epitope" of a given protein or peptide or other<br>
molecule is generally defined, with regard to antibodies, as a part of or site on a larger molecule to<br>
which an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof will bind, and against which an antibody will<br>
be produced. The term epitope can be used interchangeably with the term "antigenic determinant",<br>
"antibody binding site", or "conserved binding surface" of a given protein or antigen. More<br>
specifically, an epitope can be defined by both the amino acid residues involved in antibody binding<br>
and also by their conformation in three dimensional space (e.g., a conformational epitope or the<br>
conserved binding surface). An epitope can be included in peptides as small as about 4-6 amino<br>
acid residues, or can be included in larger segments of a protein, and need not be comprised of<br>
contiguous amino acid residues when referring to a three dimensional structure of an epitope,<br>
particularly with regard to an antibody-binding epitope. Antibody-binding epitopes are frequently<br>
conformational epitopes rather than a sequential epitope (i.e., linear epitope), or in other words, an<br>
epitope defined by amino acid residues arrayed in three dimensions on the surface of a protein or<br>
polypeptide to which an antibody binds. As mentioned above, the conformational epitope is not<br>
comprised of a contiguous sequence of amino acid residues, but instead, the residues are perhaps<br>
widely separated in the primary protein sequence, and are brought together to form a binding surface<br>
by the way the protein folds in its native conformation in three dimensions. The epitope recognized<br>
by the mAbl379 is a conformational epitope that is not a linear epitope.<br>
One of skill in the art can identify and/or assemble conformational epitopes and/or sequential<br>
epitopes using known techniques, including mutational analysis (e.g., site-directed mutagenesis);<br>
protection from proteolytic degradation (protein footprinting); mimotope analysis using, e.g.,<br>
synthetic peptides andpepscan, BIACORE or ELISA; antibody competition mapping; combinatorial<br>
peptide library screening; matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)<br>
mass spectrometry, or three-dimensional modeling (e.g., using any suitable software program,<br>
including, but not limited to, MOLSCREPT 2.0 (Avatar Software AB, Heleneborgsgatan 21C,<br>
SE-11731 Stockholm, Sweden), the graphical display program O (Jones et. al., Acta<br>
Crystallography, vol. A47, p. 110,1991), the graphical display program GRASP, or the graphical<br>
display program INSIGHT). For example, one can use molecular replacement or other techniques<br>
and the known three-dimensional structure of a related protein to model the three-dimensional<br>
structure of factor B and predict the conformational epitope of antibody binding to this structure.<br>
Indeed, one can use one or any combination of such techniques to define the antibody binding<br>
epitope. Figs. 11 and 12 illustrate the use of three-dimensional modeling, combined with<br>
information from mimotope analysis and mutational analysis, to identify the epitope of a factor B<br>
antibody of the present invention.<br>
As used herein, the term "selectively binds to" refers to the specific binding of one protein<br>
to another (e.g., an antibody, fragment thereof, or binding partner to an antigen), wherein the level<br>
of binding, as measured by any standard assay (e.g., an immunoassay), is statistically significantly<br>
higher than the background control for the assay. For example, when performing an immunoassay,<br>
controls typically include a reaction well/tube that contain antibody or antigen binding fragment<br>
alone (i.e., in the absence of antigen), wherein an amount of reactivity (e.g., non-specific binding<br>
to the well) by the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof in the absence of the antigen is<br>
considered to be background. Binding can be measured using a variety of methods standard in the<br>
art, including, but not limited to: Western blot, immunoblot, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay<br>
(ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), immunoprecipitation, surface plasmon resonance,<br>
chemilmninescence, fluorescent polarization, phosphorescence, immunohistochemical analysis,<br>
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry,<br>
microcytometry, microarray, microscopy, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and flow<br>
cytometry.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention includes an antibody or antigen binding fragment<br>
thereof that is a competitive inhibitor of the binding of factor B to the anti-factor B antibody (e.g.,<br>
monoclonal antibody 1379). According to the present invention, a competitive inhibitor of factor<br>
B binding to an anti-factor B antibody of the present invention is an inhibitor (e.g., another antibody<br>
or antigen binding fragment or polypeptide) that binds to factor B at the same or similar epitope as<br>
the known anti-factor B antibody of the present invention (e.g., mAb 1379) such that binding of the<br>
known anti-factor B antibody to factor B is inhibited. A competitive inhibitor may bind to the target<br>
(e.g., factor B) with a greater affinity for the target than the anti-factor B antibody. A competitive<br>
inhibitor can be used in a manner similar to that described herein for the anti-factor B antibody 1379<br>
(e.g., to inhibit the alternative complement pathway, to inhibit airway hyperresponsiveness in an<br>
animal, to inhibit airway inflammation in an animal, to inhibit reperfusion ischemia injury in an<br>
animal, etc.). For example, one embodiment of the invention relates to an isolated antibody or<br>
antigen binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to factor B, wherein the antibody or<br>
fragment thereof competitively inhibits mAb 1379 for specific binding to factor B, and wherein,<br>
when the antibody or fragment thereof binds to factor B, the alternative complement pathway is<br>
inhibited or alternatively, the ability of mAbl 379 to inhibit the alternative complement pathway is<br>
inhibited. Another embodiment relates to an isolated antibody or fragment thereof that specifically<br>
binds to factor B, wherein the isolated antibody or fragment thereof competitively inhibits a second<br>
antibody or fragment thereof for specific binding to factor B, and wherein the second antibody or<br>
fragment thereof binds to the third SCR domain of factor B.<br>
Competition assays can be performed using standard techniques in the art (e.g., competitive<br>
ELISA or other binding assays). For example, competitive inhibitors can be detected and<br>
quantitated by their ability to inhibit the binding of factor B to a known, labeled anti-factor B<br>
antibody (e.g., the mAb 1379). Antibody-antibody competition assays in the presence of human<br>
factor B are described for example, in Example 3. Competitive inhibitors of the binding of factor<br>
B to anti-factor B 1379 are described in Example 3 and Table 4.<br>
According to the present invention, antibodies are characterized in that they comprise<br>
immunoglobulin domains and as such, they are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of<br>
proteins. Generally speaking, an antibody molecule comprises two types of chains. One type of<br>
chain is referred to as the heavy or H chain and the other is referred to as the light or L chain. The<br>
two chains are present in an equimolar ratio, with each antibody molecule typically having two H<br>
chains and two L chains. The two H chains are linked together by disulfide bonds and each H chain<br>
is linked to a L chain by a disulfide bond. There are only two types of L chains referred to as<br>
lambda (A.) and kappa (K) chains. In contrast, there are five major H chain classes referred to as<br>
isotypes. The five classes include immunoglobulin M (IgM or |i), immunoglobulin D (IgD or 6),<br>
immunoglobulin G (IgG or A), immunoglobulin A (IgA or a), and immunoglobulin E (IgE or e).<br>
The distinctive characteristics between such isotypes are defined by the constant domain of the<br>
immunoglobulin and are discussed in detail below. Human immunoglobulin molecules comprise<br>
nine isotypes, IgM, IgD, IgE, four subclasses of IgG including IgG 1 (y 1), IgG2 (y2), IgG3 (y3) and<br>
IgG4 (y4), and two subclasses of IgA including IgAl (a 1) and IgA2 (<x2 in humans igg subclass></x2>
3 and IgM are the most potent complement activators (classical complement system), while IgG<br>
subclass 1 and to an even lesser extent, 2, are moderate to low activators of the classical<br>
complement system. IgG4 subclass does not activate the complement system .(classical or<br>
alternative). The only human immunoglobulin isotype known to activate the alternative<br>
complement system is IgA. In mice, the IgG subclasses are IgGl, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3. Murine<br>
IgGl does not activate complement, while IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 are complement activators.<br>
Each H or L chain of an immunoglobulin molecule comprises two regions referred to as L<br>
chain variable domains (VL domains) and L chain constant domains (CL domains), and H chain<br>
variable domains (VH domains) and H chain constant domains (CH domains). A complete <br>
domain comprises three sub-domains (CH 1, CH2, CH3) and a hinge region. Together, one H chain<br>
and one L chain can form an arm of an immunoglobulin molecule having an immunoglobulin<br>
variable region. A complete immunoglobulin molecule comprises two associated (e.g., di-sulfide<br>
linked) arms. Thus, each arm of a whole immunoglobulin comprises a VH+L region, and a CH+L<br>
region. As used herein, the term "variable region" or "V region" refers to a VH+L region (also known<br>
as an Fv fragment), a VL region or a VH region. Also as used herein, the term "constant region" or<br>
"C region" refers to a CH+L region, a CL region or a CH region.<br>
Limited digestion of an immunoglobulin with a protease may produce two fragments. An<br>
antigen binding fragment is referred to as an Fab, an Fab', or an F(ab')2 fragment. A fragment<br>
lacking the ability to bind to antigen is referred to as an Fc fragment. An Fab fragment comprises<br>
one arm of an immunoglobulin molecule containing a L chain (VL + CL domains) paired with the<br>
VH region and a portion of the CH region (CHI domain). An Fab' fragment corresponds to an Fab<br>
fragment with part of the hinge region attached to the CHI domain. An F(ab')2 fragment<br>
corresponds to two Fab1 fragments that are normally covalently linked to each other through a disulfide<br>
bond, typically in the hinge regions.<br>
The CH domain defines the isotype of an immunoglobulin and confers different functional<br>
characteristics depending upon the isotype. For example, \i constant regions enable the formation<br>
of pentameric aggregates of IgM molecules and a constant regions enable the formation of dimers.<br>
The antigen specificity of an immunoglobulin molecule is conferred by the amino acid<br>
sequence of a variable, or V, region. As such, V regions of different immunoglobulin molecules<br>
can vary significantly depending upon their antigen specificity. Certain portions of a V region are<br>
more conserved than others and are referred to as framework regions (FW regions). In contrast,<br>
certain portions of a V region are highly variable and are designated hypervariable regions. When<br>
the VL and VH domains pair in an immunoglobulin molecule, the hypervariable regions from each<br>
domain associate and create hypervariable loops that form the antigen binding sites. Thus, the<br>
hypervariable loops determine the specificity of an immunoglobulin and. are termed<br>
complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) because their surfaces are complementary to antigens.<br>
Further variability of V regions is conferred by combinatorial variability of gene segments<br>
that encode an immunoglobulin V region. Immunoglobulin genes comprise multiple germline gene<br>
segments which somatically rearrange to form a rearranged immunoglobulin gene that encodes an<br>
immunoglobulin molecule. VL regions are encoded by a L chain V gene segment and J gene<br>
segment (joining segment). VH regions are encoded by a H chain V gene segment, D gene segment<br>
(diversity segment) and J gene segment (joining segment).<br>
Both a L chain and H chain V gene segment contain three regions of substantial amino acid<br>
sequence variability. Such regions are referred to as L chain CDR1, CDR2 and CDRS, and H chain<br>
CDR1, CDR2 and CDRS, respectively. The length of an L chain CDR1 can vary substantially<br>
between different VL regions. For example, the length of CDR1 can vary from about 7 amino acids<br>
to about 17 amino acids. In contrast, the lengths of L chain CDR2 and CDRS typically do not vary<br>
between different VL regions. The length of a H chain CDR3 can vary substantially between<br>
different VH regions. For example, the length of CDR3 can vary from about 1 amino acid to about<br>
20 amino acids. Each H and L chain CDR region is flanked by FW regions.<br>
Other functional aspects of an immunoglobulin molecule include the valency of an<br>
imrnundglobulin molecule, the affinity of an immunoglobulin molecule, and the avidity of an<br>
immunoglobulin molecule. As used herein, affinity refers to the strength with which an<br>
immunoglobulin molecule binds to an antigen at a single site on an immunoglobulin molecule (i.e.,<br>
a monovalent Fab fragment binding to a monovalent antigen). Affinity differs from avidity which<br>
refers to the sum total of the strength with which an immunoglobulin binds to an antigen.<br>
Immunoglobulin binding affinity can be measured using techniques standard in the art, such as<br>
competitive binding techniques, equilibrium dialysis or BIAcore methods. As used herein, valency<br>
refers to the number of different antigen binding sites per immunoglobulin molecule (i.e., the<br>
number of antigen binding sites per antibody molecule of antigen binding fragment). For example,<br>
a monovalent immunoglobulin molecule can only bind to one antigen at one time, whereas a<br>
bivalent immunoglobulin molecule can bind to two or more antigens at one time, and so forth. Both<br>
monovalent and bivalent antibodies that selectively bind to proteins of the alternative complement<br>
pathway are encompassed herein.<br>
In one embodiment, the antibody is a bi- or multi-specific antibody. A bi-specific (or multispecific)<br>
antibody is capable of binding two (or more) antigens, as with a divalent (or multivalent)<br>
antibody, but in this case, the antigens are different antigens (i.e., the antibody exhibits dual or<br>
greater specificity). For example, an antibody that selectively binds to a protein in the alternative<br>
complement pathway according to the present invention (e.g., an anti-factor B antibody as described<br>
herein) can be constructed as a bi-specific antibody, wherein the second antigen binding specificity<br>
is for a desired target. Therefore, one bi-specific antibody encompassed by the present invention<br>
includes an antibody having: (a) a first portion (e.g., a first antigen binding portion) which binds to<br>
a protein in the alternative complement pathway (e.g., factor B); and (b) a second portion which<br>
binds to a cell surface molecule expressed by a cell, hi this embodiment, the second portion can<br>
bind to any cell surface molecule. One preferred cell surface molecule is a receptor or ligand, so<br>
that the antibody is targeted to a particular cell or tissue type and/or to a particular site in an animal<br>
to which the antibody is delivered. In one embodiment, the second antigen binding specificity is<br>
for a complement receptor. A particularly preferred complement receptor includes, but is not<br>
limited to, complement receptor type 2 (CR2). Antibodies that selectively bind to CR2 and could<br>
therefore be used in this embodiment of the invention are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No.<br>

In one embodiment, antibodies of the present invention include humanized antibodies.<br>
Humanized antibodies are molecules having an antigen binding site derived from an<br>
immunoglobulin from a non-human species, the remaining imrnunoglobulin-derived parts of the<br>
molecule being derived from a human immunoglobulin. The antigen binding site may comprise<br>
either complete variable regions fused onto human constant domains or only the complementarity<br>
determining regions (CDRs) grafted onto appropriate human framework regions in the variable<br>
domains. Humanized antibodies can be produced, for example, by modeling the antibody variable<br>
domains, and producing the antibodies using genetic engineering techniques, such as CDR grafting<br>
(described below). A description various techniques for the production of humanized antibodies<br>
is found, for example, in Morrison et al. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-55; Whittle et<br>
al. (1987)Prot. Eng. 1:499-505; Co et al. (1990)7. Immunol. 148:1149-1154; Co et al. (1992)fVoc.<br>

.<br>
Isolated antibodies of the present invention can include serum containing such antibodies,<br>
or antibodies that have been purified to varying degrees. Whole antibodies of the present invention<br>
can be polyclonal or monoclonal. Alternatively, functional equivalents of whole antibodies, such<br>
as antigen binding fragments in which one or more antibody domains are truncated or absent (e.g.,<br>
Fv, Fab, Fab', or F(ab)2 fragments), as well as genetically-engineered antibodies or antigen binding<br>
fragments thereof, including single chain antibodies, humanized antibodies (discussed above),<br>
antibodies that can bind to more than one epitope (e.g., bi-specific antibodies), or antibodies that<br>
can bind to one or more different antigens (e.g., bi- or multi-specific antibodies), may also be<br>
employed in the invention.<br>
Genetically engineered antibodies of the invention include those produced by standard<br>
recombinant DNA techniques involving the manipulation and re-expression of DNA encoding<br>
antibody variable and/or constant regions. Particular examples include, chimeric antibodies, where<br>
the VH and/or VL domains of the antibody come from a different source as compared to the<br>
remainder of the antibody, and CDR grafted antibodies (and antigen binding fragments thereof), in<br>
which at least one CDR sequence and optionally at least one variable region framework amino acid<br>
is (are) derived from one source and the remaining portions of the variable and the constant regions<br>
(as appropriate) are derived from a different source. Construction of chimeric and CDR-grafted<br>
antibodies are described, for example, in European Patent Applications: EP-A 0194276, EP-A<br>
0239400, EP-A 0451216 and EP-A 0460617.<br>
In one embodiment, chimeric antibodies are produced according to the present invention<br>
comprising antibody variable domains that bind to a protein in the alternative complement pathway<br>
(e.g., factor B) and fused to these domains, a protein that serves as a second targeting moiety. For<br>
example, the targeting moiety can include a protein that is associated with the cell or tissue to be<br>
targeted or with a particular system in the animal. For example, the targeting moiety can be a<br>
portion of a complement receptor. One preferred complement receptor to use in this aspect of the<br>
invention includes complement receptor type 2 (CR2). The use of CR2 and portions thereof in a<br>
fusion or chimeric protein (e.g., as a delivery system) is described in detail in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,820,011.<br>
Generally, in the production of an antibody, a suitable experimental animal, such as, for<br>
example, but not limited to, a rabbit, a sheep, a hamster, a guinea pig, a mouse, a rat, or a chicken,<br>
is exposed to an antigen against which an antibody is desired. Typically, an animal is immunized<br>
with an effective amount of antigen that is injected into the animal. An effective amount of antigen<br>
refers to an amount needed to induce antibody production by the animal. The animal's immune<br>
system is then allowed to respond over a pre-determined period of time. The immunization process<br>
can be repeated until the immune system is found to be producing antibodies to the antigen. In order<br>
to obtain polyclonal antibodies specific for the antigen, serum is collected from the animal that<br>
contains the desired antibodies (or in the case of a chicken, antibody can be collected from the eggs).<br>
Such serum is useful as a reagent. Polyclonal antibodies can be further purified from the serum (or<br>
eggs) by, for example, treating the serum with ammonium sulfate.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies may be produced according to the methodology of Kohler and<br>
Milstein (Nature 256:495-497,1975). For example, B lymphocytes are recovered from the spleen<br>
(or any suitable tissue) of an immunized animal and then fused with myeloma cells to obtain a<br>
population of hybridoma cells capable of continual growth in suitable culture medium. Hybridomas<br>
producing the desired antibody are selected by testing the ability of the antibody produced by the<br>
hybridoma to bind to the desired antigen.<br>
A preferred method to produce antibodies of the present invention includes (a) administering<br>
to an animal an effective amount of a protein or peptide (e.g., a factor B protein or peptide including<br>
domains thereof) to produce the antibodies and (b) recovering the antibodies, hi another method,<br>
antibodies of the present invention are produced recombinantly. For example, once a cell line, for<br>
example a hybridoma, expressing an antibody according to the invention has been obtained, it is<br>
possible to clone therefrom the cDNA and to identify the variable region genes encoding the desired<br>
antibody, including the sequences encoding the CDRs. From here, antibodies and antigen binding<br>
2.2.<br>
fragments according to the invention may be obtained by preparing one or more replicable<br>
expression vectors containing at least the DNA sequence encoding the variable domain of the<br>
antibody heavy or light chain and optionally other DNA sequences encoding remaining portions of<br>
the heavy and/or light chains as desired, and transforming/transfecting an appropriate host cell, in<br>
which production of the antibody will occur. Suitable expression hosts include bacteria, (for<br>
example, an E. coli strain), fungi, (in particular yeasts, e.g. members of the genera Pichia,<br>
Saccharomyces, or Kluyveromyces,} and mammalian cell lines, e.g. a non-producing myeloma cell<br>
line, such as a mouse NSO line, or CHO cells. In order to obtain efficient transcription and<br>
translation, the DNA sequence in each vector should include appropriate regulatory sequences,<br>
particularly a promoter and leader sequence operably linked to the variable domain sequence.<br>
Particular methods for producing antibodies in this way are generally well known and routinely<br>
used. For example, basic molecular biology procedures are described by Maniatis et al. (Molecular<br>
Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, 1989); DNA sequencing can be performed as<br>
described in Sanger et al. (PNAS 74.5463, (1977)) and the Amersham International pic sequencing<br>
handbook; and site directed mutagenesis can be carried out according to the method of Kramer et<br>
al. (Nucl. Acids Res. 12,9441, (1984)) and the Anglian Biotechnology Ltd. handbook. Additionally,<br>
there are numerous publications, including patent specifications, detailing techniques suitable for<br>
the preparation of antibodies by manipulation of DNA, creation of expression vectors and<br>
transformation of appropriate cells, for example as reviewed by Mountain A and Adair, J R in<br>
Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Reviews (ed. Tombs, M P, 10, Chapter 1,1992, Intercept,<br>
Andover, UK) and in the aforementioned European Patent Applications.<br>
Alternative methods, employing, for example, phage display technology (see for example<br>
US 5969108, US 5565332, US 5871907, US 5858657) or the selected lymphocyte antibody method<br>
of US 5627052 may also be used for the production of antibodies and/or antigen fragments of the<br>
invention, as will be readily apparent to the skilled individual.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention therefore generally relates to compositions and<br>
methods for selectively inhibiting the alternative complement pathway in an animal that has, or is<br>
at risk of developing, a condition or disease in which activation of the alternative complement<br>
pathway plays a role (e.g., the alternative complement pathway activation contributes to the<br>
condition or disease, exacerbates at least one symptom of the condition or disease, or causes the<br>
condition or disease). Such method includes the use of the novel factor B antibodies of the present<br>
invention, which have been described in detail above. Such conditions or diseases include, but are<br>
not limited to, conditions associated with airway hyperresponsiveness (including airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness that is associated with inflammation), ischemia-reperfiision injury, and fetal<br>
loss. Compositions and formulations comprising such antibodies and antigen binding fragments<br>
thereof, as well as antigen binding polypeptides that mimic the specificity of the factor B antibodies<br>
described herein, as well as discussion of methods of administration and doses, are described in<br>
detail below.<br>
Method for Prevention or Inhibition of Airway Hyperresponsiveness and Airway Inflammation<br>
Based on the present inventors' discovery that the alternative complement pathway is<br>
necessary and sufficient to inhibit airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation, another<br>
embodiment of the present invention relates to a method to inhibit airway hyperresponsiveness<br>
and/or airway inflammation in an animal that has or is at risk of developing, airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness associated with inflammation or airway inflammation. The method includes<br>
a step of selectively inhibiting the alternative complement pathway in an animal that has, or is at risk<br>
of developing, airway hyperresponsiveness, including airway hyperresponsiveness that is associated<br>
with inflammation (i.e., the airway hyperresponsiveness occurs as a result of inflammation or an<br>
inflammatory process, or occurs in conjunction with concurrent or prior inflammation in the<br>
airways).<br>
The following discussion is provided to elaborate on the aspect of treating or preventing<br>
airway hyperresponsiveness and/or airway inflammation in an animal, or conditions or diseases<br>
related thereto. However, it is to be understood that the general discussion of inhibitors, routes of<br>
administration, doses, indicators of treatment, description of formulations, and the like, can apply<br>
to any of the embodiments of the invention described herein (i.e., to other conditions or diseases<br>
than those associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation). For example,<br>
many of the general aspects of the invention described below can be applied to the specific<br>
inhibition of the alternative complement pathway to treat other conditions, such as ischemiareperfusion<br>
injury.<br>
According to the present invention, to inhibit the alternative complement pathway in an<br>
animal refers to inhibiting the expression and/or the biological activity of at least one protein that<br>
is part of the alternative complement pathway. Such proteins include, but may not be limited to,<br>
factor B, factor D or properdin. To "selectively" inhibit the alternative complement pathway means<br>
that the method of the present invention preferentially or exclusively inhibits the alternative<br>
complement pathway, but does not inhibit or at least does not substantially inhibit other pathways<br>
for complement activation, including the classical complement pathway or the lectin pathway. For<br>
example, the novel factor B antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof of the present<br>
invention are one example of a reagent that selectively inhibits the alternative complement pathway.<br>
This definition applies to other methods described herein wherein the alternative complement<br>
pathway is selectively inhibited.<br>
Inhibition of the alternative complement pathway according to the present invention can be<br>
accomplished by directly affecting the expression (transcription or translation) or biological activity<br>
of a protein in the alternative complement pathway, or by directly affecting the ability of a protein<br>
to bind to a protein in the alternative complement pathway or to otherwise contribute to the<br>
activation of complement via the alternative pathway. More specifically, in one embodiment,<br>
expression of a protein refers to either the transcription of the protein or the translation of the<br>
protein. Therefore, the method of the present invention can inhibit the transcription and/or the<br>
translation of a protein in the animal that naturally expresses the protein (e.g., by administering an<br>
agent that inhibits the expression of the protein and genetically modifying an animal to have reduced<br>
protein expression). In another embodiment, inhibition of the alternative complement pathway is<br>
defined herein as any measurable (detectable) reduction (i.e., decrease, downregulation, inhibition)<br>
of the activity of the pathway, such as by any measurable reduction in the expression and/or<br>
biological activity of a protein within the alternative complement pathway.<br>
According to the present invention, "airway hyperresponsiveness" or "AHR" refers to an<br>
abnormality of the airways that allows them to narrow too easily and/or too much in response to a<br>
stimulus capable of inducing airflow limitation. AHR can be a functional alteration of the<br>
respiratory system resulting from inflammation in the airways (i.e., AHR that is associated with<br>
inflammation) or resulting from airway remodeling (e.g., such as by collagen deposition). Airflow<br>
limitation refers to narrowing of airways that can be irreversible or reversible. Airflow limitation<br>
or airway hyperresponsiveness can be caused by collagen deposition, bronchospasm, airway smooth<br>
muscle hypertrophy, airway smooth muscle contraction, mucous secretion, cellular deposits,<br>
epithelial destruction, alteration to epithelial permeability, alterations to smooth muscle function<br>
or sensitivity, abnormalities of the lung parenchyma and infiltrative diseases in and around the<br>
airways. Many of these causative factors can be associated with inflammation, although AHR is<br>
a symptom that can be distinguished from inflammation (i.e., AHR is a specific condition or<br>
symptom as described above, that can be, but is not always, associated with prior or concurrent<br>
inflammation of the airways). AHR can be triggered in a patient with a condition associated with<br>
the above causative factors by exposure to a provoking agent or stimulus, also referred to herein as<br>
an AHR provoking stimulus. Such stimuli include, but are not limited to, an allergen, methacholine,<br>
ahistamine, a leukotriene, saline, hyperventilation, exercise, sulfur dioxide, adenosine, propranolol,<br>
E5<br>
cold air, an antigen, bradykinin, acetylcholine, aprostaglandin, ozone, environmental air pollutants<br>
and mixtures thereof. The present invention is directed to airway hyperresponsiveness associated<br>
with any respiratory condition that involves inflammation, and particularly, to allergen-induced<br>
airway hyperresponsiveness.<br>
Airway hyperresponsiveness is commonly associated with allergic inflammation and/or<br>
viral-induced inflammation. Airway hyperresponsiveness associated with allergic inflammation can<br>
occur in a patient that has, or is at risk of developing, a condition including, but not limited to, any<br>
chronic obstructive disease of the airways. Such conditions include, but are not limited to: asthma,<br>
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, hypersensitivity<br>
pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, emphysema, bronchitis, allergic bronchitis bronchiectasis,<br>
cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, occupational asthma, sarcoid, reactive<br>
airway disease syndrome, interstitial lung disease, hyper-eosinophilic syndrome, rhinitis, sinusitis,<br>
exercise-induced asthma, pollution-induced asthma and parasitic lung disease. Airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness associated with viral-induced inflammation can occur in a patient that has, or<br>
is at risk of developing, an infection by a virus including, but not limited to, respiratory syncytial<br>
virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), rhino virus (RV) and adenovirus. Other diseases or<br>
conditions to treat using the method and agents of the present invention include any pulmonary<br>
condition or pulmonary complication involving inflammation and/or airway hyperresponsiveness<br>
resulting from a disease, such as from a systemic autoimmune disease. For example, in systemic<br>
lupus erythematosus, pulmonary complications could be treated using the present invention.<br>
Inflammation is typically characterized by the release of inflammatory mediators (e.g.,<br>
cytokines or chemokines) which recruit cells involved in inflammation to a tissue. Airway<br>
inflammation is inflammation that occurs in the airways (lung tissue, respiratory cells and tissue)<br>
of an animal. A condition or disease associated with allergic inflammation is a condition or disease<br>
in which the elicitation of one type of immune response (e.g., a Th2-type immune response) against<br>
a sensitizing agent, such as an allergen, can result in the release of inflammatory mediators that<br>
recruit cells involved in inflammation in an animal, the presence of which can lead to tissue damage<br>
and sometimes death. As discussed above, AHR is frequently associated with (occurs in<br>
conjunction with or perhaps as a result of) airway inflammation. It is noted that the symptom or<br>
condition of AHR can sometimes be treated independently of the symptom of inflammation and vice<br>
versa (e.g., a treatment for AHR may or may not have an impact on inflammation - these are<br>
separable conditions).<br>
AHR can be measured by a stress test that comprises measuring an animal's respiratory<br>
system function in response to a provoking agent (i. e., stimulus). AHR can be measured as a change<br>
in respiratory function from baseline plotted against the dose of a provoking agent (a procedure for<br>
such measurement and a mammal model useful therefore are described in detail below in the<br>
Examples). Respiratory function (and therefore the biological characteristics of AHR) can be<br>
measured by, for example, spirometry, plethysmograph, peak flows, symptom scores, physical signs<br>
(/. e., respiratory rate), wheezing, exercise tolerance, use of rescue medication (i. e., bronchodilators),<br>
cough and blood gases. In humans, spirometry can be used to gauge the change in respiratory<br>
function in conjunction with a provoking agent, such as methacholine or histamine. hi humans,<br>
spirometry is performed by asking a person to take a deep breath and blow, as long, as hard and as<br>
fast as possible into a gauge that measures airflow and volume. The volume of air expired in the<br>
first second is known as forced expiratory volume (FEV,) and the total amount of air expired is<br>
known as the forced vital capacity (FVC). In humans, normal predicted FEV, and FVC are<br>
available and standardized according to weight, height, sex and race. An individual free of disease<br>
has an FEV, and a FVC of at least about 80% of normal predicted values for a particular person and<br>
a ratio of FEV,/FVC of at least about 80%. Values are determined before (i.e, representing a<br>
patient's resting state) and after (i.e., representing a patient's higher lung resistance state) inhalation<br>
of the provoking agent. The position of the resulting curve indicates the sensitivity of the airways<br>
to the provoking agent.<br>
The effect of increasing doses or concentrations of the provoking agent on lung function is<br>
determined by measuring the forced expired volume in 1 second (FEV,) and FEV, over forced vital<br>
capacity (FEV,/FVC ratio) of the animal challenged with the provoking agent. In humans, the dose<br>
or concentration of a provoking agent (i.e., methacholine or histamine) that causes a 20% fall in<br>
FEV, (PC20FEV,) is indicative of the degree of AHR. FEV, and FVC values can be measured using<br>
methods known to those of skill in the art.<br>
Pulmonary function measurements of airway resistance (R.^) and dynamic compliance (CJ<br>
and hyperresponsiveness can be determined by measuring transpulmonary pressure as the pressure<br>
difference between the airway opening and the body plethysmograph. Volume is the calibrated<br>
pressure change in the body plethysmograph and flow is the digital differentiation of the volume<br>
signal. Resistance (RJ and compliance (CJ are obtained using methods known to those of skill in<br>
the art (e.g., such as by using a recursive least squares solution of the equation of motion). It should<br>
be noted that measuring the airway resistance (RJ value in a non-human mammal (e.g., a mouse)<br>
can be used to diagnose airflow obstruction similar to measuring the FEV, and/or FEV,/FVC ratio<br>
in a human.<br>
A variety of provoking agents are useful for measuring AHR values. Suitable provoking<br>
agents include direct and indirect stimuli, and are typically provoking agents that trigger AHR in<br>
vivo. As used herein, the phrase "provoking agent" can be used interchangeably with the phrase<br>
"AHR provoking stimulus". Preferred provoking agents or stimulus include, for example, an<br>
allergen, methacholine, a histamine, organic irritants, irritating gases and chemicals, a leukotriene,<br>
saline, hyperventilation, exercise, sulfur dioxide, adenosine, propranolol, cold air, an antigen,<br>
bradykinin, acetylcholine, aprostaglandin, ozone, environmental air pollutants and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, for experimental induction of AHR, methacholine (Mch) is used as a provoking agent.<br>
Preferred concentrations of Mch to use in a concentration-response curve are between about 0.001<br>
and about 100 milligram per milliliter (mg/ml). More preferred concentrations of Mch to use in a<br>
concentration-response curve are between about 0.01 and about 50 mg/ml. Even more preferred<br>
concentrations of Mch to use in a concentration-response curve are between about 0.02 and about<br>
25 mg/ml. When Mch is used as a provoking agent, the degree of AHR is defined by the<br>
provocative concentration of Mch needed to cause a 20% drop of the FEV, of an animal<br>
(PC20methscholineFEV,). For example, in humans and using standard protocols in the art, a normal<br>
person typically has a PC20methachoiineFEV, &gt;8 mg/ml of Mch. Thus, in humans, AHR is defined as<br>
PC20nKfl]acholineFEV, 
According to the present invention, respiratory function can also be evaluated with a variety<br>
of static tests that comprise measuring an animal's respiratory system function in the absence of a<br>
provoking agent. Examples of static tests include, for example, spirometry, plethysmography, peak<br>
flows, symptom scores, physical signs (i.e., respiratory rate), wheezing, exercise tolerance, use of<br>
rescue medication (i.e., bronchodilators), blood gases and cough. Evaluating pulmonary function<br>
in static tests can be performed by measuring, for example, Total Lung Capacity (TLC), Thoracic<br>
Gas Volume (TgV), Functional Residual Capacity (FRC), Residual Volume (RV) and Specific<br>
Conductance (SGL) for lung volumes, Diffusing Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide<br>
(DLCO), arterial blood gases, including pH, P02 and PC02 for gas exchange. Both FEV, and<br>
FEV,/FVC can be used to measure airflow limitation. If spirometry is used in humans, the FEV,<br>
of an individual can be compared to the FEV, of predicted values. Predicted FEV, values are<br>
available for standard normograms based on the animal's age, sex, weight, height and race. A<br>
normal animal typically has an FEV, at least about 80% of the predicted FEV, for the animal.<br>
Airflow limitation results in a FEV, or FVC of less than 80% of predicted values. An alternative<br>
2.8<br>
method to measure airflow limitation is based on the ratio of FEV, and FVC (FEV,/FVC). Disease<br>
free individuals are defined as having a FEV,/FVC ratio of at least about 80%. Airflow obstruction<br>
causes the ratio of FEV,/FVC to fall to less than 80% of predicted values. Thus, an animal having<br>
airflow limitation is defined by an FEV,/FVC less than about 80%.<br>
As used herein, to reduce airway hyperresponsiveness refers to any measurable reduction<br>
in airway hyperresponsiveness and/or any reduction of the occurrence or frequency with which<br>
airway hyperresponsiveness occurs in a patient. A reduction in AHR can be measured using any<br>
of the above-described techniques or any other suitable method known in the art. Preferably, airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness, or the potential therefor, is reduced, optimally, to an extent that the animal no<br>
longer suffers discomfort and/or altered function resulting from or associated with airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness. To prevent airway hyperresponsiveness refers to preventing or stopping the<br>
induction of airway hyperresponsiveness before biological characteristics of airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness as discussed herein can be substantially detected or measured in a patient.<br>
Once one or more of the biological characteristics of airway hyperresponsiveness can be<br>
substantially detected or measured, acute onset airway hyperresponsiveness is deemed to have<br>
occurred.<br>
In one embodiment, the method of the present invention decreases methacholine<br>
responsiveness in the animal. Preferably, the method of the present invention results in an<br>
improvement in an animal's PCto-hoFEV, value such that the PC20m(;thachoUn<.fev1 value obtained></.fev1>
before use of the present method when the animal is provoked with a first concentration of<br>
methacholine is the same as the PCehoiineFEV, value obtained after use of the present method<br>
when the animal is provoked with double the amount of the first concentration of methacholine.<br>
Preferably, the method of the present invention results in an improvement in an animal's<br>
pC20methachoIineFEV, value such that the PC20methacholineFEV, value obtained before the use of the present<br>
method when the animal is provoked with between about 0.01 mg/ml to about 8 mg/ml of<br>
methacholine is the same as the PC20methach0|ineFEV, value obtained after the use of the present<br>
method when the animal is provoked with between about 0.02 mg/ml to about 16 mg/ml of<br>
methacholine.<br>
In another embodiment, the method of the present invention improves an animal's FEV, by<br>
at least about 5%, and more preferably by between about 6% and about 100%, more preferably by<br>
between about 7% and about 100%, and even more preferably by between about 8% and about<br>
100% of the animal's predicted FEV,. In another embodiment, the method of the present invention<br>
improves an animal's FEV, by at least about 5%, and preferably, at least about 10%, and even more<br>
preferably, at least about 25%, and even more preferably, at least about 50%, and even more<br>
preferably, at least about 75%.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the method of the present invention results in an increase in the<br>
PQomethachoiineFEV, animal by about one doubling concentration towards the PC20methach0|ineFEV1<br>
of a normal animal. A normal animal refers to an animal known not to suffer from or be susceptible<br>
to abnormal AHR. A patient, or test animal refers to an animal suspected of suffering from or being<br>
susceptible to abnormal AHR.<br>
Therefore, an animal that has airway hyperresponsiveness is an animal in which airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness can be measured or detected, such as by using one of the above methods for<br>
measuring airway hyperresponsiveness, wherein the airway hyperresponsiveness is typically induced<br>
by exposure to an AHR provoking stimulus, as described above. Similarly, an animal that has<br>
allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness is an animal in which airway hyperresponsiveness can<br>
be measured or detected, such as by using one of the above methods for measuring airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness, wherein the airway hyperresponsiveness is induced by exposure to an allergen.<br>
To be induced by an AHR provoking stimulus, such as an allergen, the airway hyperresponsiveness<br>
is apparently or obviously, directly or indirectly triggered by (e.g., caused by, a symptom of,<br>
indicative of, concurrent with) an exposure to the stimulus. Symptoms, or biological characteristics,<br>
of AHR include, but are not limited to, indicators of altered respiratory function (described in detail<br>
above), change in respiratory rate, wheezing, lowered exercise tolerance, cough and altered blood<br>
gases. Detection or measurement of any one or more of such symptoms is indicative of the onset<br>
of acute AHR.<br>
In the case of an allergen, the airway hyperresponsiveness is apparently or obviously, directly<br>
or indirectly triggered by an allergen to which an animal has previously been sensitized.<br>
Sensitization to an allergen refers to being previously exposed one or more times to an allergen such<br>
that an immune response is developed against the allergen. Responses associated with an allergic<br>
reaction (e.g., histamine release, rhinitis, edema, vasodilation, bronchial constriction or airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation), typically do not occur when a naive individual is<br>
exposed to the allergen for the first time, but once a cellular and humoral immune response is<br>
produced against the allergen, the individual is "sensitized" to the allergen. Allergic reactions then<br>
occur when the sensitized individual is re-exposed to the same allergen (e.g., an allergen challenge).<br>
Once an individual is sensitized to an allergen, the allergic reactions can become worse with each<br>
subsequent exposure to the allergen, because each re-exposure not only produces allergic symptoms,<br>
but further increases the level of antibody produced against the allergen and the level of T cell<br>
response against the allergen.<br>
Typically, conditions associated with allergic responses to antigens (i.e., allergens) are at<br>
least partially characterized by inflammation of pulmonary tissues. Such conditions or diseases are<br>
discussed above. It is noted that this embodiment of the present invention is specifically directed<br>
to the treatment of AHR, and as such, it is not required that the related condition or causative factor<br>
that caused the AHR, such as allergic inflammation, be significantly reduced or "cured", although<br>
the effects of the present method likely extend to inhibition of allergic inflammation. The method<br>
of the present invention is fully effective to reduce AHR even after the inflammatory response in<br>
the lungs of the animal is fully established. An animal that is at risk of developing airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness is an animal that has been exposed to, or is at risk of being exposed to, an AHR<br>
provoking stimulus that is sufficient to trigger AHR, but does not yet display a measurable or<br>
detectable characteristic or symptom of airway hyperresponsiveness, such symptoms being<br>
described previously herein. An animal that is at risk of developing allergen-induced airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness is an animal that has been previously sensitized to an allergen, and that has<br>
been exposed to, or is at risk of being exposed to, an amount of the allergen that is sufficient to<br>
trigger AHR (/. e., a triggering, or challenge dose of allergen), but does not yet display a measurable<br>
or detectable characteristic or symptom of airway hyperresponsiveness. An animal that is at risk<br>
of developing airway hyperresponsiveness also includes an animal that is identified as being<br>
predisposed to or susceptible to such a condition or disease.<br>
The method of the present invention can also inhibit or reduce airway inflammation in an<br>
animal. Inflammation, and particularly eosinophilic inflammation, is a hallmark of many respiratory<br>
diseases, including asthma. Airway inflammation can be evaluated using several parameters<br>
including, but not limited to, accumulation of inflammatory cells (e.g., eosinophils, macrophages,<br>
neutrophils, lymphocytes) in the lungs, altered levels of various cytokines (e.g., EL-4, IL-5, IL-10,<br>
IL-12, IL-13 and IFN-y) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and/or a change in mucus<br>
production in the lungs. Measurement of many of these parameters are exemplified in the<br>
Examples.<br>
Agents and formulations of the present invention can be administered to any animal patient,<br>
and preferably to humans. According to the present invention, administration of an agent or<br>
formulation is useful to inhibit AHR, airway inflammation, or to treat a disease associated with such<br>
conditions. Patients whom are suitable candidates for the method of the present invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, patients that have, or are at risk of developing (e.g., are predisposed to), such<br>
a condition or disease. As discussed above, the present invention is primarily directed to the<br>
treatment of AHR and/or airway inflammation, and as such, it is not required that the condition or<br>
causative factor that caused the AHR or airway inflammation, or the disease associated with these<br>
conditions, be significantly reduced or "cured", although the effects of the present method likely<br>
extend to a significant therapeutic benefit for the patient. This concept also generally applies to<br>
other conditions and diseases in which the alternative complement pathway plays a role.<br>
As such, a therapeutic benefit is not necessarily a cure for a particular disease or condition<br>
(including any disease or condition described herein), but rather, preferably encompasses a result<br>
which most typically includes alleviation of the disease or condition, elimination of the disease or<br>
condition, reduction of a symptom associated with the disease or condition, prevention or alleviation<br>
of a secondary disease or condition resulting from the occurrence of a primary disease or condition,<br>
and/or prevention of the disease or condition. As used herein, the phrase "protected from a disease"<br>
refers to reducing the symptoms of the disease; reducing the occurrence of the disease, and/or<br>
reducing the severity of the disease. Protecting a patient can refer to the ability of a composition<br>
of the present invention, when administered to a patient, to prevent a disease from occurring and/or<br>
to cure or to alleviate disease symptoms, signs or causes. As such, to protect a patient from a<br>
disease includes both preventing disease occurrence (prophylactic treatment) and treating a patient<br>
that has a disease (therapeutic treatment). A beneficial effect can easily be assessed by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art and/or by a trained clinician who is treating the patient. The term, "disease"<br>
refers to any deviation from the normal health of a mammal and includes a state when disease<br>
symptoms are present, as well as conditions in which a deviation (e.g., infection, gene mutation,<br>
genetic defect, etc.) has occurred, but symptoms are not yet manifested.<br>
Accordingly, the method of the present invention includes the use of a variety of agents (i.e.,<br>
regulatory compounds) which, by acting directly on a protein in the alternative complement<br>
pathway, selectively inhibit the expression and/or biological activity of one or more proteins in the<br>
alternative complement pathway such that airway hyperresponsiveness and/or airway inflammation<br>
is reduced hi an animal. Agents useful in the present invention include, for example, proteins,<br>
nucleic acid molecules, antibodies, and compounds that are products of rational drug design (i.e.,<br>
drugs). Such agents are generally referred to herein as inhibitors. According to the present<br>
invention, an inhibitor is any agent which inhibits, either by direct inhibition or competitive<br>
inhibition, the expression and/or biological activity of a protein (e.g., a protein in the alternative<br>
complement pathway), and includes agents which act on factor B, factor D or properdin. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, inhibition of the alternative complement pathway or a protein<br>
of the alternative complement pathway is defined herein as any measurable (detectable) reduction<br>
(i.e., decrease, downregulation, inhibition) of the biological activity of a protein in the alternative<br>
complement pathway. The biological activity or biological action of a protein refers to any<br>
function(s) exhibited or performed by a naturally occurring form of the protein as measured or<br>
observed in vivo (i.e., in the natural physiological environment of the protein) or in vitro (i.e., under<br>
laboratory conditions). For example, a biological activity of factor B can include, but is not limited<br>
to, binding to activated C3, solubilization of immune complexes, B cell growth factor activity, and<br>
monocyte activation. According to the present invention, the biological activity of a protein can be<br>
inhibited by directly preventing or inhibiting (reducing, decreasing) the ability of the protein to bind<br>
to and/or activate another protein (e.g., C3), thereby inhibiting downstream events resulting from<br>
such binding. Preferably, the biological activity of the alternative complement pathway is inhibited<br>
by administering an agent that inhibits at least one protein in the pathway, such agent including, but<br>
not limited to, an agent that binds to a protein in the pathway or competes with the protein in the<br>
pathway in a manner that the ability of the protein to bind to and/or activate another protein is<br>
inhibited or prevented. Such an agent includes, but is not limited to antagonists of the protein,<br>
antibodies (including antigen-binding fragments thereof), other antigen binding polypeptides, and<br>
small molecules (e.g. synthetic compounds or drugs).<br>
One agent useful in the present invention is an antagonist of the alternative complement<br>
pathway, including an antagonist of a protein Within this pathway. According to the present<br>
invention, an "antagonist" refers to any compound which inhibits (e.g., antagonizes, reduces,<br>
decreases, blocks, reverses, or alters) the effect of a given protein. More particularly, an antagonist<br>
is capable of acting in a manner relative to the given protein's activity, such that the biological<br>
activity of the given protein, is decreased or blocked in a manner that is antagonistic (e.g., against,<br>
a reversal of, contrary to) to the natural action of the given protein. Antagonists can include, but<br>
are not limited to, an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof, a protein, peptide, nucleic acid<br>
(including ribozymes and antisense), or a product of drug/compound/peptide design or selection mat<br>
provides the antagonistic effect. For example, the present invention includes any antagonists of the<br>
natural proteins, factor B, factor D or properdin, including antibody antagonists, protein/peptide<br>
antagonists, nucleic acid antagonists, or small molecule antagonists (e.g., a small molecule<br>
inhibitor).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the agent used for inhibiting a protein<br>
of the alternative complement pathway is an antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof.<br>
Similarly, an antigen binding polypeptide is also particularly preferred for use in the present<br>
invention. In one aspect, the antibody selectively binds to the protein of the alternative complement<br>
pathway in a manner such that the protein is inhibited or prevented from binding to another protein<br>
with which it normally (under natural or physiological conditions) interacts. In another aspect, the<br>
antibody selectively binds to the protein in a manner such that the protein is inhibited or prevented<br>
from activating another protein with which it normally interacts, even though the protein may at<br>
least partially bind to the other protein. Particularly preferred antibodies and antigen binding<br>
fragments thereof for use in selective inhibition of the alternative complement pathway have been<br>
described in detail above (e.g., the factor B antibodies described herein, and particularly, the<br>
mAbl379 antibody described in detail herein).<br>
Preferably, an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof useful in the present invention<br>
binds to a protein selected from factor B, factor D or properdin. Most preferably, the invention<br>
includes an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that binds to factor B. Antibodies (and<br>
antigen binding fragments thereof) that selectively bind to factor B and inhibit the alternative<br>
complement pathway according to the invention are described and exemplified in detail herein. In<br>
one embodiment, the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof binds to a conserved binding<br>
surface or epitope of such a protein that is conserved among animal species, and particularly<br>
mammalian, species (i.e., the antibody is cross-reactive with the protein from two or more different<br>
mammalian species). In particular, the present invention includes an antibody that binds to a protein<br>
in the alternative complement pathway from at least two, and preferably, several different<br>
mammalian species, including, but not limited to, human, non-human primate, mouse, rat, pig, horse<br>
and rabbit.<br>
The invention also extends to non-antibody polypeptides, sometimes referred to as antigen<br>
binding partners or antigen binding polypeptides, that have been designed to bind selectively to and<br>
cause the neutralization or inhibition of a protein according to the present invention. Examples of<br>
the design of such polypeptides, which possess a prescribed ligand specificity are given in Beste et<br>
al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 96:1898-1903,1999), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The present invention includes, in addition to antibodies, antigen-binding fragments thereof,<br>
and antigen binding polypeptides, other agents that inhibit a protein hi the alternative complement<br>
pathway. Such agents include, for example, compounds that are products of rational drug design,<br>
natural products, and compounds having partially defined regulatory properties. A regulatory agent,<br>
including an antagonist of a given protein, can be a protein-based compound, a carbohydrate-based<br>
compound, a lipid-based compound, a nucleic acid-based compound, a natural organic compound,<br>
a synthetically derived organic compound, an antibody, or fragments thereof. In one embodiment,<br>
34<br>
such regulatory agents of the present invention include drugs, including peptides, oligonucleorides,<br>
carbohydrates and/or synthetic organic molecules which regulate the production and/or function of<br>
one or more proteins in the alternative complement pathway. Such an agent can be obtained, for<br>
example, from molecular diversity strategies (a combination of related strategies allowing the rapid<br>
construction of large, chemically diverse molecule libraries), libraries of natural or synthetic<br>
compounds, hi particular from chemical or combinatorial libraries (i.e., libraries of compounds that<br>
differ in sequence or size but that have the same building blocks) or by rational drug design. See<br>
for example, Maulik et al., 1997, Molecular Biotechnology: Therapeutic Applications and<br>
Strategies, Wiley-Liss, Inc., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
In a molecular diversity strategy, large compound libraries are synthesized, for example,<br>
from peptides, oligonucleotides, carbohydrates and/or synthetic organic molecules, using biological,<br>
enzymatic and/or chemical approaches. The critical parameters in developing a molecular diversity<br>
strategy include subunit diversity, molecular size, and library diversity. The general goal of<br>
screening such libraries is to utilize sequential application of combinatorial selection to obtain highaffinity<br>
ligands against a desired target, and then optimize the lead molecules by either random or<br>
directed design strategies. Methods of molecular diversity are described in detail in Maulik, et al.,<br>
supra.<br>
In a rational drug design procedure, the three-dimensional structure of a regulatory<br>
compound can be analyzed by, for example, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or X-ray<br>
crystallography. This three-dimensional structure can then be used to predict structures of potential<br>
compounds, such as potential regulatory agents by, for example, computer modeling. The predicted<br>
compound structure can be used to optimize lead compounds derived, for example, by molecular<br>
diversity methods. In addition, the predicted compound structure can be produced by, for example,<br>
chemical synthesis, recombinant DNA technology, or by isolating a mimetope from a natural source<br>
(e.g., plants, animals, bacteria and fungi).<br>
Various other methods of structure-based drug design are disclosed in Maulik et al., 1997,<br>
supra. Maulik et al. disclose, for example, methods of directed design, in which the user directs the<br>
process of creating novel molecules from a fragment library of appropriately selected fragments;<br>
random design, in which the user uses a genetic or other algorithm to randomly mutate fragments<br>
and their combinations while simultaneously applying a selection criterion to evaluate the fitness<br>
of candidate ligands; and a grid-based approach in which the user calculates the interaction energy<br>
between three dimensional receptor structures and small fragment probes, followed by linking<br>
together of favorable probe sites.<br>
An isolated nucleic acid molecule that is useful as an agent for inhibiting a protein in the<br>
alternative complement pathway is an anti-sense nucleic acid molecule, a ribozyme or siRNA. As<br>
used herein, an anti-sense nucleic acid molecule is defined as an isolated nucleic acid molecule that<br>
reduces expression of a protein by hybridizing under high stringency conditions to a gene encoding<br>
the protein. Such a nucleic acid molecule is sufficiently similar to the gene encoding the protein that<br>
the molecule is capable of hybridizing under high stringency conditions to the coding or<br>
complementary strand of the gene or RNA encoding the natural protein. RNA interference (RNAi)<br>
is a process whereby double stranded RNA, and in mammalian systems, short interfering RNA<br>
(siRNA), is used to inhibit or silence expression of complementary genes. In the target cell, siRNA<br>
are unwound and associate with an RNA induced silencing complex (RISC), which is then guided<br>
to the mRNA sequences that are complementary to the siRNA, whereby the RISC cleaves the<br>
mRNA. A ribozyme is an RNA segment that functions by binding to the target RNA moiety and<br>
inactivate it by cleaving the phosphodiester backbone at a specific cutting site.<br>
A gene includes regulatory regions that control production of the protein encoded by that<br>
gene (such as, but not limited to, transcription, translation or post-translation control regions) as<br>
well as the coding region itself. The genes encoding various proteins of the alternative complement<br>
pathway, including factor B, factor D or properdin, have been identified and are known in the art.<br>
An isolated nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that has been removed from its natural<br>
milieu (i.e., that has been subject to human manipulation) and can include DNA, RNA, or<br>
derivatives of either DNA or RNA. As such, "isolated" does not reflect the extent to which the<br>
nucleic acid molecule has been purified. An isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention<br>
can be isolated from its natural source or produced using recombinant DNA technology (e.g.,<br>
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, cloning) or chemical synthesis.<br>
As used herein, reference to hybridization conditions refers to standard hybridization<br>
conditions under which nucleic acid molecules are used to identify similar nucleic acid molecules.<br>
Such standard conditions are disclosed, for example, in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A<br>
Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Labs Press, 1989. Sambrook et al., ibid., is incorporated<br>
by reference herein in its entirety (see specifically, pages 9.31-9.62). In addition, formulae to<br>
calculate the appropriate hybridization and wash conditions to achieve hybridization permitting<br>
varying degrees of mismatch of nucleotides are disclosed, for example, in Meinkoth et al., 1984,<br>
Anal. Biochem. 138, 267-284; Meinkoth et al., ibid., is incorporated by reference herein in its<br>
entirety.<br>
Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention relates to the inventors' discovery that the<br>
inhibition of factor B, for example, using the anti-factor B antibodies or antigen binding fragments<br>
thereof described herein, also inhibits ischemia-reperfusion injury. This was demonstrated in a<br>
model for renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, the methods and compositions of the<br>
present invention also have therapeutic utility in a conditions related to ischemia-reperfusion injury,<br>
and in one aspect of the invention, renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Other types of ischemiareperfusion<br>
injury that can be prevented or reduced using this method include, but are not limited<br>
to, cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury, central nervous system ischemia-reperfusion injury,<br>
ischemia-reperfusion injury of the limbs or digits, ischemia-reperfusion of internal organs such as<br>
the lung, liver or intestine, or ischemia-reperfusion injury of any transplanted organ or tissue.<br>
This method of the invention includes a step of selectively inhibiting the alternative<br>
complement pathway in an animal that has, or is at risk of experiencing or developing, ischemiareperfusion.<br>
Preferably, at least one symptom or type of injury due to ischemia-reperfusion is<br>
prevented or inhibited. Ischemia-reperfusion injury can cause increases in the production of or<br>
oxidation of various potentially harmful compounds produced by cells and tissues, which can lead<br>
to oxidative damage to or death of cells and tissues. For example, renal ischemia-reperfusion injury<br>
can result in histological damage to the kidneys, including kidney tubular damage and changes<br>
characteristic of acute tubular necrosis. The resultant renal dysfunction permits the accumulation<br>
of nitrogenous wastes ordinarily excreted by the kidney, such as serum urea nitrogen (SUN).<br>
Ischemia-reperfusion may also cause injury to remote organs, such as the lung. The method<br>
preferably utilizes the novel factor B antibodies of the present invention as described in detail above<br>
which, when administered to an animal that has, or is at risk of experiencing or developing,<br>
ischemia-reperfusion, prevents, reduces or inhibits at least one symptom of injury due to ischemiareperfusion.<br>
Any of the factor B antibodies of the present invention as described herein, or antigen<br>
binding fragments thereof, or antigen binding polypeptides having a similar binding specificity, are<br>
useful in this embodiment of the invention. A description of preferred doses, routes of<br>
administration, and compositions and formulations comprising such antibodies and related reagents<br>
in various methods of the invention is provided herein and is encompassed by this embodiment.<br>
It is noted that this embodiment of the present invention is specifically directed to the<br>
treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury, and as such, it is not required that the related condition<br>
or causative factor that caused the ischemia-reperfusion injury be significantly reduced or "cured".<br>
The method of the present invention is fully effective to prevent or reduce damage or injury<br>
associated with ischemia-reperfusion or to improve or reduce at least one symptom of such injury.<br>
Therefore, administration of an agent or formulation described herein is useful for the prevention<br>
or inhibition of ischemia-reperfusion injury, although it is not required that all such injury be<br>
completely prevented, but it is preferred that the patient experience at least one therapeutic benefit<br>
from the use of the agent or formulation.<br>
Formulations, Compositions, and Methods Related to the Embodiments of the Invention<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention also includes a formulation or composition<br>
comprising an inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway and particularly, a selective inhibitor<br>
of the alternative complement pathway as described herein. The formulations or compositions can<br>
be used in any of the methods described herein and with any of the reagents described herein (e.g.,<br>
the novel factor B antibodies described herein). In one embodiment, the composition is useful for<br>
reducing or preventing airway hyperresponsiveness in an animal. In another embodiment, the<br>
composition is useful for reducing or preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury in an animal. In yet<br>
another embodiment, the composition is useful for treating or preventing a condition or disease by<br>
selective inhibition of the alternative complement pathway. The formulation comprises: (a) an<br>
inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway as described herein; and (b) a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier.<br>
hi one embodiment, the formulation or composition can include one or more additional<br>
agents, such as an anti-inflammatory agent suitable for reducing inflammation in an animal that has,<br>
or is at risk of developing, airway hyperresponsiveness, and particularly, airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness that is associated with inflammation. The anti-inflammatory agent can be any<br>
anti-inflammatory agent which is suitable for use in reducing inflammation in a patient that has an<br>
inflammatory condition associated with airway hyperresponsiveness, including, but not limited to:<br>
corticosteroids, (oral, inhaled and injected), p-agonists (long or short acting), leukotriene modifiers<br>
(inhibitors or receptor antagonists), cytokine or cytokine receptor antagonists, anti-IgE,<br>
phosphodiesterase inhibitors, sodium cromoglycate, nedocrimal, theophylline, and inhibitors of T<br>
cell function. Particularly preferred anti-inflammatory agents for use in the present formulation<br>
include, corticosteroids, leukotriene modifiers, and cytokine or cytokine receptor antagonists.<br>
hi another embodiment, the formulation or composition can include one or more additional<br>
agents, such as an additional agent suitable for preventing or reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury<br>
in an animal. Such agents include, but are not limited to, anti-inflammatory agents; or inhibitors<br>
of oxidation and free radical damage.<br>
In another embodiment, the formulation or composition can include one or more additional<br>
agents, such as an additional agent suitable for treatment of another disease or condition associated<br>
with activation of the alternative complement pathway.<br>
According to the present invention, a "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and/or pharmaceutically acceptable delivery vehicles, which<br>
are suitable for use in the administration of a formulation or composition to a suitable in vivo site.<br>
A suitable in vivo site is preferably any site wherein the alternative complement pathway can be<br>
inhibited. In one preferred embodiment, when the patient has or is at risk of developing airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness and/or airway inflammation, a suitable in vivo site is preferably in the lung<br>
tissue or airways. Other preferred in vivo sites include other tissues or organs where conditions<br>
associated with the alternative complement pathway may be centered. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, a suitable in vivo site is any site where ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs, such as in<br>
the heart or pulmonary system, central nervous system, limbs or digits, internal organs (e.g., lung,<br>
liver or intestine), or in any transplanted organ or tissue. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers are capable of maintaining an agent used in a formulation of the invention in a form that,<br>
upon arrival of the agent at the target site in a patient, the agent is capable of acting on its target<br>
(e.g., a protein that is a component of the alternative complement pathway), preferably resulting in<br>
a therapeutic benefit to the patient.<br>
Suitable excipients of the present invention include excipients or formularies .that transport<br>
or help transport, but do not specifically target a composition to a cell or tissue (also referred to<br>
herein as non-targeting carriers). Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include, but<br>
are not limited to water, phosphate buffered saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, serumcontaining<br>
solutions, Hank's solution, other aqueous physiologically balanced solutions, oils, esters<br>
and glycols. Aqueous carriers can contain suitable auxiliary substances required to approximate the<br>
physiological conditions of the recipient, for example, by enhancing chemical stability and<br>
isotonicity. Suitable auxiliary substances include, for example, sodium acetate, sodium chloride,<br>
sodium lactate, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, and other substances used to produce<br>
phosphate buffer, Tris buffer, and bicarbonate buffer. Auxiliary substances can also include<br>
preservatives, such as thimerosal, m- or o-cresol, formalin and benzol alcohol. Formulations of the<br>
present invention can be sterilized by conventional methods and/or lyophilized.<br>
One type of pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes a controlled release formulation<br>
that is capable of slowly releasing a composition of the present invention into an animal. As used<br>
herein, a controlled release formulation comprises an agent of the present invention in a controlled<br>
release vehicle. Suitable controlled release vehicles include, but are not limited to, biocompatible<br>
polymers, other polymeric matrices, capsules, microcapsules, microparticles, bolus preparations,<br>
osmotic pumps, diffusion devices, liposomes, lipospheres, and transdermal delivery systems. Other<br>
suitable carriers include any carrier that can be bound to or incorporated with the agent that extends<br>
that half-life of the agent to be delivered. Such a carrier can include any suitable protein carrier or<br>
even a fusion segment that extends the half-life of a protein when delivered in vivo. Suitable<br>
delivery vehicles have been previously described herein, and include, but are not limited to<br>
liposomes, viral vectors or other delivery vehicles, including ribozymes. Natural lipid-containing<br>
delivery vehicles include cells and cellular membranes. Artificial lipid-containing delivery vehicles<br>
include liposomes and micelles. As discussed above, a delivery vehicle of the present invention can<br>
be modified to target to a particular site in a patient, thereby targeting and making use of an<br>
inhibitory agent at that site. Suitable modifications include manipulating the chemical formula of<br>
the lipid portion of the delivery vehicle and/or introducing into the vehicle a targeting agent capable<br>
of specifically targeting a delivery vehicle to a preferred site, for example, a preferred cell type.<br>
Other suitable delivery vehicles include gold particles, poly-L-lysine/DNA-molecular conjugates,<br>
and artificial chromosomes.<br>
In one embodiment, an agent useful in the present methods is administered in a formulation<br>
suitable for pulmonary or nasal delivery, and particularly, aerosol delivery, also referred to herein<br>
as an aerosolized formulation. Such a route of delivery is particularly useful in the method to<br>
prevent or inhibit AHR and/or airway inflammation in a patient, but can be used in other conditions<br>
when delivery to the lung or airways is desired, hi addition, these formulations are particularly<br>
useful for the delivery of antibodies. Such a formulation generally includes a carrier, and preferably,<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Carriers that are particularly useful for aerosol delivery<br>
according to the present invention include, but are not limited to: anhydrous ethanol; dry, dispersible<br>
powders; small capsules (e.g., microcapsules or microparticles); liposomes; injectable excipients;<br>
and nebulized sprays. Anhydrous ethanol for the delivery of proteins and peptides is described, for<br>
example, in Choi et al., 2001, PNAS USA 98(20): 11103-11107. Dry, dispersible powders suitable<br>
for aerosolized delivery of agents are described in detail, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 6,165,463,<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety (See also products from Inhale Therapeutic Systems,<br>
Inc., now Nektar, and Quadrant Technology). Suitable liposomes for use in aerosols include any<br>
liposome, and particularly, any liposome that is sufficiently small to be delivered by aerosol in the<br>
method of the invention. Microcapsules and microparticles are known in the art. For example,<br>
Alliance Pharmaceutical Corporation has a particle engineering technology, called PulmoSphere,<br>
40<br>
prepared by a proprietary spray-drying process and are designed to be both hollow and porous. A<br>
product by Ventolin consists of micronized albuterol (free base) particles suspended in a mixture<br>
of CFC-based propellants. Proventil HFA contains micronized albuterol sulfate and a small<br>
percentage of an ethanol co-solvent to solubilize the stabilizing oleic acid surfactant. Incorporation<br>
of drugs into liposomes has several advantages for aerosol delivery. Because liposomes are<br>
relatively insoluble, the retention time of some drugs in the lung can be prolonged for increased<br>
efficacy. Liposomes are also taken up primarily by phagocytic cells which make them particularly<br>
suitable for delivery of certain drugs. Nebulized formulations are described in the Examples.<br>
Devices for delivery of aerosolized formulations include, but are not limited to, pressurized metered<br>
dose inhalers (MDI), dry powder inhalers (DPI), metered solution devices (MSI), and ultrasonic<br>
inhalers, and include devices that are nebulizers and inhalers. Various agents can be used in<br>
formulations delivered by such devices as suspension aids and solubilizers that are particularly<br>
useful for the delivery of proteins (e.g., oligolactic acid, acyl-amide acids, and mono-functionalized<br>
M-PEGS; see, McKenzie and Oliver; 2000; Formulating Therapeutic Proteins and Peptides in<br>
Pressurized Metered Dose Inhalers For Pulmonary Delivery; 3M Health Care Ltd., Morley Street,<br>
Loughborough, Leicesteshire LEI 1 1EP, UK).<br>
A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is capable of targeting is herein referred to as<br>
a "targeting delivery vehicle." Targeting delivery vehicles of the present invention are capable of<br>
delivering a formulation, including an inhibitory agent, to a target site in a patient. A "target site"<br>
refers to a site in a patient to which one desires to deliver a therapeutic formulation. For example,<br>
a target site can be any cell or tissue which is targeted by an antibody of the present invention, or<br>
by direct injection or delivery using liposomes, viral vectors or other delivery vehicles, including<br>
ribozymes. A delivery vehicle or antibody of the present invention can be modified to target to a<br>
particular site in an animal, thereby targeting and making use of particular compound, antibody,<br>
protein, or nucleic acid molecule at that site. Suitable modifications include manipulating the<br>
chemical formula of the lipid portion of a delivery vehicle and/or introducing into the vehicle a<br>
compound capable of specifically targeting a delivery vehicle to a preferred site, for example, a<br>
preferred cell or tissue type. Specifically, targeting refers to causing a delivery vehicle to bind to<br>
a particular cell by the interaction of the compound in the vehicle to a molecule on the surface of<br>
the cell. Suitable targeting compounds include ligands capable of selectively (i.e., specifically)<br>
binding another molecule at a particular site. Examples of such ligands include antibodies, antigens,<br>
receptors and receptor ligands. Particularly useful examples include any ligands that are associated<br>
with the complement pathway (e.g., CR2, C3, C3d, C3dg, iC3b, C3b) or any ligands that are<br>
associated with the cell type, tissue type, or site in the animal to be treated. Manipulating the<br>
chemical formula of tie lipid portion of the delivery vehicle can modulate the extracellular or<br>
intracellular targeting of the delivery vehicle. For example, a chemical can be added to the lipid<br>
formula of a liposome that alters the charge of the lipid bilayer of the liposome so that the liposome<br>
fuses with particular cells having particular charge characteristics.<br>
One delivery vehicle useful for a variety of administration routes and agents is a liposome.<br>
A liposome is capable of remaining stable in an animal for a sufficient amount of time to deliver<br>
a nucleic acid molecule, or even a protein or antibody, described in the present invention to a<br>
preferred site in the animal. A liposome, according to the present invention, comprises a lipid<br>
composition that is capable of delivering a nucleic acid molecule described in the present invention<br>
to a particular, or selected, site in an animal. A liposome according to the present invention<br>
comprises a lipid composition that is capable of fusing with the plasma membrane of the targeted<br>
cell to deliver a nucleic acid molecule into a cell. Suitable liposomes for use with the present<br>
invention include any liposome. Preferred liposomes of the present invention include those<br>
liposomes typically used in, for example, gene delivery methods known to those of skill in the art.<br>
More preferred liposomes comprise liposomes having a polycationic lipid composition and/or<br>
liposomes having a cholesterol backbone conjugated to polyethylene glycol. Complexing a<br>
liposome with a nucleic acid molecule or inhibitory agent of the present invention can be achieved<br>
using methods standard in the art.<br>
Another delivery vehicle comprises a viral vector. A viral vector includes an isolated<br>
nucleic acid molecule useful in the method of the present invention, in which the nucleic acid<br>
molecules are packaged hi a viral coat that allows entrance of DNA into a cell. A number of viral<br>
vectors can be used, including, but not limited to, those based on alphaviruses, poxviruses,<br>
adenoviruses, herpesviruses, lentiviruses, adeno-associated viruses and retroviruses.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, determination of acceptable protocols to administer<br>
an agent, composition or formulation, including the route of administration and the effective amount<br>
of an agent to be administered to an animal, can be accomplished by those skilled in the art. An<br>
agent of the present invention can be administered in vivo or ex vivo. Suitable in vivo routes of<br>
administration can include, but are not limited to, oral, nasal, inhaled, topical, intratracheal,<br>
transdermal, rectal, and parenteral routes. Preferred parenteral routes can include, but are not<br>
limited to, subcutaneous, intradermal, intravenous, intramuscular, and intraperitoneal routes.<br>
Preferred topical routes include inhalation by aerosol (i.e., spraying) or topical surface<br>
administration to the skin of an animal. Preferably, an agent is administered by nasal, inhaled,<br>
intratracheal, topical, or systemic routes (e.g., intraperitoneal, intravenous). Ex vivo refers to<br>
performing part of the administration step outside of the patient. Preferred routes of administration<br>
for antibodies include parenteral routes and aerosol/nasal/inhaled routes.<br>
Intravenous, intraperitoneal, and intramuscular administrations can be performed using<br>
methods standard in the art. Aerosol (inhalation) delivery can be performed using methods standard<br>
in the art (see, for example, Stribling et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 189:11277-11281, 1992,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Carriers suitable for aerosol delivery are<br>
described above. Devices for delivery of aerosolized formulations include, but are not limited to,<br>
pressurized metered dose inhalers (MDI), dry powder inhalers (DPI), and metered solution devices<br>
(MSI), and include devices that are nebulizers and inhalers. Oral delivery can be performed by<br>
complexing a therapeutic composition of the present invention to a carrier capable of withstanding<br>
degradation by digestive enzymes in the gut of an animal. Examples of such carriers, include<br>
plastic capsules or tablets, such as those known in the art. Direct injection techniques are<br>
particularly useful for administering a recombinant nucleic acid molecule to a cell or tissue that is<br>
accessible by surgery, and particularly, on or near the surface of the body. Administration of a<br>
composition locally within the area of a target cell refers to injecting the composition centimeters<br>
and preferably, millimeters from the target cell or tissue.<br>
Various methods of administration and delivery vehicles disclosed herein have been shown<br>
to be effective for delivery of a nucleic acid molecule to a target cell or tissue, whereby the nucleic<br>
acid molecule transfected the cell and was expressed. In many studies, successful delivery and<br>
expression of a heterologous gene was achieved in preferred cell types and/or using preferred<br>
delivery vehicles and routes of administration of the present invention. For example, using<br>
liposome delivery, U.S. Patent No. 5,705,151, issued January 6,1998, to Dow et al. demonstrated<br>
the successful in vivo intravenous delivery of a nucleic acid molecule encoding a superantigen and<br>
a nucleic acid molecule encoding a cytokine in a cationic liposome delivery vehicle, whereby the<br>
encoded proteins were expressed in tissues of the animal, and particularly in pulmonary tissues. Liu<br>
et al., 1997demonstrated that intravenous delivery of cholesterol-containing cationic liposomes<br>
containing genes preferentially targets pulmonary tissues and effectively mediates transfer and<br>
expression of the genes in vivo. Delivery of numerous nucleic acid sequences has been<br>
accomplished by administration of viral vectors encoding the nucleic acid sequences.<br>
A preferred single dose of an agent, including proteins, small molecules and antibodies, for<br>
use in any method described herein, comprises between about 0.01 microgram x kilogram"1 and<br>
about 10 milligram x kilogram"1 body weight of an animal. A more preferred single dose of an agent<br>
comprises between about 1 microgram x kilogram"1 and about 10 milligram x kilogram"1 body<br>
weight of an animal. An even more preferred single dose of an agent comprises between about 5<br>
microgram x kilogram"1 and about 7 milligram x kilogram'1 body weight of an animal. An even<br>
more preferred single dose of an agent comprises between about 10 microgram x kilogram"1 and<br>
about 5 milligram x kilogram'1 body weight of an animal. A particularly preferred single dose of<br>
an agent comprises between about 0.1 milligram x kilogram"1 and about 5 milligram x kilogram"1<br>
body weight of an animal, if the an agent is delivered by aerosol. Another particularly preferred<br>
single dose of an agent comprises between about 0.1 microgram x kilogram"1 and about 10<br>
microgram x kilogram"1 body weight of an animal, if the agent is delivered parenterally.<br>
In one embodiment, an appropriate single dose of a nucleic acid:liposome complex of the<br>
present invention is from about 0.1 \ig to about 100 ng per kg body weight of the patient to which<br>
the complex is being administered. In another embodiment, an appropriate single dose is from<br>
about 1 [ig to about 10 \ig per kg body weight. In another embodiment, an appropriate single dose<br>
of nucleic acidrlipid complex is at least about 0.1 \ig of nucleic acid, more preferably at least about<br>
1 g of nucleic acid, even more preferably at least about 10 \ig of nucleic acid, even more preferably<br>
at least about 50 jig of nucleic acid, and even more preferably at least about 100 |j,g of nucleic acid.<br>
In one embodiment a suitable dose of an agent of the present invention for use in any method<br>
described herein is a dose effective to inhibit the expression or activity of at least one protein in the<br>
alternative complement pathway as described herein (e.g., factor B, factor D or properdin), as<br>
compared to in the absence of the administration of the agent. Methods of measuring the expression<br>
or biological activity of a protein have been described above. In another embodiment, a suitable<br>
dose of an agent of the present invention is a dose that measurably inhibits the alternative<br>
complement pathway of the invention. Activation of complement and inhibition thereof can be<br>
measured using techniques/assays that are well-known in the art. For example, one can perform an<br>
in vitro analysis of C3 deposition on zymosan A particles as described in the examples. One can<br>
also test the ability of the agent to inhibit lysis of unsensitized erythrocytes by human serum.<br>
Extrapolation of in vitro results to in vivo dosages based on these assays is within the ability of those<br>
of skill in the art.<br>
In humans, it known in the art that, using conventional methods for aerosol delivery, only<br>
about 10% of the delivered solution typically enters the deep airways, even using an inhaler. If the<br>
aerosolized delivery is by direct inhalation, one may assume a dosage of about 10% of that<br>
administered by nebulization methods. Finally, one of skill in the art will readily be capable of<br>
converting a mouse dosage to a human dosage using alometric scaling. Essentially, a scale of<br>
dosage from mouse to human is based on the clearance ratio of a compound and the body surface<br>
of the mouse. The conversion for mg/kg is 1/12th of the "no observed adverse event level" (NOEL)<br>
to obtain the concentration for human dosage. This calculation assumes that the elimination<br>
between mouse and human is the same, which is believed to be the case for antibodies.<br>
Accordingly, a preferred single dose of an antibody comprises between about 1 ng x<br>
kilogram"1 and about less than 1 mg x kilogram"1 body weight of an animal. A more preferred single<br>
dose of an antibody comprises between about 20 ng x kilogram"1 and about 600 ng x kilogram"1<br>
body weight of the animal. An even more preferred single dose of an antibody, particularly when<br>
the antibody formulation is delivered by nebulization, comprises between about 20 ng x kilogram"1<br>
and about 600 \ig x kilogram"1 body weight of the animal, and more preferably, between about 20<br>
ng x kilogram"1 and about 500 |ag x kilogram"1, and more preferably, between about 20 ng x<br>
kilogram"1 and about 400 [ig x kilogram"1, and more preferably, between about 20 ng x kilogram"1<br>
and about 300 ng x kilogram"1, and more preferably, between about 20 ng x kilogram"1 and about<br>
200 ng x kilogram"1, and more preferably, between about 20 ng x kilogram"1 and about 100 ng *<br>
kilogram"1, and more preferably, between about 20 ng x kilogram"1 and about 50 |ig x kilogram'1<br>
body weight of the animal.<br>
Another preferred single dose of an antibody, particularly when the antibody formulation<br>
is delivered by nebulization, comprises between about 200 ng x kilogram"1 and about 600 ng x<br>
kilogram"1 body weight of the animal, and more preferably, between about 200 ng x kilogram"1 and<br>
about 500 ng x kilogram"1, and more preferably, between about 200 ng x kilogram"1 and about 400<br>
ng x kilogram"1, and more preferably, between about 200 ng x kilogram"1 and about 300 ng x<br>
kilogram'1, and more preferably, between about 200 ng x kilogram"1 and about 200 ng x kilogram"1,<br>
and more preferably, between about 200 ng x kilogram'1 and about 100 ng * kilogram"1, and more<br>
preferably, between about 200 ng x kilogram"1 and about 50 \ig x kilogram"1 body weight of the<br>
animal.<br>
Another preferred single dose of an antibody, particularly when the antibody formulation<br>
is delivered by direct inhalation from an inhaler, comprises between about 2 ng x kilogram'1 and<br>
about 100 ng x kilogram"1 body weight of the animal, and more preferably, between about 2 ng x<br>
kilogram"1 and about 50 (ig x kilogram"1, and more preferably, between about 2 ng x kilogram"1 and<br>
about 10 ng x kilogram"1, and more preferably, between about 2 ng x kilogram'1 and about 5 |ig x<br>
kilogram"1, and more preferably, between about 2 ng x kilogram"1 and about 1 ng x kilogram"1, and<br>
more preferably, between about 2 ng x kilogram"1 and about 0.5 ng x kilogram"', and more<br>
preferably, between about 2 ng x kilogram"1 and about 0.25 ng x kilogram"1, and more preferably,<br>
between about 2 ng x kilogram"1 and about 0.1 (ag x kilogram"1 body weight of the animal.<br>
In another embodiment, the antibody is administered at a dose of less than about 500 ng<br>
antibody per milliliter of formulation, and preferably, less than about 250 ng antibody per milliliter<br>
of formulation, and more preferably, less than about 100 ng antibody per milliliter of formulation,<br>
and more preferably, less than about 50 ng antibody per milliliter of formulation, and more<br>
preferably, less than about 40 \ig antibody per milliliter of formulation, and more preferably, less<br>
than about 30 ng antibody per milliliter of formulation, and more preferably, less than about 20 ng<br>
antibody per milliliter of formulation, and more preferably, less than about 10 fig antibody per<br>
milliliter of formulation, and even more preferably, between about 5 ng antibody and about 10 ng<br>
antibody per milliliter of formulation.<br>
With more particular regard to the method of reducing or preventing airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness and/or airway inflammation or a condition or disease related thereto, a suitable<br>
single dose of an inhibitory agent to administer to an animal is a dose that is capable of reducing or<br>
preventing airway hyperresponsiveness and/or airway inflammation, or reducing at least one other<br>
symptom of a disease to be treated (e.g., asthma), in an animal when administered one or more times<br>
over a suitable time period. When the patient has or is at risk of developing AHR, a suitable single<br>
dose of an agent comprises a dose that improves AHR by a doubling dose of a provoking agent or<br>
improves the static respiratory function of an animal.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, an effective amount of an agent that<br>
inhibits AHR to administer to an animal comprises an amount that is capable of reducing airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness (AHR) or airway inflammation without being toxic to the animal. An amount<br>
that is toxic to an animal comprises any amount that causes damage to the structure or function of<br>
an animal (i.e., poisonous).<br>
In one embodiment, the effectiveness of an AHR inhibiting agent to protect an animal from<br>
AHR in an animal having or at risk of developing AHR can be measured in doubling amounts. For<br>
example, the ability of an animal to be protected from AHR (i.e., experience a reduction in or a<br>
prevention of) by administration of a given agent is significant if the animal's 'PC20mcaacMlnJEEy} is<br>
at 1 rag/ml before administration of the agent and is at 2 mg/ml of Mch after administration of the<br>
agent. Similarly, an agent is considered effective if the animal's PC20mcthacholineFEV1 is at 2 mg/ml<br>
before administration of the agent and is at 4 mg/ml of Mch after administration of the agent. A<br>
preferred effective amount of an agent comprises an amount that is capable of increasing the<br>
PC20tnethacholineFEVi of an animal treated with the agent by about one doubling concentration towards<br>
the PC20meth)lcholjneFEV| of a normal animal. As discussed above, a normal animal refers to an animal<br>
known not to suffer from or be susceptible to abnormal AHR. A test animal refers to an animal<br>
suspected of suffering from or being susceptible to abnormal AHR.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, in an animal that has AHR, an effective amount<br>
of an agent to administer to an animal is an amount that measurably reduces AHR in the animal as<br>
compared to prior to administration of the agent. In another embodiment, an effective amount of<br>
an agent to administer to an animal is an amount that measurably reduces AHR in the animal as<br>
compared to a level of airway AHR in a population of animals with inflammation that is associated<br>
with AHR wherein the agent was not administered. The agent is preferably capable of reducing<br>
* AHR in an animal, even when the agent is administered after the onset of the physical symptoms<br>
of AHR (i.e., after acute onset AHR). Most preferably, an effective amount of the agent is an<br>
amount that reduces the symptoms of AHR to the point where AHR is no longer detected in the<br>
patient. In another embodiment, an effective amount of the agent is an amount that prevents, or<br>
substantially inhibits the onset of AHR when the agent is administered prior to exposure of the<br>
patient to an AHR provoking stimulus, such as an allergen, in a manner sufficient to induce AHR<br>
in the absence of the agent.<br>
In another embodiment, an effective amount of an agent according to the method of the<br>
present invention, comprises an amount that results in an improvement in an animal's<br>
PC20mcthacholineFEV, value such that the PC20mcth3Cb0|ineFEV, value obtained before administration of<br>
the agent when the animal is provoked with a first concentration of methacholine is the same as the<br>
PC20methacbo,ineFEV1 value obtained after administration of the agent when the animal is provoked with<br>
double the amount of the first concentration of methacholine. A preferred amount of an agent<br>
comprises an amount that results in an improvement in an animal's PC20methacholineFEVI value such<br>
that the PC20methacb0|ineFEV, value obtained before administration of the agent is between about 0.01<br>
mg/ml to about 8 mg/ml of methacholine is the same as the PC20mcthacholineFEV1 value obtained after<br>
administration of the agent is between about 0.02 mg/ml to about 16 mg/ml of methacholine.<br>
As previously described herein, the effectiveness of an agent to protect an animal having or<br>
susceptible to AHR can be determined by measuring the percent improvement in FEV, and/or the<br>
FEV,/FVC ratio before and after administration of the agent. In one embodiment, an effective<br>
amount of an agent comprises an amount that is capable of reducing the airflow limitation of an<br>
animal such that the FEV,/FVC value of the animal is at least about 80%. In another embodiment,<br>
an effective amount of an agent comprises an amount that is capable of reducing the airflow<br>
limitation of an animal such that the FEV,/FVC value of the animal is improved by at least about<br>
5%, or at least about lOOcc or PGFRG lOL/min. In another embodiment, an effective amount of<br>
an agent comprises an amount that improves an animal's FEV, by at least about 5%, and more<br>
preferably by between about 6% and about 100%, more preferably by between about 7% and about<br>
100%, and even more preferably by between about 8% and about 100% (or about 200 ml) of the<br>
animal's predicted FEV,. In another embodiment, an effective amount of an agent comprises an<br>
amount that improves an animal's FEV, by at least about 5%, and preferably, at least about 10%,<br>
and even more preferably, at least about 25%, and even more preferably, at least about 50%, and<br>
even more preferably, at least about 75%.<br>
One of skill in the art will be able to determine that the number of doses of an agent to be<br>
administered to an animal is dependent upon the extent of the airway hyperresponsiveness and the<br>
underlying condition of which AHR is a symptom, and the response of an individual patient to the<br>
treatment. In addition, the clinician will be able to determine the appropriate timing for delivery of<br>
the agent in a manner effective to reduce AHR in the animal. Preferably, the agent is delivered<br>
within 48 hours prior to exposure of the patient to an amount of an AHR provoking stimulus<br>
effective to induce AHR, and more preferably, within 36 hours, and more preferably within <br>
hours, and more preferably within 12 hours, and more preferably within 6 hours, 5 hours, 4 hours,<br>
3 hours, 2 hours, or 1 hour prior to exposure of the patient to an amount of AHR provoking stimulus<br>
effective to induce AHR. In one embodiment, the agent is administered as soon as it is recognized<br>
(i.e., immediately) by the patient or clinician that the patient has been exposed or is about to be<br>
exposed to an AHR provoking stimulus, and especially an AHR provoking stimulus to which the<br>
patient is sensitized (i.e., an allergen). In another embodiment, the agent is administered upon the<br>
first sign of development of AHR (i.e., acute onset AHR), and preferably, within at least 2 hours of<br>
the development of symptoms of AHR, and more preferably, within at least 1 hour, and more<br>
preferably within at least 30 minutes, and more preferably within at least 10 minutes, and more<br>
preferably within at least 5 minutes of development of symptoms of AHR. Symptoms of AHR and<br>
methods for measuring or detecting such symptoms have been described in detail above. Preferably,<br>
such administrations are given until signs of reduction of AHR appear, and then as needed until the<br>
symptoms of AHR are gone.<br>
With particular regard to the method of inhibiting or preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury,<br>
an effective amount of an agent, and particularly a factor B antibody or antigen binding fragment<br>
thereof (or antigen binding polypeptide) to administer to an animal is an amount that measurably<br>
inhibits histological damage, including oxidative damage or cell death, in the animal as compared<br>
to in the absence of administration of the agent. In the case of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury,<br>
an effective amount of an agent to administer to an animal is an amount that measurably inhibits<br>
increases hi serum urea nitrogen or measurably decrease histologic injury to the tissues of the kidney<br>
of the animal as compared to in the absence of administration of the agent. A suitable single dose<br>
of an inhibitory agent to administer to an animal is a dose that is capable of reducing or preventing<br>
at least one symptom, type of injury, or resulting damage, from ischemia-reperfusion injury in an<br>
animal when administered one or more times over a suitable time period. Suitable doses of<br>
antibodies, including for various routes of administration, are described in detail above. In one<br>
aspect, an effective amount of an agent that inhibits ischemia-reperfusion injury to administer to an<br>
animal comprises an amount that is capable of inhibiting at least one symptom or damage caused<br>
by ischemia-reperfusion injury without being toxic to the animal.<br>
Any of the methods of the present invention can be used in any animal, and particularly, in<br>
any animal of the Vertebrate class, Mammalia (i.e., mammals), including, without limitation,<br>
primates, rodents, livestock and domestic pets. Preferred mammals to treat using the method of the<br>
present invention are humans.<br>
The following examples are provided for the purposes of illustration and are not intended<br>
to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
The following example describes the production of a novel inhibitor of the alternative<br>
complement pathway.<br>
The present inventors have created several hybridomas that produce mouse monoclonal<br>
antibodies that bind mouse factor B. In this study, the inventors set out to characterize the ability<br>
of one of these antibodies to inhibit the alternative complement pathway. The inventors also tested<br>
this antibody in a model of antiphospholipid mediated fetal loss. As previously reported (Girardi),<br>
mice deficient in factor B were greatly protected from fetal loss in this model, and the inventors<br>
hypothesized that an exogenous inhibitor of the alternative pathway would be an effective<br>
therapeutic agent in this disease model.<br>
Methods<br>
Construction of a factor B-Igfusion protein and purification of mouse factor B. A plasmid<br>
encoding two of the short consensus repeats (SCR) of the factor B gene linked to the hinge, CH2,<br>
and CHS domains of a mouse IgGl isotype was constructed (Fig. 1). These SCR domains were<br>
chosen because they are part of the deleted segment of the factor B gene in the^S-/- mice used in<br>
these studies.<br>
Purification of mouse factor B. Complement factor B was purified from normal mouse<br>
serum by affinity purification. The affinity column was created by binding goat anti-human<br>
properdin factor B (Diasorin, Stillwater, MN) to CNBr-Activated Separose (Amersham, Arlington<br>
Heights, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. C57/B6J mice were bled by cardiac<br>
puncture, and the blood was collected into syringes containing 50 \i\ of 500 mM EDTA in order to<br>
prevent alternative pathway activation. The blood was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 minutes and<br>
the plasma was collected. The plasma was then diluted 1:1 with buffer (EACA 50 mM, EDTA 10<br>
mM, benzamidine 2 mM in PBS, pH 7.4) and passed through a 0.22 urn filter (GE Water<br>
Technologies). The plasma was added to the affinity column and the column was washed with 10<br>
column volumes of buffer. The factor B was eluted using 5 M LiCl2 and dialyzed overnight against<br>
PBS. The purity of the factor B was then checked by electrophoresis on a 10% Tris-Glycine gel and<br>
stained with Coomassie (data not shown).<br>
Development of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies targeting complement factor B. Targeted<br>
deletion of mouse factor B was accomplished as previously described (Matsumoto). The factor B<br>
deficient mice were created with Svl29 strain embryonic stem cells and were then crossed with<br>
C57BL/6 mice prior to expansion of the colony at Fl. Factor B deficient mice were immunized with<br>
125 jig of the recombinant factor B-Ig fusion protein emulsified with Freund' s incomplete adjuvant<br>
and then boosted four times at three week intervals. The mice were screened for the development<br>
of inhibitory antibodies to factor B by testing their sera in an enzyme linked immunosorbant assay<br>
(ELISA) using mouse factor B coated plates and an in vitro assay of alternative complement<br>
pathway inhibition (described below). One day after the last injection, spleen cells from a mouse<br>
identified as having a robust immune response towards factor B were fused to the myeloma cell line<br>
in the University of Colorado Monoclonal Antibody Center. Candidate hybridomas were cloned by<br>
limiting dilution, and clones capable of inhibiting alternative pathway activity were identified. One<br>
of the hybridomas, A1379, was used for these experiments. A1379 was purified from tissue culture<br>
supernatant with a Protein-G Sepharose column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). LPS was removed<br>
from the purified mAb using polymyxin (Sigma). The Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Assay<br>
(BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) was used according to the manufacturers instructions to<br>
verify that the mAb Ifcd LPS levels below 1 EU/mg of mAb. The purity of the mAb was then<br>
checked by electrophoresis on a 10% Tris-Glycine gel and stained with Coomassie.<br>
ELISA analysis of anti-factor B antibody levels.<br>
Mice were screened for an immune response to the immunizations by testing their sera in<br>
an enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) against purified factor B. Ninety-six well ELISA<br>
plates (Costar, Corning, NY) were coated with 125 ng of purified factor B in coating buffer (15 rnM<br>
Na^Oj, 35 mM NajHCOj) and stored overnight at 4Â° C. The plates were then washed with 200 \iof PBS. Non-specific binding was blocked by incubating the plates with 200 nl of 5% BSA (Sigma-<br>
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) hi PBS. The plates were washed two times with 200 \i\ of PBS with 0.1%<br>
Tween 20, then incubated with diluted serum for one hour. Samples were diluted 1:100 in PBS with<br>
0.1% Tween-20 and 0.1 % BSA, then the samples were further serially diluted 1:1 seven times. The<br>
plates were then washed two times and incubated with 50 (0.1 of peroxidase conjugated goat antimouse<br>
IgG (Cappel, Durham, NC). The plates were next washed four times and incubated with 100<br>
\i\ of ABTS containing 1:1000 30% H2O2 (Sigma), and absorbance at 405 nm was read with a<br>
microplate reader (Biorad, Richmond, CA).<br>
Assays of alternative complement pathway inhibition. Sera with detectable liters of antifactor<br>
B antibodies were then screened for the ability to inhibit the alternative pathway. This was<br>
performed using an in vitro analysis of C3 deposition on zymosan A particles (Sigma) (Quigg). Fifty<br>
mg of zymosan particles in 10 ml of 0.15 M NaCl were boiled for 60 minutes, then washed twice<br>
in PBS. Sera was assayed by mixing IxlO7 zymosan particles in a reaction mix with a final<br>
concentration of 10 mM EGTA and 5 mM MgCl2. Ten microliters of sera from unmanipulated<br>
C57/B6 mice were added as a source of complement were added. Assays of inhibition were<br>
conducted with up to 70 |il of sera from immunized mice (to screen for the generation of inhibitory<br>
antibodies) or with purified antibody titrated from 0.0625 |ig to 8 [ag per reaction. Samples were<br>
brought up to 100 \i\ final volume with PBS and were incubated at 37Â° C for 30 minutes. The<br>
zymosan particles were washed twice with cold PBS, 1% fetal bovine serum, and were then<br>
incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse C3 (Cappel, Durham, NC) for one hour on ice.<br>
The samples were again washed twice, were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, 1% fetal bovine serum,<br>
and were then analyzed by flow cytometry. Percent inhibition was calculated using the formula:<br>
100 x [1- (sample mean channel fluorescence - background (no serum')]<br>
(positive control mean channel fluorescence - background)<br>
Fab fragments of the 1379 clone were also tested for the ability to inhibit the alternative<br>
pathway using the zymosan assay. Fab fragments were generated by incubating purified antibody<br>
with papain-agarose (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Fc fragments and undigested IgG were then removed by applying the digested antibody to a protein<br>
G column. The Fab fragments were collected in the flow through, and the Fc fragments and<br>
undigested IgG were subsequently eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.8. One \ig of the Fab was<br>
used in the zymosan reaction. The polyclonal anti-mouse C3 antibody used in this assay was found<br>
to have cross reactivity with multiple species. This assay was therefore used to test inhibition by the<br>
1379 clone of the alternative pathway in those species. Titration of the inhibitory antibody was<br>
conducted as described above.<br>
As another assay of the ability of the 1379 clone to inhibit the alternative complement<br>
pathway, the inventors tested the ability of this antibody to inhibit lysis of unsensitized rabbit<br>
erythrocytes by human serum. Whole rabbit blood was mixed 1 : 1 with a buffer solution composed<br>
of 20.5 g dextrose, 8.0 g sodium citrate (dihydrate), 4.0 g NaCl, 0.55 g citric acid in one liter of<br>
distilled water. Five ml of the erythrocyte solution was then mixed 1:9 with a solution of 1.1%<br>
NaCl, 0.0025% Na-5,5 diethyl barbiturate, pH 7.35, 8 mM EOT A, 2 mM MgCl2. The mixture was<br>
incubated at 37Â° C for several minutes then centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 minutes at 4Â° C. The<br>
erythrocytes were washed three more times before being resuspended in 40 ml of the same solution.<br>
Fifty |il of the above suspension was added to human serum (5 to 1 00 (0,1) buffer solution was added<br>
to bring the final volume up to 1 50 \il. Erythrocytes in buffer without serum were used as a negative<br>
control, and erythrocytes added to 1 00 [J.1 of distilled water were used as positive controls (complete<br>
lysis). Samples were incubated at 37Â° C for 30 minutes with occasional shaking to keep the cells<br>
in suspension. The reactions were stopped by adding 1 .5 ml of cold PBS and the samples were spun<br>
at 1000 x g for five minutes. The optical density of each supernatant was read at 415 nm using a<br>
spectrophotometer (Biorad). Ten \il of serum were found to cause complete lysis of the erythrocytes.<br>
The same reaction was then carried out using 10 [il of the serum and increasing concentrations of<br>
the 1 379 clone ( 1 fig to 1 2 |ig per reaction). Percent inhibition of alternative pathway activity was<br>
determined using the formula:<br>
In Vivo pharmacokinetics of the 1379 clone. Mice were pre-bled, and then were injected<br>
intraperitoneally (IP) or intravenously (TV) with one or two mg doses of the 1 379 clone of antibody.<br>
These doses were chosen because it was estimated that they would be equimolar with factor B.<br>
Factor B is present in the serum at approximately ~200 fig/ml (or -2.2 [iM given that factor B is a<br>
90 kD protein). Because the 1379 antibody is 150 kD and the intravascular volume of an adult<br>
52.<br>
mouse is approximately 3 ml, a one mg injection (6.7 fiMol) should result in a circulating<br>
concentration of-2.2 uM Because the antibody is divalent, it was anticipated that this equimolar<br>
injection would be more than sufficient to result in complete inhibition of the alternative pathway.<br>
The mice were bled 1,2,6,24,48, and 96 hours after the injection of the inhibitor. Sera from these<br>
time points were then used in the zymosan assay to assess the activity of the alternative pathway.<br>
Results<br>
Generation of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies to the Ba portion of factor B. Monoclonal<br>
antibodies to mouse factor B were generated as described in the methods section. Serum from<br>
immunized mice were assayed for the presence of anti-factor B antibodies (data not shown). One<br>
clone, designated 1379, was chosen for further characterization due to the fact that the hybridoma<br>
was found to be rapidly growing, the antibody is of the IgG, subclass (non-complement activating),<br>
and its supernatant was found to be a potent inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway. After<br>
purification of the antibody (data not shown), the antibody was tested in two in vitro assays of<br>
alternative pathway activity (Figs. 2A and 2B). Using the zymosan assay the inhibitor was found<br>
to completely inhibit the alternative pathway when three p,g were added to a reaction containing 10<br>
|J.l of serum. The anti-factor B and the factor B are approximately equimolar at this concentration<br>
(Assuming that factor B is present at 200 u-g/ml and has a molecular weight of 90,000 kD, there are<br>
0.022 nMol in 10 u-1 of serum, and 3 |ig of antibody with a molecular weight of 150,000 kD equals<br>
approximately 0.02 nMol). In the rabbit erythrocyte lysis assay, full inhibition was achieved with<br>
6 |J.g of antibody per 10 (J.1 of human serum in the reaction. Inhibition of the alternative pathway was<br>
next tested using Fab fragments made from the 1379 clone. When a molar excess of Fab from the<br>
1379 clone was used, complete inhibition of alternative pathway activity was seen by this assay.<br>
The ability of 1379 to inhibit alternative pathway activity in sera from multiple different<br>
mammalian species was next tested in the zymosan assay. The 1379 antibody was able to fully<br>
inhibit alternative pathway activation in most of the species tested (Table 1). The antibody fully<br>
inhibited alternative pathway activity in serum from mice, rats, humans, and several species of<br>
monkeys. However, it did not demonstrate any inhibitory activity towards serum from dogs or<br>
guinea pigs.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Pharmacokinetics of the 1379 antibody. Mice were tested for inhibition of the alternative<br>
pathway at various times after a single injection of the inhibitory antibody. One mg of antibody led<br>
to full inhibition within one hour when injected IV and within two hours when injected IP (Fig. 3).<br>
Mice receiving a one rag injection IP retained full inhibition of the alternative pathway at 24 hours<br>
and those receiving a two mg injection retained full inhibition up to 48 hours after the injection.<br>
The inventors have also injected 2 mg of the 1379 antibody repetitively i.p. every other day for 14<br>
days and have shown that the complete inhibition of the alternative complement pathway was<br>
maintained for at least 48 hours after the last injection (data not shown). These data strongly<br>
suggest that this mouse mAb is not recognized as "foreign" and supports its chronic usage in vivo.<br>
Finally, experiments using F(ab) fragments of the antibody has shown that inhibition of the<br>
alternative pathway is achieved in approximately equimolar levels as with the intact 1379 antibody<br>
(data not shown).<br>
1379 binds an epitope in the SCR3 region ofBa. The ability of the 1379 antibody to bind<br>
to a panel of factor B mutants was performed as previously described (Hourcade, 1995, J. Biol.<br>
Chem.*) in order to characterize the mAb binding site. Experiments have shown that the introduction<br>
of certain alanine substitutions into SCRs 2 and 3 of human factor B, but not SCR1, results in the<br>
loss of binding of the 1379 antibody to factor B. From the 25 different mutants tested, 1379 had<br>
virtually no binding to the B17 and B23 mutants and retained less than 20% of its binding capability<br>
to the B18 mutant. These are all SCR3 mutations. More specifically, mutant B17 substitutes 139-<br>
Tyr-140-Cys-141-Ser with His-Cys-Pro, the positions being relevant to the mature human factor B<br>
represented by SEQ ID N0:2; mutant B23 substitutes 182-Glu-l 83-Gly-184-Gly-l 85-Ser withGly-<br>
Asn-Gly-Val, the positions also relevant to the mature human factor B represented by SEQ HD<br>
N0:2. Therefore, the 1379 antibody binds to the third SCR domain of factor B.<br>
Conclusions<br>
The present inventors have generated a novel monoclonal antibody to mouse factor B<br>
identified as clone 1379. This antibody is a specific inhibitor of the alternative pathway of<br>
complement and leads to complete inhibition of this pathway in vitro and in vivo. A single 1 mg i.p.<br>
injection led to complete inhibition of the alternative pathway for up to 48 hours, and multiple<br>
injections resulted in prolonged inhibition of this pathway.<br>
Using in vitro assays, 1379 was demonstrated to fully inhibit alternative pathway activity<br>
in serum from multiple species including mice, rats, monkeys and humans. Using assays of the<br>
binding affinity for the antibody to a panel of factor B mutants, the antigenic site was determined<br>
to be in the SCR3 domain of factor B, part of the region deleted in the^B-/- mice. This region of the<br>
factor B protein is adjacent to the factor D cleavage site. The ability of the Fab fragment of 1379<br>
to inhibit alternative pathway activity suggests that the it is not merely steric hindrance by 1379 that<br>
prevents cleavage but that the specific binding site is a critical location in factor D mediated<br>
cleavage of the protein. The efficacy of 1379 against the serum from so many different species<br>
suggests that this site is highly conserved among higher mammals.<br>
Several other soluble complement inhibitors have already been developed and characterized<br>
(Quigg; Weisman; Heller; Granger; Pratt), but the inhibitor described herein is believed to be the<br>
first that selectively inhibits the alternative pathway in a broad range of animal species. By<br>
selectively inhibiting the alternative pathway, 1379 may have several advantages compared to<br>
inhibitors that work at the level of the C3 convertase. By leaving the classical pathway intact, this<br>
inhibitor may have fewer immunosuppressive affects. Furthermore, blockade of the classical<br>
pathway may actually induce autoimmunity. Selective blockade of the alternative pathway has<br>
ameliorated a mouse model of lupus nephritis (Watanabe), whereas C3 deficiency did not. The<br>
alternative pathway has been specifically implicated in a number of disease models (Thurman;<br>
Watanabe; Girardi), highlighting the therapeutic potential of a specific alternative pathway inhibitor.<br>

Example 2<br>
The following example demonstrates that complement activation through the alternative<br>
pathway is critical for development of airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation, and further<br>
demonstrates that inhibition of the alternative pathway for complement activation inhibits airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness.<br>
Given the effectiveness of inhibition of complement activation before allergen exposure, the<br>
present inventors further determined the pathway of complement activation, hi the present study the<br>
inventors report that activation of the complement cascade through the alternative pathway is<br>
critical for the development of airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation.<br>
Methods<br>
Animals<br>
Female C57BL/6 mice, 8 to 12 weeks of age, were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar<br>
Harbor, ME). As previously described, factor B heterozygote deficient mice (JS +/-) were<br>
intercrossed at Fl following an initial cross to C57BL/6 strain and then intercrossed to generate an<br>
fB -I- strain. These mice were then backcrossed for 7 generations with C57BL/6 mice. As control<br>
mice, congenicyB +/+ littermates were used. C4 deficient mice ((C4 -/-) backcrossed for 17<br>
generations with C57BL/6 mice) were maintained in the animal facility. All experimental animals<br>
used hi this study were maintained on ovalbumin (OVA)-free diets and were under a protocol<br>
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Jewish Medical and<br>
Research Center.<br>
Experimental protocol<br>
Mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of 20 |o,g of OVA (Grade V; Sigma<br>
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) or ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Greer Laboratories, Lenoir, NC)<br>
suspended in 2.25 mg aluminum hydroxide (Alum Imuject; Pierce, Rockford, EL) on days 1 and 14<br>
and then challenged via the airways, using nebulized OVA or ragweed (1% in PBS), with an<br>
ultrasonic nebulizer (DeVilbiss Health Care, Somerset, PA) for 20 minutes daily on days 27,28, and<br>
29.<br>
For reconstitution of fB either 10 (4,g, 1 |ag or 0.1 |ig of purified fB (50 |J,L in PBS) was<br>
administered by intranasal application 1 hour before each airway challenge to non-sensitized and<br>
sensitized fB -/- mice. As a control PBS was administered.<br>
In a different study 2 hours before each OVA challenge an antibody against ffi (anti-fB) was<br>
administered to sensitized mice either by i.p. injection (2mg/treatment/mouse) or by nebulization.<br>
For nebulization, 4 mice were placed hi a plexiglass box, and 0.5 mg of anti-fB (in 5 ml PBS) was<br>
nebulized using an ultrasonic nebulizer (DeVilbiss Health Care). As a control, rat IgG at the same<br>
dose and volume was injected i.p. or nebulized at the same time points. On day 31, AHR was<br>
assessed and animals were sacrificed the same day for the collection of BAL fluid, blood and lung<br>
tissue.<br>
Purification of factor B<br>
To reconstitute alternative pathway activity in B-/- mice, mouse complement factor B was<br>
purified from normal mouse serum by affinity purification. The affinity column was created by<br>
binding goat anti-human properdin factor B (Diasorin, Stillwater, MN) to CNBr-Activated Separose<br>
(Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. C57/B6J mice<br>
were bled by cardiac puncture, and the blood was collected into syringes containing 50 fil of 500<br>
mM EDTA hi order to prevent alternative pathway activation. The blood was centrifuged at 2000<br>
rpm for 15 minutes and the plasma was collected. The plasma was then diluted 1:1 with buffer<br>
(EACA 50 mM, EDTA 10 mM, benzamidine 2 mM in PBS, pH 7.4) and passed through a 0.22 (im<br>
filter (GE Water Technologies). The plasma was added to the affinity column and the column was<br>
washed with 10 column volumes of buffer. The factor B was eluted using 5 M LiCl2 and dialyzed<br>
overnight against PBS. The purity of the factor B was then checked by electrophoresis on a 10%<br>
Tris-Glycine gel and stained with Coomassie. The concentration of LPS was determined by<br>
Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Assay (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) and found to be below<br>
1 EU/mg of purified factor B.<br>
Generation of anti-factor B antibody<br>
Anti-mouse factor B monoclonal antibodies were produced as described hi Example 1.<br>
Briefly, factor B deficient mice were immunized with a recombinant fusion protein created from<br>
the second and third short consensus repeat (SCR) domains from the factor B gene and an<br>
immunoglobulin. The SCR domains were chosen because they are part of the deleted segment of<br>
the factor B gene in the^B-/- mice._/B-/- mice were then immunized with this protein and then<br>
boosted four times at three week intervals. One day after the last injection, spleen cells were fused<br>
with myeloma cells at the University of Colorado Monoclonal Antibody Center. Anti-factor B<br>
monoclonal antibody (mAb) secreting clones were then identified and characterized. One of the<br>
hybridomas, A1379, was used for these experiments. A1379 was purified from tissue culture<br>
supernatant with a Protein-G Sepharose column (Pharacia, Uppsala, Sweden). LPS was removed<br>
from the purified mAb using polymyxin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The Limulus Amebocyte<br>
Lysate Assay (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) was used according to the manufacturers<br>
intstructions to verify that the mAb had LPS levels below 1 EU/mg of mAb. The purity of the mAb<br>
was then checked by electrophoresis on a 10% Tris-Glycine gel and stained with Coomassie.<br>
Determination of airway function<br>
Airway responsiveness was assessed as a change in airway function after challenge with<br>
aerosolized methacholine (MCh) administered for 10 sec (60 breaths/min, 500 \il tidal volume) in<br>
increasing concentrations (6.25,12.5,25,50 and 100 mg/ml). Anesthetized (pentobarbital sodium,<br>
i.p., 70 to 90 mg/kg), tracheostomized (18G cannula) mice were mechanically ventilated (160<br>
breaths per min, tidal volume of 150 \i\, positive end-expiratory pressure of 2-4 cm H20) and lung<br>
function was assessed (Takeda, 1997). Airway resistance (RL) was continuously computed<br>
(Labview, National Instruments, TX) by fitting flow, volume, and pressure to an equation of motion.<br>
Maximum values of RL were taken and expressed as a percentage change from baseline following<br>
PBS aerosol. There were no significant differences in baseline RL values between the respective<br>
deficient or control mice.<br>
Bronchoalveolar lavage and Measurement ofcytokines<br>
After assessment of airway function, lungs were lavaged via the tracheal tube with Hank's<br>
balanced salt solution (1x1 ml, 37Â°C). Number of BAL cells were obtained using a cell counter<br>
(Coulter Counter; Coulter Co., Hialeah, FL). Differential cell counts were, made from<br>
cytocentrifuged preparations and the percentage and absolute numbers of each cell type were<br>
calculated. Cytokine levels were assessed by ELISA in BAL fluid (Tompkinson). EFN-y, IL-4. TL-5,<br>
IL-10, EL-12 (all PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and EL-13 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)<br>
ELISAs were performed according to the manufacturers' directions.<br>
Levels of C3a desArg in BAL fluid were measured by ELISA in non-sensitized and<br>
sensitized mice. 24 hrs following the first or second allergen challenge, and at 24 and 48 hrs<br>
following the third and final challenge following the manufacturers' directions (Cedarlane<br>
Laboratories, Hornby, Ontario, Canada).<br>
Histologic and immunohistochemistry studies<br>
After obtaining BAL fluid, lungs were inflated through the trachea with 2 mL of 10%<br>
formalin and then fixed in the same solution by immersion. Tissue sections were stained with<br>
hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and immunohistochemically for cells containing<br>
eosinophilic major basic protein (MBP), using a rabbit anti-mouse MBP antibody (provided by J.J.<br>
Lee, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ). Slides were examined in a blinded fashion and numbers of<br>
eosinophils in the peribronchial tissue and goblet cells were analyzed separately using NIH Scion<br>
Image software (version 1.62, developed at the U.S. National Institute of Health and available on<br>
the Internet).<br>
Measurement of total IgE and OVA-spedfic antibodies<br>
Serum levels of total IgE, and OVA-specific IgE and IgGl were measured by ELISA as<br>
previously described (Tompkinson). The OVA-specific antibody titers of samples were related to<br>
internal pooled standards, which were arbitrarily assigned to be 500 ELISA units (EU). The total<br>
IgE level was calculated by comparison with a known mouse IgE standard (55 3481, PharMingen).<br>
Statistical analysis<br>
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the level of difference between all<br>
groups. Comparisons for all pairs was performed by the Tukey-Kramer honestly significant<br>
difference (HSD). Probability (p) values for significance were set at 0.05. Values for all<br>
measurements are expressed as the meanÂ±standard error of mean (SEM).<br>
Results<br>
Complement activation through the alternative pathway is critical for the development ofAHR<br>
following allergen challenge of sensitized mice<br>
To assess the role of the alternative pathway in the development of AHR and airway<br>
inflammation OVA-sensitized and non-sensitized fB â¢/- mice and matched control mice (fB +/+)<br>
were challenged with an aerosol of 1 % OVA for 3 consecutive days. Sensitized and challenged/!?<br>
+/+ mice showed increased responsiveness to MCh compared to challenged only/2? +/+ mice (Fig.<br>
4). In contrast, sensitized and challenged,/!? -/- mice demonstrated a significantly (pO.Ol) lower<br>
response to MCh throughout the dose-response curve compared to the sensitized and challenged/!?<br>
+/+ mice, and thus demonstrate a marked inability to develop AHR following sensitization and<br>
challenge.<br>
Complement activation through the alternative pathway is critical for the development airway<br>
inflammation following allergen challenge of sensitized mice<br>
Airway inflammation is a characteristic feature of allergic airway disease. To assess airway<br>
inflammation BAL fluid and lung tissue was obtained 48 hrs following the last airway challenge.<br>
Sensitized and challenged fB +/+ mice showed an increase in total cell count and especially<br>
eosinophil numbers in BAL fluid compared to challenged only mice, which had no eosinophils in<br>
their BAL fluid (Fig. 5). Sensitized and challenged/!? -/- mice showed significantly lower total cell<br>
count as well as numbers of eosinophils (pO.Ol) in BAL fluid compared to sensitized and<br>
challenged/!? +/+ but still significantly (p
Similarly,/?? -/- mice showed also lower eosinophil numbers in BAL fluid following sensitization<br>
and challenge with ragweed compared to ragweed sensitized and challenged controls (Fig. 5).<br>
Allergen sensitization and airway challenge leads to an increase in peribronchial<br>
inflammation and especially eosinophil infiltration compared to challenged alone (Fig. 3). However,<br>
sensitized and challenged/?? -/- mice showed markedly reduced peribronchial inflammation <br>
2) compared to sensitized and challenged control mice. To quantitate eosinophil infiltration in the<br>
lung, tissue section were stained with anti-major basic protein (data not shown). In challenged only<br>
mice only few eosinophils were detected in the peri-bronchial tissue. Sensitization and subsequent<br>
allergen challenge of fB +/+ mice resulted in significantly increased peribronchial eosinophil<br>
numbers (Table 2). In contrast, sensitized and challenged fB -/- mice showed significantly<br>
peribronchial fewer eosinophil infiltration (Table 2).<br>
Another hallmark of allergic airway disease is goblet cell hyperplasia of the airway epithelial<br>
cells. Lungs were stained with periodic acid-Schiff to identify mucus-containing cells in the airway<br>
epithelium. In sensitized and challenge mice a large amount of cells staining positive for mucus<br>
were found (Table 2) in contrast to challenged only mice where no PAS positive cells were<br>
detectable (Table 2). Sensitized and challenged fB -/- showed significantly (p

Complement activation through the alternative pathway affects cytokine production in BAL fluid<br>
Th2 cytokine production by T cells plays a key role in the induction of allergic airway<br>
inflammation and AHR. To evaluate the cytokine response following allergen challenge,<br>
concentrations of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, EL-12, IL-13 and IFN-y were assessed in the BAL fluid, 48 h<br>
after the last OVA challenge. Sensitization and challenge of wild-type mice resulted in significant<br>
(p
IFN-y compared to challenged only controls (data not shown). TH2 cytokine levels (IL-4, IL-5 and<br>
EL-13) in the BAL fluid were decreased in the fB -/- mice (data not shown).<br>
fB deficiency does not affect serum levels of antigen specific antibodies<br>
Serum levels of total IgE and OVA-specific IgE and IgG 1 were measured 48 hours following<br>
the last airway challenge. Sensitized and challenge/?? +/+ mice showed increased levels of total IgE<br>
and OVA-specific IgE and IgGl compared to challenged only control mice (Table 3). Similarly,/??<br>
-/- mice showed increased levels of total IgE and OVA-specific IgE and IgGl, which were not<br>
statistically different from sensitized and challenged fB +/+ mice, indicating that the humoral<br>
response to allergen sensitization and challenge remains intact in these mice.<br>

Mice were sensitized and challenged as described in Methods. Number of goblet cells (PAS-positive cells) and peribronchial eosinophils (anti-major basic protein<br>

Activation of the classical pathway in this model is not essential to the development of allergic<br>
airway disease<br>
To further define the complement pathway critical to the development of allergic responses<br>
in the lungs of sensitized and challenged mice, the inventors used mice deficient in complement<br>
component 4 (C4 -/-), which is essential to the activation of the classical and lectin pathways, in<br>
comparison to the^B -/- mice.<br>
To assess activation of the complement pathway, levels of C3a desArg were assessed in<br>
BAL fluid. Challenged only mice showed low levels of C3a desArg (data not shown). In contrast,<br>
sensitized mice showed increased levels of C3a desArg in BAL fluid after the first, second and third<br>
challenge, with the highest values at 48 hrs following the last challenge (data not shown).<br>
Interestingly, sensitized and challenged C4 -I- mice showed similar levels of C3a compared to the<br>
sensitized and challenged wild-type mice, in contrast to sensitized and challenged_/5 -/- mice, which<br>
showed a decrease in C3a desArg levels compared to their respective sensitized and challenged<br>
wild-type mice (data not shown). These data suggest that following allergen exposure of sensitized<br>
mice, complement activation occurs through the alternative pathway.<br>
C4 -/- mice (developed similar levels of AHR as the sensitized and challenged C4+/+ mice<br>
(Fig. 9). Similarly, C4 -I- mice showed no decrease in total cell counts (meanÂ±SEM, n=10; 163Â±35<br>
xlO3 cells), or lymphocyte (28Â±9 xlO3 cells) and eosinophil (98Â±23 xlO3 cells) numbers in<br>
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid compared to the sensitized and challenged control mice (n=10;<br>
175Â±53; 35Â±12; 115Â±32 xlO3 cells, respectively) (data not shown). Further sensitized and<br>
challenged C4 -/- mice showed similar increases in peribronchial eosinophil numbers and numbers<br>
of goblet cells compared to the sensitized and challenged respective WT mice (Table 2). These<br>
findings suggest that activation of the classical pathway in this model is not essential to the<br>
development of allergic airway disease.<br>
Lack of development on AHR and airway inflammation infB deficient mice is not specific for OVA<br>
To assess if the lack of airway hyperresponsiveness following allergen sensitization and<br>
challenge was due to a specific unresponsiveness to OVA,yB -/- and wild-type mice were sensitized<br>
and challenged with ragweed. Ragweed sensitized and challenged./?? -/- mice showed a decrease in<br>
responsiveness to MCh, whereas fB +/+ developed a strong response to MCh (Figs. 6A and 6B).<br>
Similarly, airway inflammation in BAL fluid was reduced in ragweed sensitized and challenged^/B<br>
-/- mice compared lofB +/+ (Fig. 6C).<br>
Administration of factor B reconstitutes the ability to develop AHR and airway inflammation infB<br>
-/- mice<br>
To reconstitute factor B in the lung.^B -/- received a single intranasal application of either<br>
10 p.g, 1 jig, 0.1 \ig of purified factor B (Fig. 7) or a PBS before each airway challenge. Sensitized<br>
and challenged/Z? -/- mice treated with 0.1 \ig of factor B before each challenge showed a decreased<br>
response to MCh similar to sensitized and challenged/B -/- mice treated with PBS, but significantly<br>
lower compared to sensitized and challenged/2? +/+ mice (Fig. 7A). Sensitized and challenged mice<br>
treated with 1 |ig of purified factor B showed a slight but not statistically different increase in<br>
airway reactivity compared to sensitized and challenged ffi -/- mice either treated with PBS or 0.1<br>
\ig of purified factor B (Fig. 7A). In contrast, sensitized and challenged/S -/- mice treated with 10<br>
u,g of purified factor B before each airway challenge showed an increased response to MCh, similar<br>
to the sensitized and challenged fB +/+ mice.<br>
Also treatment of sensitized and challenged fB -/- mice with 10 (ig of purified factor B<br>
before each airway challenge increased airway inflammation and especially eosinophil numbers in<br>
B AL fluid similar to numbers observed in sensitized and challenged/?? +/+ mice, whereas treatment<br>
with either 0.1 |ag or 1 jag purified factor B failed to increase numbers of eosinophils in the BAL<br>
fluid (Fig. 7B). If factor B was given before each airway challenge but to non-sensitized recipients,<br>
AHR or airway inflammatory responses were not observed, indicating that the sensitization phase<br>
was needed for the responses to develop on challenge, as well as demonstrating that the sensitization<br>
phase in the^B-/- mice was intact. These data in the/B -/- mice directly demonstrate that factor B<br>
of the alternative pathway is critical to the development of allergic airway disease.<br>
Treatment with a fB neutralizing antibody inhibits the development of AHR in sensitized and<br>
challenged mice<br>
To assess the role of complement activation through the alternative pathway in sensitized<br>
and challenge non-gene-deficient mice, C57BL/6 were sensitized as described in Methods. The<br>
1379 anti-factor B antibody described in Example 1 was administered either systemically or locally<br>
by nebulization, which has been shown to be an effective route for administration of other<br>
complement inhibitors. Normal mice, treated after sensitization but during the challenge phase with<br>
either systemic or local (nebulized) anti-factor B, showed a significant decrease hi AHR (Figs. 8A<br>
and 8B), as well as an inhibition of airway inflammation and eosinophilia in the airways (Fig. 8C).<br>
Furthermore, tissue inflammation, peribronchial eosinophil numbers (Table 2) as well as the<br>
number of goblet cell (Table 2) were reduced in these anti-fB-treated mice. Additionally, levels of<br>
tL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 were significantly lower in BAL fluid of mice treated with the fB antibody<br>
(data not shown). Similarly, treatment of sensitized and challenged C4 -/- mice with anti-factor B<br>
decreased their airway responsiveness and airway inflammation (Fig. 10). These results are in<br>
accord with studies using complement inhibitors which do not discriminate between the classical<br>
and alternative pathways but block the development of a late airway response as well as AHR.<br>

Example 3<br>
The following example describes additional binding data for a panel of anti-factor B<br>
antibodies produced by the present inventors. Assays were used to test the binding and/or inhibition<br>
of mouse factor B and human factor B for the various antibodies. As can be seen, the mAb 1379<br>
both binds and inhibits mouse and human factor B. In contrast, the mAb designated 624 can bind<br>
both mouse and human factor B, but does not inhibit the human alternative pathway. A competition<br>
ELISA was used to further evaluate the antibodies. As can be seen, the antibodies 624, 691, and<br>
1231 do not block binding by 1379. These antibodies must therefore bind the protein at a different<br>
site, explaining why they bind factor B without inhibiting its function in vitro. However, antibodies<br>
395,1322 and 1060 are competitive inhibitors of 1379.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 4<br>
The following example describes the epitope mapping for mAb 13 79 on the human factor<br>
B surface.<br>
Initial experiments to map the epitope for the mAb 13 79 antibody indicated that the epitope<br>
or antibody binding site on factor B was not linear. The antibody avidly bound the full length protein<br>
when it was adhered to an ELISA plate. Peptides that were 10 amino acids in length were<br>
constructed to span the region of the protein where binding is known to occur (SCR2-3). When<br>
these peptides were adhered to an ELIS A plate, the antibody did not recognize them, indicating that<br>
none of these linear sequences was recognized as the epitope.<br>
The predicted conserved binding surface or epitope of the human factor B that is recognized<br>
by mAb!379 was modeled. Briefly, the tertiary structure of human factor B was built based on the<br>
resolved three-dimensional structure of CR2-SCR1-2 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) id 1GHQ). The<br>
final model was refined to the minimal energy state, with the constrains fixed on the four absolutely<br>
conserved Cys residues of each SCR. The sequence identity of factor B SCR2-3 with CR2 SCR1-2<br>
is 30% (highest), with factor H SCR15-16 25%, with CD46 20%. Fig. 11 shows the model of the<br>
factor B structure with the amino acid positions corresponding to the mAb 1379 epitope (relative to<br>
SEQ ID NO:2) indicated. The residues that are believed to form the conformational epitope for the<br>
mAbl379 antibody are: Alal37, Tyrl39, Serl41, Glul82, Serl85, Thrl89, Glul90, and Serl92,<br>
although the epitope may contain only a few, substantially all, or more residues than is depicted in<br>
Fig. 11.<br>
This model can now be used to predict the effects of the previously discussed factor B<br>
mutants from Hourcade (Hourcade, 1995, /. Biol. Chem.) that were initially used to characterize the<br>
epitope for the mAb 1379 antibody (see Example 1). Shown below are four mutants from this panel<br>
that are contain residues belonging to the mAb 1379 epitope model as shown in Fig. 11. As shown<br>
below, the B17 and B23 mutants, which were shown in Example 1 to reduce the binding of<br>
mAbl379 have particularly substitutions (indicated in bold and italics) that are predicted to face<br>
inward and therefore may be disturbing the structure of the epitope or conserved binding surface for<br>
mAbl379. Mutant B16/17, although containing residues that are within the modeled epitope for<br>
mAbl379, is not predicted to have mutations that would disturb the structure of the epitope, which<br>
can explain why this mutant bound to the antibody in the initial mapping experiments. Similarly,<br>
although mutant B23/24 also contains residues that are within the modeled epitope for mAbl379,<br>
this mutant also bound to the antibody in the initial mapping experiments, the residues forming the<br>
antibody contact sites are likely not disturbed by the mutations. This experiment also illustrates that<br>
the antibody of the invention may bind to factor B proteins, or portions thereof, having conservative<br>
mutations or mutations that do not substantially disrupt this epitope.<br>

Fig. 12 is a schematic drawing showing a modeled complex of mAB1379 (one Fab<br>
fragment) binding to factor B, with the antigen binding sides of the Fab having been modeled to<br>
cover the entire mapped epitope region as defined above in Fig. 11.<br>
Example 5<br>
The following example demonstrates that inhibition of the alternative complement pathway,<br>
and specifically, inhibition of factor B, inhibits and protects animals from injury in renal ischemiareperfusion.<br>
Experiments have been conducted to test the efficacy of the mAb 1379 at ameliorating injury<br>
in the model of ischemic acute renal failure, hi this model, ischemic acute renal failure is induced<br>
by anesthetizing the mice and clamping the renal pedicles for 24 minutes. Mice were injected<br>
intraperitoneally with 1 rng of the mAb an hour prior to the induction of injury. This protocol causes<br>
a reversible form of ischemic acute renal failure, with the peak injury typically occurring 24 hours<br>
after the clamps are removed from the renal pedicles and blood flow is restored to the kidney. The<br>
renal injury is then assessed by measuring the accumulation of nitrogenous wastes such as SUN and<br>
serum creatinine and assessment of the morphologic injury of the kidneys by a renal pathologist.<br>
The inventors have demonstrated that the alternative pathway of complement is activated soon after<br>
reperfusion of the kidneys, and that this activation contributes to the resultant renal injury.<br>
Examination of the kidneys by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis confirmed<br>
that the 1379 antibody described herein effectively prevented complement activation after I/R. As<br>
shown in Fig. 13, mice that were pre-treated with 1379 demonstrated milder increases in serum urea<br>
nitrogen (SUN) after 24 hours of reperfusion when compared to wild-type controls (78 Â± 15 mg/dL<br>
vs. 119Â± 15 mg/dL, P
were treated with 1379. When graded by a pathologist in a blinded fashion, the 1379 treated mice<br>
demonstrated significantly less tubular damage than control mice (3.3 Â± 0.5 vs. 4.9 Â± 0.1, p 
n=10 for each group). Thus, 1379 effectively prevents complement activation in the mouse kidney<br>
after I/R, and pre-treatment with 1379 ameliorates the functional and histologic injury after I/R.<br>
In another experiment, renal tubular epithelial cells in culture were subjected to two hours<br>
of chemical anoxia by incubating them with antimycin. The cells were then exposed to fresh mouse<br>
serum (as a source of complement), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured as a marker<br>
of cell death, and expressed in arbitrary units utilizing a commercial assay (Promega, Madison, WI).<br>
Cells that were exposed to antimycin and serum released significantly greater LDH then cells<br>
exposed to serum alone (100,140Â±3307 for antimycin + serum vs. 69,255Â±9754, p
shown). When the serum was incubated with the mAb 1379 prior to incubation with cells, however,<br>
the LDH release fell to 76,471Â±7720 (p
shown). The mAb 1379 thus protects hypoxic renal tubular epithelial cells that are exposed to<br>
components of the alternative pathway either in vivo or in vitro.<br>
