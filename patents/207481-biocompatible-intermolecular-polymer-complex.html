BIOCMPATIBLE    INTERMOLECULAR   POLYMER   COMPLEX,<br>
- 1 -<br><br>
Introduction<br>
Oxidised cellulose and its .derivatives-have, been widely used in medicine and pharmacy since the first preparation by Chait and Kenyon [Shorygin P P., Chait E.V.: Zh. obshch. chim. 7, 188 (1937); Yackel E.C., Kenyon W.O.: J Am. Chem. Soc. 64, 121(1942)]..<br>
Other types of haemostatics and antifibrinolytics have been introduced, however, oxidised cellulose especially in the highly pure form of a polyanhydroglucuronic acid and their copolymers (PAGA), and notably salts thereof, is used in various medicinal applications as a completely resorbable semi-synthetic polymer with minimum adverse effects in the organism. This is true for both the basic substance prepared according to GB 709684; US 4,100,341, or salts thereof prepared according to more recent patents, such as.: CS AO 242920; EP 0659440A1 and PCT IE 98/00004.<br>
It is known that after application of oxidised cellulose to stop surface bleeding a rigid scab is formed, especially on movable parts of the body, such as knees, fingers or ankles. This may be a disadvantage because it can crack and lead to renewed bleeding. Using a haemostat according to PCT IE 98/00004 this disadvantage can be partially overcome by altering the technological conditions of the manufacture (such as increasing the amount of crosslinks) which brings about increased accumulation of the body fluids in the substance and thereby the flexibility of the wound cover is optimised.<br>
Within the last two decades, during investigations of various types of polysaccharides, it was established that during their biodegradation in the living organism, certain functions of various types of cells are influenced.

5	on the type of bond in the main glycosydic chain, on the value of the degree of<br>
polymerisation, on the presence of various functional groups, and the degree of<br>
ionisation thereof, on the type of structural units, and the type of salt or a<br>
complex salt thereof, these polysaccharides affect the immune system of the<br>
organism. It seems for instance that glucanes bonded by an 1,3 (3 bond have<br>
10	immunomodulative properties while 1,4 P bonded glucanes suppress tumorous<br>
growth. There are however exceptions to these rules. An important factor underlying these properties is the presence of the glucuronic acid in the chain.<br>
It is known that a large proportion of bonds between individual substances<br>
15	occurring in living organisms is of a non-covalent nature, such as hydrogen bonds,<br>
van der Waals forces, or bonds of an ionic character especially with biopolymers. These bonds create so-called intermolecular polymeric complexes (IMC) such as for example, heparin - peptides. In general these complexes represent a new class of macromolecular substances formed by association of individual polymer chains<br>
20	into macromolecules through secondary bonding interactions.  According to the<br>
nature of the interactions these complexes can be subdivided into polyelectrolyte complexes, hydrogen bonded complexes, stereo complexes and charge transfer complexes. These types of complexes have a number of common properties, notably an organised supermolecular structure and the ability to create other<br>
25	higher supermolecular entities.    The characteristic feature is their ability to<br>
undergo restructuring depending on the conditions prevailing in their environment. Further they are capable of undergoing interpolymer substitution reactions and it is especially due to this latter ability that the IMCs in their behaviour come close to imitating biochemical processes occurring in living<br>
30	organisms.<br><br>

The invention in particular involves the use of polyanhydroglucuronic acids and salts thereof. The term polyanhydroglucuronic acid and salts there of as used herein also includes copolymers thereof, especially with anhydroglucose. This is hereinafter referred to as PAGA. 5<br>

Detailed Description<br>
We have now found that by preparing polymeric intermolecular complexes (IMC)<br>
of glucuronoglucanes,   notably  microdispersed   PAG A,   prepared  especially.<br>
5	according to PCT IE 98/00004 it is possible to enhance the haemostatic effect of<br>
the final products on this basis and the properties of the temporary wound cover formed after the haemostasis is achieved such as its flexibility and resistance to cracking on movable parts of the body.<br>
10	It is also possible to upgrade physicomechanical properties of the final products on<br>
this basis. Such IMCs make it possible to prepare application forms whose manufacture from a pure PAGA or their simple salts is extremely difficult. Such application forms includes non-woven textile-like structures or polymeric films. To modify or upgrade the physical mechanical properties it is sufficient to use<br>
15	even a relatively small amount of polymeric counterion while it is possible to<br>
obtain suitable application properties within a broad concentration range of the components. The ratio of the glucuronoglucane to polymeric counterion can be 0.99:0.01 to 0.01:0.99.<br>
20	Another advantage of glucuronoglucane based IMCs is the possibility to control<br>
their biological properties such as varying the degree of haemostatis, resorption time, or irnrnunomodulative properties, and the like.<br>
Polymeric cations suitable to form IMCs with glucuronoglucanes prepared for<br>
25	example according to PCT IE 98/00004 may roughly be subdivided into the<br>
following groups:<br>
1.        Synthetic biocompatible nitrogen-containing oligomers and polymers.<br>
30	a)  Derivatives of acrylamide and methacrylamide and their copolymers<br>
[such as polyacrylamide, copolymer of hydroxyethylmetacrylate and<br><br>
WO 00/05269	PCT/IE99/00067<br>
-7-<br>
hydroxypropylmetacrylamide, copolymer of acrylarnide, butylacrylate, maleinanhydride, and methylmetacrylate, and the like], or else cacionised natural polysaccharides such as starches, celluloses, or gums such as guargumhydroxypropyltriammonium chloride.<br>
b) Synthetic or semi-synthetic polyaminoacids such as polylysin, polyarginin, a,ß-poly-{N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-DL-asparamide. Synthetic antifibrinolytics hexadimethrindibromide (polybren) can also be included in this group.<br>
2.	Natural  or semi-synthetic peptides such as gelatine, protamines,  or<br>
fibrinopeptides and ther .derivatives,<br>
3.	Natural aminoglucanes such as fractionated chitin and its de-acetylated<br>
derivative chitosan, of microbial origin or isolated from the shells of<br>
arthropods such as crabs.<br>
In preparing IMCs on the basis of PAGA according to the invention these three groups of substances can be combined to obtain required properties of the final product.<br>
In general it can be said that IMCs using substances from la and 1b would preferably be used to prepare various types of highly absorbant biocompatible dressing materials in the form of nonwovens, films, plasters, and pads.<br>
IMCs using the substances from 2 and 3 may serve as efficient haemostatic agents for internal applications in the microfibrillar form, in the microdispersed form as dusting powders, in the form of films, granules, tablets or non-woven textile-like<br><br>
-8-<br>
We have also found out that in the form of film-like cell culture matrices the latter IMCs incorporating PAGA and salts thereof as prepared according to PCT IE 98/00004 have a favourable effect on the growth of fibroblasts and keratinocytes.<br>
While it is also possible to create IMCs using structural scleroproteins of the collagen type as disclosed in WO 9800180A, it is preferable to use the above mentioned groups of substances because of the possibility of contamination of the final product by telopeptides, viruses or pyrogens. Collagen can affect in an uncontrolled manner, the immune response of the organism because formation of antibodies can be provoked by any portion of the collagen structure even though the main determinants occur in the terminal regions of the collagen macromolecule. Removal of telopeptides only partially solves the antigenicity problem (Michaeli et al: Science, 1969, 166, 1522).<br>
By preparing IMCs according to the invention it is possible to essentially enhance properties of the originally prepared glucoronoglucanes such as 1,4 ß PAGA. For instance an intermolecular complex salt of PAGA and gelatine in one single production step can be used to prepare final products in the form of a non woven, film, microdispersed granules, or dispersions. In contrast to collagen, suitably hydrolysed gelatine is well tolerated, has no toxicity or side effects and it is a much less costly raw material. We have found out that this complex has very good haemostatic properties being about 40% higher than the original PAGA calcium sodium salt. This is despite the fact that the gelatine itself only displays a haemostatic effect after an addition of thrombin [Schwartz S.I. et al.: Principles of Surgery, St.Louis: McGraw Hill Co, 1979, p. 122-123]. In this case the absorption in the organism can be controlled by changing the composition of the complex within the range from tens of hours to several months. This complex has a higher haemostatic efficiency and can be used as an embolisation or microembolisation product.  It can also be used to prepare haemostatic layers of<br><br>
-9-<br>
highly absorbent multi-layer dressings or resorbable plasters, though more costly polybren or protamines could also be applied.<br>
An important advantage of these IMCs is the fact that the compounds can be prepared within a single manufacturing operation using the hydrolytic process described in PCT IE 98/00004 which makes these products cost effective.<br>
These IMCs can further be modified by biologically active and/or biologically acceptable substances. Because the IMCs prepared by the present procedure are either of a microdispersed or microfibrillar nature, the active substances tend to be bound uniformly and also are uniformly released in the organism without the need for other adjuvants such as microcrystalline waxes or stearates. However, the addition of such adjuvants is not excluded.<br>
Biologically active substances which can be incorporated into the IMC may involve, for instance, antibiotics carrying at least a weak positive charge in the molecule such as cephalosporins (cephotaxin), aminoglycosides (neomycin, gentamycin, amikacin), penicillins (tikarcilin) or macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin) and the like.<br>
In cases where the calcium/sodium salt of PAGA or its IMC complexes according to the invention are used as microembolisation or embolisation agents in regional chemotherapy of malign tumours, suitable types of cytostatics such as adriamycin or derivatives of 1,4-diaminoanthrachinone can be incorporated. It is also possible to use the IMCs as detaching ligands for platinum(II) based cytostatics.<br>
Biologically acceptable substances used for modification of the IMCs include, for instance, glycerol and its polymers (polyglycerols); mono, di, and certain triglycerides; polyethyleneglycols; monopropyleneglycol; block copolymers of polyethyleneoxides and polypropyleneoxides (Pluronic); starches; cyclodextrines;<br><br>
WO 00/05269	PCT/IE99/O0067<br>
-10-<br>
polyvinylalcohols; cellulose and its derivatives; in general, substances that, in the concentrations used, are not irritating or toxic for the living organism while being capable of further optimising the physicomechanical properties of the final product based on the IMCs according to the invention.<br>
The invention will be more clearly understood from the following examples of polymer complexes of glucuronoglucanes.<br>

Procedure:<br>
30g of N-HANCE 3000 were placed into a 5 1 beaker and 3 1 of demineralised water 2uS were added. The contents of the beaker were intensely stirred for 30 minutes. The pH value was adjusted to less than 4.5 by the addition of an acetic acid solution leading to a viscosity rise.<br>
60 1 of demineralised water 2µS were introduced into a mixer. 3 kg of CaCl2.6H2O anal.grade were added and the contents heated up to a temperature of 50°C with stirring. On dissolution of the calcium chloride the stirring was interrupted and 2.7 kg of the raw oxidised cotton wool were introduced. The mixer was closed and the contents were agitated for 120 seconds. The pH value of the contents was adjusted by addition of a 20% solution of Na2CO3 to 6 - 6.5 and 13 kg of H2O2 30% were introduced. The fibre suspension was slowly agitated for 10 minutes. Then the pH value was readjusted to 4.5 - 5.0 and the prepared viscous solution of N-HANCE 3000 was introduced. The contents of the mixer were stirred intensely for 30 seconds. Subsequently 601 of synthetic rectified ethanol cone. 98% were introduced into the mixer. 15 seconds after adding the ethanol the contents of the mixer were transferred onto a vibrating screen, and the supernatant liquid was filtered off. The filtration cake was redispersed in the mixer in 60 1 of a mixture of 18 1 of synthetic rectified ethanol cone. 98% and 42 1 of demineralised water 2(iS. The fibre suspension was filtered again on the vibrating screen.<br>
The isolated material thus prepared may further serve to prepare final products of the nonwoven type via a wet or dry process.<br><br>

Into a 1 litre sulphonation flask equipped with a turbostirrer and a heater, 400 ml of redistilled H2O were placed,  15.73 g of CaCl2.6H2O were added and on dissolution, 40.0 g of   20% Na2CO3 solution were introduced under stirring. Subsequently, 50 g of oxidised Linters were added to the white emulsion formed and the contents were heated up to 95°C with the stirring intensity set to a maximum. After 10 minutes, 30 g of 30% H2O2 were added into the flask and the hydrolysis continued for another 10 minutes. The contents were then cooled down to 60°C on a water bath and the pH of the system was adjusted to a value of 4.5 - 5.0 by the addition of a 20% solution of Na2CO3. A gelatine solution (10 g of gelatine  in 70 g of redistilled H2O) wanned to 50°C was added and left to react for another 20 minutes. The flask contents were then cooled to 30°C in a water bath and 626 ml of synthetic rectified ethanol cone. 98% were added gradually under intense stirring. The suspension of IMC thus formed was isolated using a laboratory centrifuge. The supernatant liquid was filtered away and the cake was redispersed into 250 ml of 50% ethanol. The system was centrifuged again and after the separation of the supernatant liquid, the IMC was redispersed into 250 ml of synthetic rectified ethanol cone. 98% and alllowed stand for 4 hours. It was then centrifuged again, redispersed into 99.9 % isopropanol, and left to stand for a minimum of 10 hours at 20°C. The gel formed was centrifuged and the product was dried in a rotary vacuum dryer or a hot-air dryer.<br>
The product can be used, for instance, for microembolisation, for preparation of haemostatic dusting powders, for manufacture of polymer drugs, e.g. based on cytostatics, or for preparation of spheric particles for macroembolisation.<br><br>
