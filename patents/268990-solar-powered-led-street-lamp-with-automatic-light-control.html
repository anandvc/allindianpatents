				<td>SOLAR POWERED LED STREET LAMP WITH AUTOMATIC LIGHT CONTROL<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br><br>
This invention relates to a solar powered LED streetlight and more particularly to an LED streetlight, which has direction board or billboard or light box, brightness and darkness auto-adjustment function and can use solar as its power source.<br><br>
BACKGROUND ART<br><br>
At present, most of the streetlight use generic power and lamp bulb. There is also example of convert solar power to generic power supply the streetlight. Because the power consumption of generic lamp is pretty large, the solar power collected in the daytime can not supply all the night and generic power is needed for supplement. Moreover, the streetlight keeps on working all the night, which will shorten the life of lamp bulb. Thus the current streetlight does not meet the goal of 100% energy saving. LED has the advantages of long life, high luminous flux, null radiation, anti-strike and low power consumption. It belongs to green power saving lighting and can make up the above mentioned shortages of current streetlight. In addition, present direction board or guide post on the roadsides are made from reflection materials, which needs to function by reflecting the external light, like, streetlight. The electron bulletin board or some commercial billboard need to set up a stand rack. All these can sometimes cause inconvenience.<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br><br>
It is, therefore, an object of the invention, to solve the present technical shortage or problems and to provide a kind of green, solar-powered streetlight, which has billboard or direction board or light box with LED lighting and which has a long lifetime. The streetlight can be used on the road or in the residential area.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to provide the brightness/darkness detection sensor, which will sense the brightness/darkness, sending signal to central controller, to turn streetlight on or off automatically. <br><br>
It is another object of the invention to provide the human body inductor, which will send signal to central controller, to tune the light into low brightness status when it detects that nobody is in the detection area, or to tune the light into high brightness status when it detects that somebody is in the detection area. Because the light brightness can change, it reduces the waste of power and makes good use of the solar power collected in the daytime while no more supplement power is needed. Because the life of LED will not be influenced by brightness change, this overall increases the life time of lamp.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to install the direction board or billboard or light box on the lamp pole.<br><br>
These objects are accomplished by a solar photovoltaic board, a brightness/darkness detection sensor, a lamp pole, a LED lamp, a LED direction board or billboard or light box, a base with an accumulator storage battery inside, a central controller and a human body inductor. The features are that the solar photovoltaic board is mounted on the top end of the lamp pole, the LED direction board or billboard or light box is mounted on the lamp pole or the lamp pole itself is designed to be direction board or billboard or light box, the accumulator storage battery set and the central controller are situated in the base, the human body inductor and the LED lamp are mounted on the transversal bar of the lamp pole, the direction board or billboard or light box is also mounted with photovoltaic board and a plurality of LED are arrayed so as to constitute the characters or the marks on the LED direction board or billboard or light box.<br><br>
Within the invention, the photovoltaic board collects solar power and when the light turns on in the night, the photovoltaic board on the direction board or billboard or light box continues to collect LED light power. The solar module will charge the storage battery via diode Dl, switch K2, normally closed end; when central controller detects that the storage battery is full, it will connect switch K2 and Kl, cut charge circuit and connect load R, protecting the storage battery from overcharge.<br><br>
Within the invention, the brightness/darkness detection sensor can configure the brightness/darkness threshold value. When the darkness threshold value is met, the signal will be sent to central controller, to connect switch K3. Then the power is on, lighting LED lamp and direction board or billboard or light box with low brightness and low power light. When the brightness threshold value is met, the signal will be sent to central controller, to disconnect switch K3. Then the power of streetlight is off.<br><br>
Within the invention, the human body inductor is used to detect human body. When somebody is in the detection area, the inductor will automatically send signal to central controller, the controller will adjust the voltage and current from DC/DC converter, LED lamp and LED in the direction board or billboard or light box turns into high brightness status; when somebody is out from the detection area, they will turn back to low brightness status. As time goes on, the capacity of storage battery goes down, the central controller will adjust the voltage and current from DC/DC converter until disconnecting switch K3 and connecting load R, which will prevent storage battery from over-discharge damage.<br><br>
Within the invention, the LED can be replaced by LED chip or any other lighting components. The invention can use generic power when removing solar module and re-allocating the brightness/darkness detection senor on the top of lamp pole.<br><br>
In the said invention, the energy-saving LED is used as lighting source and the human body inductor is installed. When there is nobody, especially deep in the night, the light can be tuned to a low brightness status. Because of it, the power is saved, the solar power collect in the daytime is enough for the whole night without the need of other supplement power. And because of the brightness/darkness detection senor, the streetlight can be automatically turned on/off, few human resources will need to handle this matter everyday.<br><br>
For the better understanding of the said invention, the objects, characteristics and advantages of the said invention can be illustrated in details through drawings and carrying-outs.<br><br>
