				<td>TECHNICAL F1ELP QF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of plugs for insertion into sockets and more specifically to a plug to be used in a connector/ which is to be connected to the system connector of a portable electronic device,<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Portable electronic devices like cellular phones are today getting smaller and smaller. In view of this it is often necessary to provide the system connectors used for among other things charging of the battery of the device to have a- smaller height, which makes it necessary to use new designs for plugs to fit in these system connectors for ensuring safe contact. This requirement Is especially important in so-called clamshell phones, which have two bodies that can be folded over each other and where only one such body Includes the system connector. There is however still a problem of ensuring that the plug Is not damaged when being bent while inserted in a socket.<br>
The Ericsson plug for system connectors based on 3V and 4V platforms has used a plug with two flexible bars joined together by a snap hook at the tip, which bars are both break-off and overload safe. The bars are also flexible at the point of exit from the connector body. The problem with this construction is however that it is hard to dimension for use in phones that are thin. When Inserting this plug Into a socket it is inserted straight into the socket, while the plug needs to be bent in order to be removed from the socket.<br>
Another type of plug is the type Molex-S09li80V91l8l or the plug used in the Nokia phone model 5110. This plug has one rigid bar provided with a protrusion at the tip for engaging a recess of a mating socket. The plug is furthermore provided with a spring and a button, where the spring acts to force the bar against the wall Including the recess and thereby acts to force the protrusion into the recess. The button forces the bar and spring downward for releasing the plug from the socket. When the button is depressed the protrusion is made to disengage with the recess of the socket. This type of plug is however not break-off or overload safe and can therefore break/ i.e. does not safely release contact in case the plug is subjected to great forces in a direction essentially parallel to the opening area of the socket.<br>
Yet another type of plug is the Nokia connector PoPPort*, which also includes a single rigid bar with a spring. The bar has a protrusion, which is pressed by the spring into a cut-out of<br>
a metal wall within the socket. The protrusion is shaped for being self-releasing when the pull-out force applied reaches a certain level. The bar is here short and the socket has a large chamber for allowing the connector to be broken off without damage. Because of the low spring force of this plug and the short length of the plug, the fit within the socket can be less satisfactory, which can lead to unwanted disconnection of the plug.<br>
There Is thus a need for a new type of plug for use in system connectors that have small height dimensions for enabling insertion In thin devices, white at the same time avoiding breaking of the plug In case of a wrong disconnection of the plug from the socket into which it is plugged because of accidentally applied force in the wrong direction.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is thus directed towards solving the problem of providing a plug that can be inserted and taken out of a socket In an easy manner while providing damage-free break-off of the connection if the plug is subjected to a damaging force when being inserted.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, this problem is solved by a plug for insertion into a socket, comprising: a first and a second spaced apart bar each having a first essentially rigid section and a second essentially flexible section shaped for releasable engaging of the socket.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention is directed towards a plug including the features of the first aspect, wherein the first section furthermore has a larger height than the second section,<br>
A third aspect of the present invention is directed towards a plug including the features of the second aspect, wherein the first section of each bar is furthermore provided with a portion adjacent the second section, having a varying height,<br>
A fourth aspect of the present invention is directed towards a plug including the features of the first aspect, wherein the height variation is linear.<br>
A fifth aspect of the present invention is directed towards a plug including the features of the first aspect, wherein the second section includes a recess engaging a corresponding protrusion of the socket.<br>
A sixth aspect of the present invention is directed towards a plug including the features of the first aspect, wherein the second section includes a protrusion for engaging a recess of the socket.<br>
A seventh aspect of the present invention fs directed towards a plug including the features of the first aspect, wherein the second sections of the two bars are joined in an end furthest from the first sections by a third section having a spring like action.<br>
An eighth aspect of the present Invention is directed towards a plug Including the features of the first aspect, wherein the relationship between the height and the length of the plug is at feast 1/3.<br>
A ninth aspect of the present invention Is directed towards a plug fncluding the features of the first aspect, further including a plug frame haying a front end wall, whereift the two bars are fixedly attached at and project out from the front end wall of the plug frame.<br>
A tenth aspect of the present invention is directed towards a plug including the features of the ninth aspect, wherein the bars are attached to the front end wall with the first sections.<br>
The present invention is also directed towards solving the problem of providing a connector that can be plugged Into and unplugged from a mating connector in an easy manner whi/e providing damage-free break-off of the connection if the connector is subjected to a damaging force when being inserted.<br>
According to an eleventh aspect of the present invention, this problem is solved by a connector Including at least one plug for insertion into a socket of a corresponding connector, wherein the plug comprises;<br>
a first: and a second spaced apart bar each having a first essentially rigid section and a second essentially flexible section shaped for reteasable engaging of the socket.<br>
The Invention has the following advantages. It is small and compact and allows small heights of the plug used for a system connector. It allows stable attachment of accessories to a system connector. It also allows damage-free break off of the plug from the socket of the system connector in case the plug is bent. The normal insertion and removal of the plug is furthermore direct and easily understandable because no bending is needed when removina the olua from the socket-.<br>
It should be emphasized that the term "comprises/comprising* when used in this specification ts taken to specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps or components, but does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features Integers, steps, components or groups thereof.<br>

. Both these portions are thus surrounded by a plug frame 30<br>

used to grip an interior wait of the cavity and the bars are Is of the cavity, A distance element 26 provided between the tely at the point of exit from the cavity, ensures that the bars portion of the first section. Because of this element 26 the bars<br>

The second portion a progressive decrease of the rigidity until the plug Is fairly n, which is used when allowing insertion of the pfug in a e to be inserted straight into a socket 17 having a cavity for horizontal direction y. The top end of the bars 13 and 15 are<br>

Here the walls of the socket cavity have two g to the recesses 22 of the second section of the two bars 13 here relatively stiff when being inserted Into the cavity, while e allowing safe securing of the pfug in the socket 17. When socket, it should be pulled straight out from the cavity<br>
direction opposite to the direction y, without bending. This user moves the plug in the opposite direction of the one he which is more logical and therefore more user friendly than for plugs.<br><br>
subj set<br>
Sometimes the plug is broken before the plug is<br><br>
to bending and then it is important that the connection Is destroyed. The third interconnecting section 20 here functions<br><br>
(ike a spring allowing sepi two bars are easily<br>
race bending of the two bars 13 and 15 while ensuring that the inserted into the socket 17.<br><br>
The rigidities of the bars are naturally decreasing with the distance from the and of the plug frame 30. The height of the third sections can therefore be varied In that the first<br><br>
portion of the first section<br><br>
protrudes from the cavity of the end wall and is fairly long, such<br><br>
tfiat the second portion of the first section Is very short. In a second embodiment of the<br><br>
invention, which Is shown<br>
in fig. 5, essentially showing the same view as fig. 4, the second<br>
portion 18 of this first section has been provided as a step size variation of the height between the first portion or the first section and the second portion. As can be seen here the first portion of the first section extends far beyond the end wal! of the plug frame. This means that a more rigid second section than in the embodiment shown in fig. 3 and 4 wilt be obtained<br><br>
Fig. 6 shows yet a variatiop part of the first section is section and joins the secoi provided.<br>
of the plug in the same view as in fig. S, where the second ^ery short and has a quick steep transition into the second d section essentially at the place where the recesses 22 are<br><br>
sectional view taken along plug. Here the diminishing<br>
Now the break-off of the plug from the socket when it Is subjected to an overly high force In the vertical direction wil( be described in relation to fig. 7 a - d, which show a cross-<br>
the same sections as In fig. 3 - 6 of yet another variation of the heights of the bars in the second portions of the first sections<br>
are provided on the upper Jnd lower sides facing away from the neighbouring bar. The<br><br>
third section is Here for Hiu<br><br>
Jtrative purposes shown as a spring. In fig. 7A, the plug is fully<br><br>
inserted into the socket ana no external force is applied on the plug in the vertical direction<br><br>
z. In fig. 7b a force is app in a direction perpendicular<br><br>
ed on socket 17 in an opposite direction to the direction z, i.e. to the bars 13 and 15. Note that the force could equally as well<br><br>
et wall as is shown In fig. 7 d. With more pressure applied the 1th the socket cavity essentially broken and the energy in the<br>
have been provided on the connector body in the direction z in order to provide the same effect. Because of this the i dug starts rotating around the insertion point into the socket and the two bars are bent downwards, where the first bar 13 experiences most of the pressure. The recess of t'he first bar 13 therefore now starts to disengage from the corresponding protrusion of the socket wall. As the pressure is increased the two bars are bent down further/ leading :c the recess of the top bar snapping out of the engagement with the corresponding socf top bar has Its connection v two bars pushes the plug and socket apart, as is shown in fig 7d. In the process described above the spring like third section 20 allows the two bars to experience the pressure<br><br>
separately from each other,<br><br>
where the top bar is pressed closer to the second bar. This<br><br>
leads to a disengagement of the plug from the socket without the bars breaking. It should furthermore be realised thit the plug and socket can also experience a similar type of pressure in the opposite direction than what was described here.<br><br>
By providing the two paral<br>
el bars 13 and 15 it is possible to provide a smaif enough sized<br>
plug, the height of which c an be held to a very smalt size, which is about 2,4 mm in the preferred embodiment. Sa e mechanical contact Is ensured while the breaking of the connection Is ensured tn a ise a too strong mechanical force Is applied in the wrong direction on the connector i.e. in essentially a vertical direction, so that the bars are not destroyed. This is ensured by providing two essentially parallel bars instead of one. The length of the part of the b; irs projecting out of the plug frame are 6,5 mm and the plug height is 2,4 mm in the pr sferred embodiment. The ratio between them is at least 1/3. The bars are furthermore prefc rably between 0,7 and l mm high at the point of exit from the plug frame 30, i.e. in the 1 :rst portion of the first section, and the second section preferably has a height of 0,4 - 0,5 nW   .<br><br>
fig. 4 pr 5 as weff as to provide the second section longer from the end wall. It is also<br>
Another possible variation<br><br>
Is to provide the second section doser to the end wait than in<br><br>
possible to nave varying U<br>
figths of the second portion of the first section for providing<br>
varying degrees of decrea ;e in height of the second portion of the first section. There are thus a number of ways that these parts of the bars can be varied in order to provide suitable rigidity while at tf e same time being flexible at the top for providing engagement of the plug. Normally than gh it fs the dimensioning of the first section, which decides how much bending the bars ar; to be allowed to be subjected to, while the dimensioning of the second section is more de Ssrve regarding how easy or hard it is to insert the plug in the socket, tt should furtherm ore be realised that the two bars do not have to be separate in the end where they are in ierted into the cavity of the plug frame, but can be joined there.<br><br>
the two bars extend. It can just as well be a solid wall out from which the bars extend. The<br>
The front end wall of the 
bars can therefore also b«<br><br>
onnector body does also not have to have a cavity into which<br>
beams that are solidly fixed to the front end wall of the pfug<br><br><br><br>
frame. What fs Important<br><br>
though is that they are separate when they leave the plug frame<br><br>
in order to provide bars tf at are rigid at least at the point of exit from the plug frame. The<br><br>
plug according to the inv
 <br>
ntion can furthermore be provided without the third section.<br><br>
The present invention has heights of the plug used to a system connector. It the system connector fn<br>
many advantages. It is small and compact and allows small fbr a.system connector. It allows stable attachment of accessories also allows damage-free break off of the plug from the socket of dase the plug is bent. The normal insertion and removal of the<br><br>
plug is furthermore direct and easily understandable because no bending Is needed when removing the ptug from the socket.<br><br>
