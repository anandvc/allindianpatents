				<td>The present invention relates to group A streptogramin derivatives of general formula-<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
as well as their salts, which exhibit a particularly advantageous antibacterial activity.<br>
Among the known streptogramins, pristinamycin (RP  7293),  an  antibacterial of natural origin produced by Streptomyces pristinaespiralis was first isolated in 1955. The   pristinamycin  marketed  under the  name   Pyrostacine®   consists  mainly  of pristinamycin IIA combined with pristinamycin IA.<br>
Another antibacterial of the class of streptogramins: virginiamycin., has been prepared from Streptomyces virginiae, ATCC 13161 [Antibiotics and Chemotherapy, 5, 632 (1955)].   Virginiamycin  (Staphylomycine®)  consists  mainly of factor MI   (VMI)    . combined with factor S (VS).<br>
Semisynthetic derivatives of streptograrnins of structure:<br>
(Structure Removed) <br>
for which n is 0 to 2 have been described in patents EP 135410 and EP 191662. Combined with asemisynthetic component of group B streptogramins they manifest a synergistic action and can be used by the injection route.<br>
In International Patent Application WO 99/05165, there have been described group A streptogramin derivatives of general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which RI is a radical -NR'R" or -NR'OR'", R2 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl, and the bond ~ is a single bond or a double bond, which are antimicrobial agents.<br>
However, these derivatives do not achieve particularly high levels of activity and, moreover, do not always have a spectrum as broad as desired.<br>
It has now been found that the group A streptogramin derivatives of general formula (I) in which:<br>
—	R1 represents a halogen atom or an azido or thiocyanato radical,<br>
-	R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl radical,<br>
—	R3 represents a hydrogen atom, or the residue of an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic,<br>
aromatic, araliphatic, heterocyclic or heterocyclylaliphatic ester which may be<br>
substituted, and<br>
-	the bond — represents a single bond (stereochemistry 27R) or a double bond,<br>
and their salts when they exist, exhibit a particularly potent antibacterial activity, alone or combined with a group B streptogramin derivative, and/or also manifest a broadened spectrum compared with the usual spectrum for streptogramins.<br>
According to the invention, when RI represents a halogen atom, it may be chosen from fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine;<br>
when the radical R3 represents the residue of an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, araliphatic, hydrocyclic or heterocyclylaliphatic ester which may be substituted, the latter may be chosen, by way of example, from R'3-CO- radicals for which R'3 is phenyl or phenylalkyl which are unsubstituted or which are substituted on the phenyl radical [with one or more radicals chosen from alkyl, optionally carrying a radical NR'R" in which the radicals R' and R", which are identical or different, may be hydrogen atoms or alkyl radicals which can form together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached a 3- to 8-membered saturated or unsaturated heterocyclyl<br>
radical optionally comprising another heteroatom chosen from oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen, it being possible for the said heterocycle itself to be substituted with one or more   radicals   (alkyl,   hydroxyalkyi,   aikyioxyalkyi,   alkyioxycarbonyiaikyi,   aryl, heterocyclyl, heterocyclylalkyl, which are saturated or unsaturated and have 3 to 8 members,   or   -CH2-CO-NR'R"),   or   alternatively   R'   and/or   R"   may   be   a hydroxyalkyl radical, a phenyl radical, a 3- to 8-membered saturated or unsaturated heterocyclylalkyl radical, a radical -CO-NR'R" for which NR'R" is as defined above, or alkyl or acyl radicals which are substituted with NR'R" which is as defined above]., or alternatively R'3 may be chosen from phenyl or phenylalkyl radicals which are substituted on the phenyl radical with one or more radicals [chosen from alkyl, which may  be   substituted-with   an  .alkyloxy  or  alkylthio  radical   optionally  carrying themselves a carboxyl radical or a radical NR'R" as defined above, or chosen from acyloxy which may be substituted with NR'R" as defined above], or alternatively R'3 may be chosen from alkyl or cycloalkyl radicals which are optionally substituted [with a  carboxyl  radical,   a  carboxyalkyldisulfanyl  radical  or with  a  radical  NR'R", -CH2-NR'R", or -CO-NR'R",  or with an alkyloxycarbonyl, alkyloxy or alkyldi-sulfanyl radical which are optionally substituted with NR'R" or -CO-NR'R" for which NR'R" is as defined above], or alternatively R'3 may be chosen from 3- to 8-membered saturated or unsaturated heterocyclyl radicals which  are  optionally substituted [with alkyl or acyl which are themselves optionally substituted with NR'R"].<br>
hi general formula (I), unless otherwise stated, the alkyl or acyl radicals or portions are straight or branched and contain 1 to 12 carbon atoms, the heterocyclyl radicals may be chosen in particular from pyrrolidinyl, pyrrolyl, furyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, pyridyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, pyrizanyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl and imidazolidinyl, and the aryl radicals may be chosen in particular from optionally substituted phenyl and more particularly from phenyl which is substituted with alkyl, alkyloxy or halogen, or with a radical -CH2OH, -(CH2)n-NH2, -(CH2)n-NHalkyl or -(CH2)n-N(alkyl)2.<br>
The streptogramin derivatives of general formula (I) may be prepared by halogenating, converting to an azide or converting to a thiocyanate, a streptogramin derivative of general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which RI is as defined above, the bond ™ represents a single bond (stereochemistry 27R) or a double bond, and in which the hydroxyl function at the 14-position has been previously protected, followed by the removal of the protecting radical and where appropriate, in order to obtain a derivative of general formula (I) for which R3 is other than a hydrogen atom, introduction of the aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, araliphatic, heterocyclic or heterocyclylaliphatic ester residue which may be substituted (R3) according to the usual methods which do not alter the rest of the molecule.<br>
The reactions for halogenating, converting to an azide or converting to a thiocyanate may be carried out in the presence of an aminosulfur trifluoride (for example diethyl-aminosulfur trifluoride, bis(2-methoxyethyl)ammosulfur trifluoride (Deoxofluor®), morpholinosulfur trifluoride) or alternatively in the presence of sulfur tetrafluoride, by means of a reagent such as a tetraalkylarnmonium, trialkylbenzylammonium or trialkylphenylammonium halide, azide or thiocyanate or by means of an alkali metal halide, azide or thiocyanate optionally supplemented with a crown ether. The fluorination reactions may also be carried out by the action of a fluorinating agent such as a sulfur "tluoride [for example morpholinosulfur trifluoride, sulfur tetrafluoride (3. Org. Chem., 40, 3808 (1975)), diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (Tetrahedron, 44, 2875 (1988)), bis(2-methoxyethyl)aminosulfur trifluoride (Deoxofluor®). Alternatively, the fluorination reactions may also be carried out by means of a fluorinating agent such as hexafluoropropyldiethylamine (JP 2,039,546) or N-(2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)diethylamine.<br>
While a tetraalkylammonium halide, azide or thiocyanate is used, the latter may be chosen, by way of example, from tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, tetrapropylammonium, tetrabutylammonium (for example tetra-n-butylammonium), tetrapentylammonium, tetracyclohexylammonium, triethylmethylammonium, tributyl-methylammonium. or trimethylpropylammonium halides, azides or thiocyanates.<br>
The procedure is carried out in an organic solvent such as a chlorinated solvent (for example dichloromethane, dichloroethane or chloroform) or in an ether (for example tetrahydrofuran) at a temperature of between -78 and 40°C (preferably of between 0 and 30°C). It is advantageous to carry out the procedure under argon or under nitrogen. It is understood that the use of the hydroxyl derivative of (16S) configuration leads to the derivative of (16R) configuration.<br>
The protection and deprotection of the hydroxyl radical at the 14-position is carried out according to the usual methods which do not affect the rest of the molecule, in particular by application of the methods described by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (2nd ed.), A. Wiley - Interscience Publication (1991), or by Me Omie, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press (1973). For example, the procedure is carried out by protecting with a trialkylsilyl, alkyldiphenylsilyl (for example t-butyldiphenylsilyl and t-butyldimethylsilyl) or allyl radical which are introduced and removed as described below in the examples.<br>
Where appropriate, when it is desired to prepare a product of general formula (I) for which  KB   is   an   aliphatic,   cycloaliphatic,   aromatic,   araliphatic,   heterocyclic   or heterocyclylaliphatic ester which may be substituted, the subsequent esterification operation is carried out according to the usual methods which do not alter the rest of the molecule. More particularly, the esterification is carried out by the reaction of the acid or of a reactive derivative of the acid (for example acid chloride, reactive ester or anhydride), in the presence or otherwise of a coupling agent such as a carbodiimide (for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) and of a tertiary amine (trialkylamine such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, or pyridine or a derivative) and optionally a catalyst such as 4-N-dimethylaminopyridine, at a temperature of between -40 and +80°C, in an organic solvent such as an amide (for example dimethylformamide or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone), pyridine, a halogenated solvent (for example dichloromethane, dichloroethane or chloroform) or an ether (tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or dimethoxyethane). It is understood that the functions which can interfere with "the reaction are protected beforehand, and then released after the reaction.<br>
The acid or the reactive acid derivative used is prepared as described below in the examples or by analogy with the methods described.<br>
The dihydroxylated group A strep to gramin derivative of general formula (IT) may be obtained by selective reduction of the natural pristinamycin component of general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which R2 is as defined above and the bond ~ represents a single bond (stereochemistry 27R) or a double bond, followed by the separation of the 16S epimer form.<br>
The reduction is advantageously carried out in the presence of a reducing agent such as an alkali metal borohydride, for example sodium borohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride, in an organic solvent chosen from chlorinated solvents (for example dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform)., tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid and alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or 2-propanol, at a temperature of between -78 and 40°C.<br>
The separation of the 16R epimer form and of the 16S epimer form is carried out according to the usual methods; for example, the separation of the epimer forms may be carried out by chromatography, flash chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), on a chiral phase or otherwise, or centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), from the mixture of the 16R and 16S epimers, or by crystallization.<br>
hi particular, (16S)-16-hydroxypnstinamycin EA may be prepared according to F. Le Goffic et al.; Eur. J. Med. - Chimica Therapeutica; January - February, - 16(1), 69-72 (1981).<br>
The pristinamycin derivatives of general formula (IS) correspond respectively to pristinamycin IIA (PIIA), to pristinamycin IIB (PIIB), to pristinamycin IIc (PIIc), to pristinamycin IID (PIID), to pristinamycin IIF (PIIF), and to pristinamycin IIG (PIIG),<br>
which are known components of natural pristinamycin. The components PIIF and PIIG have been described in European Patent EP 614910.<br>
Pristinamycin IIe (PIIc) and pristinamycin IID (PIID) may be obtained as described by J.C. Barriere et al., Expert. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 3(2), 115-31 (1994).<br>
The preparation and separation of the components of the natural group A streptogramins [streptogramins of general formula (HI)] is carried out by fermentation and isolation of the constituents from the fermentation broth according to or by analogy with the method described by J. Preud'homme et al., Bull. Soc. China. Fr., vol. 2, 585 (1968) or in European Patent EP 614910. Alternatively, the preparation of the natural components of group A may be carried out by specific fermentation, as described in patent application FR 2,689,518.<br>
The streptogramin derivatives of general formula (I) may be purified, where appropriate, by physical methods such as crystallization, chromatography or CPC.<br>
Some of the streptogramin derivatives of general formula (I) may be converted to the state of addition salts with acids, by known methods. It is understood that these salts, when they exist, are also included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
As examples of addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids, there may be mentioned the salts formed with inorganic acids (hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, nitrates, phosphates) or with organic acids (succinates, fumarates, tartrates, acetates, propionates, maleates, citrates, methanesulfonates, ethanesulfonates, phenyl-sulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates, isethionates, naphthylsulfonates or camphor-sulfonates, or with substitution derivatives of these compounds).<br>
The streptogramin derivatives according to the present invention have antibacterial properties and properties synergizing the antibacterial activity of the group B streptogramin derivatives. They are particularly advantageous because of their potent activity, alone or combined.<br>
When they are combined with a component or a derivative of the group B streptogramins, they may be chosen, depending on whether it is desired to obtain an orally or parenterally administrable form, from the natural components: pristinamycin IA, pristinamycin IB, pristinamycin Ic, pristinamycin ID, pristinamycin IE, pristinamycin IF, pristinamycin IG, virginiamycin S1,S3 or S4, vemamycin B or C,<br>
etamycin or from the semisynthetic derivatives as described in patents or patent applications US 4,618,599, US 4,798,827, US 5,326,782, EP 772630 or EP 770132, in particular the streptogramin derivatives of general formula:<br>

After stirring for 24 hours, the reaction mixture is concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure (2.7 kPa) to give a residue which is taken up in 110 cm3 of ethyl acetate and 55 cm3 of distilled water. The organic phase is decanted off, washed successively with twice 55  cm3 of distilled water,  55 cm    of a 0.1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid solution, twice 55 cm3 of distilled water and twice 55 cm3 of a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. After drying over magnesium sulfate and filtration,  the organic phase  is  concentrated to  dryness under reduced pressure (2.7 kPa). 0.95 g of a residue is obtained, which residue is dissolved in 100 cm3 of dichloromethane and extracted with 100 cm3 of a 1% aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. The emulsion obtained is supplemented with 500 cm3 of ethyl acetate to allow decantation. The aqueous phase is then separated, washed again with three times 100 cm3 of ethyl acetate, acidified with a 1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid solution until a pH of close to 2 is obtained and then extracted three times with dichloromethane (200, 100 and 100 cm3).
