The invention relates to a false twist texturing machine for false twist texturing a plurality of synthetic yarns<br>
A false twist texturing machine of this type is known from EP 0 641 877.<br>
Such false twist texturing machines comprise a plurality of processing stations, which are arranged in side-by-side relationship along the longitudinal side of the machine.  Each of the processing stations includes a plurality of feed roll systems as well as a primary heater, a cooling device, a false twist unit, a secondary heater, and a takeup device.  Basically, a difference is made between two types of false twist texturing machines.  In a first variant of false twist texturing machines, on which the invention is based, the packages wound in the takeup device are automatically doffed and automatically removed by doffers.  To this end, the false twist texturing machine as disclosed in EP 0 641 877 includes a separate doffing aisle, which permits removing the fully wound packages.  The doffing aisle extends along a takeup module, which accommodates the takeup devices. For operating the processing units in the false twist texturing machine, a separate servicing -aisle is provided, which extends along a processing module.<br>
In a second type of false twist texturing machines, the packages wound in the takeup device are<br><br>
manually doffed.  False twist texturing machines of this type as disclosed, for example, in EP 0 659 913 comprise a single servicing aisle for purposes of enabling both the package doff and the operation of the processing units by one  operator.  For this reason, false twist texturing machines of this type are totally unsuited for enabling an automatic removal of the wound packages.<br>
When realizing both a servicing aisle and a doffing aisle, the processing units of the basic type of false twist texturing machines are arranged in such a manner that the yarn traverses the servicing aisle several times, which leads to a plurality of yarn deflections.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to further develop the false twist texturing machine of the basic type in such a manner that a shortest possible yarn path results with the least possible yarn deflections.<br>
In accordance with the invention, this object is accomplished in that the processing nodule and the takeup module are joined to a frame section arranged between the servicing aisle and the doffing aisle, and that the passage of the yarn from the processing module to the takeup module is formed by a horizontally oriented secondary heater, so that the yam advances in the frame section between the false twist unit and the takeup device along a substantially U-shaped path.<br>
On the one hand, the invention distinguishes itself by a very compact construction and on the other hand by a very stable threadlike.  The passage of the yarn between the processing module and the takeup module is used as a set zone, in which the heat treatment of the yarn occurs by the means of the<br><br>
secondary heater.  As a result, additional yarn<br>
deflections can advantageously be  avoided.<br>
A preferred further development of the<br>
invention has the advantage that it prevents a crossing yarn path in the false twist<br>
texturing machine.  To this end, the processing module<br>
is associated on the opposite side of the servicing aisle with a feed module for accommodating a withdrawal roll system.  The passage of the yarn from the feed module to the processing module is formed by the primary heater and the cooling device, which are arranged above the servicing aisle in such a manner that the yarn advances from the withdrawal roll system to the false twist unit along a substantially v-shaped path,  with the compact construction of the modules, it is possible to realize a very long false twist zone for tempering and subsequently cooling the yam.<br>
During the heat after treatment in the set zone, the yarn advances under very little tension, so as to enable a shrinkage treatment of the yarn in the set zone.  However, this makes it necessary that the guidance of the yarn ensure a uniform tempering of the yam within the secondary heater.  In this connection, it has been found that the use of a contact heater is possible, in particular as a result of the further<br>
development of the invention .   To   this end, the secondary heater is placed on the  underside of the<br>
frame section, so that after passim through the processing module, the yam can be  transferred directly to the<br>
; takeup module.<br>
With the use of a contact heater, the secondary heater is arranged with an inclination, preferably in an angular range from 5°  to 45°.<br><br>
To avoid additional yarn guide elements, the processing module mounts one of the feed roll systems between the false twist unit and the secondary heater in such a manner that the yam outlet of the feed roll system and the yarn inlet on the secondary heater are aligned with each other in facing relationship.<br>
Accordingly, a further feed roll system is arranged on the takeup module below the takeup device in such a manner that the yarn inlet of the feed roll system and the yarn outlet of the secondary heater are aligned in facing relationship.<br>
In this arrangement, the yarn deflection is realized in an advantageous manner by a feed roll system, which is formed by a gadget that is looped by the yarn several times, and with a yarn guide roll associated therewith.  In this connection, the yarn inlet on the secondary heater and the yarn outlet on the secondary heater are each arranged in tangential relationship with the godets of the feed roll systems. There are no yarn guide elements between the feed roll systems and the secondary heater.<br>
To ensure an easy operability despite the high integration of the modules, in particular when threading the yarn, the further development of the invention is especially advantageous,  in this further development, a heating channel of the secondary heater connects to an  injector, which permits an automatic thread up of the yarn  through the heating channel.  For a further automation, it is also proposed to associate a further  injector of a threading device with the yarn outlet of  the secondary heater, with the threading device guiding the yarn as far as the takeup device.<br><br>
To enable in the false twist zone an unimpeded return of the false twist into the primary heater, an advantageous further development of the invention provides that the primary heater and the cooling are arranged in one plane above the servicing aisle.  With that, it is possible to realize intensive crimps in the yarn.<br>
In the cases, which do not require a heat after treatment of the yarn, it would be possible, for purposes of maintaining the yarn path, to replace the secondary heater with a guide tube of the threading device, as is provided fay an advantageous further development<br>
In the following, the invention is described in greater detail with reference to an embodiment and with reference to the attached drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic view of an embodiment of the false twist texturing machine according to the invention; and<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic view of a cutout of a further embodiment of a false twist texturing machine according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 schematically illustrates a first embodiment of a false twist texturing machine according to the invention.  The false twist texturing machine comprises a feed module 3, a processing module 2, and a takeup module 1, which are arranged in a machine frame with frame sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3.  The feed module 3 is supported by  frame section 4.1, and the processing module 2 and takeup module 1 by frame section 4.3.  The frame section 4.1 and the frame section 4,3 are interconnected by frame section 4.2, which is arranged above feed module 3 and processing module 2.  Between<br><br>
the processing module 2 and feed module 3, a servicing aisle 5 is formed below frame section 4.2.<br>
In the frame section 4.2, the processing module 2 is arranged on the side facing servicing aisle 5, and the takeup module 1 on the side opposite thereto.  Along the takeup module 1, a doffing aisle 6 is provided.  Associated with doffing aisle 6 is a second takeup module 1 of a second false twist texturing machine, which is arranged in mirror-symmetry with the first false twist texturing machine.  This arrangement makes it possible to transfer packages from two machines to one removal device and to transport them away through the doffing aisle.<br>
In its longitudinal direction -- in Figure 1, the plane of the drawing corresponds to the transverse plane -- the false twist texturing machine comprises a plurality of processing stations for one yarn per processing station.  The takeup devices 18 occupy a width of three processing stations.  For this reason --as will be dealt with further below — three takeup devices IS are each arranged one on top of the other in a column in takeup module 1.<br>
Each processing station includes a withdrawal roll system 10, which is mounted on feed module 3. Associated with the withdrawal roll systems 10 of adjacent processing stations is a creel 7, which accommodates a plurality of feed yarn packages 8 for withdrawing yarns 36.  One feed yarn package 8 is associated with each withdrawal roll system 10.  The yarn 36 is withdrawn by withdrawal roll system 10 via a plurality of yarn deflection guides 9.<br>
With reference to the advance of yarn 36, the further units of a processing station are now being described,  in the direction of the advancing yam<br><br>
downstream of withdrawal roll system 10, an elongate primary heater 11 extends, through which yarn 36 advances and, in so doing, is heated to a certain temperature.  The primary heater 11 could be constructed as a high-temperature heater, in which the heating surface temperature is above 300°C.<br>
In the direction of the advancing yarn downstream of primary heater 11, a cooling device 12 is provided.  The primary heater 11 and cooling device 12 are successively arranged in one plane, and supported by frame section 4.2 above servicing aisle S.  In the inlet region, of primary heater 11, a deflection roll 9.3 is arranged, so that the yarn 36 crosses servicing aisle 5 along a V-shaped path.<br>
On the side of servicing aisle 5 opposite to feed module 3, the frame section 4.3 mounts processing module 2.  In the direction of the advancing yarn, the processing module 2 accommodates, one below the other, a false twist unit 13, a draw roll system 14, and a set roll system 15.  The yarn 36 advances from the outlet end of cooling device 12, which is preferably formed by a cooling rail, to false twist unit 13.  The false twist unit 13, which may be formed, for example, by a plurality of overlapping friction disks, is driven by a drive 26.     Preferably, an electric motor is used as false twist drive 26, which is also arranged on processing module 2.<br>
The draw roll system 14 withdraws the yarn 36 from the false twist zone, which forms between the false twist unit 13 and withdrawal roll system 10.  The draw roll system 14 and withdrawal roll system 10 are driven at a differential speed for drawing the yarn 36 in the false twist zone.<br><br>
Arranged downstream of draw roll system 14 is set roll system 15,   which  guides the yarn 36  directly into a secondary heater 16.  To this end, the secondary heater 16 is arranged on the underside of frame section 4.3 and thus below processing module 2 and takeup module 1.  The secondary heater 16 forms the yarn passageway from processing module 2 to takeup module 1. As a result of integrating processing module 2, secondary heater 16, and takeup module 1 in frame section 4.3, a very short yarn path is realized, which is substantially U-shaped,  To this end, the underside of takeup module 1 mounts a feed roll system 17, which withdraws yarn 36 from secondary heater 16, and guides the yam 36 after deflecting it to a takeup device 18. The set roll system 15 and feed roll system 17 are driven at such a differential speed as to enable a shrinkage treatment of yam 3€  within secondary heater 16.  In this case, the secondary heater 16 is formed by a biphenyl-heated contact heater. To  this  end, the secondary heater 16 is inclined relative to the horizontal by an angle a.  The angle a  ranges from 5° to 45°.  This ensures that within a heating channel of secondary heater 16, the yarn 36 is imparted a uniform heating that is effected by contact.<br>
In the present embodiment, the takeup device 18 is schematically indicated by a yarn traversing device 20, a drive roll 19, and a package 21.  In addition, the takeup device 18 includes a tube magazine 22 for performing an automatic package doff.  Auxiliary devices that are needed for doffing the full packages are not shown in greater detail.<br>
In their construction, the feed roll systems 10, 14, 15, and 17 are identical, so that in the following their construction is described in greater<br><br>
detail with reference to the example of withdrawal roll system 10.  Each feed roll system is formed by a godet 23 and a guide roll 24 associated therewith.  The godet 23 is driven via a godet drive 25.  Preferably, the godet drive 25 is an electric motor.  The guide roll 24 is supported for free rotation, with the yarn 36 being guided over godet 23 and guide roll 24 by looping thereabout several times.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic cutout view of a further embodiment of a false twist texturing machine. The cutout shows the yarn passage from processing module 3 to takeup module 1, as could be integrated, for example, in the machine shown in Figure 1.<br>
In this embodiment, a heating channel 27 of the secondary heater 16 connects to an injector 28-The injector 28 is attached to a guide tube 29, which forms a yarn outlet 31 of secondary heater 16. Opposite to yarn outlet 31 is feed roll system 17. After exiting from outlet 31, the yarn is tangent to godet 23.4.<br>
A yarn inlet 30 of secondary heater 16 is arranged in alignment with the path of the yam leaving godet 23.3 of set roll system 15.  Thus, the guidance of yarn 36 is foirmed directly upstream of secondary heater 16 by set roll system 15 and directly downstream of the secondary heater by feed roll system 17.<br>
On tBkeup module 1,   a  threading device 33 is provided, which includes at least one guide tube 35 and an injector 34.  The inlet of guide tube 35 is associated with the yarn outlet 31 of secondary heater 16.  The opposite outlet of guide tube 35 faces the takeup device 18, with the injector 34 generating a suction  effect at the yam inlet of guide tube 35, and a blowing effect at the yarn outlet of guide tube 35.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows the false twist texturing machine in its operating state, wherein the yarn 36 advances after looping several times about set roll system 15, through secondary heater 16, and is subsequently guided to takeup device 18 by means of feed roll system 17 after looping thereabout several times.  In the takeup device, the yarn 36 is wound to a package 31.<br>
For threading the yarn, the injector 28 is activated, so that a suction effect is generated at the yarn inlet of secondary heater 16, and a blowing effect at the end of guide tube 29. Likewise activated is the injector 34 of threading device 33.  Between the yarn outlet 31 of secondary heater 16 and the yarn inlet of guide tube 3S, a deflection plate 32 is arranged.  For threading the yarn 36, same is guided with the use of a catching gun and cut directly upstream of yarn inlet 30 of secondary heater 16.  In this process, the yarn 36 is taken by the suction effect into the heating channel 27 of secondary heater 16 and blown out from yarn exit 31 at the opposite end. in so doing/ the feed roll system 17 is first bypassed, in that the loose yarn end is guided toward deflection plate 32 and received by the yarn inlet of guide tube 35.  As soon as the yarn is guided in guide tube 35, it is threaded on feed roll system 17.  For threading the yarn 36 in takeup device 18, the yarn is ejected from the outlet end of guide tube 35, and received and caught by an auxiliary device not shown, so that the yarn can be wound.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figure 2 ensures the serviceability of secondary heater 16 even despite its nested type of construction in a machine frame.<br>
The embodiments shown in Figures 1 and 2 are exemplary for the construction of the individual<br><br>
processing units.  Basically, it is possible to replace individually driven godets with nip-type feed roll systems with a common drive.  Essential is the arrangement of the units in the false twist texturing machine with automatic package doffs, so that a shortest possible yarn path and a very compact construction are realized for forming a servicing aisle and a doffing aisle of the type in accordance with the invention.  From its unwinding in the creel to its winding, the yarn is guided without crossing its path.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
