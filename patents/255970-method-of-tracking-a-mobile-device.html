SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the invention is to provide a method for preventing a mobile device from getting misplaced or stolen.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a system for preventing a mobile device from getting misplaced or stolen.<br>
Accordingly the invention explains a method of tracking a misplaced or stolen mobile device and alerting the user comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	mapping a sensor to a mobile device;<br>
(b)	assigning a range by the user in which the sensor can send and receive signals from the mobile device; and<br>
(c)	generating warning signals by both the mobile device and sensor when the mobile device goes out of the user defined range of the sensor,<br><br>
where the mobile device and the sensor can communicate through Bluetooth or UPnP technology.<br>
If the mobile device is within the range as specified by the user the mobile device receives DISCOVERY/SEARCH request from the sensor which broadcasts the said request at every time interval N1. For every DISCOVERY/SEARCH request received by the mobile device from the sensor a response Message is send by the mobile to the sensor if the mobile is in the user specified range. When the mobile device moves out of the user specified range, sensor which is repeating its DISCOVERY Message's every time interval N1, FAILS to get a response and intimates the failure to receive the request to the user by a warning signal. If the mobile device goes out of the user defined range of the sensor, both the mobile device and sensor start generating warning sounds. If the mobile device is a camera phone and the said mobile device goes out of the user defined range of the sensor, the mobile device takes and mails pictures of the environment to a configured contact. If the mobile device is a GPRS enabled phone and the said mobile device goes out of the user defined range of the sensor, the mobile device starts mailing positional details through GPRS to a configured contact. If the mobile device goes out of the user defined range of the sensor, the mobile device starts calling a predefined number. If the mobile device goes out of the user defined range of the sensor, the mobile device disable a user from calling, messaging or switching off the mobile device.<br><br>
If the mobile device goes out of the user defined range of the sensor, the mobile device emits current pulse of low magnitude after waiting for a certain time Interval T. The generated warning signals by the mobile device and sensor if the mobile device goes out of the user defined range is a sound beep, sound alarm, vibration , a phone call or a message. The features of the generated warning signals can be pre configured by the user. The process of mapping a sensor to a mobile device involves associating IMEI number of each mobile to the sensor. If the mobile is UPnP enabled the existence of the said mobile is indicated to a monitoring device if the mobile device goes out of the user defined range.<br>
Accordingly, the invention further explains a system of tracking a misplaced or stolen mobile device and alerting the user comprising:<br>
(a)	a sensor to which a mobile device device is mapped; and<br>
(b)	means for generating warning signals when the mobile device goes out of the user defined range of the sensor,<br>
where the mobile device and the sensor can communicate through Bluetooth or UPnP technology. The means for generating warning signal exist for both the mobile device and sensor.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention relates to the field of mobile device security and vigilance application. The invention discloses a method and a system for preventing a mobile device from getting misplaced or stolen. According to the invention, a sensor is mapped to a mobile device. The owner of the mobile device can assign<br><br>
a range in which the sensor can send and receive signals from the mobile device. Additionally, the mobile device and the sensor can communicate through Bluetooth or UPnP technology. As soon as the mobile device goes out of the user defined range of the sensor, both the mobile device and sensor start generating warning sounds. In addition to creating a warning sound the mobile device can perform various other functions like start mailing the pictures of the environment (if it is a camera phone), start mailing positional details through GPRS, start calling a predefined number, and disabling a user from calling, messaging or switching off the mobile device.<br>
Figure 1 shows the scenario of the implementation of the present invention. Figure 1 shows a sensor (CRMS) and a mobile device, which is shown out of CRMS vicinity. The CRMS Vicinity is configured by assigning a range by the user in which the sensor can send and receive signals from the mobile device.CRMS looses track of the Mobile device when it crosses CRMS's vicinity. When the Mobile Device is outside the CRMS Vicinity, the mobile device emits current pulse of low magnitude after waiting for a certain time Interval (N2Figure 2 shows a flow diagram of the present implementation . When the mobile device is within the range as specified by the user the mobile device receives DISCOVERY/SEARCH request from the sensor which broadcasts the said request at every time interval N1. The time Interval N1 shown here is 20 or 30Sec. This is user configurable and can vary. For every DISCOVERY/SEARCH request received by the mobile device from the sensor a response Message is<br><br>
send by the mobile to the sensor if the mobile is in the user specified range. When the mobile device moves out of the user specified range, sensor which is repeating its DISCOVERY Message's every time interval N1, FAILS to get a response and intimates the failure to receive the request to the user by a warning signal. If the mobile device goes out of the user defined range of the sensor, both the mobile device and sensor start generating warning sounds after waiting for a time interval N2. The Discover request / Message is send with the "IMEI" of the mobile device as the search parameter.<br>
This invention is an idea towards helping the users of mobile devices in a way such that they can avoid their devices being stolen or accidentally misplaced. Currently there are emerging technologies wherein a mobile can be traced after it has been misplaced/stolen but at the cost of the device being mishandled/damaged. Hence this invention aims at a solution to avoid such misplacing /stealing of a mobile device by extending or making use of the prior work carried out in this area. Initially the user of the mobile device configures a vicinity area for the CRMS to keep vigil of his/her mobile device. When the mobile device is within this vicinity it receives DISCOVERY/SEARCH request from the CRMS (which broadcasts this message for every time interval N1) and accordingly sends a response Message to the CRMS. In this way both of the devices know that they exist within that particular vicinity. When the mobile device moves out of the vicinity, CRMS which is repeating its DISCOVERY Message's every time interval N1, FAILS to get a response and thus intimates this to the user by a beep or an alarm.<br><br>
A Configurable Remote mobile sensor will be based on Bluetooth technology (also can be based on the UPnP Discovery Technology) The mobile device and the CRMS will each have Bluetooth stack with the device discovery profile embedded in them where in both the stacks will be exchanging information of their availability within a user specified distance (delta).When the distance between the CRMS and the mobile device becomes more than the configured distance value, then the CRMS starts to beep so as to alert the user that he/she is moving away from the vicinity of his/her mobile device thereby avoiding the mobile device being misplaced.<br>
CRMS is unique to each mobile device and mapped to its IMEI number. A user will configure his CRMS depending on the sensors capability and his vicinity needs.<br>
The time intervals N1 and N2 are configurable by the user. After the above indication happens the following are a sequential steps of actions, which will occur, on the mobile device (Intelligent Application - termed as IAPP) within the device.<br>
1. After the mobile device looses track of the CRMS, the lApp after waiting for a certain time Interval T(pre - configured by user), starts emitting current pulse around its body. To perform this feature IAPP makes use of the<br><br>
circuitry available in the device and generates a small current pulses of low magnitude.<br>
2.	Following the clause 1 the mobile device starts of an alarm (with a pre-configured tone) by itself with volume at the initial level and keeps incrementing towards the maximum level after every interval 'S'(pre -configured by user).For this feature to be executed the lAPP will interact with the audio device driver in the mobile to perform an incremental step of the volume for a particular tone.<br>
3.	IAPP blocks/disables all Mobile operations and applications. Eg. Dialing of a number /sending SMS etc .For this to be done the IAPP makes use of the application handlers existing in the mobile device.<br>
4.	Switching off the device is disabled. The IAPP will disable the switch off mode of the mobile.<br>
5.	In case of any operation performed (In case 3 fails to cover all applications) on the device will direct a call to an "Emergency number"(pre configured by the user) and the connection stays connected without being disconnected from the mobile device end. This feature can be implemented by using a concept of auto dial (on a specific number) based on a trigger or event on the mobile (eg. Dialing a number/sending SMS).<br><br>
6.	If it's a camera enabled mobile device, lAPP captures pictures of its existent environment and emails it to the owner's email (pre-configured by the owner), for every time duration't'(pre - configured by user). For this the lAPP makes use of the image capture software available in the mobile device, captures the image and using an appropriate transfer protocol (like http) emails it to the user.<br>
7.	If not a camera enabled device, Through the GPRS provision the lAPP reads the information of the device's existence and email's to the owner via his email - id (pre-configured by the owner).A mail is triggered every time when the mobile device's GPRS position changes.For this feature the lAPP will make use of the location based service interfaces provided by GPRS.<br>
8.	If the mobile is a UPnP enabled (Control point) device, it starts intelligently searching for helpful devices based on the services exposed by the device or its embedded devices, such that the mobile device making use of these services will inform the owner of its immediate existence. These devices can be a<br>
8.1 Monitor device - will make use of its monitoring capability and inform the user. In this case the discovery of the monitor device will be done by the UPnP protocol but the lAPP will provide a feature to transfer the images around the mobile vicinity, to the owner.<br><br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br>
