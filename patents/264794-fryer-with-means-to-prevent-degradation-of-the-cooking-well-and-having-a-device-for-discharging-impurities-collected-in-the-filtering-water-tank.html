FRYER<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a fryer capable of<br>
automatically removing deep-fried batter balls and<br>
automatically cleaning cooking oil to keep the cooking oil<br>
clean, prevent its degradation and thereby extend its useful<br>
life.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Some conventional fryers have water and cooking oil<br>
stored in a fryer tank in two layers in contact with each<br>
other at their boundary, with the water lying at the bottom<br>
of the fryer tank and with a heater installed in the oil<br>
layer to heat the oil to a predetermined temperature (patent<br>
documents 1-3).<br>
In such fryers, during the frying process, minute batter<br>
balls dispersing from food ingredients into the cooking oil,<br>
colloidal materials drifting away from the food being fried,<br>
and water flowing out of the food material (these are<br>
hereinafter referred to as impurities) are allowed to sink<br>
freely to the bottom of the fryer tank so as to minimize<br>
- 1 -<br><br>
degradation and darkening of oil caused by these impurities.<br>
[0003]<br>
In other types of fryers, an impurity removing device is<br>
provided separate from the fryer and installed in the fryer<br>
tank, which has an oil layer and a water layer, to remove<br>
impurities such as deep-fried batter balls from the cooking<br>
oil by circulating with a pump the oil between the fryer and<br>
the impurity removing device (patent document 4).<br>

[0005]<br>
[Problems with Conventional Fryer]<br>
In such a conventional fryer, to prevent a temperature of<br>
the cooking oil from falling during cooking and to enable it<br>
to return to the set temperature in a short time, the heater<br>
disposed in the oil layer is operated at a temperature higher<br>
than the cooking temperature of the oil. The oil in contact<br>
with the surface of the heater in particular is exposed to a<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
far higher temperature than the set temperature.<br>
Further, since a temperature band of the cooking oil for<br>
frying coincides with a temperature band that accelerates<br>
degradation and oxidation of the oil, the cooking oil gets<br>
easily degraded or oxidized during standby or during cooking.<br>
This in turn increases generation of smoke and evaporation,<br>
polluting the environment and rapidly changing the<br>
composition of the cooking oil.<br>
[0006]<br>
Thus, there has been a demand for a device that, during<br>
standby, can keep the cooking oil at a somewhat lower<br>
temperature than that for cooking and, during cooking,<br>
quickly raise the oil temperature to the cooking temperature<br>
to make it ready for cooking and thereby minimize a quality<br>
degradation of the cooking oil.<br>
[0007]<br>
In such a conventional fryer, if any bubble exists in an<br>
oil or water layer and comes into contact with the heated oil,<br>
the air bubble will expand explosively, scattering the hot<br>
oil.<br>
Thus the bubble in the water or oil layer needs to be<br>
eliminated. However, no such device capable of eliminating<br>
air bubbles has been available and a fryer with such a<br>
function has been called for.<br>
[0008]<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
Furthermore, in such a conventional fryer, to remove<br>
impurities accumulated in the water layer, it is necessary to<br>
open a cock provided below the water layer to drain the water<br>
and then fill clean water into the water layer, refreshing<br>
the water layer with a predetermined amount of clean water.<br>
Further, in the case of a fryer equipped with a filtering<br>
water tank in addition to the fryer tank and using a<br>
circulation filtering method, to remove impurities<br>
accumulated in the filtering water tank requires manually<br>
removing the impurities and cleaning the filtering water tank<br>
while not cooking. This takes time, prolonging the cooking<br>
interruption time, resulting in a reduced cooking efficiency.<br>
For this reason, there has been a call for a fryer with<br>
the filtering water tank that allows easy removal of<br>
impurities in the filtering water tank.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
[0009]<br>
The present invention has been accomplished with a view<br>
to overcoming the problems experienced with the conventional<br>
technologies. A technical task to be achieved in solving the<br>
above-mentioned problems is to provide a fryer that can<br>
easily perform a cooking oil heat exchange so as to keep the<br>
temperature of a cooking oil slightly lower than a cooking<br>
temperature during standby and which, during cooking, can<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
quickly raise the oil temperature to the cooking temperature,<br>
thereby preventing degradation of the cooking oil, securing a<br>
good culinary environment, enhancing a work efficiency,<br>
reducing an economic burden, and minimizing environmental<br>
pollutions.<br>
It is also our technical task to provide a fryer with a<br>
function of eliminating bubbles in water or oil.<br>
Another technical task is to provide a fryer with a<br>
filtering water tank which can easily remove impurities in<br>
the filtering water tank.<br>
[0010]<br>
The present invention has many aspects for effectively<br>
solving the problems experienced with the conventional<br>
technologies.<br>
Viewed from a first aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a fryer comprising: a fryer tank having oil for<br>
cooking and water for purifying the oil, the oil and the<br>
water being vertically arranged in two layers one upon the<br>
other; and a heater disposed in the oil layer; wherein a<br>
water layer in the fryer tank or a part of an oil layer<br>
beneath the heater is horizontally rotated in a swirl.<br>

delivered into the fryer tank almost horizontally in an off-<br>
centered direction from a water supply opening formed in a<br>
side wall of the fryer tank and opening to the water layer or<br>
to a part of the oil layer beneath the heater, thus rotating<br>
the water layer in the fryer tank or the part of the oil<br>
layer beneath the heater in a swirl.<br>
[0013]<br>
A fourth aspect of the present invention provides a fryer,<br>
wherein water in the water layer is drawn into a water-<br>

[0014]<br>
A fifth aspect of the present invention provides a fryer,<br>
wherein oil in the oil layer is drawn out of the fryer tank<br>
by an oil pump installed outside the fryer tank and then<br>
delivered into the fryer tank almost horizontally in an off-<br>
centered direction from an oil supply opening formed in a<br>
side wall of the fryer tank and opening to the water layer or<br>
to a part of the oil layer beneath the heater, thus rotating<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
the water layer or the part of the oil layer beneath the<br>
heater in a swirl.<br>
[0015]<br>
A sixth aspect of the present invention provides a fryer,<br>
wherein oil in the oil layer is drawn into an oil-immersed<br>
pump installed near a side wall of the fryer tank beneath the<br>
heater and delivered from the pump almost horizontally to<br>
rotate the oil layer in a swirl.<br>
[0016]<br>
A seventh aspect of the present invention provides a<br>
fryer, further including a filtering water tank installed<br>
close to the fryer tank and having a filter; wherein water in<br>
the water layer mixed with impurities, such as deep-fried<br>
batter balls, is drawn out from a water suction opening at a<br>
bottom of the fryer tank and then delivered into the<br>
filtering water tank where the impurities, such as deep-fried<br>
batter balls, are filtered out and allowed to settle on a<br>
bottom of the filtering water tank; wherein the filtered<br>
water is delivered into the fryer tank almost horizontally<br>
along a side wall of the fryer tank from a water supply<br>
opening formed in the side wall of the fryer tank and opening<br>
to the water layer or to a part of the oil layer beneath the<br>
heater.<br>
[0017]<br>
An eighth aspect of the present invention provides a<br>
- 7 -<br><br>
fryer, further including a bubble elimination tank installed<br>
in a water path running from the filtering water tank to the<br>
water layer or oil layer; wherein the bubble elimination tank<br>
separates water and air by accommodating water and<br>
accumulating it in a lower part thereof and air in an upper<br>
part thereof; wherein the bubble elimination tank has an<br>
inner pressure adjusting means at an upper end portion<br>
thereof to vent the air accumulated in the upper part of the<br>

[0018]<br>
A ninth aspect of the present invention provides a fryer,<br>
further including: an oil pump to draw oil from the oil layer<br>
and deliver it into the water layer or a part of the oil<br>
layer beneath the heater; a gas accumulator formed above the<br>
oil pump to hold a vaporized gas accumulated in the oil pump;<br>
and a pressure adjusting exhaust means to vent the vaporized<br>
gas from the gas accumulator to the outside.<br>
[0019]<br>
A tenth aspect of the present invention provides a fryer<br>
comprising: a fryer tank to store an oil layer for cooking<br>
and a water layer into which impurities such as deep-fried<br>
batter balls in the oil layer sink, the oil layer and the<br>
water layer being vertically arranged in two layers one upon<br>
the other; a heater installed in the oil layer; and a<br>
filtering water tank to receive water from the water layer,<br>
- 8 -<br><br>
filter out impurities mixed in the water by a filter and<br>
return the filtered water to the fryer tank; wherein the<br>
filtering water tank has an impurity removing device that is<br>
connected with a water discharge path and a water supply<br>
path; wherein the water discharge path has a stop valve and<br>
discharges the water mixed with the impurities from an<br>
untreated water reservoir upstream of the filter to the<br>
outside of the filtering water tank; wherein the water supply<br>
path has a flow regulator and, during a water discharging<br>
operation, supplies water to the untreated water reservoir<br>
upstream of the filter or to a clean water reservoir<br>
downstream of the filter.<br>
[0020]<br>
An eleventh aspect of the present invention provides a<br>
fryer, wherein the impurity removing device has connected to<br>
a bottom of the filtering water tank the water discharge path<br>
that discharges water containing impurities from the<br>
untreated water reservoir upstream of the filter to the<br>
outside of the filtering water tank.<br>
[0021]<br>
A twelfth aspect of the present invention provides a<br>
fryer, wherein the impurity removing device has an impurity<br>
collecting container that accommodates impurity-laden water,<br>
discharged from the discharge opening of the water discharge<br>
path, through a net basket formed of a filtering material<br><br>
having almost the same mesh size as the filter of the<br>
filtering water tank.<br>
[0022]<br>
A thirteenth aspect of the present invention provides an<br>
impurity removing method for a fryer, comprising the steps<br>
of: storing cooking oil and water in two layers one upon the<br>
other, the water being adapted to receive impurities sinking<br>
from the oil into it; filtering out impurities contained in<br>
water drawn from a water layer in a fryer tank into a<br>
filtering water tank; and returning the filtered water to the<br>
fryer tank; wherein, after stopping a circulation of the<br>
filtered water between the fryer tank and the filtering water<br>
tank, a water discharge path connected to an untreated water<br>
reservoir upstream of the filter in the filtering water tank<br>
and a water supply path connected to the untreated water<br>
reservoir upstream of the filter or a clean water reservoir<br>
downstream of the filter are opened to discharge impurities<br>
from the filtering water tank through the water discharge<br>
path, along with running water from the water supply path.<br>
[0023]<br>
In the first aspect, the water layer in the fryer tank or<br>
a part of the oil layer beneath the heater is horizontally<br>
rotated in a swirl to cause the whole oil layer to rotate<br>
horizontally by its viscosity, increasing the contact between<br>
the oil and the heater disposed in the oil layer and<br>
- 10 -<br><br>
therefore the volume of heat exchanged.<br>
During a standby, it is possible to keep the cooking oil<br>
at a low temperature at which the oil is not easily<br>
deteriorated. During cooking, the part of the oil layer<br>
situated above the heater can be quickly raised to the<br>
cooking temperature, thus shortening the time it takes to<br>
return the oil temperature to the cooking temperature and<br>
effectively preventing oil degradations.<br>
[0024]<br>
At the boundary between oil and water, the oil is stirred<br>
by the water causing minute impurities mixed in the oil, such<br>
as deep-fried batter balls, to fall into the water, thus<br>
clearing the oil of impurities. In this way, impurities<br>
contained in the oil, such as liquids and smell components<br>
coming out of food materials, can be removed from the oil<br>
layer.<br>
[0025]<br>
With the second aspect, it is possible to prevent an<br>
overflow of cooking oil that would otherwise be caused by<br>
water from food materials or melted water from frozen food<br>
raising the volume and level of water. It is also possible<br>
to monitor an appropriate water level for frying at all times.<br>
The second aspect therefore enables the water level to be<br>
kept within an appropriate, allowable range.<br>
[0026]<br>
- 11 -<br><br>
With the third to sixth aspect, the effect described in<br>
the first aspect can be reliably achieved by rotating the<br>
water layer or a part of the oil layer beneath the heater in<br>
a large swirl to directly or indirectly rotate the oil layer.<br>
[0027]<br>
With the seventh aspect, the filtering water tank filters<br>
out impurities contained in water of the water layer and<br>
returns the filtered water through the filtered water path to<br>
the water layer in the fryer tank, thus circulating the water<br>
between the water layer in the fryer tank and the filtering<br>
water tank, which in turn keeps the water in the fryer tank<br>
clean at all times.<br>
The seventh aspect, therefore, can more advantageously<br>
realize the effect described in the first aspect.<br>
[0028]<br>
With the eighth aspect, the bubble elimination tank<br>
separates water and air. When the pressure of the air<br>
accumulated in the upper part of the bubble elimination tank<br>
exceeds a predetermined pressure, it can be vented through<br>
the inner pressure adjusting means incorporating a pressure<br>
adjust valve. Thus the water in the fryer tank can be<br>
cleared of bubble at all times.<br>
This in turn prevents an accident of bubble explosion<br>
that would occur when the bubble comes into contact with hot<br>
oil during cooking, thus securing safety and preventing<br>
- 12 -<br><br>
possible environmental contamination.<br>
[0029]<br>
With the ninth aspect, vaporized gas accumulated in the<br>
upper part of the oil pump in an oil circulation path -- that<br>
draws oil by suction from the fryer tank and, after the oil<br>
temperature is lowered, returns it to the fryer tank - can be<br>
vented through the gas accumulator. When the gas pressure<br>
exceeds a predetermined pressure, it can be vented through<br>
the pressure adjusting exhaust means incorporating a pressure<br>
adjust valve. This in turn prevents an accident of bubble<br>
explosion that would occur when the bubble comes into contact<br>
with hot oil, thus securing safety and preventing possible<br>
environmental contamination.<br>
[0030]<br>
The impurity removing device as the tenth aspect of this<br>
invention stops water circulation between the water layer in<br>
the fryer tank and the filtering water tank, as required,<br>
supplies water from the water supply path to the untreated<br>
water reservoir upstream of the filter in the filtering water<br>
tank or to the clean water reservoir downstream of the filter,<br>
and discharges water from the untreated water reservoir<br>
upstream of the filter in the filtering water tank through<br>
the water discharge path to the outside. This causes<br>
impurities accumulated in the filtering water tank, such as<br>
deep-fried batter balls, to be washed away to the outside,<br>
- 13 -<br><br>
realizing the impurity removal and the washing of the<br>
filtering water tank without removing the filtering water<br>
tank.<br>
At this time, when water is supplied from the water<br>
supply path to the clean water reservoir downstream of the<br>
filter, impurities clogging the filter, such as deep-fried<br>
batter balls, can be washed away along with impurities<br>
accumulated upstream of the filter.<br>
[0031]<br>
In the eleventh aspect, the impurity removing device has<br>
connected to a bottom of the filtering water tank the water<br>
discharge path that discharges impurity-laden water from the<br>
upstream side of the filter to the outside of the filtering<br>
water tank. This allows impurities in the filtering water<br>
tank to be discharged from the water discharge path to the<br>
outside, thus realizing the removal of impurities and the<br>
washing of the filtering water tank without removing the<br>
filtering water tank.<br>
[0032]<br>
In the twelfth aspect, as a container to receive<br>
impurity-laden water discharged from the filtering water tank,<br>
an impurity collecting container is provided which has a net<br>
basket formed of a filtering material having almost the same<br>
mesh size as the filter of the filtering water tank. The net<br>
basket traps and separates impurities, such as deep-fried<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
batter balls, from water. Thus, the impurities can be<br>
discarded as raw combustible waste and water as effluent.<br>
[0033]<br>
The thirteenth aspect provides the impurity removing<br>
method, which, after stopping a circulation of the filtered<br>
water between the fryer tank and the filtering water tank,<br>
opens the water discharge path connected to the untreated<br>
water reservoir upstream of the filter in the filtering water<br>
tank and the water supply path connected to the untreated<br>
water reservoir upstream of the filter or to a clean water<br>
reservoir downstream of the filter, in order to discharge<br>
impurities from the filtering water tank through the water<br>
discharge path, along with running water from the water<br>
supply path and clean the filtering water tank, without<br>
detaching the filtering water tank.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0034]<br>
Now, embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described.<br>
[Construction]<br>
The fryer 1 as one embodiment of this invention has a<br>
fryer tank la shaped like a downwardly protruding pyramid or<br>
circular cone, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4C. The fryer<br>
tank la has two layers vertically disposed one upon the other<br>
- 15 -<br><br>
- an oil layer 11 for cooking and a water layer 12 disposed<br>
beneath the oil layer 11 to receive impurities from the oil<br>
layer, such as deep-fried batter balls, to clean the cooking<br>
oil.<br>
[0035]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, an electric or gas heater<br>
5 to heat the oil is provided in the oil layer 11 of the<br>
fryer tank la.<br>
The heater 5 is located at an almost central part of the<br>
oil layer 11. With the heater 5 activated, two layers are<br>
formed - a high-temperature oil portion lib and a low-<br>
temperature oil portion 11a - with their boundary slightly<br>
below the heater 5.<br>
Thus, the fryer tank la has three layers which are, from<br>
the bottom upward, the water layer 12, the low-temperature<br>
oil portion 11a and the high-temperature oil portion lib.<br>
[0036]<br>
Of these, the high-temperature oil portion lib<br>
constitutes a frying portion that fries at an appropriate<br>
temperature food materials with coatings that are put on a<br>
basket made of slender metal bars or metal grids and then<br>
lowered into the cooking oil.<br>
The low-temperature oil portion 11a forms a temperature<br>
buffer portion between the high-temperature oil portion lib<br>
and the water layer 12 and has a function of adjusting the<br>
- 16 -<br><br>
oil temperature of the high-temperature oil portion lib and<br>
supplying new oil that is not yet degraded.<br>
The water layer 12 constitutes an impurity accumulator<br>
that functions as a sedimentation layer in which impurities<br>
produced during frying, such as fried batter balls, slowly<br>
settle. The water layer 12 also has a function of turning<br>
the water horizontally for oil cleaning and temperature<br>
adjustment.<br>
[0037]<br>
The water in the water layer 12, as shown in Fig. 1, Fig.<br>
4 and Fig. 7, is drawn out from a water suction opening 2b at<br>
the bottom of the fryer tank la by a water pump 2e along with<br>
impurities such as deep-fried batter balls and then flows<br>
through a pipe 2c of a water circulation path 2 into a<br>
filtering water tank 2a where it is filtered of impurities,<br>
such as deep-fried batter balls, by a filter 2j installed in<br>
the filtering water tank 2a. After being removed of<br>
impurities, the clean water is returned from a clean water<br>
reservoir 2m of the filtering water tank 2a into the fryer<br>
tank la.<br>
When it is returned to the fryer tank la, the clean water<br>
is delivered from a water supply opening 2i in a side wall Id<br>
on the back side of the fryer tank la almost horizontally<br>
along an adjoining side wall le so that the water moves in a<br>
swirl in the water layer 12 within the fryer tank la.<br>
- 17 -<br><br>
As the water layer 12 swirls, the low-temperature oil<br>
portion 11a disposed immediately above, and in contact with,<br>
the water layer 12 begins to turn with a time lag, causing<br>
the high-temperature oil portion lib immediately above the<br>
low-temperature oil portion 11a also to move in a swirl with<br>
a greater time lag.<br>
[0038]<br>
At this time, if ejected with a strong force, the water<br>
can fiercely stir the low-temperature oil portion 11a,<br>
prompting even fine pieces of impurities, such as deep-fried<br>
batter balls, contained in the oil to fall into the water,<br>
thus cleaning the oil.<br>
Even in the above process, the stirring motion of a lower<br>
part of the low-temperature oil portion 11a does not affect<br>
its upper part, allowing it to turn in a relatively calm<br>
state as it is heated by the heater 5.<br>
[0039]<br>
Turning the water in the water layer 12 as described<br>
above may also be achieved by installing a water-immersed<br>
pump 2p in the water layer 12, as shown in Fig. 7, to<br>
directly turn the water layer 12 and rotate the low-<br>
temperature oil portion 11a by the rotating force of the<br>
water.<br>
It is also possible to install an oil pump (not shown),<br>
similar to the one shown in Fig. 7, in the oil layer 11 to<br>
- 18 -<br><br>
directly turn the low-temperature oil portion 11a.<br>
Another method of directly rotating the low-temperature<br>
oil portion 11a in a swirl involves discharging the clean<br>
water delivered from the filtering water tank 2a almost<br>
horizontally in an off-centered direction from the water<br>
supply opening 2i provided in the low-temperature oil portion<br>
11a.<br>
[0040]<br>
On an inner wall of the fryer tank la, there is provided<br>
a water level sensor lc at a boundary position between the<br>
water layer 12 and the low-temperature oil portion 11a, as<br>
shown in Fig. 4C, to monitor the boundary between oil and<br>
water. An alarm lamp and a buzzer are activated to indicate<br>
when the water level is too high or too low.<br>
[0041]<br>
The filtering water tank 2a has installed therein a<br>
vertically disposed stainless steel filter 2j of 0.7 mm mesh<br>
that divides the interior of the filtering water tank 2a.<br>
After having been drawn out of the fryer tank la by the water<br>
pump 2e into an untreated water reservoir 2k of the filtering<br>
water tank 2a upstream of the filter 2j, the water passes<br>
through the filter 2j onto the clean water reservoir 2m side,<br>
leaving the trapped impurities, such as deep-fried batter<br>
balls, in the untreated water reservoir 2k to settle on the<br>
bottom.<br>
- 19 -<br><br>
[0042]<br>
The water cleaned by the filtering water tank 2a is drawn<br>
by suction from a suction port 2f of the filtering water tank<br>
2a into a bubble elimination tank 2g where bubbles are<br>
allowed to float upward. The water removed of bubbles flows<br>
out from an outlet port 2h of the bubble elimination tank 2g<br>
into the fryer tank la through the water supply opening 2i<br>
provided at the top of the water layer 12 or in the low-<br>
temperature oil portion 11a. In this way the water<br>
circulates in the water circulation path 2.<br>
[0043]<br>
The fryer of this embodiment has an oil circulation path<br>
3. The oil circulation path 3, as shown in Fig. 5, comprises<br>
a square-cylindrical flow path 3a of metal sheet mounted to<br>
an outer wall of the fryer tank la, a circular cylindrical<br>
pipe 3c, an oil discharge nozzle 3e and an oil pump 3b.<br>
The square-cylindrical flow path 3a attached to the fryer<br>
tank la has an oil suction opening 3f formed at the upper end<br>
thereof and an opening 3g at the lower end thereof so that<br>
oil near the upper surface of the high-temperature oil<br>
portion lib can be drawn into the oil suction opening 3f to<br>
let impurities such as deep-fried batter balls fall into the<br>
water layer 12 through the opening 3g at the lower end of the<br>
square-cylindrical flow path 3a.<br>
The circular cylindrical pipe 3c is connected to an<br>
- 20 -<br><br>
intermediate part of the square-cylindrical flow path 3a to<br>
allow the oil drawn in by the oil pump 3b to be delivered<br>
into the water layer 12 through the oil discharge nozzle 3e.<br>
The square-cylindrical flow path 3a has many fins 3d<br>
protruding from an outer surface thereof which are forcibly<br>
cooled by a wind from a cooling fan 4 to quickly cool the oil<br>
passing through the interior of the square-cylindrical flow<br>
path 3a from about 170°C down to about 70-80°C.<br>
[0044]<br>
The oil discharge nozzle 3e, as shown in Fig. 6, is laid<br>
longitudinally horizontally in the lower end part of the<br>
water layer 12 and has many small holes 3h formed in an upper<br>
surface of the front end thereof so that oil is broken into<br>
small pieces as it passes through them, floating upward in<br>
small balls or in continuous long bars.<br>
The oil discharge nozzle 3e also has an oil release<br>
member 3i, semicircular in cross section, open on the<br>
underside and closed at its front end, to let impurities such<br>
as deep-fried batter balls contained in the oil fall downward.<br>
[0045]<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the bubble elimination tank 2g is<br>
connected at its upper end with an air vent pipe 7a through a<br>
water-side exhaust pipe joint 7f. A gas accumulator 3j<br>
formed above the oil pump 3b is connected at its upper end<br>
with a pipe 7b through a gas venting pressure adjust means 7g.<br>
- 21 -<br><br>
The air vent pipe 7a and the pipe 7b are joined by a<br>
merge joint 7c. The merge joint 7c is connected at its<br>
downstream side with a merge pipe 7d which has at its front<br>
end an inner pressure adjust joint 7e as a gas venting<br>
pressure adjust means. The inner pressure adjust joint 7e is<br>
connected to an upper end of the square-cylindrical flow path<br>
3a to release the air accumulated in the upper part of the<br>
bubble elimination tank 2g and vaporized gas in the gas<br>
accumulator 3j above the oil pump 3b. All these combine to<br>
form an air venting path 7 that performs a pressure<br>
adjustment so that the pressure of air in the upper part of<br>
the bubble elimination tank 2g is almost equal to that of the<br>
gas accumulator 3j provided on the oil pump 3b side.<br>
[0046]<br>
With the above construction, the amount of air<br>
accumulated in the upper part of the bubble elimination tank<br>
2g and the amount of vaporized gas accumulated in the gas<br>
accumulator 3j at the upper end of the oil pump 3b are both<br>
kept minimal, preventing the air and vaporized gas from<br>
mixing in the high-temperature oil portion lib during the<br>
circulation of water and oil, which in turn can avoid hot oil<br>
splashing accidents caused by sudden expansion of air or<br>
vaporized gas.<br>
[0047]<br>
In the fryer of this embodiment constructed as described<br>
- 22 -<br><br>
above, during a standby when food is not fried, the cooking<br>
oil is kept slightly lower (at a standby temperature) than a<br>
frying temperature. If, for example, food is to be fried at<br>
a set temperature of 170°C, the oil is kept at a slightly<br>
lower temperature of approximately 150°C as a standby<br>
temperature.<br>
[0048]<br>
When a user presses a switch lg on a front panel If of<br>
the device to enter into the frying operation, the<br>
temperature of the heater 5 rises causing the oil temperature<br>
to start rising from the standby temperature to a set<br>
temperature (e.g., 170°C) . Since the heater 5 is disposed in<br>
the high-temperature oil portion lib, only the high-<br>
temperature oil portion lib is raised to the set temperature.<br>
In the low-temperature oil portion 11a, a relatively high<br>
temperature oil moves up to combine with the oil of the high-<br>
temperature oil portion lib and a relatively low temperature<br>
oil moves down to combine with a low temperature oil. So<br>
there are always two layers - the high-temperature oil<br>
portion lib and the low-temperature oil portion 11a - and the<br>
water layer 12 in contact with the low-temperature oil<br>
portion 11a is not heated while at the same time the high-<br>
temperature oil portion lib can maintain the set temperature<br>
for frying.<br>
[0049]<br>
- 23 -<br><br>
At this time, the water in the water layer 12 may be set<br>
in rotating motion to change the heating mode from a natural<br>
convection heat transmission to a forced convection heat<br>
transmission to enhance the heat exchange performance of the<br>
heater 5, allowing the oil to better follow the rising<br>
temperature of the heater up to the set temperature and<br>
thereby quickly return from the standby state to the fry-<br>
ready state.<br>
This shortens the time it takes for the oil to rise to<br>
the frying temperature and improves the oil's temperature<br>
response to the heater temperature rise, allowing the<br>
heater's target temperature to be set low and preventing oil<br>
degradation even if the oil is used repetitively.<br>
[0050]<br>
When food materials are thrown into the high-temperature<br>
oil portion lib, a normal frying operation is executed,<br>
producing a large amount of deep-fried batter balls. When<br>
large deep-fried batter balls are produced, they quickly sink,<br>
passing through the low-temperature oil portion 11a into the<br>
water layer 12. Then they are drawn by the water pump 2e<br>
along with water into the water circulation path 2 and then<br>
delivered to the filtering water tank 2a, where the deep-<br>
fried batter balls are trapped by the filter and the filtered<br>
water is returned to the water layer 12.<br>
[0051]<br>
- 24 -<br><br>
On the other hand, minute deep-fried batter balls are<br>
drawn into the square-cylindrical flow path 3a from its upper<br>
end, together with the oil in the upper part of the high-<br>
temperature oil portion lib. In the square-cylindrical flow<br>
path 3a, the minute deep-fried batter balls and hot oil are<br>
forcibly cooled to a lower temperature. The deep-fried<br>
batter balls are allowed to fall into the water layer 12 from<br>
the opening 3g at the lower end of the square-cylindrical<br>
flow path 3a. The oil cooled to a lower temperature is<br>
delivered by the oil pump 3b through the circular cylindrical<br>
pipe 3c to the water layer 12. The oil is then broken into<br>
small pieces as it passes through the oil release member 3i<br>
of the oil discharge nozzle 3e, before being released into<br>
the water layer 12. When the oil in the form of small balls<br>
or continuous elongate bars comes into contact with water and<br>
gets cooled, fine impurities such as deep-fried batter balls<br>
are easily separated from the oil. The small pieces of oil<br>
then move up the water, leaving behind the impurities, until<br>
they reach and merge into the low-temperature oil portion 11a<br>
thus maintaining a required volume of clean oil.<br>
[0052]<br>
As described above, the water circulation effectively<br>
filters out the deep-fried batter balls and the generation of<br>
a large swirl in the water layer 12 causes the oil in contact<br>
with the water to revolve, allowing the oil heated at the<br>
- 25 -<br><br>
surface of the heater to efficiently transmit heat to the<br>
entire oil in the oil layer 11, thus stabilizing the oil<br>
temperature and reducing the time it takes for the oil to<br>
raise its temperature and return from the standby state.<br>
[0053]<br>
[Impurity Removing Device]<br>
The fryer of this embodiment has an impurity removing<br>
device 2 5 which, as shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, removes<br>
impurities such as deep-fried batter balls from the filtering<br>
water tank 2a.<br>
The impurity removing device 25 forms a piping flow path<br>
separate from the water circulation path 2 so that it can<br>
perform an impurity removing operation independently.<br>
[0054]<br>
The untreated water reservoir 2k and the clean water<br>
reservoir 2m in the filtering water tank 2a are connected<br>
with a water discharge pipe 21b for impurity removal and a<br>
water supply pipe 21a, respectively. In these pipes are<br>
installed a piston-driven flow control valve 22 and a<br>
solenoid type stop valve 23. The flow control valve 22 is<br>
connected on its upstream side to a city water tap (not<br>
shown). The filtering water tank 2a may be provided with a<br>
water level sensor on an inner wall thereof, as required, so<br>
that the flow control valve 22 as a flow regulator can adjust<br>
the volume of water being supplied according to a signal from<br>
- 26 -<br><br>
the water level sensor.<br>
[0055]<br>
On the downstream side of the stop valve 23 is installed<br>
an impurity collecting container 24 having a wire basket 24a<br>
formed of a 0.7-mm mesh stainless steel wire net that drains<br>
impurities such as deep-fried batter balls delivered there by<br>
the water flowing out of the front end of the water discharge<br>
pipe 21b and which traps and accommodates the drained<br>
impurities.<br>
[0056]<br>
In connection with the installation of the impurity<br>
removing device 25, a filtering water path 13g is provided<br>
with a solenoid type check valve 13h that prevents a backflow<br>
toward the bubble elimination tank 2g of the water that is<br>
supplied from the water supply pipe 21a to the filtering<br>
water tank 2a. Prior to supplying water from the water<br>
supply pipe 21a, the check valve 13h is closed to prevent a<br>
possible backflow in the filtering water path 13g.<br>
The flow control valve 22 has a valve structure capable<br>
of fully closing the flow path. The flow control valve 22<br>
and the stop valve 23 are also made manually operable so that<br>
an impurity removal mode may be started and stopped manually.<br>
[0057]<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, the water supply pipe 21a has a water<br>
supply end pipe 22a extending from a piping joint at the<br>
- 27 -<br><br>
upper end of the clean water reservoir 2m in the filtering<br>
water tank. 2a to the bottom of the reservoir 2m. The water<br>
supply end pipe 22a is formed with an appropriate number of<br>
small water supply holes (not shown) between the bottom and<br>
the upper end thereof. These small holes are formed such<br>
that their diameter is increased as they approach the bottom.<br>
Alternatively, if they are formed in the same diameter, the<br>
number of small holes is increased toward the bottom.<br>
The water discharge pipe 21b has a water discharge end<br>
pipe 22b extending from the upper end of the filtering water<br>
tank 2a to the bottom so that a discharge opening of the pipe<br>
21b is disposed close to the bottom of the filtering water<br>
tank 2a. In this piping, water discharged at the upper end<br>
of the filtering water tank 2a from the water discharge end<br>
pipe 22b is delivered through the single water discharge pipe<br>
21b to the impurity collecting container 24.<br>
In this impurity removing device 25, the water supply<br>
pipe 21a is connected to a city water tap (not shown) on the<br>
upstream side of the flow control valve 22 . With the tap<br>
open, the stop valve 23 is opened to allow the flow control<br>
valve 22 to adjust the water supply volume in the impurity<br>
removing operation.<br>
[0058]<br>
The water discharge pipe 21b can be made to penetrate the<br>
bottom of the filtering water tank 2a and connected to the<br>
- 28 -<br><br>
impurity collecting container 24 disposed directly beneath<br>
the filtering water tank 2a so that impurities can be<br>
discharged out into the container 24. In this case, the<br>
filtering water tank can be removed of impurities and washed<br>
clean without removing the filtering water tank.<br>
[0059]<br>
[Impurity Removing Method]<br>
In the fryer 1 of this embodiment with the impurity<br>
removing device 25, when, while not frying, the operation<br>
mode is switched from the fry mode to the impurity removal<br>
mode, the water that has flowed from the water supply pipe<br>
21a into the clean water reservoir 2m of the filtering water<br>
tank 2a passes through the filter 2j into the untreated water<br>
reservoir 2k. The water then flows from the water discharge<br>
end pipe 2.2b through the water discharge pipe 21b out into<br>
the impurity collecting container 24, carrying impurities<br>
with it .<br>
[0060]<br>
During the impurity removal mode, the water level sensor<br>
attached to the inner wall surface of the filtering water<br>
tank 2a is energized. Since the water supply volume can be<br>
adjusted by the flow control valve 22 based on a signal from<br>
the water level sensor, the stop valve 23 is opened to let<br>
the water coming out of the filtering water tank 2a flow into<br>
the impurity collecting container 24 while at the same time<br>
- 29 -<br><br>
adjusting the water flow as required by the removal of<br>
impurities.<br>
[0061]<br>
With the impurities such as deep-fried batter balls<br>
trapped in the untreated water reservoir 2k of the filtering<br>
water tank 2a removed, the power supply of the impurity<br>
removal mode is shut off, the stop valve 23 and the flow<br>
control valve 22 are fully closed to stop the water flow,<br>
thus ending the impurity removal mode of the fryer.<br>
[0062]<br>
Then, the impurities such as deep-fried batter balls<br>
drained by the wire basket 24a of the impurity collecting<br>
container 24 and waste water are discarded as required,<br>
completing the impurity removing work.<br>
[0063]<br>
The replacement of water in the filtering water tank 2a,<br>
performed in the same way as the removal of impurities from<br>
the filtering water tank 2a, can be effectively utilized also<br>
when the water in the fryer tank la needs to be replaced as<br>
when the water in the water layer 12 of the fryer tank la is<br>
contaminated or when the water temperature has risen beyond<br>
approximately 60°C.<br>
That is, if cool water is supplied directly into the<br>
water layer 12 at an elevated temperature, a sudden expansion<br>
of water may cause a dangerous situation. To prevent this,<br>
- 30 -<br><br>
the water circulation path is first closed to stop the water<br>
circulation and discharge the water from the filtering water<br>
tank 2a, after which clean water is filled into the filtering<br>
water tank 2a and then water circulation is again started.<br>
This allows the clean water to be supplied gradually into the<br>
water layer 12. By repeating this procedure as required, the<br>
water in the fryer tank la can be replaced with clean water.<br>
This water replacement procedure can be performed<br>
manually or automatically by sensing the water temperature in<br>
the fryer tank la.<br>
[0064]<br>
In the above example, the water supply pipe 21a and the<br>
water discharge pipe 21b are connected to the clean water<br>
reservoir 2m downstream of the filter and the untreated water<br>
reservoir 2k upstream of the filter, respectively. These<br>
pipes may also be connected both to the untreated water<br>
reservoir 2k upstream of the filter.<br>
[0065]<br>
The water supply pipe 21a and the water discharge pipe<br>
21b may be connected to locations close to where an impurity<br>
mixture water path 13f and a filtering water path 13g of a<br>
water circulation system piping 13c connect to the untreated<br>
water reservoir 2k and the clean water reservoir 2m,<br>
respectively, of the filtering water tank 2a, in order to<br>
keep the number of pipes directly connecting to the filtering<br>
- 31 -<br><br>
water tank 2a from increasing. In that case, the pipes<br>
connecting to the filtering water tank 2a can be limited only<br>
to two pipes - the impurity mixture water path 13f and the<br>
filtering water path 13g of the water circulation system<br>
piping 13c -- facilitating the process of mounting and<br>
dismounting the filtering water tank. 2a to and from the fryer<br>
body.<br>

layer, filter out impurities mixed in the water by a filter<br>
and return the filtered water to the fryer tank;<br>
wherein the filtering water tank has an impurity removing<br>
device that is connected with a water discharge path and a<br>
water supply path;<br>
wherein the water discharge path has a stop valve and<br>
discharges the water mixed with the impurities from an<br>
untreated water reservoir upstream of the filter to the<br>
outside of the filtering water tank;<br>
wherein the water supply path has a flow regulator and,<br>
during a water discharging operation, supplies water to the<br>
untreated water reservoir upstream of the filter or to a<br>
clean water reservoir downstream of the filter.<br>
11.	A fryer according to claim 10, wherein the impurity<br>
removing device has connected to a bottom of the filtering<br>
water tank the water discharge path that discharges water<br>
containing impurities from the untreated water reservoir<br>
- 38 -<br><br>
upstream of the filter to the outside of the filtering water<br>
tank.<br>
12. A fryer according to claim 10, wherein the impurity<br>
removing device has an impurity collecting container that<br>
accommodates impurity-laden water, discharged from the<br>
discharge opening of the water discharge path, through a net<br>
basket formed of a filtering material having almost the same<br>
mesh size as the filter of the filtering water tank.<br>
13 . An impurity removing method for a fryer comprising<br>
the steps of:<br>
storing cooking oil and water in two layers one upon the<br>
other, the water being adapted to receive impurities sinking<br>
from the oil into it;<br>
filtering out impurities contained in water drawn from a<br>
water layer in a fryer tank into a filtering water tank; and<br>
returning the filtered water to the fryer tank;<br>
wherein, after stopping a circulation of the filtered<br>
water between the fryer tank and the filtering water tank, a<br>
water discharge path connected to an untreated water<br>
reservoir upstream of a filter in the filtering water tank<br>
and a water supply path connected to the untreated water<br>
reservoir upstream of the filter or a clean water reservoir<br>
downstream of the filter are opened to discharge impurities<br>
from the filtering water tank through the water discharge<br>
path, along with running water from the water supply path.<br><br><br>
- 39 -<br><br>
A fryer is provided which, during a standby for cooking,<br>
can keep the temperature of a cooking oil slightly lower than<br>
a cooking temperature and, during cooking, can quickly raise<br>
the oil temperature to the cooking temperature. The fryer<br>
also has capabilities of easily performing a heat exchange<br>
operation on the cooking oil, preventing degradation of the<br>
cooking oil, securing a good kitchen environment and<br>
enhancing a work efficiency. The fryer comprises a fryer<br>
tank having oil and water for cleaning the oil stored in two<br>
layers one upon the other; and a heater installed in the oil<br>
layer; wherein the water in the water layer is drawn out from<br>
a water suction opening at a bottom of fryer tank, cleaned by<br>
a filtering water tank and then delivered into the fryer tank<br>
almost horizontally in an off-centered direction from a water<br>
supply opening formed in a lower, side wall of the fryer tank,<br>
thus rotating the water in the fryer tank in a swirl. The<br>
fryer also has a device for discharging impurities collected<br>
in the filtering water tank.<br></td>
