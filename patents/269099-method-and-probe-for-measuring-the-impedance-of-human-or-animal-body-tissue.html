METHOD AND PROBE FOR MEASURING THE IMPEDANCE OF HUMAN OR<br>
ANIMAL BODY TISSUE<br>
The present invention relates to a probe which can measure the impedance of human or<br>
animal body tissue. More particularly it relates to a probe which can determine when the<br>
probe is placed over a boundary between two different tissue types and a corresponding<br>
method.<br>
It has been proposed to use measurements of tissue impedance in medical diagnosis<br>
applications. An example of a probe suitable for measuring the tissue impedance is<br>
discussed in WO-A-01/67098 and is depicted in Figure 1. The probe comprises four 1mm<br>
diameter gold electrodes 2 which are mounted flush with the end race 4 of the probe and<br>
spaced equally on a circle of 1.65mm radius.<br>
Figure 2 depicts the way in which the probe is used to calculate a transfer impedance when<br>
it has been placed in contact with a tissue to be measured. An ac current I, of 10 uA peak-<br>
to-peak is passed between two adjacent electrodes 6,8 and the real part of the resulting<br>
potential V, between the two remaining electrodes 10,12 is measured. The current path<br>
used for measuring the impedance is depicted in Figure 2 by broken line 14, it runs from<br>
electrode 6 to electrode 10 to electrode 12 to electrode 8.<br>
The ratio of the measured potential to the amplitude of the current determines the transfer<br>
impedance. Measurements are made at eight frequencies by doubling the frequency in<br>
steps between4.8 kHz and 614 kHz. Measurements may also be made at frequency ranges<br>
with an upper limit of up to 1.5 MHz.<br>
The transfer impedance so measured can then be analysed for use m cancer screening<br>
because the value will vary according to the type of cells and their arrangements which<br>
make up the tissue. The transfer impedance can also be used in screening for pre-term<br>
birth.<br><br>
WO 2006/129108<br><br>
PCT/GB2006/002026<br><br>

However, the method can give inaccurate results when the probe is positioned over a tissue<br>
boundary. When the probe is used for cervical cancer screening the two major normal<br>
tissue types are normal squamous epithelium and columnar tissue. These two tissues are<br>
well separated in their impedance spectrums. However, if the probe is placed close to the<br>
uterine canal on the border between these two tissue types the resulting measured<br>
impedance can look like premalignant tissue. (The impedance spectrum of premalignant<br>
tissue lies between that of normal squamous epithelium and columnar tissue,) Therefore,<br>
misplacement of the probe may lead to a false positive result.<br>
It is desirable to reduce the occurrence of false positive results. Accordingly, the present<br>
invention provides a method and a probe which can determine whether the probe has been<br>
placed over a tissue boundary. Thus an operative can be alerted to reposition the probe<br>
slightly to reduce the likelihood of a raise positive result<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for<br>
determining whether a probe for measuring the impedance of human or animal body tissue<br>
has been placed over a boundary between different tissue types, the probe comprising at<br>
least a first, a second, a third and a fourth electrode arranged such that the third and fourth<br>
electrodes are each located substantially the same distance from both the first and second<br>
electrodes; the method comprising:<br>
driving a current between the first and the second electrode;<br>
measuring a first value of an electrical parameter between the third and the fourth<br>
electrode; and<br>
detennining whether the probe has been placed over a boundary between difrerent<br>
tissue types based on the first value.<br>
The electrical parameter may be the potential difference between the third and fourth<br>
electrodes, the transfer impedance between the first and second electrodes and the third and<br>
fourth electrodes or the current flowing between the third and fourth electrodes. The third<br>
and fourth electrodes are each substantially the same distance from the first and second<br>
electrodes. Therefore, if the probe has been placed over substantially homogenous tissue<br><br>
WO 2006/129108<br><br>
PCT/GB2006/002026<br><br>
-3-<br>
the current path through the third electrode will be the same as the current path through the<br>
fourth electrode, the system will be balanced and the first value will indicate this.<br>
As the system is balanced the first value can be expected to be low or close to zero.<br>
Therefore, in one embodiment, in the step of determining whether the probe has been<br>
placed over a boundary between different tissue types, if the first value is not substantially<br>
equal to zero it is determined mat the probe has been placed over a boundary between<br>
different tissue types.<br>
The method can be used with several different arrangements of electrodes, however it is<br>
preferred that the first, second, third and fourth electrodes are arranged at the corners of a<br>
square with the first and second electrodes diagonally opposite each other. This<br>
arrangement is advantageous because it can be used to measure the tissue impedance and<br>
also determine whether the apparatus has been placed over a tissue boundary with the same<br>
set of four electrodes.<br>
It has also been found that a comparison of the first value with a value of the parameter<br>
obtained when measuring the impedance of the tissue is effective at identifying a tissue<br>
boundary. Thus, in one preferable embodiment, the step of deterrnining whether the probe<br>
has been placed over a boundary between different tissue types comprises:<br>
comparing the first value to a predetermined value, wherein the predetermined<br>
value is that expected to be obtained when a current is driven between the first and third<br>
electrodes and the electrical parameter is measured between the second and fourth<br>
electrode; and wherein if the first value is greater than half the predetermined value it is<br>
determined that the probe has been placed over a boundary between different tissue types.<br>
More preferably if the first value has a value greater man 20% of the predetermined value it<br>
is determined that the probe has been placed over a boundary between different tissue<br>
types. Still more preferably, if the first value has a value greater than 10% of the<br>
predetermined value it is determined that the probe has been placed over a boundary<br>
between different tissue types.<br><br>
WO 2006/129108<br><br>
PCT/GB2006/002026<br><br>
-4-<br>
The poredetennined value may be provided based on an assumption of a particular tissue<br>
type or be an average across all likely tissue types.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the method may further comprise:<br>
driving the current between the first and third electrodes; and<br>
measuring a second value of the electrical parameter between the second and<br>
fourth electrodes;<br>
wherein said step of determining whether the probe has been placed over a<br>
boundary comprises comparing the first value to the second value and wherein if the first<br>
value is greater than half the second value it is determined that the probe has been placed<br>
over a boundary between different tissue types. More preferably if the first value has a<br>
value greater than 20% of the second value it is determined that the probe has been placed<br>
over a boundary between different tissue types. Still more preferably, if the first value has<br>
a value greater than 10% of the second value it is determined that the probe has been<br>
placed over a boundary between different tissue types.<br>
This method has the advantage that the actual parameter being measured by the probe may<br>
be used in the determination of whether the probe is placed over a tissue boundary.<br>
Although unlikely to happen, h is possible that the method above might not detect a tissue<br>
boundary which passes between the first and second electrodes or the third and the fourth<br>
electrodes because in mat case the system will still be balanced. The system will also be<br>
balnced if the boundary is parallel to a line drawn between the first and second electrodes<br>
or parallel to a line drawn between the third and fourth electrodes. To avoid this problem<br>
the method may further comprise rotating the probe slightly, preferably by an angle of less<br>
than 45°, and repeating the measurement of the first value of die electrical parameter. A<br>
rotation of less than 45° is preferable because of the rotational symmetry of a square<br>
electrode arrangement<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the probe may be provided with more than four electrodes to<br>
enable a tissue boundary passing through two of the electrodes to be detected without<br>
requiring rotation of the probe.<br><br>

According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a probe for<br>
measuring the impedance of human or animal body tissue, the probe comprising:<br>
at least a first, a second, a third and a fourth electrode arranged such that the third<br>
and fourth electrodes are each located substantially the same distance from both the first<br>
and second electrodes;<br>
a current source for driving a current between the first and second electrodes;<br>
a measurement circuit for measuring a first value of an electrical parameter<br>
between the third and fourth electrodes; and<br>
a controller for controlling the current source; and<br>
a processor for determining whether the probe has been placed over a boundary<br>
between different tissue types based on the first value.<br>
The controller and processor may be implemented in several ways, tor example as an<br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a microprocessor, microcontroller or a<br>
programmable logic array. The measurement circuit may be a voltmeter or any other<br>
circuit which is capable of measuring the potential difference between two points, or an<br>
ammeter for measuring the current flowing between two points. In one embodiment the<br>
current source, measurement circuit, controller and processor may be integrated into a<br>
single integrated circuit<br>
In one embodiment the processor determines that the probe has been placed over a<br>
boundary between different tissue types if the first value is not substantially equal to zero.<br>
Preferably, the first, second, third and fourth electrodes are arranged at the comers of a<br>
square with the first and second electrodes diagonally opposite each other. The same<br>
electrodes can men be used for impedance measurement and for detecting placement of the<br>
probe over a tissue boundary.<br>
In one preferable embodiment, the processor is also tor comparing the first value to a<br>
predetermined value, wherem me predetermined value is that expected to be obtained when<br>
a current is driven between the first and third electrodes and the electrical parameter is<br>

than half the predetermined, value it is determined that the probe has been placed over a<br>
boundary between different tissue types, More preferably if the first value has a value<br>
greater than 20% of the predetermined value the processor determines that the probe has<br>
been placed over a boundary between different tissue types. Still more preferably, if the<br>
first value has a value greater than 10% of the predetermined value, the processor<br>
determines that the probe has been placed over a boundary between different tissue types,<br>
In another preferable embodiment, the current source is also for driving a current between<br>
the first and third electrodes; and<br>
the measuring circuit is also for measuring a second value of the electrical<br>
parameter between the second and fourth electrodes;<br>
wherein the processor determines whether the probe has been placed over a<br>
boundary by comparing the first value to the second value, and wherein if the first<br>
electrical parameter is greater than half the second value it is determined mat the probe has<br>
been placed over a boundary between different tissue types. More preferably if the first<br>
value has a value greater than 20% of the second value the processor determines that the<br>
probe has been placed over a boundary between different tissue types. Still more<br>
preferably, if the first value has a value greater man 10% of the second value, the processor<br>
determines that the probe has been placed over a boundary between different tissue types.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a computer program<br>
comprising code means that, when executed on a computer system, instructs the computer<br>
system to perform the method of the first aspect of the invention. This allows the method<br>
of detecting placement of a probe over a tissue boundary to be provided as a retro-fit<br>
upgrade. The term computer system is used to encompass bom an external computer<br>
system connected to the probe and also an internal controller or microprocessor located<br>
within the probe which executes instructions to operate the probe.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a computer program<br>

the above described third aspect.<br><br>

Embodimentg of the invention will now be described by way of example only with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 depicts a probe for measuring the impedance of tissue;<br>
Figure 2 depicts a method for using the probe depicted in Figure 1 to measure the<br>
impedance of tissue;<br>
Figure 3 depicts a method according to the present invention for detecting placement of the<br>
probe depicted in Figure 1 across a tissue boundary; and<br>
Figure 4 depicts a probe which has been placed over a tissue boundary.<br>
In a first embodiment, depicted in Figure 3, a probe is provided with four electrodes 16,18,<br>
20,22 are arranged at the comers of a square, as described for example in WO-A-<br>
01/67098. The probe includes a controller and a processor (not shown) which are both<br>
implemented by a microprocessor in this embodiment but may also be a microcontroller,<br>
an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or a programmable logic array. The<br>
controller controls the way in which the electrodes are driven.<br>
There are two modes of operation. In the first mode, the probe measures the tissue<br>
impedance by driving the electrodes in the same way as that described in WO-A-01/67098.<br>
That is, an alternating current supplied from a current source (not shown) is driven between<br>
two adjacent electrodes and the resulting potential difference is measured by a<br>
measurement circuit (not shown) between the other two electrodes. The ratio of the<br>
amplitude of the alternating current to the resulting potential difference can then be used to<br>
calculate the tissue impedance. The amplitude of the alternating current may be in the<br>
range 1 μAto 1mA. Measurement is taken at several values in the range of 1 kHz up to an<br>
npper limit of 500 kHz to 3 MHz.<br>
In the second mode of operation the electrodes are driven to enable the placement of the<br>
probe over a tissue boundary to be detected. The controller controls the current source to<br>
drive a current between diagonally opposite electrodes 16,22 rather than between adjacent<br>
electrodes as is the case when measuring tissue impedance. The potential is measured by<br><br>
WO 2006/129108<br><br>
PCT/GB2006/002026<br><br>
-8-<br>
the measurement circuit between the other two electrodes 18, 20. The same currents and<br>
frequencies ate used as in the first mode of operation.<br>
This driving arrangement results in two effective current paths which are depicted with<br>
broken lines in Figure 3. The first current path 24 runs from electrode 16 to electrode 22<br>
via electrode 18. The second current path 26 tuns from electrode 16 to electrode 22 via<br>
electrode 20. By measuring the potential difference across electrodes 18,20 the probe<br>
electrodes now function in a similar way to a bridge circuit, If the tissue on which the<br>
probe has been placed is homogenous the effective impedance of path 24 will be the same<br>
as the effective impedance of path 26. The geometry of the arrangement is such that the<br>
electrodes IS and 20 are each located the same distance from both electrode 16 and<br>
electrode 22. Therefore, in a theoretically ideal situation, the potential measured across<br>
electrodes IS and 20 with homogenous tissue will be substantially equal to zero because<br>
the system is balanced.<br>
Figure 4 depicts the situation in which the probe has been placed over a tissue boundary 28.<br>
In this embodiment the probe is used for cervical cancer screening and therefore the two<br>
major tissue types are normal squamous epithelium and columnar tissue. These two tissues<br>
are well separated in their impedance spectrums. Therefore, when the current is driven<br>
between electrodes 16 and 22, me impedance in the path through electrode IS is not the<br>
same as the impedance in the path through electrode 20. As a result a non-zero potential<br>
difference will be measured between electrodes IS and 20, indicating that the probe is<br>
placed on a tissue boundary.<br>
The processor determines from the measured potential difference whether the probe has<br>
been placed on a tissue boundary, m the event mai it is detemiined that the probe is<br>
located on a tissue boundary a visual or audio warning may be communicated to alert the<br>
operative to remove the probe. This warning may be transmitted from the probe itself, for<br>
example from a light or buzzer in the handle, or from a connected computer system.<br>
The square arrangement of this embodiment has the added benefit that the same electrodes<br>
can be used both for tissue impedance measurements and to check that the probe is not<br><br>
WO 2006/129108<br><br>
PCT/GB2006/002026<br><br>
-9-<br>
located over a tissue boundary. If the probe is located over a tissue boundary any<br>
impedance measurements will not be reliable and it is therefore preferable to drive the<br>
electrodes to check for a tissue boundary prior to driving them to measure the tissue<br>
impedance.<br>
It has been found that the difference between the impedance of tissue types likely to be<br>
encountered in cancer screening is most different at lower frequencies. Therefore, the<br>
detection of a tissue boundary can be improved by driving the current at generally lower<br>
frequencies man those used for tissue impedance measurement<br>
It is possible that a tissue boundary which passes diagonally under the probe, coincident<br>
with either electrodes 16 and 22 or electrodes 18 and 20 will not be detected because the<br>
resulting system will still be balanced. Likewise, the system will also be balanced if the<br>
tissue boundary is parallel to the line between electrodes 16 and 22 or parallel to the line<br>
between electrodes 18 and 20. To avoid lack of detection because of this, the operator may<br>
rotate the probe slightly about its central axis before the probe repeats the boundary<br>
detection. An angle of rotation of less than 45 ° is preferred because of the rotational<br>
symmetry of the square electrode arrangement<br>
In a second embodiment of the present invention, which i$ the same as first save as<br>
described below, the measured value of potential difference obtained when operating the<br>
electrodes to detect atissue boundary is compared with another value to determine the<br>
presence of a tissue boundary.<br>
The present inventors have found that if the probe has been placed over a tissue boundary,<br>
the potential difference measured between electrodes 18 and 20 when a current is driven<br>
between electrodes 16 and 22 (the second mode of operation) is similar to that obtained<br>
when a current is driven between electrodes 16 and 18 and a potential measured between<br>
electrodes 20 and 22 (the first mode of operation), Therefore, in mis embodiment a<br>
comparison method is used to detect a tissue boundary, litis can give more accurate<br>
results because the theoretically ideal situation of a completely balanced system resulting in<br>
a zero potential difference may rarely occur in practice.<br><br>
WO 2006/129108<br><br>
PCT/GB2006/002026<br><br>
-10-<br>
The potential difference measured between electrodes 16 and 22 in the second mode of<br>
operation may be compared to a predetermined value representative of likely values of<br>
potential difference obtained when the probe is used for impedance measurement in the<br>
first mode of operation. Alternatively, the probe may first be used for impedance<br>
measurement, and the tissue boundary detection may make a comparison with the results<br>
obtained from operation in the first mode.<br>
If no tissue boundary is present, the value of potential difference measured in the second<br>
mode will be less than that of the first mode. The processor determines a tissue boundary<br>
is present if the potential difference measured in the second mode is greater than 50% of<br>
the value of the predetermined value or the value measured in the first mode. Changing<br>
this value can alter the sensitivity to a tissue boundary. In alternate embodiments which are<br>
more sensitive to a tissue boundary, it is determined that a tissue boundary is present if the<br>
potential difference meausured in the second mode is greater than 20 %, or alternatively<br>
greater than 10% of the predetermined value or the value measured in the first mode.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the electrodes can be arranged other than in a square,<br>
providing that there are first and second electrodes for driving a current between and third<br>
and fourth electrodes for measuring a potential difference arranged such that the third and<br>
fourth electrodes are each located substantially the same distance from bom the first and<br>
second electrodes. An example of such an arrangement is where the electrodes are placed<br>
at the corners of a kite shape (a quadrilateral which is symmetrical about one diagonal).<br>
In alternate embodiments more than tour electrodes can be provided. In these<br>
embodiments there must be two electrodes between which a current can be driven between<br>
and two electrodes for measuring potential spaced an equal distance from both of the two<br>
electrodes through which a current is driven. An example of an arrangement suitable for<br>
use with more than four electrodes is a regular hexagon.<br>
All of the above embodiments could be adapted to use the measured potential to calculate<br>
the transfer impedance between the electrodes 18 and 20 and the electrodes 16 and 22.<br>
This can be calculated from the ratio of the measured poteritial between electrodes 18 and<br><br>

20 to the amplitude of the current between electrodes 16 and 22. Likewise, the<br>
embodiments can be adapted to measure the current flowing between the electrodes 18 and<br>
20. In these cases, because the system is balanced, the value of the parameter measured<br>
will be zero or close to zero in an ideal theoretical situation. The method of comparing the<br>
values will also work in the same way as described for potential difference.<br><br>
