				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a system and device for preventing car thefts and more<br>
particularly to an improved method and apparatus for locking a motor vehicle.<br>
Many motor vehicles now employ locking systems that include a key which is not only<br>
keyed to a tumbler but which also carries a built-in transponder which works with a receiver<br>
mounted on the vehicle and normally as a part of the locking mechanism so as to contain a<br>
specific ID code. When the key is inserted into the locked cylinder, the transponder transmits<br>
a signal to the device and its ID is checked. If the proper ID is not registered, then it is<br>
impossible for the user to start the engine even if the key can be turned in the lock cylinder and<br>
thus, thefts are prevented.<br>
Although these types of locking mechanisms are extremely valuable in preventing<br>
thefts, because of the fact that they must continually recognize the presence of the key in the<br>
ignition system in an electrical manner, electrical malfunctions or noise in the electrical system<br>
can cause the triggering mechanism to disconnect. Even if a resetting function is included,<br>
during the interrupted time interval, the engine will stop running and this can be not only<br>
uncomfortable but has some potential risk.<br>
It is, therefore, a principal object to this invention to provide a locking system of this<br>
type wherein as long as an appropriate key has been switched on and remains in the ignition<br>
system, the engine will not stop running unless and until that key is positively shut off.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is adapted to be embodied in a method of preventing vehicle thefts and<br>
key locking system for a vehicle that comprises a key cylinder and controller that are mounted<br>
on the vehicle and a key which is insertable into the key cylinder for switching on a main<br>
switch for activating a prime mover of the vehicle. The key has a built-in transponder<br>
containing an ID code of the key to be sensed when the key is inserted into the key cylinder by<br>
the controller The operation of the prime mover is permitted only when the ID code detected<br>
by the transponder coincides with an ID code, which has been registered in the controller.<br>
In accordance with a method for performing the invention, power for operating the<br>
prime is held in an on condition until the recognized key is shut off regardless of the condition<br>
of the controller.<br>
In accordance with a key locking system of the type described, power operating the<br>
prime is held in an on condition until the recognized key is shut off regardless of the condition<br>
of the controller.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of preventing car thefts by means<br>
of a device comprising a key cylinder and a controller mounted on a vehicle body, a key<br>
insertable in said key cylinder for switching on a main switch, and a built-in transponder in said<br>
key for identifying an ID code of said key when said key is inserted in said key cylinder, starting<br>
of the engine being allowed when the ID code identified by said transponder coincides with an<br>
ID code which has been registered in said controller, said method comprising the steps of :<br>
reading an ID code of a key accessing to said key cylinder; determining whether or not the ID<br>
code read has been registered in a memory and outputting an ignition permission signal when<br>
the code has been already registered , holding said ignition permission signal in a holding<br>
circuit until said main switch is switched off ; and controlling the engine by an engine<br>
controlling means according to said ignition permission signal held in said holding circuit, said<br>
engine controlling means comprising an ignition circuit; wherein said ignition permission signal<br>
is directly input to said ignition circuit from said holding circuit.<br>
The present invention also provides a device for preventing car thefts comprising a key<br>
cylinder and a controller mounted on a vehicle body, a key insertable in said key cylinder for<br>
switching on a main switch, and a built-in transponder in said key for identifying an ID code of<br>
said key when said key is inserted in said key cylinder, starting of the engine being allowed<br>
when the ID code identified by said transponder coincides with an ID code which has been<br>
registered in said controller, said device being characterized by : a memory in which the ID<br>
code of said key is registered ; an ID reading circuit for reading an ID code of a key<br>
accessing to said key cylinder; an ID determination section for determining whether or not the<br>
ID code read by said ID reading circuit has been registered in said memory and for<br>
outputting an ignition permission signal when the code has been already registered ; a holding<br>
circuit for holding said ignition permission signal until said main switch is switched off; and an<br>
engine controlling means for controlling the engine according to said ignition permission signal<br>
held in said holding circuit, said engine controlling means comprising an ignition circuit ;<br>
wherein said ignition permission signal is directly input to the ignition circuit from said holding<br>
circuit.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now in detail to the drawings and initially to Figures 1 and 2, a key system<br>
incorporating the invention and operated in accordance with an embodiment of the invention<br>
is illustrated schematically in these figures. In Figure 1, the system is shown schematically in<br>
combination with a vehicle which is powered by a prime mover which is depicted<br>
schematically as an internal combustion engine, indicated generally by the reference numeral<br>
11 but can include other prime movers such as electric motors, fuel cells, etc. The vehicle<br>
may be a land vehicle such as a car or motorcycle or any other type of land, water or air<br>
vehicle.<br>
Basically, the operation of the prime mover 11 is controlled under a function of a<br>
locking system which includes a key, indicated by the reference numeral 12, and a key<br>
cylinder, indicated generally by the reference numeral 13. The key 12 basically includes a<br>
normally keyed portion 14 and a base portion in which a transponder 15 is mounted that has a<br>
built in ID code. The latter description will describe a number of keys such as a master key,<br>
sub-keys, and an all clear key, which have certain functions and which are utilized in<br>
accordance with the invention to permit and simplify the resetting a new master or sub-key<br>
either when the master key is replaced or the key cylinder is replaced.<br>
The key cylinder 13 in addition to having a normal tumbler section operated by the<br>
keying portion 14 of the key 12 also includes an ID signal reception device in the form of an<br>
antenna that sends and receives signals from the transponder 15 of the inserted key 12. This<br>
antenna then outputs its signal of the reading of the key ID code to a controller, indicted<br>
generally by the reference numeral 16, and which has a number of associated components<br>
including. One of these components is associaited with a main switch 17 that is operated by<br>
the key cylinder 13 upon the turning of the appropriate key therein in manners which will be<br>
described.<br>
The ID code is transmitted from the antenna coil of the key cylinder 13 to an ID<br>
reading circuit, indicated by the reference numeral 18, which outputs its signal to a CPU unit<br>
19. The CPU unit 19 determines the results of the comparison of the ID code of the inserted<br>
key with certain codes that have been memorized and other functions as set forth hereinafter.<br>
The CPU 19 also receives information from an Electronically Erasable Programmable<br>
Read Only Memory (EEPROM) indicated by the reference numeral 21, which stores certain<br>
ID codes in a manner, which will be described. Based upon the functioning of the rotation of<br>
the key 12 in the key cylinder 13, a power source circuit 22 is turned on to permit the main<br>
switch 17 to be activated and transmit a source of electrical power from a battery 23 to the<br>
controller 16.<br>
This also permits a signal to be sent from the CPU 19 to an ignition circuit 24 if the<br>
appropriate key has been utilized so as to permit energerization of a spark plug 25 of the<br>
engine 11. If an electrical motor is utilized as the prime mover, the ignition circuit 24 will<br>
comprise a switch for transmitting electrical power to the electric motor for its operation, for<br>
example by way of a pulse width modulation device, as a way of example.<br>
Additionally, the device may include a display section 26 that is mounted in an<br>
appropriate position on the associated vehicle for viewing by the operator and which displays<br>
certain information, as will become hereinafter described. These may comprise vehicle<br>
operating conditions such as speed and/or security conditions.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, this figure shows in more detail the units associated with<br>
the CPU and the controllers for controlling the operation of the prime mover 11. The antenna<br>
of the key cylinder 13 appears in this figure and is identified by the reference numeral 27,<br>
which, as aforenoted, outputs its signal to the ID reading circuit 18 of the controller 16. This<br>
output is then transmitted to the CPU 19 which includes an ID determination circuit 28 which<br>
decodes the ID signal from the transponder 15 to the antenna 27, an ID erasing section 29<br>
which functions to erase all ID"s from the volatile memory of the CPU 19, an ID registration<br>
section 31 which establishes a new ID registrations as recognized and approved IDs and an<br>
timer section 32, for a purpose which will be described.<br>
The power source circuit 22 includes a self-holding section 33, which maintains the<br>
power source on after the key operated main switch 17 is closed and then reopened after a<br>
predetermined time interval. As seen in this figure, the main switch 17 may be actually<br>
incorporated physically in the key cylinder 13. The controller 16 also includes a holding<br>
circuit 34 that functions to hold the ignition circuit 24 in an enabled mode for a time period<br>
after until the main switch 17 is opened after switching off the recognized key. This prevents<br>
uneven running which might otherwise occur in the event of electrical noise or if the source<br>
of current fluctuates.<br>
The EEPROM 21 is indicated at the memory in this figure.<br>
It should be noted that the ignition circuit 24 includes not only a device for permitting<br>
the operation of the prime mover 11 to be initiated assuming the right key is inserted and<br>
switched on, but also has the function of prohibiting starting or operation of the prime mover<br>
11 if the appropriate key has not been inserted and turned.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, this shows the various types of keys which are employed<br>
and the way in which they function both during initial registration of a master key and user<br>
registration of sub-keys as well as re-registration in the event a key is lost or in the event the<br>
key cylinder 13 is replaced or a new master key must be utilized for any reason.<br>
It has been previously mentioned that: there are all clear keys, master keys and sub-<br>
keys and each of these is shown with the all clear key being indicated by the reference<br>
numeral 12-1. This master key has a transponder but is not keyed so that it will not be able to<br>
turn in the key cylinder 13. A line registration master key 12-2 is also provided that in this<br>
embodiment, serves the function of both being capable of registered as a master key and also<br>
can be used for erasing or registering sub-keys. Also, this key can be utilized to erase all IDs<br>
upon lock replacement, as will be described. This key is keyed as at 14 so that it can be<br>
rotated in the key cylinder 13 in a manner, which will be described.<br>
The user registration keys include the master key 12-2 as previously described and<br>
two sub-keys (1 &amp; 2) indicated at 12-3 and 12-4. These keys 12-2, 12-3 and 12-4 all have<br>
the same key sections 14 but have different IDs in their respective transponders. Also, the<br>
sub-keys 12-3 and 12-4 do not have the capability of erasing data.<br>
The last portion of the upper part of this figure when proceeding from left to right,<br>
shows a situation where there is a re-registration of a key which has been lost and this lost<br>
key is the sub-key 12-4 and replaced by a new sub-key 12-5. The sub-key 12-5 is like all<br>
other sub-keys in its functioning and as previously described.<br>
Now referring to the bottom portion of this figure, the ignition unit memory is shown<br>
which includes, as noted in Figure 2, the main ignition unit 24 and the memory section 21<br>
that includes the EEPROM having the re-writable section and a fixed non-erasable section.<br>
The function of the all clear key is to clear all of the master and sub IDs maintained and this<br>
is operated by merely inserting the all clear key 12-1 into the ignition key cylinder 13. When<br>
this is done, all of the erasable memory erased while the all clear fixed data is maintained in<br>
place.<br>
The master key 12-2 is intended to be the master key retained by the owned and its<br>
insertion into the key cylinder 13 in the manner, which will be described hereinafter, causes<br>
the master key code to be memorized in the re-writable memory.<br>
Then, after this key has been inserted, then the sub-keys 1 and 2 (12-3 and 12-4) are<br>
inserted into the key cylinder 13 in the manner, which will be described, these keys are<br>
registered in the re-writable memory.<br>
In the re-registration of a key, which may be done after a key is lost, the master key is<br>
first inserted so to clear the memory of the previously registered sub-keys and then all sub-<br>
keys to be used can be registered. This will include re-registration of the sub-key 1 (12-3)<br>
and registration of a new sub-key 2 (12-5).<br>
The various control routines will now be described starting with Figure 4, which<br>
depicts the operation in ordinary use. It is assumed that the operator or owned of the vehicle<br>
will maintain the main key separately and will use one of the sub-keys for normal operation.<br>
Thus, the operation is as follows in that at the step SI, the main switch is switched on with a<br>
sub-key such as the sub-key 12-2 or 12-3. When this is done, the power source circuit 22 is<br>
energized at S2 and outputs electrically energy to the ID reading circuit 18 and the antenna of<br>
the key cylinder 13. The transponder is then energized and outputs its ID code, which is<br>
compared with the registered ID codes in the CPU 19 at the step S3. Then the comparison is<br>
made at the step S4 and if the inserted key has a registered key, then ignition is allowed by<br>
the ignition circuit 24 at the step S5 and the engine is started at the step S6 so as to be<br>
running. At this time the immobilizer section 35 of the display 26 (Figure 1) is not activated<br>
or illuminated<br>
If, however, at the step S4 it is determined that the inserted key number is not equal to<br>
a registered key number or it is not possible to read an ID of the inserted key, within<br>
5seconds after the switch is turned on, the program at the step S7 determines if this time limit<br>
has expired. If it has not, the program repeats and the immobilizer section 35 of the display<br>
26 is constantly illuminated.<br>
If, however, the time of 5 seconds has elapsed, and the significance of this time will<br>
become apparent later, then the program moves to the step S8 where ignition is prohibited<br>
and the step S9 where engine starting is disabled and the immobilizer display is flashed for a<br>
short time such as one second. Thus, in normal operation the system makes a comparison to<br>
confirm that the inserted and switched key is a registered key and if so, ignition and prime<br>
mover operation is initiated. If not within a predetermined time period such as the 5-second<br>
example given, it is impossible to start the prime mover 11 and the operator is warned.<br>
Figure 5 shows the control routine when the new master key is programmed in at the<br>
factory as indicated in the second view of Figure 3 or when a re-registration occurs at shown<br>
in the right hand of this figure.<br>
The first portion of the routine is the line registration of a new vehicle and it begins at<br>
the step S11 where the main switch is turned on with a master key. This is done after the all-<br>
clear key has been inserted and removed as noted in discussing the routine of Figure 3.<br>
When this master key 12-2 is placed into the key cylinder 13 and the master switch is turned<br>
on, at the step S12, the ID of the new key is read in by the ED reading circuit. The display 35<br>
is not illuminated at this time.<br>
At this time, the master data registers this new key in the EEPROM 21 and<br>
specifically in the fixed memory thereof at the step S13. Then, ignition or starting of the<br>
prime mover is enabled at the step S14. It may be that ignition is not possible immediately<br>
and several re-registrations may be made This is in part due to the necessity to initially charge<br>
the transponder 15 of the master key. Thus the display 35 is flashed slowly until registration<br>
is completed and then the display 35 is turned off.<br>
Then the main switch is turned off at the step S16 and this generally completes the<br>
original registration. However, there is a brief time delay when the holding circuit 33 (Figure<br>
22) maintains the supply of power. This is done for a period of time such as 10 seconds after<br>
the main switch is turned off. Thus, the unit power source is kept in a holding state.<br>
However, this time normally runs out under initial registration without any further<br>
registration.<br>
If, however, it is desired to register a new key, then after the main switch is turned off<br>
at the step S16 and the program moves to the step 17 to run the timer and determine if the 10-<br>
second time delay has elapsed. If it is, the program is shut off at the step S18 and no new<br>
registration can be made.<br>
If, however, at the step S17 it is determined that the main switch is still on and the 10-<br>
second run has not yet ran, the program moves to the step S19 to initiate the possibility for a<br>
re-registration to correct a mis-registration of the wrong main key. This is just one example<br>
of when a mis-registration can be taken care of.<br>
Then, at the step S19 if an all clear key such as the key 12-2 is inserted before the<br>
time of 10 seconds has ran out, the program moves to the step S20 so as to read the ID of the<br>
inserted key. If the ID of the inserted key is one that is pre-programmed into the fixed data,<br>
then at the step S21 all registered IDs are erased. The program then moves to the step S22<br>
where the all clear key is drawn out and the program moves back to the step S11 so as to<br>
permit the setting of a new main key. Thus, this procedure is utilized when there is a mis-<br>
registration of the main key on the original line registration.<br>
The routine for resetting the master key when the key cylinder 13 is replaced will now<br>
be described by particular reference to Figure 6. The program begins at the step S31 which is<br>
initiated when the main switch is switched on with a new key that is not registered. Then at<br>
the step S32 the ID of the inserted key is read by receiving the transmission signal from the<br>
transponder 15 to the communication circuit and the ID reading circuit 18.<br>
Then at the step S33 the ID of the inserted key is compared with the ID of the<br>
registered key or keys. The program then goes into a holding pattern where the timer sets a<br>
time interval of 5 seconds for after the main switch has been turned at the step S34 and an<br>
indication on the display 26 is given to indicate that the operation display section is<br>
illuminated continuously.<br>
If the 5-second interval has not passed, the program repeats back to the step S32. If,<br>
however, at the step S34 it is determined that the 5 second delay has run, then the program<br>
moves to the step S35 to prevent operation of the prime mover and the flashing light is turned<br>
on a relatively slow interval, such as 2 seconds.<br>
Then, if the main switch is turned off and the new key has been removed, at the step<br>
S36, the program moves to the step S37 to determine if a 10 second time interval has elapsed<br>
after the main switch 17 has been turned off. If it has been, the program moves to the step<br>
S38 and switches off the power source circuit 22.<br>
If, however, the time limit for the 10 seconds has not run out at the step S37, the<br>
program moves to the step S39 to determine if an all clear key or an old master is inserted. If<br>
it has not been, the program repeats back to the step S37 and continues until either the time<br>
limit has run and then the power is switched off at the step S38 or the insertion of a new key<br>
is again checked at the step S39.<br>
The program then moves to the step S49 if either the all-clear key or an old registered<br>
master key has been inserted where the ID of the inserted key is read in. Then the program<br>
moves to the step S41 so as to erase from the EEPROM 21 the ID codes of all registered IDs<br>
to be erased.<br>
Then, at the step S42 either the all-clear key or the old master key that has been<br>
inserted is withdrawn. Then the program moves to the step S43 where a new key to be<br>
registered is inserted. This can be one of the sub-keys. When this new key is inserted, the<br>
program moves to the step S44 wherein the ID of the new key is read. The program then<br>
moves to the step S45 so as to register the new key as the master key. The program then<br>
moves to the step S46 wherein ignition is allowed and subsequently at the step S47 the main<br>
switch will be turned off and the program stops.<br>
As has been previously noted, a condition may occur when electrically noise<br>
generated during vehicle running can cause the computer 19 to reset and restart the operation<br>
from the beginning. Also, this may occur due to temporary interruptions or variations in<br>
source voltage. In other words, if these conditions occur, it is necessary for the computer to<br>
again determine or verify the ID code of the key 12. This can result in engine misfiring for a<br>
short time period and/or a reduction in engine speed. Regardless, it will give an<br>
uncomfortable feeling to the vehicle and its occupants.<br>
Therefore, the holding circuit 34 is provided which maintains the ignition circuit 24 in<br>
an enabled condition until the inserted key is switched off due to its rotation in the locking<br>
cylinder. This routine may be seen in Figure 7, which is another flow diagram showing the<br>
operation. This program begins at the step S51 when the initial power source is turned on by<br>
switching on the main power source circuit 22. Then, if the ID reading circuit 18 indicates<br>
that the read ID is that which has been registered, the program makes this comparison at the<br>
step S52 and assuming that the key] is a correct one, the ignition circuit is enabled at the step<br>
S53. This signal is then held by the holding circuit 34 at the step S54. The program then<br>
moves to normal engine control at the step S55.<br>
During the normal engine control, the device continues to monitor the condition of the<br>
main switch 17 and as long as the key 12 is left in its on condition at determined at the step<br>
S56, the program continues to repeat. If, however, it is found that the key has been switched<br>
off at the step S56, turning off of the holding circuit 34 begins at the step S57. However,<br>
before this stopping is completed, the program moves to the step S58 to determine whether a<br>
predetermined time has elapsed after the switch has been turned off. This time can be set at<br>
any desired value. If, during this time, it is desired to reset the ID, this can be done in the<br>
manner previously described at the step S59. The power is then turned off at the step S60.<br>
and the engine is basically stopped at this time.<br>
The tables of Figures 8 and 9 show the various conditions of operation and summarize<br>
what has been previously stated. Since these figures are really self-explanatory, it is not<br>
believed necessary to repeat their descriptions and those skilled in the art will readily<br>
understand how these procedures are accomplished and what is done during the procedures.<br>
Thus, from the foregoing description, it should be readily apparent that a system has<br>
been disclosed and described that permits the setting of a new key and the register if all keys<br>
have been not initially registered or the updating of a system wherein the master switch is<br>
replaced and avoiding the necessity of creating a new key or modifying an existing key so as<br>
to match the ID of the new switch. Also, this permits the correction of mis-registrations<br>
without complicated procedures. Furthermore the system avoids the likelihood of uneven<br>
prime mover operation due to electrical noise or variations in the available electrical power.<br>
Of course, the foregoing description is that of preferred embodiments of the invention and<br>
various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope<br>
of the invention, as defined by the appended claims.<br>
