				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention concerns an anti-rolling device for vehicles and in particular an anti-rolling device for three and/or four-wheeled vehicles.<br>
It is well known that currently in the field of vehicles a substantial diversification of models has gradually been proposed, in particular there is a growing interest towards "hybrid" vehicles that combine the characteristics of motorcycles, in terms of handling, with the stability of four-wheeled vehicles. Such vehicles are, for example, represented by three-wheeled vehicles equipped with two steered front wheels and four-wheeled vehicles known by the name quad. The aforementioned three-wheeled vehicles can, advantageously, be driven like a motorcycle (in riding style) at the same time, however, offering the usual stability of four-wheeled vehicles.<br>
Such a vehicle is,- for example, described in Italian patent application IT2003MIA001108 to the same Applicant.<br>
In particular, such a vehicle is provided with two front steered wheels and with one rear wheel with fixed axis.<br>
Two independent suspensions are also foreseen, one for each of the two front wheels,  equipped with shock<br>
absorbers, also independent, and a front steer system based upon an articulated quadrilateral kinematism. Such a kinematism allows  the  front wheels,  during steering and/or "folding" operations of the motorcycle, to remain substantially adjacent to the ground. Due to the structural particularity of this type of vehicle  it  is  possible  that  in  particular  travel conditions, for example at very low speeds or during stops and parking, the vehicle can fall over precisely due to the rolling movement caused by the articulated quadrilateral.<br>
In light of the above, there is clearly a need to be able to provide an anti-rolling device, like that according to the present invention, which allows a vehicle to be provided equipped with the handling of a two-wheeled vehicle and with the stability of a four-wheeled vehicle.<br>
Therefore, the purpose of the present invention is that of solving the problems of the prior art providing an anti-rolling device for vehicles that is reliable and safe and that ensures the stability of the vehicle in any travel condition thereof.<br>
Another purpose of the present invention is that of providing an anti-rolling device for vehicles that is simple and cost-effective to produce. These and other purposes are accomplished by the anti-<br>
rolling device according to the present invention that has the characteristics of the attached claim 1, Further   characteristics   of   the   invention   are highlighted in the subsequent claims.<br>
Substantially, an anti-rolling device for vehicles of the type equipped with a front steer system with articulated quadrilateral structure and two independent front suspensions, according to the present invention, comprises at least one stop element, integral with an element of the quadrilateral structure in its rolling movements, at least one locking element, to lock the position of the stop element, preventing the rolling movements of the quadrilateral structure and a parking group, guided by control means, to control the locking element.<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention shall become clearer from the following description, given for illustrating and not limiting purposes, with reference to the attached drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 is a front view of a three-wheeled vehicle,<br>
without hull, equipped with the anti-rolling device<br>
according to the present invention;<br>
figure 2 is a perspective view of the vehicle of<br>
figure 1;<br>
figure 3 is a perspective view of the vehicle of<br>
figure 1 where the stop device of the stroke of the front suspensions is shown;<br>
figure 4 is a schematic view of the parking group according to the present invention;<br>
figure 5 is a top side schematic view of an alternative embodiment of the parking group according to the present invention;<br>
figure 6 is a schematic view of the parking group of figure 4 and of the hydraulic circuit of the anti-rolling device according to the present invention; figure 7 is a schematic view of the parking group of figure 5 and of the hydraulic circuit of the anti-rolling device according to the present invention; and<br>
figure 8 is a view of the stop device of the stroke of the suspensions according to the present invention. Hereafter, the description shall be aimed at the application onto a rolling three-wheeled vehicle with two steered front wheels and a rear wheel, but it is clear how it must not be considered to be limited to this specific use.<br>
The  vehicle  in  question,  wholly  indicated  with reference numeral 100, has two steered front wheels and one fixed rear wheel, as indicated in figures 1 and 2. The  two  front  wheels  are  each  equipped  with  an<br>
independent suspension 34, 35, in turn provided with an<br>
independent shock absorber 32, 33.<br>
The steering mechanism is based upon an articulated<br>
quadrilateral kinematic motion realised with two rigid<br>
horizontal cross members 41, 42, connected to the frame<br>
through cylindrical pins fixed to their middle, and two<br>
tubes 36, 37, arranged to the side of the horizontal<br>
cross members 41, 42 and connected to the independent<br>
front suspensions 34, 35.<br>
To avoid possible toppling over of the vehicle, which<br>
may occur, for example, when the vehicle is travelling<br>
below a certain speed or with zero rolling angle, an<br>
anti-rolling device 1 is provided according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
The anti-rolling device 1  is equipped with a stop<br>
element  2,   integral  with  an  element  of  the<br>
aforementioned kinematism in its rolling movements, a<br>
locking element 3 for locking the position of said stop<br>
element 2 and a parking group 4,  guided by control<br>
means 20 to control the locking element 3.<br>
The locking element 3, locking the position of the stop<br>
element with respect to the frame of the vehicle 100,<br>
prevents the movements of the articulated kinematism<br>
42,  41,  37,  36 and therefore the  rolling of  the<br>
vehicle.<br>
The  anti-rolling  device  according  to  the  present<br>
invention also has a stroke stop device 14, 14' for<br>
each of the  front  suspensions.  The  aforementioned<br>
parking group,  as well as acting upon the locking<br>
element 3, also acts upon the stroke stop devices 14,<br>
14' .<br>
The stop element is represented,  in the preferred<br>
embodiment shown in figures 1 and 2, by a ^'quarter"<br>
brake  disc  50,   integral  with  the  articulated<br>
quadrilateral 42, 41, 37, 36 and in particular with the<br>
upper cross member 41.<br>
The brake disc 50 thus follows the rolling movement of<br>
the quadrilateral and consequently of the vehicle 100.<br>
To lock the brake disc 2, a calliper 23 is foreseen,<br>
firmly attached to the frame of the vehicle 100, to<br>
acts as a locking element 3. The calliper 23 commanded<br>
open/closed by the parking group 4 closes on the brake<br>
disc 50 to block the rolling movement of the vehicle<br>
100.<br>
The parking group 4 also acts upon the stroke stop<br>
devices 14, 14' of the front suspensions 34, 35 and<br>
upon the brake-shoe 10 of the rear brake of the vehicle<br>
100.<br>
For such a purpose, the parking group 4 comprises a<br>
parking actuator 5 that acts upon a worm screw 19 to<br>
activate a pump 12 connected to a hydraulic system 13<br>
capable of commanding the locking element 2 and the<br>
stroke stop devices 14, 14'.<br>
The stroke stop devices 14, 14' of the front suspensions 34, 35 each comprise a shock absorber provided with two relatively slidable portions. By means of the support bracket 43 a pin 44 is kept integral with the shock absorber of the front suspension and in particular with its lower portion. At the opposite end of the shock absorber a brake calliper 45, complete with support bracket 46, is also kept integral with the shock absorber and in particular with its upper portion. The pin 44 slides between the brake-shoes 47. Upon the command of the parking device 5, by means of the oil pump 12 and of the hydraulic circuit 13, the brake-shoe 47 locks the pin 44 and, consequently, stops the stroke of the suspensions. The parking group 4, according to a preferred embodiment shown in figure 4, is equipped with a parking actuator 5 that acts upon a worm screw 19 which, transmitting the movement to an adapter pinion 21 (with determined transmission ratio), makes a pair of gears 24 and 25 move. The lever 7 is made to rotate by the gear 25, with which it is integral. In its movement the lever 7, through the "thruster" 7A, acts upon the oil pump 12 which, acting upon the hydraulic circuit 13, activates the locking systems both of the "quarter" brake disc 50 and of the locking<br>
devices 14, 14' of the front suspensions. The same lever 7 also acts upon the cam 6: this cam has the special characteristic of being able to be inserted, "ON" position, or withdrawn, ''OFF" position. The insertion or withdrawal of the cam takes place through a desmodromic control, not shown, activated, by a lever, button or other, by means of cables directly by the driver. In "ON" position the cam 6 acts upon a group of leverisms 16 that "pull" the cable of the rear brake 9 which, acting upon the brake-shoe 10 of the rear brake, places the rear wheel into locked position. This action allows there to be the blocking of rolling and the braking of the rear wheel simultaneously. It has been stated that the cam 6 also has an "OFF" position: such a condition is used to prevent the locking of the rear brake in the case in which one needs to move the vehicle with rolling lock inserted. Such a condition is activated by means of the release device 16 (various leverisms) which, upon the command of the rear brake lever 17, arranged on the handlebars, allows the rear brake calliper to detach itself from the lever 7 so as to actuate the rolling lock but not the rear brake lock.<br>
The lever 7 is shaped in such a way as to have a projection 7B that acts as a switch, in the sense that it acts upon a microswitch that sends the "roll lock"<br>
activated signal to the control unit that controls the system.<br>
An alternative solution for a different embodiment of the parking device 4 is described in figures 5 and 7. This alternative differs from the one described previously for the absence of the two gears that transmit the thrust of the worm screw 19 to the lever 7. The lever element 16, advantageously pivoted at 8, in turn commands, also in this embodiment, the brake-shoe of the rear brake 10, through the transmission cable 9.<br>
At the same time as the actuation of the lever element 16, operated by the cam 6, the actuator 5 acts, by means of the worm screw 19, upon the thrusters 7b of the lever 7, so as to actuate the pump 12 of the hydraulic circuit 13.<br>
In detail, the lever 7, also pivoted at 8, through a Belleville spring 15, actuates the pump 12 that activates the hydraulic circuit 13 for the locking of the brake disc 50 and of the stroke stop devices 14, 14' of the front suspensions 35, 34.<br>
A release device, acting upon the cam 6, allows the lever 7 to detach from the lever element 16 and in such a way it is possible, in some particular conditions (e.g. with the vehicle travelling at a high speed), to actuate just the brake-shoe 10 of the rear brake of the<br>
vehicle.<br>
The aforementioned actuator 5 can be of the mechanical<br>
or electromechanical  type  according to  the various<br>
design specifications.<br>
In the case of a mechanical actuator, it is actuated by<br>
suitable command means 20 represented by a lever or<br>
button arranged on the handlebars of the vehicle or a<br>
pedal lever.<br>
In particular, according to a first embodiment, the<br>
actuator command lever is arranged on the handlebars in<br>
place of the lever of the rear brake which in such a<br>
case shall be arranged as a pedal lever.<br>
In an alternative  embodiment,  the  actuator command<br>
lever is arranged as a pedal lever, whereas the two<br>
levers for the brakes, respectively front and rear, are<br>
arranged, in a conventional manner that is well known<br>
by the man skilled in the art, on the handlebars.<br>
In another embodiment, the actuator command lever is<br>
arranged centrally on the handlebars and is equipped<br>
with three levels respectively associated with: locking<br>
element 3 open, locking element 3 closed together with<br>
the stroke locking device 14, in stopping position, and<br>
just locking element 3 closed.<br>
Finally, in a further embodiment, the actuator command<br>
lever is arranged on the handlebars close to a brake<br>
lever, front or rear, but rotated with respect to it.<br>
In the case of a mechanical actuator 5, a safety device<br>
(not shown) is foreseen to limit the maximum speed of<br>
rotation of the motor with locking element 3 closed, in<br>
the case in which the driver forgets to disengage the<br>
anti-rolling device after setting off.<br>
On the other hand, in the case of an electromechanical<br>
actuator 5, this is controlled by an electrical control<br>
unit  (not  shown)  which,  according to  some  travel<br>
parameters of the vehicle, determines when to insert or<br>
withdraw the anti-rolling device.<br>
To  useful  parameters  for  determining  the  travel<br>
conditions of the vehicle could be the travel speed of<br>
the vehicle and the rolling angle.<br>
The first can be measured, for example, through one or<br>
more sensors arranged on the wheels and the second<br>
through  an  angular  potentiometer  arranged  on  the<br>
articulated quadrilateral.<br>
In the case of an electromechanical actuator a button<br>
(not directly shown) is also foreseen to actuate the<br>
screw 19 and therefore the device 1 at the driver's<br>
discretion.<br>
In  both  cases,  mechanical  or  electromechanical<br>
actuator,  a sensor is foreseen that is capable of<br>
detecting anomalies in the system and indicating them,<br>
through an optical indicator, such as a warning light<br>
arranged on the handlebars, to the driver.<br>
The present invention has been described for illustrating, but not limiting purposes, according to its preferred embodiments, but it should be understood that variations and/or modifications can be brought by men skilled in the art without for this reason departing from the relative scope of protection, as defined by the attached claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
