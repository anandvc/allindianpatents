METHOD AND CATALYST FOR PRODUCING A CRUDE PRODUCT HAVING A REDUCED MCR CONTENT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to systems, methods, and catalysts for treating crude feed. More particularly, certain embodiments described herein relate to systems, methods, and catalysts for conversion of a crude feed to a total product, wherein the total product includes a crude product that is a liquid mixture at 25 °C and 0.101 MPa, and has one or more properties that are changed relative to the respective property of the crude feed. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Crudes that have one or more unsuitable properties that do not allow the crudes to be economically transported, or processed using conventional facilities, are commonly referred to as "disadvantaged crudes".<br>
Disadvantaged crudes may include acidic components that contribute to the total acid number ("TAN") of the crude feed. Disadvantaged crudes with a relatively high TAN may contribute to corrosion of metal components during transporting and/or processing of the disadvantaged crudes. Removal of acidic components from disadvantaged crudes may involve chemically neutralizing acidic components with various bases. Alternately, corrosion-resistant metals may be used in transportation equipment and/or processing equipment The use of corrosion-resistant metal often involves significant expense, and thus, the use of corrosion-resistant metal in existing equipment may not be desirable. Another method to inhibit corrosion may involve addition of corrosion inhibitors to disadvantaged crudes before transporting and/or processing of the disadvantaged crudes. The use of corrosion inhibitors may negatively affect equipment used to process the crudes and/or the quality of products produced from the crudes.<br>
Disadvantaged crudes often contain relatively high levels of residue. Disadvantaged crudes having high levels of residue tend to be difficult and expensive to transport and/or process using conventional facilities.<br>
Disadvantaged crudes often contain organically bound heteroatoms (for example, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen). Organically bound heteroatoms may, in some situations, have an adverse effect on catalysts used to process disadvantaged crudes.<br><br>
Disadvantaged crudes may include relatively high amounts of metal contaminants, for example, nickel, vanadium, and/or iron. During processing of such crudes, metal contaminants and/or compounds of metal contaminants, may deposit on a surface of the catalyst or in the void volume of the catalyst Such deposits may cause a decline in the activity of the catalyst.<br>
Disadvantaged crudes may have components that contribute coke and/or to thermal degradation of the disadvantaged crude. The coke and/or thermally degraded components may form and/or deposit on catalyst surfaces at a rapid rate during processing of disadvantaged crudes. It may be costly to regenerate the catalytic activity of a catalyst contaminated with coke and/or thermally degraded crude. Additionally, high temperatures used during regeneration of a catalyst may also diminish the activity of the catalyst and/or cause the catalyst to deteriorate.<br>
Disadvantaged crudes may include metals (for example, calcium, potassium and/or sodium) in metal salts of organic acids. Metals in metal salts of organic acids are not typically separated from disadvantaged crudes by conventional production processing, for example, desalting and/or acid washing.<br>
Problems are often encountered in conventional catalytic processing of crudes when metals in metal salts of organic acids are present. In contrast to nickel and vanadium, which typically deposit near the external surface of the catalyst, metals in metal salts of organic acids may deposit preferentially in void volumes between catalyst particles, particularly at the top of the catalyst bed. The deposit of contaminants, for example, metals in metal salts of organic acids, at the top of the catalyst bed, generally results in an increase in pressure drop through the bed and may effectively plug the bed. Moreover, the metals in metal salts of organic acids may cause rapid deactivation of catalysts.<br>
Disadvantaged crudes may include organic oxygen compounds. Treatment facilities that process disadvantaged crudes with an oxygen content of at least 0.002 grams of oxygen per gram of disadvantaged crude may encounter problems during processing. Organic oxygen compounds, when heated during processing, may form higher oxidation compounds (for example, ketones and/or acids formed by oxidation of alcohols, and/or acids formed by oxidation of ethers) that are difficult to remove from the treated crude and/or may corrode/contaminate equipment during processing and cause plugging in transportation lines.<br><br>
Disadvantaged crudes may include hydrogen deficient hydrocarbons. When processing hydrogen deficient hydrocarbons, consistent quantities of hydrogen generally need to be added, particularly if unsaturated fragments resulting from cracking processes are produced. Hydrogenation during processing, which typically involves the use of an active hydrogenation catalyst, may be needed to inhibit unsaturated fragments from forming coke. Hydrogen is costly to produce and/or costly to transport to treatment facilities.<br>
Disadvantaged crudes also tend to exhibit instability during processing in conventional facilities. Crude instability tends to result in phase separation of components during processing and/or formation of undesirable by-products (for example, hydrogen sulfide, water, and carbon dioxide).<br>
Conventional processes for treating disadvantaged crudes may reduce the amount of components that contribute to high viscosity, thermal degradation of the disadvantaged crude, and/or coking. Removal of these components, however, may cause instability in the crude, thus causing separation of the crude during transportation. During conventional processing, components that contribute to high viscosity and/or coking are typically removed when the crude is treated with a catalyst that has a large pore size, a high surface area, and a low hydrotreating activity. The resulting crude may then be further treated to remove other unwanted components in the crude.<br>
Some processes for improving the quality of crude include adding a diluent to disadvantaged crudes to lower the weight percent of components contributing to the disadvantaged properties. Adding diluent, however, generally increases costs of treating disadvantaged crudes due to the costs of diluent and/or increased costs to handle the disadvantaged crudes. Addition of diluent to a disadvantaged crude may, in some situations, decrease stability of such crude.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 6,547,957 to Sudhakar et aL; 6,277,269 to Myers pt aL; 6,203,695 to Harle et aL; 6,063,266 to Grande et aL; 5,928,502 to Bearden et aL; 5,914,030 to Bearden et aL; 5,897,769 to Trachte et aL; 5,744,025 to Boon et aL; 4,212,729 to Hensley, Jr., and 4,048,060 to Riley, and U.S. Patent AppUcationPublication No. US 2004/0106516 to Schulz et al. describe various processes, systems, and catalysts for processing crudes. The processes, systems, and catalysts described in these patents, however, have limited applicability because of many of the technical problems set forth above.<br><br>
In sum, disadvantaged crudes generally have undesirable properties (for example, relatively high TAN, a tendency to become unstable during treatment, and/or a tendency to consume relatively large amounts of hydrogen during treatment). Disadvantaged crudes may also include relatively high amounts of undesirable components (for example, components that contribute to thermal degradation, residue, organically bound heteroatoms, metal contaminants, metals in metal salts of organic acids, and/or organic oxygen compounds). Such properties and components tend to cause problems in conventional transportation and/or treatment facilities, including increased corrosion, decreased catalyst life, process plugging, and/or increased usage of hydrogen during treatment. Thus, there is a significant economic and technical need for improved systems, methods, and/or catalysts for conversion of disadvantaged crudes into crude products with more desirable properties. There is also a significant economic and technical need for systems, methods, and/or catalysts that can change selected properties in a disadvantaged crude while minimizing changes to other properties in the disadvantaged crude.

Treatment of disadvantaged crudes may enhance the properties of the disadvantaged crudes such that the crudes are acceptable for transportation and/or treatment A crude and/or disadvantaged crude that is to be treated herein is referred to as "crude feed". The crude feed may be topped, as described herein. The crude feed may be obtainable by, but is not limited to, methods as described herein. The crude product resulting from treatment of the crude feed, as described herein, is generally suitable for transporting and/or treatment. Properties of the crude product produced as described herein are closer to the corresponding properties of West Texas<br><br>
Intermediate crude than the crude feed, or closer to the corresponding properties of Brent crude, than the crude feed, thereby enhancing the economic value of the crude feed. Such crude product may be refined with less pre-treatment than other crude products from disadvantaged crude feeds, or no pre-treatment, thereby enhancing refining efficiencies. Pre-treatment may include desulfurization, demetallization and/or atmospheric distillation to remove impurities.<br>
Treatment of a crude feed in accordance with inventions described herein may include contacting the crude feed with the catalyst(s) in a contacting zone and/or combinations of two or more contacting zones. In a contacting zone, at least one property of a crude feed may be changed by contact of the crude feed with one or more catalysts relative to the same property of the crude feed. In some embodiments, contacting is performed in the presence of a hydrogen source. In some embodiments, the hydrogen source is one or more hydrocarbons that under certain contacting conditions react to provide relatively small amounts of hydrogen to compound(s) in the crude feed.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic of contacting system 100 that includes an upstream contacting zone 102. The crude feed enters upstream contacting zone 102 via crude feed conduit 104. A contacting zone may be a reactor, a portion of a reactor, multiple portions of a reactor, or combinations thereof. Examples of a contacting zone include a stacked bed reactor, a fixed bed reactor, an ebullating bed reactor, a continuously stirred tank reactor ("CSTR"), a fluidized bed reactor, a spray reactor, and a liquid/liquid contactor. In certain embodiments, the contacting system is on or coupled to an offshore facility. Contact of the crude feed with the catalyst(s) in contacting system 100 may be a continuous process or a batch process.<br>
The contacting zone may include one or more catalysts (for example, two catalysts). In some embodiments, contact of the crude feed with a first catalyst of the two catalysts may reduce metals in metal salts of organic acids of the crude feed. Subsequent contact of the crude feed having reduced metal salts with the second catalyst may decrease MCR content and/or heteroatoms content.

The carrier gas may facilitate flow of the crude feed and/or flow of the hydrogen source in the contacting zone(s). The carrier gas may also enhance mixing in the contacting zone(s). In some embodiments, a hydrogen source (for example, hydrogen, methane or ethane) may be used as a carrier gas and recirculated through the contacting zone.<br>
The hydrogen source may enter upstream contacting zone 102 co-currently with the crude feed in crude feed conduit 104 or separately via gas conduit 106. In upstream contacting zone 102, contact of the crude feed with a catalyst produces a total product that<br><br>
includes a crude product, and, in some embodiments, gas. In some embodiments, a carrier gas is combined with the crude feed and/or the hydrogen source in conduit 106. The total product may exit upstream contacting zone 102 and enter downstream separation zone 108 via total product conduit 110.<br>

Such surface area may be in a range from about 100 m2/g to about 300 m2/g, about 120 m2/g to about 270 m2/g, about 130 m2/g to about 250 m2/g, or about 170 m2/g to about 220 m2/g. In certain embodiments, a surface area of a shaped bulk metal catalyst is at least 30 m2/g, at least 60 m2/g, or in a range from about 10 m2/g to about 350 m2/g.<br>
In some embodiments, the bulk metal catalyst, the supported catalyst and/or the catalyst precursor is sulfided to form metal sulfides (prior to use) using techniques known in the art (for example, ACTICAT™ process, CRI International, Inc.). In some embodiments, the catalyst(s) and/or catalyst precursor may be dried then sulfided. Alternatively, the catalyst(s) or catalyst precursor may be sulfided in situ by contact of the catalyst or catalyst precursor with a crude feed that includes sulfur-containing compounds. In-situ sulfurization may utilize either gaseous hydrogen sulfide in the presence of hydrogen, or liquid-phase sulfurizing agents such as organosulfur compounds (including alkylsulfides, polysulfides, thiols, and sulfoxides). Ex-situ sulfurization processes are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,468,372 to Seamans et al. and 5,688,736 to Seamans et al.<br>
In certain embodiments, a first type of catalyst ("first catalyst") includes Columns 5-10 metal(s) in combination with a theta alumina support. The first catalyst has a pore size distribution with a median pore diameter of at least 180 A, at least 220 A, at least 230 A, at least 250 A, at least 300 A, or at most 500 A. The support may include at least 0.1<br><br>
grams, at least 0.5 grams, or at least 0.9 grams, or at most 0.999 grams of theta alumina per gram of support. In some embodiments, the support has an alpha alumina content of below 0.1 grams of alpha alumina per gram of catalyst. The catalyst includes, in some embodiments, at most 0.1 grams of Column 6 metal(s) per gram of catalyst and at least 0.0001 grams of Column 6 metal(s) per gram of catalyst In some embodiments, the Column 6 metal(s) are molybdenum and/or tungsten. In some embodiments, a first catalyst may include Column 5 metal(s). The first catalyst may allow for removal of alkali metals and alkaline-earth metals in metal salts of organic acids. The first catalyst is generally capable of removing at least a portion of the alkali metals and/or alkaline-earth metal salts of organic acids, which may reduce viscosity and/or surface tension of the crude feed. This may allow the resulting crude feed to be more readily contacted with catalysts positioned after the first catalyst<br>
In certain embodiments, a second type of catalyst ("second catalyst") includes Columns 6-10 metal(s) in combination with a support. The second catalyst has a median pore diameter of greater than 110 A. The second catalyst has pores with a pore diameter of at least 350 A, which provide at most 10% of the pore volume of the second catalyst The second catalyst has per gram of second catalyst, in some embodiments, a total content of Column 6 metal(s) in a range from about 0.0001 grams to about 0.3 grams, a total content of Columns 7-10 metal(s) in a range from about 0.0001 grams to about 0.1 grams, and a total content of Column 15 element(s) in a range from about 0.00001 grams to about 0.1 grams. In certain embodiments, the second catalyst support has, per gram of support, at least 0.9 grams of gamma alumina. The second catalyst is generally capable of: removing at least a portion of the components from the crude feed that contribute to thermal degradation as measured by MCR; removing at least a portion of organic nitrogen containing compounds; and removing at least a portion of the C5 asphaltenes from the crude feed. The second catalyst, in some embodiments, also removes at least a portion of the residue, removes at least a portion of the Ni/Fe/V, removes at least a portion of the components that contribute to high viscosities, and/or removes at least a portion of the components that contribute to low API gravity.<br>
In some embodiments, a third type of catalyst ('third catalyst") may have a median pore diameter of about 250 A. The third catalyst has pores with a pore diameter of at least 350 A, which provide at most 10% of the pore volume of the third catalyst The third catalyst is generally capable of: removing at least a portion of the components from the<br><br>
crude feed that contribute to thermal degradation as measured by MCR; removing a portion of compounds containing heteroatoms; and/or removing a portion of the C5 asphaltenes from the crude feed. The third catalyst, in some embodiments, also removes components that contribute to high viscosities and/or low API gravity.<br>
In some embodiments, the second catalyst(s) and third catalyst(s) have selected median pore diameters and pores having selected pore diameters providing at most 10%, at most 5%, at most 3% or at most 1% of the pore volume. These catalysts provide enhanced reduction of C5 asphaltenes content in the crude feed and/or reduction of at least a portion of the components that contribute to thermal degradation of the crude feed as measured by MCR. Reduction of these compounds using catalysts with selected median pore diameter and selected pore volume may allow the number of catalysts to be minimized. Typically, the crude feed is first treated with a conventional catalyst having relatively low catalytic activity to remove C5 asphaltenes and/or components that contribute to thermal degradation. These types of conventional catalysts generally remove the C5 asphaltenes and/or other components by allowing a relatively large portion of the C5 asphaltenes and/or other components to enter the pores of the catalysts and fill the pores. As the pores are filled, the C5 asphaltenes and/or other components may be physically removed from the crude feed. Once the pores are filled and/or plugged, the life of the conventional catalyst becomes diminished. Catalysts with selected median pore diameter and selected pore volumes remove C5 asphaltenes and/or other components that contribute to thermal degradation by limiting the portion, if any, of C5 asphaltenes and/or other components that enter the pores of the catalyst. As such, the life of the catalyst may not be diminished due to contact of the catalyst with C5 asphaltenes and/or other components.<br>
In some embodiments, the second catalyst(s) and/or the third catalyst(s) may remove at least a portion of the alkali metals and alkaline-metals in metal salts of organic acids. In certain embodiments, the second catalyst(s) and/or the third catalyst(s) are capable of removing at least a portion of the alkali metals and/or alkaline-earth metal salts of organic acids that contribute to formation of compounds that increase viscosity and/or surface tension of the crude feed. In some embodiments, the second catalyst(s) and/or the third catalyses) are capable of removing at least a portion of the components that contribute to relatively high viscosity of the crude feed.<br>
In some embodiments, a fourth type of catalyst ("fourth catalyst") may be obtainable by combining a support with Column 6 metal(s) to produce a catalyst precursor.<br><br>
Typically, the catalyst precursor is heated to at least 100 °C for about 2 hours. In certain embodiments, the fourth catalyst(s) may have, per gram of fourth catalyses), a Column 15 elements) content in a range from about 0.001 grams to about 0.03 grams, 0.005 grams to about 0.02 grams, or 0.008 grams to about 0.01 grams. The fourth catalyst(s) may exhibit significant activity and stability when used to treat the crude feed as described herein. In some embodiments, the catalyst precursor is heated at temperatures below 500 °C in the presence of one or more sulfur compounds. The fourth catalyst(s) is (are) generally capable of removing a portion of nitrogen containing compounds from the crude feed. Removal of nitrogen containing compounds decreases the corrosive properties of the crude product relative to the corrosive properties of the crude feed. The fourth catalyst(s) may remove at least a portion of the components that contribute to the TAN of the crude feed, remove at least a portion of the metals in metal salts of organic acids, remove at least a portion of the Ni/V/Fe, and/or remove at least a portion of components contributing to a high viscosity of the crude feed.<br>
The fourth catalyst(s), in some embodiments, may also reduce at least a portion of the MCR content of the crude feed, while maintaining crude feed/total product stability. In certain embodiments, the fourth catalyst(s) may have a Column 6 metal(s) content in a range from about 0.0001 grams to about 0.1 grams, about 0.005 grams to about 0.05 grams, or about 0.001 grams to about 0.01 grams and a Column 10 metal(s) content in a range from about 0.0001 grams to about 0.05 grams, about 0.005 grams to about 0.03 grams, or about 0.001 grams to about 0.01 grams per gram of fourth catalyst(s). The fourth catalyst(s) may facilitate reduction of at least a portion of the components that contribute to MCR in tile crude feed at temperatures in a range from about 300 °C to about 500 °C or about 350 °C to about 450 °C and pressures in a range from about 0.1 MPa to about 20 MPa, about 1 MPa to about 10 MPa, or about 2 MPa to about 8 MPa.<br>
In certain embodiments, a fifth type of catalyst ("fifth catalyst") may be a bulk metal catalyst. The fifth catalyses) includes at least 0.3 grams of Columns 6-10 metal(s) per gram of fifth catalyses). In certain embodiments, the fifth catalyst(s) also includes the binder. The fifth catalyst(s), in some embodiments, includes Column 6 metal(s) in combination with Column 9 metal(s) and/or Column 10 metal(s). The fifth catalyst(s) is generally capable of removing at least a portion of the components that contribute to thermal degradation as measured by MCR. The fifth catalyst(s), in some embodiments, is also capable of removing at least a portion of C5 asphaltenes, at least a portion of organic<br><br>
compounds containing heteroatoms, at least a portion of the total Ni/V/Fe content, at least a portion of the components that contribute to high viscosity, and/or at least a portion of the components that contribute to low API gravity.<br>
The first catalyst(s), second catalyses), third catalyst(s), fourth catalyst(s), and fifth catalyst(s), may be stable for at least 3 months, at least 6 months or at least 1 year at temperatures of at least 370 °C, at least 380 °C, at least 390 °C, at least 400 °C, or at least 420 °C, and pressures of at least 8 Nm3/m3, at least 10 Nm3/m3, or at least 14 Nm3/m3 during contact with the crude feed.<br>
In some embodiments, the crude feed may be contacted with an additional catalyst subsequent to contact with the first catalyst The additional catalyst may be one or more of the following: the second catalyst, the third catalyst, the fourth catalyst, the fifth catalyst, the commercial catalysts described herein, or combinations thereof.<br>
Other embodiments of the first catalyst(s), second catalyst(s), third catalyst(s), fourth catalyst(s), and fifth catalyst(s) may also be made and/or used as is otherwise described herein.<br>
Selecting the catalyst(s) of this application and controlling operating conditions may allow a crude product to be produced that has a MCR content, a nitrogen content, a content of metals in metal salts of organic acids, and/or selected properties changed relative to the crude feed. The resulting crude product may have enhanced properties relative to the crude feed and, thus, be more acceptable for transporting and/or refining.<br>
Arrangement of two or more catalysts in a selected sequence may control the sequence of property improvements for the crude feed. For example, metals in metal salts of organic acids in the crude feed can be reduced before at least a portion of the components contributing to MCR and/or heteroatoms in the crude feed are reduced.<br>
Arrangement and/or selection of the catalysts may, in some embodiments, improve lives of the catalysts and/or title stability of the crude feed/total product mixture. Improvement of a catalyst life and/or stability of the crude feed/total product mixture during processing may allow a contacting system to operate for at least 3 months, at least 6 months, or at least 1 year without replacement of the catalyst in the contacting zone. A life of the catalyst may be determined by measuring the temperature change of the contacting zone over a period of time (for example, one month, two months, three months, six months, and/or one year), while other contacting conditions remain relatively constant such that certain product specifications are maintained. A requirement for an increase in the<br><br>
temperature of about 15 °C, about 13 °C, or about 10 °C above the initial temperature required for processing, may indicate that the effectiveness of the catalyst is diminished.<br>
Combinations of selected catalysts may allow reduction in at least a portion of the MCR content, at least a portion of the Ni/V/Fe, at least a portion of the C5 asphaltenes, at least a portion of the metals in metal salts of organic acids, at least a portion of the components that contribute to TAN, at least a portion of the residue, or combinations thereof from the crude feed before other properties of the crude feed are changed, while maintaining the stability of the crude feed/total product mixture during processing (for example, maintaining a crude feed P-value of above 1.5). Alternatively, C5 asphaltenes, TAN, and/or API gravity may be incrementally reduced by contact of the crude feed with t selected catalysts. The ability to incrementally and/or selectively change properties of the crude feed may allow the stability of the crude feed/total product mixture to be maintained during processing.<br>
The first catalyst allows, in some embodiments, for removal of at least a portion of metals in metal salts of organic acids from the crude feed. For example, reducing at least a portion of the metals in metal salts of organic acids in the crude feed/total product mixture relative to the crude feed inhibits plugging of other catalysts positioned downstream, and thus, increases the length of time the contacting system may be operated without replenishment of catalyst. Removal of at least a portion of the metals in metal salts of organic acids from the crude feed may, in some embodiments, increase a life of one or more catalysts positioned after the first catalyst<br>
The second catalyst(s), the third catalyses), and/or the fourth catalyst(s) may be positioned downstream of the first catalyst Further contact of the crude feed/total product mixture with the second catalyses), third catalyses), and/or the fourth catalyst(s) may reduce MCR content, reduce the content of Ni/V/Fe, reduce sulfur content, reduce oxygen content, reduce viscosity, and/or further reduce the content of metals in metal salts of organic acids.<br>
In some embodiments, the fifth catalyst(s) may be positioned downstream of commercial catalysts. The commercial catalysts may be used to remove at least a portion of the Ni/V/Fe in a crude feed. Further contact of the crude feed/total product mixture with the fifth catalyst(s) may reduce MCR content, reduce sulfur content, reduce nitrogen content, and/or reduce oxygen content<br><br>
In some embodiments, catalyst selection and/or order of catalysts in combination with controlled contacting conditions (for example, temperature and/or crude feed flow rate) may assist in reducing hydrogen uptake by the crude feed, maintaining crude feed/total product mixture stability during processing, and changing one or more properties of the crude product relative to the respective properties of the crude feed. Stability of the crude feed/total product mixture may be affected by various phases separating from the crude feed/total product mixture. Phase separation may be caused by, for example, insolubility of the crude feed and/or crude product in the crude feed/total product mixture, flocculation of asphaltenes from the crude feed/total product mixture, precipitation of components from the crude feed/total product mixture, or combinations thereof.<br>
At certain times during the contacting period, the concentration of crude feed and/or total product in the crude feed/total product mixture may change. As the concentration of, the total product in the crude feed/total product mixture changes due to formation of the crude product, solubility of the components of the crude feed and/or components of the total product in the crude feed/total product mixture tends to change. For example, the crude feed may contain components that are soluble in the crude feed at the beginning of processing. As properties of the crude feed change (for example, TAN, MCR, C5 asphaltenes, P-value, or combinations thereof), the components may tend to become less soluble in the crude feed/total product mixture. In some instances, the crude feed and the total product may form two phases and/or become insoluble in one another. Solubility changes may also result in the crude feed/total product mixture forming two or more phases. Formation of two phases, through flocculation of asphaltenes, change in concentration of crude feed and total product, and/or precipitation of components, tends to reduce the life of one or more of the catalysts. Additionally, the efficiency of the process may be reduced. For example, repeated treatment of the crude feed/total product mixture may be necessary to produce a crude product with desired properties.<br>
During processing, the P-value of the crude feed/total product mixture may be monitored and the stability of the process, crude feed, and/or crude feed/total product mixture may be assessed. Typically, a P-value that is at most 1.5 indicates that flocculation of asphaltenes from the crude feed generally occurs. If the P-value is initially at least 1.5, and such P-value increases or is relatively stable during contacting, then this indicates that the crude feed is relatively stabile during contacting. Crude feed/total product mixture stability, as assessed by P-value, may be controlled by controlling contacting conditions,<br><br>
by selection of catalysts, by selective ordering of catalysts, or combinations thereof. Such controlling of contacting conditions may include controlling LHSV, temperature, pressure, hydrogen uptake, crude feed flow, or combinations thereof.<br>
Catalysts described herein may facilitate reduction of MCR content and viscosity at elevated temperatures and pressures while maintaining the stability of the crude feed/total product mixture and/or maintaining the lives of the catalysts.<br>
In some embodiments, contacting conditions are controlled such that temperatures in one or more contacting zones may be different Operating at different temperatures allows for selective change in crude feed properties while maintaining the stability of the crude feed/total product mixture. The crude feed enters a first contacting zone at the start of a process. A first contacting temperature is the temperature in the first contacting zone. Other contacting temperatures (for example, second temperature, third temperature, fourth temperature, et cetera) are the temperatures in contacting zones that are positioned after the first contacting zone. A first contacting temperature may be in a range from about 100 ° C to about 420 °C and a second contacting temperature may be in a range that is about 20 °C to about 100 °C, about 30 ° C to about 90 °C, or about 40 ° C to about 60 °C different than the first contacting temperature. In some embodiments, the second contacting temperature is greater than the first contacting temperature. Having different contacting temperatures may reduce TAN and/or C5 asphaltenes content in a crude product relative to the TAN and/or the C5 asphaltenes content of the crude feed to a greater extent than the amount of TAN and/or C5 asphaltene reduction, if any, when the first and second contacting temperatures are the same as or within 10 °C of each other.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Non-limiting examples of support preparations, catalyst preparations, and systems with selected arrangement of catalysts and controlled contacting conditions are set forth below.<br>
Example 1, Preparation of a Catalyst Support An alumina/silica support was prepared by mulling 550 grams of an alumina/silica mixture, 26 grams of calcined alumina fines, 585 grams of water, and 8 grams of 16M nitric acid for 35 minutes. The alumina/silica mixture was prepared by combining at least 0,98 grams of alumina/silica mixture (Criterion Catalysts and Technologies LP) per gram of support with up to 0.02 grams of silica (Criterion Catalysts and Technologies LP) per gram of alumina/silica mixture. The mulled mixture was extruded through 1.94 mm and 3.28 mm diameter die plates, and then<br><br>
heat-treated at a temperature in a range from 93 °C (200 °F) to 121 °C (250 °F) until a loss on ignition in a range of 27 wt% to 30 wt%, based on initial extrudate weight, was obtained. Loss on ignition was performed by heating the extrudates to 540 °C for 15 minutes to 50 minutes, and then determining the relative amount of weight lost by the extrudates. The extrudates were further heat-treated at 918 °C (1685 °F) for 1 hour. The support had an average pore diameter of 125 A, a surface area of 281 m2/g, a pore volume of 0.875 cm3/g, and pores with a diameter of at least 350 A, which provided 0.9% of the total pore volume of the support. Example 1 demonstrates preparation of a support that has an average pore diameter of at least 90 A and pores having apore diameter of at least 350 A provide at most 15% of the pore volume of the support<br>
Example 2. Preparation of a Catalyst having a Median Pore Diameter of 115 A and a Selected Pore Volume Distribution. A catalyst was prepared as follows. An alumina/silica support prepared as described in Example 1 was impregnated with a molybdenum/nickel/phosphorus impregnation solution prepared as follows. A first solution was made by combining 62.34 grams of (NE4)2Mo2O7, 17.49 grams of M0O3, 12.22 grams of 30% H2O2, and 50.47 grams of deionized water to form a slurry. MEA (3.0 grams) was added to the slurry at a rate sufficient to control the exotherm of dissolution. The slurry was heated to 64 °C (147 °F) until the solids dissolved, and then cooled to room temperature. The pH of the first solution was 5.34.<br>
A second solution was made by combining 8.2 grams of Ni(NO3)2.6H20 and 5.47 grams of MCO3 with 30.46 grams of deionized water, and then adding 29.69 grams of 85 wt%H3PO4- The pH of the second solution was 0.29. The first solution and second solution were combined, and sufficient deionized water was added to bring the combined solution volume up to 218.75 mL to yield the molybdenum/nickel/phosphorus impregnation solution. The pH of the impregnation solution was 2.02.<br>
The support (200.0 grams) was combined with the impregnation solution and aged for several hours with occasional agitation. The resulting support/metal mixture was heat-treated at 125 °C for several hours, and then heat-treated at 482 °C (900 °F) for 2 hours. The resulting catalyst contained, per gram of catalyst, 0.13 grams of molybdenum, 0.03 grams of nickel, and 0.03 grams of phosphorus with the balance being support. The catalyst had a pore size distribution with a median pore diameter of 115 A with 66.7% of<br>
the total number of pores having a pore diameter within 28 A of the median pore diameter.<br>
1<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 1, the pores of the catalyst having a pore diameter of at least of 350 A provided 1.71% of the total pore volume of the catalyst<br>
Example 2 demonstrates preparation of the Column 6 metal catalyst having a pore size distribution with a median pore diameter of greater than 110 A, and a pore volume in which pores having a pore diameter of at least 350 A provide at most 10% of the total pore volume. This example also demonstrates preparation of the Column 6 metal catalyst from a support having an average pore diameter of at least 90 A, and a pore volume in which pores having a pore diameter of at least 350 A provide at most 15% of the total pore volume.<br>
Example 3. Contact of a Crude Feed With Two Catalysts. A tubular reactor with a centrally positioned thermowell was equipped with thermocouples to measure temperatures<br><br>
throughout a catalyst bed. The catalyst bed was formed by filling the space between the thermowell and an inner wall of the reactor with catalysts and silicon carbide (20-grid, Stanford Materials; Aliso Viejo, CA). Such silicon carbide is believed to have low, if any, catalytic properties under the process conditions described herein. All catalysts were mixed with silicon carbide in a volume ratio of 2 parts silicon carbide to 1 part catalyst before placing the mixture into the contacting zone portions of the reactor.<br>
The crude feed flow to the reactor was from the top of the reactor to the bottom of the reactor. Silicon carbide was positioned at the bottom of the reactor to serve as a bottom support. A bottom catalyst/silicon carbide mixture (81 cm ) was positioned on top of the silicon carbide to form a bottom contacting zone. The bottom catalyst was prepared as described in Example 2.<br>
A top catalyst/silicon carbide mixture (9 cm) was positioned on top of the bottom contacting zone to form a top contacting zone. The top catalyst was a supported molybdenum/vanadium catalyst prepared by combining a support containing theta alumina with molybdenum and vanadium. The support was prepared by mulling 576 grams of alumina (Criterion Catalysts and Technologies LP, Michigan City, Michigan, U.S.A.) with 585 grams of water and 8 grams of glacial nitric acid for 35 minutes. The resulting mulled mixture was extruded through a 1.3 mm die plate, heat-treated between 90 °C and about 125 °C, and further heat-treated at 918 °C. The heat-treated support was placed in a Lindberg furnace. The furnace temperature was raised to about 1000 ° C to about 1100 °C over 1.5 hours, and then held in this range for 2 hours to produce the support. The support included, per gram of support, 0.0003 grams of gamma alumina, 0.0008 grams of alpha alumina, 0.0208 grams of delta alumina, and 0.9781 grams of theta alumina, as determined by x-ray diffraction. The support was impregnated with a molybdenum/vanadium impregnation solution prepared as follows. A first solution was made by combining 2.14 grams of (NH4)Mo2O7, 3.21 grams of M0O3,0.56 grams of 30% H2O2 0.14 grams of MEA, and 3.28 grams of deionized water to form a slurry. The slurry was heated to 65 °C until solids dissolved, and then cooled to room temperature. A second solution was made by combining 3.57 grams of VOSO4xH2O (x - 3 to 5) with 40 grams of deionized water. The first solution and second solution were combined and sufficient deionized water was added to bring the combined solution volume up to 82 mL to yield the molybdenum/vanadium impregnation solution. The alumina was impregnated with the molybdenum/vanadium impregnation solution, and aged for 2 hours with occasional<br><br>
agitation. The resulting support/metal mixture was heat-treated at 125 °C for several hours, and then heat-treated at 480 °C for 2 hours. The resulting catalyst contained, per gram of catalyst, 0.02 grains of vanadium and 0.02 grams of molybdenum, with the balance being support The molybdenum/vanadium catalyst had a pore size distribution with a median pore diameter of 300 A.<br>
Silicon carbide was positioned on top of the top contacting zone to fill dead space and to serve as a preheat zone. The catalyst bed was loaded into a Lindberg furnace that included four heating zones corresponding to the preheat zone, the top and bottom contacting zones, and the bottom support<br>
The catalysts were sulfided by introducing a gaseous mixture of 5 vol% hydrogen sulfide and 95 vol% hydrogen gas into the contacting zones at a rate of about 1.5 liter of gaseous mixture per volume (mL) of total catalyst (silicon carbide was not counted as part of the volume of catalyst) for the time periods set forth below. The reactor pressure was about 1.9 MPa (279.7 psi). Temperatures of the contacting zones were increased from ambient to 204 °C (400 °F) over 1 hour, and then held at 204 °C for 2 hours. After holding at 204 °C, the contacting zones were increased incrementally to 316 °C (600 °F) at a rate of about 10 °C (about 50 °F) per hour. The contacting zones were maintained at 316 °C for an hour, incrementally raised to 370 °C (700 °F) over 1 hour, and then held at 370 °C for two hours. The contacting zones were then allowed to cool to ambient temperature.<br>
After sulfiding, the contacting zones were then heated to 204 °C over 2 hours and the crude feed (BC-10, Brazil) having the properties summarized in Table 2 was fed to the top of the reactor. The crude feed flowed through the preheat zone, top contacting zone, bottom contacting zone, and bottom support of the reactor. The crude feed was contacted with each of the catalysts in the presence of hydrogen gas. Contacting conditions were as follows: ratio of hydrogen gas to the crude feed provided to the reactor was 656 Nm3/m3 (4000 SCFB), LHSV was 0.5 h4, and pressure was 13.8 MPa (2014.7 psi). The two contacting zones were incrementally heated from 204 °C to 390 ° C at a rate in a range from 0.1 CC per hour to 10 °C per hour, and then maintained at 390 °C for 311 hours. Temperatures of the catalyst bed was incrementally raised to 400 °C, and maintained at 400 °C for 352 hours.<br>
The total product (that is, the crude product and gas) exited the catalyst bed. The total product was introduced into a gas-liquid phase separator. In the gas-liquid separator, the total product was separated into the crude product and gas. Gas input to the system was<br><br>
measured by a mass flow controller. Gas exiting the system was cooled to a temperature sufficient to remove any liquid components having a carbon number of at least 5 from the gas. The separated gas was measured using a wet test meter. The crude product was periodically analyzed to determine a weight percentage of components of the crude product Crude product properties are summarized in Table 2.<br><br>
As shown in Table 2, the crude product had, per gram of crude product, a nitrogen content of 0.0024 grams, a MCR content of 0.046 grams, and a C5 asphaltenes content of 0.043 grams. The crude product also had a calcium content of 0.6 wtppm, a potassium content of 1.3 wtppm, and a sodium content of 0.6 wtppm.<br>
Example 3 demonstrates that contacting the crude feed with one or more catalysts at controlled contacting conditions produced a total product that included the crude product. At least one of the catalysts was a Column 6 metal catalyst that: (a) included<br><br>
Column 6 metal(s); (b) had a pore size distribution with a median pore diameter of greater than 110 A; and (c) had a pore volume in which pores having a pore diameter of at least 350 A provided at most 10% of the pore volume. As measured by P-value, crude feed/total product mixture stability was maintained. The crude product had reduced MCR, a reduced alkali metal and alkaline-earth metal salts in organic acids, reduced NI/V/Fe content, reduced sulfur content, reduced nitrogen content, reduced C5 asphaltenes, and reduced oxygen content relative to the crude feed.<br>
Example 4. Preparation of a Catalyst Support An alumina support was prepared by mulling 550 grams of alumina powder (Criterion Catalysts and Technologies LP), 26 grams of calcined alumina fines, 585 grams of water, and 8 grams of 16M nitric acid for 35 minutes. The mulled mixture was extruded through 1.94 mm and 3.28 mm diameter die plates, heat-treated at 93 °C (200 °F), 107 °C (225 °F), and then heat-treated at 121 °C (250 °F) until a loss on ignition in a range of 27 wt% to 30 wt%, based on initial extrudate weight, was obtained. Loss on ignition was performed as described in Example 1. The extrudates were further heat-treated at 918 °C (1685 °F) for 1 hour. The support had an average pore diameter of 186.4 A, a pore volume of 0.868 cm3/mL, and pores with a diameter of at least 350 A, which provided 13.3% of the total pore volume of the support. Example 4 demonstrates preparation of a support that has an average pore diameter of at least 90 A and a pore volume in which pores having a pore diameter of at least 350 A provide at most 15% of the pore volume of the support.<br>
Example 5. Preparation of a Catalyst having a Median Pore Diameter of 250 A and a Selected Pore Volume Distribution. The alumina support prepared as described in Example 4 was impregnated with a molybdenum/cobalt/phosphorus impregnation solution prepared as follows. M0O3 (22.95 grams) was combined with 85 wt% H3PO4 (12.67 grams), and heated to 82 °C (180 °F) to form amolybdmum/phosphorous solution. Co(OH)2 (29.83 grams) was added to the molybdenum/phosphorus solution and the resulting molybdenum/cobalt/phosphorus solution was heated to 100 °C. Citric acid monohydrate (21.5 grams) was added to the molybdenum/cobalt/phosphorus solution, heated to 100 °C, and maintained at 100 °C for 1 hour. The resulting solution was reduced in volume to 252 mL to produce the molybdenum/cobalt/phosphorus impregnation solution. The impregnation solution had a pH of 3.22.<br>
The alumina support (300.0 grams) was combined with the impregnation solution, aged for several hours with occasional agitation. The resulting support/metal mixture was<br><br>
heat-treated at 120 °C for several hours, and then heat-treated at 426 °C (800 °F) for 2 hours. The resulting catalyst was further heat-treated at 593 °C (1100 °F) for 2 hours. The catalyst contained, per gram of catalyst, 0.153 grams of molybdenum, 0.043 grams of cobalt, and 0.008 grams of phosphorus, with the balance being support The catalyst had a pore size distribution with a median pore diameter of 250 A, with 67% of the total number of pores having a pore diameter within 58 A of the median pore diameter. The surface area of the catalyst was 98 m2/g. The pore volume distribution is summarized in Table 3.<br><br>
As shown in Table 3, pores having a pore diameter of at least 350 A provided 2.8% of the total pore volume of the catalyst.<br>
Example 5 demonstrates the preparation of the Column 6 metal catalyst having a pore size distribution with a median pore diameter of greater than 110 A, and a pore volume in which pores of at least 350 A provide at most 10% of the total pore volume. This example also demonstrates the preparation of the Column 6 metal catalyst from a<br><br>
support having an average pore diameter of at least 90 A, and a pore volume in which<br>
pores having a pore diameter of at least 350 A provide at least 15% of the total pore<br>
volume.<br>
Example 6. Contact of a Grade feed with Two Catalysts, The reactor apparatus (except<br>
for content of contacting zones), the crude feed, catalyst sulfiding method, total product<br>
separation method, contacting conditions, contacting time, and crude product analysis were<br>
the same as described in Example 3.<br>
The crude feed flowed from the top of the reactor to the bottom of the reactor. A molybdenum/cobalt/phosphorus catalyst/silicon carbide mixture (81 cm) was positioned as a bottom catalyst in the bottom contacting zone. The bottom catalyst was prepared as described in Example 5*<br>
A supported molybdenum/vanadium catalyst, prepared as described in Example 3, was mixed with silicon carbide. The supported molybdenum/vanadium catalyst/silicon carbide mixture (9 cm3) was positioned in the top contacting zone.<br>
Crude product properties are summarized in Table 4.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 4, the crude product had a nitrogen content of 0.0047 grams, a MCR content of 0.072 grams and a C5 asphaltenes content of 0.05 grams, per gram of crude product. The crude product also had 0.5 wtppm of calcium, 1.5 wtppm of potassium, and 0.6 wtppm of sodium.<br>
Example 6 demonstrates that contacting the crude feed with one or more catalysts with controlled contacting conditions, produced a total product that included the crude product. At least one of the catalysts was a Columns 6 metal catalyst that: (a) included Column 6 metal(s); (b) had a pore size distribution with a median pore diameter of greater than 110 A; and (c) had a pore volume in which pores having a pore diameter of at least 350 A provided at most 10% of the pore volume. The crude product had reduced MCR, reduced alkali metal and alkaline-earth metal salts of organic acids, reduced Ni/V/Fe content, reduced sulfur content, reduced nitrogen content, reduced C5 asphaltenes, and reduced oxygen content relative to the crude feed.<br>
