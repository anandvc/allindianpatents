				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This relates to a method of producing silt erosion and corrosion resistant<br>
coatings.<br>
This invention further relates to a method of producing silt erosion and corrosion<br>
resistant coatings using liquid fuel based high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF) spraying<br>
system. The silt and corrosion resistant coating has been obtained by controlling<br>
the spraying parameters and automatic manipulation of the components as well<br>
as HVOF gun.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Silt erosion in hydroelectric power stations and machinery is a serious problem.<br>
This is more aggressive in India, especially in the Himalayan region. This is<br>
mainly due to excessive silt content having particle size in excess of 90um<br>
(ASTM 170 mesh). During monsoon it becomes impossible to control the silt<br>
content passing through the turbine. It increases from 2500 to 10,000 ppm and<br>
size exceeds 1000um. The concentration of quartz in Indian silt is also very high<br>
(-90%). This is responsible for very quick erosion. The components, which are<br>
exposed to erosion in existing power stations are guide vanes, labyrinth seals,<br>
runner blades, lower rings and top covers and guide vane bushings. These are<br>
made of corrosion-resistant martensitic (13Cr-4Ni &amp; 12Cr steels), austenitic<br>
(18Cri-8Ni steel) and manganese steels (1.5 Mn steel). All these steels are<br>
considerably less resistant to silt erosion, and require suitable protective<br>
coatings. If unattended, the erosion of critical components such as guide vanes,<br>
labyrinth seals, runner blades, guide rings etc. can lead to loss of turbine<br>
efficiency as high as 5-10%. This causes a heavy revenue loss for all the silt<br>
affected hydro power stations. The coatings are generally applied by plasma,<br>
flame, wire and twin wire arc spraying techniques.<br>
To overcome the silt erosion of hydro turbine power station, a number of<br>
techniques such as weld deposit of hard materials, plasma spraying of hard<br>
ceramic coating, metallic coating by flame spray and plasma nitriding are used<br>
very commonly. However, these cannot solve the problem of silt damage<br>
occurring on the hydro machinery. In some cases the worn out hydro machinery<br>
is replaced with new machinery. The main disadvantages of the present<br>
thermally sprayed coatings applied by plasma, flame, twin wire arc spraying<br>
techniques and HVOF coatings are the lack of controlled movement of spraying<br>
guns as well as movement of symmetrical and unsymmetrical hydro turbine<br>
components. The components such as guide vanes, runner blades, labyrinth<br>
seal, top cover and lower ring require precise movement to control the uniformity<br>
of the HVOF coating thickness, porosity, hardness etc, which otherwise<br>
uncontrolled generally leads to excessive erosion. At present, these coatings are<br>
either applied manually or with partially controlled movement either of the job or<br>
of the HVOF gun. The coating powder generally used in the HVOF system for<br>
this application are tungsten carbide in combination with Ni, Co, Cr as a binder in<br>
combination or alone.<br>
The other disadvantage of conventional techniques is that these do not<br>
adequately solve silt erosion problem. Ceramic coatings applied by plasma<br>
spraying are brittle in nature and debond while operating hydro machinery under<br>
high stress abrasive conditions. Disadvantages of plasma nitriding and hard<br>
weld deposits are that these lead to excessive distortion and warpages of' the<br>
hydro components.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a method of producing silt<br>
erosion and corrosion resistant coatings, which is generally applicable to<br>
hydroturbines and pumps.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a method of producing silt<br>
erosion and corrosion resistant coatings, which is dense, oxide free and has<br>
limited voids.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a method of producing silt erosion<br>
and corrosion resistant coatings, which used improved HVOF spraying<br>
parameters.<br>
Yet another object of this invention to propose a method of producing silt erosion<br>
and corrosion resistant coatings, which has improved surface roughness.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a method of producing silt erosion and corrosion<br>
resistant coatings, comprising the steps of supplying compressed oxygen to high<br>
velocity spraying chamber to produce a high spraying velocity, feeding a<br>
predetermined quantity of a carbide/metallic powder into the high temperature<br>
flame and deposition on the component to be coated.<br>
In accordance with this invention is provided a method for providing silt erosion<br>
and corrosion resistant cdatings, HVOF spraying is used especially for materials<br>
with melting point below 3000K. It shows advantages in density and bond<br>
strength making it attractive for many silt erosion and corrosion resistance<br>
applications. Its high coating quality results from the use of a hot combination-<br>
driven high-speed gas jet for thermal spraying. These coatings have<br>
environmental advantages compares to chemically electrochemically formed<br>
coatings.<br>
Tungsten and chromium carbide powders are used in the HVOF spraying<br>
system. These are used to produce dense, high hardness and excellent silt<br>
erosion resistance coatings generally to combat the erosion and corrosion at high<br>
as well as room temperature. In applications where abrasive or erosive silt<br>
erosion resistance is of primary importance, Tungsten carbide-cobalt-chromium.<br>
(WC-Co) with and without nickel or chrome is used. Tungsten carbide-cobalt<br>
(WC-Co-Cr) powders are preferred when high corrosion resistance at room<br>
temperature is needed. The abrasive and erosive silt erosion resistance depends<br>
upon oxides, pores and the phase transformation occurring during spraying. The<br>
coating powders generally used in HVOF spraying are WC+Co, Cr3C2+NiCr,<br>
WC+Cr3C2+NiCr, WC+Co+Cr. High velocity oxy fuel sprayed coatings are<br>
commonly applied by HP/HVOF JP-5000, DS-100, Met jet ll/lll, OSU, Metco<br>
Diamond jet and unique coat AC HVAF systems. These systems are based on<br>
liquid as well as gaseous fuel and oxygen/air. The liquid fuel injection systems<br>
are preferred due to their advantages of producing dense and high hardness<br>
coatings. The HVOF coatings are generally based on the combustion of liquid<br>
fuel such as kerosene and gaseous fuel such as hydrogen, propane or natural<br>
gas and oxygen. The HVOF spraying system is improved by controlling Indian<br>
aviation fuel/oxygen flow rates and thereby producing a controlled thermal<br>
energy which is converted into kinetic energy resulting in proper melting and<br>
accelerating the powders to produce a silt erosion and corrosion resistant<br>
coating. As Indian aviation fuel has more aromatics, the parameters have been<br>
modified suitably. The oxygen flow rate employed is upto 1000 Lpm, the fuel flow<br>
rate is upto 25 Lph and the carrier gas flow rate is upto 50Lpm. The melted<br>
powder is accelerated to a velocity of 700 to 800 m/sec for deposition on the<br>
surface of the component to be coated.<br><br>
The flame temperature is increased through Indian aviation fuel injection and<br>
combusting with commercial oxygen to get medium temperature of carbide<br>
particles upto 1800°C. The spraying gas velocity generated through combustion<br>
of compressed oxygen and fuel is above 2500m/sec.<br>
The combustion pressure is employed upto 0.95 MPa, the spray distance is<br>
maintained upto 450mm and the spray angle is upto 90°C.<br>
The length of the barrel of the plasma gun is upto 200 mm.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of this invention tungsten carbide-cobalt-<br>
chromium powder is used where cobalt is upto 12%, chromium upto 6%, the<br>
balance being made up of tungsten carbide.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment of this invention, the roughness of the<br>
surface to be coated is increased, before applying the coating. As the adhesion<br>
of coatings is directly related to the roughness of the surface and it is controlled<br>
by the type of grit blasting machine, blasting pressure, angle, distance, time and<br>
grit blasting nozzle. The grit blasting is carried out with a pressure blaster having<br>
nozzle upto 8 mm dia using blasting pressure upto 0.6 MPa and alumina grit of<br>
size 12-16 mesh. The grit-blasting stand off distance is upto 500 mm so that<br>
optimum surfaces finish is obtained. The surface finish achieved on the<br>
components is upto 15 micron Ra.<br>
The HVOF coatings obtained according to the process of the invention was<br>
evaluated for its silt erosion resistance behavior. This was tested by using a<br>
facility which was designed in house and fabricated by considering the high-<br>
stress abrasive wear of hydro turbines components. Water mixed with sand was<br>
pumped through a known gap between a rotating disc and the housing where<br>
hydrofoils of required shape and sizes were fixed. The coated samples were<br>
mounted at required radial locations. The sand slurry was accelerated and<br><br>
impinged on these hydrofoils, causing hydro-abrasion. By choosing different<br>
radii, the linear velocity and the centrifugal force, and hence the intensity of<br>
abrasion, can be varied. By regulating the sand and water flow rates the silt<br>
concentration was kept constant. The sand was continuously fed at the rate of<br>
37g/min, which ensures continuous replacement of worn-out sand particles.<br>
Velocity of the sand-laden water was of the order of 66.3 m/s, corresponding to a<br>
maximum acceleration up to 18000 g. In principle, such high accelerations are<br>
reached only in extremely high-head and high-speed turbines. This test facility<br>
was designed in such a way that silt concentration can be varied from 1.5 kg/m3<br>
to 10 kg/m3. In actual hydro power stations, such values of silt concentration may<br>
occur only during a few days in a year. Thus the abrasive wear results from this<br>
test facility, for a test duration of just a few hours, can be considered to simulate<br>
the abrasive wear of the turbine components of the actual power stations during<br>
the whole year.<br>
Test Conditions:<br>
Erodent type Mineral sand of hardness 1100 HV<br>
Silt Concentration upto 2350 ppm<br>
Water velocity upto 66.3 m/s<br>
Chamber pressure upto 330 mm of water column<br>
Specimen type and size Hydrofoils scaled down to 1/10 of actual] hydro<br>
turbine blade and also round samples.<br>
Additionally the coatings have been tested for high stress abrasive wear by<br>
applying a load of 50 N and using rubber wheel (as per ASTM G-65). Different<br>
quantities of erodent were used to get 100 to 1000 revolutions of rubber wheel.<br>
The test parameters adopted are given below:<br>
Erodent type Mineral sand of hardness of 1100 HV<br>
Size of erodent 180-250 microns<br>
Erodent flow rate upto 5.5 g/s<br>
Load applied 50 N<br>
Sample size 75 x 25 x 6<br>
Test duration 600 revolutions<br>
Hardness of rubber wheel Shore 70<br>
The test results are given in the Figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings<br>
and also in Table 1. The HVOF spraying parameters take into accounts the<br>
distance variation, which generally occurs in case of runner blades and guide<br>
vanes. Fig 1 shows the simulated silt erosion test results of HVOF coating and<br>
Fig 2 shows the effect of particle impact energy on erosion rate.<br>
HVOF coatings applied by controlled parameters have been proven on the<br>
symmetrical top cover and lower ring weighting 16 ton &amp; 12 ton respectively and<br>
on the unsymmetrical guidevanes. These coatings do not debond while erosion<br>
testing under high stress abrasive conditions. The coatings were done by<br>
automatic movement of the component and HVOF gun. The components were<br>
mounted on a job rotator and the HVOF gun on the boom. The components,<br>
which were rotated at controlled speed to get a uniform coating thickness of 250<br>
micron. Other components such as guide vanes and runner blades were also<br>
coated in similar way.<br>
