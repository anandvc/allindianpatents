The present invention relates to a constant velocity universal Joint which is used, for example, to couple a first transmission shaft and a second transmission shaft at a driving force-transmitting section of an automobile.  The present invention also relates to a method for assembling such a constant velocity universal joint. Description of the Related Art:<br>
A constant velocity universal joint has been hitherto used for a driving force-transmitting section of an, automobile, for coupling a first transmission shaft and a second transmission shaft so that the rotary force is transmitted to each axle.<br>
Such a constant velocity universal joint concerning the conventional technique is shown in FIGS. 67 and 68 (see Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 7-103251).<br>
The constant velocity universal Joint 1 comprises mutually opposing guide tracks 2a, 2b which are formed on an inner wall surface of an outer joint 3. A spherical tripod journal 4 is arranged between the guide tracks 2a, 2b. An inner roller 5 is externally fitted to the tripod journal 4. An outer roller 7 is supported via a plurality of needle bearings 6 on an outer circumferential surface of the inner<br><br>
roller 5.<br>
In this arrangement, surfaces 8a, 8b, 9a, 9b, which extend substantially in parallel to the axis of the tripod journal 4, are formed on the circumferential surfaces of the tripod Journal 4 and the outer roller 7 on the both opposing sides in the rotational direction of the joint.  The surfaces 8a, 8b, 9a, 9b function such that the force, which is applied to the tripod journal 4 and which is effective in the circumferential direction, is divided into two components of force. Owing to such an arrangement, the improvement in distribution of the contact surface pressure is achieved under the load of torque.<br>
However, in the case of the constant velocity universal joint 1 concerning the conventional technique described above, for example, each of the components of force F2, F2, which is applied to the inner roller 5 by the surface 8b formed on the circumferential surface of the tripod Journal 4, is composed of a relatively high load.  Therefore, an inconvenience arises in that the contact surface pressure (force to press the contact surface), which is exerted in the direction of the arrow between the tripod journal 4 and the inner roller 5, is increased as compared with the contact surface pressure on other circumferential surfaces. This results in a problem that the durability is deteriorated.<br>
Further, the constant velocity universal Joint 1 concerning the conventional technique comprises the inner<br><br>
roller 5 and the outer roller 7 held by the guide track- 	,<br>
2b via the needle bearings 6.  The tripod journal 4 is provided such that it makes displacement in the vertical direction along the inner wall surface of the inner roller 5 held by the guide tracks 2a, 2b.  Therefore, the constant velocity universal Joint 1 concerning the conventional technique is inconvenient in that it is impossible to reduce the slide resistance on the sliding surface between the tripod Journal 4 and the inner roller 5.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A general object of the present invention is to provide a constant velocity universal Joint which makes it possible to improve the durability by decreasing the contact surface pressure on the contact surface between a trunnion and an annular member externally fitted to the trunnion.<br>
A principal object of the present Invention is to provide a constant velocity universal Joint which makes it possible to further Improve the induced thrust performance by reducing the slide resistance generated when a first transmission shaft is inclined and a trunnion is displace along a guide groove.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a constant velocity universal Joint which makes it possible to further improve the strength of a trunnion without inhibiting the assembling performance when an annular member is externally fitted to the trunnion.<br><br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method for assembling a constant velocity universal joint, which makes it possible to conveniently assemble a trunnuion provided with a spherical surface and an annular member formed with a recess corresponding to the spherical surface of the trunnion.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a constant velocity universal joint having a cylindrical outer member which is connected to a first transmission shaft and which is provided, on its inner wall surface, with a plurality of guide grooves separated from each other by predetermined spacing distances and extending along an axial direction, and an inner member which is connected to a second transmission shaft and which is inserted into an open inner space of said outer member, said constant velocity universal joint comprising; trunnions each of which expands towards said guide groove and each of which is provided with a spherical surface along a circumferential direction; first annular members each of which is externally fitted to said trunnion and each of which has a recess having a spherical surface formed on an inner circumferential surface to make-to-surface contact corresponding to said spherical surface and second annular members each of which is externally fitted to said first annular member via a bearing member and each of which is provided relatively displaceably with respect to said first annular member along an axial direction of said trunnion.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS With reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, reference numeral 10 Indicates a constant velocity universal Joint according to the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The constant velocity universal joint 10 basically comprises a cylindrical outer cup (outer member) 12 which has an opening and which is integrally connected to one end of an unillustrated first shaft, and an inner member 16 which is secured to one end of a second shaft 13 and which is accommodated in a hole 14 of the outer cup 12.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, three guide grooves 18, which extend in the axial direction and which are spaced apart from each other by about 120 degrees about the central axis, are formed on the inner wall surface of the outer cup 12. As shown in FIG. 2, the guide groove 18 includes a ceiling section 20 which is formed to have a planar configuration, and side surface sections 22a, 22b which are formed substantially perpendicularly on both sides of the ceiling section 20 and which are opposed to one another.  Each of the side surface sections 22a, 22b is formed to have a planar configuration extending along the axial direction of<br><br>
the outer cup 12.<br>
A pair of step sections 24a, 24b, which continue to lower ends of the side surface sections 22a, 22b and which are opposed to one another, are formed on the inner wall surface of the outer cup 12.<br>
A ring-shaped spider boss 26 Is externally fitted to the second shaft 13.  Three trunnions 28a to 28c, which expand toward the guide grooves 18 respectively and which are spaced apart from each other by about 120 degrees about the central axis, are integrally formed on the outer circumferential surface of the spider boss 26.  As shown in FIG. 3, each of the trunnions 28a (28b, 28c) integrally comprises a neck section 30 which expands radially outwardly from the ring-shaped spider boss 26, and a flat disk section 34 which has a flat upper surface 32.  An outer circumferential surface of the trunnion 2Ba (28b, 28c), which is substantially perpendicular to the upper surface 32, is formed to be a spherical surface 36.  A filleting section 38 having a curved cross section is provided at a boundary between the upper surface 32 and the spherical surface 36 and at a boundary between the lower surface and the spherical surface 36 of each of the trunnions 28a, (28b, 28c).<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, those disposed between the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) and the side surface sections are an inner roller (first annular member) 42 which is composed of a ring member and which is formed with a recess 40 having a<br><br>
spherical surface over the entire inner circumferential surface corresponding to the spherical surface 36 of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c), and an outer roller (second annular member) 46 which is externally fitted to the inner roller 42 via a plurality of needle bearings (bearing members) 44. The plurality of needle bearings 44 are reliably installed in annuleir recesses 48 which are formed on the inner circumferential surface of the outer roller 46, and they are incorporated so that they are not disengaged from the recesses 48 owing to the keystone effect.<br>
Cutouts 52 are formed on the inner roller 42 in order to easily assemble the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) into a hole 50 of the inner roller 42.  As shown in FIG. 4, the cutouts 52 are formed to have a pair of mutually opposing circular arc-shaped configurations disposed at boundary portions between an upper surface 54 and an inner wall surface of the circular hole 50. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 8, in place of the inner roller 42, it is also preferable to use an inner roller 42a which includes substantially elliptic cutouts 52a formed at boundary portions between the upper surface 54 and the inner wall surface.<br>
The spherical surface 36 of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) and the recess 40 of the inner roller 42 are provided to make surface-to-surface contact with each other.  Therefore, the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) is provided rotatably in the direction of the arrow A about a center of a point O (see<br>
FIG.    2)    with   resperit^   t""   t"h*&gt;    1nn*iT   T-nl 1 A-r   i?      anrl    H t-    i c<br><br>
provided rotatably in the circumferential direction (direction of the arrow B) along the spherical surface 36 about a center of rotation of the axis of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c).  Further, the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) and the inner roller 42 are provided displaceably in the vertical direction (direction of the arrow C) in an integrated manner with respect to the needle bearings 44 held by the outer roller 46.<br>
The constant velocity universal joint 10 according to the first embodiment of the present invention is basically constructed as described above.  Next, its operation, function, and effect will be explained.<br>
When the unillustrated first shaft is rotated, its rotary force is transmitted via the outer cup 12 to the inner member 16.  Accordingly, the second shaft 13 is rotated in the predetermined direction by the aid of the trunnions 28a (28b, 28c).<br>
That is, the rotary force of the outer cup 12 is transmitted to the inner roller 42 via the needle bearings 44 and the outer roller 46 contacting with the guide grooves 18. The rotary force is further transmitted to the trunnions 28a {28b, 28c) via the spherical surfaces 36 which make surface-to-surface contact with the recesses 40 of the inner rollers 42.  Thus, the second shaft 13, which is engaged with the trunnions 28a (28b, 28c}, is rotated.<br>
In this arrangement, when the second shaft 13 is inclined by a predetermined angle with respect to the outer<br><br>
cup 12 provided with the first shaft, then the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) makes sliding movement in the direction of the arrow A about the center of rotation of the point O, or the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) makes sliding movement in the circumferential direction (direction of the arrow B) along the recess 40 having the spherical surface about the center of rotation of the axis of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c), while maintaining the state in which the spherical surface of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) makes surface-to-surface contact with the recess 40 having the spherical surface formed on the inner roller 42.<br>
The trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) is also displaced along the axial direction (direction of the arrow C) of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) integrally with the inner roller 42 which makes sliding movement with respect to the needle bearings 44 held by the outer roller 46.<br>
Further, the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) is displaced in the direction substantially perpendicular to the axis of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c), i.e., in the longitudinal direction of the guide groove 18, by the aid of the outer roller 46 which makes sliding movement along the guide groove 18.<br>
Thus, the rotary motion of the first shaft is smoothly transmitted to the second shaft 13 without being affected by the angle of inclination of the second shaft 13 with respect to the outer cup 12.<br>
In the first embodiment, the spherical surface 36 is provided on the side surface of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c)<br><br>
to make sliding movement with respect to the inner roller 42 formed with the recess 40 corresponding to the spherical surface 36.  Further, the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) and the inner roller 42 are provided displaceably along the axial direction of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c).  Thus, it is possible to decrease the slide resistance and reduce the induced thrust force.  Furthermore, the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) and the recess 40 of the inner roller 42 make surface-to-surface contact with each other to reduce the contact surface pressure.  Thus, it is possible to improve the durability of the constant velocity universal Joint 10.<br>
In other words, in the case of the conventional technique, as shown in FIG. 67, the displacement of the tripod journal 4 in the axial direction is effected on the basis of the sliding movement between the inner roller 5 and the tripod journal 4.  On the contrary, in the case of the embodiment of the present invention, the displacement is effected on the basis of the sliding movement between the needle bearings 44 and the inner roller 42 to be displaced integrally with the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c).  As a result, in the embodiment of the present invention, the friction during the displacement can be decreased, and the slide resistance can be decreased, as compared with the conventional technique.<br>
The "induced thrust force" described above refers to the load resulting from the frictlonal resistance generated by the displacement of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) along the<br><br>
guide groove 18.<br>
Next, a method for assembling the constant velocity universal joint according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be explained below, as exemplified by cases in which the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) is installed into the hole 50 of the inner roller 42 or the inner roller 42a respectively.<br>
The inner roller 42 (see FIG. 4), which is provided with the pair of mutually opposing cutouts 52, is used as follows.  That is, the spherical surface 36 of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) is inserted into the recess 40 of the inner roller 42 along the pair of cutouts 52 in a state in which the upper surface 54 of the inner roller 42 is allowed to be substantially perpendicular to the flat upper surface 32 of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c).  The trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) is inclined so that the axis of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) is substantially perpendicular to the upper surface 32 of the inner roller 42.

constant velocity universal Joint.<br>
Next, constant velocity universal Joints according to other embodiments are shown in FIGS. 21 to 24.  The same constitutive components as those of the constant velocity universal Joint 70 shown in FIG. 19 are designated by the same reference numerals, detailed explanation of which will be omitted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 21, a constant velocity universal Joint 70a according to the sixth embodiment is constructed as follows.  That is, a ring member 58, which has a spherical surface 36 formed on its outer circumferential surface, is forcibly inserted into a columnar trunnion 56a (56b, 56c).

Guide tracks 82a, 82b, each of which has a semielllptic configuration corresponding to the cross-sectional configuration of the outer roller 80, are formed on side surface sections 22a, 22b of the guide groove 18.  In this arrangement, the outer roller 80 is restricted by the guide tracks 82a, 82b for the displacement in the axial direction (direction of the arrow C) of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c). Thus, the displacement can be easily effected in the axial direction of the trunnion 28a (28b, 28c) by using the sliding surface of the inner circumferential surface of the outer roller 80 and the needle bearings 44.<br>
The first to ninth embodiments of the present invention have been explained by using the tripod type constant velocity universal joints 10, 10a to 10c, 70, 70a to 70d each of which is provided with the three trunnions 28a to 28c, 56a to 56c.  However, there is no limitation thereto. It is a matter of course that the present invention is also applicable to unlllustrated bipod type constant velocity universal joints.<br>
Next, a constant velocity universal joint according to the tenth embodiment of the present invention is shown in<br><br>
FIGS. 25 and 26.<br>
The constant velocity universal joint 110 basically comprises a cylindrical outer cup (outer member) 112 which has an opening and which is integrally connected to one end of an unillustrated first shaft, and an inner member 116 which is secured to one end of a second shaft 113 and which is accommodated in a hole 114 of the outer cup 112.  The outer cup 112 is formed in an integrated manner.<br>
As shown in FIG. 25, three guide tracks 118, which extend in the axial direction and which are spaced apart from each other by about 120 degrees about the central axis, are formed on the inner wall surface of the outer cup 112.<br>
As shown in FIG. 26, the guide track 118 includes a ceiling section 120 which is formed to have a circular arc-shaped cross section about the center of the axis of the outer cup 112, side surface sections 122a, 122b each of which is formed to have a planar configuration extending along the axial direction of the outer cup 112 and which are opposed to one another on both sides of the ceiling section 120, and grooves 124a, 124b which are formed mutually opposingly at both ends of the ceiling section 120 and which extend along the axial direction.  Each of the grooves 124a, 124b is formed with a planar shoulder 125 which is substantially perpendicular to the side surface section 122a, 122b.<br>
A ring-shaped spider boss 126 is externally fitted to the second shaft 113.  Three trunnions 128a to 128c, which<br>
J.<br><br>
expand toward the guide tracks 118 respectively and which are spaced apart from each other by about 120 degrees about the central axis, are integrally formed on the outer circumferential surface of the spider boss 126. As shown in FIG. 28, each of the trunnions 128a (128b, 128c) has a neck section 130 which expands radially outwardly from the ring-shaped spider boss 126, and a head section 132 which is constructed integrally with the neck section 130 and which is formed to have a thin-walled flat configuration. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 29, each of the sections may be formed by forcibly Inserting a ring member 135 onto the outer circumferential surface of a columnar trunnion 133a (133b, 133c).<br>
A first curved surface 134a, which is formed to have a circular arc-shaped configuration having a predetermined curvature as viewed in the axial direction of the outer cup 112 (see FIG. 26) and which is formed to have a linear configuration as  viewed in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the outer cup 112, is provided on the upper surface of the head section 132 (see FIG. 27).  In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 27, the shape of the first curved surface 134a is not limited to the linear configuration as viewed in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the outer cup 112.  Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 30, the shape of the first curved surface 134a may be formed to have a circular arc-shaped configuration having a predetermined curvature.<br>
A second curved surface 134b, which is similar to the<br><br>
first curved surface 134a, is formed to continue to the neck section 130 on the lower surface of the head section 132. The head section 132 further comprises a spherical surface 136 which is formed on the outer circumferential surface between the first curved surface 134a and the second curved surface 134b.  An unillustrated filleting section having a curved cross section may be provided at a boundary between the first curved surface 134a and the spherical surface 136 and at a boundary between the second curved surface 134b and the spherical surface 136 of each of the trunnions 128a, (128b, 128c).<br>
As shown in FIG. 28, those disposed between the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) and the side surface sections 122a, 122b are an inner roller (first annular member) 142 which is composed of a ring member and which is formed with a recess 140 having a spherical surface corresponding to the spherical surface 136 of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c), and an outer roller (second annular member) 146 which is composed of a ring member having a diameter larger than that of the inner roller 142 and which is externally fitted to the inner roller 142 via a plurality of needle bearings (bearing members) 144.<br>
The plurality of needle bearings 144 are reliably installed in annular recesses 148 which are formed on the inner circumferential surface of the outer roller 146, and they are incorporated so that they are not disengaged from the recesses 148 owing to the keystone effect.  For example.<br><br>
an unillustrated holding fixture may be provided and used so that the plurality of needle bearings 144 are installed along the outer circumferential surface of the inner roller 142.<br>
As shovm in FIG. 31, a substantially elliptic cutout 152 is formed at a boundary between the upper surface 154 and the inner wall surface of the inner roller 142 in order to easily assemble the trunnion 128a (l28b, 128c) into a hole 150 of the inner roller 142.<br>
When the ring member 135 is forcibly inserted onto the outer circumferential surface of the columnar trunnion 133a (133b, 133c), as shown in FIG. 37, in place of the inner roller 142, it Is preferable to use an inner roller 142a which includes a pair of mutually opposing circular arc-shaped cutouts 152a, 152b formed at boundary portions between the upper surface 154 and the inner wall surface of the circular hole 150.<br>
An annular projection 156, which has a cross-sectional configuration corresponding to the groove 124a, 124b and which protrudes radially outwardly, is formed at an upper portion of the outer circumferential surface of the outer roller 146.  The annular projection 156 has a first engaging surface 158 having a circular arc-shaped cross section to make contact with the ceiling section 120, and a second engaging section 160 formed to have a planar configuration to make contact with the shoulder 125.  An outer circumferential surface 162 for making surface-to-surface<br><br>
contact with the side surface section 122a, 122b is formed at a lower portion of the annular projection 156.<br>
In this arrangement, the annular projection 156 functions as follows.  That is, when the outer roller 146 rolls along the axial direction of the outer cup 112, then the first engaging surface 158 is engaged with the ceiling section 120, and the second engaging surface 160 is engaged with the shoulder 125. Accordingly, the attitude of the outer roller 146 is maintained so that the outer roller 146 is substantially parallel to the axial direction.<br>
The spherical surface 136 of the trunnion 128a (I28b, 128c) and the recess 140 of the inner roller 142 are provided to make surface-to-surface contact with each other. Therefore, the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) is provided rotatably in the direction of the arrow A about a center of a point O (see FIG. 26) with respect to the inner roller 142, and it is provided rotatably in the circumferential direction (direction of the arrow B) along the spherical surface 136 about a center of rotation of the axis of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c).<br>
Further, the trunnion 128a (128b, 12Bc) and the inner roller 142 are provided displaceably in the vertical direction (direction of the arrow C) in an integrated manner with respect to the needle bearings 144 held by the outer roller 146.<br>
Furthermore, trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) is provided slidably in the axial direction (direction of the arrow D)<br><br>
of the outer cup along the guide track 118 by the aid of the outer roller 146 provided with the annular projection 156 to make engagement with the groove 124a, 124b.<br>
The constant  velocity universal joint 110 according to the tenth embodiment of the present invention is basically constructed as described above.  Next, its operation, function, and effect will be explained.<br>
The rotary force of the outer cup 112 is transmitted to the inner roller 142 via the needle bearings 144 and the outer roller 146 contacting with the guide track 118.  The rotary force is transmitted to the trunnions 128a (128b, 128c) via the spherical surfaces 136 which make surface-to-surface contact with the recesses 140 of the inner rollers 142.  Thus, the second shaft 113, which Is engaged with the trunnions 128a (128b, 128c), is rotated.<br>
In this arrangement, when the second shaft 113 is inclined by a predetermined angle with respect to the outer cup 112 provided with the first shaft, then the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) makes sliding movement in the direction of the arrow A about the center of rotation of the point O, or the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) makes sliding movement in the circumferential direction (direction of the arrow B) along the recess 140 having the spherical surface about the center of rotation of the axis of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c), while maintaining the state in which the spherical surface 136 of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) makes surface-to-surface contact with the recess 140 having the spherical<br><br>
surface formed on the inner roller 142.<br>
The trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) is also displaced along the axial direction (direction of the arrow C) of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) integrally with the inner roller 142 which makes sliding movement with respect to the needle bearings 144 held by the outer roller 146.<br>
Further, the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) is displaced in the direction substemtially perpendicular to the axis of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c), I.e., In the longitudinal direction of the guide track 118 by the aid of the outer roller 146 which makes sliding movement along the guide track 118.  In this arrangement, the first engaging surface 158 Is engaged with the ceiling section 120, and the second engaging surface 160 is engaged with the shoulder 125. Accordingly, the attitude of the outer roller 146 is maintained so that the outer roller 146 is substantially parallel to the axial direction of the outer cup 112.<br>
Therefore, it Is possible to decrease the sliding friction of the outer roller 146, and it is possible to suppress the occurrence of friction resulting from the sliding friction, by maintaining the attitude of the outer roller 146 so that the outer roller 146 is substantially parallel to the axial direction of the outer cup 112.<br>
The outer roller 146 is provided such that it slides along the guide track 118 by the aid of the annular projection 156 and the outer circumferential surface 162, and it rolls on the guide track 118 by the aid of the needle<br><br>
bearings 144 intervening between the outer roller 146 and the inner roller 142. Therefore, it is possible to decrease the coefficient of friction.  Further, the outer roller 146 makes surface-to-surface contact with the guide track 118 via the annular projection 156 and the outer circumferential surface 162.  Therefore, the contact area is increased, and it is possible to reduce the contact surface pressure.<br>
Thus, the rotary motion of the first shaft is smoothly transmitted to the second shaft 113 without being affected by the angle of inclination of the second shaft 113 with respect to the outer cup 112.<br>
In the tenth embodiment, the spherical surface 136 is provided on the side surface of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) to make sliding movement with respect to the inner roller 142 formed with the recess 140 corresponding to the spherical surface 136.  Further, the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) and the inner roller 142 are provided displaceably along the axial direction of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c). Thus, it is possible to decrease the slide resistance and reduce the induced thrust force.  Furthermore, the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) and the recess 140 of the inner roller 142 make surface-to-surface contact with each other to reduce the contact surface pressure.  Thus, it is possible to improve the durability of the constant velocity universal joint 110.<br>
Next, a method for assembling the constant velocity universal joint according to the tenth embodiment of the<br><br>
iresent invention will be explained below, as exemplified by I case in which the trunnion 128a {128b, 128c) is installed .nto the hole 150 of the inner roller 142.<br>
The inner roller 142 (see FIG. 31), which is provided ;ith the substantially elliptic cutout 152, is used as :ollows.  That is, as shown in FIG. 36, the trunnion 128a ;i28b, 128c) is inserted along the substantially elliptic ;utout 152, while inclining the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) jy an angle 6 with respect to the inner roller 142.  Thus, :he inner roller 242 is installed to the trunnion 128a [128b, 128c).  In this arrangement, the second shaft 113 ixtends in a direction substantially perpendicular to the Diane of paper of FIG. 36.<br>
Symbols in FIGS. 35 and 36 are as follows.  That is, the assembling angle is represented by 6.  The radius of the spherical surface 136 of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) is represented by R.  The spherical surface width of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) is represented by H.  The short radius of the cutout 152 of the inner roller 142 is represented by r.  The width of the inner roller 142 is represented by h.  The radius of the trunnion 12aa (128b, 128c) is represented by d.  The projected long width of the spherical surface 136 of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c), which is obtained when the assembling angle is inclined by 9, is represented by X.  The projected short width of the spherical surface 136 of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c), which is obtained when the assembling angle is inclined by<br><br>
9, Is represented by Y.  The clearance between the cutout 152 of the inner roller 142 and the neck section 130 of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) is represented by 6.<br>
In this embodiment, the condition, under which the projected short width Y of the spherical surface 136 of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) is smaller than 2R (diameter of the spherical surface) (the spherical surface 136 is ensured within the width h of the inner roller 142), is represented by the following expression (1).<br>

The configurations of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) and the cutout 152 of the inner roller 142 are designed so that the foregoing expressions (1) to (3) are satisfied.  It<br><br>
is assumed that the assembling angle 8 is set to be larger than the angle formed by the axis of the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c) and the axis of the inner roller 142 determined on the basis of the operation angle of the constant velocity universal joint 110 (angle formed by the first shaft and the second shaft 113) on the plane of paper of FIG, 36 (plane including the central axes of the three trunnions 128a to 128c).<br>
On the other hand, the columnar trunnion 133a (133b, 133c) (see FIG. 29) provided with the forcibly inserted ring member 135 is installed as follows to the inner roller 142a (see FIG. 37) which is provided with the pair of mutually opposing cutouts 152a, 152b.  In this case, the spherical surface 136 of the trunnion 133a (133b, 133c) is inserted into the recess 140 of the inner roller 142 along the pair of cutouts 152a, 152b in a state in which the upper surface 154 of the inner roller 142 is allowed to be substantially perpendicular to the upper surface of the trunnion 133a (133b, 133c).  The trunnion 133a (133b, 133c) is Inclined so that the axis of the trunnion 133a (133b, 133c) is substantially perpendicular to the upper surface of the inner roller 142.  Thus, the inner roller 142 is installed to the trunnion 133a (133b, 133c).<br>
Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 41, the trunnion 128a (128b, 128c), which is formed to expand from the spider boss 126, may be constructed such that the neck section 130 is provided at a position deflected with respect to the axial<br><br>
direction from the central portion of the ring-shaped spider boss 126.<br>
Next, a constant velocity universal joint 170 according to the eleventh embodiment of the present invention Is shown in FIGS. 42 to 44. The same constitutive components as those of the constant velocity universal joint 110 according to the tenth embodiment are designated by the same reference numerals, detailed explanation of which will be omitted.<br>
The constant velocity universal joint 110 according to the tenth embodiment is different from the constant velocity universal joint 170 according to the eleventh embodiment in that the former comprises the outer cup 112 which is formed in the integrated manner, while the latter comprises an outer cup 172 which is composed of two members.<br>
That is, as shown in FIG. 44, the outer cup 172 of the constant velocity universal joint 170 according to the eleventh embodiment has three expanded sections 174a to 174c which extend in the axial direction and which are formed and separated from each other by 120 degrees respectively about the central axis.  The outer cup 172 comprises a main body 176 for forming guide tracks 118 between the adjoining expanded sections  174a to  174c, and a cylindrical member 178 for being externally fitted to the expanded sections I74a to 174c. An 0-ring 180 for preventing any leakage of lubricating oil charged at the inside is installed at a connecting section between the main body 176 and the cylindrical member 178.<br><br>
An annular groove 182 for fastening a boot (not shown) by the aid of an uniilustrated band is formed at one end of the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical member 178.  In this embodiment, the cylindrical member 178 is formed by means of press working of an uniilustrated iron plate.  The annular groove 182 is simultaneously formed by means of press working as well.<br>
Therefore, the constant velocity universal Joint 170 according to the eleventh embodiment is advantageous as follows.  That is, the formation of the annular groove 182, which has been performed by machining in the conventional technique, can be performed substantially simultaneously by means of the press working of the cylindrical member 178. Therefore, it Is possible to eliminate the step required for the machining and Improve the production efficiency.<br>
The other construction, function, and effect are the same as those of the constant velocity universal joint 110 according to the tenth embodiment, detailed explanation of which is omitted.<br>
The tenth and eleventh embodiments have been explained by using the tripod type constant velocity universal joints 110, 170 each of which is provided with the three trunnions 128a to 128c, 133a to 133c.  However, there is no limitation thereto.  It is a matter of course that the present invention is also applicable to uniilustrated bipod type constant velocity universal joints.<br>
Next, a constant velocity universal joint 210 according<br><br>
to the twelfth embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIGS. 45 to 54.  The same constitutive components as those of the constant velocity universal joint 110 according to the tenth embodiment are designated hy the same reference numerals, detailed explanation of which will be omitted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 45, each of trunnions 228a (228h, 228c) comprises a neck section 230 which expands radially outwardly from a ring-shaped spider boss 126, and a head section 232 which is constructed integrally with the neck section 230 and which is formed to have a thin-walled flat configuration.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 49 to 54, a nape section 233, which slightly expands toward the adjoining trunnion 228b (228c, 228a), is integrally formed on one side along the circumferential direction of the spider boss 126, of the neck section 230 of each of the trunnions 228a (228b, 228c). As shown in FIG. 52, the nape section 233 has its cross-sectional configuration which is gradually tapered-off toward the adjoining trunnion 228b as viewed from the side of the head section 232.  As shown in FIG. 54, the nape section 233 has its cross-sectional configuration which is formed to have a substantially linear shape substantially along the vertical direction and substantially continuously to a slightly narrow part 235 of the head section 232 as viewed in the axial direction of the second shaft 113.<br>
Comparison and investigation will now be made for the shape of a comparative trunnion 270a (270b, 270c) (see FIGS.<br><br>
61 to 66) and for the shape of the trunnion 228a (228b, 228c) according to the twelfth embodiment.<br>
In the case of the comparative trunnion 270a (270b, 270c), the cross-sectional configuration of the neck section 274 of the trunnion 270a (270b, 270c) is formed to be a perfect circle as viewed from the side of the head section 272.  On the contrary, in the case of the trunnion 228a (228b, 228c) for constructing the constant velocity universal joint 210 according to the twelfth embodiment, the nape section 233, which expands merely slightly toward on© side of the adjoining trunnion 228b (228c, 228a), is formed. The cross-sectional configuration thereof is formed to have the curved configuration which is gradually tapered-off as viewed from the side of the head section 232.<br>
In the case of the comparative trunnion 270a (270b, 270c), the narrow part 276 (see FIG. 66) of the head section 272 is large, and it is formed in linear symmetry in which the axis of the head section 272 is the axis of symmetry, as viewed in the axial direction of the second shaft 113. On the contrary, in the case of the twelfth embodiment, the diameter of the neck section 230 is large as compared with the comparative trunnion 270a (270b, 270c), and the trunnion 228a (228b, 228c) is formed asymmetrically.<br>
Therefore, in the twelfth embodiment, the support cross-sectional area of the trunnion 228a to 228c can be increased, and it is possible to further improve the strength of the trunnion 228a to 228c.  Further, in the<br><br>
twelfth embodiment, the nape section 233 is formed only one side along the circumferential direction of the spider boss 226.  Therefore, the assembling performance of the trunnion 228a to 228c is not inhibited with respect to the inner roller 142.  Thus, it is possible to smoothly assemble the trunnion 228a to 228c to the inner roller 142.  Furthermore, the cross-sectional shape of the nape section 233, which is formed to have the curved configuration, makes it possible to simplify the structure of an unillustrated die to be used for integrally forming the trunnions 228a to 228c including the spider boss 126.<br>
Next, trunnions 280a to 280c according to a modified embodiment are shown in FIGS. 55 to 60.  The trunnion 280a to 280c according to this modified embodiment differs in that the cross-sectional configuration of a nape section 232 is angular as viewed from the side of the head section 232 (see FIG. 58).  The cross-sectional configuration, which is formed to be angular, is advantageous in that the support cross-sectional area of the trunnion 280a to 280c can be made larger.  The other function and effect are the same as those of the foregoing embodiment, detailed explanation of which is omitted.<br><br><br>
