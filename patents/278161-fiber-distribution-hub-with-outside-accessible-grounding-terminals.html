Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit of provisional application Serial No.<br>
60/783,818 filed on March 17, 2006, and is also a continuation in part of U.S.<br>
application Serial No. 11/354,286 filed on February 13, 2006, which applications are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
Background<br>
Passive optical networks are becoming prevalent in part because<br>
service providers want to deliver high bandwidth communication capabilities to<br>
customers. Passive optical networks are a desirable choice for delivering high-speed<br>
communication data because they may not employ active electronic devices, such as<br>
amplifiers and repeaters, between a central office and a subscriber termination. The<br>
absence of active electronic devices may decrease network complexity and/or cost<br>
and may increase network reliability.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a network 100 deploying passive fiber optic lines.<br>
As shown, the network 100 can include a central office 101 that connects a number<br>
of end subscribers 105 (also called end users 105 herein) in a network. The central<br>
office 101 can additionally connect to a larger network such as the Internet (not<br>
shown) and a public switched telephone network (PSTN). The network 100 can also<br>
include fiber distribution hubs (FDHs) 103 having one or more optical splitters (e.g.,<br>
l-to-8 splitters, 1 -to-16 splitters, or l-to-32 splitters) that generate a number of<br>
individual fibers that may lead to the premises of an end user 105. The various lines<br>
of the network 100 can be aerial or housed within underground conduits.<br>
The portion of the network 100 that is closest to central office 101 is<br>
generally referred to as the F1 region, where F1 is the "feeder fiber" from the central<br>
office 101. The portion of the network 100 closest to the end users 105 can be<br>
referred to as an F2 portion of network 100. The network 100 includes a plurality of<br>
break-out locations 102 at which branch cables are separated out from the main<br>
cable lines. Branch cables are often connected to drop terminals 104 that include<br>
 <br>
connector interfaces for facilitating coupling of the fibers of the branch cables to a<br>
plurality of different subscriber locations 105.<br>
Splitters used in an FDH 103 can accept a feeder cable F1 having a<br>
number of fibers and may split those incoming fibers into, for example, 216 to 432<br>
individual distribution fibers that may be associated with a like number of end user<br>
locations. In typical applications, an optical splitter is provided prepackaged in an<br>
optical splitter module housing and provided with a splitter output in pigtails that<br>
extend from the module. The splitter output pigtails are typically connectorized<br>
with, for example, SC, LC, or LX.5 connectors. The optical splitter module<br>
provides protective packaging for the optical splitter components in the housing and<br>
thus provides for easy handling for otherwise fragile splitter components. This<br>
modular approach allows optical splitter modules to be added incrementally to FDHs<br>
103 as required.<br>
It is common for F1 and F2 cables to be routed underground. When<br>
underground construction or other activity is to be undertaken in areas where<br>
underground cables are buried, it is necessary to mark the locations of the buried<br>
cables before the activity is undertaken. In the case of shielded/armored cables, a<br>
field technician can transmit a locator signal (e.g., an RF signal) through the metal<br>
shielding of the cables, and then use an above ground sensor (e.g., an RF detector) to<br>
detect the signal along the length of the cable and thereby identify the location of the<br>
cable. As the cable is detected, the technician can apply a spray paint line to the<br>
ground surface so that the location of the underlying cable is identified. By marking<br>
the ground surface, the likelihood for the cable to be broken or otherwise damaged<br>
during the underground activity is reduced.<br>
In the case of shielded/armored cables, the cables are preferably<br>
grounded for safety. In a typical configuration, a grounding plate having grounding<br>
pins is provided within the interior of a fiber distribution hub cabinet. The shields of<br>
the F1 and F2 cables are electrically connected to the pins of the grounding plate by<br>
wires. One of the pins is electrically connected to ground (e.g., a metal rod, post or<br>
other member driven into the ground). In this type of hub arrangement, for the field<br>
technician to mark the F1 and F2 lines, it is necessary for the field technician to gain<br>
access to the interior of the cabinet. Once the cabinet is open, the technician can<br>
disconnect the cable of interest from ground and transmit the locator signal through<br>
 <br>
the shielding of the cable. After the location of the cable has been marked, the<br>
shield of the cable is reconnected to ground.<br>
Field technicians responsible for marking underground cable are<br>
often not employed by the service provider that owns and operates the fiber<br>
distribution hub. Furthermore, field technicians responsible for marking cable are<br>
typically not trained wilh respect to the telecommunications equipment typically<br>
housed within a fiber distribution hub. Therefore, it can be undesirable for the field<br>
technician to have access to the interior of the fiber distribution hub. Moreover, the<br>
cabling and other components within a fiber distribution hub can often block access<br>
to the grounding plate and/or make the grounding plate difficult to find. Therefore,<br>
it is desirable to have a fiber distribution hub having a configuration which allows a<br>
field technician to access the grounding plate without having to open the primary<br>
cabinet of the fiber distribution hub.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Referring now to Figures 2-7, an example fiber distribution hub<br>
(FDH) 200 in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure is shown. The<br>
FDH 200 includes a cabinet 201 that houses internal components. The cabinet 201<br>
includes openings through which a feeder cable (e.g., or F1 cable) 700 and a<br>
subscriber cable 708 enter and exit the cabinet 201 (see Figure 2C). A swing frame<br>
300 is pivotably mounted on hinges 355 within the cabinet 201. The swing frame<br>
300	includes bulkhead 301 that divides the swing frame 300 into a front portion 302<br>
(see Figure 4) and a back portion 304 (see Figure 2C). The bulkhead 301 includes a<br>
main panel 310 having a termination region 311 and a storage region 313.<br>
Generally, at least one termination module 400 (see Figures 13A and 13B) is<br>
provided at the termination region 3 1 1 and at least one storage module 600 (see<br>
Figure 9) is provided at the storage region 313. In some embodiments, the bulkhead<br>
301	also includes a secondary panel 315 positioned adjacent the main panel 310 and<br>
configured for cable management. One or more feeder cable interfaces 800 can be<br>
positioned within the rear portion of the swing frame 300. At least one splitter<br>
module housing 322 accommodating one or more splitter modules 500 is positioned<br>
at the top of the swing frame 300.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic diagram showing an example cable routing<br>
scheme for the FDH 200. The FDH 200 generally administers connections at a<br>
 <br>
termination panel between incoming fiber and outgoing fiber in an Outside Plant<br>
(OSP) environment. As the term is used herein, "a connection" between fibers<br>
includes both direct and indirect connections. Examples of incoming fibers include<br>
the feeder cable fibers that enter the cabinet and intermediate fibers (e.g.,<br>
connectorized pigtails extending from splitters and patching fibers/jumpers) that<br>
connect the feeder cable fiber to the termination panel. Examples of outgoing fibers<br>
include the subscriber cable fibers that exit the cabinet and any intermediate fibers<br>
that connect the subscriber cable fibers to the termination panel. The FDH 200<br>
provides an interconnect interface for optical transmission signals at a location in the<br>
network where operational access and reconfiguration are desired. For example, as<br>
noted above, the FDH 200 can be used to split the feeder cables and terminate the<br>
split feeder cables to distribution cables routed to subscriber locations. In addition,<br>
the FDH 200 is designed to accommodate a range of alternative sizes and fiber<br>
counts and support factory installation of pigtails, fanouts and splitters.<br>
As shown at Figure 3, a feeder cable 700 is initially routed into the<br>
FDH 200 through the cabinet 201 (e.g., typically through the back or bottom of the<br>
cabinet 201 as shown in Figure 2C). In certain embodiments, the fibers of the feeder<br>
cable 700 can include ribbon fibers. An example feeder cable 700 may include<br>
twelve to forty-eight individual libers connected to a service provider central office<br>
101. In some embodiments, after entering the cabinet 201, the fibers of the feeder<br>
cable 700 are routed to a feeder cable interface 800 (e.g., fiber optic adapter<br>
modules, a splice tray, etc.). At the feeder cable interface 800, one or more of the<br>
fibers of the feeder cable 700 are individually connected to separate splitter input<br>
fibers 702. The splitter input fibers 702 are routed from the feeder cable interface<br>
800 to the splitter module housing 322. At the splitter module housing 322, the<br>
splitter input fibers 702 are connected to separate splitter modules 500, wherein the<br>
input fibers 702 are each split into multiple pigtails 704, each having connectorized<br>
ends 706. In other embodiments, however, the fibers of the feeder cable 700 can be<br>
conneclorized and can be routed directly to the splitter modules 500 thereby<br>
bypassing or eliminating the need for an intermediate feeder cable interface 800.<br>
When the pigtails 704 are not in service, the connectorized ends 706<br>
can be temporarily stored on a storage module 600 that is mounted at the storage<br>
region 313 of the swing frame 300. When the pigtails 704 are needed for service,<br>
<br>
 <br>
the pigtails 704 are routed from the splitter modules 500 to a termination module<br>
400 that is provided at the termination region 311 of the swing frame 300. At the<br>
termination module 400, the pigtails 704 are connected to the libers of a distribution<br>
cable 708. The termination panel is the dividing line between the incoming fibers<br>
and the outgoing fibers. A typical distribution cable 708 forms the F2 portion of a<br>
network (see Figure 1) and typically includes a plurality of fibers (e.g., 144, 216 or<br>
432 fibers) that are routed from the FDH 200 to subscriber locations 709.<br>
In some embodiments, one or more of the fibers of the feeder cable<br>
700 are not connected to any of the splitter modules 500. Rather, these fibers of the<br>
feeder cable 700 are connected to pass-through fibers 712 having connectorized ends<br>
714. The pass-through libers 712 are connected to the termination modules 400,<br>
without first connecting to the splitter modules 500. By refraining from splitting a<br>
fiber 712, a stronger signal can be sent to one of the subscribers. The connectorized<br>
ends 714 of the pass-through fibers 712 can be stored at the storage region 313 when<br>
not in use.<br>
Referring back to Figures 2A-2C, the cabinet 201 of the FDH 200<br>
includes a lop panel 202, a bottom panel 203, a right side panel 204, a left side panel<br>
206, a back panel 205, and at least one front door. In some embodiments, the at<br>
least one front door includes a right door 210 and a left door 212. In one<br>
embodiment, the front doors 210, 212 include a lock 211. The at least one front<br>
door is pivotally mounted to the cabinet 201 using hinges 214, 216 to facilitate<br>
access to the components mounted within the cabinet 201.<br>
In general, the cabinet 201 of the FDH 200 is configured to protect<br>
the internal components against rain, wind, dust, rodents and other contaminants.<br>
However, the cabinet 201 remains relatively lightweight for easy installation, and<br>
breathable lo prevent accumulation of moisture in the unit. In some embodiments,<br>
an aluminum construction with a heavy powder coat finish also provides for<br>
corrosion resistance. In one example embodiment, the cabinet 201 is manufactured<br>
from heavy gauge aluminum and is NEMA-4X rated. In other embodiments,<br>
however, other materials can also be used.<br>
In accordance with example embodiments, the FDH 200 is provided<br>
in pole mount or pedestal mount configurations. For example, as shown in Figure 2,<br>
loops 218 can be provided on the cabinet 201 for facilitating deployment of the<br>
 <br>
cabinet 201 at a desired location. The loops 218 can be used to position the cabinet<br>
using a crane. In particular, the crane can lower the cabinet 201 into an underground<br>
region. Jn some embodiments, the loops 218 are removable or can be adjusted to not<br>
protrude from the top cabinet panel 202.<br>
Still referring to Figures 2B-2C, the swing frame 300 of the FDH 200<br>
includes a top panel 320, a bottom panel 330, a right side panel 340, and a left side<br>
341. A hinge-mounting strip 350 is positioned at the left side 341 of the swing<br>
frame 300. As depicted at Figure 4, the bulkhead 301 further includes a connecting<br>
panel 3 19 that connects the main panel 310 to the hinge-mounting strip 350. As<br>
shown best at Figure 4, a portion 325 of the secondary panel 315 extends upwardly<br>
past the lop panel 320 of the swing frame 300. The bulkhead 301 extends vertically<br>
between the top and bottom panels 320, 330, and laterally between the right side<br>
panel 340 and the left side 341.	.	.<br>
In some embodiments, the hinge-mounting strip 350 of the swing<br>
frame 300 is mounted to the cabinet 201 of the FDH 200 using one or more hinges<br>
355. The hinges 355 enable the entirety of the swing frame 300, including the<br>
termination modules 400, the storage modules 600, the feeder cable interface device<br>
800, and the splitter modules 500, to be swung out of the front doors 210, 212 of the<br>
cabinet 201 to enable access to optical components in the rear portion 304 of the<br>
swing frame 300 for cleaning, testing, maintenance, additions, etc. Pivoting the<br>
swing frame 300 out of the cabinet 201 causes the right side panel 340 of the swing<br>
frame 300 to move away from the interior volume of the cabinet 201. In some<br>
example embodiments, the swing frame 300 can be pivoted ninety degrees or more<br>
out of the cabinet 201.<br>
In some embodiments, the hinges 355 of the swing frame 300 are<br>
positioned to provide a single point of flex for the fiber cable routed to the swing<br>
frame 300. This hinge point is constructed to control the fiber bend. In particular,<br>
the hinges 355 and cable management devices, which are discussed in greater detail<br>
herein, are designed to ensure that manufacture recommended bend radii are<br>
maintained when the swing frame 300 is opened or closed. In one embodiment, the<br>
cabinet 201 can be configured at a factory, or plant, so as to have cable bundles<br>
dressed around the hinges 355. Preconfiguring the cabinet 201 reduces the chance<br>
that cabling will be done incorrectly.<br>
 <br>
When the swing frame 300 is in the open position, as shown in Figure<br>
2C, components in the rear portion 304 of the swing frame 300 are accessible. For<br>
example, a rear side of the main panel 310 and a rear side of the secondary panel<br>
315 are accessible. In addition, the splitter modules 500 located in the splitter<br>
module housing 322 (see Figure 4) are accessible through the open top of the swing<br>
frame 300 when the swing frame 300 is swung out of the cabinet 201. In contrast,<br>
when the swing frame 300 is in the closed position (see Figure 2B), only<br>
components on the front portion 302 of the swing frame 300 are readily accessible.<br>
In example embodiments, the swing frame 300 includes a release<br>
latch (not shown) that locks the swing frame 300 in a closed position within the<br>
cabinet 201 of the FDH 200 until the latch is actuated. Once the latch is actuated,<br>
the swing frame 300 can be pivoted out of the cabinet 201. In addition, a pivoting<br>
locking member (not shown) can be mounted to rear side 304 of the swing frame<br>
300 to hold the swing frame 300 in the open position.<br>
Referring to Figures 4-5, the storage region 3 13 of the swing Frame<br>
300 is located below the termination region 311. In other embodiments, however,<br>
the storage region 313 can be above or adjacent to the termination region 311. In<br>
general, the termination region 311 defines at least one rectangular opening 312<br>
through which adapters 450 (see Figures 13A-13B) from a termination module 400<br>
extend. The termination modules 400 arc described in greater detail herein. In the<br>
embodiment shown in Figure 4, the termination region 311 includes two columns of<br>
openings 3 12 with each column including twelve elongated slots. Strips 309<br>
separate the openings 312 of each column and provide surface area for adhering<br>
labeling information (e.g., connector designation). The storage region 313 also<br>
defines one or more openings 314 into which storage modules 600 (see Figure 9) are<br>
mounted. The storage modules 600 are described in greater detail herein.<br>
The bulkhead 301 bifurcates the bottom panel 330 into a front portion<br>
331 (see Figure 4) and a rear portion 336 (see Figure 2C and 14). In general, the<br>
front portion 331 of the bottom panel 330 projects forwardly from the bulkhead 301.<br>
In some embodiments, the front portion 33 1 is further divided into a first front<br>
portion 332 and a second front portion 334. Each front portion 332, 334 includes a<br>
flange 333, 335, respectively, that protrudes substantially perpendicular from the<br>
bottom panel 330. The front portion 331 of the bottom panel 330 thereby forms a<br>
<br>
 <br>
trough configured to retain slack or excess fiber from the storage region 313 or from<br>
the secondary panel 315. Edge 337 of the first front portion 332 is angled to allow<br>
the swing frame 300 to pivot open without interference from the trough.<br>
As best shown in Figures 4 and 6, the bulkhead divides the side pane!<br>
340 into front and rear flanges 342, 344, respectively. The front flange 342 extends<br>
forwardly from the secondary panel 315 and the rear flange 344 extends rearwardly<br>
from the secondary panel 315. The rear flange 344 extends from the bottom panel<br>
330 to a bend limitcr 962 extending from the top panel 320. The front flange 342<br>
extends from the bottom panel 330 past the top panel 320 to the protruding portion<br>
325 of the secondary panel 315. In some embodiments, the front flange 342<br>
includes a forward portion 344 substantially parallel to the rear flange 344 and an<br>
angled portion 343 extending between the protruding portion 325 of the secondary<br>
panel 315 and the forward portion 344.<br>
As best shown in Figure 7, the top panel 320 of the swing frame 300<br>
is substantially rectangular. The top panel 320 includes front and back edges 326,<br>
327. F1anges 323, 324 (see Figure 4) protrude upward from the edges 326, 327,<br>
respectively. The top panel 320 also has a iirsl end 328 adjacent side 341 and a<br>
second, opposite end 329 adjacent the side panel 340. A bend radius limiter 940<br>
extends upward from the first end 328. In some embodiments, a portion of the end<br>
329 of the top panel 320 defines a width of a channel B with the front flange 342 of<br>
the side panel 340. The portion of the end 329 defining the channel B terminates<br>
before reaching the remaining portion of the end 329. The depth of the channel B<br>
extends from the secondary panel 315 to the flange 335 of the second front portion<br>
33 of the bottom panel 330.<br>
The splitter module housing 322 of the FDH 200 is positioned on the<br>
top panel 320 adjacent the first end 328. The splitter module housing 322 serves to<br>
protect, organize, and secure the splitter modules 500 of the FDH 200. The splitter<br>
module housing 322 can be constructed in various sizes to accommodate different<br>
numbers of splitter modules 500. The splitter module housing 322 is generally<br>
rectangular and defines one or more locations within the open interior sized to<br>
accept one or more optical splitter modules 500. To accommodate the splitter<br>
modules 500, the module housing 322 includes structure for supporting/securing the<br>
splitter modules 500. In example embodiments, the splitter modules 500 are<br>
<br>
 <br>
designed to snap into the splitter module housing 322. In one embodiment, the<br>
splitter modules 500 are loaded into the splitter module housing 322 from front to<br>
back (i.e., from the side facing end 329 to the side facing end 328). The module<br>
housing 322 is further configured to enable the splitter modules 500 to receive an<br>
input fiber, such as fiber 702 of Figure 3, on one end of the splitter module 500 and<br>
to output multiple fibers, such as pigtails 704 of Figure 3, from the opposing end of<br>
the splitter 500.<br>
Referring now to Figures 8A-8C, one type of splitter module 500 that<br>
can be mounted in the splitter module housing 322 is a splitter having an integral<br>
connector. Figure 8A is a left side view of such a splitter module 500. The splitter<br>
module 500 includes a housing 505 having at least one protective boot 510<br>
protruding frontwardly and at least one integral connector 520 protruding<br>
rearwardly. In the embodiment shown, two boots 510 protrude from the front and<br>
two integral connectors 520 protrude rearwardly from the splitter housing 505. In<br>
one example embodiment (not shown), each splitter has four integral connectors<br>
520. In some embodiments, a handle 540 also protrudes from the front end of the<br>
splitter housing 505. Figure 8B is an exploded view of the splitter module 500 of<br>
Figure 8A showing the internal components of the splitter module 500.<br>
Figure 8C shows a cross-section of the splitter module 500 of Figure<br>
7A inserted in the splitter module housing 322. An adapter assembly 530 is secured<br>
to the splitter module housing 322 using a fastener 536. In one embodiment, adapter<br>
assemblies 530 are mounted at the backside of the splitter module housing 322. The<br>
adapter assembly 530 is configured to receive the connectors 520 of the splitter<br>
module 500 when the splitter module 500 is inserted into the splitter module housing<br>
322. As shown, the adapter assembly 530 is further configured to receive an<br>
opposing connector associated with the feeder cable 700. In some embodiments, the<br>
adapter assembly 530 receives a connector 703 terminating a splitter input fiber 702.<br>
In other embodiments, the adapter assembly 530 receives a connector 701<br>
terminating the feeder cable 700 itself. In this way, the feeder cable fibers 700 can<br>
be readily coupled to the splitter modules 500.<br>
Other embodiments of splitter modules 500 do not include integral<br>
connectors 520. In such embodiments, adapter assemblies 530 are not mounted at<br>
the splitter module housing 322 and the feeder cables 700 cannot be plugged directly<br>
<br>
 <br>
into the splitter modules 500. Rather, input pigtails (not shown) pass through the<br>
splitter housing 505 and enter the splitter module 500. The opposing ends of the<br>
input pigtails can be connectorized or unconnectorized. If the ends 701 terminate in<br>
connectors (not shown), then the input fibers 702 are interfaced with the feeder cable<br>
700 using an adapter module 810 (see Figure 18). If the ends 701 are<br>
unconnectorized, then the input Fibers 702 arc spliced with the feeder cable 700<br>
using a splice tray 808 (see Figure 19).<br>
Typically, each splitter module 500 receives between one and four<br>
fibers and outputs between two and sixteen fibers 704 for every input fiber. In one<br>
example embodiment, four input fibers 702 enter a splitter module 500 and thirty-<br>
two pigtail fibers 704 exit the splitter module 500. Further information regarding<br>
the splitter module 500 can be found in U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
11/354,297, filed February 13, 2006, entitled "Fiber Optic Splitter Module", which<br>
is hereby incorporated by reference. Additional information on other types of<br>
splitter modules can be found at U.S. application serial no. 10/980,978, filed<br>

Modules For Fiber Distribution Hubs," the disclosures of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
Referring now to Figures 9-10, the splitter modules 500 and storage<br>
modules 600 can be incrementally added to the swing frame 300. Figure 9<br>
illustrates a splitter module 500 having multiple connectorized pigtails 704 exiting<br>
from a protective boot 510 on the splitter module 500. The connectorized pigtails<br>
704 are typically stored in one or more storage modules 600 prior to installation on<br>
the swing frame 300. In some embodiments, the connector 706 of each pigtail 704<br>
is secured in a storage module 600 before the splitter module 500 leaves the factory.<br>
Typically, the connectorized pigtails 704 of each splitter module 500 are routed to<br>
four storage modules 600 each holding eight connectors.<br>
The storage module 600 includes a body 610 having a front side 602<br>
and a rear side 604. The body 610 is configured to hold at least one fiber connector<br>
<br>
 <br>
706. Typically, the body 610 is configured to hold about eight connectors 706. In<br>
some embodiments, the body 610 is arranged to retain the fiber connectors 706 in a<br>
single row configuration. In other embodiments, the body 610 can be arranged to<br>
hold the connectors 706 in a square pattern or in any other desired configuration.<br>
More information regarding the storage modules 600 can be found in U.S.<br>
application serial no. 10/610,325, filed on June 30, 2003, entitled "Fiber Optic<br>
Connector Holder and Method"; U.S. application serial no. 10/613,764, filed on July<br>
2, 2003, entitled "Telecommunications Connection Cabinet;" and U.S. application<br>
serial no. 10/871,555, filed on June 18, 2004, entitled "Multi-position Fiber Optic<br>
Connector Holder and Method," the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
In some embodiments, the body 610 is designed to snap into one of<br>
the openings 3 14 defined in the storage region 313 of the main panel 310. The<br>
openings 3 14 can be arranged in any desired configuration within the storage region<br>
313 of the main panel 310. In the example shown in Figure 10, the storage region<br>
313 of the main panel 310 defines nine openings 314 in a rectangular pattern. Each<br>
opening 314 is configured to receive a storage module body 610 arranged to retain<br>
eight fiber connectors 706 in a row.<br>
As shown in Figure 10, when the splitter module 500 is loaded into<br>
the splitter module housing 322 during installation, the corresponding storage<br>
modules 600 are loaded onto the storage region 313 of the main panel 310. For ease<br>
in viewing, only one splitter 500 having one pigtail 704 and one storage module 600<br>
is illustrated. The pigtail 704 extending from the splitter module 500 to the storage<br>
module 600 is routed from the protective boot 510, across the top panel 320, down<br>
through the channel B on the front side of the secondary panel 315, and across the<br>
bottom panel 330 of the swing frame 300.<br>
To accomplish this routing, the top panel 320 and secondary panel<br>
315 include cable management arrangements. In some embodiments, the cable<br>
management arrangements on the top panel 320 include a first spool 952 positioned<br>
between the splitter housing 322 and the bend radius limiter 962 and a second spool<br>
954 positioned between the bend limiter 940 and the front flange 342. Pigtails 704<br>
output from the splitter-500 are first wrapped around the first spool 952 and then<br>
around the second spool 954.<br>
 <br>
A bend radius limiter 964 having labs 965 and extending downward<br>
from the top panel 320 partially defines the channel B. From' the second spool 954,<br>
some of the pigtails 704 are routed over the bend limiter 964 and into the channel B.<br>
In some embodiments, a partial fiber spool 966 is mounted to extend from the<br>
protruding portion 325 of the secondary panel 315 and is also oriented to route fiber<br>
into the channel B. To avoid excessive weight or entanglement of the fibers 704,<br>
some of the fibers 704 can be routed into channel B over the partial spool 966<br>
instead of bend limiter 964. Extra slack can also be taken up by routing the pigtails<br>
704 over spool 966 instead of over bend limiter 964. A bend limiter 968 can also be<br>
mounted on the protruding portion 325 of the secondary panel 315 and oriented to<br>
route liber up to the partial spool 966.<br>
The front of the secondary panel 315 includes at least one row of<br>
partial spools 970 and at least one row of radius limiters 980. In one example<br>
embodiment, the partial spools 970 are oriented to enable fiber routed down channel<br>
B to wrap at least partially around one of the spools 970. The fiber can travel from<br>
the partial spools 970 either along the bottom panel 330 to the storage modules 600<br>
or over the limiters 980 to the termination modules 400. The limiters 980 are<br>
oriented to enable fiber routed from the partial spools 970 to travel to the<br>
termination modules 400 without excessive bending.<br>
Referring now to Figure 11, when a pigtail 704 retained in a storage<br>
module 600 should be connected to a subscriber distribution line 708, the<br>
corresponding connector 706 is removed from the storage module 600 and<br>
transferred to the appropriate adapter 450 on a termination module 400. During this<br>
transfer process, the fiber may need to be rewound around a different partial spool<br>
970, such as partial spool 972, in order to reach the adapter 450. From the partial<br>
spool 972, the fiber can be routed around a suitable limiter 980 to avoid excessive<br>
bending before reaching the adapter 450. In some embodiments, the fiber is also fed<br>
through support fingers 990 extending from the termination section 3 1 1 of the main<br>
panel 310 before plugging into the adapter 450. When all of the fibers 704<br>
originally secured in the storage module 600 have been routed to subscriber<br>
termination modules 400, the empty storage modules 600 can be removed to make<br>
room for a new splitter module 500 and new storage modules 600.<br>
 <br>
Referring now to Figures 12A-12B, as time passes and the number of<br>
subscribers increases, a user can add termination modules 400 to the swing frame<br>
300. Figures 12A and 12B show one example of a termination module 400. The<br>
termination module 400 includes a termination leg 410 and a management leg 420<br>
arranged in a substantially L-shaped configuration. In some embodiments, a linking<br>
section 430 connects the termination leg 410 to the management leg 420. In other<br>
embodiments, the linking section 430 is monolithicaliy formed with either the<br>
termination leg 410 or the management leg 420. In still other embodiments, the<br>
termination leg 410, the management leg 420, and the linking section 430 are<br>
monolithicaliy formed (e.g., are constructed as a single piece of bent sheet metal).<br>
In some embodiments, a front side of the termination leg 410 of the<br>
termination module 400 (shown in Figure 12B) mounts to the rear side of the main<br>
panel 310. In one embodiment, the termination leg 410 mounts to the main panel<br>
310 using screws 417. In other embodiments, however, other fasteners such as<br>
bolls, rivets, nails, and other such devices can be used to connect the module 400 to<br>
the main panel 310. In still other embodiments, the module 400 can be attached to<br>
the main panel 310 using adhesive.<br>
Each termination module 400 includes at least one row of fiber optic<br>
adapters 450 for connecting the fibers of the main cable 700 to the fibers of the<br>
distribution cable 708. Each adapter 450 has a front end 452 and a rear end 454.<br>
The front end 452 of each adapter 450 is configured to retain a connector 714 of a<br>
fiber 7 ] 2 interfaced with the main line 700, or the connector 706 of a fiber 704 split<br>
from the main line 700. The rear end 454 of each adapter 450 is configured to retain<br>
a connector 710 of a fiber of the distribution cable 708. The adapters 450 protrude<br>
through the termination leg 410 so that the connectors 706 enter the front ends 452<br>
of the adapters 450 from a front side of the main panel 310 and the connectors 710<br>
of the distribution cable 708 enter the adapters 450 from a rear side of the main<br>
panel 310.<br>
In the depicted embodiment, each module 400 includes six horizontal<br>
rows of adapters 450 that cooperate to define two side-by-side banks of adapters.<br>
When the module 400 is mounted to the main panel 310, the front side of the leg 410<br>
abuts against the backside of the main panel 310, and the rows of adapters 450<br>
 <br>
project forwardly through the corresponding horizontal slots 314 defined by the<br>
panel 310.<br>
The management leg 420 extends rearwardly from the termination leg<br>
410. Each management leg 420 includes an appropriate number of fanouts 424 to<br>
accommodate the number of adapters 450 on the module 400. For example, in one<br>
embodiment, the termination leg 410 of a module 400 includes six rows of adapters<br>
450, each row having twelve adapters 450, and the management leg 420 includes six<br>
12:1 fanouts 424. As the term is used herein, a 12:1 fanout is a fanoul configured to<br>
receive twelve optical fibers and to output a single cable ribbon containing the<br>
twelve fibers. In another embodiment, nine 8:1 fanouts or three 24:1 fanouts could<br>
be provided instead of the 12:1 fanouts. In still other embodiments, fanouts can be<br>
used to upjacket the fiber.<br>
In some embodiments, the termination module 400 is precabled at the<br>
factory to include a connectorized distribution fiber 708 coupled to each adapter<br>
450. Dust caps 453 are generally provided on the front ends 452 of the adapters 450<br>
to protect the terminated distribution fibers 708 from dust, dirt, and other<br>
contaminants. The connector 710 of each distribution fiber 708 is mounted within<br>
the rear end 454 of an adapter 450 and the distribution fibers 708 are routed from the<br>
connector 710 to the fanouls 424 provided on the management leg 420 of the<br>
termination module 400. In still other embodiments, the termination module 400 is<br>
not precabled and dust caps 455 are also provided on the rear ends 454 of the<br>
adapters 450 to protect the adapters 450.<br>
In some embodiments, the management leg 420 of the termination<br>
module 400 also includes at least one cable management device 425 for managing<br>
excess fiber length of the distribution fibers 708. Generally, in such systems, the<br>
fibers 708 are routed first to the cable management device 425 and then to the<br>
fanouts 424. Examples of cable management devices 425 include a fiber spool, one<br>
or more radius bend limiters, one or more fiber clips, and other such devices. In the<br>
example shown, the management leg 420 includes a fiber spool 426 formed from<br>
two radius bend limilcrs. Each radius bend limiler includes a flange 427 for<br>
retaining the fiber on the spool 426. In some embodiments, one or more fiber cable<br>
clips 428 for retaining fiber cables can be spaced between the radius bend limiters of<br>
the spool 426.<br>
 <br>
Referring now to Figure 13, the management leg 420 of the<br>
termination module 400 includes an opening 422 through which the fibers are routed<br>
from the cable management devices 425 to the fanouts 424. Upon exiting the<br>
fanouts 424, the ribbon fibers are routed to a cabinet fanout (not shown) or other<br>
cable interface device. In other embodiments, the fanouls 424 are provided on the<br>
same side of the management leg 420 as the cable management device 425. In such<br>
embodiments, the ribbon fibers are routed from the fanouls 424 through the<br>
openings 422 and to the cabinet fanout. The cabinet fanout is mounted to the<br>
interior of the cabinet 201 and is not attached to the swing frame 300. The cabinet<br>
fanout can be used to reduce the ribbon fibers into a single jacketed stub cable that<br>
exits the FDH 200. The stub cable is spliced to a subscriber distribution cable<br>
outside of the FDH 200. In various embodiments, the stub cable ranges in length<br>
from about 25 feel to about 300 feet. In other embodiments, the distribution cable<br>
708 can be routed into the cabinet 201 and spliced or otherwise connected to the<br>
fiber 708.<br>
Referring now to Figure 14, the rear side 304 of the swing frame 300<br>
forms an open chamber adapted to house at least one termination module 400. The<br>
open chamber is defined by the bulkhead 301, the top panel 320, the bottom panel<br>
330, and the side panel 340. Figure 14 is a rear perspective view of (bur termination<br>
modules 400 mounted in the open chamber. The adapters 450 have been removed<br>
for ease in viewing. In other embodiments, any desired number of termination<br>
modules 400 can be mounted on the swing frame 300. The termination modules 400<br>
are configured to mount to the rear side of the termination region 311 of the main<br>
panel 310.<br>
Figure 15 shows a left side view of a swing frame 300 having four<br>
termination modules 400 mounted therein. When multiple termination modules 400<br>
are mounted to the rear side of the main panel 310, the management legs 420 of the<br>
termination modules 400 form a partial side panel opposing the side panel 340. In<br>
some embodiments, the management legs 420 of the modules 400 are secured to one<br>
another or to the swing frame 300. In other embodiments, shown in Figure 15, the<br>
modules 400 are secured to the swing frame 300 only at the termination leg 410 and<br>
the management legs 420 are free floating.<br>
 <br>
Referring now to Figures 16-19, the swing frame 300 can be<br>
configured with different interface devices 800 (see Figure 3) and cable management<br>
devices to create multiple fiber pathways between the incoming feeder cable 700<br>
and the distribution lines 708. The interface devices 800 and management devices<br>
used in a particular configuration will depend on whether it is desirable to split the<br>
feeder cable 700 and what type of splitter module 500 is utilized.<br>
In some embodiments, the feeder cable 700 connects to one or more<br>
splitter input fibers 702. In one such embodiment, a first end 701 of a splitter input<br>
fiber 702 is connectorized. In another such embodiment, the first end 701 is<br>
unconnectorized. The opposite end 703 of the input fiber 702 can either interface<br>
with an integral connector 520 on the splitter module 500, such as when using the<br>
splitter module depicted in Figures 8A-8C, or can penetrate the splitter housing 505.<br>
In other embodiments, however, the feeder cable 700 has connectors configured to<br>
interface with integral connectors 520 of the splitter module 500.<br>
Figure 16 is a rear view of the swing frame 300 adapted to interface a<br>
connectorized feeder cable 700 with a splitter module 500. To accomplish this<br>
interlace, the cable management devices are arranged according to a configuration<br>
Cl. In configuration Cl, a cable storage spool 922 and one or more partial storage<br>
spools 924 are mounted to the side panel 340 of the swing frame 300. A fanout<br>
device 926 is mounted adjacent the spools 922, 924. A radius limiter 936 is<br>
mounted from the secondary panel near the corner formed by the top panel 320 and<br>
side panel 340. Support fingers 932 projecting downward from the top panel 320<br>
form a path A along which fibers can be routed from one end 329 of the top panel<br>
320 to the other end 328. In some embodiments, the support fingers 932 include a<br>
multi-pronged clip 934 having at least two fingers 932, each finger 932 extending in<br>
a different direction. In one example embodiment, the multi-pronged clip 934<br>
includes four fingers 932 positioned orthogonally relative to one another. Any<br>
excess fiber length can be taken up by winding the pigtails 702 around the multi-<br>
pronged clip 934. A limiter 940 having tabs 945 extends from the top panel.<br>
To connect the feeder cable 700 to the splitter 500, the cable 700 is<br>
first routed around spools 922, 924 and then to the fanout device 926. The fanout<br>
device 926 separates the fibers of the feeder cable 700 into individual input fibers.<br>
Any excess length of the individual fibers of the feeder cable 700 can be stored by<br>
<br>
 <br>
wrapping the fibers around the spools 922, 924. The fibers of the Feeder cable 700<br>
are next routed around the limiter 936 and along the path A using the support fingers<br>
932 projecting downward from the top panel 320. The feeder cable 700 is next<br>
curved around the limiter 940 extending from the top panel 320 and plugged directly<br>
into at least one of the adapter assemblies 530 secured to the splitter module housing<br>
322. The fibers of the feeder cable 700 can be protected while being routed within<br>
the swing frame 300 by loose buffer tubes.<br>
Figure 17 is a rear perspective view of the swing frame 300 adapted<br>
to interface a connrctorized feeder cable 700 to a splitter module 500. The cable<br>
management devices are arranged according to a variation of configuration Cl. The<br>
storage spools 922, 924 and fanout device 926 are mounted to the rear side of the<br>
secondary panel 315 rather than the side panel 340. In other embodiments (not<br>
shown), the storage spools 922, 924 and fanout device 926 could be mounted to the<br>
bottom panel 330. Regardless of the location of the spools 922, 924 and fanout<br>
device 926, the feeder cable 700 is still routed from the fanout device 926 to the<br>
bend limiter 936, along path A, over the bend limiter 940 and to the adapter<br>
assembly 530 mounted on the splitter module housing 322.<br>
Referring now to Figures 18-19, the feeder cable 700 can be<br>
interfaced with splitter inputs 702 using at least one interface device 800 rather than<br>
connecting directly to the splitter 500. Figure 18 is a rear perspective view of the<br>
swing frame 300 configured to interface a connectorized feeder cable 700 with a<br>
splitter module 500 through intermediate splitter input fibers 702. Each splitter<br>
input fibers 702 has a first connectorized end 703 that plugs into one of the adapter<br>
assemblies 530 opposite the integral connectors 520 of the splitters 500. In other<br>
embodiments not using a splitter having an integral connector, however, the splitter<br>
input 702 is a pigtail that penetrates the splitter housing 505 rather than plugging<br>
into an adapter assembly 530. Each splitter input fibers 702 also has a second<br>
connectorized end 701 that interfaces with a connectorized end of a fiber of the<br>
feeder cable 700.<br>
Such input pigtails 702 are routed from the adapter assembly 530<br>
over the bend radius limiter 940 and underneath the top panel 320 as shown in<br>
Figure 16. In particular, the input pigtails 702 are routed along the path A towards<br>
the side panel 340 using the support fingers 932 and then around the radius bend<br>
<br>
 <br>
limiter 936. The ends 701 of the input pigtails are then connected to the feeder cable<br>
700 using a first adapter module 820. In some embodiments, the first adapter'<br>
module is mounted to the secondary panel 315 adjacent the bottom panel 330. In<br>
other embodiments, however, the first adapter module 820 can be secured to the<br>
bottom panel 330 or the side panel 340. The first adapter module 820 includes<br>
multiple adapters 825 arranged in one or more rows. In some embodiments, each<br>
row includes about six adapters 825. Additional information regarding the adapter<br>
module 820 can be found in U.S. application serial no. 11/095,033, filed March 31,<br>
2005, and entitled " Adapter Block Including Connector Storage;" and U.S. patent<br>
nos. 5,497,444; 5,717,810; 5,758,003; and 6,591,051, the disclosures of which are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In order to connect the feeder cable 700 to the first adapter module<br>
820, additional cable management devices are provided according to a second<br>
configuration C2. The second configuration C2 includes a fanoul device 901 and<br>
one or more full or partial slack storage fiber spools 902, 904, respectively. In the<br>
example shown, the fanoul device 901 and storage spools 902, 904 are mounted to<br>
the bottom panel 330.<br>
The feeder cable 700 is first routed to the fanout device 901, which<br>
separates the fibers of the ribbon cable 700 into individual fibers. Any excess length<br>
of the individual fibers of the feeder cable 700 can be stored in the slack storage<br>
spool 902 and partial slack storage spools 904. The fibers of the feeder cable 700<br>
are next routed to the first adapter module 820. The connectorized ends of the<br>
feeder cable 700 are mounted into one end of the adapters 825 of the first adapter<br>
module 820. The connectorized ends 701 of the input fibers 702 are routed from the<br>
radius limiter 936 to the opposite end of the adapters 825 of the first adapter module<br>
820. The adapters 825 provide an interface between the connectors of the feeder<br>
cable fibers 700 and the connectors 701 of the input fibers 702.<br>
Figure 19 is a rear perspective view of the swing frame 300<br>
configured for use with a splitter module and a feeder cable 700 having<br>
unconnectorized ends. The feeder cable 700 is spliced to splitter input fibers 702<br>
having unconnectorized second ends 701. In order to connect the feeder cable 700<br>
to the unconnectorized fiber inputs 702, a splice tray 830 is provided at the rear side<br>
304 of the swing frame 300.<br>
<br>
 <br>
In order to connect the feeder cable 700 to the splice tray 830,<br>
additional cable management devices are provided according to a third configuration<br>
C3. The third configuration C3 includes a fanout device 907 and one or more radius<br>
bend limiters 906 mounted around the splice tray 830. Additionally, at least one<br>
radius bend limiter 908 is positioned adjacent the splice tray 830. Each limiter 906<br>
includes a tab 907 to maintain the fibers in a loop around the limiters 906. The<br>
limiters 906 arc oriented to prevent fiber from catching on the comers of the splice<br>
tray 830. In some embodiments, the splice tray 830 and limiters 906 are positioned<br>
on the back of the secondary panel 315. In other embodiments, however, the splice<br>
tray 830 and limiters 906 can be positioned in any desired location at the rear side<br>
304 of the swing frame 300.<br>
The unconnectorized ends of the feeder cable 700 are routed around<br>
the limiters 906 and to the splice tray 808. Any excess length of the individual<br>
fibers of the feeder cable 700 can be stored by wrapping the fibers around the splice<br>
tray 830. The input fibers 702 from the splitter module 500 are routed from the<br>
radius limiter 936 around the limiter 908 and into the splice tray 830. The<br>
unconnectorized ends of the feeder cable 700 are then spliced with the<br>
unconnectorized ends 701 of the input fibers 702.<br>
Still referring to Figures 16-19, in some embodiments, it may be<br>
desirable not to split one or more of the feeder cables 700 to enable transmission of a<br>
stronger or more reliable signal to a subscriber. In some embodiments, therefore,<br>
the swing frame 300 is further configured to enable at least one fiber (referred to as a<br>
pass-through fiber) 712 to interface with a fiber from the feeder cable 700. The<br>
pass-through fiber 712 bypasses the splitter modules 500 and proceeds to the front of<br>
the swing frame 300 to interface with a distribution line 708.<br>
To accomplish such a routing, the swing frame 300 includes an<br>
opening 910 in the rear flange 344 of the side panel 340. In some embodiments, the<br>
opening 910 includes a radius limiter 912 (best seen in Figure 13) extending outward<br>
from the outside surface of flange 344 to prevent excessive bending of a fiber routed<br>
through the opening 910. A tab 915 can also be pressed outward in rear flange 344<br>
to define a channel up the outer side of the rear flange 344. A radius bend limiter<br>
962 links the rear flange 344 of the side panel 340 to the top panel 320. Additional<br>
 <br>
cable management devices are provided based on the configuration C1, C2, C3 with<br>
which the swing frame 300 is set up.<br>
Referring to Figure 17, if the swing frame 300 is arranged according<br>
to configuration Cl, then the connectorized fibers of the feeder cable 700 are<br>
connected to the input fibers 702 using a second adapter module 810. The adapter<br>
module 810 includes multiple fiberoptic adapters 815 configured to accept<br>
connectorized fibers from either end. The swing frame 300 also includes additional<br>
cable management in the form of a bend radius limiter 906 and slack storage spools<br>
902, 904.<br>
To bypassing the splitter modules 500, the feeder cable 700 is still<br>
routed around spools 922, 924 to the fanout device 926. Prom the fanout device<br>
926, however, the feeder cable fibers 700 are routed back around spools 922, 924,<br>
around bend limiter 926 and then around spools 902, 904. From the spools 902,<br>
904, the connectorized ends of the fibers 700 are secured to the adapter module 810.<br>
The adapter module 810 connects the fibers 700 with connectorized ends of pass-<br>
through fibers 712 that are routed out the opening 910, up the side panel 340, over<br>
the limiter 962, and onto the top panel 320. From the top panel 320, the pass-<br>
through fibers 712 are routed towards the termination modules 400 as described<br>
above with reference to Figures 10 and 11.<br>
Referring to Figure 18, pass-through fibers 712 can also be used with<br>
the second configuration C2. The feeder cable 700 is still routed first to the fanout<br>
device 901 and then to one end of the adapter module 820 with any slack being<br>
stored in spools 902, 904. However, instead of splitter pigtails 702 connecting to the<br>
other end of the adapter module 820, the pass-through pigtails 712 are plugged into<br>
the adapter module 820. The pass-through pigtails 712 then follow the same routing<br>
pattern as discussed in the previous paragraph.<br>
Referring to Figure 19, the pass-through pigtails 712 can also be<br>
spliced to unconnectorized ends of the feeder cable 700. If such a configuration is<br>
desired, then the swing frame 300 is provided with the second adapter module 810<br>
discussed above with reference to Figure 1 7. The feeder cable 700 is still routed<br>
around limiters 906 and up to the splice tray 830 according to the configuration C3.<br>
Any excess length of the individual fibers of the feeder cable 700 can be stored by<br>
wrapping the fibers around the limiters 906. However, the fibers of the feeder cable<br>
<br>
 <br>
700 are spliced to connectorized pigtails 711 rather than to the splitter inputs 702.<br>
From the splice tray 830, the connectorized pigtails 711 are routed around the<br>
storage spools 902, 904 and then plugged into the second adapter module 810. The<br>
second adapter module 810 connects the pigtails 711 with the pass-through<br>
connectorized fibers 712 that are routed out of the opening 910, up the side panel<br>
340 to the limiter 962, and onto the top panel 320.<br>
The pass-through fibers 712 bypass the splitter module 500 and are<br>
routed around, the second fiber spool 954 of the top panel 320 and into the channel B<br>
via either the limiter 964 or the partial spool 966. The routing of the pass-through<br>
fiber 712 along the front side 302 of the swing frame is substantially the same as the<br>
routing of the splitter pigtails 704 discussed above with reference to Figures 10 and<br>
11. Typically, a pass-through fiber 712 is immediately connected to a subscriber line<br>
708 via an adapter 450 on a termination module 400. In some embodiments,<br>
however, the pass-through fibers 712 can be stored in empty locations on the storage<br>
modules 600.<br>
Figures 20-29 show alternative fiber distribution hubs (FDH) having<br>
features in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure. One example<br>
FDH 200' is shown in Figures 20-23. The fiber distribution hub 200' includes a<br>
cabinet 201 housing the same components previously described with respect to the<br>
fiber distribution hub 200. For example, the cabinet 201 defines a primary<br>
compartment 230 that can be accessed by opening front doors 210, 212. Swing<br>
frame 300 is pivotally mounted within the primary compartment 230. A termination<br>
region and a storage region are provided on the swing frame. Splitters are also<br>
provided on the spring frame. Further details regarding the internal components of<br>
the primary compartment 230 can be found by referring to the detailed description<br>
pertaining to the fiber distribution hub 200.<br>
The fiber distribution hub 200 has been modified to include a<br>
secondary compartment 232 that can be accessed from the backside of the cabinet<br>
201. The secondary compartment 232 can also be referred to as a pocket, recess,<br>
inset region, chamber, or like terms. The secondary compartment 232 can be<br>
accessed by opening a secondary door 234. The secondary door 234 is located on<br>
the outside of the cabinet 200'. When the secondary door 234 is open, access is<br>
provided to the secondary compartment 232, but no access is provided to the<br>
<br>
 <br>
primary compartment 230 of the cabinet 201'. Therefore, a field technician can<br>
quickly find and enter the secondary compartment 232 without disturbing any of the<br>
internal telecommunications components of the fiber distribution hub 200'.<br>
Referring to Figure 22, the secondary compartment 232 is defined by<br>
a plate 235 having a mounting flange portion 237 and an enclosure portion 239. The<br>
mounting flange portion 237 extends around the perimeter of the enclosure portion<br>
239. The enclosure portion 239 projects rearwardly from the mounting flange<br>
portion 237 and defines a generally rectangular recess that forms the secondary<br>
compartment 232. The secondary door 234 is shown pivotally connected to the<br>
plate 235 by a hinge 240. The secondary door 234 can be secured in a closed<br>
position by any conventional latching arrangement. In one embodiment, the<br>
secondary door 234 can be held in a closed position by a bolt (not shown) that<br>
extends through opening 242 and threads into a fixed nut (not shown) secured with<br>
an opening 244 of the plate 235.<br>
As shown best at Figure 20, the plate 235 mounts to a back wall 246<br>
of the cabinet 201'. The back wall 246 of the cabinet 201' has an opening 248 for<br>
receiving the enclosure portion 239 of the plate 235. To mount the plate 235 to the<br>
back wall 246, the enclosure portion 239 is inserted through the opening 248 and the<br>
mounting flange portion 237 of the plate 235 is fastened (e.g., with bolts or other<br>
fasteners) to the back wall 246. A sealing gasket 250 (shown at Figure 23) can be<br>
provided between the mounting flange portion 237 and the back wall 246 to prevent<br>
moisture from entering the primary compartment 230 of the cabinet 201'. When the<br>
plate 235 is mounted to the back wall 246, the enclosure portion 239 projects<br>
slightly into the primary compartment 230 as shown at Figure 21.<br>
The secondary compartment 232 is configured to protect and provide<br>
ready access to a grounding interface 255 used to interconnect the cabinet 201' and<br>
shielded cables entering/exiting the cabinet 201' to gTound. As shown at Figure 22,<br>
the grounding interface 255 includes terminals such as a chassis grounding post 260<br>
and five cable grounding posts 262. In a preferred embodiment, the posts 260, 262<br>
are all externally threaded along their lengths. The posts 260, 262 all pass through<br>
openings defined by an electrically conductive bus plate 266. In one embodiment,<br>
the bus plate is metal such as copper. Plate contact members such as flanged nuts<br>
264 are threaded on each of the posts 260, 262. When the flanged nuts 264 are<br>
<br>
 <br>
threaded down in contact with the bus plate 266, the bus plate 266 functions as an<br>
electrical bus that electrically connects all of the grounding posts 260, 262 to one<br>
another. The chassis grounding post 260 is preferably electrically connected to<br>
ground. Therefore, when all of the posts 260, 262 are electrically connected to one<br>
another by the bus plate 266, the posts 260, 262 are all commonly grounded.<br>
When a field technician needs to direct a locator signal through the<br>
shields of one of the cables grounded through the grounding interface, it is desirable<br>
to disconnect the shield of the cable from ground and to isolate the selected cable<br>
from the other cables. Preferably, this is done in a easy, non-lime consuming<br>
manner. In the depicted embodiment, a given cable can be disconnected from<br>
ground by merely backing off the flanged nut 264 corresponding to the cable a<br>
sufficient amount so that the flanged nut 364 no longer contacts the bus plate 266.<br>
With the Hanged nut backed off, the selected cable grounding post 262 is<br>
disconnected from the chassis grounding post 260. This allows a locator signal to be<br>
easily directed through the selected cable grounding post 262 to the shield of the<br>
cable desired to be located.<br>
Figure 23 shows an example mounting configuration for the bus plate<br>
266. As shown at Figure 23, each cable grounding post 262 is electrically isolated<br>
from the bus plate 266 by a first dielectric bushing 270 and is electrically isolated<br>
from the plate 235 by a second dielectric bushing 272. The dielectric bushings 270,<br>
272 arc preferably generally cylindrical sleeves that fit over the cable grounding<br>
posts 262 and fit within openings defined by the bus plate 266 and the plate 235,<br>
respectively. The first and second post retention nuts 274, 276 are threaded on the<br>
cable grounding posts 262 to lock the posts 262 in place and prevent axial<br>
movement of the posts 262. For example, the post retention nuts 274, 276 arc<br>
threaded toward one another on the posts 262 until the plate 235 is clamped between<br>
the nuts 274, 276. Dielectric insulating washers 277, 278 are mounted between the<br>
post retention nuts 274, 276 and the plate 235 such that the nuts 274, 276 are<br>
electrically isolated from the plate 235. Additional nuts 280 can be provided on the<br>
cable grounding posts 262 for use in connecting wires to the posts. For example,<br>
one end of a wire can be clamped between nuts 280, 276 while the other end is<br>
electrically connected (e.g., by a clip) to the metal shield of a cable routed to the<br>
fiber distribution hub 200'.<br>
 <br>
The chassis grounding post 260 is mounted in a slightly different<br>
configuration because it is typically not desired to isolate the chassis grounding post<br>
260 from the bus plate 266 or the plate 235. In the depicted embodiment, nuts 286,<br>
288 are used to clamp the chassis grounding posts 260 to the plate 235. No bushings<br>
or other isolators are provided between the plate 235 and the chassis grounding post<br>
260. Thus, the chassis grounding post 260 is electrically connected to the plate 235,<br>
preferably at all limes. An additional nut 289 can be used to secure a grounding<br>
wire to the chassis grounding post 260. The grounding wire 290 preferably runs<br>
from the chassis grounding post 260 to ground. A nut 292 is also provided on the<br>
chassis grounding post 260 to improve electrical connection between the bus plate<br>
266 and the chassis grounding post 260.<br>
In alternative embodiments, a dielectric bushing can also be provided<br>
between the chassis grounding post 260 and the bus plate 266. In this way, by<br>
backing off flange nut 292, all five of the cable grounding post 262 will be<br>
disconnected from ground. In this way, a technician may be able to simultaneously<br>
direct locating signals through all of the cable shields by directing the signal through<br>
one of the cable grounding posts 262.<br>
As described above, the chassis grounding post 260 functions to<br>
ground the cabinet 201'. Therefore, an electrical connection preferably exists<br>
between the plate 235 and the main body of the cabinet 201'. This may be provided<br>
by regions of metal-to-metal contact between the mounting flange portion 237 of the<br>
plate 235 and the back wall 246 of the cabinet 201'. Alternatively, a wire 294 can<br>
also be used to provide an electrical connection between the main back wall 246 and<br>
the plale 235. Similar wires can be used to provide electrical connections between<br>
the front doors 210, 212 and the main body of the cabinet 201'.<br>
Referring again to Figures 21 and 23, interior ends of the posts 260,<br>
262 are located within the primary compartment 230 of the cabinet 201'. As shown<br>
at Figure 23, the interior end of the chassis grounding post 260 is electrically<br>
connected to ground 297 (e.g., a metal post pounded in the ground) by a wire 251<br>
that extends from the interior end of the post 260 through the bottom of the cabinet<br>
to ground. Similarly, the interior ends of the two depicted cable grounding posts<br>
262 are electrically connected to the shields of cables 298, 299 routed to the fiber<br>
distribution hub 200'. Conventional wires 252, 253 can be used to provide the<br>
<br>
 <br>
electrical connections between the interior ends of the posts 262 and the cables 298,<br>
299. Once the wires 251-253 have been connected, there is no need for the wires<br>
251-253 to be later disturbed or disconnected by a field technician. Instead, rather<br>
than working inside the main compartment 230, the cables 298, 299 can be<br>
individually isolated from outside the primary cabinet 230 within the secondary<br>
compartment 232.<br>
In general use, a field technician arriving at the fiber distribution hub<br>
200' merely needs to open the secondary door 234 to access the grounding interface<br>
255. With the secondary door 234 open, the technician identifies the cable<br>
grounding post 262 corresponding to the buried cable desired to be located. The<br>
field technician then loosens the flanged nut 264 corresponding to the selected cable<br>
grounding post 262 such that the post 262 is electrically isolated from the bus plate<br>
266 and disconnected from ground. With the post 262 electrically isolated, a locator<br>
signal can be transmitted through the cable grounding post 262 to the shield of the<br>
underground cable desired to be located. After the cable has been located and<br>
marked, the flanged nut 264 is tightened back down against the bus plate 266 such<br>
that the cable is again electrically connected to ground.<br>
Figures 24-29 illustrate an alternative secondary compartment 232'<br>
that can be accessed from the backside of the cabinet 201'. The secondary<br>
compartment 232' can be accessed by opening a secondary door 234' (Figure 27)<br>
located on the outside of the cabinet 200'. The secondary door 234' is substantially<br>
similar to the secondary door 234 previously described with respect to Figures 20-<br>
23. When the secondary door 234' is open (see Figure 28), access is provided to the<br>
secondary compartment 232', but no access is provided to the primary compartment<br>
230 of the cabinet 201' (Figure 21). Therefore, a field technician can quickly find<br>
and enter the secondary compartment 232' without disturbing any of the internal<br>
telecommunications components of the fiber distribution hub 200'.<br>
In general, the secondary compartment 232' is defined by a plate 235'<br>
(Figure 24) having a mounting flange portion 237' and an enclosure portion 239'<br>
(Figure 25). The mounting flange portion 237' extends partially around the<br>
perimeter of the enclosure portion 239'. The enclosure portion 239' projects from<br>
the mounting flange portion 237' towards the primary compartment 230 of the<br>
cabinet 200'. The enclosure portion 239' defines a generally rectangular recess that<br>
<br>
 <br>
forms the secondary compartment 232'. The plate 235' generally mounts to a panel<br>
of the cabinet 201', such as to the back wall 246 (Figure 20), in substantially the<br>
same manner as previously described with respect to the plate 235, For example,<br>
with fasteners 238'.<br>
The secondary compartment 232' is configured to protect and provide<br>
ready access to a grounding interface 255' used to interconnect the cabinet 201' and<br>
shielded cables entering/exiting the cabinet 201' to ground. Jn general, the shielded<br>
cables are grounded by feeding conventional electrical grounding wires 252', 253'<br>
from the cables 298, 299 (Figure 21) into the secondary compartment 232' and<br>
coupling electrical contacts 258' on the ends of the electrical grounding wires 252',<br>
253' to the grounding interface 255'.<br>
The electrical grounding wires 252', 253' are fed into the secondary<br>
compartment 232' through openings defined between the enclosure portion 239' of<br>
the plate 235' and the back wall 246 of the cabinet 201". Support structures 268<br>
typically extend along these openings to enclose the secondary compartment 232' to<br>
protect the internal components of the primary compartment 230' and the internal<br>
components of the secondary compartment 232'. The support structures 268 also<br>
guide the electrical wires 252', 253' into the secondary compartment 232'. For<br>
example, foam inserts 268 having one or more apertures 269 through which the<br>
electrical wires 252', 253' can be routed can be provided on one or both sides of the<br>
secondary compartment 232'.<br>
As shown at Figure 24, the grounding interface 255' includes<br>
terminals such as grounding posts 262'. In a preferred embodiment, the grounding<br>
posts 262' arc all externally threaded along their lengths. The posts 262' protrude<br>
from one or more electrically conductive bus plates 266' (see Figure 27). In one<br>
embodiment, a bus plate 266' is formed from a metal, such as copper, and the posts<br>
262' are welded to the bus plate 266'. The bus plate 266' functions as an electrical<br>
bus that electrically connects the grounding posts 262' to one another. The bus plate<br>
266' is preferably electrically connected to ground, thereby electrically connecting<br>
all of the grounding posts 262' to a common ground.<br>
The bus plate 266' can be electrically connected to ground in a variety<br>
of ways. For example, one of the grounding posts 262' may serve as a chassis<br>
grounding post as discussed above with reference to the grounding interface 255. In<br>
<br>
 <br>
other embodiments, the bus plate 266' is mounted to the plate 235', for example<br>
using bolts 236', to electrically connect the bus plate 266' and the plate 235'. The<br>
plate 235' is mounted to the cabinet 201', which can be electrically connected to<br>
ground<br>
Figures 26-27 show one example mounting configuration for the bus<br>
plate 266'. As shown, each cable grounding post 262' has a base end secured (e.g.,<br>
welded, press-fit, or otherwise fixed) within an opening defined by the bus plate<br>
266'. First and second nuts 280', 282' are provided on each of the cable grounding<br>
posts 262' for use in connecting the wires 252', 253' to the grounding posts 262'<br>
(Figure 28).<br>
For example, an electrical contact 258' on one end of a wire 252' can<br>
be clamped between the first and second nuts 280', 282' as shown in Figure 28. In<br>
some embodiments, dielectric insulating washers (not shown) can be mounted<br>
between the electrical contact and the first nut 280' and between the electrical<br>
contact and the second nut 282' to electrically isolate the electrical contact from the<br>
nuts 280', 282'.<br>
When it is desirable to disconnect the shield of a cable from ground<br>
and to isolate the selected cable from the other cables, the electrical contact 258' on<br>
the wire 252' is removed from the grounding post 262'. The electrical contact 258' is<br>
removed by first removing the first nut 280' from the post 262' and then pulling the<br>
electrical contact 258' off of the post 262'. With the electrical contact removed, the<br>
selected electrical wire 252' is disconnected from ground while the grounding post<br>
262' remains grounded. This allows a locator signal to be easily directed through the<br>
electrical wire 252' to the shield of the cable desired to be located.<br>
It will be appreciated that the fiber distribution hub 200 can be<br>
manufactured in a variety of different sizes. However, to promote manufacturing<br>
efficiency, it is preferred for the splitters to be manufactured with pigtails having<br>
uniform lengths. To accommodate the different sizes of fiber distribution hubs, the<br>
pigtails are preferably designed long enough to work in the largest fiber distribution<br>
hub expected to be used. For the smaller distribution hubs, excess length provided<br>
in the pigtails can be taken up by wrapping the excess length around at fiber storage<br>
areas. For example, the excess length can be wrapped around spools 252, 254 (see<br>
Figure 7) provided at the top of the swing frame.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Figure 30 shows a swing frame 300' that utilizes an alternative<br>
technique for using pigtails of uniform length in different sized fiber distribution<br>
hubs. The swing frame 300' of Figure 30 has a splitter module housing 322'<br>
mounted at the front, top left side of the swing frame. To account for different<br>
dimensions on different size swing frames, the splitter mount can be mounted at<br>
different locations on the top side of the swing frame. For example, if the standard<br>
size pigtail is loo short to reach the termination panel on a given swing frame with<br>
the splitter mount located at the far left corner of the top of the swing frame, the<br>
splitter mount can be moved to a middle mounting location 257, or a right mounting<br>
location 259 so that additional length is provided to the pigtails.<br>
Referring now to Figures 31 -34, yet another fiber distribution hub<br>
(FDH) 200" having features in accordance with the principles of the present<br>
disclosure is shown. The Fiber distribution hub 200" includes another example<br>
cabinet 201". The cabinet 201" has been modified to include cable management<br>
panels 220 mounted to the back panel 205 and/or the side panels 204, 206 of the<br>
cabinet 201" (sec Figures 31 and 32). The cable management panels 220 can<br>
include the loops 222 that are punched into the panels 220. The tie loops 222 allow<br>
cable ties to be threaded there through to secure one or more cables in a fixed<br>
position with respect lo the panels 204-206 of the cabinet 201".<br>
Referring now to Figure 33, the fiber distribution hub 200" can mount<br>
to an access compartment 1000. The access compartment 1000 includes a top panel<br>
1002, a bottom panel 1003, a right side panel 1004, a left side panel 1006, a back<br>
panel 1005, and a front panel 1008. These panels 1002-1006 and 1008 define an<br>
interior 1020. The top panel 1002 defines an opening configured to align with an<br>
opening defined in a bottom panel 203' of the cabinet 201" when the cabinet 201" is<br>
mounted to the access compartment 1000. The bottom panel 1003 defines a cable<br>
access opening.<br>
In some embodiments, the fibers of the feeder cable 700 and the<br>
subscriber cable 708 are optically coupled to stub cable fibers from the cabinet 201'<br>
within the access compartment 1000. The optical connection can be accessed<br>
through an opening defined in the front panel 1008. The opening in the front panel<br>
1008 is normally covered by a removable access panel 1010 or by a door.<br>
 <br>
Referring now to Figure 34, the cabinet 201" houses another swing-<br>
frame 300". The swing frame 300" is pivotally mounted within the primary<br>
compartment 230' (Figure 31) of the cabinet 201". In general, the swing frame 300"<br>
has substantially the same component regions as swing frame 300 described above.<br>
The swing frame 300" has been modified from swing frame 300, however, to<br>
include a frame member 360 mounted to the rear of the swing frame 300" to secure<br>
the end of the management leg 420 of each termination module 400 opposite the<br>
termination leg 410.<br>
The frame member 360 provides support for the termination modules<br>
400 and, in particular, supports the weight of the management legs 420 after cables<br>
have been routed through the termination modules 400. The frame member 360<br>
generally extends between the top panel 320 and the bottom panel 330 of the swing<br>
frame 300". In a preferred embodiment, one end 361 of the frame member 360<br>
secures to the bottom panel 330 and an opposite end 362 secures to the flange 324 of<br>
the top panel 320.<br>
The swing frame 300" also includes a ramp 365 coupled to the top<br>
panel 320 of the swing frame 300". The ramp 365 is positioned adjacent the end 329<br>
of the top panel in place of the partial fiber spool 966 and bend limiter 968 (compare<br>
Figure 34 with Figure 7). The ramp 365 inhibits the fibers from bending beyond a<br>
minimum bend radius when the fibers transition from the top panel 320 to the front<br>
302 of the swing frame 300". The ramp 365 can also take up (i.e., store) excess<br>
slack in the fiber. The ramp 365 can include tabs 368 to inhibit fiber from spilling<br>
off the sides of the ramp 365. In a preferred embodiment, the ramp 365 is<br>
removable.<br>
