ANTI-CANCER COMBINATIONS<br>
The present invention relates to synergistic combinations of the compound 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) and a compound selected from platinum compounds, vinca alkaloids, alkylating agents, anthracyclines, topoisomerase I inhibitors, antimetabolites and topoisomerase II inhibitors, which have anti-tumour activity. Preferably, the present invention relates to synergistic combinations of the compound 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) and a compound selected from carboplatin, gemcitabine, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin and irinotecan. More particularly, the invention is concerned with the use of such combinations in the treatment of cancer and pharmaceutical compositions containing such combinations.<br>
5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) is represented by the following formula:<br><br>
Phase I clinical trials of DMXAA have recently been completed, with dynamic MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) showing that it induces a significant reduction in tumour blood flow at well-tolerated doses. DMXAA is thus one of the first antivascular agents for which activity (irreversible inhibition of tumour blood flow) has been documented in human tumours. These findings are in agreement with preclinical studies using tumours or human tumour xenografts which showed that its antivascular activity produced prolonged inhibition of tumour blood flow leading to extensive regions of haemorrhagic necrosis. However, in such studies tumours rapidly regrow from surviving cells in the well-perfused periphery. The transient tumour growth inhibition seen in most preclinical models is consistent with the lack of tumour regressions seen in the phase I clinical studies, and suggests that DMXAA is unlikely to have clinical utility as a single agent.<br><br>
Carboplatin (Paraplatin®) is a platinum coordination cancer chemotherapeutic agent. The chemical name for carboplatin is platinum, diammine [1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato(2-)-0,0,]-,(SP-4-2).<br>
Cisplatin (Platinol ) is a platinum antineoplastic agent used to treat a variety of tumour types.<br>
Gemcitabine (Gemzar®) (HC1) is a nucleotide analogue antimetabolite that exhibits antitumour activity. Gemcitabine HC1 is 2,-deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine monohydrochloride (b-isomer).<br>
5-fluorouracil (Adrucil®) is an. injectable antineoplastic antimetabolite. Its chemical name is 5-fluoro-2,4(lH,3H)-p&gt;rimidinedione.<br>
Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®) is available as a lyophilised cake for injection or as tablets for oral use. Cyclophosphamide is a synthetic antineoplastic drug chemically related to the nitrogen mustards. The chemical name for cyclophosphamide is 2-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H-13,2-oxazaphosphorine-2-oxidemonohydrate,<br>
Doxorubicin HC1 (Adriamycin®) is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius.  It has the chemical name (8S,10S)-10-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-a-L-lyxo-hexop&gt;Tanosyl)oxy]-8-glycolyl-7)8,9?10-tetrahydro-6,83ll-trihydroxy-1 -methoxy-5,12-naphthacenedione hydrochloride.<br>
Vincristine (Oncovin®, Vincasar PFS®, Vincrex®) is a vinca alkaloid antineoplastic.<br>
Etoposide (VePesid®), (also commonly known as VP-16) is a topoisomerase II inhibitor.<br>
It is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin. It is 4,-demethylepipodophyllotoxin-<br>
9-[4,6-0-(R)-ethylidene-(beta)-D-glucopyranoside]. Etoposide is available for oral or<br>
1	intravenous administration.<br>
Irinotecan (Campto®, Camptosar®) is a topoisomerase I inhibitor. It is a semi-synthetic<br>
derivative of camptothecin. The chemical name is (5)-43ll-diethyl-3,4,12,14-tetrahydro-<br>
4-hydroxy-3 J 4-dioxo-lH-pyrano3,4,6,7,)-indolizionol(1,2-b)quinolion-9-yl-(1,4-<br>
;	bipiperidinej-l'-carboxylate, monohydrocloride, trihydrate.<br>

The present invention will now be illustrated, but is not intended to be limited, by means of the following examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1:<br>
Materials And Methods<br>
Compounds: A stock solution of DMXAA, synthesised in the Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre, was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline, protected from light and stored frozen. Cisplatin (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO) was dissolved in 0.9% saline. Stock solutions of carboplatin and 5-fluorouracil (Bristol Myers Squibb, Sermonita, Italy) and cyclophosphamide (Mead Johnson Oncology Products, Princeton, NJ) were diluted with sterile water. Doxorubicin (Farmitalia Carlo Erba Pty Ltd, Clayton North, Australia), etoposide, and vincristine (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Sermonita, Italy) were diluted using 0.9% saline. All compounds were administered to mice by i.p. injection at 0.01 ml/g body weight.<br>
Animals and Tumours: Murine mammary carcinoma MDAH-Mca-4 tumours were grown from stocks stored in liquid nitrogen at the sixth transplant generation. Tumours (eighth transplant generation when used) were grown from 20 fi\ of cell suspension (7 mg packed cells), inoculated i.m. (intra-muscular) in the right gastrocnemius muscle of female C3H/HeN mice (22-25 g at the time of treatment). Mice were randomised to treatment which commenced when the tumour + leg diameter reached 10-11 mm (0.5-0.7 g tumour).<br>
Host Toxicity and Antitumour Activity: Mice were treated with chemotherapeutic drugs<br>
at a range of doses, at 1.33-fold increments, up to the expected MTD (maximum<br>
tolerated dose, as estimated in pilot experiments or from the literature).   Toxicity was<br>
assessed as lethality, and body weight loss measured four days after treatment.   Any<br>
animals becoming moribund were terminated and treated as drug-related deaths in the<br>
analysis.  The diameter of the tumour-bearing leg was measured 3 times per week after<br>
treatment.  Antitumour activity was assessed from the tumour growth delay, defined as<br>
the difference in time to reach the endpoint of 13 mm (1.5 g tumour) for treated and ontrol groups. Responses were classed as cures if animals were free of evident tumour<br><br>
120 days after treatment. The statistical significance of tumour growth inhibition was tested by ANOVA using SAS for Windows, with Dunnett's test to evaluate /7-values for differences between treatment groups. In experiments with substantial numbers of cures (free of tumour for &gt; 120 days after treatment), statistical significance was tested by Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis of variance using SAS for Windows, and the difference between treatment and control groups by Dunn's test using Sigmastat v2.0. The gradient and standard error of dose-response curves was determined by linear regression using Sigmastat, and the DMF (Dose Modifying Factor) calculated as the gradient with DMXAA/gradient without DMXAA.<br>
Tumour blood flow inhibition: Tumour blood flow was assessed using the fluorescent perfusion marker Hoechst 33342 (8mg/ml in saline), which was administered i.v. at various times after drug treatment. Mice were scarified 2 min later, and frozen sections (14 μm) prepared from the distal, central and proximal regions of each tumour. Sections were examined with a Nikon epifluorescence microscope at lOx magnification using a UV-1A filter block (excitation 365 nm, barrier filter 400 nm, and dichroic mirror 400 nm). A grid with 81 squares (100 x 100 /μm), was used for point scoring of staining. The whole area of each section was scored to avoid bias between peripheral and central regions (which were less well perfused). Normal tissue was excluded but necrotic areas were included. Differences between groups were treated for significance using the Student's t-test (Sigma Stat, version-2.0; Jandel Scientific Limited).<br>
Pharmacokinetics: Female CaH/HeN mice bearing MDAH-Mca-4 tumours (0.5-0.7 g) were injected i.p. with carboplatin (316 μmol/kg), DMXAA (80 ^mol/kg)5 or simultaneously received carboplatin and DMXAA, at the same doses. At various times blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus of anaesthetised mice into heparinised tubes, and the plasma separated by centrifugation. Tumours were rapidly dissected and frozen at -80°C. Groups of 2-5 mice were used for each time point.<br>
ICP-MS (Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy) analysis of platinum: Concentrations of platinum in plasma and tumours were determined using the following previously published ICP-MS method. Tumours were weighted, placed in 15 ml screw cap tubes containing 1ml of 70% nitric acid (Riedel-de-Haen, Seelze, Germany), and left to stand overnight at room temperature. The following day, tumours were digested for 2 h at 90°C in a sand-filled electric frying pan positioned with a fume hood. After cooling, the solubilized tumour tissues were made to volume in 10-ml volumetric flasks using Milli-Q water and then introduced into the ICP-MS. Plasma was prepared for analysis by methanol precipitation of plasma protein.   Plasma was added to an equal<br><br>
volume of ice-cold methanol, mixed and left to stand at -20°C for 18 h. The sample was centrifiiged and an aliquot of supernatant was diluted (1:40) in 0.1% nitric acid before being introduced into the ICP-MS.<br>
The ICP-MS system comprised a Hewlett Packard HP 4500 ICP-MS with a nickel sampling cone, Babington (v-groove) nebulizer and a Scott double-pass spray chamber maintained at 2°C. Platinum was read at 195 amu with a dwell time of 100 ms and a replicate time of 6000 ms. Calibration curves were linear (r2&gt;0.98) over a wide range (0.5 to 5000 ng/ml). Intra-assay and inter-assay variability and recovery were within acceptable limits. The limits of quantitation were 12.5 pg of platinum per ml of plasma and 10 ng of platinum per g of tumour tissue.<br>
HPLC analysis of DMXAA: Concentrations of DMXAA in plasma were determined as follows. Aliquots of plasma (50 jttl) were treated with 1 ml of ice-cold acetonitrile:methanol (3:1 v/v), centrifuged, and the resulting supernatants evaporated using a Speed-Vac solvent concentrator (Savant Instruments, NY). The residues were dissolved in 200 /xl of 10 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5) and 25 \i\ was analysed by HPLC using a HP 1100 system with diode array detector (278 run) and fluorescence detector. The column used was a 3.2 mm x 150 mm C8 5 jttm column (Alltima Associates Inc., Deerfield, IL) and a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min, with a mobile phase of 16% acetonitrile (v/v) in 10 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5). The retention time for DMXAA was 7.3 min. Spiking of control plasma showed assay linearity from 0.1-100 (jM (r2 = 0.999). The intra- and inter- assay precision and accuracy gave coefficients of variation 
Pharmacokinetic Modelling: Modelling of pharmacokinetic data was done using ModelMaker version 4.0 (Cherwell Scientific Limited, The Magdalen Centre, Oxford Science Park, Oxford OX4 4GA, United Kingdom). The following pharmacokinetic parameters were used: Kabs, the first-order rate constant for absorption into the central compartment; CI, total body clearance; Climer, intercompartmental clearance; Vd, apparent volume of distribution of the central compartment; Vd2, apparent volume of distribution of the second compartment; Km, Michaelis-Menten constant; Vmax, theoretical maximum rate; AUC, area under the concentration-time curve. For all compounds it was assumed that all of the administered dose would reach the central compartment (i.e. 100% bioavailability). Differences between treatment groups were tested using a F-test comparing the entire curves and if this difference was significant (i.e. p
 <br>
tested using a 2-tailed t-test. The concentrations of free platinum and total platinum in plasma and tumour were flitted with a 1-compartment open model assuming linear pharmacokinetics. Plasma concentrations of DMXAA were fitted usins a 1-compartment open model with saturable (Michaelis-Menten) elimination kinetics.<br>
Results<br>
Activity of DMXAA + chemotherapy drugs against MDAH-Mca-4 tumour. The antitumour activity and host toxicity of DMXAA/cytotoxic drug combinations was assessed by varying the dose of chemotherapeutic drug up to the toxicity limit, with coadministration of a fixed DMXAA dose (80/xmol/kg, ca. 80% of MTD), and evaluating subsequent tumour growth delay, as illustrated in Fig 1. Of the seven drugs investigated, four (doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide and cisplatin) showed appreciable activity against this tumour as indicated by dose-response relationships providing significant slopes by linear regression, and highly significant growth delays of ca 10 days at their MTDs (which are recorded in Table 1). The other three compounds (carboplatin, etoposide and vincristine) were essentially inactive, with no individual treatment groups showing significant activity (although carboplatin gave weakly positive dose responses by linear regression).<br>
DMXAA alone showed appreciable activity as a single agent at 80 /zmol/kg, providing transient regressions and mean tumour growth delays in the range 3.5 - 8.3 days (overall mean 6.6 ± 0.6 days). Co-administration of DMXAA at this dose increased the host toxicity of doxorubicin and the MTD for the chemotherapy drug was lowered by one dose level (l:33-fold) in the combination (Table 1). For the other compounds, coadministration of DMXAA did not alter the formal MTD although some additional toxicity was evident as indicated by the greater body weight loss in the combination.<br>
In contrast to this small effect on host toxicity, co-administration of DMXAA produced a large enhancement of tumour growth delay (Table 1). The contribution of DMXAA was assessed by determining the slope of each dose-response curve by linear regression, and the DMF for DMXAA was calculated as the ratio of slopes with and without DMXAA. By this criterion the magnitude of the synergy decreased in the order vincristine &gt; (carboplatin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin) &gt; 5-fluorouracil. For each of these compounds, except the later, the DMF was significantly greater than unity. As an alternative criterion, the maximum tumour growth delay achievable at the MTD of the combination again indicated synergy for all the compounds with growth delays in the range 15-30 da vs.<br><br>
Pharmacokinetics of DMXAA and carboplatin: Studies were conducted to deduce whether a pharmacokinetic interaction underlies the synergistic therapeutic interaction between DMXAA and carboplatin. The study was conducted in C3H mice bearing MDAH-Mca-4 tumours of the same size as in the therapeutic studies. Following administration of carboplatin (316 /unoI/Kg, i.p.) clearance of Pt from plasma (measured, after deproteinization, by ICP-MS) was biphasic, and was unaffected by coadministration of DMXAA (Fig 2). Total Pt in the tumour also showed biphasic kinetics which were unaffected by co-administration of DMXAA. The lack of effect of DMXAA was confirmed by modelling the plasma with tumour pharmacokinetics as a 2-compartment open model with linear pharmacokinetics, which provided the model parameters of Table 2 and indicated that there is no significant effect of DMXAA.<br>
This.study tests the hypothesis that antivascular agents such as DMXAA have the potential to combine synergistically with conventional cytotoxic agents in the treatment of solid tumours. The early passage mammary tumour MDAH-Mca-4, used for this comparative study, was moderately refractory to most of the cytotoxic drugs tested (using single drug doses) but showed significant responses to doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide and cisplatin. DMXAA alone showed consistent activity as a single agent, of similar magnitude to these four agents, but neither the chemotherapy drugs nor DMXAA provided prolonged regressions or cures.<br>
However, co-administration of DMXAA with the cytotoxic drugs caused a marked increase in response (Fig. 1). This interaction can be classified as synergistic (super-additive) on the basis of the increased slope of the cytotoxic drug dose response curve on addition of DMXAA. The interaction, quantified as the DMF (ratio of the linear regression slopes with and without DMXAA), was significantly greater than unity for all drugs except 5-fluorouracil. It is noteworthy that the interaction with DMXAA resulted in substantial activity with several compounds which did not show any single agent activity.<br><br><br><br>

Example 2<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Human tumour xenografts (PSN1) were established by subcutaneous injection of 5xl06 cells in the right flank of female MF1 nude mice. PSN1 is a pancreatic carcinoma. Tumours were allowed to grow to a diameter of 6-8 mm before treatment (a volume of approximately 0.15 cm3). Treatment groups were randomised in such a way that the mean volume in each group on the day of treatment was not statistically different. Stock solutions of DMXAA and gemcitabine (Eli Lilly &amp; Company, Indiana) were diluted in saline and injected intravenously into tumour bearing nude mice via a lateral tail vein. For combination therapy, the two drugs were given by sequential injections into the two lateral tail veins. Control mice were untreated.<br><br>
Tumours were measured in three orthogonal dimensions two to three times per week and the volume expressed as the tumour volume relative to the volume on the day of treatment. Tumours were measured until they had at least tripled in volume. The end-point was the tumour volume tripling time.<br>
Results<br>
The Tables below show, in the column headed "Median", the median tumour volume' tripling times for PSN1 pancreatic tumour xenografts treated with gemcitabine with or without DMXAA. The column headed "Treated - Control" shows the treated minus control tripling time, i.e. the advantage of the drug or drug combination over untreated<br>
tumours.<br>
The gemcitabine data have been analysed as volume doubling times and tripling times. In both cases the combination of the two drugs is synergistic, the treated minus control for the combination being greater than the sum of each drug given alone.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
