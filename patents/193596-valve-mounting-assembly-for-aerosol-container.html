This invention generally relates to valve mounting assemblies for aerosol containers, said moiinting assemblies being commonly referred to as "mounting cups". More particularly, this invention relates to a particular tubular gasket (sleeve gasket) for the mounting cup, which varies dimensionally from prior sleeve gasketed mounting cups. Further, during a certain interval of the positioning of the sleeve gasket onto the mounting cup, the sleeve gasket varies in its spatial relationship with the mounting cup as compared to prior sleeve gaskets.<br>
Aerosol containers are widely used to package a variety of fluid materials, both liquid and powdered particulate products. Typically, the product and a propellajit are confined within the container, at above atmospheric pressure, and the product is releakised from the container by manually opening a dispensing valve to cause the pressure within the container to deliver the product through the valve and connecting conduits to a discharge orifice.<br>
The dispensing valve is normally mounted in a container opening via a mounting assembly that includes a mounting cup and sealing gasket. More particularly, the container includes a top opening or bead portion. The mounting cup includes a central pedestal portion for clinching the dispensing valve, a skirt portion extending from the pedestal portion, which skirt portion merges into a radially outwardly extending channel portion, the chaomel portion being configured to receive the rounded bead<br><br><br>
portion of the container opening. The sealing gasket normally extends along a part of the skirt portion and to a limited degree into the channel portion. After the sealing gasket is disposed onto the mounting cup, the cup is positioned onto the container and the cup is clinched to the container. The clinching operation is well-known to those skilled in the aerosol container art.<br>
Obviously, for an aerosol container, the seal between the mounting cup and the container bead is critical. This seal is accomplished through the sealing gasket, which must prevent the loss of pressure and loss of container contents through the interface between the container bead and mounting cup.<br>
Various types of sealing gaskets are known in the art. One common type of gasket comprises a conventional flat riibber gasket. that is placed inside the channel of the mounting cup. Gaskets of this type are typically manufactured by extruding and vulcanizing the compounded rubber mixture onto metal rods and then cutting or slicing off thin, annular sections of the extruded and vulcanized product (tvibe) . These gaskets are often referred to as cut or flat gaskets. Cut gaskets are relatively expensive to manufacture. It is very difficult to control precisely the radial dimensions of the tubes, from which the cut gaskets are made, the tubea having varying dimensions and being out of round. Consequently, the inner and outer cylindrical surfaces of these tubes are usually laser cut to the desired dimensions, said cutting adding considerable cost to the gasket man.ufacture.<br><br><br>
Another type of gasket coir5&gt;ri8es a relatively thin sleeve of elastomeric inaterial that is mounted on the skirt portion of the moxinting cup auad then advanced along said skirt so that the gasket extends ultimately into a limited portion of the annular channel of the mounting cup. When the moiinting cup is mounted and then clinched onto the aerosol container, the sealing gasket is forced into a sealing engagement with both the channel of the mounting cup and the bead of the container. Typically, these gaskets are forced into a sealing engagement with the mounting cup along only a relatively small circ\unferential portion of the gasket at positions referred to as the 5 o'clock and 11 o'clock positions. Due to their shape, gaskets of this type are often referred to as sleeve gaskets.<br>
Sleeve gaskets are manufactured by adveincing a tube of gasket material onto the skirt of the moxinting cup and then cutting or slicing off annular sections of the tube. The eucial heights of sleeve gaskets, however, are substantially greater than the axial heights of cut gasket. Sleeve gaskets are much less expensive to make and assemble to the mounting cup tham cut gaskets. When making sleeve gaskets, it is not necessary to mill the inside and outside cylindrical surfaces of the extruded txibes of gasket material. Moreover, a tiibular sleeve gasket may be assembled to the mounting cup more easily than assembling a cut gasket to the mounting cup.<br>
The sealing gasket may also be formed by a liquid material containing water or solvent that is deposited in the annular<br><br><br>
channel of the mounting cup. The solvent or water evaporates during curing amd the remaining material produces a resilient sealing material in the mounting cup channel. Forming the gasket from a liquid solvent also is a comparatively expensive procedure requiring multiple production steps including the use of curing ovens or other means to dry and cure the gasket material. Moreover, means must be provided for rotating the mounting cup beneath and relative to a metering apparatus that dispenses carefully determined amounts of a gasket forming composition. These gaskets are commonly referred to as "flowed-in" gaskets.<br>
Thus, the above described types of gaskets, as well as others that may be used, have both advantages and disadvantages. Both cut and sleeve gaskets generally produce excellent results. Cut gaskets have seen widespread commercial use for a longer period of time than sleeve gaskets. To use sleeve gaskets on equipment previously used with flat or cut gaskets reqpiires an adjustment in the crimping and filling tools. Often, a crimping line will be required to accommodate both flat and sleeve gaskets; depending on the gasket specifications of the valved container being crimped. To avoid having to make the crimping and filling change or adjustment, there has been a tendency, particularly in Europe, to stay with flat or cut gaskets, even though such gaskets are more costly.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to provide an improved gasketed movmting cup for aerosol containers amd an iaqproved method for assembling the gasket to the mounting cup.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a mounting cup for an aerosol container with a sealing gasket that has the cost advantages of a sleeve gasket but that allows the crimping and filling equipment to be used at the same settings for the clinching and filling of a cut gasket.<br>
A further object of this invention is to position a sleeve gasket on a mounting cup so that the gasket has dimensions equivalent to a flat or cut gasket without requiring any milling of the gasket material.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a novel sleeve gasket disposed on a substantial portion of the skirt of the mounting cup such that during the affixment of the mounting cup amd container, the sleeve gasket may be advanced into the channel portion of the mounting cup.<br>
These and other objectives are attained with a valve mounting assembly for an aerosol container con^rising a moiinting cup 2uid a relatively thick sleeve gasket of limited height positioned on the mounting cup.<br>
The sleeve gasket of this invention is positioned onto the skirt portion of the mounting cup and then ultimately advanced into the annular channel of the moxinting cup prior to clinching the mounting cup and container.  The advancing of the sleeve gasket of<br><br><br>
this invention prior to the clinching operation reeulta in a deformation of the gasket of about 90° to form a gasket comparable in shape and dimension to a conventional cut gasket. The sleeve gasket of this invention may be cut from an extruded txibe of gasket material, which can be cut to very precise longitudinal dimensions. When the sleeve gasket is turned about 90" into the channel of the mounting cup, the original axial dimension of the gasket becomes its radial dimension or thickness. In this way, a cut gasket shape can be achieved having precise inner and outer dimensions without ree[uiring the costly processing of the gasket material, as has been previously required with prior art cut gaskets.<br>
The sleeve gasket may be advanced onto the skirt of the mounting cup and then advanced into the annular channel thereof in one operation but preferably it is done in two separate steps. For instance, the sleeve gasket may be advanced onto the skirt of the mounting cup at one location and sold in this condition to a manufacturer of filled aerosol containers, who then advances and deforms the gasket into the desired shape in the annular channel of the mounting cup.<br>
Where the sleeve gasket is disposed on the skirt portion, or at least a sxibstauitial portion of the sleeve gasket is disposed on the skirt of the motmting cup amd transferred in this form to another location, there is the advantage that the friction fit between the skirt of the mounting cup amd the sleeve gasket is adequate to prevent dislodgement of the gasket from the mounting cup during transport and storaoe orior to th« riUnching of the<br><br><br>
gasketed mounting cup and the container, a problem often present in the transportation and storage of cut gaskets.<br>
Where, however, it is desired to dispose the sleeve gasket of this invention normal to the axial length of the skirt of the mounting cup, means or steps may be used to maintain or to hold the gs^ket in the deformed shape in the channel of the mounting cup. Any suitable means may be used to advance and deform the gasket into the desired shape in the mounting cup channel and to maintain the gasket in the channel. For example, the aerosol container itself may be used to do this as the mounting cup is disposed onto the filled container or adhesive may be used to bond the deformed gasket to the channel of the mounting cup.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a valve mounting assembly for an aerosol container comprising a) a mounting cup having a central pedestal portion to which is affixed the aerosol valve, a profile portion emerging radially downward and outward fi'om the pedestal, a skirt portion extending substantially vertically fix&gt;m the radially outward terminus of the profile portion and terminating in a flange portion for receiving the bead of a container, b) said skirt portion having an outside diameter slightly less than the inside diameter of the bead of the container to which the gasketed mounting cup is to be clinched: c) said mounting cup having a sleeve gasket disposed on the skirt portion of the mounting cup, the axial height and radial thickness of said sleeve gasket being of such dimension that insertiiig the so positioned sleeve gasket mounting cup into the container opening will  advance  the  sleeve  gasket into the channel portion of the<br><br><br>
mounting cup through the contact of tiie bead of the container and the sieeve gasket<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 illustratea a valve mounting aaaembly, generally shown at 10, positioned within the open end of a container 12 (partially shown). More specifically, assembly 10 includes mounting cup 14 and gasket 16, and the mounting cup, in turn, includes a central body 20 having a pedestal portion 19, a profile portion 21, and a skirt portion 22 terminating in a radially outwardly rolled flange 24 that forms annular gasket receiving channel 26. Container 12 includes upper portion 30 that forms central container opening 32 and an upper rolled rim or bead 34 that extends around opening 32. As shown in Figure 1, channel 2 6 of cup 14 is moiinted on and receives bead 34. Gasket 16 is disposed between bead 34 and the under surface of channel 26. The bead 34 directly supports the valve moxinting assembly 10.<br>
With reference to Figure 2, in order to connect assembly 10 permanently to container 12, a portion of the skirt 22 is forced outward, underneath bead 34, around the circumference of skirt 22, thereby clinching mounting assembly 10 to container 12. This clinching operation also forces gasket 16 into a tight pressure fit against both bead 34 and the under-surface of channel 26, thereby<br><br><br>
forming an effective seal therebetween.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, gasket 16 is formed from a sleeve shaped gasket that ie mounted on the skirt 22 of cup 14 and then by advancing the gasket into the channel portion of the mounting cup deformed 90° into a shape approximating that of a flat gasket. Figures 3 and 4 are an exploded view of mounting cup 14 and sleeve gasket 16.<br>
As previously mentioned/ mounting cup 14 includes a skirt 22 and a radially outwardly rolled flange 24 that forms channel 26. More specifically, skirt 22 of cylindrical body 20 is integral with and extends from the profile portion 21 and flange 24 extends integrally from the skirt 22. A pedestal portion 19 is centrally disposed within profile 21, and receives the manual valve (not shown) including a valve stem (not shown) that extends through aperture 44.<br>
Mounting cups of the type described above are well known in the art, and cup 14 may be made in any appropriate procedure and from any suitable material. For instamce, cup 14 may be made of metal such as steel, aluminum, and like and formed into the desired shape through a steunping process.<br>
With the above construction of mounting cup 14, it is important that a pressure resistant seal be formed between the cup 14 amd container 12, and more particularly, between the rolled rim on bead 34 of the container and the channel 26 formed by the rolled flange 24.  Gasket 16 is provided to form this seal.<br>
As shown in Figures 3 and 4, gasket 16 includes concentric<br><br><br>
inner ana outer cylindrical surfaces 16a and 16b and top and bottom edges 16c and 16d, end preferably, the gasket has a \mifona height and a uniform thickness. The height and thickness of the gasket 16 are shown in Figure 3 as the dimension "H" and "T", respectively. Gasket 16 thus has a sleeve shape, but is of less height and substantially thicker than conventional sleeve gaskets. Preferably, the height ("H") and thickness ("T") of gasket 16 are equal or equivalent to the radial thickness and height, respectively, of conventional flat or cut aerosol gaskets. Hence, for instance, the height of gasket 16 may be between 0.080 and 0.150 inches and the thickness of the gasket may be from 0.030 to 0.060 inches. As more specific examples, gasket 16 may have a preferable height of approximately 0.090 to 0.140 inches and most preferably from 0.100 to 0,130 inches, and a preferable thickness of approximately 0.035 to 0.055 inches and most preferably between 0.040 to 0.050 inches.<br>
In addition, the inside diameter 16a of gasket 16 preferably is substantially equal to or preferably slightly less than the outside diameter of the skirt 22 of mounting cup 14. As an example, the outside diameter of cylindrical body 20 will normally be approximately 0.96 inches, and thus the inner diameter of gasket 16 is substantially equal to or preferably slightly less than 0.96 inches. Gasket 16 may be made of any suitable material presently used for cut gaskets such as natural or synthetic rubbers, elastomers, polymers and mixtures thereof capable of deforming in the manner described below.<br><br><br>
To form gaskttt 16 into the deslrttd shape, the gaslcet may be moiinted on aklrt 22 of cylindrical body 20 of cup 14, as shown in Figure 5. Then, having reference to Figures 6 and 7, the gasket is advanced along the skirt 22 into the mounting cup channel 26. The advauice may be accomplished by advancing the gasketed moxmting cup of Figure 5 against the bead 34 of container 12 (shown in Figure 1), and specifically by contacting edgp 16g of the gasket with the container rim and urging the gasket into the channel 26 as the valve assembly is placed on the container rim for filling. Alternatively, a device such as shown in Fig. 11 may be employed.<br>
As gasket 16 is advamced along skirt 22, flange 24 forces and guides the lower portion of gasket 16 radially outward, away from skirt 22. Gasket 16 is advanced along skirt 22 vintil the gasket is deformed 90° into the shape approximating a flat gasket, as shown in Figure 7, in which the gasket has upper euid lower surfaces 16e and 16f and concentric inner and outer circular edges 16g, 16h. As gasket 16 is deformed into the position and shape shown in Figrure 7, the height of the gasket becomes its radial thickness between its inside and outside circumferential edges, and the original radial thickness of the gasket becomes its axial thickness or height. Hence, in the position and shape shown in Figure 7, gasket 16 has an outside di£uneter of about 0.100 to 0.130 inches and an axial thickness of about .030 to .060 inches.<br>
As shown in Figures 5 and 8, the sleeve gasket 16 is disposed to a sxibstantial extent on the skirt 22 of the mounting cup 14. There is an advantage in this placement of the sleeve gasket on the<br><br><br>
aountlng cup, namely that In transporting and storing the slssvs jasket in this form, the gasket is better retained on the cup :hrough the interference fit of sleeve gasket and skirt. With cut-basket mounting cups, it is not \inusual to have a bothersome degree &gt;f gaskets being dislodged from the cup prior to the ;ontainer/mo\inting cup clinching operation.<br>
Where the sleeve gasket is advanced on the mounting cup to the }Osition shown in Figures 7 and 10, means may be provided for oaintaining the gasket in the deformed shape within the chauinel 26. This means may either be pressure against the channel 26 by the :ontainer bead 34 during the filling operation, or as later iiscussed, by sealing the deformed gasket 16 to the channel 24 ihrough an adhesive, which is not shown.<br>
The present invention may be practiced with different types of lounting cups; and as a further example. Figures 8, 9, and 10, .llustrate gasket 16 and an alternate type of movinting cup 50 on /hich the sleeve gasket of this invention may be positioned, lounting cups 10 and 50 are very similar, and the two cups include ;orresponding parts. More specifically, mounting cup 50 includes L central body 52 having skirt 54 terminating in an outwardly rolled flange 56 that forms annular gasket receiving channel 58. 7he principal difference between cups 10 and 50 is that the channel i6 of the former cup has a relatively flat bottom surface, while :hannel 58 of cup 50 has a curved or rounded bottom surface.<br>
Gasket 16 may be positioned on motmting cup 50 in a manner lubstantially identical to the way in which the gasket may be<br><br><br>
positioned on mounting cup 10. In particular, tha gaakat may ba mounted on skirt 54 and then advanced, as viewed in Figures 9 and 10, into annular channel 58. Gasket 16 may be advanced by, for instance, the bead of container 34 or by a device such as shown in Figure 11. As the gasket is advanced, flange 56 forces and guides the lower portion of gasket 16 radially outward, away from skirt 54, until the gasket is deformed 90" into the shape approximating a flat gasket, as shown in Figure 10. The deformed gasket is maintained in this shape by either pressing the channel 58 and can rim 34 toward each other or by heat and/or adhesive meems.<br>
Figure 16A-E shows the bead 34 advamcing toward the gasket 16 and urging the gasket 16 along the inner surface 23 of the skirt 22 until the gasket 16 is in the position shown in Figure 16C. Further advancement of the bead 34 holds the gasket 16 against the inner surface 27 of the channel 26, as shown in Figure 16D. Subsequently, the skirt 22 of the mounting cup 14 is radially outwardly clinched by means well known in the art to create a metal to metal between the container bead 34 euad mounting cup 14 at the 4 o'clock and 10 o'clock positions. The components of Figure 16A have like parts in Figures 16B-E.<br>
After gasket 16 is deformed into the desired shape in the gasket channel of the movinting cup - for instance, as shown in Figures 7 and 10 - some meams or process is employed to maintain or hold the gasket in that position. For exaacqple, an adhesive or bonding agent may be applied to the gasket or to the surface of the mounting cup channel to adhere the gasket to the metal channel.<br><br><br>
Alternatively, the gasket may be heated to relax streaa that tenda to cause the gasket to return to Its original cylindrical shape. Any suitable adhesive or heating techniques may be used to hold the gasket in the desired shape and position.<br>
Gasket 16 may be advanced on the skirt of a moxinting cup and advanced into the annular channel thereof in one operation or in two separate steps. For instance, the gasket may be moved on the skirt of the mo\inting cup (as shown in Figures 5 and 8) at one location, and sold in this condition to a manufacturer of filled aerosol containers, who then advances the gasket into the aiuiular channel of the mounting cup during filling, as shown in Figures 7 and 10 by urging the gasketed moxinting cup of Figures 5 and 8 against the bead of the aerosol container.<br>
Alternatively, a specific apparatus may be used to deform gasket 16 from the sleeve shape shown in Figures 5 and 8 to the cut gasket shape shown in Figures 7 and 10, and Figure 11 is a schematic representation of one such apparatus 60. Generally, apparatus 60 includes a tubular guide bushing 62 forming a central through opening 64, and a tubular gasket engaging member 66 slidably disposed in opening 64 for upward and downward reciprocating movement therein. Member 66 includes an inside cylindrical surface 66a having a diameter equal to or slightly greater than the outside diameter of cup body 20.<br>
In the operation of apparatus 60, mounting cup 14 is held below member 66 in any appropriate manner, with the sliding member substantially coaxially aligned with cup body 20 and with gasket 16<br><br><br>
I<br>
applied on this mounting cup genarally In the poaitlon shown in Figures 5 and 11. With reference to Figures 11 and 12, member 66 is then slid downward, along the outside of cup body 20, and into engagement with the top edge of gasket 16. Member 66 is then slid further downward, forcing the gasket downward and outward along the bottom surface of channel 26, \intil tha gasket deforma into tha shape shown in Figure 7. Simultaneously, member 68 is slid downward along the inside of guide bushing 62 to contact tha top surface 16e at the same time as member 66. Pressure ia applied by members 66 and 68 to force the gasket against the mounting cup annular channel.<br>
Members 66 and 68 are then slid upward, off mounting cup 14, and mounting assembly 10 is then removed. Depending on the nature and size of the operation involved, apparatus 60 may be manually operated or automatically operated by appropriate means that, for the sake of simplicity, is not specifically illustrated. Also, as mentioned previously, after gasket 16 is deformed into the desired shape, a means or process may be used to maintain the gasket in that shape. This may be accomplished by heating the cup prior to pressing the gasket against the channel which will relax the stress present in the deformed gasket. Alternatively, or in conjunction with heating, adhesive applied to gasket surface 16f or to the surface of channel 26, or both, may be used to seal and hold the deformed gasket against the mounting cup channel until the valve ius sealed to the can rim.<br>
After gasket 16 is deformcui into the desired cut gasket shape<br><br><br>
and valve mounting assembly 10 is moved onto container 12, assembly 10 may be clinched to the container 12. When this is done, gasket 16 is compressed and tightly held between the clinched cup 14 and the curl 34 o£ the container, forming the desired, highly effective seal therebetween.<br>
Gasket 16 may be Initially mounted on cup body 20 by any suitable way, and this may be done either manually or by automated means. For example, the gasket may be cut from a tube of suitable gasket material and then placed on the cup body 20. Alternatively, gasket 16 may be formed on cup body 20 by means of the processes and apparatus of the type disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,546,525; 9,547,948; 4,559,198 and 5,213,231 in which a tube of the gasket material is mounted on the cup body, and then a portion of the tube is cut off, while on the cup body, to form the sleeve gasket on the mounting cup. The gasket is then pushed to the desired position on the mounting cup. The disclosures of the U.S. Patents listed in this paragraph are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Experimental results have shown that the performance of gaskets, constructed and employed in accordance with the present invention, are, generally, equivalent or superior to the performance of prior art gaskets. In particular, weight loss studies were conducted comparing the sleeve gasket of this invention with buna laid-in gasket and butyl rubber cut gasket in three different aerosol can sizes packed with three different formulatlons and stored upright at room tesserature and at 45°C. The weight loss from each can, after one month of storage, was<br><br>
measured and extrapolated to one year's storage. These measurements show that the present invention produces excellent results, equal to or better than those prior art gaskets. The experimental results are shown in the graphs set forth in Figures 13-15. The lines in the graphs represent the connection of a series of data points.<br>
Inspection of the data set forth in Figures 13 - 15 indicates the sleeve is equivalent or superior to the Buna rubber laid-in gasket and the Butyl rubber cut gasket of the prior art.<br>
The conversion of a sleeve type gasket, as initially mounted on the skirt of the mounting cup, to cut-type gasket after final positioning of the sleeve gasket into the channel portion of the mounting cup provides several Improvements over prior art cut gasket systems. The use of an extruded sleeve type gasket avoids the necessary milling operation when using the cast flat or cut gasket. The sleeve-type gasket is assembled to the mounting cup from a continuous tube of the gasket material at the site of the gasket/mounting cup assembly and is an assembly procedure that is significantly less costly than assembling the cut gasket to the mounting cup. Finally, by dimensioning the sleeve gasket of this invention as set forth herein, the aerosol container filler may interchange the type of gasket, i.e., cut or sleeve, without dimensional adjustment of the crimping or filling parmeters, thus effecting a cost benefit.<br>
While it is apparent that the invention herein disclosed is well calculated to fulfill the objects previously stated, it will<br><br><br>
be appreciated that numerous modifications and embodlments may be devised by those skilled In the art, and It is intended that the appended claims cover all such modifications and embodiments as fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
