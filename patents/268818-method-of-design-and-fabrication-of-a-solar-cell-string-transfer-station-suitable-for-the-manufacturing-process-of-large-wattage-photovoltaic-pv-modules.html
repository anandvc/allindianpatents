FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a Solar Cell String Transfer Device adaptable in the<br>
manufacturing systems of large wattage Photovoltaic (PV) modules, typically PV<br>
modules having at least 72-nos. of solar cells with power output in a range<br>
between 150 to 170 watts. The invention further relates to a method for<br>
automatic transfer and reversal of the PRBCF (Phenolic Resin Bonded Cotton<br>
Fabric) cell jig and the glass superstrate during manufacture of PV modules with<br>
power output of 150 to 170 watts and comprising at least 72 nos. of 125-mm<br>
crystalline silicon solar cells connected in series configuration.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Solar cells are manufactured using 125-mm or 156-mm size mono / multi<br>
crystalline silicon wafers. Typically, each 125-mm solar cell generates a power<br>
output of 2.2 to 2.3 watts. 36 os. of these cells are interconnected in series to<br>
get PV Modules of 75 to 85-watts power output (12-V application) and 72-nos. of<br>
cells are interconnected in series to get PV Modules of 150 to 170-watts power<br>
output (24-V application). The demand for larger wattage (150 to 170-watts)<br>
modules is increasing due to its reliability, cost-benefits, reduced<br>
interconnections and other hardware requirements in PV Power Plants.<br>
PV Module assembly process basically comprises the steps of Tabbing, Stringing,<br>
String Transfer, Lay-up, Lamination, Framing and Module Testing. The step of<br>
Stringing (interconnection) of the cells is carried out on a PRBCF Stringing Jig<br>
after which the Stringed Cells are transferred onto a glass superstrate with a<br><br>
3<br>
EVA(Ethylene Vinyl Acetate) sheet as an intermediate layer. In a semi-automated<br>
assembly lines, this String Transfer operation is carried out manually in a two-<br>
step process involving a first step of physical transfer of the strung cells and<br>
followed by a step of reversing the string so that the front of the Stringed Cell<br>
faces the glass superstrate. This string transfer operation using manual method<br>
is well adapted for the 75-Wp PV Modules (size : 1200-mm*525-mm, weight :<br>
7.5 Kg). However, due to large size and weight of the 150-Wp Modules (size:<br>
1590-mm x 785-mm, weight: 15-Kg), manual handling becomes very tedious for<br>
the operators and further increases the possibilities of module breakage. One of<br>
the solutions to ease this string transfer operation and to minimize the risk of<br>
module damages, could be the development of an automated solar string<br>
transfer equipment.<br>
Further, the commercially available equipment handles only a part of the string<br>
with 12-cells resulting in 6 operations for achieving the complete transfer.<br>
Besides, the interconnection is to be carried out after each of the transfer<br>
operation over the glass superstrate, which is cumbersome.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose an automated Solar Cell<br>
String Transfer device adaptable in the manufacturing systems of Photovoltaic<br>
modules with power output rating of 150 to 170 watts and comprising at least 72<br>
nos. of 125-mm crystalline silicon solar cells connected in series configuration.<br><br>

9<br>
Details of these features are described below.<br>
LOADING STATION (MOVING PLATFORM)<br>
As shown in figure 4, the strings of cells along with the stringing jig (9) (on<br>
which the cell strings are formed) are placed in the loading station (1). The<br>
loading station (1) is supported on a moving platform (2), which is moved both<br>
in forward and reverse direction by means of a conveyor-motor assembly (3,7),<br>
as shown in figure 7. The loading station (1) is designed for supporting either the<br>
stringing jig (9) or glass superstate or both and is provided with edge guides (8)<br>
to hold them firmly in place during the movement (Fig. 9).<br>
VACUUM STATION<br>
As shown in figure 6, the vacuum station (4) comprises a removable fixture (4b)<br>
with 72 vacuum suction cups (4a) positioned exactly to align with the 72 cells of<br>
a 150-Wp Module. The fixture (4b) is detachable by means of two sets of screws<br>
(not shown). Similar fixtures are designed for use in 100-Wp &amp; 120-Wp modules<br>
and attached in place of the existing one. This allows for flexibility and future up-<br>
gradation of the device of the invention. A line diagram of the vacuum station<br>
(4) is shown in figure 5.<br>
Compressed air is used in the vacuum generators (not shown) to generate<br>
vacuum and at least two such generators are used for achieving higher level of<br>
vacuum suction (4). The vacuum cups (4a) are further strengthened using 'O'<br>
rings (not shown) for effective sealing of air at these points. In addition, non-<br><br>
10<br>
return valves (not shown) are provided at these suction cups to provide further<br>
protection against leakage of one of the vacuum cups (4a) and thereby affecting<br>
the other vacuum cups as well. The vacuum station (4) is provided with at least<br>
one preumatic cylinder (10), and a slider (11).<br>
CONVEYOR SYSTEM<br>
As shown in figure 7, the conveyor mechanism (3,2,7) transports the Stringing<br>
Jig (9) and the glass superstate alternately between the loading station (1) and<br>
the vacuum station (4). This transportation is programmed to take place either<br>
automatically or under manual control. A line diagram of the conveyor system (3)<br>
is shown in figure 8, which further indicates the moving platform (2) fixed on the<br>
conveyor (3) at 'IN' and 'OUT' positions.<br>
The conveyor mechanism (3) is driven by servomotors (7) and is capable of<br>
handling the weight of the fixture (4b) or glass superstate (9) or both together.<br>
Limit switches are provided at the ends of the loading and vacuum station ends<br>
to sense the extreme points and if necessary, stop the motor (7) which drives<br>
the conveyor (3,2). As shown in fig - 9, the conveyor (3,2) carries the loading<br>
platform (12) on which the stringing jig (9) is loaded. The stringing jig is having<br>
a plurality of cavities (9a) to accommodate the vacuum suction cups (4a).<br>
ELECTRONIC CONTROLS<br>
The automated string transfer device of the invention is controlled by a<br>
Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) (6) housed in an enclosure at the bottom of<br><br>
11<br>
the device as shown in figure 11. The PLC-controller (6) provides all necessary<br>
interlocks during transportation, pick-up of the cells as well as during placement<br>
on the glass superstrate. It is interfaced to two sets of operator push-button<br>
controls (5), mounted on either side of the device for easy operator access from<br>
either side.<br>
The manual string transfer operation and automated string transfer operation<br>
(with the aid of the present invention) are illustrated in figure 12 and figure 13<br>
respectively. A flow chart showing the steps followed in the string transfer device<br>
with the PLC (6) is shown in figure 14.<br><br>
12<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
Major advantages of this equipment over the conventional equipment are as<br>
follows.<br>
The device of the present invention can handle a complete cell string consisting<br>
of 72-Cells in one operation whereas the conventional device can handle only<br>
part string with 12-Cells resulting in 6 operations for achieving the complete<br>
transfer<br>
In the inventive device, the entire string remains stationary and the glass<br>
superstate is moved under it for positioning. In case of conventional devices,<br>
the glass superstrate is kept stationary whereas the string is physically moved.<br>
This poses a potential threat to cause string damage in case of vacuum failure<br>
when the string or individual cell is likely to be released from suction.<br>
According to the method of present invention, the complete interconnection of<br>
the string is carried out on the jig itself and after transfer, it is ready for<br>
lamination; whereas, in case of conventional devices, the interconnection is to be<br>
carried out after the step of transfer operation over the glass superstrate is<br>
completed, which is very cumbersome and may also introduce impurities in the<br>
lamination.<br><br>
13<br>
BENEFITS ACHIEVED<br>
Installation of the device and implementing the method of the invention in the<br>
150-Wp PV Module assembly system gives the following benefits.<br>
Minimisation of damage to string / glass during string transfer operation<br>
Better string alignment<br>
Improved handling of modules during String Transfer operation &amp; reduction of<br>
operator fatigue<br>
The total cost of development of the Automated String Transfer Device is<br>
comparatively lower than the available devices.<br><br>
