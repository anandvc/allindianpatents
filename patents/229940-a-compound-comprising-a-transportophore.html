The present invention relates to compound wInch is is a non-antibiotic srapeutic agent comprising a transportophore.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Successful therapy with a pharmaceutical agent requires that the agent satisfy imerous requirements imposed by the physiology of the host and of Ine disease or ndition. The requirements include: (i) adequate ability to interact with the target ceptor(s); (u) appropriate physical properties for presence at the location of the ceptors in concentrations that permit the interactions noted above; (iii) appropriate tysical properties to allow the agent to enter the body and distribute to the location 'the receptors by any means; (iv) sufficient stability in fluids of the body; (v) the isence of toxic effects in compartments where the therapeutic agent is most incentrated, or in any other compartment where the therapeutic agent is located; and i) the absence of sequestration into non-physiological compartments and so on.<br>
In general, these compounding requirements limit the nature of pharmaceutical impounds that have utility in vivo and thus reduce the probability of discovering lequately active molecules from de novo starting points, In response to these instraints, significant effort has been applied to the question of predicting ideal tysical properties for pharmaceutical molecules. Authors such as Lipinski (Lipinski al., 2001) have described rules of therapeutic agent design wInch, amongst other irameters, predicts that ideal therapeutic agents will have few functions such as 'droxy groups, a molecular weight below 500 Da, mild basicity, and moderate lopInhcity (logP  500) such as e compounds disclosed here.<br><br>
Recently, improvements in the technology of synthetic chemistry and molecular biology have allowed the testing of large numbers of molecules and the discovery of many ligands with adequate affinity to their targets to have some potential in vivo. Many such molecules prove inadequate on in vivo testing largely due to the manifold, stringent, and often conflicting (i,e. stability without toxicity) requirements outlined above.<br>
In addition to the difficulties facing many new molecules, many existing molecules in clinical use also exInbit inadequate properties of uptake, distribution, stability and toxicity (Lipinski et al. 2001). These observations demonstrate, that in general, deficiencies in uptake, distribution, and stability result in inadequate therapy from existing molecules and inadequate and uneconomical probabilities of success in the discovery of new molecules.<br>
Such problems often fell witInn the scope of therapeutic agent delivery - a discipline wInch combines many aspects of formulation with techniques for introducing the agent into the host body. Delivery methods are frequently designed to permit passage through a single barrier (i.e. the skin) (WO 01A3957) ortfae intestine (WO 01/20331) after wInch the agent must again conform with the general requirements above in order to act at the in vivo target. Certain delivery strategies involve a physical preparation such as liposomes (Debs et a). 1990; Jaafari, Poldvari, 2002) or anti-body conjugates (Everts et ah, 2002) wInch further direct the molecules witInn the host body. Others rely on the addition of cationic lipids to formulations, the use of transport proteins as a route of uptake (WO 01/20331). The use of transport processes deliberately in therapeutic agent design is perhaps best illustrated by the nucleoside therapeutic agents, wInch to varying degrees, are taken up as metabolites and whose transport to mitochondria is a major cause of toxicity (WO 9S/29437) For example, see European Patent No. 0009944B1, European Patent No. 0044090A3, and Japanese Patent No. 05163293. Such methods may enhance perfbrmance in therapy or reduce toxicity but they increase cost and require direct introduction into the blood stream wInch is impractical in chronic use.<br>
More preferable would be small molecules that possess the appropriate structures and properties to mediate efficient uptake and stability. Such small molecules would ideally be able to carry a range of therapeutic agents of varying<br><br>
properties such that they could be commercialized in more than one indication. However, there is a requirement that they be inactive arid stable enough to ensure that the cargo molecule is carried in the periphery (Harada et al. 2000).<br>
Ths present invention represents a significant advance ID that it provides for 2 means of improving the bioavailability and efficacy of a variety of molecules in vtvo using a series of rational and facile assays to select desirable compounds based on known pharmacophores or pharmaceutical lead structures that have not been optimized for in vivo action.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention describes a method for identifying compounds that act .to improve the uptake of therapeutic agents into cells such as those that constitute the immune system in mammals. The invention further comprises compounds identified using the method and compounds that could be made based on the teacInng provided. The invention provides for the rational improvement of therapeutic agents intended for action in inflammatory disease, infection, cancer, allergy, transplantation, cardiovascular., pulmonary, dermatological, rheumatological and metabolic disease. The invention also provides for methods to engender unoptimized molecules or those with activity only in vitro with improved properties in vivo through simple conjugation with molecules that meet the criteria outlined herein.<br>
The method provides for the selection, in vitro, of combinations of a transportophore and a therapeutic agent that exInbits adequate concentrative uptakft and also scission with a half life adequate for agent accumulation and agent action. To identify such a combination, one can contact a sample of native mammalian blood cells (e.g., Innnan blood cell), wInch contain atleast erythrocytes, neutropInls, monocytes, and lymphocytes, with one or more transportophores and determining the relative concetitration of those transportophores in the immune cells (at least neutropInls, monocytes and lymphocytes) relative to the concentration of them in the erythrocytes. Then, one can select a transportophore with significantly enhanced concentration in the immune cells and. use the transportophore to covalently link to one or more therapeutic agents, via a bond or a linker, to obtain a compound of tIns invention. Such a compound, containing the transportophore and the therapeutic agent, is also concentrated in immune cells after it is incubated with blood cells. Finally, one can select a linker that provides appropriate cleavage rates between the transportophore and the therapeutic agent in the target cells.<br>
More Specifically, a method described in Example 1 acIneves an estimate of immune cell selective uptake in a complex and competitive biological fluid such that the observed uptake is relevant to the in vivo situation wInle simultaneously<br><br>
measuring cell specific uptake. Data from other Examples suggest that the molecules th&amp;t exInbit preferential uptake in tIns system are also Inghly available via the oi^l route wInle also being stable in the liver.<br>
A number of variations are possible in the application of the method. The basic method includes contacting the immune cell-erythrocyte preparation with a compound or known compounds and specifically detecting those molecules and their metabolites. A farther variation is the use of the method in screening complex mixtures of compounds with separation and detection of the resultant cytoplasmic extracts Using Mass selective detection combined with a chromatograpInc separation technique.<br>
In a further variation, the compounds designated as transportophores are used in the synthesis of libraries such that the final reaction combines library elements with a transportophore using a labile bond allowing the preferential uptake of a compound and its likely scission in an intracellular compartment. Such libraries have the advantage that in cell based assays, there is a reasonable likelihood of adequate therapeutic agent being present at the site of action.<br>
The compound described in the "Summary" section can be prepared by methods known in the art, as well as by the synthetic routes disclosed herein. For example, one can react a transportophore having a reactive moiety with a therapeutic agent haviDg another reactive moiety. One of the two reactive moieties is a leaving group (e.g., -CI, OR) and the other is a derivatizable group (e.g., -OH, or-NH-)-Then, the transportophore is covalently bonded to the therapeutic agent via a reaction between the two reactive moieties, In the case when a linker is present, each of the two reactive moieties, independently, is a leaving group or a derivatizable group, and each reacts with its reactive counterpart in the linker to form a covalant bond. Detailed routes including various intermediates are illustrated in the examples herein.<br>
The chemicals used in the afore-mentioned methods may include, for exsmplei solvents, reagents, catalysts, protecting group and deprotecting group reagents and the lite. The methods described above may also additionally comprise steps, either before or after the steps described specifically herein, to add or remove suitable protecting groups in order to ultimalery allow synthesis of the compound of the formulae described herein.<br><br>
As can be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the synthetic routes herein are not intended to comprise a comprehensive list of all means by wInch the compounds described and claimed in tIns application may be synthesized. Further methods will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, the various synthetic steps described above may be performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the desired compounds. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing the compounds described herein are known in the art and include, for example, those such as described in R. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers (19S9); T.W. Greene and P.G.M Wuts, Proteaive Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2d. Ed.. John Wiley and Sons (1991); L. Fieser and M.

Benefits of the invention:<br>
The conjugates described here represent improvements on their parent therapeutic agents in two main respects. First, these conjugates provide a facile means of improving the activity of a therapeutic agent through their ability to make the therapeutic agent more easily available either from the gut, or from the blood stream. TIns is especially important for those therapeutic agents mat have good activity in vitro but are unable to exert that activity in vivo. Where the non-mamfestarion of activity is related to inefficient uptake and distribution, simple conjugations according to the schemes described here are an efficient means to generate improved activity.<br>
The invention also has specific benefits. By targeting cells, and acIneving Ingher concentration in those cells than in plasma or general tissue, the therapeutic agent may exert a more specific action resulting in fewer systemic side effects. Where efficacy is limited by the ability to place sufficient therapeutic agent at the site of action, such concentration effects, are significant in acIneving improved in vitro effect. TIns may be understood more clearly by examination of non-limiting but representative examples from different therapeutic areas.<br>
In Examples 10-16, improved anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents are described in wInch the active moleculs are concentrated into immune cells in vitro through conjugation with a macrolide. These conjugates display superior immune suppressive and anti-inflammatory action in vivo when compared with the effect of a mixture of the two component molecules in the same system. The mechanism for tIns action is unknown hut the effect in protection appears to be qualitatively similar for<br><br>
the mixture and the conjugate suggesting that the conjugate is largely a delivery mechanism for the therapeutic agent. One potential non-exclusive explanation is that immune cells produce Ingh levels of aracIndonate, the substrate of cyclooxygenase enzymes, resulting in competition between tIns substance and NSAII) therapeutic agents for sites on cyclo-oxygenase enyzymes (substrate competition is known in the art as a common means of reducing the efficiency of an inInbitor). Enhanced concentration of the therapeutic agent has the potential to overcome tIns feedback inInbition resulting in a greater inInbition of flux through the enzyme. The conjugate also has other potential benefits including the prevention of metabolism through steric effects, increased residence time and traffic to sites of raflamniation when it is taken up Into target cells wInch are tropic for the inflamed tissues. Some action of the conjugate itself cannot be ruled out when it is present at Ingh concentrations in a cell.<br>
In example 24, an anti-viral therapeutic agent conjugate is cited that also acIneves Ingher levels in immune cells wInch may act as a reservoir of integrated viral material. If therapeutic agent is selectively conjugated such mat it is concentrated in these cells, it has two potential benefits including, the ability to suppress viral replication at lower systemic doses, and the ability to prevent resistance through the maintenance of persistently Ingher concentrations of therapeutic agent such that mutations with minor effect cannot accumulate.-<br>
Similar themes but contrasting mechanisms apply to the field of graft rejection where one focus of therapy is the prevention of T-cell responses to the donor organ. Various mechanisms are known but all would benefit if a greater proportion of chemical effect were focused on the T-cells themselves such that the systemic dose were reduced. Example 21. cites conjugates ofmycophenolic acid that are Inghly concentrated m immune cells. These conjugates are also Inghly bioavailable in the rat and cleave slowly to release jnycophenolie acid. Despite slow cleavage, the compounds have very similar anti-proliferative activity in vitro when compared with unconjugated mycophenolic acid suggesting that concentration can compensate for slow hydrolysis such that the conjugate becomes an intracellular reserve for the slow release of mycophenolate.<br>
Similar advantages can be cited for cancer where those neoplasms are of a type that takes up the conjugates to the same extent seen in immune cells. Cancers of<br><br>
myeloid origin are a good example of a target neoplasm. In such cancers, concentration of the therapeutic agent has potential to compensate for common resistance mechanisms such as gene amplification and the over expression of efflux systems. In certain cancers, the tumour is associated with an intense local inflammation. The inflammatory infiltrate may serve as a means of further concentration of the conjugate drugs in the environs of the tumour.<br>
In cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, it is commonly known that there is a strong inflammatory component to the events wInch result in the tInckening and fragmentation of the plaque. TIns inflammation may be effectively reduced by the application of a range of agents including conjugates of compounds that are anti¬inflammatory in effect.<br>
Data to support these observations may be found in various examples and is summarized here by reference in a non-limiting manner.<br>

Uptake of compounds<br>
Freshly drawn heparinised blood or buffy coat preparations are used for the determination of immune cell partition ratios. Buffy coat preparations are preferred. These may be obtained from donor blood by simple centrifugation of whole blood (4795 % for 10 minutes). Following centrifugation, plasma is collected from the surface, after wInch immune cells are expressed from the donor bags along with the erythrocytes lying immediately below the leukocyte layer. TIns ensures Ingh yields and a sufficient population of erythrocytes for partition. 5 ml of the resulting cell suspension are dispensed into T25 culture flasks. Substrates are added to a final concentration between 1 and 10 uM and fhe suspensions incubated at 37°C, in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For analysis of uptake kinetics, samples are withdrawn at 0,2,5,10, 30, 60,90, ISO, or 240 min after substrate addition. For screening purposes, samples arc taken at 0 and 120 minutes.<br>

Separation of blood cell fractions - density gradient centrifugation<br>
Cell fractions were prepared using density gradient centrifugation. Mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear cells are separated from erythrocytes essentially by layering the cell suspension on a viscous medium typically composed of a solution containing Ficoll or similar (commercial suppliers include; Lymphoprep, Axis SIneld, 1031966; Lymphoflot HLA, B24010; or PMN Separation Medium Robbins Scientific 106S-00-0). The layered suspension is then centrifuged at 600 g» 20 min, after wInch the cell fractions and the plasma (incubation medium) fraction are removed by gentle aspiration, washed twice in PBS buffer, followed by estimation of the cell number and pellet volume.<br><br>
Analysis<br>
Uptake of fluorescent compounds is monitored using fluorescence microscopy. Excitation and emission wavelengths depend of the fluorescence label in use. A typical label is a methoxy coumarin for wInch the appropriate wavelengths are 360 and 450 nm respectively. Fluorescent analogs of the compounds under study permit the estimation of appropriate uptake intervals as well as the likely intracellular distribution of the compounds. Fluorescent analogs also allow the estimation of losses in wasInng or other cell manipulations.<br>
Cell preparations are lyscd in water and the debris sedimented at 16100 g, 10 min. The supernatant is recovered and sub-sampled for protein and DNA content Protein in the supernatant is precipitated by bringing the solution to 100 % v/v ethanol and centrifugmg again at 16100 g, 10 min.<br>
Compound uptake is normalized according to cytoplasmic volume of calk in order to obtain the average concentration in the cells. Cell volume is estimated by correlation of DNA, protein or haem content of Jysed cell aliquots to cell number and packed volume prior to lysis.<br>
Cell lysates are analysed using a HP 1100 HPLC System (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) with a Kromasil 3.5u CI8, 50 x 2.0 mm column nd guard cartridge system (both, Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) nm at 0DC. A gradient elution was performed using water, 0.05% foiroic acid (A) and cetonjtrile 0.05% formic acid (B) (0 min. 5% B, 2.5 min 5% B, 2.8 min 40% B, 10.5 lin 85% B, 12.0 min 95% B, 16.5 min 95% B) at a flow rate of 300 uVmin. Re-quilibration of column was at 5% B, at a flow rate of 750 ul/min for 2.4 min. The DPLC-eluate from retention rime 0.0 min to 2.5 min was directed directly to waste. &gt;etection was via a UV cell at 214 nm followed by a 1/6 split to an An APT-qTOF 1 Micromass, Manchester, UK) mass spectrometer, (calibrated daily using a mixture of laL Rbl and CsT). The mass spectrometer is routinely operated in the positive lectrospray ionization mode using the following settings: Capillary voltage 4000 V; uone voltage 30 V; EF Lens offiet 0.38 V; source block temperature S0°C; desolvation gas temperature 140°C; desolvation gas 240 Vh; LM/ HM Resolution 0.0; Collision energy 4.0 V; Ion energy 5.0 V.<br><br>
Masses are monitored according to the known or expected M/Z ratios. Ion currents across the expected range of masses (including metabolites) are recorded and the chrom&amp;tograms for specific masses used to estimate the peak area for a given molecular ion (area proportional to concentration over a given range). Normalisation to DNA and/or protein and/or baem content of cells (all three measured with standard methods (Bisbenzimide staining (Sigma), BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and haem absorbance at 535 ran, respectively)) to cell number (hemocytometercount) and cell volume is employed to calculate average compound concentration in the cell fraction (expressed in uM). Formation of metabolites or hydrolysis products was also monitored for each T-L-C conjugate and the rate of hydrolysis estimated from both the total uptake and the loss of metabolites to the medium. The final ratio is computed by comparing the concentration of a component in the immune cell compartment 'with that in both the erythrocytes and the plasma. The PISK, is then the concentration in immune cells/concentration in erythrocytes using the same concentration units. Thus a PISR of 2 indicates a two-fold concentration relative to erythrocytes.<br>
Selection and definition of carrier compounds<br>
Immune cell selectivity assays provide data in the form of micrographs of fluorescent analogs and quantitative estimates of compound concentration. Micrographs are useful in detennining the intracellular disposition of compounds (FIG 1). It is apparent from the illustratians that compound distribution is generally uniform with some examples appearing granular or nuclear. The analysis of fluorescent libraries by tIns method provides an efficient means of selecting T molecules that are capable of mediating the transport of diverse substances into a cell. Examples of molecules assayed in tIns way are summarized in Table 2 along with their uptake data and selectivity. These data show ifcat similar molecules with similar properties can exInbit quite different uptake into immune cells, hence the difficulty m employing general specifications known in the art (Lrpinski et al., 2001) Further, it is clear from the images obtained during the course of uptake (FIG 1, FIG 2, or FIG 3) that for some structures, the process is a slow one relative to pure lipopInlic diffuaion. TIns is indicative of processes in uptake that depend on factors other than diffusion<br><br>
alone. Certain investigators have proposed that compounds of the macrolide type are subject to active, protein mediated concentrative mechanisms although these remain unknown (Labro, 1998)^ The data presented here for compounds 4 and 5 suggest that uptake is rapid but that it varies with each structure wInch floes not exclude a concentrative mechanism involving protein action.<br>
Compounds exInbiting Ingh uptake are outlined in Table 2 along with similar structures mat do not. It is clear from an inspection of the structures that there exist a variety of chemical and physical properties compatible with selective entry into wInte blood cells. These data are consistent with there being a multiplicity of mechanisms for cell entry and accumulation including passive entry and active uptake. These data further suggest mat compounds with properties supposedly compatible with facile uptake into actively metabolizing cells such as immune cells do not exInbit such properties. Simple addition of basic functions is not always effective, even in in vitro screening. In contract, addition of sugars, amino acids, or peptides can enhance entry of fluorescent compounds. Based on both the micrographs above and analysis of immune cells following uptake, it is clear that macrolide structures are very effective at mediating the entry of fluorescent molecules into cells and that other basic compounds did not exInbit tIns property. In sum, it is clear that an empirical method is the only reliable means of selecting and guiding synthetic chemistry toward compounds that are well distributed and concentrated in immune cells.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Biological Methods<br>
EXAMPLE 32: PROLIFERATION ASSAY<br>
Assay to determine the w vitro rate of, for example, lymphocyte proliferation. Lymphocytes are purified out of ant coagulated (CPDA, citrate or heparin) mammalian blood using the Lymphoprep™ system (supplier). Purified cells are counted using a hemocytometer following Trypan Blue staining, arid a cell concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml established in RPMi 1640 medium with 10% FCS and antibiotics as required (all from Biochrome). Following the addition of a cell proliferation stimulant, for example phytohemagglutanin (Sigma) at, for example an end concentration of 5 ug/ml fhe cells are incubated with different concentrations of the to be investigated compound in 100 fd end volume in a 96-well microtiter plate in an incubator (37°C, 5% CQ2, 95% humidity) for 72h- Cell proliferation is quantified following BrdU incorporation for 16 h by ELISA and subsequent colorimetric development (Cell Proliferation ELISA BrdU (colorimetric) kit from Roche Diagnostics). The ICso (uM) values arc then calculated, and used to compare compound efficacy.<br>
To determine the influence of the T-L-C modification on in vitro cellular drug uptake and pharmacology, the above assay is additionally modified and an additional "wash" step included. In addition to running the assay for 72h with the compounds to be tested, the assay is also run for just 2h, then compound is washed away in three serial washing steps using 200 fU of medium at each step, and the cells subsequently incubated For a further 70h. The determined IC50 (uM) values following 2h and ?2h incubation are compared and a ratio calculated (2b: 72b). The lower the number, the better thft uptake and drug release from the T-L-C in the cells (see results in Table 4 for examples), and improvement overmycophenolic acid.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 33: CELL-BASED IMDPH ASSAY WITH GUANOSIKE RESCUE<br>
Cytotoxicity assay<br>
HeLa cells (DSMZ, ACC 57) and lurkat cells'(DSMZ, ACC 232) in exponential growth phase are exposed for 3 days to test compounds. The number of surviving cells is then determined by theAlamar Blue assay (Serotec inc.). This assay incorporates a fluorometric growth indicator based on detection of metabolic activity. Specifically, the system incorporates an oxidation-reduction indicator that fluoresces in response to chemical reduction of the growth medium resulting from cell growth. As cells grow in culture, innate metabolic activity results in a chemical reduction of the immediate surrounding environment Continued growth maintains a reduced environment while inhibition of growth maintains an oxidized environment Reduction from growth causes the Redox indicator to change from an oxidized to a reduced form. Fluorescence is monitored at 560 nm (Exc.) and 590 nm Em.<br>
General procedure:<br>
HeLa cells (1 xl 03) or JURKAT cells (1 xlO3) are plated in 100 ul MEM medium (with Earle's salt; Biochrom KG) containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutaminE, and non-essential animo acids in 96-well plates and incubated at 37°C and 5% C02 atmosphere. After 24 hours, the test compounds are added over a concentration range and the cells incubated for a further 48 hours. Alamar Blue reagent (20 ul) is added to each well, and the cultures incubated for a further 4 to 6 hours. The fluorescence is then measured as described above and the LD^o is determined based on ajngmoidal dose response regression. In order to determine the toxicity of T-L-C conjugates of mycophenolic acid not due to the inhibition of IMPDH, excess-guanosine is added into the culture medium to a final concentration of 50 uM. Any toxicity still detected can then be ascribed either to other biological effects of the of T-L-C conjugate of mycophenolic acid, or is due to the very high intracellular concentration of mycophenolic acid, following concentrative uptake into the cell.<br>
Cytotoxicity assay with fresh PBMMCs<br>
The cytotoxicity of T-L-C conjugates of mycophenolic acid can be demonstrated directly on freshly isolated mammalian PBMNCs. The cells are<br><br>
prepared as described in Example 29, and the level of cytotoxicity determined by the Alamar Blue assay, as described above. As described for both HeLa and JURKAT cells, guanosine can also be used here to ameliorate the effect of mycophenolic acid on the activity of IMPDH.<br>
Results:<br>
L<br>
The toxicity of mycophenolic acid conjugates may be assessed most conveniently in a cell based system, preferably with a rapidly growing cell line such as HeLa or JURKAT. hi normal culture conditions, mycophenolic acid has an IC50 of less than 2 uM, and its effect can be completely removed in the presence of 50 nM guanosine. For many of the T-L-C conjugates of mycophenolic atid, alleviation with guanosine is possible, but this is not always complete, which could for example be due to either to other biological effects of the of T-L-C conjugate of mycophenolic acid, or is due to the very high intracellular concentration of mycophenolic acid, following concentrative uptake into the cell.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 36: Testing of antibiotic activity of drugs<br>
Assay summary<br>
The TC50 or MIC procedure for antibiotic sensitivity testing involves an antibiotic dilution assay, which can be performed in microtitre plates. A series of twofold dilutions of each antibiotic are made in the wells, and then all wells are inoculated with a standard amount of the same test organism. After incubation, growth in the presence of the various antibiotics is observed by measuring turbidity. Antibiotic sensitivity is expressed as the concentration of the antibiotic that inhibits 50% of the growlii (TCs&gt;). Alternatively it could be expressed as the highest dilution of antibiotic that completly inhibits growth (MIC).<br>
