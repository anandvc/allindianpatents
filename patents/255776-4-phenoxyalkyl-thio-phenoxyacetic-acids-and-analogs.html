4-((PHENOXYALKYL)THIO)-PHENOXYACETIC ACIDS AND ANALOGS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This Application claims priority to United States Provisional Patent Application No. 60/609, 967, filed September 15, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention features 4-((phenoxyalkyl)thio)-phenoxyacetic acids and analogs, compositions containing them, and methods of using them.<br>
Background<br>
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are metabolic sensors regulating the expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid homeostasis. Agonists of the PPARa subtype, such as LOPID(r) (gemfibrozil) and TRICOR(r) (fenofibrate), and agonists of the PPAR#g subtype, such as AVANDIA(r) (rosiglitazone maleate), are used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and diabetes, respectively. Another member of this nuclear receptor family, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR delta or PPAR5) is also a necessary transcription factor reported to be involved in regulating genes involved in lipid metabolism and energy expenditure. PPAR delta has been shown to act as a "gateway" receptor modulating the expression of the other PPARs (Shi et al., 2002, Proc Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 99(5): 2613-2618). Each receptor subtype has a distinct tissue distribution: 1) PPARa shows the highest expression in liver, 2) PPAR#g appears primarily in adipose tissue, and 3) PPAR5 has the widest distribution - ubiquitously in adult rat (Braissant et al., 1996, Endocrinology 137(1): 354-366) and in all the human tissues tested to date,<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/031969	PCT/US2005/032938<br>
including liver, kidney, abdominal adipose and skeletal muscle (Auboeuf et al., 1997, Diabetes 46(8):1319-1327).<br>
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha or PPAR#a) is a necessary transcription factor regulating genes relating to fatty acid metabolism and insulin action. The genes regulated by PPAR alpha include enzymes involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, the liver fatty acid transport protein, and apo A1, an important component of high density lipoproteins (HDL). Selective, high affinity PPAR alpha agonists increase hepatic fatty acid oxidation, which in turn decreases circulating triglycerides and free fatty acids.<br>
Examples of known PPAR alpha agonists variously useful for hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or atherosclerosis include fibrates such as fenofibrate (Fournier), gemfibrozil (Parke-Davis/Pfizer, Mylan, Watson), clofibrate (Wyeth-Ayerst, Novopharm), bezafibrate, and ciprofibrate and ureidofibrates such as GW 7647, GW 9578, and GW 9820 (GlaxoSmithKline).<br>
Diabetes is a disease caused, or contributed to, by multiple factors and characterized by hyperglycemia which may be associated with increased and premature mortality due to an increased risk for microvascular and macrovascular diseases such as nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, atherosclerosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hypertension, ischemia, stroke, and heart disease. Type I diabetes (IDDM) results from genetic deficiency of insulin, the hormone regulating glucose metabolism. Type II diabetes is known as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and is due to a profound resistance to insulin regulatory effect on glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, i.e., muscle, liver and adipose tissue. This insulin resistance or reduced insulin sensitivity results in insufficient insulin activation of glucose uptake, oxidation and storage in muscle and inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue as well as glucose production and secretion in liver. Many Type II diabetics are also obese, and<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/031969	PCTAJS2005/032938<br>
obesity is believed to cause and/or exacerbate many health and social problems such as coronary heart disease, stroke, obstructive sleep apnoea, gout, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, reduced fertility, and impaired psychosocial function.<br>
A class of compounds, thiazolidinediones (glitazones), have been suggested to be capable of ameliorating many symptoms of NIDDM by binding to the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) family of receptors. They increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of NIDDM resulting in correction of the elevated plasma levels of glucose, triglycerides and nonesterified free fatty acids without any occurrence of hypoglycemia. However, undesirable effects have occurred in animal and/or human studies including cardiac hypertrophy, hemadilution and liver toxicity.<br>
Many PPAR#g agonists currently in development have a thiazolidinedione ring as a common structural element. PPAR#g agonists have been demonstrated to be extremely useful for the treatment of NIDDM and other disorders involving insulin resistance. Troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone have been approved for treatment of Type II diabetes in the United States. There is also some indication that .benzimidazole-containing thiazolidinedione derivatives may be used to treat irritable bowel disorder (IBD), inflammation, and cataracts (JP 10195057).<br>
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevalent in the world and is often associated with other disease states such as diabetes and obesity. Many population studies have attempted to identify the risk factors for CVD; of these, high plasma levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high plasma levels of triglycerides (&gt;200 mg/dl), and low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are considered to be among the most important. Currently, there are few therapies targeting low HDL-C and triglycerides.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/031969	PCT/US2005/032938<br>
Recently, potent ligands for PPAR5 have been published, providing a better understanding of its function in lipid metabolism. The main effect of these compounds in db/db mice (Leibowitz et al., 2000, FEBS Lett. 473(3):333-336) and obese rhesus monkeys (Oliver et al., 2001, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98(9):5306-5311) was an increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and a decrease in triglycerides, with little effect on glucose (although insulin levels were decreased in monkeys). HDL-C removes cholesterol from peripheral cells through a process called reverse cholesterol transport. The first and rate-limiting step, a transfer of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to the apolipoprotein A-l component of HDL, is mediated by the ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) (Lawn etal., 1999, J. Clin. Investigation 104(8): R25-R31). PPAR8 activation has been shown to increase HDL-C level through transcriptional regulation of ABCA1 (Oliveretal., 2001, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98(9): 5306-5311). Through induction of ABCA1 mRNA expression in macrophages, PPAR#d agonists may increase HDL-C levels in patients and remove excess cholesterol from lipid-laden macrophages, thereby inhibiting the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Existing therapy for hypercholesterolemia includes the statin drugs, which decrease LDL-C but show little effect on HDL-C, and the fibrates, the PPAR#a agonists that have low potency and induce only modest HDL-C elevation. In addition, like the fibrates, PPAR8 agonists may also reduce triglycerides, an additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Elevated free fatty acid level has been shown to contribute to insulin resistance and progression of diabetes (Boden, G. PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS (1999 May-Jun), 111(3), 241-8).<br>
Examples of known PPAR delta agonists variously useful for hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or atherosclerosis include L-165041 (Leibowitz et al., 2000) and GW501516 (Oliver et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (2001), 98(9), 5306-5311). Treatment<br>

Additional features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the detailed discussion, examples, and claims below.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
The invention features compositions containing compounds of Formula (I) in the above Summary section, and methods of using them.<br>
Preferred compounds of the invention are PPAR delta agonists that have at least one and preferably two or three of the following characteristics when administered to patients with hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, low-HDL-C, obesity, diabetes and/or Metabolic X Syndrome: 1) increasing HDL-C level, 2) lowering triglycerides, 3) lowering free fatty acids, and 4) decreasing insulin levels. Improvement in HDL-C and triglyceride levels is beneficial for cardiovascular health. In addition, decreased level of triglycerides and free fatty acids contributes to reduce obesity and ameliorate or prevent diabetes.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention are dual PPAR compounds; in other words, they are both PPAR delta agonists and PPAR alpha agonists, preferably where the compound's EC50 potency relating to PPAR delta is less than 0.2 µM and the potency relating to PPAR alpha is less than 3 µM. For example, more preferred dual PPAR alpha-delta agonists are those compounds having an EC50 potency relating to PPAR delta that is less than 0.03 µM and where the potency relating to PPAR alpha is less than 1 µM.<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/031969	PCT/US2005/032938<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention are pan-PPAR agonists, namely, compounds having PPAR alpha, PPAR delta, and PPAR gamma agonist activity, preferably where the EC50 potency for PPAR delta is less than 0.2 µM; the potency for PPAR alpha is less than 3 µM; and the potency for PPAR gamma is less than 1 µM. More preferred pan-PPAR agonists have an EC50 potency for PPAR delta that is less than 0.03 µM; a potency for PPAR alpha that is less than 1 µM; and a potency for PPAR gamma that is less than 0.7 µM.<br>
PPAR delta, being ubiquitously expressed, can act as a gateway receptor that regulates the expression/activity of other nuclear receptors such as other PPARs. For instance, PPAR delta has been shown to block PPAR#g-mediated adipogenesis and acyl-CoA oxidase expression; it has also been shown to be associated with the nuclear receptor corepressors SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors), SHARP (SMART and histone deacetylase-associated repressor protein), and HDACs (histone deacetylase). Thus, conditions directly mediated by these nuclear receptors, such as obesity and Type II diabetes, can be indirectly mediated by PPAR delta (See, for example, Shi et al., 2002, Proc Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 99(5): 2613-2618).<br>
Some aspects of the invention relate to treating hypertriglyceridemia, raising levels of HDL, lowering levels of LDL, and/or lowering total cholesterol. Preferably, the methods of treatment are associated with improvements in the extent, duration, or degree of side effects, such as edema, normally associated with other existing therapies.<br>

WO 2006/031969	PCT/US2005/032938<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, heteroaryl and heterocyclyl may have a valence connecting it to the rest of the molecule through a carbon atom, such as 3-furyl or 2-imidazolyl, or through a heteroatom, such as N-piperidyl or 1-pyrazolyl. Preferably a monocyclic heterocyclyl has between 5 and 7 ring atoms, or between 5 and 6 ring atoms; there may be between 1 and 5 heteroatoms or heteroatom moieties in the ring, and preferably between 1 and 3, or between 1 and 2 heteroatoms or heteroatom moieties.<br>
Heterocyclyl and heteroaryl also include fused, e.g., bicyclic, rings, such as those optionally fused with an optionally substituted carbocyclic or heterocyclic five- or six-membered aromatic ring. For example, "heteroaryl" includes an optionally substituted six-membered heteroaromatic ring containing 1,2 or 3 nitrogen atoms fused with an optionally substituted five- or six-membered carbocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic ring. Said heterocyclic five-or six-membered aromatic ring fused with the said five- or six-membered aromatic ring may contain 1, 2 or 3 nitrogen atoms where it is a six-membered ring, or 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur where it is a five-membered ring.<br>
It is intended that the definition of any substituent or variable at a particular location in a molecule be independent of its definitions elsewhere in that molecule. It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds of this invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art as well as those methods set forth herein.<br>
Where chemical moieties are combined, such as in ethoxymethyl or phenylethyl, the term is described in the direction from the periphery to the connection point of the rest of the molecule. For example, ethoxymethyl is CH3CH2OCH2- and phenylethyl is a phenyl group linked by -CH2CH2- to the rest<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/031969	PCT/US2005/032938<br>
of the molecule (and not a phenyl group linked to the molecule with a CH3CH2 group as a substituent on the phenyl.) Where parentheses are used, they indicate a peripheral substitution.<br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>

In accordance with Scheme A, wherein Ri, R2, R5 and R6 are as described above (except that R5 and R6 do not form spiro C3-6 cycloalkyl or spiro 5- or 6-membered heterocyclyl), phenol A1, a variety of which are commercially available (such as 3-methylphenol, 2-ethylphenol, 2-propylphenol, 2,3-dimethylphenol, 2-chlorophenol, 2,3-dichlorophenol, 2-bromophenol, and 2-aminophenol), is alkylated to form phenoxyacetic acid ethyl ester A2 with a suitable haloacetic acid ester such as bromoacetic acid ethyl ester or 2-bromo-2-methylpropionic acid ethyl ester, in the presence of an appropriate base such as CS2CO3, K2CO3, or NaH, in a suitable solvent such as CH3CN or THF. Sulfonation of the phenoxyacetic acid ethyl ester A2 with an appropriate sulfonating agent, such as chlorosulfonic acid, occurs selectively at the para position to provide 4-chlorosulfonylphenoxyacetic acid ethyl ester A3. Transformation of the sulfonylchloride A3 to benzenethiol A4 is accomplished using a metal as a reducing agent, such as tin or zinc, in an acidic medium such as ethanol or dioxane.<br>

Phenoxyacetic acid ethyl ester B-D is obtained in two steps: (1) conversion of the alcohol B-C to mesylate under standard conditions by employing methanesulfonyl chloride and triethylamine in an appropriate solvent such as CH2CI2, and (2) alkylation of benzenethiol B-D, prepared according to Scheme A above, with the mesylate intermediate using a suitable base such as CS2CO3, K2CO3, or NaH, in an appropriate solvent such as CH3CN or THF, under nitrogen. Under standard saponification conditions phenoxyacetic acid ethyl ester B-D is converted to acid B-E under nitrogen.

Phenoxyacetic acid ethyl ester C-E is obtained by alkylation of benzenethiol A-D, prepared according to Scheme A above, with the mesylate C-D using a suitable base such as Cs2CO3, K2CO3, or NaH in an appropriate solvent such as CH3CN or THF under nitrogen.

In accordance with Scheme D, wherein R8' and R9' are independently selected from H and C1-6alkyl, aldehyde D-B could be prepared in two steps by methylation of acid D-A using (trimethysilyl)diazomethane as a methylating agent followed by reduction of the methyl ester intermediate with a suitable reducing agent such as diisobutylaluminum hydride. Aldehyde D-B is transformed to epoxide D-C by reacting with dimethylsulfonium methylide, which is generated in-situ from treatment of trimethylsulfonium iodide with a strong base such as DMSO anion. Epoxide ring opening of D-C with benzenethiol A-D in the presence of a catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium fluoride furnishes alcohol D-D, which is oxidized to ketone D-E under mild oxidation conditions by using acetic anhydride and dimethyl sulfoxide. Several types of olefination of ketone D-E may be carried out to provide alkene D-F. For example, Wittig reaction and olefination of D-E with Tebbe reagent will all give D-F. Finally, saponification of ethyl ester D-F under standard conditions gives acid Ib.<br>

Scheme E shows another route to prepare acid E-E as demonstrated in Scheme B. In Scheme E, epoxide E-B is obtained by treatment of phenol B-A with an appropriate base such as cesium carbonate followed by atkylation with 2-chloromethyl-oxirane E-A. Epoxide ring opening of E-B with benzenethiol A-D, prepared in Scheme A above, in the presence of a catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium fluoride furnishes alcohol E-C, which is oxidized to ketone E-D under mild oxidation conditions by using acetic anhydride and dimethyl sulfoxide. Several types of olefination of ketone E-D may be carried out to provide alkene B-D. For example, Wittig reaction and olefination of E-D with Tebbe reagent will all give B-D.

Such additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment. Acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I, due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding base form, are more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or<br>
