[Title  of  the   Invention]   MOTORCYCLE<br>
[Technical  Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a motorcycle, and more particularly to a fuel sensor of the motorcycle.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
As a conventional motorcycle, there has been known a motorcycle which includes a fuel tank formed into a downwardly recessed shape in the transverse cross section and a fuel sensor which is mounted on a bottom portion of the fuel tank. Here, the fuel sensor includes a sensor body portion, a sensor resistor portion which is directly mounted on the sensor body portion, a sensor arm which is rotatably mounted on the sensor resistor portion, and a float which is mounted on a distal end portion of the sensor arm (for example, see patent document 1) .<br>
[0003]<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A-2007-276746<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems that the Invention is to Solve]<br>
[0004]<br>
In the motorcycle disclosed in the above-mentioned patent document 1, the sensor arm extends in an elongated manner<br><br>
toward a front side of the vehicle which is a position where a liquid surface level of fuel is detected and hence, a weight of the sensor arm is increased thus necessitating a large float. Further, since a deflection quantity of the sensor arm is increased, it is necessary to increase a clearance between an inner wall of the fuel tank and the float for preventing the float from interfering with the inner wall of the fuel tank due to vibrations or the like. Accordingly, the degree of freedom in forming a shape of the fuel tank and the degree of freedom in designing a layout of the fuel sensor have been restricted. [0005]<br>
The present invention has been made to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks and it is an object of the present invention to provide a motorcycle which can realize the miniaturization of a float by decreasing a length of a sensor arm which constitutes a rotary portion and, further, can enhance the degree of freedom in forming a shape of a fuel tank and the degree of freedom in designing a layout of a fuel sensor. [Means for Solving the Problems] [0006]<br>
To achieve the above-mentioned objects, the invention described in claim 1 is characterized in that, in a motorcycle which includes a fuel tank which is configured to store fuel therein and a fuel sensor which detects a liquid-surface level<br><br>
of fuel in the fuel tank, the fuel sensor includes a sensor body portion which is mounted on the fuel tank, an arm portion which extends from an upper end portion of the sensor body portion outwardly in the vehicle-width direction, a sensor resistor portion which is mounted on an outer end portion of the arm portion in the vehicle-width direction, a sensor arm which is rotatably mounted on the sensor resistor portion with a swing angle thereof detectable by the sensor resistor portion, and a float which is mounted on a distal end portion of the sensor arm, and the sensor body portion and the sensor resistor portion are arranged to overlap with each other as viewed in a side view of a vehicle. [0007]<br>
The invention described in claim 2 is characterized in that,  in addition to the constitution of the invention described in claim 1, rigidity of the arm portion is set higher than rigidity of the sensor arm. [0008]<br>
The invention described in claim 3 is characterized in that, in addition to the constitution of the invention described in claim 1 or claim 2, the fuel sensor further includes a cable for transmitting a signal detected by the sensor resistor portion, and the cable is spirally wound around the arm portion. [Advantage of the Invention]<br><br>
[0009]<br>
According to the motorcycle described in claim 1, the fuel sensor includes the sensor body portion which is mounted on the fuel tank, the arm portion which extends from the upper end portion of the sensor . body portion outwardly in the vehicle-width direction, the sensor resistor portion which is mounted on the outer end portion of the arm portion in the vehicle-width direction, the sensor arm which is rotatably mounted on the sensor resistor portion with a swing angle thereof detectable by the sensor resistor portion, and the float which is mounted on the distal end portion of the sensor arm, and the sensor body portion and the sensor resistor portion are arranged to overlap with each other as viewed in a side view of a vehicle. Due to such constitution, a length of the sensor arm which constitutes a rotary portion can be decreased thus enabling the miniaturization of the float. Further, by decreasing the length of the sensor arm, a deflection quantity of the sensor arm can be decreased and hence, it is possible to decrease a clearance between an inner wall of the fuel tank and the float. Accordingly, the degree of freedom in forming a shape of the fuel tank and the degree of freedom in designing a layout of the fuel sensor can be enhanced. Further, a length of the fuel sensor in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle can be decreased and hence, the degree of freedom in designing the layout of the fuel sensor can be further enhanced.  Further,<br><br>
the decrease of the length of the fuel tank in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and the flattening of the fuel tank can be realized. Still further, it is possible to adjust a mounting angle of the sensor resistor portion using the arm portion and hence, it is unnecessary to change an angle of a sensor portion per se of the sensor resistor portion thus enhancing the general-purpose property which allows the use of the fuel sensor in different types of motorcycles. [0010]<br>
According to the motorcycle described in claim 2, the rigidity of the arm portion is set higher than the rigidity of the sensor arm and hence, it is possible to further decrease a deflection quantity of the sensor arm. Accordingly, the clearance between the inner wall of the fuel tank and the float can be further decreased so that the degree of freedom in forming a shape of the fuel tank and the degree of freedom in designing a layout of the fuel sensor can be further enhanced. [0011]<br>
According to the motorcycle described in claim 3, the fuel sensor includes the cable for transmitting a signal detected by the sensor resistor portion, and the cable is spirally wound around the arm portion and hence, it is unnecessary to additionally provide a member for holding the cable thus reducing the number of parts and reducing a manufacturing cost.<br><br>

Further, the bottom plate 42 is arranged above the main frame 12, and includes a center bottom plate 44 which extends in the frontward and upward direction and side bottom plates 45 which are respectively arranged on both sides of the main frame 12 and extend in the frontward and downward direction. [0017]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the fuel sensor 50 includes a sensor body portion 51 which is mounted on the fuel tank 50, an arm portion 52 which extends from an upper end portion of the sensor body portion 51 outwardly in the vehicle-width direction, a sensor resistor portion 53 which is mounted on an outer end portion of the arm portion 52 in the vehicle-width<br><br>
direction, a sensor arm 54 which is rotatably mounted on the sensor resistor portion 53 with a swing angle thereof detectable by the sensor resistor portion 53, a float 55 which is mounted on a distal end portion of the sensor arm 54, and a cable 56 which transmits a signal detected by the sensor resistor portion 53. [0018]<br>

portion 53 are arranged to overlap with each other as viewed in a side view of the vehicle. Due to such constitution, it is possible to decrease a length of the sensor arm 54 which constitutes a rotary portion thus enabling the miniaturization of the float 55. Further, by decreasing the length of the sensor arm 54, a deflection quantity of the sensor arm 54 can be decreased and hence, it is possible to decrease the clearance between the inner wall of the fuel tank 40 and the float 55. Accordingly, the degree of freedom in forming the shape of the fuel tank 40 and the degree of freedom in designing the layout of the fuel sensor 50 can be enhanced. Further, the length of the fuel sensor 50 in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle can be decreased and hence, the degree of freedom in designing the layout of the fuel sensor 50 can be further enhanced. Further, the decrease of the length of the fuel tank 40 in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and the flattening of the fuel tank 40 can be realized. Still further, it is possible to adjust amounting angle of the sensor resistor portion 53 using the arm portion 52. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to change an angle of a sensor portion per se of the sensor resistor portion 53 thus enhancing the general-purpose property general-purpose property which allows the use of the fuel sensor in different types of motorcycles. [0023]<br><br>
Further, according to the motorcycle 10 of this embodiment, the rigidity of the arm portion 52 is set higher than the rigidity of the sensor arm 54 and hence, it is possible to further decrease the deflection quantity of the sensor arm 54. Due to such constitution, the clearance between the inner wall of the fuel tank 40 and the float 55 can be further decreased so that the degree of freedom in forming the shape of the fuel tank 40 and the degree of freedom in designing the layout of the fuel sensor 50 can be further enhanced. [0024]<br>
Further, according to the motorcycle 10 of this embodiment, the fuel sensor 50 includes the cable 56 for transmitting the signal detectedby the sensor resistor portion 53, and the cable 56 is spirally wound around the arm portion 52 and hence, it is unnecessary to additionally provide a member for holding the cable 56 thus reducing the number of parts and reducing the manufacturing cost.
