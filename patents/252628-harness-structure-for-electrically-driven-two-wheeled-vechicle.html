[Name of Document] Specification [Title of the Invention]<br>
Harness Structure for Electrically-driven Two-wheeled Vehicle [Technical Field] [C001]<br>
The present invention relates to a harness structure for an electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
Various harness structures have been proposed for electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicles in which a motor-driving device receives source power from a battery, processes it according to the control signal instruction from a control unit, and outputs the processed source power as driving power to a motor for driving it, thereby allowing the vehicle to travel.  (Refer to, e.g., patent documents 1 and 2.) [0003]<br>
[Patent Document 1]<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2002-264664<br>
[Patent Document 2]<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 11-255168<br><br>
Patent document 1 discloses the following example. A scooter type two-wheeled vehicle has a battery at a position below its step portion and a power unit swingably supported by a body frame, and the power unit is provided with a motor. A motor-driving device is disposed between the battery and the motor, that is, the battery, the motor-driving device and the motor are arranged from the front to the rear in the order of the reduced amounts of heat generation, whereby the effect of heat is minimized. [0005]<br>
Incidentally, since a motor-driving device generally has a heat generating element such as an FET mounted thereon, if a driving control system is incorporated together with the motor-driving device, the driving control system is sometimes affected by heat.<br>
To address the thermal effect, patent document 2 discloses a control unit that is provided separately from a heat-generating motor-driving device so as to give a controllable instruction to the motor-driving device. [0006]<br>
As with the case of patent document 1, the electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle in patent document 2 has a battery disposed below a foot rest<br><br>
portion and a power unit provided with a motor. However, a power module (motor-driving device) is disposed in the power unit and the control circuit part (control unit) of the power module is spaced from the battery so as to be disposed rearward of and above the battery.<br>
[0007]<br>
Accordingly, the power module of the power unit is wired with a source power line extending from the battery disposed below the front foot rest portion and a control signal line extending from the front control circuit, namely, with the harnesses of both systems.<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0008]<br>
Since the source power line described above is a high voltage harness and the control signal line described above is a low-voltage harness, the high voltage harness and low voltage harness are inevitably wired in proximity to each other. This poses a problem of reducing the effect such as noise of the high voltage harness on the low-voltage harness.<br>
In addition, since the control signal line extending from the control circuit part to the power module is long, it is not easy to handle the low-voltage<br><br>
harness. [00C9]<br>
In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the invention to provide a harness structure of an electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle in which the effect such as noise caused by high voltage harness wiring is reduced and the handling of the harness is facilitated.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem and Effect] [0010]<br>
In order to achieve the above object, the invention recited in claim 1 provides an electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle in which a motor driving device receives source power from a battery, processes the source power in accordance with a control signal instruction from a control unit, and outputs the processed source power to a motor for driving, whereby the motor allows the two-wheeled vehicle to travel, and a harness structure of the vehicle is such that the battery and the control unit are disposed opposite to each other with respect to the motor driving device, a high voltage harness connecting the battery and the motor driving device is wired from the motor driving device to a side where the battery is disposed, and a low voltage harness used for transmitting<br><br>
a control signal between the control unit and the motor driving device is wired from the motor driving device to a side where the control unit is disposed. [0011]<br>
The invention recited in claim 2 is characterized in that, in the harness structure of an electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle according to claim 1, the battery is disposed forward of the motor driving device and the high voltage harness is wired from the motor driving device toward the front, and the control unit is disposed rearward of the motor driving device and the low voltage harness is wired from the motor driving device toward the rear. [0012]<br>
The invention recited in claim 3 is characterized in that, in the harness structure of an electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle according to claim 1 or 2, a storage box for storing articles is below a seat, and the motor driving device and the control unit are disposed on the peripheries of the storage box. [0013]<br>
The invention recited in claim 4 is characterized in that, in the harness structure of an electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle according to claim 3, the<br><br>
motor driving device is disposed on a left or right surface of the storage box, and the control unit is disposed on the rear surface of the storage box. [0014]<br>
The invention recited in claim 5 is characterized in that, in the harness structure of an electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle according to claim 4, the control unit is slantly attached to the rear surface of the storage box, and the low voltage harness is wired to a space defined between the rear surface of the storage box and the control unit. [0015]<br>
The invention recited in claim 6 is characterized in that, in the harness structure of an electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle according to claim 3, 4 or 5, the motor is provided in a power unit which is supported by a body frame in such a manner as to be swingable around a pivot, and a motor power line carrying driving power from the motor driving device is wired in such a manner as to go around the front of the pivot and reach the motor. [0016]<br>
The invention recited in claim 7 is characterized in that, in the harness structure of an electrically-<br><br>
driven two-wheeled vehicle according to claim 1, the high voltage harness and a high voltage connection portion connected to the high voltage harness are disposed opposite to the low voltage harness and a low voltage connection portion connected to the low voltage harness with respect to the motor driving device. [0017]<br>
The invention recited in claim 8 is characterized in that, in the harness structure of an electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle according to claim 1, a motor power line connecting the motor and the motor driving device is disposed on the same side as the high voltage harness with respect to the motor driving device. [Effects of the Invention] [0018]<br>
According to the harness structure of the electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle recited in claim 1, the high voltage harness and the low-voltage harness are wired on sides opposite to each other from the motor driving device toward the battery and the control unit, respectively, which are disposed opposite to each other. Therefore, the high voltage harness has a less effect such as noise on the low-voltage harness, the high voltage harness and the low-voltage harness can be<br><br>
handled with ease and all these wiring can be reduced in<br>
length.<br>
[0019]<br>
According to the harness structure of the electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle recited in claim<br>
2,	the high voltage harness is wired forward from the<br>
motor driving device, the low-voltage harness is wired<br>
rearward from the same, and both the harnesses are wired<br>
substantially linearly. Therefore, the handling of the<br>
harnesses is further facilitated.<br>
[0020]<br>
According to the harness structure of the electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle recited in claim<br>
3,	since the unoccupied space on the peripheries of the<br>
storage box below the seat is used to disposed the motor<br>
driving device and the control unit, space usability can<br>
be enhanced./<br>
[0021]<br>
According to the harness structure of the electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle recited in claim<br>
4,	since the motor driving device is disposed on a left<br>
or right surface of the storage box, and the control unit<br>
is disposed on the rear surface of the storage box, the<br>
motor driving device is disposed near the storage box so<br><br>
that the wire of the low-voltage harness can be reduced in length, and the control unit is hidden behind the storage box so that it is less affected by the heat of the motor driving device. [0022]<br>
According to the harness structure of the electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle recited in claim<br>
5,	since the control unit is slantly attached to the rear<br>
surface of the storage box, and the low voltage harness<br>
is wired by using the space defined between the rear<br>
surface of the storage box and the control unit, the<br>
unoccupied space can be used effectively.<br>
[0023]<br>
According to the harness structure of the electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle recited in claim<br>
6,	the motor is provided in the power unit which is<br>
supported by the body frame in such a manner as to be<br>
swingable around a pivot, and the high voltage harness<br>
carrying driving power from the motor driving device is<br>
wired in such a manner as to go around the front of the<br>
pivot and reach the motor.  Therefore, the swing of the<br>
power unit relative to the vehicle body has little effect<br>
on the high voltage harness carrying driving power.<br><br>
According to the harness structure of the electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle recited in claim<br>
7,	the high voltage harness and the high voltage<br>
connection portion connected to the high voltage harness<br>
are disposed opposite to the low voltage harness and the<br>
low voltage connection portion connected to the low<br>
voltage harness with respect to the motor driving device.<br>
Therefore, the high voltage side components are surely<br>
separated from the low-voltage side components so that<br>
the electrical effect established between both the side<br>
components can be further suppressed.<br>
[0025]<br>
According to the harness structure of the electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle recited in claim<br>
8,	the motor power line which carries a high voltage<br>
current and connects the motor and the motor driving<br>
device is disposed on the same side as the high voltage<br>
harness with respect to the motor driving device.<br>
Therefore, it is preferred that the interference between<br>
the high voltage side components and the low-voltage side<br>
components can be reduced.<br>
[Mode for Carrying out the Invention] [0026]<br>
One embodiment of the present invention will be<br><br>
hereinafter described with reference to Figs. I through 7.<br>
An electrically-driven vehicle according to the present embodiment is a hybrid, scooter type electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle 1 that mounts an internal combustion engine thereon.  Fig. 1 is a left-hand lateral view of the scooter type electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle with a cover depicted with an imaginary line (chain double-dashed line).  Fig. 2 is a right-hand lateral view of the same and Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the same with the cover removed. [0027]<br>
A body frame 2 of the scooter type electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle 1 includes a front frame 4, a pair of intermediate frames 5 and a pair of left and right aluminum die cast rear frame 6. The front frame 4 extends from a head pipe 3 rearward of the body and obliquely downward. The front frame 4 bifurcates at its lower end laterally to form the pair of intermediate frames 5, which further bends rearward and extends almost-horizontally. The pair of rear frames 6 is joined at its front ends to a cross member 5a, of the intermediate frames 5,  joined to the rear ends of the intermediate frames 6 and then extends rearward and obliquely downward.<br><br>
A handlebar 7 is joumaled by the head pipe 3. A front fork 8 integral with the handlebar 7 extends downward of the head pipe 3 and rotatably supports a front wheel 9 at its lower end. [0029]<br>
A pivot shaft 12 is spanned between the respective front halves of the rear frames 6 in such a manner as to extend in a laterally horizontal direction.  The pivot shaft 12 journals a mount bracket that projects to a position in front of, above the power unit 15. The mount bracket supports the power unit 15 with its rear portion being swingable up and down. A rear cushion 14 is interposed between the rear portion of the power unit 15 and the rear portion of the rear frame 6. [0030]<br>
The power unit 15 is of a unit swing type in which an internal combustion engine 16, a power transmission apparatus (continuously variable transmission 31) and a rear wheel 13 are composed integrally with one another and the rear portion of the power unit is swingable up and down as described above. The configuration of the power unit 15 will be briefly described with reference to Fig. 6.<br><br>
The internal combustion engine 16 has a cylinder block 18 joined to a crankcase 17.  The cylinder block 18 includes a cylinder 18a formed to be inclined forwardly. A cylinder head 19 is fastened to the front surface of the cylinder block 18.<br>
The crankcase 17 journals a crankshaft 2 0 to which a piston 22 is connected through a connecting rod 21. The piston 22 slidably reciprocates within the cylinder 18a so as to define a combustion chamber 23 between the top surface of the piston 22 and the cylinder head 19.<br>
[0032]<br>
The cylinder head 19 is provided with valves (not shown) adapted to control intake of a mixture to the combustion chamber 23 and exhaust therefrom, and an ignition plug 24.  In addition, the cylinder head 19 journals a camshaft 25 driven to open and close the valves. A cam chain 26 is spanned between a sprocket 25a fitted to the camshaft 25 and a sprocket 20a fitted to the crankshaft 2 0 so that rotation of the crankshaft 2 0 may be transmitted to the camshaft 25 through the cam chain 26.<br>
[0033]<br>
A starter motor 27 is placed at the vehicle-<br><br>
widthwise right-hand portion of the crankshaft 20 and a starting clutch 28 and a drive pulley 32 of the continuously variable transmission 31 is placed at the vehicle-widthwise left-hand portion thereof.<br>
Incidentally, the starter motor 27 also serves as a generator, which converts the rotary power of the crankshaft 2 0 to electric energy during operation of the internal combustion engine 16.<br>
A transmission case 29 is joined at its front portion to the left-hand part of the crankcase 17 and extends rearward. The left-hand opening of the transmission case 29 is covered with a transmission cover 30. [0034]<br>
A driven shaft 3 5 is rotatably supported laterally horizontally and disposed at a position rearward of the crankshaft 20 and between the long transmission case 29 and transmission cover 3 0 which extend in the back and forth direction of the vehicle. The continuously variable transmission 31 is configured such that an endless V-belt 34 is spanned between the driving pulley 3 2 and a driven pulley 33 rotatably carried on the driven shaft 35. [0035]<br>
A one-way clutch 36 is interposed between the<br><br>
driven pulley 33 and the driven shaft 35. An outer clutch integral with the driven shaft 35 of the one-way clutch constitutes an inner rotor 41 of a traveling motor 40.<br>
The traveling motor 40 includes an outer stator 42 which is disposed on the periphery of magnets 41a of the inner rotor 41 and is supported by the transmission cover 30. [0036]<br>
The one-way clutch 3 6 has a clutch inner 3 6a integrally joined to one of two sheaves of the driven pulley 33.  A large number of rollers 36c as a clutch element are disposed between the clutch inner 36a and a clutch outer 36b.  The rollers 36c transmits the normal rotation of the driven pulley 33 from the clutch inner 36a to the clutch outer 36b (driven shaft 35), but not reversely, that is, it does not transmit the normal rotation of the clutch outer 36b (driven shaft 35) to the clutch inner 3 6a. [0037]<br>
A reduction gear mechanism 45 is disposed along the right-hand rear surface of the transmission case 29 and is shield with a gear cover 44.  Power is transmitted from the driven shaft 3 5 through the reduction gear mechanism 45 to the rear wheel 13.<br><br>
More specifically, the driven shaft 3 5 passing through the transmission case 2 9 rightward, an intermediate shaft 46 and a rear shaft 47 supporting the rear wheel 13 are disposed parallel to one another. A first pair of reduction gears 35a, 46a is placed between the driven shaft 35 and the intermediate shaft 46. A second pair of reduction gears 46b, 47b is disposed between the intermediate shaft 46 and the rear shaft 47. Rotation of the driven shaft 3 5 is reduced in speed at a given reduction ratio and is transmitted to the rear wheel 13. [0038]<br>
With the power unit 15 configured as above, power of the internal combustion engine 16 is transmitted from the crankshaft 2 0 to the rear wheel 13 through the starting clutch 2 8, continuously variable transmission 31, one-way clutch 36, driven shaft 35 and reduction gear mechanism 45.  On the other hand, power of the traveling motor 40 is transmitted from the inner rotor 41 to the rear wheel 45 via the reduction gear mechanism 45. [0039]<br>
The traveling motor 4 0 is a generator and electric machine which assists as an electric machine output of the internal combustion engine 16 and functions as a<br><br>
generator which converts rotation of the driven shaft 35 to electric energy. At the time of braking, rotation of the rear wheel 13 is transmitted to the inner rotor 41 through the reduction gear mechanism 4 5 and the driven shaft 35. This rotation power is converted to electric energy to provide regenerative electric power.<br>
At that time, the rotation power of the rear wheel 13 is not transmitted to the continuously variable transmission 31 and the internal combustion engine 16 due to the function of the one-way clutch 36. [0040]<br>
An air cleaner 50 is attached to the upper portion of the transmission case 29 included in the swing unit type power unit 15 described above.<br>
A storage box 51 is supported by the pair of left and right rear frame 6 of the body frame 2 so as to be disposed above the internal combustion engine 16 of the power unit 15. A fuel pump 52 is mounted on the cross member 5a and the intermediate frames 5, which are formed rectangular.<br>
A 36-V power battery 70 is carried by the front frame 4 of the body frame 2. [0041]<br>
The front portion of the vehicle body is such that<br><br>
a front cover 60 shields the front of the head pipe 3 and a leg shield 61 shields the rear of the head pipe 3 and the rear of the 36-V power battery 70 carried by the front frame 4. The rear of the vehicle body is configured as below. A rear cover 62 is provided to cover the periphery of the storage box 51 and a foot rest space is defined between the leg shied 61 and the rear cover 62. In addition, a step floor 63 covers from above the fuel tank 52 mounted on the intermediate frame 5 and a 12-V power battery 7 8 adjacent to and in front of the fuel tank 52. [0042]<br>
The upper opening of the storage box 51 in the rear cover 62 is closed in an openable manner by a seat 64. [0043]<br>
A traveling-motor driving device 53 built in a flat rectangular case is fixedly attached to the left-hand surface of the storage box 51. Likewise, a starter motor driving device 54 built in a flat rectangular case is fixedly attached to the right-hand surface thereof. [0044]<br>
A control unit (ECU) 80 formed almost-rectangular parallelepipedic and also built in a flat rectangular case is placed in rear of the storage box 51.<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 4, a bracket 65 is fixedly attached at its front end to the vertical rear surface-upper portion of the storage box 51 so as to project backward. The control unit 80 is fixedly attached at its both side surfaces to the bracket 65 and at its lower end to the rear end of the rear frame 6 so as to be inclined backward. [0045]<br>
Accordingly, a V-shaped space 66 as viewed laterally is defined between the storage box 51 and the control unit 80.<br>
Incidentally, a pair of left and right rear winkers 67 is provided to project from the left and right side faces, respectively, of the bracket 65 and supports a tail light 68 therebetween. [0046]<br>
The control -unit 80 outputs control signals to the traveling-motor driving device 53 which drives the traveling motor 4 0 and the starter motor driving device 54 which drives the starter motor 27 for driving control. [0047]<br>
A low-voltage side coupler 53L is attached to the rear face of the flat rectangular case for the traveling-motor driving device 53. A low-voltage harness 81, a<br><br>
control signal line, extends rearward through the low-voltage side coupler 53L, passes through the space 66 between the storage box 51 and the control unit 80 and connects with the control unit 80.  (See Figs. 1 and 3.) [0048]<br>
Likewise, a low-voltage side coupler 54L is attached to the rear face of the flat rectangular case for the starter motor driving device 54.  A low-voltage harness 82, a control signal line, extends backward through a low-voltage side coupler 54L, passes through the space 66  between the storage box 51 and the control unit 80 and connects with the control unit 80.  (See Fig. 2.) [0049]<br>
On the other hand, referring to Fig. 5, the 36-V power battery 70 placed on the front frame 4 of the body frame 2 is carried by a battery case 71 spread out from its center to the left and right.  In the battery case 71, a NiMH battery (nickel metal hydride battery) divided into two groups, a left-hand battery group 70L and a right-hand battery group 70R, which are connected in series to each other through lead wires 72. [0050]<br>
A relay unit 73 and a power fuse 74 are disposed in<br><br>
the middle of the 36-V power battery 70. A plus cord 75a extending from the relay unit 73 and a minus cord 75b extending from the left-hand battery group 70L assemble at a connection coupler 76. [0051]<br>
This connection coupler 7 6 is disposed on the left side of the vehicle body.  A battery high voltage harness 85 or a power line connected to the connection coupler 7 6 extends rearward along the inner surface of the left-hand intermediate frame 5.  Then, this harness 85 extends upward along the rear frame 6 and connects with a high voltage side coupler 53H disposed on the front surface of the traveling-motor driving device 53.  (See Figs. 1 and 3.) [0052]<br>
In addition, a motor high voltage harness (motor power line) 86 extends separately from the high voltage side coupler 53H.  Referring to Figs. 1 and 3, this harness 86 extending from the high voltage side coupler 53H forwardly and obliquely downward goes round the front of the pivot shaft 12 and then reaches the traveling motor 40 disposed at the rear of the power unit 15.<br>
Thus, it is possible to minimize the movement of the motor high voltage harness 86 due to the up-and-down<br><br>
swing of the power unit 15 with respect to the vehicle body, which reduces an effect on the motor high voltage harness 86, thereby enhancing durability. [0053]<br>
The battery high voltage harness 85 extends rearward from the 36-V power battery 70 and it bifurcates into a battery high voltage harness 87 at the rear end of the intermediate frame 5.  The battery high voltage harness 87 bends upward, rides over the cylinder head 19 of the engine 16, shifts to the right-hand side of the vehicle body and then reaches the high voltage side coupler 54H disposed on the front surface of the starter motor driving device 54 .  (See Figs. 1 through 3.) [0054]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, a motor high voltage harness (motor power line) 89 extends separately from the high voltage side coupler 54H.  This harness 89 extends forward and obliquely downward from the high voltage side coupler 54H, then goes round the front of the pivot shaft 12 and reaches the starter motor 27 provided on the right end of the crankshaft 20 of the engine 16 at the front portion of the power unit 15.<br>
Thus, it is possible to minimize the movement of the motor high voltage harness 89 due to the up-and-down<br><br>
swing of the power unit 15 with respect to the vehicle body, thereby enhancing durability of the motor high voltage harness 89. [0055]<br>
Fig. 7 is a schematic block diagram of the electrical system described above.<br>
The control unit 8 0 outputs control signals through the low voltage harnesses 81 and 82 to the traveling-motor driving device 53 and the starter motor driving device 54, respectively, for control, so that the 36-V power battery 7 0 is charged and discharged through the high voltage harnesses 85, 86, 87 and 89. [0056]<br>
The power of the 3 6-V power battery 7 0 is controlled by the traveling-motor driving device 53 and the starter motor driving device 54, and supplied to the traveling motor 40 through the battery high voltage harness 85 and the motor high voltage harness 86.  Thus, starting power is supplied to the starter motor 27 through the battery high voltage harnesses 85, 87 and the motor high voltage harness 89.<br>
Incidentally, the power of the 12-V power battery 78 is supplied to the control unit 80, an ignition system and a lighting system.<br><br>
Upon braking of the vehicle, the traveling motor 40 operates as a generator to convert the rotary power of the rear wheel 13 to electric energy, thus, providing regenerative electric power.  This regenerative electric power is controlled by the traveling-motor driving device 53, and is supplied via the motor high voltage harness 86 and the battery high voltage harness 85 to the 3 6-V power battery 70 for regenerative charge. [0058]<br>
During the operation of the internal combustion engine 16, the starter motor 27 operates as a generator to convert the rotary power of the crankshaft 2 0 to electric energy, thus generating electric power.  This generated electric power is controlled by the starter motor driving device 54, and is supplied via the motor high voltage harness 89 and the motor high voltage harnesses 85, 87 to the traveling-motor driving device 53 to power it. At the same time, the electric power is supplied to the 36-V power battery 70, reduced in voltage at a down-converter 55 and supplied via the battery low-voltage harness 88 to the 12-V power battery 78 for charge.<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the 36-V power battery 70 is disposed at the front frame 4 of the body frame 2 and the control unit 80 is placed in rear of the storage box 51. The battery high voltage harness 85 and the motor high voltage harness 86 extend by way of the high voltage side coupler 53H to a position in front of the traveling-motor driving device 53 attached to the left side face of the storage box 51.  In addition, the low voltage harness 81 extends by way of the low-voltage side coupler 53L to a position in rear of the traveling-motor driving device 53. Thus, the high voltage harnesses 85, 86 is completely separated from the low-voltage harness 81, so that they have a less effect such as noise on the low-voltage harness 81.  In addition, the high voltage harnesses 85, 86 and the low-voltage harness 81 can be handled with ease and all these wiring can be reduced in length. [0060]<br>
Likewise, referring to Fig. 2, the 12-V power battery 78 is disposed at the front portion of the intermediate frame 5 included the body frame 2 and the control unit 80 is placed in rear of the storage box 51. The battery high voltage harness 87 and the motor high voltage harness 89 extend by way of the high voltage side coupler 54H to a position in front of the starter motor<br><br>
driving device 54 attached to the right side face of the storage box.  In addition, the low-voltage harness 82 extends by way of the low-voltage side coupler 54L to a position rearward of the starter motor driving device 54. Thus, the high voltage harnesses 87, 89 have a less effect such as noise on the low-voltage harness 82, the high voltage harnesses 87, 89 and the low-voltage harness 82 can be handled with ease and all these wiring can be reduced in length.<br>
[0061]<br>
The traveling-motor driving device 53, the starter motor driving device 54 and the control unit 80 are disposed by using the unoccupied space around the storage box 51 below the seat 64, so that the space usability can be enhanced.<br>
[0062]<br>
The control unit 8 0 is attached in an inclined manner to a portion rearward of the storage box 51 so as to define the space 6 6 therebetween and the low-voltage harnesses 81, 82 are wired through the space 66, so that the unoccupied space can be utilized further effectively.<br>
[0063]<br>
In addition, the traveling-motor driving device 53<br>
and the starter motor driving device 54 are respectively<br><br>
attached 10 the left and right side faces of the storage box 52 and the control unit BO is disposed to hide behind the storage box 51.  Therefore, the control unit 80 is less affected by heat of the power unit 15, the traveling-motor driving device 53 and the starter motor driving device 54.<br>
[0064]<br>
The embodiment described above is applied to the hybrid, scooter type electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle 1 on which the internal combustion engine is mounted; however, it is obviously applicable to an electrically-driven two-wheeled vehicle, which runs by a motor only, without an internal combustion engine mounted thereon.<br>
