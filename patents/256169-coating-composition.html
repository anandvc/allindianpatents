				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
Title of the Invention:<br>
Coating Composition<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a coating composition capable of forming a coating showing excellent properties in finish properties, drying properties, hardness, adhesion properties, etc., and substantially free of volatile organic compounds such as toluene/ xylene and the like, use of which is controlled due to influences on environment. Description of Background Art:<br>
In the art, an acrylic lacquer and acrylurethane coating composition are mainly used in the field of an automobile-repair coating composition from the standpoint of drying a coating film under the conditions of normal temperature drying or forced drying.<br>
In the case where a lacquer type coating composition is used in the above field, from the standpoint of drying properties of coating film, a coating composition containing, as a main vehicle component, a blend of a polyester resin with cellulose acetate butylate (hereinafter may be referred to as CAB), a blend of an acrylic resin with polyester resin and CAB, etc., has been used, resulting such problems that unsatisfactory compatibility between respective components may cause undesirable influences on finish properties, and that, in a metallic coating, phenomenon exhibiting a pigment<br>
orientation mottles in a pigment-containing coating film after coating (hereinafter may be referred to as mottling), and phenomenon exhibiting a pigment orientation mottles in a pigment-containing coating film after coating a clear coating composition onto the pigment-containing coating film, (hereinafter may be referred to as after-mottling) may reduce finish properties.<br>
For the purpose of solving the above problems, the present applicant proposed in the following patent references 1 and 2 a coating composition containing a CAB graft copolymer, polyester resin and acrylic resin in a specified mixing ratio. The use of the above coating composition makes it possible to improve compatibility between respective components, and to form a coating film showing good finish appearance without exhibiting mottling and after-mottling even in the metallic coating. However, the above coating composition is such that the coating composition and a diluting thinner for controlling a viscosity of the coating composition contain an organic solvent such as toluene, xylene and the like.<br>
Generally, a coating composition prepared by a coating composition producer has a viscosity too high to be subjected to coating as it is, so that the coating composition producer provides a distributor the coating composition along with a diluting thinner. A painter may buy the above coating composition and the diluting thinner from the distributor, and may formulate the above coating composition and the<br>
diluting thinner so as to be coated for the purpose of controlling a viscosity and coating workability as required.<br>
Recently, influences of the volatile organic compound on environment has produced problems, and the organic solvents usually used in the field of coating compositions/ for example, toluene, xylene, etc. are regulated as environmental pollutants, for example, under Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (hereinafter may referred to as PRTR), etc. Consequently, the coating compositions and diluting thinners containing the above organic solvents in a reduced amount or substantially free of the above organic solvents are highly demanded.<br>
In connection therewith, the following Patent Reference No. 3 discloses an automobile-repair coating composition comprising a specified (meth)acrylic copolymer, a polyisocyanate compound and an organic solvent in a specified amount, the organic solvent being an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon solvent having a specified solubility parameter and a specified boiling point.<br>
However, the use of the above coating composition produces such problems that the use of the above coating composition as a clear coating composition onto a metallic coating film makes possible controlling development of after-mottling and providing a metallic finish with good appearance, whereas the use of the above coating composition as a base coating composition results unsatisfactory coating film properties in finish properties, drying properties and<br>
adhesion properties, and that the above coating composition contains organic solvents such as toluene/ xylene, etc.<br>
On the other hand, for the purpose of solving the above problems, for example, in the coating compositions such as base coat coating composition, clear coating composition as used in metallic coating in the art, removal of organic solvents such as toluene, xylene and the like from the coating composition or diluting thinner and replacement with an organic solvent dissolving the resin in the coating composition, for example, an ester organic solvent and the like may exhibit after-mottling, as well as phenomenon of mottling, and particularly may remarkably reduce finish properties due to redissolution of the coating film with the organic solvents replaced on forming a clear coating film onto the metallic coating film.<br>

Publication No. 2000-178500<br>

Publication No. 2002-129090<br>
Patent Reference 3: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
Publication No. 256715/94 Summary of the Invention:<br>
An, object of the present invention is to provide a coating composition which is substantially free of the volatile organic compounds and shows good properties in coating workability and finish properties, and which is capable of forming a coating film showing good properties in<br>
water resistance, adhesion properties, etc.<br>
For the purpose of solving the above problems, the present inventors made intensive studies to find out that a specified coating composition containing a base coating composition (I) comprising a specified resin composition and a specified organic solvent, and a diluent (II) containing a specified amount of a specified organic solvent can solve the above problems, resulting in accomplishing the present invention.<br>
That is, the present invention relates to a coating composition containing a base coating composition (I) comprising a cellulose derivative (A), an acrylic resin (B), a polyester resin (C) and at least one organic solvent (D) selected from the group consisting of an ester organic solvent and a ketone organic solvent, and a diluent (II) comprising an aliphatic hydrocarbon organic solvent (E), the cellulose derivative (A) being contained in an amount of 5 to 75% by weight based on the weight of a total solid content of the components (A), (B) and (C), the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent (D) being contained in an amount of 5 to 90% by weight in the diluent (II), the base coating composition (I) preferably being a metallic base coating composition, and a coating method by use of the coating composition.<br>
The present invention can provide the following particular effects.<br>
The present coating composition is substantially free of the volatile organic compounds under regulation so as to<br>
be harmless to environment and human body.<br>
The present coating composition shows good storage stability, because the base coating composition comprises specified resins and specified organic solvent and shows good compatibility between respective components.<br>
The present coating composition makes it possible to form a coating film showing good properties in finish properties, water resistance, adhesion properties, etc. under the conditions of normal temperature drying or forced drying, because mixing the base coating composition with the diluent containing a specified amount of the specified solvent results in that the coating composition on coating can have a specified solvent composition.<br>
The present coating composition makes it possible to control redissolution on forming a clear coating film onto the metallic coating film, and to form a coating film showing good finish properties without developing metallic pigment orientation mottling even in the case of a metallic coating, in which mottling and after-mottling may easily take place.
