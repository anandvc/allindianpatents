				<td>ACOUSTIC RECONFIGURATION<br>
DEVICES AND METHODS<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] Disclosed are devices and methods for acoustic reconfiguration of an audio<br>
device, and more particularly, devices and methods for enhancing the output<br>
frequency response of a portable audio device or mobile communication device.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The makers of portable audio devices, including those of cellular<br>
telephones and portable music devices, are increasingly adding functionality to their<br>
devices. For example, cellular telephones include features such as music playback<br>
systems, multimedia playback systems, video cameras, video streaming, two-way<br>
video calling, internet browsing, and other audio processing features. While there is a<br>
trend toward the inclusion of more features and improvements for current features,<br>
there is also a trend toward smaller portable audio devices. As the devices have<br>
become increasingly smaller, loudspeakers of the devices are smaller as well.<br>
However, speaker quality, at least in part, remains a function of size.<br>
[0003] The desired or required size of a portable audio device may also limit the<br>
manufacturer's choices for speaker cavity size and the location of the speaker within<br>
the housing of the device. The efficiency of a loudspeaker can depend to some extent<br>
on the acoustic load placed on it by the way it couples to its surrounding structures<br>
such as the speaker cavity and/or the device housing. In electrical terms a load is<br>
something that dissipates power and does some work. In acoustic terms a load is an<br>
acoustic structure that has a particular acoustic impedance. Such an impedance may<br>
be that of radiation from an aperture into air. The frequency response of a loudspeaker<br>
system can depend upon how the system is "loaded" in much the same way that the<br>
output from a power amplifier depends on the load impedance. The power amplifier<br>
drives an electrical load specified in Ohms. A loudspeaker drives an acoustic load<br>
that may be specified in units of acoustic Ohms or Rayls. Introducing a speaker<br>
system to a particular load will produce a particular transfer function or frequency<br>
response and a sound pressure level (SPL) in decibels (dB) when the speaker is driven<br>
at a nominal input voltage or power, for example, 2.83 V or 1W input.<br>
[0004] A portable audio device architecture typically includes a speaker or<br>
speakers that radiate sound energy out of a surface of the device. While the quality of<br>
a small speaker for use during voice telephone calls may be sufficient, a user may find<br>
using the same speaker for music and multimedia playback systems inadequate.<br>
Loudness and the bass response of a loudspeaker system of a portable audio device<br>
may be particularly lacking. Improvement of the sound quality may be desired by<br>
users who in particular use the device for music and/or multimedia playback.<br>

DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] It would be beneficial to enhance the frequency performance of a portable<br>
audio device loudspeaker sound system without increasing the size of the transducer<br>
or speaker and/or speaker cavity, or the power requirements of the sound system.<br>
Moreover, it would be beneficial to enhance the sound quality without adding any<br>
costs to the device by way of utilizing a particularly expensive speaker. It would also<br>
be beneficial to provide a plurality of sound quality enhancement options to a user<br>
depending on their sound needs.<br>
[0017] Disclosed is a quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover, a portable audio<br>
device and acoustic cover combination and method for replacing the frequency<br>
response of a speaker housed by a portable audio device housing with a different<br>
frequency response by attaching a quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover to the<br>
portable audio device. In this way, the separate removable cover replaces the original<br>
cover of the device, and augments the device's sound system by adding additional<br>
acoustic volumes and ports to the rear and in some cases to the front of the speaker or<br>
transducer. Many different embodiments of the disclosed quick-disconnect passive<br>
acoustic cover are described in detail below. Each embodiment may provide a<br>
different frequency response from the others. An advantage of many embodiments is<br>
that a user may have a choice in Which embodiment to utilize depending upon their<br>
sound quality preference.<br>
[0018] As discussed above, while the quality of a small speaker in a small<br>
acoustic volume for use during voice telephone calls may be sufficient, a user may<br>
find using the same speaker for music and multimedia playback systems inadequate.<br>
Loudness and/or the bass response of a typical loudspeaker system of a mobile<br>
communication device may be particularly lacking. According to the disclosed<br>
acoustic cover and method, a portable audio device can be configured to removably<br>
receive a disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover. By replacing the<br>
disclosed standard cover of the portable audio device with another disclosed quick-<br>
disconnect passive acoustic cover, the frequency response of the speaker, or<br>
loudspeaker of a portable audio device may be enhanced by an improved frequency<br>
response. In this way, a user may find the audio output of the device/cover<br>
combination better for music and other multimedia playback.<br>
[0019] More particularly, disclosed is a portable audio device including a housing<br>
and a speaker supported by the housing wherein the speaker and housing having a<br>
first system frequency response. The speaker has a first side and a second side<br>
associated with a first acoustic load and a second acoustic load. The housing is<br>
configured to removably receive a quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover which is<br>
configured to redefine at least one of the first acoustic load and the second acoustic<br>
load so as to replace the first system frequency response with a second system<br>
frequency response. That is, the quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover beneficially<br>
enhances the efficiency of a loudspeaker, which as mentioned above depends to some<br>
extent on the acoustic load placed on it by the way it is coupled to its surrounding<br>
structures such as the speaker cavity and/or the device housing. The disclosed quick-<br>
disconnect passive acoustic cover provides one or more additional surrounding<br>
structures which in the disclosed configurations, enhance the frequency response of<br>
the device speaker with an improved frequency response. A disclosed quick-<br>
disconnect passive acoustic cover may be easily removed and replaced, providing<br>
easy access to sound quality options to the user.<br>
[0020] The instant disclosure is provided to explain in an enabling fashion the<br>
best modes of making and using various embodiments in accordance with the present<br>
invention. The disclosure is further offered to enhance an understanding and<br>
appreciation for the invention principles and advantages thereof, rather than to limit in<br>
any manner the invention. While the preferred embodiments of the invention are<br>
illustrated and described here, it is clear that the invention is not so limited.<br>
Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions, and equivalents will<br>
occur to those skilled in the art having the benefit of this disclosure without departing<br>
from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims.<br>
[0021] It is understood that the use of relational terms, if any, such as first and<br>
second, up and down, and the like are used solely to distinguish one from another<br>
entity or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship<br>
or order between such entities or actions.<br>
[0022] FIG. 1 depicts a side cut-away view of a portable audio device 102 and in<br>
particular its housing 104, and a speaker 106 that can be a low sound level transducer<br>
or receiver used for private conversation and/or as a loudspeaker when the device 102<br>
is placed in speakerphone mode. The speaker 106 may be supported or carried by the<br>
housing 104, and in particular in a speaker cavity 112. The speaker includes two<br>
sides, a first side 108 that can radiate sound energy out of a surface of the housing 104<br>
of the device 102 and a second side of the speaker 110 that may radiate into the<br>
housing, and more particularly into the speaker cavity 112. A first audio port 114 of<br>
the housing 104 is proximal to the first side 108 of the speaker 106, and a second<br>
audio port 116 is proximal the second side 110 of the speaker 106. The first audio<br>
port 114 has a first acoustic load (in this case radiation into air) and the second audio<br>
port 116 has a second acoustic load. As mentioned above, the efficiency of a<br>
loudspeaker and/or the frequency response of the device can depend to some extent<br>
on the acoustic load placed on it by the way it couples to its surrounding structures<br>
such as the speaker cavity and/or the device housing.<br>
[0023] The portable audio device 102 may be implemented as a cellular telephone<br>
(also called a mobile phone). The portable audio device 102 represents a wide variety<br>
of devices that have been developed for use within various communication networks.<br>
Such handheld communication devices include, for example, cellular telephones,<br>
messaging devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs), notebook or laptop computers,<br>
mobile data terminals, application specific gaming devices, video gaming devices,<br>
portable music players, and the like. Any of these portable devices may be referred to<br>
as a mobile station or user equipment. Herein, wireless communication technologies<br>
may include, for example, voice communication, the capability of transferring digital<br>
data, SMS messaging, Internet access, multi-media content access and/or voice over<br>
internet protocol (VoIP).<br>
[0024] As mentioned, the speaker 106 includes two sides, a first side 108 that can<br>
radiate sound energy out of a surface of the housing 104 of the device 102 at the first<br>
audio port 114 and a second side 110 of the speaker that may radiate into the housing<br>
104, and more particularly into the speaker cavity 112. The described portable audio<br>
device 102 includes the second audio port 116 which may be utilized by particular<br>
embodiments of the disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover (see FIG. 2).<br>
The second audio port 116 may provide more tunability of the frequency response of<br>
the device 102 than were the device to include a single audio port. It is understood<br>
that two or more audio ports are within the scope of this discussion.<br>
[0025] FIG. 2 depicts a side cut-away view of a portable audio device 202 and in<br>
particular its housing 204, and a speaker 206 and an embodiment of the disclosed<br>
quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover 230. The surface 220 may be the front<br>
surface of the device 202 or may be the back surface of the device 202. Alternatively,<br>
the surface 222 may be the front surface of the device 202 or may be the back surface<br>
of the device 202. The cover 230 is depicted unattached to the device 202 to a surface<br>
222 of the device. As a standard cover, the cover 230 may include at least one<br>
channel 232 or a plurality of channels 232, 233, 234, 235, and 236, or any suitable<br>
number of channels. When the cover 230 is not attached to the housing, the first<br>
audio port 214 of the housing 204 that is proximal to the first side 208 of the speaker<br>
206, and a second audio port 216 proximal the second side 210 of the speaker 206, the<br>
first audio port 214 has a first acoustic load and the second audio port 216 has a<br>
second acoustic load. The audio ports 214 and 216 may reside on different surfaces<br>
of the housing 204, and the cover 230 may overlap more than one surface of the<br>
.housing204. As a standard cover 230, the cover may also include a plug or seal 238<br>
configured to seal at least one of the first audio port 214 and the second audio port<br>
216. In the depicted embodiment, the plug or seal 238 may be used to seal the second<br>

[0026] FIG. 3 depicts a side cut-away view of a portable audio device 302 and in<br>
particular its housing 304, a speaker 306, and the same or similar embodiment of the<br>
disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover of 330 of FIG. 2 removably<br>
received by the housing 304. As mentioned above, the efficiency of a speaker and/or<br>
the frequency response of the device 102 can depend to some extent on the acoustic<br>
load placed on it by the way it couples to its surrounding structures such as the<br>
speaker cavity 312 and/or the device housing 304. The depicted embodiment shows a<br>
channel 332 configured to be coupled to at least one of the first audio port 314 and the<br>
second audio port 316 of the device housing 304. That is, at least one channel 332 or<br>
a plurality of channels 332, 333, 334, 335, and 336, or any suitable number of<br>
channels, may extend the length of the first audio port 314. Also depicted is a plug or<br>
seal 338 that may be used to seal, for example, the second audio port 316, redefining<br>
the load or loads of at least one of the first acoustic load and the second acoustic load<br>
so as to replace the original system frequency response of the device 302 (without the<br>
cover 330 removably received by the housing 304) with a second system frequency<br>
response. Accordingly, cover 330 in its default configuration, as an original cover,<br>
may allow the sound signal from the front of the speaker to radiate from the first<br>
audio port 314 and block a passage, that is, audio port 316 emanating from the rear of<br>
the speaker to form an acoustic suspension system with a usable bandwidth and a<br>
small overall product size.<br>
[0027] The disclosed device 302 is according configured to attach a removably<br>
attachable quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover 330 to the housing 304 of the<br>
portable audio device 302 and with one or more channels 332. The cover 330 may<br>
direct output of the speaker 306 and the housing system including the housing 304<br>
and/or the housing cavity 312 into a first acoustic input port 314 of the cover 330<br>
structure to generate and acoustic output different than that of the device 302 without<br>
the cover 330 and thus enhance the frequency response of the device 302. The cover<br>
330 may be removably attachable to the front of the device, in which case it may<br>
include apertures for a keypad and/or display screen. Alternatively the cover 330 may<br>
be removably attachable to the back of the device 302. The requirements of the<br>
device may dictate in which direction the speaker faces, toward the front of the device<br>
302 or the back of the device 302. It is also understood that the device 302 may<br>
include more than one speaker, and that an embodiment of the cover 330 may be<br>
configured to process sound from more than one speaker. It is also understood that<br>
cover 330 may be removably attachable to more than one surface of the device 302.<br>
[0028] FIG. 4 depicts a portable audio device 402 with its housing 404 including a<br>
standard cover 440 on its back side 442 and a first loudspeaker audio port 414 and a<br>
second loudspeaker audio port 416. Standard cover 440 in this embodiment also<br>
serves as a battery cover and is the equivalent of covers 230 and 330 in figures 2 and<br>
3. In the depicted portable audio device 402, the standard battery cover 440 may be<br>
replaced by a cover, for example cover 230 (see FIG. 2). It is understood that the first<br>
audio port 414 and the second audio port 416 may be of any suitable size and<br>
configuration, and may be placed in any suitable location on the housing 404. As<br>
mentioned above, many different embodiments of the disclosed quick-disconnect<br>
passive acoustic cover 230 are described in detail below. Each embodiment may<br>
provide a different frequency response from the others. An advantage of many<br>
embodiments is that a user may have a choice in which embodiment to utilize<br>
depending upon their sound quality preference. It is understood that this discussion is<br>
intended to include any and all different embodiments of a disclosed quick-disconnect<br>
passive acoustic cover may be implemented.<br>
[0029] FIG. 5 depicts a portable audio device 502 with its housing 504 including a<br>
back side 542, and its standard cover 440 (FIG. 4) replaced by an embodiment of the<br>
disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover 550. The illustrated cover 550<br>
embodiment is coupled to either or both the first loudspeaker audio port 414 and the<br>
second loudspeaker audio port 416. The illustrated cover 550 includes a transmission<br>
line 546 embodiment that can snake through the cover 550 to extend the length of<br>
either or both the first loudspeaker audio port 414 and a second loudspeaker audio<br>
port 416 to increase the low end frequency response of the device 502. The original<br>
frequency response of the loudspeaker 306 (see FIG. 3) transmitted from either or<br>
both the first loudspeaker audio port 414 and a second loudspeaker audio port 416, is<br>
replaced by a new frequency response now emanating from the cover 550. The use of<br>
cover 550 produces a first acoustic output from channel 532 and a second acoustic<br>
output from aperture 558. That is, combining the first acoustic output and the second<br>
acoustic output of the cover 550 forms a combined output so that the combined output<br>
of the system has a new or second frequency response that differs from the original or<br>
the first frequency response of the speaker 306 and housing 504. A transmission line<br>
embodiment of a cover 550 is discussed in more detail below. It is understood the<br>
cover 550 may be on the front of the device 502 or the back side of the device 502, or<br>
in any other suitable position to couple to a first speaker output port 414 and/or a<br>
second speaker output port 416 which may be in any suitable position.<br>

audio port 614 and the second audio port 616 of the device housing 604.<br>
Additionally, for example, channels 632,633, 634, 635, and 636 may be coupled to<br>
the first audio port 614. As mentioned above, many different embodiments of the<br>
disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover 660 are described in detail below.<br>
Each embodiment may provide a different frequency response from the others. That<br>
is, any of several bandpass configurations individually or simultaneously may be<br>
applied to front and/or back side of the speaker 606.<br>
[0031] FIG. 7 depicts a side cut-away view of a portable audio device 702 and in<br>
particular its housing 704, a speaker 706, and still another embodiment of the<br>

housing 704 in a bass reflex configuration. In the embodiment of FIG. 7, the cover<br>
770 is a bass reflex cover, the audio port 714 being coupled to a plurality of channels<br>
732, 733, 734, 735, and 736, and the audio port 716 being coupled to a volume 754.<br>
At least one aperture 758 may be remote from at least one of the first audio port 714<br>
and/or the second audio port 716 of the device housing 704 to define, for example, a<br>
Helmholtz resonator configured to be coupled to at least one of the first audio port<br>
714 and/or the second audio port 716 of the device housing 704. In this embodiment,<br>
if the user prefers a bass reflex improvement over the sound quality of the device<br>
without the cover 770, an advantage of many embodiments, some of which are<br>
described here, is that a user may have a choice in which embodiment to utilize<br>
depending upon their sound quality preference. One specific embodiment of cover<br>
770 would have a special volume 754 of zero. This would form a Helmholtz resonator<br>
with the port formed by aperture 758 and the acoustic volume in speaker cavity 712.<br>
[0032] FIG. 8 depicts a side cut-away view of a portable audio device 802 and in<br>

upon their sound quality preference. It is understood that bandpass implementations of<br>
cover 880 could consist of two bass reflex sections as shown in figure 8, or of one<br>
bass reflex section and one acoustic suspension section, or of two sections that are<br>
coupled via an additional aperture between the volumes 854 and 862.<br>
[0033] FIG. 9 depicts a side cut-away view of a portable audio device 902 and in<br>
particular its housing 904, a speaker 906, and an embodiment similar to that of FIG. 5<br>
of the disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover 990 removably received by<br>
the housing 904 in an acoustic transmission line configuration. A duct-shaped<br>
volume 972 including an open end 974 is configured to be coupled to at least one of<br>
the first audio port 914 and/or the second audio port 916 of the device housing 904 to<br>
form a transmission line tuned to a particular frequency. The cover 990 is similar to<br>
the transmission line embodiment of FIG. 5, where cover 550 includes a transmission<br>
line 546 embodiment that can snake through the cover 550 to extend the length of<br>
either or both the first loudspeaker audio port 414 (see FIG. 4) and a second<br>
loudspeaker audio port 416 to increase the low end frequency response of the device<br>
502. Again, channels 932, 933,934, 935, and 936 are depicted coupled to the first<br>
audio port 914. It is understood that any combination of channel configurations may<br>
be utilized in the disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover to provide any<br>
number of frequency response enhancements.<br>
[0034] The dimensions of the disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover<br>
may vary depending upon the configuration. The disclosed quick-disconnect passive<br>
acoustic cover may add for example, 4 mm to the thickness of a device 902. The<br>
disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover may be composed of any suitable<br>
material such as polycarbonate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), or aluminum.<br>
It may be configured to snap into position on a device 102 (see FIG. 1) where the<br>
housing 104 includes, for example, ridges to receive the disclosed quick-disconnect<br>
passive acoustic cover. Removing the disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic<br>
cover may include, for example, sliding the cover off the housing. It is understood<br>
that any suitable matter of removably attaching the cover and removing the cover<br>
from the housing is within the scope of this discussion.<br>
[0035] FIG. 10 depicts another embodiment of the disclosed quick-disconnect<br>
passive acoustic cover 1000 removably received by the housing 1004 where a side<br>
cut-away view of a portable audio device 1002 and in particular its housing 1004,<br>
shows a speaker 1006 at an end 1018 of the device housing 1004 with a matched cross<br>
section at the housing/cover interface. The end 1018 may also be referred to herein as<br>
an end surface. As mentioned, the positions of the first audio port 1014 and the<br>
second audio port 1016 may be in any suitable location. In this embodiment, the first<br>
audio port 1014 is proximal the speaker 1006 at the end 1018 of the device housing<br>
1014. Also shown are channels 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, and 1036 proximal the first<br>
audio port 1014 at the proximal the end 1018 of the device housing 1014. Similar to<br>
the embodiments of FIGS. 5 and 9, a duct-shaped volume 1072 including an open end<br>
1074 is configured to be coupled to at least one of the first audio port 1014 and/or the<br>
second audio port 1016 of the device housing 1004 to form a transmission line tuned<br>
to a particular frequency. In this embodiment, housing cavity 1012, when coupled to<br>
duct-shaped volume 1072 via second audio port 1016, is configured as a duct with<br>
continuous cross section identical to that of duct-shaped volume 1072. Housing<br>
cavity 1012 thereby becomes an extension of duct-shaped volume 1072, thereby<br>
extending the usable length of duct-shaped volume 1072 as an acoustic transmission<br>
line, and enabling a lower tuning frequency than would otherwise be possible due to<br>
the length of duct-shaped volume 1072 by itself. Additionally, the combination of<br>
housing cavity 1012 and duct-shaped volume 1072 can be a constantly varying taper<br>
that continues a defined transition throughout the combined length.<br>
[0036] FIGS. 11a-11 e are a series of graphs where the x-axis is calibrated in<br>
frequency in Hertz (Hz), and the y-axis is calibrated in sound pressure level in dB<br>
(dBSPL), that illustrates bandwidth and/or efficiency improvements for each of the<br>
disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic covers. FIG. 1 le illustrates a<br>
transmission line embodiment of the disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic<br>
cover such as one of those embodiments depicted in FIGS. 5, 9 and/or 10. As<br>
discussed above, the speaker 106 (see FIG. 1) has a first side and a second side<br>
associated with a first acoustic load and a second acoustic load. The housing 104 is<br>
configured to removably receive a quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover which is<br>
configured to redefine at least one of the first acoustic load and the second acoustic<br>
load so as to replace the first system frequency response with a second system<br>
frequency response. A first frequency response 1186 is illustrated as having a rising<br>
frequency response with less low frequency output than a second frequency response<br>
1188 associated with the transmission line embodiment. The second frequency<br>
response 1188 may replace the first frequency response 1186 of a device 102 (see<br>
FIG. 1), when the disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover such as cover<br>
550, 990 and/or 1000 is removably attached to device 102. FIGS, lla-1 le illustrate<br>
the second frequency responses for the system when each of the disclosed quick-<br>
disconnect passive acoustic covers are attached to device 102. The second frequency<br>
responses for each embodiment are as follows: a standard sealed cover 1187 (FIG.<br>
1 la), an acoustic suspension cover 1189 (FIG. 1 lb), a bass reflex cover 1190 (FIG.<br>
1 lc), a bandpass cover 1191 (FIG. 11d), and an acoustic transmission line cover 1188<br>
(FIG. 11e).<br>
[0037] The disclosed portable audio device includes a housing and a speaker<br>
supported by the housing wherein the speaker and housing have a first system<br>
frequency response. The speaker of the disclosed portable audio device has a first<br>
side and a second side associated a first audio port and a second audio port, in turn<br>
associated with a first acoustic load and a second acoustic load. The housing is<br>
configured to removably receive the disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic<br>
cover which is configured to redefine at least one of the first acoustic load and the<br>
second acoustic load so as to replace the first system frequency response with a<br>
second system frequency response. That is, the quick-disconnect passive acoustic<br>
cover beneficially enhances the efficiency and/or bandwidth of a loudspeaker, which<br>
as mentioned above depends to some extent on the acoustic load placed on it by the<br>
way it is coupled to its surrounding structures.<br>
[0038] The disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover provides one or<br>
more additional surrounding structures which in the disclosed configurations, replace<br>
the inherent frequency response of the device speaker and housing with an improved<br>
frequency response. A disclosed quick-disconnect passive acoustic cover may be<br>
easily removed and replaced, providing easy access to sound quality options to the<br>
user without increasing the size of the transducer or speaker and/or speaker cavity, or<br>
the power requirements of the sound system. Moreover, the disclosed quick-<br>
disconnect passive acoustic cover beneficially can improve the sound quality without<br>
adding any costs to the device by way of utilizing a particularly expensive speaker.<br>
Also as discussed above, different embodiments of the disclosed quick-disconnect<br>
passive acoustic cover beneficially provides a plurality of sound quality options to a<br>
user depending on their sound needs.<br>
