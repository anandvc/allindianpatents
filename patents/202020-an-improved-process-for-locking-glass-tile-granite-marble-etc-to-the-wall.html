THE PATENTS ACT, 1970<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (SECTION-10)<br>
An improved process for locking glass/tile/granite/marble etc. to the wall.<br>
	SANJAY DOSHI<br>
SAIGARDEN, 1ST FLOOR, AMBADI ROAD, BEHIND LABH COMPLEX, NEXT TO DHURI AUTO<br>
GARAGE,<br>
	VASAI (WEST) THANE 401 202.<br>
MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
An Indian National<br>
The following specification particularly describes this invention and the manner   in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to an impermeable process for locking glass/tiles/Granite/Marble permanently into the wall. The process is about fixing glass wall tiles into wall wherein the novelty lies in first of its kind various steps ensuring a permanent and strong sticking effect upon the wall. As known in the art, certain materials require covering the breathing space that remains while fixing glass/tiles into the wall.<br>
Reference is made here in to a process for fixing glass /tiles/granite/marble/ceramic etc. in to wall where by the sticking effect resulting out of the unique process is powerful enough to stick with the wall permanently by way of hook having strong power hitherto unseen in the traditional system of sticking as prevalent today.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The normal process of fixing the wall tile/glass/marble/ceramic etc. to the wall is by using a layer of adhesive or gum on the surface and/or wall and then by applying pressure after fixing.<br>
This traditional process takes from one hour to six hours to get dried up the gum or adhesive.<br>
The traditional method is not perfect as it depends on the quality of bonding adhesive/chemicals and cement. As a result, it may some time happen that at a later stage the tiles so fixed may come out due the air bubbles created while applying adhesive and also due to water and moister in the atmosphere resulting in loosening the grip. By the use of traditional method, sometimes cracks may appear which may inter alia spoil the look or design of the wall tiles.<br><br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main object of the invention is to obviate the disadvantages inherent in the prior art.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a permanent bonding where by once the tile/glass/marble/ceramic etc. sticks to the wall, it systematically avoids creating bubbles and takes care of the moisture effect in the air as one point solution resulting thereby making a strong grip with the help of specifically designed mould fixed on the back side of tiles/glass/granite/marble which acts like a locking hook.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a sticking bond, which prevents the ingress of moisture attached to the surface.<br>
Further objects and advantages of my invention will become apparent from a consideration of the drawings and ensuing description.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In order to achieve the above objectives and others, the present invention provides an improved process for locking glass/tile/granite/marble etc. to the wall.<br>
A new process to create a bonding solution with permanent grip by the unique method of sticking unto wall.<br><br>
A step by step procedure more particularly is set out as under:<br>
In order to obviate such disadvantage as inherent in the traditional method, the present inventive process if systematically followed creates a sticking bond which prevents the ingress of moister attached to the surface and secondly, it prevents possible / loss of life due to accidental fall of tiles as known in the art. A step by step procedure more particularly is set out as under:<br>
Making of mould in different sizes with a hole at the bottom. A parallel cut is given from one end to other end at the bottom of the mould. Mould could be of varied sizes such as oval, rectangular, round, square, triangular etc. Kindly refer figure' 1a to 1e '.<br>
The object of keeping hole at the bottom is that while applying tiles on the wall on the layer of cement it works like hooks or clips. The cement paste or bonding solution is passed through the hole and when it gets dried powerful bond, without any bobble, is automatically created and wall tiles are fixed on the wall permanently.<br>
Preparation of adhesive or bonding solution by mixing various chemicals to fix the mould on the back side of wall tiles.<br>
Another means known in the art is the admixture of two types of chemicals such as<br>
M-seal and Zatpat applied in the percentage of 40% and 60% specifically.These chemicals are abundantly available in the market. The mixture of chemicals are added in the resin hardener to make the mixture into semi liquid-form. Such paste is passed through the hole of the mould by way of applying hydraulic pressure so that the paste could pass from top to bottom without making any bubbles in the hole of the mould. Then the glass/tile with, the fixed mould at its back is fixed on the wall tiles. The<br><br>
whole process takes at least 60 minutes approximately to create a powerful grip to stick to the wall tiles permanently.<br>
Kindly refer figure II.<br>
The backside surface of the glass/tiles is made rough with the help of sands, ceramic powder or with any kind of powder or chemicals so that the surface does not loose the grip with cement and sticks to the wall powerfully. In the continued art, the applicant uses the mixture of indigenously developed chemicals with sands and ceramic powder to make the back surface rough. The proportion varies as per the climatic condition.<br>
Kindly refer figure 3.<br>
Extra stuffiness is required to prevent the air or moisture from getting into.<br>
Finally a layer of approximately 25 mm thickness of cement is applied on the backside of the tiles and then fixed on the wall. While adhering to the process, the cement will pass through the hole of the mould which would produce a lock like grip end when the cements get dried up, a powerful grip is formed to give a permanent sticking effect. In the systematic art, the water and moisture in the atmosphere do not affect the tiles and no harm is caused to the tiles. Kindly refer figure 4.<br>
The bonding solution commonly applied is embodied with many disadvantages as outlined hereinabove. With the present case, no gaps and no bubbles are created so as to withstand the moisture effect and in particular a hook like grip is created to the wall by the use of mould, which strongly creates a permanent grip.<br><br>
As a result, the strong grip can withstand any kind outside pressure. If the wall shakes, no damaging effect could be felt on the tiles because of its strong bonding effect created by following the process as aforestated.<br>
Accordingly, the primary object of this invention is to propose a novel construction module whereby a glass/tile/granite/marble/ceramic is fixed to the wall with a powerful grip having permanent solution with the help of mould and powdery materials and cement.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an unique first of its kind process that avoids the bobble effect and moisture effect in the air while applying hydraulic pressure.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose on impermeable bonding solution with the help of chemicals and powdery materials such as cement and which is simple to follow which a person of ordinary prudence can understand and apply.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose a bonding solution to fix the glass/tiles/granite/marble/ceramic to the wall which is efficient having permanent sticking effect.<br>
The number of moulds to be fixed could vary according to the size of the glass/ tiles/granite/marble/ceramic. The process employed is so simple having wide impact of sticking solution as distinguished from the traditional method of sticking.<br>
Keeping in mind the related usefulness, as enumerated hereinabove, of the process and the existing system of sticking solutions available at present, the inventor sees that his newly developed process could create a greater impact in creating a strong grip like solution while fixing glasses/tiles/granites/marbles/ceramics to the wall.<br><br>
It is to be understood that the present inventive process is by no means limited to any particular design.<br>
The present invention will be more readily appreciated in a reading of the "Detailed Description of the Invention" with reference to the drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS:<br>
The invention will now be described with respect to the non-limiting figures in the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
FIG. 1a to 1e: shows perspective view of mould of different shapes .<br>
FIG. 2 shows the mould with the hole at the bottom .<br>
FIG. 3 shows the perspective view of back side of the tile with the mould being fixed to it.<br>
FIG.4 shows the perspective view of back side of the tile with the surface pasted with cement as per the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONS:<br>
The process is defined here in step by step:<br>
1. Making of mould in different size and shapes with a hole at the bottom. A parallel cut is being given from one end to other end at the bottom of the mould. The different colours mould can be made from any materials such as plastic, pvc, rubber, wood and metals etc. The mould can be given any<br><br>
shape such as rectangular, square, triangular, round and oval, beside these five main categories, any shape can be given to mould. The main reason for keeping hole at the bottom is that while applying tiles on the wall on the layer of cement or any other bonding solution, it works like hooks / clips. The cement paste or bonding solution passed through role and when it gets dried a solid hook / clip is automatically created and wall tiles is fixed on the wall permanently.<br>
2.Preparation of adhesive / bonding solution by mixing various chemicals to fix the moulds on the back side of wall tiles a solid bonding solution in the semi paste format is being made by mixing various adhesive chemicals available in the market and keep ready to fix the moulds on the back side of the wall tiles.<br>
3.Fixing of moulds on the backside of wall tiles horizontally or vertically depending upon the size and style of the tiles. The mould is placed on the backside of the wall tiles and then with hydraulic pressure it is fixed. It will take from 15 minutes to 1 hr for the bonding solution to dry. 4.Making back side of wall tiles rough after fixing hooks / clips in the form of various moulds, the various kind of sand, ceramic powder and diff chemicals is being mixed with bonding / adhesive solutions and then sprayed on the back side of the wall tiles with some pressure to make the backside   surface of the wall tiles rough. It will take 15 minutes to 1 hour to dry the mixture depending on the viscosity of the solutions. 5.Each and every tile is being clean with cleaning solution to remove dust, sand,bad patches etc.<br>
6.Finally a layer of approximately 25 mm thickness of cement is applied on the backside of the tiles and then fixed on the wall. While adhering to the process, the cement will pass through the hole of the mould which would produce a lock like grip end when the cements get dried up, a powerful grip is formed to give a permanent sticking effect. In the systematic art, the<br><br>
water and moisture in the atmosphere do not affect the tiles and no harm is caused to the tiles.<br>
When I have described and illustrated particular embodiment of my present invention I do not wish to limit myself to the exact form shown which is indeed to illustrate my invention rather than to limit to it.<br>
It is to be expressly understood that the invention is susceptible to such improvements and modifications, which may be made by any person skilled in the art to suit individual job requirement and any such improvements and modifications so made in the seal here in before described and illustrated shall be considered to be falling within the ambit and scope of this invention and the appended claims.<br><br>
