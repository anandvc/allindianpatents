Field of the Invention<br>
{0001] The invention generally provides methods for gasoline sulfur reduction, using hydrotalcite like compounds and using mixed metal oxide compounds.<br>
[0002] This patent disclosure contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves any and all copyright rights.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0003] Catalytic cracking is a petroleum refining process that is applied commercially on a very large scale. A majority of the refinery gasoline blending pool in the United States is produced by this process, with almost all being produced using the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. In the catalytic cracking process heavy hydrocarbon fractions are converted into lighter products by reactions taking place at elevated temperature in the presence of a catalyst; with the majority of the conversion or cracking occurring in the vapor phase. The feedstock is thereby converted into gasoline, distillate and other liquid cracking products as well as lighter gaseous cracking products of four or less carbon atoms per molecule. The gas partly consists of olefins and partly of saturated hydrocarbons.<br>
[0004] During the cracking reactions some heavy material, known as coke, is deposited onto the catalyst This reduces the activity of the catalyst and regeneration is desired. After removal of occluded hydrocarbons from the spent cracking catalyst, regeneration is accomplished by burning off the coke to restore catalyst activity. The three characteristic steps of the catalytic cracking can be therefore be distinguished: a cracking step in which the hydrocarbons axe converted into lighter products, a stripping step to remove hydrocarbons adsorbed on the catalyst and a regeneration step to burn off coke from the catalyst. The regenerated catalyst is then reused in the cracking step.<br>
[0005] Catalytic cracking feedstocks normally contain sulfur in the form of organic sulfur compounds such as mercaptans, sulfides and thiophenes. The products of the cracking process correspondingly lead lo contain sulfur impurities even though about half of the sulfur is converted to hydrogen sulfide during the cracking process, mainly by catalytic decomposition of non-thiophenic sulfur compounds. The distribution of sulfur in the cracking products is dependent on a number effectors including feed, catalyst type, additives present, conversion and other operating conditions but, in any event a certain proportion of the sulfur tends to enter the light or heavy gasoline fractions and passes over into the product pool. Wiih increasing environmental regulation being applied to petroleum products, for example in the Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) regulations, the sulfur content of the products has generally been decreased in response to concerns about the emissions of sulfur oxides and other sulfur compounds into fee air following combustion processes.<br>
[0006] One approach has been to remove the sulfur from the FCC feed by hydrotreating before cracking is initiated. While highly effective, this approach tends to be expensive in terms of the capital cost of the equipment as well as operationally since hydrogen consumption is high. Another approach can involve post-treating me cracked products, such as gasoline, after ttte FCC process. While this may be effective, this approach has the drawback that valuable product octane may be lost when the high octane olefins are saturated. In yet another approach, an additive for sulfur reduction in the regenerator of an FCC unit can be used to reduce sulfur in gasoline without having to treat either the feed or cracked products.<br>
[0007] Thus, there is a need in (he art for new and improved methods to reduce the sulfur content in gasoline during the FCC process cycle. The invention is directed to this, as well as other, important ends.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0008] The invention provides methods for reducing sulfur in gasoline by adding gasoline sulfur reduction additives comprising hydrotalcite like compounds to an FCC unit The gasoline sulfur reduction additives can optionally further comprise one or more metallic oxidants and/or supports as described herein.<br>

[0063] The gasoline sulfur reduction additives of the invention generally have an attrition of about 4 or less; about 3 or less; about 2.5 or less; about 2.4 or less; about 2.3 or less; about 2.2 or less; about 2.1 or less; about 2 or less; about 1.9 or less; about 1.8 or less; about 1.7 or less; about 1.6 or less; or about 1.5 or less. la other embodiments, the attrition of the gasoline sulfur reduction additives can be about 1.4 or less; about 1.3 or less; about 1.2 or less; about 1.1 or less; or about 1.0 or less. The attrition is measured by the ASTM D5757 memod between the first and second hours or between the first and fifth hours.<br>
[0064] The gasoline sulfur reduction additives of the invention can be added to any conventional reactor-regenerator systems, to ebullating catalyst bed systems, to systems which involve continuously conveying or circulating catalysts/additives between reaction zone and regeneration zone and the like. Circulating bed systems are preferred. Typical of die circulating bed systems are the conventional moving bed and fluidized bed reactor-regenerator systems. Bom of these circulating bed systems are conventionally used in hydrocarbon conversion (e.g., hydrocarbon cracking) operations with the fiuidized catalyst bed reactor-regenerator systems being preferred.<br>
[0065] To reduce the sulfur from gasoline, the additives herein ate introduced into the regenerator and/or reactor of the FCC unit and are continuously cycled between the FCC reactor and the regenerator. The gasoline sulfur reduction additives can be used in an amount of at least 1 ppra; at least 2 ppm; or at least 5 ppm; in an amount of at least about 5% of the inventory of the regenerator; or in an amount of at least about 10% of the inventory of the regenerator.<br>
Examples<br>
(0066] The following examples are for purposes of illustration only and ate not intended to<br>
imit the scope of the appended claims.<br>
Example [0067] Additives A-D were prepared and mixed at a concentration of 20 weight percent with a low metals equilibrium catalyst obtained from a commercial FCC unit The resulting mixture was then run on a commercial laboratory FCC simulation reactor (Kayser Technologies, Inc, Model ACE R+). The resulting liquid product was analyzed on a Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to a HP/Agilent Atomic Emission Detector for quantification of sulfur species. The sulfur content measured was normalized to the total yield of gasoline measured on an Agilent 6890 SIMDIS (manufactured by from Agilent and Separation Systems Inc.). The results of the sulfur reduction analysis and obtained from the Agilent 6890 SIMDIS system are shown in Table 1 below. The percent gasoline sulfur reduction was calculated by comparing the results obtained for each additive composition to a base equilibrium catalyst sample containing no gasoline sulfur additive. In order to minimize the effects of dilution, the base-case equilibrium catalyst sample contained 20% of clay-based microspheres which possessed minimal activity. This base-case sample is shown as Additive Bin Table 1.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 (0068] The sulfur reduction additives as set forth in Tables 1-3 are described below:<br>
Additive A<br>
[0069] Additive A is SUPER SOXGETTER® (commercially available from Intercat, Inc.)<br>
which, is a collapsed hydrotalcite-like compound containing cerium and vanadium as the metallic oxidants and having a magnesium to aluminum ratio of about 4:1. The approximate quantity of cerium and vanadium, represented by its oxide equivalent is 15% CeOj and 4% ViOs, The composition was prepared as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,028,023, using a pseudoboehmite alumina and relatively high surface area magnesium oxide.<br>
Additive B<br>
[0070 J Additive B was prepared by the method described in co-pending patent application U.S. Serial No. 60/527,258 and in U.S. Patent No. 6,028,023, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties, and is a magnesium aluminum mixed metel oxide composition prepared at an atomic ratio of magnesium to aluminum of 4.0. it was prepared using magnesium oxide (Premier Chemical) and pseudoboehmite alumina (Sasol). On a loss free basis, the relative proportions of A1203 andMgO were 24 and 76 weight percent, respectively. Following preparation, the composition was formed into microspheres with a particle size range of about 20 microns to about 200 microns by a spray drying technique. The resulting dried product was calcined at 600°C for one hour.<br>
AdditiyeC<br>
{0071] Additive C was prepared by a process similar to that of Additive A, except that Additive C contained no metallic oxidants. On a loss free basis, the relative proportions of AbOj and MgO were 24 and 76 weight percent, respectively. Following slurry preparation, the composition was formed into microspheres with a particle size range of about 20 microns to about 200 microns by a spray drying technique. The resulting dried product was calcined at 600°C for one hour. Immediately following calcination, the product was fully hydrated using water as the medium. The hydrated product was then collapsed at 600°C for one hour.<br>
AddUJveP<br>
[0072] Additive D was prepared by a process similar .to that of Additive B, except that 10% tangsten oxide was added during the slurry preparation step. On a loss free basis, the relative proportions of AfeOj, MgO and WOj were21.6,68,4 and 10.0 weight percent, respectively.<br>
[0073] As can be seen from the results in Table 1, the hydrotalcite-h'ke and the mixed metal oxide compounds of the invention reduced the concentration of sulfur in the gasoline.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0074] Additives A-D were prepared and mixed at a concentration often weight percent with a low metals equilibrium catalyst obtained from a commercial FCC unit and run on a commercial laboratory FCC simulation reactor (Kayser Technologies, Inc, Model ACE R+) as described in Example 1 above. The total weight of catalyst or catalyst and additive was about nine grams. The ratio of catalyst or catalyst and additive to feedstock oil was about seven. The leactor temperature was maintained at about 990 °F, The resulting gaseous and liquid products were analyzed. The results of this analysis are shown in Tables 2 and 3 below. The hydrotalcite-like and the mixed metal oxide compounds of the invention: reduced bottoms, the liquid product isolated above about 650 0F; increased catalytic conversion, partly due to the decrease in bottoms; increased gaseous product yields as defined by liquefied petroleum gas; increased the overall quantity of gasoline produced; and decreased line amount of ligbt cycle oil isolated between about 430 "F and about 650 °F. The yield shift summaries in Table 3 were calculated by comparing the results obtained for each additive composition to a base equilibrium catalyst sample containing no additive. In order to minimize the effects of dilution, the base-case equilibrium catalyst sample contained 20% of clay-based microspheres which possessed minimal activity. This base-case sample is shown as Additive E in Tables 2 and 3.<br>
