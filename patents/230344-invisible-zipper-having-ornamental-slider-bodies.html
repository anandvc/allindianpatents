				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates gnerally to a zipper more<br>
specifically, to an invisible zipper, which has functional slider<br>
bodies and ornamental slider bodies attached to the teeth chains at<br>
,the back side and exposed to the outside after installation of the<br>
invisible zipper in a product.<br>
(b)	Description of the Prior Art:<br>
Conventional zippers include visible type and invisible type.<br>
The teeth chain may be made of metal, resin, or nylon. Actually,<br>
conventional zippers may be made in any of a variety of forms, for <br>
example, close end, X type O type, and etc.<br>
A conventional zipper of any known type generally comprises<br>
two tapes, two teeth chains, a slider body, pins at the ends of teeth<br>
chains, a top stop, and a bottom stop. The slider body is provided<br>
with a slider pull. Further, the slider body has a center structure<br>
formed of top and bottom covers. During sliding movement of the<br>
slider body, the center structure causes the teeth chains to close or<br>
open. The slider body of a conventional zipper is a functional<br>
element for zipper closing/opening control.<br>
Conventional invisible zippers are commonly used in clothes,<br>
bags, shoes, and various other personal items. Because the teeth<br>
chains are kept on the inside of the product using the zipper, the<br>
teeth chains are kept from sight when the user closed the zipper.<br><br>
and only one linear closing trace is left on the outside of the product.<br>
When installed an invisible zipper in a product (clothes, bag, or shoe)<br>
in the reversed direction and coupled multiple functional slider bodies to<br>
the back side of the invisible zipper as shown in FIG. 20, the functional<br>
slider bodies can be individually moved on the teeth chains and can work<br>
as decorate means to decorate the product. However, because each slider<br>
body has a center structure, a hole is left between the slider body and the<br>
teeth chains. Further, every slider body can be positioned on the teeth<br>
chains in a fixed position, preventing disengagement between the teeth<br>
chains. Therefore, this imaginary design is not workable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OFTHE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 show a nylon zipper embodying to the present invention.<br>
FIGS. 3 and 4 show a metal (resin) zipper embodying the present invention.<br>
The design concept of the present invention is to attach one or a number of<br>
ornamental slider bodies 1 to the teeth chains 3 of the zipper 2 at the<br>
reversed side.<br>
The hollow base of ornamental slider body 1, as shown in<br>
FIG. 5, is an opening hole in the bottom, bridging the teeth chains 3,<br>
having two retaining portions 11 respectively inwardly extended from the<br>
bottom at two sides and a top ring 12 to which a slider pull 13 is connected<br>
for pulling by hand to move the ornamental slider body 1 on the<br>
teeth chains 3.<br>
The zipper 2 can be an invisible nylon zipper as shown in FIGS. 1 and<br>
2, a metal or resin zipper as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. There is no limitation<br>
to the type of the zipper. However, after installation of the zipper 2, the<br>
teeth chains 3 of the zipper 2 must be exposed to the outside for the<br>
bridging of the ornamental slider body 1. The invisible zipper can be a<br>
close end, X type, O type, or any of a variety of other known types (see<br>
FIGS. 6-8). Basically, the invisible zipper 2 comprises two tapes 21, two<br>
teeth chains 31, 32, at least one functional slider body 22, a top stop 24, and<br>
a bottom stop 25. The functional slider body 22 has a center structure 220,<br>
and is provided with a slider pull 221.<br>
The functional slider body 22 and the teeth chains 3 are<br>
attached to the teeth chains 31, 32 at the back side such that the<br><br>
functional slider body 22 and the ornamental slider body 1 are at<br>
the same side on the teeth chains 3 of the zipper 2. By means of the<br>
center structure 220 of the functional slider body 22, the<br>
functional slider body 22 can be moved to close/open the teeth<br>
chains 31, 32. The ornamental slider body 1 does not have such a<br>
center structure, and is bridging the teeth chains 31, 32.<br>
The ornamental slider body 1 is arranged subject to the type of<br>
the invisible zipper 2. In the close end zipper 2 shown in FIG. 6,<br>
the ornamental slider bodies 1 are set between one functional<br>
slider body 22 and the bottom stop 25; in the X type zipper 2<br>
shown in FIG. 7, the ornamental slider bodies 1 are set between<br>
two functional slider bodies 22; in the O type zipper 2 shown in<br>
FIG. 8, the ornamental slider bodies 1 are respectively set between<br>
one functional slider body 22 and the top stop 24 or bottom stop<br>
25.<br>
Each ornamental slider body 1 is provided with a slider pull 13.<br>
Alternatively, each ornamental slider body 1 can be provided with<br>
an ornament 13a. The ornaments 13a can be made from any of a<br>
variety of suitable materials, having any of a variety of shapes,<br>
for example, the shape of a start or crescent moon (see FIG. 9).<br>
FIGS. 9 and 10 show the two reversed sides of a zipper<br>
constructed according to the present invention. When in use, the<br>
back side of the zipper is stitched to the cloth, bag, shoe, or any<br>
of a variety of products, keeping the ornamental slider bodies 1,<br>
the functional slider bodies 22 and the teeth chains 3 exposed to<br>
the outside (the stitching method of fastening the zipper to the<br>
product is same as the conventional techniques to stitch a nylon,<br><br>
metal, or resin zipper to a product). In general, the present<br>
invention uses an invisible zipper and stitch the invisible zipper<br>
to the product reversely with the inside out, keeping the teeth<br>
chains 3, the ornamental slider bodies 1 and the attached<br>
ornaments 13a exposed to the outside of the product to decorate<br>
the product.<br>
According to the present invention, a locking device may be<br>
provided at the top side of each ornamental slider body 1 so that<br>
each ornamental slider body 1 can be moved on the teeth chains 3<br>
freely and then locked to the teeth chains 3 at the desired location.<br>
The aforesaid locking device can be a spring lock or any of a<br>
variety of auto locking designs. FIGS. 11-18 show different<br>
designs of the locking device.<br>
FIGS. 11 and 12 show an ornamental slider body la having a<br>
spring plate type locking device. By means of operating the<br>
attached slider pull 13 or ornament 13a, the free end 511 of the<br>
spring plate 51 is controlled to pass through a hole 14 in the<br>
ornamental slider body la and to engage the teeth chains 3,<br>
thereby locking the ornamental slider body la to the teeth chains<br>
3. When disengaging the free end 511 of the spring plate 51 from<br>
the teeth chains 3, the ornamental slider body la is unlocked and<br>
can be moved on the teeth chains 3.<br>
FIGS. 13 and 14 show an ornamental slider body lb having an<br>
auto locking device. According to this embodiment, the auto<br>
locking device comprises a spur 52, which has the free end 52 1<br>
thereof inserted through a hole 14 in the ornamental slider body<br>
lb and forced into engagement with the teeth chains 3 to lock the<br><br>
ornamental slider body lb to the teeth chains 3. A spring plate 53<br>
is provided to hold down the spur 52, keeping the free end 521 of<br>
the spur 52 in engagement with the teeth chains 3. When pulling<br>
the attached slider pull 13 or ornament 13a, the spur 52 is forced<br>
to disengage the free end 521 from the teeth chains 3 and the hole<br>
14 in the ornamental slider body lb, enabling the ornamental<br>
slider body lb to be moved freely.<br>
FIGS. 15 and 16 show an ornamental slider body 1c having a<br>
spring plate type locking device. Pulling the attached slider pull<br>
13 or ornament 13a controls movement of the free end 541 of a<br>
spring plate 54 through a hole 14 in the ornamental slider body lc<br>
into engagement with the teeth chains 3.<br>
FIGS. 17 and 18 show an ornamental slider body 1d having a<br>
locking device, which comprises a hook 56 and a spring 55<br>
supporting the hook 56. The spring 55 holds the hook 56 in a hole<br>
14	in the ornamental slider body 1d, keeping the free end 561 of<br>
the hook 56 in engagement with the teeth chains. Pulling the<br>
attached slider pull 13 or ornament 13a causes the hook 56 to<br>
disengage the free end 561 from the teeth chains.<br>
A prototype of zipper having ornamental slider bodies has<br>
been constructed with the features of FIGS. 1~19. The zipper<br>
having ornamental slider bodies functions smoothly to provide all<br>
of the features discussed earlier.<br>
Although particular embodiments of the invention have been<br>
described in detail for purposes of illustration, various<br>
modifications and enhancements may be made without departing<br>
from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the<br><br>
aforesaid top ring 12 may be eliminated, and an ornament 15 of<br>
any of a variety of shapes (for example, the ornament 1 5 shown in<br>
FIG. 19 has the shape of a button) may be formed integral with the<br>
