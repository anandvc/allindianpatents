				<td>ANTIBODY FORMULATIONS<br>
This is a non-provisional application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b) claiming priority to provisional<br>
application 60/620,413 filed October 20,2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention concerns antibody formulations, including monoclonal antibodies formulated in<br>
histidine-acetate buffer, as well as a formulation comprising an antibody that binds to domain II of HER2 (for<br>
example, Pertuzumab), and a formulation comprising an antibody that binds to DR5 (for example, Apomab).<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In the past ten years, advances in biotechnology have made it possible to produce a variety of proteins<br>
for pharmaceutical applications using recombinant DNA techniques. Because proteins are larger and more<br>
complex than traditional organic and inorganic drugs (i.e. possessing multiple functional groups in addition to<br>
complex three-dimensional structures), the formulation of such proteins poses special problems. For a protein to<br>
remain biologically active, a formulation must preserve intact the conformational integrity of at least a core<br>
sequence of the protein's amino acids while at the same time protecting the protein's multiple functional groups<br>
from degradation. Degradation pathways for proteins can involve chemical instability (i.e. any process which<br>
involves modification of the protein by bond formation or cleavage resulting in a new chemical entity) or<br>
physical instability (i.e. changes in the higher order structure of the protein). Chemical instability can result<br>
from deamidation, racemization, hydrolysis, oxidation, beta elimination or disulfide exchange. Physical<br>
instability can result from denaturation, aggregation, precipitation or adsorption, for example. The three most<br>
common protein degradation pathways are protein aggregation, deamidation and oxidation. Cleland et al.<br>
Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 10(4): 307-377 (1993).<br>
Antibody Formulations<br>
Included in the proteins used for pharmaceutical applications are antibodies. An example of an<br>
antibody useful for therapy is an antibody which binds to the HER2 antigen, such as Pertuzumab.<br>
US Patent No, 6,339,142 describes a HER2 antibody composition comprising a mixture of anti-HER2<br>
antibody and one or more acidic variants thereof, wherein the amount of the acidic variant(s) is less than about<br>
25%. Trastuzumab is an exemplified HER2 antibody.<br>
US Patent Nos. 6,267,958 and 6,685,940 (Andya et al) describe lyophilized antibody formulations,<br>
including HER2 and IgE antibody formulations. WO97/04807 and US 2004/0197326A1 (Pick et al.) describe<br>
methods for treating allergic asthma with an IgE antibody, WO99/01556 (Lowman et al.) relates to IgE antibody<br>
with aspartyl residues prone to isomerization, and improved variants thereof. US 2002/0045571 (Liu et al.)<br>
provides reduced viscosity concentrated protein formulations, exemplified by humanized JgE antibody<br>
formulations, rhuMAb E25 and E26. WO 02/096457 and US 2004/0170623 (Arvinte et al.) describes stable<br>
liquid formulations comprising anti-IgE antibody E25. See, also, US 2004/0197324 Al (Liu and Shire)<br>
concerning high concentration anti-IgE formulation.<br>
US Patent No. 6,171,586 (Lam et al.) describes stable aqueous antibody formulations. A F(ab')2<br>
rhuMAb CD18 antibody was formulated in sodium acetate and histidine-HCi buffers. The preferred formulation<br>
for rhuMAb CD18 was lOmM sodium acetate, 8% trehalose, 0.01% TWEEN 20™, pH 5.0. Acetate (pH 5,0)<br><br>
formulations of rhuMAb CD20 stored at 40°C for one month demonstrated greater stability than those samples<br>
formulated in histidine (pH 5.0 or 6.0).<br>
US 2003/0190316 (Kakuta et al.) concerns formulated antibody hPM-1, a humanized IL-6 receptor<br>
antibody. Monomer loss was the greatest in sodium citrate (pH 6.7), followed by sodium phosphate (pH 6.8),<br>
Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), histidine-HCl (pH 7.2) and glycine (pH 7.6) in descending order. The effect of phosphate-Na<br>
(pH 6.5), phosphate-His (pH 6.0 or 6.5), His-HCl (pH 6.5), and phosphate-Na (pH 6.0) on the stability of hPM-1<br>
was assessed.<br>
WO2004/071439 (Burke et al.) state that impurities arose in a natalizumab (anti-alpha4 integrin<br>
humanized monoclonal antibody) formulation from the degradation of polysorbate 80, apparently through an<br>
oxidation reaction involving metal ions and hisitidine. Thus, a phosphate buffer was selected.<br>
WO 2000/066160 (English language counterpart EP 1 174 148A1) (Okada et al.) refers to a formulation<br>
of a humanized C4G1 antibody which binds to a fibrinogen receptor of a human platelet membrane glycoprotein<br>
GPIIb/IlIa, in a sodium phosphate or sodium citrate buffer.<br>
WO2004/019861 (Johnson et al.) concerns CDP870, a pegylated anti-TNFa Fab fragment, formulated<br>
at 200mg/ml in 50mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and 125mM sodium chloride.<br>
WO2004/004639 (Nesta, P.) refers to a formulation for huC242-DMl, a tumor-activated immunotoxin,<br>
in a 50mM succinic acid buffer (pH 6.0) and sucrose (5%w/v).<br>
WO03/039485 (Kaisheva et al.) found that Daclizumab (a humanized IL-2 receptor antibody) had the<br>
highest stability in sodium succinate buffer at pH 6.0, and rapidly lost potency in histidine as the buffer oxidized.<br>
WO 2004/001007 concerns a CD80 monoclonal antibody in a histidine HC1, sodium acetate or sodium<br>
citrate buffer.<br>
US Patent No. 6,252,055 (Relton, J.) refers to anti-CD4 and anti-CD23 antibodies formulated in<br>
maleate, succinate, sodium acetate or phosphate buffers, with phosphate being identified as the preferred buffer.<br>
US Patent No. 5,608,038 (Eibl et al.) refers to highly concentrated polyclonal immunoglobulin<br>
preparations with immunoglobulin, glucose or sucrose, and sodium chloride therein.<br>
WO03/015894 (Oliver et al.) refers to an aqueous formulation of lOOmg/mL SYNAG1S®, 25mM<br>
histidine-HCl, 1.6mM glycine, pH 6.0, and a lyophilized SYNAGIS® which when formulated (before<br>
lyophilization) contains 25mM histidine, 1.6mM glycine and 3% w/v mannitol at pH 6.0.<br>
US 2004/0191243 Al (Chen et al.) reports formulation of ABX-IL8, a human lgG2 antibody.<br>
US 2003/0113316 Al (Kaisheva ef a/.) refers to a lyophilized anti-IL2 receptor antibody formulation.<br>
HER2 Antibodies<br>
The HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases are important mediators of cell growth, differentiation and<br>
survival. The receptor family includes four distinct members including epidermal growth factor receptor<br>
(EGFR, ErbBl, or HER1), HER2 (ErbB2 or pl85ne"), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4 or tyro2).<br>
EGFR, encoded by the erbEl gene, has been causally implicated in human malignancy. In particular,<br>
increased expression of EGFR has been observed in breast, bladder, lung, head, neck and stomach cancer as well<br>
as glioblastomas. Increased EGFR receptor expression is often associated with increased production of the<br>
EGFR ligand, transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-a), by the same tumor cells resulting in receptor activation<br>
by an autocrine stimulatory pathway. Baselga and Mendelsohn Pharmac. Ther. 64:127-154 (1994). Monoclonal<br>
antibodies directed against the EGFR or its ligands, TGF-a and EOF, have been evaluated as therapeutic agents<br>
in the treatment of such malignancies. See, e.g., Baselga and Mendelsohn., supra; Masui et al. Cancer Research<br>
44:1002-1007 (1984); and Wu et at. J. Clin. Invest. 95:1897-1905 (1995).<br>
The second member of the HER family, pi85""', was originally identified as the product of the<br>
transforming gene from neuroblastomas of chemically treated rats. The activated form of the neu protooncogene<br>
results from a point mutation (valine to glutamic acid) in the transmembrane region of the encoded<br>
protein. Amplification of the human homolog of neu is observed in breast and ovarian cancers and correlates<br>
with a poor prognosis (Slamon et al., Science, 235:177-182 (1987); Slamon et a!., Science, 244:707-712 (1989);<br>
and US Pat No. 4,968,603). To date, no point mutation analogous to that in the neu proto-oncogene has been<br>
reported for human tumors. Overexpression of HER2 (frequently but not uniformly due to gene amplification)<br>
has also been observed in other carcinomas including carcinomas of the stomach, endometriurn, salivary gland,<br>
lung, kidney, colon, thyroid, pancreas and bladder. See, among others, King et al., Science, 229:974 (1985);<br>

Antibodies directed against the rat pl85"e" and human HER2 protein products have been described.<br>
Drebin and colleagues have raised antibodies against the rat neu gene product, pi 85"™ See, for example, Drebin<br>
et al, Cell 41:695-706 (1985); Myers et al, Meth. Enzym. 198:277-290 (1991); and WO94/22478. Drebin et al<br>
Oncogene 2:273-277 (1988) report that mixtures of antibodies reactive with two distinct regions of pi 85"*" result<br>
in synergistic anti-tumor effects on «eM-transformed N1H-3T3 cells implanted into nude mice. See also U.S.<br>
Patent 5,824,311 issued October 20, 1998.<br>
Hudziak et al, Mol Cell Biol. 9(3): 1165-1172 (1989) describe the generation of a panel of HER2<br>
antibodies which were characterized using the human breast tumor cell line SK-BR-3. Relative cell proliferation<br>
of the SK-BR-3 cells following exposure to the antibodies was determined by crystal violet staining of the<br>
monolayers after 72 hours. Using this assay, maximum inhibition was obtained with the antibody called 4D5<br>
which inhibited cellular proliferation by 56%. Other antibodies in the panel reduced cellular proliferation to a<br>
lesser extent in this assay. The antibody 4D5 was further found to sensitize HER2-overexpressing breast tumor<br>
cell lines to the cytotoxic effects of TNF-a. See also U.S. Patent No. 5,677,171 issued October 14, 1997. The<br>
HER2 antibodies discussed in Hudziak et al are further characterized in Fendly et al Cancer Research 50:1550-<br>

A recombinant humanized version of the murine HER2 antibody 4D5 (huMAb4D5-8, rhuMAb HER2,<br>
Trastuzumab or HERCEPTIN®; U.S. Patent No. 5,821,337) is clinically active in patients with HER2-<br>
overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that have received extensive prior anti-cancer therapy (Baselga el al., J.<br>
din. Oncol. 14:737-744 (1996)). Trastuzumab received marketing approval from the Food and Drug<br>
Administration September 25, 1998 for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors<br>
overexpress the HER2 protein.<br>

Homology screening has resulted in the identification of two other HER receptor family members;<br>
HER3 (US Pat. Nos. 5,183,884 and 5,480,968 as well as Kraus et al. PNAS (USA) 86:9193-9197 (1989)) and<br>
HER4 (EP Pat Appln No 599,274; Plowman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Set. USA, 90:1746-1750 (1993); and<br>
Plowman et al., Nature, 366:473-475 (1993)). Both of these receptors display increased expression on at least<br>
some breast cancer cell lines.<br>
The HER receptors are generally found in various combinations in cells and heterodimerization is<br>
thought to increase the diversity of cellular responses to a variety of HER ligands (Earp et al. Breast Cancer<br>
Research and Treatment 35: 115-132 (1995)). EGFR is bound by six different ligands; epidermal growth factor<br>
(EOF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-a), amphiregulin, heparin binding epidermal growth factor (HBEGF),<br>
betacellulin and epiregulin (Groenen et al. Growth Factors 11:235-257 (1994)). A family of heregulin<br>
proteins resulting from alternative splicing of a single gene are ligands for HER3 and HER4. The heregulin<br>
family includes alpha, beta and gamma heregulins (Holmes et al., Science, 256:1205-1210 (1992); U.S. Patent<br>
No, 5,641,869; and Schaefer et al, Oncogene 15:1385-1394 (1997)); neu differentiation factors (NDFs), glial<br>
growth factors (GGFs); acetylcholine receptor inducing activity (ARIA); and sensory and motor neuron derived<br>
factor (SMDF). For a review, see Groenen et al. Growth Factors 11:235-257 (1994); Lemke, G. Molec. &amp; Cell.<br>
Neurosci. 7:247-262 (1996) and Lee et al. Pharm. Rev. 47:51-85 (1995). Recently three additional HER ligands<br>
were identified; neuregulin-2 (NRG-2) which is reported to bind either HER3 or HER4 (Chang et al. Nature 387<br>
509-512 (1997); and Carraway et al Nature 387:512-516 (1997)); neuregulin-3 which binds HER4 (Zhang et al.<br>
PNAS (USA) 94(18):9562-7 (1997)); and neuregulin-4 which binds HER4 (Harari eta!. Oncogene 18:2681-89<br>
(1999)) HB-EGF, betacellulin and epiregulin also bind to HER4.<br>
While EOF and TGFa do not bind HER2, EGF stimulates EGFR and HER2 to form a heterodimer,<br>
which activates EGFR and results in transphosphorylation of HER2 in the heterodimer. Dimerization and/or<br>
transphosphorylation appears to activate the HER2 tyrosine kinase. See Earp et al., supra. Likewise, when<br>
HER3 is co-expressed with HER2, an active signaling complex is formed and antibodies directed against HER2<br>
are capable of disrupting this complex (Sliwkowski et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269(20): 14661-14665 (1994)).<br>
Additionally, the affinity of HER3 for heregulin (HRG) is increased to a higher affinity state when co-expressed<br>
with HER2. See also, Levi et a!., Journal of Neuroscience 15: 1329-1340 (1995); Morrissey et al., Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 92: 1431-1435 (1995); and Lewis et al., Cancer Res,, 56:1457-1465 (1996) with respect to the<br>
HER2-HER3 protein complex. HER4, like HER3, forms an active signaling complex with HER2 (Carraway and<br>
Cantley, Cell 78:5-8 (1994)).<br>
To target the HER signaling pathway, rhuMAb 2C4 (Pertuzumab, OMNITARG™) was developed as a<br>
humanized antibody that inhibits the dimerization of HER2 with other HER receptors, thereby inhibiting liganddriven<br>
phosphorylation and activation, and downstream activation of the RAS and AKT pathways. In a phase I<br>
trial of Pertuzumab as a single agent for treating solid tumors, 3 subjects with advanced ovarian cancer were<br>
treated with Pertuzumab. One had a durable partial response, and an additional subject had stable disease for 15<br>
weeks Agus et al. Proc Am Soc Clin Oncol 22: 192, Abstract 771 (2003).<br>
DR5 Antibodies<br>
Various ligands and receptors belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily have been<br>
identified in the art. Included among such ligands are tumor necrosis factor-alpha ("TNF-alpha"), tumor necrosis<br>
factor-beta ("TNF-beta" or "lymphotoxin-alpha"), lymphotoxin-beta ("LT-beta"), CD30 ligand, CD27 ligand, CD40<br>
ligand, OX-40 ligand, 4-1BB ligand, LIGHT, Apo-1 ligand (also referred to as Fas ligand or CD95 ligand), Apo-<br>
ligand (also referred to as Apo2L or TRAIL), Apo-3 ligand (also referred to as TWEAK), APRIL, OPG ligand (also<br>
referred to as RANK ligand, ODF, or TRANCE), and TALL-1 (also referred to as BlyS, BAFF or THANK) (See,<br>

Induction of various cellular responses mediated by such TNF family ligands is typically initiated by their<br>
binding to specific cell receptors. Some, but not all, TNF family ligands bind to, and induce various biological<br>
activity through, cell surface "death receptors" to activate caspases, or enzymes that carry out the cell death or<br>
apoptosis pathway (Salvesen et al, Cell, 91:443-446 (1997)). Included among the members of the TNF receptor<br>
superfamily identified to date are TNFR1, TNFR2, TACI, GITR,, CD27, OX-40, CD30, CD40, HVEM, Fas<br>
(also referred to as Apo-1 or CD95), DR4 (also referred to as TRAIL-R1), DR5 (also referred to as Apo-2 or<br>
TRAIL-R2), DcRl, DcR2, osteoprotegerin (OPG), RANK and Apo-3 (also referred to as DR3 or TRAMP).<br>
Most of these TNF receptor family members share the typical structure of cell surface receptors<br>
including extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular regions, while others are found naturally as soluble<br>
proteins lacking a transmembrane and intracellular domain. The extracellular portion of typical TNFRs contains<br>
a repetitive amino acid sequence pattern of multiple cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), starting from the NH2-<br>
terminus.<br>
The ligand referred to as Apo-2L or TRAIL was identified several years ago as a member of the TNF<br>
family of cytokines. (see, e.g., Wiley et al., Immunity, 3:673-682 (1995); Pitti et al., J. Biol. Chem., 271:12697-<br>
12690 (1996); WO 97/01633; WO 97/25428; US Patent 5,763,223 issued June 9, 1998; US Patent 6,284,236<br>
issued September 4, 2001). The full-length native sequence human Apo2L/TRAIL polypeptide is a 281 amino<br>
acid long, Type II transmembrane protein. Some cells can produce a natural soluble form of the polypeptide,<br>
through enzymatic cleavage of the polypeptide's extracellular region (Mariani et al., J. Cell. Biol., 137:221-229<br>
(1997)). Crystallographic studies of soluble forms of Apo2L/TRAIL reveal a homotrimeric structure similar to<br>
the structures of TNF and other related proteins (Hymowitz et al., Molec. Cell, 4:563-571 (1999); Cha et al.,<br>
Immunity, 11:253-261 (1999); Mongkolsapaya et al., Nature Structural Biology, 6:1048 (1999); Hymowitz et al.,<br>
Biochemistry, 39:633-644 (2000)). Apo2L/TRAIL, unlike other TNF family members however, was found to<br>
have a unique structural feature in that three cysteine residues (at position 230 of each subunit in the homotrimer)<br>
together coordinate a zinc atom, and that the zinc binding is important for trimer stability and biological activity.<br>
(Hymowitz et a!., supra; Bodmeref a/., J. Biol. Chem., 275:20632-20637 (2000)).<br>
It has been reported in the literature that Apo2L/TRAIL may piay a role in immune system modulation,<br>
including autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (see, e.g., Thomas et al,, J. Immunol., 161:2195-<br>
2200 (1998); Johnsen et al.. Cytokine, 11:664-672 (1999); Griffith et al, J. Exp. Meet., 189:1343-1353 (1999);<br>
Song et al. J. Exp. Med., 191:1095-1103 (2000)).<br>
Soluble forms of Apo2L/TRAIL have also been reported to induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells,<br>
including colon, lung, breast, prostate, bladder, kidney, ovarian and brain tumors, as well as melanoma, leukemia,<br>
and multiple myeloma (see, e.g., Wiley et al., supra; Pitti et al., supra; US Patent 6,030,945 issued February 29,<br>
2000; US Patent 6,746,668 issued June 8, 2004; Rieger et al., FEBS Letters, 427:124-128 (1998); Ashkenazi et<br>
al., J. Clin. Invest., 104:155-162 (1999); Walczak et al, Nature Med., 5:157-163 (1999); Keane et al, Cancer<br>
Research, 59:734-741 (1999); Mizutani el al., Clin. Cancer Res., 5:2605-2612 (1999); Gazitt, Leukemia,<br>
13:1817-1824 (1999); Yu et al, Cancer Res., 60:2384-2389 (2000); Chinnaiyan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci.,<br>
97:1754-1759 (2000)). In vivo studies in murine tumor models further suggest that Apo2L/TRAIL, alone or in<br>
combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, can exert substantial anti-tumor effects (see, e.g.,<br>
Ashkenazi et al, supra; Walzcak et al, supra; Gliniak et al., Cancer Res., 59:6153-6158 (1999); Chinnaiyan et<br>
al, supra; Roth et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 265:1999 (1999); PCT Application US/00/15512; PCT<br>
Application US/01/23691). In contrast to many types of cancer cells, most normal human cell types appear to be<br>
resistant to apoptosis induction by certain recombinant forms of Apo2L/TRAIL (Ashkenazi et al, supra;<br>
Walzcak et al, supra). Jo et al has reported that a polyhistidine-tagged soluble form of Apo2L/TRAIL induced<br>
apoptosis in vitro in normal isolated human, but not non-human, hepatocytes (Jo et al., Nature Med., 6:564-567<br>
(2000); see also, Nagata, Nature Med., 6:502-503 (2000)). It is believed that certain recombinant Apo2L/TRAIL<br>
preparations may vary in terms of biochemical properties and biological activities on diseased versus normal<br>
cells, depending, for example, on the presence or absence of a tag molecule, zinc content, and % trimer content<br>
(See, Lawrence et al., Nature Med., Letter to the Editor, 7:383-385 (2001); Qin et al., Nature Med., Letter to the<br>
Editor, 7:385-386 (2001)).<br>
Apo2L/TRAIL has been found to bind at least five different receptors. At least two of the receptors<br>
which bind Apo2L/TRAIL contain a functional, cytoplasmic death domain. One such receptor has been referred<br>
to as "DR4" (and alternatively as TR4 or TRA1L-R1) (Pan et al., Science, 276:111-113 (1997); see also<br>
WO98/32856 published July 30, 1998; WO99/37684 published July 29, 1999; WO 00/73349 published<br>

6,342,383 issued January 29,2002).<br>
Another such receptor for Apo2L/TRAIL has been referred to as DR5 (it has also been alternatively<br>
referred to as Apo-2; TRAIL-R or TRAIL-R2, TR6, Tango-63, hAPOS, TR1CK2 or KILLER) (see, e.g.,<br>

2000, US 6,642,358 issued November 4, 2003; IS 6,743,625 issued June 1, 2004). Like DR4, DR5 is reported to<br>
contain a cytoplasmic death domain and be capable of signaling apoptosis upon ligand binding (or upon binding<br>
a molecule, such as an agonist antibody, which mimics the activity of the ligand). The crystal structure of the<br>
complex formed between Apo-2L/TRAIL and DR5 is described in Hymowitz et al, Molecular Cell, 4:563-571<br>
(1999).<br>
Upon ligand binding, both DR4 and DR5 can trigger apoptosis independently by recruiting and<br>
activating the apoptosis initiator, caspase-8, through the death-domain-containing adaptor molecule referred to as<br>
FADD/Mortl (Kischkel et al, Immunity, 12:611-620 (2000); Sprick et al, Immunity, 12:599-609 (2000);<br>
Bodmer et al, Nature Cell Biol, 2:241-243 (2000)).<br>
Apo2L/TRAIL has been reported to also bind those receptors referred to as DcRl, DcR2 and OPG,<br>
which believed to function as inhibitors, rather than transducers of signaling (see., e.g., DcRl (also referred to as<br>
TRID, LIT or TRAIL-R3) (Pan et al, Science, 276:111-113 (1997); Sheridan et al, Science, 277:818-821 (1997);<br>

Degli-Esposti et al, J. Exp. Med., 186:1165-1170 (1997); and Mongkolsapaya et al., J. Immunol, 160:3-6<br>
(1998)); DcR2 (also called TRUNDD or TRAIL-R4) (Marsters et al, Curr. Biol, 7:1003-1006 (1997); Pan et al,<br>
FEBS Letters, 424:41-45 (1998); Degli-Esposti et al, Immunity, 7:813-820 (1997)), and OPG. In contrast to<br>
DR4 and DR5, the DcRl and DcR2 receptors do not signal apoptosis.<br>
Certain antibodies which bind to the DR4 and/or DR5 receptors have been reported in the literature.<br>
For example, anti-DR4 antibodies directed to the DR4 receptor and having agonistic or apoptotic activity in<br>
certain mammalian cells are described in, e.g., WO 99/37684 published July 29, 1999; WO 00/73349 published<br>
July 12,2000; WO 03/066661 published August 14, 2003. See, also, e.g., Griffith et al, J. Immunol., 162:2597-<br>

May 8, 2003. Certain anti-DR5 antibodies have likewise been described, see, e.g., WO 98/51793 published<br>
November 8, 1998; Griffith et al, J. Immune!., 162:2597-2605 (1999); Ichikawa et al, Nature Med, 7:954-960<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
I. Definitions<br>
The term "pharmaceutical formulation" refers to a preparation which is in such form as to permit the<br>
biological activity of the active ingredient to be effective, and which contains no additional components which<br>
are unacceptably toxic to a subject to which the formulation would be administered. Such formulations are<br>
sterile.<br>
A "sterile" formulation is asceptic or free from all living microorganisms and their spores.<br>
Herein, a "frozen" formulation is one at a temperature below 0°C. Generally, the frozen formulation is<br>
not freeze-dried, nor is it subjected to prior, or subsequent, lyophilization. Preferably, the frozen formulation<br>
comprises frozen drug substance for storage (in stainless steel tank) or frozen drug product (in final vial<br>
configuration).<br>
A "stable" formulation is one in which the protein therein essentially retains its physical stability and/or<br>
chemical stability and/or biological activity upon storage. Preferably, the formulation essentially retains its<br>
physical and chemical stability, as well as its biological activity upon storage. The storage period is generally<br>
selected based on the intended shelf-life of the formulation. Various analytical techniques for measuring protein<br>
stability are available in the art and are reviewed in Peptide and Protein Drug Delivery, 247-301, Vincent Lee<br>

(1993), for example. Stability can be measured at a selected temperature for a selected time period. Preferably,<br>
the formulation is stable at about 40°C for at least about 2-4 weeks, and/or stable at about 5°C and/or 15°C for at<br>
least 3 months, and/or stable at about -20°C for at least 3 months or at least 1 year. Furthermore, the formulation<br>
is preferably stable following freezing (to, e.g., -70°C) and thawing of the formulation, for example following 1,<br>
2 or 3 cycles of freezing and thawing. Stability can be evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively in a variety<br>
of different ways, including evaluation of aggregate formation (for example using size exclusion<br>
chromatography, by measuring turbidity, and/or by visual inspection); by assessing charge heterogeneity using<br>
cation exchange chromatography or capillary zone electrophoresis; amino-terminal or carboxy-terminal<br>
sequence analysis; mass spectrometric analysis; SDS-PAGE analysis to compare reduced and intact antibody;<br>
peptide map (for example tryptic or LYS-C) analysis; evaluating biological activity or antigen binding function<br>
of the antibody; etc. Instability may involve any one or more of: aggregation, deamidation (e.g. Asn<br>
deamidation), oxidation (e.g. Met oxidation), isomerization (e.g. Asp isomeriation),<br>
clipping/hydrolysis/fragmentation (e.g. hinge region fragmentation), succinimide formation, unpaired cysteine(s),<br>
N-terminal extension, C-terminal processing, glycosylation differences, etc.<br>
A "deamidated" monoclonal antibody herein is one in which one or more asparagine residue thereof has<br>
been derivitized, e.g. to an aspartic acid or an iso-aspartic acid.<br>
An antibody which is "susceptible to deamidation" is one comprising one or more residue which has<br>
been found to be prone to deamidate.<br>
An antibody which is "susceptible to aggregation" is one which has been found to aggregate with other<br>
antibody molecule(s), especially upon freezing and/or agitation.<br>
An antibody which is "susceptible to fragmentation" is one which has been found to be cleaved into<br>
two or more fragments, for example at a hinge region thereof.<br>

amount of deamidation, aggregation, or fragmentation relative to the monoclonal antibody formulated at a<br>
different pH or in a different buffer.<br>
Herein, "biological activity" of a monoclonal antibody refers to the ability of the antibody to bind to<br>
antigen and result in a measurable biological response which can be measured in vitro or in vivo. Such activity<br>
may be antagonistic (for example where the antibody is a HER2 antibody) or agonistic (for instance where the<br>
antibody binds DR5). In the case of Pertuzumab, in one embodiment, the biological activity refers to the ability<br>
of the formulated antibody to inhibit proliferation of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-175-VII.<br>
Where the antibody is Apomab, the biological activity can refer, for example, to the ability of the formulated<br>
antibody to kill colon carcinoma, Colo205, cells.<br>
By "isotonic" is meant that the formulation of interest has essentially the same osmotic pressure as<br>
human blood. Isotonic formulations will generally have an osmotic pressure from about 250 to 350mOsm.<br>
Isotonicity can be measured using a vapor pressure or ice-freezing type osmometer, for example.<br>
As used herein, "buffer" refers to a buffered solution that resists changes in pH by the action of its acidbase<br>

is a histidine buffer.<br>
A "histidine buffer" is a buffer comprising histidine ions. Examples of histidine buffers include<br>
histidine chloride, histidine acetate, histidine phosphate, histidine sulfate. The preferred histidine buffer<br>
identified in the examples herein was found to be histidine acetate. In the preferred embodiment, the histidine<br>
acetate buffer is prepared by titrating L-histidine (free base, solid) with acetic acid (liquid). Preferably, the<br>
histidine buffer or histidine-acetate buffer is at pH 5.5 to 6.5, preferably pH 5.8 to 6.2.<br>

cripto (CR-1) (Kannan et al. J. Biol. Chem. 272(6):3330-3335 (1997)). HER ligands which bind EGFR include<br>
EOF, TGF-a, amphiregulin, betacellulin, HB-EGF and epiregulin. HER ligands which bind HER3 include<br>
heregulins. HER ligands capable of binding HER4 include betacellulin, epiregulin, HB-EGF, NRG-2, NRG-3,<br>
NRG-4 and heregulins.<br>
"Heregulin" (HRG) when used herein refers to a polypeptide encoded by the heregulin gene product as<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,641,869 or Marchionni et al., Nature, 362:312-318 (1993). Examples of<br>
heregulins include heregulin-a, heregulin-pl, heregulin-|32 and heregulin-p3 (Holmes et al., Science, 256:1205-<br>
1210 (1992); and U.S. Patent No. 5,641,869); neu differentiation factor (NDF) (Peles et al. Cell 69: 205-216<br>

1394 (1997)). The term includes biologically active fragments and/or amino acid sequence variants of a native<br>
sequence HRG polypeptide, such as an EGF-like domain fragment thereof (eg. HRGpl 177.244 )•<br>
A "HER dimer" herein is a noncovalently associated dimer comprising at least two different HER<br>
receptors. Such complexes may form when a cell expressing two or more HER receptors is exposed to an HER<br>
ligand and can be isolated by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described in Sliwkowski et<br>
al.,J. Biol. Ctem,, 269(20): 14661-14665 (1994), for example. Examples of such HER dimers include EGFRHER2,<br>
HER2-HER3 and HER3-HER4 heterodimers. Moreover, the HER dimer may comprise two or more<br>
HER2 receptors combined with a different HER receptor, such as HER3, HER4 or EGFR. Other proteins, such<br>
as a cytokine receptor subunit (e.g. gp!30) may be associated with the dimer.<br>
A "heterodimeric binding site" on HER2, refers to a region in the extracellular domain of HER2 that<br>
contacts, or interfaces with, a region in the extracellular domain of EGFR, HER3 or HER4 upon formation of a<br>
dimer therewith. The region is found in Domain II of HER2. Franklin et al. Cancer Cell 5:317-328 (2004).<br>
"HER activation" or "HER2 activation" refers to activation, or phosphorylation, of any one or more<br>
HER receptors, or HER2 receptors. Generally, HER activation results in signal transduction (e.g. that caused by<br>
an intracellular kinase domain of a HER receptor phosphorylating tyrosine residues in the HER receptor or a<br>
substrate polypeptide). HER activation may be mediated by HER ligand binding to a HER dimer comprising the<br>
HER receptor of interest. HER ligand binding to a HER dimer may activate a kinase domain of one or more of<br>
the HER receptors in the dimer and thereby results in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in one or more of the<br>
HER receptors and/or phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in additional substrate polypeptides(s), such as Akt or<br>
MAPK intracellular kinases.<br>
The term "antibody" herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers full length monoclonal<br>
antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g. bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two<br>
full length antibodies, and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.<br>
The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of<br>
substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical<br>
and/or bind the same epitope, except for possible variants that may arise during production of the monoclonal<br>
antibody, such variants generally being present in minor amounts. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations<br>
that typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal<br>
antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal<br>
antibodies are advantageous in that they are uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier<br>
"monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous<br>
population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular<br>
method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be<br>
made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975), or may be made by<br>
recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No, 4,816,567). The "monoclonal antibodies" may also be<br>
isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628<br>
(1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 (1991), for example.<br>
The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies in which a portion of the<br>
heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from<br>
a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is<br>
identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or<br>
belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit<br>
the desired biological activity (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,<br>
81:6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include "primatized" antibodies comprising<br>
variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g. Old World Monkey, Ape<br>
etc) and human constant region sequences.<br>
"Antibody fragments" comprise a portion of a full length antibody, preferably comprising the antigenbinding<br>
or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments;<br>
diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from<br>
antibody fragment(s).<br>
A "full length antibody" is one which comprises an antigen-binding variable region as well as a light<br>
chain constant domain (CrJ and heavy chain constant domains, CH!, C^2 and €#3. The constant domains may<br>
be native sequence constant domains (e.g. human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence<br>
variants thereof. Preferably, the full length antibody has one or more effector functions.<br>
The term "main species antibody" herein refers to the antibody structure in a composition which is the<br>
quantitatively predominant antibody molecule in the composition. In one embodiment, the main species<br>
antibody is a HER2 antibody, such as an antibody that binds to Domain II of HER2, antibody that inhibits HER<br>
dimerization more effectively than Trastuzumab, and/or an antibody which binds to a heterodimeric binding site<br>
of HER2. The preferred embodiment herein of a main species HER2 antibody is one comprising the variable<br>
light and variable heavy amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4, and most preferably comprising the light<br>
chain and heavy chain amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 15 and 16 (Pertuzumab).<br>
An "amino acid sequence variant" antibody herein is an antibody with an amino acid sequence which<br>
differs from a main species antibody. Ordinarily, amino acid sequence variants will possess at least about 70%<br>
homology with the main species antibody, and preferably, they will be at least about 80%, more preferably at<br>
least about 90% homologous with the main species antibody. The amino acid sequence variants possess<br>
substitutions, deletions, and/or additions at certain positions within or adjacent to the amino acid sequence of the<br>
main species antibody. Examples of amino acid sequence variants herein include acidic variant (e.g. deamidated<br>
antibody variant), basic variant, the antibody with an amino-terminal leader extension (e.g. VHS-) on one or two<br>
light chains thereof, antibody with a C-terminal lysine residue on one or two heavy chains thereof, etc, and<br>
includes combinations of variations to the amino acid sequences of heavy and/or light chains. The antibody<br>
variant of particular interest herein is the antibody comprising an amino-terminal leader extension on one or two<br>
light chains thereof, optionally further comprising other amino acid sequence and/or glycosylation differences<br>
relative to the main species antibody.<br>
A "therapeutic monoclonal antibody" is an antibody used for therapy of a human subject. Therapeutic<br>
monoclonal antibodies disclosed herein include: HER2 antibodies for cancer and various non-malignant diseases<br>
or disorders; CD20 or BR3 antibodies for therapy of B cell malignancies, autoimmune diseases, graft rejection,<br>
or blocking an immune response to a foreign antigen; IgE antibodies for therapy of an IgE-mediated disorder;<br>
DR5 or VEGF antibodies for cancer therapy.<br>
A "glycosylation variant" antibody herein is an antibody with one or more carbohydrate moeities<br>
attached thereto which differ from one or more carbohydate moieties attached to a main species antibody.<br>
Examples of glycosylation variants herein include antibody with a Gl or 02 oligosaccharide structure, instead a<br>
GO oligosaccharide structure, attached to an Fc region thereof, antibody with one or two carbohydrate moieties<br>
attached to one or two light chains thereof, antibody with no carbohydrate attached to one or two heavy chains of<br>
the antibody, etc, and combinations of glycosylation alterations.<br>
Where the antibody has an Fc region, an oligosaccharide structure such as that shown in Fig. 16 herein<br>
may be attached to one or two heavy chains of the antibody, e.g. at residue 299 (298, Eu numbering of residues).<br>
For Pertuzumab, GO was the predominant oligosaccharide structure, with other oligosaccharide structures such<br>
as GO-F, G-l, Man5, Man6, Gl-1, Gl(l-6), Gl(l-3) and G2 being found in lesser amounts in the Pertuzumab<br>
composition.<br>
Unless indicated otherwise, a "Gl oligosaccharide structure" herein includes G-l, Gl-1, Gl(l-6) and<br>
Gl(l-3) structures.<br>
An "amino-terminal leader extension" herein refers to one or more amino acid residues of the aminoterminal<br>
leader sequence that are present at the amino-terminus of any one or more heavy or light chains of an<br>
antibody. An exemplary amino-terminal leader extension comprises or consists of three amino acid residues,<br>
VHS, present on one or both light chains of an antibody variant.<br>
"Homology" is defined as the percentage of residues in the amino acid sequence variant that are<br>
identical after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent<br>
homology. Methods and computer programs for the alignment are well known in the art. One such computer<br>
program is "Align 2", authored by Genentech, Inc., which was filed with user documentation in the United States<br>
Copyright Office, Washington, DC 20559, on December 10, 1991.<br>
Antibody "effector functions" refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native<br>
sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector<br>
functions include Clq binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent<br>
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor;<br>
BCR), etc.<br>
Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, full length<br>
antibodies can be assigned to different "classes". There are five major classes of full length antibodies: IgA, IgD,<br>
IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into "subclasses" (isotypes), e.g., IgGl, IgG2,<br>
IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of<br>
antibodies are called a, 5, e, j, and n, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations<br>
of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.<br>
"Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity" and "ADCC" refer to a cell-mediated reaction in<br>
which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc receptors (FcRs) (e.g. Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils,<br>
and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. The<br>
primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcyRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcyRI, FcyRII<br>
and FcyRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells in summarized is Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet,<br>
Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC<br>
assay, such as that described in US Patent No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 may be performed. Useful effector cells<br>
for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively,<br>
or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such<br>
as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS (USA) 95:652-656 (1998).<br>
"Human effector cells" are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions.<br>
Preferably, the cells express at least FcyRIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human<br>
leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells,<br>
monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils; with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may<br>
be isolated from a native source thereof, e.g. from blood or PBMCs as described herein.<br>
The terms "Fc receptor" or "FcR" are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an<br>
antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an<br>
IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcyRI, FcyRII, and Fey Rill subclasses,<br>
including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors, FcyRII receptors include FcyRUA<br>
(an "activating receptor") and FcyRIIB (an "inhibiting receptor"), which have similar amino acid sequences that<br>
differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcyRIIA contains an immunoreceptor<br>
tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor FcyRIIB contains an<br>
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain, (see review M. in DaSron,<br>
Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997)). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-<br>
92(1991);Capele<a immunomethods and de haas et al. j. lab. cjin. med.></a>
(1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term "FcR" herein.<br>
he term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the<br>
fetus (Guyer et al, J, Immunol. 117:587 (1976) and Kim el ai, J. ImmunoL 24:249 (1994)).<br>
"Complement dependent cytotoxicity" or "CDC" refers to the ability of a molecule to lyse a target in<br>
the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first<br>
component of the complement system (Clq) to a molecule (e.g. an antibody) complexed with a cognate antigen.<br>
To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol.<br>
Methods 202:163 (1996), may be performed.<br>
"Native antibodies" are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of<br>
two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by<br>
one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different<br>
immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges.<br>
Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (Vj-[) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light<br>
chain has a variable domain at one end (VjJ and a constant domain at its other end. The constant domain of the<br>
light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light-chain variable domain is<br>
aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an<br>
interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.<br>
The term "variable" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in<br>
sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its<br>
particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of<br>
antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the<br>
heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the<br>
framework regions (FRs). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs,<br>
largely adopting a p-sheet configuration, connected by three hypervariable regions, which form loops connecting,<br>
and in some cases forming part of, the [3-sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held<br>
together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the hypervariable regions from the other chain, contribute to the<br>
formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological<br>
Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)). The constant<br>
domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions,<br>
such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),<br>
The term "hypervariable region" when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody<br>
which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues<br>
from a "complementarity determining region" or "CDR" (e.g. residues 24-34 (LI), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in<br>
the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (HI), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain;<br>
Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes<br>
of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)) and/or those residues from a "hypervariable loop" (e.g. residues 26-32 (LI),<br>
50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (HI), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the<br>
heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk J. Mo!. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). "Framework Region" or<br>
"FR" residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.<br>
Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called "Fab"<br>
fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual "Fc" fragment, whose name reflects its ability<br>
to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab')2 fragment that has two antigen-binding sites and is still<br>
capable of cross-linking antigen.<br>
"Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and antigenbinding<br>
site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy chain and one light chain variable domain in tight,<br>
non-covalent association. It is in this configuration that the three hypervariable regions of each variable domain<br>
interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six hypervariable<br>
regions confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of<br>
an Fv comprising only three hypervariable regions specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind<br>
antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.<br>
The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain<br>
(CHI) of the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the<br>
carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CHI domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge<br>
region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab1 in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear<br>
at least one free thiol group. F(ab')2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments<br>
which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.<br>
The "light chains" of antibodies from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly<br>
distinct types, called kappa (K) and lambda (X), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.<br>
"Single-chain Fv" or "scFv" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein<br>
these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a<br>
polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for<br>
antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pliickthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 1 13,<br>
Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer- Verlag, New York, pp. 269-3 15 (1994). HER2 antibody scFv fragments<br>
are described in W093/16185; U.S. Patent No. 5,571,894; and U.S. Patent No. 5,587,458.<br>
The term "diabodies" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which<br>
fragments comprise a variable heavy domain (VH) connected to a variable light domain (VL) in the same<br>
polypeptide chain (VH - VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the<br>
same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two<br>
antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/1 1 161; and<br>
HollingereM/., Proc. Nad. Acad Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993).<br>
"Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain<br>
minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are<br>
human immunogiobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are<br>
replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat,<br>
rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework<br>
region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues.<br>
Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the<br>
donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the<br>
humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which<br>
all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or<br>
substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally<br>
also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human<br>
immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et a/., Nature 321 -.522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al, Nature<br>
332:323-329 (1988); andPresta, Curr, Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596(1992).<br>
Humanized HER2 antibodies include huMAb4D5-l, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4,<br>
huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 and huMAb4D5-8 or Trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN®) as described<br>
in Table 3 of U.S. Patent 5,821,337 expressly incorporated herein by reference; humanized 520C9<br>
(W093/21319) and humanized 2C4 antibodies as described herein.<br>
For the purposes herein, "Trastuzumab," "HERCEPTIN®," and "huMAb4D5-8" refer to an antibody<br>
comprising the light and heavy chain amino acid sequences in SEQ ID NOS. 13 and 14, respectively.<br>
Herein, "Pertuzumab," "rhuMAb 2C4," and "OMNITARG™" refer to an antibody comprising the<br>
variable light and variable heavy amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4, respectfully. Where<br>
Pertuzumab is a full length antibody, it preferably comprises the light chain and heavy chain amino acid<br>
sequences in SEQ ID NOS. 15 and 16, respectively.<br>
A "naked antibody" is an antibody (as herein defined) that is not conjugated to a heterologous molecule,<br>
such as a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.<br>
An "affinity matured" antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more hypervariable<br>
regions thereof which result an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent<br>
antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar<br>
or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures<br>
known in the art. Marks el a!. Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL<br>
domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or framework residues is described by: Barbas et al. Proc<br>
Nat. Acad. Sci, USA 91:3809-3813 (1994); Schiere/a/, Gene 169:147-155 (1995); Ydtonelal. J. Immunol.<br>
155:1994-2004(1995); Jackson eta/., J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins era/, J. Mol. Biol.<br>
226:889-896(1992).<br>
An "agonist antibody" is an antibody which binds to and activates a receptor. Generally, the receptor<br>
activation capability of the agonist antibody will be at least qualitatively similar (and may be essentially<br>
quantitatively similar) to a native agonist ligand of the receptor. An example of an agonist antibody is one which<br>
binds to a receptor in the TNF receptor superfamily, such as DR5, and induces apoptosis of cells expressing the<br>
TNF receptor (e.g. DR5). Assays for determining induction of apoptosis are described in WO98/51793 and<br>
WO99/37684, both of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
An "isolated" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a<br>
component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which<br>
would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and<br>
other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to<br>
greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than<br>
99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid<br>
sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or<br>
nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the<br>
antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will<br>
not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.<br>
A HER2 antibody which "inhibits HER dimerization more effectively than Trastuzumab" is one which<br>
reduces or eliminates HER dimers more effectively (for example at least about 2-fold more effectively) than<br>
Trastuzumab. Preferably, such an antibody inhibits HER2 dimerization at least about as effectively as an<br>
antibody selected from the group consisting of murine monoclonal antibody 2C4, a Fab fragment of murine<br>
monoclonal antibody 2C4, Pertuzumab, and a Fab fragment of Pertuzumab. One can evaluate HER<br>
dimerization inhibition by studying HER dimers directly, or by evaluating HER activation, or downstream<br>
signaling, which results from HER dimerization, and/or by evaluating the antibody-HER2 binding site, etc.<br>
Assays for screening for antibodies with the ability to inhibit HER dimerization more effectively than<br>
Trastuzumab are described in Agus el al. Cancer Cell 2:127-137 (2002) and WO01/00245 (Adams et al). By<br>
way of example only, one may assay for inhibition of HER dimerization by assessing, for example, inhibition of<br>
HER dimer formation (see, e.g., Fig. 1A-B of Agus et al. Cancer Cell 2: 127-137 (2002); and WO01/00245);<br>
reduction in HER ligand activation of cells which express HER dimers (WO01/00245and Fig. 2A-B of Agus et<br>
al. Cancer Cell 2: 127-137 (2002), for example); blocking of HER ligand binding to cells which express HER<br>
dimers (WO01/00245, and Fig. 2E of Agus et al. Cancer Cell 2: 127-137 (2002), for example); cell growth<br>
inhibition of cancer cells (e.g. MCF7, MDA-MD-134, ZR-75-1, MD-MB-175, T-47D cells) which express HER<br>
dimers in the presence (or absence) of HER ligand (WO01/00245and Figs. 3A-D of Agus et al. Cancer Cell 2:<br>
127-137 (2002), for instance); inhibition of downstream signaling (for instance, inhibition of HRG-dependent<br>
AKT phosphorylation or inhibition of HRG- or TGFa- dependent MAPK phosphorylation) (see, WO01/00245,<br>
and Fig. 2C-D of Agus et al. Cancer Cell 2: 127-137 (2002), for example). One may also assess whether the<br>
antibody inhibits HER dimerization by studying the antibody-HER2 binding site, for instance, by evaluating a<br>
structure or model, such as a crystal structure, of the antibody bound to HER2 (See, for example, Franklin et al.<br>
Cancer Cell 5:317-328 (2004)).<br>
The HER2 antibody may "inhibit HRG-dependent AKT phosphorylation" and/or inhibit "HRG- or<br>
TGFa-dependent MAPK phosphorylation" more effectively (for instance at least 2-fold more effectively) than<br>
Trastuzumab (see Agus et al. Cancer Cell 2: 127-137 (2002) and WO01/00245, by way of example).<br>
The HER2 antibody may be one which does "not inhibit HER2 ectodomain cleavage" (Molina et al.<br>
Cancer Res. 61:4744-4749(2001).<br>
A HER2 antibody that "binds to a heterodimeric binding site" of HER2, binds to residues in domain II<br>
(and optionally also binds to residues in other of the domains of the HER2 extracellular domain, such as domains<br>
I and 111), and can sterically hinder, at least to some extent, formation of a HER2-EGFR, HER2-HER3, or<br>
HER2-HER4 heterodimer. Franklin et al. Cancer Cell 5:317-328 (2004) characterize the HER2-Pertuzumab<br>
crystal structure, deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (ID Code IS78), illustrating an exemplary<br>
antibody that binds to the heterodimeric binding site of HER2.<br>
An antibody that "binds to domain II" of HER2 binds to residues in domain II and optionally residues<br>
in other domain(s) of HER2, such as domains I and III. Preferably the antibody that binds to domain II binds to<br>
the junction between domains I, II and III of HER2.<br>
A "growth inhibitory agent" when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits<br>
growth of a cell, especially a HER expressing cancer cell either in vitro or in vivo. Thus, the growth inhibitory<br>
agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of HER expressing cells in S phase. Examples of<br>
growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression (at a place other than S phase), such as<br>
agents that induce Gl arrest and M-phase arrest. Classical M-phase blockers include the vincas (vincristine and<br>
vinblastine), taxanes, and topo II inhibitors such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, etoposide, and<br>
bleomycin. Those agents that arrest Gl also spill over into S-phase arrest, for example, DNA alkylating agents<br>
such as tamoxifen, prednisone, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, cisplatin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and ara-C.<br>
Further information can be found in The Molecular Basis of Cancer, Mendelsohn and Israel, eds., Chapter 1,<br>
entitled "Cell cycle regulation, oncogenes, and antineoplastic drugs" by Murakami et al. (WB Saunders:<br>
Philadelphia, 1995), especially p. 13.<br>
Examples of "growth inhibitory" antibodies are those which bind to HER2 and inhibit the growth of<br>
cancer cells overexpressing HER2. Preferred growth inhibitory HER2 antibodies inhibit growth of SK-BR-3<br>
breast tumor cells in cell culture by greater than 20%, and preferably greater than 50% (e.g. from about 50% to<br>
about 100%) at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 ug/ml, where the growth inhibition is determined<br>
six days after exposure of the SK-BR-3 cells to the antibody (see U.S. Patent No. 5,677,171 issued October 14,<br>
1997). The SK-BR-3 cell growth inhibition assay is described in more detail in that patent and hereinbelow.<br>
The preferred growth inhibitory antibody is a humanized variant of murine monoclonal antibody 4D5, e.g.,<br>
Trastuzumab.<br>
An antibody which "induces apoptosis" is one which induces programmed cell death as determined by<br>
binding of annexin V, fragmentation of DNA, cell shrinkage, dilation of endoplasmic reticulum, cell<br>
fragmentation, and/or formation of membrane vesicles (called apoptotic bodies). The cell is usually one which<br>
expresses the antigen to which the antibody binds. Preferably the cell is a tumor cell. For example, phosphatidyl<br>
serine (PS) translocation can be measured by annexin binding; DNA fragmentation can be evaluated through<br>
DNA laddering; and nuclear/chromatin condensation along with DNA fragmentation can be evaluated by any<br>
increase in hypodiploid cells. Preferably, the antibody which induces apoptosis is one which results in about 2 to<br>
50 fold, preferably about 5 to 50 fold, and most preferably about 10 to 50 fold, induction of annexin binding<br>
relative to untreated cell in an annexin binding assay using cells that express an antigen to which the antibody<br>
binds. Examples of antibodies that induce apoptosis are HER2 antibodies 7C2 and 7F3, and certain DR5<br>
antibodies.<br>
The "epitope 2C4" is the region in the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the antibody 2C4 binds.<br>
In order to screen for antibodies which bind to the 2C4 epitope, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that<br>
described in Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane<br>
(1988), can be performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to assess whether the antibody<br>
binds to the 2C4 epitope of HER2. Epitope 2C4 comprises residues from domain II in the extracellular domain<br>
of HER2. 2C4 and Pertuzumab bind to the extracellular domain of HER2 at the junction of domains I, II and III.<br>
Franklin et al. Cancer Cell 5:317-328 (2004).<br>
The "epitope 4D5" is the region in the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the antibody 4D5 (ATCC<br>
CRL 10463) and Trastuzumab bind. This epitope is close to the transmembrane domain of HER2, and within<br>
Domain IV of HER2. To screen for antibodies which bind to the 4D5 epitope, a routine cross-blocking assay<br>
such as that described in Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and<br>
David Lane (1988), can be performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to assess whether the<br>
antibody binds to the 4D5 epitope of HER2 (e.g. any one or more residues in the region from about residue 529<br>
to about residue 625, inclusive, of HER2).<br>
The "epitope 7C2/7F3" is the region at the amino terminus, within Domain I, of the extracellular<br>
domain of HER2 to which the 7C2 and/or 7F3 antibodies (each deposited with the ATCC, see below) bind. To<br>
screen for antibodies which bind to the 7C2/7F3 epitope, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in<br>
Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be<br>
performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to establish whether the antibody binds to the<br>
7C2/7F3 epitope on HER2 (e.g. any one or more of residues in the region from about residue 22 to about residue<br>
53 of HER2).<br>
"Treatment" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in<br>
need of treatment include those already with the disease as well as those in which the disease is to be prevented.<br>
Hence, the patient to be treated herein may have been diagnosed as having the disease or may be predisposed or<br>
susceptible to the disease.<br>
The terms "cancer" and "cancerous" refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is<br>
typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to,<br>
carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma (including medulloblastoma and retinoblastoma), sarcoma (including<br>
liposarcoma and synovial cell sarcoma), neuroendocrine tumors (including carcinoid tumors, gastrinoma,and<br>
islet cell cancer), mesothelioma, schwannoma (including acoustic neuroma), meningioma, adenocarcinoma,<br>
melanoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include<br>
squamous cell cancer (e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, nonsmall<br>
cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the<br>
peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer,<br>
glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer,<br>
rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal<br>
cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma,<br>
testicular cancer, esophagael cancer, tumors of the biliary tract, as well as head and neck cancer.<br>
The term "effective amount" refers to an amount of a drug effective to a disease in the patient. Where<br>
the disease is cancer, the effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor<br>
size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit<br>
(i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or<br>
relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may<br>
prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. The effective amount may<br>
extend progression free survival, result in an objective response (including a partial response, PR, or complete<br>
response, CR), increase overall survival time, and/or improve one or more symptoms of cancer.<br>
A "HER2-expressing cancer" is one comprising cells which have HER2 protein present at their cell<br>
surface.<br>
A cancer which "overexpresses" a HER receptor is one which has significantly higher levels of a HER<br>
receptor, such as HER2, at the cell surface thereof, compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type.<br>
Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. HER<br>
receptor overexpression may be determined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay by evaluating increased levels of<br>
the HER protein present on the surface of a cell (e.g. via an immunohistochemistry assay; IHC). Alternatively,<br>
or additionally, one may measure levels of HER-encoding nucleic acid in the cell, e.g. via fluorescent in situ<br>
hybridization (FISH; see WO98/45479 published October, 1998), southern blotting, or polymerase chain<br>
reaction (PCR) techniques, such as real time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR). One may also study HER receptor<br>
overexpression by measuring shed antigen (e.g., HER extracellular domain) in a biological fluid such as serum<br>
(see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,933,294 issued June 12,1990; WO91/05264 published April 18, 1991; U.S. Patent<br>
5,401,638 issued March 28, 1995; and Sias et al. J. ImmunoL Methods 132: 73-80 (1990)). Aside from the<br>
above assays, various in vivo assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example, one may expose cells<br>
within the body of the patient to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label, e.g. a<br>
radioactive isotope, and binding of the antibody to cells in the patient can be evaluated, e.g. by external scanning<br>
for radioactivity or by analyzing a biopsy taken from a patient previously exposed to the antibody.<br>
Conversely, a cancer which "does not overexpress HER2 receptor" is one which does not express<br>
higher than normal levels of HER2 receptor compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type.<br>
A cancer which "overexpresses" a HER ligand is one which produces significantly higher levels of that<br>
ligand compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene<br>
amplification or by increased transcription or translation. Overexpression of the HER ligand may be determined<br>
diagnostically by evaluating levels of the ligand (or nucleic acid encoding it) in the patient, e.g. in a tumor<br>
biopsy or by various diagnostic assays such as the IHC, FISH, southern blotting, PCR or in vivo assays described<br>
above.<br>
The term "cytotoxic agent" as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of<br>
cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g. At ,[ ,<br>
125 90 186 188 153 212 32<br>
I , Y , Re ,Re , Sm , Bi ,P and radioactive isotopes of Lu),chemotherapeutic agents, and<br>
toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin,<br>
including fragments and/or variants thereof.<br>

The "tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily" or "TNF receptor superfamily" herein refers to<br>
receptor polypeptides bound by cytokines in the TNF family. Generally, these receptors are Type I<br>
transmembrane receptors with one or more cysteine rich repeat sequences in their extracellular domain. The<br>
TNF receptor superfamily may be further subdivided into (1) death receptors; (2) decoy receptors; and (3)<br>
signaling receptors that lack death domains. The "death receptors" contain in their cytoplasmic or intracellular<br>
region a "death domain", i.e., a region or sequence which acts to transduce signals in the cell which can result in<br>
apoptosis or in induction of certain genes. The "decoy receptors" lack a functional death domain and are<br>
incapable of transducing signals which result in apoptosis. Examples of cytokines in the TNF gene family<br>
include Tumor Necrosis Factor- alpha (TNF-alpha), Tumor Necrosis Factor-beta (TNF-beta or lymphotoxin),<br>
CD30 ligand, CD27 ligand, CD40 ligand, OX-40 ligand, 4-1BB ligand, Apo-1 ligand (also referred to as Fas<br>
ligand or CD95 ligand), Apo-2 ligand (also referred to as TRAIL), Apo-3 ligand (also referred to as TWEAK),<br>
osteoprotegerin (OPG), APRIL, RANK ligand (also referred to as TRANCE), and TALL-1 (also referred to as<br>
BlyS, BAFF or THANK). Examples of receptors in the TNF receptor superfamily include: type 1 Tumor<br>
Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR1), type 2 Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR2), p75 Nerve Growth Factor<br>
receptor (NGFR), the B cell surface antigen CD40, the T cell antigen OX-40, Apo-1 receptor (also called Fas or<br>
CD95), Apo-3 receptor (also called DR3, swl-1, TRAMP and LARD), the receptor called "Transmembrane<br>
Activator and CAML-Interactor" or "TACI", BCMA protein, DR4, DR5 (alternatively referred to as Apo-2;<br>
TRAIL-R2, TR6, Tango-63, hAPOS, TRICK2 or KILLER), DR6, DcRl (also referred to as TRID, LIT or<br>
TRAIL-R3), DcR2 (also called TRAIL-R4 or TRUNDD), OPG, DcR3 (also called TR6 or M68), CAR1, HVEM<br>
(also called ATAR or TR2), GITR, ZTNFR-5, NTR-1, TNFL1, CD30, Lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTBr), 4-<br>
1BB receptor and TR9 (EP988, 371A1).<br>
The terms "Apo-2 ligand", "Apo-2L", "Apo2L", Apo-2 ligand/TRAIL" and "TRAIL" are used herein<br>
interchangeably to refer to a polypeptide sequence which includes amino acid residues 114-281, inclusive, 95-<br>
281, inclusive, residues 92-281, inclusive, residues 91-281, inclusive, residues 41-281, inclusive, residues 39-<br>
281, inclusive, residues 15-281, inclusive, or residues 1-281, inclusive, of the amino acid sequence shown in Fig.<br>
24 (SEQ ID No. 46), as well as biologically active fragments, deletional, insertional, and/or substitutional<br>
variants of the above sequences. In one embodiment, the polypeptide sequence comprises residues 114-281 of<br>
Fig. 24 (SEQ ID No. 46). Optionally, the polypeptide sequence comprises residues 92-281 or residues 91-281 of<br>
Fig. 24 (SEQ ID No. 46). The Apo-2L polypeptides may be encoded by the native nucleotide sequence shown<br>
in Fig. 24 (SEQ ID No. 45). Optionally, the codon which encodes residue Prol 19 (Fig. 24; SEQ ID No. 45) may<br>
be "CCT" or "CCG". Optionally, the fragments or variants are biologically active and have at least about 80%<br>
amino acid sequence identity, or at least about 90% sequence identity, or at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%<br>
sequence identity with any one of the above sequences. The definition encompasses substitutional variants of<br>
Apo-2 ligand in which at least one of its native amino acids are substituted by another amino acid such as an<br>
alanine residue. The definition also encompasses a native sequence Apo-2 ligand isolated from an Apo-2 ligand<br>
source or prepared by recombinant and/or synthetic methods. The Apo-2 ligand of the invention includes the<br>
polypeptides referred to as Apo-2 ligand or TRAIL disclosed in WO97/01633 published January 16,1997,<br>
W097/25428 published July 17,1997, WO99/36535 published July 22,1999, WO 01/00832 published January<br>

Patent No. 6,030,945 issued February 29,2000. The terms are used to refer generally to forms of the Apo-2<br>
ligand which include monomer, dimer, trimer, hexamer or hight oligomer forms of the polypeptide. All<br>
numbering of amino acid residues referred to in the Apo-2L sequence use the numbering according to Fig. 24<br>
(SEQ ID No. 46), unless specifically stated otherwise.<br>
"Apo-2 ligand receptor" includes the receptors referred to in the art as "DR4" and "DR5." Pan et al.<br>
have described the TNF receptor family member referred to as "DR4" (Pan et al., Science, 276:111-113 (1997);<br>

277:815-818 (1997) described another receptor for Apo2L/TRAIL (see also, WO98/51793 published November<br>
19,1998; WO98/41629 published September 24,1998). This receptor is referred to as DR5 (the receptor has<br>
also been alternatively referred to as Apo-2; TRAIL-R, TR6, Tango-63, hAPOS, TRICK2 or KILLER; Screaton<br>

June 6,2000, US 6,642,358 issued November 4, 2003). As described above, other receptors for Apo-2L include<br>
DcRl, DcR2, and OPG. The term "Apo-2L receptor" when used herein encompasses native sequence receptor<br>
and receptor variants. These terms encompass Apo-2L receptor expressed in a variety of mammals, including<br>
humans. Apo-2L receptor may be endogenously expressed as occurs naturally in a variety of human tissue<br>
lineages, or may be expressed by recombinant or synthetic methods. A "native sequence Apo-2L receptor"<br>
comprises a polypeptide having the same amino acid sequence as an Apo-2L receptor derived from nature. Thus,<br>
a native sequence Apo-2L receptor can have the amino acid sequence of naturally-occurring Apo-2L receptor<br>
from any mammal, including humans. Such native sequence Apo-2L receptor can be isolated from nature or can<br>
be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. The term "native sequence Apo-2L receptor" specifically<br>
encompasses naturally-occurring truncated or secreted forms of the receptor (e.g., a soluble form containing, for<br>
instance, an extracellular domain sequence), naturally-occurring variant forms (e.g., alternatively spliced forms)<br>
and naturally-occurring allelic variants. Receptor variants may include fragments or deletion mutants of the<br>
native sequence Apo-2L receptor. Figs. 25A-C show the 411 amino acid sequence of human DR5 receptor,<br>
along with its nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID Nos. 47 and 48) as published in WO 98/51793 on November 19,<br>
1998. A transcriptional splice variant of human DR5 receptor is known in the art. This splice variant encodes<br>
the 440 amino acid sequence of human DR5 receptor as shown in Figs. 26A-C, along with its nucleotide<br>
sequence (SEQ ID Nos. 49 and 50), and as published in WO 98/35986 on August 20, 1998.<br>
"Death receptor antibody" is used herein to refer generally to antibody or antibodies directed to a<br>
receptor in the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and containing a death domain capable of signalling<br>
apoptosis, and such antibodies include DR5 antibody and DR4 antibody.<br>
"DR5 receptor antibody", "DR5 antibody", or "anti-DR5 antibody" is used in a broad sense to refer to<br>
antibodies that bind to at least one form of a DR5 receptor or extracellular domain thereof. Optionally the DR5<br>
antibody is fused or linked to a heterologous sequence or molecule. Preferably the heterologous sequence allows<br>
or assists the antibody to form higher order or oligomeric complexes. Optionally, the DR5 antibody binds to<br>
DR5 receptor but does not bind or cross-react with any additional Apo-2L receptor (e.g. DR4, DcRl, or DcR2).<br>
Optionally the antibody is an agonist of DR5 signalling activity.<br>
Optionally, the DR5 antibody of the invention binds to a DR5 receptor at a concentration range of about<br>
0.1 nM to about 20 mM as measured in a BIAcore binding assay. Optionally, the DR5 antibodies of the<br>
invention exhibit an IC50 value of about 0.6 nM to about 18 mM as measured in a BIAcore binding assay.<br>
Purely for the purposes herein, the term "Apomab" refers to an agonist antibody which binds to DR5<br>
and comprises the variable heavy and variable light amino acid sequences of SEQ ID Nos. 55 and 56. Preferably<br>
Apomab comprises the heavy and light chains of SEQ ID Nos. 51 and 52, respectively.<br>
II. Production of Antibodies<br>
Techniques for producing antibodies which can be formulated according to the present invention follow.<br>
(i) Antigen selection and preparation<br>
Preferably, the antigen to which the antibody binds is a biologically important glycoprotein and<br>
administration of the antibody to a mammal suffering from a disease or disorder can result in a therapeutic<br>
benefit in that mammal. However, antibodies directed against nonpolypeptide antigens (such as tumor-associated<br>
glycolipid antigens; see US Patent 5,091,178) are also contemplated.<br>

as a growth factor. Exemplary antigens include molecules such as renin; a growth hormone, including human<br>
growth hormone and bovine growth hormone; growth hormone releasing factor; parathyroid hormone; thyroid<br>

rheumatoid factors; a neurotrophic factor such as bone-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3, -4, -<br>
5, or -6 (NT-3, NT-4, NT-5, or NT-6), or a nerve growth factor such as NGF-b; platelet-derived growth factor<br>
(PDGF); fibroblast growth factor such as aFGF and bFGF; epidermal growth factor (EGF); transforming growth<br>
factor (TGF) such as TGF-alpha and TGF-beta, including TGF-bl, TGF-b2, TGF-b3, TGF-b4, or TGF-b5; a<br>
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) such as TNF-alpha or TNF-beta; insulin-like growth factor-I and -II (IGF-I and<br>
IGF-II); des(l-3)-IGF-I (brain IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor binding proteins; CD proteins such as CDS,<br>

factors (CSFs), e.g., M-CSF, GM-CSF, and G-CSF; interleukins (ILs), e.g., IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6,<br>
IL-7, IL-8, IL-9 and IL-10; superoxide dismutase; T-cell receptors; surface membrane proteins; decay<br>
accelerating factor; viral antigen such as, for example, a portion of the AIDS envelope; transport proteins;<br>
homing receptors; addressins; regulatory proteins; integrins such as GDI la, CD1 Ib, GDI Ic, CD 18, an 1C AM,<br>
VLA-4 and VCAM; a tumor associated antigen such as HER2, HERS or HER4 receptor; and fragments of any<br>
of the above-listed polypeptides.<br>
Exemplary molecular targets for antibodies encompassed by the present invention include CD proteins<br>
such as CD3, CD4, CDS, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34 and CD40; members of the ErbB receptor family such as<br>
the EGF receptor, HER2, HER3 or HER4 receptor; B cell surface antigens, such as CD20 or BR3; a member of<br>
the tumor necrosis receptor superfamily, including DR5; prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA); cell adhesion<br>

antigens; flk2/flt3 receptor; obesity (OB) receptor; mpl receptor; CTLA-4; protein C etc.<br>
Soluble antigens or fragments thereof, optionally conjugated to other molecules, can be used as<br>
immunogens for generating antibodies. For transmembrane molecules, such as receptors, fragments of these (e.g.<br>
the extracellular domain of a receptor) can be used as the immunogen. Alternatively, cells expressing the<br>
transmembrane molecule can be used as the immunogen. Such cells can be derived from a natural source (e.g.<br>
cancer cell lines) or may be cells which have been transformed by recombinant techniques to express the<br>
transmembrane molecule. Other antigens and forms thereof useful for preparing antibodies will be apparent to<br>
those in the art.<br>
For production of HER2 antibodies, the HER2 antigen to be used for production thereof may be, e.g., a<br>
soluble form of the extracellular domain of HER2 or a portion thereof, containing the desired epitope.<br>
Alternatively, cells expressing HER2 at their cell surface (e.g. NIH-3T3 cells transformed to overexpress HER2;<br>
or a carcinoma cell line such as SK-BR-3 cells, see Stancovski et al PNAS (USA) 88:8691-8695 (1991)) can be<br>
used to generate antibodies.<br>
(II) Monoclonal antibodies<br>
Monoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e.,<br>
the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical and/or bind the same epitope, except for<br>
possible variants that may arise during production of the monoclonal antibody. Thus, the modifier "monoclonal"<br>
indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies.<br>
For example, the monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by<br>
Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,816,567).<br>
In the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized as<br>
hereinabove described to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will<br>
specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro.<br>
Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to<br>
form a hybridoma cell (Coding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103 (Academic Press,<br>
1986)).<br>
The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably<br>
contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For<br>
example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase<br>
(HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin,<br>
and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.<br>
Preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody<br>
by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these,<br>
preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11<br>
or X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland USA. Human<br>
myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human<br>
monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); and Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody<br>
Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).<br>
Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal<br>
antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by<br>
hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as<br>
radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA).<br>
The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard<br>
analysis of Munsone/o/., Anal. Biochem., 107:220(1980).<br>
After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or<br>
activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Coding,<br>
Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media<br>
for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPM1-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be<br>
grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.<br>
The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium,<br>
ascites fluid, or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as, for example, protein ASepharose,<br>
hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.<br>
DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional<br>
procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the<br>
heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA.<br>
Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as<br>
E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise<br>
produce antibody protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells.<br>
Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al., Curr.<br>
Opinion in Immunol, 5:256-262 (1993) and Pluckthun, Immunol. Revs., 130:151-188 (1992).<br>
In a further embodiment, monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody<br>
phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al., Nature, 348:552-554 (1990).<br>
Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 (1991) describe the<br>
isolation of murine and human antibodies, respectively, using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe<br>
the production of high affinity (nM range) human antibodies by chain shuffling (Marks et al., Bio/Technology,<br>
10:779-783 (1992)), as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing<br>
very large phage libraries (Waterhouse et al., Nuc. Acids. Res., 21:2265-2266 (1993)). Thus, these techniques<br>
are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal<br>
antibodies.<br>
The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy<br>
chain and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567;<br>
-and Morrison, et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851 (1984)), or by covalently joining to the<br>
immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide.<br>
Typically such non-immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant domains of an<br>
antibody, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody to create<br>
a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site having specificity for an antigen and<br>
another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different antigen.<br>
(Hi) Humanized antibodies<br>
Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies have been described in the art. Preferably, a humanized<br>
antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These nonhuman<br>
amino acid residues are often referred to as "import" residues, which are typically taken from an "import"<br>
variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers<br>
(Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al,<br>
Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding<br>
sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such "humanized" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the<br>
corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human<br>
antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by<br>
residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.<br>
The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized<br>
antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called "best-fit" method, the sequence of<br>
the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain<br>
sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework<br>
region (FR) for the humanized antibody (Sims et al, J. Immunol, 151:2296 (1993); Chothia et al, J. Mol. Biol.,<br>
196:901 (1987)). Another method uses a particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of<br>
all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for<br>
several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., J.<br>
Immunol, 151:2623 (1993)).<br>
It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and<br>
other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized<br>
antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized<br>
products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional<br>
immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs<br>
are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected<br>
candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the<br>
residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that<br>
influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be<br>
selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such<br>
as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region residues are<br>
directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.<br>
WO01/00245 describes production of exemplary humanized HER2 antibodies which bind HER2 and<br>
block ligand activation of a HER receptor. The humanized antibody of particular interest herein blocks EOF,<br>
TGF-a and/or HRG mediated activation of MAPK essentially as effectively as murine monoclonal antibody 2C4<br>
(or a Fab fragment thereof) and/or binds HER2 essentially as effectively as murine monoclonal antibody 2C4 (or<br>
a Fab fragment thereof). The humanized antibody herein may, for example, comprise nonhuman hypervariable<br>
region residues incorporated into a human variable heavy domain and may further comprise a framework region<br>
(FR) substitution at a position selected from the group consisting of 69H, 71H and 73H utilizing the variable<br>
domain numbering system set forth in Kabat et a!., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed.<br>
Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991). In one embodiment, the humanized<br>
antibody comprises FR substitutions at two or all of positions 69H, 71H and 73H.<br>
An exemplary humanized antibody of interest herein comprises variable heavy domain<br>
complementarity determining residues GFTFTDYTMX, where X is preferably D or S (SEQ ID No. 7);<br>
DVNPNSGGSIYNQRFKG (SEQ ID No. 8); and/or NLGPSFYFDY (SEQ ID No. 9), optionally comprising<br>
amino acid modifications of those CDR residues, e.g. where the modifications essentially maintain or improve<br>
affinity of the antibody. For example, the antibody variant of interest may have from about one to about seven<br>
or about five amino acid substitutions in the above variable heavy CDR sequences. Such antibody variants may<br>
be prepared by affinity maturation, e.g., as described below. The most preferred humanized antibody comprises<br>
the variable heavy domain amino acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 4.<br>
The humanized antibody may comprise variable light domain complementarity determining residues<br>
KASQDVSIGVA (SEQ ID No. 10); SASYXXX, where the X as position 5 is preferably R or L, wherein the X<br>
at position 6 is preferably Y or E, and the X as position 7 is preferably T or S (SEQ ID No. 11); and/or<br>
QQYYIYPYT (SEQ ID No. 12), e.g. in addition to those variable heavy domain CDR residues in the preceding<br>
paragraph. Such humanized antibodies optionally comprise amino acid modifications of the above CDR<br>
residues, e.g. where the modifications essentially maintain or improve affinity of the antibody. For example, the<br>
antibody variant of interest may have from about one to about seven or about five amino acid substitutions in the<br>
above variable light CDR sequences. Such antibody variants may be prepared by affinity maturation, e.g., as<br>
described below. The most preferred humanized antibody comprises the variable light domain amino acid<br>
sequence in SEQ ID No. 3.<br>
The present application also contemplates affinity matured antibodies which bind HER2 and block<br>
ligand activation of a HER receptor. The parent antibody may be a human antibody or a humanized antibody,<br>
e.g., one comprising the variable light and/or heavy sequences of SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4, respectively (i.e. variant<br>
574). The affinity matured antibody preferably binds to HER2 receptor with an affinity superior to that of<br>
murine 2C4 or variant 574 (e.g. from about two or about four fold, to about 100 fold or about 1000 fold<br>
improved affinity, e.g. as assessed using a HER2-extracellular domain (BCD) ELISA). Exemplary variable<br>
heavy CDR residues for substitution include H28, H30, H34, H35, H64, H96, H99, or combinations of two or<br>
more (e.g. two, three, four, five, six, or seven of these residues). Examples of variable light CDR residues for<br>
alteration include L28, L50, L53, L56, L91, L92, L93, L94, L96, L97 or combinations of two or more (e.g. two<br>
to three, four, five or up to about ten of these residues).<br>
Various forms of the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody are contemplated. For example,<br>
the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody may be an antibody fragment, such as a Fab, which is<br>
optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent(s) in order to generate an immunoconjugate.<br>
Alternatively, the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody may be an full length antibody, such as an<br>
full length IgGl antibody.<br>
(iv) Human antibodies<br>
As an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated. For example, it is now possible<br>
to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of<br>
human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described<br>
that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (Jn) gene in chimeric and germ-line<br>
mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line<br>
immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies<br>
upon antigen challenge, See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., Proc. Natl, Acad. Sci. USA, 90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits et<br>
al, Nature, 362:255-258 (1993); Bruggermann et al., Year in Immune., 7:33 (1993); and U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,591,669, 5,589,369 and 5,545,807.<br>
Alternatively, phage display technology (McCafferty etal., Nature 348:552-553 (1990)) can be used to<br>
produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene<br>
repertoires from unimmunized donors, According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned inframe<br>
into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and<br>
displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle<br>
contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the<br>
antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage<br>
mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats; for their<br>
review see, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S. and Chiswell, David J., Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3:564-571<br>
(1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-<br>
628 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V<br>
genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors<br>
can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated<br>
essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al.,J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597 (1991), or Griffith et<br>
al., EMBOJ. 12:725-734 (1993), See, also, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,565,332 and 5,573,905.<br>
As discussed above, human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells (see U.S.<br>
Patents 5,567,610 and 5,229,275).<br>
Human HER2 antibodies are described in U.S. Patent "No. 5,772,997 issued June 30, 1998 and WO<br>
97/00271 published January 3, 1997.<br>
(v) Antibody fragments<br>
Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these<br>
fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of full length antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., Journal of<br>
Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24:107-117 (1992); and Brennan *?/«/., Science, 229:81 (1985)).<br>
However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. For example, the antibody<br>
fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab'-SH fragments<br>
can be directly recovered from E. coll and chemically coupled to form F(ab')2 fragments (Carter et al,<br>
Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab')2 fragments can be isolated directly<br>
from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent<br>
to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv).<br>
See WO 93/16185; U.S. Patent No. 5,571,894; and U.S. Patent No. 5,587,458. The antibody fragment may also<br>
be a "linear antibody", e.g., as described in U.S. Patent 5,641,870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments<br>
may be monospecific or bispecific.<br>
(vi) Bispecific antibodies<br>
Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes.<br>
Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the HER2 protein. Other such antibodies<br>
may combine a HER2 binding site with binding site(s) for EGFR, HER3 and/or HER4. Alternatively, a HER2<br>
arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor<br>
molecule (e.g. CD2 or CD3), or Fc receptors for IgG (FcyR), such as FcyRI (CD64), FcyRII (CD32) and FcyRIlI<br>
(CD16) so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the HER2-expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also<br>
be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express HER2. These antibodies possess a HER2-binding arm<br>
and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent (e.g. saporin, anti-interferon-a, vinca alkaloid, ricin A chain,<br>
methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten). Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or<br>
antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab')2 bispecific antibodies).<br>
WO 96/16673 describes a bispecific HER2/FcyRIII antibody and U.S. Patent No. 5,837,234 discloses a<br>
bispecific HER2/FcyRl antibody IDM1 (Osidem). A bispecific HER2/Fca antibody is shown in WO98/02463.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,821,337 teaches a bispecific HER2/CD3 antibody. MDX-210 is a bispecific HER2-FcyRIII<br>
Ab.<br>
Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length<br>
bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where<br>
the two chains have different specificities (Millstein et al, Nature, 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random<br>
assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential<br>
mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification<br>
of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the<br>
product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829, and in Traunecker et al., EMBOJ.,<br>
10:3655-3659(1991).<br>
According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities<br>
(antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion<br>
preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2,<br>
and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CHI) containing the site<br>
necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin<br>
heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors,<br>
and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual<br>
proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide<br>
chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding<br>
sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two<br>
polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid<br>
immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy<br>
chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this<br>
asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted<br>
immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the<br>
bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94/04690. For<br>
further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology,<br>
121:210(1986).<br>
According to another approach described in U.S. Patent No. 5,731,168, the interface between a pair of<br>
antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from<br>
recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the Cn3 domain of an antibody<br>
constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first<br>
antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory "cavities" of<br>
identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by<br>
replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism<br>
for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.<br>
Bispecific antibodies include cross-linked or "heteroconjugate" antibodies. For example, one of the<br>
antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for<br>
example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980), and for<br>
treatment of HIV infection (WO 91/00360, WO 92/200373, and EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be<br>
made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and<br>
are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.<br>
Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in<br>
the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al.,<br>
Science, 229: 81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein full length antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to<br>
generate F(ab')2 fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium<br>
arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab' fragments<br>
generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab'-TNB derivatives is then<br>
reconverted to the Fab'-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of<br>
the other Fab'-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used<br>
as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.<br>
Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab'-SH fragments from E. coll, which can be<br>
chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., J. Exp. Med, 175: 217-225 (1992) describe the<br>
production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab')2 molecule. Each Fab' fragment was separately<br>
secreted from E. coli and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The<br>
bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human<br>
T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.<br>
Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell<br>
culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers.<br>
Kostelny et al.,J. Immunol, 148(5): 1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun<br>
proteins were linked to the Fab' portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers<br>
were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers.<br>
This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The "diabody" technology<br>
described by Hollinger et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative<br>
mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain<br>
(VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the<br>
two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with<br>
the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites.<br>
Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also<br>
been reported. See Gruber et al, J. Immunol., 152:5368 (1994).<br>
Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be<br>
prepared. Tutt et al. J. Immunol. 147:60(1991).<br>
(vii) Other ammo acid sequence modifications<br>
Amino acid sequence modification(s) of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example,<br>
it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid<br>
sequence variants of the Antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the Antibody<br>
nucleic acid, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions<br>
into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the Antibody. Any combination of<br>
deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct<br>
possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the<br>
Antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.<br>
A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the Antibody that are preferred<br>
locations for mutagenesis is called "alanine scanning tnutagenesis" as described by Cunningham and Wells<br>
Science, 244:1081-1085 (1989). Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (e.g., charged residues<br>
such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably<br>
alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations<br>
demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants<br>
at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is<br>
predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the<br>
performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon<br>
or region and the expressed Antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.<br>
Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from<br>
one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single<br>
or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include a Antibody with an N-terminal<br>
methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the Antibody<br>
molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the Antibody to an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT) or a<br>
polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.<br>
Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino<br>
acid residue in the Antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for<br>
substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR or Fc region alterations are also<br>
contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of "preferred substitutions". If<br>
such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated<br>
"exemplary substitutions" in Table 1, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be<br>
introduced and the products screened.<br>
Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting<br>
substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone<br>
in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity<br>
of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to<br>
(Table Removed)  similarities in the properties of their side chains (in A. L. Lehninger, in Biochemistry, second ed., pp. 73-75,<br>
Worth Publishers, New York (1975)):<br>
(1) non-polar: Ala (A), Val (V), Leu (L), He (I), Pro (P), Phe (F), Trp (W), Met (M)<br>
(2) uncharged polar: Gly (G), Ser (S), Thr (T), Cys (C), Tyr (Y), Asn (1M), Gin (Q)<br>
(3) acidic: Asp (D), Glu (E)<br>
(4) basic: Lys (K), Arg (R), His(H)<br>
Alternatively, naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side-chain<br>
properties:<br>
(1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, lie;<br>
(2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gin;<br>
(3) acidic: Asp, Glu;<br>
(4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;<br>
(5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro;<br>
(6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.<br>
Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another<br>
class.<br>
Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the Antibody also may be<br>
substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant<br>
crosslinking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly<br>
where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment).<br>
A particularly preferred type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable<br>
region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s)<br>
selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from<br>
which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity<br>
maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (e.g. 6-7 sites) are mutated to<br>
generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a<br>
monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within<br>
each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g. binding affinity)<br>
as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, alanine scanning<br>
mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen<br>
binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody<br>
complex to identify contact points between the antibody and its antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring<br>
residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are<br>
generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior<br>
properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.<br>
Another type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original glycosylation pattern of the<br>
antibody. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, and/or adding<br>
one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody.<br>
Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment<br>
of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-Xserine<br>
and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for<br>
enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of<br>
these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers<br>
to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most<br>
commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.<br>
Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid<br>
sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked<br>
glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine<br>
or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).<br>
Where the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. For<br>
example, antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the<br>
antibody are described in US Pat Appl No US 2003/0157108 Al, Presta, L. See also US 2004/0093621 Al<br>
(Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd). Antibodies with a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the<br>
carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in WO03/011878, Jean-Mairet et al. and US<br>
Patent No. 6,602,684, Umana et al. Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide<br>
attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported in WO97/30087, Patel et al. See, also, WO98/58964 (Raju,<br>
S.) and WO99/22764 (Raju, S.) concerning antibodies with altered carbohydrate attached to the Fc region<br>
thereof. Antibody compositions comprising main species antibody with such carbohydrate structures attached to<br>
the Fc region are contemplated herein.<br>
Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the Antibody are prepared by a<br>
variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural<br>
source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotidemediated<br>
(or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared<br>
variant or a non-variant version of the antibody.<br>
(viii) Screening for antibodies with the desired properties<br>
Techniques for generating antibodies have been described above. One may further select antibodies<br>
with certain biological characteristics, as desired.<br>
To identify an antibody which blocks ligand activation of a HER receptor, the ability of the antibody to<br>
block HER ligand binding to cells expressing the HER receptor (e.g. in conjugation with another HER receptor<br>
with which the HER receptor of interest forms a HER hetero-oligomer) may be determined. For example, cells<br>
naturally expressing, or transfected to express, HER receptors of the HER hetero-oligomer may be incubated<br>
with the antibody and then exposed to labeled HER ligand. The ability of the HER2 antibody to block ligand<br>
binding to the HER receptor in the HER hetero-oligomer may then be evaluated.<br>
For example, inhibition of HRG binding to MCF7 breast tumor cell lines by HER2 antibodies may be<br>
performed using monolayer MCF7 cultures on ice in a 24-well-plate format essentially as described in<br>
WO01/00245. HER2 monoclonal antibodies may be added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes. Ilabeled<br>
rHRGpl 177.224 (25 pm) may then be added, and the incubation may be continued for 4 to 16 hours.<br>
Dose response curves may be prepared and an ICso value may be calculated for the antibody of interest. In one<br>
embodiment, the antibody which blocks ligand activation of an HER receptor will have an I€50 for inhibiting<br>
HRG binding to MCF7 cells in this assay of about 50nM or less, more preferably lOnM or less. Where the<br>
antibody is an antibody fragment such as a Fab fragment, the ICso for inhibiting HRG binding to MCF7 cells in<br>
this assay may, for example, be about lOOnM or less, more preferably 50nM or less.<br>
Alternatively, or additionally, the ability of the HER2 antibody to block HER ligand-stimulated tyrosine<br>
phosphorylation of a HER receptor present in a HER hetero-oligomer may be assessed. For example, cells<br>
endogenously expressing the HER receptors or transfected to expressed them may be incubated with the<br>
antibody and then assayed for HER ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation activity using an antiphosphotyrosine<br>
monoclonal (which is optionally conjugated with a detectable label). The kinase receptor<br>
activation assay described in U.S. Patent No. 5,766,863 is also available for determining HER receptor activation<br>
and blocking of that activity by an antibody.<br>
In one embodiment, one may screen for an antibody which inhibits HRG stimulation of pi 80 tyrosine<br>
phosphorylation in MCF7 cells essentially as described in WOO 1/00245. For example, the MCF7 cells may be<br>
plated in 24-well plates and monoclonal antibodies to HER2 may be added to each well and incubated for 30<br>
minutes at room temperature; then rHRG(31 177.244 may be added to each well to a final concentration of 0.2 nM,<br>
and the incubation may be continued for 8 minutes. Media may be aspirated from each well, and reactions may<br>
be stopped by the addition of 100 \a\ of SDS sample buffer (5% SDS, 25 mM DTT, and 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH<br>
6.8). Each sample (25 |il) may be electrophoresed on a 4-12% gradient gel (Novex) and then electrophoretically<br>
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Antiphosphotyrosine (at 1 ug/ml) immunoblots may be<br>
developed, and the intensity of the predominant reactive band at Mr ~ 180,000 may be quantified by reflectance<br>
densitometry. The antibody selected will preferably significantly inhibit HRG stimulation of p!80 tyrosine<br>
phosphorylation to about 0-35% of control in this assay. A dose-response curve for inhibition of HRG<br>
stimulation of pi 80 tyrosine phosphorylation as determined by reflectance densitometry may be prepared and an<br>
IC50 for the antibody of interest may be calculated. In one embodiment, the antibody which blocks ligand<br>
activation of a HER receptor will have an IC50 for inhibiting HRG stimulation of p!80 tyrosine phosphorylation<br>
in this assay of about 50nM or less, more preferably lOnM or less. Where the antibody is an antibody fragment<br>
such as a Fab fragment, the ICso for inhibiting HRG stimulation of pi 80 tyrosine phosphorylation in this assay<br>
may, for example, be about lOOnM or less, more preferably 50nM or less.<br>
One may also assess the growth inhibitory effects of the antibody on MDA-MB-175 cells, e.g,<br>
essentially as described in Schaefer el al. Oncogene 15:1385-1394 (1997). According to this assay, MDA-MB-<br>
175 cells may treated with a HER2 monoclonal antibody (lOug/mL) for 4 days and stained with crystal violet.<br>
Incubation with a HER2 antibody may show a growth inhibitory effect on this cell line similar to that displayed<br>
by monoclonal antibody 2C4. In a further embodiment, exogenous HRG will not significantly reverse this<br>
inhibition. Preferably, the antibody will be able to inhibit cell proliferation of MDA-MB-175 cells to a greater<br>
extent than monoclonal antibody 4D5 (and optionally to a greater extent than monoclonal antibody 7F3), both in<br>
the presence and absence of exogenous HRG.<br>
In one embodiment, the HER2 antibody of interest may block heregulin dependent association of HER2<br>
with HER3 in both MCF7 and SK-BR-3 cells as determined in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment such as<br>
that described in WO01/00245 substantially more effectively than monoclonal antibody 4D5, and preferably<br>
substantially more effectively than monoclonal antibody 7F3.<br>
To identify growth inhibitory HER2 antibodies, one may screen for antibodies which inhibit the<br>
growth of cancer cells which overexpress HER2. In one embodiment, the growth inhibitory antibody of choice<br>
is able to inhibit growth of SK-BR-3 cells in cell culture by about 20-100% and preferably by about 50-100% at<br>
an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 ug/ml. To identify such antibodies, the SK-BR-3 assay described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,677,171 can be performed. According to this assay, SK-BR-3 cells are grown in a 1:1 mixture<br>
of F12 and DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine and penicillin streptomycin.<br>
The SK-BR-3 cells are plated at 20,000 cells in a 35mm cell culture dish (2mls/35mm dish). 0.5 to 30 ug/ml of<br>
the HER2 antibody is added per dish. After six days, the number of cells, compared to untreated cells are<br>
counted using an electronic COULTER™ cell counter. Those antibodies which inhibit growth of the SK-BR-3<br>
cells by about 20-100% or about 50-100% may be selected as growth inhibitory antibodies. See US Pat No.<br>
5,677,171 for assays for screening for growth inhibitory antibodies, such as 4D5 and 3E8.<br>
In order to select for HER2 antibodies which induce apoptosis, an annexin binding assay using BT474<br>
cells is available. The BT474 cells are cultured and seeded in dishes as discussed in the preceding paragraph.<br>
The medium is then removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing 10ng/ml of the<br>
monoclonal antibody. Following a three day incubation period, monolayers are washed with PBS and detached<br>
by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged, resuspended in Ca binding buffer and aliquoted into tubes as<br>
discussed above for the cell death assay. Tubes then receive labeled annexin (e.g. annexin V-FTIC) (1 ug/ml).<br>
Samples may be analyzed using a FACSCAN™ flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT™ CellQuest software<br>
(Becton Dickinson). Those antibodies which induce statistically significant levels of annexin binding relative to<br>
control are selected as apoptosis-inducing antibodies. In addition to the annexin binding assay, a DNA staining<br>
assay using BT474 cells is available. In order to perform this assay, BT474 cells which have been treated with<br>
the antibody of interest as described in the preceding two paragraphs are incubated with 9ug/ml HOECHST<br>
33342™ for 2 hr at 37°C, then analyzed on an EPICS ELITE™ flow cytometer (Coulter Corporation) using<br>
MODFIT LT™ software (Verity Software House). Antibodies which induce a change in the percentage of<br>
apoptotic cells which is 2 fold or greater (and preferably 3 fold or greater) than untreated cells (up to 100%<br>
apoptotic cells) may be selected as pro-apoptotic antibodies using this assay. See WO98/17797 for assays for<br>
screening for HER2 antibodies which induce apoptosis, such as 7C2 and 7F3.<br>
To screen for antibodies which bind to an epitope on HER2 bound by an antibody of interest, a routine<br>
cross-blocking assay such as that described in Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,<br>
Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed to assess whether the antibody cross-blocks binding of an<br>
antibody, such as 2C4 or Pertuzumab, to HER2. Alternatively, or additionally, epitope mapping can be<br>
performed by methods known in the art and/or one can study the antibody-HER2 structure (Franklin et al.<br>
Cancer Cell 5:317-328 (2004)) to see what domain(s) of HER2 is/are bound by the antibody.<br>
(ix) Immunoconjugates<br>
The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic<br>
agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, toxin (e.g. a small molecule toxin or an enzymatically active toxin of<br>
bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and/or variants thereof), or a radioactive isotope<br>
(i.e., a radioconjugate).<br>
Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described<br>
above. Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins, such as a calicheamicin, a maytansine<br>
(U.S. Patent No. 5,208,020), a trichothene, and CC1065 are also contemplated herein.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the antibody is conjugated to one or more maytansine<br>
molecules (e.g. about 1 to about 10 maytansine molecules per antibody molecule). Maytansine may, for<br>
example, be converted to May-SS-Me which may be reduced to May-SH3 and reacted with modified antibody<br>
(Chari et al. Cancer Research 52: 127-131 (1992)) to generate a maytansinoid-antibody immunoconjugate.<br>
Another immunoconjugate of interest comprises a HER2 antibody conjugated to one or more<br>
calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded<br>
DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include,<br>
but are not limited to, 71', a2', a3', N-acetyl-y/, PSAG and 0'i (Hinman et al. Cancer Research 53: 3336-3342<br>
(1993) and Lode et al. Cancer Research 58: 2925-2928 (1998)). See, also, US Patent Nos. 5,714,586; 5,712,374;<br>
5,264,586; and 5,773,001 expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain,<br>
nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ricin A<br>
chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolaca<br>
americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria<br>
officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecenes. See, for<br>
example, WO 93/21232 published October 28,1993.<br>
The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a<br>
compound with nucleolytic activity (e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease;<br>
DNase).<br>
A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated HER2 antibodies.<br>
, • , j A 211 ,131 125 90 „ 186 „ 188 0 153 0.212 32 , .. . .<br>
Examples include At ,1 ,1 , Y , Re , Re , Sm , Bi , P and radioactive isotopes of Lu.<br>
Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein<br>
coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(Nmaleimidomethyl)<br>
cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such<br>
as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as<br>
glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives<br>
(such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as tolyene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bisactive<br>
fluorine compounds (such as l,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be<br>
prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238: 1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled l-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-<br>
methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of<br>
radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94/11026. The linker may be a "cleavable linker" facilitating release of<br>
the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, dimethyl linker or<br>
disulfide-containing linker (Chari et al. Cancer Research 52: 127-131 (1992)) may be used.<br>
Alternatively, a fusion protein comprising the HER2 antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made, e.g. by<br>
recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the antibody may be conjugated to a "receptor" (such streptavidin) for<br>
utilization in tumor pretargeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed<br>
by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a<br>
"ligand" (e.g. avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g. a radionucleotide).<br>
(x) Other antibody modifications<br>
Other modifications of the antibody are contemplated herein. For example, the antibody may be linked<br>
to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol,<br>
polyoxyalkylenes, or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol. The antibody also may be<br>
entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization<br>
(for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules,<br>
respectively), in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres,<br>
microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th edition, Oslo, A., Ed., (1980).<br>
It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function, e.g. so as<br>
to enhance antigen-dependent cell-mediated cyotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity<br>
(CDC) of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc<br>
region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally, cysteine residue(s) may be introduced in the Fc region,<br>
thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated<br>
may have improved internalization capability and/or increased complement-mediated cell killing and antibodydependent<br>
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). SeeCarone/a/.,J. Exp Med 176:1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, B. J.<br>
Immunol. 148:2918-2922 (1992). Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity may also be<br>
prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al. Cancer Research 53:2560-2565<br>
(1993). Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced<br>
complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. Anti-Cancer Drug Design 3:219-230 (1989).<br>
WOOO/42072 (Presta, L.) describes antibodies with improved ADCC function in the presence of human<br>
effector cells, where the antibodies comprise amino acid substitutions in the Fc region thereof. Preferably, the<br>
antibody with improved ADCC comprises substitutions at positions 298,333, and/or 334 of the Fc region.<br>
Preferably the altered Fc region is a human IgGl Fc region comprising or consisting of substitutions at one, two<br>
or three of these positions.<br>
Antibodies with altered Clq binding and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) are described in<br>
W099/51642, US Patent No. 6,194,55181, US Patent No. 6,242,19581, US Patent No. 6,528,62481 and US<br>
Patent No. 6,538,124 (Idusogie et al.). The antibodies comprise an amino acid substitution at one or more of<br>
amino acid positions 270, 322, 326, 327, 329, 313, 333 and/or 334 of the Fc region thereof.<br>
To increase the serum half life of the antibody, one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope<br>
into the antibody (especially an antibody fragment) as described in US Patent 5,739,277, for example. As used<br>
herein, the term "salvage receptor binding epitope" refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g.,<br>
IgGi, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule.<br>
Antibodies with substitutions in an Fc region thereof and increased serum half-lives are also described in<br>
WOOO/42072 (Presta, L.).<br>
Engineered antibodies with three or more (preferably four) functional antigen binding sites are also<br>
contemplated (US Appln No. US2002/0004587 Al, Miller et al.).<br>
The HER2 antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. Liposomes<br>
containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein et al., Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA, 82:3688 (1985); Hwang et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 77:4030 (1980); U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
4,485,045 and 4,544,545; and WO97/38731 published October 23,1997. Liposomes with enhanced circulation<br>
time are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,013,556.<br>
Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid<br>
composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEGPE).<br>
Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter.<br>
Fab' fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in<br>
Martin et al. J. Biol. Chem. 257: 286-288 (1982) via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent<br>
is optionally contained within the liposome. See Gabizon et al. J. National Cancer Inst. 81(19)1484 (1989).<br>

(xi) Antibody variant compositions<br>
The present invention, in at least one aspect, concerns formulations comprising a composition which<br>
comprises a mixture of a main species antibody and one or more variants thereof. Where the main species<br>
antibody binds HER2, preferably the HER2 antibody (either or both of the main species HER2 antibody and<br>
antibody variant thereof) is one which binds to Domain II of HER2, inhibits HER dimerization more effectively<br>
than Trastuzumab, and/or binds to a heterodimeric binding site of HER2. The preferred embodiment herein of<br>
the main species antibody is one comprising the variable light and variable heavy amino acid sequences in SEQ<br>
ID Nos. 3 and 4, and most preferably comprising a light chain amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID No.<br>
15 and 23, and a heavy chain amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID No. 16 and 24.<br>
In one embodiment, the formulated HER2 antibody composition comprises a mixture of the main<br>
species HER2 antibody and an amino acid sequence variant thereof comprising an amino-terminal leader<br>
extension. Preferably, the amino-terminal leader extension is on a light chain of the antibody variant (e.g. on one<br>
or two light chains of the antibody variant). The main species HER2 antibody or the antibody variant may be an<br>
full length antibody or antibody fragment (e.g. Fab of F(ab')2 fragments), but preferably both are full length<br>
antibodies. The antibody variant herein may comprise an amino-terminal leader extension on any one or more of<br>
the heavy or light chains thereof. Preferably, the amino-terminal leader extension is on one or two light chains<br>
of the antibody. The amino-terminal leader extension preferably comprises or consists of VHS-. Presence of<br>
the amino-terminal leader extension in the composition can be detected by various analytical techniques<br>
including, but not limited to, N-terminal sequence analysis, assay for charge heterogeneity (for instance, cation<br>
exchange chromatography or capillary zone electrophoresis), mass spectrometry, etc. The amount of the<br>
antibody variant in the composition generally ranges from an amount that constitutes the detection limit of any<br>
assay (preferably N-terminal sequence analysis) used to detect the variant to an amount less than the amount of<br>
the main species antibody. Generally, about 20% or less (e.g. from about 1% to about 15%, for instance from<br>
5% to about 15%) of the antibody molecules in the composition comprise an amino-terminal leader extension.<br>
Such percentage amounts are preferably determined using quantitative N-terminal sequence analysis or cation<br>
exchange analysis (preferably using a high-resolution, weak cation-exchange column, such as a PROP AC WCX-<br>
10™ cation exchange column). Aside from the amino-terminal leader extension variant, further amino acid<br>
sequence alterations of the main species antibody and/or variant are contemplated, including but not limited to<br>
an antibody comprising a C-terminal lysine residue on one or both heavy chains thereof, a deamidated antibody<br>
variant, etc.<br>
Moreover, the main species antibody or variant may further comprise glycosylation variations, nonlimiting<br>
examples of which include HER2 antibody comprising a Gl or G2 oligosaccharide structure attached to<br>
the Fc region thereof, HER2 antibody comprising a carbohydrate moiety attached to a light chain thereof (e.g.<br>
one or two carbohydrate moieties attached to one or two light chains of the antibody), HER2 antibody<br>
comprising a non-glycosylated heavy chain.<br>
III. Preparation of the Formulation<br>
The present invention provides, in a first aspect, a stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising a<br>
monoclonal antibody, preferably a full length human or humanized IgGl antibody, in histidine-acetate buffer,<br>
pH 5.5 to 6.5, preferably pH 5.8 to 6.2. However, the antibody in the formulation may be an antibody fragment<br>
comprising an antigen-binding region, such as a Fab or F(ab')2 fragment.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention concerns a pharmaceutical formulation comprising, or consisting<br>
essentially of, a full length IgGl antibody susceptible to deamidation or aggregation in an amount from about<br>
lOmg/mL to about 250mg/mL; histidine-acetate buffer, pH 5.5 to 6.5; saccharide selected from the group<br>
consisting of trehalose and sucrose, in an amount from about 60mM to about 250mM; and polysorbate 20 in an<br>
amount from about 0.01% to about 0.1%.<br>
In yet a further embodiment, the invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising an<br>
antibody that binds to domain II of HER2 in a histidine buffer at a pH from about 5.5 to about 6.5, a saccharide<br>
and a surfactant. For example, the formulation may comprise Pertuzumab in an amount from about 20mg/mL to<br>
about 40mg/mL, histidine-acetate buffer, sucrose, and polysorbate 20, wherein the pH of the formulation is from<br>
about 5.5 to about 6.5<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a DR5 antibody in a<br>
histidine buffer at a pH from about 5.5 to about 6.5, a saccharide, and a surfactant. Such a formulation may, for<br>
example, comprise, Apomab in an amount from about lOmg/mL to about 30mg/mL, histidine-acetate buffer,<br>
trehalose, and polysorbate 20, wherein the pH of the formulation is from about 5.5 to about 6.5.<br>
The formulation is especially useful for antibodies that are susceptible to deamidation and/or<br>
aggregation and/or fragmentation, in that the buffer retards deamidation and/or aggregation and/or fragmentation<br>
of the antibody formulated therein. In addition, unlike other histidine buffers prepared using HC1, the histidineacetate<br>
buffer lacks the chloride ion which was found to be beneficial herein in that this buffer when combined<br>
with saccharide had the same protective effect on antibody as polysorbate 20, and was stable and compatible<br>
with storage in stainless steel tanks. Thus, in addition to the formulation per se comprising the antibody<br>
susceptible to deamidation, aggregation and/or fragmentation, the invention provides a method for reducing<br>
deamidation, aggregation and/or fragmentation of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (for example, relative to a<br>
composition at a different pH or in a different buffer), comprising formulating the antibody in a histidine-acetate<br>
buffer, pH 5.5 to 6.5. In this embodiment, one may determine or measure deamidation, aggregation and/or<br>
fragmentation before and after the antibody is formulated, with the formulated antibody demonstrating<br>
acceptable deamidation, aggregation and/or fragmentation in the formulation and upon storage thereof.<br>
The antibody in the formulation may bind an antigen including but not limited to: HER2, CD20, IgE,<br>
DR5, BR3 and VEGF.<br>
Where the formulated antibody binds HER2, it preferably is one which binds to Domain II of HER2,<br>
inhibits HER dimerization more effectively than Trastuzumab, and/or binds to a heterodimeric binding site of<br>
HER2. The preferred embodiment herein of a formulated HER2 antibody is one comprising the variable light<br>
and variable heavy amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4, and most preferably comprising the light<br>
chain and heavy chain amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 15 and 16 (Pertuzumab).<br>

2000, US 6,642,358 issued November 4, 2003; US 6,743,625 issued June 1,2004. The most preferred DR5<br>
antibody is Apomab.<br>
Each of the formulations noted above comprises a buffer, preferably a histidine buffer, and most<br>
preferably a histidine-acetate buffer with a pH of 5.5 to 6.5, preferably 5.8 to 6.2, for example approximately 6.0.<br>
The concentration of the buffer is dictated, at least in part, by the desired pH. Exemplary concentrations for the<br>
buffer are in the range from about ImM to about 200mM, preferably from about lOmM to about 40mM, most<br>
preferably about 20mM.<br>
The antibody concentration in the formulation is preferably in the range from about lOmg/mL to about<br>
250mg/mL. The antibody concentration may be determined based on the intended use and mode of<br>
administration of the formulation. For example, where the formulation is for IV administration (e.g. a HER2<br>
antibody), the antibody concentration in the formulation is preferably from about 20mg/mL to about 40mg/mL.<br>
In the exemplified Pertuzumab formulation intended for intravenous (IV) administration, the antibody<br>
concentration was from about 20mg/mL to about 40mg/mL, most preferably about 30mg/mL.<br>
Where the antibody is for SQ or IM administration (e.g. for an anti-IgE antibody) higher concentrations<br>
of the antibody may be desired. Such substantially high antibody concentrations may be from about 50mg/mL to<br>
about 250mg/mL, or from about 80mg/mL to about 250mg/mL, or from about lOOmg/mL to about 200mg/mL.<br>
Where the formulation comprises a DR5 antibody, such as Apomab, exemplary antibody concentrations<br>
are from about lOmg/mL to about 30mg/mL, for example about 20mg/mL DR5 antibody; such formulation<br>
being useful for intravenous administration.<br>
The formulation for administration is preferably an aqueous formulation (not lyophilized) and has not<br>
been subjected to prior lyophilization. While the formulation may be lyophilized, preferably it is not. However,<br>
freezing of the aqueous formulation, without simultaneous drying that occurs during freeze-drying, is<br>
specifically contemplated herein, facilitating longer term storage thereof, for instance in a stainless steel tank.<br>
The formulation preferably further comprises a saccharide, most preferably a disaccharide, such as<br>
trehalose or sucrose. The saccharide is generally included in an amount which reduces soluble aggregate<br>
formation, such as that which occurs upon freeze/thaw. Exemplary saccharide concentrations are in the range<br>
from about lOmM to about IM, for example from about 60mM to about 250mM, and most preferably about<br>
120mM for a HER2 antibody formulation, and about 240mM for a DR5 antibody formulation.<br>
While it was found herein that a formulation comprising histidine-acetate buffer and saccharide was<br>
stable, the formulation optionally further comprises surfactant, such as polysorbate, most preferably polysorbate<br>
20. The surfactant is generally included in an amount which reduces insoluble aggregate formation (such as that<br>
which occurs upon shaking or shipping). The surfactant concentration is preferably from about 0.0001% to<br>
about 1.0%, most preferably from about 0.01% to about 0.1%, for example about 0.02%.<br>
Optionally, the formulation does not contain a tonicitying amount of a salt such as sodium chloride.<br>
The formulation is generally sterile, and this can be achieved according to the procedures known to the<br>
skilled person for generating sterile pharmaceutical formulations suitable for administration to human subjects,<br>
including filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to, or following, preparation of the formulation.<br>
Moreover, the formulation is desirably one which has been demonstrated to be stable upon storage.<br>
Various stability assays are available to the skilled practitioner for confirming the stability of the formulation.<br>
For example, the formulation may be one which is found to be stable upon storage: at about 40°C for at least 4<br>
weeks; at about 5°C or about 15°C for at least 3 months or at least 1 year; and/or about -20°C for at least 3<br>
months. Stability can be tested by evaluating physical stability, chemical stability, and/or biological activity of<br>
the antibody in the formulation around the time of formulation as well as following storage at the noted<br>
temperatures. Physical and/or stability can be evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively in a variety of<br>
different ways, including evaluation of aggregate formation (for example using size exclusion chromatography,<br>
by measuring turbidity, and/or by visual inspection); by assessing charge heterogeneity using cation exchange<br>
chromatography or capillary zone electrophoresis; amino-terminal or carboxy-terminal sequence analysis; mass<br>
spectrometric analysis; SDS-PAGE analysis to compare reduced and intact antibody; peptide map (for example<br>
tryptic or LYS-C) analysis; evaluting biological activity or antigen binding function of the antibody; etc.<br>
Instability may result in aggregation, deamidation (e.g. Asn deamidation), oxidation (e.g. Met oxidation),<br>
isomerization (e.g. Asp isomeriation), clipping/hydrolysis/fragmentation (e.g. hinge region fragmentation),<br>
succinimide formation, unpaired cysteine(s), N-terminal extension, C-terminal processing, glycosylation<br>
differences, etc. Biological activity or antigen binding function can be evaluated using various techniques<br>
available to the skilled practitioner.<br>
As noted above, freezing of the formulation is specifically contemplated herein. Hence, the formulation<br>
can be tested for stability upon freezing and thawing.<br>
According, the invention also provides a method of making a pharmaceutical formulation comprising<br>
preparing the formulation as described herein, and evaluating physical stability, chemical stability, or biological<br>
activity of the monoclonal antibody in the formulation.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the formulation is provided inside a vial with a stopper pierceable by a<br>
syringe, preferably in aqueous form. The vial is desirably stored at about 2-8°C until it is administered to a<br>
subject in need thereof. The vial may for example be a 20cc vial (for example for a 420mg dose) or 50cc vial<br>
(for example for a 1050mg dose). For a DR5 antibody, such as Apomab, the formulation may be provided in a<br>
5cc glass vial (e.g. 5.5ml fill).<br>
In another embodiment, the formulation is provided inside a stainless steel tank. The formulation in the<br>
stainless steel tank is optionally frozen and not freeze-dried.<br>
One or more other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers such as those<br>
described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980) may be included in the<br>
formulation provided that they do not adversely affect the desired characteristics of the formulation. Acceptable<br>
carriers, excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and<br>
include; additional buffering agents; co-solvents; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; chelating<br>
agents such as EDTA; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); biodegradable polymers such as polyesters;<br>
preservatives; and/or salt-forming counterions such as sodium.<br>
IV. Treatment with the Antibody Formulation<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating a disease or disorder in a subject<br>
comprising administering the formulation described herein to a subject in an amount effective to treat the disease<br>
or disorder.<br>
Where the antibody in the formulation binds to HER2, it is preferably used to treat cancer. The cancer<br>
will generally comprise HER2-expressing cells, such that the HER2 antibody herein is able to bind to the cancer<br>
cells. Thus, the invention in this embodiment concerns a method for treating HER2-expressing cancer in a<br>
subject, comprising administering the HER2 antibody pharmaceutical formulation to the subject in an amount<br>
effective to treat the cancer. Various cancers that can be treated with the composition are listed in the definitions<br>
section above.<br>
It is also contemplated that the HER2 antibody formulation may be used to treat various non-malignant<br>
diseases or disorders, such a include autoimmune disease (e.g. psoriasis); endometriosis; scleroderma; restenosis;<br>
polyps such as colon polyps, nasal polyps or gastrointestinal polyps; fibroadenoma; respiratory disease (see<br>
definition above); cholecystitis; neurofibromatosis; polycystic kidney disease; inflammatory diseases; skin<br>
disorders including psoriasis and dermatitis; vascular disease (see definition above); conditions involving<br>
abnormal proliferation of vascular epithelial cells; gastrointestinal ulcers; Menetrier's disease, secreting<br>
adenomas or protein loss syndrome; renal disorders; angiogenic disorders; ocular disease such as age related<br>
macular degeneration, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, retinal neovascularization from proliferative<br>
diabetic retinopathy, retinal vascularization, diabetic retinopathy, or age related macular degeneration; bone<br>
associated pathologies such as osteoarthritis, rickets and osteoporosis; damage following a cerebral ischemic<br>
event; fibrotic or edemia diseases such as hepatic cirrhosis, lung fibrosis, carcoidosis, throiditis, hyperviscosity<br>
syndrome systemic, Osier Weber-Rendu disease, chronic occlusive pulmonary disease, or edema following<br>
burns, trauma, radiation, stroke, hypoxia or ischemia; hypersensitivity reaction of the skin; diabetic retinopathy<br>
and diabetic nephropathy; Guillain-Barre syndrome; graft versus host disease or transplant rejection; Paget's<br>
disease; bone or joint inflammation; photoaging (e.g. caused by UV radiation of human skin); benign prostatic<br>
hypertrophy; certain microbial infections including microbial pathogens selected from adenovirus, hantaviruses,<br>
Borrelia burgdorferi, Yersinia spp. and Bordetella pertussis; thrombus caused by platelet aggregation;<br>
reproductive conditions such as endometriosis, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, preeclampsia, dysfunctional<br>
uterine bleeding, or menometrorrhagia; synovitis; atheroma; acute and chronic nephropathies (including<br>
proliferative glomerulonephritis and diabetes-induced renal disease); eczema; hypertrophic scar formation;<br>
endotoxic shock and fungal infection; familial adenomatosis polyposis; neurodedenerative diseases (e.g.<br>
Alzheimer's disease, AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, retinitis<br>
pigmentosa, spinal muscular atrophy and cerebellar degeneration); myelodysplastic syndromes; aplastic anemia;<br>
ischemic injury; fibrosis of the lung, kidney or liver; T-cell mediated hypersensitivity disease; infantile<br>
hypertrophic pyloric stenosis; urinary obstructive syndrome; psoriatic arthritis; and Hasimoto's thyroiditis.<br>
Preferred non-malignant indications for therapy herein include psoriasis, endometriosis, scleroderma, vascular<br>
disease (e.g. restenosis, artherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, or hypertension), colon polyps, fibroadenoma<br>
or respiratory disease (e.g. asthma, chronic bronchitis, bronchieactasis or cystic fibrosis).<br>
Where the antibody in the formulation binds to a B-cell surface marker such as CD20 or BR3, the<br>
formulation may be used to treat a B-cell malignancy, such as NHL or CLL, an autoimmune disease, graft<br>
rejection, or to block an immune response to a foreign antigen, such as an antibody, a toxin, a gene therapy viral<br>
vector, a graft, an infectious agent, or an alloantigen (see WO 01/03734, Grillo-Lopez et al.).<br>
Where the antibody in the formulation is an IgE antibody, it may be used to treat an IgE-mediated<br>
disorder (USSN 2004/0197324 Al, Liu and Shire), such as allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis,<br>
allergic gastroenteropathy, hypersensitivity, eczema, urticaria, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, parasitic<br>
disease, hyper-IgE syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, thymic alymphoplasia, IgE<br>
myeloma, and graft-versus-host reaction.<br>
Antibodies that bind to a receptor in the TNF superfamily (for instance which bind to DR5), or which<br>
bind to VEGF (or a receptor thereof), may be used to treat cancer, various forms of which are described in the<br>
definitions section above. Preferably, the cancer treated with a DR5 antibody formulation is a solid tumor or<br>
NHL.<br>
Where the indication is cancer, the patient may be treated with a combination of the antibody<br>
formulation, and a chemotherapeutic agent. The combined administration includes coadministration or<br>
concurrent administration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive<br>
administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents<br>
simultaneously exert their biological activities. Thus, the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered prior to,<br>
or following, administration of the composition. In this embodiment, the timing between at least one<br>
administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and at least one administration of the composition is preferably<br>
approximately 1 month or less, and most preferably approximately 2 weeks or less. Alternatively, the<br>
chemotherapeutic agent and the composition are administered concurrently to the patient, in a single formulation<br>
or separate formulations.<br>
Treatment with the formulation will result in an improvement in the signs or symptoms of cancer or<br>
disease. For instance, where the disease being treated is cancer, such therapy may result in an improvement in<br>
survival (overall survival and/or progression free survival) and/or may result in an objective clinical response<br>
(partial or complete). Moreover, treatment with the combination of the chemotherapeutic agent and the antibody<br>
formulation may result in a synergistic, or greater than additive, therapeutic benefit to the patient.<br>
Preferably, the antibody in the formulation administered is a naked antibody. However, the antibody<br>
administered may be conjugated with a cytotoxic agent. Preferably, the immunoconjugate and/or antigen to<br>
which it is bound is/are internalized by the cell, resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the<br>
immunoconjugate in killing the cancer cell to which it binds. In a preferred embodiment, the cytotoxic agent<br>
targets or interferes with nucleic acid in the cancer cell. Examples of such cytotoxic agents include<br>
maytansinoids, calicheamicins, ribonucleases and DNA endonucleases.<br>
The formulation is administered to a human patient in accord with known methods, such as intravenous<br>
administration, e.g., as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal,<br>
intracerobrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral, topical, or inhalation routes.<br>
Intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of antibody composition is preferred, with<br>
intravenous administration being most preferred.<br>
For subcutaneous delivery, the formulation may be administered via syringe; injection device (e.g. the<br>
INJECT-EASE™ and GENJECT™ device); injector pen (such as the GENPEN™); needleless device (e.g.<br>
MEDIJECTOR™ and BIOJECTOR™); or subcutaneous patch delivery system.<br>
For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of the antibody will depend on the<br>
type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is<br>
administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response<br>
to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the<br>
patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1<br>
Hg/kg to 50 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1-20mg/kg) of HER2 or DR5 antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration<br>
to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. The<br>
dosage of the antibody will generally be in the range from about 0.05mg/kg to about lOmg/kg. If a<br>
chemotherapeutic agent is administered, it is usually administered at dosages known therefor, or optionally<br>
lowered due to combined action of the drugs or negative side effects attributable to administration of the<br>
chemotherapeutic agent. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used<br>
according to manufacturers' instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and<br>
dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service Ed., M.C. Perry, Williams<br>
&amp; Wilkins, Baltimore, MD (1992).<br>
Other therapeutic regimens may be combined with the antibody including, but not limited to: a second<br>
(third, fourth, etc) chemotherapeutic agent(s) (i.e. "cocktails" of different chemotherapeutic agents); another<br>
monoclonal antibody;a growth inhibitory agent; a cytotoxic agent; a chemotherapeutic agent; EGFR-targeted<br>
drug; tyrosine kinase inhibitor; anti-angiogenic agent; and/or cytokine; etc.<br>
In addition to the above therapeutic regimes, the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer<br>
cells and/or radiation therapy.<br>
V. Articles of Manufacture<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture is provided which contains the<br>
pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention and provides instructions for its use. The article of<br>
manufacture comprises a container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials (e.g. dual chamber<br>
vials), syringes (such as dual chamber syringes) and test tubes. The, container may be formed from a variety of<br>
materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds the formulation and the label on, or associated with, the<br>
container may indicate directions for use. The container holding the formulation may be a multi-use vial, which<br>
allows for repeat administrations (e.g. from 2-6 administrations) of the reconstituted formulation. The article of<br>
manufacture may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including<br>
other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and package inserts with instructions for use as noted in the<br>
previous section.<br>
The invention will be more fully understood by reference to the following examples. They should not,<br>
however, be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. All literature and patent citations are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Stable Pertuzumab Liquid Formulations<br>
These examples describe the development and stability testing of stable liquid formulations comprising<br>
Pertuzumab at protein concentrations in the range from about 10 mg/mL - 180 mg/mL. The selected<br>
formulations had low turbidity, and were physically and chemically stable. A chloride ion was removed from<br>
the formulation to reduce the risk of corrosion. The formulation was isotonic, and suitable for subcutaneous or<br>
intramuscular delivery. Insoluble aggregate formation upon agitation stress was prevented using histidineacetate<br>
and sucrose formulation, without the need to include polysorbate 20.<br>
Analytical Methods<br>
Color, Appearance and Clarity (CAC)<br>
The color, appearance, and clarity of the samples were determined by visual inspection of vials against<br>
a white and black background under white fluorescence light at room temperature.<br>
UV Concentration Measurements<br>
The liquid product aliquot was first diluted with formulation buffer so that the Amax near 278 nm is<br>
within 0.5-1.0 absorbance unit. The UV absorbance of the diluted samples was measured in a quartz cuvette with<br>
1 cm path length on an HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Absorbance was measured at 278 nm and 320 nm. The<br>
absorbance from 320 nm is used to correct background light scattering due to larger aggregates, bubbles and<br>
particles. The measurements were blanked against the formulation buffer. The protein concentration was<br>
determined using the absorptivity of 1.50 (mg/mL)"'cnf'.<br>
pH measurements<br>
The pH was measured at room temperature using a RADIOMETER COPENHAGEN PHM82™ pH<br>
meter. The probe used was a combined glass/reference electrode with radiometer connector (Sigma, Cat# E-<br>
5759). Standard solutions of pH 4.01 and pH 7.00 (EM Science) were used for calibration of the pH meter.<br>
Ion-Exchange Chromatography (IEX)<br>
Cation exchange chromatography was employed to measure changes in charge variants. This assay<br>
utilizes a DIONEX PROP AC WCX-10™ column on an HP 1100™ HPLC system. Samples were diluted to 1<br>
mg/mL with the mobile phase A containing 20 mM MES at pH 6.0. 50 mL of diluted samples were then loaded<br>
on the column that was kept at ambient temperature. The peaks were eluted with a shallow NaCl gradient using<br>
mobile B containing 20 mM MES, 250 mM NaCl, pH 6.0. The eluent was monitored at 280 nm. The data were<br>
analyzed using HP CHEMSTATION™ software (Rev A08.03).<br>
Capillary Zone Electrophophoresis (CZE)<br>
The purity of Fab and F(ab')2 fragments was determined by CZE. This assay was run on a BIORAD<br>
BIOFOCUS™ 3000™ capillary electrophoresis system with a BIOCAP XL™ capillary, 50 urn I.D., 44.6 cm<br>
total length and 40 cm to the detector.<br>
Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)<br>
Size exclusion chromatography was used to quantitate aggregates and fragments. This assay utilizes a<br>
TSK G3000 SWXL™, 7.8 x 300 mm column and runs on an HP 1100™ HPLC system. Samples were diluted to<br>
10 mg/mL with the mobile phase and injection volume was 20 uL. The mobile phase was 100 mM K.2HP04 at<br>
pH 6.8 and the protein was eluted with an isocratic gradient at 0.5 mL/min for 45 minutes. The eluent<br>
absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. Integration was done using HP CHEMSTATION™ software (Rev<br>
with TEFLON™ coated gray butyl stoppers. Samples were stored at 40 ± 2 °C. The stability analyses of drug<br>
product showed that the Fab and F(ab')2 were most stable between pH 5.0 and 6.0.<br>
(Table Removed)ellular apoptosis is mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Chemotherapy can cause cell<br>
damage and may trigger apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway in response to cellular damage. However, cancer<br>
cells often develop resistance to chemotherapy through mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene (Ashkenazi<br>
A. Targeting Death and Decoy Receptors of the Tumour-Necrosis Factor Superfamily. Nature Reviews 2:420-<br>
430 (2002)). Death receptors, such as DR4 and DR5, located on the surface of cells trigger apoptosis via the<br>
extrinsic pathway that does not involve p53. Agonistic molecules, such as Apo2L, bind to DR4 and DR5<br>
receptors and activate caspases 8 and 10 through Fas-associated death domain. Caspase 8 and 10 then activate<br>
caspases 3,6, and 7 to induce apoptosis. Molecular signaling of death receptors on tumor cells has therapeutic<br>
potential for the elimination of cancer cells that are resistant to conventional therapies and molecules, like<br>
Apo2L, are currently undergoing clinical evaluation.<br>
"Apomab" is a full-length CHO derived humanized IgGl constructed with a lamda light chain. It is an<br>
agonist antibody against DR5 that has been shown to induce apoptosis of various cancer cell lines. Preclinical<br>
studies using a murine tumor implant model have shown that Apomab has similar or improved tumor reduction<br>
compared to Apo2L. Apomab is being evaluated as an anti-cancer agent in the indications of advanced solid<br>
tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). The heavy and light chain amino acid sequences of Apomab<br>
used in these experiments are shown in Figs. 27 and 28.<br>
Preparation of Antibody Formulations<br>
Recombinantly produced Apomab had very dilute protein concentration and high pH. The material was<br>
concentrated to approximately 20 mg/mL and exchanged into 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0 buffer using a<br>
Millipore Labscale tangential flow filtration (TFF) system with MILLIPORE PELLICON™ XL, PLCGC10, 50<br>
cm membrane. Apomab samples were formulated into various buffer systems covering pH range from 4.0 to 7.0<br>
using sodium acetate, histidine acetate, and sodium phosphate without trehalose and TWEEN 20® using dialysis<br>
with a 10,000 Da molecular weight cut off membrane (Pierce, Inc). Trehalose at 240 mM was added in the last<br>
dialysis. After dialysis, 0.02% TWEEN 20™ was added to the formulation and the samples were filtered with<br>
0.22 urn filters (Millipore, Inc.). A 0.5 mL volume of Apomab was filled into sterile 3 cc glass vials (Forma<br>
Vitrum, Inc.) and sealed with 13 mm stoppers (Daikyo, Inc). Protein stability was evaluated at -70°C, 5°C, 30°C,<br>
and 40°C with storage for up to 3 months.<br>
Stability of Apomab Formulation<br>
For drug product stability testing, Apomab formulated bulk filled into 5 cc FORMA VITRUM® glass<br>
vials were formulated. Vials were filled with 5.5 mL of formulated antibody, fitted with 20 mm DAIKYO®<br>
stoppers, and stored at -70°C, 5°C, 30°C, and 40°C in the upright position.<br>
For drug substance stability testing, Apomab formulated bulk was sterile filtered through a 0.22 urn<br>
filter and 10 mL was filled into autoclaved 20cc 316L stainless steel mini-tanks. The tanks were placed upright<br>
at -20°C and 5°C. A I mL aliquot was aseptically removed from the mini-tanks at specified time intervals to<br>
assess protein quality. The control vials were 1 mL aliquots in 3 cc glass vials stored at -20°C.<br>
Color, Appearance, and Clarity<br>
The clarity, appearance, and color of the samples were visually assessed under white fluorescent light<br>
using a light inspection station with black and white background. For analysis of the drug substance, mini-tank<br>
samples were transferred to a 3 cc glass vial for inspection.<br>
PH<br>
pH was measured at room temperature with THERMO ORION SURE-FLOW ROSS™ semi-micro pH<br>
electrode for measuring buffers or THERMO ORION GLS™ combination micro pH electrode for measuring<br>
protein pH screening samples, a Beckman microelectrode probe for Toxicology stability samples. The<br>
METERLAB™ pHM240 pH/Ion meter (Radiometer Analytical) was calibrated every day with buffer standards<br>
(EM Science) at pH 7 and pH 4.<br>
Concentration<br>
Protein concentration was determined by ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy using an AGILENT<br>
8453™ spectrophotometer. The samples were diluted with appropriate formulation buffer blanks to give an<br>
absorbance from 0.5 to 1.0. The instrument was blanked with the diluent solution and the spectrum was scanned<br>
from 240 to 500 nm. The absorbance value at 320 nm was subtracted from the absorbance at 279 nm to correct<br>
for offset and light scattering. The protein concentrations were calculated by the following equation:<br>
Cone. (mg/mL) = (A279 - A320) X dilution factor<br>
absorptivity coefficient in cm"'(mg/mL)"1<br>
The absorptivity coefficient based on sequence was initially determined to be 1.32 cm'^mg/mL)"1 and<br>
this value was used for the pH screening studies. A later value of 1.7 cm"'(mg/mL)"' was determined by amino<br>
acid analysis and proteolysis methods and this value was used for the stability analysis of Apomab used in<br>
Toxicology studies.<br>
Ion-Exchange Chromatography<br>
Ion exchange chromatography was carried out on an 1100 series HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Inc.)<br>
equipped with a diode array detector. Chromatography was carried out on a PROP AC WCX-10™ (Dionex)<br>
25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5. Mobile phase B was 100 mM sodium chloride in the same buffer as mobile<br>
phase A. The column was equilibrated with 100% mobile phase A. For pH screening samples an amount of 20<br>
mg of Apomab was loaded onto the column and the absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. Protein was eluted<br>
For stability analysis of material used in the Toxicology studies an amount of 30 mg of Apomab was<br>
loaded onto the column and the absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. Protein was eluted from the column with<br>
Size-Exclusion Chromatography<br>
Size exclusion chromatography was carried out on an 1100 series HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Inc.)<br>
equipped with a diode array detector. An amount of 50 ug Apomab was loaded onto a TSK Gel 3000SWXL™<br>
(7.8 x 300 mm) column and run at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min for 20 minutes for pH screening samples and 0.5<br>
mL/min for 30 minutes for Toxicology stability samples with 0.20 M potassium phosphate, 0.25 M potassium<br>
chloride, pH 6.2 as a mobile phase. Absorbance was monitored at 280 nm.<br>
Potency<br>
The purpose of the potency bioassay was to measure the ability of Apomab to kill Colo205 cells using<br>
ALAMARBLUE™. Colo205 is a colon carcinoma cell line, which expresses both DR5 and DR4 death<br>
receptors. This assay incorporates a fluorometric/colorimetric growth indicator based on detection of metabolic<br>
activity. ALAMARBLUE™ is a redox dye that is blue and non-fluorescent in oxidized state. The intracellular<br>
metabolic reduction converts it into a red color that is also fluorescent. The changes in color and fluorescence<br>
are proportional to the metabolic activity and number of living cells. The signal decreased when cells die.<br>
Apomab was diluted in medium with anti-Fc and then Colo 205 cells were added to Apomab samples and<br>
incubate at 37°C for 48 hours. ALAMARBLUE™ is added for the last 2-3 hours. The plate was read at 530 nm<br>
excitation and 590 nm emission to get relative fluorescence units (RFU). The data were analyzed by<br>
KALEIDAGRAPH™. A dilution curve of killing was generated.<br>
The effect of pH on antibody stability was studied using Apomab produced from an unamplified stable<br>
cell line. For this analysis, Apomab was formulated at 20 mg/mL antibody in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer at<br>
pH 4.0,4.5, 5.0, 5.5; 20 mM histidine acetate buffer at pH 6.0 and 6.5; and 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer at<br>
pH 7.0. All of the formulations contained 240 mM trehalose and 0.02% TWEEN 20®. The formulations were<br>
stored for up to 3 months at temperatures of-70°C, 5°C, 30°C, and 40°C and protein stability was determined by<br>
various analytical assays, including CAC, pH, concentration, SEC and IEC. No significant changes in CAC, pH<br>
or protein concentration were observed during storage of the samples.<br>
Analysis of the samples by SEC showed that no significant changes occurred during storage at 5°C and<br>
-70°C. However, degradation observed as the formation of antibody fragments and soluble aggregates occurred<br>
during storage at 30°C and 40°C (Fig. 20). To compare the formulations, antibody monomer kinetics during<br>
storage was monitored and the first-order rate constants were calculated. The obtained pH rate profile for the<br>
loss in antibody monomer is shown in Fig. 21. The optimal condition for the stability of antibody monomer was<br>
obtained by formulating in histidine acetate buffer at pH 6.0.<br>
Apomab charge heterogeneity was monitored by IEC. No significant changes in the IEC profile<br>
occurred during storage at 5°C and -70°C. However, degradation observed as the formation of acidic or basic<br>
variants occurred depending on the formulation (Fig. 22). In general, increased basic variants were formed at<br>
lower formulation pH and more acidic variants were formed at higher formulation pH. To compare the<br>
formulations, IEC main peak kinetics was monitored during storage and the first-order rate constants were<br>
calculated. The obtained pH rate profile for the loss in IEC main peak is shown in Fig. 23. The rate constants<br>
observed by IEC were approximately 10 fold higher than those from SEC (Fig. 21). Therefore, the loss in IEC<br>
main peak was the primary degradation of the antibody that will ultimately limit the product shelf life.<br>
Furthermore, as observed by SEC, optimal antibody stability to stabilize IEC main peak was obtained by<br>
formulating in histidine acetate buffer at pH 6.0.<br>
Following the analysis of pH screening data described above, an Apomab formulation was selected that<br>
comprised 20 mg/mL antibody in 20 mM histidine acetate, 240 mM trehalose, 0.02% polysorbate 20, pH 6.0.<br>
For the drug product, the vial configuration consisted of 5.5 mL fill in a 5 cc FORMA VITRUM™ vial with a 20<br>
mM DAIKYO™ West stopper. Apomab was stored in stainless steel tanks.<br>
The stability of Apomab Drug Product was evaluated in the 5cc glass vial configuration described<br>
above. Vials were stored at -70°C (controls), 5°C, 30°C, and 40°C. Samples were pulled at specific time<br>
intervals and analyzed by the following assays: color, appearance, clarity (CAC), pH, protein concentration, SEC,<br>
IEC, and potency. The results from these assays are shown in Table 6 for samples stored at -70°C and 5°C and<br>
(Table Removed)o change in protein quality was observed after twelve months storage at -70°C and 5°C. For instance,<br>
the pH remained at 6.0 ± 0.3, Apomab appeared as a clear and colorless liquid, the protein concentration<br>
remained at 20.0 ± 2.0 mg/mL, and % monomer was unchanged. Furthermore, there was no significant change<br>
in % IEC main peak and % specific activity determined by the cell-killing potency assay was within the assay<br>
precision of 60 % to 140 % specific activity. The results showed that Apomab stored in 5 cc glass vials was<br>
stable for at least 12 months at 5°C.<br>
Table 7 shows that changes in protein quality occurred at 30°C and 40°C. SEC showed a decrease in %<br>
monomer with a rise primarily in fragment species. Aggregates increase as well at higher temperature, but the<br>
rate was much slower. However, the aggregates increase significantly after 6 months at 40°C. IEC % main peak<br>
decreased with a corresponding increase in acidic variants. Basic peaks decreased slightly after 2 months at<br>
40°C and 9 months at 30°C. After six months of storage at 40°C, degradation occurred to an extent that IEC<br>
main peak could no longer be integrated. The cell killing bioassay showed loss of % specific activity at higher<br>
temperature with longer storage time. Protein concentration and pH were unchanged. The solution becomes<br>
slightly yellow after 3 months at 40°C and 9 months at 30°C and becomes yellow after 9 months at 40°C.<br>
