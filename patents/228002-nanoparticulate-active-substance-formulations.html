				<td>Nancparticulate active substance formulations Description<br>
The present invention relates to active compound formulations which, in addition to at least one active compound, comprise at least one random radical copolymer, which comprises, as monomer unite, at least one olefinically unsaturated sulfonic acid i) or a salt thereof or a mixture of acid and salt and at least one alky}-, aryt-, alkylaryl-, ary! alkyl-, aryloxyalkyi-, alkoxyaryl- or hydroxyalkyl-substituted (meth)acrylate or (meth)acryiamide ii), and if appropriate additional additives. The invention additionally relates to processes for the preparation of the active com¬pound formulations, dispersions which are prepared by redispersing these active com¬pound formulations in aqueous systems, and the use of these active compound formu¬lations.<br>
Many active compounds are ideally provided in the form of aqueous systems. This naturally makes more difficult an effective application of active compounds virfiich are insoluble or only slightly soluble in water, since the bioavailability and accordingly the biological activity are low. Many active compounds, especially in the agricultural and pharmaceutical fields, are hydrophobic by nature and therefore are subject to the abo¬vementioned problem of application.<br>
It is known that solubility, dispersibility and bioavailability of active compound particles can be increased by expanding the particle surface area, i.e. by reducing the particle size at an klentical total amount. For example, the penetration of biological membranes is simplified at a smaller particle size.<br>
This simultaneously means that, in comparison with the application of the active com¬pound in the form of larger particles, the amounts of active compound necessary to achieve the same effect are smaller virtien particles in the size range of 1 micrometer and less are used.<br>
Sur^ce active substances, which inhibit crystal grovrth and agglomeration, are fre-quentiy used to stabilize nanoparticulate systems. Typical stabilizers are low-molecular-weight surfactants or oligomers which result in the fonnation of micelles. The active compound content of such micelles is often low, vt^ich is disadvantageous. However, high-molecular-weight auxiliaries, such as, for example, ailloids, amphiphiiic polymers and thickeners, also raise the possibility of stabilizing small active compound particles.<br>
While the abovementioned protective colloids stabilize the particles against agglomera¬tion by covering the surfece and leading to repulsive electrostatic and/or steric interac¬tions between the particles, thickeners stabilize kinetically by slowing down the diffu¬sion and accordingly the rate of collision between the particles.<br><br>
wo 97/13503 reveals a method for of preparation of nanoparticles, in which an agent and a matrix in solution are brought together in order then to be produced in a spray drying step as a nanocomposite povwier w^ich can be redispersed In an aqueous me¬dium. The nanoparticles produced in such a way are smaller than 5000 nm, particularly preferably smaller than 250 nm. In addition to therapeutic and diagnostic agents, inter alia, pesticides are also mentioned as possible applications.<br>
Carbohydrates, proteins, inorganic salts, resins or lipids are mentioned as matrix mate¬rials, gelatin, starch, polyvinylpyn-olidone, arabinogalactan, polyvinyl alcohol, poly-acrylic acid, polyethylene, polymethacrylates, polyamide. poly(ethylene-co-vinyl ace¬tate) and shellac being mentioned as resins and celluloses being mentioned as carbo¬hydrates.<br>
Additional components, such as stabilizers and surfactants, have to be added for the redtspersing.<br>
EP-A 0 275 796 reveals a process for the preparation of colloldally dispersible systems by the formation of spherical nanoparticles. The process comprises the dissolution of a first component A in a solvent or mixture of solvents, to which surface-active agents are optionally added, and the preparation of a second solvent or mixture of solvents, which second solvent or mixture of solvents does not dissolve the component A. In addition, surface-active agents are optionally added to the second solvent or mixture of solvents and the second solvent/mixture of solvents is misclble in any proportion with the sol-vent/mi)tture of solvents of the component A. On mixing the solution of the component wflth the second solvent/mixture of solvents in a mixing chamber with control of the mix¬ing and residence time (micronizing), nanoparticles with a size of less than 500 nm are formed. Polymers, fats, fatty acid esters, biologically active substances, pigments, lu¬bricants or dyes are mentioned as possible components A.<br>
WO 98/16105 reveals solid plant protection preparations consisting essentially of one or more predominantiy amorphous solid per se plant protection active compounds with a solubility in water of less than 500 mg/l at 25°C and a coating layer surrounding the active compounds. The preparation is produced by mixing a liquid formulation of the plant protection active compound with a liquid formulation of a coating material and drying the plant protection active compound coated in such a way. Preferred solvents are volatile water-miscible solvents. The dried nanoparticles can be redispersed in aqueous media, the particle sizes are 0.1 to 0.8 micrometer. Surface-active polymeric colloids or oligomeric amphiphilic compounds or mixtures thereof are suitable as coat¬ing layer materials. Biopolymers and modified biopolymers are preferably used. In addi¬tion, synthetic anionic and neuti-al polymers, for example such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrroiidone and polyacrylic add, are suitable.<br><br>
wo 03/039249 refers to a solid plant protection formulation formed from a plant protec¬tion agent and a random radical copolymer which comprises at least one hydrophilic and one hydrophobic monomer as polymerized units and optionally additional addi¬tives. In the aqueous dispersion described, at least 50% of the dispersed particles are found in a state which is amorphous by X-rays. Procationic nifrogen-comprising com¬pounds, such as vinyl-substituted pyridines or aminoalkyl-substituted {meth)acrylamides, are used as hydrophilic monomers.<br>
EP-A0 875 143 reveals pesticidal compositions with a polymer content of 0.01 to 40% by weight in which at least one of the components is a polymer whidi reduces the crys¬tallization of the pesticidal active compound of the composition. The polymers can have a lipophilic or both a lipo- and hydrophilic character. The hy¬drophilic character is fixed by monomer unfts chosen from substituted alky! esters, alkyi Ihioesters and mono- or dialkylamides of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as acrylic acid, methacryllc acid, fumaric add, maleic acid and itaconic acid, sut&gt;-stituted or unsubstituted vinyl esters of Ci-C4-carboxylates, cyclic esters, amides and heterooycles and vinyl-substituted amines.<br>
The lipophilic character is conferred on the polymers by ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as long-chain alkyi esters and mono- or disubstituted alkylamides of acrylic acid, methacryllc acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid or itaconic acid, by a-olefins or vinyl alcohol esters, vinyl halides, vinylnitriles and vinyl carboxylates.<br>

The nanoparticles are formed from an amphiphilic compound with at least one hydrophobic and at least one hydrophilic unit and at least 50 percent by weight of an organic water-insoluble agrochemical substance based on 100 parts of the amphiphilic compound, Amphiphilic diblock copolymers are revealed as compatibilizers.<br>
DE-A 10151392 describes pov^rdered active compound fomulations consisting of a biological active compound, a dispersant, polyvinyl alcohol and if appropriate additives. In this connection, the active compound and the dispersant are suspended in an aque¬ous phase and heated until molten; an emulsion is formed. This emulsion is homoge¬nized witti a jet disperser and is then rapidly cooled until the dispersed melt solidifies. The finely divided dispersion is then treated with an aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution, whereby a film of polyvinyl alcohol is formed which encloses the particles of the disper¬sion.<br>
EP-A 0 875 142 reveals dispersions of plant protection active compounds in agricul¬tural oils and a method for the preparation of these dispersions. The size of the dis¬persed particles is between 0.5 and 10 micrometers. The polymers used to disperse the active compounds consist of from 2.5 to 35% by weight of polar monomers.

The active compound fonnulations according to the invention can comprise different amounts and types of additives, such as, for example, solvents. Thus, solvents can be used, for example, for the preparation of the random radical polymers and of the active compound formulations according to the invention. In an additional embodiment of the invention, the active compound formulations according to the invention can also be present in the form of a fluid solution. Suitable solvents are alcohols, such as, e.g., methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, dipolar aprotic solvents, such as, e.g., DMF, DMSO or NMP, or aromatic, aliphatic, halogenated or nonhalogenated hydrocarbons, such as, e.g., hexane, chlorobenzene, toluene or benzene. Depending on the kind of formulation desired, the solvents can, however, also be removed to the greatest possible extent.<br>
Removed to the greatest possible extent means that the proportion of the solvent re¬maining in the formulation to the total weight of the fomiulation is less than 10, prefera¬bly less than 2 and in particular less than 0.5 percent by weight. The invention accordingly also relates to active compound formulations in a dried and solid form, i.e. a form freed to the greatest possible extent from the solvent. The solid active compound fonnulations can exist in different macroscopic fonms. Men¬tion may be made, as examples of macroscopic forms, of spray-dried powder, ground product, granules or film.<br>
The random radical copolymers present in the active compound formulation according to the invention are suitable for dispersing in aqueous systems, in the form oi nanopar¬ticulate dispersions, the active compound(s) present in ttie active compound formula¬tion according to the invention. Such nanoparticulate dispersions comprise at least one continuous phase, which is an aqueous system in the present invention, and at least one dispersed phase. The nanoparticulate dispersions can comprise additional addi¬tives.<br><br>
For this reason, the present invention likewise relates to aqueous dispersions compris¬ing the active compound formulations according to the invention, an aqueous system and if appropriate additional additives.<br>
Such additives are dispersants, thiciceners, antifoam agents, bactericides and anti¬freeze agents.<br>
Aqueous system is understood as meaning pure water or vrater comprising a buffer system or salts or additional additives, such as, for example, water-miscible solvents or mixtures thereof.<br>
The pH of the aqueous system generally ranges from 2 to 13, preferably from 3 to 12, particularly preferably from 4 to 10.<br>
The invention also relates to processes for the preparation of aqueous dispersions comprising the active compound fonnulations according to tiie invention and optionally additional additives, wherein the active compound formulations according to the inven¬tion are brought into contact with an aqueous system and conventionally dispersed.<br>

Bactericides can be added to stabilize the dispersions according to the invention. Suit¬able bactericides are, for example, Proxel® from ICI or Acticide® RS from Thor Chemie and Kathon* MK from R6hm &amp; Haas.<br>
Suitable antifreeze agents are, e.g., ethylene glycol, propylene glycerol or glycerol.<br>
If appropriate, the dispersions according to ttie invention can, to regulate the pH, com¬prise 1 -5% by weight of buffer based on the total amount of the formulation prepared, the amount and type of the buffer used depending on ttie chemical properties of the active compound or compounds. Examples of buffers are alkali metal salts of weak inorganic or organic adds, such as, e.g., phosphoric acid, boric acid, acetic acid, propi¬onic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, oxalic add and succinic acid.<br>

preparing a combined solution, by presenting the at least one active compound dis¬solved in an organic solvent and adding the at least one random radical copolymer and optionally additional additives and dissolving, and<br>
subsequently removing the solvent or solvents in a conventional vray to the greatest possible e)ctent.<br>
Conventional processes for removing solvents are, for example, spray drying, evapora¬tion under reduced pressure, freeze drying, or evaporation at atmospheric pressure and, if appropriate, increased temperature. The processes suitable for drying further¬more include lyophilization or drying in a fluidized bed dryer. The active compound for¬mulations according to the invention are accordingly obtained in a dried form.<br>
If the copolymer necessary for the synthesis is already present in a solvent, this solu¬tion is preferably enlisted in the mixing with the active compound or active compound<br>
solution.<br>
In a first step, separate solutions of the at least one random radical copolymer and of the at least one active compound in identical or in different solvents are accordingly mixed with one another and additional additives are optionally added. The preparation of a solution of the polymer does not apply if the synthesis of the polymer is carried out in a solvent and this solution is suitable for use in the process for the preparation of the formulation according to the invention.<br>
In this second step, the solvent(s) is/are removed by suitable processes in a conven¬tional way to the greatest possible extent<br>

L.<br>
Water-miscible means in this connection that the organic solvents are miscible with water without phase separation to at least 10% by weight, preferably to 15% by weight, particularly preferably to 20% by weight.<br>
Should an aqueous solution of the copolymer necessary for this synthesis already ex¬ist, this aqueous solution is preferably enlisted in the mixing with the active compound solution.<br>

In addition, the active compound or compounds is/are dissolved in a water-miscible solvent if appropriate with addition of additional additives. The two solutions are then mixed with one another.<br>
Provision of energy is advantageous for the preservation of fine particles on mixing the<br>
aqueous and organic phases, such as, for example, the application of shear forces, by<br>
high-frequency and high-amplitude shaking or high-frequency stinging, turbine agitation,<br>
or by use of a mixing chamber.<br>
The mixing can be earned o,ut in a continuous or batchwise fashion. Continuous mixing<br>
is preferred.<br>
