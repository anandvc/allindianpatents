				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to processes for the preparation of (3R, 5R)-7-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-isopropyl-3-phenyl-4- [(4-hydroxy methyl phenyl amino) carbonyl]-pyrrol-l-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid hemi calcium salt.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
(3R, 5R)-7-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-isopropyl-3-phenyl-4- [(4-hydroxy methyl phenyl amino) carbonyl]-pyrrol-l-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid hemi calcium salt acts an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A- (HMG-CoA) reductase, a coenzyme catalyzing the intracellular synthesis of cholesterol, and thus is useful as hypolipidemic and hypocholesterol-emic agent, as discussed in PCT Publication No. 04/106299.<br>
Cardiovascular disease and its associated maladies, dysfunctions and complications are a principal cause of disability and the chief cause of death. One specific factor significantly contributing to this pathophysiologic process is atherosclerosis, which has been generally recognized as the leading health care problem both with respect to mortality and health care costs.<br>
Atherosclerosis is characterized by the deposition of fatty substances, primarily cholesterol, resulting in plaque formation on the inner surface of the arterial wall and degenerative change to the arteries. It is now well established that cardiovascular disorders including myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, hypertension and hypotension, cerebrovascular disorders including stroke, cerebral thrombosis and memory loss due to stroke; peripheral vascular disease and intestinal infarction are caused by blockage of arteries and arterioles by atherosclerotic plaque. Atherosclerotic plaque formation is multi-factorial in its production. Hypercholesterolemia, especially elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis and associated diseases.<br>
The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been used in reducing blood levels of LDL cholesterol. Cholesterol is produced via the mevalonic acid pathway. Reducing the formation of mevalonic acid, a precursor to cholesterol, leads to a corresponding decrease in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis with a reduction in the cellular pool of cholesterol.<br>
A synthetic procedure for preparing (3R, 5R)-7-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5- isopropyl-3-phenyl-4- [(4-hydroxy methyl phenyl amino) carbonyl]-pyrrol-l-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid hemi calcium salt has been disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 04/106299. The aforementioned procedure involves multiple steps involving selective hydrolysis of two chemically similar functionalities e.g. hydrolysis of methyl ester in the presence of tert. -butyl ester, and reduction with sodium borohydride in the presence of iodine or with borane dimethyl sulphide which are expensive reagents and are air- and moisture-sensitive, hence difficult to handle.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, herein are provided processes for preparing (3R, 5R)-7-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5- isopropyl-3-phenyl-4- [(4-hydroxy methyl phenyl amino) carbonyl]-pvrrol-l-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid hemi calcium salt by using synthetic procedure incorporating particular intermediates.<br>
Further, herein are provided processes which are simple and economical, avoid the use of expensive and air- and moisture-sensitive reagents, and avoid selective hydrolysis of methyl ester in the presence of tert-butyl ester.<br>
