PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of alkyl esters and glycerine simultaneously.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Fatty acid alkyl esters particularly methyl esters derived generally from vegetable oils and fats or animal fats are important intermediates in the manufacture of olefins. Fatty acid methyl esters are also direct substitute for conventional petroleum based diesel and are also known as bio diesel. Besides the benefit of being generated from natural, renewable sources such as new or used vegetable oils and fats or animal fats, they also provide the added benefit of decreased emissions from combustion as compared to the combustion of petroleum based diesel. Biodiesel is thus a clean fuel.<br>
Alkyl esters are prepared by reacting the glycerides and free fatty acids present in the vegetable oils and fats or animal fats with an alcohol in the presence of a base or acid catalyst. The glycerides and free fatty acids are transesterified and esterified, respectively, to form alkyl esters. Base catalysts such as sodium or potassium hydroxides are more frequently used than acid catalysts, as the reaction time for transesterification is shorter in case of base-catalyzed reactions compared to acid-catalyzed reactions reported in the prior art.<br>
However, when a base catalyst is used, the reaction mass is obtained in form of an emulsion. Separation of the alkyl esters from the emulsion is tedious and cumbersome. Besides, the free fatty acids present in the oils or fats react with the base and precipitate as soap thereby reducing the amount of alkyl esters formed i.e. the yield.<br>
To overcome the problem of salt formation of free fatty acids, a two step process has been proposed in WO 02 28811. First step involves acid catalyzed esterification of free fatty acids with an alcohol. The second step involves neutralization of acid catalyst followed by conventional  base-catalyzed transesterification of triglycerides with  an  alcohol.<br>
2<br><br>
However, neutralization of acid results in additional salt-waste and in this process the recovery scheme of residual free fatty acids is cumbersome.<br>
US Patent No 6,768,015 describes a method of making alkyl esters by reacting vegetable oil source including glycerides and / or free fatty acids with methanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. Methanol is used in excess of about 1 to 5 equivalents and acid catalyst used is about 0.0-0.5% preferably 0.1 to about 0.25% by weight. This method employs high temperatures of 80-200°C and pressures of 25 to 500 psia because of which it is expensive, energy consuming and difficult to carry out. It also does not describe the recovery of glycerine formed during the reaction.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of alkyl esters and glycerine simultaneously, which is economical and simple to carry out and also energy saving.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for simultaneous transesterification of glycerides and esterification of fatty acids.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of alkyl esters and glycerin simultaneously, which is of short duration.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of alkyl esters and glycerin simultaneously, which eliminates soap formation and gives increased yield of alkyl esters.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention describes an improved process for the preparation of alkyl esters wherein a substantial advantage over prior art has been attained by carrying out the process under the novel set of parameters and the proportion of raw materials as disclosed hereunder.   Employing this process, simultaneous transesterification and esterification of<br>
3<br><br>
glycerides and fatty acids respectively is possible at atmospheric pressure. The invention obviates the need to conduct reactions of glycerides and fatty acids separately. Moreover, the process of invention requires much less amount of alkanol compared to the processes reported in the prior art.<br>
According to the invention there is provided an improved process for the preparation of alkyl esters and glycerin simultaneously comprising<br>
a)	reacting oils and/or fats with an alkanol in the presence of an acid catalyst under stirring, the weight percentages of alkanol and acid catalyst being 15 to 35 and 1.75 to 5.0 respectively, based on the weight of oils and/or fats, and the reaction being carried out at 40° to 120° C, preferably at 50° to 75° C;<br>
b)	cooling the reaction mixture and allowing it to settle into an ester phase and a glycerin phase;<br>
c)	and recovering the alkyl esters and glycerin from the ester phase and glycerin<br>
phase, respectively.<br>
According to an embodiment of the process, the alkyl esters are recovered from the ester phase by washing the ester phase with water and subjecting it to vacuum distillation to remove unreacted alkanol from the alkyl esters.<br>
According to an embodiment of the process, glycerin is recovered from the glycerin phase by<br>
a)	neutralizing the glycerin phase with a base such as calcium carbonate;<br>
b)	filtering the mixture to remove calcium sulfate formed and excess of calcium carbonate<br>
c)	washing the mixture of calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate with water to recover glycerin adsorbed on it<br>
d)	purifying the wash water containing glycerine by passing through activated charcoal;<br>
4<br><br>
e)	filtering the wash water to remove impurities ; and<br>
f)	subjecting the filtrate to vacuum distillation to remove the water.<br>
The acid catalyst used in the process of the invention is preferably concentrated sulfuric acid of &gt; 90%.-purity.<br>
The alkanol used in the process of the invention is selected from methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol, and is preferably methanol or ethanol.<br>
The base used for neutralization of glycerin phase is selected from compounds which form insoluble sulfate on reaction with sulfuric acid. Preferably the base used is barium or calcium carbonate and most preferably calcium carbonate.<br>
Oils and/or fats used in the process of the invention may be vegetable oils and fats selected from Azadirachta indica (Bitter neem), Sesamum indicum (Sesame), Glycine max (Soyabean), Jatropha curcas (Physic nut), Pongamia pinnata (Indian beech), Brassica napus (Rape seed), Gossypium hirsutum (Cotton seed) animal fats etc.<br>
According to the process of the invention transesterification and esterification are carried out simultaneously at temperature of 50 to 70° using alkanol and acid catalyst in weight percentages of 15 to 35 and 1.75 to 5.0 respectively, based on the weight of oil and/or fat source, to produce alkyl esters and glycerin simultaneously.<br>
Use of alkanol and acid catalyst in the above mentioned weight percentages reduces the reaction time to about 4 Vi hours. The process, therefore, is of short duration. Since base catalyst is not employed, the free fatty acids do not precipitate as soap thereby reducing losses in the process and increasing yield of alkyl esters.<br>
The following experimental examples are illustrative of the invention but not limitative of the scope thereof:<br>
5<br><br>
EXAMPLE - 1<br>
Jatropha oil 1000 gms (Sp.Gr. 0.91, Volume approx 1098 m.l.) and methanol 300 m.l. (Sp.Gr. 0.79, weight 237 gms.) were charged in a glass reactor vessel equipped with condenser and stirring device. 20 m.l. (36 Gms) concentrated sulfuric acid was added to this reaction mass while stirring. The experimental assembly was equipped with temperature indicator and housed in a hot water bath with temperature control mechanism. The reaction mass was heated with the help of hot water bath to the pot temperature of 70°C, and steady reflux of methanol was observed keeping stirring continuous. Temperature and effective stirring was maintained for 4 hrs and 30 minutes. At the end of the reaction, it was cooled down to 30°C.<br>
The reaction mass was transferred to separating funnel and allowed to settle for few minutes till two phases separated clearly. The heavy phase was separated from the bottom, which was attributed to the mixture of glycerin, spent sulphuric acid and excess of methanol.<br>
The upper (lighter) phase was washed with 100 m.l. of water and washings(lower phase) was removed from the bottom of the separating funnel. The resultant product mixture was subjected to vacuum distillation at the temperature of 70°C and Vacuum of 600 mm Hg to remove any methanol or water.<br>
The resultant product was filtered through 10 filter. It was weighing 1002 Gms, Volume 1165 m.l. and Sp.Gr. 0.86.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Example 2 was conducted using the same feed raw materials in the same quantity as in example 1, and using the same reaction conditions.<br>
The reaction mass was then subjected to vacuum distillation for the removal of excess methanol at the end of the reaction. It was then allowed to cool to 30°C, transferred to separating funnel and allowed to settle for few minutes till two phase separated out clearly.<br>
6<br><br>
The heavy phase was separated from the bottom, which was attributed to the mixture of glycerin and spent sulphuric acid. The product mixture (upper phase) was washed with 50 m.l. of water and the washings were removed from the bottom of the separating funnel. The resultant product mixture was subjected to vacuum distillation at the temperature of 70oC and Vacuum of 600 mm Hg to remove any methanol or water remained in the product. The resultant product was filtered through 10m filter. It was weighing 1002 Gms, volume 1164 m.l. and Sp.Gr. 0.86.<br>
The heavy phase separated as mixture of glycerin and spent sulphuric acid was treated with 50 Gms of Barium carbonate to remove acid part. The barium sulphate, with excess of Barium carbonate was separated by filtration, and washed with two 50 m.l. portions of distilled water to remove all glycerin attached to barium sulphate. The resulting dilute glycerin solution was treated with 2 Gms of activated charcoal, filtered and it was subjected to vacuum distillation to remove all water. The product glycerin weight 111 Gms and purity of 96% on G L C.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The procedure as described in example 2 was repeated except Karanja oil i.e. oil from Pongamia pinnata (Indian Beech) was used in place of Jatropha oil. The resultant bio diesel product obtained was weighing 1004 Gms, Volume 1167 m.l. and Sp.Gr. 0.86.<br>
The heavy phase separated as mixture of glycerin and spent sulphuric acid was treated with 25 Gms of dry commercial calcium carbonate to remove acid part. The calcium sulfate formed and excess of calcium carbonate were separated by filtration and washed with two 50 m.l. portions of distilled water to remove all glycerin attached to gypsum. The resulting dilute glycerin solution was treated with 2 Gms of activated charcoal, filtered and it was subjected to vacuum distillation to remove all water. The product glycerin weight 110 Gms and purity of 96% as analyzed by G L C.<br>
7<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The procedure as described in example 3 was repeated except the quantity of methanol was reduced to 200 ml.  The results are given in Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The procedure as described in example 4 was repeated except rapeseed -(Raido) oil i.e. oil of Brassica napus was used in place of Karanja oil. The results are given in Table 1.<br>

EXAMPLES 6-11<br>
Palmitic acid, Stearic acid, and Oleic acids were used as source of free fatty acids for the preparation of fatty acid esters. Esterification was carried out with 1.5 times in excess of stoichiometric amounts of methanol or ethanol. Stoichiometric amount of concentrated sulfuric acid was used as a catalyst. Reaction was carried out maintaining reflux of the alcohol for 4.00 hrs. After removal of un-reacted alcohol in the uppermost phase, phase consisting of fatty acid alkyl esters was washed with distilled water for the removal of any remaining alcohol, dried under vacuum and analyzed by using high performance liquid chromatography. Details of experimental parameters and results thereof are tabulated in table 2.<br>

EXAMPLES 12 - 23<br>
A 500 ml capacity autoclave type PTFE lined reaction vessel made of Stainless Steel 316 was used. The reaction vessel was charged with rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil (Gossypium hirsutum), Neem oil, (Azadirachta Indiaca) or Sesame oil (Sesamum indicum) as a source of triglyceride. Alcohols used were Methanol, Ethanol and n-propanol respectively. Quantity of alcohol used was about two times of the theoretical requirements. The reaction mixture was then heated to the temperature that allowed the pressure to increase up to about 5 atmospheres (5 Kgs per cm2). The vessel was subsequently cooled to stop the reaction. Excess of alcohol was recovered by distillation. After removal of un-reacted alcohol and lower phases consisting of sulphuric acid and glycerol, respectively, product was washed with two small amounts of distilled water to remove any alcohol or glycerol, and dried under vacuum to remove any water. Subsequently the product was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography, and / or / Gas liquid Chromatography using capillary column.<br>
From chromatograms, it was seen that in the prolonged reaction time, (one hr or more) peaks of alkyl esters increased. Subsequently, peaks of un-reacted and intermediate compounds decreased and disappeared, demonstrating the high purity of the alkyl esters formed. Details of experiments are tabulated in Table 3. Weight of product biodiesel from Neem oil was somewhat lower compared to other  oils,   which  may  be because of presence of bitters and other compounds present in the oil.<br>

EXAMPLES 24 to 59<br>
The batch-type glass reactor consists of 1000 ml capacity cylindrical vessel fitted with heating coil magnetic drive for stirrer and condenser were used. The reaction vessel was charged with Jatropha oil (Jatropha Curcas), cottonseed oil (Gossypium hirsutum), or Sesame oil (Sesamum indicum) as a source of triglyceride, mixed with Palmitic acid, Stearic acid or Oleic acid as added fatty acids in the tune of 10 % and 25 % to study the effect of high concentrations of free fatty acids in reaction mixture. Alcohols used were Methanol and Ethanol. Quantity of sulphuric acid as catalyst was calculated as (2% by weight of Oil + 98 Gms per mole of free fatty acid added)<br>
The reaction mixture was then heated to the temperature that allowed the alcohol to reflux for 4 hrs. After removal of un-reacted alcohol, the vessel was subsequently cooled to 30°C and lower phases consisting of sulphuric acid and glycerol was separated from the bottom of the vessel, and product was washed with two small amounts of distilled water to remove any alcohol or glycerol. The product biodiesel was dried under vacuum to remove any water. The product was analyzed during reaction using high performance liquid chromatography, and / or / Gas liquid Chromatography using capillary column.<br>
From chromatograms, it was observed that in the prolonged reaction time, (two hrs or more) area under the peak of alkyl esters increased and, that of un-reacted triglycerides, free fatty acids and intermediate compounds decreased and subsequently the peaks disappeared, demonstrating the high purity of the alkyl esters formed.

EXAMPLE 60:<br>
Experiment was conducted using 30 liters of expelled Ratanjyot oil (Jatropha Curcas) without any pretreatment for the removal of free fatty acids from the same source as used in the previous examples. The oil was charged to a 50 Liter capacity glass reactor cum distillation unit with bottom discharge facility and equipped with heating and cooling facilities and mechanical drive for mixing during the reaction. Condenser system was attached to the reactor vessel to prevent loss of alcohol during transesterification reaction and to recover excess alcohol at the end of the reaction. Provision for the temperature measurement was made to measure pot temperature and vapor temperature. The reactor was provided with the facility for vacuum distillation operation (Fig.l). Details of results of experiment no 60 are tabulated in the Table 5.<br>
EXAMPLE 61 :<br>
The procedure as described in Example 60 was repeated except that a mixture of 15 liters of Jatropha oil and 15 liters of Cottonseed oil was taken as the source of triglycerides and fatty acids. Details of results of experiment no 61 are tabulated in the Table 5.<br>
It is clear from the results given in Table 5 that blend of oil can be used for transesterification without any technical difficulty or significant effect on quantity or quality of the product biodiesel.<br>

The analysis of product obtained in Examples 60 and 61 as shown in Table 6 clearly show that the process for the preparation of monoesters of fatty acids known as biodiesel is practically free from alcohol used for transesterification reaction and by-product glycerin formed during the reaction, thus capable of satisfying international standards of the fuel of the same category.<br>

Moreover, the by-product glycerin separated and washings used to make the biodiesel free of acid catalyst and glycerin was collected in a separate vessel equipped with stirrer. The dilute crude glycerin as obtained in Example 60 and 61 were treated with 6.5 Kg of barium carbonate and 4 Kg of calcium carbonate respectively to neutralize the acid. It was then filtered, washed with water to remove glycerin from BaSO4 or CaSO4 as the case may be, treated with activated charcoal to remove any coloured impurities and was subjected to vacuum at 80-90 oC to remove water. The properties of glycerin are given in Table 7.<br>
