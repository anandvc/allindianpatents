				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present Invention relates to methods and apparatus for forming mesh utilising moujded interlinking link elements. The invention also relates to mesh formed by thfe method of the invention, products incorporating the mesh and methods of qsing the mesh. Where the term "mesh" is used in this specification it means a rne^h formed of interlinking link elements, such as rings.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Mesh formed^ of interlinking link elements is best known In the form of chain mail. Chain mail has traditionally been formed by Interconnecting dosed metal rings with open metal rings and then closing the open rings by a process such as mechanical deformation, welding etc.  In another method split rings formed of spring steel or some other resilient material are used as the interlinking (ink members and are temporarily opened using a tool, such as pliers, to enable interconnection to other link members. In recent times mesh has been formed from plastics material by joining closed rings with open rings and then mechanicallyifastening, welding or gluing the open rings closed.<br>
It has been title-consuming, fabourious and expensive to manufacture chain maii/mesh using traditional methods. Chain mall/mesh including unclosed link elements can only be exposed to Knitted forces before link elements fail. Where the interlinking link elements are closed the joint may detract from the appearance off the finished mesh. Such methods have also limited the materials that may be utilised in the manufacturing of mesh and have limited the practical size of link elements.<br>
Whilst there Nave been complex apparatus for forming mesh by folding sections of wire, to date there has been no automated process for the continuous and economic production of chain mail/mesh for mass-market applications.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An embodiment of the present invention includes a method of forming mesh in which the (ink elements may be in the form of unjoined closed loops. However, the link elements may take many forms including forms having a single aperture therethrough, such as rings, forms having multiple apertures etc.<br>
Referring to figure 1 a method for continuously producing mesh Is described. Preformed ri|Â»gs 1 to 4 are arranged In a first orientation with pairs 1,2 and 3,4 arranged so that portions of their central apertures overlap; Further such pairs<br>
may be provided in a row at spaced intervals In the plane of rings 1 to 4 to form a length of mesh as required. A ring 5 may then be moulded so that it passes through the central apertures of rings 1 to 4 as shown. Ring 6 illustrates how further rings may simultaneously be formed along row.<br>
Referring now to figures 2 and 3 the production of a subsequent row of mesh is described. Ring 3 in figure 1 assumes the position of ring 4 in figure 2 and ring 1 in figure 1 assumes the position of ring 2 in figure 2. Ring 5 in figure 1 assumes the position of ring 7 in figure 2. New rings 3 and 1 are introduced to the positions shown in figure 2. A new ring 5 is moulded through the central apertures of rings 1 to 4. In this way it will be seen that by sequentially introducing a new row of rings 1 and 3 and moulding a new ring 5 through new rings 1 and 3 and old rings 2 and 4 that a mesh may be continuously manufactured, it win be appreciated that this pattern may be extended in either direction to obtain the desired width of mesh.<br>
Referring noijv to figures 4 and 5 a cross-sectional side view of a basic mould for forming a continuous mesh will be described in the context of the arrangement shown in figure 3. The mould consists of mould sections 9,10 and 14 and finger 13. Mould sections 9 and 10 part at mould faces 9b and 10a and mould sections<br>
9	and 10 part from finger 13 at faces 9a, 10b and 14b.  Annular cavity 12 is<br>
dimensionedito retain ring 2 and annular cavity 11 is dimensioned to retain ring 1.<br>
The relative component spacings indicated by the letters B. C and D are<br>
indicated respectively in figures 2 to 4.<br>
A finger 13 of semicircular cross-section defines half of the central aperture of ring 5 to be formed in cavity 15. Plastics may be introduced into the .mould, when dosed as shown in figure 5, to form a ring 5 in cavity 15. Mould sections 9 and<br>
10	may then be moved to the left to open the mould, finger 13 lifted upwards and<br>
mould sections 9 and 10 moved apart to free ring 5 moulded in cavity 15.<br>
To form the next row the ring in cavity 11 is moved to cavity 12, a new ring is placed in cavfty 11, the mould is dosed as shown in figure 5 and a new ring is formed in cavity 15. It will be appreciated that figure 5 shows a section of a mould which may be repeated along the mould to form a continuous row of mesh.<br>
Referring now to figures 6a to 18 an apparatus for continuous mesh production is described. Figures 6a to 6c show the major components of the apparatus including mould sections 30,31 and 32. Mould sections 30 and 31 can separate from mould jsection 32 as seen in figures 6b and 6c. A plurality of fingers, one of which is indicated at 37a move with mould section 30 and are movable vertically with respect thereto. Mould section 30 is movable with respect to mould section 31 to allow moulded link elements to be released as shown in figure 6b. Arm 33<br>
*<br>
is connected to bar 34 (shown in figure 7 and subsequently) which raises and lowers the fingers 37a as roller 35 is guided in slot 36 and section 30 is moved away from section 32.<br>
Referring now to figures 7 to 11 a portion of the working faces of mould sections 30 and 31 are shown. These working faces mey extend to the left and to the right as required to form a desired width of mesh. A plurality of fingers, of which only 37a to $7d are indicated, are secured to bar 34. Bar 34 is connected to arm 35 and raises and lowers fingers 37a to 37d as roller 35 moves in track 36. Figure 9 shows fingers 37a to 37d in their raised position whilst figures 7 and 8 show fingers 37a to 37d in freir lowered position.<br>
Preformed rings are supplied to the apparatus through supply tubes, some of which are indicated at 43a to 43e. Referring to figures 12 to 14 the form of the fingers 37a to 37d is shown. Finger 37a has partial annular cavities 39 and 40 in rear face 38, These cavities 39 and 40 are positioned so that when the fingers 37a to 37d are in the raised position shown in figure 9 rings supplied from supply tubes 43a to 43e may be located: within partial annular cavities 39 and 40 of adjacent fingers. Cavities 39 ami 40 indude biasing elements 49 which urge rings retained therein away from cavities 39 and 40. The end 42 of linger 37a is engaged with bar 34. The distal end 41 is scalloped to assist product exit from the mould.<br>
Referring now to figures 9 and 10 the working faces of mould sections 30 and 31 include cavities 45a to 45e for accommodating preformed rings and cavities 44a to 44e for accommodating rings overlapping those in cavities 45a to 45e. Ejector pins 48a to 48evmove in and out In a direction normal to the page to assist in ejecting ring* as will be described later. Ejector pins 48a to 48e include undercut<br>
sections 47a to 47e which accommodate rings within cavities 45a to 45e when retracted,<br>
Referring now to figure 11 a view along the line B-S Is shown (see figure 10). It can be seen that semicircular cavities 46a to 46e are provided normal to the working face of mould section 31. Semicircular protrusions 55a to 55e which define half tfye circular core of a ring extend from mould section 30 so that when the mould is: dosed half an annular ring is defined by cavities 46a to 46e and protrusions $5a to 55e.<br>
Referring to figures 15 to IS the working face of mould section 32 shown. A plurality of semicircular recesses 51 a to 51 d form the other half of the annular cavities vi-hich form the moulded rings. Fin?ers 37a to 37d locate within cavities 50a to 50d with fingers 37a to 37d defining half of the core of rings formed in the annular cavrfies (the cither half being formed by protrusions 55a to 55e). Injectors 53a to 53d (see figure 18) inject molten material into semicircular cavities 51 a to 51 d through apertures 52a to 52d during moulding. In one embodiment, the material is thermoplastic, in another embodiment, the material Is metal.<br>
Operation of jthe apparatus will now be described with reference to figures 6a to 18. Initially mould sections 30 and 31 are separated from mould section 32 and the fingers am in the raised position shown in figures 6p and 9. Rings contained in supply tubes 43a to 43e ana uiged towards fingers 37a to 37d and are retained within recesses 39 and 40 of respective fingers. Bar 34 is then moved down as mould sections 30 and 31 am moved towards mould section 32, so that the fingers assurhe the positions shown in figure 8. Biasing elements 49 in recesses 39 and 40 urge the rings into recesses 44a to 44e. These rings overlap rings already positioned within recesses 45a to 45e.<br>
Mould sections 30 and 31 are then closed against mould section 32 so that fingers 37a to 37d are accommodated within recesses 50a to 50d (see figure 6a). Mould section 30 is also urged back into mould section 31 as the mould is dosed. When the mould Is dosed recesses 51a to 51 d and 46a to 46d define a disc shaped cavity. Fingers 37a to 37d in conjunction with projections 55a to 55e define a circular core so that a series of annular cavities are defined.<br>
In one embodiment plastics is then injected by injectors-53a to 53d into cavities 51 a to 51 d so that rings are formed in cavities 51 a to 51 d and 46a to 46d. Alternatively, cavities 51 a to 51 d (or another part of the mould cavity for each ring) may be commonly fed with molten material. Mould section 31 is then moved away from mould section 32 (as shown in figure 6b) and simultaneously mould section 30, which is based with respect to mould section 31, moves away from mould; section 31 sufficiently to enable rings formed in the mould to be released from mould section 30.  Mould sections 30 and 31 are then moved further away, as indicated in figure 6c, along with fingers 37a to 37d. As mould sections 30; and 31 are moved away from mould section 32 roller 35 reaches a section in slot 38 where it causes bar 34 to rise. Bar 34 eventually rises to the position shown in figures Be and 9.<br>
At this poinij ejector pins 48a to 48e move in a direction out of the page to eject rings retained wfthin cavities 45a to 45e. However, the rings in recesses 44a to 44e are retained as they are located on top of ejector pins 48a to 46e and behind fingers 37a to 37e.   Fingers 37a to 37e are then partially lowered as mould section 30 is moved towards mould section 32 to retain the rings in recesses 44a to 44e. Ejeftor pins 48a to 46e are then retracted and the rings retained in recesses 44a to 44e then drop into recesses 45a to 45e. Mould sections 30 and 31 then dose with mould section 32 and the apparatus is ready for the next mould cycle.<br>
Although the fink elements are shown to be formed in rows it will be appreciated that other moulding arrangements may be employed. For example adjacent link elements may be offset with respect to one another, it will also be appreciated that the apparatus may be adapted to enable two sheets of mesh to be joined. It will be appreciated that the method of invention may be implemented in many ways.<br>
Following production the mesh may undergo further treatment processes. In the process of "flash flaming" the mesh may be exposed to a hlgh4emperature heat source for a short period of time so that any minor surface imperfections are melted and each rink element has a substantially smooth surface. Further, a coating maylbe applied to the mesh by electroplating, spray painting or some<br>
other coating process. Coatings may be applied to provide physical properties or a particular appearance.<br>
Mash formed by the method of invention may be further processed to form products. A<:mesh may be maintained tn a desired configuration for example by draping the mesh over mould and then heating it so that link elements fuse together cooling linking remain fixed rotative to one anotherforming rigid structure.></:mesh>
Alternatively, the mesh may be maintained in a desired configuration and a satiable composition, such as a resin, is then applied and configuration is maintained until the settabJe material sets to form a rigid structure.<br>
Link elements may be formed of a variety of materials that can exist in a fluid phase and then set, such as plastics, metals, glass, absorbent or non absorbent foams, flexible polymers etc. A mesh may contain a mixture of linking elements formed of different materials. Further, the optical characteristics of link elements may be varied over the mesh to create a pattern or particular visual appearance. For example, different patterns may be created using link elements of different colours and/or transparent link elements.<br>
Link elements may also take a variety of shapes which may be mixed with a mesh. Some examples of closed loop link elements are shown in figures 19A to 19H. Other novelty shapes such as hearts etc may also be used. Further, link elements may have patterns or indida moulded into their surface.<br>
Figure 20 shews another form of fink element in the form of a circular disc 66 having a plurality of apertures 67 to 70 provided therethrough. Rings or other linking elements may be formed through apertures 67 to 70. ft will be appreciated that a wide variety of link element shapes and configurations may be employed as wdl as traditional mesh arrangements utilising 1:3; 1:4 or 1:6 link element layouts.<br>
Mesh formed by the method or apparatus of invention may find use In a wide variety of applications including: filtration; pollution control; signage, flags,<br>
displays etc.; conveyors ; baffles; armour; clothing ; furniture, such as hammocks, deck chairs etc; screens, curtains etc..<br>
It has been found that mesh is particularly effective at collecting materials such as oil from the surface of a fluid, such as water. A mesh formed of link elements formed of absorbent material or including links formed of an absorbent material in may provide additional capacity for oil collection.   The mesh may be provided on a drum or as part of a conveyor system so that collected material may be continuously removed by a washing system or wringer etc..<br>
There is thus provided a quick and economic method and apparatus for the continuous manufacture of mesh using a variety of materials. Mesh having a range of physical and optical properties may be produced. The mesh may have good structural strength and a smooth surface appearance. The method may also allow mesh having small link elements to be produced economically.<br>
