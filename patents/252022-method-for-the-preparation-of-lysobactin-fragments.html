				<td>Methods for the specific preparation of lysobactin fragments<br>
The invention relates to methods for the targeted preparation of lysobactin deriva-<br>
tives by combined chemical and enzymatic modifications. In particular, the inven-<br>
tion relates to a method for preparing lysobactin fragment 4-11 by chemical reduc-<br>
tion and cleavage of the resultant product by chymotrypsin.<br>
Lysobactin is a cyclic depsipeptide which originates from a screening program for<br>
finding novel antibiotics acting in the biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls (O'Sullivan<br>
J. et al. (1988) J. Antibiot. 41 (12), 1740-1744 and Bonner, D. P. et al. (1988) J. Anti-<br>
biot. 41 (12), 1745-1751; Tymiak, A. A. et al. (1989) J. Org. Chem. 54, 1149-1157). It<br>
shows strong activity against Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. An<br>
unusual feature is the high number of non-proteinogenic amino acids in the mole-<br>
cule. In addition to the three B-hydroxyamino acids (2S,3R)-B-hydroxyleucine,<br>
(2S,3R)-B-hydroxyphenylalanine and (2S,3S)-B-hydroxyasparagine, the D-amino acids<br>
D-leucine and D-arginine as well as allo-threonine also occur. This complexity and<br>
the size of the natural product lysobactin are a great hurdle for targeted chemical<br>
modifications.<br><br><br>
It is therefore one object of the present invention to provide novel and alternative<br>
synthesis methods for the targeted synthesis of lysobactin fragments in order to make<br>
the preparation of novel antibiotics using lysobactin fragments possible.<br>
A solution is offered by targeted enzymatic cleavage, targeted enzymatic production<br>
and subsequent linkage of lysobactin fragments in combination with chemical<br>
modification steps, for example hydrogenation.<br>
Enzymatic digestion experiments of lysobactin and the open-chain form obtained by<br>
hydrolysis ("open-chain lysobactin"; compound of formula (I)) with enzymes such as<br>
pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin and mucosal peptidase showed no (such as in the case<br>
of pepsin, for example) or only inadequate enzymatic digestion (R. A. Blackburn et.<br>
al. (1993) Drug Metab. Dispos. 21(4), 573-579). Very slow inefficient enzymatic<br>
cleavage of lysobactin occurs only after the opening of the ring by hydrolysis in the<br>
buffer used. This leads as an unwanted side reaction to side-chain deamidation at the<br>
(2S,3S)-p-hydroxyasparagine. That is the p-hydroxyasparagine unit is converted into a<br>
p-hydroxyaspartate unit.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that the lysobactin fragment 4-11 can be produced<br>
highly efficiently and quantitatively by enzymatic cleavage with chymotrypsin from<br>
dihydrolysobactin (compound of formula (II)) and octahydrolysobactin (compound<br>
of formula (III)) as well as from a mixture of both components. The cleavage takes<br>
place so rapidly that the fragments 1-3 and 4-11 are formed virtually after the com-<br>
bination of the reaction partners (substrate and enzyme). Unwanted side reactions in<br>
the amino acid side chains do not take place.<br><br><br>
Dihydrolysobactin and octahydrolysobactin are obtained by hydrogenolytic opening<br>
of lysobactin with hydrogen, whereby the (2S,3R)-β-hydroxyphenylalanine unit is<br>
converted into a phenylalanine or 3-cyclohexylalanine unit. The resulting lysobactin<br>
fragments dihydrolysobactin and octahydrolysobactin are then used for the enzy-<br>
matic digestion.<br>
Surprisingly, dihydrolysobactin and octahydrolysobactin are also good substrates for<br>
other enzymes, so that other fragments can also be produced in high yield by selec-<br>
tion of the enzyme.<br>
The invention relates to a method for preparing dihydrolysobactin and/or octahydro-<br>
lysobactin, in which lysobactin is converted to dihydrolysobactin and/or ocatahydro-<br>
lysobactin by hydrogenolytic ring opening with hydrogen in the presence of a<br>
hydrogenation catalyst in a solvent.<br>
Hydrogenation catalysts are, for example, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium<br>
and platinum catalysts, or Raney nickel. These catalysts can be used as salts (for<br>
example platinum dioxide, rhodium(III) chloride) or as supported catalysts (for<br>
example palladium on carbon (5-30%) or rhodium on carbon (5%)). Suitable support<br><br><br>
materials for supported catalysts are, for example, activated carbon, kieselguhr, silica<br>
gel, bentonites, kaolin, pumice, aluminosilicates or aluminum oxide. A preferred<br>
support material is activated carbon.<br>
Bimetallic catalysts or else multicomponent catalysts can also be used.<br>
Preference is given to palladium catalysts, for example palladium on carbon (5-30%),<br>
particular preference is given to palladium on carbon (10%).<br>
The hydrogenolytic ring opening generally takes place in a solvent, preferably in a<br>
temperature range from room temperature to 150°C, preferably in a temperature<br>
range from room temperature to 80°C, in an atmospheric pressure range from at-<br>
mospheric pressure to 200 bar, preferably in a pressure range from 3 to 80 bar.<br>
Solvents are, for example, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol, or<br>
mixtures of alcohols with water, or acetic acid or aqueous solutions of acetic acid, or<br>
THF-water mixtures, or dioxane-water mixtures, or else ternary mixtures of the<br>
abovementioned solvents, for example isopropanol-water-acetic acid. Preference is<br>
given to an isopropanol-water mixture.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for preparing lysobactin fragment 4-11 and<br>
lysobactin fragment 1-3, in which dihydrolysobactin and/or octahydrolysobactin are<br>
enzymatically cleaved to give lysobactin fragment 4-11 and lysobactin fragment 1-3.<br>
Preference is given to an enzymatic cleavage of dihydrolysobactin and/or octahydro-<br>
lysobactin, whereby a eukaryotic serine protease or a microbial serine protease is used<br>
as enzyme.<br>
Eukaryotic serine proteases are, for example, chymotrypsin, cathepsin G, chymase or<br>
other enzymes of the chymotrypsin family, or other eukaryotic serine proteases<br>
which cleave after aromatic amino acids, preference is given to chymotrypsin.<br><br><br>
Microbial serine proteases are, for example, subtilisin, proteinase K, Streptomyces<br>
protease A or other enzymes which cleave after aromatic amino acids, preference is<br>
given to subtilisin.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for the enzymatic cleavage of dihydrolyso-<br>
bactin and/or octahydrolysobactin to give smaller lysobactin fragments.<br>
The invention accordingly further relates to a method for preparing lysobactin<br>
fragment 3-11 and/or lysobactin fragment 5-11 and/or lysobactin fragment 4-10<br>
and/or lysobactin fragment 1-9, characterized in that dihydrolysobactin and/or<br>
octahydrolysobactin are enzymatically cleaved to give lysobactin fragment 3-11<br>
and/or lysobactin fragment 5-11 and/or lysobactin fragment 4-10 and/or lysobactin<br>
fragment 1-9.<br>
Preference is given to an enzymatic cleavage of dihydrolysobactin and/or octahydro-<br>
lysobactin, whereby a metalloprotease or a cysteine protease is used as enzyme.<br>
Metalloproteases are, for example, thermolysin or mycolysin.<br>
Cysteine proteases are, for example, papain, bromelain or ficin.<br>
The enzymatic cleavage generally takes place in an aqueous cleavage buffer with<br>
addition of a C1-C4 alcohol or acetonitrile, preferably in a temperature range from<br>
10°C to 40°C, preferably in a pH range from 6 to 9 under atmospheric pressure.<br>
An aqueous cleavage buffer contains, for example, ammonium hydrogencarbonate<br>
and urea, or sodium phosphate, cysteine and EDTA, or sodium tetraborate, or other<br>
additives with which a buffering range of pH 6 to 9 is covered, preference is given to<br>
ammonium hydrogencarbonate and urea.<br><br><br>
The C1-C4 alcohol is, for example, methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, preference is<br>
given to methanol.<br>
Particularly preferably, the enzymatic cleavage takes place in a temperature range<br>
from 30°C to 37°C.<br>
The alcohol concentration in the reaction medium is 0% to 40%, preferably 10% to<br>
15%.<br>
The ratio of enzyme to substrate (dihydrolysobactin and/or octahydrolysobactin) is<br>
1:1 to 1:4000, preferably 1:25 to 1:100.<br>
The invention further relates to the use of lysobactin fragment 4-11 for the synthesis<br>
of lysobactin derivatives.<br>
These lysobactin derivatives are derivatives in which one or more amino acids in the<br>
ring system of lysobactin are replaced.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for preparing open-chain lysobactin<br>
derivatives, in which lysobactin fragment 4-11 is reacted with a tripeptide having a<br>
C-terminal aromatic or hydrophobic amino acid in a buffer medium with addition of<br>
a C1-4-alcohol, whereby the tripeptide is present in the form of the free acid or an<br>
ester and whereby the concentration of the C1-4-alcohol in the reaction medium is<br>
greater than 40%.<br>
The C1-C4 alcohol is, for example, methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, preference is<br>
given to methanol.<br>
Preference is given to a method for the enzymatic synthesis of open-chain lysobactin<br>
derivatives from lysobactin fragment 4-11 and the tripeptide H-D-X-Y-Phe-OR or H-<br><br><br>
D-X-Y-(3-cyclohexyl)Ala-OR in a buffer medium with addition of methanol, whereby<br>
the methanol concentration in the reaction medium is greater than 40%,<br>
R represents hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl, preferably ethyl or methyl, particularly<br>
preferably methyl,<br>
D-X represents a natural or synthetic α-amino acid in the D configuration<br>
and<br>
Y represents a natural or synthetic a-amino acid in the L configuration.<br>
Particular preference is given to a method for the enzymatic synthesis of open-chain<br>
lysobactin derivatives from lysobactin fragment 4-11 and the tripeptide H-D-Leu-Leu-<br>
Phe-OMethyl, H-D-Leu-Leu-Phe-OH, H-D-Leu-Leu-(3-cyclohexyl)Ala-OMethyl or H-<br>
D-Leu-Leu-(3-cyclohexyl)Ala-OH, whereby chymotrypsin is used as enzyme in a<br>
buffer medium with addition of methanol, whereby the methanol concentration in<br>
the reaction medium is greater than 40%.<br>

dorf/Biotronik is used. The separation programs and the function of the analyzer are<br>
extensively described in the instrument handbook (Handbuch des Aminosaureana-<br>
lysators LC 3000 [handbook of the LC 3000 amino acid analyzer], Wissenschaftliche<br>
Gerate GmbH Biotronik, Maintal, 1996).<br>
The reagents used are of biochemical quality and are obtained from Merck (D-<br>
Darmstadt), Fluka (D-Neu-Ulm) or Sigma (D-Deisenhofen).<br>
The molecular weights are determined using a ZQ-1 system from Micromass (Man-<br>
chester, UK). The fragments are thereby separated by means of RP-18-HPLC chroma-<br>
tography (HP1100 system) and the molecular weight is determined by electron spray<br>
ionization (ESI). External calibration is carried out. The calibration and functioning<br>
of the systems are extensively described in the handbook of the instrument.<br><br><br>
The enzymes and chemicals used are of biochemical quality and are obtained from<br>
Fluka, Calbiochem (D-Heidelberg) and Sigma.<br>
The material for the preparative chromatography source 15RPC is obtained from<br>
Amersham Bioscience (D-Freiburg). The preparative separation is carried out using an<br>
AKTA™ system from Amersham Bioscience.<br>

Fermentation:<br>
Culture medium:<br>
YM: yeast-malt agar: D-glucose (4 g/1), yeast extract (4 g/1), malt extract (10 g/1), 1<br>
liter of Lewatit water. Before sterilization (20 minutes at 121°C), the pH is adjusted to<br>
7.2.<br>
HPM: mannitol (5.4 g/1), yeast extract (5 g/1), meat peptone (3 g/1).<br>
Working preserve: The lyophilized strain (ATCC 53042) is grown in 50 ml of YM<br>
medium.<br>
Flask fermentation: 150 ml of YM medium or 100 ml of HPM medium in a 1 1 Erlen-<br>
meyer flask are inoculated with 2 ml of the working preserve and allowed to grow on<br>
a shaker at 240 rpm for 30-48 hours at 28°C.<br><br><br>
30 1 fermentation: 300 ml of the flask fermentation (HPM medium) are used to<br>
inoculate a sterile 30 1 nutrient medium solution (1 ml of antifoam SAG 5693/1). This<br>
culture is allowed to grow for 21 hours at 28°C, 300 rpm and aeration with sterile air<br>
of 0.3 vvm. The pH is kept constant at pH = 7.2 with 1 M hydrochloric acid. In total,<br>
880 ml of 1 M hydrochloric acid are added during the culturing period.<br>
Main culture (200 1): 15 x 150 ml of YM medium in 1 1 Erlenmeyer flasks are inocu-<br>
lated with 2 ml of the working preserve and allowed to grow on the shaker at 28°C<br>
for 48 hours and at 240 rpm. 2250 ml of this culture are used to inoculate a sterile<br>
200 1 nutrient media solution (YM) (1 ml of antifoam SAG 5693/1) and it is allowed to<br>
grow for 18.5 hours at 28°C, 150 rpm and aeration with sterile air of 0.3 wm.<br>
Hourly samples (50 ml) are taken to check the course of the fermentation. 1 ml of<br>
methanol (0.5% trifluoroacetic acid) is added to 2 ml of this culture broth and the<br>
mixture is filtered through a 0.45 µm filter. 30 µl of this suspension are analyzed<br>
means of by HPLC (Method 6 and Method 7).<br>
After 18.5 hours, the culture broth of the main culture is separated into supernatant<br>
and sediment at 17 000 rpm.<br>
Isolation:<br>
The supernatant (183 1) is adjusted to pH 6.5-7 using concentrated trifluoroacetic<br>
acid or a sodium hydroxide solution and loaded onto a Lewapol column (OC 1064,<br>
60 1 contents). Elution is subsequently carried out with pure water, water/methanol<br>
1:1 and subsequently with pure methanol (containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). This<br>
organic phase is concentrated in vacuo to a residual aqueous residue of 11.5 1.<br>
The residual aqueous phase is bound to silica gel C18 and separated (MPLC, Biotage<br>
Flash 75, 75 x 30 cm, KP-C18-WP, 15-20 µm, flow: 30 ml; eluent: acetonitrile/water<br>
containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; gradient: 10%, 15% and 40% acetonitrile). The<br><br><br>
40% acetonitrile phase which contains the main amount of Example 1A, is concen-<br>
trated in vacuo and subsequently lyophilized (about 13 g). This mixture of solids is<br>
separated in 1.2 g portions, first on a preparative HPLC (Method 1), subsequently by<br>
gel filtration on Sephadex LH-20 (5 x 70 cm, acetonitrile/water 1:1, in each case<br>
containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) and a further preparative HPLC (Method 8).<br>
This process yields 2250 mg of Example 1.<br>
The sediment is taken up in 4 1 of acetone/water 4:1, 2 kg of Celite are added, the<br>
mixture is adjusted to pH = 6 using trifluoroacetic acid, stirred and centrifuged. The<br>
solvent is concentrated in vacuo and the residue is freeze dried. The lyophilizate<br>
obtained (89.9 g) is taken up in methanol, filtered, concentrated and separated on<br>
silica gel (Method 9). Example 1A is then purified by gel filtration (Sephadex LH-20,<br>
5 x 68 cm, water/acetonitrile 9:1 (containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid), flow: 2.7<br>
ml/min, fraction size 13.5 ml) to give the pure substance.<br>
This process yields 447 mg of Example 1.<br>

Hydrogenation method 1:<br>
The compound from Example 1 (lysobactin, 250 mg, 170µmol) is dissolved in<br>
isopropanol/water (2:1, 60 ml) and hydrogenated under 1 atm of hydrogen in the<br>
presence of 200 mg of Pd (10% on carbon). The course of the reaction is followed by<br>
means of LC-MS (Method 1). After virtually complete conversion (&gt;95%), the catalyst<br>
is filtered off, washed with isopropanol and the filtrate is lyophilized. In this crude<br>
product, according to LC-MS, the products are distributed as follows: dihydrolysobac-<br>
tin about 74%, octahydrolysobactin about 12%. The residue is purified by HPLC<br>
(Method 2). After lyophilization of the suitable fractions, the pure compound Exam-<br>
ple 2 is obtained (81.5 mg, 31% of theory).<br>
LC-MS: (Method 1): Rt= 1.56 min ES+: m/z = 1279 [M + H]+, 640.1 [M + 2H]2+; ES: m/z<br>
= 1277 [M - H]-, 638.1 [M - 2H]2-<br>
See Table 1 for the peptide sequences of the hydrolysobactins.<br><br><br>
Hydrogenation method 2:<br>
By hydrogenation under a hydrogen pressure of 3 atm, in a method otherwise<br>
identical to hydrogenation method 1, the following distribution in the crude product<br>
determined by LC-MS is obtained: dihydrolysobactin about 80%, octahydrolysobac-<br>
tin about 17%. After HPLC purification (Method 2), the pure compound Example 2 is<br>
obtained (86 mg, 33% of theory).<br>
Hydrogenation method 3:<br>
With a prolonged hydrogenation period at 3 bar hydrogen or using a higher pressure<br>
(up to 80 bar hydrogen pressure), proportionately more octahydrolysobactin can be<br>
obtained. In most cases, the crude mixtures of dihydro- and octahydrolysobactin are<br>
not separated, but are used directly in the enzymatic cleavage.<br>
Hydrogenation method 4:<br>
In the following case the compound octahydrolysobactin is also isolated in pure<br>
form:<br>
Lysobactin (Example 1, 1.04 g, 0.69 mmol) is dissolved in isopropanol/water (2:1,<br>
90 ml) and hydrogenated under 3 atm hydrogen for 7 days in the presence of 200 mg<br>
of Pd (10% on carbon). The catalyst is filtered off, washed with isopropanol and the<br>
filtrate is freed from isopropanol on a rotary evaporator and then lyophilized. In this<br>
crude product the products are distributed according to LC-MS (Method 1) as follows:<br>
dihydrolysobactin about 65%, octahydrolysobactin about 35%. The residue is puri-<br>
fied by HPLC (Method 2, subsequently Method 3). Dihydrolysobactin (Example 2)<br>
(280 mg, 27% of theory) and octahydrolysobactin (Example 3) (212 mg, 20% of<br>
theory) are obtained.<br><br><br>
LC-MS: (Method 1): R,= 1.63 min ESIpos.: m/z = 643.3 (100) [M + 2H]2+; ESIneg.: m/z<br>
= 1283 [M - H]-, 641.2 [M - 2H]2-.<br>
Hydrogenation method 5:<br>
As an example of a hydrogenation under high pressure hydrogen, after 4 days at<br>
40°C and 50 bar hydrogen, the following crude mixture is obtained according to LC-<br>
MS (Method 1): 45% dihydrolysobactin and 45% octahydrolysobactin.<br>
Hydrogenation method 6:<br>
Lysobactin bistrifluoroacetate (Example 1, 500 mg, 0.33 mmol) is dissolved in iso-<br>
propanol/water 2:1 (30 ml). Under an argon protective gas atmosphere, 10 percent<br>
palladium on carbon (100 mg) is added. The reaction mixture is stirred (after de-<br>
gassing) in a pressure autoclave at 80-70 bar hydrogen and RT for 48 h. 10% palla-<br>
dium on carbon (100 mg) is again added to the reaction. The reaction mixture is<br>
(after degassing) again stirred in a pressure autoclave at 80-70 bar hydrogen and RT<br>
for 48 h. Now no lysobactin is detectable any more by means of HPLC (for example<br>
Method 4). The reaction mixture is filtered through a glass frit (pore size 2 or 3),<br>
concentrated in vacuo, again taken up in methanol/0.2% glacial acetic acid, filtered<br>
through a syringe filter (Biotage, PTFE), concentrated in vacuo and dried under high<br>
vacuum. 496 mg (quant.) of product (80% dihydrolysobactin, 20% octahydrolysobac-<br>
tin) are obtained.<br>
Hydrogenation method 7:<br>
Lysobactin monotrifluoroacetate monoacetate (5 mg, 3.45 µmol) is hydrogenated in<br>
a mixture of isopropanol (2 ml), water (0.25 ml) and acetic acid (0.05 ml) in the<br>
presence of platinum dioxide (20 mg) at 80 bar and 50°C. After 17 h, the pressure is<br>
relieved, the system is vented with argon and the suspension freed from the catalyst<br><br><br>
by means of a microfilter. LC-MS analysis of the filtrate (Method 4) shows 7% of<br>
theory octahydrolysobactin (Rt = 1.54 min, Method 4).<br>
Hydrogenation method 8:<br>
Lysobactin bistrifluoroacetate (Example 1A, 10 g, 6.65 mmol) is dissolved in isopro-<br>
panol/water 9:2 (110 ml). Under an argon protective gas atmosphere, palladium on<br>
carbon (10%; 5 g) is added. The reaction mixture (after degassing) is stirred in a<br>
pressure autoclave at 80-70 bar hydrogen pressure and 40°C for 12 h. Palladium on<br>
carbon (10%; 5 g) is again added to the reaction. The reaction mixture (after de-<br>
gassing) is again stirred in a pressure autoclave at 80-70 bar hydrogen pressure and<br>
40°C for 12 h. The reaction mixture (after degassing) is once again stirred in a pres-<br>
sure autoclave at 80-70 bar hydrogen pressure and 40°C for 12 h. Now no lysobactin<br>
is detectable any more by means of analytical HPLC (Method 10). The reaction<br>
mixture is filtered through kieselguhr, concentrated in vacuo and dried under a high<br>
vacuum. 9.17 g (99% of theory) of product (60% dihydrolysobactin, 40% octahydro-<br>
lysobactin) are obtained.<br>
Hydrogenation method 9:<br>
Lysobactin bistrifluoroacetate (Example 1A, 5 g, 3.32 mmol) is dissolved in isopropa-<br>
nol/water 9:2 (110 ml). Under an argon protective gas atmosphere, palladium on<br>
carbon (10%; 5 g) is added. The reaction mixture (after degassing) is stirred in a<br>
pressure autoclave at 80 bar hydrogen pressure and 40°C for 12 h. The reaction<br>
mixture is filtered through kieselguhr, concentrated in vacuo and dried under high<br>
vacuum. The hydrogenation is repeated a further three times each time using 5.0 g of<br>
lysobactin bistrifluoroacetate (in total: 4 passes). As combined product fraction<br>
18.27 g of product (dihydrolysobactimoctahydrolysobactin, about 5:4) are obtained.<br><br><br>

N-terminal sequence analysis<br>
3 nmol of fragments dissolved in 60% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA are loaded onto a<br>
sequencer sheet which is preincubated with PolybrenR. The proteins are sequenced<br>
using the usual sequencer cycle. The PTH-amino acids are identified by means of<br>
online HPLC using a 40 pmol PTH standard. The non-proteinogenic amino acids are<br>
identified by their relative position to the standard amino acids. The purity of the<br>
peptides is estimated from the amino acid of the 1st PTH cycle. The various peptides<br>
are sequenced over 4 to 12 stages. Tables 1 to 7 show the protein sequences deter-<br>
mined.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Example 29<br>
Amino acid analysis<br>
Amino acid analysis is an important qualitative and quantitative parameter for<br>
characterizing proteins. In addition to the protein content, in the case of known<br>
primary structure, the number of the individual amino acids is determined. The<br>
amino acid analysis of lysobactin derivatives and peptide fragments is in good<br>
agreement with the theoretical values from the primary structure (Table 8). Non-<br>
proteinogenic amino acids are only quantified in the presence of corresponding<br>
standards.<br>
100 ug of the lysobactin derivatives and peptide fragments are dissolved in 200 ul of<br>
6 N hydrochloric acid and hydrolyzed at 166°C for 1 h. About 5 nmol of the samples<br>
are introduced into the amino acid analyzer. The amount of amino acid is deter-<br>
mined via a 4 nmol amino acid standard.<br>

Example 30<br>
Reverse-phase chromatography<br>
In the HPLC chromatography of proteins on chemically bound reversed phases, a<br>
bond to the phase used is formed via a hydrophobic interaction of the proteins. The<br>
peptides are displaced by organic solvents (mobile phase) according to the strength<br>
of their bond to the stationary phase. For this reason, this method is a good criterion<br>
for assessing the purity of a peptide and for monitoring the rate of enzymatic cleav-<br>
age and the resulting cleavage products. The peptides dihydrolysobactin and octa-<br>
hydrolysobactin elute from the RP-18 phase at about 35 min and about 38 min,<br>
fragment 4-11 at about 16 min, 1-3 (LLF) at about 31 min and 1-3 (LLA(3-cyclo-<br>
hexyl)) at about 37 min. Figure 1 shows the time course of a preparative enzymatic<br>
cleavage with chymotrypsin (Example 11).<br>
About 20 ug of the enzymatic cleavage products and the starting compounds dihy-<br>
drolysobactin and octahydrolysobactin or the mixture are chromatographed on a<br>
Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm; 3.5 µm material; 300 angstrom pore<br>
diameter). The eluent used is an acetonitrile/TFA gradient. Conditions: solvent A<br>
0.1% TFA, solvent B 60% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA; flow 0.7 ml/min, column tempera-<br>
ture 40°C, UV detection 210 nm, solvent A 0.1% TFA, solvent B 0.1% TFA/60% aceto-<br>
nitrile; gradient: 0 min 0% B, 2 min 10% B, 50 min 80% B, 52 min 100% B, 55 min<br>
0% B, 60 min 0% B.<br>
Example 31<br>
Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)<br>
Capillary electrophoresis permits the separation of peptides and proteins on the basis<br>
of their charge in an electrical field. The quality of the separation depends on the<br>
buffer, the pH, the temperature and the additives used. The capillaries used are so-<br><br>
called fused silica columns having an internal diameter of 50-100 µm. This method is<br>
a very good criterion for assessing the purity of a peptide and for monitoring the<br>
formation of enzymatic cleavage products. The peptides dihydrolysobactin and<br>
octahydrolysobactin elute from the capillary column at about 21 min, fragment 4-11<br>
at about 18 min, 1-3 (LLF) at about 24 min, 1-3 (LLA(3-cyclohexyl)) at about 22 min,<br>
the deamidated forms as a double peak at about 30 min (1-11) and 24 min (4-11).<br>
Figure 2 shows the time course of an enzymatic cleavage of octahydrolysobactin with<br>
chymotrypsin (Example 5). The great increase in deamidated products after 24 h in<br>
the buffer can clearly be seen.<br>
About 4 ng of the enzymatic cleavage products or the starting compounds dihydroly-<br>
sobactin and octahydrolysobactin, or the mixture, are investigated by means of<br>
capillary electrophoresis on a glass column (length 72 cm, internal diameter 50 µm).<br>
Conditions: current 90 µA, column temperature 25°C, 100 mM phosphate buffer pH<br>
3.0, UV detection 210 nm, loading under pressure 3 seconds.<br>
Example 32<br>
Molecular weight determined by HPLC-ESI-MS<br>
Peptides and enzymatic cleavage products are separated by RP-18-HPLC chromatog-<br>
raphy and the molecular weight is determined by electron spray ionization (ESI).<br>
About 100 ug of chymotrypsin cleavage of the mixture of dihydrolysobactin and<br>
octahydrolysobactin are separated with a Zorbax C18-HPLC column under the<br>
following conditions: solvent A 0.1% TFA, solvent B 60% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA; flow<br>
0.7 ml/min, column temperature 40°C, UV detection 210 nm, solvent A 0.1% TFA,<br>
solvent B 0.1% TFA/60% acetonitrile; gradient: 0 min 0% B, 2 min 10% B, 50 min<br>
80% B, 52 min 100% B, 55 min 0% B, 60 min 0% B. The peptides are transferred to<br>
the atmospheric pressure ion source of the mass spectrometer and ionized there.<br><br>
From there the ions are transferred to the high vacuum region of the mass spec-<br>
trometer and detected. Table 9 shows the molecular weights determined.<br><br>
Example 33<br>
Preparative chymotrypsin cleavage of the mixture dihydro/octahydrolysobactin<br>
18.27 g of dihydro- and octahydrolysobactin (about 5:4) are dissolved in 365 ml of<br>
methanol and diluted to 3654 ml with chymotrypsin (731 mg) and cleavage buffer.<br>
The reaction is carried out for 30 min at 37°C and then stopped with 20 ml of TFA<br>
and 150 ml of acetonitrile. Before the addition of the enzyme, the solutions are<br>
warmed to 37°C in a drying cabinet. Aliquots of 200 ul are taken after 0 and 0.5 h<br>
and the enzyme cleavage is stopped with 200 ul of 0.1% TFA in 30% acetonitrile/70%<br>
water. The samples are analyzed by HPLC (retention time fragment 4-11 about<br>
3.6 min., fragment 1-3 (LLF) about 9.6 min., fragment 1-3 (LL(hexahydro)F) about<br>
11.3 min.) (eluent A: 0.1% TFA in water, eluent B: 0.1% TFA in 60% acetonitrile/40%<br>
water, gradient: 0 min 30% B, 10 min 80% B, 11 min 100% B, 12 min 30% B, 15 min<br>
30% B; flow: 0.7ml/min, column temperature: 40°C, detection: 210 nm). Alterna-<br><br>
tively, method 11 is used. The solution is divided into 9 x 500 ml portions and frozen<br>
at -70°C until preparative RP separation. Fragment 4-11 is isolated by preparative<br>
HPLC in several runs.<br>
Preparative separation of fragments 1-3 and 4-11:<br>
About 800 ml of the cleavage solution are filtered through a cartridge (0.2 um) and<br>
chromatographed in two portions of about 400 ml on a Source 15RPC column<br>
(column size: 2360 ml) using a methanol/TFA gradient. Eluent A: 0.1% TFA in water,<br>
eluent B: 0.1% TFA in 100% methanol; flow: 30 ml/min.; detection 215 nm. The<br>
gradient is run according to column volumes: after application, the column is<br>
washed with 3.6 column volumes of eluent A, and then in 18 column volumes to<br>
45%B, in 0.67 column volumes to 100%B, 1.3 column volumes 100%B, in 0.67 to<br>
0%B, 7 column volumes of eluent A for equilibration.<br>
10.36 g (77% of theory) of fragment 4-11 are obtained as product.<br>
HPLC/UV-Vis (Method 4): R, = 0.5 min.<br>
LC-MS (Method 1): R, = 1.0 min;<br>
MS (ESIpos.): m/z (%) = 453.6 (100) [M + 2H]2+, 906 (10) [M + H]+.<br>
