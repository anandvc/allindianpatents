				<td>BOBBIN CARRYING APPARATUS IN FINE SPINNING MACHINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a bobbin carrying apparatus in a fine spinning machine, and in particular, to a bobbin carrying apparatus in a fine spinning machine that carries empty bobbins and full bobbins using peg trays on which a peg protrudes from the top surface.<br>
In general ring fine spinning machines, a carrying apparatus for carrying out doffed full bobbins and placing empty bobbins along a spindle rail in such a state as to correspond to the spindle pitch in order to facilitate the operation of automatic exchange by the bobbin exchanging apparatus is necessary. Conventional bobbin carrying apparatuses for carrying empty bobbins and full bobbins using peg trays on which a peg protrudes from the top surface have been implemented. In these apparatuses, first and second transporting devices are provided so as to extend along left and right sides in the longitudinal direction of the lower portion of the fine spinning machine. A connection portion for connecting two carrying apparatuses is provided a side of the fine spinning machine that corresponds to the first end portion. A full bobbin discharging portion and an empty bobbin supplying apparatus are provided a side of the fine spinning machine that corresponds to the second end portion. In this apparatus, full bobbins are pulled off from the peg trays and empty bobbins are inserted so as to be placed in locations corresponding to the spindles while the peg trays move around the guide rail through the operation of a driving apparatus after the completion of doffing, together with the filling of bobbins. First and second transporting devices are provided with a transporting member (transporting rail) which reciprocates by means of air cylinders, and intermittently<br><br>
move with the peg trays by a predetermined amount at a time.<br>
In addition, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 64 -85332 discloses a configuration where fine spinning machines provided with bobbin transporting devices in which peg trays move by a predetermined pitch in the longitudinal direction of the machine as a result of the reciprocating movement of the transporting member on left and right sides are aligned in series. A pair of guide rails for connecting the above described bobbin transporting devices are provided between the fine spinning machines. One peg tray movement path is shared by the number of spinning machines. In addition, according to the above described publication, the bobbin transporting device provided downstream in the direction in which the peg trays progress is operated so that forward movement of the transporting member of the transporting device is started, and after that the transporting member of the bobbin transporting device provided upstream is moved forward so that full bobbins and empty bobbins are transported.<br>
When the transporting devices provided so as to extend on the left and right sides of the fine spinning machines are driven so that full bobbins are carried out and empty bobbins are carried in, the load on the exit side and the load on the entry side change. The transporting rail is driven by an air cylinder, and therefore, the speed of the transporting rail changes, due to the loads. The longer the machine is, the more the balance in the load is lost between the side on which the bobbins are carried out and the entry side. The transporting device is formed in such a'manner that a connection portion for guiding peg trays from the entry side to the exit side is provided on one end of the machine (gear end), so that peg trays make a U-turn and are fed to the exit side. When the balance in the loads is lost, however, the<br><br>
speed of the transporting rail on the entry side exceeds the speed of the transporting rail on the exit side, and thus, peg trays on the entry side push the peg trays on the exit side, and as a result, the pitch of the peg trays becomes inaccurate and the feeding claw fails to catch peg trays, causing clogging. The greater the number of spindles of the fine spinning machines is, the more often this problem occurs-The number of spindles of one fine spinning machine used to be approximately 200 on one side, but in recent years, the number of spindles has increased. Some machines have 500 to 600 spindles on one side, and the above described problem becomes significant in machines provided with such a great number of spindles.<br>
The above described publication proposes that the bobbin transporting device provided downstream in the direction in which peg trays progress operate so that forward movement of the transporting member of the transporting device is started, and after that the transporting member of the bobbin transporting device provided upstream moves forward so as to transport full bobbins and empty bobbins, that is to say, there is a constant time lag (of 0.1 seconds) between the drive of the downstream transporting member and the drive of the upstream transporting member. According to this publication, the reason for the time lag is as follows. There is inconsistency in the starting properties of air cylinders in general, and therefore, there is inconsistency in the startup of the number of air cylinders, even when they receive an operation signal at the same time. In the case where an upstream air cylinder operates before an air cylinder located downstream operates, unintended force is applied to the air cylinders, and in addition, the transportation of peg trays is hindered. Therefore, the above described time lag is necessary. That is to say, no consideration is taken in the above described publication of<br><br>
change in the speed of the transporting member, which hinders the carrying of bobbins, due to the fluctuation in the load caused by change in the number of full bobbins and empty bobbins that are inserted on peg trays moved by the transporting members on the left and right during transportation, even when the air cylinders start operating normally, which is the problem to be solved by the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An objective of the present invention is to provide a bobbin carrying apparatus in a fine spinning machine that is capable of carrying bobbins without hindrance even when the load on the exit side and the load on the entry side change, in the case where full bobbins are carried out and empty bobbins are carried in using peg trays that move as a result of the reciprocating movement of the moving member.<br>
To achieve the foregoing objective and in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a bobbin carrying apparatus in a fine spinning machine is provided. The apparatus includes first and second transporting devices, a connection portion, first and second solenoid valves, and a control portion. The first and second transporting devices are provided on left and right sides of the fine spinning machine. Each of the first and second transporting devices includes a peg tray path which extends in the longitudinal direction of the fine spinning machine, a transporting member which can reciprocate along the peg tray path in order to move peg trays by a predetermined pitch, and an air cylinder for reciprocating the transporting member. The air cylinder for the first transporting device is a first air cylinder and the air cylinder for the second transporting device is a second air cylinder. The connection portion connects the<br><br>
first and second transporting devices at a first end of the fine spinning machine in order to move peg trays from the first transporting device to the second transporting device. The first and second solenoid valves individually correspond to the first and second air cylinders. The control portion controls the first and second solenoid valves in such a manner that the point in time when the first air cylinder starts operating is delayed relative to the point in time when the second air cylinder starts operating. First and second operating period sensing portions for sensing the period during which the first and second air cylinders operate, respectively, are provided. The control portion corrects the difference between the points in time when the first and second air cylinders start operating in accordance with the fluctuation in the operating period sensed by the two operating period sensing portions in such a manner that peg trays on the first transporting device do not apply a pressing force to peg trays on the second transporting device.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method for carrying bobbins in a fine spinning machine is provided. The fine spinning machine includes first and second transporting devices, a connection portion, and first and second solenoid valves. The first and second transporting devices are provided on left and right sides of the fine spinning machine. Each of the first and second transporting devices has a peg tray path which extends in the longitudinal direction of the fine spinning machine, a transporting member which can reciprocate along the peg tray<br>
  path in order to move peg trays by a predetermined pitch, and an air cylinder for reciprocating the transporting member. The air cylinder for the first transporting device is a first air cylinder and the air cylinder for the second transporting device is a second air cylinder. The connection portion<br>
  connects the first and second transporting devices at a first<br><br>
end of the fine spinning machine in order to move peg trays from the first transporting device to the second transporting device. The first and second solenoid valves individually correspond to the first and second air cylinders. The method includes: controlling the first and second solenoid valves so that the point in time when the first air cylinder starts operating is delayed compared to the point in time when the second air cylinder starts operating, after the completion of doffing of bobbins; sensing the operating periods of the two respective air cylinders, and correcting the difference between the points in time when the first and second air cylinders start operating in accordance with the fluctuation of the sensed operating periods of the two air cylinders so that peg trays on the first transporting device do not apply a pressing force to peg trays on the second transporting device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the following, a first embodiment of the present invention is described in reference to Figs. lA to 4C. As shown in Fig. lA, first and second transporting devices Tl and T2 are provided on the left and right sides of a fine spinning machine 11 in such a manner as to extend in the longitudinal direction of the fine spinning machine 11. A first connection portion 13 for moving peg trays 12 from the first transporting device Tl to the second transporting device T2 is provided on a first end {an end adjacent to a gear end GE) of the fine spinning machine 11. A second connection portion 14 for moving peg trays 12 from an end portion of the second transporting device T2 to an end portion of the first transporting device Tl is provided on a second end portion (an end adjacent to an out end OE) of the spinning machine. As shown in Fig. 2B, a circular engagement<br><br>
recess 12a is created on the lower surface of a peg tray 12, and a peg 12b on which a bobbin B is inserted protrudes from the upper surface of the peg tray 12.<br>
The two transporting devices Tl and T2 are formed in basically the same manner as the transporting device disclosed in for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2000-96354, and as shown in Fig. 2B, provided with a pair of transporting rails 15, which are transporting members, a guide cover 16, which is a guide member, and a positioning member 17. The guide cover 16 forms a peg tray path which prevents peg trays 12 mounted on the transporting rails 15 from shifting to the side relative to the direction of movement. The positioning member 17 extends in the longitudinal direction of the transporting rails 15 and is provided inside the transporting rails 15. A number of engagement protrusions 17a which are engagement portions that engage with engagement recesses 12a are formed so as to be serrated at intervals which are the same as the spindle pitch in the positioning member 17. The positioning member 17 is supported via a plate spring 19 in such a manner as to be movable upward and downward, so that the respective engagement protrusions 17a are positioned in such a state as to be inside the engagement recesses 12a in locations corresponding to the spindles 18. The positioning member 17 allows peg trays 12 to move forward (direction in which peg trays 12 are fed), and prevents backward movement (direction in which peg trays 12 return) .<br>
The transporting rails 15 are supported in such a state as to be engaged with the guide grooves 20a created on the upper surface of a bracket 20 inside the guide cover 16, in such a manner as to be reciprocatory along the spindle column. The transporting rails 15 are formed in such manner that peg trays 12 can be mounted in such a state as to be aligned in<br><br>
one column. The engagement protrusions 15a (shown in Fig. 2A) protrude from the upper surface of the transporting rails 15 at predetermined intervals which are the same as the diameter of the peg trays 12, that is to say, at intervals equal to the spindle pitch. The engagement protrusions 15a engage with the outer peripheral surface of the peg trays 12 when the transporting rails 15 move forward (when moving in the direction in which the peg trays 12 are fed),   so  that peg trays 12 all move  together, while the relative movement between the peg trays 12 and the transporting rails 15 is prevented. The engagement protrusions 15a are formed so as to push up peg trays 12 in such a state that movement is prevented as a result of the function of the above described engagement protrusions 17a, and pass beneath the peg trays 12 when the transporting rails 15 move backward (when moving in the direction opposite to the direction in which peg trays 12 are fed, that is to say, when returning).<br>
The transporting rails 15 are connected to piston rods 21a and 22a of air cylinders 21 and 22 which are provided beneath the transporting rails 15 via connection members (not shown) on an end (on the out end OE in this embodiment) of the fine spinning machine 11.  In the air cylinders 21 and 22, the strokes are set so as to be slightly greater than several times the spindle pitch (four times in this embodiment), so that the transporting rails 15 reciprocate in strokes which are slightly greater than four times the spindle pitch along the spindle column, as a result of operation of the air cylinders 21 and 22. In addition, the first transporting device Tl moves peg trays 12 from the out end OE to the gear end GE while the second transporting device T2 moves peg trays 12 from the gear end GE to the out end OE. Although the respective air cylinders 21 and 22 are provided beneath the guide cover 16, Fig. lA shows them to the side of the guide cover 15 for the sake of convenience, and they are shown as<br><br>
being located closer to the center of the fine spinning machine 11 than the outer end OE in the longitudinal direction of the fine spinning machine 11.<br>
The first connection portion 13 is provided between the two transporting devices Tl and T2 and in approximately U shape in a plan view with the two ends in approximately arc form, so that it becomes possible for the peg trays 12 to smoothly move between the two transporting devices Tl and T2. As shown in Fig. 2A, the first connection portion 13 is provided with a base plate 24 for supporting the peg trays 12 in such a manner that they are slidable, and guide bars 26 which are supported above the base plate 24 with brackets 25. The guide bars 2 6 make contact with boss portions 12c of the peg trays 12 so as to regulate the direction of movement. The base plate 24 is provided in such a manner that the upper surface is at the same level as the upper surface of the transporting rails 15.<br>
Support portions {not shown) for supporting and holding four peg trays 12 when the transporting rails 15 move toward the second end portion are provided in locations which respectively correspond to the outlet portion Tla of the first transporting device Tl and the inlet portion T2a of the second transporting device T2. The support portions are formed integrally with the base plate 24 and protrude from the two end portions of the base plate 24 so as to extend between the transporting rails 15. For the sake of convenience, in the state shown in Figs. lA and 2A, the length of the first connection portion 13 is different.<br>
The second connection portion 14 is provided with a guide path 27 for guiding peg trays 12 from an end portion of the second transporting device T2 to an end portion of the first transporting device Tl in such a manner that the two<br><br>
are slidable. The guide path 27 is in approximately U shape in a plan view, and formed of straight line portions which are respectively aligned with the first and second transporting devices Tl and T2, a straight line portion 27a which extends in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the fine spinning machine 11, and arc portions for connecting these. The guide path 27 is provided with a base plate for supporting peg trays 12 in such a manner that they are slidable, and a guide plate which is supported above the base plate with poles (not shown), and engages with the boss portions 12c of the peg trays 12 so as to regulate the direction of movement. The base plate is provided in such a manner that the upper surface is at the same level as the upper surface of the transporting rails 15.<br>
In addition, the second  connection portion 14 is provided with support portions (not shown) for supporting and holding four peg trays 12 when the transporting rails 15 move toward the first end portion of the fine spinning machine 11 in locations which respectively correspond to the inlet portion T1b of the first transporting device Tl and the outlet portion T2b of the second transporting device T2. The support portions are formed integrally with the base plate and protrude horizontally from the end portions of the base plate so  as to extend between the transporting rails 15.<br>
A full bobbin removing portion (not shown) is provided in the straight line portion, in the vicinity of the inlet of the second connection portion 14, and a belt conveyor 30 for conveying bobbins out is provided along the fine spinning machine 11, to the side of the full bobbin removing portion. The full bobbin removing portion is formed in the same manner as that described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2000-96364, for example, and engages with the bottom of bobbins B which are inserted on the peg trays 12 which move<br><br>
as a result of the function of the second transporting device T2, so that the bobbins B are removed from the pegs 12b as the peg trays 12 move and discharged onto the belt of the belt conveyor 30.<br>
An empty bobbin supplying portion (not shown) for supplying empty bobbins to the peg trays 12 from which bobbins B have been removed is provided above the straight line portion 27a of the guide path 27. The empty bobbin supplying portion is also formed in the same manner as that described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2000-96364.<br>
A turntable 31 is provided in a portion in the middle of the guide path 27 which corresponds to the arc portion on the first transporting device Tl. The level of the upper surface of the turntable 31 is set so as to be the same as the upper surface of the base plate. The turntable 31 is driven and rotated by a motor (not shown) in such a direction that the peg trays 12 on the turntable 31 move toward the first transporting device Tl,<br>
As shown in Fig. 1B, air cylinders 21 and 22 are connected to solenoid valves 32 and 33 via pipes 32a and 32b, and 33a and 33b, respectively. The solenoid valves 32 and 33 are connected to a compressed air supply 36 via a pipe 34 and a regulator 35. Speed controllers 37 are respectively provided to the pipes 32a, 32b, 33a and 33b.  The speed controllers 37 are formed like throttle valves, so that the speed of the flow of compressed air that flows through the pipes 32a, 32b, 33a and 33b can be adjusted through manual operation. The speed controllers 37 are adjusted in trial operation so that the period during which the air cylinder 22 on the exit side makes one stroke is, for example, 6 seconds, and the period during which the air cylinder 21 on the entry<br><br>
side makes one stroke is, for example, 6.6 seconds, when only empty peg trays 12 are being carried. The difference in time of 0.6 seconds between the entry side and the exit side corresponds to the difference in time when operation is started between the two air cylinders 21 and 22.<br>
The solenoid valves 32 and 33 are operated through instruction from a control device C, which is a control portion, so as to be switched between a state where air cylinders 21 and 22 are driven to the side to which peg trays 12 are fed and a state where the cylinders 21 and 22 are driven toward the returning side.<br>
The air cylinders 21 and 22 are provided with sensors Sla and S2a'for sensing whether piston rods 21a and 22a are in a receded state and sensors S1b and S2b for sensing whether the piston rods 21a and 22b are in a protruding state. The respective sensors Sla, S2a, S1b and S2b are electrically connected to the control device C. The control device C controls the solenoid valves 32 and 33 on the basis of output signals from the respective sensors Sla, S2a, S1b and S2b. The sensors Sla and S1b form a first operating period sensing portion for sensing the operating period of the air cylinder 21, and sensors S2a and S2b form a second operating period sensing portion for sensing the operating period of the air cylinder 22.<br>
The control device C controls the solenoid valves 32 and 33 so that the point in time when the air cylinder 21 of the first transporting device Tl starts operating is delayed compared to the point in time when the air cylinder 22 of the second transporting device T2 starts operating. The control device C calculates the period during which the air cylinders 21 and 22 operate (operation speed) from the signals outputted from the sensors Sla, S2a, S1b and S2b. In addition.<br><br>
the difference between the points in time when the two air cylinders 21 and 22 start operating is corrected in accordance with the fluctuation in the operating period as sensed by the first and second operating period sensing portions, so that the peg trays 12 on the first transporting device Tl do not apply a pressing force to the peg trays 12 on the second transporting device T2. Concretely, the two solenoid valves 32 and 33 are controlled so that the difference tl between the point in time when the air cylinder 21 of the first transporting device Tl starts operating and the point in time when the air cylinder 22 of the second transporting device T2 starts operating and the difference t2 between the point in time when the air cylinder 21 of the first transporting device Tl stops operating and the point in time when the- air cylinder 22 of the second transporting device T2 stops operating both become Tinit or longer. Tinit is the difference between the point in time when the air cylinder 21 starts operating and the point in time when the air cylinder 22 starts operating when the first and second transporting devices Tl and T2 start being driven, that is to say, the initial value of tl.<br>
The control device C controls the two solenoid valves 32 and 33 so that the difference tl between the point in time when the air cylinder 21 starts operating and the point in time when the air cylinder 22 starts operating and the difference t2 between the point in time when the air cylinder 21 stops operating and the point in time when the air cylinder 22 stops operating become the same when the first and second transporting devices Tl and T2 start being driven. The control device C calculates the respective average values of periods Tin and Tout, which are required for the two air cylinders 21 and 22 to move forward a number of times (ten times in this embodiment), and sets the points in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 start each reciprocation for a<br><br>
certain number of times of the following operations on the basis of at least these average values of the periods Tin and Tout.<br>
When the period Tin for the air cylinder 21 of the first transporting device Tl to make each stroke in the forward movement is set for a certain number of times of the following operations, the control device C sets the difference tl between the point in time when the air cylinder 21 starts operating and the point in time when the air cylinder 22 starts operating so that it is the same as the initial value Tinit if the average value of period Tin is greater than the average value of period Tout. The control device C sets the difference tl between the point in time when the air cylinder 21 starts operating and the point in time when the air cylinder 22 starts operating to a value gained by subtracting the period Tin from the sum of the period Tout and the initial value Tinit in the case where the average value of the period Tin is smaller than the average value of the period Tout. As a result, the difference t2 between the point in time when the air cylinder 21 stops operating and the point in time when the air cylinder 22 stops operating becomes the initial value Tinit.<br>
In addition, the control device C moves the transporting rail 15 for the first transporting device Tl by 180 mm or more before the completion of the reciprocating movement of the second transporting device T2 and starts the first transporting device Tl before the transporting rail 15 of the second transporting device T2 moves 130 mm.  180 mm is the space created in the second connection portion 14, where there are no peg trays 12. The control device C is provided with a microcomputer, and a control program for driving and controlling the air cylinders 21 and 22 as described above is stored in the memory thereof.<br><br>
Next, the operation of the apparatus formed as described above is discussed. The fine spinning machine 11 stops as bobbins become full, and when the operation of exchanging bobbins using a publicly known bobbin exchanging apparatus of a type where bobbins are exchanged all at once for all of the spindles (not shown) is completed, the operation of carrying out full bobbins and the operation of carrying in empty bobbins are started.<br>
The two transporting devices Tl and T2 are in such a state as to be placed in their original location when the operation of carrying out full bobbins and the operation of carrying in empty bobbins are started. The piston rod 21a of the air cylinder 21 is in its original position when in a receded state, and the piston rod 22a of the air cylinder 22 is in its original position when in a protruding state. In this state, peg trays 12 are placed on the transporting rails 15 of the two transporting devices Tl and T2, the supporting portions and the base plate 24 of the first connection portion 13 in such a manner that they make contact with each other.  In addition, on the guide path 27 of the second connection portion 14, peg trays 12 are mounted in such a manner as to make contact with each other upstream from a location corresponding to the turntable 31, there is a space for two peg trays 12 in a location corresponding to the turntable 31, and peg trays 12 are mounted in such a manner as to make contact with each other downstream from a location corresponding to the turntable in the direction in which the peg trays 12 move. In addition, the speed controller 37 is adjusted so that the period during which the air cylinder 22 of the second transporcing device T2 on the exit side makes one stroke in the reciprocating movement is 6 seconds, and the period during which the air cylinder 21 of the first transporting device Tl on the entry side makes one stroke in<br><br>
the reciprocating movement is 6.6 seconds.<br>
Starting from this state, the air cylinders 21 and 22 are operated on the basis of an instruction from the control device C, so that first the second transporting device T2 is driven, and then the first transporting device Tl is driven after a certain delay. Then, the transporting rails 15 are moved forward with strokes that are slightly greater than four times the spindle pitch. When the transporting rails 15 moves forward, peg trays 12 are moved by a distance corresponding to the distance in which the transporting rails 15 moves forward due to the function of the engagement protrusions 15a, which are provided in such a manner as to protrude from the upper surface of the transporting rails 15. As the transporting rails 15 of the second transporting device T2 moves forward, a space where four peg trays 12 can be placed is created in the inlet portion T2a of the second transporting device T2. Then, four peg trays 12 are pushed into the first connection portion 13 as the transporting rails 15 of the first transporting device Tl moves forward, so that the four peg trays 12 mounted on the second end of the first connection portion 13 are fed into the above described space in sequence.<br>
In addition, as the transporting rails 15 of the second transporting device T2 move forward, the four peg trays 12 mounted on the outlet portion T2b of the second transporting device T2 are fed out to the second connection portion 14. Then, peg trays 12 placed upstream from the turntable 31 of the guide path 27 move over the length of four peg trays 12, and when peg trays 12 move onto the turntable 31, they are moved directly by the turntable 31. Accordingly, at the point in time when the movement (forward movement) of the two transporting rails 15 in the direction in which peg trays 12 are fed is completed, there is a space where four peg trays<br><br>
12 can be placed in a location facing the turntable 31.<br>
At the point in time when the forward movement of the transporting rails 15 is completed, the engagement protrusions 17a of the positioning member 17 enter the engaging recesses 12a of the peg trays 12 and become of such a state that there is a gap between the engagement recesses 12a and the engagement protrusions 17a. When the transporting rails 15 move backward, engagement protrusions 17a that enter the engagement recesses 12a engage with the engagement recesses 12a, so that the peg trays 12 are prevented from receding, and accordingly, the respective peg trays 12 in portions corresponding to the spindle column are placed in predetermined locations where bobbins are exchanged, which correspond to the spindles 18. When the transporting rails 15 move backward, the engagement protrusions 15a push up the peg trays 12 which are in such a state that movement is restricted due to the function of the engagement protrusions 17a so as to pass beneath these.  In addition, when the transporting rails 15 of the second transporting device T2 move backward, such force as to push the peg trays toward the first connection portion 13 is applied to the peg trays 12 supported by the supporting portion via the engagement protrusions 15a. However, the peg trays 12 are in such a state as to make contact with the peg trays 12 within the first connection portion 13, and therefore, movement thereof is prevented, and the peg trays 12 are held in the support portion.<br>
When peg trays 12 that are fed into the second connection portion 14 from the second transporting device T2 pass through a location corresponding no the full bobbin removing portion, the full bobbin or empty bobbin mounted on the peg 12b is removed from the peg 12b and falls down on the belt conveyor 30 so as to be discharged onto the belt<br><br>
conveyor 30. Then, the full bobbin or empty bobbin is carried on the belt conveyor 30 so as to be discharged into a container (not shown).<br>
Peg trays 12 from which a full bobbin or empty bobbin has been removed move to a location corresponding to an empty bobbin supplying portion so that an empty bobbin is mounted on the peg 12b. Then, peg trays 12 on which empty bobbins have been mounted move to a location corresponding to the turntable 31. The peg trays 12 that are of such a state as to be engaged with the turntable 31 are carried directly through the rotation of the turntable 31 so as to move to such a location as to make contact with the peg tray 12 carried before.<br>
Afterwards, sensing signals from the respective sensors Sla, S2a, S1b and S2b are inputted into the control device C in the same manner, so that the receded and protruding state of the two piston rods 21a and 22a is checked and the air cylinders 21 and 22 are operated so that the two air cylinders 21 and 22 move forward and backward along the transporting rails 15, respectively. Accordingly, four peg trays 12 on the transporting rails 15 of the second transporting device T2 are carried out into the second connection portion 14 at a time.  In addition, four peg trays 12 are supplied onto the transporting rails 15 of the first transporting device Tl from the second connection portion 14 at a time, and four peg trays 12 on which a full bobbin or empty bobbin is mounted are carried from the first transporting device Tl to the second transporting device T2 in sequence via the first connection portion 13 at a time. Thus, at the point in time when a predetermined number of peg trays 12 on which an empty bobbin is mounted are placed on the two transporting device Tl and T2, carrying out of full bobbins and carrying in of empty bobbins is completed.<br><br>
Next, the process for setting the difference tl between the point in time when the air cylinder 21 starts operating and the point in time when the air cylinder 22 starts operating in the case where the air cylinders 21 and 22 are operated is described in accordance with the flowchart of Fig. 3.<br>
The control device C starts driving and controlling the air cylinders 21 and 22 in Step S1, and starts feeding peg trays 12. The control device C sets the initial value Tinit of the difference tl to the time required for peg trays 12 to move through a gap portion of the peg trays 12 in the vicinity of the turntable 31 in the second connection portion 14 at the usual speed, for example 0.6 seconds, and sets Tin and Tout to the same time (for example 4 seconds). Next, the control device C outputs an instruction for driving the solenoid valves 32 and 33 under the same conditions as those under which the air cylinders 21 and 22 reciprocate up to ten times in Step S2. In addition, period Tin and period Tout in each stroke from the first to the tenth stroke are calculated on the basis of the output signals from the sensors Sla, S1b, S2a and S2b.  In addition, when the ten strokes are com.pleted, the control device C calculates the average value Tin (Nl, NIO) and Tout (Nl, NIO) of the ten times of the period Tin and the period Tout, respectively, and after that, the procedure goes to Step S3, The average values Tin (Nl, NIO) and Tout (Nl, NIO) are average values of the first to tenth values in the case of the first ten strokes, and after that, the average values of the ten following values, that is to say, the eleventh to twentieth values, the twenty-first to thirtieth values ... (10 x n - 9)th to (10 x n)th values (n is a natural number).<br>
The control device C determines whether the average<br><br>
value Tin (Nl, NIO) of period Tin is equal to the average value Tout (Nl, NIO) of the period Tout or greater in Step S3. In the case where the average value Tin (Nl, NIO) is the average value Tout (Nl, NIO) or greater, the control device C sets the difference tl for the next time onward to the initial value Tinit in Step S4, and after that, the procedure goes to Step S5. In addition, in the case where the average value Tin (Nl, NIO) is less than the average value Tout (Nl, NIO), the control device C sets the difference tl for the next time onward to a value gained by subtracting the period Tin from the sum of the period Tout and the initial value Tinit in Step S6, and after that, the procedure goes to Step S5.<br>
The control device C determines whether the value gained by subtracting the difference tl from the period Tout in Step S5 is greater than the value gained by multiplying the period Tin by 180/300, that is to say, whether the air cylinder 21 of the first transporting device Tl moves by 180 mm or more before feeding of the air cylinder 22 of the second transporting device T2 is completed. Thus, in the case where the determination is affirmative in Step S5, the procedure of the control device C goes to Step S7.  In the case where the determination is negative in Step S5, the control device C sets the difference tl to the difference between the period Tout and the value gained by multiplying the period Tin by 180/300 in Step S8, and after that, the procedure goes to Step S7. Here, 180/300 is a value gained by dividing the space (180 mm) where there are no peg trays 12 in the turning portion of the second connection portion 14 by the stroke (300 ram) of the air cylinders 21 and 22.<br>
The control device C determines in Step S7 whether the difference tl is greater than the value gained by multiplying the period Tout by 180/300, that is to say, whether the air<br><br>
cylinder 21 of the first transporting device Tl starts up before the air cylinder 22 of the second transporting device T2 moves by 180 mm. Thus, in the case where the determination is affirmative in Step S7, the procedure of the control device C goes to Step SB.    In the case where the determination is negative in Step S7, the control device C sets the difference tl to the value gained by multiplying the period Tout by 180/300 in Step SIO, and after that, the procedure goes to Step S9.<br>
The control device C determines whether the difference tl and the difference t2 are zero or greater in Step S9, and in the case where the difference tl and the difference t2 are zero or greater, the procedure goes to Step Sll.  In the case where the difference tl and the difference t2 is lower than        zero, the procedure goes to Step S12. The control device C displays that there is an error in Step S12, and after that, the procedure goes to Step Sll. To display that there is an error is, for example, to turn on a warning lamp (not shown), or display an error message in a display portion {not shown). Here, when an error message is displayed, it doesn't necessarily mean that the operation of the first and second transporting devices Tl and T2 are immediately being hindered, and therefore, the operation of the two transporting devices Tl and T2 continues.<br>
The control device C determines whether a predetermined number of peg trays 12 have been carried, that is to say, whether the number of reciprocations of the two air cylinders 21 and 22 has reached a predetermined number, in Step Sll. Thus, in the case where the number of reciprocations of the two air cylinders 21 and 22 has not reached the predetermined number, the control device C completes the operation of carrying peg trays 12. In the case where the number has not reached the predetermined number, the procedure of the<br><br>
control device C returns to Step S2.<br>
As a result of the above described control, an instruction signal is outputted to the solenoid valves 32 and 33, so that the first to tenth operations of the air cylinders 21 and 22 allow the period Tin and the period Tout to be the same and the difference tl to be the initial value Tinit (0.6 seconds),   as shown in Fig. 4A. Thus, an instruction signal is outputted to the solenoid valves 32 and 33 while the difference tl remains the initial value Tinit, as shown in Fig. 4B for each set of operations, from the (10 X n - 9)th to the (10 x n)th, which are the eleventh onward, in the case where the average value Tin (Nl, NIO) of the ten preceding operations is the average value Tout (Nl, NIO) or greater. The average value Tin (Nl, NIO) is the average value Tout (Nl, NIC) or greater, and as a result, the difference t2 becomes greater than difference tl = initial value Tinit. In addition, in the case where the average value Tin (Nl, NIO) of the ten preceding operations is less than the average value Tout (Nl, NIC), an instruction signal is outputted to the solenoid valves 32 and 33, as shown in Fig. 4C, so that the difference tl becomes a value gained by subtracting the average value Tin (Nl, NIO) from the sum of the average value Tout (Nl, NIO) and the initial value Tinit, that is to say, the difference t2 becomes the initial value Tinit. As a result, in the case where bobbins that have become full are carried out and empty bobbins are carried in, the bobbins can be carried without any hindrance, for example without the peg trays 12 on the first transporting device Tl side pressing the peg trays 12 on the second transporting device T2 side through the first connection portion 13, even when the load on the exit side and the enrry side changes.<br>
The speed controller 37 is adjusted when the fine spinning machine 11 stops operating.<br><br>
In this embodiment, the following advantages are gained.<br>
(1)	Individual solenoid valves 32 and 33 are provided<br>
for each air cylinder 21 and 22, and the control device C<br>
carries out such control that the point in time when the air<br>
cylinder 21 starts operating is after the point in time when<br>
the air cylinder 22 starts operating. First and second<br>
operating period sensing portions for sensing the operating<br>
period of the two air cylinders 21 and 22, respectively,<br>
(sensors Sla, S1b, S2a and S2b) are provided. In addition, the control device C corrects the difference between the points in time when the two air cylinders 21 and 22 start operation in accordance with the fluctuation in the operation periods Tin and Tout as sensed-by the two operating period sensing portions, so that the peg trays 12 on the first transporting device Tl do not apply a pressing force no the peg trays 12 on the second transporting device T2. Accordingly, in the case where full bobbins are carried out and empty bobbins are carried in using the peg trays 12 carried through the reciprocating movement of the transporting rails 15, bobbins can be carried without hindrance even when the load on the exit side and the entry side changes.<br>
(2)	The control device C controls the two solenoid<br>
valves 32 and 33 so that the difference tl between the points<br>
in time when the two air cylinders 21 and 22 start operating<br>
and the difference t2 between the points in time when the two<br>
air cylinders stop operating become the same when the bobbin<br>
carrying apparatus starts being driven. After that, the<br>
average value of the period required for the forward movement<br>
of the two air cylinders 21 and 22 is calculated on the basis<br>
of the periods Tin and Tout required for the air cylinders 21,<br>
22 to move forward a number of times (ten times in this<br><br>
embodiment) . On the basis of the calculated value, the point in time when the operation for reciprocating the air cylinder 21 is started in a certain number of times of the following operations is set. Accordingly, control becomes easy in comparison with the case where the conditions for operating the two air cylinders 21 and 22 are changed every time.  In addition, appropriate conditions are gained even when the state of operation of the two air cylinders 21 and 22 is different each time.<br>
(3)	The control device C compares the average value of the period Tin required for the forward movement of the air cylinder 21 for multiple times and the average value of the period Tout required for the forward movement of the air cylinder 22, and sets—the difference tl between the points in time when the operation of the two air cylinders 21 and 22 is started. When the spinning machine is in a usual state of operation, the period for the forward movement of the air cylinder 21 is shorter than the period for the forward movement of the air cylinder 22. In the case of special conditions of operation, for example spinning is carried out only with the spindles on one side in order to reduce the amount of production, however, the period for the forward movement of the air cylinder 21 is sometimes longer than the period for the forward movement of the air cylinder 22.  In this embodiment, such cases can also be dealt with.<br>
(4)	One stroke of the transporting rails 15 for intermittently moving peg trays 12 by a predetermined pitch is set to a value which is slightly greater than four times the spindle pitch, so that peg trays 12 are moved by a distance four times greater than the spindle pitch. Accordingly, the number of operations of the air cylinders 21 and 22 for the reciprocating movement of the transporting rails 15 becomes 1/4 of that of the apparatus for moving peg<br><br>
trays 12 by the spindle pitch before the completion of carrying out of full bobbins and carrying in of empty bobbins, and thus, the time for carrying each peg tray 12 is greatly reduced.<br>
(5)	The turntable 31 is provided in the middle of the guide path 27 of the second connection portion 14, and accordingly, a space for approximately two or more peg trays 12 (180 mm) is intentionally created in the middle of the guide path 27 when the turntable 31 rotates. Accordingly, four peg trays 12 on the transporting rails 15 are smoothly fed into the second connection portion 14 when the transporting rails 15 of the second transporting device T2 move forward.<br>
(6)	The control device C determines that cases are normal in which the air cylinder 21 moves over the above described space of 180 mm or greater before the feeding of the air cylinder 22 is completed, and the air cylinder 21 is started before the air cylinder 22 moves 180 mm, and displays that there is an error in other cases. Accordingly, it becomes possible for the operator to find an error display, so that the abnormal state can be repaired at an early stage.<br>
Next, a second embodiment is described in reference to Fig. 5. The second embodiment is different from the first embodiment in the process for setting the difference tl between the points in time when the air cylinder 21 and 22 start operating in the case where the control device C operates the air cylinders 21 and 22, and the configuration of other parts is the same as in the first embodiment. Therefore, the same reference numerals are attached to components which are the same, and detailed description thereof is not repeated.<br><br>
The control device C control the two solenoid valves 32 and 33 so that the difference tl.between the point in time when the air cylinder 21 starts operating and the point in time when the air cylinder 22 starts operating and the difference t2 between the point in time when the air cylinder 21 stops operating and the point in time when the air cylinder 22 stops operating become the same when the first and second transporting devices Tl and T2 start being driven. The control device C calculates the average value of the periods Tin and Tout required for the forward movement of the two air cylinders 21 and 22 on the basis of the periods Tin and Tout required for multiple times of the forward movements of the respective air cylinders 21 and 22 (ten times in this embodiment). In addition, the control device C also calculates the average value tl (Nl, NIO) of a number of differences tl between the point in time when the air cylinder 21 starts operating and the point in time when the air cylinder 22 starts operating, and the average value t2 (Nl, NIO) of the difference t2 between the point in time when the air cylinder 21 stops operating and the point in time when the air cylinder 22 stops operating. Thus, the difference tl is set so as to be a simple average of the average value tl (Nl, NIO) and the average value t2 (Nl, NIO) in each time when the time for the forward movement of the air cylinder 21 a certain number of times in the following operations is set.<br>
As shown in the flowchart of Fig. 5, the control device C starts driving and controlling the air cylinders 21 and 22 of the first and second transporting devices Tl and T2 in Step S21, and starts feeding peg trays 12. The control device C sets the initial value Tinir of the difference tl to, for example, 0,6 seconds, and sets Tin and Tout to the same period (for example 4 seconds) . Next, the control device C outputs a driving instruction to the solenoid valves 32 and<br><br>
33 under the same conditions for the reciprocating movement of the air cylinders 21 and 22 up to ten times in Step S22. In addition, the period Tin, the period Tout, the difference tl and the difference t2 in each stroke are calculated on the basis of the output signals from the sensors Sla, S1b, S2a and S2b. Thus, when ten strokes are completed, the average value Tin (Nl, NIO), Tout (Nl, NIO) and the average value tl (Nl, NIO) of the difference tl between the points in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 start operating, and the average value t2 (Nl, NIO) of the difference t2 in time when the air cylinders stop operating are calculated from the ten values of the period Tin and the period Tout, and after that, the procedure goes to Step S23.<br>
The control device C sets the difference tl in the following ten operations so that it is a simple average of the average value tl (Nl, NIO) of the difference tl of the preceding ten values and the average value t2 (Nl, NIO) of the difference t2 in Step S23. Next, the control device C determines whether the difference tl is greater than the initial value Tinit, and whether the difference between the period Tout and the difference Tl is greater than the initial value Tinit. Then, in the case where the determination is affirmative in Step S24, the procedure of the control device C goes to Step S25, while in the case where the determination is negative in Step S24, the procedure of the control device C goes to Step S26. The control device C displays that there is an error in Step S26, and after that, the procedure goes to Step S25. To display that there is an error is, for example, to turn on a warning lamp (not shown), or to display an error message in a display portion (not shown).<br>
The control device C determines whether a predetermined number of peg trays 12 have been carried in Step S25, that is to say, whether the number of reciprocating movements of the<br><br>
two air cylinders 21 and 22 has reached a predetermined number.  In the case where the number of reciprocations of the two air cylinders 21 and 22 reaches a predetermined number, the operation of carrying peg trays 12 is completed, while in the case where the number has not reached a predetermined number, the procedure returns to Step S22.<br>
Therefore, in accordance with this embodiment, the following advantages are gained, in addition to the advantages (1), (2), (4)   and (5) in the first embodiment.<br>
(7) The control device C calculates the average value tl (Nl, NIO) of a number of values of the difference between points in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 start operating, and the average value t2 (Nl, NIO), which is the difference in time when the air cylinders stop operating, in addition to the average value of the periods required for the forward movement of the two air cylinders 21 and 22, on the basis of the number of values of the periods Tin and Tout required for the forward movement of the respective air cylinders 21 and 22. In addition, the difference tl between the points in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 start operating is set so as to be a simple average {tl(Nl, NIO) + t2{Nl, NIO)}/2 of the above described average values tl (Nl, NIO) and t2 (Nl, NIC) each time when the operation for reciprocating the air cylinder 21 a certain number of times of the following operations is started. Accordingly, the logic for setting the difference tl becomes simple.<br>
Next, a third embodiment is described in reference to Figs. 6 to 9. The third embodiment is different from the first embodiment in the process for setting the difference tl between the points in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 start operating in the case where the control device C operates the air cylinders 21 and 22, and the configuration<br><br>
of other parts is the same as in the first embodiment, and<br>
therefore, the same reference numerals are attached to components which are the same, and detailed description thereof is not repeated.<br>
Fig. 6 is a time chart showing the relationship between an operation instruction from the control device C and the detection signals from the sensors Sla, S1b, S2a and S2b.<br>
As shown in the time chart of Fig. 6, the control device C outputs an operation instruction so that the point in time when the air cylinder 22 on the exit side starts operating is earlier by ∆tl than the point in time when the air cylinder 21 on the entry side starts operating , and the point in time when the air cylinder 22 on the exit side stops, operating is earlier than the point in time when the air cylinder 22 on the entry side stops operating. This is described in further detail below. An operation instruction is outputted so that the point in time when the feeding operation starts is earlier by Atl on the exit side, and the point in time when the returning operation starts and the point in time when the operation stops become the same on the two sides.  In order to prevent the first connection portion 13 of the gear end GE from becoming clogged with peg trays 12, it is necessary for there to be a difference ∆t2 (&gt; 0) between the points in time when the two air cylinders 21 and 22 stop operating. The time when the feeding instruction is completed in the operation instruction on the exit side is after the point in time when the sensor S2a carries out detection, because the operation of the piston rod 22a in the air cylinder 22 is completed before the point in time when the output of the feeding instruction set after a predetermined period has passed after the point in time when the output is started in advance is completed.<br><br>
The load that acts on the air cylinders 21 and 22 fluctuates as full bobbins are carried out and empty bobbins are carried in. In addition, in most cases, the load on the air cylinder 21 becomes smaller than the load on the air cylinder 22. The control device C controls the points in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 start operating via the solenoid valves 32 and 33, so that the point in time when the air cylinder 22 on the exit side stops operating is earlier than the point in time when the air cylinder 22 on the entry side stops operating, that is to say, the difference ∆t2 becomes positive (&gt; 0),<br>
The speed at which compressed air is supplied is adjusted by the speed controller 37 in the trial operation, where the peg trays 12 are in an empty state, so that the time for the air cylinder 21 on the entry side to make one stroke becomes 6.6 seconds and the time for the air cylinder 22 on the exit side to make one stroke becomes 6 seconds.  In addition, the control device C sets the initial value ∆tl (0) of the difference ∆tl in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 start operating when full bobbins start being carried out and empty bobbins start being carried in to 0.6 seconds, which is the time required for peg trays 12 to move over the space portion (180 mm) for the peg trays 12 in the vicinity of the turntable 31 in the second connection portion 14 at a normal speed.<br>
Thus, the control device C controls the air cylinders 21 and 22 by setting the value ∆tl (Wl, N2) of each difference Atl between the points in time when the two air cylinders 21 and 22 start operating to the initial value ∆tl (0) after the start of carrying out of full bobbins and the start of carrying in of empty bobbins, and before the two air cylinders 21 and 22 reciprocate a certain number of times (ten times in this embodiment). After that, the difference<br><br>
∆t2' between the average value ∆t2 (Nl, N2) of the values of<br>
the difference between the points in time when the air<br>
cylinders 21 and 22 stop operating in ten operations,<br>
starting from that twenty times before to eleven times before,<br>
and the average value ∆t2 (Nl, N2) of the values of the<br>
difference between the points in time when the air cylinders<br>
21 and 22 stop operating in ten operations, starting from<br>
that ten times before to one time before is found for every<br>
ten operations. In addition, the difference ∆tl (Nl, N2) is<br>
set on the basis of the determination as to whether the<br>
difference ∆t2' is greater than zero. In the case where the<br>
difference ∆tl (Nl, N2) starting from the eleventh operation<br>
to the twentieth operation is set, that is to say, in the<br>
case where the difference Atl (Nl, N2) is set for the<br>
following ten:operations when the tenth operation is        ^    .<br>
completed, there is no data starting from the operation<br>
twenty times before to that eleven times before, and<br>
therefore, ∆tl (Nl, N2) is set as the initial value ∆tl (0)<br>
for the first to twentieth operations, in order to control<br>
the air cylinders 21 and 22.<br>
In the following, a method for setting the difference ∆tl (Nl, N2) between the points in time when the two air cylinders 21 and 22 start operating is described in reference to the flowcharts shown in Figs. 7 and 8.<br>
The control device C starts driving and controlling the air cylinders 21 and 22 in Step S31, and stares feeding peg trays 12, The control device C sets the initial value Atl (0) of the difference ∆tl to, for example, 0.6 seconds, and sets the point in time for output when the feeding instruction on the exit side starts being outputted to a point in time earlier by ∆tl than the point in time when the feeding instruction on the entry side starts being outputted.<br><br>
Next, the control device C outputs a driving instruction to the solenoid valves 32 and 33 under the same conditions as for the reciprocating movement of the air cylinders 21 and 22 up to twenty times in Step S32.  In addition, the period Tout and the difference t2 in each stroke are calculated on the basis of the output signals from the sensors Sla, Sib, S2a and S2b. When the operation of the air cylinders 21 and 22 is completed up to twenty times, the procedure of the control device C goes to Step S33 and the difference ∆t2' between the average value ∆t2 (1, 10) of ten values of the difference between the points in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 stop operating, starting from the operation twenty times before and that eleven times before, and the average value ∆t2 (11, 20) of ten values of the difference between the points in time;When the air cylinders 21 and 22 stop operating, starting from the operation ten times before and that one time before is found.<br>
Next, the control device C determines whether the difference ∆t2' is greater than zero in Step S34. In the case where the difference ∆t2' is greater than zero, the control device C sets the difference ∆tl (21, 30) of points in time when the following ten operations start to the sum of the initial value ∆tl (0) and the difference ∆t2', and after that, the procedure goes to Step S35. In the case where the difference ∆t2' is zero or smaller, the procedure of the control device C goes to Step S37 and the difference ∆tl (21, 30) in time when the following ten operations start is set to the initial value ∆tl (0), and after that, the procedure goes to Step S36.<br>
The control device C determines in Step S36 whether the difference ∆tl (21, 30) is a value gained by multiplying, by the average value Tout (11, 20) of the operation period Tout of the air cylinder 22 on the exit side, the value S/L gained<br><br>
by dividing the space S in the turning portion of the second connection portion 14 (for example 180 mm) by the stroke L of the air cylinders 21 and 22 (for example 300 mm) or smaller. That is to say, it is determined whether the operation of the air cylinder 21 of the first transporting device Tl is started before the air cylinder 22 of the second transporting device T2 moves by a distance corresponding to the space S (180 mm) . In the case where the determination is affirmative in Step S36, the procedure of the control device C goes to Step S38. In the case where the determination is negative in Step S36, the control device C sets the difference ∆tl (21, 30) to a value gained by multiplying S/L by the average value Tout (11, 20) in Step S39, and after that, the procedure goes to Step S38. Then, in Step S38, the control device C sets the difference Atl between the points in time when the air. cylinders 21 and 22 operate for the following ten times, that is to say, from the twenty-first to the thirtieth time, to the sum of the initial value ∆tl (0) that is set in Step S35 and the difference ∆t2' or the value gained by multiplying S/L set in Step S39 by the average value Tout (11, 20) .<br>
When the twenty-first to thirtieth operation of the air cylinders 21 and 22 is completed, the procedure of the control device C goes to Step 540 and the difference ∆t2" between the average value At2 (11, 20) of the values of the difference between the points in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 stop operating ten times, starting from the operation twenty times before to that eleven times before, and the average value ∆t2 (21, 30) of the values of the difference between the points in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 stop operating ten times starting from the operation ten times before to that one time before is obtained.<br>
Next, the control device C determines whether the<br><br>
difference ∆t2" is greater than zero in Step S41.  In the case where the difference ∆t2" is greater than zero, the control device C sets the difference vtl (31, 40) in the starting of the following ten operations to the sum of the difference ∆tl (21, 30) and the difference ∆t2' in Step S42, and after that, the procedure goes to Step S43. In the case where the difference ∆t2" is zero or smaller, the control device C sets the difference ∆tl (31, 40) in the starting of the following ten operations to the difference∆tl (21, 30) in Step S44, and after that, the procedure goes to Step S43.<br>
The control device C determines in Step S43 whether the difference ∆tl (31, 40) is the value gained by multiplying the value S/L gained by dividing the space S in the turning portion of the second connection portion 14 (for example 180 mm) by the stroke L of the air cylinders 21 and 22 (for example 300 mm) by the average value Tout (21, 30) of the period Tout during which the air cylinder 22 on the exit side operates or smaller. In the case where the determination is affirmative in Step S43, the procedure of the control device C goes to Step S45.  In the case where the determination is negative in Step S43, the control device C sets the difference ∆tl (31, 40) to the value gained by multiplying S/L by the average value Tout (21, 30) in Step S46, and after that, the procedure goes to Step S45. Then, in Step 45, the control device C sets the difference ∆tl (31, 40) when the following ten operations of the air cylinders 21 and 22 start, that is to say, the thirty-first to fortieth operations, to the sum of the difference ∆tl (21, 30) set in Step S42 and the difference ∆t2' or the value gained by multiplying S/L set in Step S46 by the average value Tout (21, 30).<br>
When the thirty-first to fortieth operations of the air cylinders 21 and 22 are completed, the procedure of the control device C goes to Step 547. Then, operations<br><br>
corresponding to the above described Steps S40 to S45 are carried out, and after that, the procedure goes to Step 54 8. The control device C determines in Step S48 whether a predetermined number of peg trays 12 have been carried, that is to say, whether the number of reciprocations of the two air cylinders 21 and 22 has reached a predetermined number. Thus, in the case where the number of reciprocations of the two air cylinders 21 and 22 reaches a predetermined number, the control device C completes the operation of carrying peg trays 12 in Step S49, and after that, sets the difference ∆tl to the initial value ∆tl   (0) so as to complete the operation. In the case where the number of reciprocations of the two air cylinders 21 and 22 has not reached the predetermined number in Step S48, the procedure of the control device C goes to Step S47 and the difference tl between the points in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 start operating in the following ten operations is set, and after that, the reciprocations of the air cylinders 21 and 22 are controlled.<br>
In addition, the control device C displays a warning that something is wrong with the adjustment of the speed controller 37 in accordance with the flowchart of Fig. 9. The control device C calculates the average value At2 (1, 10) of the difference in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 stop operating in the first to tenth operations of the air cylinders 21 and 22 in Step S61. Next, in Step 562, the control device C determines whether the average value At2 (1, 10) is greater than zero. In the case where the average value ∆t2 (1, 10) is greater than zero, it is determined that everything is normal, and the control device C does not display a warning that something is wrong with the adjustment of the speed controller 37 in Step S63, and the procedure goes to Step S64. In the case where the average value At2 (1, 10) is zero or smaller in Step S62, the control device C displays a warning that something is wrong with the<br><br>
adjustment of the speed controller 37 in Step S64, and after that, the procedure goes to Step 564.<br>
The control device C calculates the average value At2 (11, 20) of the difference between the points in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 stop operating in the eleventh to twentieth operations of the air cylinders 21 and 22 in Step 564. Next, the control device C determines whether the average value At2 (11, 20) is greater than zero in Step S66. In the case where the average value At2 (11, 20) is greater than zero, it is determined that everything is normal, and the control device C does not display a warning that something is wrong with the adjustment of the speed controller 37 in Step S67, and the procedure goes to Step S68, In the case where the average value ∆t2 (11, 20) is zero or smaller in Step S66, the procedure of the control device C goes to Step S69, where a warning that something is wrong with the adjustment of the speed controller 37 is displayed, and after that, the procedure goes to Step S68. In Step S68, the control device C repeats operations corresponding to Steps 364, S66, S67 and S69 until the completion of carrying. To display a warning that something is wrong with the adjustment is, for example, to display that the speed controller 37 should be adjusted so that the speed of operation of the air cylinder 21 on the entry side is lowered in a display portion (not shown). The operator adjusts the speed controller 37 when the fine spinning machine 11 stops operating when they see that a warning that something is wrong with the adjustment is displayed.<br>
In this embodiment, the following advantages are gained in addition to The advantages (1), (4).and (5) in the first embodiment.<br>
(8) The control device C sets the difference ∆tl<br><br>
between the points in time when the two air cylinders 21 and 22 start operating so that the point in time when the air cylinder 22 on the exit side stops operating is earlier than the point in time when the air cylinder 22 on the entry side stops operating, that is to say, so that the difference At2 becomes positive (&gt; 0). Accordingly, setting of the difference ∆tl becomes easy.<br>
(9) The control device C controls the air cylinders 21 and 22 by setting the value ∆tl (Nl, N2) of the difference ∆tl each time when the two air cylinders 21 and 22 start operating to the initial value ∆tl (0) until the two air cylinders 21 and 22 reciprocate twenty times. After that, the difference ∆t2' between the average value of the difference between the points in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 stop operating of ten times starting from the operation twenty times before to that eleven times before and the average value of the difference between the points in time when the air cylinders 21 and 22 stop operating of ten times starting from the operation ten times before to that one time before is obtained, and the difference Atl (Nl, N2) is set on the basis of the determination as to whether the difference ∆t2' is greater than zero. In addition, the upper limit value for the difference ∆tl (Nl, N2) is the value gained by multiplying, by the average value Tout (21, 30) of the period Tout during which the air cylinder 22 on the exit side operates, the value S/L gained by dividing the space S (180 mm) by the stroke L of the air cylinders 21 and 22 (for example 300 mm). Accordingly, setting of the difference Atl becomes easy.<br>
The embodiments are not limited to the above, but may be modified as follows.<br>
Although the control device C calculates the average<br><br>
value of the periods Tin and Tout of multiple operations, and the average value of the difference tl and the difference t2 on the basis of ten operations of the two air cylinders 21 and 22 at the time when the two cylinders 21 and 22 start operating is set, the number of operations based on which the calculation is performed may be a number other than 10, for example, 9 or less and 11 or more.<br>
Although the speed controller 37 is adjusted so What the period for the air cylinder 22 of the second transporting device T2 on the exit side to make one stroke is 6 seconds, and the period for the air cylinder 21 of the first transporting device Tl on the entry side to make one stroke is 6.6 seconds, the invention is not limited to this. These periods may be changed. Appropriate values for the periods are found through testing, because the appropriate values differ depending on the number of pegs trays 12 moved by the air cylinders 21 and 22.<br>
The value compared with the value gained by subtracting the difference tl from the period Tout in Step S5 in the first embodiment is not limited to a value gained by multiplying the period Tin by 180/300. For example, a value gained by multiplying the period Tin by 120/300 or a value gained by multiplying the period Tin by 150/300 may be used, so that the operation can be carried out under safer conditions (conditions under which it is difficult for the connection portions to become clogged with peg trays 12).<br>
The value compared with the difference tl in Step S7 in the first embodiment is not limited to a value gained by multiplying the period Tout by 180/300. For example, a value gained by multiplying the period Tout by 120/300 or a value gained by multiplying the period Tout by 150/300 may be used.<br><br>
An error message or a warning that something is wrong with the speed controller need not be displayed in each embodiment.<br>
The stroke of the air cylinders 21 and 22 may have a value slightly greater than several times the spindle pitch, and is not limited to a value slightly greater than four times the spindle pitch. For example, a value which is slightly greater than two times or three times the spindle pitch may be set, or a value which is slightly greater than five or more integer times the spindle pitch may be set. In the case where the value is greater than four times the spindle pitch, the space for securing the stroke of the transporting rails 15 becomes great, which is not preferable.<br>
The engagement protrusions 15a are not necessary provided for every peg tray 12, and one engagement protrusion may be provided for a number of peg trays 12.<br>
According to the present invention, apparatuses where transporting rails 15 on which peg trays 12 are mounted in one column and which reciprocate are used as the transporting devices Tl and T2. In place of these apparatuses, the apparatuses disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 57-161133 may be used. The publication discloses apparatuses having a configuration where peg trays 12 are mounted on guide rails and a rod with an engagement claw is reciprocated by an air cylinder.  In these apparatuses, the guide rails form a peg tray path and the rod with an engagement claw and the air cylinder form a transporting member.<br>
The transporting rails 15 may be supported via ball bearings in the configuration, as in the apparatus disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 6-184839,<br><br>
instead of the configuration where the transporting rails 15 are supported by brackets 2 0 having a guide groove 2 0a.<br>
The empty bobbin supplying portion may be provided along a line extending from the first transporting device Tl.<br>
The first connection portion 13 may be provided on the out end OE, and the second connection portion 14 may be provided on the gear end GE.<br>
