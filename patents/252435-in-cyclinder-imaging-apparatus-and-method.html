IN-CYLINDER IMAGING APPARATUS AND METHOD<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent<br>
Application No. 60/864,016, filed November 2, 2006, and which is hereby incorporated<br>
by reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for imaging a<br>
combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine during engine operation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Engineers typically rely on combustion analysis when developing combustion<br>
chambers to increase the operating efficiency and performance of an internal combustion<br>
engine. Typically engineers have limited information about the combustion occurring<br>
within the combustion chamber of an operating or firing engine. This information may<br>
include items such as in-cylinder pressure indexed to engine rotation, thermal mapping,<br>
etc. However, because of the harsh environment (high pressure, high temperature, etc.)<br>
present within the combustion chamber while the engine is operating, it is difficult to<br>
obtain a visual image of the combustion process occurring within the combustion<br>
chamber.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION '<br>
[0004] An in-cylinder imaging apparatus is provided for an internal combustion<br>
engine defining a combustion chamber. The in-cylinder imaging apparatus includes a<br>
high-speed imaging device, such as a high-speed digital camera. A borescope is provided<br>
in communication with the combustion chamber and is operable to communicate images<br>
of the combustion chamber to the high-speed imaging device. A high intensity light<br>
source, such as a xenon light source, is operable to substantially illuminate the<br><br>
P000115-PTE-KFB<br>
2<br>
combustion chamber. The high-speed imaging device and borescope are mounted with<br>
respect to the internal combustion engine.<br>
[0005] In a preferred embodiment, the high-speed imaging device is generally axially<br>
aligned with the borescope. Additionally, the high-speed imaging device is preferably<br>
mounted with respect to the internal combustion engine with a bracket having natural<br>
frequency modes greater than the inducing function of the internal combustion engine. A<br>
window formed, for example, from quartz may be disposed between the borescope and<br>
the combustion chamber to protect the borescope from the high pressures and<br>
temperatures present within the combustion chamber during operation of the internal<br>
combustion engine.<br>
[0006] A prism formed, for example, from sapphire, may be disposed between the<br>
high intensity light source and the combustion chamber. The prism is preferably operable<br>
to disperse light from the high intensity light source into the combustion chamber. A<br>
fiber optic bundle may be provided to communicate light from the high intensity light<br>
source to the prism.<br>
[0007] A method of imaging a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine<br>
during engine operation is also provided. The method includes the steps of: A) mounting<br>
a borescope with respect to the internal combustion engine and in optical communication<br>
with the combustion chamber; B) mounting a high-speed imaging device with respect to<br>
the internal combustion engine and generally in axial alignment with the borescope such<br>
that the borescope is operable to communicate images from within the combustion<br>
chamber to the high-speed imaging device; C) illuminating the combustion chamber with<br>
light from a high intensity light source; and D) capturing the images of the combustion<br>
chamber with the high-speed imaging device while the internal combustion engine is<br>
operating.<br>
[0008] The method may further include cooling the borescope with chilled and/or<br>
compressed gas. The step of illuminating the combustion chamber may include<br>
employing a dispersion prism to disperse the light into the combustion chamber.<br>
Furthermore, the step of mounting the high-speed imaging device with respect to the<br>
internal combustion engine may include the steps of: A) affixing a bracket to the internal<br><br>
P000115-PTE-KFB<br>
3<br>
combustion engine; B) machining the bracket to accept the high-speed imaging device<br>
while affixed to the internal combustion engine to ensure alignment between the high-<br>
speed imaging device and the borescope; and C) mounting the high-speed imaging device<br>
to the bracket. Additionally, the step of mounting the high-speed imaging device with<br>
respect to the internal combustion engine may further include the step of D) tuning the<br>
bracket such that the natural frequency modes of the bracket are greater than the inducing<br>
function of the internal combustion engine.<br>
[0009] The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of the<br>
present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best<br>
modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0010] Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of a portion of an internal combustion<br>
engine having an in-cyUnder imaging apparatus mounted thereto;<br>
[0011] Figure 2 is a cross sectional view illustrating aspects of a borescope of the in-<br>
cylinder imaging apparatus; and<br>
[0012] Figure 3 is a magnified cross sectional view illustrating aspects of a high<br>
intensity light source of the in-cylinder imaging apparatus.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0013] Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to like<br>
or similar components throughout the several figures, there is shown in Figure 1 a cross<br>
sectional view of a portion of an internal combustion engine 10. The internal combustion<br>
engine 10 has an in-cylinder imaging apparatus 12 mounted thereto. The internal<br>
combustion engine 10 includes a cylinder head 14 and a cam cover 16. The cylinder<br>
head 14 partially defines a combustion chamber 18 where a fuel is combusted with air<br>
during operation of the internal combustion engine 10. The cylinder head 14 is<br>
preferably formed from cast metal including, but not limited to,, aluminum, iron, steel,<br>
magnesium, etc. The cylinder head 14 has a deck portion 20 configured to mate to a<br><br>
P000115-PTE-KFB<br>
4<br>
cylinder block, not shown, of the internal combustion engine 10. Additionally, the<br>
cylinder head 14 includes a spring deck portion 22 operable to provide a mounting<br>
surface for components of a valvetrain, not shown. The deck portion 20 and spring deck<br>
portion 22 cooperate to define a cooling jacket 24 through which coolant flows to effect<br>
cooling of the cylinder head 14. The spring deck portion 22 is subject to lubrication oil<br>
splashed from the valvetrain during operation of the internal combustion engine 10. The<br>
cam cover 16 sealingly engages the cylinder head 14 to retain the lubrication oil within<br>
the internal combustion engine 10.<br>
[0014] The in-cylinder imaging apparatus 12 includes a high-speed imaging device<br>
26, borescope 28, and high intensity light source 30. The high-speed imaging device 26<br>
is, for example, a digital camera with the capability of capturing images at a rate of, for<br>
example, up to 160,000 frames per second, in one embodiment, however other camera<br>
speeds may be used. The high-speed imaging device 26 is axially aligned with the<br>
borescope 28. The borescope 28 is in communication with the combustion chamber 18<br>
and is operable to optically communicate images from within the combustion chamber 18<br>
to the high-speed imaging device 26.<br>
[0015] The high-speed imaging device 26 is mounted to the internal combustion<br>
engine 10 by a bracket 32. The bracket 32 also maintains the axial alignment between<br>
the high-speed imaging device 26 and the borescope 28. The bracket 32 is removably<br>
mounted to the cylinder head 14 by fasteners 34. The bracket 32 is formed, for example,<br>
from metal, such as thick gauge steel, having sufficient structural rigidity to effectively<br>
hold the high-speed imaging device 26 in relation to the borescope 28, to effect rigid<br>
motion between the internal combustion engine 10, borescope 28 and high-speed imaging<br>
device 26. In some embodiments, the bracket 32 is analyzed and tuned to ensure that the<br>
natural frequency modes of the bracket 32 are substantially above any modes of<br>
excitation or inducing function, such as the firing order of the internal combustion engine<br>
10, to avoid resonances that may damage components within the borescope 28 and/or<br>
high-speed imaging device 26. An "inducing function" is an excitation pattern or input<br>
relationship which produces a vibration mode, such as the pattern or sequence of firing an<br>
engine. The bracket 32 is machined to accept the high-speed imaging device 26 when<br><br>
P000115-PTE-KFB<br>
5<br>
mounted on the internal combustion engine 10 in order to provide precise axial alignment<br>
with the borescope 28. A source of pressurized and chilled gas 36, such as air, is<br>
provided as a means to cool the borescope 28.<br>
[0016] The high intensity light source 30 is operable to, for example, provide white<br>
light to the combustion chamber 18 to enhance the images provided by the borescope 28<br>
to the high-speed imaging device 26. The high intensity light source 30 is preferably a<br>
xenon light source; however, those skilled in the art of optics and lighting will recognize<br>
other sources of high intensity light may be used while remaining within the scope of that<br>
which is claimed. Light from the high intensity light source 30 is communicated via a<br>
fiber optic bundle 38 to a dispersion prism 40. The dispersion prism 40 is operable to<br>
disperse the light from the high intensity light source 30 into the combustion chamber 18.<br>
The dispersion prism 40 of this embodiment is formed from a crystalline material,<br>
including, but not limited to, sapphire.<br>
[0017] Referring now to Figure 2, there is shown a cross sectional view illustrating<br>
components of the in-cylinder imaging apparatus 12. A generally tubular sleeve 42<br>
extends through a bore 44, defined by the spring deck portion 22 of the cylinder head 14,<br>
and at least partially through a bore 46, defined by the deck portion 20 of the cylinder<br>
head 14. The bores 44 and 46 are formed by machining the cylinder head 14. The sleeve<br>
42 may be fixed in relation to the cylinder head 14 through an interference fit or by an<br>
adhesive sealant, such as epoxy. The sleeve 42 is formed from a material having similar<br>
thermal expansion characteristics as the cylinder head 14 such that as the temperature of<br>
the cylinder head 14 increases, the sleeve 42 will remain fixed with respect to the<br>
cylinder head 14. The sleeve 42 is operable to seal the coolant jacket 24 from the<br>
combustion chamber 18, borescope 28, and spring deck portion 22. Additionally, the<br>
sleeve 42 is operable to prevent the lubricating oil from entering the cooling jacket 24<br>
from the spring deck portion 22 or contacting the borescope 28.<br>
[0018] An outer sleeve 48 extends through the cam cover 16, shown in Figure 1, and<br>
coaxially engages the sleeve 42. An o-ring seal 50 is disposed about the outer periphery<br>
of the sleeve 42 and is operable to sealingly engage the outer sleeve 48. A window 52 is<br>
provided between the borescope 28 and the combustion chamber 18 and operates to<br><br>
P000115-PTE-KFB<br>
6<br>
protect the borescope 28 from the heat and pressure formed within the combustion<br>
chamber 18 during operation of the internal combustion engine 10. The window 52 is<br>
formed from a crystalline material such as quartz; however, those skilled in the art will<br>
recognize other materials that may be used including, but not limited to, sapphire and<br>
spinel, while remaining within the scope of that which is claimed.<br>
[0019] Referring now to Figure 3 there is shown a cross sectional view further<br>
illustrating components of the in-cylinder imaging apparatus 12. A generally tubular<br>
sleeve 54 extends through a bore 56, defined by the spring deck portion 22 of the cylinder<br>
head 14, and at least partially through a bore 58, defined by the deck portion 20 of the<br>
cylinder head 14. The bores 56 and 58 are formed by machining the cylinder head 14.<br>
The sleeve 54 may be fixed in relation to the cylinder head 14 through an interference fit<br>
or by an adhesive sealant, such as epoxy. The sleeve 54 is formed, for example, from a<br>
material having similar thermal expansion characteristics as the cylinder head 14 such<br>
that as the temperature of the cylinder head 14 increases, the sleeve 54 will remain fixed<br>
with respect to the cylinder hea.d 14. The sleeve 54 is operable to seal the coolant jacket<br>
24 from the combustion chamber 18, fiber optic bundle 38, dispersion prism 40, and<br>
spring deck portion 22. Additionally, the sleeve 54 is operable to restrict the movement<br>
of lubricating oil from entering the cooling jacket 24 from the spring deck portion or<br>
contacting the fiber optic bundle 38 and dispersion prism 40. An outer sleeve 60 extends<br>
through the cam cover 16 and coaxially engages the sleeve 54. An o-ring seal 62 is<br>
disposed about the outer periphery of the sleeve 54 and is operable to sealingly engage<br>
the outer sleeve 60.<br>
[0020] A method of imaging the combustion chamber 18 of the internal combustion<br>
engine 10 during engine operation is also provided. The method includes the steps of:<br>
A) mounting the borescope 28 with respect to the internal combustion engine 10 and in<br>
communication with the combustion chamber 18; B) mounting the high-speed imaging<br>
device 26 with respect to the internal combustion engine 10 and generally in axial<br>
alignment with the borescope 28 such that the borescope 28 is operable to communicate<br>
images from within the combustion chamber 18 to the high-speed imaging device 26; C)<br>
illuminating the combustion chamber 18 with light from the high intensity light source<br><br>
P000115-PTE-KFB<br>
7<br>
30; and D) capturing the images of the combustion chamber 18 with the high-speed<br>
imaging device 26 while the internal combustion engine 10 is operating.<br>
[0021] The method further includes cooling the borescope 28 with chilled and<br>
compressed gas from the chilled and compressed gas source 36. The step of illuminating<br>
the combustion chamber 18 includes employing a dispersion prism 40 to disperse the<br>
light into the combustion chamber 18. Furthermore, the step of mounting the high-speed<br>
imaging device 26 with respect to the internal combustion engine 10 preferably include<br>
the steps of: A) affixing the bracket 32 to the internal combustion engine 10; B)<br>
machining the bracket 32 to accept the high-speed imaging device 26 while affixed to the<br>
internal combustion engine 10 to ensure alignment between the high-speed imaging<br>
device 26 and the borescope 28; and C) mounting the high-speed imaging device 26 to<br>
the bracket 32. Additionally, the step of mounting the high-speed imaging device 26 with<br>
respect to the internal combustion engine 10 further includes the step of D) tuning the<br>
bracket 32 such that the natural frequency modes of the bracket 32 are greater than the<br>
inducing function of the internal combustion engine 10.<br>
[0022] By incorporating the high-speed imaging device 26 within the in-cylinder<br>
imaging apparatus 12, the ability to obtain contiguous high-speed images of the<br>
combustion chamber 18 during engine operation will provide engine designers with<br>
additional information necessary to investigate combustion characteristics of the internal<br>
combustion engine 10. These combustion characteristics may include information such<br>
as, cylinder wall wetting by fuel, fuel spray characteristics, soot generation within the<br>
combustion chamber 18, flash boiling, etc. The in-cylinder imaging apparatus 12 may be<br>
used with both spark ignited and compression ignited internal combustion engines and<br>
may be a particularly useful tool in designing spark ignited direct injection and<br>
compression ignited engines, which require careful attention to be paid in the design of<br>
the combustion chamber, piston dome, and fuel spray characteristics and timing.<br>
[0023] While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in<br>
detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
