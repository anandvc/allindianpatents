				<td>Device for Quenching and Tempering Long-length Rolling Stock Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a device for quenching and tempering rolling stock that is of long length, and to do so at high throughput rates. More precisely, the present invention relates to a device for thermally quenching and tempering at least parts of the cross section of profile rolling stock along its longitudinal dimension, using the heat from the rolling mill, said stock being produced in sequence; and in particular for quenching and tempering at least the rail heads, when the length of the rails is greater than 50 m, with subsequent cooling to room temperature, consisting essentially of a roller table, means for aligning the axes of the rolling stock in the axial direction, conveyor means with a support surface for the rolling stock for cross transport of the same, a quenching and tempering device, and a cooling bed.<br>
In order to improve its material properties, rolling stock is subjected to at least one thermal treatment, which is advantageously effected the using the heat from the rolling mill. This quenching and tempering, which essentially increases the physical properties of the stock such as its hardness, resistance to wear, and the like, can be carried out over the whole cross-section or, as is more usually the case with railroad rails, only over part of the cross section. When this is done, the whole length of the rolling stock, which is in the austenitic microstructural state, or part of the cross section of the same, is immersed in a cooling medium, when the conversion of the microstructure is achieved in the desired manner.<br><br>
Related Art<br>
Devices for carrying out quenching and tempering methods of this kind are already known (EP-0441766 B1 )and have proved themselves completely with respect to improving the working properties of railroad rails.<br>
Depending on the end rolling temperature and depending on the specific mass or mass per unit length of the rolling stock, its thermal quenching and tempering requires a corresponding immersion time or hold time in the cooling liquid, so that throughput through the quenching and attempting device is limited. In other words, the maximal possible throughput through an immersion-type quenching and tempering plant with a cooling basin limits the performance of the preceding rolling mill.<br>
In most instances, modern rolling trains for profile stock that are preceded by a heating oven, in particular for the precursor materials for continuous casting, are capable of a potential rolling output that is greater than the throughput that can be achieved by known immersion-type quenching and tempering plants, so that the rolling output of quenched and tempered rails must be lowered for the sequential production of quenched and tempered rails.<br>
In order to avoid this particular economic disadvantage, it has already been proposed to quench and temper rolling stock by running it through a cooling section that is equipped with spraying means. However, such a continuous method requires that the device be extremely long; in most instances, it fails to achieve the rolling stock quality that is desired.<br>
2<br><br>
Thus, it is the objective of the present invention to avoid the shortcomings and, in particular, the economic disadvantages of known heat-treatment devices for rolling stock of the type described in the introduction hereto, and to create a device that ensures the high quality and good serviceability of the rolling stock that is produced, which is capable of good performance, and which makes it possible to process and thermally quench and temper bar stock that is produced in sequence, in particular rails that are more than 50 m long, using high-performance rolling trains and using the heat from the rolling mill.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In a device of this type, this objective has been achieved in that the roller table incorporates a device for positioning the rolling stock that is delivered lying in at least one cross section area in the longitudinal direction, as well as associated aligning means; in that the quenching and tempering device is formed from at least two liquid-cooling devices that are adjacent to each other with their longitudinal direction essentially parallel to the alignment means, and with manipulators for moving the rolling stock; in that the feed area of the cooling bed is adjacent and parallel to the longitudinal dimension of the liquid-cooling devices; and in that the cross transport means are provided with at least two carrier arms that can move simultaneously between the roller-table rollers, each carrier arm having at its end rolling stock support elements whose support surfaces on the carrier arms can be moved and lowered from the aligned position in the area of the roller table into the feed area of the cooling bed, and raised in such a manner that only the supports extend beyond the dclivcn' plane of the roller table or the upper edge of the roller table.<br>
3<br><br>
In particular, the advantages that can be achieved with the present invention are that, by using the device, it is possible to position and axially align rolling stock with a very high degree of accuracy, when by means of the rolling-stock support surfaces of the cross-transport means it is possible to simultaneously bring previously aligned and prepared rolling stock into the delivery areas of the cooling devices, or move it from these into the supporting areas of the cooling bed, or move it from the roller table directly onto the cooling bed, and do so without impairing the set-up or the axial alignment process. At the same time, it is important that only the rolling stock support surfaces of the support arms of the cross-transport means-which can move between the rollers-can be raised beyond the upper level of the rolling train rollers or their plane of delivery. Given this configuration of the device, it is possible to arrange at least two quenching and tempering devices on one side of roller table, so that a cooling bed has to be provided only on one side, which entails economic advantages. Rolling stock that is positioned and aligned axially on the rolling train can be raised from this by means of the support surfaces of the carrier arms and then deposited in the set-down area of a liquid cooling device that is configured as a manipulator. This frees the cross transport means so that they can move more rolling stock, when the manipulator-alone and automatically-can align the rolling stock that has been set down in its cross-section position, move it, at least partially, into the cooling medium, raise it, and prepare it for being moved to the cooling bed.   This separation of cross movement of the rolling stock over cooling devices that are occupied, with ultimate positioning on the cooling bed, and precise immersion of the rolling stock in the cooling medium enhances the precision of manipulation and results in quenched and tempered rolling stock that is of consistently high quality. Most advantageously and in an economical way, the output or throughput of<br>
4<br><br>
the device is approximately doubled by using two quenching and tempering devices that are adjacent to each other.<br>
If the device is used for rolling stock in the form of a running rail or a railroad rail, which lies on the roller table in two cross-section areas, and if the positioning device is configured as electronically controllable means and/or has an alignment guide or a cross stop, the time that the rail stays on the roller table can be reduced in a very favourable way and the output of the plant increased. Furthermore, this position is particularly good for achieving so-called "head down" vertical positioning of the rails by means of the manipulators.<br>
If. as can be stipulated for some configurations of present invention, the liquid cooling devices are configured as dip tanks that have horizontally and vertically oriented stops at the bottom, which are optionally effective to the sides, so as to level and align the rolling stock, it is possible to achieve constant cooling and even hardness distribution over its entire length when a cooling parts of the cross section of a rail; this enhances the quality of the product.<br>
It is advantageous for constant and good working properties if hold-down means for the rolling stock, in particularly for a rail, be provided in the device: the rolling stock/the rails can be held against the levelling stops within the dip tanks during the cooling process by these hold-down means, since the curvature that is caused by the cooling process is effectively prevented and the local cooling of the surface can be kept absolutely even.<br>
5<br><br>
Particular economic advantages are obtained by the quenching and tempering plant when using the above-described device to quench and temper at least the heads of rails that are longer than 50 m, with subsequent cooling to room temperature at a throughput time that exceeds the delivery frequency, since significant increases in output can be achieved for comparatively low plant costs by so doing.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings      <br>
The present invention will be described in greater detail below on the basis of an embodiment shown in the drawing appended hereto. The reference numbers used in these drawings are listed at page 8 of this application.<br>
Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
Figure 1 shows a device according to the present invention, with a quenching and tempering device 3 that consists of two liquid cooling devices 31 and 32 arranged between a roller table 1 and a cooling bed 4. In the exemplary diagrammatic drawing, the head of the rail S is shown immersed in a cooling liquid 315 contained in one of the liquid-cooling devices 31. The rail can be so positioned in a dip tank 312 by means of hold-down means 314 and levelling slops 313 that forced cooling of only the head of the rail is effected. It is, however, also possible to force cool the total cross-section of the rail by stops 313 that the located deeper beneath the surface of the cooling liquid 315. A second liquid-cooling device 32 is ready for use.<br>
6<br><br>
As is also shown in Figure 1, a rail S arriving from a rolling-mill train (not shown herein) is positioned on the roller table 1 and can be aligned axial ly by alignment means 2 that can, if necessary, include an alignment fence 21. Cross transport means 5 with support arms 51 and the rolling stock support surface 52 are arranged in the area of the rolling table 1 so as to be retractable. It is, however, also possible to install cross transport means of this kind in the area of the cooling bed.<br>
For cross transport, there is a simultaneous displacement of the support arms 51 in such a way that the rolling stock support surfaces 52 that are arranged on them can lift the aligned rail S from the rolling train 1 when they are raised, carry it. and move it transversely in the direction of the cooling bed 4. It is important for the present invention that during cross transport, it is only the rolling stock support surfaces 52 of the cross transport means 5 that can extend vertically beyond a delivery plane 11 of the rolling train if the support surfaces 52 are moved into the outermost, opposite area, for example when depositing a rail S on a set-down area 41 of the cooling bed 4.<br>
A rail S that is positioned and axially aligned, and which is lying in two cross section areas on the delivery plane 11 of the roller table 1 can now be raised vertically in this position by means of the rolling stock support surface 52, and then moved essentially horizontally or transversely to a liquid-cooling device that is ready for use, as shown in Figure 1, Position 32. A cross section position of the rail S of this kind on the rolling stock support surfaces 52 is favourable for it to be received and for "head down" vertical positioning by a manipulator 321, by means of which the rail head can be lowered or introduced into a cooling liquid 325. During the time the rail remains in the cooling liquid 325 it can be held in<br>
7<br><br>
position by hold-down means 325 and levelling stops 323, in order to stabilize it.<br>
Because of the fact that, according to the present invention, and as previously discussed, only the rolling stock support surfaces 52 can be moved onto a level that is above the delivery plane 11 of the rolling train, despite cross-transport activities the next rail can be moved from the rolling-mill train onto the roller table 1 an then aligned on this. A rail S can be removed from the liquid-cooling devices 31, 32 by the manipulators 311,321 and set down by the rolling stock support surfaces 52 in essentially the same manner, after which it can be moved and laid on the set-down area 41 of the cooling bed 4.<br>
In the case of greater rolling-mill output, the quenching and tempering device 3 can be made with more than two liquid cooling devices, and a programmable control unit can be used to advantage for a production process.<br>
