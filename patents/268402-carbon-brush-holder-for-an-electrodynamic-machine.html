Carbon brush holder for an electrodynamic machine<br>
The invention relates to a carbon brush holder for an electrodynamic machine, in particular<br>
an electric motor, having a cartridge-type carbon brush guide which is arranged in a housing<br>
for the purpose of mounting a carbon brush which can be displaced in a guide direction, the<br>
carbon brush guide having separate guide elements in the form of a first shell section and a<br>
second shell section, each of which extends along the guide direction.<br>
A carbon brush holder of this kind is known already from EP 1 117 160 B1, which discloses a<br>
carbon brush guide consisting of metal and being composed of two identical half-shells which<br>
extend along the wider surfaces of the carbon brush symmetrically relative to the symmetry<br>
plane of the carbon brush. However, a carbon brush holder of this type has the disadvantage<br>
that when multilayer carbon brushes are used precautions must be, taken in order to avoid<br>
crossover currents flowing across the metallic carbon brush guide between the carbon rods<br>
of the multilayer carbon brush which are separated by means of an insulating layer. This is<br>
achieved according to EP 1 117 160 B1 in that the metallic half-shells do not completely<br>
enclose the multilayer carbon brush and do not extend along those sidewalls of the multilayer<br>
carbon brush in which the carbon bars come into contact with one another with the<br>
intermediate insulating layer.<br>
The object underlying the present invention is to provide an improved, inexpensive carbon<br>
brush holder for an electrodynamic machine.<br>
The aforementioned object is achieved by means of a carbon brush holder having the<br>
features of claim 1. Advantageous and preferred embodiments of the invention are the<br>
subject matter of the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, in a carbon brush holder of the type cited in the introduction the<br>
first shell section is embodied from electrically insulating material and the second shell<br>
section is embodied from metal. This is based on the inventive knowledge that it is ensured<br>
already by means of the one metallic second shell section that the carbon brush is guided<br>
precisely, such that a continuous areal contact of the carbon brush on a commutator or a<br>
collector ring of an electrodynamic machine is ensured. Furthermore the metallic second<br>
shell section has the advantage that heat is dissipated by it and consequently an overheating<br>
of the carbon brush is avoided. In the case of a multilayer carbon brush the electrically<br>
insulating material of the first shell section prevents leakage currents from flowing by way of<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/067031 / 2005P01959WOCN<br>
2/9<br>
the carbon brush guide between the carbon bars that are separated by means of an<br>
insulating layer. A further advantage consists in the fact that if a spring element which acts<br>
on the carbon brush and presses the carbon brush onto the commutator or the collector ring<br>
is provided, an electrical insulation can be dispensed with, and if a plug-in connector part for<br>
electrical contacting of the carbon brush is provided, an electrical insulation can be<br>
dispensed with also in the case of multilayer carbon brushes. All in all, the commutation is<br>
improved compared with prior art carbon brush holders, as a result of which the service life of<br>
the carbon is extended. This means that the length of carbon can be reduced while<br>
maintaining the same longevity of the carbon brush.<br>
Preferably the first shell section is embodied in particular from heavy-duty plastic such as<br>
Duroplast, for example. Particularly preferred is a plastic with a low coefficient of thermal<br>
expansion, for this enables the first shell section to be manufactured with a high degree of<br>
dimensional stability. Duroplast retains its strength and shape even at high temperatures,<br>
with the result that the carbon brush is also guided precisely by the first shell section even at<br>
high temperatures.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment the first shell section is integrally molded onto the<br>
housing of the carbon brush holder as a single piece. This reduces the number of component<br>
parts and in addition there is no need to adjust the first shell section, as a result of which the<br>
carbon brush holder can be manufactured economically. The first shell section can be<br>
manufactured together with the housing particularly easily by means of an injection molding<br>
method.<br>
The second shell section is preferably shaped from a sheet metal, which means that it can<br>
be produced particularly easily, by stamping and bending for example. In particular the<br>
second shell section has at least one latching element by means of which it can be fixed in<br>
the housing. In particular a receptacle for retaining the second shell section is embodied in<br>
the housing, such that the position of the second shell section in the housing is predefined. In<br>
this way inaccuracies in the positioning of the second shell section in the housing of the<br>
carbon brush holder are avoided, thereby enabling a precise guiding of the carbon brush to<br>
be ensured.<br>
In a development of the invention it is provided that the housing has at least one opening<br>
which extends in the guide direction and which can be closed by means of a cover plate. The<br>
interior of the housing can be accessed particularly easily through the opening, which<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/067031 / 2005P01959WOCN<br>
3/9<br>
preferably extends over the entire length of the housing, thereby considerably simplifying the<br>
assembly of the different component parts of the carbon brush holder including the carbon<br>
brush. In particular the cover plate has at least one latching element by means of which the<br>
cover plate can be snapped into place with the housing, with the result that a time-consuming<br>
and expensive screwed connection can be dispensed with.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment a receptacle for retaining the second shell section is<br>
embodied on the cover plate, such that the second shell section can be fixed in the housing<br>
by means of the cover plate. In this way the position of the second shell section in relation to<br>
the housing and in relation to the cover plate can be precisely predefined, thus removing the<br>
need for further calibration.<br>
Preferably, positioning elements are integrally molded on the cover plate and/or fixing<br>
elements integrally molded on the housing for the purpose of, respectively, positioning and<br>
mounting the carbon brush holder on the electrodynamic machine. This makes a precise<br>
installation on the electrodynamic machine particularly easy and possible with as few<br>
additional component parts as possible.<br>
In a development of the invention it is provided that the second shell section is arranged in<br>
the housing opposite the first shell section, with in particular the first shell section and the<br>
second shell section being embodied for guiding opposite side surfaces of the carbon brush.<br>
Preferably the first shell section and/or the second shell section in each case grip around at<br>
least one of the edges of the carbon brush that extend in the guide direction. As a result<br>
thereof the carbon brush can be guided in the carbon brush guide with an exceptionally small<br>
amount of play. The reduces the rate of wear of the carbon brush, and noise generation<br>
during operation of the electrodynamic machine can also be minimized.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, in the case of a multilayer carbon brush the second<br>
shell section extends along a surface of the multilayer carbon brush that is embodied as a<br>
single layer. By this means a short-circuiting of different carbon bars of the multilayer carbon<br>
brush due to the metallic second shell section is avoided.<br>
Preferably the first shell section and the second shell section are formed with identical<br>
shapes. In this way the carbon brush can be guided uniformly in both shell sections, as a<br>
result of which even wearing of the carbon brush can be ensured.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/067031 / 2005P01959WOCN<br>
4/9<br>
The carbon brush holder according to the invention is used in particular in electric motors for<br>
domestic appliances, such as, for example, in drive motors for washing machines or tumble<br>
dryers or in blower motors for vacuum cleaners.<br>
It is pointed out that the features of the dependent claims can be combined with one another<br>
in any way without departing from the inventive concept.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are explained in more detail below with reference to<br>
the drawing, in which:<br>
Fig. 1	shows a cross-section through a carbon brush holder transversely to the guide<br>
direction,<br>
Fig. 2a-2d show individual component parts of the carbon brush holder according to<br>
Figure 1,<br>
Fig. 3	shows a side view of the carbon brush holder according to Figure 1,<br>
Fig. 4a, 4b show a plan view onto the carbon brush holder according to Figure 1 from<br>
obliquely above and obliquely below, respectively.<br>
Before dealing with the drawings in greater depth let it be noted that corresponding or<br>
identical elements or individual parts of the carbon brush holder are designated by the same<br>
reference signs in all figures of the drawing.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a cross-section through a carbon brush holder 1 transversely to the guide<br>
direction F (see arrow in Figure 3). Individual component parts of the carbon brush holder 1<br>
according to Figure 1 are shown in Figures 2a to 2d. The carbon brush holder 1 has a<br>
housing 2 (see also Figure 2a) which is embodied from plastic. Arranged in the housing 2 is<br>
a cartridge-type carbon brush guide 3 in which a carbon brush 4 is guided. The carbon brush<br>
4 shown is a multilayer carbon brush which consists of a first carbon bar 5 and a second<br>
carbon bar 6 with an intermediate insulating layer 7 arranged therebetween. The carbon<br>
brush guide 3 is formed by means of a first shell section 8 and a second shell section 9. The<br>
first shell section 8 is integrally molded on the housing 2 and consists of electrically insulating<br>
plastic. The second shell section 9 (see also Figure 2b) is shaped from a sheet metal and is<br>
inserted into the housing 2.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/067031 / 2005P01959WOCN<br>
5/9<br>
The first shell section 8 and the second shell section 9 are formed identically in a U shape,<br>
each having two arms 10, 11 and 12, 13 and a base 14 and 15 connecting the arms 10 and<br>
11 and 12 and 13, respectively. A spring belly 16 or 17 for receiving a helical spring 18 is<br>
embodied in the first shell section 8 as well as in the second shell section 9 in each case in<br>
the central area of the base 14 and 15 respectively. The helical spring 18 causes the carbon<br>
brush 4 to be pressed in the guide direction F onto a commutator or collector ring of an<br>
electric motor (not shown), with the result that the carbon brush 4 can rest with its end face<br>
19 in continuous areal contact on the commutator or collector ring. A flat guide area 20, 21<br>
and 22, 23 follows in each case between the spring belly 16 and 17 and the associated arms<br>
10, 11 and 12, 13, respectively, on both sides of the respective spring belly 16 and 17. Each<br>
of the flat guide areas 20, 21, 22 or 23 encompasses one of the edges K of the carbon brush<br>
4	extending in the guide direction F in each case with the associated arm 10, 11, 12 or 13<br>
adjoining it. The carbon brush 4 is in contact with the outer surfaces of the first carbon bar 5<br>
at the arms 10, 11 and the flat guide areas 20, 21 of the first shell section 8 and with the<br>
outer surfaces of the second carbon bar 6 at the arms 12, 13 and the flat guide areas 22, 23<br>
of the second shell section 9. In this way the carbon brush 4 is guided with its first carbon bar<br>
5	through the first shell section 8 and with its second carbon bar 6 through the second shell<br>
section 9, thereby preventing leakage currents between the two carbon bars 5, 6 by way of<br>
the metallic second shell section 9. In order to ensure precise positioning of the metallic<br>
second shell section 9 the housing 2 has a receptacle 24 for retaining the second shell<br>
section 9, in particular its arm 12, in a form-fit manner. During assembly the second shell<br>
section 9 is inserted through an opening 25 of the carbon brush holder 1 into the receptacle<br>
24 and snapped into place with the housing 2 by means of a latching element 26 (see Figure<br>
2b). The opening 25 of the housing 2 can be closed by means of a cover plate 27 (see also<br>
Figure 2d). Preferably the cover plate 27 has integrally molded onto it latching elements 28,<br>
29 by means of which the cover plate 27 can be snapped into place with the housing 2. A<br>
receptacle 30 is also embodied on the inside of the cover plate 27 for the purpose of<br>
retaining the second shell section 9, in particular its arm 13, in a form-fit manner, such that<br>
the second shell section 9 can be precisely positioned by closing the opening 25 with the<br>
cover plate 27. Also integrally molded on the cover plate 27 are positioning pins 31, 32 by<br>
means of which the carbon brush holder 1 of the electric motor (not shown) can be precisely<br>
positioned. Lugs 33, 34 are integrally molded on opposite sides of the housing 2 in order to<br>
secure the carbon brush holder 1 to the electric motor, each of said lugs 33, 34 having a<br>
mounting hole 35, 36 for passing through a retaining bolt or retaining pin (not shown).<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/067031 / 2005P01959WOCN<br>
6/9<br>
The housing 2 with the first shell section 8 as well as the cover plate 27 are manufactured<br>
from Duroplast, which is thermally stable up to temperatures of at least 250° C, by means of<br>
an injection molding method. The housing 2 as well as the cover plate 27 have channel-<br>
shaped recesses 37, 38 in the area of the insulating layer 7 in order to ensure that carbon<br>
dust caused by abrasion of the carbon brush 4 cannot accumulate between the carbon bars<br>
5 and 6 and thereby cause leakage currents between the carbon bars 5 and 6. The carbon<br>
brush is electrically contacted by means of a plug-in connector part 39 which rests against<br>
the end of the helical spring 18 opposite the carbon brush 4.<br><br>
