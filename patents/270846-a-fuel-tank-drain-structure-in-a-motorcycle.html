[0001]<br>
[Technical Field to Which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a fuel tank drain structure of a motorcycle. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
As a fuel tank drain structure of a motorcycle, one provided with a drain pipe at a lower part of a fuel tank is<br>
known (e.g., refer to Patent Document 1). [0003]<br>
[Patent Document 1]<br>
Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. Hei 1-30309 (Second Page, Fig. 3) [0004]<br>
Hereinafter, Fig. 3 of Patent Document 1 will be described below with Fig. 8. Note that different reference numerals are used.<br>
Fig. 8 is a sectional view showing a conventional fuel tank drain structure of a motorcycle. Fig. 8 shows that a fueling connector 422 is attached to an upper portion of a tank 421; a drain pipe 425 is extended from a concave portion 423 of the fueling connector 422 to a bottom 424 of the tank 421; a cup-shaped tip portion 427 of a separately provided drain pipe 426 is made to face a lower end of the drain pipe 425; the drain pipe 426 is hung down along an incline 432 of an air cleaner 431; and the drain pipe 426 is attached to the air cleaner 431 by inserting lock protrusions 433, 434 provided midway to the drain pipe 426 into holes 436, 437 opened on the air cleaner 431. Note that reference numeral 438 is a cap which covers the fueling connector 422. [0005] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
Because the foregoing drain pipe 426 is integrally provided with the lock protrusions 433, 434 to be attached to the air cleaner 431, the drain pipe 426 is a custom-made article<br>
and causes an increase in costs. If it is possible to retain the drain pipe 426 by using a peripheral part without changing the drain pipe 426 itself, a commercial item can be utilized as a drain pipe. Thus, an increase in the number of parts can be suppressed, thereby suppressing an increase in costs. [0006]<br>
Meanwhile, because the cup-shaped tip portion 427 of the drain pipe 426 is simply made to face the lower end of the upper drain pipe 425, it is considered that a position of the drain pipe 426 deviates from the drain pipe 425 depending on a positional relationship between the tank 421 and the air cleaner 431. [0007]<br>
Thereupon, an object of the present invention is to suppress the increase in costs and prevent the positional deviation of the drain piping connecting portion by modifying the fuel tank drain structure of the motorcycle. [0008] [Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
In order to solve the aforementioned object, claim 1 is characterized in that in a motorcycle in which a drain pipe is exposed at a lower portion of a bottom plate of a fuel tank, and a drain tube is provided on a body frame side to face a lower end of the drain pipe, electrical equipment is attached to the body frame below the fuel tank, an upper side of the electrical equipment is covered with a cover member, and the drain tube is retained by a guide portion provided on the cover member.<br>
[0009]<br>
It is possible to retain the drain tube as well as to cover the electrical equipment by the cover member and to reduce the number of parts. Moreover, because the drain tube is retained by the guide portion of the cover member, it is unnecessary to change the drain tube, and a commercial item can be utilized as the drain tube. [0010]<br>
Furthermore, if the drain tube is retained by the cover member and the drain  tube is directly connected to  the drain pipe, the drain tube will not deviate from the drain pipe. [0011]<br>
The invention defined in claim 2 is characterized in that the cover member supports a harness coupler.<br>
It is unnecessary to specially provide a support member for the harness coupler and possible to further reduce the number of parts. [0012]<br>
The invention defined in claim 3 is characterized in that the electrical equipment is the ignition coil. By covering the ignition coil with the cover member, it is possible to prevent the ignition coil from being exposed to rain water. [0013] [Preferred Embodiment of the Invention]<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be described below based on the accompanying drawings. Note that the drawings are viewed in the direction of reference numerals.<br>

[0023]<br>
Figs. 7(a) and (b) are operational views showing the operation of the drain tube according to the present invention. Fig. 7 (a) shows a state immediately after the drain tube 56 is<br>
attached to the fuel tank 51. A tip portion 56a of the drain tube 56 is inserted into the tube retaining hole 281 of the cover member 136 from an upper side and passes through the first tube retaining hardware 311, the second tube retaining hardware 312, and the third tube retaining hardware 313 in order. Before the fuel tank 51 is attached to the body frame, a rear end portion 56b of the drain tube 56 is connected to a protrusion portion 54a of the drain pipe 54. Accordingly, the drain tube 56 is in a partially extended state immediately after the drain tube 56 is attached to the fuel tank 51. [0024]<br>
In Fig. 7 (b) , a substantially center portion of the drain tube 56, more specifically, a bent portion 56c between the first tube retaining hardware 311 and the second tube retaining hardware 312 is pulled horizontally as indicated by an arrow to generate looseness, thereby cancel out the partially extended state. Thus, it is possible to prevent the drain tube 56 from being squashed and an internal path from being blocked. [0025]<br>
As described with reference to Figs. 2 and 3 hereinbefore, in the motorcycle 10 (refer to Fig. 1) in which the drain pipe 54 is exposed at a lower portion of the bottom plate 132 of the fuel tank 51, and the drain tube 56 is provided on the body frame 11 (refer to Fig. 1) side to face the lower end of the drain pipe 54, the present invention is firstly characterized in that the ignition coil 138 is attached to the body frame 11 below the fuel tank 51, more specifically, the seat rails 16, 16; the<br>
upper side of the ignition coil 138 is covered with the cover member 136; and the drain tube 56 is retained by the tube retaining hole 281 provided on the cover member 136 retains.<br>
[0026]<br>
It is possible to retain the drain tube 56 as well as to cover the ignition coil 138 by the cover member 136 and to reduce the number of parts. Moreover, because the drain tube 56 is retained by the tube retaining hole 281 of the cover member 136, it is unnecessary to change the drain tube 56 and possible to utilize a commercial item as the drain tube 56. Thus, it is possible to suppress the increase in costs for the motorcycle 10.<br>
[0027]<br>
Furthermore, if the drain tube 56 is retained by the cover member 136 and the drain tube 56 is directly connected to the drain pipe 54, the drain tube 56 will not deviate from the drain pipe 54, and it is possible to ensure that the drain tube 56 is connected to the drain pipe 54.<br>
[0028]<br>
The present invention is secondly characterized in that the cover member 136 supports the harness coupler 282.<br>
It is unnecessary to specially provide a support member for the harness coupler 282 and possible to further reduce the number of parts.<br>
[0029]<br>
The present invention is thirdly characterized in that the electrical equipment is the ignition coil 138.<br>
By covering the ignition coil 138 with the cover member 136, it is possible to prevent the ignition coil 138 from being exposed to rain water.   Accordingly,  reliability of the motorcycle 10 can be enhanced. [0030]<br>
Note that the retaining portion for the drain tube is provided on the cover member which covers the upper side of the ignition coil in the present invention. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and the retaining portion can be provided on a cover member which covers other electrical equipment (e.g., an engine control unit and a battery). [0031] [Effect of the Invention]<br>

In a fuel tank drain structure of a motorcycle of claim 1, electrical equipment is attached to the body frame below the fuel tank, the upper side of the electrical equipment is covered with the cover member, and the drain tube is retained by the guide portion provided on the cover member. Accordingly, it is possible to retain the drain tube and cover the electrical equipment by the cover member and reduce the number of parts. Moreover, because the drain tube is retained by the guide portion of the cover member, it is unnecessary to change the drain tube and possible to utilize the commercial item as the drain tube. Thus, the increase in costs can be suppressed for the motorcycle.<br>
[0032]<br>
Furthermore, if the drain tube is retained by the cover member and the drain tube is directly connected to the drain pipe, the drain tube will not deviate from the drain pipe, and it is possible to ensure that the drain tube is connected to the drain pipe. [0033]<br>
