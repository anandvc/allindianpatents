				<td>Field of the Art<br>
The present invention relates to a method of forming stable states of a dense hightemperature<br>
plasma which can be used, for example, for controlled fusion.<br>
State of the Art<br>
The existing state of the art related to the realization of stable states of a dense hightemperature<br>
plasma applicable for the purposes of nuclear fusion can be defined as a stage of the<br>
formation and confinement of a plasma by a magnetic field in devices which make it possible to<br>
realize separate techniques of the claimed method but not the method as such, i.e., a method of<br>
achieving a stable state of a dense high-temperature plasma. In this respect the claimed method<br>
has no close analogs.<br>
From the state of the art a heavy-current pulsed discharge is known, which is shaped with<br>
the aid of a cylindrical discharge chamber (whose end faces function as electrodes) which is<br>
filled with a working gas (deuterium, hydrogen, a deuterium-tritium mixture at a pressure of 0.5<br>
to 10 mm Hg, or noble gases at a pressure of 0.01 toO.l mm Hg). Then a discharge of a powerful<br>
capacitor battery is effected through the gas, with the voltage of 20 to 40 kV supplied to the anode<br>
and the current in the forming discharge reaching about 1 MA. In experiments (Lukyanov<br>
S.Yu. "Hot Plasma and Controlled Fusion", Moscow, Atomizdat, 1975 (in Russian)) first a first<br>
phase of the process was observed â€” plasma compression to the axis by the current magnetic<br>
field with decrease of the current channel diameter by approximately a factor of 10 and formation<br>
a brightly glowing plasma column on the discharge axis (z-pinch). In the second phase of<br>
the process a rapid development of current channel instabilities (kinks, helical disturbances, etc.)<br>
were observed.<br>
The buildup of these instabilities occurs very rapidly and leads to the degradation of the<br>
plasma column (plasma jets outburst, discharge discontinuities, etc.), so that the discharge lifetime<br>
is limited to a value on the order of 10'" s. For this reason in a linear pinch it turns out to be<br>
unreal to fulfill the conditions of nuclear fusion defined by the Lawson criterion m &gt; 1014 cm"3s,<br>
where n is the plasma concentration, t is the discharge lifetime..<br>
A similar situation takes place in a 0- pinch, when to a cylindrical discharge chamber an<br>
external longitudinal magnetic field inducing an azimuthal current is impressed.<br>
Magnetic traps are known, which are capable of confining a high-temperature plasma for<br>
a long time (but not sufficient for nuclear fusion to proceed) within a limited volume (see Artsimovich<br>
L.A., "Closed Plasma Configurations", Moscow, Atomizdat, 1969 (in Russian)). There<br>
exist two main varieties of magnetic traps: closed and open ones.<br>
Magnetic traps are devices which are capable of confining a high-temperature plasma for<br>
a sufficiently long time within a limited volume and which are described in Artsimovich L.A.,<br>
"Closed Plasma Configurations", Moscow, Atomizdat, 1969.<br>
To magnetic traps of closed type (on which hopes to realize the conditions of controlled<br>
nuclear fusion (CNU) were pinned for a long time) there belong devices of the Tokamak,<br>
Spheromak and Stellarator type in various modifications (Lukyanov S.Yu., "Hot Plasma and<br>
CNU", Moscow, Atomizdat, 1915 (in Russian)).<br>
In devices of the Tokamak type a ring current creating a rotary transformation of magnetic<br>
lines of force is excited in the very plasma. Spheromak represents a compact torus with a<br>
toroidal magnetic field inside a plasma. Rotary transformation of magnetic lines of force, effected<br>
without exciting a toroidal current in plasma, is realized in Stellarators (Volkov E.D. et al.,<br>
"Stellarator", Moscow, Nauka, 1983 (in Russian)).<br>
Open-type magnetic traps with a linear geometry are: a magnetic bottle, an ambipolar<br>
trap, a gas-dynamic type trap (Ryutov D.D., "Open traps", Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk, 1988,<br>
vol. 154, p. 565).<br>
In spite of all the design differences of the open-type and closed-type traps, they are<br>
based on one principle: attaining hydrostatic equilibrium states of plasma in a magnetic field<br>
through the equality of the gas-kinetic plasma pressure and of the magnetic field pressure at the<br>
external boundary of plasma. The very diversity of these traps stems from the absence of positive<br>
results.<br>
When using a plasma focus device (PF) (this is how an electric discharge is called), a<br>
non-stationary bunch of a dense high-temperature (as a rule, deuterium) plasma is obtained (this<br>
bunch is also called "plasma focus"). PF belongs to the category of pinches and is formed in the<br>
area of current sheath cumulation on the axis of a discharge chamber having a special design. As<br>
a result, in contradistinction to a direct pinch, plasma focus acquires a non-cylindrical shape (Petrov<br>
D.P. et al., "Powerful pulsed gas discharge in chambers with conducting walls" in Collection<br>
of Papers "Plasma Physics and Problem of Controlled Thermonuclear Reactions", volume 4,<br>
Moscow, IzdateTstvo AN SSSR, 1958 (in Russian)).<br>
Unlike linear pinch devices, where the function of electrodes is performed by the chamber<br>
end faces, in the PF the role of the cathode is played by the chamber body, as a result of<br>
which the plasma bunch acquires the form of a funnel (thence the name of the device). With the<br>
same working parameters as in the cylindrical pinch, in a PF device a plasma having higher temperature,<br>
density and longer lifetime is obtainable, but the subsequent development of the instability<br>
destroys the discharge, as is the case in the linear pinch (Burtsev B.A. et al, "Hightemperature<br>
plasma formations" in: Itogi Nauki i Tekhniki", "Plasma Physics" Series, vol. 2,<br>
Moscow, Izdatel'stvo AN SSSR, 1981 (in Russian)), and stable states of plasma are actually not<br>
attained.<br>
Non-stationary bunches of high-temperature plasma are also obtained in gas-discharge<br>
chambers with a coaxial arrangement of electrodes (using devices with coaxial plasma injectors).<br>
The first device of such kind was commissioned in 1961 by J. Mather (Mather J.W., "Formation<br>
on the high-density deuterium plasma focus", Phys. Fluids, 1965, vol. 8, p. 366). This device<br>
was developed farther (in particular, see (J.Brzosko et al., Phys. Let. A., 192 (1994), p. 250,<br>
Phys. Let. A., 155 (1991), p. 162)). An essential element of this development was the use of a<br>
working gas doped with multielectron atoms. Injection of plasma in such devices is attained owing<br>
to the coaxial arrangement of cylindrical chambers, wherein the internal chamber functioning<br>
as the anode is disposed geometrically lower than the external cylinder â€” the cathode. In the<br>
works of J.Brzosko it was pointed out that the efficiency of the generation of plasma bunches<br>
increases when hydrogen is doped with multielectron atoms. However, in these devices the development<br>
of the instability substantially limits the plasma lifetime as well. As a result, this lifetime<br>
is smaller than necessary for attaining the conditions for a stable course of the nuclear fusion<br>
reaction. With definite design features, in particular, with the use of conical coaxial electrodes<br>
(M.P. Kozlov and A.I. Morozov (Eds.), "Plasma Accelerators and Ion Guns", Moscow,<br>
Nauka, 1984 (in Russian)), such devices are already plasma injection devices. In the aboveindicated<br>
devices (devices with coaxial cylindrical electrodes) plasma in all the stages up to the<br>
plasma decay, remains in the magnetic field area, though injection of plasma into the interelectrode<br>
space takes place. In pure form injection of plasma from the interelectrode space is observed<br>
in devices with conical coaxial electrodes. The field of application of plasma injectors is<br>
regarded to be auxiliary for plasma injection with subsequent use thereof (for example,, for addi<br>
tional pumping of power in devices of Tokamak type, in laser devices, etc.), which, in<br>
turn, has limited the use of these devices not in the pulsed mode, but in the quasi-stationary<br>
mode.<br>
Thus, the existing state of the art, based on plasma confinement by a magnetic field, does<br>
not solve the problem of confining a dense high-temperature plasma during a period of time required<br>
for nuclear fusion reactions to proceed, but effectively solves the problem of heating<br>
plasma to a state in which these reactions can proceed.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The author proposes a solution of the above-stated problem, which can be attained by a<br>
new combination of means (devices) known in the art with the use of their combination (the parameters<br>
considered earlier)., which was not only not used heretofore, but proposed or supposed<br>
in the state of the art, and which is further described in detail in the sections dealing with carryr<br>
ing the invention into effect and in the set of claims.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method of forming stable states of a dense<br>
high-temperature plasma, which comprises the following steps:<br>
a) generation of a dense high-temperature plasma from hydrogen and isotopes thereof<br>
with the aid of pulsed heavy-current discharges;<br>
b) injection of the plasma from the area of a magnetic field with parameters corresponding<br>
to the conditions of gravitational emission of electrons with a banded energy spectrum;<br>
c) energy transfer along the spectrum.<br>
The energy transfer (step c) is performed by cascade transition into the long wavelength<br>
region of eV-energy to the state of locking and amplification of the gravitational emission and<br>
simultaneous compression to the states of hydrostatic equilibrium, and in the formation of said<br>
states in the composition of a working gas multielectron atoms are used for quenching the spontaneous<br>
gravitational emission from the ground energy levels of the keV-region electron in the<br>
proper gravitational field.<br>
It is preferable that in one of the embodiment of the invention for obtaining stable states<br>
of a dense high-temperature plasma use is made of hydrogen and multielectron atoms, such as<br>
krypton, xenon, and other allied elements (neon, argon).<br>
In another preferable embodiment of the invention in order to realize the conditions for<br>
the nuclear fusion reaction to proceed use is made of hydrogen and carbon, wherein carbon is<br>
also employed both for quenching the spectra of gravitational emission with keV energies and<br>
as a fusion reaction catalyst.<br>
The claimed method provides a scheme for forming stable states of a dense hightemperature<br>
plasma, which scheme comprises a device for supplying a working gas, a discharge<br>
chamber, a discharge circuit, a chamber for forming a stable plasma bunch.<br>
If and when necessary, each of the cited blocks of the scheme can be fitted with appropriate<br>
measuring equipment.<br>
The invention is illustrated by a circuit diagram of a pulsed heavy-current magneticcompression<br>
discharge on multiply charged ions with conical coaxial electrodes, in which :<br>
1. a fast-acting valve for supplying a working gas into a gap between an internal electrode<br>
(2) and an external electrode (3);<br>
2. an external electrode;<br>
3. an internal electrode has a narrowing surface close to conical one;<br>
4. a diverter channel which prevents the entrance of admixtures into the compression<br>
area;<br>
5. a discharge circuit;<br>
6. an area of compression by a magnetic field;<br>
7. an area of compression due to efflux current in the outgoing plasma jet and subsequent<br>
compression by the emitted gravitational field.<br>
Carrying out the Invention<br>
Terms and Definitions Used in the Application<br>
The definition "stable states of a dense high-temperature plasma" denotes the states of<br>
hydrostatic equilibrium of a plasma, when the gas-dynamic pressure is counterbalanced by the<br>
pressure of a magnetic field or, in the present case, by the pressure of the emitted gravitational<br>
field.<br>
The definition "a dense high-temperature plasma" denotes a plasma with the lower values<br>
of densities nc, n, = (1023 â€” 1025) rn3 and temperatures Tc, T; = (107 â€” 108) K.<br>
The definition "plasma parameters corresponding to gravitational emission of electrons"<br>
(with a banded emission spectrum) denotes parameters which are in the above-indicated range of<br>
pressures and temperatures.<br>
The definition "locking of avitational emission in plasma" denotes the state of gravitational<br>
emission in a plasma ,which takes place when its emission frequency and electron Langmuir<br>
frequency are equal. In the present case locking of the emission takes place for two reasons:<br>
- energy transfer along the spectrum into the long wavelength region as a result of cascade<br>
transitions into the long wavelength region with attaining emission frequency (10 â€” 10 )<br>
with plasma Langmuir frequency equal to the electron one, this being the condition of locking<br>
gravitational emission in plasma;<br>
- quenching spontaneous gravitational emission of electrons from the ground energy levels<br>
by multielectron atoms, when the energy of an excited electron is transferred to an ion with<br>
corresponding energy levels, leading to its ionization.<br>
The definition "amplification of gravitational emission" denotes amplification which<br>
takes place when the gravitational emission is locked, because, with the locking conditions having<br>
been fulfilled, the gravitational emission remains in plasma with sequential emission of the<br>
total energy of the gravitational field locked in the plasma.<br>
For a better understanding of the invention, given below is a description of hightemperature<br>
plasma formations which take place in the proposed method, and a description of a<br>
method of forming their stable states as hydrostatic equilibrium states. The conditions of gravitational<br>
emission of electrons with a banded spectrum, the conditions of exciting gravitational<br>
emission in plasma, and locking and amplification owing to cascade transitions as claimed in the<br>
set of claims presented hereinbelow, are disclosed.<br>
1. Gravitational emission of electrons with a banded spectrum as emission of the<br>
same level with electromagnetic emission.<br>
For a mathematical model of interest, which describes a banded spectrum of stationary<br>
states of electrons in the proper gravitational field, two aspects are of importance. First. In Einstein's<br>
field equations K is a constant which relates the space-time geometrical properties with<br>
the distribution of physical matter, so that the origin of the equations is not connected with the<br>
numerical limitation of the K value. Only the requirement of conformity with the Newtonian<br>
Classical Theory of Gravity leads to the small value K = STtG/c4, where G, c are, respectively, the<br>
Newtonian gravitational constant and the velocity of light. Such requirement follows from the<br>
primary concept of the Einstein General Theory of Relativity (GTR) as a relativistic generalization<br>
of the Newtonian Theory of Gravity. Second. The most general form of relativistic gravitation<br>
equations are equations with the A terra. The limiting transition to weak fields leads to the<br>
equation<br>
A0 = - 47tpG +Ac2,<br>
where O is the field scalar potential, p is the source density. This circumstance, eventually, is<br>
crucial for neglecting the A term, because only in this case the GTR is a generalization of the<br>
Classical Theory of Gravity. Therefore, the numerical values of K = 8;iG/c4 and A = 0 in the<br>
GTR equations are not associated with the origin of the equations, but follow only from the conformity<br>
of the GTR with the classical theory.<br>
From the 70's onwards, it became obvious (Siravam C . and Sinha K., Phys. Res. 51<br>
(1979) 112) that in the quantum region the numerical value of G is not compatible with the principles<br>
of quantum mechanics. In a number of papers (Siravam C . and Sinha K, Phys. Res. 51<br>
(1979) 112) (including also Fisenko S. et al., Phys. Lett. A, 148,,7,9 (1990) 405)) it was shown<br>
that in the quantum region the coupling constant K (K&amp; 1040 G) is acceptable. The essence of the<br>
problem of the generalization of relativistic equations on the quantum level was thus outlined:<br>
such generalization must match the numerical values of the gravity constants in the quantum and<br>
classical regions.<br>
In the development of these results, as a micro-level approximation of Einstein's field<br>
equations, a model is proposed, based on the following assumption:<br>
"The gravitational field within the region of localization of an elementary particle having<br>
a mass mo is characterized by the values of the gravity constant K and of the constant A that lead<br>
to the stationary states of the particle in its proper gravitational field, and the particle stationary<br>
states as such are the sources of the gravitational field with the Newtonian gravity constant G".<br>
The most general approach in the Gravity Theory is the one which takes twisting into account<br>
and treats the gravitational field as a gage field, acting on equal terms with other fundamental<br>
fields (Ivanenko et al., Gage Theory of Gravitation, Moscow, MGU Publishing House,<br>
1985 (in Russian)). Such approach lacks in apriority gives no restrictions on the microscopic<br>
level. For an elementary spinor source with a mass mo, the set of equations describing its states<br>
in the proper gravitational field in accordance with the adopted assumption will have the form<br>
(1)<br>
(2)<br>
(3)<br>
 (4)<br>
(5)<br>
The following notations are used throughout the text of the paper: K = %-nK/c4, K" = 87tG/c4,<br>
En is the energy of stationary states in the proper gravitational field with the constant K, A = K(I,<br>
rn is the value of the coordinate r satisfying the equilibrium n-state in the proper gravitational<br>
field, K = KOK, KO is the dimensionality constant, Sa = ^YaY^' &gt; ^ *s tne spinor-coupling covariant<br>
derivative independent of twisting, E'n is the energy state of the particle having a mass mn<br>
(either free of field or in the external field), described by the wave function \j/' in the proper<br>
gravitational field with the constant G. The rest of the notations are generally adopted in the<br>
gravitation theory.<br>
Equations (1) through (5) describe the equilibrium states of particles (stationary states) in<br>
the proper gravitational field and define the localization region of the field characterized by the<br>
constant K that satisfies the equilibrium state. These stationary states are sources of the field with<br>
the constant G, and condition (3) provides matching the solution with the gravitational constants<br>
K and G. The proposed model in the physical aspect is compatible with the principles of quantum<br>
mechanics principles, and the gravitational field with the constants K and A at a certain,<br>
quite definite distance specified by the equilibrium state transforms into the filed having the constant<br>
G and satisfying, in the weak field limit, the Poisson equation.<br>
The set of equations (1) through (5), first of all, is of interest for the problem of stationary<br>
states, i.e., the problem of energy spectrum calculations for an elementary source in the own<br>
gravitational field. In this sense it is reasonable to use an analogy with electrodynamics, in particular,<br>
with the problem of electron stationary states in the Coulomb field. Transition from the<br>
Schrodinger equation to the Klein-Gordon relativistic equations allows taking into account the<br>
fine structure of the electron energy spectrum in the Coulomb field, whereas transition to the<br>
Dirac equation allows taking into account the relativistic fine struc<br>
ture and the energy level splitting associated with spin-orbital interaction. Using this analogy and<br>
the form of equation (1), one can conclude that solution of this equation without the term<br>
KYpYsYs gives a spectrum similar to that of the fine structure (similar in the sense of relativism<br>
and removal of the principal quantum number deugeneracy).. Taking the term K^y^Ys^Ys<br>
into account, as is noted in Siravam C. and Sinha K., Phys. Res. 51 (1979) 112 , is similar to taking<br>
into account of the term XF0/UVXFFUV, in the Pauli equation. The latter implies that the<br>
solution of the problem of stationary states with twisting taken into account will give a total energy-<br>
state spectrum with both the relativistic fine structure and energy state splitting caused by<br>
spin-twist interaction taken into account. This fact, being in complete accord with the requirements<br>
of the Gauge Theory of Gravity, allows us to believe that the above-stated assumptions<br>
concern ing the properties of the gravitational field in the quantum region are relevant, in the<br>
general case, just to the gravitational field with twists.<br>
Complexity of solving this problem compels us to employ a simpler approximation,<br>
namely,: energy spectrum calculations in a relativistic fine-structure approximation. In this approximation<br>
the problem of the stationary states of an elementary source in the proper gravitational<br>
field well be reduced to solving the following equations:<br>

Condition (9) defines rn,, whereas equations (10) through (12) are the boundary conditions<br>
and the normalization condition for the function /, respectively. Condition (9) in the general<br>
case has the form R(K,rJ = R(G,rn). Neglecting the proper gravitational field with the constant<br>
G, we shall write down this condition as R(K,rn) = 0, to which equality (9) actually corresponds.<br>
The right-hand sides of equations (7) â€” (8) are calculated basing on the general expression<br>
for the energy-momentum tensor of the complex scalar field:<br>
The appropriate components T^v are obtained by summation over the index m with application<br>
of characteristic identities for spherical functions (Warshalovich D.A. et al, Quantum<br>

Even in the simplest approximation the problem of the stationary states of an elementary source<br>
in the proper gravitational field is a complicated mathematical problem. It becomes simpler if we<br>
confine ourselves to estimating only the energy spectrum. Equation (6) can be reduced in many<br>
ways to the equations (E. Kamke, Differentialgleichungen, Losungsmethoden und Losungen,<br>
Leizig, 1959)<br>

where C is an arbitrary constant, 0(r) is the solution of the equation:<br>

In this case, the form of presentation of the solution in polar coordinates makes it possible<br>
to determine zeros of the functions f(r) at r = rm with corresponding values of 0 - nn (n being<br>

Earlier the estimate for K was adopted to be K&amp; 1.7 x 1029 Nm2kg"2. If we assume that<br>
the observed value of the electron rest mass mi is its mass in the ground stationary state in the<br>
proper gravitational field, then m0 = 4mi/3. From dimensionality considerations it follows that<br>
energy in the bound state is defined by the expression \^JKm0 j /^ =0.17xl06 xl.6xlO~1 9 J,<br>
where /^ is the classical electron radius. This leads to the estimate K Â« S.lxlO31 Nm2kg"2 which<br>
is later adopted as the starting one. Discrepancies in the estimates K obtained by different methods<br>
are quite admissible, all the more so since their character is not catastrophic. From the condition<br>
that |j, is the electron energy density it follows: (j, = l.lxlO30 J/m3, A = K|j,=4.4xl029 m"2.<br>
From (22) (with the equation for_/(/-) taken into account) it follows:<br>
(25)<br>
where<br>

The integration of equation (25) and substitution of 9 = nn, r = rn give the relation between<br>
Kn andrn:<br>

The coefficients entering into equation (26) are coefficients at simple fractions in the expansion<br>
of polynomials, required for the integration, wherein a,- ~ Kn, di ~ A{ â€” rn's, B{ ~ rn'4, A ',â€¢<br>
~ rn~2, a; ~ rn'4, di = rn~*. For ehminating rn from (26), there exists condition (9) (or the condition<br>
exp v(K,rn) = 1 equivalent to it for the approximation employed), but its direct use will complicate<br>
the already cumbersome expression (26) still further. At the same time, it easy to note that rn<br>
o<br>
~ 10" rnc, where rnc is the Compton wavelength of a particle of the mass mn, and, hence, rn ~ 10"<br>
3 AT,,"1.The relation (26) per se is rather approximate, but, nevertheless, its availability, irrespective<br>
of the accuracy of the approximation, implies the existence of an energy spectrum as a consequence<br>
of the particle self-interaction with its own gravitational field in the range r 
mutually compensating action of the field and the particle takes place. With / = 0 the approximate<br>
solution (26), with the relation between rn and Kn taken into account, has the form<br>
where a= 1.65, p = 1.60.<br>
The relation (27) is concretized, proceeding from the assumption that the observed value<br>
of the electron rest mass is the value of its mass in the grounds stationary state in the proper<br>
gravitational field, the values r\_ = 2.82 x 10" 15 m, K\ = 0.41 x 1012 m"1 giving exact zero of the<br>
function by the very definition of the numerical values for K and A.<br>
So, the presented numerical estimates for the electron show that within the range of its localization,<br>
with K~ 1031N m2 kg"2 and A~ 1029rn2, there exists the spectrum of stationary states<br>
in the proper gravitational field. The numerical value of K is, certainly, universal for any elementary<br>
source, whereas the value of A is defined by the rest mass of the elementary source. The distance<br>
at which the gravitational field with the constant K is localized is less than the Compton<br>
wavelength, and for the electron, for example, this value is of the order of its classical radius. At<br>
distances larger than this one, the gravitational field is characterized by the constant G, i.e., correct<br>
transition to Classical GTR holds.<br>
From equation (27) there follow in a rough approximation the numerical values of the stationary<br>
state energies: EI =0.511 MeV, E2 =0.638 MeV,... Ex -0.681 MeV.<br>
Quantum transitions over stationary states must lead to the gravitational emission characterized<br>
by the constant K with transition energies starting from 127 keV to 170 keV Two circumstances<br>
are essential here.<br>
First. The correspondence between the electromagnetic and gravitational interaction takes<br>
place on replacement of the electric charge e by the gravitational "charge" m^lK , so that the<br>
numerical values K place the electromagnetic and gravitational emission effects on the same<br>
level (for instance, the electromagnetic and gravitational bremsstrahlung cross-sections will differ<br>
only by the factor 0.16 in the region of coincidence of the emission spectra).<br>
Second. The natural width of the energy levels in the above-indicated spectrum of the<br>
electron stationary states will be from 10"9 eV to 10"7 eV. The small value of the energy level<br>
widths, compared to the electron energy spread in real conditions, explains why the gravitational<br>
emission effects are not observed as a mass phenomenon in epiphenomena, e.g., in the processes<br>
of electron beam bremsstrahlung on targets. A direct confirmation of the presence of the electron<br>
stationary states in the own gravitational field with the constant K may be the presence of the<br>
lower boundary of nuclear p-decay. Only starting with this boundary |3-asymmetry can take<br>
place, which is interpreted as parity non-conservation in weak interactions, but is actually only a<br>
consequence of the presence of the excited states of electrons in the own gravitational field in pdecay.<br>
Beta-asymmetry was observed experimentally only in p-decay of heavy nuclei in magnetic<br>
field (for example, 27C60 in the known experiment carried out by Wu (Wu Ts.S.,<br>
Moshkovskii S.A., Beta-decay, Atomizdat, Moscow, 1970 (in Russian)). On light nuclei, such<br>
as iH3, where the p-decay asymmetry al- ready must not take place, similar experiments<br>
were not carried out.<br>
2. Conditions of Gravitational Emission in Plasma (Excitation<br>
of Gravitational Emission in Plasma)<br>
For the above-indicated energies of transitions over stationary states in the own field and<br>
the energy level widths, the sole object in which gravitational emission can be realized as a mass<br>
phenomenon will be, as follows from the estimates given below, a dense high-temperature<br>
plasma.<br>
Using the Born approximation for the bremsstrahlung cross-section, we can write down<br>
the expression for the electromagnetic bremsstrahlung per unit of volume per unit of time as<br>
Q=? -mc2neni = 0.l7xlO-39z\nijT:, (28)<br>
where Te, k, nj, ne, m, z, r0 are the electron temperature, Boltzmann's constant, the concentration<br>
of the ionic and electronic components, the electron mass, the serial number of the ionic component,<br>
the classical electron radius, respectively.<br>
Replacing r0 by rg = 2K m/s2 (which corresponds to replacing the electric charge e by the<br>
gravitational charge rm/K), we can use for the gravitational bremsstrahlung the relation<br>
Qg = 0.16Qe. (29)<br>
From (28) it follows that in a dense high-temperature plasma with parameters n,. = n; =<br>
23 o i-t<br>
10 m", Te = 10 K, the specific power of the electromagnetic bremsstrahlung is equal to Â« 0.53<br>
1010 J/m3 s, and the specific power of the gravitational bremsstrahlung is 0.86 109 J/m3 s. These<br>
values of the plasma parameters, apparently, can be adopted as guide threshold values of an appreciable<br>
gravitational emission level, because the relative proportion of the electrons whose energy<br>
on the order of the energy of transitions in the own gravitational field, diminishes in accordance<br>
with the Maxwellian distribution exponent as Te decreases.<br>
3. Locking and Amplification of Gravitational Emission by Cascade<br>
Transitions and Quenching Spontaneous Emission from Ground energy levels<br>
by Ions of Multielectron Atoms in Plasma Injected from Magnetic Field Area<br>
For the numerical values of the plasma parameters Te = Ti = (!07â€”108)K, ne = nt<br>
- (10 â€”10 ) m" the electromagnetic bremsstrahlung spectrum will not change essentially with<br>
Compton scattering of electron emission, and the bremsstrahlung itself is a source of emission<br>
losses of a high-temperature plasma. The frequencies of this continuous spectrum are on the order<br>
of (101 â€”1020) s"1, while the plasma frequency for the above-cited plasma parameters is<br>
(1013â€”1014) s"1, or 0.1 eV of the energy of emitted quanta.<br>
The fundamental distinction of the gravitational bremsstrahlung from the electromagnetic<br>
bremsstrahlung is the banded spectrum of the gravitational emission, corresponding to the spectrum<br>
of the electron stationary states in the own gravitational field.<br>
The presence of cascade transitions from the upper excited levels to the lower ones will<br>
lead to that the electrons, becoming excited in the energy region above 100 keV, will be emitted,<br>
mainly, in the eV region, i.e., energy transfer along the spectrum to the low-frequency region<br>
will take place. Such energy transfer mechanism can take place only in quenching spontaneous<br>
emission from the lower electron energy levels in the own gravitational field, which rules out<br>
emission with quantum energy in the keV region. A detailed description of the mechanism of<br>
energy transfer along the spectrum will hereafter give its precise numerical characteristics. Nevertheless,<br>
undoubtedly, the very fact of its existence, conditioned by the banded character of the<br>
spectrum of the gravitational bremsstrahlung, can be asserted. The low-frequency character of<br>
the gravitational bremsstrahlung spectrum will lead to its amplification in plasma by virtue of the<br>
loeking condition a&gt;g 
From the standpoint of practical realization of the states of a high-temperature plasma<br>
compressed by the emitted gravitational field, two circumstances are of importance.<br>
First. Plasma must comprise two components, with multiply charged ions added to hydrogen,<br>
these ions being necessary for quenching spontaneous emission of electrons from the<br>
ground energy levels in the own gravitational field. For this purpose it is necessary to have ions<br>
with the energy levels of electrons close to the energy levels of free excited electrons. Quenching<br>
of the lower excited states of the electrons will be particularly effective in the presence of a resonance<br>
between the energy of excited electron and the energy of electron excitation in the ion (in<br>
the limit, most favorable case â€” ionization energy). An increase of z increases also the specific<br>
power of the gravitational bremsstrahlung, so that on the condition a&gt;g 
the equality of the gas-kinetic pressure and the radiation pressure<br>
k(ne Te + m Ti) = 0.16(0.17 10'39 z2 ne n; J)At (30)<br>
will take place at At = (10"6 â€”10"7) s for the permissible parameter values of compressed<br>
plasmane = (1 + a) ru = (1025 â€” 1026) ni3, a &gt; 2, TeÂ» Te = 108K, z&gt;10.<br>
Second. The necessity of plasma ejection from the region of the magnetic field with the<br>
tentative parameters ne = (1023 â€” 1024) m"3, Te = (107 â€” 10s) K with subsequent energy pumping<br>
from the magnetic field region.<br>
The fulfillment of the above-cited conditions (in principle, irrespective of a particular<br>
scheme of the apparatus in which these conditions are realized) solves solely the problem of attaining<br>
hydrostatic equilibrium states of plasma. The use of a multielectron gas (carbon) as the<br>
additive to hydrogen leads to the realization of nuclear fusion reaction conditions, since carbon<br>
will simultaneously will act as a catalyst required for the nuclear fusion reaction.<br>
Another variant of nuclear fusion in compositions with multielectron atoms, such as krypton,<br>
xenon (and allied elements) is the use of a deuterium-tritium mixture as the light component.<br>
An analysis of the processes which take place in the known devices for generating stable<br>
high-temperature states of a plasma (as well as the absence of encouraging results) suggests that<br>
the magnetic field can be used only partially, in the first step for the retention and heating plasma<br>
in the process of forming its high-energy state. Further presence of the magnetic field no longer<br>
confines the plasma within a limited volume, but destroys this plasma owing to the specific character<br>
of motion of charged particles in the magnetic field. A principal solution of the problem is<br>
a method of confining of an already heated plasma in an emitted gravitational field in a second<br>
step, after the plasma has been compressed, heated and retained during this period by the magnetic<br>
field. As follows from the above-stated, under any circumstances. Plasma must be injected<br>
from the magnetic field region, but with subsequent pumping of energy from the region of the<br>
plasma found in the magnetic field. It is just to these conditions that, among other things, there<br>
corresponds the original circuit diagram of a magnetoplasma compressor, presented in the specification<br>
to the Application.<br>
The claimed method is realized in the following manner (see the diagram): through a<br>
quick-acting valve 1 a two-component gas (hydrogen + a multielectron gas) is supplied into a<br>
gap between coaxial conical electrodes 2, 3, to which voltage is fed through a discharge circuit 5.<br>
A discharge creating a magnetic field flows between the electrodes. Under the pressure of the<br>
arising amperage, plasma is accelerated along the channel. At the outlet in a region 7 the flow<br>
converges to the axis, where a region of compression with high density and temperature originates.<br>
The formation of the region of compression 7 is favored by efflux currents which flow in<br>
the outgoing plasma jet. With the voltage fed to the anode (20â€”40) kV and the starting pressure<br>
of the working gas (0.5â€”0.8)mmHg, and when the current in the forming discharge<br>
reaches about 1 MA in the region of compression, the values of the plasma parameters ne, n; =<br>
(1023â€”1025) m'3 and of the temperatures Te, Ti = (107â€”108) K, necessary for the excitation of<br>
the gravitational field of the plasma, will be reached. The presence of the ions of multielectron<br>
atoms in the composition of the working gas, which lead to quenching the gravitational emission<br>
from the ground energy levels of the electrons, and cascade transitions along the levels of the<br>
electron stationary states in the own gravitational field will lead to the transformation of the<br>
high-frequency emission spectrum into the lows-frequency one with frequencies corresponding<br>
to locking and amplification of the plasma emission. Simultaneously the density and temperature<br>
of the plasma will grow owing to its pulsed injection. Therefore, sub sequent compression of the<br>
plasmas after its injection from the magnetic field region to the state of hydrostatic equilibrium<br>
(formation of the stable stat of the dense high-temperature plasma) takes place owing to the excitation,<br>
locking and compression of the plasma by the radiated gravitational field, with the attainment<br>
of the plasma parameters ne, nj = (1025â€”1026) m"3 and Te, T{ = 108 K<br>
The fundamental difference of such scheme from the known schemes used for obtaining<br>
plasmodynamic discharges (Kamrukov A.S. et al., "Generators of laser and powerful thermal<br>
radiation, based on heavy-current plasmodynamic discharges" in the book "Plasma Accelerators<br>
and Ion Guns", Moscow, Nauka, 1984 (in Russian)), when using this scheme as a quantum generator<br>
of gravitational emission (a quantum generator of gravitational emission being just the<br>
generator of stable high-energy states of a dense plasma) is as follows:<br>
1. The pulsed character of the discharge circuit with the volt-ampere characteristics corresponding<br>
to the plasmodynamic discharge;<br>
2. The definite ratio of the hydrogen component and of the multielectron gas component<br>
(approximately 80% and 20%, respectively), including the purposed of attaining the required<br>
temperature parameters of the plasma.<br>
3. The close correspondence of the electron energy levels in the employed multielectron<br>
gas with the lower electron energy level in the own gravitational field, which requires using such<br>
gases as krypton and xenon as the multielectron gas. Here both the percentage of the multielectron<br>
atoms, limited from below by the requirement of quenching the excited lower energy states<br>
of the electron (in the own gravitational field) and from above by the requirement of attaining the<br>
necessary plasma temperature should be adjusted.<br>
One skilled in the art will understand that various modifications and variants of<br>
embodying the invention are possible, all of them being comprised in the scope of the Applicant's<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
