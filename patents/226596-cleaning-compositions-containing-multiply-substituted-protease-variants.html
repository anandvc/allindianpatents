Methods for using the cleaning compositions are also provided.FIgLD OF T E INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to cleaning compositions which comprise one or more multiply-substituted protease variants and one or more cleaning adjunct materials. More particularly, the present invention relates to laundry detergent compositions, dishwashing detergent compositions, hard surface cleaning compositions and personal cleansing compositions which comprise one or more multiply-substituted protease variants and one or more cleaning adjunct materials.<br>
	flACKGRQLTND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various types of enzymes have long been used in laundry detergents to assist in the removal of certain stabs from fabrics. Each class of enzyme (amylase, protease, etc.) generally catalyzes a different chemical reaction. For example, protease enzymes are known for their ability to hydrolyze (break down a compound into two or more simpler compounds) other proteins. This ability has been taken advantage of through the incorporation of naturally occurring or engineered protease enzymes to laundry detergent compositions.<br>
In recent years the use of enzymes has also been investigated for use in automatic dishwashing compositions. Unfortunately, many enzymes, such as many conventional<br>
protease enzymes, do not translate well into ihe wash environment. Specifically, thermal stability, pH stability, oxidative stability and substrate specificity need to be optimized to ensure satisfactory performance.<br>

P5SCPJPTIQN QF THE INVENTION<br>
Proteases - Proteases are carbonyl hydrolases which generally act to cleave peptide bonds of proteins or peptides. As used herein, "protease" means a naturally occurring<br>
protease or recombinant protease. Naturally-occurring proteases include a-aminoacylpeptide hydrolase, peptidylarnino acid hydrolase, acylamino hydrolase, serine carboxypeptidase, metallocarboxypeptidase, thiol proteinase, carboxylproteinase and metalloproteinase. Serine, metallo, thiol and acid protease are included, as well as endo and exo-proteases.<br>
The present invention includes protease enzymes which are non-naturally occurring carbonyl hydrolase variants (protease variants) having a different proteolytic activity, stability, substrate specificity, pH profile and/or performance characteristic as compared to the precursor carbonyl hydrolase from which the amino acid sequence of the variant is derived. Specifically, such protease variants have an amino acid sequence not found in nature, which is derived by replacement of a plurality of amino acid residues of a precursor protease with different amino acids. The precursor protease may be a naturally-occurring protease or recombinant protease. As stated earlier, the protease variants are designed to have trypsin-like specificity and preferably also be bleach stable.<br>
The protease variants useful herein encompass the substitution of any of the nineteen naturally occurring L-amino acids at the designated amino acid residue positions. Such substitutions can be made in any precursor subtilisin (procaryotic, eucaryotic, mammalian, etc.). Throughout this application reference is made to various amino acids by way of common one- and three-letter codes. Such codes are identified in Dale, M.W. (1989), Molecular Genetics of Bacteria, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd,, Appendix B.<br>
The protease variants useful herein are preferably derived from a Bacillus subtilisin. More preferably, the protease variants are derived from Bacillus lentus subtilisin and/or subtilisin 309.<br>
Carbonyl Hydrolases - Carbonyl hydrolases are protease enzymes which hydrolyze compounds containing<br>

bonds in which X is oxygen or nitrogen. They include naturally-occurring carbonyl hydrolases and recombinant carbonyl hydrolases. Naturally-occurring carbonyl hydrolases principally include hydrolases, e.g., peptide hydrolases such as subtilisins or metalloproteases. Peptide hydrolases include a-aminoacylpeptide hydrolase, peptidylarnino acid hydrolase, acylamino hydrolase, serine carboxypeptidase, metallocarboxypeptidase, thiol proteinase. carboxylproteinase and metalloproteinase. Serine, metallo, thiol and acid protease's are included, as well as endo and exo-proteases.<br>
Subtilisins - Subtilisins are bacterial or fungal proteases which generally act to cleave peptide bonds of proteins or peptides. As used herein, "subtilisin" means a<br><br>
naturally-occurring subtilisin or a recombinant subtilisin. A series of naturally-occurring subtilisins is known to be produced and often secreted by various microbial species. Amino acid sequences of the members of this series are not entirely homologous. However, the subtilisins in this series exhibit the same or similar type of proteolytic activity. This class of serine proteases share a common ammo acid sequence defining a catalytic triad which distinguishes them from the chymotrypsin related class of serine proteases. The subtilisins and chymotrypsin related serine proteases both have a catalytic triad comprising aspartate, histidine and serine. In the subtilisin related proteases the relative order of these amino acids, reading from amino to carboxy terminus, is aspartate-histidine-serine. In the chymotrypsin related proteases, the relative order, however, is histidine-aspartate-serme. Thus, subtilisin herein refers to a serine protease having the catalytic triad of subtilisin related proteases. Examples include, but are not limited to, the subiilisins identified in Fig. 3 herein. Generally, and for purposes of the present invention, numbering of the ammo acids in proteases corresponds to the numbers assigned to the mature Bacillus amylollqu&amp;factens subtilisin sequence presented in Fig. 1.<br>
Protease Variants - A "protease variant" has an amino acid sequence which is derived from the &amp;mino acid sequence of a "precursor protease." The precursor proteases include naturally-occurring proteases and recombinant proteases. The amino acid sequence of the protease variant is "derived" from the precursor protease amino acid sequence by substitution, deletion or insertion of one or more amino acids of the precursor amino acid sequence. Such modification is of the "precursor DNA sequence" which encodes the amino acid sequence of the precursor protease rather than manipulation of the precursor protease enzyme per se. Suitable methods for such manipulation of the precursor DNA sequence include methods disclosed herein, as well at methods know to those skilled in the art (see, for example, EP 0 328 299, WO 89/06279 and the U.S. patents and applications already teftfenced herein).<br>

Prpte^ggft/Recombinant Subtilising . A 'recombinfttrt protease1' or "recombinant subtilisin" refers to a protease or subtilisin in which the DNA sequence encoding the naturally-occurring protease or subtilisin, respectively, is modified to produce a mutant DNA sequence which encodes the substitution, insertion or deletion of one or more amino acids in the protease or subtilisin amino acid sequence. Suitable modification methods are disclosed herein, and in U.S. Patent Nos. RE 34,606, 5,204,015 and 5,185,258.<br>
Non-Human Proteases/Non-Human Subtilising - "Non-human proteases" or "non-human subtilisins" and the DNA encoding them may be obtained from many procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms. Suitable examples of procaryotic organisms include gram negative organisms such as E. colt or Pseudomonas and gram positive bacteria such as<br><br>
Micrococcus or Bacillus, Examples of eucaryotic organisms from which carbonyl hydrotase and their genes may be obtained include yeast such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, fungi such as Aspergillus sp, and non-human mammalian sources such as, for example, bovine sp, from which the gene encoding the protease chymostn or subtilism chymosin can be obtained. A series of proteases and/or subtilisins can be obtained from various related species which have amino acid sequences which are not entirely homologous between the members of that series but which nevertheless exhibit the same or similar type of biological activity. Thus, non-human protease or non-human subtilism as used herein have a functional definition which refers to proteases or subtilisins, respectively, which art associated, directly or indirectly, with procaryotic and eucaryotic sources.<br>
Variant DNA Sequences - Variant DNA sequences encoding such protease or subtilism variants are derived from a precursor DNA sequence which encodes a naturally-occurring or recombinant precursor enzyme. The variant DNA sequences are derived by modifying the precursor DNA sequence to encode the substitution of one or more specific amino acid residues encoded by the precursor DNA sequence corresponding to positions 103 in combination with one or more of the following positions 1, 3, 4, 8,9,10, 12,13, 16, 17, 18, 19,20,21,22,24, 27, 33,37,38,42, 43, 48, 55, 57, 58, 61, 62, 68,72, 75, 76, 77, 7«, 79, 86, 87,89,97,98, 99,101,102,104, 106,107, 109, 111,114, 116,117,119,121, 123, 126, 128, BO, 131, 133, 134, 337, 140, 141, 142, 146, 147, 158, 159, 160, 166, 167, 170, 173, 174,177,181,182, 183, 184, 185, 188,192,194,198,203,204,205,206,209, 210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,222,224,227,228,230,232,236,237,238, 240, 242,243,244,245,246,247,248, 249, 251, 252, 253,254, 255, 256, 257,258,259, 260,261,262,263,265,268,269,270,271,272,274 and 275 of Bacillus amyloHqvefaciens subtilism; wherein when said protease variant includes a substitution of amino acid residues at positions corresponding to positions 103 and 76, there is also a subtitution of an amino acid residue at one or more amino acid residue positions other than amino acid residue positions corresponding to positions 27,99,101, 104, 107, 109, 123, 128,166, 204, 206,210,216,217,218, 222, 260, 265 or 274 of Bacillus amyioliquefacieru subtilisin. Although the aoiino acid residues identified for modification herein are identified according to the numbering applicable to B, amyloliquefacietts (which has become the conventional method for identifying residue positions in all subtilisins), the preferred precursor DNA sequence useful for the present invention is the DNA sequence of Bacillus hntus as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, these variant DNA sequences encode the substitution, insertion or deletion of the amino .acid residue corresponding to position 103 of Bacillus amyloliquefacien$ subtilisin in combination with one or more additional amino acid residues corresponding to positions 1, 3, 4, 8,9, 10,12, 13,16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24,<br><br>

In another preferred embodiment, these variant DNA sequences encode the substitution, insertion or deletion of one or more of the amino acid residues corresponding to positions 62,212,230,232,252 and 257 of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin. More preferably, these variant DNA sequences encode the protease variants described herein.<br>
Although the amino acid residues identified for modification herein are identified according to the numbering applicable to B. amyloliquefaciens (which has become the conventional method for identifying residue positions in all subtilising), the preferred precursor DNA sequences useful for the present invention is the DNA sequence of Bacillus lentus as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
These recombinant DNA sequences encode protease variants having a novel amino acid sequence and, in general, at least one property which is substantially different from the same property of the enzyme encoded by the precursor protease DNA sequence. Such<br>

corresponding to positions 103 and 76, there is also a subtitution of an amino acid residue at one or more amino acid residue positions other than amino acid residue positions corresponding to positions 27,99, 101, 104,107, 109, 123,128,166, 204,206, 210,216, 217, 218, 222,260,265 or 274 wherein the numbered positions correspond to the naturally-occurring subtilisin from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens or to equivalent amino acid residues in other carbonyl hydrolases or subtilUJns (such as Bacillus lentus subtilisin) are described herein. Further, specific substitutions corresponding to one or more of the following positions 62,212,230,232,252 and 257 wherein the numbered positions correspond to the naturally-occurring subtilisin from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens or to equivalent amino acid residues in other carbonyl hydrolases or subtilisins (such as Bacillus lentus subtilisin) are described herein. These amino acid position numbers refer to those assigned to the mature Bacillus amyhUquefaciens subtilisin sequence presented in Fig. 1. The present invention, however, is not limited to the use of mutation of this particular subtilisin but extends to precursor proteases containing amino acid residues at positions which are "equivalent" to the particular identified residues in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the precursor protease is Bacillus lentus subtilisin and the substitutions, deletions or insertions are made at the equivalent amino acid residue in B, lentus corresponding to those listed above.<br>
A residue (amino acid) of a precursor protease is equivalent to a residue of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin if it is either homologous (i.e., corresponding in position in either primary or tertiary structure) or analogous to a specific residue or portion of that residue in Bacillus atnyloliquefaciens subtilisin (i.e., having the same or similar functional capacity to combine, react or interact chemically).<br>
In order to establish homology to primary structure, the amino acid sequence of a precursor protease is directly compared to the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin primary sequence and particularly to a set of residues known to be invariant in subtilisins for which sequence is known. For example, Fig. 2 herein shows the conserved residues as between B. amyloliquefaciens subtilisin and B. lentus subtilisin, After aligning the conserved residues, allowing for necessary insertions and deletions in order to maintain alignment (i.e., avoiding the elimination of conserved residues through arbitrary deletion and insertion), the residues equivalent to particular amino acids in the primary sequence of Bacillus aitiyloliqvefaciens subtilisin are defined. Alignment of conserved residues preferably should conserve 100% of such residues. However, alignment of greater than 75% or as little as 50% of conserved residues is also adequate to define equivalent residues. Conservation of the catalytic triad, Asp32/His64/Ser221 should be maintained.<br>
For example, in Fig. 3 the amino acid sequence of subtilisin from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis (carlsbergensis) and Bacillus<br><br>
lentus arc aligned to provide the maximum amount of homology between amino acid sequences. A comparison of these sequences shows that there are a number of conserved residues contained in each sequence. These conserved residues (as between BPN' and 5. lentus} are identified in Fig. 2,<br>
Th«se conserved residues, thus, may be used to define the corresponding equivalent amino acid residues of Bacillus lentus (PCT Publication No. W089/06279 published July 13&gt; 1989), the preferred protease precursor enzyme herein, or the subtilisin referred to as PB92 (EP 0 328 299), which is highly homologous to the preferred Bacillus lentus subtilisin. The amino acid sequences of certain of these subtilising are aligned in Figs. 3 A and 3B with the sequence of Bacillus amyhliquefaciens subtilisin to produce th« maximum homology of conserved residues. As can be seen, there are a number of deletion in the sequence of Bacillus lentus as compared to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin. Thus, for example, the equivalent amino acid for Val 165 in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin in the other subtilisins is isoleucine for B. lentus and B. lichenifonnis.        Thus, for example, the amino acid at position +76 is asparagine (N) in both B. amylolique/aciens and B. lentus subntisms. In the protease variants of the invention, however, the amino acid equivalent to +76 in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin is substituted with aspartate (D). The abbreviations and one letter codes for all amino acids in the present invention conform to the Patentin User Manual (QenBank, Mountain View, CA) 1990, p. 101.<br>
"Equivalent residues" may also be defined by determining homology at the level of tertiary structure for a precursor protease whose tertiary structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography. Equivalent residues are defined as those for which the atomic coordinates of two or more of the main chain atoms of a particular amino acid residue of the precursor protease and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin (N on N, CA on C A, C on C and O on 0) are within 0.13nm and preferably 0,1 nm after alignment. Alignment is achieved after the best model has been oriented and positioned to give the maximum overlap of atomic coordinates of non-hydrogen protein atoms of the protease in question to the Bacillus amylolique/aciens subtilisin. The best model is the crystallographic model giving the lowest R factor for experimental diffraction data at the highest resolution available.<br>
Equivalent residues which are functionally analogues to a specific residue of Bacillus amyhliquefaciens subtilisin are defined as those amino acids of the precursor protease which may adopt a conformation such that they either alter, modify or contribute to protein structure, substrate binding or catalysis in a manner defined and attributed to a specific residue of the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin. Further, they are those<br><br>
residues of the precursor protease (for which a tertiary structure has been obtained by x-ray crystallography) which occupy an analogous position to the extent that, although the main chain; atoms of the given residue may not satisfy the criteria of equivalence on the basis of occupying a homologous position, the atomic coordinates of at least two fo the side chain atoms of the residue He with 0.13nm of the corresponding side chain atoms of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin. The coordinates of the three dimensional structure of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin are set forth in EPQ Publication No. 0 251 446 (equivalent to US Patent 5,182,204, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) and can be used as outlined above to determine equivalent residues on the level of tertiary structure.<br>
Some of the residues identified for substitution, insertion or deletion are conserved residues whereas others are not. In the case of residues which are not conserved, the replacement of one or more amino acids is limited to substitutions which produce a variant which has an amino acid sequence that does not correspond to one found in nature. In the case of conserved residues, such replacements should not result in natural-occurring sequence. The protease variants of the present invention include the mature forms of protease variants, as well as the pro- and pre-pro-forms of such protease variants, The prcpro-forms are the preferred construction since this facilitates the expression, secretion and maturation of the protease variants.<br>
"Prosequence" refers to a sequence of amino acids bound to the N-terminal portion of the mature form of a protease which when removed results in the appearance of the "mature" form of the protease. Many proteolytic enzymes are found in nature as translational proenzyme products and, in the absence of post-translational processing, are expressed in this fashion. A preferred prosequence for producing protease variants is the putative prosequence of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin, although other protease prosequences may be used.<br>
A "signal sequence" or "presequence" refers to any sequence of amino acids bound<br>
-"i'V<br>
tfl$iie&gt;N'terminal portion of a protease or to the N-terminal portion of a proprotease which<br>
•,./-' .    •»<br>
may participate in the secretion of the mature or pro forms of the protease. This definition of signal sequence is a functional one, meant to include all those amino sequences encoded by the N-terminal portion of the protease gene which participate in the effectuation of the secretion of protease under native conditions. The present invention utilizes such sequences to effect the secretion of the protease variants as defined here, One possible signal sequence comprises the first seven amino acid residues of the signal sequence from Bacillus subtilis subtilisin fused to the remainder of the signal sequence of the subtilisin from Bacillus lentusJATCC 21536),<br><br>
A "prepro" form of a protease variant consists of the mature form of the protease •having a prosequence operably linked to the amino terminus of the protease and a "pre" or "signal" sequence operably finked to the amino terminus of the prosequence.<br>
"Expression vector" refers to a DNA construct containing a DNA sequence which is operably linked to a suitable control sequence capable of effecting the expression of said DNA in a suitable host. Such control sequences include a promoter to effect transcription, an optional operator sequence to control such transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosome binding sites and sequences which control termination of transcription and translation. The vector may be a plasmid, a phage particle, or simply a potential genomic insert. Once transformed into a suitable host, the vector may replicate and function independently or the host genome, or may, in some instances, integrate into the genome itself. In the present specification, "plasmid" and "vector" are sometimes used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector at present. However, the invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors which serve equivalent functions and which are, or become, known in the art.<br>
The "host cells" used in the present invention generally are procaryotic or eucaryotic hosts which preferably have been manipulated by the methods disclosed in US Patent RE 34,606 to render them incapable of secreting enzymatically active endoprotease. A preferred host cell for expressing protease is the Bacillus strain BG2036 which is deficient in enzymatically active neutral protease and alkaline protease (subtilisin). The construction of strain BG2036 is described in detail in US Patent 5,264,366. Other host cells for expressing protease include Bacillus subtilis 168 (also described in US Patent R£ 34,606 and US Patent 5,264,366, the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference), as well as any suitable Bacillus strain such as B. Hcheni/ormis, B, femur, etc.).<br>
Host cells are transformed or transfected with vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques. Such transformed host cells are capable of either replicating<br>
Vr"   ' **<br>
vectors encoding the protease variants or expressing the desired protease variant. In the case of vectors which encode the pre- or prepro-form of the protease variant, such variants, when expressed, are typically secreted from the host cell in to the host cell medium.<br>
"Operably linked, "when describing the relationship between two DNA regions, simply means that they are functionally related to each other. For example, a prosequence is operably linked to a peptide if it functions as a signal sequence, participating in the secretion of the mature form of the protein most probably involving cleavage of the signal sequence. A promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if it controls the transcription of the sequence; a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to permit translation.<br><br><br>
The genes encoding the naturally-occurring precursor protease may be obtained in accord with the general methods known to those skilled in the an. The methods generally comprise synthesizing labeled probes having putative sequences encoding regions of the protease of interest, preparing genomic libraries from organisms expressing the protease, and screening the libraries for the gene of interest by hybridization to the probes. Positively hybridizing clones are then mapped and sequenced.<br>
The cloned protease is then used to transform a host cell in order to express the protease. The protease gene is then ligated into a high copy number plasm id. This piasmid replicates in hosts in the sense that it contains the well-known elements necessary for piasmid replication: a promote operably linked to the gene in question (which may be supplied as the gene's own homologous promoter if it is recognized, i.e. transcribed by th« host), a transcription termination and poiyadenylation region (necessary for stability of the mRNA transcribed by the host from the protease gene in certain eucaryotic host cells) which is exogenous or is supplied by the endogenous terminator region of the protease gene and, desirably, a selection gene such as an antibiotic resistance gene that enables continuous cultural maintenance of plasm id-infected host cells by growth in antibiotic-containing media. High copy number plasm ids also contain an origin of replication for the host, thereby enabling large numbers of plasm ids to be generated in the cytoplasm without chromosomal limitation. However, it is within the scope herein to integrate multiple copies of the protease gene into host genome. This Is facilitated by procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms which are particularly susceptible to homologous recombination.       The gene can be a natural B. lentus gene. Alternatively, a synthetic gene encoding a naturally-occurring or mutant precursor protease may be produced. In such an approach, the DNA and/or amino acid sequence of the precursor protease is determined. Multiple, overlapping synthetic single-stranded DNA fragments are thereafter synthesized, which upon hybridization and ligation produce a synthetic DNA enclding the precursor protease. An<br>
pie of synthetic gene construction is set forth in Example 3 of US Patent 5,204,105, sclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Once the naturally-occurring or synthetic precursor protease gene has been cloned, a number of modifications are undertaken to enhance the use of the gene beyond synthesis of the naturally-occurring precursor protease. Such modifications include the production of recombinant proteases as disclosed in US Patent RE 34,606 and EPO Publication No, 0 251 446 and the production of protease variants described herein.<br>
The following cassette mutagenesis method may be used to facilitate the construction of the proteases variants of the present invention, although other methods may be used. First, the naturally-occurring gene encoding the protease is obtained and sequenced in whole or in part. Then the sequence is scanned for a point at which it is<br><br>
desired to make a mutation (deletion, insertion or substitution) of one or more amino acids in the encoded enzyme. The sequences flanking this point are evaluated for the presence of restriction sites for replacing a short segment of the gene with an oligonucleotide pool which, when expressed will encode various mutants. Such restriction sites are preferably unique sites within the protease gene so as to facilitate the replacement of the gene segment. However, any convenient restriction site which is not overly redundant in the protease gene may be used, provided the gene fragments generated by restriction digestion can be reassembled in proper sequence. If restriction sites are not present at locations within a convenient distance from the selected point (from 10 to 15 nucleotides), such sites are generated by substituting nucleotides in the gene in such fashion that neither the reading frame nor the amino acids encoded are changed in the final construction. Mutation of the gene in order to change its sequence to conform to the desired sequence is accomplished by M13 primer extension in accord with generally known methods. The task of locating suitable flanking regions and evaluating the needed changes to arrive at two convenient restriction site sequences is made routine by the redundancy of the genetic code, a restriction enzyme map of the gene and the large number of different restriction enzymes, Note that if a convenient flanking restriction site if available, the above method need be used only in connection with the flanking region which does not contain a site.<br>
Once the naturally-occurring DNA or synthetic DNA is cloned, the restriction sites flanking the positions to be mutated are digested with the cognate restriction enzymes and a plurality of end termini-complementary oligonucleotide cassettes are ligated into the gene. The mutagenesis is simplified by this method because all of the oligonucleotides can be synthesized so as to have the same restriction sites, and no synthetic linkers are necessary to create the restriction sites.     As used herein, proteolytic activity is defined as the rate of hydrolysis of peptide bonds per milligram of active enzyme. Many well known procedures exist for measuring proteolytic activity (K. M. Kalisz, "Microbial Proteinases," Advances in^liocherqjqal Engineering/Biotechnology. A, Fiechter ed., 1988), In addition to or as an alternative to modified proteolytic activity, the variant enzymes of the present invention<br>
•
rosy have other modified properties such as K^,, k^ k^/K* ratio and/or modified substrate specifically and/or modified pH activity profile. These enzymes can be tailored for the particular substrate which is anticipated to be present, for example, in the preparation of peptides or for hydrolytic processes such as laundry uses.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the objective is to secure a variant protease having altered proteolytic activity as compared to the precursor protease, since increasing such activity (numerically larger) enables the use of the enzyme to more efficiently act on a target substrate. Also of interest are variant enzymes having altered thermal stability and/or altered substrate specificity as compared to the precursor. In some instances, lower<br><br>
proteolytic activity may be desirable, for example a decrease in proteolytic activity would be useful where the synthetic activity of the proteases is desired (as for synthesizing peptides). One may wish to decrease this proteolytic activity, which is capable of destroying the product of such synthesis. Conversely, in some instances it may be desirable to increase the proteolytic activity of the variant enzyme versus its precursor.

Methods and procedures for making the enzymes used in the detergent and cleaning compositions of the present invention are known and are disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 95/10615.<br>
The enzymes of the present invention have trypsin-like specificity. That is, th« enzymes of the present invention hydrolyze proteins by preferentially cleaving the peptide bonds of charged amino acid residues, more specifically residues such as arginine and lysine, rather than preferentially cleaving the peptide bonds of hydrophobia amino acid residues, more specifically phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine. Enzymes having the<br><br>
latter profile have a chymotrypsin-like specificity. Substrate specificity as discussed above Is illustrated by the action of the enzyme on two synthetic substrates. Protease's having trypsjn-like specificity hydrolyze the synthetic substrate bVGR-pNA pieferentially over the synthetic substrate sucAAPF-pNA. Chymotrypsin-like protease enzymes, in contrast, hydrolyze the latter much faster than the former. For the purposes of the present invention the following procedure was employed to define the trypsin-like specificity of the protease enzymes of the present Invention:<br>
A fixed amount of a glycine buffer at a pH of 10 and a temperature of 25 *C is added to a standard 10 ml test tube. 0.5 ppm of the active enzyme to be tested is added to the test tube. Approximately, 1.25 mg of the synthetic substrate per mL of buffer solution is added to the test tube. The mixture ia allowed to incubate for 15 minutes at 25 °C. Upon completion of the incubation period, an enzyme inhibitor, PMSF, is added to the mixture at a level of 0.5 mg per mL of buffer solution. The absorbency or OD value of the mixture is read at a 410 run wavelength. The absorbence then indicates the activity of the enzyme on the synthetic substrate. The greater the absorbence, the higher the level of activity against that substrate.<br>
To then determine the specificity of an individual enzyme, the absorbence on the two synthetic substrate proteins may be converted into a specificity ratio. For the purposes of the present invention, the ratio is determined by the formula specificity of:<br>
{activity on sAAPF-pNAJ/[activity on bVGR-pNA]<br>
An enzyme having a ratio of less than about 10, more preferably less than about 5 and most preferably less than about 2.5 may then be considered to demonstrate trypsin-like activity.<br>
Such variants generally have at least one property which is different from the same property of the protease precursor from which the amino acid sequence of the variant is derived.<br>

Transition Metal Completes o£Macropo!yevclic Rigid Uganda - Compositions herein may also suitably include as bleach catalyst a transition metal complex of a macropolycyclic rigid ligand. The phrase "macropolycyclic rigid ligand" is sometimes abbreviated as "MRL" in discussion below. The amount used is a catalytically effective amount, suitably about 1 ppb or more, for example up to about 99.9%, more typically about 0.001 ppm or more, preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 500 ppm (wherein "ppb" denotes parts per billion by weight and "ppm" denotes parts per million by weight).<br>
Suitable transition metals e.g., Mti are illustrated hereinafter. "Macropolycyclic" means a MRL is both a macrocycle and is poJycyclic. "Polycyclic" means at least bicyclic. The term "rigid" as used herein herein includes "having a superstructure" and "cross-bridged". "Rigid" has been defined as the constrained converse of flexibility: see D.H, Busch., Chemical Reviews.. (1993V 22, 847-860, incorporated by reference. More particularly, "rigid" as used herein means that the MRL must be determinably more rigid than a macrocycle ("parent macrocycle") which is otherwise identical (having the same ring size and type and number of atoms in the main ring) but lacking a superstructure (especially linking moieties or, preferably cross-bridging moieties) found in the MRL's. In determining the comparative rigidity of macrocycles with and without superstructures, the practitioner will use the free form (not the metal-bound form) of the macrocycles. Rigidity is well-known to be useful in comparing macrocycles; suitable tools for determining, m&amp;suring or comparing rigidity include computational methods (see, for example, Zunrner, Chemical Reviews. (1995), 95(38), 2629-2648 or Hancock et al., Inorganic* Chimica Acta. (I9t»\. 164, 73-84.<br>
Preferred MRL's herein are a special type of ultra-rigid ligand which is cross-bridged. A "cross-bridge" is nonlimitingly illustrated in 1.11 hereinbelow. In 1,11, the<br>
1         8 cross-bridge is a -CH2CH2- moiety. It bridges N and N in the illustrative structure. By<br>
comparison, a "same-side" bridge, for example if one were to be introduced across N and N in 1.11, would not be sufficient to constitute a "cross-bridge" and accordingly would not be preferred.<br>
Suitable metals in the rigid ligand complexes include Mn(II), Mn(III), Mn(IV), Mn(V), Fe(II), Fe(III), Fe(IV), Co(I), Co(II), Co(IJI), Ni(I),Ni(H), Ni(III), Cu(l), Cu(II),<br>
Cu(III), Crfll), Cr(lII), Cr(IV), Cr(V), Cr(VI), V(III), V(IV), V(V), Mo(IV), Mo(V), Mo(VI), W(IV), W(V), W(VI), Pd(II), Ru(II), Ru(III), and Ru(lV). Preferred transition-metals in the instant transition-metal bleach catalyst include manganese, iron and chromium.<br>
More generally, theMRL's (and the corresponding transition-metal catalysts) herein suitably comprise:<br>
(a)	at least one macrocycle main ring comprising four or more heteroatoms; and<br>
(b)	a covalently connected non-metal superstrucrure capable of increasing the rigidity of the<br>
macrocycle, preferably selected from<br>
(i) a bridging superstructure, such as a Unking moiety;<br>
(ii) a cross-bridging superstructure, such as a cross-bridging linking moiety; and<br>
(iii) combinations thereof.<br>
Hie term "superstructure" is used herein as defined in the literature by Busch et al., see, for example, articles by Busch in "Chemical Reviews".<br>
Preferred superstructures herein not only enhance the rigidity of the parent macrocycle, but also favor folding of the macrocycle so that it co-ordinates to a metal in a cleft. Suitable superstructures can be remarkably simple, for example a linking moiety such as any of those illustrated in Fig, 1 and Fig. 2 below, can be used.<br>
Fig. 1 wherein n is an integer, for example from 2 to 8, preferably less than 6, typically 2 to 4, or<br>
T<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Fig. 2<br>
wherein m and n are integers from about I to 8, more preferably from 1 to 3; Z is N or CH; and T is a compatible substituent, for example H, alkyl, trialkylammonium, halogen, nitro, sulfonate, or the like. The aromatic ring in 1.10 can be replaced by a saturated ring, in which the atom in Z connecting into the ring can contain N, 0, S or C.<br>
Suitable MRL's are further nonlimitingly illustrated by the following compound:<br>

The above-mentioned enzymes may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial, fungal and yeast origin. Origin can further be mesophilic or cxtremophilic (psychrophilic, psychrotrophic, thermophilic, barophilic, alkalophilic, acidophilic, halophilic, etc.). Purified or non-purified forms of these enzymes may be used. Nowadays, it is common practice to modify wild-type enzymes via protein / genetic engineering techniques in order to optimize their performance efficiency in the laundry detergent and/or fabric care compositions of the invention. For example, the variants may be designed such that the compatibility of the enzyme to commonly encountered ingredients of such compositions is increased. Alternatively, the variant may be designed such that the optimal pH, bleach or chelant stability, catalytic activity and the like, of the enzyme variant is tailored to suit the particular cleaning application.<br>
In particular, attention should be focused on amino acids sensitive to oxidation in the case of bleach stability and on surface charges for the surfactant compatibility. The isoelectric point of such enzymes may be modified by the substitution of some charged amino acids, e.g. an increase in isodeciric point may help to improve compatibility with anionic surfactants. The stability of the enzymes may be further enhanced by the creation of e.g. additional salt bridges and enforcing calcium binding sites to increase chelant stability.<br>
These optional detersive enzymes, when present, are normally incorporated in the cleaning composition at levels from 0.0001% to 2% of pure enzyme by weight of the cleaning composition. The enzymes can be added as separate single ingredients (prills, granulates, stabilized liquids, etc... containing one enzyme ) or as mixtures of two or more enzymes ( e.g. cogranulates).<br>
Other suitable detergent ingredients that can be added are enzyme oxidation scavengers. Examples of such enzyme oxidation scavengers are ethoxylated tetraechylene polyamines.<br>

also be useful such as for example magnesium silicate, which can serve as a. crispening agent in granular formulations, as a stabilizing agent for oxygen bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
The crystalline layered sodium silicate material is preferably present in granular detergent compositions as a paniculate in intimate admixture with a solid, water-soluble ionizable material. The solid, water-soluble ionizable material is preferably selected from organic acids, organic and inorganic acid salts and mixtures thereof.<br>
Aluminosilicate builders are of great importance in most currently marketed heavy duty granular detergent compositions, and can also be a significant builder ingredient in liquid detergent formulations. Aluminosilicate builders have the empirical formula:<br>

Dve transfer inhibition - The detergent compositions of the present invention can also include compounds for inhibiting dye transfer from one fabric to another of solubilized and suspended dyes encountered during fabric laundering and conditioning operations involving colored fabrics. Polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents<br>
The detergent compositions accordingio the present invention can also comprise from 0.001% to 10 % preferably from 0,01% to 2%, more preferably from 0.05% to 1% by weight of polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents. Said polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents are normally incorporated into detergent compositions in order to inhibit the transfer of dyes from colored fabrics onto fabrics washed therewith. These polymers have the ability to complex or adsorb the fugitive dyes washed out of dyed fabrics before the dyes have the opportunity to become attached to other articles in (he wash.<br>
Especially suitable polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents are polyamine N-oxide polymers, copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole, polyvinylpyrrolidone polymers, polyvinyloxazolidones and polyvinylimidwoles or mixtures thereof. Examples of such dye transfer inhibiting agents are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,707,950 and 5,707,951.<br>
Additional suitable dye transfer inhibiting agents include, but are not limited to, cross-linked polymers, Cross-linked polymers are polymers whose backbone are   , interconnected to a certain degree; these links can be of chemical or physical nature, possibly with active groups n the backbone or on branches; cross-linked polymers have been described in the Journal of Polymer Science, volume 22, pages 1035-1039.<br>
In one embodiment, the cross-linked polymers are made in such a way that they form a three-dimensional rigid structure, which can entrap dyes in the pores formed by the three-dimensional structure. In another embodiment, the cross-linked polymers entrap the dye* by swelling. Such cross-linked polymers are described in the co-pending European patent application 94870213.9.<br>
Addition of such polymers also enhances the performance of the enzymes according the invention.<br>
pH and Buffering Variation -    Many of the detergent and bleaching compositions described herein will'be buffered, i.e., they are relatively resistant to pH drop in the presence of acidic soils. However, other compositions herein may have exceptionally low buffering capacity, or may be substantially unbuffered. Techniques for controlling or varying pH at recommended usage levels more generally include the use of not only<br>
buffers, but also additional alkalis, acids, pH-jump systems, dual compartment containers, etc., and are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The preferred ADD compositions herein comprise a pH-adjusting component selected from water-soluble alkaline inorganic salts and water-soluble organic or inorganic builders as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,705,464 and 5,710,115. Material Care Agents - The preferred ADD compositions may contain one or more material care agents which are effective as corrosion inhibitors and/or anti-tarnish aids as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,705,464, 5,710,115 and 5,646,101.<br>
When present, such protecting materials are preferably incorporated at low levels, e.g., from about 0.01% to about 5% of the ADD composition. Other Materials - Detersive ingredients or adjuncts optionally included in the instant compositions can include one or more materials for assisting or enhancing cleaning performance, treatment of the substrate to be cleaned, or designed to improve the aesthetics of the compositions. Adjuncts which can also be included in compositions of the present invention, at their conventional art-established levels for use (generally, adjunct materials comprise, in total, from about 30% to about 99.9%, preferably from about 70% to about 95%, by weight of the compositions), include other active ingredients such as non-phosphate builders, color speckles, silvercare, anti-tarnish and/or anti-corrosion agents, dyes, fillers, germicides, alkalinity sources, hydrotropes, anti-oxidants, perfumes, solubilizing agents, carriers, processing aids, pigments, and pH control agents as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,705,464, 5,710,115, 5,698,504, 5,695,679, 5,686,014 and 5,646,101. Methods of Cleaning - In addition to the methods for cleaning fabrics, dishes and other hard surfaces, and body parts by personal cleansing, described herein, the invention herein also encompasses a laundering pretreatment process for fabrics which have been soiled or stained comprising directly contacting said stains and/or soils with a highly concentrated form of the bleaching composition set forth above prior to washing such fabrics using<br>
conventional aqueous washing solutions. Preferably, the bleaching composition remains in<br>
,»» contact with the soil/stain for a period of from about 30 seconds to 24 hours prior to<br>
washing the pretreated soiled/stained substrate in conventional manner. More preferably, pretreatment times will range from about 1 to ISO minutes.<br>
The following examples are meant to exemplify compositions of the present invention, but are not necessarily meant to limit or otherwise define the scope of the invention.<br>
In all of the following examples Protease1 means a protease variant comprising substitution of amino acid residues with another naturally occurring ammo acid residue at positions corresponding to positions 101G/103A/104I/159D/232V/236H/245R/248D/252K of Bacillus amyhliquefaciens subtilisin. Protease1 can be substituted with any other<br>
additional protease variant of Che present invention, with substantially similar results in the following examples.<br>
In the cleaning composition examples of the present invention, the Protease' enzyme levels are expressed by pure enzyme by weight of the total composition, the other enzyme levels are expressed by raw material by weight of the total composition, and unless otherwise specified, the other ingredients are expressed by weight of the total composition. Further, in the following examples some abbreviations known to those of ordinary skill in the art are used, consistent with the disclosure set forth herein. Cleaning Compositions for Hard Surfaces, pishfts and Fabrics Examples 1,         Hard surface cleaning compn«jjtions<br>
As used herein "hard surface cleaning composition" refers to liquid and granular detergent compositions for cleaning hard surfaces such as floors, walls, bathroom tile, and the like.  Hard surface cleaning compositions of the present invention comprise an effective amount of one or more protease enzymes, preferably from about 0.0001% to about 10%, more preferably from about 0.001% to about 5%, more preferably still from about 0.001% to about 1% by weight of active protease enzyme of the composition. In addition to comprising one or more protease enzymes, such hard surface cleaning compositions typically comprise a surfactant and a water-soluble sequestering builder. In certain specialized products such as spray window cleaners, however, the surfactants are sometimes not used since they may produce a filmy/streaky residue on the glass surface. (See U.S. Patent No. 5,679,630 Examples).<br>
The surfactant component, when present, may comprise as little as 0.1% of the compositions herein, but,typically the compositions will contain from about 0.25% to about 10%, more preferably from about 1% to about 5% of surfactant.<br>
Typically the compositions will contain from about 0.5% to about 50% of a detergency builder, preferably from about 1% to about 10%. Preferably the pH should be iD$he range of about S to 12.  Conventional pH adjustment agents such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or hydrochloric acid can be used if adjustment is necessary.<br>
Solvents may be included in the compositions. Useful solvents include, but are not limited to, glycol ethers such as diethyleneglycol monohexyl ether, diethyleneglycol monobutyl ether, ethyleneglycol monobutyl ether, ethylcneglycol monohexyl ether, propyleneglycol monobutyl ether, dipropyleneglycol monobutyl ether, and diols such as 2,2,4-trimethyH,3-pentanediol and 2-ethyl-l,3-hexanediol. When used, such solvents are typically present at levels of from about 0.5% to about 15%, preferably from about 3% to about 11%.<br>
Additionally, highly volatile solvents such as isopropanol or ethanol can be used in the present compositions to facilitate faster evaporation of the composition from surfaces<br>
