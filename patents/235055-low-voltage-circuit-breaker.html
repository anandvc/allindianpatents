	Description<br>
	Low voltage circuit breaker<br>
	The invention relates to a low voltage circuit breaker which<br>
	comprises a contact system for a principal current and an arc<br>
5	extinction chamber. An arc transmitting element is disposed<br>
	between the contact system for the principal current and the<br>
	arc extinction chamber.<br>
	It is known that the size, particularly the width of contact<br>
	systems for the principal current of low voltage circuit<br>
10	breakers depends on a nominal current for which the low volt-<br>
	age circuit breakers have been designed. The higher this nomi-<br>
	nal current, the wider is the embodiment of the corresponding<br>
	contact systems for a principal current. A disadvantage here<br>
	is the fact that on the basis of strongly defined proximity<br>
15	effects for wider contact systems for a principal current, a<br>
	complicated arc extinction behavior is exhibited because the<br>
	arc predominantly occurs at the edge of the wide contact sys-<br>
	tems for a principal current and accordingly predominantly<br>
	dwells in the edge zone of the arc extinction chamber allo-<br>
20	cated to the contact systems for a principal current. As a re-<br>
	sult, the cooling effect of the arc extinction chamber is only<br>
	used in a limited manner. This leads to the fact that the arc<br>
	is extinguished relatively late and the danger arises that<br>
	ionized circuits may escape from the arc extinction chamber.<br>
25	This burning off or down of the arcs in the edge zone occurs<br>
	both during interruptions in the nominal current zone and dur-<br>
	ing short-circuit interruptions of this low voltage circuit<br>
	breaker.<br>
	In order to make possible an explicit transmission of arcs<br>
30	into arc extinction chambers, it is known from DE 35 39 673 A1<br>
	that an arc-conductive piece of a ferromagnetic material must<br>
	be allocated Lo a contact system for a principal current by<br><br><br>
	2002P13631WCUS	PCT/DE03/02883<br>
2<br>
	means of which the arcs are to be explicitly transmitted to<br>
	the arc extinction chamber. The disadvantage of this arrange-<br>
	ment is the fact that additional components must be provided<br>
	which are directly connected to the contact systems for a<br>
5	principal current. This complicates the structure of the low<br>
	voltage power switch and low manufacturing and/or assembly<br>
	tolerances already lead to a failure when the arcs are con-<br>
	ducted away.<br>
	Therefore, it is the object of the invention to create a low<br>
10	voltage circuit breaker according to said type in the case of<br>
	which arcs defined in an arc extinction chamber can be trans-<br>
	mitted in a simple manner.<br>
	According to the invention, this object of the invention is<br>
	achieved by means of a low voltage circuit breaker with the<br>
15	features mentioned in Claim 1. Because said arc transmitting<br>
	element disposed between the contact system for a principal<br>
	current and the arc extinction chamber comprises at least one<br>
	arc conductive element which makes it possible to direct said<br>
	arc in a defined manner to the arc extinction chamber, it is<br>
20	advantageously achieved that the arc is directed away from the<br>
	contact systems for a principal current to be protected<br>
	against burning down, and that a shorter arc extinction period<br>
	is reached. This results in decreasing the stress on both the<br>
	contact systems for a principal current, on the one hand, and<br>
25	the arc extinction chamber, an the other hand, because these<br>
	basically can now, by means of a defined start-up by the arc,<br>
	convert their arc extinction capacity with a high degree of<br>
	effectiveness. It has been proven that by providing simple arc<br>
	conductive elements to the arc transmitting element, it is<br>
30	possible to direct the area in a defined manner. Changes to<br>
	the contact system for the principal current itself need not<br>
	be made so that the modifications according to the invention<br>
	ate only limited to the arc transmitting element alone. As a<br><br><br>
	2002P13631WCUS	PCT/DE03/02883<br>
3<br>
	result, the solution according to the invention is very simple<br>
	and can therefore also be implemented cost-effectively in<br>
	mass-produced low voltage circuit breakers.<br>
	In a preferred embodiment of the invention provision is made<br>
5	so that at least one arc conductive element extends at an an-<br>
	gle to an imagined vertical line of the arc transmitting ele-<br>
	ment away from an edge zone in the direction of a middle zone.<br>
	- This advantageously results in the fact that the arc is di-<br>
	rected via at least one arc conductive element approximately<br>
10	into the middle of the arc extinction chamber so that the de-<br>
	sired arc extinction effect can be very securely achieved.<br>
	In a further preferred embodiment of the invention provision<br>
	is made so that the arc conductive element has at least one<br>
	running edge basically running parallel to the arc transmit-<br>
15	ting element. - As a result of this an optimum arc position<br>
	can be controlled within the arc extinction chamber in a de-<br>
	fined manner. - The running edge can be formed by a sharp-<br>
	edged transition of a step.<br>
	In addition, in a preferred embodiment of the invention provi-<br>
20	sion is made so that the arc conductive element particularly<br>
	has several running edges running at different angles to the<br>
	imagined vertical line. - By means of such a ray-shaped system,<br>
	of the running edges on the arc transmitting element, the arc<br>
	is directed safely into the middle zone of the arc extinction<br>
25	chamber independent of the point of origin of the arc.<br>
	In a further preferred embodiment of the invention provision<br>
	is made so that the arc conductive element is non-positively<br>
	connected to the arc transmitting element. As a result of<br>
	this, the arc conductive element can be embodied in a simple<br>
30	fashion. This only requires the manufacturing of an arc con-<br>
	ductive element with a simple design - for example, as a<br>
	crown-shaped stamped part - and the fixing of this arc conduc-<br><br><br>
	2002P13631WCUS	PCT/DE03/02883<br>
4<br>
	tive element to the arc transmitting element - for example, by<br>
	means of welding. In the case of a correspondingly selected<br>
	system of pronged rays of the crown-shaped stamped part, the<br>
	running edges can be determined for the arc in a simple way.<br>
5	In this way, particularly the different sizes of the arc ex-<br>
	tinction chambers can be adapted easily. The rays preferably<br>
	have two running edges for the arcs running at right angles to<br>
	one another which run front the edge zone of the arc transmit-<br>
	ting element into the middle of the arc extinction chamber. As<br>
10	a result of this, depending on the point of origin and the in-<br>
	tensity, it is possible to direct said adapted arc to the arc<br>
	extinction chamber.<br>
	The arc conductive element connected non-positively to the arc<br>
	transmitting element in addition offers the advantage that a<br>
15	bigger cooling body is available in the zone of the arc trans-<br>
	mitting element which favorably influencs the extinction be-<br>
	havior of the arc extinction chamber.<br>
	At least one section of a wire, particularly a steel wire can<br>
	also serve as an arc conductive element.<br>
20	According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
	provision can be made for at least one arc conductive element<br>
	being embodied as a profile part stamped from the plane of the<br>
	arc transmitting element. This simplifies manufacturing of an<br>
	arc transmitting element that features arc conductive ele-<br>
25	ments.<br>
	At least one end place of a stack of extinction sheets can be<br>
	used advantageously as an arc transmitting element.<br>
	Further preferred embodiments of the invention can be found in<br>
	the other features mentioned in the subclaims.<br>
30	Other advantageous further developments of the invention are<br><br>

	explained below on the basis of the accompanying drawings.<br>

	Figure 5 schematic perspective view of an arc transmitting<br>
10		element.<br>
		Figure 1 shows pare of a sectional view of an arc extinction<br>
	chamber 10 of a low voltage circuit breaker 12. The low volt-<br>
	age circuit breaker 12 is embodied for a relatively high nomi-<br>
	nal current, for example, 1000 A.<br>
15	A contact system for a principal current 14 of the low voltage<br>
	circuit breaker 12 comprises a fixed principal contact 16 with<br>
	a contact facing 18 as well as a movable principal contact 20<br>
	with a contact facing 22. If required, these principal con-<br>
	tacts 16 and 20 are provided repeatedly in a parallel system.<br>
20	The higher the nominal current, the wider is — according to<br>
	the view into the paper plane - the embodiment of the contact<br>
	system for a principal current.<br>
	The principal contacts 16 and 20 are used for the arc-free<br>
	transmission of the permanent current of the low voltage cir-<br>
25	cuit breaker 12 in the closed state of the principal contacts<br>
	15 and 20.<br>
	The contact system for a principal current 14 also comprises a<br>
	fixed blow-out contact 24 with a contact facing 26 and a mov-<br>
	able blow-our contact 28 with a contact facing 30. Arc horns<br><br><br>
	2002P13631WCUS	PCT/DE03/02883<br>
	32 or 34 are allocated to the blow-out contacts 24 and 28.<br>
	An insulating coupling 36 serves for connection to a driving<br>
	arrangement and reset device (not shown) in order to open and<br>
	close the contact system for a principal current 14.<br>
5	The arc extinction chamber 10 comprises a housing 38 which en-<br>
	closes an inner space 40 serving an arc extinction. In the in-<br>
	ner space 40, a stack of extinction sheets 41 consisting of<br>
	extinction sheets 42, 43 is arranged in a known way. An arc<br>
	transmitting element 44 limits the inner space 40 of its fixed<br>
10	contact side. In principle, the arc transmitting element 44 is<br>
	embodied plate-shaped and carries on its side facing the inner<br>
	space 40, an arc conductive element 46 whose structure will be<br>
	explained in greater detail below on the basis of the follow-<br>
	ing drawings. The arc gases (switching gases) formed in the<br>
15	course of the extinction process escape from the arc extinc-<br>
	tion chamber 10 through an outlet 50, provided on the top<br>
	side, subdivided into passages 48; said gases escaping in the<br>
	direction of the arrows 52. In addition, a further switching<br>
	gas damper can be arranged at the top side of the arc extinc-<br>
20	tion chamber 10.<br>
	The arc conductive element 46 is arranged in the vicinity of<br>
	the arc transfer points from the arc horn 32 to the arc trans-<br>
	mitting element 44.<br>
	Figure 2 shows a view from above of an arc transmitting ele-<br>
25	ment 44 which clearly shows the arrangement of the arc conduc-<br>
	tive element 46 on the arc transmitting element 44. The arc<br>
	conductive element 46 is arranged non-positively as an addi-<br>
	tional part on the surface of the arc transmitting element 44<br>
	and spot welded to it or joined using a similar method. Ac-<br>
30	cording to a further embodiment, the arc conductive element 46<br>
	can be stamped from the plane of the arc transmitting element<br>
44.<br><br>
	2002P13631WCUS	PCT/DE03/02883<br>
7<br>
	The arc conductive element 46 comprises running edges 54 which<br>
	form the side limit of ray-shaped prongs 56. In this case, the<br>
	running edges 54 run at different angles in each case to an<br>
	imagined vertical line 58 through the arc transmitting element<br>
5	44. In this case, the running edges 54 are embodied in such a<br>
	way that they run from a bottom edge zone in the direction of<br>
	the top middle zone of the arc transmitting element 44.<br>
	The sectional view in Figure 3, as well as the enlarged de-<br>
	tailed view in figure 4, show that the running edges 46 are<br>
10	formed by steps 60 running basically vertically to the plane<br>
	of the arc transmitting element 44 so that there is a sharp-<br>
	edged transition 62 on the surface of the arc conductive ele-<br>
	ments 46.<br>
	Figure 5 in a perspective view again shows the plastic procru-<br>
15	sion of the arc conductive element 46 on the arc transmitting<br>
	element 44 . This results in an embodiment of the running edges<br>
	54 as sharp-edged transitions 62 of the steps 60.<br>
	The number of arc conductive elements 46 as well as the number<br>
	of running edges 54 can be adapted to the design of the low<br>
20	voltage circuit breaker l2, particularly to the arc extinction<br>
	chamber 10.<br>
	The ray-shaped running edges 54 running from the edge zones of<br>
	the arc extinction chember 10 into the middle zone of the arc<br>
	extinction chamber 10 lead to the arcs originating in the edge<br>
25	zone at the contact system for a principal current 14 being<br>
	safely directed into the middle zone of the arc extinction<br>
	chamber 10 where these are extinguished particularly effec-<br>
	tively. Because of the system of an arc conductive element 46<br>
	in the transfer zone of the arc horn 32 on the arc transmit-<br>
30	ting element 44, the arcs can be directed particularly well<br>
	into the middle zone of the arc extinction chamber 10.<br><br>
	2002P13631WCUS	PCT/DE03/02883<br>
8<br>
	Each one of the two end plates 43 of the stack of extinction<br>
	sheets 41 can be used as an arc transmitting element and as a<br>
	result be provided with an arc conductive element.<br>
	According to further embodiments which are not shown, instead<br>
5	of the shown arc conductive element 46 which either has a<br>
	crown-shaped or neck-shaped embodiment, provision can also be<br>
	made for the running edges 54 being formed from welded-on in-<br>
	dividual elements, for example, steel wire or the like. How-<br>
	ever, the system of a relatively large additional part which<br>
10	embodies a plurality of running edges 54, at the same time,<br>
	leads to an embodiment of an additional mass which has a cool-<br>
	ing effect on the arcs at a very early point in time for the<br>
	switching-off process of the low voltage circuit breaker 12 so<br>
	that a further improvement of the extinction behavior is<br>
15	achieved.<br><br>
