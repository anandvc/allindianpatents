The groups of the form Ca(OR32)xH2a+i-x described under G may be either straight-chain or branched. This results in polyhydroxylated alkyi chains, as derived, for example, from monosaccharide building blocks, which are bonded to the phenyl radical via a linker unit L. Correspondingly, the formula Cb(OR32)yH2b-i-y preferably describes polyhydroxylated, cyclic alkyl substituents. Exchange of a CH2 unit for O results, for example, in the class of the pyranoside orfuranoside carbohydrate building blocks, as realized in example 9. G may equally derive from the group of the amino acids, which are bonded via the amino acid amino or amino acid carboxyl function, in which case the amino or carbonyl function is included in the linker unit L. The amino acid side chains then occur in R38.<br>
When the compounds of the formula I contain one or more centers of asymmetry, these may each independently have either the S or R configuration. The compounds may be present as optical isomers, as enantiomers, as diastereomers, as racemates or as mixtures in any ratios thereof.<br>
The present invention includes all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I.<br>
Alkyl radicals may be straight-chain or branched. This also holds when they bear substituents or occur as substituents of other radicals, for example in fluoroalkyl radicals or alkoxy radicals. Examples of alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl (= 1-methylethyl), n-butyl, isobutyl (= 2-methylpropyl), sec-butyl (= 1-methylpropyl), tert-butyl (= 1,1-dimethylethyl), n-pentyl, isopentyl, tert-pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl. Preferred alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl. In the alkyl radicals, one or more, for example 1, 2, 3,4,-5,6,7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 or 17, hydrogen atoms may be substituted by fluorine atoms. Examples of such fluoroalkyl radicals are trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, pentafluoroethyl, heptafluoroisopropyl. Substituted alkyl radicals may be substituted in any desired positions, for example by hydroxy!. In the alkyl radicals, one or more CH2 groups may be replaced by O, NH or N-alkyl.<br><br>
Alkenyl radicals may be straight-chain or branched. This also holds when they bear substituents, for example in fluoroalkenyl radicals. The alkenyl radicals may be unsaturated in different positions. Examples of alkenyl radicals are propenyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl or heptenyl. In alkenyl radicals, one or more, for example 1, 2, 3, 4,<br>
5,	6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or 13, hydrogen atoms may be substituted by fluorine atoms.<br>
Substituted alkenyl radicals may be substituted in any desired positions, for example<br>
by hydroxyl. In the alkenyl radicals, one or more CH2 groups may be replaced by O,<br>
NH or N-alkyl.<br>
Acyl radicals may be straight-chain or branched. This is also true when they bear substituents. Examples of acyl radicals are formyl, acetyl, propionyl or butyryl. In acyl radicals, one or more, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7, hydrogen atoms may be substituted by fluorine atoms.<br>
Examples of cycloalkyl radicals are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl. In cycloalkyl radicals, one or more, for example 1,2,3, 4, 5,<br>
6,	7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or 13, hydrogen atoms may be substituted by fluorine atoms.<br>
Substituted cycloalkyl radicals may be substituted in any desired positions, for example<br>
by hydroxyl. The cycloalkyl radicals may also be in branched form as alkylcycloalkyl or<br>
cycloalkylalkyl, for example methylcyclohexyl or cyclohexylmethyl. In the cycloalkyl<br>
radicals, one or more CH2 groups may be replaced by O, NH or N-alkyl.<br>
Phenyl radicals may be unsubstituted or singly or multiply, for example singly, doubly or triply, substituted by identical or different radicals. When a phenyl radical is substituted, it preferably bears one or two identical or different substituents. This applies equally to substituted phenyl radicals in groups such as phenylalkyl, phenylcarbonyl, etc. Phenylalkyl radicals are, for example, benzyl, 1-phenylethyl or 2-phenylethyl. In monosubstituted phenyl radicals, the substituent may be in the 2-position, the 3-position or the 4-position. Disubstituted phenyl may be substituted in the 2,3-position, 2,4-position, 2,5-position, 2,6-position, 3,4-position or 3,5-position. In trisubstituted phenyl radicals, the substituents may be in the 2,3,4-position, 2,3,5-position, 2,4,5-position, 2,4,6-position, 2,3,6-position or 3,4,5-position.<br><br>
Heteroaryl radicals are aromatic ring compounds in which one or more ring atoms are oxygen atoms, sulfur atoms or nitrogen atoms, for example 1, 2, 3 or 4 nitrogen atoms, 1 or 2 oxygen atoms, 1 or 2 sulfur atoms or are combinations of different heteroatoms. The heteroaryl radicals may be bonded via all positions, for example via the 1-position, 2-position, 3-position, 4-position, 5-position, 6-position, 7-position or 8-position. Heteroaryl radicals may be unsubstituted or singly or multiply, for example singly, doubly or triply, substituted by identical or different radicals. Heteroaryls are, for example, 2- or 3-thienyl, 2- or 3-furyl, 1-, 2- or 3-pyrroIyl, 1-, 2-, 4- or 5-imidazolyl, 1-, 3-, 4- or 5-pyrazolyl, 1,2, 3-triazol-1-, -4- or-5-yl, 1,2,4-triazol-1-, -3- or-5-yl, 1-or5-tetrazolyl, 2-, 4- or 5-oxazolyl, 3-, 4- or 5-isoxazolyl, 1,2,3-oxadiazol-4- or -5-yl, 1,2,4-oxadiazol-3- or -5-yl, 1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl or -5-yl, 2-, 4- or 5-thiazolyl, 3-, 4- or 5-isothiazolyl, 1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-or-5-yl, 1,2,4-thiadiazol-3-or-5-yl, 1,2,3-thiadiazol-4-or -5-yl, 2-, 3- or 4-pyridyl, 2-, 4-, 5- or 6-pyrimidinyl, 3- or 4-pyridazinyI, pyrazinyl, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-indolyl, 1-, 2-, 4- or 5-benzimidazolyl, 1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-indazolyl, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinolyl, 1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-isoquinolyl, 2-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinazolinyl, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-cinnolinyl, 2-, 3-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinoxalinyl, 1-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-phthalazinyl. Also included are the corresponding N-oxides of these compounds, i.e., for example, 1-oxy-2-, 3- or 4-pyridyl. Preference is given to the 5- or 6-membered heterocycles, for example imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyrrolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, thiazolyl and oxazolyl and pyridyl.<br>
Also included as CH2 units are the CH3 groups which terminate an alkyl chain, which are interpreted in this context as CH2-H groups.<br>
Also described are methods for preparing the compounds of the formula I.<br>
The compounds of the formula I described here can be prepared starting from the benzylamine precursors IV. If not commercially obtainable, these can in turn be synthesized by standard methods known to those skilled in the art from the corresponding benzyl chlorides or bromides III and the corresponding amine.<br><br><br>
The benzylamines IV obtained in this way are alkylated in a manner known to those skilled in the art with the appropriately substituted alpha-bromoacetophenone compounds V.<br><br>
The alpha-bromoacetophenone compounds V can be obtained in literature methods from the corresponding acetophenone precursors by bromination.<br>
By reduction of the carbonyl groups in VI and subsequent acid-catalyzed cyclization of the resulting alcohols VII (cf. Tetrahedron Lett.; 1989,30, 5837; Org. Prep. Proced. Int.; 1995, 27, 513) the desired tetrahydroisoquinolines I can be obtained by known methods.<br><br><br>
When R6 is not H, the desired compounds of the formula I can be prepared, for example, from the iodides VIII (cf. Chem. Pharm. Bull.; 1994, 42, 67) by halogen-metal exchange and subsequent nucleophilic attack of the intermediate organolithium species on the carbonyl group (cf. Chem. Pharm. Bull.; 1995, 43, 1543).<br><br>
The tertiary alcohols IX synthesized in this way can be converted by known methods to further derivatives, for example the ethers or esters derived therefrom.<br><br>
To prepare alkyl-branched analogs (I), the appropriate diphenylacetic esters X can be alkylated in the alpha-position with R6 by known methods. The desired products XI can be converted by standard methods to the corresponding amides XII which are converted to the desired tetrahydroisoquinolines I in a Pictet-Spengler-like reaction (cf. Tetrahedron; 1987, 43, 439; Chem. Pharm. Bull.; 1985, 33, 340).<br><br>
The bonding of the L-G substituents to the R7, R8 or R9 positions may, for example, be via an amide bond. In this case, the above-described synthetic routes ensure that at<br>
least one of the R7, R8 or R9 radicals is present as an NH2 or COOH group. A polar<br>
radical can be bonded in a manner known to those skilled in the art by coupling polar carboxylic acids (for example gluconic acid which has to be appropriately protected) to<br>
the NH2 compound XIII or by coupling polar amines (for example glucamine) to the<br><br>
corresponding -COOH compound XIV, resulting in the carboxanilides la or the carboxamides lb.<br><br>
In the compounds of the formulae II to XIV, the R1 to R9 radicals are each as defined above or they are functional groups in protected form or in precursor stages.<br>
The urea or else thiourea compounds derived from the precursor molecules XIII can likewise be prepared therefrom in a manner known to those skilled in the art.<br>
It has been possible to show that compounds of the formula I constitute outstanding inhibitors of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE), especially of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger of the subtype 3 (NHE3).<br>
Tetrahydroisoquinolines as inhibitors of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger of the subtype 3 (NHE3) have already been described in the patent application WO03048129. The patent application WO03055880 describes the related compound<br><br>
class of the tetrahydroisoquinolinium salts as NHE3 inhibitors. However, the properties of these compounds are not yet satisfactory in various respects, and there is still a need for compounds having a more favorable pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic property profile, and suitable for treating highly differing disorders.<br>
The NHE3 is found in the body of various species, preferably in the gallbladder, the intestines and in the kidneys (Larry Fliegel et al., Biochem. Cell. Biol. 76: 735-741, 1998), but could also be found in the brain (E. Ma et al., Neuroscience 79: 591-603).<br>
As a consequence of their unexpected NHE-inhibitory properties, the compounds of the formula I are suitable for preventing and treating disorders which are caused by activation and/or by an activated NHE. The use of the inventive compounds relates to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic disorders in veterinary medicine and human medicine.<br>
Thus, the inventive inhibitors of NHE are suitable for treating disorders which are caused by ischemia and/or by reperfusion.<br>
As a consequence of their pharmacological properties, the compounds described here are outstandingly suitable as antiarrhythmic medicaments having a cardioprotective component for prophylaxis of infarction and for treatment of infarction, and also for treatment of angina pectoris, in which case they also inhibit or greatly reduce, in a preventative manner, the pathophysiological events in the development of ischemia-induced damage, in particular in the induction of ischemia-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Owing to their protective effects against pathological hypoxic and ischemic situations, the compounds of the formula I used in accordance with the invention can, as a consequence of inhibition of the cellular Na+/H+ exchange mechanism, be used as a medicament for treating all acute or chronic damage induced by ischemia or disorders induced primarily or secondarily thereby. This relates to the use thereof as medicaments for surgical interventions, for example in organ transplants, in which case the compounds can be used both for the protection of the organs in the donor and during the removal, to protect removed organs, for example in<br><br>
the course of treatment with or storage thereof in physiological bath fluids, and also in the course of transfer into the recipient organism. The compounds are likewise valuable medicaments having a protective action when carrying out angioplastic surgical interventions, for example on the heart or else on peripheral vessels.<br>
In accordance with their protective action against ischemia-induced damage, the compounds are also suitable as medicaments for treating ischemias of the nervous system, especially of the CNS, in which case they are suitable, for example, for treating stroke or cerebral edema.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the formula I used in accordance with the invention are likewise suitable for treating forms of shock, for example allergic, cardiogenic, hypovolemic and bacterial shock.<br>
In addition, the compounds induce an improvement in the respiratory drive and are therefore used for treating respiratory conditions in the event of the following clinical conditions and disorders: disrupted central respiratory drive (for example central sleep apneas, sudden infant death, postoperative hypoxia), muscle-related respiratory disorders, breathing disorders after long-term ventilation, breathing disorders in the course of adaptation in high mountains, obstructive and mixed form of sleep apneas, acute and chronic pulmonary disorders with hypoxia and hypercapnia.<br>
The compounds additionally increase the muscle tone of the upper airways, so that<br>
snoring is suppressed.<br>
The compounds mentioned are therefore advantageously used to prepare a<br>
medicament for the prevention and treatment of sleep apneas and muscle-related<br>
respiratory disorders and to prepare a medicament for the prevention and treatment of<br>
snoring.<br>
A combination of an NHE inhibitor with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (for example acetazolamide), in which case the latter brings about metabolic acidosis and thus itself increases respiratory activity, is found to be advantageous as a result of enhanced action and reduced use of active ingredient.<br><br>
In addition, the compounds described here are suitable as medicaments for therapy and prophylaxis of diseases and disorders which are induced by hyperexcitability of the central nervous system, in particular for treating diseases of the epileptic type, centrally induced clonic and tonic spasms, states of psychological depression, anxiety disorders and psychoses. The NHE inhibitors described here may be employed alone or in combination with other antiepileptic substances or antipsychotic active ingredients, or carbonate dehydratase inhibitors, for example with acetazolamide, and also with further inhibitors of NHE or of the sodium-dependent chloride-bicarbonate exchanger (NCBE).<br>
It has been found that the compounds used in accordance with the invention have a mild laxative effect and can accordingly be used advantageously as laxatives or in the event of risk of constipation.<br>
In addition, the inventive compounds can advantageously be used for the prevention and therapy of acute and chronic disorders of the intestinal tract which are induced by ischemic states in the intestinal region and/or by subsequent reperfusion. Such complications may be caused, for example, by inadequate bowel peristalsis as frequently observed, for example, after surgical interventions, in the event of constipation or greatly reduced bowel activity.<br>
There is also the possibility of preventing gallstone formation.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the formula I used in accordance with the invention feature strong inhibiting action on the proliferation of cells, for example on fibroblast cell proliferation and the proliferation of smooth vascular muscle cells. The compounds of the formula I are therefore useful as valuable therapeutic agents for disorders in which cell proliferation constitutes a primary or secondary cause, and can therefore be used as antiatherosclerotic agents, agents against diabetic late complications, agents against chronic kidney failure, cancers, fibrotic disorders of the heart and also as pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, or renal fibrosis, organ hypertrophies and<br><br>
hyperplasias, for example of the heart and the prostate, and thus for the prevention and treatment of congestive heart failure or in the event of prostate hyperplasia or prostate hypertrophy.<br>
The inventive compounds are effective inhibitors of the cellular sodium-proton antiporter (Na/H exchanger) which is elevated in numerous disorders (essential hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, etc.), also in those cells which are readily amenable to measurements, for example in erythrocytes, thrombocytes or leucocytes. The compounds used in accordance with the invention are therefore suitable as outstanding and simple scientific tools, for example in their use as diagnostic agents for determining and differentiating different forms of hypertension, but also of atherosclerosis, diabetes and diabetic late complications, proliferative disorders, etc.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the formula I are suitable for preventive therapy for preventing development of, and treating, high blood pressure, for example of essential hypertension, since they reduce or fully inhibit the reabsorption of NaCI in the tubular system of the kidneys. Accordingly, they are also outstandingly suitable as combination and formulation partners for medicaments which are used to treat high blood pressure. For example, they may be combined with diuretics having thiazide-like action, loop diuretics, aldosterone and pseudoaldosterone antagonists such as hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide, polythiazide, furosemide, piretanide, torasemide, bumetanide, amiloride, triamterene. In addition, the NHE inhibitors of the present invention may be used in combination with ACE inhibitors, for example ramipril, enalapril or captopril.<br>
Further favorable combination partners are also p-blockers. The NHE inhibitors described may likewise be used in the prevention of, and for treating, thrombotic disorders, since, as NHE inhibitors, they can both inhibit platelet aggregation itself and additionally inhibit or prevent the excessive release of coagulation mediators, in particular of von Willebrand's factor. The NHE inhibitors of the present invention can therefore be combined with further anticoagulant active ingredients, for example acetylsalicylic acid, thrombin antagonists, factor Xa<br><br>
antagonists, medicaments having fibrinolytic action, factor Vila antagonists, etc. Combined application of the present NHE inhibitors with NCBE inhibitors is particularly beneficial.<br>
It has also been found that NHE inhibitors exhibit a beneficial influence on serum lipoproteins. It is generally acknowledged that excessively high blood lipid levels, known as hyperlipoproteinemias, constitute a significant risk factor for the development of arteriosclerotic vascular lesions, especially of coronary heart disease. The reduction in elevated serum lipoproteins is therefore exceptionally important for the prophylaxis and the regression of atherosclerotic lesions. The compounds used in accordance with the invention can therefore be used for prophylaxis and for regression of atherosclerotic lesions by eliminating a causal risk factor. The inventive inhibitors of NHE can also advantageously be combined with other antiarteriosclerotic active ingredients, such as a substance from the class of the fibrates, an upregulator of LD2 receptor activity, such as MD-700 and LY295427, or a cholesterol or bile acid resorption inhibitor or an antihypercholesterolemic from the class of the statins, such as, for example, pravastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin. This protection of the vessels against the syndrome of endothelial dysfunction makes compounds of the formula I viable medicaments for preventing and for treating coronary vasospasms, peripheral vascular disorders, such as claudicatio intermittens, atherogenesis and atherosclerosis, left-ventricular hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy, and thrombotic disorders.<br>
The compounds mentioned may likewise be used for treating diseases which are caused by protozoa and are especially suitable as antimalarials. In addition, the compounds are suitable for controlling sucking parasites such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas and plant pests.<br>
In accordance with their protective actions, the compounds are also suitable as medicaments for maintaining health and prolonging life.<br><br>
Generally, the NHE inhibitors described here may advantageously be combined with other compounds which regulate the intracellular pH, and useful combination partners are inhibitors of the enzyme group of carbonate dehydratase, inhibitors of bicarbonate ion-transporting systems such as the sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter or the sodium-dependent chloride-bicarbonate exchanger, and also other NHE inhibitors, for example having inhibitory action on other NHE subtypes, because they may strengthen the pharmacologically relevant pH-regulating effects of the NHE inhibitors described here.<br>
The compounds mentioned therefore advantageously find use for preparing a medicament for preventing and treating sleep apneas and muscle-related respiratory disorders; for preparing a medicament for preventing and treating snoring; for preparing a medicament for blood pressure reduction; for preparing a medicament having a laxative effect for preventing and treating intestinal blockages; for preparing a medicament for preventing and treating disorders which are induced by ischemia and reperfusion of central and peripheral organs such as acute renal failure, stroke, endogenous states of shock, intestinal disorders, etc.; for preparing a medicament for treating diabetic late damage and chronic renal disorders, in particular all renal inflammations (nephritides) which are associated with increased protein/albumin excretion; for preparing a medicament for treating hypercholesterinemia; for preparing a medicament for preventing atherogenesis and atherosclerosis; for preparing a medicament for preventing and treating disorders which are induced by elevated cholesterol levels; for preparing a medicament for preventing and treating disorders which are induced by endothelial dysfunction; for preparing a medicament for treating infection by ectoparasites; for preparing a medicament for treating the diseases mentioned in combinations with blood pressure-reducing substances, preferably with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, with diuretics, aldosterone antagonists or angiotensin receptor antagonists. It has been found that a combination of an NHE inhibitor of the formula I with a blood lipid level-reducing active ingredient, preferably with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (for example lovastatin or pravastatin), the latter bringing about hypolipidemic action and thus increasing the hypolipidemic properties of the NHE inhibitor of the formula I, is a beneficial combination having enhanced action and reduced use of active ingredient.<br><br>
The administration of sodium-proton exchange inhibitors of the formula I as novel medicaments for reducing elevated blood lipid level is claimed, as is the combination of sodium-proton exchange inhibitors with blood pressure-reducing and/or hypolipidemic medicaments.<br>
The invention also relates to curative compositions for human, veterinary or phytoprotective use, comprising an effective amount of a compound of the formula I and/or of a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof, as well as curative compositions for human, veterinary or phytoprotective use, comprising an effective amount of a compound of the formula I and/or of a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof alone or in combination with one or more other pharmacological active ingredients or medicaments.<br>
Medicaments which comprise a compound of the formula I or the pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof can be administered, for example, orally, parenterally, intramuscularly, intravenously, rectally, nasally, by inhalation, subcutaneously or by a suitable transcutaneous dosage form, the preferred administration depending on the particular characteristics of the disorder. The compounds of the formula I can be used alone or together with pharmaceutical excipients, in veterinary or in human medicine and in plant protection. The medicaments comprise active ingredients of the formula I and/or their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts in general in an amount of from 0.01 mg to 1 g per dose unit.<br>
The excipients which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulation are familiar to those skilled in the art on the basis of their expert knowledge. In addition to solvents, gel formers, suppository bases, tablet excipients and other active ingredient carriers, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavorings, preservatives, solubilizers or colorings.<br>
For an oral administration form, the active compounds are mixed with the additives suitable for this purpose, such as carriers, stabilizers or inert diluents and converted by<br><br>
customary methods to the suitable dosage forms, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. Examples of useful inert carriers include gum arabic, magnesia, magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate, lactose, glucose or starch, in particular corn starch. The preparation may be either in the form of dry granules or in the form of moist granules. Examples of useful oily carriers or useful solvents are vegetable or animal oils, such as sunflower oil or cod liver oil.<br>
For subcutaneous, percutaneous or intravenous administration, the active compounds used, if desired with the substances customary for this purpose such as solubilizers, emulsifiers or further excipients are converted to solution, suspension or emulsion. Examples of useful solvents are: water, physiological saline or alcohols, for example ethanol, propanol, glycerol and additionally also sugar solutions such as glucose or mannitol solutions, or else a mixture of the different solvents mentioned.<br>
Examples of suitable pharmaceutical formulations for administration in the form of aerosols or sprays are solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the active ingredient of the formula I in a pharmaceutical^ acceptable solvent, in particular ethanol or water, or a mixture of such solvents. If required, the formulation may also comprise other pharmaceutical excipients such as surfactants, emulsifiers and stabilizers, and also a propellant gas. Such a preparation typically contains the active ingredient in a concentration of from about 0.1 to 10% by weight, in particular from about 0.3 to 3% by weight.<br>
The dosage of the active ingredient of the formula I to be administered and the frequency of administration depend on the potency and duration of action of the compounds used; additionally also on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated, and also on the gender, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the mammal to be treated.<br>
On average, the daily dose of a compound of the formula I in the case of a patient weighing about 75 kg is at least 0.001 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 mg/kg, up to at most 30 mg/kg, preferably 1 mg/kg, of body weight. In the event of acute episodes of the<br><br>
disease, for instance immediately after suffering apnetic states in high mountains, even higher dosages may be necessary. Especially in the case of i.v. administration, for instance in a heart attack patient in the intensive care unit, up to 300 mg/kg per day may be necessary. The daily dose can be divided into one or more, for example up to 4, individual doses.<br>
When the compounds of the formula I contain one or more acidic or basic groups and/or one or more basic heterocycles, the corresponding physiologically or toxicologically acceptable salts are also included in the invention, in particular the salts which can be used pharmaceutically. For instance, the compounds of the formula I can be deprotonated at an acidic group and be used, for example, as alkali metal salts, preferably sodium or potassium salts, or as ammonium salts, for example as salts with ammonia or organic amines or amino acids. Compounds of the formula I which contain a basic group can also be used in the form of their physiologically acceptable acid addition salts with inorganic or organic acids, for example as hydrochlorides, phosphates, sulfates, methanesulfonates, acetates, lactates, maleates, fumarates, malates, gluconates, etc.<br>

Test description:<br>
This test determines the recovery of the intracellular pH (pHj) after acidification, and this recovery occurs in the case of functional NHE even under bicarbonate-free conditions. To this end, the pHj was determined using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye BCECF (Calbiochem, the BCECF-AM precursor was used). The cells were initially loaded with BCECF. The BCECF fluorescence was determined in a Ratio<br><br>
Fluorescence Spectrometer (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, N J., USA) at excitation wavelengths of 505 and 440 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm and converted to the pHj by means of calibration curves. The cells had already been incubated in NH4CI buffer (pH 7.4) in the course of the BCECF loading (NH4CI buffer: 115 mM NaCI, 20 mM NH4CI, 5 mM KCI, 1 mM CaCfc, 1 mM MgS04, 20 mM<br>
Hepes, 5 mM glucose, 1 mg/ml BSA; a pH of 7.4 was established using 1 M NaOH). The intracellular acidification was induced by adding 975 \i\ of an NH4CI-free buffer (see below) to 25 \i\ aliquots of the cells incubated in NH4CI buffer. The subsequent rate of the pH recovery was registered at 2 minutes for NHE1, at 5 minutes for NHE2 and at three minutes for NHE3. For the calculation of the inhibitory potency of the tested substances, the cells were initially investigated in buffers in which complete or absolutely no pH recovery took place. For complete pH recovery (100%), the cells were incubated in Na+-containing buffer (133.8 mM NaCI, 4.7 mM KCI, 1.25 mM CaCI2, 1.25 mM MgCI2, 0.97 mM Na2HP04, 0.23 mM NaH2P04, 5 mM Hepes, 5 mM glucose,<br>
a pH of 7.0 was established using 1 M NaOH). For the determination of the 0% value, the cells were incubated in an Na+-free buffer (133.8 mM choline chloride, 4.7 mM KCI, 1.25 mM CaCI2j 1.25 mM MgCfc. 0.97 mM K2HP04, 0.23 mM KH2P04, 5 mM Hepes,<br>
5 mM glucose, a pH of 7.0 was established using 1 M NaOH). The substances to be tested were made up in the Na+-containing buffer. The recovery of the intracellular pH at each tested concentration of a substance was expressed in percent of the maximum recovery. The percentages of the pH recovery were used to calculate the IC50 value of the particular substance for the individual NHE subtypes by means of the program Sigma-Plot.<br>
The inhibitory data of some example compounds were shown by way of example in Table 2.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
