				<td>Amino derivatives of androstanes and androstenes as medicaments for<br>
cardiovascular disorders<br>
The present invention relates to new amino derivatives at position 3 of<br>
5- and/or 6- and/or 7-substituted androstanes and androstenes,<br>
processes for their preparation, and to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing them for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, such as<br>
heart failure and hypertension.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cardiovascular diseases. are still the first cause of morbidity and<br>
mortality in the western world; among these, hypertension and heart<br>
failure are two frequent diseases. Hypertension is one of the most<br>
important cardiovascular risk factor and more than one third of<br>
population over 60 suffer from this disease. Congestive heart failure<br>
affects 1-2% of the population and even 10% of the very elderly; the<br>
percentage is expected to rise (Sharpe N., et al., The Lancet, 1998, 352,<br>
(suppl. 1), 3-17). Beside, hypertension may be one of more important<br>
causes of heart failure in the elderly {Eur. Heart J., 2001, 22, 1527-<br>
1560). Although a number of effective drugs are available for the<br>
treatment of both hypertension and heart failure, further research is in<br>
progress to find more effective and safe compounds. Several drugs are<br>
used in combination for the treatment of heart failure, and among<br>
positive inotropic agents, digoxin is the most prescribed digitalis<br>
cardiac glycoside that can improve the myocardial performance. A very<br>
well-known drawback of digitalis drugs is their arrhythmogenic side-<br>
effect. Evidence of digitalis toxicity emerges at two- to three-fold higher<br>
serum concentration than the therapeutic dose, such as disturbances of<br>
conduction and cardiac arrhythmias which are characteristics of<br>
digitalis toxicity {Hoffman, B. F.; Bigger, J. T, Digitalis and Allied<br>
Cardiac Glycosides. In The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 8th<br>
ed.; Goodman Gilman, A.; Nies, A. S.; Rail, T. W.; Taylor, P., Eds.;<br>
Pergamon Press, New York, 1990, pp 814-839).<br><br>
The capability of the natural digitalis compounds to increase the<br>
myocardial force of contraction is strictly related to their cardenolide<br>
structure having a 17β-lactone on a 14-hydroxy-5β,14β-androstane<br>
skeleton.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
In the field of steroidal derivatives some groups of compounds are<br>
reported to possess positive inotropic properties or other activities<br>
related to the cardiovascular system.<br>
Particularly, within pregnane derivatives the following papers are<br>
interesting.<br>
GB 868,303 discloses pregnane-20-one derivatives possessing<br>
progestational and antifibrillatory action.<br>
Other aminoalkylesters of 3β-hydroxypregn-5-en-20-one derivatives are<br>
disclosed by GB 966,060, with anorectic, antiarrhythmic and<br>
antiatherogenic activities, and US 3,013,009, with eurithmic,<br>
anticonvulsant, and antihypertensive activities.<br>
US 5,144,017 discloses "compounds that bind to the digitalis receptor"<br>
including androstane and pregnane derivatives. According to the<br>
inventors, the binding to the digitalis receptor parallels the ability to<br>
elicit characteristic cellular response. The inventors focus on the<br>
capability of the different classes of steroids of yielding glycosides<br>
derivatives with typical digoxin-like actions on the heart as well as on<br>
other tissues, which seems to be important improve the toxicity of these<br>
compounds. Even though some androstane derivatives are reported,<br>
the more interesting compounds are 3-glycosides of pregnane<br>
derivatives.<br>
Pregnane guanyhydrazones with positive inotropic cardiac effect are<br>
reported by S. Schütz, et al., Arzneimittel-Forschung, 1969, 19, 69-75.<br><br>
Particularly relevant to the activity of these compounds is the<br>
guanylhydrazone substituent, since "replacement of the guanyl<br>
hydrazone groups by other related residues results in a loss of activity".<br>
Other pregnene-20-one derivatives, such as clormadinone acetate and<br>
megestrol acetate are reported to inhibit the activity of Na+,K+-ATPase<br>
but they were not "capable of eliciting an inotropic action by<br>
themselves" (K. Temma, et al., Research. Comm. Chem. in Pathology<br>
and Pharmacology, 1983, 41, 51-63).<br>
In the field of 5oc,14oc-androstane the following papers are interesting.<br>
GB 1,175,219 and US 3,580,905 disclose 3-(aminoalkoxycarbonylalky-<br>
lene) steroid derivatives which possess digitalis like activities with "a<br>
ratio between the dose which produces toxic symptoms (onset of cardiac<br>
arrhythmias) and the effective dose comparable with such a ratio as<br>
measured for standard cardiac glycosides". Besides no clear advantage<br>
over digitalis glycosides, the compounds with the highest ratio produce<br>
the lowest increase in contractile force.<br>
6-Hydroxy and 6-oxoandrostane derivatives are disclosed in EP 0 825<br>
197 Bl as ligands and inhibitors of Na+,K+-ATPase, and positive<br>
inotropic agents possessing a lower toxicity when compared with<br>
digoxin, as evaluated on the basis of the acute toxicity in mice. The<br>
same compounds are also reported by S. De Munari, et al, J. Med.<br>
Chem. 2003, 64, 3644-3654.<br>
The evidence that high levels of endogenous ouabain (EO), a closely<br>
related isomer of ouabain, are implicated in human hypertension and<br>
cardiac hypertrophy and failure stimulated the pharmacological<br>
research for developing novel anti-hypertensive agents active as<br>
ouabain antagonists. The pathogenetic mechanisms through which<br>
increased EO levels affect cardiovascular system involve the<br>
modulation of Na-K ATPase, the key enzyme responsible for renal<br>
tubular sodium reabsorption and the activation of signalling<br><br>
transduction pathways implicated in growth-related gene transcription.<br>
By studying both genetic and experimental rat models of hypertension<br>
and comparing them with humans, it has been demonstrated that<br>
elevated levels of circulating EO and the genetic polymorphism of the<br>
cytoskeletal protein adducin associate with hypertension and high<br>
renal Na-K pump activity. Ouabain itself induces hypertension and up-<br>
regulates renal Na-K pump when chronically infused at low doses into<br>
rats (OS). In renal cultured cells, either incubated for several days with<br>
nanomolar concentrations of ouabain or transfected with the<br>
hypertensive adducin genetic variant, the Na-K pump results<br>
enhanced. Moreover, both EO and adducin polymorphism affect cardiac<br>
complications associated to hypertension, the former through the<br>
activation of a signalling transduction pathway. As a consequence, a<br>
compound able to interact with the cellular and molecular alterations,<br>
sustained by EO or mutated adducin, may represent the suitable<br>
treatment for those patients in whom these mechanisms are at work<br>
(Ferrandi M., et al., Curr Pharm Des. 2005;ll(25):3301-5).<br>
As reported above, the crucial point of positive inotropic agents is the<br>
ability to discriminate between the potency in inducing an increase of<br>
myocardial force of contraction and the onset of cardiac arrhythmias.<br>
There is still a constant need to make available drugs showing a better<br>
therapeutic ratio and/or a longer duration of action, both of them<br>
important factors for the compliance of patients. Preferably, the drugs<br>
can be administered by oral route.<br>
Other substituted steroids are reported possessing completely different<br>
pharmacological activities.<br>
Dehydroepiandrosterone 3β-aminoethers or aminoesters substituted in<br>
position 7 with a keto or eventually substituted alkoxy groups are<br>
disclosed in US 2003/0054021 and WO 03/035023 Al as cosmetical or<br>
therapeutical treatments of cutaneous disorders related to keratinous<br>
afflictions.<br><br>
3-Dialkylaminoethers and 3-dialkylaminothioethers of 3β-hydroxy-6α-<br>
methylandrostanes or of 3β-hydroxy-6-methyl-5-androstenes are discl-<br>
osed in US 3,210,386 as hypocholesterolemic and antiparasitic agents.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It has now been found that 3-amino derivatives of 5- and/or 6- and/or 7-<br>
substituted androstanes and androstenes meet the needs of to provide<br>
drugs with a better therapeutic ratio and/or longer duration of action.<br>

Greene and P. G. M. Wuts "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", J.<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 3rd Ed., 1999) and well known to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
All said transformations are only examples of well established<br>

and well known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
We have found that the derivatives (I), prepared according to the<br>
invention, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are useful<br>
agents for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, such as heart<br>
failure and hypertension. Moreover said compounds show affinity and<br>
inhibit the enzymatic activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase.<br>
Since the compounds of the present invention are shown to be able to<br>
antagonize the molecular effects induced by nanomolar ouabain<br>
concentrations on the Na-KATPase, they will be effective the treatment<br>
of the diseases caused by the hypertensive effects of endogenous<br>
ouabain.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the the diseases<br>
caused by the hypertensive effects of endogenous ouabain include: renal<br>
failure progression in autosomal dominant polycystic renal disease<br>
(ADPKD), preeclamptic hypertension and proteinuria and renal failure<br>
progression in patients with adducin polymorphisms.<br>
In autosomal dominant polycystic renal disease (ADPKD), cyst<br>
formation and enlargement are due to cell proliferation and<br>
transepithelial secretion of fluids, causing progressive impairment<br>
renal function and kidney failure. 1 over 1000 subjects are affected by<br>
ADPKD which represents the first genetic cause of renal failure. Renal<br>
Na-K ATPase is essential for ion and fluid transport in ADPKD cells<br>
and its mislocation and function alteration have been described in this<br>
pathology (Wilson PD et al. Am J Pathol 2000; 156:253-268). Ouabain,<br>
the inhibitor of the Na-KATPase, inhibits fluid secretion in ADPKD<br>
cysts (Grantham JJ et al. I Clin. Invest. 1995; 95:195-202) at<br>
micromolar concentrations, conversely, at nanomolar concentrations,<br>
which are similar to the circulating endogenous ouabain ones, ouabain<br>
stimulates ADPKD cell proliferation but does not affect normal human<br>
kidney cell growth (Nguyen AN et al. 2007; 18:46-57) . It has been<br><br>
demonstrated that ouabain stimulates ADPKD proliferation by binding<br>
to the Na-KATPase with high affinity and triggering the activation of<br>
the MEK-ERK pathway (Nguyen AN et al. 2007; 18:46-57).<br>
Preeclampsia is a potential devastating disorder of hypertension in<br>
pregnancy for which an effective treatment is still lacking. Elevated<br>
circulating levels of cardenolides and bufodienolides have been reported<br>
in preeclamptic patients and in rat models of the disease (Lopatin DA<br>
et al J. Hypertens. 1999;17:1179-1187; Graves SV et al. Am J<br>
Hypertens. 1995; 8:5-11; Adair CD et al. Am J Nephrol. 1996; 16:529-<br>
531). The data available suggest that in preeclampsia elevated plasma<br>
concentrations of Na-K ATPase inhibitors lead to vasoconstriction and<br>
malignant hypertension (Vu HV et al. Am J Nephrol. 2005; 25:520-<br>
528). Recently, Digoxin-specific Fab (Digibind) have been proved to<br>
reduce blood pressure and increase natriuresis in preeclamptic patients<br>
(Pullen MA al.-JPET 2004; 310:319-325).<br>
Glomerulosclerosis-associated proteinuria is due to an impairment of<br>
the slit-pore structure formed by the podocyte foot-processes in the<br>
glomerulus. In particular, slit diaphragm proteins such as nephrin,<br>
ZOl, podocyn, synaptopodin and others, in addition to their structural<br>
functions participate in common signaling pathways regulated by Fyn<br>
a tyrosin kinase of the Src family kinases ( Benzing T. J Am Soc<br>
Nephrol 2004; 15:1382-1391). Recently, a key role in the structure of<br>
the slit pore has been ascribed to beta adducin, a cytoskeletal protein<br>
under the control of Fyn (Gotoh H BBRC 2006; 346:600-605; Shima T<br>
et al. JBC 2001; 276: 42233-42240). Adducin polymorphisms joint to<br>
that of ACE have been found associated to impaired renal function in<br>
European and Chinese populations (Wang JG et al. J Mol Med 2004;<br>
82:715-722; Wang JG et al. Am J Kidney Dis. 2001; 38: 1158-1168).<br>
Rostafuroxin and analogues, as endogenous ouabain antagonists, have<br>
been described to be able to antagonize the molecular effect of adducin<br>
polymorphism on tyrosin kinase signaling (Ferrandi M. et al.<br>
JBC.2004; 279:33306-14; Ferrari et al.Am J Physiol Regul 2006;<br>
290:R529-535; Ferrari P. et al. Med Hypothes. 2007; 68:1307-1314).<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions will contain at least one compound of<br>
Formula (I) as an active ingredient, in an amount such as to produce a<br>
significant therapeutic effect. The compositions covered by the present<br>
invention are entirely conventional and are obtained with methods<br>
which are common practice in the pharmaceutical industry, such as, for<br>
example, those illustrated in Remington's Pharmaceutical Science<br>
Handbook, Mack Pub. N.Y. - last edition. According to the<br>
administration route chosen, the compositions will be in solid or liquid<br>
form, suitable for oral, parenteral or intravenous administration. The<br>

active ingredient, at least one pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or<br>
excipient. These may be particularly useful formulation coadjuvants,<br>
e.g. solubilising agents, dispersing agents, suspension agents, and<br>
emulsifying agents.<br>
Moreover the compounds of the present invention possess positive<br>
inotropic features, as shown by slow intravenous infusion in<br>
anesthetized guinea pig according to Cerri (Cerri A. et al., J. Med.<br>
Chem. 2000, 43, 2332) and have a low toxicity when compared with<br>
standard cardiotonic steroids, e.g. digoxin.<br>

Biological results<br>
To test the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase,<br>
the Na+,K+-ATPase was purified according to Jorghensen (Jorghensen<br>
P., BBA, 1974, 356, 36) and Erdmann (Erdmann E. et al.,<br>
Arzneim.Forsh., 1984, 34, 1314) and the inhibition was measured as %<br>
of hydrolysis of 32P-ATP in presence and in absence of the tested<br>
compound (Mall F. et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 1984, 33, 47; see Table<br>
1).<br><br><br><br><br>
Moreover the compounds of the present invention possess positive<br>
inotropic features, as shown by slow intravenous infusion in<br>
anesthetized guinea pig according to Cerri (Cerri A. et al., J. Med.<br>
Chem. 2000, 43, 2332) and have a low toxicity, i.e. a better therapeutic<br>
ratio, when compared with standard cardiotonic steroids, e.g. digoxin.<br>
The compounds of the present invention possess a higher efficacy<br>
and/or a better therapeutic ratio and/or a longer duration of action<br>
compared to compound 22b ((EZ) 3-(2-aminoethoxyimino)androstane-<br>
6,17-dione hydrochloride) reported by S. De Munari et al. in J. Med.<br>
Chem. 2003, 64, 3644-3654. The activity of some compounds of general<br>
formula (I) on the above mentioned tests was determined and the<br>
results are shown in the following Table 2. The inotropic activity is<br>
shown as maximum increase in contractile force (Emax measured as<br>
+dP/dTmax), dose inducing maximum positive inotropic effect (EDmax),<br>
inotropic potency (ED80, dose increasing +dP/dTmax by 80%); the toxicity<br><br>
as the ratio between lethal dose and inotropic potency, or safety ratio,<br>
(calculated in the died animals); the maximum dose infused in the<br>
survived animals; the duration of the inotropic effect as the decrease of<br>
the effect from the EDmax measured 20 minutes after the end of the<br>
infusion.<br><br>
As reported in Table 2, the compounds show positive inotropic effects<br>
with higher safety ratios than those displayed by digoxin and compd<br>
22b. In fact the lethal dose/ED80 ratios were either higher or even not<br><br>
determinable, when no animals died; noteworthy, for some compounds<br>
a lower percentage of animals died in comparison to digoxin and compd<br>
22b. Further, some compounds showed a prolonged action, as shown by<br>
the persistence of the inotropic effect after stopping the infusion (%<br>
decrease from Emax after 20 min from the end of the infusion). When no<br>
animal died, higher doses were not tested since the maximum increases<br>
in contractile force were comparable or higher to those displayed by<br>
digoxin and compd 22b.<br>
Further data on the longer duration of action of the compounds of the<br>
present invention were originated and the results are shown in Table 3;<br>
where the results of the metabolism of the compounds in fresh rat<br>
hepatocytes are reported (from Sprague Dawley, males, weights in the<br>
range 285-295 grams; viability 80-90%; concentration: 2590000-<br>
3084000 hepatocytes/ml; test item nominal concentration: 45 µ M) are<br>
reported in comparison with corapd 22b which is almost completely<br>
metabolized within 60 minutes.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention possess also antihypertensive<br>
activity, as taught by P. Ferrari et al., in Cardiovascular Drug Reviews,<br>
1999, 17, 39-57, who demonstrated that compounds affecting Na+,K+-<br>
ATPase can lower blood pressure in models of hypertension.<br><br>
The ability of these compounds to lower blood pressure was tested by<br>
using an animal model with induced hypertension, in particular, rats<br>
made hypertensive by chronic infusion of ouabain, according to Ferrari<br>
P., et al. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1998, 285, 83-94.<br>
The procedure adopted to test the antihypertensive activity of the<br>
compounds on the above mentioned model was the following: systolic<br>
blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HE) were measured by an indirect<br>
taII-cuff method. The blood pressure lowering effect was measured in<br>
hypertensive ouabain-sensitive rats. The compound, suspended in<br>
Methocel 0.5% (w/v), was administered daily at the dose of 10 µg/kg/day<br>
by mouth for four weeks. SBP and HR were measured weekly 6 hours<br>
after the treatment. The comparison are ouabain sensitive rats (OS<br>
rats) and non hypertensive rats (control), both treated only with<br>
Methocel 0.5% (w/v). As shown in the following Table 4, treatment with<br>
a compound of the present, invention lowers the blood pressure of OS<br>
rats (170 mm Hg) to almost the level of control rats (150 mm Hg).<br><br><br>
