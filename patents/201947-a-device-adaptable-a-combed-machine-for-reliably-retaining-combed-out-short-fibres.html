				<td>2<br>
The present invention relates to a fitting for a combing machine which is provided in the form<br>
of punched or stamped needles, of a serrated segment or of a serrated strip-<br>
Fittings of this type are employed in textile-processing machines wherein a fibre strip is<br>
combed so as to align the fibres and to remove any impurities.	"<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to improve the result, in particular to reliably retain combed-out short fibres and impurities.<br>
The present invention achieves this object due to the fact that the said teeth or needles are staggered in the area of their free projection counter to the direction of combing.<br>
This design according to the present invention allows the fibres to be smoothly pulled through the fitting while on the other hand the said stripping and retaining effect is enhanced by decreasing the projected free passage area. This reduces the absolute value of the noil, which, from a combing-technological point of view, is even more important than the reduction of the long fibre share in the noil. The shell parts stick less, and thus the fitting gets less clogged. The stress reduction of the entire comb increases its lifetime.<br>
As a further development of this invention, it is envisaged to have the subsequent teeth of the serrated segment or the serrated strip staggered alternately in different directions.<br>
With regard to a fitting using punched or stamped needles, it may be envisaged that the adjacent needles of a needle strip and/or fixed comb are staggered in the same direction, i.e. parallel to each other.<br>
With regard to circular combs, it is known per se to slightly slant serrated segments or bars of serrated segments relative to the combing direction. A design according to the present invention suggests to superimpose the staggering of the needle tips onto this slanting position.<br>
Hereafter, the present invention will be further explained in the light of preferred embodirevised-<br>
ments and with reference to the accompanying drawing in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a side view of a serrated wire according to the present invention; Fig 2 shows a sectional view along the line ll-ll in Fig. 1; Fig 3 shows a sectional view along the line Ill-Ill in Fig. 1,<br><br>
3<br>
Fig. 4 shows an enlarged view of the area IV in Fig. 2;<br>
Fig. 5 shows a partly opened view of a fixed comb having punched needles;<br>
Fig. 6 shows a plan view of the narrow side of the fixed comb; and<br>
Fig. 7 shows a side view.<br>
Figs. 1 through 4 illustrate a portion of an endless serrated wire or a serrated punched part comprising a basic strip 2 and a plurality of teeth 3 extending upward therefrom. Conventionally, the said teeth 3 are arranged in a parallel arrangement in one plane.<br>
In contrast to the foregoing, the present invention suggests that the free projection of the said teeth 3 above the basic strip 2 is staggered relative to the combing direction (arrow 4), i.e. to the direction of the relative movement between fibre strip and teeth 3. This means that the said teeth 3 deviate by an angle a or ? from the said direction (arrow 4) or the longitudinal axis 5 of the basic strip 2. Thus, the said teeth 3 are swayed around their longitudinal axis, i.e. around a radial axis in case of a circular comb and around an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal extension in case of a fixed comb. In the present embodiment, both angles a and<br>
? have the same size but extend towards opposite directions relative to the longitudinal axis<br>
5. In other words: the said teeth 3 are alternately deviated or staggered to the left and right, respectively.<br>
Figs. 5 through 7 show a fixed.comb comprising a plurality of needles 3' which are arranged adjacent to each other in one row and which are covered by two metal cover sheets 6, 7.<br>
The needles 3' comprise a free needle projection 8, i.e. an active combing portion which is not covered by the said metal cover sheets 6,7. In the area of the said free needle projection 8, the needles which represent punched metal sheet parts are staggered, i.e. bent away from their original plane by the same angle, respectively.<br><br>
