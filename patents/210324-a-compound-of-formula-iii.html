				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a chemical process and, more particularly, to a process for preparing 2-(pyrid-2-yloxymethyl)phenylacetates. These compounds are useful ,as intermediates for producing agricultural pesticides.<br>
Some new agricultural fungicides and insecticides, which are methyl 2-[2-(aryl- and heteroaryloxymethyl)phenyl]-3-methoxyacrylates, are described in EP-A-0278595 along with a variety of methods for their preparation.   In one method described, 3-isochromanone is converted into a methyl 2-halomethylphenylacetate using a hydrogen halide in methanol, followed by reaction with the metal salt of a hydroxyaryl or heteroaryl compound and the subsequent transformation of the methyl acetate group into a methyl methoxyacrylate group. The transformation is said also to be accomplished in two steps if the isochromanone is treated with the hydrogen halide in a non-alcoholic solvent and the resulting phenylacetic acid esterified. In another method, when the aryl or heteroaryl group is sufficiently activated,-the compounds may be prepared from a methyl 2-(2-hydroxymethylphenyl)-3-methoxyacrylate and an aryl or heteroaryl species containing a leaving group such as a halide group or a CH3SO4 anion or sulphonyloxy anion, often in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride, potassium f-butoxide or potassium carbonate.<br>
The present invention provides a novel process for preparing methyl 2-(pyrid-2-yloxy-methyl)phenylacetate intermediates for use in the production of methyl 2-[2-(pyrid-2-yloxymethyl)phenyl]-3-methoxyacrylate pesticides.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a methyl 2-(pyrid-2-yloxymethyl)phenylacetate of formula (I)1 wherein A and D are independently H, halo, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, phenyl, phenoxy, nitro, amino, acylamino, cyano, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl or alkylcarbonyloxy or equivalent and m is 0 or an integer of from 1 to 3 provided that A is other than H when m is an integer of from 1 to 3, which comprises reacting a 2-pyridine of formula (II) wherein L is a leaving group and A, D and m are as defined above, with a compound MO-CHaR wherein M is a metal atom and R is the residue of a metal salt of 2-phenylacetic acid, and methylating the metal salt of the 2-pyridyloxymethyl-phenylacetic acid so obtained.<br>
1 See "Chemical Formulae" at the end of this specification for chemical structures.<br><br>
Halo is typically fluorine, chlorine or bromine.<br>
The alkyl moiety of haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, alkoxycarbonyl and alkylcarbonyloxy contains for example, from 1 to 8 or 1 to 6, typically from 1 to 4, carbon atoms in the form of straight or branched chains. Examples are methyl, ethyl, n- and wo-propyl, n-, sec, iso- and terf-butyl, n-hexyl and n-octyl.<br>
Examples of haloalkyl groups include halo(C1-4)alkyl, typically halomethyl and haloethyl, which include trifluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, fluoromethyl, trichloromethyl, dichloromethyl, chloromethyl and pentafluoroethyl. Examples of haloalkoxy are trifluoro-and trichloromethoxy. Examples of alkoxycarbonyl and alkylcarbonyloxy are methoxycarbonyl and acetoxy. Acylamino includes, in particular, CM alkanoylamino, for example, formamido and acetylamino.<br>
Phenyl and phenoxy groups may themselves be substituted by one or more substituents. Suitable substituents include, for example, halo, C1-6 alkyl, halo(CM)alkyl, CM alkoxy, thio(C1-4)alkoxy, halo(C1-4)alkoxy, phenyl, phenoxy, cyano, nitro, amino, mono-or di-(CM)alkylamino, CM alkanoylamino, carboxy, CM alkoxycarbonyl or CM alkylcarbonyloxy.<br>
Where m is 2 or 3, the substituent D may have the same or different values.<br>
The metal atom M in the compound MO-CH2R and the metal in the metal salt of the residue R may be an alkali or alkaline earth metal, or it could be another metal, for example, silver. Usually, it will be sodium or potassium and M and the metal in the metal salt of the residue R will be the same. Thus the compound MO-CHiR will usually be the di-sodium or di-potassium salt of 2-hydroxymethylphenylacetic acid.<br>
The leaving group L of the pyridine of formula (IT) is in the 2-position of the pyridine ring and is any suitable leaving group for ether formation with a benzyl alcohol. Examples include halide (chloride, bromide or iodide) and an alkylsulphonyl group.<br>
Methylation of the metal salt of the 2-pyridyloxymethylphenylacetic acid is carried out with any suitable methylating agent, typically dimethyl sulphate or methyl iodide. However, other methods can be used, for example, treatment with thionyl chloride followed by the addition of methanol.<br>
In one aspect the invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (I), wherein A and D are as defined above and m is 0 or 1, which comprises reacting a compound of formula (IT) wherein L is halo or methylsulphonyl and A, D and m are as<br><br>
defined above, with a compound of formula (HI) wherein M is an alkali metal, and methylating the metal salt of the 2-pyridyloxymethylphenylacetic acid so obtained.<br>
Where m is 1, D is attached, for example, to the 4-position of the pyridine ring.<br>
Thus, in another aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (I) wherein A and D are independently halo (especially chloro or bromo) or halo-(C1-4)alkyl (especially trifluoromethyl), m is 0 or 1 and where m is 1, D is attached to the 4-position of the pyridine ring, which comprises reacting a compound of formula (II) wherein L is halo or methylsulphonyl and A and D are as defined above, with a compound of formula (in) wherein M is sodium or potassium, and methylating the 2-pyridyloxymethylphenylacetic acid so obtained.<br>
The invention process is conveniently carried out by heating the 2-pyridine with the compound MO-CH2R in a suitable solvent at elevated temperature until reaction is as complete as desired, and then adding a suitable methylating agent. A catalyst such as potassium iodide or a crown ether may be used to assist reaction.<br>
The temperature of reaction will depend on the solvent employed but is suitably in the range of from 50°C to 120°C, typically 60°C to 115°C. W-Methylpyrrolidone is a suitable solvent.<br>
The compound (I) can be isolated by drowning the reaction mixture into water and extracting it with a suitable water-immiscible solvent such as diethylether. The ether extracts can be washed with water, dried and the ether removed by evaporation.<br>
The starting material MO-CH2R, wherein M is a metal atom and R is the residue of a metal salt of 2-phenylacetic acid, is a novel compound and forms another aspect of the present invention. In particular, the invention further provides a compound of formula (ffl) where M is a metal atom, suitably an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal atom, for example, sodium or potassium. The disodium salt of 2-hydroxymethylphenylacetic acid is particularly mentioned.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the preparation of the compound MO-CHjR which comprises treating 3-isochromanone with a metal salt under basic conditions. In particular, it provides a process for the preparation of the compound of formula (IE) wherein M is an alkali metal, which comprises treating 3-isochromanone with an alkali metal hydroxide. The process is conveniently carried out by heating 3-isochromanone at a temperature of from 40 to 130°C, for example from 50 to 110°C, typically from 50 to 85°C,<br>
for instance at around 80°C, in an aqueous, basic solution containing the metal salt together with a suitable solvent such as toluene. The product can be isolated as a solid by separating the aqueous and organic layers, adding more water, if necessary, to dissolve any precipitated product, and reducing the aqueous layer to dryness using for, example, distillation or azeotropic distillation techniques.<br>
Conveniently, the compound (I) can be prepared from 3-isochromanone in a "one-pot" process without the intermediate isolation of the compound of formula MO-CH2R. Thus in yet another aspect, the invention provides a process for the preparation of a methyl 2-(pyrid-2-yloxymethyl)phenylacetate of formula (I) wherein A and D are independently H, halo, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, phenyl, phenoxy, nitro, amino, acylamino, cyano, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl or alkylcarbonyloxy or equivalent and m is 0 or an integer from 1 to 3 provided that A is other than H when m is an integer of from 1 to 3, which comprises the steps:<br>
(a)       treating 3-isochromanone with a metal salt under basic conditions to form a compound MO-CHjR wherein M is a metal atom and R is the residue of a metal salt of 2-phenylacetic acid, and<br>
(b)'     contacting the product of step (a) with a 2-pyridine of formula (II) wherein L is a leaving group and A, D and m are as defined above, and methylating the metal salt of the 2-pyridyloxymethylphenylacetic acid so obtained.<br>
In further aspects of the present invention, steps (a) and (b) of the "one-pot" process may be refined as described previously for each of those steps individually.<br>
Step (a) of the "one-pot" process can be carried out by heating 3-isochromanone, as described above, in an aqueous, basic solution containing the metal salt together with a solvent such as toluene or cyclohexane, which can be used to remove water, after ring opening, by azeotropic distillation. Alternatively, a different solvent such as W-methyl-pyrrolidone can be used, and toluene or cyclohexane added after ring opening to permit water removal. A phase transfer catalyst such as cetrimide or polyethylene glycol 400 dimethylether can be used to assist reaction.   After distillation, the residual mixture is cooled to the appropriate reaction temperature for step (b) of the process and the 2-pyridine added. After reaction, the 2-pyridyloxymethylphenylacetic acid is methylated and the methyl ester isolated as described above.<br>
The 2-pyridines used in the process of the invention are either already commercially available or can be prepared from commercially available materials by methods well documented in the chemical literature.  3-Isochromanone is commercially available.<br>
The subject invention relates to a compound of formula (III)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein M is a metal atom.<br>
The product of the invention process is a useful intermediate for the preparation of agricultural fungicides and insecticides, such as those described in EP-A-0278595. Processes for preparing these fungicides from the intermediates by formylation and methylation are fully described therein.<br>
