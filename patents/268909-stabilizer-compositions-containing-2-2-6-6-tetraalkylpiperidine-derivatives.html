stabilizer mixture Description<br>
The invention relates to a mixture composed of oligomeric and monomeric compounds of HALS type, to a process for their preparation, and also to their use as stabilizers for organic material.<br>
Organic material, in particular plastics and paints, is known to decompose very rapidly, especially via exposure to light. This decomposition is usually apparent from yellowing, discoloration, cracking, or embrittlement of the material. Light stabilizers and other stabilizers are therefore intended to achieve satisfactory prevention of decomposition of organic material via light, oxygen, and heat.<br>
Derivatives of 2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidine, termed HALS (Hindered Amine Light Stabilizers), have been used commercially now for about thirty years as light stabilizers and other stabilizers, in particular for plastics and paints.<br>
WO 94/12544 describes maleimide-a-olefin copolymers which have HALS groups as substituents, features of these copolymers being not only the lack of any tendency toward migration within the material to be protected but also good compatibility with the usual types of plastic, and good solubility, and excellent compatibility in the usual paint systems.<br>
Although these compounds are now achieving excellent success in practical commercial use, there is nevertheless room for improvement, in particular with regard to storage properties and transport properties.<br>
It is therefore an object to provide further improved light stabilizers, in particular with improved storage properties and improved transport properties.<br>
The object is achieved via a mixture of the oligomeric HALS described above with certain low-molar-mass (M 
 <br>
Mixtures of oligomeric and low-molecular-weight HALS are previously known, for example in the form of TinuvinÂ® 791 from Ciba Specialty Chemicals, but these involve structurally different oligomeric compounds which cannot lead to any conclusion concerning any advantageous action of the inventive mixture.<br>
The invention therefore provides a mixture, comprising<br>
A.      at least one oligomeric compound, comprising repeat units of the formula (I),<br><br>
in which the meanings of the symbols are as follows:<br>
R1	is hydrogen, C1-C6-alkyI, formyl, C2-C6-alkanoyI, C1-C12-alkoxy,<br>
C5-C6-cycloalkoxy, cyanomethyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, benzyl or a radical of the formula -CR'=CH-CO-OR", where<br>
R'1is hydrogen, C1-C6-alkyI or a radical of the formula -CO-OR", and<br>
R"	is C1-C18-alkyl, C5-C6-cycloalkyl, C7-C16-aralkyl, phenyl, or tolyl;<br>
R^	is a mixture composed of C14-C28-alkyl groups, where two of these<br>
alkyl groups whose number of carbon atoms is not permitted to differ by more than two respectively make up at least 30% of this mixture;<br>
R3 and R4,      independently of one another, are C1-C6-alkyI;<br>
and<br><br><br>
where the meanings of the symbols and indices are as follows:<br>
n and m,	independently of one another, are a natural number from 2 to<br>
22,<br>
and<br>
R1R3andR4',     independently of one another, have the meanings given in formula (I).<br>
The inventive mixtures are used for stabilization of organic material, in particular of polymers, with respect to the effect of light.<br>
The average molecular weight of the oligomers (A) is generally from 1000 to 50 000, preferably from 1500 to 10 000, in particular from 2000 to 5000. The molecular weights given are number-average molecular weights.<br><br>
The average number of repeat units is from 3 to 100, preferably from 4 to 30, in particular from 5 to 10.<br>
The radical R1 is preferably H, C1-C16-alkyI, formyl, acyl, C1C6-alkoxy, or benzyl, particularly preferably H, methyl, formyl, acyl or benzyl, in particular H.<br>
The radical R2 is a mixture composed of C14-C28-alkyI groups, preferably C16-C24-alkyl groups, in particular C16-C22-alkyl groups, and the units on which the copolymer is based are therefore C16-C30 a-olefins, preferably C18-C26 a-olefins, in particular C20-C24 a-olefins. R2 is preferably linear alkyl groups.<br>
The presence of a mixture of alkyl groups for R2 means that, when a statistical average is taken across the entire number of all of the copolymer molecules present, two particular alkyl groups whose number of carbon atoms is not permitted to differ by more than two respectively make up at least 30%, preferably respectively make up at least 40%, of this mixture. These are in particular mixtures of 3 particular alkyl groups, e.g. octadecyl, eicosyl, and docosyl, where two of these groups whose number of carbon atoms differs by 2 make up more than 40% of the mixture, and the third group makes up from 3 to 18% of the mixture; other alkyl groups having somewhat fewer than 18 or somewhat more than 22 carbon atoms can be present in the mixture here; their amounts being very small, usually less than 2%.<br>
If not othenwise stated percentages refer to percent by weight.<br>
The radicals R3 and R4 are preferably C1-C4-alkyl, particularly preferably methyl, and the meaning of all of the radicals R3and R4 is in particular respectively methyl.<br>
Alkyl radicals that can be used and are claimed in the form of C1C6 (for R3 and R4) and C1-C18 (for R") are branched, and in particular straight-chain members of the group, and therefore especially methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-amyl, isoamyl, sec-amyl, tert-amyl, neopentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, 2-ethylhexyl, 2-propylheptyl, n-nonyl, isononyl, n-decyl, n-undecyl, n-dodecyl, n-tridecyl, isotridecyl, n-tetradecyl, n-pentadecyl, n-hexadecyl, n-heptadecyl, and n-octadecyl.<br>
Straight-chain or branched C2-C6-alkanoyl that can be used for R1 is especially acetyl, but also propionyl, butyryl, isobutyryl, pentanoyi, and hexanoyl.<br>
Especially suitable straight-chain or branched C1-C12-alkoxy groups for R1 are C6-C8 alkoxy groups, such as n-hexoxy, isohexoxy, n-octoxy, 2-ethylhexoxy, and isooctoxy, but also methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, isobutoxy, sec-butoxy, tert-<br><br>
butoxy, n-pentoxy, n-nonoxy, n-decoxy, n-undecoxy, and n-dodecoxy.<br>
C5-C6-cycloalkoxy groups for R1 are especially cyclopentoxy and cyclohexoxy.<br>
C5-C8-cycloalkyI radicals that can be used for R" are especially cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl, but also cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, methylcyclopentyl, dimethylcyclopentyl, methylcyclohexyl, ethylcyclohexyl, and dimethylcyclohexyl.<br>
Examples of suitable C7-C16-aralkyl radicals for R1 are naphthylmethyl, diphenylmethyl, or methylbenzyl, but in particular C7-C18-phenylalkyl, such as 1-phenylethyl, 2-phenylethyl, 1-phenylpropyl, 2-phenylpropyl, 3-phenylpropyl, 2-phenylprop-2-yl, 4-phenylbutyl, 2,2-dimethyl-2-phenylethyl, 5-phenylamyl, 10-phenyldecyl, 12-phenyldodecyl, or preferably benzyl.<br>
Tolyl radicals that can be used are ortho-, meta-, and preferably p-tolyl.<br>
An oligomer having the repeat unit (la) whose number-average molar mass is from 3000 to 4000 g/mol is particularly preferred as oligomeric component A<br><br>
A compound of this type is obtainable as UvinulÂ® 5050 H from BASF Aktiengesellschaft, Ludwigshafen, Germany.<br>
If the oligomeric component (A) is not obtainable commercially, the compounds can be prepared by the methods given in WO 94/12544.<br>
Among the low-molecular-weight compounds (II) and (III) of component (B), preference is given to those in which the meanings of the symbols and indices are as follows:<br><br>
R1	is preferably H,  C1-C4-alkyl,  formyl,  acyl,  or benzyl,  particularly<br>
preferably H, methyl, formyl, acyl, or benzyl, especially preferably H.<br>
R3 and R4	are   preferably   C1-C4-alkyl,   particularly   preferably   methyl,   and<br>
especially preferably all of the radicals R3 and R4 are methyl.<br>
m and n	are preferably a natural number from 4 to 10, particularly preferably 6<br><br>
or 8, and especially preferably m is the number 6 and n is the number 8.<br>
Preferred are compounds (II) and (III) in which the symbols and indices have the preferred meanings. Particularly preferred are the compounds (II) and (III) in which the symbols and indices have the particularly preferred meanings. Especially preferred are compounds (II) and (III) where the symbols and indices have the especially preferred meanings.<br>
The compounds (lla), (Ilia), and (lllb) are particularly preferred as compounds of component (B)<br><br><br><br>
these being commercially obtainable as UvinulÂ® 4050 H and UvinulÂ® 4077 H from BASF Aktiengesellschatt, Ludwigshafen, Germany.<br>
The compound (Ha) is particularly preferred as component B.<br>
If the compounds of the formula (II) are not commercially obtainable, they can be prepared by the methods described in EP-A 0 316 582.<br>
If the compounds of the formula (III) are not commercially obtainable, they can be prepared by methods that are known and familiar to the person skilled in the art, for example via esterification of sebacic esters with 2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidin-4-ol derivatives.<br>
The ratio by weight of components (A) and (B) in the inventive mixtures is generally from 5:1 to 1:5, preferably from 2:1 to 1:2, particularly preferably from 1.2:1 to 1:1.2, and particular preference is given to a mixture whose ratio by weight is about 1:1.<br>
The inventive mixtures can be prepared by processes that are known and familiar to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Component (B) can preferably be added to a melt of component (A), and the mixture can be homogenized, and converted to the desired form, for example pastilles, and allowed to cool.<br>
The invention therefore also provides a respective process for preparation of the inventive mixtures.<br>
I     However, it is also possible to mix solutions of the two components (A) and (B) and then to remove the solvent(s).<br>
The following combinations of compounds of components (A) and (B) are particularly preferred:<br><br>
a)	the combination of the compounds (la) and (lla),<br>
b)	the combination of the compounds (la) and (Ilia),<br>
c)	the combination of the compounds (la) and (lllb).<br>
The combination (a) is particularly preferred.<br>
The inventive mixtures have excellent suitability for use as stabilizers for stabilization of organic material (preferably not of living organic material) with respect to exposure to light, oxygen, and heat. They are added at a concentration of from 0.01 to 5% by weight, preferably from 0.02 to 1% by weight, based on the organic material, to the organic materials to be stabilized, prior to, during, or after their preparation.<br>
The inventive mixture can be added to the organic material to be protected in the form of a prefabricated mixture of components (A) and (B), but another possibility is separate addition of components (A) and (B) to the material to be protected, in which case the mixture is not produced until the components are present within the material to be protected. In the event of separate addition of components (A) and (B), this can take place simultaneously or non-simultaneously, and the sequence here is not generally significant.<br>
Examples of organic material are cosmetic preparations, such as ointments and lotions, pharmaceutical formulations, such as pills and suppositories, photographic recording material, such as photographic emulsions, or precursors for plastics and paints, but in particular plastics and paints themselves.<br>
The invention also provides an organic material stabilized with respect to exposure to light, oxygen, and heat, in particular a plastic or paint, where the material comprises an inventive mixture, preferably at the concentrations given above.<br>
Any of the known apparatus and methods for mixing to incorporate stabilizers or other additives into polymers can be used for mixing of the inventive mixture, particularly with plastics.<br>
The inventive mixture, or the organic material to be stabilized via the mixture, optionally also comprises at least one further light stabilizer and/or other (co)stabilizers. By way of example, suitable light stabilizers and other (co)stabilizers are those selected from the groups a) to s):<br><br>

Examples of suitable antistatic agents are amine derivatives, such as N,N-bis-(hydroxyalkyl)alkylamines or -alkyleneamines, polyethylene glycol esters and polyethylene glycol ethers, ethoxylated carboxylic esters and ethoxylated carboxamides, and glycerolmono- and distearates, and also mixtures of these.<br>
Examples which may be mentioned of plastics which can be stabilized via the inventive mixtures are:<br>
polymers of mono- and diolefins, e.g. low- and high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, linear poly-1-butene, polyisoprene, polybutadiene, and also copolymers of mono- or diolefins, and mixtures of the polymers mentioned;<br>
copolymers of mono- or diolefins with other vinyl monomers, e.g. ethylene-alkyi acrylate copolymers, ethylene-alkyi methacrylate copolymers, ethylene-vinyt acetate copolymers, or ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers;<br>
polystyrene, and also copolymers of styrene or a-methylstyrene with dienes and/or with acrylic derivatives, e.g. styrene-butadiene, styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), styrene-ethyl methacrylate, styrene-butadiene-ethyl acrylate, styrene-acrylonitrile-methacrylate, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), or methyl methacrylate-butadiene-styrene (MBS);<br>
halogenated polymers, e.g. polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl fluoride, polyvinylidene fluoride, and also their copolymers;<br>
polymers which derive from a,p-unsaturated acids and from their derivatives, e.g. polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyacrylamides, and polyacrylonitriles;<br>
polymers which derive from unsaturated alcohols and amines and, respectively, from their acrylic derivatives or acetals, e.g. polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate;<br>
polyurethanes, polyamides, polyureas, polyesters, polycarbonates, polysulfones, polyether sulfones, and polyether ketones.<br>
It is also possible to use the inventive mixtures to stabilize paint coatings, e.g. industrial paints. Among these, the following may be especially highlighted: stoved finishes, and among these in turn vehicle finishes, preferably two-layer finishes. Examples of another application sector are paints for exterior painting of buildings, of other structures, or of<br><br>
industrial apparatus.<br>
The inventive mixtures can be in solid or dissolved form when they are added to the paint. Their good solubility in paint systems is a particular advantage here.<br>
The inventive mixtures are preferably used for stabilization of polyamides, and also of ABS polymers and of SAN polymers, in particular of molding compositions derived therefrom, and of paint coatings.<br>
Another preferred application sector is stabilization of low- and high-density polyethylene, and also of polypropylene and polyamide, including, for example, stabilization of fibers derived therefrom.<br>
The examples provide further illustration of the invention but do not restrict it.<br>
Examples<br>
1.	Preparation of an inventive mixture<br>
500 g of poly{3-(eicosyltetracosyl)-1-[2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yi]pyrrolidine-2,5-dione} (CAS No. 152261-33-1; HALS la) were melted by heating and mixed with the same amount of N,N'-bisformyl-N,N'-bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl)hexa-methylenediamine (CAS No. 124172-53-8; HALS lla). After homogenization, pastilles were formed from the hot mixture and solidified on cooling.<br>
2.	Storage stability of the inventive mixture<br>
In order to test tendency toward caking, poly{3-(eicosyltetracosyl)-1-[2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yI]pyrrolidine-2,5-dione} (CAS No. 152261-33-1; HALS la), and also the mixture prepared in example 1, were stored separately at 40Â°C in plastic bags. The specimens were assessed visually after 20 h.<br><br>
The example shows that even under mild conditions the oligomeric component A has a tendency toward caking. In contrast to this, the inventive mixture does not cake.<br><br>
3. Synergistic action of the mixture when compared with the individual components<br>
3a) Weathering of colored polypropylene (PP) plaques<br>
Red-colored PP plaques with various HALS stabilizers were produced and then weathered to DIN EN ISO 4892-2. Flexural impact resistance was measured to DIN 53453. The results are shown in the table below:<br><br>
*)    HALS     IVa:     Polymer    composed     of    2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-oxa-3,20-diaza-dispiro[5.1.11.2]heneicosan-21-one and epichlorohydrin (CAS No. 202483-55-4); HALS IVb: 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-oxa-3,20-diazadispiro[5.1.11.2]heneicosan-21 -one (CAS No. 64338-16-5).<br>
From the results it can be seen that the amount of the inventive mixture composed of HALS la and HALS I la (serial No. 2) needed is smaller in order to achieve stabilizing action identical with that achieved with the low-molecular-weight HALS compound lla alone (serial No. 1). From the third row it can be seen that other mixtures composed of low- and high-molecular-weight HALS compounds have markedly poorer stabilizing action than the inventive stabilizer mixture.<br>
3b) Stabilization of polypropylene tapes<br>
Stretched (1:5) tapes composed of polypropylene with various stabilizers were produced and weathered to DIN EN ISO 4892-2. The ultimate tensile strength of the specimens was tested at regular intervals. The specimen was regarded as decomposed as soon as residual ultimate tensile strength was smaller than or equal to 50% of the initial ultimate tensile strength.<br><br><br><br>
