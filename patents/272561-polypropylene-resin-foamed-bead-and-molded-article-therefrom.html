POLYPROPYLENE RESIN FOAM PARTICLE AND MOLDED ARTICLE THEREFROM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to polypropylene resin foamed<br>
beads and a polypropylene resin foamed bead molded article obtained<br>
by molding the foamed beads and particularly to polypropylene resin<br>
foamed beads excellent in low-temperature formability and a<br>
polypropylene resin form particle molded article excellent in<br>
external appearance, compression physical properties and heat<br>
resistance obtained from the foamed beads.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
From movement toward plastic material integration in various<br>
industries in recent years, particularly a polypropylene resin is<br>
expanding industrial fields because of its excellence in the balance<br>
among mechanical strength, heat resistance, processability and price<br>
and because of its excellent properties in easy combustibility and<br>
easy recyclability. Similarly, polypropylene resin foamed bead<br>
molded articles obtained by molding of polypropylene resin foamed<br>
beads can be endowed with characteristics such as lightweight-<br>
properties, shock-absorbing characteristics and thermal insulating<br>
properties without losing excellent properties of the polypropylene<br>
resin and are thus widely used as packaging materials, building<br>
materials, insulator materials, automotive materials etc.<br>
 <br>
[0003]<br>
A polypropylene resin foamed bead molded article obtained by<br>
molding polypropylene resin foamed beads is superior to a polystyrene<br>
resin foamed bead molded article in heat resistance, chemical<br>
resistance, rigidity, and compression strain recovery. On the other<br>
hand, when polypropylene resin foamed beads are secondarily foamed<br>
and simultaneously fused in molding, high-temperature heating as<br>
compared with molding of polystyrene resin foamed beads, that is,<br>
heating by steam at high saturation vapor pressure, is necessary.<br>
Accordingly, a mold with high pressure-proof specifications and a<br>
dedicated molding machine for high press pressure are necessary,<br>
and energy costs used therefor is also high.<br>
[0004]<br>
To solve this problem, a method of coating the surfaces of<br>
polypropylene resin foamed beads with low-melting different resins<br>
is also carried out (for example, Patent Document 1) , but the apparatus<br>
used in this coating is complicated and the production process thereof<br>
is also complicated, and the mutual fusion of the. resin particles<br>
in molding is improved, but because the secondary foaming of the<br>
foamed beads is not sufficient, there remains room for improvement<br>
in the external appearance of the molded article, and for the purpose<br>
of improving the secondary foaming property of foamed beads for<br>
solving this problem, there is necessity for a step of giving internal<br>
pressure for significantly increasing the internal pressure of<br>
foamed beads, for molding by in-mold filling at high compression<br>
ratio, or for increase of steam pressure during a molding opposite<br>
to desired objects.<br>
 <br>
[0005]<br>
There is also a method of using a relatively low-melting<br>
polypropylene resin as a base resin, and polypropylene resin foamed<br>
beads using, as a base resin, a polypropylene resin polymerized by<br>
using a metallocene polymerization catalyst are known (for example,<br>
Patent Document 2) . The polypropylene resin polymerized using the<br>
metallocene polymerization catalyst gives a low-melting resin more<br>
easily than with a polypropylene resin polymerized with the<br>
conventional Ziegler-Natta catalyst, but there is still room for<br>
improvement in the effect of reducing the saturation vapor pressure<br>
of steam necessary as a heating medium during a molding, or for<br>
maintaining excellent properties such as mechanical strength and<br>
heat resistance inherent in the polypropylene resin.<br>
[0006]<br>
Non-crosslinked foamed beads using a modified polypropylene<br>
resin as a base resin having [content of a polypropylene<br>
resin] / [content of a polymer composed of a vinyl monomer] at a ratio<br>
of 97 to 65% by weight/3 to 35% by weight, obtained by<br>
graft-polymerizing a polypropylene resin impregnated with a vinyl<br>
monomer are known (for example, Patent Document 3) . The heat<br>
resistance performance of foamed beads using the modified<br>
polypropylene resin particles as the base resin tends to depend on<br>
state transition unique to the high-molecular polymer such as melting<br>
point or glass transition temperature, and by selecting a<br>
polypropylene resin having a low melting point, the saturation vapor<br>
pressure of steam during a molding can be reduced, but there remains<br>
a problem in maintenance of heat resistance.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be solved by the invention<br>
[0008]<br>
The present invention was made in view of these circumstances,<br>
and an object of the present invention is to provide excellent<br>
polypropylene resin foamed beads which can give a polypropylene resin<br>
foamed bead molded article having equivalent properties in molding<br>
at low heating temperature without deteriorating excellent<br>
properties such as compression physical properties and heat<br>
resistance that are characteristics of a polypropylene resin foamed<br>
bead molded article obtained by molding at conventional high heating<br>
temperature.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
polypropylene resin foamed bead molded article having excellent<br>
external appearance, compression physical properties and heat<br>
resistance which is obtainedbymolding the polypropylene resin foamed<br>
beads.<br>
Means to solve the problems<br>
[0009]<br>
The present inventors made extensive study to solve the problem<br>
described above, and as a result, they found that excellent molding<br>
 <br>
of foamed beads is realized at low heating temperature, and<br>
simultaneously the excellent external appearance, compression<br>
physical properties and heat resistance of the resulting foamed bead<br>
molded article can be maintained, by regulating the relationship<br>
between specific physical properties of a resin base material and<br>
compression physical properties of a foamed bead molded article,<br>
the relationship between the crystal structure of foamed beads and<br>
the heat resistance of a foamed bead molded article, the relationship<br>
between the crystal structure of foamed beads or the behavior of<br>
the foamed beads during molding and moldability of foamed beads,<br>
and elucidation of mutual balance of these relationships and by<br>
regulating the crystal structure of foamed beads with a polypropylene<br>
resin as base resin having a specific melting point and flexural<br>

Effect of the Invention<br>
[0011]<br>
The polypropylene resin foamed beads of the present invention<br>
can provide a foamed bead molded article which is excellent in mold<br>
reproducibility and dimensional stability with low molding<br>
temperature (by negating with steam at low saturation vapor pressure)<br>
and excellent in external appearance such as surface smoothness and<br>
in mutual fusion of foamed beads, and a foamed bead molded article<br>
obtained by molding the foamed beads of the present invention, even<br>
in respect of the excellent compression physical property, rigidity<br>
and heat resistance inherent in the polypropylene resin foamed bead<br>

of the invention and its molded article are also excellent in easy<br>
combustibility and easy recyclability.<br>
[0012]<br>

enable molding at low molding temperature, thereby enabling<br>
significant reduction in energy cost during forming as compared with<br>
the conventional molding of polypropylene resin foamed beads and<br>
simultaneously enabling use of steam at low saturation vapor pressure<br>
during molding, and thus the clamping pressure of a molding machine<br>
can be reduced and the thickness of a mold can be made thin so that<br>
 <br>
the molding machine and the mold can be designed at low pressure,<br>
and therefore, inexpensive design is feasible in molding facilities,<br>
and existing facilities for molding of polystyrene resin foamed beads<br>
are usable for polypropylene resin foamed beads.<br>

Best Most for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0015]<br>
The polypropylene resin foamed beads of the present invention<br>
 <br>
are polypropylene resin foamed beads enabling molding at a lowmolding<br>
temperature equal to energy consumption required in molding of a<br>
polystyrene resin foamed bead molded article, and a foamed bead molded<br>
article obtained from the polypropylene resin foamed beads does not<br>
deteriorate excellent properties such as mechanical strength and<br>
thermal resistance that are characteristics of a foamed bead molded<br>
article obtained from conventionally widely used polypropylene resin<br>
foamed beads.<br>
[0016]<br>
To realize molding of polypropylene resin foamed beads<br>
comparable to energy consumption required for molding of polystyrene<br>
resin foamed beads, the maximum saturated vapor pressure of steam<br>
flowing into a mold when foamed beads are formed in a mold by molding<br>
should be 0.18 MPa (G) or less, more preferably G.15 MPa (G) or less<br>
which is preferable for obtaining a polystyrene resin foamed bead<br>
molded article. In the present invention, therefore, a low-melting<br>
polypropylene resin is used as a base resin.<br>
[0017]<br>
In known art, on the other hand, there is a technique of producing<br>
a non-crosslinked polypropylene resin foamed bead molded article<br>
by using foamed beads forming crystals fusing in a temperature range<br>
not lower than the melting point by isothermal crystallization of<br>
the polypropylene resin during production of non-crosslinked<br>
polypropylene resin foamed beads.<br>
The presence of crystals fusing in a temperature range not<br>
lower than the resin melting point can be confirmed as a<br>
high-temperature peak in a DSC curve by differential scanning<br>
 <br>
calorimetry of the foamed beads. The object of formation of<br>
high-temperature peak was significant due to prevention of an unique<br>
rapid change in viscosity of propylene resin, in molding of foamed<br>
beads by heating with steam, and the result was known to be effective<br>
in expansion of the range of forming heating temperature by steam<br>
during molding, in prevention of the shrinkage of a foamed bead molded<br>
article after forming, and in maintenance of rigidity. However,<br>
the influence on the heat resistance performance of high-temperature<br>
peak is not known.<br>
[0018]<br>
The present inventors found that this high-temperature peak<br>
contributes to maintenance of heat resistance performance and also<br>
found that when the crystal structure of the foamed beads is regulated<br>
such that a high-temperature peak having a peak temperature (i.e.<br>
apex temperature) is located in a temperature range at 130°C or more,<br>
preferably 135°C or more in a DSC curve of the foamed beads, practical<br>
heat resistance performance can be maintained similar to the<br>
conventional polypropylene resin foamed bead molded article.<br>
[0019]<br>
However, even if a high-temperature peak having a peak<br>
temperature (i.e. apex temperature) higher than the melting point<br>
of the base resin and a high-temperature peak not lower than 130°C<br>
is obtained by regulating the crystal structure of foamed beads<br>
obtained from a polypropylene resin having a low melting point of<br>
135°C or less as a base resin, the foamed beads do not become foamed<br>
beads excellent in the secondary foaming property and fusion of foamed<br>
beads by heating with steam at a saturation vapor pressure of 0.18<br>
 <br>
MPa (G) in molding, thus failing to provide an excellent foamed bead<br>
molded article.<br>
[0020]<br>
Hence, the inventors' finding is that foamed beads used in<br>
molding when heated can become firstly mutually fused and then can<br>
become secondarily foamed (hereinafter, the foamed beads having this<br>
property are referred to as fusion preceding foamed beads) , and the<br>
foamed beads are heated, whereby the foamed beads can become<br>
secondarily foamed and then can become mutually fused (hereinafter,<br>
the foamed beads having this property are referred to as secondary<br>
foaming preceding foamed beads) , andin the technique described above,<br>
the fusion preceding foamed beads among both the foamed beads are<br>
more preferable in molding, and consideration of the fusion preceding<br>
foamed beads is particularly important in examining development of<br>
polypropylene resin foamed beads is important in molding of<br>
polypropylene resin foamed beads by heating with steam at a saturation<br>
vapor pressure of 0.18 MPa (G) or less, which overthrows the past<br>
common knowledge of molding of polypropylene resin foamed beads.<br>
[0021]<br>
That is, when the molding of polypropylene resin foamed beads<br>
necessitating heating with steam at higher saturation vapor pressure<br>
than in the molding of polystyrene resin foamed bead molded article<br>
is made equal to energy consumption required for forming of<br>
polystyrene resin foamed beads, it was necessary that the efficient<br>
consumption of steam in heating with steam at lower saturation vapor<br>
pressure than conventional, and therefore, it has been necessary<br>
that the foamed beads be fusion preceding foamed beads and have<br>
 <br>
properties by which mutual fusion and secondary foaming occur in<br>
a near heating temperature range.<br>
The reason that the fusion preceding foamed beads are more<br>
preferable is that in the case of the secondary foaming preceding<br>
particles, the spaces among foamed beads filled in mold by secondary<br>
foaming of the foamed beads are easily clogged in a heating step<br>
during the molding, thus preventing inflow and passage of steam to<br>
the spaces among the foamed beads, resulting in causing inhibition<br>
of mutual fusion of the foamed beads, while the fusion preceding<br>
foamed beads hardly cause such a thing. The reason that the mutual<br>
fusion and secondary foaming of the foamed beads are preferably in<br>
a near heating temperature range is that simply the fusion preceding<br>
foamed beads are fused, but when the initiation temperature of<br>
secondary foaming is too significantly higher than the fusion<br>
temperature, the heating temperature at the time of molding should<br>
be inevitably increased in order to obtain the foamed bead molded<br>
article having an excellent appearance etc.<br>
[0022]<br>
To obtain the fusionpreceding foamedbeads having mutual fusion<br>
of the foamedbeads and secondary foaming in a near heating temperature<br>
range, it is important that the high-temperature peak calorie<br>
governing the secondary foam performing of the foamed beads under<br>
predetermined heating that is a major factor directly governing the<br>
molding be made appropriated, the adhesion amount of a dispersant<br>
be made suitable on the surface of the foamed bead for fusion of<br>
individual foamed beads at a specific temperature, and these be<br>
balanced.<br>
 <br>
[0023]<br>
Accordingly, in molding by heating with steam at a saturation<br>
steam pressure of 0.18 MPa (G) , polypropylene resin foamed beads<br>
giving foamed bead molded article that is superior in secondary<br>
foaming property and fusion property and excellent in heat resistance<br>
and external appearance can be obtained by optimizing the plurality<br>
of predominant factors described above.<br>
[0024]<br>
Polypropylene resin foamed beads conferred with molding<br>
processability at low heating temperature by optimizing the<br>
predominant factors described above were successfully obtained, but<br>
the physical properties such as compression strength characteristics<br>
of the conventional propylene resin foamed bead molded article were<br>
sometimes not maintained. The present inventors solved the problem<br>
of physical properties such as compression strength etc. by using<br>
a base resin having an Olsen flexural modulus of 500 MPa or more,<br>
even if the melting point is 135°C or less.<br>
[0025]<br>
That is, the polypropylene resin foamed beads of the present<br>
invention comprise a polypropylene resin having a melting point of<br>
115 to 135°C and an Olsen flexural modulus of 500 MPa or more, wherein<br>
the amount of ash on the surfaces of the foamed beads is 3,000 ppm<br>
by weight or less (including 0), the foamed beads show one or more<br>
endothermic peaks (Pa) having a peak temperature (i.e. apex<br>
temperature) in a temperature region not higher than the melting<br>
point of the resin and one or more endothermic peaks (Pb) having<br>
a peak temperature (i.e. apex temperature) in a temperature region<br>
 <br>
exceeding the melting point of the resin and not lower than 130°C,<br>
in a first DSC curve obtained by a differential scanning calorimeter<br>
of the foamed bead, particularly in a first DSC curve obtained by<br>
heating 1 to 3 mg of polypropylene resin foamed beads when heated<br>
from room temperature to 200°C at a temperature elevation rate of<br>
10°C/min with a heat flux differential scanning calorimeter, and<br>
the total calorie of the endothermic peak (Pb) is in the range of<br>
2 to 12 J/g.<br>
[0026]<br>
The polypropylene resin used in the present invention refers<br>
to a propylene polymer having a weight-average molecular weight of<br>
10000 or more polymerized from propylene monomers as main raw<br>
materials. The base resin of foamed beads may be a crosslinked<br>
polypropylene resin or a non-crosslinked polypropylene resin,<br>
preferably a non-crosslinked propylene resin, and may be a propylene<br>
homopolymer, a propylene block copolymer or a propylene random<br>
copolymer as long as it has a melting point of 115 to 135°C and an<br>
Olsen flexural modulus of 500 MPa or more. For obtaining a<br>
polypropylene resin having a melting point of 115 to 135°C, a propylene<br>
random copolymer is preferable. The propylene random copolymer<br>
consists of a copolymer of a propylene and an ethylene and/or an<br>
a-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms, and the copolymerization<br>
comonomer with propylene is exemplified specifically by ethylene,<br>
1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, and 4-methyl-l-butene.<br>
The propylene random copolymer may be a binary copolymer such as<br>
a propylene-ethylene random copolymer, a propylene-butene random<br>
copolymer, or a ternary copolymer such as a propylene-ethylene-butene<br>
 <br>
random copolymer. The ratio of comonomer components other than<br>
propylene in the copolymer is not particularly limited and is in<br>
such a range that the polypropylene resin after polymerization is<br>
handled as a crystalline resin forming substantial crystals.<br>
[0027]<br>
The polymerization catalyst used in polymerizing the<br>
polypropylene resin used in the present invention is not particularly<br>
limited, and an organometal complex having performance as a<br>
polymerization catalyst can be used. Use can be made of<br>
polymerization catalysts generally called Ziegler-Natta catalysts<br>
that are organometallic complexes modified partially or wholly with<br>
an alkyl group having a nuclear element such as titanium, aluminum<br>
or magnesium, organometallic simple complexes called metallocene<br>
or homogeneous catalysts that are modified with a cyclopentane ring<br>
having, a nuclear element, boron or a transition metal such as<br>
zirconium, titanium, thorium, ruthenium, lanthanum or iron, or<br>
combinations of the organometallic complex and methyl alumoxan. For<br>
obtaining polypropylene resins having a high Olsen flexural modulus<br>
and a low melting point, metallocene catalysts are preferable, and<br>
among the metallocene catalysts, those composed of complexes having<br>
a silylene crosslinked azurenyl ligand are particularly preferable.<br>
[0028]<br>
The polypropylene resin which among the polypropylene resins<br>
used in the present invention, is polymerized with a metallocene<br>
catalyst can also uses as a base resin for producing foamed beads,<br>
a polypropylene resin in which a monomer hardly polymerized with<br>
the conventional Ziegler-Natta catalyst is used in copolymerization<br>
 <br>
with propylene. Examples of such monomers can include, for example,<br>
one or more compounds selected from cyclic olefins such as<br>
cyclopentene,	norbornene,<br>
1,4,5, 8-dimethano-1,2,3,4, 4a, 8, 8a, 6-octahydronaphthalene,<br>
nonconjugated dienes such as 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene and<br>
7-methyl-6-octadiene, and aromatic unsaturated compounds such as<br>
styrene and divinyl benzene.<br>
[0029]<br>
The polypropylene copolymer in the present invention is a<br>
polypropylene resin containing 70% by mole or more, preferably 80<br>
to 99% by mole, of a structural unit derived from propylene in the<br>
copolymer and 30% by mole or less, preferably 1 to 20% by mole, of<br>
a structural unit derived from an ethylene and/or an α-olefin having<br>
4 to 20 carbon atoms. When the content of the structural unit derived<br>
from ethylene and/or an α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms in the<br>
copolymer is too high, the mechanical physical properties such as<br>
flexural strength and tensile strength of the base resin are<br>
significantly decreased, thus failing to provide a resin having an<br>
Olsen flexural modulus of 500 MPa or more, and thus foamed beads<br>
and a foamed bead molded article achieving the desired object cannot<br>
be obtained.<br>
[0030]<br>
Not higher than 50 partsby weight of resins different inmelting<br>
point or different in monomer components, whether they are crystal<br>
or amorphous, may be added to 100 parts by weight not only of a<br>
polypropylene resin polymerized with the metallocene catalyst but<br>
also of the polypropylene resin used in the present invention. The<br>
 <br>
resin that can be added includes a propylene homopolymer, a random<br>
copolymer or a block copolymer having ethylene and/or α-olefins such<br>
as butene, hexene and octene copolymerized with propylene, and a<br>
homopolymer or a copolymer having a molecular weight of 1000 or more<br>
containing one or more monomers selected from the group consisting<br>
of styrene, ethylene, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylonitrile,<br>
butadiene, butene, 4-methyl-pentene-1, bisphenolA, ethylene glycol,<br>
propylene glycol, terephthalic acid and naphthalene.<br>
[0031]<br>
As described above, the polypropylene resin used in the present<br>
invention is a single product or a composite composition and has<br>
a melting point of 115 to 135°C and an Olsen flexural modulus of<br>
500 MPa or more.<br>
[0032]<br>
In the present invention, the melting point of the polypropylene<br>
resin is 135°C or less, whereby the heating temperature in molding<br>
of the foamed beads can be decreased. The fact that the melting<br>
point is 115°C or more, together with the condition of an Olsen flexural<br>
modulus of 500 MPa or more, etc., contributes to stabilization of<br>
curing conditions j ust after molding of foamed beads and to production<br>
of a foamed bead molded article having sufficient mechanical physical<br>
properties. The melting point is preferably 115°C or more and less<br>
than 130°C from the viewpoint of molding of the foamed beads at lower<br>
temperature or preferably 130 to 135°C from the viewpoint of obtaining<br>
the foamed bead molded article having excellent mechanical physical<br>
properties.<br>
[0033]<br>
 <br>
The melting point of the polypropylene resin in the present<br>
invention is a value determined by a method described in JIS K7121-1987.<br>
"Method of determining melting temperature after regulation of the<br>
state of a test specimen" described in the JIS K7121-1987 is used<br>
as a detailed established condition for measuring the melting point.<br>
In the DSC curve obtained by melting point measurement with<br>
a heat flux differential scanning calorimeter, one or more endo thermic<br>
peaks appear due to crystal fusion. When one endothermic peak appears,<br>
the peak temperature of its endothermic peak is estimated as a melting<br>
point, while when two or more endothermic peaks appear, the calories<br>
of the respective endothermic peaks are determined by a partial area<br>
analysis method described later, and the peak temperature of the<br>
endothermic peak appearing at the highest temperature side among<br>
the endothermic peaks having an endothermic peak of 4 J/g or more<br>
is estimated as res in melting point Tm (see FIG. 1) . As a test specimen<br>
for the resin melting point measurement, foamed beads or a foamed<br>
bead molded article specimen can be used besides the polypropylene<br>
resin.<br>
[0034]<br>
The partial area analysis method will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 2. The point a corresponding to 80°C on the DSC<br>
curve obtained by the resin melting point measurement, and the point<br>
β on the DSC curve, corresponding to the fusion termination<br>
temperature Te of the resin, are connected to form a linear line<br>
(α - β) . Then, the point γ1 on the valley on the DSC curve between<br>
the peak a1 observed in the lowest temperature region on the DSC<br>
curve and the peak a2 adjacent to the peak a1 is connected to form<br>
 <br>
a linear line parallel to a longitudinal axis of the graph, to determine<br>
δ1 as a point intersecting with the linear line (α - β) . Further,<br>
the peak a3 adjacent to the peak a2 is observed, and thus the point<br>
γ2 on the valley on the DSC curve between the peak a2 and the peak<br>
a3 is connected to form a linear line parallel to a longitudinal<br>
axis of the graph, to determine δ2 as a point intersecting with the<br>
linear line (α - β) . Thereafter, when peaks a4, peaks a5, peaks a6<br>
...are observed, the same operation is repeated. By the above operation,<br>
the obtained line segment (δn - γn) (n is an integer of 1 or more)<br>
becomes each peak border line for determining an endothermic peak<br>
area. Hence, in the area of each peak corresponding to the calorie<br>
of an endothermic peak, peak a1 is an area enclosed by the DSC curve<br>
indicative of peak a1, the line segment (δ1 - γ1) and the line segment<br>
(α - δ1) , the peak a2 is an area enclosed by the DSC curve indicative<br>
of the peak a2r the line segment (δ1 - γ1) , the line segment (δ2 -<br>
γ2) and the line segment (δ1 - γ2) , and the peak a3 is determined as<br>
an area enclosed by the DSC curve indicative of the peak a3, the<br>
line segment (δ2 - γ2) and the line segment (δ2 - β) . Thereafter,<br>
when peak a4, peak a5, peak a6 ... are also observed, the peak area<br>
can be determined in the same manner. The calorie of each peak is<br>
mechanically calculated with a heat flux differential scanning<br>
calorimeter on the basis of the area of each peak determined as<br>
described above. The reason that the point α on the DSC curve is<br>
a point corresponding to the temperature of 80°C in the measurement<br>
method described above to draw the linear line (α-β) as a baseline<br>
is due to the inventors' finding wherein a baseline initiated at<br>
a point corresponding to 80°C and terminated at a point corresponding<br>
 <br>
to the fusion termination temperature is preferable in determining<br>
the calorie of an endothermic peak stably with good reproducibility.<br>
[0035]<br>
In the present invention, the Olsen flexural modulus of the<br>
polypropylene resin is 500 MPa or more and can thereby exhibit<br>
mechanical strength equivalent to the conventional polypropylene<br>
resin foamed bead molded article. From the viewpoint of obtaining<br>
the foamed bead molded article having particularly excellent<br>
mechanical strength, the Olsen flexural modulus is preferably 600<br>
MPa or more, more preferably 700 MPa or more, and its upper limit<br>
is approximately 2500 MPa.<br>
[0036]<br>
Generally, the foamed bead molded article may shrink and deform<br>
just after molding because the inside of cells constituting the foamed<br>
bead molded article tends to be depressurized after forming with<br>
steam. Usually, for the purpose of drying condensation water derived<br>
from steam incorporated into foamed bead molded article and of<br>
permeation enhancement of air for returning the pressure in cell<br>
of the foamed bead molded article to atmospheric pressure, there<br>
is provided a step of heating and curing or post-curing to maintain<br>
the foamed bead molded article under condition of temperature at<br>
60°C or more and the atmospheric atmosphere conditions. This<br>
shrinkage and deformation of the foamed bead molded article occurs<br>
not only the steam forming pressure at molding for obtaining the<br>
foamed bead molded article is high but also at the steam heating<br>
at a saturation vapor pressure of 0.18 MPa (G) or less. Under such<br>
circumstances, when the Olsen flexural modulus is high relative to<br>
 <br>
the steam forming pressure at the time of molding having positive<br>
correlation with the resin melting point of the base resin, the<br>
shrinkage deformation of just after forming due to rigidity of the<br>
resin tends to be small, and thus the effect of reduction of curing<br>
temperature and curing time can be achieved by using the polypropylene<br>
resin satisfying the relationship of the formula (2).<br>
[0037]<br>
(Olsen flexural modulus [MPa] + 1400)/15 ≥ resin melting point [°C]<br>
(2)<br>
[0038]<br>
When the Olsen flexural modulus is extremely high as compared<br>
with the resin melting point, the fusion preceding foamed beads easily<br>
occur and are preferable, but the expansion ratio in production of<br>
the foamed beads is hardly improved, and the steam pressure necessary<br>
for secondary foaming tends to be extremely high as compared with<br>
steam pressure necessary for fusion of the foamed beads at the time<br>
of molding. Accordingly, when foamed beads having an expansion ratio<br>
of 15 times or more are to be obtained or when the molding property<br>
of the foamed beads is considered, the polypropylene resin satisfying<br>
the following formula (3) is preferably used.<br>
[0039]<br>
(Olsen flexural modulus [MPa] + 1750) /20 ≤ resin melting point [°C]<br>
(3)<br>
[0040]<br>
Accordingly, from the viewpoint of reducing heating curing<br>
conditions and of improving molding property, the polypropylene resin<br>
satisfying the relationship of the formula (1) is preferably used.<br>
 <br>
[0041]<br>
(Olsen flexural modulus [MPa] + 1400) /15 ≥ resin melting point [°C]<br>
≥ (Olsen flexural modulus [MPa] + 1750)/20 (1)<br>
[0042]<br>
The Olsen flexural modulus of the polypropylene resin of the<br>
present invention is a flexural modulus determined on the basis of<br>
JIS K7106-1995. A test specimen used in the above measurement is<br>
a plate punched out with dimensions of 80 mm in length, 15 mm in<br>
width and 2.0 mm in thickness as described in JIS K7106-1995 from<br>
a plate produced by hot press from a polypropylene resin raw material.<br>
When the foamed beads or the foamed bead molded article are formed<br>
into a test specimen, the sample is defoamed sufficiently by hot<br>
press several times, cut tobe diced, and then formed into test specimen<br>
as described above . In the test conditions in the above measurement,<br>
the bending moment is 6 kg.cm, and the support distance is 30 mm.<br>
[0043]<br>
The important properties of the polypropylene resin that is<br>
a base resin of foamed beads are the resin melting point and Olsen<br>
flexural modulus as described above, and when the polypropylene resin<br>
using a base resin having a high melt flow rate (hereinafter, referred<br>
to as MFR) is used, an effect of reducing the steam pressure necessary<br>
for secondary foaming of foamed beads in molding of foamed beads<br>
is recognized, and thus the MFR value is preferably 5.(g/10 min)<br>
or more, more preferably 10 (g/10 min) or more. On the other hand,<br>
when the MFR value is too high, the resulting foamed bead molded<br>
article may become brittle, and thus the MFR value is preferably<br>
60 (g/10 min) or less, preferably 40 (g/10 min) or less. The melt<br>
 <br>
f,low rate is a value measured under test conditions M (temperature<br>
230°C, load 2.16 kg) in JIS K7210-1999.<br>
[0044]<br>
The amount of ash on the surface of the polypropylene resin<br>
foamed beads of the present invention should be 3000 ppm by weight<br>
or less relative to the weight of the foamed beads. The amount is<br>
preferably 2000 ppm by weight or less, still more preferably 1000<br>
ppm by weight or less. The amount is theoretically most preferably<br>
0 ppm, but when 0 ppm is obtained, the surface of the foamed bead<br>
should be sufficiently washed, and realistically such washing is<br>
difficult in manufacturing. In manufacturing, it is difficult to<br>
prevent foreign substances from adsorbing or adhering to foamed beads<br>
in air or a dispersing medium, and use of a dispersing medium is<br>
inevitable, and thus the amount of ash is preferably substantially<br>
as low as possible, and the amount of ash is suitably regulated in<br>
the range described above.<br>
[0045]<br>
The ash in the present invention means a combustion residual<br>
substance detected in a combustion residual test of foamed beads<br>
described below on a melting pot. The ash on the surfaces of the<br>
foamed beads is a substance derived from an inorganic matter adhering<br>
to the surfaces of the foamed beads. Accordingly, the ash is<br>
considered as a derivative of the dispersant used in production of<br>
foamed beads, and is considered as a combustion derivative of an<br>
alumino silica complex salt such as kaolin or as tricalcium phosphate .<br>
The amount of the ash on the surfaces of foamed beads is a value<br>
obtained as the amount of the combustion residual substance in the<br>
 <br>
combustion residual test of the foamed beads described later in a<br>
melting pot and is correlated to be positive with the amount of the<br>
inorganic matter adhering to the surfaces of the foamed beads.<br>
When the amount of the ash is 3000 ppm by weight or more, the<br>
amount of the inorganic matter adhering to the surfaces of the foamed<br>
beads is so large that a large amount of inorganic matter prevents<br>
foamed beads from being fused in molding of the foamed beads by heating<br>
with steam at the objective saturation vapor pressure of 0.18 MPa<br>
(G) or less, and thus even if the fusion preceding foamed beads are<br>
used in molding, an excellent foamed bead molded article cannot be<br>
obtained.<br>
[0046]<br>
The method wherein the amount of the ash is reduced to 3000<br>
ppm by weight or less is correlated to a dispersant introduced together<br>
with the resin particles into a dispersing medium during production<br>
of the foamed beads. As the method of producing the polypropylene<br>
resin foamed beads, a method of obtaining foamed beads by heating<br>
the polypropylene resin particles, plasticizing the particles by<br>
impregnating them with a foaming agent, and releasing the resin<br>
particles in a plasticized state from a closed container to a<br>
low-pressure atmosphere to give foamed beads is generally known.<br>
Then, it is the dispersant that plays the role of maintaining the<br>
resin particles in a plasticized state in the closed container,<br>
releasing and foaming the resinparticles in a low-pressure atmosphere,<br>
and preventing mutual adhesion between the resin particles or foamed<br>
beads in these states.<br>
[0047]<br>
 <br>
For example, when an inorganic gas is used as a foaming agent,<br>
the foamed beads of the present invention are prepared at a foaming<br>
temperature of approximately 120 to 14 0°C, for convenience of<br>
production of the foamed beads with polypropylene resin particles<br>
having a melting point of 115 to 135°C as a raw material. On the<br>
other hand, the desired object of the present invention is that when<br>
the foamed bead molded article is obtained from foamed beads obtained<br>
from polypropylene resin particles having a melting point of 115<br>
to 135°C by molding, the molding at the heating forming temperature<br>
a-t a steam pressure at approximately 130°C or less, that is, by heating<br>
with steam at a saturation vapor pressure of 0.18 MPa (G) or less<br>
is possible. Accordingly, the foamed beads used should be fusion<br>
preceding foamed beads. However, the fusion preceding foamed beads<br>
easily cause mutual adhesion of the particles, and under such<br>
conditions, the amount of the dispersant added to the dispersing<br>
medium at the time of production of the foamed beads should be twice<br>
or more than usual in order to prevent the mutual adhesion of the<br>
particles . The amount of the inorganic matt er adhering to the surface<br>
of the foamed beads obtained with a larger amount of the dispersant<br>
is higher than 3000 ppm by weight when the amount of the ash is measured.<br>
[0048]<br>
However, a surfactant together with a dispersant is added to<br>
a dispersion medium, the ratio of the surfactant to the dispersant<br>
is regulated, the resin particles are released in a low-pressure<br>
atmosphere, and the atmosphere temperature for obtaining the foamed<br>
beads is regulated at 100°C or less and made not higher than the<br>
crystallization temperature of the resin, whereby the amount of the<br>
 <br>
dispersant added can be reduced, and the amount of ash on the surfaces<br>
of polypropylene resin foamed beads can be regulated to be 3000 ppm<br>
by weight or less. Specifically, the amount of the dispersant added<br>
to the dispersion medium in production of the foamed beads is<br>
preferably 20 or more, more preferably 300 or more, in terms of the<br>
weight ratio determined as the weight of the resin particles/weight<br>
of the dispersant. The upper limit of the weight ratio is<br>
approximately 1000. The ratio of the dispersant to the surfactant<br>
is preferably 45 or less, more preferably 30 or less, in terms of<br>
the weight ratio as determined as the weight of the dispersant/weight<br>
of the surfactant. The lower limit of the weight ratio is<br>
approximately 1.5.<br>
[0049]<br>
The dispersant includes aluminum oxide, titanium oxide,<br>
aluminum hydroxide, tribasic calcium phosphate, magnesium<br>
pyrophosphate, zinc oxide, kaolin, talc, and mica. The surfactant<br>
includes anionic surfactants such as sodium dodecy lbenzenesul fonate<br>
and sodium oleate.<br>
[0050]<br>
The foamed beads of the present invention are not limited to<br>
the foamed beads obtained by the method of using a dispersant and<br>
a surfactant at a specific ratio, and the amount of ash on the surfaces<br>
of the final foamed beads may be 3000 ppm by weight or less. For<br>
example, foamed beads are produced by a method wherein the amount<br>
of the dispersant added is increased and preventing mutual adhesion<br>
of the resin particles and foamed beads, and even if the amount of<br>
ash on the surfaces of the foamed beads is higher than 3000 ppm by<br>
 <br>
weight, the surfaces of the foamed beads are washed in a later step<br>
thereby removing a large amount of adhering inorganic matter, whereby<br>
foamed beads wherein the amount of ash on the surfaces of the foamed<br>
beads is 3000 ppm by weight or less can be obtained.<br>
[0051]<br>
The amount of the inorganic matter adhering to the surfaces<br>
of foamed beads in the present invention can be determined to be<br>
high or low by quantifying the amount of ash in a combustion residue<br>
test of foamed beads in a crucible. In the combustion residue test<br>
for quantifying the ash, the amount of combustion residues derived<br>
from inorganic matter adhering to the surfaces of the foamed beads<br>
should be distinguished from the combustion residues of the whole<br>
foamed beads containing combustion residues derived from inorganic<br>
matter kneaded in foamed beads and the amount of combustion residues<br>
derived from inorganic matter adhering to the surfaces of the foamed<br>
beads by a procedure described below. First, in the combustion<br>
residue test, a crucible having a constant weight is precisely weighed,<br>
foamed beads which are precisely weighed are placed in the crucible,<br>
placed in a heating furnace and kept at a furnace temperature of<br>
950°C for 15 minutes, thereby removing an organic matter including<br>
a polypropylene resin by combustion or thermolysis, and the combustion<br>
residue becoming a constant weight is obtained, the weight of the<br>
melting pot containing the combustion residue having a constant weight<br>
is precisely weighed, and from its difference from the weight of<br>
the previously constant weighed crucible, the weight of the combustion<br>
residue is determined.<br>
[0052]<br>
 <br>
Then, the parts per million (A) ppm by weight of the weight<br>
of the combustion residue based on the weight of the foamed beads<br>
placed in the crucible is calculated. As the combustion residue,<br>
the inorganic matter remaining in the crucible is the combustion<br>
residues as the whole foamed beads containing combustion residues<br>
derived from inorganic matter kneaded in foamed beads and combustion<br>
residues derived from inorganic matter adhering to the surfaces of<br>
the foamed beads. To determine the amount of the combustion residue<br>
derived from the inorganic matter adhering to the surfaces of the<br>
foamed beads, the weight of the combustion residue derived from the<br>
inorganic matter kneaded in the foamed beads should be subtracted<br>
from the weight of the combustion residue of the whole foamed beads.<br>
Accordingly, foamed beads prepared from the same foamed bead group<br>
as the previously used foamed beads are prepared, and the surfaces<br>
of the foamed beads are scraped off to give only foam layers inside<br>
the foamed beads, and then the precisely weighed foam layers inside<br>
the foamed beads are placed in a crucible and subjected to the same<br>
procedure as in the combustion residue test described above, to<br>
determine the weight of the combustion residue derived from the<br>
inorganic matter kneaded in the foamed beads. Then, the parts per<br>
million (B) ppm by weight of the weight of the combustion residue<br>
based on the weight of the foam layers inside the foamed beads placed<br>
in the crucible is calculated. The amount of ash on the surfaces<br>
of the foamed beads can be determined by subtracting the weight (B)<br>
(ppm) from the weight (A) (ppm) determined in this manner . The method<br>
of scraping off the surfaces of the foamed beads to obtain the foam<br>
layers inside the foamed beads is an operation of cutting all the<br>
 <br>
surfaces of the foamed beads using a cutter knife or the like, and<br>
the thickness of the surface cut shall be approximately 200 urn.<br>
[0053]<br>
In the foamed beads of the present invention, the ratio of<br>
expansion before and after heating with steam at a saturation vapor<br>
pressure of 0.15 MPa (G) serves as an indicator showing whether the<br>
requirement of secondary foaming property as one necessary condition<br>
to enable forming at low molding temperature is satisfied.<br>
Specifically, the ratio of expansion is preferably 1.5 or more in<br>
order that sufficient secondary foaming property is exhibited with<br>
molding by heating with steam at a saturation vapor pressure of 0.18<br>
MPa (G) . The value of expansion ratio is a value obtained by dividing<br>
900 g/L standard density of the polypropylene resin by the apparent<br>
density (g/L) of the foamed beads.<br>
[0054]<br>
The foamed beads of the present invention, as described in<br>
the fusion preceding foamed beads and the secondary foaming preceding<br>
foamed beads, should be regulated to control the secondary foaming<br>
property of the foamed beads and also to adjust the fusion of the<br>
foamed beads to timing for manifestation of the secondary foaming<br>
property of the foamed beads to realize molding of the foamed beads<br>
by heating with steam at low saturation vapor pressure. Accordingly,<br>
the ratio of expansion of the foamed beads before and after heating<br>
with steam at a saturation vapor pressure of 0.15 MPa (G) is preferably<br>
1.5 or more.<br>
[0055]<br>
In this specification, the ratio of expansion of the foamed<br>
 <br>
beads before and after heating with steam at a saturation vapor<br>
pressure of 0.15 MPa (G) is determined by dividing the expansion<br>
ratio of the foamed beads after heating with steam at a saturation<br>
vapor pressure of 0.15 MPa (G) , by the expansion ratio of the foamed<br>
beads actually used in measurement, and the expansion ratio of the<br>
foamed beads after heating can be determined in the following manner.<br>
In nmeasurement of the expansion ratio of the foamed beads after heating<br>
with steam at a saturation vapor pressure of 0.15 MPa (G) , 10 g of<br>
the foamed beads are placed in a 3 to 5 L closed container such as<br>
an autoclave, and steam at a saturation vapor pressure of 0.15 MPa<br>
(G) is introduced; this test is carried out plural times while the<br>
time of introduction of steam is changed, thereby measuring the<br>
apparent density of the obtained foamed beads obtained in each test,<br>
to obtain a curve graph showing the relationship between the apparent<br>
density of foamed beads and the time of introduction of steam. From<br>
the obtained curve on the graph, the minimum apparent density of<br>
the foamed beads is read out, and 900 g/L is divided by the minimum<br>
apparent density (g/L) of the foamed beads and thereby determined<br>
as the expansion ratio of the foamed beads after heating.<br>
[0056]<br>
In order that the foamed beads can satisfy the ratio of expansion<br>
to be 1. 5 or more before and after heating with steam at a saturation<br>
vapor pressure of 0.15 MPa (G) , it is important that one or more <br>
endothermic peak (hereinafter referred to as high-temperature peak)<br>
having a peak temperature (i.e. apex temperature) higher than the<br>
melting point and in a temperature region not lower than 130°C appears<br>
on a first DSC curve obtained by heat flux differential scanning<br>
 <br>
calorimetry of the foamed bead, and the calorie of the<br>
high-temperature peak be 2 to 12 J/g. When two or more<br>
high-temperature peaks appear, the calories of the high-temperature<br>
peaks mean that the total calorie of total high-temperate peaks is<br>
2 to 12 J/g. The high-temperature peak is derived from polypropylene<br>
resin crystals which out of the polypropylene resin crystals capable<br>
of occurring in the foamed beads, can be formed by the isothermal<br>
crystallization operation. When the calorie of the high-temperature<br>
peak is less than 2 J/g, shrinkage generated in the foamed bead molded<br>
article is hardly recovered even if curing at high temperature is<br>
performed after molding, and the compression strength, energy<br>
absorption efficiency etc. of the resulting foamed beadmolded article<br>
are reduced. On the other hand, when the calorie in a high-temperature<br>
peak is higher than 12 J/g, secondary foaming property may become<br>
insufficient during molding by heating with steam at a saturation<br>
vapor pressure of 0.18 MPa (G) or less. The calorie in a<br>
high-temperature peak in the present invention is preferably 4 to<br>
11 J/g, more preferably 5 to 10 J/g, from the viewpoint described<br>
above.<br>
[0057]<br>
The foamed beads of the present invention in the first DSC<br>
curve have the high-temperature peak, and simultaneously there<br>
appears one or more endothermic peak having a peak temperature (i.e.<br>
apex temperature) in a temperature region not higher than the melting<br>
point. The endothermic peak appearing in a temperature region not<br>
higher than the melting point is derived from crystals showing the<br>
melting point of the polypropylene resin that is a base resin, and<br>
 <br>
among endothermic peaks, the peak temperature of the largest peak<br>
area agrees approximately with the melting point of the base resin<br>
and thus serves as an indicator of the melting point of the base<br>
resin.<br>
The total calorie (for example, the calorie corresponding to<br>
the area of peak Pa represented by a white portion in FIG. 3) of<br>
one or more endothermic peaks (hereinafter, referred to as inherent<br>
peaks) having a peak temperature (i.e. apex temperature) in a<br>
temperature region not higher than the melting point measured in<br>
the same manner as in measuring the high-temperature peak calorie<br>
is preferably 30 to 80 J/g, more preferably 40 to 70 J/g, from the<br>
viewpoint of mutual excellent fusion among the foamed beads in<br>
molding.<br>
[0058]<br>
The method of regulating the calorie in a high-temperature<br>
peak in the range described above in the present invention is<br>
preferably a regulation method using isothermal crystallization<br>
during production of foamed beads, from the viewpoint of obtaining<br>
a foamed bead molded article having stable mechanical physical<br>
properties. As a method other than the isothermal crystallization<br>
operation, there is a method of mixing a polypropylene resin having<br>
a melting point of higher than 135°C with a polypropylene resin having<br>
a melting point of 135°C or'less as a polypropylene resin. As a matter<br>
of course, the melting point of the polypropylene resin after being<br>
mixed should be 115 to 135°C.<br>
[0059]<br>
The method of measuring the calorie in a high-temperature peak<br>
 <br>
of the foamed beads in the present invention is as follows: In a<br>
DSC curve obtained by heating 1 to 3 mg of the foamed beads from<br>
room temperature (approximately 25°C) to 200°C at a rate of 10°C/min<br>
with a heat flux differential scanning calorimeter, an endothermic<br>
peak (hereinafter, referred to as inherent peak) Pa derived from<br>
crystals showing the resin melting point of the polypropylene resin<br>
as a base resin and having a peak temperature (i.e. apex temperature)<br>
PTma in a temperature region not higher than the resin melting point<br>
appears, and when one or more endothermic peak Pb being higher than<br>
the resin melting point and having a peak temperature PTmb in a<br>
temperature region not lower than 130°C appears, then the endothermic<br>
peak Pb is a high-temperature peak in the present invention, and<br>
the calorie of the high-temperature peak of the foamed beads<br>
corresponds to the area of the endothermic peak Pb. Accordingly,<br>
the calorie of the high-temperature peak is calculated mechanically<br>
by determining the area of the endothermic peak Pb with a differential<br>
scanning calorimeter. The area of the endothermic peak Pb can be<br>
determined by the following method.<br>
[0060]<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 3, the point a corresponding<br>
to 80°C on the DSC curve, and the point β on the DSC curve corresponding<br>
to the melting termination temperature Te of the foamed beads, are<br>
connected to form a linear line (α - β) . Then, the point γ on the -<br>
valley of the DSC curve, between the inherent peak Pa and the<br>
high-temperature peak Pb, is connected to form a linear line parallel<br>
to a longitudinal axis of the graph, to determine δ as a point<br>
intersecting with the linear line (α - β) . The area of the<br>
 <br>
high-temperature peak Pb is determined as the area of the region<br>
(shaded portion in FIG. 3) enclosed by the DSC curve showing the<br>
high-temperature peak Pb in the DSC curve, the line segment (δ -<br>
β) and the line segment (γ - δ) .<br>
[0061]<br>
The high-temperature peak Pb obtained by the regulation method<br>
using the isothermal crystallization in the present invention appears<br>
in a first DSC curve of the foamed beads measured as described above,<br>
but does not appear in a second DSC curve obtained by decreasing<br>
the temperature from 200°C to once about 40°C at a rate of 10°C/min<br>
and then increasing the temperature to 200°C again at a rate of 10°C/min,<br>
after obtaining the first DSC curve, and in the second DSC curve,<br>
only an endothermic peak derived from crystals showing the melting<br>
point of the base resin similar to the inherent peak Pa appears,<br>
and thus the inherent peak Pa and the high-temperature peak Pb can<br>
be easily distinguished form each other.<br>
The reason that the point a on the DSC curve is a point<br>
corresponding to the temperature of 80°C in the measurement method<br>
described above to draw the linear line (α - β) as a baseline is<br>
that a baseline initiated at a point corresponding to 80°C and<br>
terminated at a point corresponding to the fusion termination<br>
temperature is preferable in determining the calorie of an<br>
high-temperature peak stably with good reproducibility.<br>
[0062]<br>
The average cell diameter of the foamed beads of the present<br>
invention is usually 30 to 500 µm, more preferably 50 to 350 µm.<br>
From the relationship of the strength of the cell film, the foamed<br>
 <br>
bead having an average cell diameter in the range described above<br>
shows excellent foaming property during the secondary foaming or<br>
molding of the foamed beads described later without defoaming the<br>
cell of the foamed beads.<br>
[0063]<br>
The average cell diameter of the foamed beads can be determined<br>
on the basis of an enlarged photomicrograph having an approximately<br>
two divided cell section of foamed beads by the following operation.<br>
In the enlarged photograph of the cell section, 4 linear lines passing<br>
on the surface of the foamed beads to other surface and through the<br>
central parts of the cell section are drawn in 8 directions from<br>
the central parts to the surface of the foamed bead. Then, the total<br>
number (N) of cells intersecting with the 4 linear lines is determined.<br>
Then, the sum total length L (µm) of line segments from the surface<br>
of foamed beads of each of the 4 linear lines to the other surface<br>
is divided by the total number (N) of foamed beads, to determine<br>
(L/N) thereby calculating the average cell diameter of the foamed<br>
beads.<br>
[0064]<br>
The average cell diameter increases depending on the high MFR<br>
of base resin, an increase in foaming temperature, a decrease in<br>
a foaming agent and a reduction in a cell adjusting agent, and thus<br>
the foamed beads having the objective average cell diameter can be<br>
obtained by suitably regulating these factors of change in average<br>
cell diameter.<br>
[0065]<br>
As the average weight of one foamed bead is decreased, molding<br>
 <br>
can be performed advantageously with low heating temperature, but<br>
when the average weight of one foamed bead is too low, foaming<br>
efficiency is deteriorated. Accordingly, the average weight of one<br>
foamed bead is preferably 0.01 to 10.0 mg, more preferably 0.1 to<br>
5.0 mg. The average weight of the foamed beads is regulated by<br>
adjusting the average weight of one resin particle for obtaining<br>
the foamed beads to the average weight of one particle of the intended<br>
foamed bead.<br>
[0066]<br>
The average weight of one resin particle can be regulated by<br>
a conventionally known pelletizing method such as a method wherein<br>
the base resin and other components and additives are melt-kneaded<br>
in an extruder and then the kneaded product is extruded into a string<br>
via a mouth ring having a small hole at the end of the extruder,<br>
and the string is cut into resin particles having a desired size<br>
or weight by a cutting machine having a taker.<br>
[0067]<br>
The foamed beads of the present invention usually have an<br>
apparent density of 10 g/L or more and 500 g/L or less. The upper<br>
limit of the apparent density of the foamed beads of the present<br>
invention is preferably 300 g/L, more preferably 180 g/L, from the<br>
viewpoint of improving the fundamental characteristics of the foam<br>
such as lightweight properties and shock-absorbing characterizes.-<br>
On the other hand, when the apparent density of the foamed beads<br>
is too low, the foam is easily broken, and thus the lower limit of<br>
the apparent density is preferably 12 g/L, more preferably 15 g/L.<br>
[0068]<br>
 <br>
The apparent density of the foamed beads in the present<br>
invention is a value obtained by sinking the foamed bead group with<br>
weight W (g) in a water-containing measuring cylinder using a metal<br>
mesh, then reading the volume V (L) of the foamed bead group from<br>
raising of water level, and dividing the weight of the foamed bead<br>
group by the volume of the foamed bead group (W/V).<br>
[0069]<br>
In production of the foamed beads of the present invention,<br>
for example, a known foaming method can be used wherein propylene<br>
resin particles are dispersed together with a foaming agent in a<br>
dispersion medium such as water in a closed container, then heated<br>
thereby softening the resin particles, simultaneously the resin<br>
particles are impregnated with a foaming agent, and the resin<br>
particles are released from the container into a low-pressure region<br>
(usually into an atmospheric pressure region) at a temperature not<br>
lower than the softening temperature of the resin particles (see<br>
JP-B 49-2183, JP-B 56-1344 and JP-B 62-61227).<br>
Preferably, when the content in a closed container is released<br>
from the closed container to a low-pressure region to obtain foamed<br>
beads, the closed container is back-pressured with the foaming agent<br>
used or an inorganic gas such as nitrogen to prevent the pressure<br>
in the container from rapidly decreasing, so that the content can<br>
be released and the apparent density of the resulting foamed beads<br>
can be unified.<br>
[0070]<br>
The method of regulating the average cell diameter of the foamed<br>
beads is carried out mainly by incorporating 0 . 01 to 5 parts by weight<br>
 <br>
of inorganicmatter suchas talc, aluminum hydroxide, silica, zeolite,<br>
borax, and inorganic powder, as a cell adjusting agent, into 100<br>
parts by weight of the base resin to give resin particles granulated<br>
to obtain the foamed beads with the base resin, but the average cell<br>
diameter changes due to foaming temperature, the type of the foaming<br>
agent and the amount used during the production of the foamed beads,<br>
and thus preliminary experiments should be previously conducted for<br>
establishing conditions before the objective particle having an<br>
average cell diameter is obtained.<br>
[0071]<br>
The foamed beads having a high-temperature peak in the present<br>
invention can be obtained by a forming method, wherein the resin<br>
particles when heated with dispersion in a dispersing medium in a<br>
closed container, the foamed beads are not heated above a melting<br>
termination temperature of the resin particles (hereinafter, also<br>
referred to as Te) and are kept at an optional temperature Ta within<br>
a range from a temperature 15°C below the melting point of the resin<br>
particles (hereinafter, also referred to as Tm) to a temperature<br>
lower than Te for a sufficient time, preferably for 10 to 60 minutes<br>
and then regulated at the optional temperature Tb in the range of<br>
(Tm - 5°C) to (Te + 5°) . The resin particles are released from the<br>
container to a low pressure region at the temperature and thereby<br>
expanded. For forming the high-temperature peak, a temperature kept<br>
between (Tm - 15°C) and Te can be established in multistage in the<br>
temperature range, or the high-temperature peak can be formed by<br>
heating at a slow speed over a sufficiently long time in the temperature<br>
range.<br>
 <br>
[0072]<br>
Formation of the high-temperature peak of foamed beads, and<br>
the degree of calorie of high-temperature peak, depend mainly on<br>
the temperature Ta and the retention time at temperature Ta for the<br>
resin particles in producing the foamed beads and the rate of<br>
temperature rise in the range of (Tm - 15°C) to (Te + 5°C) . The calorie<br>
of the high-temperature peak of the foamed beads tends to be high<br>
when the temperature Ta or Tb is lower in each of the temperature<br>
ranges, when the retention time is longer in the range of (Tm - 15°C)<br>
to Te, and when the rate of temperature rise is lower in the range<br>
of (Tm - 15°C) to Te. The rate of temperature rise used is usually<br>
0.5 to 5°C/min.<br>
The calorie of the high-temperature peak tends to be low when<br>
the temperature Ta or Tb is higher in each of the temperature ranges,<br>
when the retention time is shorter in the range of (Tm - 15°C) to<br>
Te, when the rate of temperature rise is higher in the range of (Tm<br>
- 15°C) to Te, and when the rate of temperature rise is lower in<br>
the range of Te to (Te + 5°C) . When preliminary experiments are carried<br>
out repeatedly in consideration of these features, production<br>
conditions of foamed beads showing the desired high-temperature peak<br>
calorie can be obtained.<br>
The temperature range according to the formation of<br>
high-temperature peak is a suitable temperature range when the<br>
inorganic physical foaming agent is used as a foaming agent.<br>
Accordingly, when the foaming agent is changed to an organic physical<br>
foaming agent, the suitable temperature range is shifted toward a<br>
temperature lower by about 0 to 30°C than the temperature range<br>
 <br>
described above, depending on the type and used amount.<br>
[0073]<br>
As the foaming agent used in producing the foamed beads of<br>
the present invention, organic physical foaming agents, inorganic<br>
physical foaming agents or mixtures thereof can be used. Organic<br>
physical foaming agents include aliphatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
propane, butane, hexane and heptane, alicyclic hydrocarbons such<br>
as cyclobutane and cyclohexane, halogenated hydrocarbons such as<br>
methyl chloride, ethyl chloride and methylene chloride, and dialkyl<br>
ethers such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether and methyl ethyl ether,<br>
and these may be used as a mixture of two or more thereof.<br>
[0074]<br>
An inorganic physical foaming agent includes nitrogen, carbon<br>
dioxide, argon, air, water etc., and these may be used as a mixture<br>
of two or more thereof. When the foamed beads are obtained using<br>
water as a dispersion medium together with the resin particles in<br>
the closed container, the resin particles may be kneaded with a<br>
water-absorbing resin so that water that is a dispersion medium can<br>
be used efficiently as a foaming agent. When an organic physical<br>
foaming agent and an inorganic physical foaming agent are used in<br>
combination, the organic physical foaming agent and the inorganic<br>
physical foaming agent can be arbitrarily selectively combined.<br>
When the organic physical foaming agent and the inorganic physical<br>
foaming agent are combined, the inorganic physical foaming agent<br>
is contained preferably in an amount of at least 30% by weight or<br>
more. Among the foaming agents, the inorganic physical foaming agent<br>
is preferable from the viewpoint of less destruction of the ozone<br>
 <br>
layer and low cost, and particularly nitrogen, air, carbon dioxide<br>
and water are preferable.<br>
[0075]<br>
The amount of the foaming agent used is determined in<br>
consideration of the apparent density of the foaming particles to<br>
be obtained, the type of the base resin, or the type of the foaming<br>
agent, etc., but usually the organic physical foaming agent is used<br>
in an amount of 5 to 50 parts by weight, or the inorganic physical<br>
foaming agent is used in an amount of 0.5 to 30 parts by weight,<br>
per 100 parts by weight of the resin particles.<br>
[0076]<br>
The dispersing medium for dispersing the resin particles in<br>
producing foamed beads is not limited to water described above, and<br>
any solvent that undissolves the resin particles may be used.<br>
Examples of the dispersing medium other than water include ethylene<br>
glycol, glycerin, methanol and ethanol, but usually water is used.<br>
When the resin particles are dispersed in the dispersing medium,<br>
a dispersant may be added if necessary to the dispersing medium.<br>
The dispersant includes finely divided aluminum oxide, titanium oxide,<br>
basic magnesium carbonate, basic zinc carbonate, calcium carbonate,<br>
kaolin, mica, clay etc. The dispersant is used usually in an amount<br>
of 0.2 to 2 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the resin<br>
particles. <br>
[0077]<br>
The resin particles are those composed of a polypropylene resin<br>
as described above, and as long as the desired effect of the invention<br>
is not deteriorated, it is possible to incorporate other polypropylene<br>
 <br>
resins (for example propylene resins having a melting point of higher<br>
than 135°C) , for example, ethylene resins such as high-density<br>
polyethylene, moderate-density polyethylene, low-density<br>
polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene, linear super<br>
low-density polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer,<br>
ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer, ethylene-methacrylic acid<br>
copolymer, or resins such as polystyrene resins such as polystyrene<br>
and styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer.<br>
[0078]<br>
Besides the resins described above, it is possible to add<br>
ethylene-propylene rubber, ethylene-1-butene rubber,<br>
propylene-1-butene rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber and<br>
hydrogenated products thereof, isoprene rubber, neoprene rubber,<br>
nitrile rubber, or elastomers such as styrene-butadiene block<br>
copolymer elastomers, hydrogenated products thereof, and the like.<br>
When resins or elastomers other than the polypropylene resins are<br>
incorporated into polypropylene resins, the total addition amount<br>
of the resins or elastomers other than the polypropylene resins is<br>
preferably 50% by weight or less, more preferably 30% by weight or<br>
less, more preferably 10% by weight or less, based on 100 parts by<br>
weight of the polypropylene resin.<br>
[0079]<br>
Various types of additives may be further added to the resin<br>
particles. Examples of the additives include an antioxidant, a UV<br>
absorber, an antistatic agent, a conductive agent, a flame retardant,<br>
a metal inactivating agent, a pigment, a dye, a crystal nucleating<br>
agent, inorganic filling material and the like. These additives<br>
 <br>
are preferably added in amounts of 25 parts by weight or less per<br>
100 parts by weight of the resin particles, more preferably 20 parts<br>
by weight or less,, even more preferably 5 parts by weight or less.<br>
[0080]<br>
The polypropylene resin foamed beads obtained by releasing<br>
from the close container to a low-pressure region by the method<br>
described above are subjected to a curing step in an atmospheric<br>
pressure usually conducted after releasing, and then placed in the<br>
closed container for pressurizing and pressurized with a pressurizing<br>
gas such as air at 0.01 to 1.00 MPa (G), and the pressure in the<br>
foamed beads is increased at 0.01 to 0.08 MPa (G), preferably at<br>
0.10 to 0.70 MPa (G), and then the foamed beads are removed from<br>
the container and then can be heated with steam or hot air to become<br>
foamed beads having a lower apparent density (this step is referred<br>
to as 2-stage foaming).<br>
[0081]<br>
The foamed bead molded article of the present invention can<br>
be produced if necessary by using a batch molding method wherein<br>
foamed beads are subjected to the same operation of increasing the<br>
pressure in the foamed beads as in the two-stage foaming described<br>
above so that the pressure in the foamed beads is regulated at 0.01<br>
to 0.10 MPa (G) , and then charged into a conventionally known<br>
thermoplastic resin foamed beads molding cavity capable of heating,<br>
cooling, opening, closing and sealing, the foamed beads are heated<br>
and expanded in the mold with steam at a saturation vapor pressure<br>
of 0.06 to 0.18 MPa (G) , preferably 0.10 to 0.16 MPa (G) , the foamed<br>
beads are thereby mutually fused to one another, and then the resulting<br>
 <br>
foamed bead molded article is cooled and removed from the cavity<br>
(for example, a forming method described in JP-B 4-46217 and JP-B<br>
6-4 97 95). The method of heating with steam in the molding method<br>
can use a conventionally known method wherein one-side heating,<br>
reverse one-side heating, and main heating can be suitably combined,<br>
and the heating method is particularly preferably a method wherein<br>
the foamed beads are heated in preliminary heating, one-side heating,<br>
reverse one-side heating, and main heating in this order. The<br>
saturation vapor pressure of 0.06 to 0.18 MPa (G) during the molding<br>
of the foamed beads is the maximum value of the saturation vapor<br>
pressure of steam supplied to a mold during molding step.<br>
[0082]<br>
The foamed bead molded article of the present invention can<br>
also be produced by a continuous molding method wherein the pressure<br>
in the foamed beads is regulated as necessary at 0.01 to 0.10 MPa<br>
(G) and then the foamed beads are fed continuously to the inside<br>
of a mold formed by belts which are continuously carried along the<br>
top and bottom of the passage having a heating region and cooling<br>
region and a steam at a saturation vapor pressure of 0.06 to 0.18<br>
MPa (G) is fed to the inside of the mold when the foamed beads are<br>
passing through the steamheating region, thereby expanding and fusing<br>
the foamed beads among them and then passed through a cooling region<br>
and are cooled, and the obtained foamed bead molded article is removed<br>
from the passage and then cut in a suitable length (for example,<br>
a forming method described in JP-A 9-104026, JP-A 9-104027 and JP-A<br>
10-180888).<br>
[0083]<br>
 <br>
In molding with the polypropylene resin foamed beads of the<br>
present invention, the surfaces of the foamed beads are considered<br>
to be fused first by heating with the steam and then the foamed beads<br>
can be secondarily foamed later thereby forming a foamed bead molded<br>
article excellent in appearance andmutual fusion of the foamed beads .<br>
[0084]<br>
When the foamed bead molded article having an apparent density<br>
of 30 g/L or less is obtained, the molding of conventional<br>
polypropylene resin foamed beads hardly gives an excellent foamed<br>
beadmolded article without using, depending on intended shape, either<br>
a method of molding with foamed beads having high pressure therein<br>
or a method of molding with an increased charged rate in a mold cavity<br>
charged with the foamed beads having an apparent density not higher<br>
than the apparent density of a intended foam molded article, but<br>
the propylene resin foamed beads of the present invention is<br>
characterized in that without such method, an excellent foamed bead<br>
molded article can be obtained.<br>
[0085]<br>
The foamed bead molded article of the present invention thus<br>
produced has an interconnected cell ratio of preferably 40% or less,<br>
more preferably 30% or less, most preferably 25% or less, based on<br>
procedure C in ASTM-D2856-70 . As the interconnected cell of a foamed<br>
bead molded article decreases, the -foamed bead molded article is<br>
made more excellent in mechanical strength. The apparent density<br>
of the foamed bead molded article of the present invention is<br>
preferably 10 to 300 g/L, more preferably 13 to 180 g/L, from the<br>
viewpoint of mechanical strength, shock-absorbing characteristics<br>
 <br>
and lightweight properties. The apparent density (g/L) of the foamed<br>
bead molded article can be determined by dividing the weight (g)<br>
of the foamed bead molded article by the volume (L) determined from<br>
the outside dimension of the foamed bead molded article.<br>

 <br>
Examples in JP-A No. 10-226712.<br>
[0091]<br>
[Chemical Treatment of Silicate]<br>
3 . 75 L distilled water and then 2 . 5 kg (96%) of cone, sulfuric<br>
acid were added slowly to a 10-L glass separable flask equipped with<br>
a stirring blade. 1 kg of montmorillonite (Benclay SL manufactured<br>
by Mizusawa Industrial Chemicals, Ltd.; average particle size : 25<br>
µm, particle size distribution : 10 µm to 60 µm was dispersed at<br>

6.5hours. After cooling to 50°C, a slurry was filtered under reduced<br>
pressure, to recover a cake. 7 L of distilled water was added to<br>
this cake which was then formed again into slurry followed by<br>
filtration. This washing procedure was carried out until the pH<br>
of the wash (filtrate) became higher than 3.5.<br>

and the mixture was reacted at 25°C for 1 hour. Simultaneously, 3.31<br>
mL of triisobutyl aluminum in heptane solution (0.71 Mol) was added<br>
to 218 mg	(0.3 mmol)	of<br>

heating method, both drain valves of the mold were opened, and in<br>
this state, steam was fed for 5 minutes in an exhaust process, followed<br>
by one-side heating at a pressure lower by 0.04 MPa (G) in the heating<br>
pressure, then reverse one-side heating at a pressure lower by 0.02<br>
MPa (G) in the heating pressure, and heating at mold heating steam<br>
pressure shown in Tables 2 and 3. After heating was terminated,<br>
pressure was discharged, and cooled until the surface pressure by<br>
foam of the molded article became 0.04 MPa (G) , and the die was opened<br>

D2 + 3.874 x D + 24.03, provided D is the apparent density (g/L)<br>
of the foamed bead molded article.<br>
O : The arrival factor at 50% strain relative to the standard<br>
compression stress is 80% or more.<br>

foamed beads are not foamed (secondary foaming) and fused with one<br>
another in the mold and an excellent foamed bead molded article cannot<br>
be obtained.<br>

The same base resin as in Examples 2, 3, 9 and 10 has been<br>
used in Comparative Examples 4 and 5, but the foaming temperature<br>
at the time of manufacturing the foamed beads is low in Comparative<br>
Example 4 and thus the endothermic peak calories at the side of high<br>
temperature is too high, and molding heating steam pressure is as<br>
high as 0.24 MPa (G) , and the foamed bead molded article is inferior<br>
inflexibility, and in Comparative Example 5, the foaming temperature<br>
at the time of manufacturing the foamed beads is high so that the<br>
endothermic peak calorie at the time of high temperature is too low,<br>
the shrinkage of the foamed bead molded article is too high, and<br>
the molded article cannot reproduce the mold form, and any foamed<br>
bead molded article cannot be obtained.<br>
[0120]<br>
The same resin as in Examples 2, 3, 9 and 10 has been used<br>
in Comparative Example 6, but the temperature of the atmosphere at<br>
the time of foaming is not regulated, and the temperature is 100°C<br>
or more, and given the usual amount of an dispersant, the foamed<br>
beads obtained by discharge from an autoclave is adhered mutually<br>
 <br>
-and thus the amount of the dispersant is increased. As a result,<br>
the amount of ash on the surface of the foamed beads becomes 3000<br>
ppm or more, and a heating steam of 0-2 MPa (G) or more is necessary,<br>
and the shrinkage of the molded article becomes higher.<br>
[0121]<br>
The melting point of the base resin in Comparative Example<br>
7	is in the melting point range specified in the present invention,<br>
but there is concerned that the physical properties of the molded<br>
article because the Olsen flexural modulus is low, the physical<br>
properties deterioration is prevented due to high peak calorie.<br>
However, because the high-temperature peak calorie is too high, the<br>
molding heating steam pressure is as high as 0.24 MPa (G) , and the<br>
desired object of the present invention cannot be achieved.<br>
[0122]<br>
The melting point of the base resin in Comparative Example<br>
8	is in the melting point range specified in the present invention,<br>
but the molded article which satisfies compression properties and<br>
heat resistance is not obtained because the Olsen flexural modulus<br>
is low. The peak temperature (i.e. apex temperature) of the<br>
high-temperature peak of the foamed beads in the base resin in<br>
Comparative Example 9 is not egual to and higher than 130°C and cannot<br>
form a molded article satisfying physical properties and heat<br>
resistance.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[0123]<br>
The polypropylene resin foamed beads of the present invention<br>
 <br>
- can give a foamed bead molded article excellent in mold reproduction<br>
at low molding temperature, mold dimensional stability, appearance<br>
such as surface smoothness and in mutual fusion of foamed beads,<br>
and the resulting foamed bead moldedarticle has excellent compression<br>
property, rigidity and heat resistance. Further, the foamed beads<br>
of the present invention and its molded article are also excellent<br>
in easy combustibility and easy recyclability. The polypropylene<br>
resin foamed beads of the present invention enable molding at low<br>
molding temperature at the time of molding, thereby enabling<br>
significant reduction in energy cost during molding as compared with<br>
the conventional molding of polypropylene resin foamed beads and<br>
simultaneously enabling use of steam at low saturation vapor pressure<br>
during molding, and thus the clamping pressure of a molding machine<br>
can be reduced and the thickness of a mold can be made thin so that<br>
the molding machine and the mold can be designed compliant at low<br>
pressure, and therefore, inexpensive design is feasible in molding<br>
facilities, and existing facilities for molding of polystyrene resin<br>
foamed beads are usable for polypropylene resin foamed beads.<br>
 <br>
