				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR CATALYTIC VAPOR PHASE OXIDATION OF PROPYLENE,<br>
ISOBUTYLENE OR (METH) ACROLEIN<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present, invention relates to a process for catalytic<br>
vapor phase oxidation which prevents a runaway reaction<br>
or early deterioration of a catalyst, in the production<br>
of (meth)acrylic acid or the like from propylene or<br>
isobutylene by the process for the catalytic vapor phase<br>
oxidation using a multi-tubular reactor, which makes the<br>
production in high yield constantly for a long period of<br>
time possible.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A usual multi-tubular reactor has a structure which<br>
is equipped with, as arranged within the shell of the<br>
reactor, a plurality of reaction tubes having a catalyst<br>
packed therein and a plurality of baffle plates having<br>
openings so as to distribute a heating medium introduced<br>
into the shell, entirely in the shell. It was common<br>
that the temperature of the heating medium flowing in the<br>
shell was measured, and on the basis of the result of the<br>
measurement, the operation control of the multi-tubular<br>
reactor was carried out while the temperature of the<br>
heating medium in the shell was uniformly controlled.<br>
Most of reaction tubes disposed in the shell are<br>
connected with the baffle plates. However, some of<br>
reaction tubes passing through openings formed in the<br>
baffle plates are not connected with baffle plates.<br>
JL<br>
Catalyst layers in the reaction tubes, which are not in<br>
contact with the baffle plates, tend to have local heat<br>
accumulation spots (hot spots) formed due to the reaction<br>
heat. If such a hot spot was formed, the portion of the<br>
catalyst tended to be deteriorated due to an excessive<br>
heat generation, and the lifetime tended to decrease.<br>
Further, in order to obtain proper performance in the<br>
lifetime of the catalyst by preventing formation of the<br>
hot spot, it was required to decrease the concentration<br>
of raw material gas introduced into the reaction tubes,<br>
or to limit the supply amount, whereby there was a case<br>
that (meth)acrylic acid or the like could not be produced<br>
constantly in high yield for a long period of time.<br>
EP-1080780-A1 discloses a shell-and tube type multi-<br>
tubular reactor wherein the arrangement of reaction rubes<br>
us specified. The effect is to repress the deviation of<br>
the temperature distribution of heating medium<br>
circulating on the shell side.<br>
US-5821390-A discloses a shell-and-tube type multi-<br>
tubular reactor wherein the temperature difference<br>
between the point of entry and the point of exit of the<br>
heat-exchange medium circulating on the shell side is<br>
adjusted to be within a range of from 2 to 10°C.<br>
JP-10-309457-A (EP-873783-A1) describes that a gas<br>
amount flowing in a reaction tube varies depending on the<br>
presence or absence of a temperature-measuring unit in a<br>
tubular type reactor, and discloses a tubular type<br>
reactor designed to adjust the gas amount constant.<br>
WO2001-042194-A1 (US-2003-004374-A1) discloses that a<br>
plurality of catalyst layers each having different<br>
activity are disposed in one tubular reactor.<br>
The present invention essentially comprises the following<br>
features:<br>
(A) A process for catalytic vapor phase oxidation<br>
employing a shell-and-tube type multi-tubular reactor.<br>
(B) The temperature of the catalyst packed in a<br>
reaction tube is not connected with at least one baffle<br>
plate is measured.<br>
(C) The temperature of the catalyst packed in a<br>
reaction tube which is connected with all baffle plates,<br>
are measured.<br>
(D) The temperature and flow rate of the heating<br>
medium to be introduced into the shell are controlled on<br>
the basis of the temperature of the catalyst measured.<br>
None of the 4 referenced documents mentioned above<br>
disclose the said (B), (C) and (D) of the present<br>
invention that helps to improve the catalyst performance.<br>

MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The process for catalytic vapor phase oxidation of<br>
the present invention will be described on the basis of<br>
the attached drawings.<br>
The process for catalytic vapor phase oxidation of<br>
the present invention and a multi-tubular reactor to be<br>
used for the process for catalytic vapor phase oxidation<br>
will be described on the basis of Fig. 1.<br>
Numeral 2 designates a shell for the multi-tubular<br>
reactor, in which reaction tubes la, lb and lc having a<br>
catalyst packed therein are secured by each of a lower<br>
tube plate 5b and an upper tube plate 5a.<br>
At the top and bottom ends of the shell 2, inlet and<br>
outlet ports 4a and 4b for raw material gas Rg for<br>
reaction are provided, and the raw material gas Rg flows<br>
in the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c in the direction of<br>
upward or downward flow. Such a flow direction is not<br>
particularly limited, but the upward flow is more<br>
preferred.<br>
Further, a circular pipe 3a for introducing the<br>
heating medium Hm is provided on the outer periphery of<br>
the shell 2, and the heating medium Hm having a pressure<br>
increased by the circulation pump 7 is introduced into<br>
the shell 2 from the circular pipe 3a. The heating medium<br>
introduced into the shell 2 flows upward, while the flow<br>
direction is changed by the baffle plates 6a, 6b, and 6a<br>
as indicated by arrow marks. Meantime, the heating<br>
medium Hm absorbs heat of reaction by the contact with<br>
the outer surfaces of the reaction tubes la, lb and lc,<br>
and then is returned to the circulation pump 7 through<br>
the circular pipe 3b provided on the outer periphery of<br>
the shell 2.<br>
A portion of the heating medium Hm which absorbs the<br>
heat of reaction, is fed into an exhaust pipe 8b provided<br>
at the upper part of the circulation pump 7 to be cooled<br>
by a heat exchanger (not shown), and then is sucked into<br>
the circulation pump 7 through a heating medium supply<br>
pipe 8a again to be introduced into the shell 2.<br>
The temperature control for the heating medium Hm<br>
introduced into the shell 2 is carried out by controlling<br>
the temperature or flow volume of the heating medium to<br>
be flown from the heating medium supply pipe 8a.<br>
Further, the temperature of the heating medium Hm is<br>
measured by a thermometer 14 inserted in the inlet side<br>
of the circular pipe 3a.<br>
On each copper plate inside of the circular pipes 3a<br>
and 3b, a rectification plate (not shown) is provided in<br>
order to minimize circumferential distribution of the<br>
flow rate of the heating medium. As such a rectification<br>
plate, e.g. a poriferous plate or a plate having slits is<br>
employed. By changing the opening area of the poriferous<br>
plate or the distance of the slits, the heating medium Hm<br>
is rectified such that the heating medium can be<br>
introduced into the shell 2 from its entire periphery<br>
with a constant flow rate and a constant flow volume.<br>
Further, a plurality of thermometers 15 are arranged at<br>
even intervals in a circumferential direction as shown in<br>
Fig.4, whereby the temperature in the circular pipe (3a,<br>
more preferably 3b in addition thereto) can be monitored.<br>
In general, at least three baffle plates (6a, 6b and<br>
6a) are usually disposed in the shell 2. Due to the<br>
presence of the baffle plates, the flow of the heating<br>
medium Hm in the shell 2 is such that it is firstly<br>
gathered from the peripheral portion to the center<br>
portion of the shell 2, and then is directed to the outer<br>
periphery as it flows upward through the opening portion<br>
of the baffle plate 6a to reach the inner wall of the<br>
shell 2.<br>
Then, the flowing direction of the heating medium Hm<br>
is changed again, while the medium flows up through the<br>
space between the inner wall of the shell 2 and the outer<br>
periphery of the baffle plate 6b, and then is gathered to<br>
the center portion. Then, it flows up through the<br>
opening portion of the baffle plate 6a; flows along the<br>
lower surface of the upper-tube plate 5a in the shell 2<br>
to head for the outer periphery; is introduced into the<br>
circular pipe 3b, and finally is sucked into the<br>
circulation pump 7 to be circulated in the shell 2 again.<br>
As specific structures of the baffle plates to be<br>
used in the present invention, either waning circular<br>
baffle plates of segment type as shown in Fig. 2 or<br>
circular baffle plates as shown in Fig. 3 may be applied.<br>
Baffle plates of such types have no difference in the<br>
relation between the flow direction of the heat medium<br>
and the tube axes of the reaction tubes.<br>
The baffle plcites 6a have their outer periphery<br>
coincident with the inner wall of the shell 2, and have<br>
an opening portion near the center. Further, the<br>
diameter of the outer periphery of the baffle plate 6b is<br>
smaller than that of the inner wall of the shell 2,<br>
whereby a space is formed between the outer periphery of<br>
baffle plate 6b and the inner wall of the shell 2. The<br>
flow rate of the heating medium is changed by changing<br>
the direction of the flow, while the heating medium flows<br>
up through the respective opening portions and space.<br>
A thermometer 11 is inserted in each of the reaction<br>
tubes 1a, 1b and 1c disposed in the shell 2, and the<br>
signals are transmitted to an external portion of the<br>
shell 2, whereby each temperature distribution in the<br>
direction of the tube axis, in the catalysts layers<br>
packed in the reaction tubes, is measured.<br>
Multipoint type thermometers or thermometers 11<br>
movable in a sheath to measure a plurality of points, are<br>
inserted in the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c, whereby<br>
temperatures at 2 to 20 points in the direction of axes<br>
are measured.<br>
The inner space of the shell 2 equipped with the<br>
reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c is divided by three baffle<br>
plates 6a, 6b and 6c, and divided spaces are classified<br>
into 3 types with respect to the flow direction of the<br>
heating medium Hm.<br>
Namely, the reaction tube la is connected with the<br>
baffle plate 6b, whereby the flow direction of the<br>
heating medium Hm is restricted by only the baffle plate<br>
6b, and the flow direction is not restricted by the other<br>
two baffle plates 6a since it passes through the opening<br>
portions of these baffle plates 6a.<br>
The heating medium Hm introduced from the circular<br>
pipe 3a into the shell 2 changes its flow direction at<br>
the center portion of the shell 2 as indicated by arrow<br>
marks in Fig 1. Further, the reaction tube la is<br>
positioned so that the flow direction is changed, whereby<br>
the heating medium Hm flown around the outer periphery of<br>
the reaction tube la mainly flows parallel to the axis of<br>
the reaction tube la.<br>
The reaction tube lb is connected with three baffle<br>
plates 6a, 6b and 6a, whereby the flow direction of the<br>
heating medium Hm is restricted by the respective baffle<br>
plates. Further, the flow of the heating medium Hm flown<br>
around the outer periphery of the reaction tube lb flows<br>
perpendicular to the axis of the reaction tube lb at the<br>
approximately entire positions of the reaction tube lb.<br>
Here, most of the reaction tubes disposed in the shell 2<br>
are at positions corresponding to the reaction tube lb.<br>
Further, the reaction tube 1c passes through the<br>
space between the outer periphery of the reaction tube 6b<br>
and the inner wall of the shell 2 without any contact<br>
with the baffle plate 6b, whereby the flow of the heating<br>
medium Hm in the position is not restricted by the baffle<br>
plate 6b, and it flows parallel to the axis of the<br>
reaction tube 1c.<br>
Fig.4 shows the interrelation between the positional<br>
relation of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c and the<br>
baffle plates 6a, 6b and 6a and flows of the heating<br>
medium Hm.<br>
When the opening portion of baffle plates 6a (the<br>
innermost circle of dotted line) is the gathering<br>
position of the heating medium Hm, that is, at the center<br>
of the shell 2, the heating medium Hm not merely flows<br>
parallel to the reaction tube la, but also hardly flows<br>
at the center of the opening portion of baffle plates 6a,<br>
i.e., the flow rate is approximately zero, whereby the<br>
heat conductivity efficiency is terribly bad. Therefore,<br>
there is a case that the reaction tube la is not disposed<br>
at such a position.<br>
Fig. 5 is another example of the present invention<br>
in a case where the inner portion of the shell 2 of the<br>
reactor is divided by a middle-tube plate 9.<br>
In divided spaces of the shell 2, heating media Hm1<br>
and Hm2 are circulated respectively, and further, they<br>
are respectively subjected to temperature controls.<br>
The upper and lower portions of the reaction tubes<br>
1a, 1b and 1c, are partitioned by interposed layers of an<br>
inert material which are not involved in the reactions,<br>
different catalysts are respectively packed therein, and<br>
the temperatures of the respective catalysts are<br>
controlled under optimum conditions, to carry out<br>
reactions. Further, the position for interposing such an<br>
inert material is a portion corresponding to the<br>
positions where the outer peripheries of the reaction<br>
tubes 1a, 1b and 1c are in contact with middle-tube plate<br>
9.<br>
Raw material gas Rg is introduced from an inlet 4a<br>
of raw material gas into the shell 2, and then reactions<br>
are sequentially carried out as the gas flows in the<br>
reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c to produce a product.<br>
For example, propylene or isobutylene is introduced<br>
as a gas mixed with molecular oxygen-containing gas, then<br>
converted to (meth)acrolein at the lower portion, and<br>
then oxidized in the upper portion to form (meth)acrylic<br>
acid.<br>
In Fig. 6, numeral 9 designates a middle-tube plate,<br>
three heat shields 10 are fixed at positions below the<br>
lower surface of the middle-tube plate 9 by means of<br>
spacer rods 13. Two or three heat shields 10 are<br>
provided below the middle-tube plate 9, as shown in this<br>
figure, or above thereof at positions as well as being<br>
not more than 100 mm, whereby stagnation spaces 12 having<br>
no flow are formed even though the heating medium Hm1 or<br>
Hm2 is filled. Accordingly, it is preferred to let the<br>
spaces have a heat-insulating effect.<br>
The reasons why the heat shields 10 are attached to<br>
the middle-tube plate 9 are as follows. That is, in<br>
Fig.5, in a case where the controlled temperature<br>
difference between the heating medium Hm1 introduced into<br>
the lower portion in the shell 2 and the heating medium<br>
Hm2 introduced into the upper portion exceeds 100°C, it<br>
is not allowed to disregard a heat transfer from a hot-<br>
temperature medium to a low-temperature medium, whereby<br>
the accuracy of the control of the reaction temperature<br>
of the catalyst at a low-temperature side is<br>
deteriorated. In such a case, it is required to provide<br>
heat insulation for the prevention of the heat transfer<br>
above and/or below the middle-tube plate 9.<br>
Into the multi-tubular reactor to be used for<br>
catalytic vapor phase oxidation, a mixed gas is<br>
introduced as the raw material gas Rg of reactions,<br>
wherein the mixed gas comprises propylene or isobutylene,<br>
and/or (meth)acrolein mixed with molecular oxygen-<br>
containing gas or steam.<br>
The concentration of propylene or isobutylene is<br>
from 3 to 10 vol%, and oxygen is from 1.5 to 2.5 (molar<br>
ratio) and steam is from 0.8 to 2 (molar ratio) to<br>
propylene or isobutylene.<br>
The raw material gas Rg introduced therein, is<br>
divided by the respective reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c,<br>
and then, as it flows in the reaction tubes, reacted by<br>
an oxidation catalyst contained therein. However,<br>
distribution of the raw material gas Rg to the respective<br>
reaction tubes is affected by e.g. the packing amounts or<br>
the packing densities of the catalyst in the reaction<br>
tubes. Such packing amounts or packing densities of the<br>
catalyst are determined at the time of packing operation<br>
of the catalyst in the reaction tubes. Therefore, it is<br>
very important to pack the catalyst uniformly in the<br>
respective reaction tubes.<br>
In order to pack the catalyst uniformly, it is<br>
possible to employ a method of making the packing density<br>
constant by making the weight of the catalyst packed in<br>
the respective reaction tubes uniform, or by adjusting<br>
the time for packing the catalyst to be the same.<br>
The raw material gas Rg, which flows in the<br>
respective reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c, is firstly<br>
heated during flowing through the inert agent layer<br>
packed in each inlet part, to reach the reaction starting<br>
temperature.<br>
The raw material (propylene or isobutylene) is<br>
oxidized by the catalyst contained as the next layer in<br>
each reaction tube, and the temperature is further<br>
increased by the heat of reaction.<br>
The reaction amount is largest at the inlet part of<br>
the catalyst layer, and if it exceeds the heat removal<br>
amount by the heating medium Hm, the heat of reaction<br>
generated will serve to increase the temperature, whereby<br>
a hot spot may be formed. The hot spot is likely to be<br>
formed at a position of from 300 to 1000 mm from the<br>
inlets of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c.<br>
Accordingly, the heat removal effect by the flow of<br>
the heating medium Hm, is most important within 1,000 mm<br>
from the inlets of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c. If<br>
the amount of the heat of reaction generated here exceeds<br>
the heat removal ability of the heating medium Hm from<br>
the periphery of the reaction tubes, the temperature of<br>
the raw material gas Rg will further rise, whereby the<br>
generation amount of the heat of reaction will further<br>
increase, and finally, a runaway reaction will take<br>
place. Thus, it is possible that the temperature of the<br>
catalyst exceeds the maximum allowance, and the catalyst<br>
undergoes a quality change, whereby its deterioration or<br>
breaking can occur.<br>
With respect to the preliminary-step reactor for<br>
producing acrolein by the oxidation reaction of propylene<br>
with the molecular oxygen-containing gas, as an example,<br>
the temperature of the heating medium Hm is from 250 to<br>
3 50°C, and the maximum allowable temperature against the<br>
hot spot is from 400 to 500°C.<br>
Further, with respect to the subsequent step reactor<br>
for obtaining acrylic acid by oxidizing acrolein with the<br>
molecular oxygen-containing gas, the temperature of the<br>
heating medium Hm is from 2 00 to 300°C, and the maximum<br>
allowable temperature against the hot spot is from 300 to<br>
400°C.<br>
As the heating medium Hm which flows in the shell 2<br>
i.e., around outer peripheries of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c, Niter which is a mixture of nitrates, is<br>
widely used, but a phenyl ether heating medium of an<br>
organic liquid system may also be used.<br>
The heat removal is carried out at the outer<br>
peripheries of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c, during<br>
the flow of the heating medium Hm. However, with respect<br>
to the heating medium Hm introduced from the circular<br>
pipe 3a to the shell 2, a position where the medium flows<br>
from the outer periphery of the shell 2 to the center<br>
portion, and a position where the flow direction is<br>
turned around at the center portion, are present, and it<br>
was found that the heat removal effect is extremely<br>
different in the respective positions.<br>
When the flow direction of the heating medium Hm is<br>
perpendicular to the tube axis of the reaction tube, the<br>
heat transfer coefficient is from 1,000 to 2,000 W/m2°C.<br>
However, when the flow direction is not perpendicular<br>
thereto, it is different in accordance with the flow rate<br>
or the difference of upward flow or downward flow.<br>
However, even if Niter is used as a heating medium, the<br>
heat transfer coefficient is usually from 100 to 300<br>
W/m2°C at the utmost.<br>
On the other hand, the heat transfer coefficient of<br>
the catalyst layers in the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c,<br>
of course, relies on the flow rate of the raw material<br>
gas Rg. However, it is approximately 100 W/m2°C,<br>
whereby, obviously, it is not changed from a conventional<br>
knowledge that the rate controlling of the heat transfer<br>
is the gas phase in the tubes.<br>
Specifically, when the flow of the heating medium Hm<br>
is perpendicular to the tube axes of the reaction tubes<br>
1a, 1b and 1c, the heat transfer resistance of the outer<br>
periphery of the tube is from 1/10 to 1/20 to that of the<br>
reaction tube gas Rg side. Even if the flow rate of the<br>
heating medium Hm side is changed, such a change will not<br>
substantially affect the overall heat transfer<br>
resistance.<br>
However, when Niter flows parallel to the axes of<br>
the tubes, the heat transfer coefficients of inside and<br>
outside of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c are nearly<br>
equal, whereby the influence of the flow state at the<br>
outer periphery of the tubes on the heat removal<br>
efficiency is substantial. Namely, when the heat<br>
transfer resistance of the outer periphery of the tube is<br>
100 W/m2oC, the overall heat transfer coefficient becomes<br>
half thereof, and further, half of the change in the heat<br>
transfer resistance of the outer periphery of the tube is<br>
influential over the overall heat transfer coefficient.<br>
It is required to monitor the difference of the heat<br>
transfer coefficients carefully when the reaction is<br>
practically carried out.<br>
The reaction tube lb is one restricted by all baffle<br>
plates (usually three sheets), wherein the overall heat<br>
transfer coefficient is large, the maximum temperature is<br>
low in the temperature distribution in the direction of<br>
the tube axis of the catalyst layer in the reaction tube,<br>
and it is considered to be average in the entire shell 2.<br>
Further, the reaction tube which is provided at a<br>
position where the heating medium Hm changes the<br>
direction, is the; reaction tube 1c unrestricted by one<br>
baffle plate, or the reaction tube la unrestricted by two<br>
baffle plates.<br>
When the supply amount of the raw material gas Rg to<br>
the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c is increased, or the<br>
reaction temperature is maintained to be high to obtain a<br>
high conversion, the maximum temperature of the reaction<br>
tubes tends to increase to form hot spots, whereby the<br>
possibility of the deterioration of the catalyst or the<br>
runaway reaction will increase.<br>
In such a case, it is necessary to strictly control<br>
the temperature of the heating medium Hm. A plurality of<br>
thermometers 11 are inserted in a plurality of the<br>
reaction tubes 1a or 1c, and the temperature of the<br>
heating medium Hm is controlled, while monitoring the hot<br>
spot temperatures of the respective reaction tubes. The<br>
temperature of the heating medium Hm is thus strictly<br>
controlled to a proper temperature, whereby the desired<br>
reaction result can be obtained, and further, e.g.<br>
deterioration of the catalyst can be prevented, and it<br>
becomes possible that the continuous operation can be<br>
carried out for a long period of time.<br>
When the maximum temperature of the reaction tube 1a<br>
is close to the restricted temperature, the temperature<br>
of the heating medium Hm may be lowered. However, in the<br>
case of the reaction tube 1c, there may be a case where<br>
the temperature at the downstream portion to the position<br>
showing the maximum temperature will increase. Therefore<br>
it is not allowed to neglect the monitoring.<br>
When the conversion by the reaction is lower than<br>
the proper value, it is necessary to raise the<br>
temperature of the heating medium Hm. However, even in<br>
such a time, it is important to monitor the maximum<br>
temperature of the reaction tube so that it will not<br>
exceed the restricted temperature. Further, the maximum<br>
temperature of the reaction tube, or the position showing<br>
the maximum temperature of the reaction tube, may<br>
sometimes change, also when the supply amount to the<br>
shell 2 of the raw material gas, as mixed gas of<br>
propylene or isobutylene with molecular oxygen-containing<br>
gas or the like, increases or decreases.<br>
Further, it is more preferred that thermometers 11<br>
are inserted also in a plurality of reaction tubes 1b,<br>
and the temperature of the heating medium Hm be<br>
controlled while monitoring the temperatures of the<br>
catalyst layers in the reaction tubes.<br>
The maximum temperature of the reaction tubes 1b,<br>
which occupy the great majority of the reaction tubes, is<br>
measured and compared with the maximum temperature of the<br>
reaction tubes 1a or 1c in other areas, whereby it is<br>
possible to bring the reaction result to be more proper.<br>
The difference in the maximum average temperature<br>
(the average value in the maximum temperature per every<br>
reaction tube) of the reaction tubes present in the<br>
respective areas is preferably within 30°C, particularly<br>
preferably within 20°C, more preferably within 15°C. If<br>
the difference is too large, the reaction yield tends to<br>
decrease, such being undesirable.<br>
The number of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c<br>
having thermometers 11 inserted, in the respective areas,<br>
is at least 1, preferably from 3 to 5. If the inserted<br>
number is a few, there may be a case where abnormality in<br>
the maximum temperature of the reaction tubes can not be<br>
detected, even if there is a temperature unevenness of<br>
the heating medium Hm introduced into the circular pipe<br>
3a of the shell 2.<br>
Further, the above area is meant for aggregation of<br>
reaction tubes which extend through an opening or space<br>
of the same baffle plate, and further are connected to<br>
and supported by the same baffle plate.<br>
The types of the baffle plates for the purpose of<br>
shifting the flow direction of the heating medium Hm<br>
flowing in the shell 2 or of preventing a bypass flow of<br>
the heating medium Hm, are not particularly restricted.<br>
However, a segment baffle plate or a circular baffle<br>
plate as shown in Fig. 2 or 3 is employed, and<br>
particularly, the circular baffle plate seems to be<br>
widely used.<br>
The area of the opening at the center of the baffle<br>
plate 6a is from 5 to 50%, preferably from 10 to 3 0% of<br>
the inner cross sectional area of the shell 2.<br>
The space area formed by the outer periphery of the<br>
baffle plate 6b and the inner wall of the shell 2 is from<br>
5 to 50%, preferably from 10 to 30% of the inner cross<br>
sectional area of the shell 2.<br>
If the opening ratio and the space ratio of the<br>
baffle plates 6a and 6b are too small, the flow path of<br>
the heating medium Hm will be long, the pressure loss<br>
between the circular pipes 3a and 3b will increase, and<br>
the power of the circulation pump 7 will increase. On<br>
the other hand, if the ratios are too large, the number<br>
of the reaction tubes 1a and 1c will increase.<br>
The spacing of the respective baffle plates (the<br>
distance between the baffle plates 6a and 6b; the<br>
distance between the baffle plate 6a and the upper-tube<br>
plate 5a; and the distance between the baffle plate 6a<br>
and the lower-tube plate 5b) is usually set to be an<br>
equal interval. However it may not necessarily be set to<br>
be an equal interval so long as the required flow rate of<br>
the heating medium Hm determined by the heat of oxidation<br>
reaction generated in the reaction tube can be secured,<br>
and the pressure loss of the heating medium can be made<br>
to be low.<br>
It is necessary to avoid that the position of the<br>
maximum temperature in the temperature distribution in<br>
the reaction tubes 1a, 1b or 1c be the same as the<br>
position of the baffle plate 6a, 6b or 6a. Near the<br>
surface of each baffle plate, the flow rate of the<br>
heating medium decreases and the heat transfer<br>
coefficient will be low. Accordingly, if the position of<br>
the maximum temperature of the reaction tube is<br>
overlapped therewith, it becomes highly likely that the<br>
hot spot is formed.<br>
In the shell 2, inside of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b<br>
and 1c containing the oxidation catalyst is a gas phase,<br>
and further, the maximum linear velocity of the raw<br>
material gas is restricted by the catalyst, whereby the<br>
heat transfer coefficient in the respective reaction<br>
tubes will be low, and it becomes a heat-transfer rate-<br>
controlling process. Accordingly, the inner diameters of<br>
the reaction tubes are very important.<br>
The inner diameters of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and<br>
1c are affected by the amount of the heat of reaction and<br>
the particle diameter of the catalyst in the tubes.<br>
However, an inner diameter of from 10 to 50 mmF is<br>
usually selected. It is more preferably from 2 0 to 3 0<br>
mmF. If the inner diameters of the respective reaction<br>
tubes are too small, the weight of the catalyst packed<br>
therein will decrease, and the number of the reaction<br>
tubes will be large to the required catalytic amount,<br>
whereby the shell 2 will be large.<br>
On the other hand, if the inner diameters of the<br>
reaction tubes are too large, the contact of the catalyst<br>
and the surface area of the reaction tube will be small<br>
to the required heat removal amount, whereby heat<br>
transfer efficiency for heat removal of the heat of<br>
reaction will decrease.<br>
As the thermometer 11 inserted into the reaction<br>
tube, usually, one having a columned shape, in which a<br>
plurality of thermocouples, resistance temperature<br>
sensors or the like are covered with an outer tube<br>
(thermowell), or one in which a thermocouple is movable<br>
in the sheath, may be used.<br>
It is necessary that the thermometer 11 is set at a<br>
position on the tube axis, and projections are provided<br>
on the surface of the outer tube, whereby the distance<br>
from the inner wall of the reaction tube is restricted to<br>
overlap with the position of the tube axis.<br>
It is preferred that the tube axis of the reaction<br>
tube and the central axis of thermometer 11 are<br>
overlapped. Further, it is preferred that the<br>
projections, which are formed on the thermometer 11, are<br>
provided in front and rear of the position of the maximum<br>
temperature in the catalyst layer.<br>
As the outer tube (thermowell) of thermometer 11,<br>
one having a diameter of at most 15mmF is used. Also, in<br>
consideration of the relation to the inner diameter of<br>
the reaction tube, the distance to the inner wall of the<br>
reaction tubes should be at least two times of the<br>
particle diameter of the catalyst. If the particle<br>
diameter of the catalyst is 5 mm and the inner diameter<br>
of the reaction tube is 3 0 mmF, the diameter of the outer<br>
tube of thermometer 11 will be required to be at most 10<br>
mmF.<br>
If the packing density of the catalyst is different<br>
between the reaction tube having a thermometer 11<br>
inserted and other reaction tube, the accurate<br>
temperature can not be measured. Accordingly, the outer<br>
diameter of thermometer 11 is preferably at most 6 mmF,<br>
more preferably from 2 to 4 mmF.<br>
The present invention is basically to take measures<br>
to meet the situation by analyzing the flow rate and the<br>
heat transfer coefficient of the heating medium Hm, and<br>
focusing on the presence of a portion having a low heat<br>
transfer coefficient, in the respective portions in cross<br>
section of the shall 2. However, with respect to the<br>
reaction tube disposed at the portion having a low heat<br>
transfer coefficient, particularly, with respect to the<br>
reaction tube 1a and a reaction tube in the vicinity<br>
thereof, an area having an extremely low heat transfer<br>
coefficient is found in the opening portion of the baffle<br>
plate (the round portion at the center in the circular<br>
baffle plate) at the center or in the vicinity thereof,<br>
in cross section of the shell 2. Such an area is found<br>
at or near the center of the opening portion of the<br>
baffle plate 6a. Therefore, it is recommended that no<br>
reaction tube be provided at such an area corresponding<br>
to a portion having a cross-sectional area ratio of the<br>
shell of from 0.5 to 5%. If such a portion is smaller<br>
than 0.5%, it is required to set the flow amount of the<br>
heating medium Hm to be at least two times so that the<br>
heat transfer coefficient be at least the minimum of the<br>
required value, whereby the power of the circulation pump<br>
7 will have to be increased.<br>
However, if the area where no reaction tube be<br>
provided is more than 5%, the waist diameter of the shell<br>
2 will have to be increased in order to provide the<br>
required number of reaction tubes.<br>
With respect to the reaction tubes 1a which are not<br>
supported by the baffle plate 6a, it is preferred not to<br>
provide them from 3 0 to 80% of the width of the opening<br>
portion of the baffle plate 6a (in the case of the<br>
segment baffle plate of Fig. 2) or of the diameter of the<br>
opening portion of the baffle plate 6a (in the case of<br>
the circular baffle plate of Fig. 3).<br>
In Figs. 1 to 5, the upward flow direction of the<br>
heating medium Hm in the shell 2 is indicated by arrow<br>
marks. However, the present invention can be applied<br>
also to a case where the flow direction is opposite.<br>
When the direction of the circulation flow of the<br>
heating medium Hm is to be determined, it is necessary to<br>
take due care to avoid a phenomenon that the gas which<br>
may stay in the upper portions of the shell 2 and the<br>
circulation pump 7, particularly the inert gas such as<br>
nitrogen, will be included in the flow of the heating<br>
medium.<br>
In a case where the heating medium Hm is the upward<br>
flow as shown in Fig. 1, if the gas is included at the<br>
upper portion of the circulation pump 7, the cavitation<br>
phenomenon may be observed in the circulation pump, and<br>
in the worst case, the pump may be damaged. In the<br>
opposite case, the phenomenon of inclusion of the gas<br>
will occur also at the upper portion of the shell 2, and<br>
the retention portion of the gas phase will be formed at<br>
the upper portion, of the shell 2, whereby the upper<br>
portion of the reaction tubes corresponding to the gas<br>
retention portion will not be cooled by the heating<br>
medium Hm.<br>
As measures for preventing the gas from staying, it<br>
is necessary to set a gas venting line for substitution<br>
of the gas in the gas layer with the heating medium Hm.<br>
For that purpose, the heating medium pressure of the<br>
supply-pipe of the heating medium 8a should be increased,<br>
and the exhaust pipe of the heating medium 8b be provided<br>
at an upper portion as far as possible to increase the<br>
pressure in the shell 2. The exhaust pipe of the heating<br>
medium 8b should be provided at a higher position than<br>
the upper-tube plate 5a.<br>
The flow direction of the raw material gas Rg in the<br>
reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c may be upward or downward.<br>
However, a parallel flow is preferred in relation to the<br>
heating medium flow.<br>
The heating values in the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and<br>
1c are the largest at the inlet ports, and the formation<br>
position of the hot spot is often found at a position on<br>
the tube axis of the reaction tube in a range of from 3 00<br>
to 1,000 mm from the inlet.<br>
In connection with the baffle plates, the position<br>
of the hot spot is often found in an area between the<br>
upper-tube plate 5a or the lower-tube plate 5b and the<br>
baffle plate 6a. By supplying the heating medium Hm<br>
having a controlled temperature directly to the positions<br>
of the tube axes of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c<br>
corresponding to the maximum temperature of the reaction<br>
tubes, the formation of the hot spot can readily be<br>
controlled. Accordingly, it is preferred that the<br>
macroscopic direction of the flow of the heating medium<br>
Hm and the flow direction of the raw material gas Rg are<br>
the same direction, namely, the parallel flow.<br>
The heat transfer amount, namely the reaction heat<br>
amount can be calculated by the heat transfer coefficient<br>
x heat transfer area x (catalyst layer temperature -<br>
heating medium temperature). Accordingly, a method of<br>
lowering the reaction heat amount per the surface area<br>
(the heat transfer area) of the reaction tube is<br>
effective to lower the maximum temperature of the<br>
reaction tube.<br>
In order to equalize the heating value of the heat<br>
of reaction, at least two types of catalyst layers having<br>
different activities are packed in the same reaction<br>
tube. It is preferred that a catalyst layer having a<br>
lower activity is packed at the inlet side, and a<br>
plurality of catalyst layers are packed in the reaction<br>
tube so that the catalyst layer is changed over to one<br>
having a higher activity in the flow after the peak of<br>
the temperature distribution.<br>
As a method for controlling the activity of the<br>
catalyst layer, a method of using a catalyst having a<br>
different activity by controlling the composition of the<br>
catalyst or a method of controlling the activity by<br>
mixing catalyst particles with inert particles to dilute<br>
the catalyst may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
A catalyst layer having a high proportion of inert<br>
particles (the proportion of the catalyst particles in<br>
the mixed particles: dilution rate) is packed in the<br>
inlet parts of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c, and a<br>
catalyst layer having a low or zero dilution rate is<br>
packed in the later flow of the reaction tube. The<br>
dilution rate is different depending on the catalyst.<br>
However, the dilution rate in the earlier stage is from<br>
0.3 to 0.7 in many cases. The dilution rate in the later<br>
stage of from 0-5 to 1.0 is preferably used. As the<br>
activity change or the dilution of the catalyst, two or<br>
three stages are usually applied.<br>
The dilution rate of the catalyst packed in the<br>
reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c is not required to be equal<br>
with respect to all tubes. For example, the maximum<br>
temperature of the reaction tube 1a is high, whereby the<br>
possibility of the deterioration of the catalyst is high.<br>
In order to avoid such deterioration, it is possible to<br>
decrease the dilution rate at the earlier stage, and on<br>
the contrary, to increase the dilution rate at the later<br>
stage.<br>
If the conversions in the reactions of the<br>
respective reaction tubes are different, the average<br>
conversion or the yield in the entire reactor will be<br>
thereby affected. Therefore, it is preferred that the<br>
respective reaction tubes be set to obtain the same<br>
conversion even if the dilution rate is changed.<br>
The present invention is suitably applied to a<br>
multi-tubular reactor for oxidizing propylene or<br>
isobutylene by molecular oxygen-containing gas, or a<br>
multi-tubular reactor for oxidizing (meth)acrolein by<br>
molecular oxygen-containing gas to obtain (meth)acrylic<br>
acid. As a catalyst to be used for the oxidation of<br>
propylene, a multi-component composite metal oxide<br>
composed mainly of Mo-Bi type is preferably used, and as<br>
a catalyst for producing acrylic acid by oxidizing<br>
acrolein, a composite oxide composed mainly of Mo-V type<br>
is preferably used.<br>
Propylene or isobutylene is oxidized by two steps,<br>
whereby it is possible to use two multi-tubular reactors,<br>
and different catalysts may be packed in the respective<br>
reactors. As shown in Fig. 5, however, the present<br>
invention can be applied to a case where the shell side<br>
of one reactor is divided into at least two compartments<br>
by a middle-tube plate, and then different catalysts may<br>
be packed therein respectively to obtain (meth)acrylic<br>
acid in one reactor.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
For carrying out the oxidation reaction of<br>
propylene, as catalyst (A), a catalyst having a<br>
composition (atomic ratio) of Mo=12, Bi=5, Ni=3, Co=2,<br>
Fe=0.4, Na=0.2, B=0.4, K=0.1, Si=24 and 0=x, (the<br>
composition of oxide x is a value determined by oxidation<br>
states of the respective metals; the same applies<br>
hereinafter), and further, as catalyst (B), a catalyst<br>
having a composition (atomic ratio) of Mo=35, V=7,<br>
Sb=100, Ni=43, Nb=3, Cu=9, Si=20 and 0=x, were<br>
respectively produced in accordance with usual methods to<br>
obtain catalyst powders. The catalyst powders were<br>
respectively molded to form ring shape catalysts having a<br>
outer diameter = 5 mm<i>, an inner diameter = 2 mmO and a<br>
height = 4 mm and. used. A multi-tubular reactor with an<br>
inner diameter of the shell = 3,500 mmF having 9,000<br>
reaction tubes made of stainless steel, as shown in Fig.<br>
1, was used, wherein the reaction tubes had a length =<br>
3,500 mm, an inner diameter = 24 mmF and an outer<br>
diameter = 28 mmF respectively. The reaction tubes were<br>
not arranged in the round-shaped portion with the<br>
diameter of the center portion = 500 m in the shell.<br>
The baffle plates were provided at equal intervals<br>
in the order of the circular baffle plates 6a-6b-6a, and<br>
the respective opening ratios of the baffle plates were<br>
18%. Further, the baffle plates 6a had diameters of<br>
opening portion =1,480 mmF, and the baffle plate 6b had<br>
the inner diameter =3,170 mmF.<br>
Further, as disposed in the shell in Fig. 1, the<br>
number of the reaction tubes 1a was 1,534, that of the<br>
reaction tubes 1c was 1,740 and the rest was the reaction<br>
tubes 1b.<br>
As the heating medium Hm, a molten salt Niter being<br>
a mixture of nitrates was used, and it was supplied from<br>
the lower side of the shell 2.<br>
As the reaction temperature, the temperature of<br>
Niter to be supplied to the shell 2, measured by<br>
thermometer 14, was used. Further, the flow rate of<br>
Niter was controlled such that the temperature difference<br>
between the outlet and inlet of the shell 2 was 4°C.<br>
To the respective reaction tubes, 1.5 L of the<br>
catalyst (A) was packed, raw material gas Rg with a<br>
propylene concentration of 9 vol% was supplied from a<br>
lower portion of the reactor at a gage pressure of 75<br>
kPa.<br>
To the reaction tubes 1a, 1b and 1c, thermometers 11<br>
having 10 measurement points in the direction of each<br>
tube axis, were inserted to measure the temperature<br>
distribution. In each area of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b<br>
and 1c, two thermometers (six in total) are inserted.<br>
In order to detect the maximum temperatures of the<br>
respective reaction tubes accurately, the measurement<br>
points of thermometers 11 were provided respectively at<br>
250 mm intervals of from the inlet port of the reaction<br>
tubes to the position of 1,500 mm, and at 400 mm<br>
intervals in the position beyond 1,500 mm. The maximum<br>
temperatures of the tubes were recorded by using such<br>
thermometers 11.<br>
When the temperature of the heating medium Hm was<br>
set to be 331°C, the average values of the maximum<br>
temperatures of the respective reaction tubes were 410°C<br>
in the reaction tubes 1a, 3 9 0°C in the reaction tubes 1b<br>
and 390°C in the reaction tubes 1c. Further, in such a<br>
case, it was found that the propylene conversion was 97%,<br>
and the yield was 92%.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
By using the same reactor as in Example 1, molecular<br>
oxygen-containing gas (oxygen concentration: 15 vol%) was<br>
supplied at a ratio of 35 vol% and reacted to the outlet<br>
gas of the reactor in Example 1, to produce acrylic acid.<br>
In the respective reaction tubes, 1.2 L of the<br>
catalyst (B) was packed. Further, the reaction was<br>
carried out in the same manner as in Example 1 except<br>
that the temperature of the heating medium Hm was<br>
adjusted to 27 5°C.<br>
The average values of the maximum temperatures of<br>
the respective reaction tubes were 3 3 0°C in the reaction<br>
tube 1a, 300°C in the reaction tubes 1b and 300°C in the<br>
reaction tubes 1c. Further, in such a case, it was found<br>
that the conversion of the reaction was 99%, and the<br>
yield was 90.5% by calculation on the basis of propylene.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The same reactor as in Example 1 was used, and the<br>
catalyst (A) and ring inert obtained by molding an inert<br>
material (alumina), were mixed at 1:1 and packed in the<br>
reaction tubes from their inlets to the position of 1,500<br>
mm. In the rest of 1,800mm in the reaction tubes, only<br>
the catalyst (A) was packed, and in the residual 2 00 mm,<br>
aluminum balls inert to the present reaction were packed.<br>
Further, the reaction was carried out in the same<br>
manner as in Example 1 except that the temperature of the<br>
heating medium Hm was adjusted to 335°C. As thermometers<br>
to be used for measurement of the catalyst layers in the<br>
reaction tubes, ones having 15 measurement points were<br>
used, and the measurement was carried out at 200 mm<br>
intervals.<br>
The temperature distribution of the respective<br>
catalyst layers was measured, and it was found that the<br>
catalyst layers had two maximum temperatures.<br>
When they are shown as the primary maximum<br>
temperature and the secondary maximum temperature from<br>
the inlets of the reaction tubes, as for the respective<br>
average values, in the reaction tubes 1a, the primary<br>
maximum temperature was 393°C and the secondary maximum<br>
temperature was 345°C, in the reaction tubes 1b, the<br>
primary maximum temperature was 370°C and the secondary<br>
maximum temperature was 350°C, and in the reaction tubes<br>
1c, the primary maximum temperature was 365°C and the<br>
secondary maximum temperature was 380°C.<br>
In comparison with a case where the catalyst was not<br>
diluted, the temperature of the heating medium Hm was<br>
higher by 4°C. However, the respective maximum<br>
temperatures in the catalyst layers were lower by from 10<br>
to 2 0°C, even when the higher ones were compared. Thus,<br>
the result shows that an extension in the lifetime of the<br>
catalyst and constant operation can be expected.<br>
Further, the total yield of acrolein and acrylic<br>
acid obtained from propylene was found to be 92.5%.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
The reaction was carried out in the same manner as<br>
in Example 2 except that thermometers were not inserted<br>
in the reaction tubes 1a and 1c, but the same<br>
thermometers as in Example 1 were inserted in the<br>
reaction tubes 1b connected to all baffle plates and<br>
having a good heat removal efficiency.<br>
In order to bring the conversion of acrolein to be<br>
from 99% to 99.5%, the inlet temperature of the heating<br>
medium Hm was changed from 275 to 280°C, whereby the<br>
maximum value in the distribution of the temperature of<br>
the catalyst layers in the reaction tubes 1b became<br>
310°C.<br>
By analyzing the reaction product gas, the conversion<br>
of acrolein was measured, whereby the conversion rate was<br>
found as decreased to 97.9%. After that, the operation<br>
was continued, whereby the conversion gradually<br>
decreased. Therefore, the inlet temperature of the<br>
heating medium Hm was further raised by 2°C to 282°C,<br>
whereby the conversion of acrolein further decreased.<br>
When the conversion of acrolein decreased to 95%, the<br>
reaction was suspended to check the catalyst in the<br>
reaction tubes. No abnormality was observed in the<br>
catalyst in the reaction tubes 1b and 1c. However, among<br>
the reaction tubes 1a, particularly the catalyst in<br>
approximately 3 50 reaction tubes 1a disposed in the<br>
vicinity of the center of the reactor, was found to have<br>
been remarkably deteriorated and changed in the shape and<br>
have lost its catalytic activity. The catalyst was<br>
presumably exposed to a high temperature of at least<br>
400°C.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
In a process for catalytic vapor phase oxidation<br>
employing a multi-tubular reactor, according to the<br>
present invention, the inside temperature of the reaction<br>
tubes having a catalyst packed, disposed in the shell of<br>
the reactor, is measured and on the basis of this<br>
temperature, the temperature and flow rate of a heating<br>
medium introduced in the shell are controlled, whereby in<br>
the production of (meth)acrylic acid or the like from<br>
propylene or isobutylene, a runaway reaction or early<br>
deterioration of the catalyst can be prevented, and it<br>
becomes possible to produce it constantly in high yield<br>
for a long period of time.<br>
