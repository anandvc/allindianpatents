				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an image forming<br>
apparatus, and a lubricant applying device, a transfer<br>
device, a process cartridge, and toner used for an image<br>
carrier of the image forming apparatus.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Recently, there is an increasing requirement for<br>
forming high quality images. To obtain such images, a<br>
finer and highly spherical toner needs to be used. Polymer<br>
toners can be suitably used as finer and highly spherical<br>
toners.<br>
In the image forming apparatuses, excess toner that<br>
remains on the surface of a photoconductor after image<br>
formation is commonly cleaned with a cleaning means.<br>
However, as the toner becomes finer and more spherical, it<br>
becomes difficult to clean it. For example, a cleaning<br>
blade, which is a commonly used cleaning means, can not<br>
properly clean the excess toner. One approach is to more<br>
strongly press the cleaning blade against the surface of<br>
the photoconductor, however, the photoconductor can get<br>
damaged. Another approach is to apply a lubricant on the<br>
surface of the photoconductor. However, if the lubricant<br>
is not applied uniformly, the quality of the toner image<br>
can degrade.<br>
Somethimes both of the above approaches are employed.<br>
In that case there can be two options: apply a lubricant<br>
first and then clean excess toner, or clean excess toner<br><br>
first and then apply a lubricant. In Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2001-305907, the applicant<br>
of this application has proposed a method of cleaning<br>
excess toner first and then applying a lubricant. However,<br>
this technique does not take into account a fine, spherical,<br>
polymer toner.<br>
Various lubricants have been known. One of them is<br>
zinc stearate. It is common to use a solid rod made of<br>
zinc stearate, and use a brush roller to scrap zinc<br>
stearate from the rod and apply it to the photoconductor.<br>
A powdery lubricant can be used instead of a solid bar.<br>
However, a powdery lubricant has some disadvantageous. For<br>
example, in general, powders are difficult to manufacture<br>
and pack. Moreover, powdery lubricants can contaminate the<br>
environment.<br>
The amount of lubricant applied also plays an<br>
important role. If the lubricant applied is too less, the<br>
lubricant may not be applied uniformly, which leads to<br>
improper cleaning and wear of the cleaning blade. On the<br>
other hand, if the lubricant applied is too much, excess<br>
lubricant can make dirty the surface of a charging roller,<br>
or even can absorb moisture, which leads to flow of an<br>
electrostatic latent image. JP-A No. H10-260614 and JP-A<br>
No. 2003-57996 discloses a technique to determine the most<br>
appropriate amount of the lubricant.<br>
JP-A No. 2002-244485 describes a method of controlling<br>
the application amount of a lubricant based on image data<br>
information to improve cleaning capability of polymer toner.<br>
This method is the "the application after the cleaning",<br>
but it is different from the present invention in the way<br>
to smooth the application amount of the lubricant.<br>
JP-A No. 2000-330443 describes a method of uniformly<br>
applying a lubricant to improve cleaning capability of<br><br>
toner. This method is the "the application after the<br>
cleaning", but it is also different from the present<br>
invention in the way to smooth the application amount of<br>
the lubricant.<br>
JP-A No. 2000-172138 proposes an invention<br>
characterized in that an area applied with a lubricant in<br>
an axial direction of a photoconductor almost coincides<br>
with an area where a cleaning blade contacts the<br>
photoconductor. However, this invention is different from<br>
the present invention in a point how to configure the<br>
lubricant and the cleaning blade, and in another point<br>
whether a lubricant smoothing blade is provided.<br>

EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, the<br>
frictional coefficient of the surface of the photoconductor<br>
can be reduced stably over the whole area where the<br>
cleaning unit contacts the photoconductor. Therefore,<br>
image formation with high-resolution can be performed by<br>
maintaining satisfactory cleaning performance.<br>
According to anther aspect of the present invention,<br>
by applying the lubricant to the image carrier, the torque<br>
of the image carrier can be reduced, thereby providing an<br>
energy-saving machine. Moreover, the drive motor can be<br>
minimized, thereby providing a space-saving and low-cost<br>
machine.<br>
According to still anther aspect of the present<br>
invention, although the cleaning blade, the blade holder,<br>
and the lubricant applying device are provided, the whole<br>
configuration of the image forming apparatus can be<br>
downsized.<br>
According to still anther aspect of the present<br>
invention, the lubricant can be efficiently applied to the<br>
surface of the photoconductor over the long period of time.<br>
Moreover, the consumption amount of lubricant required for<br>
maintaining the frictional coefficient of the surface of<br>
the photoconductor to a fixed low value, can be reduced.<br>
Furthermore, the lubricant is set on the lower side of<br>
the brush roller, and the solid lubricant or the brush<br>
roller is caused to sway. Therefore, even if the contact<br>
pressure of the solid lubricant against the brush roller is<br>
increased to obtain a required application amount of the<br>
lubricant, the surface of the solid lubricant, which<br>
contacts the brush, does not become irregular caused by its<br><br>
uneven contact with the brush. This allows suppression of<br>
fluctuations in the application amount of the lubricant<br>
from the initial time to elapsed time.<br>
According to still anther aspect of the present<br>
invention, the transfer device in which the blade is not<br>
rolled-in at the initial stage can be provided. The<br>
process cartridge and the image forming apparatus according<br>
to the present invention can provide excellent images<br>
without the abnormal images due to cleaning failure of the<br>
photoconductor.<br><br>

BEST MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are<br>
explained in detail below with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings. It is noted that the present<br>
invention is not limited by these embodiments.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an image forming<br>
apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
The image forming apparatus includes an intermediate<br>
transfer belt 56 in an almost center thereof. The<br>
intermediate transfer belt 56 is an endless belt, which is<br>
made of a heat-resistant material such as polyimide and<br>
polyamide and includes a base body of which resistance is<br>
adjusted to medium resistance. The intermediate transfer<br>
belt 56 is supported by four rollers 52, 53, 54, and 55 by<br>
being wound around among these rollers, and is made to<br>
rotate in the direction of the arrow A. Four imaging units<br>
corresponding to colored toners of yellow (Y), magenta (M) ,<br>
cyan (C), and black (K) are aligned under the intermediate<br>
transfer belt 56 along the belt surface thereof.<br>
Fig. 18 is an enlarged diagram of one of the four<br>
imaging units, and of a conventional applying device, but<br>
the configuration thereof is basically the same as that<br>
according to present invention, and hence the schematic<br>
configuration of Fig. 18 is explained below. Because both<br>
the conventional imaging unit and the imaging unit<br>
according to the present invention are configured in the<br>
same manner, characters Y, M, C, and K indicating<br>
discrimination of the colors are omitted in Fig. 18<br><br>
although the imaging unit includes photoconductors 1Y, 1M,<br>
1C, and 1K in Fig. 1. Arranged around the photoconductor 1<br>
are a charging device 2 that charges the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1, a developing device 4 that develops a<br>
latent image formed on the surface of a photoconductor<br>
(image carrier) 1 with a colored toner to form a toner<br>
image, a lubricant applying device 3 that applies a<br>
lubricant to the surface of the photoconductor 1, and a<br>
cleaning device 8 that cleans the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 after the toner image is transferred.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, an exposing device 9 is provided<br>
under the four imaging units. The exposing device 9<br>
exposes the surface of the photoconductor 1 that is charged,<br>
based on image data for each color and forms a latent image.<br>
Primary transfer rollers 51 are arranged in positions<br>
each facing each photoconductor 1 across the intermediate<br>
transfer belt 56, and primarily transfer respective toner<br>
images formed on the photoconductors 1 to the intermediate<br>
transfer belt 56. The primary transfer roller 51 is<br>
connected to a power supply (not shown) and is applied with<br>
a predetermined voltage.<br>
A secondary transfer roller 61 is provided outside the<br>
portion of the intermediate transfer belt 56 supported by<br>
the roller 52 so as to be pressed against the roller 52.<br>
The secondary transfer roller 61 is connected to the power<br>
supply (not shown) and is applied with a predetermined<br>
voltage. A contact portion between the secondary transfer<br>
roller 61 and the intermediate transfer belt 56 is a<br>
secondary transfer portion, where the toner image on the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 56 is transferred to a transfer<br>
paper.<br>
An intermediate-transfer-belt cleaning device 57 is<br>
provided outside the portion of the intermediate transfer<br><br>
belt 56 supported by the roller 55. The intermediate-<br>
transfer-belt cleaning device 57 cleans the surface of the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 56 after the secondary transfer<br>
is performed.<br>
A fixing device 70 is provided above the secondary<br>
transfer portion, and fixes the toner image on the transfer<br>
paper semipermanently. The fixing device 70 includes an<br>
endless fixing belt 71 that is wound around between a<br>
heating roller 72 and a fixing roller 73, and a pressing<br>
roller 7 4 that is arranged so as to face the fixing roller<br>
73 through the fixing belt 71 and to be pressed against the<br>
fixing roller 73. The heating roller 72 includes a halogen<br>
heater.<br>
A paper feed device 20 storing sheets of transfer<br>
paper is provided in the lower side of the image forming<br>
apparatus, and feeds a sheet of transfer paper to the<br>
secondary transfer portion.<br>
The features of the image forming apparatus are<br>
explained in detail below with reference to Fig. 18.<br>
The photoconductor 1 is an organic photoconductor and<br>
has a surface protective layer that is formed with<br>
polycarbonate-base resin.<br>
The charging device 2 includes a charging roller 2a,<br>
being a charging element which is covered with an elastic<br>
layer having medium resistance and is provided outside a<br>
conductive core metal of the charging roller 2a. The<br>
charging roller 2a is connected to the power supply (not<br>
shown) and is applied with a predetermined voltage. The<br>
charging roller 2a is provided on the photoconductor 1 with<br>
a small space between the two. The small space can be set,<br>
for example, by winding a spacer element having a fixed<br>
thickness around both ends of the charging roller 2a which<br>
are non-image forming areas, and by bringing each surface<br><br>
of the spacer elements into contact with the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1. A charge cleaning element 2b is provided<br>
in the charging roller 2a, and contacts the surface of the<br>
charging roller 2a to clean the surface thereof.<br>
The developing device 4 includes a developing sleeve<br>
4a that is provided in a position facing the photoconductor<br>
1 and has a magnetic field generator. Provided in the<br>
lower side of the developing sleeve 4a are two screws 4b<br>
used to mix toner supplied from a toner bottle (not shown)<br>
with a developer and to suck it up to the developing sleeve<br>
4a while mixing them. The developer consisting of the<br>
toner and magnetic carrier sucked-up by the developing<br>
sleeve 4a forms a developer layer, of which thickness is<br>
restricted to a predetermined value by a doctor blade 4c,<br>
and the developer is carried on the developing sleeve 4a.<br>
The developing sleeve 4a carries and coveys the developer<br>
while rotating in the same direction as the photoconductor<br>
1 at a position opposite thereto, and supplies the toner to<br>
the surface of the latent image on the photoconductor 1.<br>
It is noted that the configuration of the developing<br>
device 4 of a two-component developing system is shown in<br>
Fig. 1, but the configuration is not limited thereto.<br>
Therefore, the present invention may also be applicable to<br>
even a developing device based on a one-component<br>
developing system.<br>
The lubricant applying device 3 includes a solid<br>
lubricant 3b accommodated in a case that is fixed, and a<br>
brush roller 3a that contacts the solid lubricant 3b,<br>
scrapes lubricant off, and applies the lubricant scraped-<br>
off to the photoconductor 1. The solid lubricant 3b is<br>
formed into a rectangular solid and is biased toward the<br>
side of the brush roller 3a by the pressing element 3c.<br>
The pressing element 3c may be any one of a plate spring, a<br><br>
compressed spring, and the like, and particularly, the<br>
compressed spring can be preferably used as shown in Fig.<br>
18. The solid lubricant 3b is scraped off by the brush<br>
roller 3a and consumed, so that its thickness is reduced<br>
over time, but since the solid lubricant 3b is pressed by<br>
the pressing element 3c, the solid lubricant 3b is always<br>
in contact with the brush roller 3a. The brush roller 3a<br>
scrapes the lubricant while rotating, and applies it to the<br>
surface of the photoconductor 1.<br>
In the present invention, the lubricant applying<br>
device 3 is provided at the outside on the downstream side<br>
of the cleaning device 8 as explained below with reference<br>
to Fig. 2.<br>
The configuration of the cleaning device 8 according<br>
to a first embodiment of the present invention is explained<br>
below with reference to Fig. 2.<br>
The cleaning device 8 includes a cleaning blade 8a and<br>
a support element 8c. The cleaning blade 8a is formed with<br>
plate-like rubber such as urethane rubber and silicone<br>
rubber, and is provided so that the edge thereof contacts<br>
the surface of the photoconductor 1, thereby removing toner<br>
remaining on the photoconductor 1 after a toner image is<br>
transferred. The cleaning blade 8a and a lubricant<br>
smoothing blade 3e are bonded to and supported by the<br>
support element 8c and a support element 3g, respectively,<br>
which are made of metal, plastic, ceramic, or the like.<br>
The cleaning blade 8a and the lubricant smoothing blade 3e<br>
are arranged roughly at each angle as shown in Fig. 2 with<br>
respect to the surface of the photoconductor 1, which is<br>
explained in detail later.<br>
The lubricant applying device 3 is provided at the<br>
outside on the downstream side of the cleaning device 8,<br>
and the cleaning blade 8a is arranged on the upstream side<br><br>
in the direction of movement of the photoconductor 1 and<br>
the lubricant smoothing blade 3e is arranged on the<br>
downstream side in the same direction as above.<br>
The remaining toner on the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 is removed by the cleaning blade 8a, and<br>
the surface thereof is cleaned. The lubricant applying<br>
device 3 applies the lubricant to the surface of the<br>
phdtoconductor 1 thus cleaned, and then the lubricant<br>
smoothing blade 3e slides along the surface thereof to<br>
spread the lubricant, thereby forming a thin layer of the<br>
lubricant on the surface of the photoconductor 1.<br>
Moreover, the lubricant applying device 3 not only<br>
applies the lubricant to the surface of the photoconductor<br>
1 but also can be used as a device that applies the<br>
lubricant to the surface of the intermediate transfer belt<br>
56 of Fig.. 1. In this case, the lubricant applying device<br>
3 can be arranged next to the intermediate-transfer-belt<br>
cleaning device 57, or can be included in the intermediate-<br>
transfer-belt cleaning device 57. The lubricant applying<br>
device 3 is provided on the upstream side of the<br>
intermediate-transfer-belt cleaning device 57 in the<br>
direction of movement of the intermediate transfer belt 56,<br>
and applies the lubricant to the surface of the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 56. The cleaning blade included<br>
in the intermediate-transfer-belt cleaning device 57<br>
spreads the lubricant applied, thereby forming a thin layer<br>
of the lubricant. Consequently, adherents such as toner<br>
can be cleaned satisfactorily. More specifically, the<br>
toner remains on the surface of the intermediate transfer<br>
belt 56 without being secondarily transferred at a nip<br>
portion between the secondary transfer roller 61 and the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 56.<br>
Furthermore, a process cartridge integrally supports<br><br>
the lubricant applying device 3, the photoconductor 1, and<br>
any unit selected from the charging device 2, the<br>
developing device 4, and the cleaning device 8. The<br>
process cartridge is detachably mounted on the main unit of<br>
the image forming apparatus. If the lubricant applying<br>
device 3 is integrated with the cleaning device 8 in the<br>
process cartridge, as already explained above, the<br>
lubricant applying device 3 is installed on the downstream<br>
side of the cleaning blade 8a in the movement direction of<br>
the photoconductor 1. The process cartridge allows the<br>
cleaning performance of the surface of the photoconductor 1<br>
to be maintained over a long period of time and the<br>
degradation of image quality to be prevented.<br>
The lubricant applying device 3 is explained below<br>
more specifically. Fig. 2 is a partially enlarged diagram<br>
of neighborhood of the lubricant applying device 3<br>
according to the first embodiment. The lubricant applying<br>
device 3 is provided at outside on the downstream side of<br>
the cleaning device 8 for the photoconductor, and includes<br>
the solid lubricant 3b and the brush roller 3a being a<br>
brush-like element for applying the solid lubricant 3b to<br>
the photoconductor 1. The solid lubricant 3b is obtained<br>
by dissolving a lubricating-oil additive that contains zinc<br>
stearate as a main component, and then cooling and<br>
solidifying it to be molded into a bar. The solid<br>
lubricant 3b is held by a lubricant holding element 3d, and<br>
is pressed against the brush roller 3a by a pressing spring<br>
fixed to a housing 3f of the lubricant applying device 3,<br>
through the lubricant holding element 3d. The brush roller<br>
3a is provided so as to be in contact with the<br>
photoconductor 1, and scrapes the solid lubricant 3b by<br>
rotation of the brush roller 3a to be adhered to the brush<br>
roller 3a. The lubricant adhered to the brush roller 3a is<br><br>
applied to the surface of the photoconductor 1 from a<br>
contact portion of the brush roller 3a with the<br>
photoconductor 1. Then, the lubricant is smoothed by the<br>
lubricant smoothing blade 3e.<br>
As the solid lubricant 3b, a dry solid hydrophobic<br>
lubricant can be used, and zinc stearate and other<br>
components including a stearic acid group as follows can be<br>
used, that is, barium stearate, lead stearate, iron<br>
stearate, nickel stearate, cobalt stearate, copper stearate,<br>
strontium stearate, calcium stearate, cadmium stearate, and<br>
magnesium stearate. The dry solid hydrophobic lubricant<br>
may also include zinc oleate, manganese oleate, iron oleate,<br>
cobalt oleate, lead oleate, magnesium oleate, and copper<br>
oleate, which are included in the same fatty acid group;<br>
and zinc palmitate, cobalt palmitate, copper palmitate,<br>
magnesium palmitate, aluminum palmitate, and calcium<br>
palmitate. In addition to these, the dry solid hydrophobic<br>
lubricant also includes fatty acids and metal salts of<br>
fatty acids such as lead caprylate, lead caproate, zinc<br>
linoleate, cobalt linoleate, calcium linoleate, and cadmium<br>
ricolinoleate. Furthermore, waxes such as candelilla wax,<br>
carnauba wax, rice wax, Japan tallow, jojoba oil, bees wax,<br>
and lanoline can be used.<br>
The features of the first embodiment are explained<br>
below. In this embodiment, the cleaning blade 8a, being a<br>
cleaning unit, is made to contact the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 on the upstream side in the movement<br>
direction of the photoconductor 1 with respect to the zone<br>
where the lubricant is applied by the brush roller 3a. And<br>
the lubricant smoothing blade 3e, being a lubricant<br>
smoothing unit, is made to contact the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 on the downstream side in the direction of<br>
its movement with respect to the zone where the lubricant<br><br>
is applied. Furthermore, in the first embodiment, as shown<br>
in Fig. 2, the cleaning blade 8a is made to contact the<br>
surface of the photoconductor 1 in the counter direction,<br>
and the lubricant smoothing blade 3e is made to contact the<br>
surface of the photoconductor 1 in the trailing direction.<br>
These cleaning blade 8a and lubricant smoothing blade 3e<br>
are made of rubber that is an elastic body.<br>
The toner image carried on the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 is transferred to a transfer material, and<br>
then the toner remaining thereon is first removed by the<br>
cleaning blade 8a. Thereby, the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 becomes clean, and is contacted by the<br>
brush roller 3a, so that the lubricant is applied to the<br>
surface thereof. The surface of the lubricant applied is<br>
smoothed to be uniformly spread when passing through the<br>
zone where the lubricant contacts the lubricant smoothing<br>
blade 3e that is provided on the downstream side in the<br>
movement direction of the surface of the photoconductor 1,<br>
thereby forming a layer of the lubricant having a uniform<br>
thickness.<br>
In the image forming apparatus according to the<br>
present invention, an "area applied with the lubricant"<br>
means an area where the lubricant is spread by the<br>
lubricant smoothing blade 3e and a lubricant layer having<br>
the uniform thickness is formed. The area applied with the<br>
lubricant "covers" an "area cleaned by the cleaning blade"<br>
or a contact portion of the cleaning blade 8a with the<br>
photoconductor 1. Consequently, the frictional coefficient<br>
of the photoconductor 1 can be reduced stably over the<br>
whole area where the cleaning blade 8a contacts the<br>
photoconductor 1. Even if toner such as polymer toner of<br>
which circularity is high (0.95 or higher) and the toner is<br>
difficult to be cleaned by the blade, cleaning performance<br><br>
can be kept satisfactory.<br>
In the image forming apparatus according to the<br>
present invention, the "area applied with the lubricant",<br>
that is, the area where the lubricant is spread by the<br>
lubricant smoothing blade 3e and the lubricant layer having<br>
the uniform thickness is formed, is substantially same as<br>
the "area cleaned by the cleaning blade" or the contact<br>
portion of the cleaning blade 8a with the photoconductor 1.<br>
Consequently, the frictional coefficient of the<br>
photoconductor 1 can be reduced stably over the whole area<br>
where the cleaning blade 8a contacts the photoconductor 1,<br>
and cleaning performance can be kept satisfactory.<br>
In the image forming apparatus according to the<br>
present invention, the cleaning blade 8a is provided on the<br>
upstream side of the lubricant applying device 3 in the<br>
direction of rotation of the photoconductor 1, and the<br>
lubricant smoothing blade 3e is provided on the downstream<br>
side in the same direction as above. Longitudinal widths<br>
of these blades in contact with the photoconductor 1 have a<br>
relation of "width of applying brush roller"
lubricant smoothing blade". More specifically, when the<br>
width of the lubricant smoothing blade 3e is equal to or<br>
larger than the width of the brush roller 3a of Fig. 2, the<br>
whole lubricant applied by the brush roller 3a along the<br>
longitudinal direction of the photoconductor 1 can be<br>
spread by the lubricant smoothing blade 3e, to form a layer<br>
of the lubricant having the uniform thickness. Accordingly,<br>
the charging device 2 can be prevented from contamination<br>
due to the lubricant.<br>
In the image forming apparatus according to the<br>
present invention, longitudinal widths as follows in<br>
contact with the photoconductor 1 have a relation of "width<br>
of lubricant'^'width of applying brush roller". More<br><br>
specifically, when the width of the brush roller 3a is<br>
equal to or larger than the width of the solid lubricant 3b<br>
of Fig. 2, the following effect can be obtained.<br>
If the brush is shorter than the lubricant, the<br>
lubricant is scraped in a U shape, and both edges of the<br>
lubricant touch a brush shaft. Therefore, the lubricant<br>
cannot be used to the last portion, and this causes the<br>
amount of waste to be increased or causes the bristle<br>
length of the brush to be restricted. In this case, if the<br>
bristle length of the brush is shorter, then the lubricant<br>
is more wasted.<br>
Therefore, the present invention has such a<br>
configuration as "width of lubricant"
brush roller", thereby using the lubricant without waste,<br>
and hence, there is no need to restrict the bristle length<br>
of the brush.<br>
The image forming apparatus according to the present<br>
invention has a relation of "width of charged area"
of applied lubricant" in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
photoconductor 1. More specifically, when the width of the<br>
lubricant smoothing blade 3e (Fig. 2) is equal to or larger<br>
than the width of the charging roller 2a (Fig. 18), the<br>
whole range of a contact area of the photoconductor 1 with<br>
the charging roller 2a is uniformly applied with the<br>
lubricant, and the frictional coefficient of the<br>
photoconductor 1 can be reduced stably in all over the<br>
contact area, thereby obtaining the following effect.<br>
A very small amount of the lubricant that is supposed<br>
to be applied to the photoconductor shifts to the surface<br>
of the charging roller when the charging roller contacts<br>
the photoconductor. Even if the charging roller does not<br>
contact the photoconductor, it may also shift thereto by<br>
the action of the electric field. If the adhesion amount<br><br>
of the lubricant to the surface of the charging roller due<br>
to the shift is not uniform on the surface of the charging<br>
roller, a charge amount (potential) on the photoconductor<br>
becomes also nonuniform. By employing the configuration<br>
according to the present invention, the lubricant is<br>
uniformly applied over the whole range of the contact area<br>
of the photoconductor 1 with the charging roller 2a, and<br>
the amount of lubricant shifted to the surface of the<br>
charging roller does not become nonuniform in the axial<br>
direction of the charging roller, which allows stable<br>
charging.<br>
In the first embodiment, the cleaning blade 8a is used<br>
to clean the surface of the photoconductor 1, but instead<br>
of the cleaning blade 8a, a cleaning brush may be used.<br>
The cleaning brush is obtained by applying bias to a<br>
conductive brush having a resistance between a medium<br>
resistance and a low resistance.<br>
However, the present invention is not limited by the<br>
first embodiment, and is applicable to all devices using<br>
the technological principle of the present invention. The<br>
photoconductor or the intermediate transfer element may be<br>
either the belt shape or the roller shape.<br>
In the image forming apparatus according to the<br>
present invention, the frictional coefficient U on the<br>
image carrier 1 is set to 0.4 or less. If JJ. is greater<br>
than 0.4, occurrence of the filming cannot be sufficiently<br>
prevented.<br>
The frictional coefficient of the photoconductor 1 was<br>
measured by using an Euler belt method in the following<br>
manner. Fig. 4 is a diagram for explaining how to measure<br>
a frictional coefficient of the photoconductor 1. In this<br>
case, good quality paper with a medium thickness is used as<br>
a belt. This paper is suspended around 1/4 of a drum<br><br>
circumference of the photoconductor 1 so that the paper is<br>
set in its longitudinal direction, and a weight of, for<br>
example, 0.98 N (100 gr) is suspended at one end of the<br>
belt, and a force gauge (digital push-pull gauge) is<br>
provided at the other end thereof. The force gauge is<br>
pulled, and when the belt moves, the weight is read to<br>
calculate a frictional coefficient by substituting the<br>
weight read in an equation: frictional coefficient<br>
u=2/7txln (F/0.98) (where \i: static frictional coefficient,<br>
F: measured value). The frictional coefficient of the<br>
photoconductor 1 is a value when the photoconductor 1<br>
enters into a steady state after image formation. This is<br>
because the frictional coefficient of the photoconductor 1<br>
is affected by another device also provided in the image<br>
forming apparatus, and hence the value, out of other values,<br>
of the frictional coefficient immediately after image<br>
formation changes first. However, after image formation of<br>
about 1,000 sheets of A4 recording paper, the value of the<br>
frictional coefficient becomes an almost fixed value.<br>
Therefore, the frictional coefficient mentioned here is a<br>
frictional coefficient when the frictional coefficient<br>
becomes a fixed value in this steady state.<br>
In the image forming apparatus according to the<br>
present invention, the cleaning blade has a side seal for<br>
preventing toner scattering, and the side seal allows<br>
adjustment of an area applied with the lubricant. In Fig.<br>
3, a side seal 11 is provided in both ends of the cleaning<br>
blade 8a in its width direction to contact the<br>
photoconductor 1, and the contact positions of the side<br>
seals 11 are adjusted in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
photoconductor 1, thereby adjusting the area applied with<br>
the lubricant. Therefore, if the lubricant is applied<br>
beyond the cleaning area, the area applied with the<br><br>
lubricant can be adjusted only by adjusting the positions<br>
of the side seals 11. This allows achievement of the<br>
object of the present invention such that the frictional<br>
coefficient of the photoconductor is reduced stably over<br>
the whole area of the photoconductor which the cleaning<br>
blade 8a contacts.<br>
Even if the toner as follows is used, satisfactory<br>
cleaning capability can be obtained. The toner has a small<br>
particle size such that a volume-average particle size of<br>
toner particles is 3 to 8 micrometers and a ratio (Dv/Dn)<br>
between a volume-average particle size (Dv) and a number-<br>
average particle size (Dn) is in a range from 1.00 to 1.40,<br>
and has a narrow particle size distribution. By narrowing<br>
the particle size distribution of toner particles, a charge<br>
amount distribution becomes uniform, thereby obtaining a<br>
high quality image with less background fogging, and<br>
increasing a transfer rate. Such toner of a small particle<br>
size is difficult to be cleaned by the conventional blade<br>
method because the cleaning force does not exceed the<br>
adhesion force of the toner to the photoconductor 1.<br>
Furthermore, if toner particles are small sized, the<br>
percentage of external-additive particles in the toner<br>
particles tends to be relatively high, and hence, the<br>
external-additive particles easily drop out from the toner<br>
particles, which causes filming to occur on the<br>
photoconductor 1. However, by using the cleaning device 8<br>
of the present invention, the brush roller 3a applies the<br>
lubricant to the surface of the photoconductor 1 to reduce<br>
the frictional coefficient of the photoconductor 1, and the<br>
cleaning blade 8a blocks the toner particles, to prevent<br>
them from their slipping through the cleaning blade 8a,<br>
thereby improving the cleaning performance.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is suitable for<br><br>
cleaning of spherical toner. The spherical toner particle<br>
can be defined by values of the shape factor SF-1 and the<br>
shape factor SF-2 as follows. The toner particles used in<br>
the image forming apparatus of the present invention are<br>
such that the shape factor SF-1 is from 100 to 180 and the<br>
shape factor SF-2 is from 100 to 180.<br>
Fig. 5A and Fig. 5B are schematic diagrams of toner<br>
shapes for explaining the shape factor SF-1 and the shape<br>
factor SF-2. The shape factor SF-1 represents the degree<br>
of sphericity of a toner shape, and is expressed by the<br>
following expression (1). The shape factor SF-1 is a value<br>
obtained by dividing the square of a maximum length MXLNG<br>
of a shape, which is obtained by projecting a toner<br>
particle onto a two-dimensional plane, by its graphics area<br>
AREA, and by multiplying the quotient by 100 π/4.<br>
SF-1={ (MXLNG) 2/AREA}x (100 π/4)	(1)<br>
If the value of SF-1 is 100, the shape of toner<br>
becomes perfect sphericity, and the shape becomes more and<br>
more irregular as the value of SF-1 rises.<br>
The shape factor SF-2 represents the degree of<br>
irregularities of a toner shape, and is expressed by the<br>
following expression (2). The shape factor SF-2 is a value<br>
obtained by dividing the square of a peripheral length PERI<br>
of a shape, which is obtained by projecting a toner<br>
particle onto a two-dimensional plane, by its graphics area<br>
AREA, and by multiplying the quotient by 100 π/4.<br>
SF-2={ (PERI) 2/AREA}x (100 π/4)	(2)<br>
If the value of SF-2 is 100, the surface of toner has<br>
no irregularities, and the surface becomes more and more<br>
irregular as the value of SF-2 rises.<br>
The shape factor was measured specifically by<br>
photographing a toner particle with a scanning electron<br><br>
microscope (S-800: manufactured by Hitachi Ltd.),<br>
introducing the photograph into an image analyzer (LUZEX3:<br>
manufactured by Nireco Corp.), and analyzing and<br>
calculating it.<br>
If the toner has a high sphericity, a contact between<br>
a toner particle and a toner particle or between a toner<br>
particle and the photoconductor 1 becomes a point contact,<br>
which causes an attracting force between the toner<br>
particles to get weak. Therefore, fluidity becomes higher<br>
as the attracting force gets weaker. The attracting force<br>
between a toner particle and the photoconductor 1 also gets<br>
weak, and as a result, a transfer ratio becomes high. As<br>
explained above, the spherical toner is easy to cause<br>
cleaning failure in the cleaning using the blade method,<br>
but by using the cleaning device 8 according to the present<br>
invention, satisfactory cleaning can be performed. If the<br>
SF-1 and the SF-2 are too large, toner scatters over an<br>
image, and image quality is thereby degraded, and hence, it<br>
is preferable that the SF-1 and the SF-2 do not exceed 180.<br>
The shape of the toner according to the present<br>
invention is substantially spherical, and can be expressed<br>
by the following shape definition.<br>
Fig. 6A, Fig. 6B, and Fig. 6C are schematic diagrams<br>
of the shape of the toner according to the present<br>
invention. As shown in Fig. 6A to Fig. 6C, assume that a<br>
substantially spherical toner is defined by a major axis rl,<br>
a minor axis r2, and a thickness r3 (where rl &gt; r2 &gt; r3) .<br>
The toner particle according to the present invention<br>
preferably ranges as follows: a ratio between the minor<br>
axis and the major axis (r2/rl) (see Fig. 6B) ranges from<br>
0.5 to 1.0, and a ratio between the thickness and the minor<br>
axis (r3/r2) (see Fig. 6C) ranges from 0.7 to 1.0. If the<br>
ratio between the minor axis and the major axis (r2/rl) is<br><br>
less than 0.5, the toner shape is not close to the perfect<br>
sphericity, and hence, dot reproducibility and transfer<br>
efficiency are degraded, and a high quality image cannot be<br>
obtained. If the ratio between the thickness and the minor<br>
axis (r3/r2) is less than 0.7, the toner shape is close to<br>
a flat shape, and hence, a high transfer rate as that of<br>
the spherical toner cannot be obtained. Particularly, if<br>
the ratio between the thickness and the minor axis (r3/r2)<br>
is 1.0, the toner becomes a "rotating body" with its major<br>
axis as a rotational axis, thereby improving the fluidity<br>
of toner.<br>
The rl, r2, and r3 were measured by observing and<br>
photographing a toner particle with a scanning electron<br>
microscope (SEM) while changing an angle of a visual field.<br>
The toner adequately used in the image forming<br>
apparatus according to the present invention is obtained by<br>
allowing a toner material solution to undergo crosslinking<br>
reaction and/or elongation reaction in an aqueous medium.<br>
More specifically, the toner material solution is obtained<br>
by dissolving or dispersing at least a polyester prepolymer<br>
having a functional group that contains nitrogen atoms, a<br>
polyester, a colorant, and a release agent, in an organic<br>
solvent. Materials of and a method of manufacturing toner<br>
are explained below.<br>
Modified Polyester:<br>
The toner of the present invention contains modified<br>
polyester (i) as a binder resin. The modified polyester<br>
(i) means a bond group other than ester bonds exists in<br>
polyester resin, or in which resin components of which<br>
structure is different are bonded by covalent bond or ionic<br>
bond in polyester resin. More specifically, the modified<br>
polyester (i) is a functional group such as an isocyanate<br><br>
group that reacts with a carboxylic acid group and a<br>
hydroxyl group is introduced to polyester end, and is made<br>
to react with an active-hydrogen-containing compound to<br>
modify the polyester end.<br>
Examples of the modified polyester (i) include a urea-<br>
. modified polyester obtained by reaction between an<br>
isocyanate group-containing polyester prepolymer (A) and an<br>
amine group (B), and the like. Examples of the isocyanate<br>
group-containing polyester prepolymer (A) include reaction<br>
products of a polyester with a polyisocyanate compound<br>
(PIC), and the like. More specifically, the polyester is a<br>
polycondensation product between a polyhydric alcohol (PO)<br>
and a polycarboxylic acid (PC), and has an active hydrogen<br>
group. Examples of the active hydrogen group of the<br>
polyester are hydroxyl groups such as an alcoholic hydroxyl<br>
group and a phenolic hydroxyl group, an amino group, a<br>
carboxyl group, a mercapto group, and the like. Among them,<br>
the alcoholic hydroxyl group is preferred.<br>
The urea-modified polyester is produced in the<br>
following manner.<br>
Examples of polyhydric alcohol compounds (PO) include<br>
dihydric alcohol (DIO) and trihydric or more alcohols (TO) ;<br>
and dihydric alcohol (DIO) alone or a mixture of dihydric<br>
alcohol (DIO) with a small amount of trihydric alcohol (TO)<br>
is preferable. Examples of dihydric alcohol (DIO) include<br>
alkylene glycol (e.g. ethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol,<br>
1,3-propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, and 1,6-hexanediol) ;<br>
alkylene ether glycols (e.g. diethylene glycol, triethylene<br>
glycol, dipropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol,<br>
polypropylene glycol, and polytetramethylene ether glycol);<br>
alicyclic diols (e.g. 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol, and<br>
hydrogenated bisphenol A); bisphenols (e.g. bisphenol A,<br>
bisphenol F, and bisphenol S); adducts of alkylene Oxide Of<br><br>
the alicyclic diols (e.g. ethylene oxide, propylene oxide,<br>
and butylene oxide); and adducts of alkylene oxide of the<br>
bisphenols (e.g. ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and<br>
butylene oxide). Among these, alkylene glycol having a<br>
carbon number from 2 to 12 and the adducts of alkylene<br>
oxides of the bisphenols are preferable. Particularly<br>
preferable are the adducts of alkylene oxides of the<br>
bisphenols, and a combination of the adducts of alkylene<br>
oxides of the bisphenols and alkylene glycol having a<br>
carbon number from 2 to 12. Trihydric or more alcohols<br>
(TO) include trihydric to octahydric alcohols and more<br>
aliphatic alcohols (e.g. glycerol, trimethylolethane,<br>
trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, and sorbitol);<br>
trivalent or more phenols (e.g. trisphenol PA, phenol<br>
novolak, and cresol novolak); and adducts of alkylene<br>
oxides of the trivalent or more polyphenols.<br>
Examples of a polyvalent carboxylic acid (PC) include<br>
a divalent carboxylic acid (DIC) and a trivalent or more<br>
carboxylic acid (TC). The divalent carboxylic acid (DIC)<br>
alone and a mixture of the divalent carboxylic acid (DIC)<br>
and a small amount of the trivalent or more carboxylic acid<br>
(TC) are preferable. Examples of divalent carboxylic acids<br>
(DIC) include alkylene dicarboxylic acids (e.g. succinic<br>
acid, adipic acid, and sebacic acid); alkenylene<br>
dicarboxylic acids (e.g. maleic acid and fumaric acid); and<br>
aromatic dicarboxylic acids (e.g. phthalic acid,<br>
isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, and naphthalene<br>
dicarboxylic acid). Among these, the alkenylene<br>
dicarboxylic acids having a carbon number from 4 to 20 and<br>
the aromatic dicarboxylic acids having a carbon number from<br>
8 to 20 are preferred. Examples of trivalent or more<br>
carboxylic acids (TC) include aromatic polyvalent<br>
carboxylic acids having a carbon number from 9 to 20 (e.g.<br><br>
trimellitic acid and pyromellitic acid). The polyvalent<br>
carboxylic acid (PC) may be reacted with polyhydric alcohol<br>
(PO) using acid anhydrides of these or lower alkyl esters<br>
(e.g. methyl ester, ethyl ester, and isopropyl ester).<br>
A ratio between the polyhydric alcohol (PO) and the<br>
polyvalent carboxylic acid (PC) is usually from 2/1 to 1/1,<br>
preferably from 1.5/1 to 1/1, more preferably from 1.3/1 to<br>
1.02/1, as an equivalent ratio of [OH]/[COOH] between a<br>
hydroxy1 group [OH] and a carboxyl group [COOH].<br>
Examples of polyvalent isocyanate compounds (PIC) are<br>
aliphatic polyvalent isocyanates (e.g. tetramethylene<br>
diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, and 2,6-<br>
diisocyanate methyl caproate); alicyclic polyisocyanates<br>
(e.g. isophorone diisocyanate and cyclohexylmethane<br>
diisocyanate); aromatic diisocyanates (e.g. tolylene<br>
diisocyanate and diphenylmethane diisocyanate); aromatic<br>
aliphatic diisocyanates (e.g. a,a,cc',a'-<br>
tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate); isocyanates; compounds<br>
formed by blocking these polyisocyanates by a phenol<br>
derivative, an oxime, and a caprolactam; and a combination<br>
of at least two of these.<br>
A ratio of the polyvalent isocyanate compounds (PIC)<br>
is usually from 5/1 to 1/1, preferably from 4/1 to 1.2/1,<br>
and more preferably from 2.5/1 to 1.5/1, as an equivalent<br>
ratio of [NCO]/[OH] between an isocyanate group [NCO] and a<br>
hydroxyl group [OH] of a hydroxy1 group-containing<br>
polyester. When [NCO]/[OH] exceeds 5, the low-temperature<br>
fixing property gets worse. In a case of using urea-<br>
modified polyester, the urea content in the ester becomes<br>
low when a molar ratio of [NCO] is less than 1, and hot<br>
offset resistance deteriorates.<br>
The content of the polyvalent isocyanate compound<br>
(PIC) in the isocyanate group-containing polyester<br><br>
prepolymer (A) ranges usually from 0.5 wt.% to 40 wt.%,<br>
preferably from 1 wt.% to 30 wt.%, and more preferably from<br>
2 wt.% to 20 wt.%. If the content of the polyvalent<br>
isocyanate compound is less than 0.5 wt.%, the hot offset<br>
resistance deteriorates, and it is unfavorable from the<br>
viewpoint of compatibility of heat resistant preservability<br>
and low-temperature fixing property. On the other hand, if<br>
the content of the polyvalent isocyanate compound exceeds<br>
40 wt.%, the low-temperature fixing property gets worse.<br>
The number of isocyanate groups contained in one<br>
molecule of the isocyanate group-containing polyester<br>
prepolymer (A) is usually at least 1, preferably, an<br>
average of 1.5 to 3, and more preferably, an average of 1.8<br>
to 2.5. If the isocyanate group per molecule is less than<br>
1, then the molecular weight of the urea-modified polyester<br>
becomes low and the hot offset resistance deteriorates.<br>
Further, amines (B) that are reacted with the<br>
polyester prepolymer (A) include divalent amine compounds<br>
(Bl), trivalent or more amine compounds (B2), amino<br>
alcohols (B3), amino mercaptans (B4), amino acids (B5), and<br>
the compounds (B6) of Bl to B5 in which their amino groups<br>
are blocked.<br>
Examples of the divalent amine compounds (Bl) include<br>
aromatic diamines (e.g. phenylene diamine, diethyl toluene<br>
diamine, and 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl methane); alicyclic<br>
diamines (e.g. 4,4'-diamino-3,3'-<br>
dimethyldicyclohexylmethane, diamine cyclohexane, and<br>
isophorone diamine); and aliphatic diamines (e.g. ethylene<br>
diamine, tetramethylene diamine, and hexamethylene diamine).<br>
Examples of the trivalent or more amine compounds (B2)<br>
include diethylene triamine and triethylene tetramine.<br>
Examples of the amino alcohols (B3) include ethanolamine<br>
and hydroxyethylaniline. Examples of the amino mercaptans<br><br>
(B4) include aminoethyl mercaptan and aminopropyl mercaptan.<br>
Examples of the amino acids (B5) include aminopropionic<br>
acid and aminocaproic acid. Examples of the compounds (B6),<br>
in which the amino groups of Bl to B5 are blocked, include<br>
ketimine compounds obtained from the amines of Bl to B5 and<br>
ketones (e.g. acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and methyl<br>
isobutyl ketone), and oxazolidine compounds. The<br>
preferable amines among the amines (B) are Bl and a mixture<br>
of Bl with a small amount of B2.<br>
A ratio of amines (B) is usually 1/2 to 2/1,<br>
preferably 1.5/1 to 1/1.5, and more preferably 1.2/1 to<br>
1/1.2 as an equivalent ratio of [NCO]/[NHx] between an<br>
isocyanate group [NCO] in the isocyanate group-containing<br>
polyester prepolymer (A) and an amine group [NHx] in the<br>
amines (B). When [NCO]/[NHx] exceeds 2 or is less than 1/2,<br>
the molecular weight of the urea-modified polyester becomes<br>
smaller, resulting in deterioration in hot offset<br>
resistance.<br>
Moreover, an urethane bond may be contained together<br>
with an urea bond in the urea-modified polyester. A molar<br>
ratio of the urea bond content and the urethane bond<br>
content ranges usually from 100/0 to 10/90, preferably from<br>
80/20 to 20/80, and more preferably from 60/40 to 30/70.<br>
If the molar ratio of the urea bond is less than 10%, the<br>
hot offset resistance deteriorates.<br>
The modified polyester (i) used in the present<br>
invention is manufactured by a one shot method and a<br>
prepolymer method. The weight-average molecular weight of<br>
the modified polyester (i) is usually not less than 10,000,<br>
preferably 20,000 to 10,000,000, and more preferably 30,000<br>
to 1,000,000. The peak molecular weight at this time is<br>
preferably 1,000 to 10,000, and when it is less than 1,000,<br>
the modified polyester (i) is not easily elongated and the<br><br>
elasticity of toner is low, resulting in deterioration in<br>
the hot offset resistance. When it exceeds 10,000, tasks<br>
in manufacturing such as reduction of fixing property,<br>
smaller particle, and pulverization are more difficult to<br>
achieve. A number-average molecular weight of the modified<br>
polyester (i) is not particularly limited when a native<br>
polyester (ii) explained later is used, and the number-<br>
average molecular weight should be one which is easily<br>
obtained to get a weight-average molecular weight. When<br>
the modified polyester (i) is used alone, the number-<br>
average molecular weight is usually 20,000 or less,<br>
preferably 1,000 to 10,000, and more preferably 2,000 to<br>
8,000. When the number-average molecular weight exceeds<br>
20,000, the low-temperature fixing property deteriorates<br>
and the glossiness also deteriorates when used for full-<br>
color apparatus.<br>
A reaction inhibitor is used as required for<br>
crosslinking reaction between a polyester prepolymer (A)<br>
and amines (B) to obtain the modified polyester (i) and/or<br>
elongation reaction, thereby adjusting the molecular weight<br>
of the urea-modified polyester obtained. Examples of the<br>
reaction inhibitor include monoamines (e.g., diethylamine,<br>
dibutylamine, butylamine, and laurylamine), and compounds<br>
(ketimine compounds) in which the monoamines are blocked.<br>
Native Polyester:<br>
In the present invention, the modified polyester (i)<br>
can be used alone, and also a native polyester (ii) can be<br>
contained together with (i) as a binder resin component.<br>
By using (i) in combination with the native polyester (ii) ,<br>
the low-temperature fixing property is improved and the<br>
glossiness is also improved when used for full-color<br>
apparatus, which is more preferable than a single use of<br><br>
(i). Examples of the native polyester (ii) include<br>
polycondensation of polyhydric alcohol (PO) and polyvalent<br>
carboxylic acid (PC), similarly to the polyester component<br>
of (i), and preferred compounds are also the same as (i).<br>
The native polyester (ii) may be not only a native<br>
polyester but also modified one through a chemical bond<br>
other than an urea bond, for example, (ii) may be modified<br>
with an urethane bond. It is preferable that at least<br>
parts of (i) and (ii) are compatible with each other, from<br>
viewpoint of low-temperature fixing property and hot offset<br>
resistance. Therefore, polyester components of (i) and<br>
(ii) have preferably similar compositions. A weight ratio<br>
between (i) and (ii) when (ii) is contained is usually 5/95<br>
to 80/20, preferably 5/95 to 30/70, more preferably 5/95 to<br>
25/75, and particularly preferably 7/93 to 20/80. When the<br>
weight ratio of (i) to (ii) is less than 5%, the hot offset<br>
resistance deteriorates, and this becomes disadvantageous<br>
in respect of compatibility between heat resistant<br>
preservability and low-temperature fixing property.<br>
The peak molecular weight of (ii) is usually 1,000 to<br>
10,000, preferably 2,000 to 8,000, and more preferably<br>
2,000 to 5,000. When it is less than 1,000, heat resistant<br>
preservability deteriorates, and when it exceeds 10,000,<br>
low-temperature fixing property deteriorates. A hydroxyl<br>
value of (ii) is preferably 5 or more, more preferably 10<br>
to 120, and particularly preferably 20 to 80. When it is<br>
less than 5, it becomes disadvantageous in respect of<br>
compatibility between the heat resistant preservability and<br>
the low-temperature fixing property. An acid value of (ii)<br>
is preferably 1 to 5, and more preferably 2 to 4. Since a<br>
wax having a high acid value is used, the binder is a low<br>
acid value binder that leads to charging and high volume<br>
resistance. Therefore, the binder is suitable for the<br><br>
toner used in a two-component developer.<br>
A glass transition point (Tg) of binder resin is<br>
usually set to be 35° C. to 70° C, and preferably 55° C. to<br>
65° C. If Tg is less than 35° C. , the heat resistant<br>
preservability of toner deteriorates. On the other hand,<br>
if Tg exceeds 70° C, the low temperature fixing property<br>
becomes insufficient. An urea-modified polyester is likely<br>
to be on the surfaces of obtained toner base particles.<br>
Therefore, the toner according to the present invention<br>
tends to show better heat resistant preservability as<br>
compared with known polyester toner, even if the glass<br>
transition point is low.<br>

Victoria blue lake, metal-free phthalocyanine blue,<br>
phthalocyanine blue, fast sky blue, indanthrene blue (RS,<br>
BC), indigo, ultramarine blue, Prussian blue, anthraquinone<br>
blue, fast violet B, methyl violet lake, cobalt violet,<br>
manganese violet, dioxane violet, anthraquinone violet,<br>

green, pigment green B, naphthol green B, green gold, acid<br>
green lake, malachite green lake, phthalocyanine green,<br>
anthraquinone green, titanium oxide, zinc white, and<br>
lithopone. The content of the colorant is usually 1 wt.%<br>
to 15 wt.%, and preferably 3 wt.% to 10 wt.% in toner<br>
particles.<br>
The colorant can also be used as a master batch mixed<br>
with resin. Examples of binder resin used to manufacture<br>
such a master batch or to be kneaded with the master batch<br>
include styrenes such as polystyrene, poly-p-chlorostyrene,<br>
polyvinyltoluene, and substituted polymer thereof, or<br>
copolymer of these compounds and vinyl compounds,<br>
polymethyl methacrylate, polybutyl methacrylate, polyvinyl<br>
chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
polyester, epoxy resin, epoxy polyol resin, polyurethane,<br>
polyamide, polyvinyl butyral, polyacrylate resin, rosin,<br>
modified rosin, terpene resin, aliphatic or alicyclic<br>
hydrocarbon resin, aromatic petroleum resin, chlorinated<br>
paraffin, and paraffin wax. These materials can be used<br>
alone or as a mixture thereof.<br><br>
Charge Control Agent:<br>
Known charge control agents can be used as a charge<br>
control agent, and include, for example, nigrosine dyes,<br>
triphenylmethane dyes, chromium-containing metal complex<br>
dyes, chelate molybdate pigment, rhodamine dyes, alkoxy<br>
amine, quaternary ammonium salt (including fluorine<br>
modified quaternary ammonium salt), alkylamide, phosphorus<br>
alone or compounds thereof, tungsten alone or compounds<br>
thereof, fluorine-based active agents, salicylic acid metal<br>
salts, and metal salts of salicylic acid derivatives. More<br>
specific examples of the charge control agents are Bontron<br>
03 as nigrosine dyes, Bontron P-51 as quaternary ammonium<br>
salts, Bontron S-34 as metal-containing azo dyes, E-82 as<br>
oxynaphthoic acid type metal complex, E-84 as salicylic<br>
acid metal complex, E-89 as phenol type condensate (these<br>
are manufactured by Orient Chemical Industries, Ltd.), TP-<br>
302 and TP-415 as quaternary ammonium salt molybdenum<br>
complexes (manufactured by Hodogaya Chemical Industries,<br>
Ltd.), Copy Charge PSY VP2038 as quaternary ammonium salt<br>
and Copy Charge NX VP434 as quaternary ammonium salt (these<br>
are manufactured by Hoechst Co., Ltd.), LRA-901 and LR-147<br>
as boron complex (manufactured by Japan Carlit Co., Ltd.),<br>
copper phthalocyanine, perylene, quinacridone, azo type<br>
pigments, and polymer compounds having a functional group<br>
such as a sulfonic acid group, a carboxyl group, and a<br>
quaternary ammonium salt group. Among these, a material<br>
that controls the toner to have negative polarity is<br>
preferably used.<br>
The use amount of the charge control agent is<br>
determined depending on the type of binder resins, presence<br>
or absence of additives to be used as required, and a<br>
method of manufacturing toner including a dispersion method,<br>
and hence, it is not uniquely limited. However, the charge<br><br>
control agent is used preferably in a range from 0.1 to 10<br>
parts by weight (wt. parts), and more preferably from 0.2<br>
to 5 wt. parts, per 100 wt. parts of the binder resin. If<br>
it exceeds 10 wt. parts, the toner is charged too highly,<br>
which causes effects of the charge control agent to be<br>
decreased, electrostatic attracting force with a developing<br>
roller to be increased, fluidity of the developer to be<br>
lowered, and image density to be reduced.<br>
Release Agent:<br>
A wax having a low melting point in a range from 50° C.<br>
to 120° C. effectively functions as a release agent between<br>
a fixing roller and a toner boundary in dispersion with<br>
binder resin. Due to this effective functioning of the wax,<br>
there is no need to apply a release agent as oil to the<br>
fixing roller and the high temperature offset is improved.<br>
Such wax components include the followings. Examples of<br>
waxes include waxes from plants such as carnauba wax,<br>
cotton wax, wood wax, and rice wax; waxes from animals such<br>
as beeswax and lanolin; waxes from mineral substances such<br>
as ozokerite and cercine; and petroleum waxes such as<br>
paraffin, microcrystalline, and petrolatum. Examples of<br>
waxes apart from these natural waxes include synthetic<br>
hydrocarbon waxes such as Fischer-Tropsch wax and<br>
polyethylene wax; and synthetic waxes such as ester, ketone,<br>
and ether. In addition to these, a crystalline polymer of<br>
which side chain has long alkyl group can be also used.<br>
The crystalline polymer includes homo polymer or copolymer<br>
of polyacrylate such as poly-n-stearyl methacrylate and<br>
poly-n-lauryl methacrylate (for example, n-stearyl<br>
acrylate-ethyl methacrylate copolymer), which are aliphatic<br>
amide such as 12-hydroxy stearamide, stearic acid amide,<br>
phthalic anhydride imide, and chlorinated hydrocarbon; and<br><br>
crystalline polymer resin having low molecular weight.<br>
The charge control agent and the release agent can be<br>
fused and mixed with the master batch and the binder resin,<br>
and may be added to organic solvent at a time of<br>
dissolution and dispersion.<br>
External Additive:<br>
Inorganic fine particles are preferably used as an<br>
external additive to facilitate fluidity, developing<br>
performance, and chargeability of toner particles. Such an<br>
inorganic fine particle has preferably a primary particle<br>
diameter of 5xl0"3 to 2 micrometers. In particular, the<br>
primary particle diameter is preferably 5xl0-3 to 0.5<br>
micrometer. A specific surface area by the BET method is<br>
preferably 20 to 500 m2/g. The use ratio of the inorganic<br>
fine particles is preferably 0.01 wt.% to 5 wt.% in toner<br>
particles, and more preferably 0.01 wt.% to 2.0 wt.%.<br>
Specific examples of the inorganic particles include<br>
silica, alumina, titanium oxide, barium titanate, magnesium<br>
titanate, calcium titanate, strontium titanate, zinc oxide,<br>
tin oxide, silica sand, clay, mica, wollastonite, diatomite,<br>
chromium oxide, cerium oxide, red iron oxide, antimony<br>
trioxide, magnesium oxide, zirconium oxide, barium sulfate,<br>
barium carbonate, calcium carbonate, silicon carbide, and<br>
silicon nitride. Among these materials, hydrophobic silica<br>
particles and hydrophobic titanium oxide particles are<br>
preferably used in combination as a fluidizing agent. In<br>
particular, when both particles having an average diameter<br>
of 5xl0~2 micrometers or less are mixed, electrostatic<br>
force and Van der Waals force with toner particles are<br>
significantly improved. As a result, even if such external<br>
additives are mixed with toner particles in a developing<br><br>
device to achieve a desired charge level, "firefly"(spot)-<br>
free desirable image quality can be obtained without<br>
desorption of the fluidizing agent from toner particles,<br>
and further an amount of remaining toner after a toner<br>
image is transferred can be reduced.<br>
While titanium oxide fine particles are excellent in<br>
environmental stability and image density stability, the<br>
titanium oxide fine particles tend to exhibit degradation<br>
in charge rising property. As a result, if an addition<br>
amount of titanium oxide fine particles is more than that<br>
of silica fine particles, this adverse effect becomes more<br>
influential. However, if hydrophobic silica particles and<br>
hydrophobic titanium oxide particles are added within 0.3<br>
wt.% to 1.5 wt.%, desired charge rising property is<br>
obtained without significant damage to the charge rising<br>
property. In other words, even if an image is repeatedly<br>
copied, stable image quality can be obtained.<br>
A toner manufacturing method is explained below. Here,<br>
exemplary embodiments of the toner manufacturing method are<br>
explained below, but the present invention is not limited<br>
to these embodiments.<br>
Toner Manufacturing Method:<br>
1) Toner material solution is produced by dispersing a<br>
colorant, a native polyester, an isocyanate group-<br>
containing polyester prepolymer, and a release agent in<br>
organic solvent.<br>
From the viewpoint of easy removal after formation of<br>
toner base particles, it is preferable that the organic<br>
solvent be volatile and have a boiling point of less than<br>
100° C. More specifically, the followings can be used<br>
solely or in combination with two or more types thereof,<br>
such as toluene, xylene, benzene, carbon tetrachloride.<br><br>
methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,2-<br>
trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, chloroform,<br>
monochlorobenzene, dichloroethylidene,. methyl acetate,<br>
ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, and methyl isobutyl<br>
ketone. In particular, aromatic solvent such as toluene<br>
and xylene, and halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene<br>
chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, and carbon<br>
tetrachloride are preferred. The use amount of organic<br>
solvent is usually 0 to 300 wt. parts for 100 wt. parts of<br>
polyester prepolymer, preferably 0 to 100 wt. parts, and<br>
further preferably 25 to 70 wt. parts.<br>
2) The toner material solution is emulsified in<br>
aqueous medium in the presence of a surfactant and resin<br>
fine particles.<br>
Such aqueous medium may be water alone or contain<br>
organic 'solvent such" as alcohol {e.g. methanol, isopropyl<br>
alcohol, and ethylene, glycol) , dimethyl formamide,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, cellosolves (e.g. methyl cellosolve), and<br>
lower ketones (e.g. acetone, methyl ethyl ketone).<br>
The use amount of the aqueous medium for 100 wt. parts<br>
of the toner material solution is usually 50 to 2,000 wt.<br>
parts, and preferably 100 to 1,000 wt. parts. If the<br>
amount is less than 50 wt. parts, the toner material<br>
solution is poorly dispersed, and it is thereby impossible<br>
to obtain toner particles having a predetermined particle<br>
size. On the other hand, if the amount exceeds 20,000 wt.<br>
parts, this is economically inefficient.<br>
Further, to improve the dispersion in the aqueous<br>
medium, a dispersing agent such as a surfactant and resin<br>
fine particles are added as required.<br>
Examples of the surfactant are anionic surfactants<br>
such as alkyl benzene sulfonate, α-olefin sulfonate, and<br>
ester phosphate; amine salts such as alkyl amine salts,<br><br>
aminoalcohol fatty acid derivatives, polyamine fatty acid<br>
derivatives, and imidazoline; cationic surfactants of<br>
quaternary ammonium salt types such as alkyl trimethyl<br>
ammonium salts, dialkyl dimethyl ammonium salts, alkyl<br>
dimethyl benzyl ammonium salts, pyridinium salts, alkyl<br>
isoquinolinium salts, and benzethonium chloride; nonionic<br>
surfactants such as fatty acid amide derivatives and<br>
polyhydric alcohol derivatives; and ampholytic surfactants<br>
such as alanine, dodecyl di(aminoethyl) glycine,<br>
di(octylaminoethyl) glycine, N-alkyl-N, and N-dimethyl<br>
ammonium betaine.<br>
Furthermore, a surfactant having a fluoroalkyl group<br>
is used to achieve a desired effect with a very small<br>
amount thereof. Preferable examples of anionic surfactants<br>
having a fluoroalkyl group are fluoroalkyl carboxylic acids<br>
having a carbon number from 2 to 10 and their metal salts;<br>
disodium perfluorooctane sulfonyl glutamate, sodium 3-[co-<br>
fluoroalkyl (C6 to Cll) oxy]-l-alkyl (C3 to C4) sulfonate,<br>
sodium 3-[co-fluoroalkanoyl (C6 to C8) -N-ethylamino] -1-<br>
propane sulfonate, fluoroalkyl (Cll to C20) carboxylic acid<br>
and its metal salts; perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid (C7 to<br>
C13) and its metal salts; perfluoroalkyl (C4 to C12)<br>

The resin fine particles may be of any resin selected<br>
from thermoplastic resins and thermosetting resins, if an<br>
aqueous dispersion may be formed from the resin fine<br>
particles. Examples of the resins include vinyl resins,<br>
polyurethane resins, epoxy resins, polyester resins,<br>
polyamide resins, polyimide resins, silicon resins, phenol<br>
resins, melamine resins, urea resins, aniline resins,<br>
ionomer resins, and polycarbonate resins. Two or more<br>
types of these resins in combination may be used for the<br>
resin fine particles.<br>
Among these, vinyl resin, polyurethane resin, epoxy<br>
resin, polyester resin, or combination thereof are<br>
preferable, since aqueous dispersions of resin spherical<br>
fine particles can be easily obtained. Examples of the<br>
vinyl resins include resin of polymer in which vinyl<br><br>
monomer is solely polymerized or co-polymerized, such as<br>
styrene-methacrylic ester copolymers, styrene-butadiene<br>
copolymers, methacrylic acid-acrylic ester copolymers,<br>
styrene-acrylonitrile copolymers, styrene-maleic acid<br>
anhydride copolymers, and styrene-methacrylic acid<br>
copolymers. An average particle size of the resin fine .<br>
particles is 5 to 200 nanometers, preferably 200 to 300<br>
nanometers.<br>
Moreover, inorganic dispersing agents such as calcium<br>
phosphate tribasic, calcium carbonate, titanium oxide,<br>
colloidal silica, and hydroxyapatite can also be used.<br>
Dispersion droplets may be stabilized by a high<br>
polymer protective colloid as a dispersing agent usable in<br>
combination with the resin fine particles and the inorganic<br>
dispersing agent. Examples are acids such as acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid, a-cyanoacrylic acid, a-cyanomethacrylic<br>
acid, itaconic acid, crotonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic<br>
acid, or maleic anhydride; or methacrylic monomers<br>
containing a hydroxyl group such as p-hydroxyethyl acrylate,<br>
p-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, p-hydroxypropyl acrylate, |3-<br>
hydroxypropyl methacrylate, y-hydroxypropyl acrylate, y-<br>
hydroxypropyl methacrylate, 3-chloro 2-hydroxypropyl<br>
acrylate, 3-chloro 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, diethylene<br>
glycol monoacrylic ester, diethylene glycol monomethacrylic<br>
ester, glycerol monoacrylic ester, glycerol monomethacrylic<br>
ester, N-methylol acrylamide, N-methylol methacrylamide;<br>
vinyl alcohol or ethers with vinyl alcohol such as vinyl<br>
methyl ether, vinyl ethyl ether, vinyl propyl ether; or<br>
esters of compounds that contains a vinyl alcohol and a<br>
carboxyl group such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate,<br>
vinyl butyrate; acrylamide, methacrylamide, diacetone<br>
acrylamide or their methylol compounds; acid chlorides such<br><br>
as chloride acrylate and chloride methacrylate;<br>
homopolymers or copolymers of nitrogen-containing compounds<br>
such as vinylpyridine, vinylpyrrolidone, vinylimidazole,<br>
and ethyleneimine or of heterocyclic ring thereof;<br>
polyoxyethylene compounds such as polyoxyethylene,<br>
polyoxypropylene, polyoxyethylene alkyl amine,<br>
polyoxypropylene alkyl amine, polyoxyethylene alkyl amide,<br>
polyoxypropylene alkyl amide, polyoxyethylene nonyl phenyl<br>
ether, polyoxyethylene lauryl phenyl ether, polyoxyethylene<br>
stearyl phenyl ester, and polyoxyethylene nonyl phenyl<br>
ester; and a cellulose group such as methyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose, and hydroxypropyl cellulose.<br>
A dispersion method is not particularly limited, and<br>
it is possible to use known facilities of a low-speed<br>
shearing type, a high-speed shearing type, a friction type,<br>
a high-pressure jet type, and an ultrasonic type. Among<br>
these, the high-speed shearing type is preferred to obtain<br>
dispersed particles having a particle size ranging from 2<br>
to 20 micrometers. When a high-speed shearing type<br>
dispersing machine is used, the number of revolutions is<br>
not particularly limited, and is usually from 1,000<br>
revolutions per minute (rpm) to 30,000 rpm, preferably from<br>
5,000 rpm to 20,000 rpm. The dispersion time is not<br>
particularly limited and is usually from 0.1 to 5 minutes<br>
in a batch system. The dispersing temperature is usually<br>
from 0° C. to 150° C. (under a pressure) , preferably from<br>
40° C. to 98° C.<br>
3) During preparation of an emulsified liquid, amines<br>
(B) are added and are allowed to react with polyester<br>
prepolymer (A) having an isocyanate group.<br>
This reaction is followed by crosslinking and/or<br>
elongation of a molecular chain. The reaction time is<br>
selected according to the reactivity between an isocyanate<br><br>
group structure of the polyester prepolymer (A) and amines<br>
(B), and is usually 10 minutes to 40 hours, preferably 2<br>
hours to 24 hours. The reaction temperature ranges usually<br>
from 0° C. to 150° C, preferably from 40° C. to 98° C.<br>
Moreover, a known catalyst can be used if necessary.<br>
Specific examples of the catalyst are dibutyl tin laurate<br>
and dioctyl tin laurate.<br>
4) After completion of the reaction, the organic<br>
solvent is removed from emulsified dispersion (reaction<br>
compound), is washed, and dried to obtain the toner base<br>
particles.<br>
To remove the organic solvent therefrom, the whole<br>
system is gradually heated up while laminar flow is stirred,<br>
and is stirred vigorously at a fixed temperature range.<br>
The solvent is removed from the dispersion, and then<br>
spindle-shaped toner base particles are prepared. Further,<br>
if a compound like calcium phosphate salt that can dissolve<br>
in an acid or an alkali is used as a dispersion stabilizer,<br>
after the calcium phosphate salt is dissolved in an acid<br>
like hydrochloric acid, the calcium phosphate salt is<br>
removed from the toner base particles by a method of<br>
washing. In addition, the calcium phosphate salt can be<br>
removed through decomposition by an enzyme.<br>
5) A charge control agent is implanted into the toner<br>
base particles thus obtained, and inorganic fine particles<br>
such as those of silica and titanium oxide are added<br>
externally to obtain the toner.<br>
The implantation of the charge control agent and the<br>
external addition of the inorganic fine particles are<br>
carried out by a known method using a mixer and so on.<br>
Accordingly, the toner having a small particle size<br>
and a sharp particle-size distribution can be obtained<br>
easily. Moreover, by vigorously stirring the toner in the<br><br>
process of removing the organic solvent, the shape of<br>
particles can be controlled in a range from a perfectly<br>
spherical shape to a spindle shape. Furthermore, the<br>
morphology of the surface can also be controlled in a range<br>
from a smooth shape to a rough shape.<br>
The configurations of the image forming apparatus, the<br>
imaging unit, and the cleaning device according to a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention are the same as these<br>
in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 18, and hence, explanation<br>
thereof is omitted.<br>
In the present invention, the lubricant applying<br>
device 3 is disposed inside the cleaning device 8 as explained with reference to Fig. 2. Pressing forces are<br>
produced when the solid lubricant 3b is pressed against and<br>
contacted with the brush roller 3a upwardly (from the lower<br>
side of the brush) as shown in Fig. 2, when it is pressed<br>
against and contacted withthe brush roller 3a sidewardly<br>
(from the side of the brush), or when it is pressed against<br>
and contacted with the brush roller 3a downwardly (from the<br>
upper side of the brush) (not shown). Each of the pressing<br>
forces and the deviations of pressing forces between the<br>
initial time and the elapsed time (life) (initial pressing<br>
force-elapsed time pressing force) are obtained.<br><br><br>
It is understood from the table 1 that the pressing<br>
force applied to the brush roller 3a and the deviation of<br>
the pressing forces are different depending on the .<br>
direction of pressing the solid lubricant 3b.<br>
The pressing force and the deviation of the pressing<br>
forces in an actual lubricant applying device are explained<br>
below. The following two types of machines are used for<br>
comparisons. When the solid lubricant 3b is pressed<br><br>
downwardly, the deviation of the pressing forces increases<br>
by 42% in model G and by 22% in model J as compared with<br>
the case where the solid lubricant 3b is pressed upwardly.<br><br>
It is understood from the table 2 that the application<br>
amount of the lubricant largely fluctuates when the<br>
deviation of the pressing force is large because the<br>
required application amount of the lubricant is different<br>
depending on the models and a multiplier of a pressure<br>
spring to be used is different due to restriction to layout,<br>
although the magnitudes of the deviation cannot be compared<br>
between the models in a simple manner. Therefore, the<br><br>
large fluctuations may lead to an excessive application in<br>
the initial stage or to a shortage of application when time<br>
is elapsed. Consequently, a smaller deviation of the<br>
pressing force allows more stable application.<br>
Accordingly, the arrangement, as shown in Fig. 2, in<br>
which the solid lubricant 3b is pressed from the lower side<br>
of the brush roller 3a, allows more stable application of<br>
the lubricant as compared with the arrangements in which it<br>
is pressed from the side and from the upper side of the<br>
brush roller 3a.<br>
Fig. 7 is a diagram of the solid lubricant 3b for the<br>
lubricant applying device 3, when viewed from its<br>
longitudinal direction as the front side.<br>
The solid lubricant 3b molded into a rectangular solid<br>
is fixed to the lubricant holding element 3d. A plurality<br>
of pressing elements 3c-l and 3c-2 are provided in the<br>
lubricant holding element 3d so as to be aligned in the<br>
longitudinal direction thereof. The pressing elements 3c-l<br>
and 3c-2 bias the solid lubricant 3b toward the side of the<br>
brush roller 3a. The pressing force of the pressing<br>
element 3c is adjusted so as to decrease the pressing force<br>
of the pressing elements 3c-2 provided at a central area as<br>
compared with that of the pressing elements 3c-l provided<br>
at end areas in the longitudinal direction. When a<br>
compressed spring is used as the pressing element 3c as<br>
shown in Fig. 7, a spring pressure is changed between the<br>
pressing element 3c-l and the pressing element 3c-2.<br>
The reason that the pressing element 3c is provided in<br>
plurality and the pressing force is made different between<br>
the pressing element 3c-l and the pressing element 3c-2 in<br>
the above manner is as follows. At first, if there is only<br>
one pressing element 3c, the lubricant cannot be uniformly<br>
applied in the longitudinal direction. If the pressing<br><br>
forces of the pressing elements 3c are the same as one<br>
another, then the pressing force of the pressing elements<br>
3c-l positioned at the end areas in the longitudinal<br>
direction easily escapes to the outside. Therefore, the<br>
solid lubricant 3b undergoes larger pressure at its central<br>
area in the longitudinal direction, which causes nonuniform<br>
application of the lubricant. Consequently, the pressing<br>
force of the pressing elements 3c-2 is controlled to be<br>
lower than that of the pressing elements 3c-l, to balance<br>
the pressures in the longitudinal direction of the solid<br>
lubricant 3b, and the solid lubricant 3b is in contact with<br>
the brush roller 3a at uniform pressure, thereby achieving<br>
uniform application of the lubricant to the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1.<br>
The example of Fig. 7 shows four pressing elements 3c,<br>
but two or more, preferably three or more of pressing<br>
elements 3c may be provided in the present invention. If<br>
two pressing elements 3c are provided, the two are arranged<br>
at both ends in the longitudinal direction, and hence, no<br>
pressing element 3c is provided at the central area. This<br>
loses the pressure balance in the longitudinal direction,<br>
which causes nonuniform application to occur in the central<br>
area in the longitudinal direction of the photoconductor 1.<br>
Thus, three or more pressing elements 3c are aligned in a<br>
row in the longitudinal direction, to take balance over the<br>
whole area in the longitudinal direction, thereby enabling<br>
further uniform application of the lubricant.<br>
The pressing force of the solid lubricant 3b against<br>
the brush roller 3a is controlled so that the total<br>
pressure of the pressing forces of the pressing elements 3c<br>
(3c-l and 3c-2 in Fig. 7) ranges from 200 to 1,000 mN. If<br>
the total pressure is less than 200 mN, the brush roller 3a<br>
cannot sufficiently scrape the solid lubricant 3b off,<br><br>
which results in unsatisfactory application amount of the<br>
lubricant for the surface of the photoconductor 1. This<br>
promotes the wear of the cleaning blade 8a and the surface<br>
of the photoconductor 1, and cleaning failure such that<br>
toner remains after a toner image is transferred easily<br>
occurs. If the total pressure exceeds 1,000 mN, the<br>
application amount of the lubricant for the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 becomes too much. This causes consumption<br>
of the solid lubricant 3b to be quicker, and causes the<br>
surface of the photoconductor 1 to be excessively applied<br>
with the lubricant that contains hygroscopic fatty acid<br>
metal salt, thereby being affected by humidity. This<br>
causes an electrostatic latent image to be flowed, which<br>
leads to such a failure as occurrence of the image blur.<br>
Therefore, the solid lubricant 3b is pressed preferably at<br>
the total pressure of 200 to 1,000 mN with respect to the<br>
brush roller 3a.<br>
The thickness of each brush fiber of the brush roller<br>
3a is preferably 3 to 8 denials, and the density of brush<br>
fibers is preferably 20,000 to 100,000/inch2. If the<br>
thickness of the brush fiber is too thin, the bristles<br>
become easily bent when the brush roller 3a contacts the<br>
surface of the photoconductor 1. Conversely, if the brush<br>
fiber is too thick, the density of the brush fibers cannot<br>
be increased. If the density of the brush fibers is low,<br>
the number of brush fibers contacting the surface thereof<br>
is small, and hence, the lubricant cannot be uniformly<br>
applied to the surface of the photoconductor 1. Conversely,<br>
if the density of brush fibers is too high, a gap between a<br>
fiber and a fiber becomes narrower, and an adhesion amount<br>
of the powder of the lubricant scraped off is reduced,<br>
which causes a shortage of the application amount.<br>
The brush roller 3a is produced in the range set SUCh<br><br>
that the thickness of the brush fiber is provided so as not<br>
to be bent and the density of the brush fibers is provided<br>
so as to efficiently perform uniform application of the<br>
lubricant.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the rotation direction of the<br>
brush roller 3a is preferably in the forward direction with<br>
respect to the movement direction of the photoconductor 1.<br>
If the rotation direction of the brush roller 3a is in the<br>
opposite direction to the movement direction of the<br>
photoconductor 1, the powder of the lubricant adhered to<br>
the brush fiber of the brush roller 3a is scattered by the<br>
impact when the brush roller 3a contacts the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1, so that the uniform and efficient<br>
application cannot be performed. As a result, the rotation<br>
direction of the brush roller 3a is preferably in the<br>
forward direction with respect to the movement direction of<br>
the photoconductor 1.<br>
The solid lubricant 3b is used in the same manner as<br>
that explained in the first embodiment.<br>
Features of the second embodiment are explained below.<br>
The cleaning blade 8a, being a cleaning unit, is made to<br>
contact the surface of the photoconductor 1 on the upstream<br>
side in the movement direction of the photoconductor 1 with<br>
respect to the zone where the lubricant is applied by the<br>
brush roller 3a. Then a lubricant smoothing blade 8b,<br>
being a lubricant smoothing unit, is made to contact the<br>
surface of the photoconductor 1 on the downstream side in<br>
the movement direction of the photoconductor 1 with respect<br>
to the zone where the lubricant is applied. In the second<br>
embodiment, as shown in Fig. 8A and Fig. 8B, the cleaning<br>
blade 8a is made to contact the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 from the counter direction, and the<br>
lubricant smoothing blade 8b is made to contact the surface<br><br>
thereof from the trailing direction. The cleaning blade 8a<br>
and the lubricant smoothing blade 8b are made of rubber<br>
which is an elastic body.<br>
Based on the configuration above, a toner image<br>
carried on the surface of the photoconductor 1 is<br>
transferred to a transfer material, and the toner remaining<br>
on the surface thereof after the toner image is transferred<br>
is first removed by the cleaning blade 8a. The surface of<br>
the photoconductor 1 becomes clean through the toner<br>
removal, and the brush roller 3a contacts the surface<br>
cleaned and applies the lubricant thereto. The surface of<br>
the lubricant applied is uniformly spread when it is<br>
passing through the zone, where the lubricant smoothing<br>
blade 8b contacts the lubricant, which is on the downstream<br>
side in the movement direction of the photoconductor 1, to<br>
form a layer of the lubricant having a uniform thickness.<br>
The lubricant applying device 3 and the cleaning<br>
device 8 thus configured are provided in the image forming<br>
apparatus, and an appropriate amount of lubricant is<br>
applied to the surface of the photoconductor 1, which<br>
allows formation of a uniform thin film of the lubricant<br>
without nonuniform application.<br>
After the remaining toner is cleaned in the above<br>
manner, the lubricant is applied, and the lubricant applied<br>
is smoothed to form a uniform layer, thereby preventing<br>
both failures occurring in the cases of the "the cleaning<br>
after the application" and the "the application after the<br>
cleaning". More specifically, the deviation of the<br>
application amount of lubricant and the deviation of the<br>
static frictional coefficient of the surface due to the<br>
"the cleaning after the application" are prevented to occur.<br>
The abnormal images due to a nonuniform lubricant layer<br>
caused by "the application after the cleaning" are also<br><br>
prevented to occur. The abnormal images include the worm<br>
hole, the image blur, and the rough image. At the same<br>
time, the application function of the brush roller 3a can<br>
also be maintained over the long period of time. Since the<br>
rubber is used for the lubricant smoothing blade 8b, even<br>
if the lubricant smoothing blade 8b moves along the<br>
photoconductor 1 in its contact state, the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 is not possibly damaged.<br>
In the present invention, the wear of the cleaning<br>
blade 8a and the surface of the photoconductor 1 can be<br>
prevented, and the toner remaining on the surface thereof<br>
after the toner image is transferred can be satisfactorily-<br>
cleaned even if the spherical and small-sized toner<br>
particles are used. Moreover, the image blur can be<br>
prevented. The image blur may occur when the surface of<br>
the photoconductor 1 is affected by humidity due to<br>
excessive application of the lubricant.<br>
In the second embodiment, the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 is cleaned by the cleaning blade 8a, but a<br>
cleaning brush may be used instead of the cleaning blade 8a.<br>
The cleaning brush is obtained by applying bias to a<br>
conductive brush having a resistance between a medium<br>
resistance and a low resistance.<br>
The present invention is not limited by the<br>
embodiments, and is applicable to any device that uses the<br>
technological principles of the present invention. The<br>
photoconductor or the intermediate transfer element may be<br>
either one of a belt shape and a roller shape.<br>
A relation between the torque and the cleaning<br>
performance according to the present invention is shown in<br>
table 3 .<br>
When only the cleaning blade is made to contact the<br>
surface of the photoconductor, the torque is 10, but when<br><br>
the lubricant is applied, the torque decreases to 8 even<br>
when the lubricant smoothing blade 8b contacts the surface<br>
thereof. The cleaning performance is not sufficient enough<br>
to perform cleaning without the lubricant, but it is<br>
improved with the lubricant, and then, the efficient<br>
cleaning becomes possible.<br><br>
The decrease in the torque allows energy saving, and a<br>
motor can be minimized to allow low cost and space saving.<br>
Fig. 9 is a schematic diagram for explaining a third<br>
embodiment of the present invention. A lubricant applying<br>
device according to the third embodiment is different from<br>
that in Fig. 2. More specifically, in the lubricant<br>
applying device of Fig. 2, the applying brush, being a<br>
contact type, is used as an applying element. However, in<br>
the third embodiment, an applying brush 3a1 being<br>
noncontact with the surface of the photoconductor 1 is used.<br>
In this device, a solid lubricant is not used but a powdery<br>
lubricant 3b' is used. The rotation of the applying brush<br>
3a allows compositions of the lubricant to float, and the<br>
compositions are adhered to the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1.<br>
Since the lubricant applying device thus configured<br>
applies the lubricant in a noncontact manner, the torque<br>
can decrease more than the second embodiment while the<br><br>
cleaning performance the same as that of the second<br>
embodiment is maintained. Therefore, further energy saving<br>
is achieved, and the motor can be minimized to allow low<br>
cost and space saving.<br>
In the third embodiment, tests were conducted by<br>
comparing a method according to the present invention with<br>
the conventional method. The method according to the<br>
present invention was such that the lubricant smoothing<br>
blade 8b was made to contact the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 in the trailing manner and the lubricant<br>
applied was smoothed. As the result of the testing, the<br>
effect of the present invention can be verified.<br>

The lubricant was applied under the conditions as<br>
explained above, and comparisons were made on the<br>
application amounts of the lubricant required to keep a<br>

rate of an image area of polymer toner is 50%.<br>
Results are as follows:<br>
Present Invention 0.04 g/km<br>
Conventional Method 0.35 g/km<br>
It is verified from the results that the present invention<br>
employing the method of '"the application after the<br>
cleaning" + smoothing blade is further highly effective in<br>
reduction of the frictional coefficient of the surface of<br>
the photoconductor, as compared with the conventional<br>
method of "the cleaning after the application".<br>
The following tests were conducted to obtain optimal<br>
values of a contact angle and a contact pressure of the<br>
second blade, being the lubricant smoothing blade according<br>
to the present invention, with respect to the surface of<br>
the photoconductor. As the result of the tests, the<br>
following conditions which are suitable for implementation<br>
of the present invention are obtained.<br>
Test Conditions:<br>
Second blade (Lubricant smoothing blade) (Blade<br>
type: T7050, Thickness: 1.3 mm)<br>
Fur brush (Brush type: SA7, No Brush flicker)<br>
Charging roller (No roller, No cleaner)<br>
Pressure to lubricant (Own weight: 36 g)<br>
Contact angle and contact pressure of second blade<br>
Contact angle: 9 degrees (Contact pressure 1400 mN,<br>
2800 mN)<br>
Contact angle: 19.7 degrees (Contact pressure 2200 mN)<br>
Contact angle: 22.7 degrees (Contact pressure 1400 mN,<br>
2800 mN)<br>
The photoconductor unit was made to run idle under the<br>
above conditions, and µ on the surface of the<br>
photoconductor was measured at a predetermined time<br><br>
interval. As the result, when the contact angle is 22.7<br>
degrees and the contact pressure is 2800 mN, the frictional<br>
coefficient is the minimum (minimum value 0.12, maximum<br>
value 0.21), and the vibration of the unit is smaller than<br>
other conditions, so that these conditions become the most<br>
favorable. From the results, to efficiently reduce the<br>
frictional coefficient of the surface of the photoconductor,<br>
a larger angle of the blade is better, and a higher contact<br>
pressure is better according to the range of the tests.<br>
In the image forming apparatus according to the<br>
present invention, the toner used in the developing device<br>
4 preferably has a volume-average particle size ranging<br>
from 3 to 8 micrometers, and has a ratio (Dv/Dn) between<br>
the volume-average particle size (Dv) and the number-<br>
average particle size (Dn) ranging from 1.00 to 1.40.<br>
By using toner particles having a small particle size,<br>
the toner particles can be densely adhered to a latent<br>
image. However, if the volume-average particle size is<br>
smaller than the range of the present invention, and if a<br>
two-component developer is used, the toner particles are<br>
fused onto the surfaces of magnetic carriers during<br>
stirring of the developer for a long time in the developing<br>
device, to reduce the charging capability of the magnetic<br>
carriers. And if a one-component developer is used,<br>
filming of the toner particles to the developing roller<br>
easily occurs, and the toner particles are easily fused to<br>
an element such as a blade for making the toner thinner.<br>
Conversely, if the volume-average particle size is larger<br>
than the range of the present invention, it becomes<br>
difficult to obtain a high-resolution and high-quality<br>
image. When toner particles in the developer are consumed,<br>
the balance of toner particle sizes may sometimes largely<br>
fluctuate.<br><br>
By narrowing the particle size distribution, a charge<br>
amount distribution of toner becomes uniform, thereby<br>
obtaining a high quality image with less background fogging,<br>
and increasing a transfer rate. However, when Dv/Dn<br>
exceeds 1.40, the charge amount distribution is widened and<br>
resolution decreases, which is not preferable.<br>
An average particle size and a particle size<br>
distribution of toner particles can be measured using<br>
Coulter Counter TA-II and Coulter Multisizer II (both<br>
manufactured by Coulter Electronics Limited). In the<br>
present invention, the Coulter Counter TA-II was used to<br>
measure the average particle size and the size distribution<br>
by being connected to an interface (manufactured by Nikkaki<br>
Bios Co.) which outputs a number (of particles)<br>
distribution and a volume distribution, as well as to a<br>
personal computer (PC9801: manufactured by NEC Corp.).<br>
In such toner, a proportion of wax and inorganic fine<br>
particles occupied in toner particles is increased as<br>
compared with that of conventional toner particles by<br>
reducing the toner particle size. The wax is internally or<br>
externally added to toner particles to improve the release<br>
property, and the inorganic fine particles are used to<br>
improve the fluidity. These additives become a factor of<br>
adhesion substances (adherents) produced on the<br>
photoconductor 1. The lubricant applying device 3<br>
according to the present invention is therefore installed<br>
to form a thin film with uniform lubricant over the whole<br>
area on the surface of the photoconductor 1, thereby<br>
reducing an adhesion force of the adhesion substances to<br>
the surface of the photoconductor 1. Furthermore, the<br>
frictional force between the surface of the photoconductor<br>
1 and the cleaning blade 8a of the cleaning device 8 or the<br>
lubricant smoothing blade 8b is reduced to enable<br><br>
satisfactory cleaning.<br>
When toner particles used in the developing device 4<br>
have high circularity such as an average circularity of<br>
0.93 or higher, the effect of providing the cleaning device<br>
8 of the present invention in an image forming apparatus is<br>
significant. The toner particles having high circularity<br>
easily enter the space between the photoconductor 1 and the<br>
cleaning blade during cleaning using the blade system, and<br>
easily slip through the space. If the contact pressure of<br>
the cleaning blade to the photoconductor 1 is increased,<br>
the photoconductor 1 is largely damaged. Furthermore, even<br>
in a method of applying a bias having opposite polarity to<br>
charge polarity of toner, to the brush roller, and<br>
electrostatically collecting toner, it is difficult to<br>
remove the toner from the brush roller. Therefore,<br>
electrostatic toner removal capability tends to decrease<br>
gradually.<br>
However, the cleaning device 8 of the present<br>
invention allows efficient cleaning of the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 in the following manner even if the toner<br>
particles have high average circularity. More specifically,<br>
the toner remaining on the photoconductor 1 is<br>
electrostatically collected by an electrostatic cleaning<br>
element, and then, the remaining toner is finally scraped<br>
off by the cleaning blade 8a and removed. Thus, efficient<br>
cleaning can be performed without damage to the surface of<br>
the photoconductor 1.<br>
The average circularity of toner is a value obtained<br>
by optically detecting a particle, projecting the particle<br>
onto a plane to obtain an area of the particle projected,<br>
and dividing the area by a circumferential length of a<br>
circle having an area equivalent to the area of the<br>
particle projected. The average circularity is measured<br><br>
actually by using a flow particle image analyzer (FPIA-<br>
2000: manufactured by Sysmex Corp.). Water of 100 to 150<br>
milliliters from which impurity solid is previously removed<br>
is put into a predetermined container, 0. 1 to 0. 5<br>
milliliter of surfactant being a dispersing agent is added<br>
to the water, and sample to be measured is further added<br>
thereto by about 0.1 to 9.5 grams. A suspension with the<br>
sample dispersed therein is dispersed for about 1 to 3<br>
minutes by an ultrasonic disperser, and concentration of a<br>
dispersing solution is controlled to 3,000 to 10,000<br>
pieces/uL, and the shape and the distribution of toner<br>
particles are measured.<br>
The toner used in the image forming apparatus<br>
according to the present invention has the shape factor SF-<br>
1 ranging preferably from 100 to 180 and the shape factor<br>
SF-2 ranging also preferably from 100 to 180. The shape<br>
factor SF-1 and the shape factor SF-2 are the same as those<br>
explained with reference to Fig. 5.<br>
Further, the constitutional materials and<br>
manufacturing method of toner are the same as those<br>
explained in the first embodiment, and explanation thereof<br>
is omitted.<br>
The molecular weight of a polymer produced with a<br>
modified polyester can be measured, using Gel Permeation<br>
Chromatography (GPC), with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a<br>
solvent. A glass transition point (Tg) of a native<br>
polyester can be measured by a Differential Scanning<br>
Calorimeter (DSC).<br>
In the toner manufacturing method, resin fine<br>
particles are added to stabilize toner base particles that<br>
are formed in the aqueous medium. Therefore, it is<br>
preferable that the resin fine particles are added to make<br>
10% to 90% covering over the surface of the toner base<br><br>
particles. Examples of the resin fine particles are fine<br>
particles of poly methyl methacrylate having a particle<br>
size of 1 micrometer and 3 micrometers; fine particles of<br>
polystyrene having a particle size of 0.5 micrometer and 2<br>
micrometers; and fine particles of poly (styrene-<br>
acrylonitrile) having a particle size of 1 micrometer.<br>
Examples of trade names are PB-200H (manufactured by Kao<br>
Corp.), SGP (manufactured by Soken Co., Ltd.),<br>
TECHNOPOLYMER-SB (manufactured by Sekisui Plastics Co.,<br>
Ltd.), SGP-3G (manufactured by Soken Co., Ltd.), and<br>
MICROPEARL (manufactured by Sekisui Fine Chemical Co. Ltd.).<br>
The shape of the toner according to the third<br>
embodiment is almost spherical as that in the first<br>
embodiment. The toner manufactured can be used as magnetic<br>
toner, for a one-component developer that does not use<br>
magnetic carrier, or as non-magnetic toner.<br>
When the toner is used for a two-component developer,<br>
the toner may be mixed with magnetic carrier. The magnetic<br>
carrier is ferrite that contains divalent metal such as<br>
iron, magnetite, Mn, Zn, and Cu, and its volume-average<br>
particle size is preferably 20 to 100 micrometers. If the<br>
average particle size is less than 20 micrometers, then the<br>
carrier is easily adhered to the photoconductor 1 upon<br>
development. If it exceeds 100 micrometers, then carrier<br>
is not easily mixed with toner, and the charge amount of<br>
toner is not sufficient. Therefore, charging failure<br>
easily occurs during continuous use. Zn-containing Cu<br>
ferrite is preferred because its saturated magnetization is<br>
high, but it can be selected as required according to the<br>
process of the image forming apparatus. Resin covering the<br>
magnetic carrier is not particularly limited, but includes,<br>
for example, the resin includes silicone resin, styrene-<br>
acrylic resin, fluororesin, and olefin resin. The<br><br>
manufacturing method of the resin may be either one of<br>
methods as follows: a method of dissolving coating resin in<br>
a solvent and spraying the solvent into a fluidized bed to<br>
coat a carrier core, and another method of<br>
electrostatically adhering resin particles to core<br>
particles and thermally fusing the resin particles to cover<br>
the core particles. The thickness of the core particle<br>
covered with resin is 0.05 to 10 micrometers, preferably<br>
0.3 to 4 micrometers.<br>
Fig. 10 is a vertical cross-section of one example of<br>
an image forming apparatus that can form a full-color image.<br>
The image forming apparatus includes an endless<br>
intermediate transfer belt 103 that is wound around among a<br>
plurality of support rollers 104, 105, and 106 and is made<br>
to rotate in the direction of arrow A, and first to fourth<br>
process cartridges 107Y, 107C, 107M, and 107BK, which are<br>
arranged opposite to the intermediate transfer belt 103.<br>
The process cartridges 107Y, 107C, 107M, and 107BK include<br>
image carriers 102Y, 102C, 102M, and 102BK, respectively,<br>
which are configured as drum-shaped photoconductors that<br>
form respective toner images of different colors. The<br>
toner images of different colors are formed on the<br>
respective image carriers, and are superposedly transferred<br>
to the intermediate transfer belt 3. The intermediate<br>
transfer belt 103 is one example of a transfer material to<br>
which the toner images on the respective image carriers are<br>
transferred. Reference numeral 100 in Fig. 10 is the main<br>
unit of the image forming apparatus.<br>
How to form toner images on the image carriers 102Y,<br>
102C, 102M, and 102BK of the first to fourth process<br>
cartridges 107Y, 107C, 107M, and 107BK and to transfer the<br>
toner images to the intermediate transfer belt 103 is<br>
substantially the same as one another in the respective<br><br>
configurations, although the toner images are formed with different colors. Therefore, only the configuration, in<br>
which a toner image is formed on the image carrier 102Y of<br>
the first process cartridge 107Y and the toner image formed<br>
is transferred to the intermediate transfer belt 103, is<br>
explained below.<br>
Fig. 11 is an enlarged cross-section of the first<br>
process cartridge 107Y. The image carrier 102Y of the<br>
process cartridge 107Y is rotatably supported by a unit<br>
case 108, and is made to rotate in the clockwise direction<br>
by a drive unit (not shown). When it is rotated, a<br>
charging voltage is applied to a charging roller 109<br>
rotatably supported by the unit case 108, so that the<br>
surface of the image carrier 102Y is charged to<br>
predetermined polarity. Laser light L, which is emitted<br>
from an optical writing unit 110 shown in Fig. 10 and<br>
optically modulated, is radiated to the image carrier 102Y<br>
after being charged, thereby forming an electrostatic<br>
latent image on the image carrier 102Y. The electrostatic<br>
latent image is visualized as a yellow toner image by a<br>
developing device 111.<br>
The developing device 111 includes a developing case<br>
112 that is formed with a part of the unit case 108, and<br>
the developing case 112 accommodates a two-component dry-<br>
type developer D containing toner and carrier. Disposed in<br>
the developing case 112 are two screws 113 and 114 that<br>
stir the developer D, and a developing roller 123 that is<br>
made to rotate in the counterclockwise direction in Fig. 11.<br>
The developer D sucked to the circumferential surface of<br>
the developing roller 123 is carried on the circumferential<br>
surface thereof and is conveyed in the direction of<br>
rotation of the developing roller 123. Then the developer<br>
D passing through a doctor blade 124 is conveyed to a<br><br>
developing region between the developing roller 123 and the<br>
image carrier 102Y. At this time, the toner in the<br>
developer is electrostatically moved to the electrostatic<br>
latent image formed on the image carrier 102Y and the<br>
latent image is visualized as a toner image. The developer<br>
D having passed through the developing region is separated<br>
from the developing roller 123 and stirred by the screws<br>
113 and 114. The toner image is formed on the image<br>
carrier 102Y in the above manner. A developing device<br>
using one-component developer without carrier can also be<br>
employed.<br>
On the other hand, a primary transfer roller 125 is<br>
arranged on the opposite side to the process cartridge 107Y<br>
across the intermediate transfer belt 103. A transfer<br>
voltage is applied to the primary transfer roller 125, and<br>
the toner image on the image carrier 102Y is thereby<br>
primarily transferred to the intermediate transfer belt 103<br>
that is made to rotate in the direction of arrow A.<br>
Remaining toner adhered to the image carrier 102Y after the<br>
toner image is transferred is removed by a cleaning device<br>
126. The cleaning device 126 according to the third<br>
embodiment includes a cleaning case 127 formed with a part<br>
of the unit case 108, a cleaning blade 128 of which front<br>
edge is pressed against the surface of the image carrier<br>
102Y, a blade holder 129 that holds the cleaning blade 128,<br>
and a toner conveying screw 130 disposed in the cleaning<br>
case 127. The cleaning blade 128 is arranged in the<br>
counter direction with respect to the movement direction of<br>
the surface of the image carrier 102Y. Such a cleaning<br>
blade 128 is made of an elastic body such as rubber, and<br>
the base side of the cleaning blade 128 is fixed to the<br>
blade holder 129 with, for example, an adhesive. By<br>
pressing the front edge of the cleaning blade 128 against<br><br>
the surface of the image carrier 102Y, the remaining toner<br>
on the image carrier 102Y is scraped off and removed. The<br>
toner removed is conveyed to the outside of the cleaning<br>
case 127 by the toner conveying screw 130 that is made to<br>
rotate. The cleaning blade 128 cleans the image carrier<br>
after the toner image is transferred to a transfer material<br>
(which corresponds to the intermediate transfer belt 103 of<br>
Fig. 10).<br>
The process cartridge 107Y also includes a lubricant<br>
applying device 131 that applies a lubricant to the image<br>
carrier 102Y, and a smoothing blade 132 that is one example<br>
of a lubricant smoothing unit for smoothing the lubricant<br>
applied to the image carrier 102Y. These devices are<br>
explained in detail later.<br>
In the same manner as explained above, a cyan toner<br>
image, a magenta toner image, and a black toner image are<br>
formed on the second to fourth image carriers 102C, 102M,<br>
and 102BK of Fig. 10, respectively. These toner images are<br>
primarily transferred, in a sequential superposing manner,<br>
to the intermediate transfer belt 103 with the yellow toner<br>
image having been transferred thereon, to form a composite<br>
toner image on the intermediate transfer belt 103. How to<br>
remove the remaining toner on the image carriers 102C, 102M,<br>
and 102BK after the respective toner images are transferred<br>
is also the same as that of the first image carrier 102Y.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, a paper feed device 116 is<br>
provided in the main unit 100 of the image forming<br>
apparatus at the lower side thereof. The paper feed device<br>
116 includes a paper feed cassette 114 for storing<br>
recording mediums P such as transfer paper, and a paper<br>
feed roller 115. The top-most recording medium P is sent<br>
out in the direction of arrow B by rotation of the paper<br>
feed roller 115. The recording medium sent-out is fed, at<br><br>
a predetermined time, into a space between a portion of the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 103, which is wound around the<br>
support roller 104, and a secondary transfer roller 118<br>
which faces the support roller 104 by a registration roller<br>
pair 117. At this time, a predetermined transfer voltage<br>
is applied to the secondary transfer roller 118, and the<br>
composite toner image on the intermediate transfer belt 103<br>
is thereby secondarily transferred to the recording medium<br>
P.<br>
The recording medium P with the composite toner image<br>
secondarily transferred thereon is further conveyed<br>
upwardly to pass through a fixing device 119, where the<br>
toner image on the recording medium P is fixed thereon by<br>
the action of heat and pressure. The recording medium P<br>
having passed through the fixing device 119 is ejected to a<br>
paper ejection portion 122 provided on the upper side of<br>
the main unit 100 of the image forming apparatus. The<br>
remaining toner adhered to the intermediate transfer belt<br>
103 after the toner image is transferred is removed by the<br>
cleaning device 120.<br>
The image forming apparatus according to the third<br>
embodiment includes the lubricant applying device 131 so<br>
that the wear of the cleaning blade 128 and the image<br>
carrier 102Y in Fig. 11 is suppressed, and that high<br>
cleaning performance by the cleaning blade 128 can be<br>
maintained even if the spherical toner having a small<br>
particle size is used. The lubricant applying device 131<br>
is also provided in the second to fourth process cartridges<br>
107C, 107M, and 107BK, respectively, and its configuration<br>
and performance are perfectly the same as those of the<br>
process cartridge 107Y. Therefore, only the lubricant<br>
applying device 131 of the process cartridge 107Y shown in<br>
Fig. 11 is explained below.<br><br>
The lubricant applying device 131 of Fig. 11 includes<br>
a brush roller 133 that contacts the surface of the image<br>
carrier 102Y, a solid lubricant 134 that faces the brush<br>
roller 133, a lubricant holder 135 that firmly supports the<br>
solid lubricant 134, a guide 136 that guides the solid<br>
lubricant 134 through the lubricant holder 135, and a<br>
compressed coil spring 137 as one example of the pressing<br>
unit.<br>
The brush roller 133 includes a core shaft 138 and a<br>
large number of brush fibers 139 whose base portion is<br>
fixed to the core shaft 138. The brush roller 133 thus<br>
configured extends in almost parallel to and longitudinally<br>
along the image carrier 102Y, and both ends of the core<br>
shaft 138 in the longitudinal direction are rotatably<br>
supported with respect to the unit case 108 via bearings<br>
(not shown). During image formation, the brush roller 133<br>
is made to rotate in the counterclockwise direction in Fig.<br>
11.<br>
The solid lubricant 134 is formed into a rectangular<br>
solid longitudinally extending in parallel to the brush<br>
roller 133. The top surface of the solid lubricant 134 on<br>
the side facing the brush roller 133 contacts the brush<br>
fibers 139 of the brush roller 133, and the base side of<br>
the solid lubricant 134 that is opposite to the top surface<br>
is fixed to the lubricant holder 135. The guide 136<br>
according to the third embodiment includes a pair of guide<br>
plates 140 and 141 which are spaced in parallel to each<br>
other so as to face each other, and the pair of guide<br>
plates 140 and 141 is integrated into one unit by a<br>
connection plate 142. The pair of guide plates 140 and 141<br>
and the connection plate 142 are formed with a part of the<br>
unit case 108.<br>
The lubricant holder 135 is disposed between the pair<br><br>
of guide plates 140 and 141, and slidably contacts the<br>
mutually facing sides of the guide plates 140 and 141.<br>
The compressed coil spring 137 is arranged in<br>
plurality between the connection plate 142 and the<br>
lubricant holder 135 as shown in Fig. 12. The compressed<br>
coil springs 137 press the solid lubricant 134 against the<br>
brush roller 133 through the lubricant holder 135. The<br>
pressing direction is indicated by arrow C in Fig. 11.<br>
Instead of the compressed coil spring, a pressing unit such<br>
as a twisted coil spring and a plate spring can be used.<br>
The solid lubricant 134 is pressed against the brush<br>
fibers 139 of the brush roller 133 in the above manner, and<br>
the brush fibers 139 are pressed against the surface of the<br>
image carrier 102Y. At this time, the brush roller 133 is<br>
rotated, and the lubricant of the solid lubricant 134 is<br>
scraped off by the brush fibers 139 to become powdery<br>
lubricant, and the powdery lubricant scraped-off is applied<br>
to the surface of the image carrier 102Y. As explained<br>
above, the brush roller 133 is one example of a lubricant<br>
applying element that applies the powdery lubricant<br>
scraped-off from the solid lubricant 134 to the surface of<br>
the image carrier.<br>
The solid lubricant 134 is scraped by the brush roller<br>
133 and consumed, so that its thickness is reduced over<br>
time, but since the solid lubricant 134 is pressed by the<br>
compressed coil spring 137, the solid lubricant 134 can be<br>
always in contact with the brush fibers 139 of the brush<br>
roller 133.<br>
Since the surface of the image carrier 102Y is applied<br>
with the lubricant in the above manner, the frictional<br>
coefficient of the surface thereof can be suppressed to low.<br>
The wear of the image carrier 102Y and the cleaning blade<br>
128 can thereby be minimized, and their lives can be<br><br>
prolonged. Moreover, even if the spherical toner having a<br>
small particle size is used, large reduction in cleaning<br>
performance of the image carrier 102Y by the cleaning blade<br>
128 can be prevented.<br>
Furthermore, the guide 136 is provided in the<br>
lubricant applying device 131 according to the third<br>
embodiment. The guide 136 guides the lubricant holder 135<br>
and the solid lubricant 134 so that these two can move<br>
substantially only in a direction of approaching or<br>
separating from the brush roller 133, namely, in a pressing<br>
direction C of the compressed coil spring 137 and in the<br>
opposite direction thereto. Therefore, the solid lubricant<br>
134 does not largely sway in a direction E, which is<br>
perpendicular to the pressing direction C. Consequently,<br>
the solid lubricant 134 is capable of contacting the brush<br>
roller 133 along almost the same area at any time, and an<br>
almost fixed amount of lubricant can be fed to the surface<br>
of the image carrier through the brush roller 133, thereby<br>
preventing nonuniform application of the lubricant to the<br>
surface of the image carrier.<br>
If the guide 136 is not provided, as shown in Fig. 14A<br>
and Fig. 14B, the solid lubricant 134 largely sways in the<br>
direction E perpendicular to the pressing direction C of<br>
the compressed coil spring. Therefore, only a portion 143<br>
or a portion 144 of the surface of the solid lubricant 134<br>
that faces the brush roller 133 contacts the brush roller<br>
133, or the whole of the surface contacts the brush roller<br>
133. Thus, the lubricant is not uniformly applied to the<br>
image carrier 102Y, which may lead to degradation of the<br>
toner image transferred to the intermediate transfer belt<br>
103 and of the image quality of a final image formed on the<br>
recording medium P. The image forming apparatus according<br>
to the third embodiment allows prevention of such failure.<br><br>
In the image forming apparatus shown in Fig. 10, the<br>
lubricant holder 135 contacts the pair of guide plates 140<br>
and 141, and the solid lubricant 134 is guided by the guide<br>
136 through the lubricant holder 135. However, the solid<br>
lubricant 134 can be also configured to be guided directly<br>
by the guide 136. The solid lubricant 134 is guided by the<br>
guide 136 so that the solid lubricant 134 can move<br>
substantially only in the direction C in which the solid<br>
lubricant 134 approaches or separates from the brush roller<br>
133. This indicates, however, that the solid lubricant 134<br>
may sway along the direction E, which is perpendicular to<br>
the direction C, by a slight amount of allowance.<br>
As explained above, the lubricant applying device 131<br>
according to the third embodiment includes a lubricant<br>
applying element that is the brush roller 133 which<br>
contacts the image carrier 102Y while rotating, the solid<br>
lubricant 134 disposed in a location facing the lubricant<br>
applying element, the guide 136 that guides the solid<br>
lubricant 134 so that the solid lubricant 134 can move<br>
substantially only in the direction of approaching or<br>
separating from the brush roller 133, and the pressing unit<br>
that includes the compressed coil spring 137 for pressing<br>
the solid lubricant 134 against the lubricant applying<br>
element.<br>
Moreover, as shown in Fig. ll, the positions of the<br>
compressed coil spring 137 and the cleaning blade 12 8 are<br>
respectively set so that the direction C in which the<br>
compressed coil spring 137 presses the solid lubricant 134<br>
against the brush roller 133 is almost parallel to the<br>
direction in which the cleaning blade 128 is protruded<br>
toward the surface of the image carrier 102Y. Therefore,<br>
the space occupied by the cleaning blade 128, the blade<br>
holder 129, and the lubricant applying device 131 in the<br><br>
main unit of the image forming apparatus can be reduced,<br>
thereby downsizing the image forming apparatus. As shown<br>
in Fig. 15, if the pressing direction C is not parallel to<br>
the direction in which the cleaning blade 128 is protruded<br>
toward the surface of the image carrier 102Y, the whole of<br>
the cleaning blade 128, the blade holder 129, and the<br>
lubricant applying device 131 occupies a large space around<br>
the image carrier 102Y, and this large space inevitably<br>
causes upsizing of the image forming apparatus. The image<br>
forming apparatus according to the third embodiment can<br>
avoid this disadvantage with simple configuration.<br>
.Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 11, in the image forming<br>
apparatus according to the third embodiment, the blade<br>
holder 129 is directly fixed to the guide plate 140 of the<br>
guide 136 with, for example, a screw (not shown). In other<br>
words, the blade holder 129 is fixed to the guide 136 that<br>
guides the solid lubricant 134. Consequently, the<br>
parallelism between the direction in which the cleaning<br>
blade 128 is protruded toward the surface of the image<br>
carrier 102Y and the pressing direction C can be easily and<br>
surely enhanced. The blade holder 129 may be fixed to the<br>
guide 136 through some other intermediate element.<br>
In this manner, the positions of the pressing unit and<br>
the cleaning blade are respectively set so that the<br>
direction in which the pressing unit presses the solid<br>
lubricant against the lubricant applying element is almost<br>
parallel to the direction in which the cleaning blade is<br>
protruded toward the surface of the image carrier. And the<br>
blade holder is fixed to the guide, which guides the solid<br>
lubricant, directly or through another element, thereby<br>
downsizing the image forming apparatus.<br>
In the image forming apparatus as shown in Fig. 13,<br>
positions of the image carrier 102Y, the lubricant applying<br><br>
element, and the pressing unit are respectively set so that<br>
a line H and the pressing direction C are on the<br>
substantially same line I. More specifically, the line H<br>
connects between a rotation center F of the image carrier<br>
102Y and a rotation center G of the lubricant applying<br>
element such as the brush roller 133, and the pressing<br>
direction C is a pressing direction of the compressed coil<br>
spring 137 toward the solid lubricant 134. As shown in the<br>
image forming apparatus of Fig. 11, if the line H and the<br>
pressing direction C are not on the same line, the center<br>
portion of the brush roller 133 in the longitudinal<br>
direction pressed by the compressed coil spring 137 may<br>
possibly be deformed as indicated by the chain line of Fig.<br>
12, where the deformation is slightly exaggerated. If the<br>
brush roller 133 is thus deformed, the amount of the<br>
lubricant applied to the image carrier 102Y becomes<br>
nonuniform, which may cause degradation of the toner image<br>
transferred to the intermediate transfer belt 103 and of<br>
the image quality of the image on the recording medium.<br>
On the other hand, in the process cartridge 107Y as<br>
shown in Fig. 13, since the line H and the pressing<br>
direction C are on almost the same line I, the center<br>
portion of the brush roller 133 in the longitudinal<br>
direction which contacts the image carrier is surely caught<br>
on the surface of the image carrier 102Y. Therefore, the<br>
brush roller 133 is not possibly deformed unlike the<br>
deformation indicated by the chain line of Fig. 12. This<br>
allows uniform application of the lubricant to the image<br>
carrier 102Y and an increase in image quality of the toner<br>
image formed on the recording medium P. The other<br>
components of the image forming apparatus of Fig. 13 are<br>
the same as those of Fig. 10 to Fig. 12, and the same<br>
reference numerals of Fig. 11 are assigned to the<br><br>
components the same as or corresponding to the components<br>
of Fig. 11.<br>
The image forming apparatus of Fig. 11 includes a<br>
lubricant smoothing unit that serves as the smoothing blade<br>
132. The smoothing blade 132 is made of an elastic body-<br>
such as rubber. The front edge of the smoothing blade 132<br>
contacts the surface of the image carrier 102Y, and the<br>
base side thereof is fixed to a holder 145. The smoothing<br>
blade 132 is arranged in the trailing direction with<br>
respect to the movement direction of the surface of the<br>
image carrier. As is clear from Fig. 11, the lubricant<br>
applying element including the brush roller 133 is arranged<br>
on the downstream side of the cleaning blade 128 in the<br>
movement direction of the surface of the image carrier.<br>
In the configuration, the remaining toner adhered to<br>
the surface of the image carrier after the toner image is<br>
transferred is removed by the cleaning blade 128, and the<br>
surface of the image carrier 102Y thus cleaned is applied<br>
with the lubricant. The lubricant applied is uniformly<br>
spread and smoothed over the surface of the image carrier<br>
102Y while passing through the smoothing blade 132 in<br>
contact with the surface of the image carrier 102Y. This<br>
allows formation of a lubricant layer having a uniform<br>
thickness on the image carrier 102Y. In this manner, the<br>
lubricant is applied immediately after the image carrier<br>
102Y is cleaned, and the lubricant applied is smoothed,<br>
thereby preventing deviation of the application amount of<br>
the lubricant to the surface of the image carrier 102Y and<br>
deviation of the frictional coefficient of the surface<br>
thereof, and increasing the quality of image formed on the<br>
recording medium. Moreover, because the smoothing blade<br>
132 is arranged in the trailing direction with respect to<br>
the movement direction of the surface of the image carrier<br><br>
102Y, the drive torque of the image carrier 102Y can be<br>
prevented from being too high.<br>
The thickness of the brush fibers of the brush roller<br>
133 in the lubricant applying device 131 is preferably 3 to<br>
8 deniers, and the density of the brush fibers 139 is<br>
preferably 20,000 to 100,000 lines/inch2. If the thickness<br>
of the brush fiber is too thin, the bristles become easily<br>
bent when the brush roller 3a contacts the surface of the<br>
image carrier 102Y. Conversely, if the brush fiber is too<br>
thick, the density of the fibers cannot be increased. If<br>
the density of the brush fibers is low, the lubricant<br>
cannot be uniformly applied to the surface of the image<br>
carrier 102Y because the number of brush fibers contacting<br>
the surface thereof is small. Conversely, if the density<br>
of brush fibers is too high, a gap between a fiber and a<br>
fiber becomes narrower, and an adhesion amount of the<br>
powdery lubricant scraped-off is reduced, which causes a<br>
shortage of the application amount.<br>
The same solid lubricant as the solid lubricant 134 of<br>
the first embodiment is used in the third embodiment.<br>
It is preferred that the toner used in the developing<br>
device 111 is such that a volume-average particle size is<br>
10 micrometers or less and a ratio (Dv/Dn) between the<br>
volume-average particle size (Dv) and a number-average<br>
particle size (Dn) is in a range from 1.00 to 1.40, and the<br>
volume-average particle size in particular desirably ranges<br>
from 3 to 8 micrometers.<br>
By using toner particles having a small particle size,<br>
the toner particles can be densely adhered to an<br>
electrostatic latent image. However, if the volume-average<br>
particle size of toner is too small, the toner particles in<br>
the two-component developer are fused onto the surfaces of<br>
magnetic carriers during stirring of the developer for a<br><br>
long time in the developing device, to reduce the charging<br>
capability of the magnetic carriers. If a one-component<br>
developer is used as the developer, filming of the toner<br>
particles to the developing roller easily occurs, and the<br>
toner particles are easily fused onto an element such as a<br>
blade for making the toner thinner. Conversely, if the<br>
volume-average particle size is too large, it becomes<br>
difficult to obtain a high-resolution and high-quality<br>
image. When the toner particles in the developer are<br>
consumed, the balance of toner particle sizes may sometimes<br>
largely fluctuate.<br>
Furthermore, by narrowing the particle size<br>
distribution, a charge amount distribution of toner becomes<br>
uniform, thereby obtaining a high quality image with less<br>
background fogging, and increasing a transfer rate.<br>
However, when Dv/Dn exceeds 1.40, the charge amount<br>
distribution is widened and resolution decreases, which is<br>
not preferable.<br>
An average particle size and a particle size<br>
distribution of toner particles can be measured using<br>
Coulter Counter TA-II and Coulter Multisizer II (both<br>
manufactured by Coulter Electronics Limited). In the<br>
present invention, the Coulter Counter TA-II was used to<br>
measure the average particle size and the size distribution<br>
by being connected to the interface (manufactured by<br>
Nikkaki Bios Co.) which outputs a number (of particles)<br>
distribution and a volume distribution, as well as to a<br>
personal computer (PC9801: manufactured by NEC Corp.).<br>
In such toner, a proportion of wax and inorganic fine<br>
particles occupied in toner particles is increased by<br>
reducing a toner particle size. The wax is internally or<br>
externally added to toner particles to improve the release<br>
property, and the inorganic fine particles are used to<br><br>
improve the fluidity. These additives become a factor of<br>
adhesion substances produced on the image carrier. However,<br>
the lubricant applying device 131 is installed to form a<br>
thin film with uniform lubricant over the whole area on the<br>
surface of the image carrier, thereby reducing adhesion<br>
force of the adhesion substances to the surface of the<br>
image carrier 102Y. Furthermore, the installation of the<br>
lubricant applying device 131 allows reduction in the<br>
frictional force between the surface of the image carrier<br>
and the cleaning blade 128 of the cleaning device 126 or<br>
the lubricant smoothing blade 132, and performance of<br>
satisfactory cleaning.<br>
When toner used in the developing device 111 has an<br>
average circularity of 0.93 to 1.00, significant effect can<br>
be obtained as the result of applying the lubricant to the<br>
image carrier. By applying the lubricant to the image<br>
carrier, even if the toner having high circularity is used,<br>
such defect that the toner scrapes through under the<br>
cleaning blade 128 can be efficiently suppressed.<br>
The average circularity of toner is a value obtained<br>
by optically detecting a particle, projecting the particle<br>
onto a plane to obtain an area of the particle projected,<br>
and dividing the area by a circumferential length of a<br>
circle having an area eguivalent to the area of the<br>
particle projected. The average circularity is measured<br>
actually by using the flow particle image analyzer (FPIA-<br>
2000: manufactured by Sysmex Corp.). Water of 100 to 150<br>
milliliters from which impurity solid is previously removed<br>
is put into a predetermined container, 0. 1 to 0. 5<br>
milliliter of surfactant being a dispersing agent is added<br>
to the water, and sample to be measured is further added<br>
thereto by about 0.1 to 9.5 grams. A suspension with the<br>
sample dispersed therein is dispersed for about 1 to 3<br><br>
minutes by an ultrasonic disperser, and concentration of a<br>
dispersing solution is controlled to 3,000 to 10,000<br>
pieces/uL, and the shape and the distribution of toner<br>
particles are measured.<br>
The toner used in the developing device 111 has the<br>
shape factor SF-1 ranging preferably from 100 to 180 and<br>
the shape factor SF-2 ranging also preferably from 100 to<br>
180. The shape factor SF-1 indicates the degree of<br>
sphericity of toner shape. When the value of SF-1 is 100,<br>
the shape of the toner becomes perfect sphericity, and when<br>
the value of the SF-1 is larger, the toner shape becomes<br>
more irregular. The shape factor SF-2 indicates the degree<br>
of irregularities in the shape of toner. When the value of<br>
SF-2 is 100, no irregularities are found on the surface of<br>
the toner, and when the value of the SF-2 is larger, the<br>
irregularities on the surface of the toner become more<br>
significant. See JP-A No. 2002-244485 for details of these.<br>
If the shape of the toner is close to sphericity, a<br>
contact between a toner particle and a toner particle or<br>
between a toner particle and the image carrier is closer to<br>
a point contact. Therefore, fluidity becomes higher as the<br>
attracting force between toner particles gets weaker. The<br>
attracting force between the toner particle and the image<br>
carrier also gets weak, and as a result, a transfer rate<br>
becomes high. Since the spherical toner easily enters the<br>
space between the cleaning blade 128 and the image carrier<br>
102Y, the shape factor SF-1 or the shape factor SF-2 of<br>
toner should be large to some extent. However, if the SF-1<br>
and the SF-2 become too large, toner particles scatter over<br>
an image, and image quality is thereby degraded. Therefore,<br>
it is preferable that the SF-1 and the SF-2 do not exceed<br>
180. The shape factor was measured specifically by<br>
photographing toner with the scanning electron microscope<br><br>
(S-800: manufactured by Hitachi Ltd.), introducing the<br>
photograph into the image analyzer (LUZEX3: manufactured by<br>
Nireco Corp.), and analyzing and calculating it.<br>
The toner adequately used in the image forming<br>
apparatus according to the third embodiment is obtained by<br>
allowing a toner material solution to undergo crosslinking<br>
reaction and/or elongation reaction in an aqueous medium in<br>
the presence of resin fine particles. The toner material<br>
solution is a toner composition obtained by dispersing at<br>
least a polyester prepolymer having a functional group that<br>
contains nitrogen atoms, a polyester, a colorant, and a<br>
release agent in an organic solvent. The constitutional<br>
materials of the toner and the method of manufacturing the<br>
toner are the same as these in the first embodiment, and<br>
hence explanation thereof is omitted.<br>
A glass transition point (Tg) of a native polyester<br>
can be measured by the Differential Scanning Calorimeter<br>
(DSC). By using the toner manufacturing method, toner<br>
having a small particle size and a sharp particle-size<br>
distribution can be easily obtained. Furthermore, by<br>
strongly stirring the organic solvent in the process of<br>
removing it, the shape can be controlled in a range from a<br>
perfectly spherical shape to a "rugby ball" shape, and<br>
further, the morphology of the surface can also be<br>
controlled in a range from a smooth shape to a rough shape.<br>
The external toner shape is preferably almost<br>
spherical, and this is the same as that of the embodiments.<br>
In the image forming apparatus as explained above, the<br>
image carrier is formed into a drum shape, and the<br>
intermediate transfer element is formed with ah<br>
intermediate transfer belt, but the configuration according<br>
to the present invention can be employed even when the<br>
image carrier is formed with an endless belt and the<br><br>
intermediate transfer element is formed into a drum shape.<br>
The configurations according to the present invention can<br>
be used even when an image carrier that carries a toner<br>
image thereon is formed with an intermediate transfer<br>
element and a transfer material to which the toner image on<br>
the image carrier is transferred is a recording medium. In<br>
this case, the image forming apparatus is provided with the<br>
cleaning blade that removes the remaining toner adhered to<br>
the intermediate transfer element after the toner image is<br>
transferred, and the lubricant applying device for applying<br>
the lubricant to the intermediate transfer element, and the<br>
configurations are employed for these components.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is also applicable<br>
without any trouble to an image forming apparatus in which<br>
a toner image formed on one image carrier, being a<br>
photoconductor, is directly transferred to a transfer<br>
material, being a recording medium.<br>
The configurations of an image forming apparatus,<br>
imaging units, and a cleaning device according to a fourth<br>
embodiment of the present invention are the same as these<br>
of Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 18, and hence, explanation<br>
thereof is omitted.<br>
A pressing force is produced when the solid lubricant<br>
3b is pressed against and contacted with the brush roller<br>
3a upwardly as shown in Fig. 2, when it is pressed against<br>
and contacted with the brush roller 3a sidewardly as shown<br>
in Fig. 18, or when it is pressed against and contacted<br>
with the brush roller 3a downwardly (not shown). The<br>
results of obtaining the pressing force and the deviation<br>
of pressing forces between an initial time and an elapsed<br>
time (life) (initial pressing force-elapsed time pressing<br>
force) are shown in table 4.<br><br><br>
It is understood from the table 4 that the pressing<br>
force applied to the brush roller 3a and the deviation of<br>
the pressing forces are different depending on the pressing<br>
direction toward the solid lubricant 3b.<br>
The pressing force and the deviation of the pressing<br>
forces in an actual lubricant applying device are explained<br>
below. Two models, model G and model J, were used for the<br>
following comparisons, and the results of the comparisons<br>
are shown in table 5. The deviation of the pressing forces.<br><br>
when the solid lubricant 3b is pressed downwardly,<br>
increases by 42% in model G and by 22% in model J as<br>
compared with the case where the solid lubricant 3b is<br>
pressed upwardly.<br><br>
It is understood that the application amount of the<br>
lubricant largely fluctuates when the deviation of the<br>
pressing forces is large because the required application<br>
amount of the lubricant is different depending on the<br>
models and a multiplier of a pressure spring to be used is<br>
different due to restriction to layout, although the<br><br>
magnitude of the deviation cannot be compared between the<br>
models in a simple manner. The large fluctuations may lead<br>
to an excessive application in the initial stage or to a<br>
shortage of application when time is elapsed. Consequently,<br>
when the deviation of the pressing forces is smaller, more<br>
stable application can be achieved.<br>
Accordingly, the arrangement, as shown in Fig. 2, in<br>
which the solid lubricant 3b is pressed upwardly, that is,<br>
from the lower side of the brush roller 3a, allows more<br>
stable application of the lubricant as compared with the<br>
sideward application and the downward application.<br>
The configuration of the solid lubricant 3b of the<br>
lubricant applying device 3 is the same as that of Fig. 7.<br>
By providing the solid lubricant 3b and the cleaning<br>
device 8, which are configured in the above manner, in the<br>
image forming apparatus, an appropriate amount of the<br>
lubricant can be applied to the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1, thereby forming a thin film with the<br>
smoothed lubricant without nonuniform application.<br>
The solid lubricant 3b or the brush roller 3a moves in<br>
the longitudinal direction which is perpendicular to the<br>
rotation direction of the brush roller 3a, thereby<br>
preventing nonuniform application caused When the brush<br>
roller 3a unevenly contacts the solid lubricant 3b.<br>
The lubricant is applied after the remaining toner is<br>
cleaned in the above manner, and further, the lubricant<br>
applied is smoothed to form a thin film, thereby preventing<br>
both the defects occurring in "the cleaning after the<br>
application" such that the photoconductor is cleaned only<br>
after the lubricant is applied and in "the application<br>
after the cleaning" such that the lubricant is applied<br>
after the photoconductor is cleaned. More specifically,<br>
the deviation of the application amount of the lubricant<br><br>
and the deviation of the static frictional coefficient of<br>
the surface due to the "the cleaning after the application"<br>
can be prevented, and the abnormal images such as the worm<br>
hole, the image blur, and the rough image due to nonuniform<br>
lubricant layer caused by "the application after the<br>
cleaning" without smoothing it can also be prevented. At<br>
the same time, the application function of the brush roller<br>
3a can be maintained over the long period of time. Since<br>
the rubber is used for the lubricant smoothing blade 8b,<br>
even if the photoconductor 1 is moved being in contact with<br>
the lubricant smoothing blade 8b, the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 is not possibly damaged.<br>
In the present invention, the wear of the cleaning<br>
blade 8a and the surface of the photoconductor 1 can be<br>
prevented, and even if the toner having a small particle<br>
size is used, the toner remaining on the surface thereof<br>
after the toner image is transferred can be satisfactorily<br>
cleaned. Moreover, the image blur can be prevented. The<br>
image blur may occur when the surface of the photoconductor<br>
1 is affected by humidity due to excessive application of<br>
the lubricant.<br>
In the fourth embodiment, the cleaning blade 8a is<br>
used to clean the surface of the photoconductor 1, but a<br>
cleaning brush may also be used instead of the cleaning<br>
blade 8a. The cleaning brush is obtained by applying bias<br>
to a conductive brush having a resistance.between a medium<br>
resistance and a low resistance.<br>
The present invention is not limited by the<br>
embodiments, but is applicable to any device that uses the<br>
technological principles of the present invention. The<br>
photoconductor or the intermediate transfer element may be<br>
either one of a belt shape and a roller shape.<br>
In the fourth embodiment, tests were conducted by<br><br>
comparing a method according to the present invention with<br>
the conventional method. The method according to the<br>
present invention was such that the lubricant smoothing<br>
blade 8b was made to contact the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 in the trailing manner to smooth the<br>
lubricant applied. The effect of the present invention as<br>
the results of the tests is verified in the same manner as<br>
that of the second embodiment.<br>
Working examples of the present invention are<br>
explained below.<br>
Fig. 16 is a diagram of how to manufacture an image<br>
carrier having a low frictional coefficient using the<br>
lubricant applying device according to the present<br>
invention. Fig. 17 is a diagram of an image on an "angle<br>
0" between the lubricant applying device according to the<br>
present invention and a sheet-like smoothing element being<br>
its main portion, and on how the lubricant is pressed and<br>
spread.<br>
First Working Example:<br>
A lubricant applying device was prepared in the<br>
following manner. As a sheet-like smoothing element, an<br>
urethane rubber sheet having a thickness of 2 millimeters,<br>
manufactured by Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd., was used<br>
and set in a trailing posture so that a contact pressure<br>
can be changed in a range of 25±10 (g/cm) and a contact<br>
angle in a range of 0 to 90 degrees upon setting of a<br>
photoconductor. And, as an applying brush, a conductive<br>
nylon brush having a bristle length of 3 millimeters,<br>
manufactured by Toeisangyo Co., Ltd., was used and set so<br>
that the applying brush was pressed into the photoconductor<br>
by an amount of 1 millimeter. The lubricant applying<br>
device thus prepared was used to run idle (approximately 5<br>
to 10 minutes) until the lubricant was sufficiently applied<br><br>
to the photoconductor, and the photoconductor with the<br>
sufficient lubricant was used to prepare a process<br>
cartridge.<br>
The process cartridge was set in imagio NeoC325<br>
manufactured by Ricoh Co., Ltd., and 1,000 sheets of paper<br>
were continuously passed through the cartridge on the<br>
condition of the image formed on A4-size white paper passed<br>
therethrough in horizontal orientation, under the<br>
environment of 35° C., 80%. The results are as follows.<br>
When the contact angle was less than 10 degrees, a cleaning<br>
sheet was rolled in (indicated by "cross:x" in table 6),<br>
but in the other cases, no sheet roll-in occurred<br>
(indicated by "circle:o" in table 6).<br><br>
Second Working Example:<br>
A lubricant applying device was prepared in the<br>
following manner. As a sheet-like smoothing element, an<br>
urethane rubber sheet having a thickness of 1.6 millimeters,<br>
manufactured by Hokushin Corp., was used and set in a<br>
trailing posture so that a contact pressure can be changed<br>
in a range of 55+10 (g/cm) and a contact angle in a range<br>
of 0 to 90 degrees upon setting of a photoconductor. And,<br>
as an applying brush, a conductive nylon brush having a<br>
bristle length of 2.5 millimeters, manufactured by Tsuchiya<br>
Co., Ltd., was used and set so that the applying brush was<br>
pressed into a photoconductor by an amount of 0.5<br>
millimeter. The lubricant applying device thus prepared<br>
was used to run idle (approximately 5 to 10 minutes) until<br><br>
the lubricant was sufficiently applied to the<br>
photoconductor, and the photoconductor with the sufficient<br>
lubricant was used to prepare a process cartridge.<br>
The process cartridge was set in imagio NeoC325<br>
manufactured by Ricoh Co., Ltd., and 1,000 sheets of paper<br>
were continuously passed through the cartridge on the<br>
condition of the image formed on A4-size white paper passed<br>
therethrough in horizontal orientation, under the<br>
environment of 35° C, 80%. The results are as follows.<br>
When the contact angle was less than 10 degrees, a cleaning<br>
sheet was rolled in (indicated by "cross:x" in table 7),<br>
but in the other cases, no sheet roll-in occurred<br>
(indicated by "circle:o" in table 7).<br><br>
Third Working Example:<br>
A lubricant applying device was prepared in the<br>
following manner. As a sheet-like smoothing element, an<br>
urethane rubber sheet having a thickness of 1.5 millimeters,<br>
manufactured by Toyo Tire and Rubber Co., Ltd., was used<br>
and set in a trailing posture so that a contact pressure<br>
can be changed in a range of 20±10 (g/cm) and a contact<br>
angle in a range of 0 to 90 degrees upon setting of a<br>
photoconductor. And, as an applying brush, a conductive<br>
nylon brush having a bristle length of 3 millimeters,<br>
manufactured by Tsuchiya Co., Ltd., was used and set so<br>
that the applying brush was pressed into the photoconductor<br>
by an amount of 1 millimeter. The lubricant applying<br>
device thus prepared was used to run idle (approximately 5<br><br>
to 10 minutes) until the lubricant was sufficiently applied<br>
to the photoconductor, and the photoconductor with the<br>
sufficient lubricant was used to prepare a process<br>
cartridge.<br>
The process cartridge was set in imagio NeoC325<br>
manufactured by Ricoh Co., Ltd., and 1,000 sheets of paper<br>
were continuously passed through the cartridge on the<br>
condition of the image formed on A4-size white paper passed<br>
therethrough in horizontal orientation, under the<br>
environment of 35° C, 80%. The results are as follows.<br>
When the contact angle was less than 10 degrees, a cleaning<br>
sheet was rolled in (indicated by "cross:x" in table 8),<br>
but in the other cases, no sheet roll-in occurred<br>
(indicated by "circle:o" in table 8).<br><br>
Fourth Working Example:<br>
A process cartridge was prepared in the following<br>

"cross:x" in table 11), but in the other cases, no such<br>
problem occurred (indicated by "circle:0" in table 11).<br><br>
In the image forming apparatus according to the<br>
present invention, toner used in the developing device 4<br>
preferably has the volume-average particle size ranging<br>
from 3 to 8 micrometers, and has a ratio (Dv/Dn) between<br>
the volume-average particle size (Dv) and the number-<br>
average particle size (Dn) ranging from 1.00 to 1.40.<br>
By using toner particles having a small particle size,<br>
the toner particles can be densely adhered to a latent<br>
image.. However, if the volume-average particle size is<br>
smaller than the range of the present invention, toner<br>
particles in a two-component developer are fused onto the<br><br>
surfaces of magnetic carriers during its stirring for a<br>
long period of time in the developing device, to reduce the<br>
charging capability of the magnetic carriers. If a one-<br>
component developer is used as the developer, filming of<br>
the toner particles to the developing roller easily occurs,<br>
and the toner particles are easily fused to an element such<br>
as a blade for making the toner thinner. Conversely, if<br>
the volume-average particle size is larger than the range<br>
of the present invention, it becomes difficult to obtain a<br>
high-resolution and high-quality image. When toner<br>
particles in the developer are consumed, the balance of<br>
toner particle sizes may sometimes largely fluctuate.<br>
Furthermore, by narrowing the particle size<br>
distribution, a charge amount distribution of toner becomes<br>
uniform, thereby obtaining a high quality image with less<br>
background fogging, and increasing a transfer rate.<br>
However, when Dv/Dn exceeds 1.40, the charge amount<br>
distribution is widened and resolution decreases, which is<br>
not preferable.<br>
An average particle size and a particle size<br>
distribution of toner particles can be measured using<br>
Coulter Counter TA-II and Coulter Multisizer II (both<br>
manufactured by Coulter Electronics Limited). In the<br>
present invention, the Coulter Counter TA-II was used to<br>
measure the average particle size and the size distribution<br>
by being connected to an interface (manufactured by Nikkaki<br>
Bios Co.) which outputs a number (of particles)<br>
distribution and a volume distribution, as well as to a<br>
personal computer (PC9801: manufactured by NEC Corp.) .<br>
In such toner, a proportion of wax and inorganic fine<br>
particles occupied in toner particles is increased by<br>
reducing toner particle size as compared with that of<br>
conventional toner particles. The wax is internally or<br><br>
externally added to toner particles to improve the release<br>
property, and the inorganic fine particles are used to<br>
improve the fluidity. These additives become a factor of<br>
adhesion substances produced on the photoconductor 1. The<br>
lubricant applying device 3 according to the present<br>
invention is therefore installed to form a thin film with<br>
uniform lubricant over the whole area on the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1, thereby reducing adhesion force of the<br>
adhesion substances to the surface of the photoconductor 1.<br>
Furthermore, the frictional force between the surface of<br>
the photoconductor 1 and the cleaning blade 8a of the<br>
cleaning device 8 or the lubricant smoothing blade 8b is<br>
reduced to enable satisfactory cleaning.<br>
When toner particles used in the developing device 4<br>
have high circularity such as an average circularity of<br>
0.93 or higher, the effect of providing the cleaning device<br>
8 of the present invention in an image forming apparatus is<br>
significant. The toner particles having high circularity<br>
easily enter the space between the photoconductor 1 and the<br>
cleaning blade during cleaning using the blade system, and<br>
easily slip through the space. If the contact pressure of<br>
the cleaning blade to the photoconductor 1 is increased,<br>
the photoconductor 1 is largely damaged. Further, in the<br>
method of applying a bias having opposite polarity to<br>
charge polarity of toner, to the brush roller, and<br>
electrostatically collecting toner, it is difficult to<br>
remove the toner from the brush roller. Therefore,<br>
electrostatic toner removal capability tends to decrease<br>
gradually.<br>
However, the cleaning device 8 of the present<br>
invention allows efficient cleaning of the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1 in the following manner even if the toner<br>
particles have high average circularity. More specifically,<br><br>
at first, the toner particles remaining on the<br>
photoconductor 1 are electrostatically collected by the<br>
electrostatic cleaning element, and then, the remaining<br>
toner particles are finally scraped off by the cleaning<br>
blade 8a and removed. Thus, efficient cleaning can be<br>
performed without damage to the surface of the<br>
photoconductor 1.<br>
The average circularity of toner is a value obtained<br>
by optically detecting a particle, projecting the particle<br>
onto a plane to obtain an area of the particle projected,<br>
and dividing the area by a circumferential length of a<br>
circle having an area equivalent to the area of the<br>
particle projected. Actually, the average circularity is<br>
measured by using a flow particle image analyzer (FPIA-<br>
2000: manufactured by Sysmex Corp.). Water of 100 to 150<br>
milliliters from which impurity solid is previously removed<br>
is put into a predetermined container, 0. 1 to 0. 5<br>
milliliter of surfactant being a dispersing agent is added<br>
to the water, and sample to be measured is further added<br>
thereto by about 0.1 to 9.5 grams. A suspension with the<br>
sample dispersed therein is dispersed for about 1 to 3<br>
minutes by an ultrasonic disperser, and concentration of a<br>
dispersing solution is controlled to 3,000 to 10,000<br>
pieces/jj.L, and the shape and the distribution of toner<br>
particles are measured.<br>
The toner used in the image forming apparatus<br>
according to the present invention has the shape factor SF-<br>
1 ranging preferably from 100 to 180 and the shape factor<br>
SF-2 ranging also preferably from 100 to 180.<br>
The toner adequately used in the image forming<br>
apparatus according to the present invention is obtained by<br>
allowing toner material solution to undergo crosslinking<br>
reaction and/or elongation reaction in an aqueous medium.<br><br>
The toner material solution is obtained by dispersing at<br>
least a polyester prepolymer having a functional group that<br>
contains nitrogen atoms, a polyester, a colorant, and a<br>
release agent in an organic solvent.<br>
The constitutional materials of toner and the method<br>
of manufacturing toner are also the same as these of the<br>
first embodiment, and explanation thereof is omitted.<br>
The molecular weight of polymer produced with modified<br>
polyester can be measured, using Gel Permeation<br>
Chromatography (GPC), with THF as a solvent.<br>
The shape of the toner according to the fourth<br>
embodiment is almost spherical, and this is as explained<br>
above.<br>
More specifically, the toner manufactured can be used<br>
as one-component magnetic toner that does not use magnetic<br>
carrier or as non-magnetic toner.<br>
When the toner is used for the two-component developer,<br>
the toner may be mixed with magnetic carrier. The magnetic<br>
carrier is ferrite that contains divalent metal such as<br>
iron, magnetite, Mn, Zn, and Cu, and its volume-average<br>
particle size is preferably 20 to 100 micrometers. If the<br>
average particle size is less than 20 micrometers, then the<br>
carrier is easily adhered to the photoconductor 1 upon<br>
development. If it exceeds 100 micrometers, then carrier<br>
is not easily mixed with toner, and the charge amount of<br>
toner is not sufficient. Therefore, charging failure<br>
easily occurs during continuous use. Zn-containing Cu<br>
ferrite is preferred because its saturated magnetization is<br>
high, but it can be selected as required according to the<br>
process of the image forming apparatus 100. Resin covering<br>
the magnetic carrier is not particularly limited, but<br>
includes, for example, the resin includes silicone resin,<br>
styrene-acrylic resin, fluororesin, and olefin resin. The<br><br>
manufacturing method of the resin may be either one of<br>
methods as follows: a method of dissolving coating resin in<br>
a solvent and spraying the solvent into a fluidized bed to<br>
coat carrier cores, and another method of electrostatically<br>
adhering resin particles to core particles and thermally<br>
fusing the resin particles to cover the core particles.<br>
The thickness of the core particle covered with resin is<br>
0.05 to 10 micrometers, preferably 0.3 to 4 micrometers.<br>
