Cross-reference to related application<br>
This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to provisional application Serial No. 60/922,883, filed April 11, 2007.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to polyurethane systems which cure hy radiation and thermal action with crosslinking, and the use thereof for the production of holographic media.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In the production of holographic media, as described in US 6,743,552, information is stored in a polymer layer which substantially consists of a matrix polymer and very special polymerizable monomers distributed uniformly therein. This matrix polymer may be based on polyurethane. It is prepared as a rule starting from NCO-functional prepolymers which are crosslinked with polyols, such as polyethers or polyesters, with urethane formation.<br>
However, what is problematic is that optical impairment, such as opacity phenomena of the storage layer, frequently occurs owing to the incompatibilities between such urethane matrices and radiation-curing monomers.<br>
Systems comprising polyisocyanates, polyols and radiation-curing compounds, such as photochemically crosslinking reactive diluents, are known in individual cases from the area of coating technology (US 4,247,578, DE 197 09 560). Polyol components mentioned are substantially polyether- or polyester-based ones or polyacrylatepolyols. Nothing specific is stated regarding their compatibilities with the olefinically unsaturated compounds likewise present, such as aery late-based reactive diluents.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide polyurethane systems which are suitable for the production of storage layers for holographic storage media and which have optically satisfactory compatibility of polyurethane matrix polymer with the olefinically unsaturated radiation-curing monomers present therein.<br>
It has now been found that excellent compatibility of matrix polymer with the unsaturated monomers is obtained precisely when isocyanate-reactive block copolymers are used as a building block for the matrix polymers.<br>
The invention relates to polyurethane systems comprising<br>
A)	polyisocyanates,<br>
B)	isocyanate-reactive block copolymers,<br>
C)	compounds having groups which react on exposure to actinic radiation with ethylenically unsaturated compounds with polymerization (radiation-curing groups),<br>
D)	optionally free radical stabilizers and<br>
E)	photoinitiators.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As used herein in the specification and claims, including as used in the examples and unless otherwise expressly specified, all numbers may be read as if prefaced by the word "about", even if the term does not expressly appear. Also, any numerical range recited herein is intended to include all sub-ranges subsumed therein.<br>
In the context of the present invention, block copolymers are understood as meaning polymeric compounds which consist of two or more blocks having in each case polymer chains which are uniform with respect to monomers and are chemically bonded to one another, preferably linearly.<br><br>

The polyester segments may also be based on natural raw materials, such as caster oil. It is also possible for the polyester segments to be based on homo- or copolymers of lactones, as can preferably be obtained by an addition reaction of lactones or lactone mixtures, such as butyrolactone, e-caprolactone and/or methyl-e-caprolactone, with hydroxyl-functional compounds, such as polyhydric alcohols having an OH functionality<br><br>
of &gt; 2, for example of the abovementioned type, or hydroxyl-functional segments of the polymer.<br>
The polyols on which the polyester segments are based preferably have number average molar masses of from 400 to 4000 g/mol, particularly preferably from 500 to 2000 g/mol. Their OH functionality is preferably from 1.5 to 3.5, particularly preferably from 1.8 to 3.0.<br>

Suitable diols or diol mixtures comprise the polyhydric alcohols mentioned per se in relation to the polyester segments and having an OH functionality of &gt; 2, preferably 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol and/or 3-methyl-l,5-pentanediol.<br>
The polyols on which the polycarbonate segments are based preferably have number average molar masses of from 400 to 4000 g/mol, particularly preferably from 500 to 2000 g/mol. The OH functionality of these polyols is preferably from 1.8 to 3.2, particularly preferably from 1.9 to 3.0.<br>
Polyether segments are usually based on polyadducts of cyclic ethers with OH- or NH-functional initiator molecules, which polyadducts optionally have a block structure.<br>
Suitable cyclic ethers are, for example, styrene oxides, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, tetrahydrofuran, butylene oxide, epichlorohydrin and any desired mixtures thereof.<br>
Initiators which may be used are the polyhydric alcohols mentioned per se in relation to the polyester segments and having an OH functionality of &gt; 2 and primary or secondary amines and aminoalcohols. It is also possible for hydroxyl-functional segments of the polymer to serve as initiators for the polyether block.<br>
The polyols on which the polyether segments are based preferably have number average molar masses of from 250 to 10 000 g/mol,.particularly preferably from 500 to 4000<br><br>
g/mol and very particularly preferably from 600 to 2000 g/mol. The OH functionality is preferably from 1.5 to 4.0, particularly preferably from 1.8 to 3.0.<br>
The block copolymers are usually synthesized starting from a di- or polyhydroxy-functional compound of the type described in relation to the segments, with which the further blocks are subjected to subsequent polyaddition or polycondensation. Depending on the OH functionality and number of subsequent blockwise addition or condensation steps, two-, three-, tetra- or multi-block copolymers are obtained.<br>
The synthesis is preferably effected starting from a polycarbonate-, polyether- or polyester-based dihydroxy-functional compound of the type described above in relation to the segments, with which lactones such as butyrolactone, e-caprolactone, methyl-e-caprolactone, y-phenyl-e-caprolactone or s-decanolactone are subjected to a blockwise addition reaction. In this way, linear three- or multi-block copolymers form, for example having the composition poly(lactone)-block-poly(carbonate)-block-poly(lactone) or poly(lactone)-block-poly(ether)-block-poly(lactone)orpoly(lactone)-block-poly(ester)-block-poly(lactone) with terminal hydroxyl groups.<br>

The block copolymers according to the invention are obtained, for example, by subjecting the following block to an addition or condensation reaction with a preferably dihydroxy-functional polyol block in the abovementioned manner. In the case of lactone blocks, suitable lactones are added and a suitable catalyst for polymerization is added.

Epoxy acrylates also suitable as component C) can be obtained as reaction products of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether with hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates and carboxylic acids, the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether first being reacted with hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate with catalysis by Lewis acid and this hydroxyl-functional reaction product then being esterified with a carboxylic acid by a method known to the person skilled in the art. Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether itself and brominated variants, such as, for example, tetrabromobisphenol A diglycidyl ether (from Dow Chemical, D.E.R. 542), can advantageously be used as the diepoxide. All hydroxyl-functional acrylates described above can be used as hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates, in particular 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, 4-hydroxybutyl acrylate, poly(e-caprolactone) mono (meth)acrylates and poly(ethylene glycol) mono(meth)acrylates. All monofunctional carboxylic acids are in principle suitable as the carboxylic acid, in particular those having aromatic substituents. Propane-2,2- diylbis[(2,6-dibromo-4,l-phenylene)oxy(2-{[3,3,3-tris(4-chlorophenyl)propanoyl]oxy} propane-3,1 -diyl)oxyethane-2,1 -diyl] diacrylate has proved to be a preferred compound of this class of epoxy acrylates.<br>

One or more free radical stabilizers are used as component D). Inhibitors and antioxidants, as described in "Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry]" (Houben-Weyl), 4th edition, volume XIV/1, page 433 et seq., Georg Thieme<br><br>
Verlag, Stuttgart 1961, are suitable. Suitable classes of substances are, for example, phenols, such as for example, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, cresols, hydroquinones, benzyl alcohols, such as benzhydrol, optionally also quinones, such as, for example, 2,5-di-tert-butylquinone, optionally also aromatic amines, such as diisopropylamine or phenothiazine. Preferred free radical stabilizers are 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, phenothiazine and benzhydrol.<br>
One or more photoinitiators are used as component E). These are usually initiators which can be activated by actinic radiation and initiate a free radical polymerization of the corresponding polymerizable groups. Photoinitiators are commercially sold compounds known per se, a distinction being made between monomolecular (type I) and bimolecular (type H) initiators. (Type I) systems are, for example, aromatic ketone compounds, e.g. benzophenones, in combination with tertiary amines, alkylbenzophenones, 4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)benzophenone (Michler's ketone), anthrone and halogenated benzophenones or mixtures of said types. (Type II) initiators, such as benzoin and its derivatives, benzyl ketals, acylphosphine oxides, e.g. 2,4,6-tri-<br>
methylbenzoyldiphenylphosphine oxide, bisacylophosphine oxides, phenylglyoxylic acid esters, camphorquinone, a-aminoalkylphenones, a,a-dialkoxyacetophenones, l-[4-(phenylthio)phenyl]octane-1,2-dione-2-(0-benzoyloxime) and a-hydroxyalkylphenones, are furthermore suitable. The photoinitiator systems described in EP-A 0223587 and consisting of a mixture of an ammonium arylborate and one or more dyes can also be used as a photoinitiator. For example, tetrabutylammonium triphenylhexylborate, tetrabutylammonium tris-(3-fluorophenyl)hexylborate and tetramethylammonium tris-(3-chloro-4-methylphenyl)hexylborate are suitable as the ammonium arylborate. Suitable dyes are, for example, new methylene blue, thionine, Basic Yellow, pinacyanol chloride, rhodamine 6G, gallocyanine, ethyl violet, Victoria Blue R, Celestine Blue, quinaldine red, crystal violet, brilliant green, Astrazon Orange G, Darrow Red, pyronine Y, Basic Red 29, pyrillium I, cyanine, methylene blue and azure A.<br>
It may also be advantageous to use mixtures of these compounds. Depending on the radiation source used for curing, type and concentration must be adapted to photoinitiator in a manner known to the person skilled in the art. Further details are described, for<br><br>
example, in P. K. T. Oldring (Ed.), Chemistry &amp; Technology of UV &amp; EB Formulations For Coatings, Inks &amp; Paints, vol. 3, 1991, SITA Technology, London, pages 61-328.<br>
Preferred photoinitiators are 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyldiphenylphosphine oxide, l-[4-(phenylthio)phenyl]octane-l,2-dione-2-(0-benzoyloxime) and mixtures of tetrabutylammonium tris(3-fluorophenyl)hexylborate, tetramethylammonium tris(3-chloro-4-methylphenyl)hexylborate with dyes, such as, for example, methylene blue, new methylene blue, azure A, pyrillium I, cyanine, gallocyanine, brilliant green, crystal violet and thionine.<br>

The PU systems according to the invention are usually obtained by a procedure in which first all components, except for the polyisocyanates A) are mixed with one another. This can be achieved by all methods and apparatuses known per se to the person skilled in the art from mixing technology, such as, for example stirred vessels or both dynamic and static mixers. The temperatures during this procedure are from 0 to 100°C, preferably from 10 to 80°C, particularly preferably from 20 to 60°C. This mixture can immediately be further processed or can be stored as a storage-stable, intermediate, optionally for several months.<br>
If necessary, degassing can also be carried out under a vacuum of, for example, 1 mbar.<br>
The mixing with the polyisocyanate component A) is then effected shortly before the application, it likewise being possible to use the customary mixing techniques. However, apparatuses without any, or with only little dead space are preferred. Furthermore, methods in which the mixing is effected within a very short time and with very vigorous mixing of the two mixed components are preferred. Dynamic mixers, in particular those in which the components A) and B) to E) first come into contact with one another in the mixer are particularly suitable for this purpose. This mixing can be effected at temperatures of from 0 to 80°C, preferably at from 5 to 50°C, particularly preferably from 10 to 40°C. The mixture of the two components A and B can optionally also be degassed after the mixing under a vacuum of, for example, 1 mbar in order to remove the residual gases and to prevent the formation of bubbles in the polymer layer. The mixing gives a clear, liquid formulation which, depending on the composition, cures within a few seconds to a few hours at room temperature.<br>
The PU systems according to the invention are preferably adjusted so that the curing at room temperature begins within minutes to one hour. In a preferred embodiment, the curing is accelerated by heating the formulation after mixing to temperatures between 30 and 180°C, preferably from 40 to 120°C, particularly preferably from 50 to 100°C.<br><br>
Immediately after mixing of all components, the polyurethane systems according to the invention have viscosities at room temperature of, typically from 10 to 100 000 mPas, preferably from 100 to 20 000 mPas, particularly preferably from 500 to 10 000 mPas, so that they have very good processing properties even in solvent-free form. In a solution with suitable solvents viscosities at room temperature of less than 10 000 mPa-s, preferably less than 2000 mPa-s, particularly preferably less than 500 mPa-s, can be established.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to the polymers obtainable from PU systems according to the invention.<br>
These preferably have glass transition temperatures of less than -10°C, preferably less than -25°C and particularly preferably less than -40°C.<br>
According to a preferred process the formulation according to the invention is applied directly after mixing to a substrate it being possible to use all customary methods known to the person skilled in the art in coating technology; in particular, the coating can be applied by knife coating, casting, printing, screen printing, spraying or inkjet printing.<br>
The substrates may be plastic, metal, wood, paper, glass, ceramic and composite materials comprising a plurality of these materials, in a preferred embodiment the substrate having the form of a sheet.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the coating of the substrate with the formulation is carried out in a continuous process. As a rule the formulation according to the invention is applied as a film having a thickness of from 5 mm to 1 µm, preferably from 500 µm to 5 µm, particularly preferably from 50 µm to 8 µm and very particularly preferably from 25 µm to 10 µm to the substrate.<br>
In the case of a sheet as a substrate, flexible, coated sheets are thus obtained, which sheets, in the case of a continuous process, can be rolled up after curing and thus stored over several months.<br><br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the formulation is applied so that it is covered on both sides by transparent substrates, in particular plastic or glass, for this purpose the formulation being poured between the substrates held at an exact spacing of from 1 to 2 mm, preferably from 1.2 to 1.8 mm, particularly preferably from 1.4 to 1.6 mm, in particular 1.5 mm, and the substrates being kept at the exact spacing until the formulation has completely solidified and can no longer flow.<br>
The materials used as the substrate can of course have a plurality of layers. It is possible both for the substrate to consist of layers of a plurality of different materials and for it additionally to have, for example, coatings having additional properties, such as improved adhesion, enhanced hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties, improved scratch resistance, antireflection properties in certain wavelength ranges, improved evenness of the surface, etc.<br>
The materials obtained by one of the methods described can then be used for the recording of holograms. For this purpose, two light beams are caused to interfere in the material by a method known to the person skilled in the art of holography (P. Hariharan, Optical Holography 2nd Edition, Cambridge University Press, 1996) so that a hologram forms. The exposure of the hologram can be effected both by continuous and by pulsed irradiation. It is optionally also possible to produce more than one hologram by exposure in the same material and at the same point, it being possible to use, for example, the angle multiplexing method known to the person skilled in the art of holography. After the exposure of the hologram, the material can optionally also be exposed to a strong, broadband light source and the hologram then used without further necessary processing steps. The hologram can optionally also be further processed by further processing steps, for example transfer to another substrate, deformed, insert-molded, adhesively bonded to another surface, or covered with a scratch-resistant coating.<br>
The holograms produced by one of the processes described can serve for data storage, for the representation of images which serve, for example, for the three-dimensional representation of persons or objects and for the authentification of a person or of an<br><br>
article, for the production of an optical element having the function of a lens, a mirror, a filter, a diffusion screen, a diffraction element, an optical waveguide and/or a mask.<br>
The invention therefore furthermore relates to the use of the PU systems according to the invention in the production of holographic media, and to the holographic media as such.<br>
