This invention relates to a speed variation system for textile machines particularly but not exclusively for ring spinning machines. During spinning session, while the yarn is being wound in an empty cop, it is essential for the bottom of the yarn package to have higher yarn content than the corresponding top portion of the package which has relatively lesser yarn content. This precondition is essential to avoid frequent end breaks during spinning operations. In order to achieve this, the spindle is allowed to run initially at a slower speed for a predetermined period of time depending on the length of the yarn that is being processed. The speed is varied after the desired package content is obtained.<br>
In conventional machines, the main drive is translated to the spindle through a variating means. This variator means has top and bottom pulleys connected by a 'V shaped belt driving medium. The top pulley is made up of two separate discs with adjustable means for reducing or increasing the distance between the two discs. This reduction or increase of distance between the discs results in the up or down movement of the V belt, thereby effecting a change in the driving diameter of the top and the bottom pulleys causing spaed variation. Thus, when the discs are closer, the rotational diameter of the top pulley increases and that of the bottom pulley decreases thereby causing an increase in the speed of the bottom pulley.  On the other hand<br><br>
when the distance between the disc is increased, the rotational diameter of the top pulley reduces and the speed of the bottom pulley consequently becomes slower. The variation in spindle speed is achieved by connecting the main drive means to the top pulley and the spindle to the bottom pulley of the variator. One disc is fixedly mounted and the other disc is connected to an adjusting hand which is actuated by pneumatic means, thus enabling adjustment of the distance between the two discs. However, this system affords only two speed variations. Because of the two step limitation the production speed is limited and cannot be optimized for higher productivity. Further developments were made to overcome this limitation so that multiple step speeds were made possible. The above developments require input of values of the delivery length and step increase by the user. The speed changes obtained by this method is not in small values and causes higher yarn tension possibly leading to more end breaks. Further, the speed instability of the system leads to hunting. Hunting reduces the yarn quality and the life of the machinery. Another drawback of this sytem is in the time consuming process of keeping the flow valve frequently tuned.<br>
Speed variation system which is controlled, programmed and net worked has been developed to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of the existing system. The control and program means create  automatically smooth speed curve and convert  them  into<br><br>
pulses for actuating conventional speed regulating neans thereby avoiding abrupt change in speed and hunting associated with conventional systens.<br>
The speed variation systen for textile nachines, according to this invention conprises variator neans, control neans, progranne neans and valve neans, wherein said control neans Is capable of neasurlng and storing spindle speed of said textile nachine, said progranne neans is capable of generating snooth speed pulse signals from the speed data supplied thereto, by said control neans to actuate the valve neans through pulse train for regulating said variator.<br>
The variator may be pneunatic variators known conventionally in the art having two pulleys connected by a 'V belt drive where one of the pulleys has adjustable neans for varying the rotational dianeter of the *V' belt. This pneunatic actuation nay be a close loop systen for receiving connands continuously fron the control neans for nonitoring speed variation and for adjusting pulse supply for snooth control.<br>
Alternatively, the variator nay consist of a cone drive system comprising two cones arranged one above the other in the opposite direction. These cones are connected by a flat belt means having means for moving the belt through the length of the cones for changing the dianeters of the drive and the driven neans.<br><br>
The control means is a programable micro processor. This control and the programme means are capable of storing a plurality of parameters and are designed to copy programmes between machines. This enables networking and replacement of one programme value by another. Operation of machines of any desired destination becomes possible through networking.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the figures in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig 1 is the block diagram of the speed variation system wherein the variator is the pulley drive means with a 'V belt.<br>
Fig. II is the block diagram showing the speed variator system having a cone drive means with a flat belt.<br>
In Fig I, the block Cy stands for the cylinder to which the system S consisting of control means, programme means and valve means are connected. The system is actuatably connected to the pneumatic means consisting of discs D and D'. M stands for the motor and B the belt drivably connected to the pneumatic means. Depending on the pulse signals transforming smooth speed curve, the distance between discs D and D' is altered causing the belt to move up or down. As already stated when the discs are closer, the rotational diameter of top pulley increases and the bottom pulley decreases, resulting in speed change. Since the signals are regulated and constructed abrupt change is avoided.<br><br>
The valve in the system may be electronically controlled to transmit pulses for actuating the pneumatic means.<br>
In Fig, II, Cy, S, M and B represent the cylinder, the system the motor and the belt which C and C are the cones of the drive arranged one above the other.<br>
Though this invention has been described hereinabove with a specific embodiment, obvious alteration and modifications are not excluded from the appended claims.<br><br><br>
