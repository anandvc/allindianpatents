				<td>PHENETHANOLAMINE DERIVATIVES FOR TREATMENT OF RESPIRATORY DISEASES<br>
The present invention is concerned with phenethanolamine derivatives, processes for their<br>
preparation, compositions containing them and their use in medicine, particularly in the<br>
prophylaxis and treatment of respiratory diseases.<br>
Certain phenethanolamine compounds are known in the art as having selective stimulant action<br>
at β2-adrenoreceptors and therefore having utility in the treatment of bronchial asthma and<br>
related disorders. Thus GB 2 140 800 describes phenethanolamine compounds including 4-<br>
hydroxy-α1-[[[6-(4-phenylbutoxy)hexyl]amino]methyl]-l,3-benzenedimethanol l-hydroxy-2-<br>
naphthalenecarboxylate (salmeterol xinafoate) which is now used clinically in the treatment of<br>
such medical conditions.<br>
Although salmeterol and the other commercially available β2-adrenoreceptor agonists are<br>
effective bronchodilators, the maximum duration of action is 12 hours, hence twice daily dosing<br>
is often required. There is therefore a clinical need for compounds having potent and selective<br>
stimulant action at β2.adrenoreceptors and having an advantageous profile of action.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a compound of formula (I)<br><br>
or a salt, solvate, or physiologically functional derivative thereof, wherein:<br>
m is an integer of from 2 to 8;<br>
n is an integer of from 3 to 11, preferably from 3 to 7;<br>
with the proviso that m + n is 5 to 19, preferably 5 to 12;<br>
R1 is -XSO2NR6R7<br>
wherein X is -(CH2)P- or C2-6 alkenylene;<br>
R6 and R7 are independently selected from hydrogen, C1-6alkyl,<br>
C3-7cycloalkyl, C(O)NR8R9, phenyl, and phenyl (C1-4alkyl)-,<br>
or R6 and R7, together with the nitrogen to which they are bonded, form a 5-, 6-, or 7- membered<br>
nitrogen containing ring,<br>
and R6 and R7 are each optionally substituted by one or two groups selected from halo,<br>
C1-6alkyl, C1-6haloalkyl, C1-6alkoxy, hydroxy-substituted C1-6alkoxy, -CO2R8, -SO2NRgR9,<br><br>
-CONRV, -NR8C(O)R9, or a 5-, 6- or 7-membered heterocyiic ring;<br>
R8 and R9 are independently selected from hydrogen, C1-6alkyl,<br>
C3-6CycloaIkyl, phenyl, and phenyl (C1-4alkyl)-; and<br>
p is an integer of from 0 to 6, preferably from 0 to 4;<br>
R2 and R3 are independently selected from hydrogen, C1-6alkyl, C1-6alkoxy, halo, phenyl, and<br>
C1-6haloalkyl; and<br>
R4 and R5 are independently selected from hydrogen and C1-4alkyl with the proviso that the total<br>
number of carbon atoms in R4 and R5 is not more than 4.<br>
In the compounds of formula (I) the group R1 is preferably attached to the meta-position relative<br>
to the -0-(CH2)n- link.<br>
R1 preferably represents -SO2NR6R7 wherein R6 and R7 are independently selected from<br>
hydrogen and C1-6alkyl, more preferably R1 is -SO2NH2.<br>
R4 and R5 are preferably independently selected from hydrogen and methyl, more preferably R4<br>
and R5 are both hydrogen.<br>
m is suitably 4, 5, or 6, and n is suitably 3,4, 5 or 6. Preferably m is 5 or 6 and n is 3 or 4, such<br>
that m + n is 8, 9 or 10, preferably 9.<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of formula (1a)<br><br>
or a salt, solvate, or physiologically functional derivative thereof, wherein<br>
R1 is as defined above for formula (I).<br>
According to a further preferred aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of<br>
formula (1b)<br><br><br>
or a salt, solvate, or physiologically functional derivative thereof, wherein<br>
R1 is as defined above for formula (I).<br>
In the compounds of formulae (la) and (lb), the group R' is preferably attached to the rneta-<br>
position relative to the -0-(CH2)n-, -0-(CH2)4- or -0-(CH2)3- link respectively.<br>
In the compounds of formulae (1a) and (1b), R1 is preferably -SO2NR6R7 wherein R6 and R7 are<br>
independently selected from hydrogen and C1-6alkyl, more preferably R1 is -SO2NH2.<br>
It is to be understood that the present invention covers all combinations of particular and<br>
preferred groups described hereinabove.<br>

and salts, solvates, and physiologically functional derivatives thereof.<br>
Of these compounds, 3-(4-{[6-({(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-[4-hydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-<br>
phenyl]ethyl}amino)hexyl]oxy}butyl)benzenesulfonamideand3-(3-{[7-({(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-[4-<br>

especially preferred.<br><br>
In the definition of R1 where 'R6and R7 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are<br>
bonded, form a 5-, 6-, or 7- membered nitrogen containing ring', the term "5-, 6-, or 7-<br>
membered nitrogen containing ring" means a 5-, 6-, or 7- membered saturated or unsaturated<br>
ring which includes the sulfonamide nitrogen atom and optionally 1 or 2 other heteroatoms<br>
independently selected from nitrogen, sulphur, and oxygen. Suitable examples of such a ring<br>
include piperidinyl, morpholinyl, and piperazinyl.<br>
In the definition of R1, specifically the optional substituents on R6 and R7, the term "5-, 6-, or<br>
7- membered heterocyclic ring" means a 5-, 6-, or 7- membered fully or partially saturated or<br>
unsaturated ring which includes 1, 2, 3 or 4 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen,<br>
sulphur, and oxygen. Suitable examples of such a ring include pyrrolyl, furyl, thienyl, pyridinyl,<br>
pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, imidazolyl, tetrazolyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, oxazolyl, thiazolyl, thiadiazolyl,<br>
piperidinyl, morpholinyl, and piperazinyl.<br>
In the definition of X, the term "alkenylene" includes both cis and trans structures. Suitable<br>
examples of alkenylene groups include -CH=CH-.<br>
The compounds of formulae (I), (la) and (lb) include an asymmetric centre, namely the carbon<br>
atom of the<br>
-CH-<br>
I<br>
OH<br>
group. The present invention includes both (S) and (R) enantiomers either in substantially pure<br>
form or admixed in any proportions.<br>
Similarly, where R4 and R5 are different groups, the carbon atom to which they are attached is an<br>
asymmetric centre and the present invention includes both (S) and (R) enantiomers at this centre<br>
either in substantially pure form or admixed in any proportions.<br>
Thus the compounds of formulae (I), (la) and (lb) include all enantiomers and diastereoisomers<br>
as well as mixtures thereof in any proportions.<br>
Salts and solvates of compounds of formulae (I), (la) and (lb) which are suitable for use in<br>
medicine are those wherein the counterion or associated solvent is pharmaceutically acceptable.<br>
However, salts and solvates having non-pharmaceutical ly acceptable counterions or associated<br>
solvents are within the scope of the present invention, for example, for use as intermediates in<br>
the preparation of other compounds of formulae (I), (la) and (lb) and their pharmaceutical ly<br>
acceptable salts, solvates, and physiologically functional derivatives.<br>
By the term "physiologically functional derivative" is meant a chemical derivative of a<br>
compound of formula (I), (la) or (lb) having the same physiological function as the parent<br>
compound of formula (I), (la) or (lb), for example, by being convertible in the body thereto.<br><br>
According to the present invention, examples of physiologically functional derivatives include<br>
esters.<br>
Suitable salts according to the invention include those formed with both organic and inorganic<br>
acids or bases. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those formed from<br>
hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, citric, tartaric, phosphoric, lactic, pyruvic, acetic,<br>
trifluoroacetic, triphenylacetic, sulphamic, sulphanilic, succinic, oxalic, fumaric, maleic, malic,<br>
glutamic, aspartic, oxaloacetic, methanesulphonic, ethanesulphonic, arylsulphonic (for example<br>
p-toluenesulphonic, benzenesulphonic, naphthalenesulphonic or naphthalenedisulphonic),<br>
salicylic, glutaric, gluconic, tricarballylic, cinnamic, substituted cinnamic (for example, phenyl,<br>
methyl, methoxy or halo substituted cinnamic, including 4-methyl and 4-methoxycinnamic<br>
acid), ascorbic, oleic, naphthoic, hydroxynaphthoic (for example 1- or 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic),<br>
naphthaleneacrylic (for example naphthaIene-2-acrylic), benzoic, 4-methoxybenzoic, 2- or 4-<br>
hydroxybenzoic, 4-chlorobenzoic, 4-phenylbenzoic, benzeneacrylic (for example 1,4-<br>
benzenediacrylic) and isethionic acids. Pharmaceutically acceptable base salts include<br>
ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as those of sodium and potassium, alkaline earth metal<br>
salts such as those of calcium and magnesium and salts with organic bases such as dicyclohexyl<br>
amine and N-methyl-D-glucamine.<br>
Advantageously, preferred compounds of the invention such as 3-(4-{[6-({(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-[4-<br>
hydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-phenyl]ethyl}amino)hexyl]oxy}butyl)benzenesulfonamide and 3-<br>
(3-{[7-({(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-[4-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethyl)phenyl]ethyI}-<br>
amino)heptyl]oxy}propyl)benzenesulfonamide are provided in the form of a crystalline salt, for<br>
example selected from those exemplified in the experimental section below. Said crystalline<br>
salts have favourable physical properties such as low hygroscopicity and/or improved stability.<br>
Particularly preferred salts include the cinnamate, 4-methoxycinnamate, 4-methylcinnamate,<br>
naphthalenepropenoate and 4-phenylcinnamate salts.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the compounds of formulae (I), (Ia) and (Ib) may have a<br>
hydroxyl group converted to a C1-6alkyl, aryl, aryl C1-6 alkyl, or amino acid ester.<br>
As mentioned above, the compounds of formulae (I), (la) and (lb) are selective p2-<br>
adrenoreceptor agonists as demonstrated using functional or reporter gene readout from cell lines<br>
transfected with human beta-adrenoreceptors as described below. Compounds according to the<br>
present invention also have the potential to combine long duration of effect with rapid onset of<br>
action. Furthermore, certain compounds have shown an improved therapeutic index in animal<br>
models relative to existing long-acting p2-agonist bronchodilators. As such, compounds of the<br>
invention may be suitable for once-daily administration.<br>
Compounds of formulae (I), (la) and (lb) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates,<br>
and physiologically functional derivatives have use in the prophylaxis and treatment of clinical<br>
conditions for which a selective P2-adrenoreceptor agonist is indicated. Such conditions include<br>
diseases associated with reversible airways obstruction such as asthma, chronic obstructive<br><br>
pulmonary diseases (COPD) (e.g. chronic and wheezy bronchitis, emphysema), respiratory tract<br>
infection and upper respiratory tract disease (e.g. rhinitis, including seasonal and allergic<br>
rhinitis).<br>
Other conditions which may be treated include premature labour, depression, congestive heart<br>
failure, skin diseases (e.g. inflammatory, allergic, psoriatic, and proliferative skin diseases),<br>
conditions where lowering peptic acidity is desirable (e.g. peptic and gastric ulceration) and<br>
muscle wasting disease.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the prophylaxis or treatment of a<br>

such a method for the prophylaxis or treatment of a clinical condition selected from premature<br>
labour, depression, congestive heart failure, skin diseases (e.g. inflammatory, allergic, psoriatic,<br>
and proliferative skin diseases), conditions where lowering peptic acidity is desirable (e.g. peptic<br>
and gastric ulceration) or muscle wasting disease.<br>
In the alternative, there is also provided a compound of formula (I), (la) or (lb) or a<br>

The amount of a compound of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt,<br>
solvate or physiologically functional derivative thereof which is required to achieve a therapeutic<br>
effect will, of course, vary with the particular compound, the route of administration, the subject<br>
under treatment, and the particular disorder or disease being treated. The compounds of the<br>
invention may be administered by inhalation at a dose of from 0.0005mg to 10 mg, preferably<br>
0.005mg to 0.5mg. The dose range for adult humans is generally from 0.0005 mg to 100mg per<br>
day and preferably 0.01 mg to 1 mg per day.<br>
While it is possible for the compound of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib), or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, solvate, or physiologically functional derivative thereof to be administered alone,<br>
it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a<br>
compound of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or<br>
physiologically functional derivative thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or<br>

Hereinafter, the term "active ingredient" means a compound of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib), or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or physiologically functional derivative thereof.<br>
The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal,<br>
intramuscular, intravenous and intraarticular), inhalation (including fine particle dusts or mists<br>
which may be generated by means of various types of metered dose pressurised aerosols,<br>
nebulisers or insufflators), rectal and topical (including dermal, buccal, sublingual and<br>
intraocular) administration although the most suitable route may depend upon for example the<br>
condition and disorder of the recipient. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit<br>
dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All<br>
methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which<br>
constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by<br>
uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or<br>
finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired<br>
formulation.<br>
Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as<br>
discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the<br>
active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a<br><br>
non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The<br>
active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory<br>
ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the<br>
active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a<br>
binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets<br>
may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound<br>
moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may<br>
be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection<br>
solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the<br>
formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous<br>
sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The<br>
formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed<br>
ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only<br>
the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example saline or water-for-injection, immediately<br>
prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile<br>
powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.<br>
Dry powder compositions for topical delivery to the lung by inhalation may, for example, be<br>
presented in capsules and cartridges of for example gelatine, or blisters of for example laminated<br>
aluminium foil, for use in an inhaler or insufflator. Formulations generally contain a powder<br>
mix for inhalation of the compound of the invention and a suitable powder base (carrier<br>
substance) such as lactose or starch. Use of lactose is preferred. Each capsule or cartridge may<br>
generally contain between 20μg-10mg of the compound of formula (I) optionally in combination<br>
with another therapeutically active ingredient. Alternatively, the compound of the invention<br>
may be presented without excipients. Packaging of the formulation may be suitable for unit<br>
dose or multi-dose delivery. In the case of multi-dose delivery, the formulation can be pre-<br>
metered (eg as in Diskus, see GB 2242134 or Diskhaler, see GB 2178965,2129691 and<br>
2169265) or metered in use (eg as in Turbuhaler, see EP 69715). An example of a unit-dose<br>
device is Rotahaler (see GB 2064336). The Diskus inhalation device comprises an elongate strip<br>
formed from a base sheet having a plurality of recesses spaced along its length and a lid sheet<br>
hermetically but peelably sealed thereto to define a plurality of containers, each container having<br>
therein an inhalable formulation containing a compound of formula (I) preferably combined with<br>
lactose. Preferably, the strip is sufficiently flexible to be wound into a roll. The lid sheet and<br>
base sheet will preferably have leading end portions which are not sealed to one another and at<br>
least one of the said leading end portions is constructed to be attached to a winding means. Also,<br>
preferably the hermetic seal between the base and lid sheets extends over their whole width. The<br>
lid sheet may preferably be peeled from the base sheet in a longitudinal direction from a first end<br>
of the said base sheet.<br><br>
Spray compositions for topical delivery to the lung by inhalation may for example be formulated<br>
as aqueous solutions or suspensions or as aerosols delivered from pressurised packs, such as a<br>
metered dose inhaler, with the use of a suitable liquefied propellant. Aerosol compositions<br>
suitable for inhalation can be either a suspension or a solution and generally contain the<br>
compound of formula (I) optionally in combination with another therapeutically active ingredient<br>
and a suitable propellant such as a fluorocarbon or hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon or<br>
mixtures thereof, particularly hydrofluoroalkanes, e.g. dichlorodifluorornethane,<br>
trichlorofiuoromethane, dichlorotetra-fluoroethane, especially 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane,<br>
1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane or a mixture thereof. Carbon dioxide or other suitable gas<br>
may also be used as propellant. The aerosol composition may be excipient free or may optionally<br>
contain additional formulation excipients well known in the art such as surfactants eg oleic acid<br>
or lecithin and cosolvents eg ethanol. Pressurised formulations will generally be retained in a<br>
canister (eg an aluminium canister) closed with a valve (eg a metering valve) and fitted into an<br>
actuator provided with a mouthpiece.<br>
Medicaments for administration by inhalation desirably have a controlled particle size. The<br>
optimum particle size for inhalation into the bronchial system is usually 1-10μm, preferably 2-<br>
5μm Particles having a size above 20μm are generally too large when inhaled to reach the small<br>
airways. To achieve these particle sizes the particles of the active ingredient as produced may be<br>
size reduced by conventional means eg by micronisation. The desired fraction may be separated<br>
out by air classification or sieving. Preferably, the particles will be crystalline. When an<br>
excipient such as lactose is employed, generally, the particle size of the excipient will be much<br>
greater than the inhaled medicament within the present invention. When the excipient is lactose<br>
it will typically be present as milled lactose, wherein not more than 85% of lactose particles will<br>
have a MMD of 60-90μm and not less than 15% will have a MMD of less than 15μm.<br>
Intranasal sprays may be formulated with aqueous or non-aqueous vehicles with the addition of<br>
agents such as thickening agents, buffer salts or acid or alkali to adjust the pH, isotonicity<br>
adjusting agents or anti-oxidants.<br>
Solutions for inhalation by nebulation may be formulated with an aqueous vehicle with the<br>
addition of agents such as acid or alkali, buffer salts, isotonicity adjusting agents or<br>
antimicrobials. They may be sterilised by filtration or heating in an autoclave, or presented as a<br>
non-sterile product.<br>
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with the usual carriers<br>
such as cocoa butter or polyethylene glycol.<br>
Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or sublingually,<br>
include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis such as sucrose and acacia<br>
or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and<br>
glycerin or sucrose an acacia.<br><br>
Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing an effective dose, as hereinbefore<br>
recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.<br>
It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the<br>
formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to<br>
the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may<br>
include flavouring agents.<br>
The compounds and pharmaceutical formulations according to the invention may be used in<br>
combination with or include one or more other therapeutic agents, for example selected from<br>
anti-inflammatory agents, anticholinergic agents (particularly an M1, M2, M1/M2 or M3 receptor<br>
antagonist), other β2 adrenoreceptor agonists, antiinfective agents (e.g. antibiotics, antivirals), or<br>
antihistamines. The invention thus provides, in a further aspect, a combination comprising a<br>
compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically<br>
functional derivative thereof together with one or more other therapeutically active agents, for<br>
example selected from an anti-inflammatory agent (for example a corticosteroid or an NSA1D),<br>
an anticholinergic agent, another P2-adrenoreceptor agonist, an antiinfective agent (e.g. an<br>
antibiotic or an antiviral), or an antihistamine. Preferred are combinations comprising a<br>
compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically<br>
functional derivative thereof together with a corticosteroid, and/or an anticholinergic, and/or a<br>
PDE-4 inhibitor. Preferred combinations are those comprising one or two other therapeutic<br>
agents.<br>
It will be clear to a person skilled in the art that, where appropriate, the other therapeutic<br>
ingredients) may be used in the form of salts, (e.g. as alkali metal or amine salts or as acid<br>
addition salts), or prodrugs, or as esters (e.g. lower alkyl esters), or as solvates (e.g. hydrates) to<br>
optimise the activity and/or stability and/or physical characteristics (e.g. solubility) of the<br>
therapeutic ingredient. It will be clear also that where appropriate, the therapeutic ingredients<br>
may be used in optically pure form.<br>
Suitable anti-inflammatory agents include corticosteroids and NSAIDs. Suitable corticosteroids<br>
which may be used in combination with the compounds of the invention are those oral and<br>
inhaled corticosteroids and their pro-drugs which have anti-inflammatory activity. Examples<br>
include methyl prednisolone, prednisolone, dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, 6α,9α-<br>
difluoro-17α-[(2-furany lcarbonyl)oxy]-11 (3-hydroxy-16a-methy 1-3-oxo-androsta-1,4-diene-17(3-<br>
carbothioic acid S-fluoromethyl ester, 6α,9α-difluoro-11β-hydroxy-16α-methyl-3-oxo-17α-<br>
propionyloxy- androsta-1,4-diene-17β-carbothioic acid S-(2-oxo-tetrahydro-furan-3S-yl) ester,<br>
beclomethasone esters (e.g. the 17-propionate ester or the 17,21-dipropionate ester), budesonide,<br>
flunisolide, mometasone esters (e.g. the furoate ester), triamcinolone acetonide, rofleponide,<br>
ciclesonide, butixocort propionate, RPR-106541, and ST-126. Preferred corticosteroids include<br>
fluticasone propionate, 6α,9α-difluoro-l lβ-hydroxy-I6a-methyl-I7α-[(4-methyl-l,3-thiazole-5-<br>
carbonyl)oxy]-3-oxo-androsta-l,4-diene-17β-carbothioic acid S-fluoromethyl ester and 6α,9α-<br>
difluoro-17α-[(2-furanylcarbonyl)oxy]-11β-hydroxy-16α-methyl-3-oxo-androsta-1,4-diene-17β-<br><br>
carbothioic acid S-fluoromethyl ester, more preferably 6a,9a-difluoro-17α[(2-<br>
furanylcarbonyl)oxy]-11 β-hydroxy-16α-methyl-3-oxo-androsta-1,4-diene-17β-carbothioic acid<br>
S-fluoromethyl ester.<br>
Suitable NSAIDs include sodium cromoglycate, nedocromil sodium, phosphodiesterase (PDE)<br>
inhibitors (e.g. theophylline, PDE4 inhibitors or mixed PDE3/PDE4 inhibitors), leukotriene<br>
antagonists, inhibitors of leukotriene synthesis, iNOS inhibitors, tryptase and elastase inhibitors,<br>
beta-2 integrin antagonists and adenosine receptor agonists or antagonists (e.g. adenosine 2a<br>
agonists), cytokine antagonists (e.g. chemokine antagonists) or inhibitors of cytokine synthesis.<br>
Suitable other β2-adrenoreceptor agonists include salmeterol (e.g. as the xinafoate), salbutamol<br>
(e.g. as the sulphate or the free base), formoterol (e.g. as the fumarate), fenoterol or terbutaline<br>
and salts thereof.<br>
Of particular interest is use of the compound of formula (I) in combination with a<br>
phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor or a mixed PDE3/PDE4 inhibitor. The PDE4-specific<br>
inhibitor useful in this aspect of the invention may be any compound that is known to inhibit the<br>
PDE4 enzyme or which is discovered to act as a PDE4 inhibitor, and which are only PDE4<br>
inhibitors, not compounds which inhibit other members of the PDE family as well as PDE4.<br>
Generally it is preferred to use a PDE4 inhibitor which has an IC50 ratio of about 0.1 or greater<br>
as regards the IC50 for the PDE4 catalytic form which binds rolipram with a high affinity<br>
divided by the IC50 for the form which binds rolipram with a low affinity. For the purposes of<br>
this disclosure, the cAMP catalytic site which binds R and S rolipram with a low affinity is<br>
denominated the "low affinity" binding site (LPDE 4) and the other form of this catalytic site<br>
which binds rolipram with a high affinity is denominated the "high affinity" binding site (HPDE<br>
4). This term "HPDE4" should not be confused with the term "hPDE4" which is used to denote<br>
human PDE4.<br>
Initial experiments may be conducted to establish and validate a [3H]-rolipram binding assay.<br>
Details of this work are given in the Binding Assays described in detail below.<br>
Phosphodiesterase and Rolipram Binding Assays<br>
Assay method 1A<br>
Isolated human monocyte PDE4 and hrPDE (human recombinant PDE4) was determined to exist<br>
primarily in the low affinity form. Hence, the activity of test compounds against the low affinity<br>
form of PDE4 can be assessed using standard assays for PDE4 catalytic activity employing 1 μM<br>
[3H]cAMP as a substrate (Torphy etal., J. of Biol. Chem., Vol. 267, No. 3 ppl 798-1804, 1992).<br>
Rat brain high speed supernatants were used as a source of protein and both enantiomers of [3H]-<br>
rolipram were prepared to a specific activity of 25.6 Ci/mmol. Standard assay conditions were<br>
modified from the published procedure to be identical to the PDE assay conditions, except for<br>
the last of the cAMP: 50mM Tris HC1 (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 50 μM 5'-AMP and 1 nM of<br>
[3H]-rolipram (Torphy et al., J. of Biol. Chem., Vol. 267, No. 3 ppl798-1804, 1992). The assay<br>
was run for 1 hour at 30° C. The reaction was terminated and bound ligand was separated from<br>
free ligand using a Brandel cell harvester. Competition for the high affinity binding site was<br><br>
assessed under conditions that were identical to those used for measuring low affinity PDE<br>
activity, expect that [3H]-cAMP was not present.<br>
Assay method 1B<br>
Measurement of Phosphodiesterase Activity<br>
PDE activity was assayed using a [3H]cAMP SPA or [3H]cGMP SPA enzyme assay as<br>
described by the supplier (Amersham Life Sciences). The reactions were conducted in 96-well<br>
plates at room temperature, in 0.1 ml of reaction buffer containing (final concentrations): 50<br>
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8.3 mM MgCl2, 1.7 mM EGTA, [3H]cAMP or [3H] CGMP<br>
(approximately 2000 dpm/pmol), enzyme and various concentrations of the inhibitors. The assay<br>
was allowed to proceed for 1 hr and was terminated by adding 50 \i\ of SPA yttrium silicate<br>
beads in the presence of zinc sulfate. The plates were shaken and allowed to stand at room<br>
temperature for 20 min. Radiolabeled product formation was assessed by scintillation<br>
spectrometry.<br>
[3H]R-rolipram binding assay<br>
The [3H]R-rolipram binding assay was performed by modification of the method of Schneider<br>
and co-workers, see Nicholson, etal., Trends Pharmacol. Sci., VoU 12, pp. 19-27 (1991) and<br>
McHale etal., Mol. Pharmacol., Vol. 39, 109-113 (1991). R-Rolipram binds to the catalytic site<br>
of PDE4 see Torphy etal., Mol. Pharmacol., Vol. 39, pp. 376-384 (1991). Consequently,<br>
competition for [3H]R-rolipram binding provides an independent confirmation of the PDE4<br>
inhibitor potencies of unlabeled competitors. The assay was performed at 30°C for 1 hr in 0.5 μl<br>
buffer containing (final concentrations): 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% bovine<br>
serum albumin, 2 nM [3H]R-rolipram (5.7 x 104 dpm/pmol) and various concentrations of non-<br>
radiolabeled inhibitors. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2.5 ml of ice-cold reaction<br>
buffer (without [3H]-R-rolipram) and rapid vacuum filtration (Brandel Cell Harvester) through<br>
Whatman GF/B filters that had been soaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine. The filters were washed<br>
with an additional 7.5 ml of cold buffer, dried, and counted via liquid scintillation spectrometry.<br>
The preferred PDE4 inhibitors of use in this invention will be those compounds which have a<br>
salutary therapeutic ratio, i.e., compounds which preferentially inhibit cAMP catalytic activity<br>
where the enzyme is in the form that binds rolipram with a low affinity, thereby reducing the side<br>
effects which apparently are linked to inhibiting the form which binds rolipram with a high<br>
affinity. Another way to state this is that the preferred compounds will have an IC50 ratio of<br>
about 0.1 or greater as regards the IC50 for the PDE4 catalytic form which binds rolipram with a<br>
high affinity divided by the IC50 for the form which binds rolipram with a low affinity.<br>
A further refinement of this standard is that of one wherein the PDE4 inhibitor has an IC50 ratio<br>
of about 0.1 or greater; said ratio is the ratio of the IC50 value for competing with the binding of<br>
InM of [3H]R-rolipram to a form of PDE4 which binds rolipram with a high affinity over the<br>
IC50 value for inhibiting the PDE4 catalytic activity of a form which binds rolipram with a low<br>
affinity using 1 μM[3H]-cAMP as the substrate.<br>
Examples of useful PDE4 inhibitors are:<br><br>
(R)-(+)-1 -(4-bromobenzyl)-4-[(3 -cyclopentyloxy)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2-pyrrolidone;<br>
(R)-(+)-l-(4-bromobenzyl)-4-[(3-cyclopentyloxy)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2-pyrrolidone;<br>

cis-[4-cyano-4-(3-cyclopropylmethoxy-4-difluoromethoxyphenyl)cyclohexan-l-ol];<br>
(R)-(+)-ethyl [4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)pyrrolidine-2-ylidene]acetate;and<br>
(S)-(-)-ethyl [4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)pyrrolidine-2-ylidene]acetate.<br>
Most preferred are those PDE4 inhibitors which have an IC50 ratio of greater than 0.5, and<br>
particularly those compounds having a ratio of greater than 1.0. Preferred compounds are cis 4-<br>
cyano-4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexan-l-carboxy!icacid, 2-carbomethoxy-4-<br>
cyano-4-(3 -cyclopropylmethoxy-4-difluoromethoxyphenyl)cyclohexan-1 -one and c«-[4-cyano-<br>
4-(3-cyclopropylmethoxy-4-difluoromethoxyphenyl)cyclohexan-l-ol]; these are examples of<br>
compounds which bind preferentially to the low affinity binding site and which have an IC50<br>
ratio of 0.1 or greater.<br>

Suitable antihistamines (also referred to as Hi-receptor antagonists) include any one or more of<br>
the numerous antagonists known which inhibit Hi-receptors, and are safe for human use. All are<br>
reversible, competitive inhibitors of the interaction of histamine with H|-receptors. The majority<br>
of these inhibitors, mostly first generation antagonists, have a core structure, which can be<br>
represented by the following formula:<br><br>
This generalized structure represents three types of antihistamines generally available:<br>
ethanolamines, ethylenediamines, and alkylamines. In addition, other first generation<br>
antihistamines include those which can be characterized as based on piperizine and<br>
phenothiazines. Second generation antagonists, which are non-sedating, have a similar<br>
structure-activity relationship in that they retain the core ethylene group (the alkylamines) or<br>
mimic the tertiary amine group with piperizine or piperidine. Exemplary antagonists are as<br>
follows:<br><br>
Ethanolamines: carbinoxamine maleate, clemastine fumarate, diphenylhydramine<br>
hydrochloride, and dimenhydrinate.<br>
Ethylenediamines: pyrilamine amleate, tripelennamine HCl, and tripelennamine citrate.<br>
Alkylamines: chlropheniramine and its salts such as the maleate salt, and acrivastine.<br>
Piperazines: hydroxyzine HC1, hydroxyzine pamoate, cyclizine HC1, cyclizine lactate,<br>
meclizine HCI, and cetirizine HC1.<br>
Piperidines: Astemizole, levocabastine HCI, loratadine or its descarboethoxy analogue, and<br>
terfenadine and fexofenadine hydrochloride or another pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
Azelastine hydrochloride is yet another H1 receptor antagonist which may be used in<br>
combination with a PDE4 inhibitor.<br>
Examples of preferred anti-histamines include methapyrilene and loratadine.<br>

formula (I) a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically functional derivative<br>
thereof together with a PDE4 inhibitor.<br>

The invention thus provides, in a further aspect, a combination comprising a compound of<br>
formula (I) a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically functional derivative<br>

The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for use in the form of a<br>
, pharmaceutical formulation and thus pharmaceutical formulations comprising a combination as<br>
defined above together with a physiologically acceptable diluent or carrier represent a further<br>
aspect of the invention.<br><br>
The individual compounds of such combinations may be administered either sequentially or<br>
simultaneously in separate or combined pharmaceutical formulations. Appropriate doses of<br>
known therapeutic agents will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for preparing a<br>
compound of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib) or a salt, solvate, or physiologically functional derivative<br>
thereof which comprises a process (a) (b) (c) or (d) as defined below followed by the following<br>
steps in any order:<br>
(i) optional removal of any protecting groups;<br>
(ii) optional separation of an enantiomer from a mixture of enantiomers;<br>
(iii) optional conversion of the product to a corresponding salt, solvate,<br>
or physiologically functional derivative thereof.<br>
In one general process (a), a compound of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib) may be obtained by<br>
deprotection of a protected intermediate, for example of formula (II):<br><br>
or a salt or solvate thereof, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, m, and n are as defined for the compound<br>
of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib), R8, R9, and R10 are each independently either hydrogen or a<br>
protecting group provided that at least one of R8, R9, and R10 is a protecting group, and R14 is<br>
either hydrogen or a protecting group.<br>
Suitable protecting groups may be any conventional protecting group such as those described in<br>
"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by Theodora W Greene and Peter G M Wuts, 3rd<br>
edition (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999). Examples of suitable hydroxyl protecting groups<br>
represented by R8 and R9 are esters such as acetate ester, aralkyl groups such as benzyl,<br>
diphenylmethyl, or triphenylmethyl, and tetrahydropyranyl. Examples of suitable amino<br>
protecting groups represented by R10 include benzyl, a-methylbenzyl, diphenylmethyl,<br>
triphenylmethyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, and acyl groups such as<br>
trichloroacetyl or trifluoroacetyl.<br>
As will be appreciated by the person skilled in the art, use of such protecting groups may include<br>
orthogonal protection of groups in the compounds of formula (II) to facilitate the selective<br>
removal of one group in the presence of another, thus enabling selective functionalisation of a<br>
single amino or hydroxyl function. For example, the -CH(OH) group may be orthogonally<br>
protected as -CHOR14 using, for example, a trialkylsilyl group such as triethylsilyl. A person<br><br>
skilled in the art will also appreciate other orthogonal protection strategies, available by<br>
conventional means as described in Theodora W Greene (see above).<br>
The deprotection to yield a compound of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib) may be effected using<br>
conventional techniques. Thus, for example, when R8, R9, and/or R10 is an aralkyl group, this<br>
may be cleaved by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a metal catalyst (e.g. palladium on<br>
charcoal).<br>
When R8 and/or R9 is tetrahydropyranyl this may be cleaved by hydrolysis under acidic<br>
conditions. Acyl groups represented by R10 may be removed by hydrolysis, for example with a<br>
base such as sodium hydroxide, or a group such as trichloroethoxycarbonyl may be removed by<br>
reduction with, for example, zinc and acetic acid. Other deprotection methods may be found in<br>
Theodora W Greene (see above). In a particular embodiment of process (a), R8 and R9 may<br>
together represent a protecting group as in the compound of formula (III).<br><br>
or a salt or solvate thereof, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, RM, m, and n are as defined for the<br>
compound of formula (I) , (Ia) or (Ib), R" and R12 are independently selected from hydrogen, C1-<br>
6alkyl, or aryl. In a preferred aspect, both R11 and R12 are methyl.<br>
A compound of formula (III) may be converted to a compound of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib) by<br>
hydrolysis with dilute aqueous acid, for example acetic acid or hydrochloric acid in a suitable<br>
solvent or by transketalisation in an alcohol, for example ethanol, in the presence of a catalyst<br>
such as an acid (for example, toluenesulphonic acid) or a salt (such as pyridinium tosylate) at<br>
normal or elevated temperature.<br>
It will be appreciated that the protecting groups R8, R9, R10 and R14 (including the cyclised<br>
protecting group formed by R8 and R9 as depicted in formula (III) may be removed in a single,<br>
step or sequentially. The precise order in which protecting groups are removed will in part<br>
depend upon the nature of said groups and will be readily apparent to the skilled worker.<br>
Preferably, when R8 and R9 together form a protecting group as in formula (III) this protecting<br>
group is removed together with any protecting group on the CH(OH) moiety, followed by<br>
removal of R10.<br>
Compounds of formulae (II) and (III) wherein R10 is hydrogen may be prepared from the<br>
corresponding compound of formula (IV):<br><br><br>
or a salt or solvate thereof, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R8, R9 m, and n are as defined for the<br>
compound of formula (II) or (III).<br>
The conversion of a compound of formula (IV) to a compound of formula (II) or (HI) may be<br>
effected by treatment with a base, for example a non-aqueous base, such as potassium<br>
trimethylsilanoate, or an aqueous base such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, in a suitable solvent<br>
such as tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Compounds of formula (IV) may be prepared from the corresponding compound of formula (V):<br><br>
or a salt or solvate thereof, wherein R4, R5, R8, R9, m and n are as defined for the compound of<br>
formula (IV);<br>
by coupling with a compound of formula (VI):<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, and R3 are as defined for the compound of formula (IV) and L is a leaving group,<br>
such as a halo group (typically, bromo or iodo) or a sulphonate ester such as a haloalkyl<br>
sulphonate (typically, trifluoromethanesulphonate), followed by reduction.<br>
The coupling of compound of formula (V) with a compound of formula (VI) is conveniently<br>
effected in the presence of a catalyst system such as bis (triphenylphosphine) palladium<br>
dichloride with an organic base such as a trialkylamine, for example, triethylamine, in a suitable<br>
solvent, for example acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. The resulting alkyne may then be<br><br>
reduced, either with or without being isolated to form the compound of formula (IV). The<br>
reduction may be effected by any suitable method such as hydrogenation in the presence of a<br>
catalyst, for example, palladium/charcoal or platinum oxide.<br>
Alternatively, in the compounds of formula (VI) R1, R2, and R3 may represent groups convertible<br>
into R1, R2, and R3, for example halo groups. This is particularly useful where one of the groups<br>
R1, R2, and R3 may be affected by any of the subsequent transformations. Thus, for example,<br>
where R1 contains an alkenylene moiety, this is preferably introduced after the reduction of the<br>
alkyne formed by reaction of compounds (V) and (VI).<br>
Compounds of formula (VI) are commercially available or may be prepared by methods well<br>
known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds of formula (V) may be prepared by coupling a compound of formula (VII):<br><br>
or a salt or solvate thereof, wherein R8 and R9 are as defined for the compound of formula (V)<br>
with a compound of formula (VIII):<br><br>
wherein R4, R5, m and n are as defined for the compound of formula (V) and L1 is a leaving<br>
group, for example a halo group (typically bromo or iodo) or a sulphonate such as an alkyl<br>
sulphonate (typically, methanesulphonate), an arylsulphonate (typically, toluenesulphonate), or a<br>
haloalkyl sulphonate (typically, trifluoromethanesulphonate).<br>
The coupling of a compound of formula (VII) with a compound of formula (VIII) may be<br>
effected in the presence of a base, such as a metal hydride, for example sodium hydride, or an<br>
inorganic base such as cesium carbonate, in an aprotic solvent, for example dimethylformamide.<br>
Compounds of formula (VIII) may be prepared from the corresponding dihaloalkane and<br>
hydroxyalkyne by conventional chemistry, typically in the presence of an inorganic base, such as<br>
aqueous sodium hydroxide, under phase transfer conditions in the presence of a salt such as<br>
tetraalkylammonium bromide.<br>
Compounds of formula (VII) may be prepared by ring closure of a compound of formula (IX):<br><br><br>
wherein R8 and R9 are as defined for the compound of formula (VII) and R13 is C1-6alkyl, for<br>
example tert-butyl, or aryl, for example phenyl. The ring closure may be effected by treatment<br>
with a base, such as a metal hydride, for example sodium hydride, in the presence of an aprotic<br>
solvent, for example, dimethylformamide.<br>
Compounds of formula (IX) may be prepared from the corresponding ketone of formula (X):<br><br>
wherein R8 and R9 and R13 are as defined for the compound of formula (IX), by reduction by any<br>
suitable method, for example by treatment with borane, in the presence of a chiral catalyst, such<br>
as CBS-oxazaborolidine, in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The compound of formula (X) may be prepared from the corresponding halide of formula (XI)<br><br>
wherein R8 and R9are as defined for the compound of formula (X) and Y is halo, suitably bromo.<br>
The conversion of a compound of formula (XI) to a compound of formula (X) may be effected<br>
by reaction with the protected amine HN(COOR,3)2 wherein R13 is as defined for the compound<br>
of formula (X) in the presence of an inorganic base such as cesium carbonate, followed by<br>
selective removal of one of the COOR13 groups, for example by treatment with an acid such as<br>
trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
Compounds of formula (XI) may be prepared from the corresponding compound having free<br>
hydroxymethyl and hydroxy substituents (which itself may be prepared from 2-bromo-1 -(4-<br><br>
hydroxy)-3-hydroxymethyl-phenethyl)ethanone, the preparation of which is described in<br>
GB2140800, by treatment with 2-methoxypropane in acetone in the presence of an acid e.g. p-<br>
toluene-sulphonic acid in a nitrogen atmosphere or by other standard methods) by forming the<br>
protected groups R8OCH2- and R90- wherein R8 and R9 are as defined for the compound of<br>
formula (XI). Such methods are described in DE 3513885 (Glaxo).<br>
Compounds of formula (II) or (III) wherein R10 is a protecting group may be prepared as<br>
described in process (b) below, or by analogous methods to process (c) below.<br>
In a further process (b), a compound of formula (I) , (Ia) or (Ib) may be obtained by alkylation of<br>
an amine of formula (XII):<br><br>
wherein R8, R9, R10 and R14 are each independently either hydrogen or a protecting group.<br>
Suitable protecting groups are discussed in the definition of compounds of formula (II);<br>
with a compound of formula (XIII):<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, m, and n are as defined for the compound of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib)<br>
and L2 is a leaving group such as halo (typically bromo); followed by removal of any protecting<br>
groups present by conventional methods as described above for the deprotectiort of compounds<br>
of formula (II).<br>
The reaction of compounds of formulae (XII) and (XIII) is optionally effected in the presence of<br>
an organic base such as a trialkylamine, for example, diisopropylethylamine, and in a suitable<br>
solvent for example dimethyl formamide.<br>
Compounds of formula (XII) are known in the art (for example EP-A 0947498) or may be<br>
readily prepared by a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
Compounds of formula (XIII) may be prepared by coupling a compound of formula (VI) as<br>
defined above, or a precursor thereof (wherein one or more of the substituents R1, R2 or R3 is a<br>
group which is convertible to the desired group R1, R2, or R3) with a compound of formula (VIII)<br>
as shown above wherein R4, R5, m, and n are as defined for the compound of formula (XIII) and<br>
L1 is a leaving group as defined above.<br>
The coupling of a compound of formula (VIII) with a compound (VI) may be effected by<br>
methods analogous to those described above for coupling a compound of formula (V) with a<br>
compound of formula (VI), followed by reduction of the resulting alkyne of formula (XIV):<br><br>
also as described above. If necessary, the substituents R1, R2, and/or R3 may be formed by<br>
conventional conversions where a precursor is present.<br>
An alkyne of formula (XIV) may also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (XV):<br><br>
with a compound of formula (XVI):<br><br>
using conventional methods, for example as described for the preparation of compounds (VIII).<br>
Compounds of formula (XVI ) may be prepared by reacting a hydroxyalkyne<br><br>
with a compound of formula (VI) using methods analogous to those described above for<br>
coupling a compound (V) with a compound (VI).<br><br>
In a further process (c) a compound of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib) may be prepared by reacting a<br>
compound of formula (XVII):<br><br>
wherein R8, R9 and R14 are as hereinbefore defined and L4 is a leaving group, is reacted with an<br>
amine of formula (XVIII):<br><br>
followed by removal of any protecting groups present by conventional methods as described<br>
above for the deprotection of compounds of formula (II).<br>
The reaction may be effected using conventional conditions for such displacement reactions.<br>
Compounds of formula (XVII) may be prepared by methods known in the art.<br>
Compounds of formula (XVIII) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (XIII) with<br>
an amine R10NH2.<br>
In a further process (d) a compound of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib) may be prepared by removal of a<br>
chiral auxiliary from a compound of formula (Ha):<br><br>
wherein R1 - R5, R8, R9, m and n are as hereinbefore defined and R15 represents a chiral<br>
auxiliary.<br><br>
A "chiral auxiliary" is a rnoiety that is introduced into a molecule to influence the<br>
stereochemistry of the product formed, and is removed in whole or part at a later time. A chiral<br>
auxiliary may simultaneously function as a protecting group.<br>
Many chiral auxiliaries are commercially available, and persons skilled in the art would choose<br>
one based on the properties desired i.e. the absolute stereochemistry desired and compatibility<br>
with the processes being used. Chiral auxiliaries suitable for use in this process include but are<br>
not limited to the S-isomer and/or the R-isomer of phenyl glycinol and substituted derivatives<br>
thereof.<br>
The chiral auxiliary is preferably a moiety of the formula:<br><br>
or a single enantiomer thereof, wherein R16 represents C1-6alkyl or optionally substituted phenyl<br>
or benzyl wherein the optional substitution is one or more independently selected from C1-6alkyl,<br>
halogen, hydroxy, C1-6alkoxy or nitro e.g. para-hydroxyphenyl.<br>
More preferably the chiral auxiliary is a moiety:<br><br>
wherein R16 is as defined above. Alternatively it may be a moiety of formula:<br><br>
wherein R16 is as defined above.<br>
Preferably R16 represents phenyl optionally substituted as described above, Most preferably R<br>
represents unsubstituted phenyl.<br>
The chiral auxiliary in this process may typically be removed by hydrogenolysis using for<br>
example a palladium on carbon catalyst or preferably using palladium hydroxide (Pearlman's<br>
catalyst). Advantageously when Pearlman's catalyst is used the removal of the chiral auxiliary is<br>
most efficient. This method of removal is especially suitable where R1 is phenyl or a substituted<br>
phenyl. Alternatively the nitrogen, to which the auxiliary is attached, may be derivatised under<br>
oxidising conditions to form the N-oxide before elimination by heating to give a secondary<br>
amine.<br><br>
A compound of formula (Ha) may be prepared by reduction of the corresponding alkyne of<br>
formula (XIX):<br><br>
Preferably in the compounds of formulae (Ha) and (XIX) the protecting groups R* and R9<br>
together form a group -CR11R12- as in the compounds of formula (III).<br>
Reduction of an alkyne of formula (XIX) may be effected by methods well known in the art, for<br>
example by catalytic hydrogenation, using palladium on charcoal or more preferably palladium<br>
hydroxide (Pearlman's catalyst). The chiral auxiliary may also be removed under reductive<br>
conditions. Advantageously, therefore the reduction of the alkyne and removal of the chiral<br>
auxiliary may be effected concomitantly in a 'one-pot' reaction.<br>
An alkyne of formula (XIX) may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula (XX)<br><br>
with a compound of formula (VI) under conditions described above for coupling of compounds<br>
(V) and (VI).<br>
A compound of formula (XX) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (XHa):<br><br>
with an aldehyde of formula (XXI):<br><br><br>
using known methods for effecting reductive amination, e.g. sodium triacetoxyborohydride in a<br>
solvent such as chloroform<br>
An aldehyde of formula (XXI) may be prepared from a corresponding halide of formula (VIII)<br>
using standard techniques such as treatment with sodium bicarbonate in a solvent such as DMSO<br>
at elevated temperature, preferably in the range 130-160ºC.<br>
A compound of formula (XIIa) may be prepared from a compound of formula (XXII):<br><br>
Wherein R8, R9 and R15 are as hereinbefore defined by treatment with a reducing agent such as a<br>
hydride source e.g. sodium borohydride. Preferably this process takes place in the presence of an<br>
inert metal salt such as calcium chloride suitably at non-extreme temperatures e.g. below<br>
ambient, such as 0°C. This allows the desired stereochemistry to be introduced efficiently with<br>
good enantiomeric excess at an early stage in the synthesis, using inexpensive and relatively<br>
harmless reagents. Furthermore, the enantiomeric excess may be increased by recrystallisation<br>
of the product of this process.<br>
A compound of formula (XXII) may be prepared from a compound of formula (XI) as<br>
hereinbefore defined by reaction with an appropriate chiral amine, e.g. (S)-phenylglycinol, in the<br>
presence of a non-nucleophilic base in an inert solvent at non-extreme temperatures.<br>
A detailed description of a process analogous to Route (d) may be found in published<br>
International Application Number WO/0196278.<br>
In the above process (d) it is preferred that the protecting groups Rs and R9 together form a<br>
protecting group as depicted in formula (III).<br>
It will be appreciated that in any of the routes (a) to (d) described above, the precise order of the<br>
synthetic steps by which the various groups and moieties are introduced into the molecule may<br>
be varied. It will be within the skill of the practitioner in the art to ensure that groups or moieties<br>
introduced at one stage of the process will not be affected by subsequent transformations and<br>
reactions, and to select the order of synthetic steps accordingly.<br><br>
The enantiomeric compounds of the invention may be obtained (i) by separation of the<br>
components of the corresponding racemic mixture, for example, by means of a chiral<br>
chromatography column, enzymic resolution methods, or preparing and separating suitable<br>
diastereoisomers, or (ii) by direct synthesis from the appropriate chiral intermediates by the<br>
methods described above.<br>
Optional conversions of a compound of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib) to a corresponding salt may<br>
conveniently be effected by reaction with the appropriate acid or base. Optional conversion of a<br>
compound of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib) to a corresponding solvate or physiologically functional<br>
derivative may be effected by methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
According to a further aspect, the present invention provides novel intermediates for the<br>
preparation of compounds of formula (I), (Ia) or (Ib), for example:<br>
compounds of formula (II) and (III) as defined above, or an optical isomer, a salt, or a protected<br>
derivative thereof; particularly, a compound selected from:<br>

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
The potencies of the aforementioned compounds were determined using frog melanophores<br>
transfected with the human beta 2 adrenoreceptor. The cells were incubated with melatonin to<br>
induce pigment aggregation. Pigment dispersal was induced by compounds acting on the human<br>
beta 2 adrenoreceptor. The beta 2 agonist activity of test compounds was assessed by their ability<br>
to induce a change in light transmittance across a melanophore monolayer (a consequence of<br>
pigment dispersal). At the human beta 2 adrenoreceptor, compounds of examples 1- 49 had IC50<br>
values below 1 μM.<br>
Potency at other beta adrenoreceptor subtypes was determined using Chinese hamster ovary cells<br>
transfected with either the human beta 1 adrenoreceptor or the human beta 3 adrenoreceptor.<br>
Agonist activity was assessed by measuring changes in intracellular cyclic AMP.<br>
