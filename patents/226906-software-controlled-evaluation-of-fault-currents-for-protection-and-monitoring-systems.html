				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a fault current detection system. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to a fault current detection system that is<br>
implemented via software and relates to a method employed by the detection system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In many applications, electrical currents are supplied to one or more electric<br>
devices to provide power for the devices. For example, electrical currents are<br>
supplied from a power company to one or more electrical outlets in a residential<br>
home, and a user can connect an electric device to an outlet to supply power to the<br>
device. If the electric device malfunctions or is mishandled by the user, a potentially<br>
dangerous situation may arise. For example, if the user contacts a portion of the<br>
electric device that receives electrical currents from the power company, the electrical<br>
current will pass through the user to the ground and may cause the user's heart to<br>
suffer from a cardiac arrest. Also, if the portion of the electric device that receives<br>
electrical currents is improperly grounded due to faulty insulation, a current will be<br>
supplied to the electric device and may start a fire in the user's home. The additional<br>
surge of current that is supplied to the user's home when the electric device<br>
malfunctions or is mishandled is known as a fault current.<br>
In order to prevent fire in the user's home or to prevent the user from being<br>
harmed, a circuit breaker has been developed that detects fault currents and that<br>
blocks the supply of electrical current to the one or more electrical outlets in the<br>
user's home if the detected fault currents exceed certain levels. Fig. 7 shows an<br><br>
example of such a circuit breaker 1 that comprises a sum-current transformer 2, a<br>
power supply 4, a triggering circuit 5, a triggering relay 6, a switching mechanism 7,<br>
and a switch 8.<br>
The electric currents are supplied from the power company to the user's home<br>
via a conductor network LN, and the network LN includes three active conductors L1,<br>
L2, and L3 and a neutral or ground conductor N. The conductor network LN is<br>
wrapped around a core 3 of the sum-current transformer 2 to form a primary winding<br>
N1 of the transformer 2. Also, a secondary winding N2 is wrapped around the core 3<br>
of the transformer 2, and the triggering circuit 5 is connected to the winding N2.<br>
Specifically, the triggering circuit 5 is connected across the output terminals of the<br>
winding N2, and the triggering relay 6 is connected across the output terminals of the<br>
circuit 5. The triggering relay 6 controls the switching mechanism 7 to selectively<br>
open and close the switch 8, and. the switch 8 is provided in the path of the conductor<br>
network LN between the power company and the electrical device.<br>
When the electrical device in the user's home is operating or being handled<br>
under normal conditions, no fault currents exist. As a result, the vector sum of the<br>
currents flowing through the core 3 via the conductor network LN is zero. However,<br>
if a fault current If is generated, the vector sum of the currents is not zero, and a<br>
voltage Ue is generated across the secondary winding N2. The characteristics of the<br>
voltage Ue correspond to the characteristics of the fault current If, and the triggering<br>
circuit 5 generates an output voltage Ua based on the input voltage Ue. The output<br>
voltage Ua causes a current Ia to flow through the triggering relay 6, and the relay 6<br>
triggers. The triggering of the relay 6 causes the switching mechanism 7 to open the<br>
switch 8 and block the supply of current from the power company to at least one<br>
outlet in the user's home. Accordingly, when the user contacts a conductive portion of<br><br>
an electric device connected to an outlet and causes a fault current If to be generated,<br>
the relay 6 triggers, and the switching mechanism 7 opens the switch 8. As a result,<br>
the dangerous fault current If is no longer supplied to the user's home and will not<br>
harm the user.<br>
The value of a triggering fault current I∆trigger of the circuit breaker 1 (i.e. the<br>
value of a fault current If that will trigger the relay 6) is determined based on the rated<br>
residual current (or nominal fault current) I∆n. The nominal fault current I∆n<br>
corresponds to the sensitivity of the circuit breaker 1 and is selected based on the<br>
electrical standards of the electrical system in which the circuit breaker 1 is<br>
incorporated. An example of how the triggering current I∆trigger is selected will be<br>
described below in conjunction with the graph illustrated in Fig. 8.<br>
The graph shows an example of a fibrillation limit curve G1 and a fire<br>
prevenrion Limit curve G2. The fibrillation limit curve G1 represents the maximum<br>
value of the fault current If that will not cause a user's heart to fibrillate if the user<br>
contacts the current If, and the values in the curve G1 are dependent upon the<br>
frequency of the fault current If. For example, if the fault current If has a frequency of<br>
100 Hz and is less than or equal to about 30 mA, the user will not suffer ventricular<br>
fibrillation, but if the fault current If is greater than approximately 30 mA, the user<br>
will experience fibrillation. On the other hand if the fault current If has a frequency<br>
of 1 kHz, the user's heart will not fibrillate if the current If is less than or equal to<br>
approximately 420 mA but will fibrillate if the current If is greater than such value.<br>
While the maximum current values in the fibrillation limit curve Gl are<br>
dependent on the frequency of the fault current If, the maximum current values<br>
represented by the fire prevention limit curve G2 are not frequency dependent. In<br>
particular, if the value of the fault current If (at any frequency) is less than or equal to<br><br>
approximately 420 mA, a fire will not occur in the user's electric device or home, but<br>
if the value is greater than 420 mA, a fire will likely occur. In the present example,<br>
the current value of 420 mA is selected for a power system with a voltage of 230V<br>
(with respect to ground) in order to prevent a power dissipation that is greater than<br>
100 Watts at the location of the fault.<br>
As indicated above, the specific values and characteristics of the limit curves<br>
G1 and G2 are governed by the electrical standards of a particular electrical system.<br>
For example, the limit curve G1 is determined according to the international standard<br>
IEC 479. If the circuit breaker 1 were operating according to different standards, the<br>
specific values of the curves G1 and G2 would be different.<br>
The triggering fault current I∆trigger, which causes the circuit breaker 1 to trip,<br>
should be selected based on both the fibrillation limit curve G1 and fire prevention<br>
limit curve G2 on the graph shown in Fig. 8. Specifically, the triggering fault current<br>
I∆trigger, should be selected such that, when a fault current If occurs, the circuit breaker<br>
1 will trigger before the fault current If rises to a level that can cause injury to the user<br>
of an electric device or to a level that can cause a fire. Therefore, if the circuit breaker<br>
1 is operating in an environment in which fault currents having low frequencies may<br>
be generated, the triggering fault current I∆trigger may be set to a value that is below the<br>
fibrillation limit curve G1 at low frequencies. In the example shown in Fig. 8, the<br>
triggering fault current I∆trigger would be less than approximately 30 mA if harmful<br>
fault currents If having frequencies of 50Hz may possibly be generated. However, as<br>
shown in Fig. 8, the maximum values of the limit curve G1 significantly increase as<br>
the frequency of the fault currents If increases.<br>
In addition, several types of fault currents If may occur that can cause harm to<br>
a user of an electric device or than can cause a fire in the user's home. The different<br><br>
types of fault currents include an alternating fault current, a pulsating direct fault<br>
current, and a smooth direct fault current.<br>
An alternating fault current occurs when the fault current If is an alternating<br>
signal and the magnitude of negative amplitude of the input signal is distorted with<br>
respect to the positive amplitude of the input signal. A smooth direct fault current<br>
occurs when the magnitude of the negative amplitude or the magnitude of the positive<br>
amplitude of the fault current If falls within a certain range of values around the<br>
effective value of the fault current If. A pulsating direct fault current occurs when the<br>
magnitude of the negative amplitude or the magnitude of the positive amplitude falls<br>
outside the certain range of values around the effective value of the fault current If.<br>
Accordingly, the circuit breaker 1 should ideally detect whether or not a fault<br>
current If has occurred, what type of fault current If has occurred, and whether or not<br>
the particular type of fault current If is severe. Whenever a particular type of fault<br>
current If is severe, the circuit breaker 1 should ideally trip to prevent electric power<br>
from being supplied to the user's electric device.<br>
Although the above-described circuit breaker 1 detects fault currents If and<br>
blocks the supply of power to the electric device in some instances, it is implemented<br>
via analog or digital hardware. Therefore, designing the circuit breaker 1 so that it<br>
adequately detects fault currents If, distinguishes the detected fault currents If from<br>
among multiple types of fault currents If, and determines the severity of the detected<br>
fault currents If, is extremely complex, if not impossible. Furthermore, since the<br>
design of the circuit breaker 1 has a complex hardware design, it has to be custom-<br>
made for each specific application and standard under which it is to operate.<br>
Accordingly, mass-producing the circuit breaker 1 is virtually impossible, and<br>
modifying the design of the circuit breaker 1 is very difficult.<br><br>
In addition, many electrical components that are connected to the conductor<br>
network LN typically generate brief, transient leakage currents that are supplied to the<br>
electric device for a relatively short period of time. When such transient leakage<br>
"currents are generated, they will not damage the electric device in the user's home or<br>
cause a fire. However, since the circuit breaker 1 is implemented via hardware, it<br>
cannot easily distinguish between harmless transient leakage currents having short<br>
durations and damaging fault currents having longer durations. As a result, the<br>
leakage currents often cause the circuit breaker 1 to trip and unnecessarily prevent<br>
power from being supplied to the electric device. Accordingly, the operational<br>
efficiency of the electric device is substantially degraded.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a fault current detection<br>
system that can detect fault currents, distinguish the detected fault currents from<br>
among multiple types of fault currents, determine the severity of the detected fault<br>
currents, and determine the frequencies of the different fault currents. A related<br>
object is to provide such a fault detection system that is capable of detecting these<br>
parameters more accurately than possible heretofore.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a fault current detection<br>
system that can be easily mass-produced and that can be easily modified to work in<br>
many different environments.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a fault current<br>
detection system that can easily distinguish between harmless transient leakage<br>
currents having short durations and damaging fault currents having longer durations.<br><br>
In order to achieve the above and other objects, a fault current detection<br>
software program is provided. The software program is contained in a computer<br>
readable medium and includes instructions to perform a routine comprising: (a)<br>
determining predetermined characteristics of said fault current based on a detection<br>
signal corresponding to said fault current; (b) identifying said fault current as a first<br>
type of fault current when at least one of said predetermined characteristics has a first<br>
predetermined value; (c) setting a trigger current to a first trigger current value when<br>
said fault current is identified as said first type of fault current; and (d) outputting a<br>
control signal when said fault current and said trigger current have a predetermined<br>
relationship.<br>
In order to further achieve the above and other objects, another fault current<br>
detection software program is provided. This software program is also contained in a<br>
computer readable medium and includes instructions to perform a routine comprising:<br>
(a) determining at least a frequency of said fault current based on a detection signal<br>
corresponding to a fault current; (b) determining if said frequency of said fault current<br>
is greater than a first predetermined frequency; (c) identifying said fault current as a<br>
high frequency fault current when said frequency is greater than or equal to said first<br>
predetermined frequency; and (d) when said frequency is less than said first<br>
predetermined frequency, identifying said fault current as a waveform fault current.<br>
In order to still further achieve the above an other objects, a fault current<br>
detection system is provided. The detection system detects a fault current generated<br>
on a conductive path supplying power to an electric device and prevents the fault<br>
current from being supplied to the electric device. The fault current detection system<br>
comprises: a detector that detects a fault current generated on said conductive path<br>
and outputs a corresponding detection signal; a switch that is provided in said<br><br>
conductive path that selectively isolates said electric device from said conductive path<br>
corresponding to a fault current; and a controller that inputs said detection signal and<br>
determines predetermined characteristics of said fault current based on said detection<br>
signal, wherein said controller identifies said fault current as a first type of fault<br>
current when at least one of said predetermined characteristics has a first<br>
predetermined value, wherein said controller sets a trigger current to a first trigger<br>
current value when said fault current is identified as said first type of fault current,<br>
and wherein said controller outputs a control signal to said switch to instruct said<br>
switch to isolate said electric device from said conductive network when said fault<br>
current and said trigger current have a predetermined relationship.<br>
In order to even further achieve the above and other objects, another fault<br>
current detection system is provided. The detection system detects a fault current<br>
generated on a conductive path supplying power to an electric device and prevents the<br>
fault current from being supplied to the electric device. The fault current detection<br>
system comprises: a detector that detects a fault current generated on said conductive<br>
path and outputs a corresponding detection signal; a switch that is provided in said<br>
conductive path that selectively isolates said electric device from said conductive path<br>
corresponding to a fault current; and a controller that inputs said detection signal and<br>
determines at least a frequency of said fault current based on said detection signal,<br>
and wherein said controller determines if said frequency of said fault current is greater<br>
than a first predetermined frequency, wherein said controller identifies said fault<br>
current as a high frequency fault current when said frequency is greater than or equal<br>
to said first predetermined frequency, wherein, when said frequency is less than said<br>
first predetermined frequency, said controller identifies said fault current as a<br>
waveform fault current<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following description of the preferred embodiments discloses specific<br>
configurations, components, and process steps. However, the preferred embodiments<br>
are merely examples of the present invention, and thus, the specific features described<br>
below are merely used to more easily describe such embodiments and to provide an<br>
overall understanding of the present invention. Accordingly, one skilled in the art<br>
will readily recognize that the present invention is not limited to the specific<br>
embodiments described below. Furthermore, the descriptions of various<br>
configurations, components, and steps of the present invention that are known to one<br>
skilled in the art are omitted for the sake of clarity and brevity.<br>
An example of the structure of a fault current detection system in accordance<br>
with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention is shown in Fig. 1. As shown<br>
in the figure, the system comprises a sum current transformer 20, a controller 30, and<br>
a switch 40. A conductor network 10 forms a primary winding of the sum current<br>
transformer 20 and is connected to an electric device via the switch 40. The<br>
configuration of and interconnections among the conductor network 10, sum current<br>
transformer 20, and switch 40 are preferably similar to those of the corresponding<br>
components shown in Fig. 7 and will not be discussed in greater detail for the sake of<br>
brevity.<br>
The controller 30 receives a detection signal from the sum current transformer<br>
20, and the detection signal corresponds to a fault current If that has been generated on<br>
the conductor network 10. Based on the detection signal, the controller 30 determines<br><br>
what type of fault current exists and the severity of the fault current. Then, the<br>
controller 30 outputs a control signal to the switch 40 to instruct the switch 40 to<br>
block the supply of the fault current If to the electric, device, if necessary.<br>
The operation of the controller 30 is controlled via a software program. The<br>
software program may be supplied to the controller 30 via a read only memory<br>
("ROM"), a random access memory ("RAM"), a floppy disk, a hard disk, an optical<br>
disk, a carrier wave (e.g. a carrier wave transmitted via the internet, a vertical<br>
blanking interval of a television signal, etc.), or any other computer readable medium.<br>
An illustrative embodiment of the routines of the software program executed by the<br>
controller 30 is shown in the flow charts in Figs. 2-6.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the controller 30 generates an image of the fault current If<br>
as a function of time. The image of the fault current If may be determined by<br>
continually measuring the value of the fault current If as a continuous function of time<br>
or may be determined by measuring the value of the fault current at discrete points of<br>
time. Once the image of the fault current If is determined, the controller 30 calculates<br>
one or more of the following values (step S190):<br>
I∆eff:	The effective value of the fault current<br>
-Ỉ:	The amplitude of the negative half-wave of the fault current, if present<br>
+Ỉ:	The amplitude of the positive half-wave of the fault current, if present<br>
T:	The period of the fault current<br>
f:	The frequency of the fault current<br>
Also, the frequency f of the fault current If may be measured directly from the image<br>
of the fault current If. On the other hand, the period T of the fault current If may be<br>
measured, and the frequency f of the fault current If may be calculated from the period<br>
T. Suitable algorithms for determining the above values are well known to one<br>
skilled in the art upon reading the specification, and therefore, they will not be<br>
described for the sake of brevity.<br><br>
After the above values are determined, the controller 30 determines if the<br>
frequency f of the fault current If is greater than or equal to a threshold frequency (e.g.<br>
500 Hz) (step S200). If the frequency f is greater than or equal to 500 Hz, the<br>
controller 30 concludes that the fault current If is a high frequency fault current that<br>
may cause ventricular fibrillation in a user or a fire in the electrical system (step<br>
S210). An example of the various frequencies and values of fault currents If that will<br>
cause ventricular fibrillation and fire was previously discussed in conjunction with<br>
Fig. 8. Furthermore, the value of the threshold frequency is not limited to 500 Hz and<br>
will depend upon the specific characteristics and the particular application in which<br>
the detection system is used.<br>
After recognizing that the fault current If is a high frequency fault current, the<br>
controller 30 determines if the frequency f of the fault current is less than 1 kHz (step<br>
S220). If the frequency f is less than 1 kHz (and greater than 500 Hz), the controller<br>
30 determines that the value of the fault current If cannot exceed the fibrillation limit<br>
curve G1 shown in Fig. 8. Specifically, if the frequency f of the fault current If has a<br>
value between 500 Hz and 1 kHz, the fault current If will not cause ventricular<br>
fibrillation or a fire if the value of the current If falls below the fibrillation limit curve<br>
Gl. Accordingly, the controller 30 sets the trigger current I∆trigger based on the<br>
fibrillation limit curve G1 and sets the trigger time I∆trigger according to specific<br>
applications and standards (step S230). If the fault current If exceeds the trigger<br>
current I∆trigger for a period of time that is greater than or equal to the trigger time<br>
I∆trigger, the controller 30 outputs the control signal to instruct the switch 40 to block<br>
the supply of electric power to the electric device. The trigger current I∆trigger is<br>
determined preferably based on the following equation:<br><br><br>
where A is a parameter that equals a value between 0.5 and 1.0 and LC represents the<br>
fibrillation limit curve G1 shown in Fig. 8. Thus, as shown in Fig. 8, if the frequency<br>
f of the fault current If equals 600 Hz, the trigger current I∆trigger would equal<br>
approximately A * 280 mA. Also, the trigger time I∆trigger is set equal to a parameter<br>
T2 that is determined by the specific application and characteristics of the fault current<br>
detection system. In the specific example, the trigger time I∆trigger equals between 10<br>
ms and 300 ms.<br>
On the other hand, if the frequency f of the fault current If is determined to be<br>
greater than or equal to 1 kHz in step 220, the controller 30 determines that the value<br>
of the fault current If cannot exceed the fire prevention limit curve G2 shown in Fig.<br>
8. In particular, if the frequency of the fault current If has a value greater than or<br>
equal to 1 kHz, the fault current If will not cause ventricular fibrillation or a fire if the<br>
value of the current If falls below the fire prevention limit curve G2. Accordingly, the<br>
controller 30 sets the trigger current I∆trigger based on the limit curve G2 and sets the<br>
trigger time I∆trigger according to specific applications and standards (step S240). In<br>
the present embodiment, since a fire will not occur (and ventricular fibrillation will<br>
not occur) as long as the fault current If is less than approximately 420 mA for<br>
frequencies above 1 kHz, the controller 30 sets the trigger current I∆trigger equal to 420<br>
mA. Also, in the present embodiment, the trigger time I∆trigger is set to a parameter T|,<br>
which preferably equals a value between 50 ms and 500 ms.<br>
In step S200, if the frequency f of the fault current If is less than 500 Hz, the<br>
controller 30 identifies the type of the fault current If according to the procedure<br>
shown in Fig. 3. In particular, the controller 30 determines whether or not the fault<br>
current is an alternating fault current (step S300). The fault current is considered to<br><br>
be an alternating fault current if the magnitude of the negative amplitude -I of the<br>
fault current If is greater than or equal to a predetermined fraction Z of the magnitude<br>
of the positive amplitude +Ỉ of the fault current If when the magnitude of the negative<br>
amplitude -Ỉ is less than or equal to the magnitude of the positive amplitude +Ỉ. In<br>
other words, the fault current If is considered to be an alternating fault current if the<br>
following equation is satisfied:<br><br>
The value of the predetermined fraction Z is based on the specific application and<br>
characteristics of the fault current detection system, and in the present embodiment,<br>
the fraction Z has a value between 0.1 and 0.2.<br>
Furthermore, the fault current If is also considered to be an alternating fault<br>
current if the magnitude of the positive amplitude +Ỉ is greater than or equal to the<br>
predetermined fraction Z of the magnitude of the negative amplitude -Ỉ when the<br>
magnitude of the negative amplitude -Ỉ is greater than the magnitude of the positive<br>
amplitude +Ỉ. In other words, the fault current If is also considered to be an<br>
alternating fault current if the following equation is satisfied:<br><br>
If the fault current If is determined to be an alternating fault current, the<br>
alternating fault current triggering routine shown in Fig. 4 is executed (step S310). As<br>
shown in Fig. 4, the controller 30 determines if the effective value I∆eff of the fault<br>
current If satisfies the following relationship:<br><br><br>
where B is a parameter that has a value between 1 and 500 (step S400). The value of<br>
the parameter B is determined based on the specific applications and standards of the<br>
environment in which the fault current detection system is used. If the effective value<br>
I∆eff of the fault current If satisfies relationship (4), the controller 30 outputs a control<br>
signal to prevent the supply of power to the electric device according to a first<br>
alternating fault current ("AFC") triggering routine (i.e. a "500A" AFC triggering<br>
routine) (step S410). In the triggering routine, the triggering current I∆trigger and the<br>
triggering time I∆trigger are determined according to specific applications and standards.<br>
On the other hand, if the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If does not<br>
satisfy relationship (4), the controller 30 determines if the effective value I∆eff of the<br>
fault current If satisfies the following relationship:<br>
IAeff≥5*LC (5)<br>
where the term LC corresponds to the fibrillation limit curve G1 shown in Fig. 8 (step<br>
S420). Specifically, the term LC represents the value of the limit curve G1 at the<br>
frequency f of the fault current If. If the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If<br>
satisfies relationship (5), the controller 30 outputs a control signal to prevent the<br>
supply of power to the electric device according to a second AFC triggering routine<br>
(i.e. a "5 * LC" AFC triggering routine) (step S430). In the triggering routine, the<br>
triggering current I∆trigger and the triggering time I∆trigger are determined according to<br>
specific applications and standards.<br><br><br>
However, if the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If does not satisfy<br>
relationship (5), the controller 30 determines if the effective value I∆eff of the fault<br>
current If satisfies the following relationship:<br><br>
(step S440). If the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If satisfies relationship (6),<br>
the controller 30 outputs a control signal to prevent the supply of power to the electric<br>
device according to a third AFC triggering routine (i.e. a "2 * LC" AFC triggering<br>
routine) (step S450). In the triggering routine, the triggering current I∆trigger and the<br>
triggering time I∆trigger are determined according to specific applications and standards.<br>
If the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If does not satisfy relationship<br>
(6), the controller 30 determines if the effective value I∆eff satisfies the following<br>
relationship:<br><br>
where the parameter C equals a value between 0.5 and 1.0 based on the particular<br>
operating conditions and application of the fault current protection circuit (step S460).<br>
If the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If satisfies relationship (7), the controller<br>
30 outputs a control signal to prevent the supply of power to the electric device<br>
according to a fourth AFC triggering routine (i.e. a "1 * LC" AFC triggering routine)<br>
(step S470). In the triggering routine, the triggering current I∆trigger and the triggering<br>
time I∆trigger are determined according to the specific application and characteristics of<br>
the fault current detection system.<br><br>
If the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If does not satisfy relationship<br>
(7), the controller 30 may output a message to inform a user or operator that the fault<br>
current detection system has not been activated and may store the effective value I∆eff<br>
of the fault current If (step S480). Then, the controller 30 proceeds to step S190 (Fig.<br>
2) to update the measured values relating to the fault current If and performs the<br>
remaining steps shown in Fig. 2 (step S490).<br>
If the controller 30 determines that the fault current If is not an alternating fault<br>
current in step S300 (Fig. 3), the controller 30 determines whether or not the fault<br>
current If is a smooth direct fault current (step S320). In particular, the controller 30<br>
determines if one of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) the magnitude of the<br>
negative amplitude -Ỉ of the fault current is less than or equal to a multiple Y of the<br>
effective value I∆eff of the fault current If or (2) the magnitude of the positive<br>
amplitude +Ỉ is less than or equal to the multiple Y of the effective value I∆eff of the<br>
fault current If. In other words, the controller 30 determines that the fault current If is<br>
a smooth direct fault current if the following relationship is satisfied:<br><br>
Again, the value of the multiple Y is based on the specific application and<br>
characteristics of the fault current detection system, and in the present embodiment,<br>
the multiple Y has a value between 1.1 and 1.2.<br>
If the fault current If is determined to be smooth direct fault current, the<br>
smooth direct fault current triggering routine shown in Fig. 5 is executed (step S330).<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the controller 30 determines if the effective value I∆eff of the fault<br>
current If satisfies the following relationship:<br><br><br>
where F is a parameter that has a value between 1 and 500 (step S500). The value of<br>
the parameter F is determined based on specific applications and standards. If the<br>
effective value I∆eff of the fault current If satisfies relationship (9), the controller 30<br>
outputs a control signal to prevent the supply of power to the electric device according<br>
to a first smooth direct fault current ("SDFC") triggering routine (i.e. a "500A" SDFC<br>
triggering routine) (step S510). In the triggering routine, the triggering current I∆trigger<br>
and the triggering time I∆trigger are determined according to specific applications and<br>
standards.<br>
On the other hand, if the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If does not<br>
satisfy relationship (9), the controller 30 determines if the effective value I∆eff of the<br>
fault current If satisfies the following relationship:<br><br>
where I∆n equals the rated residual current (or nominal fault current) of the circuit<br>
breaker. The current I∆n is equivalent to the value LCf(50), where LCf(50) equals the<br>
value of the limit curve G1 at a frequency f that equals 50 Hz. (step S520). If the<br>
effective value I∆eff of the fault current If satisfies relationship (10), the controller 30<br>
outputs a control signal to prevent the supply of power to the electric device according<br>
to a second SDFC triggering routine (i.e. a "5 * 2 * I∆n" SDFC triggering routine)<br>
(step S530). In the triggering routine, the triggering current I∆trigger and the triggering<br>
time I∆trigger are determined according to the specific application and characteristics of<br>
the fault current detection system.<br><br>
However, if the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If does not satisfy<br>
relationship (10), the controller 30 determines if the effective value I∆eff satisfies the<br>
following relationship:<br><br>
(step S540). If the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If satisfies relationship (11),<br>
the controller 30 outputs a control signal to prevent the supply of power to the electric<br>
device according to a third SDFC triggering routine (i.e. a "2 * 2 * I∆en" SDFC<br>
triggering routine) (step S550). In the triggering routine, the triggering current I∆trigger<br>
and the triggering time I∆trigger are determined according to specific applications and<br>
standards.<br>
If the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If does not satisfy relationship<br>
(11), the controller 30 determines if the effective value I∆eff satisfies the following<br>
relationship:<br>
I∆eff≥G*I∆n (12)<br>
where the parameter G equals a value between 0.5 and 2 and is based on the particular<br>
operating conditions and features of the fault current detection system (step S560). If<br>
the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If satisfies relationship (12), the controller<br>
30 outputs a control signal to prevent the supply of power to the electric device<br>
according to a fourth SDFC triggering routine (i.e. a "1 * I∆n" SDFC triggering<br>
routine) (step S570). In the triggering routine, the triggering current I∆trigger and the<br>
triggering time I∆trigger are determined according to specific applications and standards.<br><br>
If the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If does not satisfy relationship<br>
(12), the controller 30 may output a message to inform a user or operator that the<br>
detection system has not been activated and may store the effective value I∆eff of the<br>
fault current If (step S580). Then, the controller 30 proceeds to step SI90 (Fig. 2) to<br>
update the measured values relating to the fault current If and performs the remaining<br>
steps shown in Fig. 2 (step S590).<br>
If the controller 30 determines that the fault current is not a smooth direct fault<br>
current in step S320 (Fig. 3), the fault current is determined to be a pulsating direct<br>
fault current, and the pulsating direct fault current triggering routine shown in Fig. 6 is<br>
executed (step S340). As shown in Fig. 6, the controller 30 determines if the effective<br>
value I∆eff of the fault current If satisfies the following relationship:<br>
I∆eff ≥ D* 1 Ampere (13)<br>
where D is a parameter that has a value between 1 and 500 (step S600). The value of<br>
the parameter D is determined based on the specific application and characteristics of<br>
the fault current detection circuit. If the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If<br>
satisfies relationship (13), the controller 30 outputs a control signal to prevent the<br>
supply of power to the electric device according to a first pulsating direct fault current<br>
("PDFC") triggering routine (i.e. a "500A" PDFC triggering routine) (step S610). In<br>
the triggering routine, the triggering current I∆trigger and the triggering time I∆trigger are<br>
determined according to specific applications and standards.<br>
On the other hand, if the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If does not<br>
satisfy relationship (13), the controller 30 determines if the effective value I∆eff<br>
satisfies the following relationship:<br><br><br>
(step S620). If the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If satisfies relationship (14),<br>
the controller 30 outputs a control signal to prevent the supply of power to the electric<br>
device according to a second PDFC triggering routine (i.e. a "5 * 1.4 * LC" PDFC<br>
triggering routine) (step.S630). In the triggering routine, the triggering current I∆trigger<br>
and the triggering time I∆trigger are determined according to specific applications and<br>
standards.<br>
However, if the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If does not satisfy<br>
relationship (14), the controller 30 determines if the effective value I∆eff satisfies the<br>
following relationship:<br>
I∆eff ≥ 2 *1.4 * LC (15)<br>
(step S640). If the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If satisfies relationship (15),<br>
the controller 30 outputs a control signal to prevent the supply of power to the electric<br>
device according to a third PDFC triggering routine (i.e. a "2 * 1.4 * LC" PDFC<br>
triggering routine) (step S650). In the triggering routine, the triggering current I∆trigger<br>
and the triggering time I∆trigger are determined according to specific applications and<br>
standards.<br>
If the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If does not satisfy relationship<br>
(15), the controller 30 determines if the effective value I∆eff satisfies the following<br>
relationship:<br><br><br>
where the parameter E equals a value between 0.5 and 1.4 based on the particular<br>
operating conditions and features of the fault current detection system (step S660). If<br>
the effective value I∆eff satisfies relationship (16), the controller 30 outputs a control<br>
signal to prevent the supply of power to the electric device according to a fourth<br>
PDFC triggering routine,(i.e. a "1 * LC" PDFC triggering routine) (step S670). In the<br>
triggering routine, the triggering current I∆trigger and the triggering time I∆trigger are<br>
determined according to the specific applications and standards.<br>
If the effective value I∆eff of the fault current If does not satisfy relationship<br>
(16), the controller 30 may output a message to inform a user or operator that the fault<br>
current detection system has not been activated and may store the effective value I∆eff<br>
of the fault current If (step S680). Then, the controller 30 proceeds to step S190 (Fig.<br>
2) to update the measured values relating to the fault current If and performs the<br>
remaining steps shown in Fig. 2 (step S690).<br>
As described above, the controller 30 determines the type of fault current If<br>
and the severity of the fault current If via software. Accordingly, the controller 30 can<br>
be mass-produced from relatively simple and inexpensive hardware. In addition,<br>
since the various parameters used in the routines are stored in software, they can<br>
easily be modified and changed by a user. As a result, the controller 30 can be easily<br>
modified so that it is compatible with many different electric devices operating under<br>
many different types of operating conditions.<br>
Also, as described above, the controller 30 stores various triggering times<br>
I∆trigger and uses them in the software routines to ensure that the fault current detection<br>
system is not activated to block the input signal that is input to the electric device<br>
unnecessarily. For instance, if brief, transient leakage currents are generated and are<br>
supplied to the electric device for a relatively short period of time, the controller 30<br><br>
does not trigger the protection circuit because the duration of the leakage current is<br>
less than the various trigger times I∆trigger. As a result, the operation of the electric<br>
device is not affected or interrupted, and the operational efficiency of the electric<br>
device is substantially enhanced.<br>
