SYSTEM FOR PLANNING AND TRACKING CERTIFICATION<br>
The present invention relates to system for planning and<br>
tracking certification and generally to the filed of user certification, and<br>
more particularly to meeting the requirements for such certification<br>
using network of interconnected computers.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A number of professional occupations have associated certification<br>
requirements. Such requirements are usually specified by public or private<br>
rustitutions, such as national, state or local governments on the public side and<br>
various professional associations (e.g., medical legal, or accounting, etc) on the<br><br>
private side. For example, state governments promulgate certification<br>
requirements for teachers, nurses, engineer and psychotherapists, among others.<br>
These professionals must meet an initial set of requirements to be licensed or<br>
certified to practice in their state, and must often meet continuing education<br>
requirements, such as additional course work, in order to stay certified.<br>
Once a professional, such as a teacher, is required to satisfy a set of<br>
certification requirements in a state, it is up to the professional to determine what<br>
requirements have been met, what requirements are still needed to be met, and<br>
how to fulfill such requirements. For example, if additional course work is<br>
required, the teacher needs to identify what courses are offered by which<br>
institutions, and must keep track on her own of when those courses axe completed.<br>
Sylvan Learning Systems, Inc., the assignee of the present invention,<br>
provides a web site at ProfessionaITeacher.com that consolidates difficult-to-find<br>
information regarding teaching certification and re-certification requirements for<br>
all 50 states. The web site provides information on certification in each state and<br>
gives necessary forms, recommended reading and course work, and contact<br>
information for the departments of education of each state. The web site also<br>
provides information to certified teachers moving from one state to another state<br>
regarding certification requirements in that state.<br><br>
There have been several approaches to framing and certifying knowledge<br>
of students and professionals. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,590,057 to Fletcher<br>
et al. describes a system and method for training individuals in a specific task and<br>
then certifying that the individual knows how to perform the task. One of trie<br>
draw backs of the disclosed system is that if the individual must be certified in-<br>
more than one task, the system does not keep track of multiple requirements that â€¢<br>
need to be completed by the individual.<br>
.U.S. Patent No. 5,788,504 to Rice et al. describes a computerized training<br>
management system that allows managers to develop a training materials<br>
database, correlated to reference manuals. U.S. Patent No. 6,157,808 to<br>
Hollingsworth describes a computerized employee certification and training<br>
system and method for employees that require governmental certification or<br>
licensing. The training system associates employee qualifications, job<br>
descriptions, and training materials to determine if an employee is qualified for a<br>
job. Neither of the systems of the '504 patent and the '808 patent, however, track<br>
 user certification requirements that an individual professional might need that are<br>
not training related, such as, for example, background checks or forms. Neither<br>
system tracks training that might occur outside of the employee's company.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,561,812 to Burmester et al. describes a system and<br>
method that correlate educational requirements with learning activities in schools,<br>
allowing a teacher to create lesson plans that meet the educational requirements.<br>
In this system, however, the system does not keep track' of student completion of<br>
certification requirements.	<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,270,351 B1 to Roper describes an individual education program<br>
tracking system provides an automated means for creating and administering an<br>
entire individual education plan. Embodied in a computer software program and<br>
network, the individual education program tracking system enables teachers, school<br>
administrators, counsellors and parents to enter a student profile, create an individual<br>
education plan for the student based on the student's profile, track the student's<br>
progress, and perform periodic evaluations and assessments. The individual education<br>
program tracking system also automates the completion and submission of various<br>
forms as required by a school district or state department of education. The individual<br>
education program tracking system integrates and automates procedures that meet a<br>
state's or district's legal requirements for administering an individual education plan,<br>
such as entry qualification evaluations and parental authorization.<br><br>
U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2003/0046265 A1 to Orton et at describes a<br>
method and system for creating and implementing personalized training programs<br>
and providing training services over an electronic network. The method includes<br>
receiving a request to generate a personalized training program by a user: retrieving<br>
feedback surveys associated with the user; assessing the user's knowledge relating to<br>
leadership competencies, working environment, and leadership approaches;<br>
generating a training plan for the user in response to the feedback surveys and user's<br>
 knowledge; and tracking the user's progress relating to said training plan. The<br>
invention also provides a method for directing a user to online resources for resolving<br>
specific problems. The invention further enables a user to develop a long term career<br>
development plan and receive automatic email alerts relating to new and existing<br>
resources according to the user's interests and career plans.<br>
Therefore, there exists a need for an automated system and method that<br>
aEow certification planning and tracking progress toward certification goals.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Briefly, according to one aspect of the present invention, a system and<br>
method for planning and tracking certification comprises generating one or mors<br>
certification goals by a planner based on a user profile and an authority profile .<br>
associated with a certification authority. The planner is responsive to user<br>
selection of one or more of the generated certification goals for creatirrg-a<br>
certification plan. A tracker that updates the certification plan in response to input<br><br>
regarding achievement of the one or more selected certification goals. According<br>
to some of the more detailed features of the invention, the tracker sends e-mail<br>
reminders to the user when a goal deadline approaches.<br>

Detailed Description of an Exemplary Embodiment of the Present Invention<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention is discussed in detail below.<br>
While specific exemplary embodiments are discussed, it should be understood that<br>
this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will<br>
recognize that other components and configurations can be used without parting<br>
from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
The invention is directed to a computer-based online system. A user<br>
seeking certification can access the data and services through any computer<br>
capable of connecting to a network for planning and tracking certification<br>
requirements. In one exemplary embodiment, the data and services are provided<br>
from one or more servers (or a central station) having access to one or more<br>
databases also connected to a network, and can be accessed through a standard<br>
web browser application, such as Microsoft Explorer or Netscape Navigator. The<br>
instant invention can also be implemented using Intranets systems for user<br>
certification in any governmental or non-governmental agencies as well as public<br>
or private institutions.<br>
The Exemplary Network<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an exemplary embodiment of a system that<br>
advantageously implements the various aspects of the present invention is shown.<br>
The exemplary system is implemented over a communication network that<br>
provides wired or wireless links to user devices (client devices) 12. The client<br>
devices 12 can be any computing device, such as a personal computer, etc. The<br>
present invention can use the standard Internet protocols for the various devices<br>
12 that connect to one or more servers 10 with access to various types of<br>
databases 24. The Internet 16 is a collection of interconnected (public and/or<br>
private) networks that are linked together by a set of standard protocols to form a<br>
global, distributed network. It should be noted that although the exemplary<br>
embodiment described herein uses a client-server computing model, the present<br>
invention can also be implemented using any other suitable computing models,<br><br><br>
such as a central station or a computer mainframe connected to various types of<br>
terminals.<br>
Under the present invention, client devices 12 can be any device that is<br>
used by anyone seeking user certification information and goal tracking, including<br>
a teacher, a nurse, an engineer, and a psychologist, etc. Examples of wired<br>
devices include personal computers, mobile computers, notebooks, workstations,<br>
etc., which operate under any workstation operating system, e.g., Windows or<br>
Mac OS operating systems. Examples of the wireless devices include personal<br>
digital assistant (PDAs) that operate under an appropriately configured operating<br>
system, such as Palm OS or Windows CE. The devices 12 include a visual<br>
display for providing a visual interface with a user. However, the devices 12 are<br>
also capable of communicating information in any form, including audio and<br>
video form, or in any other form conceivable by one skilled in the art.<br>
The server 10 communicates with the devices 12, also referred to as workstations or client workstati<br>
through the Internet 16 and tlirough network layer interfaces 19. It is to be noted that the network used in<br>
connection with the present invention can use any one of open- or proprietary-<br>
network standards, such as TCP/IP protocols. Any type of suitable wired or<br>
wireless adapters can be used to connect a computer network to a user device 12.<br>
Examples of such adapters include, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the system of the invention includes one or more<br>
databases 24 that can be managed centrally or in a distributed manner. The<br>
databases, which are accessible by the servers 10, store various information<br>
related to user certification and/or licensing requirements and individual goal data<br>
for each user in accordance with the present invention. Database 24 may contain<br>
user certification requirements for every state, and/or professional licensing<br>
requirements for every state depending upon the type of professional requirements<br>
to be monitored. For example, database 24 may contain certification requirement<br>
data in order to obtain at least one of a teaching certification/re-certification,<br>
nursing certification, certification/licensing for engineers, psychotherapists,<br>
accountants or other professionals. The user certification requirement data<br>
includes at least one of certification requirements, re-certification requirements,<br>
requirements for transferring certification from one state (province or other<br><br><br>
government entity) to another state (province or other government entity),<br>
certification forms and contact information for a government entity certification<br>
department. As stated above, the user devices 12 may include a personal<br>
computer, handheld communication devices, or any other devices capable of<br>
communicating with the database through the network.<br>
As is known, the Internet 16 is a distributed network that supports the<br>
World Wide Web ("Web"). The Web refers generally to both (i) a distributed<br>
collection of mter-linked, user-viewable hypertext documents (commonly referred<br>
to as Web documents or Web pages) that are accessible via the Ihtemet, and (ii)<br>
the user and server software components which provide user access to such<br>
documents using standardized Intemet protocols. Currently, the primary standard<br>
protocol for allowing applications to locate and acquire Web documents is HTTP,<br>
and the Web pages are encoded using HTML. WML is the markup language used<br>
for by wireless application protocols, such as that specified by WAP. WAP is an<br>
XML-defined markup language similar to the HTML standard used on the<br>
Internet today. The WAP standard also includes a scripting language similar to<br>
JavaScript, but is optimized for WAP clients.<br>
The terms "Web" and "World Wide Web" encompass future markup<br>
languages and transport protocols which may be used in place of (or in addition<br>
to) HTML, WML, XML, WAP and HTTP. The present invention can also<br>
operate on internal networks (Intranets) and networks utilizing different<br>
communication protocols. The Intranet model is typically used internally by<br>
companies to allow access to company information.<br>
A Web Site is a computer system that serves informational content over<br>
the network using the standard protocols of the World Wide Web. Typically, a<br>
Web site corresponds to a particular Internet domain name and includes the<br>
content associated with a particular organization. As used herein, the term is<br>
generally intended to encompass both (i) the hardware/software server<br>
components that serve the informational content over the network, and (ii) the<br>
"backend" hardware/software components, including any non-standard or<br>
specialized components, that interact with the server components to perform<br>
services for Web site users.<br><br><br>
The present invention supports an interactive web site. The site provides<br>
user certification requirement data for each state. It is through the interactive web<br>
site that the present invention can be implemented to provide a suitable<br>
teacher/user certification for any governmental or non-governmental agency or<br>
public or private institution. When a professional user logs into the site, he/she can<br>
create a personalized certification goal plan based on information provided by the<br>
interactive web site according to the invention. The goal plan is related to the<br>
certification requirements for a particular state. The professional user can then<br>
track the completion of certification requirements using the interactive software<br>
according to the invention. The site also provides online courses and distance<br>
learning classes that meet course work requirements for certification. Although<br>
the preferred embodiment of the present invention is implemented over a web-<br>
based configuration, it would be appreciated that the present invention can also be<br>
implemented under a configuration that does not require accessing a web-site.<br>
Rather, the interaction between the professional seeking certification and the<br>
computer network may through any suitable non-web based interface.<br>
Overview of Certification Planning System<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram that illustrates an overview of an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the system of the present invention. The certification goal<br>
planning system 202 can be implemented on one or more servers 10 or a central<br>
station. The system 202 has a planning module 204 and a tracking module 206.<br>
Data about user certification requirements can be stored in one or more databases<br>
208. In addition, for every registered user, the system 202 creates and stores a<br>
personalized user certification plan 210. The system 202 has an interface 212 to a<br>
network 214, such as, for example, over the Internet or any other suitable network.<br>
A user 216 can access the system 202 through a computer 12, which has its own<br>
interface 218 with the network 214. In an exemplary embodiment, the user 216<br>
uses a browser application on the computer 12 to interact with the system 202.<br>
User certification as herein defined means confirmation or attestation by a<br>
certification authority that a person meets governing standards or requirements in<br>
a user's field of endeavor. Examples of user certification include but are not<br>
limited to certification, re-certification, licensing, re-licensing in such fields of<br><br><br>
endeavor as education, medical, engineering, legal, accounting, sports, etc.<br>
Examples of certification authority include federal, state, county, local, municipal<br>
governments, public or private officials as well as governmental or non-<br>
governmental agencies or institutions, among others.<br>
Accessing Certification Planning System<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart that illustrates an exemplary embodiment for<br>
accessing and using the system of the present invention. When a user, such as a<br>
professional (e.g., teacher, nurse, engineer, accountant, etc.) accesses the system<br>
of the invention in step 302, a Systems Access page such as shown in FIG. 4 may<br>
be displayed. The System Access page allows a user to access the system of the<br>
invention through a web site provided by a server that is configured to mange<br>
certification plans. It should be noted, however, that the access to the system of<br>
the invention may also be through a suitable non-web based system access means.<br>
The user can also access the system either directly, as explained above, or<br>
through another web site. For example, for teaching certification, links may be set<br>
up in various partner organizations, such as the National Education Association,<br>
so that teachers can access and create certification plans from that organization's<br>
web site.<br>
The System Access page includes a log-in section for registered users to<br>
log in. The System Access page also allows unregistered users to create a user<br>
account, which they may access by logging in to the system. Using this page,<br>
registered users can enter log-in information, e.g., user name and password, to<br>
access their account. Once a user's information is entered, a determination is<br>
made as to whether the user is registered or not, as shown in step 304 of FIG. 3. If<br>
a registered user logs in, the system displays the user's home page, as shown in<br>
step 308. FIG. 5 shows the template for a typical User Home page, which<br>
provides various links for managing user certification according to the present<br>
invention. The User Home page may be configured to display suitable<br>
customized messages based on retrieved user profile Information and a<br>
certification authority profile information. For example, if the user is a teacher<br>
wishing to'certify or maintain state certification in, the displayed messages may be<br>
tailored based the related information solicited from the user and the state's<br><br><br>
certification requirements. Also, displayed may be messages regarding upcoming<br>
certification deadlines, or information of interest to the user.<br>
If not registered, the user is prompted to register and create an account.<br>
The user can create a unique user name and password during the registration<br>
process shown in step 306 of FIG. 3. FIG. 6 shows an exemplary User<br>
Registration page. The registration process, at a minimum, requires a user to enter<br>
his/her desired user name and password. The initial registration process may also<br>
require the user to enter additional information, such as name, address, phone<br>
number', e-mail address, credit card information, etc. After registration, the system<br>
creates a user account that the user can use to access his or her personalized home<br>
page. Using the created account, the user can create, plan and track progress<br>
toward certification goals in accordance with the present invention. All user-<br>
related information is suitably stored in a data base in corresponding records that<br>
store user profile information.<br>
A newly registered user can use the system of the invention for creating a<br>
personalized user certification plan, as shown in step 310 of FIG. 3. The process<br>
directs the users to a New User page, which enables the user to create his/her<br>
personalized certification plan. FIG. 7 shows an exemplary New User page,<br>
which is the initial home page for 'a user without a certification plan. This page<br>
describes the steps necessary for planning and tracking certification goals,<br>
including the steps for creating the user certification plan, reviewing the<br>
requirements for certification, selecting certification goals, e.g., course and<br>
classes, that would fulfill the certification plan. A "Go Create My Plan" link on<br>
the New User page allows the user to create a certification plan.<br>
I Once the plan is created, the user can access the plan from the user's<br>
home page. Using the user's home page, the certification can be tracked,<br>
modified, updated, as shown in step 312. As described later, the home page also<br>
allows for registering for certification resources on-line.<br>
Creating User Certification Plan<br>
; FIG. 8 shows an exemplary flowchart for creating a certification plan for a<br>
certification authority. In step 802, the system prompts the log in for system<br>
access system. In step 804, the system solicits a set of relevant user information<br><br>
for creating the certification plan. Exemplary solicited user information includes<br>
but is not limited to, the desired certification authority, e.g., one the states, number<br>
of years of experience in the field endeavor, academic information, e.g., degrees<br>
earned, specialties, and other details. For planning teacher certification in a state,<br>
for example, the system solicits information about years as a teacher, type of<br>
teacher certification, and the certification state of interest.<br>
Based on the user information or profile, the system retrieves an<br>
information contained in a corresponding certification authority profile and<br>
determines certification requirements of the authority for certification, as shown in<br>
steps 806 and 808. Based on the certification requirements of the certification<br>
authority, the system of the invention generates certification goals.<br>
A certification goal comprises performing one or more acts or events that<br>
measure skill in the field of endeavor. For example, a simple certification goal<br>
may require completing three hours of educational credit. The system also<br>
associates the certification goals with certification resources necessary to achieve<br>
the goals. For example, the three hours of educational credit may correspond to a<br>
course in a particular subject, reading a book, watching a video, listening to an<br>
audio program etc. The certification resources are then presented to the user, who<br>
may receive, order, or register for the resources online.<br>
If necessary, the certification requirements may be refined or otherwise<br>
customized based on other parameters, such as Needs Assessment information or<br>
Certification Credit information. Needs Assessment information relates to<br>
strength, weakness or preferences of the user. Generally, such information can be<br>
obtained either objectively or subjectively, for example, by test, examination,<br>
observation, or evaluation. Based on Needs Assessment information, the<br>
certification requirements may be adjusted in determining certification goals, if<br>
required by the certification authority. For example, the user may be required to<br>
meet certain goals, if Needs Assessment information indicates weakness in the<br>
field of endeavor. Similarly, the certification requirement may be adjusted based<br>
on strength or preference in the field of endeavor.<br>
Certification Credit information relates to a user's completed, in progress<br>
or planned activities that may refine certification requirements, if allowed by the<br><br><br>
certification authority. For example, certification goals may be reduced, because<br>
the user qualifies for credit for having completed or intending to complete a<br>
course or program in the field of endeavor. As such, the system of the present<br>
invention refines certification requirement based on Needs Assessment and/or<br>
Certification Credit information to determine goals of the certification plan, as<br>
shown in S10. The system of the invention can also prioritize the certification<br>
goals based on defined priority parameters, as described later in more detail, step<br>
S12.<br>
Once certification goals are determined, the user is presented with a<br>
planner that allows the user to select certification goals that constitute the user's<br>
certification plan, step 814. The planner can also present the certification<br>
resources that are associated with the certification goals for selection. The<br>
selection may be made from a list of certification resources, such as classes,<br>
courses, books, testing resources, which fulfill the certification goals. The<br>
certification goals can also require filling out forms, reading books, participating<br>
in a lecture (video, audio, live, etc.), and other material: or additional course work<br>
to be completed, etc. In one exemplary embodiment, the user can select<br>
certification goals, for example, classes, courses, lectures, seminars, forms, etc., to<br>
be included in the certification plan by checking corresponding items from a list<br>
of certification resources presented to the user. The system receives the selection<br>
and then generates a personalized user certification plan. As such, the<br>
certification plan can comprise either certification goals and/or certification<br>
resources.<br>
Certification Authority Profile<br>
The system of the invention stores certification requirements for each<br>
certification authority in suitable databases. Such certification requirements may<br>
be stored in a variety of ways, for example, as records having fields for storing<br>
information relating to certification requirements of a corresponding certification<br>
authority. As such, the system of the invention profiles each certification<br>
authority based on its specific certification requirements.<br><br><br>
User Information Profile<br>
FIG. 9 shows an initial page presented to the user for creating an<br>
exemplary teacher certification plan at a state within the US. However, the screen<br>
can be tailored for creating any other type of user certification plan. Essentially,<br>
the initial screen solicits relevant user information.for creating the user<br>
certification plan. The information solicitation and the entry of user information<br>
can be accomplished in a variety of ways. For example, any suitable interface,<br>
such as graphics, text, audio, etc. can be used.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 9, the solicited information<br>
are textual questions presented on the page, and the user enters responses to the<br>
solicited information in defined fields. As shown in FIG. 9, the input into the<br>
fields may be in free form, i.e.3 user text entry, or contain predefined responses<br>
presented by drop down fields, or one or more binary entries, e.g., YES/NO, or<br>
otherwise multiple choice entries, where the user can select an appropriate entry,<br>
among others. For creating the exemplar,' teacher certification, the solicited<br>
information fields include, "Years as a Teacher," "State You Teach In," "County<br>
of your school," "Your Highest Degree," Grade You Teach," etc.<br>
However, additional user information may be needed that can only be<br>
solicited based on previously entered user information. For example, user<br>
information entered in "State You Teach In" field may be needed in order to<br>
solicit information regarding the type of state licenses for which the certification<br>
plan is being created. Under such situations, a subsequent "Create Plan" page can<br>
be presented to the user having input fields presented based previously solicited<br>
user on a previous page. One such subsequent page is shown in FIG 10, where the<br>
pull down field for "Type of License" is presented based on user information<br>
entered in the "State You Teach In" field entered on previous page shown in FIG.<br>
9. Additional subsequent pages can be presented to the user until all the necessary<br>
user information for creating a certification plan is gathered. The gathered user<br>
information is suitably stored in the database along with other user information in<br>
the record that contains the users profile.<br><br><br>
Generating Certification Goals<br>
A planner according to the present invention uses user and certification<br>
authority profile information to determine the certification requirements for the<br>
field of endeavor. Based on such requirements, the planner generates certification<br>
goals that the user should achieve to get certified. For example, teacher<br>
certification requirements for a selected state may be profiled in terms of years of<br>
experience, degree, or any other pertinent information. Based on the entered user<br>
information, the planner presents the certification requirement in terms of goals<br>
that the user should fulfill in order to become a certified teacher in the selected<br>
state. The certification goals may correspond to various measurable activities,<br>
including filing out forms, reading books, completing one or more course,<br>
completing a degree program or meeting an other defined and measurable criteria.<br>
In one embodiment, achievement of the certification goals may be measured in<br>
terms of hours, units, or credits for courses, classes, seminar, sessions, etc. In<br>
other embodiments, the goals may be achieved by taking and passing a required<br>
test or fulfilling the requirement of a degree program (e.g., a masters degree). The<br>
goals may also require the user to meet goal-completion deadlines and due dates<br>
as required by the certification authority.<br>
FIG. 11 shows a Certification Requirement Summary page. The<br>
certification requirements shown on this page are generated based on information<br>
in the use and certification authority profiles. This page allows the user to review<br>
the certification requirements. A "Requirement Summary" section shows the state<br>
of certification, the type of certification, the year the user was last certified and the<br>
number of "units" needed to re-certify, as well as the due date for rectification.<br>
While the certification goal measurement is in terms of "units," other goal<br>
measures, such as hours or credits, maybe used to track certification goals.<br>
As stated above, one feature of the invention allows the planner to refine<br>
the certification plan based on needs and preferences of the user. If necessary, the<br>
Certification Requirement Summary page provides links that allows the system of<br>
the present invention to assess needs and preferences of the user, for example at<br>
another site. Such professional assessment information can pinpoint a user's areas<br>
of weakness, strength or interest. Based on such assessment information, the<br><br><br>
planner may customize the goals for user certification. As such, the user may use<br>
a "Needs Assessment" link to access his or her needs in the field of endeavor, for<br>
example, by taking tests designed to assess such needs.<br>
Another feature of the present invention allows the planner to take into<br>
account certification credit, for example, for previously taken courses, etc. FIG.<br>
12 is a "Certification Credit" link that allows the system to take into account all<br>
such user activities. This page solicits user information regarding completed, in-<br>
progress and planned activities and their type (e.g., graduate course, workshop,<br>
conference, etc.) that may qualify for certification credit. The planner can also<br>
require the user to enter a credit measurement for such activity, e.g., the number of<br>
hours, unit, or credits earned for the professional activity. Since some programs<br>
are measured in different "units", the page requesting information on the<br>
professional activity credit may include a conversion table where the user can<br>
convert one set of measurement to another. If the professional activity has not yet<br>
been done, the user can indicate that the activity is in-progress or being planned.<br>
In another embodiment, the system enables the user to transfer<br>
certification credit from one certification authority to another. A "Transfer<br>
Credit" link allows the uses to transfer credit earned from another certification<br>
authority to be applied to certification requirements on the other certification<br>
authority. For example, under this arrangement teachers can transfer credits<br>
earned in one state to another.<br>
Once the planner receives a user's Needs Assessment, Certification Credit<br>
and/or Credit Transfer information, it adjusts the certification requirements<br>
accordingly to generate the certification goals to fulfill the certification<br>
requirements.<br>
The planner can generate certification goals based on defined priority<br>
parameters. For example, certification requirements of an authority may take<br>
precedence over Needs Assessment and/or Certification Credit, when generating<br>
certification goals. Alternatively, temporary or ad hoc certification initiatives of<br>
the certification authority may have lower priority than more permanent and<br>
standard certification requirements, but higher priority than the Needs Assessment<br>
and/or Certification Credit. Under this embodiment of the invention, the planner<br><br><br>
generates certification goals based on defined priority parameters that relate to the<br>
certification requirements of of the certification authority.<br>
Planning Certification<br>
Planning comprises selecting certification goals. FIG. 13 shows an<br>
exemplary Certification Planner page that allows the user to select the goals for<br>
creating the certification plan. The planner also associates the certification goals<br>
with corresponding resources that facilitate achieving the goals.<br>
In the exemplary Certification Planner page shown in FIG. 13, the user can<br>
choose required courses that have been associated with a generated certification<br>
goal based on the certification, requirements of the authority. The user can select<br>
the required courses by marking a box, for example. As shown, the Certification<br>
Planner page presents various information and links associated with each course<br>
on the list, including course title, the institution presenting the course, course<br>
format (e.g., online, video, or other), course description/summary, etc. In<br>
addition, price information for taking the fisted courses. It should be noted that<br>
completing courses is just one example of certification goals that may be<br>
presented to the user in the Certification Planner page. As stated before, other<br>
examples include but are not limited to requiring the user to take a test, perform an<br>
act, complete a degree, fill out a form, etc.<br>
The Certification Planner page allows the user to create the certification<br>
plan by selecting one or more or all of the certification goals that'are to be<br>
included in the certification plan. As shown, a "Put In Plan" box is associated<br>
with each listed course allowing the user to include one or more selected courses<br>
in the certification plan by marking the box. It should noted that the user may or<br>
may not be required to purchase a course in order for it to be included in the<br>
certification plan.<br>
As explained above, the certification goal list may be generated based on<br>
priority filters. In the Certification Planner page illustrated in FIG. 13, for<br>
example, the courses are listed based on state requirements, state initiatives, and<br>
assessment information, with state requirements having the highest priority and<br>
assessment information having the lowest priority.<br><br><br>
Tracking Certification Plan<br>
FIG. 14 illustrates an exemplar)' Certification tracker page that presents<br>
the selected certification goals that are included in the user's personalized<br>
certification goal plan in terms of courses that need to be taken for certification.<br>
The page includes a "Plan Detail" section that lists the selected courses during the<br>
certification goal selection and planning process described in connection with<br>
FIG. 13. Another section of the Certification Plan page indicates how many units<br>
are needed, certification due date, and the number of units that are in the plan, in<br>
progress and completed. In this way, the page provides tracking information for<br>
completed courses, and shows how may units axe need to achieve certification.<br>
Accordingly, the system of the invention includes a tracker that is<br>
responsive to input relating to the completion of one or more selectable<br>
certification goals for updating the user certification plan. Depending upon user's<br>
progress status, the tracker can change the status in order to update the plan. As<br>
shown in FIG. 14, some of the selected courses are initially marked as "In Plan."<br>
The tracker can update the status by changing the status to "In Progress" or<br>
"Completed" as the user progresses with the certification plan.<br>
The tracker can update the certification plan based on a user input or a<br>
non-user, input. As such, the user may or may not be given control in updating the<br>
status of the certification plan. For example, if control is given to the user to<br>
update the certification plan, her or she can check the "Completed" box after<br>
having achieved a certification goal. As such, in one embodiment, the tracker<br>
updates the certification plan based on user input. In another embodiment, the<br>
tracker can update the certification plan automatically, based on status information<br>
received from a non-user, for example an entity that confirms the achievement of<br>
a certification goal by the user. For example, an educational institution can<br>
provide status information that confirms the user has completed a course required<br>
for achieving a certification goal. Either way, progress towards completing<br>
certification goals can be tracked based on input relating to completion or<br>
otherwise achievement of one or more of certification goals for updating the user<br>
certification plan.<br><br><br>
In another embodiment, the tracker transmits e-mails to the user in<br>
connection with the certification plan or with respect to one or more certification<br>
goals. The e-mails could be information e-mails, reminder e-mails, or alert e-mail<br>
automatically generated by the tracker based on user information profile, which<br>
includes information regarding the user's certification plan.<br>
Modifying and Updating Certification Plan<br>
Using the Certification Tracker page, the user can also review, update or<br>
otherwise modify the certification plan, for example, by adding, deleting<br>
certification goals. The updating process using the "Update Plan" link can be<br>
configured to accommodate those that are updating the entire certification plan<br>
versus those that are updating work done to date. A 'Take Needs Assessment"<br>
link allows the user to take steps assess needs in the field of endeavor. An "Add<br>
Certification Credit" link allows the user to enter certification credit. A<br>
"Certification Approval" link allows the user to a created certification plan to the<br>
certification authority for approval. Once approved, the system stores approval<br>
information in the user's profile.<br>
Certification Resources<br>
Certification resources are associated with certification goals. Although<br>
not necessary, more than one certification resource of the same or different type<br>
may be associated with one or more certification goals. For example, a<br>
certification goal requiring 15 hours of educational credit, may be associated with<br>
5 three-credit courses that may be taken in the same or different educational<br>
institution. Alternatively, such requirement may be fulfilled by a combination of<br>
courses, reading material, seminars, etc. The system of the present invention<br>
includes a certification resource generator that based on a certification goal input<br>
the provides associated certification resources.<br>
Certification resources comprise courses, programs, sessions, seminars,<br>
audio or video lectures, books, tests, forms, etc. A course comprises one or more<br>
lectures relating to a subject in the field of endeavor. A program is a series of<br>
courses constituting a curriculum. A program can be degreed or non-degreed.<br>
The course or program maybe live or self-paced taken on-line or off-line. Thus,<br><br><br>
various formats can be used in connection with the certification resources,<br>
including video, audio, live, on-line, off-line, self-paced, etc.<br>
The system of the present invention also includes an on-line module that<br>
allows the user to order, receive or register for resources associated with<br>
certification goals as appropriate. A "Register for Course" link can register the<br>
user for selected course(s), seminar(s), sessions, degree programs online. Upon<br>
completion of registered courses or programs, a user can use the tracker to update<br>
the certification plan. FIG. 15 shows an exemplary Certification Resource<br>
Registration page the user can use to register for or receive any one of resources<br>
necessary for achieving certification goals. In other instances, the certification<br>
goals can be met by various &amp;stance-Iearning systems, a video course program, a<br>
computer-based learning program, or other media format, all of which can be<br>
ordered, on line using the present invention.<br>
FIG. 16 shows an exemplary User Home page. This page provides various<br>
links to the user that allow for accessing various resources. The page include a<br>
"Plan Progress" section which presents user's progress summary of certification<br>
goals. A "My Plan" link allows the user to access the Certification Planner page<br>
described in connection with FIG. 14. Also, the user home page includes an alert<br>
section that provides certification alerts to the user.<br>
Another feature of the present invention includes an on-line grant module<br>
that allows the user to search and apply for grants from his or her user. A "Grant<br>
Search Link" allows the user to access an exemplary Grant Search page shown in<br>
FIG. 17. As shown, this page allows the user to search for grants. The search<br>
result presented to the user allows him or her to get a description of the grant as<br>
well as information regarding requirements for applying for the discovered grant.<br>
Corresponding "Apply" links allow the user to apply for a desired grant on line.<br>
The User Home page shown in FIG. 16 also provides links to news and<br>
events directed to certification requirements, for example, news regarding state<br>
certification in a professional field. This page, which can be personalized, gives<br>
the user information concerning their profession and certification needs. In<br>
addition, the user can obtain degree program materials that are related to<br>
certification process so that they can fulfill requirements necessary for their<br><br><br>
personalized certification plan. Additionally, supplementary reading material<br>
suggestions may be provided on this page.<br>
Also the page may provide links to discussion forums with a certification<br>
authority representative or any private or pubbc institution and agency that tracks<br>
certification requirements. This page can also provide links for obtaining<br>
certification forms and contact information, for example, the appropriate<br>
certification authority department, board or committee.<br>
