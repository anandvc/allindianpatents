THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br><br><br><br>
BAYER   AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,    a   German   company   of   D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br>
The application relates to moulding compositions prepared from specific quaternary<br>
ammonium salts of perfluoroalkylsulfonic acids and thermoplastics, which have an<br>
antistatic effect and are non-yellowing during processing.	,   .<br>
The fixation of dust with the formation of visual effects of dust is a widespread problem with plastic mouldings. In this context see, for example, Saechtling, Kunststoff-Taschenbuch, 26th edition, Hanser Verlag, 1995, Munich, p. 140 et seq. Dust deposits are a particular nuisance in transparent mouldings where they compromise function. Such mouldings are used, for example, for the optical data storage sector, in electrical , engineering and automotive construction, in the building construction sector, for containers for liquids or for other optical applications. The fixation of dust is undesirable in all these applications and may impair function.<br>
A known method of reducing the fixation of dust on plastic bodies is the use of antistatic agents. The literature describes antistatic agents for thermoplastics (see, for example, Gachter, Miiller, Plastic Additives, Hanser Verlag, Munich, 1996, p. 749 et seq.), which limit the fixation of dust. These antistatic agents improve the electrical conductivity of the plastic moulding compositions and in this manner dissipate surface charges which form during manufacture and use. Dust particles are consequently attracted to a lesser extent, and the fixation of dust is hence reduced.<br>
A distinction is generally made between internal and external antistatic agents. An external antistatic agent is applied to the plastic moulding after processing, an internal antistatic agent is added to the plastic moulding compositions as an additive. The use of internal antistatic agents is generally desirable for economic reasons, since no additional working steps are necessary for applying an antistatic agent after processing.<br>
Those internal antistatic agents for thermoplastics which have been described hitherto in the literature generally have one or more of the following disadvantages:<br><br><br>
•	breakdown of molecular weight of the thermoplastic<br>
•	effectiveness only at high concentrations (&gt;0.5%)<br>
•	turbidity in transparent thermoplastics<br>
«   insufficient effect to enable electrostatic discharge to take place, for example after injection moulding, and thus to avoid the fixation of dust<br>
•	discoloration.<br>
Sulfonic acid salts are a class of antistatic agents frequently described for use in thermoplastics. For example JP-06228420 A 940816 describes aliphatic sulfonic acid ammonium salts in polycarbonate as an antistatic agent. However, these compounds lead to breakdown of molecular weight.<br>
Quaternary ammonium salts of perfluoroalkylsulfonic acids are known, likewise the use thereof in thermoplastics, as in DE 2 506 726, for example. The latter application describes quaternary ammonium salts of perfluoroalkylsulfonic acids as mould release agents for polycarbonate. The examples described in that application, however, lead in polycarbonate to marked yellowing during processing, which is undesirable in particular for transparent and white-coloured formulations.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to provide antistatic agents having no negative influence on the material properties of plastics.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that certain perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid salts are particularly suitable as antistatic agents for the production of injection-moulded and extruded mouldings. Even with small quantities of perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid salt, mouldings can be produced on which there is no longer fixation of dust and yet which have none of those disadvantages of conventional antistatic agents mentioned at the outset.<br><br><br>
W0-trr78586!T<br><br>
,%£X!£¥Qm$845<br><br>
The present application therefore provides moulding compositions consisting of:<br>
•	at least one thermoplastic and<br>
•	at least one quaternary ammonium salt of a perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid of the type (I)<br>

2.	manufacture of translucent sheets, in particular of twin-wall sheets, for example for roofing structures such as railway stations, greenhouses and lighting installations; .<br>

The use of the plastic composition according to the invention is also attractive for the production of multi-layer systems. Here, the plastic composition according to the invention is applied in a thin layer to a moulded article of a plastic not equipped to be antistatic. It may be applied concurrently with moulding or directly after the moulding has been moulded, for example by coextrusion or sandwich moulding. However, it may also be applied to the finished basic body after moulding, for example by lamination with a film or by coating with a solution.<br>
Plastic compositions comprising perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid ammonium salts are preferably used for the production of light-diffusing discs for vehicles.<br>
The use of plastic compositions comprising perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid salts is also particularly attractive for the production of sheets, twin-wall sheets, coextruded sheets and films. Furthermore, the use of the perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid salts according to the invention is attractive in flame-retarded thermoplastic moulding compositions.<br>
The plastic mouldings equipped with the antistatic agents according to the invention have the advantage of no longer becoming electrostatically charged, for example, during production, during stripping of the conventionally used protective films or during transport and storage.<br><br><br>

The perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid ammonium salts according to the invention are particularly suitable for transparent formulations of thermoplastics, yet opaque formulations may also be equipped to be antistatic with the aid of these additives.<br>
The plastic compositions according to the invention can also be obtained by way of so-called master batches in which the desired additive composition is already pre-mixed. Then, in accordance with the desired composition of the plastic, only corresponding quantities of this master batch are added to the polycarbonate, for example during compounding or prior to injection moulding.<br>
The Examples which follow serve to explain the invention. The invention is not confined to the Examples. Percentages hereinbelow are by weight.<br>

Examples Dust test<br><br>
PQI/EF«703§45<br><br>
In order to investigate the fixation of dust in a laboratory test, the injection-moulded sheets are exposed to a fluidised dust atmosphere. For this purpose a 2-litre beaker having an 80 mm-long magnetic stirrer rod of triangular section is filled to a height of approximately 1 cm with dust (coal dust / 20 g activated carbon, Riedel-de Haen, Seelze, Germany, product No. 18003). The dust is fluidised with the aid of a magnetic stirrer. After the stirrer has stopped the test moulding is exposed to this dusty atmosphere for 7 seconds. Depending on the test moulding used, a greater or lesser amount of dust becomes deposited on the test mouldings.<br>
Evaluation of the fixation of dust (visual effects of dust) is visual. Sheets showing visual effects of dust received a negative (-) score, sheets virtually free of any visual effects of dust received a positive (+) score.<br>
Example 1<br>
6.25 g neopentylamine, 28 g tributylamine and 22 g DMF are introduced into a 500 ml three-necked flask. 40.8 g methyl iodide together with 14 ml DMF are added dropwise to this mixture, and stirring continues at room temperature for 12 hours.

Example 8: making the test mouldings<br>
In order to make the test mouldings, an additive-free, unstabilised polycarbonate (Makrolon® 2808 from Bayer AG, Leverkusen) of average molecular weight approximately 30 000 (Mw determined by GPC), solution viscosity: r\ = 1.293 at 290 to 300°C, is compounded in a twin-screw extruder with the quantity of sulfonic acid salts (according to Examples 2 to 7) indicated in Table 1 and the other additives indicated, and is then granulated.<br>
Rectangular sheets (155 mm x 75 mm x 2 mm) are then injection-moulded from this granular material at a material temperature of 300 or 320°C. The colour of the rectangular sheets is then compared visually with rectangular sheets not having the sulfonium salts according to the invention (Example 8.1), which have been made in parallel. Finally, the rectangular sheets undergo the dust test. The results are indicated in Table 2.<br><br><br>
