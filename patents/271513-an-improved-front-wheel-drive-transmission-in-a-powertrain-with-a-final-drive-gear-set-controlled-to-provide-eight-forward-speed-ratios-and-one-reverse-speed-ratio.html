				<td>8-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a power transmission in a front wheel drive<br>
configuration having three planetary gear sets, three external gear sets and a final drive gear<br>
set that are controlled by five torque-transmitting devices to provide eight forward speed ratios<br>
and one reverse speed ratio.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Passenger vehicles include a powertrain that is comprised of an engine, multi-<br>
speed transmission, and a differential or final drive. The multi-speed transmission increases<br>
the overall operating range of the vehicle by permitting the engine to operate through its torque<br>
range a number of times. The number of forward speed ratios that are available in the<br>
transmission determines the number of times the engine torque range is repeated. Early<br>
automatic transmissions had two speed ranges. This severely limited the overall speed range<br>
of the vehicle and therefore required a relatively large engine that could produce a wide speed<br>
and torque range. This resulted in the engine operating at a specific fuel consumption point<br>
during cruising, other than the most efficient point. Therefore, manually-shifted (countershaft<br>
transmissions) were the most popular.<br>
[0003]	With the advent of three- and four-speed automatic transmissions, the automatic<br>
shifting (planetary gear) transmission increased in popularity with the motoring public. These<br>
transmissions improved the operating performance and fuel economy of the vehicle. The<br>
increased number of speed ratios reduces the step size between ratios and therefore improves<br>
the shift quality of the transmission by making the ratio interchanges substantially<br>
imperceptible to the operator under normal vehicle acceleration.<br>
[0004]	Six-speed transmissions offer several advantages over four- and five-speed<br>
transmissions, including improved vehicle acceleration and improved fuel economy. While<br>
many trucks employ power transmissions having six or more forward speed ratios, passenger<br><br>
cars are still manufactured with three- and four-speed automatic transmissions and relatively<br>
few five- or six-speed devices due to the size and complexity of these transmissions.<br>
[0005]	Seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions provide further improvements in<br>
acceleration and fuel economy over six-speed transmissions. However, like the six-speed<br>
transmissions discussed above, the development of seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions<br>
has been precluded because of complexity, size and cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved transmission in a<br>
front wheel drive configuration having three planetary gear sets, three external gear sets and a<br>
final drive gear set controlled to provide eight forward speed ratios and one reverse speed<br>
ratio.<br>
[0007]	The transmission family of the present invention has three planetary gear se'ts<br>
positioned along first and second axes, wherein each planetary gear set includes a first, second<br>
and third member, which members may comprise a sun gear, a ring gear, or a planet carrier<br>
assembly member, in any order.<br>
[0008]	In referring to the first, second and third gear sets in this description and in the<br>
claims, these sets may be counted "first" to "third" in any order in the drawing (i.e., left to<br>
right, right to left, etc.). Additionally, the first, second or third members of each gear set may<br>
be counted "first" to "third" in any order in the drawing (i.e., top to bottom, bottom to top,<br>
etc.) for each gear set.<br>
[0009]	Each carrier member can be either a single-pinion carrier member (simple) or a<br>
double-pinion carrier member (compound). Embodiments with long pinions are also possible.<br>
[0010]	An interconnecting member continuously connects the third member of the<br>
second planetary gear set with the first member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0011]	Three external gear sets are positioned for transferring torque between the first<br>
and second axes, and each including first and second intermeshed external gears. A final drive<br>
external gear set is connected to an output member.<br><br>
[0012]	The input member is continuously connected with the second member of the<br>
first planetary gear set. The output member is continuously connected with the second external<br>
gear (driven gear) of the final drive external gear set.<br>
[0013]	A first torque-transmitting device, such as a brake, selectively connects the first<br>
member of the first planetary gear set with a stationary member (transmission housing/casing).<br>
[0014]	A second torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
first external gear of the third external gear set with the input member.<br>
[0015]	A third torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
second member of the second planetary gear set with the third member of the third planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0016]	A fourth torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
first external gear of the second external gear set with the first external gear of the third<br>
external gear set.<br>
[0017]	A fifth torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
second external gear of the first external gear set with the third member of the third planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0018]	The five torque-transmitting devices are selectively engageable in combinations<br>
of three to yield eight forward speed ratios and one reverse speed ratio.<br>
[0019]	A variety of speed ratios and ratio spreads can be realized by suitably selecting<br>
the tooth ratios of the planetary and external gear sets.<br>
[0020]	The above features and other features and advantages of the present invention<br>
are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out<br>
the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

[0024]	Referring to the drawings, there is shown in Figure la a powertrain 10 having a<br>
conventional engine and torque converter 12, a planetary transmission 14, and a conventional<br>
final drive mechanism 16. The engine 12 may be powered using various types of fuel to<br>
improve the efficiency and fuel economy of a particular application. Such fuels may include,<br>
for example, gasoline; diesel; ethanol; dimethyl ether; etc.<br>
[0025]	The front wheel drive planetary transmission 14 includes an input member 17<br>

axes 91, 93.<br>
[0030]	The final drive external gear set 62 includes the external drive gear 63 and the<br>
external driven gear 64.<br>
[0031]	The planetary gear arrangement also includes five torque-transmitting devices<br>
80, 82, 83, 84 and 85. The torque-transmitting device 80 is a stationary-type torque-<br>
transmitting device, commonly termed brake or reaction clutch. The torque-transmitting<br>
devices 82, 83, 84 and 85 are rotating-type torque-transmitting devices, commonly termed<br>
clutches.<br>
[0032]	The input member 17 is continuously connected with the planet carrier assembly<br>
member 26 of the planetary gear set 20. The output member 19 is continuously connected<br>
with the driven external gear 64 of the final drive gear set 62.<br>
[0033]	An interconnecting member 70 continuously connects the ring gear member 34<br>

[0035]	A first torque-transmitting device, such as brake 80, selectively connects the sun<br>
gear member 22 of the planetary gear set 20 with the transmission housing 90. A second<br>

[0036]	As shown in Figure 1b, and in particular the truth table disclosed therein, the<br>
torque-transmitting devices are selectively engaged in combinations of three to provide eight<br>
forward speed ratios and one reverse speed ratio, all with single transition sequential shifts and<br>
a double overdrive ratio.<br>
[0037]	As set forth above, the engagement schedule for the torque-transmitting devices<br>
is shown in the truth table of Figure 1b. The chart of Figure 1b describes the ratio steps that<br>
are attained in the above described transmission. For example, the step ratio between the first<br>
and second forward speed ratios is 1.50, while the step ratio between the reverse speed ratio<br>
and first forward ratio is -0.31.<br>
[0038]	Referring to Figure lc, the embodiment of powertrain 10 depicted in Fig. la is<br>
illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a schematic representation of the<br>
components of a mechanical device such as an automatic transmission. Each individual lever<br>
represents a planetary gearset, wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary<br>
gear are each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes: one for<br>
the sun gear member, one for the planet gear carrier member, and one for the ring gear<br>
member. The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the ring-<br>
to-sun ratio of each respective gearset. These lever ratios, in turn, are used to vary the gear<br>
ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios and ratio progression.<br>
Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the nodes of the various planetary gear sets<br>
are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and<br>
brakes are presented as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is<br>
grounded. Vertical dashed lines with a grounded pivot point represent external gear sets.<br>
Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be found in SAE<br><br>
Paper 810102, authored by Benford, Howard and Leising, Maurice, "The Lever Analogy: A<br>
New Tool in Transmission Analysis", 1981, which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0039]	The powertrain 10 includes an input member 17 continuously connected with the<br>
engine 12, an output member 19 continuously connected with the final drive mechanism 16, a<br>
first planetary gear set 20A having three nodes: a first node 22A, a second node 26A and a<br>
third node 24A; a second planetary gear set 30A having three nodes: a first node 32A, a<br>
second node 36A and a third node 34A; and a third planetary gear set 40A having three nodes:<br>
a first node 42A, a second node 46A and a third node 44A. The powertrain 10 also includes a<br>
first external gear set 50A having two external gears: a first external gear 51A and a second<br>
external gear 52A; a second external gear set 54A having two external gears: a first external<br>
gear 55A and a second external gear 56A; a third external gear set 58A having two external<br>
gears: a first external gear 59A and a second external gear 60A; and a final drive gear set 62A<br>
with two external gears: a external drive gear 63A and a external driven gear 64A.<br>
[0040]	The input member 17 is continuously connected with the node 26A. The output<br>
member 19 is continuously connected with the external gear 64A.<br>
[0041]	The node 34A is continuously connected with the node 42A via interconnecting<br>
member 70.<br>
[0042]	A first torque-transmitting device, such as brake 80, selectively connects the<br>
node 22A with the transmission housing 90. A second torque-transmitting device, such as<br>
clutch 82, selectively connects the external gear 59A with the input member 17. A third<br>
torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 83, selectively connects the node 36A with the node<br>
44A. A fourth torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 84, selectively connects the external<br>
gear 55A with the external gear 59A. A fifth torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 85,<br>
selectively connects the external gear 52A with the node 44A.<br>
[0043]	To establish ratios, three torque-transmitting devices are engaged for each gear<br>
state. The engaged torque-transmitting devices are represented by an "X" in each respective<br>
row of Fig. lb. For example, to establish reverse gear, the brake 80 and clutches 83, 85 are<br>
engaged. The brake 80 engages the node 22A with the transmission housing 90. The clutch<br>
83 engages the node 36A with the node 44A. The clutch 85 engages the external gear 52A<br><br>
with the node 44A. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved through different<br>
combinations of clutch engagement as per Figure lb.<br>
[0044]	The powertrain 10 may share components with a hybrid vehicle, and such a<br>
combination may be operable in a "charge-depleting mode". For purposes of the present<br>
invention, a "charge-depleting mode" is a mode wherein the vehicle is powered primarily by an<br>
electric motor/generator such that a battery is depleted or nearly depleted when the vehicle<br>
reaches its destination. In other words, during the charge-depleting mode, the engine 12 is only<br>
operated to the extent necessary to ensure that the battery is not depleted before the destination is<br>
reached. A conventional hybrid vehicle operates in a "charge-sustaining mode", wherein if the<br>
battery charge level drops below a predetermined level (e.g., 25%) the engine is automatically<br>
run to recharge the battery. Therefore, by operating in a charge-depleting mode, the hybrid<br>
vehicle can conserve some or all of the fuel that would otherwise be expended to maintain the<br>
25% battery charge level in a conventional hybrid vehicle. It should be appreciated that a hybrid<br>
vehicle powertrain is preferably only operated in the charge-depleting mode if the battery can be<br>
recharged after the destination is reached by plugging it into an energy source.<br>
[0045]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in<br>
detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
