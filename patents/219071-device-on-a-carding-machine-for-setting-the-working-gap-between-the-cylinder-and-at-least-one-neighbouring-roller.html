				<td>Device on a carding machine for setting the working gap<br>
between the cylinder and at least one neighbouring roller<br>
The invention relates to a device on a carding<br>
machine for setting the working gap between the cylinder<br>
and at least one neighbouring roller, which cooperate with<br>
one another with a small gap between their cylindrical<br>
surfaces (working gap) at the fibre transfer points and in<br>
which the working gap is readjustable to a pre-determined<br>
value as a result of changes in dimensions caused by<br>
thermal expansion and/or centrifugal forces.<br>
During carding, increasingly large amounts of fibre<br>
material are processed per unit of time, which requires<br>
higher working component speeds and higher performance.<br>
The increasing throughput of fibre material (production<br>
rate), even when the working surface area remains<br>
constant, results in increased generation of heat as a<br>
result of the mechanical work. At the same time, however,<br>
the technological carding result (sliver uniformity,<br>
degree of cleaning, nep reduction etc.) is constantly<br>
being improved, which requires a greater number of<br>
effective surfaces in carding engagement and narrower<br>
settings of those effective surfaces, e.g. fixed card tops<br>
and/or revolving card tops, with respect to the cylinder<br>
(tambour). The proportion of synthetic fibres being<br>
processed, which - compared with cotton - generate more<br>
heat as a result of friction when in contact with the<br>
effective surfaces (clothings) of the machine, is<br>
continually increasing. The working components of high<br>
performance carding machines are nowadays totally enclosed<br>
on all sides in order to conform to the high safety<br>
standards, to prevent the emission of particles into the<br>
spinning room environment and to minimise the need for<br>
servicing of the machines. Grids or even open, material-<br>
guiding surfaces allowing exchange of air are largely a<br>
thing of the past. The said circumstances markedly<br>
increase the input of heat into the machine, while the<br>
discharge" of heat by means of convection is markedly<br>
reduced. The resulting more intense heating of high<br>
performance carding machines leads to greater<br>
thermoelastic deformation which, on account of the non-<br>
uniform distribution of the temperature field, affects the<br>
set spacings of the effective surfaces: the gaps between<br>
cylinder and card top, doffer, fixed card tops and<br>
separation points are reduced. In an extreme case, the set<br>
gap between the effective surfaces can be completely<br>
consumed by thermal expansion, so that components moving<br>
relative to one another collide, resulting in considerable<br>
damage to the affected high performance carding machine.<br>
Accordingly, particularly the generation of heat in the<br>
working region of the carding machine can lead to<br>
different degrees of thermal expansion when the tempera-<br>
ture differences between the components are too great.<br>
Carding gaps and roller spacings on a carding machine<br>
are extraordinarily important. The carding quality stands<br>
or falls with the exact setting of those gaps (roller<br>
gaps). Under the action of heat, the rollers expand and<br>
the gaps change. In addition to expansion of the rollers<br>
caused by centrifugal force, which greatly changes the<br>
gaps, a high production rate and carding-intensive<br>
synthetic fibres additionally give rise to intense heating<br>
of the rollers. Thermally induced changes in the<br>
dimensions of the rollers occur. In order to achieve<br>
optimum carding quality it is necessary for the roller<br>
spacings to remain constant during operation. "Constant"<br>
means in this context that the change in spacing should be<br>
preferably less than 0.01 mm.<br>
In a known device (DE 29 48 825), in a carding<br>
machine having at least two cooperating rollers the gap<br>
between the two rollers is changed in order to compensate<br>
for heating. This change is effected by means of<br>
additional mechanical displacement elements which are so<br>
constructed that they are able to change the spacing of<br>
the axes of the rollers in accordance with the prevailing<br>
temperature. For that purpose, the stationary framework of<br>
the carding machine is in the form of a frame having four<br>
supports (only two are shown) and having two horizontal<br>
longitudinal bars (only one is shown). The two<br>
longitudinal bars and the supports are joined together by<br>
crossbars (not shown) to form a stable, rigid support<br>
frame for two rotating rollers (cylinder and doffer) which<br>
are equipped with pointed clothing and operate a short<br>
distance a apart. The cylinder is fixedly mounted so as to<br>
be rotatable about its axis by means of two bearings (of<br>
which only one is shown) which are tightly screwed to the<br>
longitudinal bars by means of screws, and is driven and<br>
rotated. The doffer is likewise mounted so as to be<br>
rotatable about its axis by means of two bearings (only<br>
one is shown) on the longitudinal bars of the framework.<br>
The bearings for the doffer are not, however, tightly<br>
screwed to longitudinal bars but are each guided by means<br>
of two collar screws so that they are displaceable<br>
parallel to the axis by a small amount of the order of 1<br>
to 2 mm. For that purpose, slot openings are provided in<br>
the bearings for the projecting screws, which allow exact<br>
lateral guidance of the bearings while ensuring their<br>
displaceability in the longitudinal direction. By parallel<br>
displacement of the bearings in the slot openings, the gap<br>
between the cylindrical surfaces of the two rollers can be<br>
varied. For that purpose, the machinery framework is<br>
provided on each of its longitudinal bars with a fixed<br>
stop for adjusting devices (displacement elements) which<br>
are inserted between the fixed stop and the bearing of the<br>
doffer. The adjusting devices are capable of determining<br>
the position of their corresponding bearing in respect of that of the fixed bearing<br>
for the cylinder. A disadvantage of this device is the structural complexity.<br>
Additional separate mechanica! adjusting elements are required for displacement.<br>
A particular shortcoming is that the bearings of the high-speed doffer are<br>
displaceably arranged. In addition to the apparatus-related expense for ttve.<br>
displacement elements on the bearings, the fact that the bearing arrangement<br>
for the heavy doffer roller is not completely rigid is a particular disadvantage.<br>
Displacement of the doffer that is only very slightly unequal results in a non-<br>
uniform roller gap and can lead to the destruction of the machine. In the known<br>
device, in every case the bearings of the doffer have to be loosened for<br>
adjustment and then fixed again.<br>
US 4384398 provides the working conditions between two rotating cylinders<br>
(4,5) which are provided with a point clothing (9, 19) and are processing or<br>
mutually transferring a fibre web, of a processing machine of the staple fibre<br>
spinning plant are always maintained on a predetermined value by adapting the<br>
distance between the surfaces of the two cylinders (4, 5). For this purpose<br>
moving means (21) are used, which permit very precise setting of the distance<br>
between the rotational axes (8, 14) of the two cylinders (4,5) and which are<br>
controlled by control means (22)- To control means (22) the measuring signal of<br>
a characteristic directly connected with the dismeter of one of the cylinders (4 or<br>
5), as scanned by a measuring element (25), is transmitted, and the control<br>
means (22) control the moving elements (21) in function of this Characteristic.<br>
Thus complete elimination of the disturbing influences of the centrifugal force<br>
and of the increase in temperature of the cylinders onto the working condition is<br>
achieved.<br>
The invention accordingly relates to the problem of providing a device of the kind<br>
described at the beginning which avoids the mentioned disadvantages, which has<br>
an especially simple structure and enables a predetermined spacing between<br>
neighbouring rollers to be set in a simple manner in the event of changes in the<br>
dimensions of the rollers.<br>
This problem is solved by the features of the invention.<br>
As a result of the features according to the Invention it is possible in a simple<br>
manner to maintain<br>
constant roller scacings in carding machines under the action of heat The<br>
machinery framework is partitioned thermally in such a manner that the cylinder<br>
is raised by heating of its supports, which are "insulted" from the remainder of<br>
the framework. On so doing, the gap between the cylinder and at least one<br>
neighbouring roller, for example licker-in and/or doffer, is changed. In this way,<br>
compensation of the roller diameter changed by the change in temperature is<br>
realized in a specific manner and with a low heat output. Special further<br>
advantages are that separate adjusting elements for the displacement of a roller<br>
and the mechanical and fibre-technological problems associated with roller<br>
displacement are completely avoided. The roller gap can be made to track a<br>
change in temperature automatically, without the need to loosen, displace and<br>
then fix a bearing for a roller on the framework. The bearings of the rollers<br>
remain rigidly connected to the framework.<br>
The advantageous developments of the invention are described in the<br>
subsequent paragraphs.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail below with reference to embodiments<br>
shown in the accompanying drawings.<br>

the rollers are indicated by curved arrows. M denotes the<br>
centre point (of the axis or shaft) of the cylinder 4.<br>
Between licker-in 3 and card top guide roller 3a there are<br>
working elements, for example fixed carding segments 17,<br>
and between doffer 5 and card top guide roller 13b there<br>
are working elements, for example fixed carding elements<br>
18. Reference numeral 19 denotes the cylinder covering<br>
(cylinder cover elements); reference numeral 20 denotes<br>
the licker-in covering (cover elements) and reference<br>
numeral 21 denotes the doffer covering (cover elements).<br>
The cylinder 4 is provided with clothing 4a; the licker-in<br>
33 is provided with clothing 3a and the doffer 5 is<br>
provided with clothing 5a. Reference letter A denotes the<br>
working direction. The carding machine is fully enclosed<br>
by a machinery housing 34, especially made of sheet metal<br>
with doors, flaps and the like.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a portion of the cylinder 4 having a<br>
cylindrical surface 4f of the casing 4e and cylinder bases<br>
4c, 4d (radial support elements). The surface 4f is<br>
provided with clothing 4a, which in this example is in the<br>
form of wire having sawteeth. The sawtooth wire is wound<br>
on the cylinder 4, that is to say is wound around it in<br>
closely adjacent turns between side flanges (not shown) in<br>
order to form a cylindrical working surface eguipped with<br>
points. On the working surface, fibres should be processed<br>
as uniformly as possible. The carding work is performed<br>
between the opposing clothings. It is influenced<br>
essentially by the position of the one clothing relative<br>
to the other and by the clothing gap a between the tips of<br>
the teeth of the two clothings. The working width of the<br>
cylinder 4 is a determining factor for all other working<br>
elements of the carding machine, especially for the<br>
revolving card top 14 or fixed card tops, which, together<br>
with the cylinder 4, card the fibres uniformly over the<br>
entire working width. In order that uniform carding work<br>
can be performed over the entire working width, the<br>
settings of the working elements (including additional<br>
elements) must be adhered to over that working width. The<br>
cylinder 4 itself can, however, be deformed by the<br>
winding-on of the clothing wire, by centrifugal force or<br>
by heating arising as a result of the carding process. The<br>
shaft 22 of the cylinder 4 is rotatably mounted in<br>
bearings 26a, 26b (see Fig. 5a, 5b) which are mounted on<br>
the fixed machinery framework 23a, 23b. The diameter, for<br>
example 1250 mm, of the cylindrical surface 4f, that is to<br>
say twice the radius r3, is an important dimension of the<br>
machine and is increased by the working heat during<br>
operation. The side panels 24a, 24b are mounted on the two<br>
machinery frameworks 23a, 23b, respectively. The two<br>
flexible bends 25a, 25b are mounted on the side panels<br>
24a, 24b, respectively.<br>
The rollers shown in. Fig. 3 arranged immediately<br>
adjacent to the cylinder 4 and co-operating therewith, the<br>
licker-in 33 and the doffer 5, are constructed and clothed<br>
in substantially the same way as the cylinder 4, so that<br>
the comments made above in connection with the cylinder 4<br>
in the description of Fig. 2 apply in corresponding<br>
manner. Between the points of the clothing 4a of the<br>
cylinder 4 on the one hand and between the points of the<br>
clothing 3a of the licker-in 33 there is a roller gap a.<br>
Between the points of the clothing 4a of the cylinder 4,<br>
and on the other hand, and between the points 5a of the<br>
doffer there is further a roller gap b. When, during<br>
operation, heat is generated in the carding gap by the<br>
carding work, especially in the case of a high production<br>
rate and/or the processing of synthetic fibres or<br>
cotton/synthetic fibre mixtures, the cylinder casing 4e is<br>
expanded, that is to say the radius r3 increases and the<br>
roller gaps a and b become smaller. The heat is conducted<br>
by way of the cylinder casing 4e into the radial<br>
supporting elements, the cylinder bases 4c and 4d. The<br>
cylinder bases 4c, 4d likewise expand as a result, that is<br>
to say the radius r3 (Fig. 2) increases- The cylinder 4 is<br>
virtually fully enclosed (encased) on all sides: In the<br>
radial direction by the elements 14, 17, 18, 19 (see Fig.<br>
1) and to both sides of the carding machine by the<br>
elements 23a, 23b; 24a, 24b; 25a, 25b. The machinery<br>
housing 34 comes in addition. As a result of the increase<br>
in the diameter of the cylinder 4 caused by thermal and/or<br>
centrifugal force expansion, the roller gaps a and b<br>
become smaller. As a result of the features according to<br>
the invention, the roller gaps a and b are increased again<br>
to the distances required for optimum carding. The roller<br>
gaps between the surfaces, or clothings, of neighbouring<br>
rollers are thus set or readjusted.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the framework wall 23a on one side of<br>
the carding machine; the framework wall 23b (see Fig. 2)<br>
on the other side of the carding machine is basically of<br>
the same structure. The framework wall 23a - preferably<br>
made of sheet steel - consists of a framework wall 231 for<br>
the fibre feed, especially for mounting the feed device<br>
(feed roller 1, feed table 2) and the lickers-in 31 to 33,<br>
and of a framework wall 233 for mounting the fibre take-<br>
off elements, especially the doffer 5. On the upper<br>
crossmembers of the framework walls 231 and 233 there are<br>
fixedly mounted inter alia the pivot bearing 27a for the<br>
licker-in 33 and the pivot bearing 28a for the doffer 5.<br>
Between the framework walls 231 and 233 there is located a<br>
framework wall 232 for mounting the cylinder 4. The<br>
framework wall 232 consists of two vertical support struts<br>
23" and 23"" which are joined to one another at their<br>
upper end by a horizontal crossmember 23""". On the<br>
crossmember 23""" there is fixedly mounted the pivot<br>
bearing 26a for the shaft 22 of the cylinder 4. The<br>
framework walls 231, 232 and 233 are joined to one another,<br>
for example by welding. The support struts 23" and 23""<br>
and the crossmember 23""" project above the upper boundary<br>
of the framework walls 231 and 233.<br>
In each of the support struts 23", 23"" (support<br>
columns), a heating rod 291, 292, respectively, is so<br>
arranged that the support struts 23" and 23"" can be<br>
expanded or contracted in their longitudinal direction<br>
(that is to say in the vertical direction according to<br>
Fig. 4). The heating elements 291 and 292 are preferably<br>
arranged in the regions of the support struts 23" and 23""<br>
that project above the framework walls 231 and 233, because<br>
in those regions - irrespective of the welded bonds - free<br>
expansion is possible. The expansion of the support<br>
columns 23" and 23"" is only small and takes place<br>
exclusively within the material of the support struts 23"<br>
and 23"".<br>
According to Fig. 5a, before the carding machines are<br>
started into operation, for example at room temperature,<br>
there is a gap a between the cylinder 4 and the licker-in<br>
33 on the one hand and a gap b between the cylinder 4 and<br>
the doffer 5 on the other hand, for example in each case<br>
8/1000". During operation of the carding machine, after<br>
the machinery, especially the rollers, has undergone<br>
heating, according to Fig. 5a the gaps between cylinder 4<br>
and licker-in 33 and between cylinder 4 and doffer 5 have<br>
been reduced to a1 and b1 respectively, for example in<br>
each case 2/1000". By means of the heating rods 291 and<br>
292 shown in Fig. 2 and 4 (and - in a manner not shown -<br>
by means of the heating rods 293 and 294 in the support<br>
struts of the framework wall for the cylinder 4 in the<br>
framework wall 23b on the other side of the carding<br>
machine) the support struts 23" and 23"" are expanded in<br>
the vertical direction. As a result, the crossmember<br>
23""", the bearing 26a (and the bearing 26b not shown) and<br>
the axis 22 with the cylinder 4 are likewise raised<br>
upwards in the vertical direction. In this way the<br>
distance c1 between the machinery or framework base and<br>
the centre point M of the shaft 22 (Fig. 5a) is increased<br>
to the distance C2 (Fig. 5b). At the same time, the gaps<br>
a1 and b1 are increased to the gaps a2 and b2, respectively<br>
(see Fig. 5b), which can be determined by geometric<br>
calculation. The distances e1 and d1 between the machinery<br>
or framework base and the centre point of the shaft of the<br>
doffer 5 and the centre point of the shaft of the licker-<br>
in 33 remain the same.<br>
T1 = temperature cylinder 4, licker-in 33, doffer 5<br>
T2 = temperature side panels 24a, 24b<br>
T3 = temperature framework 23<br>
The temperature increases from the level of the<br>
rollers by way of the side panels as far as the machinery<br>
framework. In accordance with the invention, compensation<br>
for changes in the dimensions of the rollers is realised<br>
in a specific manner and with a low heat output.<br>
The machinery framework 23 is so partitioned<br>
thermally that the cylinder 4 is raised by heating of its<br>
supports 23", 23"", which are "insulated" from the<br>
remainder of the frame, measurements being taken of e.g.<br>
the cylinder temperature (Tl) and the framework temperature<br>
(T3). The temperature (T4) to be set can then be<br>
determined by means of a simple calculation (Da = R x a x<br>
DT). The spacings a, b of the rollers can be kept constant<br>
by controlling (see Fig. 6) the temperature T4. By raising<br>
T4, the columns 23", 23"" (support struts) become longer<br>
and the cylinder 4 is raised relative to the remainder of<br>
the framework. Depending upon the angle (a) and the<br>
temperature (T4), the greater thermal expansi-on of the<br>
rollers relative to the framework is compensated.<br>
The heating of the support struts 23", 23"" (columns)<br>
can advantageously be effected using commercially<br>
available apparatus (heating rod 29).<br>
The gaps between neighbouring rollers or between<br>
their clothing surfaces can be determined, for example, in<br>
the manner described in DE-A-39 13 996.<br>
According to Fig. 6, for setting or readjusting the<br>
working gaps a and b there is provided an electronic<br>
