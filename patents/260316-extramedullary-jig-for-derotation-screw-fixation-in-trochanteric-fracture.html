THE    FOLLOWING    SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE  NATURE OF THIS<br>
INVENTION   AND   THE   MANNER   IN<br>
WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED<br><br>
1 MAR 2005<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a jig, particularly for use in additional screw fixation in fractures.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Jigs are known in the art for drilling holes for screw fixation in orthopaedic fractures. US Patent No. US3814089 entitled a drill jig for total hip prosthesis discloses a fixation of the femoral prosthesis member in the femur in performing hip prosthesis surgery, and the jig structure used in performing such fixation, wherein a jig comprising an elongated leg member having plural drill guide holes is releasably secured to the shank of the prosthesis member so that the drill guide holes align precisely with fastener openings in the prosthesis shank. When the assembled prosthesis member and jig are in proper position relative to the femur, a drill bit is passed through the jig holes to drill holes through the cortex of the femur to receive fixation fasteners. An additional guide sleeve may be passed through such holes to guide a smaller drill bit for drilling holes in the femur beyond the prosthesis shank.<br>
However, the jig described in the US patent is for replacement surgery, however, the jig may not be used for screw fixation of the Trochanteric fractures.<br>
However, in trochanteric fractures, Richard's screw and plate fixation is generally done to repair the fractures. Especially, in trochanteric fractures, the screw has to pass through the neck of the femur and it is usually difficult to pass a screw through a narrow passage. Further, during the surgery, first a thick screw of usually 13 mm is passed.    In conditions<br><br>
where the fracture is unstable, an additional screw fixation is done. Generally, 6.5 mm screw placement is most preferred which has to be in substantially parallel position to the first 13 mm screw. Besides, as the head of the trochanter is narrow, it is difficult to locate substantially parallel position to the existing 13 mm screw. Further, as the additional screw fixation is done by free hand technique, even if there is a little deviation in passing the additional 6.5 mm screw results in repetition of screw placement in the neck of the femur.<br>
Therefore, locating substantially a parallel position in additional screw fixation particularly in trochanteric fracture is time consuming. Presently, image intensifier is used to confirm the additional 6.5 mm screw placement. However, small hospitals where image intensifier machine is unavailable, the surgery is time consuming and the surgeon has to assess the parallel position to fix the additional screw. This in turn will require more anesthesia to be given to the patient undergoing surgery that may lead to morbidity and mortality rate in older patients. It is also known that trochanteric fractures are common in elderly patients due to osteoporosis or other related conditions.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a jig for derotation screw fixation in trochanteric fractures and a method for the fixation of guide wire for fixing an additional 6.5 mm c.c. screw through said jig.<br>
A jig for derotation screw fixation in orthopaedic fractures according to the present invention has a handle and a body attached to the handle, said body has a barrel for mounting on a pre-fixed screw shaft; and a knob<br><br>
having plurality of holes positioned parallel to said barrel for placing a guide wire through the jig parallel to the first screw. The barrel is positioned at a right angle position to the body. The barrel holds the shaft of the first placed screw. In trochanteric fractures, Richard's screw is the first placed screw. Therefore, the barrel according to the present invention holds the shaft of the Richard's screw.<br>
The body having the barrel and the knob having plurality of holes is preferably positioned at an angle 125 to 130 ° from the handle.<br>
The jig according to the present invention is made of stainless steel.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for fixing an additional screw using the Jig of the present invention, said method comprising the steps of: fixing the first screw in the posterior aspect of the neck of the femur; mounting the barrel of jig of the present invention over the shaft of the first screw; selecting a hole in the knob of the jig; placing a guide wire 6.5 mm c.c. screw; removing the jig;<br>
drilling and tapping over the guide wire; and fixing the said second screw.<br>
The first screw according to the present invention is Richard's screw of 13 mm diameter. The second screw according to the present invention is of 6.5 mm diameter which is canulated.<br>
The Jig of the present invention solves the problem of free hand techniques. Further, the time required by the surgeon to fix the additional second screw is considerably reduced, thereby reducing the surgery time. The Jig of the present invention makes it possible to fix an additional screw exactly parallel to the first Richard's screw which is first fixed.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
Fig 1. shows the plan view of the jig of the present invention.<br>
Fig 2. shows the side view of the jig of the present invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a jig for derotation screw fixation in trochanteric fracture and a method for fixing said screw thereof.<br>
The jig (10) of the present invention as shown in figures 1 and 2 comprises a handle (12) and a body (16) joined by a neck (14). The handle is "U" shaped having two arms (28a and 28b) to make it convenient for a surgeon to hold the jig. However, the shape of the handle may be varied according to the need and convenience as arrived by a person skilled in the art. The handle is bent to form a neck (14).<br>
The neck (14) attaches the body (16) and the handle (12). The body (16) is bent to an angle 125 ° to 130 ° from the handle (12) by the neck (14). This makes the placement of the jig on the first screw and the movement of the jig easier.<br>
The body (16) has a barrel (18) for holding the first screw (not shown in figure). The jig (10) can be rotated by barrel (18) holding the first screw. The barrel (18) is preferably positioned at right angle to the body (16) of the jig (10).<br>
The knob (22) of the present invention has plurality of holes (24) positioned parallel to the position of the barrel. The holes (24) allow the passage of guide wire (not shown in figure) through to mark the location where the second screw (not shown in figure) has to be fixed.<br><br>
The jig (10) according to the present invention is made with a metal, preferably, stainless steel.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for fixing an additional screw in trochanteric fractures. The method includes the steps of fixing the first screw in the posterior aspect of the neck of the femur; mounting the barrel of jig of the present invention over the shaft of the first screw; selecting a hole in the knob of the jig; placing a guide wire of desired diameter second screw; removing the jig;<br>
drilling and tapping over the guide wire; and fixing the said second screw.<br>
The jig of the present invention makes it much easier the fixing of additional screw to a trochanteric fracture. The jig of the present invention uses the shaft of the Richard's screw fixed in the first position to mark the second position for the placement of additional screw with the help of the knob having plurality of holes. The second position for placing an additional screw is usually a parallel position to the first Richard's screw.<br>
The present invention is advantageous in that it reduces the effort and time that a surgeon should take for fixing an additional screw by hand held technique by eliminating the need for repetition of the screw fixation procedure as in cases of free hand techniques.<br>
The present invention describes the use of jig in the trochanteric fracture, however, other applications and advantages of the invention may be arrived at by a person skilled in the art from the drawings and the description of the invention.<br><br>
