OVERHEAD GUAJID FOR MATERIALS HANDLING VEHICLE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates in general to materials handling vehicles, and more particularly to overhead guards for materials handling vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND ART Vehicle operator overhead guards are common devices found on a wide variety of material handling vehicles such as fork lift trucks. The overhead guard provides a barrier between the vehicle operator and objects that may free fall from positions located above the operator. Such falling objects may result for example, firom unstable objects in a rack, bin, slack OT othei location in the work area proximate to and above the vehicle operator.<br>
In a typical warehouse or distribution center, palletized stock items ate stored in bins, racks or other storage structures that are aligned fo each side of generally long, parallel extending aisles. To maximize available space, it is not uncommon for several storage structures to be vertically stacked, such that stock may be stored at heights up to 7 meters or more. Accordmgly, an operator of a materials handling vehicle that is retrieving and/or putting away stock may be required to look upward from an operating position of the vehicle towards the mast to properly identify the proper height of the forks for stock to be retrieved or put away. However, a conventional overhead guard is spaced horizontally over the operator and extends towards the mast to provide a barrier between falling objects and the operator. The conventional overhead guard thus invariably limits the visibility of the operator when trying to view the raised forks of the vehicle.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, an overhead guard for a materials handling vehicle comprises a guard frame and at least one guard member supported by the guard frame. The guard frame is coupled to a support structure, such as one or more support posts extending from a vehicle chassis or from a mast of the vehicle, so as to extend generally over at least a portion of an operator's compartment of the vehicle. Moreover, the guard frame is oriented at an angle at least in an area of the overiiead guard situated forward of a normal vehicle operating position towards a load handling assembly of the vehicle, where the<br><br>
angle has a magnitude that is at least five degrees relative to horizoiital Qireciea upward towards the load handling assembly.<br>
The guard frame may comprise, for example, llrst and second longitudinal frame members coupled together by at least one lateral frame member. Al least one guard member, such as a bar, spans or otherwise extends in an area between the first and second longitudinal frame members. Each bar is oriented at an angle relative to the first and second longitudinal frame members so as to improve visibility through the overhead guard from a vantage point corresponding to a normal vehicle operating position, in addition to, or in lieu of bars, the guard member(s) may also be defmed by a plate or other suitable stmcture capable of providing a barrier across or otherwise between the frame members. The plate may incorporate or otherwise be provided in addition to slots or other openings that allow visibility through the overhead guard.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, a materials handling vehicle comprises an operator's compartment, a load handling assembly and an overhead guard. The operator's compartment has a first lateral sidewall, a first longitudinal sidewalL and a second longitudinal sidewall. The load handling assembly is positioned adjacent to the first lateral side wall of the operator's compartment, and may include, for example, a mast and a pair of forks controllable to traverse up and down along at least a portion of the mast.<br>

guard frame is coupled to a suitable support structure so as to extend generally over at least a portion of the operator's compartment of the vehicle. For example, the guard frame may couple to a vehicle chassis by one or more support posts. In this configuration, each support post may extend from any suitable support location of the vehicle. In addition to, or in lieu of support posts, the guard frame may couple to the mast or other support member of the vehicle. Moreover, the guard frame is oriented at an angle at least in an area of the overhead guard situated forward of a normal vehicle operating position towards the load handling assembly of the vehicle, the angle having a magnitude that is at least five degrees relative to horizontal directed upward towards the load handling assembly.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the present invention, an overhead guard comprises a guard frame having first and second longitudinal frame members and at least one lateral<br><br>
frame member that couples the first and second longitudinal frame members. The overhead guard is coupled to a support structure of a materials handling vehicle so as to extend generally over at least a portion of an operator's compartment of the vehicle such that the First and second longitudinal frame members are oriented at an angle at least in an area of the overhead guard situated forward of a normal vehicle operating position towards a load handling assembly of the vehicle, where the angle has a magnitude that is at least five degrees relative to horizontal directed upward towards the load handling assembly. The overhead guard further comprises a plurality of guard bars that span between the first and second longitudinal frame members, wheteiit a distance between each of the guard members is selected based upon the angle of the first and second frame members so that a horizontal distance between adjacent guard members does not exceed a predetermined distance, e.g., six inches.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION In the following detailed description of the illustrated embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration, and not by way of limitation, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of various embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, and particularly to Figs. 1 and 2, a materials handling vehicle 10. which is illustrated as a rider reach truck, includes a load handling assembly 12 positioned generally towards a first end section 14 of the vehicle 10 and a power unit 16 positioned generally towards a second end section 18 of the vehicle 10, The power unit 16 includes an operator's compartment 20, a steered wheel 22 positioned generally beneath the operator's compaTtment 20, a pair of outriggers 24 that extend from the power unit 16 in a longitudinal direction towards the first end section 14 of the vehicle 10 so as to flank either side of the load handling asscrably 12 aad a pau uf fiuiii WIICCLS 26, one wheei 26 coupied to each outrigger 24.<br>
The operator's compartment 20 is defined by a volume within a chassis 28 that includes generally, a first longituduial sidewall 30, a second longitudinal sidewall 32, a first lateral sidewall 34 towards the first end section 14 of the vehicle 10 generally adjacent to load handling assembly 12 and a second lateral sidewall 36 towards the second end section 18 of the vehicle 10. As illustrated, the operator's compartment 20 provides substantially open access thereto, e.g., via an opening 38 through the second lateral sidewall 36 of the operator's compartment 20, which allows for unimpeded ingress and egress to the operator's compartment 20,<br><br>
The load handling assembly 12 includes a mast 42 that extends generally vertical from the power unit 16, a fork carriage mechanism 44 supported by the mast 42 and a pair of forks 46 that are carried by the fork carriage mechanism 44, The illustrated mast 42 includes a pair of mast rails 48 defining an offset, wide view mast assembly, which allows a relatively wide visibility window between the pair of mast rails 48, and allows visibility to both the outriggers 24 and the forks 46. However, depending upon the vehicle 10 and the intended applications, the load handling assembly 12 may be implemented by different mast and fork arrangements or other load handling structures altogether.<br>
The vehicle i 0 lurther comprises a motor compartment 50, which may be located, for example, underneath and-'or outside of the operator's compartment 20. The motor compartment 50 houses necessary motors and drive devices (not shown), such as a traction motor provided to drive the steered wheel 22, and one or more hydraulics pump motors, which are provided to power hydraulic functions of the vehicle 10. The various motors and drive devices may alternatively be positioned in separate compartments within or about the power imit 16.<br>
With reference to Fig. 3, the operator's compartment 20 defines an operator's area from which an operator may drive the vehicle 10 and control the load handling and other work operative features of the vehicle 10, An operator's station is defined within the operator's compartment, e.g., comprising an operator's seat 56 and a plurality of work upeititivc cuuiiuii 58 thai aie piuvijcd ia ciosc pioAimiiy iu uiie another such thai the an operator can reach and operate the work operative controls 58 while in a seated position on the operator's seat 56. Thus, a seated operator assumes a normal vehicle operating position at the operator's station and can readily operate the vehicle, e.g., by operating the work operative controls 58 for controlling navigation and/or acceleration of the vehicle 10, operating the work operative implements and features of the vehicle 10, e.g., by controlling the height of the forks 46, the fork extension, fork tilt and/or side-shift, and/or by operating other features related to the vehicle 10 or to the performance of specific tasks associated with the vehicle ! 0. As illustrated, the operator's seat 56 Is set inside the operator's compartment 20 on the right hand side when facing the second lateral sidewalj 36 from outside the vehicle 10. Moreover, the operator's seat 56 is spaced along the second longitudinal wall by a predetermined distance from rhe second lateral sidewall 36, i.e., towards ihe first lateral sidewall 34.<br><br>
The illustrated operator's seat 56 includes a base structure 60, an intennedjate member 62. a seat bottom 64 and a seat back 66- The base stnictiire 60 may be positioned, for example, above the motor compartment 50, and serves as a mounting structure for the seat bottom 64. The intermediate member 62 allo-ws the seat bottom 64 to be adjusted to an operator set position relative to the base structure 60. For example, the intermediate member 62 may comprise an arrangement that allows the seat bottom 64 to swivel or rotate relative to the base sfntcture 60. The intermediate member 62 may ftirther or alternatively allow the seat bottom 64 to move generally about a limited horizontal plane, e.g., by allowing the seat bottom 64 to transition in the fore, aft and/or lateral directions relative to the base structure 60.<br>
The operator's seat 56 may optionally include other adjustable features such as a seat back tilt arrangement that allows the seat back 66 to tilt relative to the seat bottom 64. In this regard, the seat back tilt arrangement may include an optional tilt release lever for selectively enabling repositioning of the seat back 66. Altematively, the seat back tilt arrangement may be arranged so as to provide a flexible feature to the seat back 66. Under this arrangement, the seat back 66 is supported in a default, upright position. However, an operator can apply a manual force to temporarily tilt the seat back 66. When the operator applied tilting force is relieved, the flexible nature of the seat back tilt arrangement returns the seat back 66 to its defauh upright position.<br>
Other seat back tilt and repositioning arrangements, or fixed seat arrangements may altematively be implemented. Further, the operator's seat 56 may be located in other suitable positions. For standup trucks, the operator's station may be defined within the operator's compartmenl 20, for example, at a position where a backiest, knee pad, foot placement area or other provided support structure or location where an operator assumes a normal vehicle operating position while operating the vehicle. For standup trucks, the work operative controls 58 are typically provided in close proximity to the operator's standing or leaning posiiion.<br>
As noted above, when an operator is seated (in the case of sit douTi trucks) or standmg iT leaning against a provided support structure (in the case of stand up trucks) and is in the lormal vehicle operating position at the norma! vehicle operating station, one or more work<br><br>
operative controls 58 are provided within reach of tlie operator. For example, as showii, an armrest 68 is provided adjacent to and within arm's reach of the operator's seat 56. The armrest 68 supports one or more work operative controls 5K thereon. For example, a phirality of control elements including finger buttons, switches, levers, handles, knobs and other devices maybe combined into a control area of the armrest 68.<br>
A steering tiller 82 is also provided within the operator's compartment 20 for controlling the direction of travel of the vehicle 10, The steering tiller 82 is coupled to a steer column 84 that extends from a first control area, e.g., adjacent to the first longitudinal sidewall 30 of the vehicle 10. The steer column 84 may optionally be capable of tilting or otherwise repositioning to ensure a comfortable position for an operator. However, other steering arrangements may alternatively be implemented.<br>
Additionally, one or more presence-sensing detectors 86 may be provided about the operator's compartment 20. As shown, a first presence-sensing detector 86 is implemented as a left foot presence device that is positioned about the floor of the operator's compartment 20 so as to generally lie under an operator's left foot, for example, when the operator's seat 56 is in a default position and the operator is in a work operative position seated in the operator's seat 56. The presence-sensing detector 86 may be integrated with other vehicle electronics to limit, restrict, modify or otherwise enable certain vehicle 10 work operations, depending upon whether the presence pedal detects a foot of the vehicle 10 operator.<br>
One or more control pedals maybe positioned adjacent to the presence sensing detector 86. For example, the control pedals may include a brake pedal 88, which is positioned adjacent to the presence-sensing detector 86, and an acceleration pedal 89 posihoned adjacent to the brake pedal 88. In the illustrated configuration, the brake pedal 88 and the acceleration pedal 89 may be operated by the right foot of the operator. Other devices may also be positioned individually, or combined in one or more control areas on the armrest 68 or otherwise proximate to the operator's seat 56, e.g., on a work area 90 within the operator's compartment 20, including for example, levers, switches, jog wheels, throttles, twist grips, potentiometers, encoders, displays, communications devices, wireless scanning or detecting technologies and other controls.<br><br>
With reference to Fig. 4, an overhead guard J 00 extends generally over at least a portion of the operator's compartment 20, The overhead guard 100 comprises a guard frame rigidly coupled to a support slracture of a materials handling vehicie 10 so as to extend generally over at least a portion of the operator's compartment 20, where the guard frame is oriented at an angle at least in an area of the overhead guard 100 situated forward of a normal vehicle operating position towards a load handling assembly 12 of ihe vehicle 10. The angle of the guard frame has a magnitude that is at least five degrees relative to horizontal directed upward towards the load handling assembly 12. For example, as shown, the guard frame extends from an uppermost position (highest position) proximate to the load handling assembly, which is towards the first end section 14 of the vehicle 10, and extends at an angle downward towards the normal operating position of the vehicle, e.g., the operator's seat 56, and is rigidly coupled to support structures implemented as a first support post 102 and a second support post 104 proximate to the second end section 18 of said vehicle 10.<br>
Although the vehicle 10 is illustrated as having a first support post 102 and a second support post 104 extending from the chassis 28 of the vehicle proximate to the second lateral sidewall 36, the overhead guard 100 may be coupled to the vehicle 10 by any suitable support structure, including the mast 42 (e.g., as shown in Fig. 10), in combination with, or in lieu of, one or more support posts. Moreover, each provided support post 102, 104 may be coupled to the chassis 28 towards the first end section 14 (e.g., as shown in Fig, 11) or at any suitable location, such as fi-om an associated one of the first and second longitudinal sidewalls 30, 32,<br><br>

overhead guard 100 to the vehicle 10 will be described in greater detail below.<br>
Jn the illustrated exemplary vehicle 10 (see for example, Figs. 1-3), the operator's .seat 56 is normally side facing. That is, the seat back 66 of the operator's seat 56 is positioned generally adjacent to the second longitudinal sidewall 32, and the operator's seat 56 faces generally towards the first longitudinal sidewall 30. As such, the first support post 102 is generally forward of the operator's seat 56, and is thus also referred to herein as a forward support post 102. Similarly, in the illustrated vehicle 10. the second support post 104 is positioned generally behind the operator's seat 56. Thus, the second support post 104 is also referred to herein as a rearward support post 104.<br><br>
With reference to Fig, 5, an operator of the vehicle 10 will normally be facmt; the first longitudinal sidewall 30 when seated in the operator's seat 56 if the seat 56 is maintained in its default forward facing position and the operator is looking straight ahead. To provide improved operator forward facing visibility, the forward support post 102 is longitudinally spaced Irom a hypothetical line of sight 108 drawn across the vehicle 10 from the position of the operator's seat 56, i.e., a distance to either side of the line of sight 108. For example, as illustrated, the forward support post 102 is positioned towards the comer edge of the first longitudinal sidewall 30 and the second lateral sidewail 36 of the operator's compartment 20.<br>
With reference to Figs. 1 and 5, the positioning of the forward support post 102 in the comer of the operator's compartment 20 provides a convenient grasping post so that as the operator steps up into the vehicle 10, a suitable structure is available should the operator desire a hand hold. This positioning of the forward support post 102 in combination with the location of the operator's seat 56 as described above reduces the distraction and interference of the forward support post 102 from the direct line of sight 108 of an operator sitting in the operator's seat 56 in its nominal position, e.g., when the operator faces forward towards the first longitudinal sidewall 30. Depending upon factors such as the strength requirements of the overhead guard 100, it may be necessary to provide one or more additional support posts in addition to the forward support post 102 and the rearward support post 104.<br>
The support posts 102,104 may be utilized to support features, accessories and add¬ons of the vehicle 10. For example as shown m Fig. 5, the forward support post i02 is utilized to support an accessory 114 that may be used to assist the operator in performing work tasks. The accessory may include, for example, a radio fi-equency (RF) scanner, receiver, clipboard, light, fan, radio, display and/or other accessories 114, which maybe mounted to the forward support post 102, e.g., using a suitable mounting bracket.<br>
The rearward support post 104 is shown in the comer of the second longitudinal sidewall 32 and the second lateral sidewall 36. Alternatively, the rearward support post 104 may be set inward of the comer edge of the chassis 28, e.g., positioned generally behind the operator's seat 56 or in other suitable locations that may allow a seated operator to have clear visibility, which is unobstructed by the rearward support post 104 when looking towards the forks 46, towards the first end section 14 of the vehicle 10 or towards the second end section 18 of the vehicle 10. Thus, the rearward support post 104 may not significantly interfere with<br><br>
the visibility of the operator, for example, when driving ihe vehicle 10 with the power unil 16 leading or when driving the vehicle 10 having the forks 46 leading.<br>
With reference generally to Figs, 4, 6 and 7, the angled guard 106 comprises a generally "U" shaped guard frame 116 that includes a first frame member 118, a second frame member 120 and a third frame member 122, The first, second and third frame members 118, 120, 122 may comprise independent struchires that are bonded, fastened, weided, joined or otherwise coupled together. Alternatively, two or more of the first, second and third frame members 118, 120, 122 may be derived from a common source stmcture. e.g,, by bending or otherwise deforming a structure to conform to the desired geometry of the guard frame 116,<br>
In the exemplary guard 100, the first frame member 118 extends generally in the longitudinal direction. As such, the first frame member 118 is also referred to herein as a first longitudinal frame member 118, The second frame member 120 extends generally in the lateral direction. As such, the second frame member 120 is also referred to herein as a lateral frame member 120. The third frame member 122 extends in the longitudinal direction. As such, the third frame member 122 is also referred to herein as a second longitudinal frame member 122.<br>
When the overhead guard lOO is suitably mounted over the chassis 28 of the power uiiii 16, ai Icasi ti poriiuii of ilie uvcihgau guaiu uaijic ilG is uiicnleu ai au angle liavmy a magnitude that is at least five degrees relative to the horizontal, and is angled upward and towards the load handling assembly 12 of the vehicle 10, e.g., towards the upper portion of the mast 42 or forks 46 (when in a raised position). The angled portion of the guard extends at least in an area of the overhead guard 100 situated between the operator's seat 56 and the load handling assembly 12 of the vehicle 10, For example, as illustrated, first and second longitudinal frame members 118, 122 angle upward in a plane towards an upper section of the mast 42 at an angle A (see for example, Fig. 8). The angle A may vary depending upon a number offactors such as the visibility requirements of a particular vehicle, the height of the mast 42, etc. Thus, in practice, the angle A will typically be at least 5 degrees, but may be as much as 15-30 degrees or more.<br><br>
Moreover, the first longitudinal frame member 118 has 3 first end section 128 opposite of the lateral frame member 120 that tapers and curves generally inwfird towards a cenrerline 132 of the vehicle 10. Similarly, the second longitudinal frame member 122 has a first end section BOoppositeof the lateral frame member 120 that also tapers and curves generaUy inward towards the centerline ! 32 of the vehicle 10. The taper and inward curve on the first end sections 128, ]3Dof the first and second longitudinal frame members 118. 122 is provided for example, to prevent the overhead guard 100 from snagging, catching or otherwise engaging unintended stmctures, or from giving the appearance that the overhead guard 100 can snag, catch or otherwise engage unintended structures. The angled and tapered features of the first and second longitudinal frame members US, 122 also give the overhead guard iOO the appearance ofa shorter overall length when viewed from certain angles, especially by a seated operator.<br>
The guard member(s) may be defined by a plate 134 or other suitable structrure capable of providing a barrier across or otherwise between the frame members 118, 120,122. For example, as illustrated in the figures generally, the plate 134 spans between the first and second longitudinal frame members 118, 122, and extends longitudinally from the lateral frame member 120 towards the first end secfion 14 of the vehicle 10. Moreover, the plate 134 is oriented generally over the operator's seat 56 and is positioned generally adjacent to the lateral frame member 120. The plate 134 may alternatively have a different size, shape, position and/or orientation, depending upon the application. The plate 134 may incorporate or Gthcr-visc be provided in audition to sioti ui ullici uf cultigb thai allow vistbiiiEy through the overhead guard 100. For example, the plate 134 may include a plurality of apertures therethrough. The plate 134 may also be located adjacent to slots or other openings as shown.<br>
With specific reference to Fig, 7, which shows the underside of the overhead guard 100, a support bar 138 may opiionally span between the first and second longiUidinal frame members US, 122, e.g., along the edge of the plate 134 opposite of the lateral frame member 120 to provide additional support and/or rigidity to the plate 134, slots and other features if orovided- The dimensions of the support bar 138 maybe determined such that the support bar 138 will not interfere with the visibiliiy of the operator seated in the operator's seat 56 and .ooking up. e.g., generally towards the forks 46 when the forks 46 are in a hoisted po.'^irion.<br><br>
With reference back to Figs. 4, 6 and 7, one or more guard members may also be implemented as guard bars 140 in addition to, or in lieu of the plate 134. The guard bar(s) 140 are supported by the guard frame 116 and may span or otherwise extend in the area defined by the first, second and third frame members 118, 120, 122, For example, the guard bars 140 may extend in the longimdinal direction, in the lateral direction, or at an angle. Moreover, the guard bars 140 may be generally straight or arcuate as will be described in greater detail below.<br>
As shown, there are three guard bars 140, However any number of guard bars 140 may be utilized, depending for example, upon the length of the first and second longitudinal frame members 118, 122 and the required or desired spacing and/or orientation between adjacent guard bars 140.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, each guard bar 140 is positioned between the first and second longitudinal frame members 118, 122 and is oriented at an angle relative to the first and second longitudinal frame members 118,122. The particular angle may be selected to maximize the visibiiity of an operator seated in the operator's seat 56, who may be looking upward through, under or around the overhead guard 100. It is likely that different operators of the vehicle 10 will have different pbyaical attributes and that a given angle that is optimal for one operator may not be optimal for another operator. Thus, the selected angle may be based on an arbitrary anticipated operator. For example, the angle may be based "pen s 50   percentile size Oi ariticipalCu operators.<br>
The first and second longitudinal frame members 118, 122 each have an inside major surface 142,144 to which the plurality of guard bars 140 may be attached. Each guard member 140 further comprises a first end 146 and a second end 148. With reference to Fig, 8, which illustrates a cross section through the overhead guard 100 along the centerline 132, the plurality of guard bars 140 are positioned such that each of their respective ends 146, 148 are positioned at an angle relative to the corresponding inside major surface 142, 144 of the first and second longitudinal firame members 118.122, respectively, as illustrated in Fig, 8 by the angles a, ^ and -y. The angles a, ^ and y may be unique, or each may be the same.<br>
Moreover, the guard bars 140 may be arcuate as seen, for example, in Figs, I and 4. Thecurv-atureof the guard bars 140 relative tc the lateral direction, if provided, may be the<br><br>
same for each guard bar J 40, or each guard bar MO may have a unique radius of curvature defining its arc. The amount of cun,'ature of each guard member !40 may var&gt;" depending upon a number of factors. The arc of the guard bars UOmay be determined based upon the position of the operator's seat 56, the anticipated size of an arbitrary operator, e.o_. a 50'^ percentile anticipated operator, the distance of the anticipated operator from the guard member 140 and other like factors taken alone or in combination.<br>
The arcuate shape of the guard bars 140 allows improved visibility through the overhead guard 100 regardless of whether the focus of the vision of the opetalor is through the middle portion of the guard 100, e.g., along the centerline 132, to the forward side of the guard 100 or to the rearward side of the guard 100. Also, while shown as being arcuate in shape, the guard bars 140 may also be straight bars or other shapes, including shapes having varying cross sectional area.<br>
With reference to Fig, 5, to view the forks 46, the operator (shown in phantom)^ turns his or her head to the side. As the forks 46 are raised, the operator's gaze is directed upward. The angled overhead guard 100 provides visibility to the top of the mast 42 and vertically beyond by providing visibility thixjugh the overhead guard 100.<br>
The guard bars 140 are each positioned between the first and second longitudinal frume members 118, 122 and are oriented at an angle as schematically represented in Fig, 8 so as to achieve a desired !uie uf si^M idugc L..di
By providing (he first and second longitudinal frame members 118, 122 at a nonzero angle relative to horizontal, the guard bars 140 may be physically fiirther away from an operator seated in the operator's seat 56, Thus, the guard bars 140 will be perceived by the operator as being smaller than they would be perceived if the first and second longitudinal frame members 118,122 were horizontally oriented. Also, the angle of each guard bar 140 red iices the operator perceived height (vertical dimension) of the guard bars 140, Accordingly, the guard bars 140 are less distracting to the operator compared to lateral bars in a conventional horizontal suard.<br><br>
As one example, for a given vehicle 10. a conventional horizonfai overhead suard, represented by a dashed line 200 in Fig. 9, may result in a visibility that i.s unobstructed by the overhead guard of approximately 4 meters or less. However, the angled overhead guard 100 allows a visibility unobstructed by the overhead guard 100 of over 5 meters.<br>
By angling the first and second longitudinal frame members U 8, 122 relative to horizontal, at least in the area of the overhead guard 100 situated between the normal vehicle operating position, e.g., the seat, and the load handling assembly, the spacing between the guard bars 140 along the first and second longitudinal frame members U8, 122 can he increased whiie retaining a predetermined horizontal spacing between the guard bars 140 as is apparent from simple geometry, e.g., by knowing the designed for hori^ntai spacing and the angle A of the guard frame 116 relative to the horizontal. For example, it may be desirable to realize a spacing of less than approximately 6 inches (150 millimeters) measured across the horizontal between adjacent guard bars 140. Moreover, the angle of the first and second longitudinal frame members 118, 122 may comprise an angle having a magnitude greater than zero degrees relative to the horizontal. Thus, simple geometry can be used to compute a corresponding spacing of the guard bars 140 along the first and second longitudinal frame members 118, 122 to achieve the desired corresponding horizontal spacing.<br>
Moreover, orienting the first and second longitudinal frame members 118, 122 upward tcv/ards the load handling assembly 12, at least in an area of the overhead guaij 100 siiuaicu between the operator's seal 56 and the load handling assembly 12 of the vehicle 10 further improves visibility when looking at an angle up through the guard bars 140, such as when seated in the operator's seat 56. As such, an operator seated in the operator's seat 56 has a oerceplion of better visibility because the angled overhead guard 100 improves the maximum jnobstrucled line of sight below the guard 100 and improves visibility through the guard 100.<br>
With reference to Fig. 10, another exemplary overhead guard configuration is )rovided to illustrate an arrangement wherein the angled overhead guard is attached to the mast 42 instead of the chassis 28. Depending upon the specific implementation, it may further be desirable to also attach the overhead guard to support posts, e.g., as described in erealer detail above.<br><br>
Wiih reference to Fig. 11, yel another exemplary configuration illustrates an arrangement wherein the support posts are positioned towards the first lateral sidewai! 34 of the operator's compartment 20. For example, support posts may be provided in each of the corners of the first lateral sidewali. As shown, the support posts 152 angle relative to the vertical to compensate for a mast 42 that is capable of tilting. The angled overhead guard 100 may also be utilized on vehicles having a retractable guard, e.g., to accommodate vehicles That must enter truck trailers, containers, and fit through iow doors.<br>
