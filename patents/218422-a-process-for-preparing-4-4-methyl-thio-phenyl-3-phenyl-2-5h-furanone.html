field of the invention:<br>
l-[(4-methyl thio)phenyl]-2-(phenyl acetoxy)-l-ethanone and a process for preparing the same.<br>
Background to the invention:<br>
Non-steroid, anti-inflammatory drugs exert most of their ami inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity and inhibit hormone-induced uterine concentrations and certain types of cancer growth through the inhibition of prostaglandin G/H synthase, also known as cyclooxygenase. Until recently, only one form of cyclooxygenease had been characterised, this corresponding to cyclooxygenase I or the constitutive enzyme, as originally identified in bovine seminal vesicles. Recently the gene for a second inducible form of cyclooxygenase (cyclooxygenase -2) has been cloned, sequenced and characterised from chicken, murine and human sources. This enzyme is distinct from the cyclooxygenease-1 which has now also been cloned, sequenced and characterised from sheep, murine and human sources. The second form of cyclooxygenase, cyclooxygenase-2 is rapidly and readily inducible by a number of agents including mitogens, endotoxins, hormones, cytokines and growth factors. As prostaglandins have both physiological and pathological roles, it was concluded that the constitutive enzyme, cyclooxygenase-1, is responsible, in large part, for endogenous basal release of prostaglandins and hence is important in their<br><br>
physiological functions such as the maintenance of gastrointestinal integrity and renal blood flow. In contrast it was also concluded that the inducible form of cyclooxygenase-2 is mainly responsible for the pathological affects of prostaglandins where rapid induction of the enzyme would occur in response to such agents as inflammatory agents, hormones, growth factors and cytokines. Thus, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 will have similar anti inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties to a conventional non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug and in addition would inhibit hormone-induced uterine contractions and have potential anti cancer effects but will have a diminished ability to induce some of the mechanism based side effects. In particular such a compound should have a reduced potential for gasterointestinal toxicity, a reduced potential for renal side effects, a reduced effect on bleeding tomes and possibly a lessened ability to induce attacks of asthma in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic subjects.<br>
4-(4-methyl thio phenyl)-3-phenyl-2(5H)-foranone of the formula II shown herein below:<br><br><br>
is a key intermediate in the preparation of COX-II inhibitor, known in the art as Rofecoxib which has a structure X given below:<br><br>
The process known in the art for preparing the intermediate compound of the formula II involve tedious multi-step synthesis, utilizing expensive reagents.

It has now been found that the novel compound of formula I can be used as a starting material for the production of the compound of formula II in an economically advantageous manner. Cost-effective preparation of this intermediate, no doubt helps in reducing the price line of COX II inhibitor.<br><br>
