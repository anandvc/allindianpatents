				<td>AN APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR REGULATING FLUID FLOW IN MICRO<br>
STRUCTURES<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/430,792<br>
filed December 4, 2002 entitled "DEVICES AND METHODS FOR PROGRAMMABLE<br>
MICROSCALE MANIPULATION OF FLUIDS" the whole of which is herby incorporated<br>
by reference herein.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of microfluidic circuits for chemical,<br>
biological, and biochemical processes or reactions. More specifically, it discloses devices<br>
and methods for regulating fluid flow in microstructures in a programmable manner.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In recent years, the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, chemical and related industries<br>
have increasingly adopted micro-chamber and channel structures for performing various<br>
reactions and analyses. The benefits of these structures include miniaturization, reduction in<br>
space and cost of reagents and enable one to perform a large number of reactions without<br>
human intervention, either in parallel or in series (i.e., one after the other).<br>
Microfluidic devices are by far the most promising candidates to realize a micro-<br>
TAS (Micro Total Analysis System). In general, all attempts in this direction can be<br>
characterized in two ways: according to the forces responsible for the fluid transport and<br>
according to the mechanism used to direct the flow of fluids. The former are referred to as<br>
motors. The latter are referred to as valves, and constitute logic or analogue actuators,<br>
essential for a number of basic operations such as volumetric quantitation of fluids, mixing<br>
of fluids, connecting a set of fluid inputs to a set of fluid outputs, sealing containers (to gas<br>
or to liquids passage according to the application) in a sufficiently tight manner to allow<br>
fluid storage, regulating the fluid flow speed.<br>
As motors, the prior art disclose a variety of solutions, including electro-kinetic and<br>
electro-osmotic transport, mechanical micro-pumps, external pressure, acoustic energy, and<br>
the centripetal force. The present invention is concerned primarily, but not exclusively, with<br>
the category of centripetal devices. Accordingly, a summary of some of the prior art related<br>
to centripetal devices includes: Yamaji et al. (EP00392475A2) and Takase et al.<br>
(EP00417305A1) disclose a liquid sample analyser based on a rotating disk; Kellogg et al.<br>
(US 6,063,589/WO0187485A2) and Mian et al. (US 6,319,469, US21055812A1) disclose<br>
devices and methods for using centripetal acceleration to drive fluid movement in a<br>
microfluidic system; Kopf-Sill et al. (US 5,160,702) teaches an analyser with improved<br>
rotor structure; and Gordon (US 5,892,577, US 6,256,088, US 6,339,473) teaches an<br>
apparatus and method for carrying out analysis of samples.<br>
Devices with the ability to regulate fluid flow through the use of valves are known in<br>
the prior art, and differ in their ability to provide real-time control and analogue adjustment<br>
of the fluid flow. As an example, some valves have the ability to regulate fluid flow in an<br>
analogue manner, like hot water taps, some valves switch between on-off states and vice<br>
versa, like irrigation actuators, some valves have a single on-off transition, like electrical<br>
safety switches, or off-on-transition, like safety valves in pressurized circuits.<br>
Prior art microfluidic valve devices suffer from the drawback of high cost per valve,<br>
as well as the integration scale and complexity that can be achieved. Unfortunately, the<br>
reliability of most prior art devices within the meso-scale range is suspect. Further,<br>
alteration of sample material by the components of the valve and function of the valve has<br>
contributed to their unreliable nature and failure to produce a micro-analytical device with<br>
reproducible results. The design of prior art valving devices makes their manufacturing cost<br>
and complexity unsuitable for their cost effective use within micro-analytical devices diat<br>
are "throw-away" and mass produced.<br>
A summary of some of the prior art valve devices is as follows: Unger et al. US<br>
Patent No. 6,408,878 (Unger) teaches elastomeric valve and pump systems wherein a<br>
second elastomeric layer is bonded onto a top surface of the first elastomeric layer such that<br>
a control channel forms in the second recess between the first and second elastomeric layers<br>
and the first elastomeric layer is positioned on top of a planar substrate such that a flow<br>
channel forms in the first recess between the first elastomeric layer and the planar substrate.<br>
Unfortunately, Unger suffers from complexity of design and cost of manufacturing. In<br>
addition to the complexity of the valve, a control system based on pneumatic actuators has<br>
to be connected to the various valves through multiple independent lines, and its<br>
multiplexing (required in order to have fewer control lines than actual valves on the<br>
devices) has impact on the circuit design and requires accurate pressure control.<br>
A patent to Kellogg et al. US Patent No. 6,302,134 (Kellogg) teaches a heat-<br>
activated wax valve in a microfluidics array. This heat-activated wax valve within<br>
microsystem platforms requires numerous microfluidics components such as resistive<br>
heating elements, temperature sensing elements, mixing structures, to form these heat<br>
activated wax sacrificial valves. Apart from a significant occupancy of surface on the<br>
microfluidic circuit, the valve of Kellogg further requires an electronic spindle designed<br>
rotor capable of transferring electrical signals to and from the microsystem platforms. The<br>
requirements and complexity of the Kellogg valve make it impractical to use within micro-<br>
analytical systems. Further, the waste from valve actuation can contaminate samples of<br>
interest. In addition, the heat is transferred to the wax initially clogging the capillary by heat<br>
conduction. In this manner, the heat is also unavoidably transferred to the chip and to the<br>
fluids by conduction and convection. This is undesired in most biological applications<br>
where the samples could be significantly degraded by heat.<br>
A further prior art valving systems can be found in Kellogg et al. U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,143,248 (Kellogg '248). Kellogg 248 teaches a capillary microvalve that requires<br>
centripetal acceleration to drive fluid in micro-fluid system. The valving device of Kellogg<br>
'248 can only be used in a device having centripetal acceleration and also suffers from<br>
difficulty in its manufacture.<br>
Another prior art device Kellogg et al. US2002/0097632A1 (Kellogg Application)<br>
discloses a bi-directional flow centrifugal microfluidic devices. The valve within the<br>
Kellogg Application particularly provides microsystem platforms for achieving efficient<br>
mixing of one or a plurality of fluids on the surface of the platform when fluid flow is<br>
motivated by centripetal force produced by rotation. This bi-directional flow system is<br>
restricted in its use to mixing systems within centripetally driven micro-analytical systems.<br>
Numerous other prior art devices have attempted to improve upon valving devices<br>
for micro-analytical platforms, such as Onishi et al. (US 5,547,472) that teaches a catheter<br>
with medicament injection pores; Derand et al. (WO00102737A1) (Derand), which teaches<br>
polymer valves. An important feature of the polymers used in the valves of the Derand is<br>
that they switch from a swelled state to a contracted state or vice versa in a reversible<br>
manner, making the choice of the polymer (and its biocompatibility) restricted to a specific<br>
class of materials. In addition, the plug is foreseen to be within a capillary, making the<br>
manufacturing of the device more expensive and less suitable for mass production since<br>
each valve has to be manufactured and positioned within the circuit.<br>
Larsson et al. (W099/58245) discloses a microfluidic device where the flow of<br>
fluids is controlled by different surfaces of the device having different surface<br>
characteristics; McNeely et al. (US 2002/0033193) discloses remote valving for<br>
microfluidic flow control, Williams (US 2001/0054702A1) teaches a valve for use in<br>
microfluidic structures and Parce et al. (US 6,379,974) teaches microfluidic devices and<br>
systems utilizing electrokinetic material transport systems to selectively control and direct<br>
the transport of materials. Unfortunately, all suffer from complexity of their control<br>
systems, design, reliability, high manufacturing costs and application limited to given type<br>
of fluids.<br>
Another approach within prior art devices is shown in Limon et al, US Patent No.<br>
5,869,002 (Limon) where an analysis card containing two mutually separate chambers<br>
separated by a frangible partition that is arranged within the analysis card and made of an<br>
absorbent and preferably plastic material for absorbing light energy having at least a<br>
predetermined wavelength and converting it into heat energy capable of removing the<br>
frangible partition thus causing fluid communication between the chambers. Unfortunately,<br>
Limon suffers from several deficiencies. The valve of Limon is restricted to a certain<br>
configuration that is not adaptable to numerous micro-analytical platforms. More<br>
importantly the light energy required within Limon is of such intensity and duration that<br>
alteration occurs to the fluids or sample of interest within the adjoining chambers. To<br>
overcome the alteration, Limon et al. teach the use of cavities around the frangible partition,<br>
to preserve the liquid or liquids circulating in the analysis card from any premature or<br>
excessive heating. The valving device of Limon also suffers from its inflexibility in<br>
configuration and lack of adaptability to various micro-analytical platforms such as rotating<br>
disks or meso-scale devices. Unfortunately, the configuration required by Limon is not<br>
adaptable to an economical manufacturing process.<br>
Another drawback of prior art microfluidic circuits has been the difficulty to<br>
reconcile flexibility, in the form of fully programmable and configurable devices, with<br>
simplicity, in the form of manufacturing and operation. To regulate the flow of fluids<br>
through a microfluidic circuit, valves were provided. Prior art methods either rely on active<br>
components that can only be provided in limited numbers for reasons of cost and ease of<br>
manufacturing, or on passive components that cannot be actuated independently and<br>
additionally may depend on characteristics of fluid or the sample of interest. Many active<br>
valve systems in the prior art; are also characterized by a control system that has to be<br>
physically connected to the device, which is often not miniaturized (like the pressure control<br>
assembly of the Topaz Crystallizer by Fluidigm Corporation, San Francisco, CA) and<br>
therefore increases significantly the device complexity, system integration and portability.<br>
A significant drawback of prior art microfluidic circuits has been the difficulty in the<br>
handling of biological samples. Prior art devices suffer from valving components that may<br>
contaminate the sample of interest, alter or destroy such sample.<br>
Some of the prior art micro-valves integrated in a microfluidic circuit occupy a large<br>
surface of the chip. This is at the expense of the other functional components of the device,<br>
making the circuit integration (number of components per unit surface) smaller and<br>
therefore the chips more expensive. This need to occupy a large surface detracts from their<br>
use within a microfluidic circuit.<br>
Another drawback of prior art microfluidic circuits has been the reliability of<br>
valving components. Prior art devices suffer from occasional failure and most importantly<br>
the lack of feedback controls to recognize such failures. While this aspect may be neglected<br>
in chips with a moderate number of valves, (e.g. chips of small complexity), the need of<br>
high integration of microfluidic devices requires a higher reliability than the prior art offers<br>
of the basic functional components and in particular of valving devices.<br>
A further drawback of prior art microfluidic valves consists in narrow manufacturing<br>
tolerances on geometry, surface properties, choice of materials, and complexity of<br>
production process. Increasing the integration scale (number of valves in a device) for a<br>
manufacturing process which is either complex or has tight tolerances or both results in a<br>
high production failure rate, further driving up the cost of production.<br>
Another aspect particular to microfluidics consists in the required disposability of<br>
the valves and the overall circuitry. It is well known in the art that the surface-to-volume<br>
ratio increases with decreasing volumes. Since a large fraction of the sample is in contact<br>
with the chip and valve surfaces, it also means that the fluids contamination is a bigger issue<br>
than in the macro-scale world. To avoid contamination of sample, a valve should be<br>
preferably used with a single type of sample, and possibly only once to avoid changes in the<br>
sample concentration. A valving method relying on reusable valves is therefore less<br>
attractive in most microfluidic applications.<br>
The present invention meets the need for a flexible, reliable and yet a simple means<br>
to regulate fluid flow, as well as a variety of other needs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed towards a microfluidic circuit in which fluid flow<br>
is regulated by putting two microfluidic components that are initially separated into fluid<br>
communication. Both the time at which the two components are connected and the position<br>
of such fluid communication are arbitrary and can be determined externally. Accordingly,<br>
the invention describes an infinite number of preferably irreversible valves, all of which are<br>
initially in the closed state, but may be opened at any time and in any order.<br>
When a valve is closed, the fluid is contained in a first microfluidic component. As<br>
soon as the valve is opened, fluid communication is enabled to at least one or more<br>
additional microfluidic components. Whether the fluid will flow into the additional<br>
components, to what extent and at which speed, depends on the forces acting on the fluid<br>
and the impediments to fluid flow through valving components.<br>
In microfluidic circuits, fluid transport may be achieved through the use of<br>
mechanical micropumps, electric fields, application of acoustic energy, external pressure, or<br>
centripetal force. A valve according the invention is independent of the mechanism for<br>
fluid transport and is therefore compatible with, but not limited to, any of the above means<br>
for fluid transport. In general, the inventive valves may be opened, but preferably not<br>
closed. This feature is relatively less important for microfluidic circuits where the direction<br>
of the force is irreversible, such as is the case for devices exploiting the centripetal force,<br>
and can be overcome in most other cases by a suitable design of the circuit and of its basic<br>
components.<br>
It is contemplated within the scope of the invention that in order to "close" the<br>
inventive valve a two-component "glue" can be distributed to the opposite sides of the<br>
opened valve. The glue is chosen among those that do not require mixing of the two<br>
components, and have a reasonably fast setting time in order to seal the valve opening. The<br>
glue can be acrylic glue commercially available as V5004 by Permabond, which has good<br>
flowing characteristics and is non-stringing. It is further contemplated within the scope of<br>
the invention that another "glue" having the advantage of biological compatibility, such as<br>
fibrin glue or the like may be used to seal an opened valve. A fibrin glue such as tissuecol<br>
is contemplated within the scope of the invention. The fibrin glue contains two components<br>
that include a fibrin protein on one side and thrombin on the other side. Their contact<br>
produces a coagulant reaction that seals the valve.<br>
It is also contemplated within the scope of the invention that fluid passage can be<br>
arrested by opening a valve allowing fluid to enter one branch of a Tesla valve. The latter is<br>
a fluidic diode or a valvular conduit, that allows easy flow in one direction but in the other<br>
the flow gets hung up forming eddies, or counter-currents that stop the flow as surely as if a<br>
mechanical valve were moved into the shut position. With this configuration, opening a<br>
valve according to the present invention allows fluid to enter in one of the branches and<br>
thereby stop fluidic flow, which is the same functionality achieved by the action of closing a<br>
valve.<br>
As another example, the inventive valve can be used to distribute a fluid changing<br>
significantly the surface properties of a channel (for example, making it more or less<br>
hydrophobic). This could produce, as a net effect, the consequence that another fluid (for<br>
example water) does not enter the output channel anymore, and the output channel could be<br>
considered as "closed" for what concerns the passage of water.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for processing<br>
biological or chemical fluids includes a first substrate comprising a plurality of first meso-<br>
scale fluidic components, a second substrate comprising a plurality of second meso-scale<br>
fluidic components corresponding to the first meso-scale fluidic components. It is<br>
contemplated within the scope of the invention that the inventive apparatus may further<br>
comprise additional substrate layers. According to the invention, these additional substrate<br>
layers can contain a plurality of fluidic channels, chambers and manipulative components<br>
such as lenses and filters.<br>
Between each substrate layer, a material layer or perforation layer separates the<br>
plurality of first meso-scale fluidic components from the plurality of second meso-scale<br>
fluidic components or additional nano-scale or meso-scale components. The structure of the<br>
material layer could be homogeneous or heterogeneous, for example including multilayer<br>
and coatings. According to the invention the material layer or perforation layer is<br>
comprised of a polymeric compound such as Poly(methyl methacrylate), hereafter referred<br>
to as PMMA. It is contemplated within the scope of the invention that other materials such<br>
as Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE), High<br>
Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Polyethylene Teraphathalate (PET), Polyethylene (PE),<br>
polycarbonate (PC), Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG) , Polystyrene (PS), Ethyl<br>
Vinyl Acetate (EVA), polyethylene napthalate (PEN) or the like can be used. These<br>
polymers can be used singularly or in combination with each other. The use of polymers is<br>
preferred because of its ease of use and manufacturing. It is clear that other options, for<br>
example metallic foils with or without additional surface treatment, are possible, the choice<br>
being connected with the type of electromagnetic radiation generating means used in the<br>
application.<br>
The material layer may further comprise optical dye or other like material or layers<br>
having adsorptive properties of pre-selected electromagnetic radiation. The absorption can<br>
occur through known modifications as those used in absorbing light filters, for example<br>
including metallic foils or modifying the surface optical characteristics (n refraction index<br>
and k extinction coefficient) or by means of other surface properties like roughness, in such<br>
a way that a sufficient amount of pre-selected electromagnetic energy is absorbed with the<br>
consequence of perforation. Other technologies can make use of light absorbing globules,<br>
for example carbon-black particles, dye emulsions, nanocrystals. In addition, reflective<br>
layers, polarization changing layers, wavelength shifting layers could be used to enhance<br>
the effective absorption of electromagnetic energy.<br>
An advantage of the current invention consists in the extreme compactness of the<br>
valve in the microfluidic circuit that allows maximizing the surface used for fluid storage,<br>
incubation and reactions to occur. The valve size, by tuning the optical system position,<br>
power and pulse duration of the electromagnetic radiation generating means, can be also<br>
adapted to the circuit in a wide range of dimensions, down to the diffraction limit or below.<br>
When laminar flow is desired within the microfluidic circuit, the valve cross section should<br>
approximately match the cross section of the capillaries that are interconnected. When<br>
mixing is desired, valves with, a cross section largely different from the fluidic cross section<br>
of the circuit are preferable, in order to allow turbulences to act as active mixing agents.<br>
The valves of the present invention are intrinsically low-cost; in particular they have<br>
null marginal cost since the cost of the device does not depend on how many valves are<br>
implemented on the circuit itself.<br>
The valves according to the invention have a dead volume that can be neglected in<br>
microfluidics applications, and is smaller than most other valve designs in the prior art. The<br>
inventive valve is typically easy to open, to implement and to build, both in laboratory<br>
devices and industrial manufacturing production.<br>
The inventive valve can be extremely fluid tight, by choosing a material layer<br>
having low permeability. This allows using the inventive valve as seals for storage of<br>
chemicals. Many valving systems, for example those based on hydrophobic breaks, or<br>
based on calibrated capillary tension forces on the fluid, or based on pressure actuated<br>
modifications of the polymer shape, do not provide enough tightness to vapours and liquids<br>
to make the storage possible.<br>
The valve of the invention could be also used for the storage of lyophilised<br>
molecules, and for example proteins. In fact, the partial permeability of the material layer<br>
to water vapour, could be used in order to control the loss of water vapour by sublimation of<br>
a frozen compound, when the disk is heated in vacuum. This would allow long-term<br>
storage of molecules, for example pharmaceutical compounds, in very small volumes and<br>
ready for use. The molecules could be collected by having a solvent, through a valve<br>
opened in the material layer, dissolving the molecules and then exiting the storage cavity by<br>
means of a second valve on the layer.<br>
According to the invention, an electromagnetic generating means for generating<br>
electromagnetic radiation for directing onto the material layer or perforation layer at a<br>
position corresponding to a portion of the material layer located between at least a pair of<br>
corresponding meso-scale fluidic components from the plurality of first meso-scale fluidic<br>
components and the plurality of second meso-scale fluidic components. The<br>
electromagnetic generating means allows perforation of the material layer at a position<br>
allowing fluid communication between the pair of meso-scale fluidic components. The<br>
perforation of the material layer occurs in a defined manner that is dependent on the<br>
wavelength and intensity of the radiation, which is applied to the device within a limited<br>
space and time, thereby avoiding any substantial alteration of fluids or samples of interest.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for multiplexing biological<br>
or chemical fluids includes a first substrate comprising a set of input capillaries, a second<br>
substrate comprising a set of output capillaries corresponding to the set of input capillaries,<br>
a layer of material positioned between the first substrate and the second substrate forming<br>
an interface between each of the input capillaries and each of the output capillaries<br>
corresponding thereto and electromagnetic radiation generating means for generating<br>
electromagnetic radiation for directing onto the material layer at the interface between a first<br>
input capillary of the plurality of input capillaries and a corresponding first output capillary<br>
of the plurality of output capillaries. The electromagnetic generating means allows<br>
perforation of the material layer at the interface allowing first input capillary and the first<br>
output capillary to be in fluid communication without damage or substantial alteration to the<br>
biological sample or fluids within the microfluidic network.<br>
The multiplexing capability addresses the need of a flexible, programmable fluid<br>
handling. The choice of the fluids involved in a reaction, for example, can be made in real-<br>
time during protocol execution.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for volumetric<br>
quantitation of a liquid in a centripetal device includes a first meso-scale fluidic component<br>
containing a liquid for quantitation, a second meso-scale fluidic component and fluid<br>
communication means for placing the first and the second fluidic components in fluid<br>
communication at a first position. Upon a centripetal force or other force being placed on<br>
the liquid, a first amount of the liquid left in the first fluidic component or a second amount<br>
of liquid transferred to the second fluidic component is determined by the choice of the first<br>
position.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a method for volumetric quantitation of a<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides centrifugal rotors and microsystems and in<br>
particular nano-scale or meso-scale microfluidic valve technology platforms as well as a<br>
number of its applications for providing centripetally-motivated fluid micromanipulation.<br>
For the purpose of illustration, the drawings as well as the description will generally refer to<br>
centripetal systems. However, the means disclosed in this invention are equally applicable<br>
in microfluidic components relying on other forces to effect fluid transport.<br>
For the purposes of this specification, the term "sample" will be understood to<br>
encompass any fluid, solution or mixture, either isolated or detected as a constituent of a<br>
more complex mixture, or synthesized from precursor species. A sample may farther be<br>
comprised of a suspension or an emulsion containing beads, nanoparticles, globules, cells,<br>
or the like.<br>
For the purposes of this specification, the term "in fluid communication" or "fluidly<br>
connected" is intended to define components that are operably interconnected to allow fluid<br>
flow between components. In illustrative embodiments, the micro-analytical platform<br>
comprises a rotatable platform, such as a disk, or experimental microfluidic chips whereby<br>
fluid movement on the disk is motivated by centripetal force upon rotation of the disk and<br>
fluid movement on the experimental chip is motivated by pumps and fluid communication<br>
is achieved by the perforation of a material layer.<br>
For the purposes of this specification, the term "material layer" or "perforation<br>
layer" is intended to define components that separate various micro fluidic components such<br>
as chambers, channels and other microfluidic elements and upon perforation by<br>
electromagnetic irradiation bring such micro fluidic components in fluid communication<br>
with each other.<br>
For the purposes of this specification, the term "biological sample", "sample of<br>
interest" or "biological fluid sample" will be understood to mean any biologically-derived<br>
or synthesized analytical sample, including but not limited to blood, plasma, serum, lymph,<br>
saliva, tears, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, sweat, plant and vegetable extracts, semen, or any<br>
cellular or cellular components of such sample.<br>
For the purposes of this specification, the term "perforation" is intended to define<br>
the dissolution of a portion of any such material layer or perforation layer either by<br>
decomposition or phase change (into a different solid aggregation, liquid, gas or plasma<br>
states) or chemical uncoupling of any such material forming such perforation or material<br>
layer. Such perforation is achieved by electromagnetic irradiation having an energy and<br>
wavelength meant to be absorbed by such material layer or additives contained within or<br>
adjacent to such material layer with the consequence of creating a passing through hole in<br>
the layer.<br>
For the purposes of this specification, the term "ablation" specifically refers to a<br>
rapid process where the heat wave ejects the material that is vaporised into plasma.<br>
For the purposes of this specification, the term "meso-scale", or "nano-scale" will be<br>
understood to mean any volume, able to contain fluids, with dimensions preferably in the<br>
sub-micron to millimetre range.<br>
Representative applications of centripetal systems (e.g., centrifuge) employ circular<br>
devices, with the rotation axis at their centre. For the purpose of illustration, the drawings,<br>
as well as the description, will generally refer to such devices. Other shapes, including<br>
elliptical and rectangular devices, irregular surfaces and volumes, and devices for which the<br>
rotation axis does not pass through the centre, may be beneficial for specific applications.<br>
The microfluidic device used for illustrative purposes in the present invention will<br>
be referred to as a disk which, in some embodiments, is rotating around a given axis. The<br>
operations that may be performed depend on the shape, the material composition and the<br>
complexity of the disk. The microfluidic system may include, in addition to the disk, one or<br>
more than one external moiety designed to perform operations on the disk, including but not<br>
limited to the loading of chemical, biological or biochemical fluids, the optical readout of<br>
signals, the detection of radioactivity, the analysis of assays, detection of compounds of<br>
interest, injection of samples from the disk to a chromatographer or mass spectrometer,<br>
exposure of the disk to x-ray or gamma or neutron beams, transfer of fluids to or from the<br>
disk, transfer of fluids from a disk to another disk.<br>
In an illustrative embodiment of the present invention, the external moiety includes a<br>
pickup, a device capable of focusing a substantial amount of electromagnetic radiation onto<br>
a point in the disk, and a spinning device. The disk and the pickup are designed to interact<br>
primarily by means of electromagnetic radiation, at a pre-selected preferred wavelength or<br>
spectrum of wavelengths. Hereafter, this wavelength or spectrum of wavelengths will be<br>
referred to as the "pickup wavelength" or "pre-selected wavelength".<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, a novel system for valve implementation in a<br>
microfluidic circuit is presented. It represents a fully programmable (active) solution where<br>
the fluid flow is controlled by means of a distributed valve system, meaning that the<br>
position of a given valve is arbitrary and the valves themselves, extdend to the full<br>
microfluidic circuit. The described valves are typically limited to a closed-to-open<br>
transition, even if schemes that restore a valve state from open to close are possible and here<br>
commented. Another significant advantage of the system is the large number of valves that<br>
may be integrated in a circuit.<br>
THE DISK<br>
The preferred embodiment of the disk includes a circular microfluidic device.<br>
Rectangular disks, rotating around an axis that preferably does not intersect the disk<br>
volume, offer specific advantages. To achieve compatibility with commercial products<br>
related to compact disk technology, the disks may have similar or identical dimensions<br>
thereto. Likewise, rectangular disks, with a footprint equal to that of micro well plates or of<br>
credit cards, are particularly suited for automatic handling and storage of compounds,<br>
including the transfer of fluids between disks and the transfer of fluids from disks to<br>
standard well plates used in the chemical and biochemical industry, as well as from standard<br>
well plates to disks.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1 A, the internal structure of the disk 100 in one illustrative<br>
embodiment comprises a sandwich of at least three layers: a top side 101, a bottom side<br>
103, and a material layer 105 separating the two sides 101,103. To achieve higher densities<br>
in a single disk, the sandwich structure can be replicated to produce a multi-base sandwich.<br>
In such a configuration, sides 101,103 are contained between at least two material layers<br>
105 and have microfluidic components on both surfaces, and possibly comprise additional<br>
microfluidic elements putting into fluid communication the components at their respective<br>
surfaces.<br>
Turning to FIG 1B the disk according to the invention is shown wherein the top side<br>
101 contains a microfluidic structure 110 (which is a dosimeter reservoir described below)<br>
and the bottom side 103 contains a corresponding microfluidic structure 111 (which is the<br>
capillary outlets of the dosimeter). Numerous microfluidic structures can be incorporated<br>
within the top side 101 and bottom side 103. These microfluidic structures are separated by<br>
the material layer 105 and can be place in fluid communication with each other by the<br>
perforation of the material layer 105. The microfluidic structures 110, 111 contained within<br>
the respective top and bottom sides 101,103 may be mirror images of each other or they<br>
may be dissimilar structures separated by the material layer 105 having an integrated<br>
function with each other upon perforation of the material layer 105.<br>
A. MATERIAL LAYER<br>
A variety of materials are suitable for the material layer 105 or perforation layer,<br>
including but not limited to thin polymer foils and metallic foils. The thickness in<br>
microfluidic applications typically varies between about 0.5 to about 100 microns,<br>
depending on the material properties and on the characteristics of the pickup.<br>
In a first illustrative embodiment infrared absorbing polymer foils are used since<br>
they can be easily perforated with simple and economical means. These polymer foils are<br>
comprised of a polymeric compound such as Poly(methyl methacrylate), Low Density<br>
Polyethylene (LDPE), Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE), High Density<br>
Polyethylene (HDPE), Polyethylene Teraphathalate (PET), Polyethylene (PE),<br>
polycarbonate (PC), Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG), Polystyrene (PS), Ethyl<br>
Vinyl Acetate (EVA), polyethylene napthalate (PEN) or the like can be used.<br>
It is contemplated within the scope of the invention that these polymeric compounds<br>
may be used singularly or in combination with each other. In a further illustrative<br>
embodiment copper foils with a thickness in the order of about 2 microns are can be used.<br>
Copper foils are routinely produced for applications in the electronic industry, specifically<br>
for printed circuit boards. Thin metallic foils, such as copper, exhibit a natural absorption<br>
in the domain of ultraviolet light wavelength, which is of interest in some of the illustrative<br>
embodiments.<br>
It is further contemplated within the scope of the invention that additional materials<br>
may be used for the material layer 10S such as waxes, because of their low melting point,<br>
and polysaccharides such as cellulose, or the like. It is also contemplated within the scope<br>
of the invention that liquid crystal polymers may be used for the material layer.<br>
The choice of material layer 105 is dictated by the requirement for large light<br>
absorption at the pickup wavelength. Except for the choice of material, large absorption<br>
may be achieved by modifying the optical properties of any such material using dyes,<br>
coatings, surface treatments or by an appropriate multi-layer construction to exploit light<br>
interference processes. It is contemplated within the scope of the invention that dyes having<br>
desired optical properties such as ADS905AM, an infrared dye from American Dye Source<br>
Inc. of USA, whose chemical formulation is C62 H96 N6 Sb F8 or the Epolight 2057, an<br>
infrared dye from Epolin Inc. of USA whose absorption spectrum is suitable to near infrared<br>
sources, can be loaded into the material layer. It is further contemplated that infrared<br>
absorbing solutions such as Epolight 2180, Epolight 2189, and Carbon black loading, either<br>
in homogeneous dispersion or in heterogeneous suspension or emulsion (globules or<br>
particles) can be used. It is also contemplated within the scope of the invention that other<br>
absorption spectrums below or above infrared may be used to match the material layer 105<br>
with any form of electro-magnetic radiation.<br>
In one illustrative embodiment a material layer 105 is formed from PMMA and<br>
loaded with the infrared dye ADS905AM in a weight percent of approximately 0.5%. The<br>
dye is suspended within the PMMA film in non-uniform globules. While the suspension of<br>
such dye is not distributed uniformly throughout the material layer, it is sufficiently<br>
distributed to produce a desired absorption of the pre-selected wavelength.<br>
It is further contemplated within the scope of the invention that other dyes such as<br>
Epolight 2057, Epolight 2180, Epolight 2189 or the like may be used to achieve a desired<br>
spectral absorption. It is also contemplated within the scope of the invention that other<br>
compounds other than dyes such as Carbon black, or the like, having light absorption<br>
properties may be used to achieve a desired spectral absorption.<br>
Additional requirements for the material layer 105 depend on the application, and<br>
relate specifically to the interaction of fluids with neighbouring materials. Examples of<br>
additional requirements are resistance to corrosion, prevention of fluid contamination,<br>
absence or presence of catalytic reaction, the build-up of electrical charge and/or the<br>
presence of electrical currents, biocompatibility.<br>
Procedures to achieve the permanent connection between the material layer 105 and<br>
the two sides 101,103 include bonding or gluing as known in the art (lamination, hot<br>
bonding, UV bonding, plasma treatment of the surfaces, solvent bonding, pressure adhesive,<br>
heat adhesives). The bonding procedure may exploit polymer foils treated with thermoset<br>
films on both sides. Such foils are commercially available and currently produced for<br>
printed circuit boards. In addition, various materials suitable as a base are available off-the-<br>
shelf, including carbon-black loaded polyester and black Mylar. In a first illustrative<br>
embodiment, the material layer 105 shows no internal structure, obviating the need for any<br>
alignment of the material layer 105 with respect to the sides 101,103.<br>
B. SIDES<br>
With continuing reference to FIG. 1, the sides 101,103 comprise the microfluidic<br>
components of the disks, containing the fluids. Depressions within one surface of the<br>
substrate forming the sides 101,103 form the microfluidic components. Meso-scale<br>
components and channels, also referred to as capillaries or micro-capillaries, may be<br>
provided by a variety of techniques known in the art, including engraving, fluoric acid wet<br>
etching, embossing, hot embossing, micro-machining, laser ablation, mechanical machining<br>
or polymer moulding.<br>
It is contemplated within the scope of the invention that microfluidic components<br>
such as chambers and channels may be formed by the printing of such components upon a<br>
substrate, wherein such printed components and substrate form the sides 101, 103 of the<br>
inventive disk. The printing of microfluidic structures can be achieved by silk screening<br>
printing techniques or other printing techniques known in the art.<br>
Each meso-scale component includes a volume, able to contain fluids, with<br>
dimensions preferably in the sub-micron to millimetre range. In an illustrative embodiment,<br>
the meso-scale components are understood as open components engraved or printed on the<br>
surface of the sides 101,103 and facing the material layer 105. The sides 101,103 may<br>
further comprise additional fluid connections and components, including dedicated input<br>
and output ports to allow the fluids to reach the meso-scale network, instruments, batteries,<br>
electrical connections and other instrumentation. Suitable materials for the sides 101,103<br>
include glass, quartz, monomers, silicon, polymers, acrylic plastics, and polycarbonates,<br>
cyclic olefin copolymers (COC). It is contemplated within the scope of the invention that<br>
the sides 101,103 may integrate optical and electrical components, including motors,<br>
conductors, chips, lenses and. prisms. It is also contemplated within the scope of the<br>
invention that the surfaces in contact with the material layer 105 may be modified, in<br>
particular to have different optical properties allowing for the focusing of the pickup onto<br>
the material layer 105.<br>
It is contemplated within the scope of the invention to have disks with sides totally<br>
sealed, where gases in contact with fluids cannot exit from the device. This characteristic<br>
can be exploited to handle high toxicity chemicals or radioactive fluids., and allows<br>
performing operations with disks in vacuum, or in general when the external pressure is<br>
different from the internal pressure (pressurized reactions).<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, the sides 101,103 forming the disk are<br>
substantially transparent or selected portions thereof are transparent to wavelengths of light<br>
corresponding to the pickup wavelength. According to the invention optical lenses and<br>
optical components may be embedded within the sides 101,103 to direct a light wavelength<br>
to a desired valving area within the microfluidic network. It is contemplated within the<br>
scope of the invention that there is a different refraction index of the side with respect to the<br>
material layer 105, in order to allow optical detection of the interface surface by reflection<br>
of the pickup light emission or for a better compatibility with the fluids present in the<br>
microfluidic components.<br>
Additional requirements of the sides 101,103 depend on the application, including<br>
interaction or contamination of the fluids in the device and optical properties affecting the<br>
study of the fluids in the device and their reactions. In addition, cost and ease of mass<br>
production are also considered.<br>
THE PICKUP<br>
The pickup includes an optical means to irradiate the material layer or layers of the<br>
disk at the pickup wavelength. In one illustrative embodiment, a laser source whose tight<br>
emission is focussed, by optical elements (for example) and through one side of the disk,<br>
onto a focal point located inside the material layer or on the material layer near to it is<br>
contemplated. According to the invention, a requirement for the pickup is the ability to<br>
concentrate or focus a sufficient amount of electromagnetic energy on a sufficiently small<br>
surface area of the base. Accordingly, a basic operation of the present invention is the<br>
perforation of the material layer at a specific time and position, induced by irradiation<br>
provided by the pickup. The preferred wavelengths for the emission are in the infrared,<br>
visible, and ultra-violet parts of the spectrum. Wavelengths within the infrared region are<br>
desirable since most biological samples - including cells - and fluids used in the biological<br>
domain do not absorb near infrared radiation and therefore are not substantially affected by<br>
infrared irradiation.<br>
The laser emission may be achieved by means of compact and low-cost laser diodes,<br>
with commercially available diodes spanning a large range of frequencies, starting from and<br>
above 375 nm. The largest power available in current laser diodes for commercial compact<br>
disk readers is about 200 mW. The highest intensity achieved by this technology is in the<br>
near infrared region. In an illustrative embodiment the laser diode used is an OSRAM<br>
PL90_3, made by Osraxn. In yet a further illustrative embodiment the laser diode used is a<br>
JDS SDL-6380A made by JDS Uniphase. While the JDS diode has a lower peak power<br>
than the OSRAM diode, its better heat dissipation, smaller slit size, narrower far field<br>
emission and larger maximum pulse width allows for better performance. It is<br>
contemplated within the scope of the invention that other sources such as q-switched lasers,<br>
diode pulsed solid state lasers (D.PSS), carbon dioxide lasers, Titanium Sapphire lasers fibre<br>
lasers, excimer lasers, flash lamps, gas discharge or the like may be used.<br>
According to the invention, the laser diode operates in a substantially pulsed mode.<br>
The pulse geometry is selectable to deliver desired energies to intended targets and allows<br>
the instantaneous power to be significantly larger, provided that the operational duty cycle<br>
is short enough to allow appropriate cooling of the laser junction. Commercial laser diodes<br>
with peak power output reaching up to about 70W are available and even higher peak rates<br>
are possible with more expensive solutions.<br>
An aspect of using very short pulses is that the minute energy deposited in the base<br>
is hardly transferred to the samples and to the surroundings area. The heat wave propagates<br>
away from the perforation spot with a finite speed. During a short pulse with high intensity,<br>
the outgoing energy flow can be smaller than the ingoing energy flow, the energy remains<br>
therefore concentrated in a limited spot, with a steep rise in localized temperature rapidly<br>
producing perforation with efficacy.<br>
Optical focusing is typically achieved by a single optical system composed of few<br>
optical elements. To achieve optimal collimation and alignment of the beam onto the base,<br>
one element may be moved in different directions, for instance by means of electric coils<br>
immersed in a magnetic field. Optimisation of the optical path has been made by taking<br>
into account the disk exposure requirements. The side's thickness can introduce significant<br>
coma and astigmatism, which is sometimes difficult to correct when small spots are<br>
envisaged.<br>
In an illustrative embodiment, the optical system is comprised of a f=6mm MG<br>
GLC001 collector lens, a LiteOn CD pickup (NA=0.45) by LiteOn, with a real focus in<br>
between the two systems at 25 mm from the CD lens front face. This particular<br>
configuration collects onto the base a light intensity of about 16 µJ in about 10 us exposure.<br>
The effective power density of this configuration has proven to be perfectly sufficient for<br>
perforation of various material layers. By means of a pinhole and a pyrometer PEM 100 by<br>
Lasertechnik Berlin of Germany, it was possible to estimate and optimize the amount of<br>
optical energy effectively collimated onto the focal spot onto the base.<br>
The above configuration provides that the pickup structure implemented in<br>
commercially available CD devices, with applications in audio, video and computer data<br>
storage, may be applied to the present invention, and that focusing the laser onto the base is<br>
possible by processing the fraction of light reflected at the base surface with an appropriate<br>
optical system.<br>
In another illustrative embodiment, the pickup may contain two or more light<br>
sources, only one of which is used to perforate the base. The focusing of the lens and the<br>
determination of the pickup position is obtained through a different source which can be a<br>
low power, continuous or quasi-continuum (QCW) wave emission. The use of multiple<br>
light sources allows choosing a base that absorbs the radiation meant to perforate the base,<br>
and reflect the radiation meant to determine the base position through the same optical<br>
system.<br>
The pickup device may further include an optical system for determining if the<br>
focussing of the electromagnetic radiation onto the base is achieved. For example, partial<br>
reflectivity of the base may be used as an optical feedback mechanism if analysed through a<br>
Foucault (astigmatic) focussing system. Such a system has been implemented in<br>
commercially available optical readers for CD and DVD media.<br>
The pickup in the present invention is similar to devices used to manipulate<br>
microscopic objects by means of a focussed light beam. This operation, also known as<br>
tweezing, allows one to hold and move single objects using the electromagnetic forces<br>
generated by a light wave front, which is substantially convergent or divergent.<br>
It is contemplated within the scope of the invention mat the pickup of the present<br>
invention may be a device serving one or more distinct purposes including, for example, the<br>
control of the fluidic process by perforation of a material layer, tweezing of particles and<br>
optical analysis of the samples contained in the microfluidic components. It should be also<br>
noted that the pickup does not have contact with the microfluidic device. This potential can<br>
be exploited in those applications where contamination has to be absolutely avoided, for<br>
example forensic analysis of samples (contamination from the outside to the inside) or<br>
handling toxic or radioactive fluids (contamination from the inside to the outside).<br>
MATERIAL LAYER PERFORATION TO OPEN A VALVE<br>
Microfluidic handling in the present invention is regulated and performed through<br>
the dynamic, real-time configuration of a microfluidic network. This configuration is<br>
achieved by putting into fluid communication microfluidic components within sides of the<br>
disk on opposite sides of a material layer. This connection may be used either by a fluid<br>
moving from one microfluidic component to a second one or by two fluids coming into<br>
contact in specific places. The former is referred to as a flow valve, the second as contact<br>
establishment.<br>
Turning to FIG 2A-2E, the connection of two or more microfluidic components is<br>
shown. To achieve fluid communication, the following operations are performed: The<br>
pickup (not shown) or the disk 200 is positioned such that an electromagnetic radiation<br>
emission 206 is directed at a position of the material layer 205 where perforation is to occur.<br>
This may be achieved by moving either the disk 200, or the pickup, or both; The focusing<br>
system, if present, is adjusted to minimize the spot size and concentrate the energy onto the<br>
material layer 205 in the position of perforation; Electromagnetic radiation of sufficient<br>
intensity is generated by the pickup and directed onto the material layer 205 that is<br>
positioned between microfluidic components within the top side 201 and bottom side 203 of<br>
the disk 200. The intensity of such radiation, its limited time duration and its limited spatial<br>
application prevents or substantially avoids alteration of fluids 207 (or samples) within the<br>
microfluidic network. The energy deposition, specifically, the fraction of energy absorbed<br>
by the material layer 205, causes perforation (also referred to as drilling) of the material<br>
layer 205.<br>
The forces acting on the fluid 207, in a preferred embodiment a centripetal force,<br>
cause the fluid 207 to flow from the microfluidic component in one side to the microfluidic<br>
component in the other side through the point of perforation 208. The point of perforation<br>
208 and the resulting opening is referred to as a virtual laser valve (VLV). This typically<br>
allows the fluid 207 to access the next step or merge with the adjoining fluidic chamber or<br>
channel in the microfluidic network.<br>
The drilling of the base or perforation occurs via different physical phenomena,<br>
including ablation and melting, or through the breaking or relaxation of molecular bonds.<br>
Their relative importance depends on the energy density, the pickup wavelength, the time<br>
duration of the pulse, the composition of the material layer, the polarization of the<br>
electromagnetic radiation, phenomena of heat dissipation in an irradiated body, the<br>
development of plasma waves, and the presence of materials neighbouring the point of<br>
perforation zone. Ablation specifically refers to the rapid process where the heat wave<br>
ejects the material that is vaporised into plasma. Melting occurs through an intermediate<br>
state of liquid phase, unavoidably leading to partial transfer of heat from the illuminated<br>
area to the sides.<br>
Both ablation and melting may produce a gas, like CO2, for example, when hitting a<br>
polymer, with additional small solid deposits. Both processes are industrially used for a<br>
number of commercial applications, including micro-mechanical devices (MEMS), polymer<br>
laser drilling and cutting, metal drilling and cutting, and surface treatment by ablation. A<br>
substantial and growing experience with excimer lasers, for example by Lambda-Physik,<br>
shows that the potential of ultra-violet laser emission may allow achievement of a high<br>
quality perforation by direct breakage of the molecular bonds. This type of drilling achieves<br>
high resolution and high quality drilling, which may be of substantial benefit to the present<br>
invention to achieve a large integration scale of the microfhiidic components onto a disk.<br>
Because the perforation volume is small, compared to the dimensions of the<br>
microfhiidic components in the sides, the overall amount of material scattered by opening a<br>
valve is negligible and does not substantially impact or alter fluids in the microfluidic<br>
components. The pickup is protected from the blast of material since it occurs within the<br>
sides. As described here, the perforation process is generally irreversible: the material layer<br>
205 is removed upon perforation when opening the valve. According to the invention, the<br>
material layer 205 generally cannot be recovered to restore the valve to its closed state.<br>
Nevertheless, the present invention may be applied to configurations where the valve may<br>
be closed. One such configuration includes a case where a polymer in the Uquid phase,<br>
which can allow the flow of gases, polymerizes at the position of perforation or in another<br>
position connected to the circuit in a gas tight manner to impede gas flow or fluid<br>
movement. A similar result can be achieved by thermoset materials and fibrin glue, or other<br>
2-components sealing agents. A different implementation of an open-to-close transition<br>
makes use of a Tesla valve, which can be opened by opening a valve. The Tesla valve<br>
increases the impedance of the fluid flow, effectively achieving the result of blocking the<br>
fluid flow in one given direction.<br>
The optical characteristics of the material layer 205 and the sides 201,203 determine<br>
both the modality of energy deposition and the requirements of the electromagnetic<br>
radiation provided by the pickup. Material layers 205 formed from polymers are<br>
advantageous because of their low enthalpy: the energy required to transform a polymer<br>
from the solid to the liquid state is typically smaller than that required in the case of metals.<br>
Consequently, smaller energy density is sufficient for perforation. Conversely, the sides<br>
201, 203 should be as transparent as possible at the pickup wavelength, with optical<br>
properties such that the focussed pickup emission is not scattered before arriving at the base<br>
surface nor absorbed leading to heating up of the side material or adjacent fluids. Effects to<br>
be considered include bi-refringence, optical quality of the surface, and uniformity of the<br>
optical thickness. Various polymers, including the polycarbonates used in compact disk<br>
applications, are substantially transparent in the entire visible spectrum as well as the near<br>
infrared, and in addition, show good optical quality of the surfaces.<br>
Components of the invention such as disks, chambers, channels, filters and their<br>
respective optical characteristics are advantageously provided having a variety of<br>
composition and surface coatings appropriate for a particular application. Component<br>
composition will be a function of structural requirements, manufacturing processes, and<br>
reagent compatibility/chemical resistance properties, including biocompatibility.<br>
Specifically, components of the invention such as sides are provided that are made<br>
from inorganic crystalline or amorphous materials, e.g. silicon, silica, quartz, or from<br>
organic materials such as plastics, for example, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),<br>
acetonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polycarbonate, polyethylene, polystyrene, polyolefin,<br>
polypropylene, fluoropolymer and metallocene. Thermoset materials, like SUS and PDMS<br>
are a viable solution. Surface properties of these materials may be modified for specific<br>
applications. Surface modification can be achieved by methods known in the art that<br>
include but are not limited to silanization, ion implantation and chemical treatment with<br>
inert-gas plasmas (i.e., gases through which electrical currents are passed to create<br>
ionization). Similar processes could be applied to the material layer for a complete<br>
treatment of the surfaces in contact with the fluids.<br>
It is contemplated within the scope of the invention that components of the disk may<br>
be made of composites, co-polymers or combinations of these materials, for example,<br>
components manufactured of a plastic material having embedded therein an optically<br>
transparent glass surface comprising for example the detection chamber of the disk or lenses<br>
and mirrors for directing electromagnetic radiation to a valving area within the material<br>
layer in order to perforate such layer.<br>
Disks of the invention and their respective components are preferably fabricated<br>
from thermoplastics such as Teflon, polyethylene, polypropylene, methylmethacrylate and<br>
polycarbonates, among others, due to their ease of moulding, stamping and milling.<br>
Alternatively, such components can be made of silica, glass, quartz, or thermoset materials.<br>
A micro analytical fluid handling system according to the invention is fabricated by<br>
sequential application of one or more of these materials laid down onto the thermoplastic<br>
substrate. Disks of the invention may be fabricated with an injection moulded, optically-<br>
clear base layer or sides having optical pits in the manner of a conventional compact disk<br>
(CD). It is contemplated within the scope of the invention that other methods of fabrication<br>
or manufacture known in the art may be used. It is further contemplated that microfluidic<br>
chips using the inventive valving may be manufactured by this same sequential application<br>
of materials.<br>
At the time of perforation of the material layer, fluid may be present adjacent to or in<br>
contact with the material layer above, below, or on both sides. In that case, energy<br>
deposited by or generated during the perforation process may be transferred to the fluid.<br>
Except for very rare configurations, the energy transfer is negligible compared to the heat<br>
capacity of the fluid. It is contemplated within the scope of the invention that a valve can be<br>
opened with an optical energy of less than 16 µJ. If all energy that goes into the base<br>
ablation were absorbed by one microlitre of water, its temperature would increase by about<br>
0.002 degrees Celsius only.<br>
According to the invention, by changing the time duration of the pulse or the<br>
focusing properties of the pickup, the valve diameter can be modified, and this feature can<br>
be effectively used in applications where fluid flow regulation is necessary, for example in<br>
mixture control, or where fluidic motion resistance (including its mixing) is affected<br>
differently by valves of different size.<br>
It is contemplated within the scope of the invention that for microfluidic<br>
configurations and applications where sample or fluids are adversely impacted by thermal<br>
changes, heat sinks or cooling faces of heat pumps may be incorporated into the<br>
microfluidic network to compensate for any such thermal changes.<br>
MULTIPLEXING OPERATIONS<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the arbitrary position of the valve is exploited<br>
to implement logic for the flow of fluids. This can be implemented at any moment during<br>
the process as performed in the microfluidic apparatus, a feature referred to as real-time<br>
capability. Of particular interest is the logic scheme depending on the outcome of a<br>
previous operation. A microfluidic component that can perform this operation in the most<br>
generic way is hereafter denominated a multiplexer, analogous to the component in digital<br>
electronics with equivalent functionality.<br>
FIG. 3A illustrates one embodiment of the multiplexer, which includes a matrix of N<br>
input capillaries 303 on one side of the disk facing M output capillaries 305 on the other<br>
side of the disk. In the following, two fluidic components are considered to be facing one<br>
another when they are separated by the base only, in at least one position. The multiplexer<br>
therefore allows one or more of a set of inputs to be in fluid communication with one or<br>
more of a set of outputs. A set of capillaries is to be understood as two or more capillaries.<br>
The simplest case is shown in FIG. 3 A, where the opening of a valve in a first<br>
position 301 connects a first input capillary 306 with a first output capillary 308. After fluid<br>
communication has been enabled, the actual passage of fluid from the input capillary 306 to<br>
the output capillary 308 may be achieved by applying a force on the fluid. Examples of<br>
such force include spinning a centripetal device, exerting an overpressure in the input<br>
capillary line 306, or exerting an underpressure in the output capillary line 308. A proper<br>
venting design (not shown in the figure) ensures adequate escape for air contained in the<br>
fluidic components downstream from the moving fluid.<br>
The extension of multiplexing to higher levels of complexity may be achieved using<br>
a multiplicity of valves at the crossing points in the matrix of facing capillaries. The valves<br>
enable fluid communication between the desired input and output capillaries.<br>
Except to provide connections between a number of inputs to a number of outputs,<br>
the multiplexer may equally well be used to connect a number of inputs to a single output or<br>
a single input to a number of outputs. Since such connections do not by itself guarantee<br>
homogenous mixing in the first case or uniform distribution in the second case, the possible<br>
limitation may be somewhat mitigated by adjusting the time at which the different valves<br>
involved are operated, by preceding the multiplexing stage by appropriate volumetric<br>
quantitation, or by introducing intermediate multiplexing networks.<br>
The multiplexer is primarily intended for use in a programmable device (such as the<br>
one described in the present invention) and to be an interconnecting network between<br>
different components of a microfluidic device. If a large number of input channels are to be<br>
connected to a large number of output channels, though not in all possible combinations, the<br>
physical size of the multiplexing network may be reduced by breaking it down in different<br>
stages with relatively lower integration.<br>
In an illustrative embodiment, the combined functionality of the dosimeter and of<br>
the multiplexer is shown with reference to Fig. 3B. In this embodiment, a disk according to<br>
the invention is equipped with input wells 312,313,314. The input wells 312, 313, 314 are<br>
in fluid communication with a multiplexing matrix layer 316. The multiplexing matrix<br>
layer 316 is comprised of a grid of fluidic channels that are fluidly connected to dosimeter<br>
units 317 (here schematically represented as all having the same dimensions). The<br>
dosimeter units 317 are in fluid communication with segmented (separated) multiplexing<br>
units 318 that are in fluid communication with reactor chambers 310,311.<br>
In this scheme, for clarity of explanation, the venting lines are not drawn, even if<br>
they are an essential requirement in order to allow the fluid moving into a component filled<br>
with gas (air or any other inert gas sealed in the device at manufacturing).<br>
This illustrative embodiment represents a generic microfluidic layout to perform a<br>
homogeneous assay. This assay can be used for the measurement of compound inhibition in<br>
an enzymatic reaction on a substrate, where the reaction kinetics (inhibition) is measured in<br>
real-time, by detecting the fluorescence emission polarization of convenient dyes. It is<br>
contemplated within the scope of the invention that many other assays known in the art may<br>
be used without substantial modification to the device configuration.<br>
With continuing reference to FIG. 3B, an enzyme is pipetted into the input well 314,<br>
a substrate is pipetted into the input well 313 and a compound of interest is inserted into the<br>
input well 312. Knowledge of the pipetted amount is not required, and the choice of the<br>
input wells is totally arbitrary. The opening of valve 320 and valve 321 according to the<br>
invention allows the distribution the compound of interests into one dosimeter arbitrarily<br>
chosen. At the same time, more dosimeters can be used in order to perform parallel<br>
operation, and for example the compound is also diverted by opening valve 322 into another<br>
dosimeter connected to a different multiplexing segment in layer 317. With a similar<br>
operation, the appropriate substrate contained in the input well 313 is diverted into another<br>
dosimeter by opening valves 323 and 324, and the enzyme from input well 314 is taken to<br>
the dosimeter layer by opening valves 325 and 326.<br>
The correspondence between input wells and dosimeters is defined by the user in<br>
real time, and allows matching in optimal way the dosimeter to the reagents according to the<br>
amount of fluid expected to be quantitated and the dosimeter volume.<br>
The purging of the dosimeters occurs by directing into a waste reservoir the filled<br>
dosimeters opening valves 322, 330,331 on the dosimeter layer, valves 341, 346, 349 on<br>
the segmented multiplexing layer, and valve 347 that determines the reactor 311 to be the<br>
waste reactor where fluids are consequently collected. It is contemplated within the scope<br>
of the invention that the inventive microfluidic disk can be configured so that no fluid exits<br>
from the microfluidic structure.<br>
The actual assay is performed by dispensing the required amount of substrate in<br>
reactor 310, the amount being determined by the choice of the position of valve 340 and the<br>
choice of the reactor determined by the opening of valves 342 and 343. At any moment<br>
decided by the user, the compound and the enzyme can be added to the same reactor by<br>
opening, with the same logic, 348 and 350, 344 and 345.<br>
It is evident that - by opening other valves - another reactor in the reactor layer<br>
could be filled by different amounts of the same reagents, or the reagents (for example the<br>
compound or the substrate) could be replaced by others stored in the input wells to have<br>
different reactions tested and measured. Even the reaction protocol (order of dispensing for<br>
example) could be different for different reactors.<br>
Despite the apparent complexity, all operations have been reduced to a single<br>
process, which is the opening of a valve on the material layer at a desired location.<br>
The procedure is independent of the type of fluids involved, and is constantly in<br>
control of the user at any time during the process. For example, the addition of a stopping<br>
agent after the reaction has started could be decided according to the data from the<br>
fluorescent readout.<br>
VOLUMETRIC QUANTITATION<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, an arbitrary position of the valve is<br>
exploited to perform volumetric quantitation ofliquids in centripetal microfluidic<br>
components. The corresponding fluidic component will hereafter be referred to as a<br>
dosimeter 400.<br>
FIG. 4 depicts an illustrative embodiment for the dosimeter 400. It consists of an<br>
elongated reservoir 401 with the longest axis substantially positioned in the radial direction<br>
of the centripetal device. Along this axis, a portion of the device closer to the rotation axis<br>
will be referred to as upper, and the portion further from the centre of rotation will be<br>
referred to as lower. The shape and volume of the dosimeter are designed according to an<br>
amount of fluid to be quantitated and a desired resolution in the quantitation process.<br>
According to the invention, fluid is filled into the reservoir 401 through an inlet in the upper<br>
part (not shown), and a venting line 402 is present to allow the fluid to enter.<br>
Turning to FIG. 5A to 5G, when the device is rotated, the centripetal force causes<br>
the fluid to move into the lower part of the reservoir 501 as shown in FIG 5A. The<br>
capillaries indicated as 503 and 504 constitute two different outputs of the dosimeter 500.<br>
One of the capillary outputs, 503 in the specific case, is used as a purge line. Output lines<br>
are situated in the side opposite to the side containing the dosimeter, separated from it only<br>
by the material layer. The overall number of output lines depends on the specific<br>
application or implementation.<br>
The first operation of the quantitation process consists in evacuating part of a liquid<br>
505 to be metered into the purge line 503. This evacuation is achieved by opening a valve<br>
510 by perforating the material layer in first position 510, and spinning the centripetal<br>
device to achieve this result. Any liquid 505 above the level defined by the valve 510, as a<br>
consequence of the applied centripetal force, flows into the purge line 503 and eventually<br>
into a first purging chamber 512. The liquid 505 remaining within the reservoir 501 forms a<br>
meniscus 514 as depicted in FIG 5C.<br>
The extraction of a defined volume of liquid 505 from the reservoir 501 may be<br>
performed by creating a second valve 515 in correspondence of the second capillary 504<br>
line that puts into fluid communication the reservoir 501 with the second capillary line 504.<br>
The liquid contained in the dosimeter between the first valve 510 and a second valve 515 is<br>
extracted in the second capillary line 504 by spinning the centripetal device and applying<br>
centripetal force. The position of the valve in relation to the meniscus 514 within the<br>
reservoir 501 and the knowledge of the reservoir's 501 geometrical shape, allows the<br>
determination of the volume of liquid extracted into second capillary line 504 which flows<br>
into a second metered chamber 516.<br>
As highlighted in position 514 of the figure, liquids in meso-scale fluidic<br>
components generally display a. significant meniscus 514, i.e. the upper level of the liquid<br>
will not typically be flat. This behaviour varies among liquids and depends on surface<br>
tension, hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of materials, thus making the shape of the<br>
meniscus unpredictable. It is a benefit of the present invention that the volumetric<br>
quantitation is substantially independent of knowledge concerning the meniscus shape. The<br>
same liquid, in the same geometrical conditions and in contact with the same materials, will<br>
exhibit the same meniscus shape, rendering the quantitation process independent of the<br>
meniscus shape.<br>
A single dosimeter may be used for various liquid extractions on the same output<br>
line. FIG. 5F shows how opening an additional valve, in third position 520, allows the<br>
extraction of a second volume of liquid into the next step of the microfluidic network. The<br>
second metered amount is sent to the metered chamber 516 as shown in FIG. 5G. This is<br>
called the multi-spill capability of the dosimeter.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is the multi-output capability of a single<br>
dosimeter. The same dosimeter may serve various output lines, so that the same liquid may<br>
be sent to an output by opening a valve in an appropriate position connecting the dosimeter<br>
to the mentioned output line.<br>
Quantitation may occur in real-time at the same time as fluid processing. For<br>
example, the multi-output capability of the dosimeter may be used to keep the pH of a<br>
reaction constant, by subsequent extraction of an acid or of a base, according to feedback<br>
provided by the reaction itself while the reaction occurs.<br>
Another application of the dosimeter is in the phase separation of fluids by means of<br>
centrifugation. For example, blood can be separated into its components (plasma,<br>
lymphocytes and erythrocytes) by means of centrifugation and possibly additional reagents<br>
(sucrose or Ficoll by Amersham for example) inside a dosimeter. The opening of valves<br>
near or at the separation interfaces allows the separation into different outputs of the<br>
dosimeter of the various components, in an adaptive way. Similar separation can be<br>
performed on fluids containing cells or lysates, on emulsions or on suspensions of particles.<br>
The capability of dispensing amounts of fluids when desired by the user has also an<br>
active role in mixing. For example, the dissolution of a solid phase chemical entity into a<br>
solvent depends on its concentration in the liquid phase. It is possible to dispense an amount<br>
of fluid into a "siphon" shaped capillary where the exceeding liquid exits from a position<br>
located at an inner radius. The amount of liquid can be left in contact with the solid phase<br>
solute for an amount of time sufficient to allow diffusion to occur. Then, by means of the<br>
valve, an additional amount of fluid can displace the previous solvent, remaining in place<br>
for additional dissolution of the solid phase but with a reduced initial solute concentration.<br>
This operation can be repeated various times for repetitive dilution of the solid phase<br>
chemical entity.<br>
REDIRECTION IN A CENTRIPETAL DEVICE<br>
A common problem in centripetal devices, especially if complex processes are<br>
implemented, is related to the uni-directionality of the centripetal force. Given a fixed<br>
rotation axis, the fluids move only from inner to outer positions, and the process terminates<br>
when the position of the fluid reaches the outer edge of the centripetal device. This feature<br>
excludes the use of centripetal devices in cases where the process to be accomplished<br>
comprises a large number of steps. Here, as in the following, the "radial position of a mass<br>
of liquid" denotes the radial position of the centre of mass of the liquid.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the above limitation is overcome by an<br>
appropriate arrangement of the inventive valves within a microfluidic circuit. The process<br>
of moving a sample liquid from an outer to an inner radial position by means of the<br>
centripetal force itself is referred to as reflow. The required energy is obtained at the<br>
expense of the potential energy of another mass of fluid, hereafter called buffer fluid, whose<br>
only purpose is to provide energy for the reflow process. The mass of buffer fluid can be<br>
placed at any radius on the disk, and the buffer fluid can have any density. Overall energy<br>
conservation constraints link the characteristics of buffer and sample liquids, specifically<br>
the respective volume, density, initial radial position, and final radial position of buffer and<br>
sample liquids. Another possibility for reflow consists in making use of additional sources<br>
of energy like differences of pneumatic pressure or chemical energy. In a way similar to the<br>
one described in the next section "fluid transport activated by a valve", a bottle could be<br>
actuated in order to push or pull the liquid towards an inner part of the disk. The pneumatic<br>
overpressure or underpressure, for example, could be generated by the centripetal force<br>
itself by having a mass of liquid, compressing or decompressing a gas volume. In this case,<br>
the energy could be stored by avoid the fluid to move back when the centripetal force is<br>
reduced, for example by having a Tesla valve or similar functional device onto the path of<br>
the liquid. The stored energy can then be recollected in a later moment when the centripetal<br>
acceleration has been reduced, and used to reflow the sample fluid.<br>
An illustrative embodiment of the reflow method consists of the following steps, as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 6: The buffer fluid 601 is loaded in a reservoir 602. To the extent that the<br>
buffer fluid 601 does not participate in any reaction or process, the liquid used is<br>
independent of the use of the disk. Accordingly, buffer loading may be performed at the<br>
disk-manufacturing phase. An important requirement is for the reservoir 602 to be gas-<br>
tight, i.e. sealed to prevent air or gas to freely enter or exit. The sample liquid 610 flows<br>
into a sample reservoir 612 through position 613. For this operation, the sample reservoir<br>
612 requires a venting line 614. In these conditions, the sample liquid 610 generally cannot<br>
flow through the capillary 615 since the presence of air - trapped below the liquid mass -<br>
impedes the flow of the liquid into it even if valve 616 would be already open.<br>
The opening of a first valve 603 along the fluid communication circuit enables fluid<br>
communication between reservoirs 602 and 612 if valves 617 and 618 are already open<br>
Where appropriate, an additional reservoir 622 referred to as a trap, can serve to collect the<br>
sample liquid 610. When fluid communication is enabled, it does not by itself lead to a<br>
movement of the fluids, because the potential energy is at a local minimum, with the buffer<br>
fluid 601 prevented from flowing into a second capillary 604. The buffer fluid 601 and the<br>
sample fluid 610 are integral elements to guarantee the gas-tightness of the fluid<br>
communication circuit, and the reservoirs 602, 612 are designed to maintain this gas-<br>
tightness up to the end of the process. Opening a second valve in position 605 enables the<br>
reflow operation. The reflow operation is initiated by spinning the centripetal device,<br>
thereby exerting on buffer liquid 601 and sample liquid 610 a force proportional to their<br>
mass and to the acceleration a=w2*r, where omega is the angular velocity of the device and r<br>
the radial position of the liquid, neglecting Coriolis forces.<br>
The movement of the buffer fluid 601 into capillary 604 causes a reduction in the<br>
gas pressure in the fluid communication circuit. For appropriate kinematical conditions,<br>
this results in a suction force, pulling the sample liquid 610 from position 615 into the trap<br>
capillary 623, and moving the gas contained in the trap 622 into the reservoir 602 through a<br>
reservoir capillary 624. Suction is the process whereby a force is exerted upon a liquid<br>
body by reason of reduced gas pressure over a portion of its surface.<br>
When the sample liquid 61.0 reaches the trap 622, the centripetal force causes it to<br>
move towards the bottom part of the trap 622. The suction of the reservoir capillary 624 is<br>
not exerted on the sample liquid 610, but on the gas above the liquid mass, so that the<br>
sample liquid 610 contained in the trap 622 does not enter into reservoir capillary 624.<br>
When the entire sample liquid 610 has been sucked into the trap 622, the<br>
communication circuit is no longer gas-tight and atmospheric pressure, through the venting<br>
line 614 or through the input line 613, enters into reservoir 612, trap capillary 623, trap 622,<br>
reservoir capillary 624, and reservoir 602. At this moment, with the centripetal device still<br>
spinning, the buffer fluid moves completely into the exit capillary 604 and the final state of<br>
the reflow operation consists of the sample liquid 610 having moved from reservoir 612 to<br>
the trap reservoir 622.<br>
The reflow operation allows longer processes to be performed in a given centripetal<br>
device. With the trap reservoir 622 at a smaller radial position than the sample reservoir<br>
612, a long process may be broken down as follows: the first series of steps may be<br>
performed by moving liquids from an inner to an outer radial position, comparable to<br>
sample reservoir 612, reflow is then applied to bring the liquid to the trap reservoir 622, at<br>
which point the remainder of the process may be performed, moving again from an inner to<br>
an outer radial position. The number of reflow operations is generally limited only by the<br>
amount of buffer liquid that is loaded onto the disk and its radial position.<br>
The relative radial positions of the sample reservoir 612 and buffer reservoir 602,<br>
and of the trap reservoir 622, are arbitrary. However, a given set of relative radial positions<br>
will determine the minimum mass of buffer liquid for a given mass of sample liquid. The<br>
choice of radial positions may be driven by the required configuration of input and output<br>
ports. For example, input ports may be distributed in a rectangular shape array covering the<br>
top side of the disk, and buffer liquid reservoirs may be used to reflow the input liquids into<br>
traps located at the minimal radial positions available on the disk. Typically, the minimal<br>
radius accessible corresponds to the circumference around the spindle support. The output<br>
of the process, generally available at maximal radial positions, may be transported with the<br>
same reflow procedure into an array uniformly distributed on the top surface of the device,<br>
including the same array used as input.<br>
A functionality similar to reflow, that can be assimilated to reflow, consists in<br>
washing steps during a biological or chemical protocol. The washing procedure is<br>
performed by aspiration of the liquid contained in a reservoir of appropriate shape towards<br>
the inner part of the disk, so that the reservoir, after washing, can still be filled with other<br>
liquids that do not flow out. This procedure is particularly relevant for the execution of<br>
heterogeneous assays, and can be performed by a variant of the reflow method already<br>
explained. It is contemplated within the scope of the invention that the buffer fluid 601 can<br>
be either liquid or gas.<br>
POSITIONING SYSTEM OF THE PICKUP<br>
One aspect of the present invention concerns the setting and knowledge of the<br>
pickup position, at a given time, with respect to the disk reference frame. This position may<br>
be decomposed as a focussing position, a polar position and a radial position. These<br>
directions are the cylindrical coordinates of the pickup head in the reference frame of the<br>
rotating disk, with the rotation axis corresponding to the cylinder axis.<br>
The focussing movement of the pickup head, relative to the base surface, has already<br>
been described and can be achieved by "voice coil" movement of the focussing optics or of<br>
one of the light sources or of any other optical element. Indeed, the focussing mechanism<br>
employed in standard compact disk drivers performs this operation, together with a fine-<br>
tuning movement of the lens in the radial direction.<br>
Radial positioning of the pickup may be achieved by means of the previously<br>
mentioned voice coil, together with a coarse displacement of the pickup assembly.<br>
Different types of motors, including linear motors, DC motors, servomotors, and stepper<br>
motors, may achieve this displacement. Rotating the disk around its axis performs polar<br>
positioning at a given moment of the pickup.<br>
One conventional solution includes using high-resolution optical encoders: a rotary<br>
encoder for the polar position and a linear encoder for the radial position. In addition,<br>
digitally encoded information in the radial and polar directions, stored onto the disk, may be<br>
used to determine where the spot is directed following art, each of which is incorporated by<br>
reference. Gordon (US 6,327,031, US 22085202A1) teaches an apparatus and method for<br>
carrying out analysis of samples; Virtanen (US 6,030,581) teaches a laboratory in a disk;<br>
and<br>
Mian et al. (US2001/0055812A1) teaches devices and methods for using centripetal<br>
acceleration to drive fluid movement in a microfluidics system with on-board informatics.<br>
In one illustrative embodiment of the present invention a method to determine the<br>
radial and polar position of the pickup head is provided. Specifically, in the reference frame<br>
of the disk, the radial and polar position are determined using timing information, as<br>
measured from the occurrence of a signal from the pickup induced by markers, of the<br>
rotating device. The pickup measures (as in commercial CD driver pickups) the light<br>
reflected from the scanned surface;.<br>
A marker generally is a line on the base with specific optical properties, with a polar<br>
position varying as a function of the radius. Examples of specific optical properties are<br>
higher or lower reflectivity compared to the area around the marker. The marker may also<br>
be situated on a side, and may include a capillary filled with a liquid with peculiar optical<br>
properties - defined as including reflectivity, absorption or fluorescent emission. The<br>
change in reflectivity may be detected and provides a signal whose time may be recorded.<br>
This is referred to as the time of a marker signal in the present invention.<br>
If the rotational speed of the device is constant over at least one rotation period, the<br>
marker signal offers a precision measurement of the rotational period of the disk and<br>
therefore of its instantaneous rotational speed. The time elapsed from the occurrence of a<br>
marker signal divided by the rotation period, is in itself the measurement of the polar<br>
position of the pickup with respect to the disk. According to the invention, a solution for a<br>
simpler transformation into polar coordinates is therefore a marker which is a straight line,<br>
where all the points have fixed polar coordinates (polar angle equal to zero) and the<br>
previously mentioned ratio multiplied by two (2) times % indicates me polar angle position<br>
at a given moment.<br>
The addition of a second marker allows the measurement of the radial position,<br>
provided the polar angle difference between the two is a non-constant function of the radial<br>
position. An example non-constant function is the following:<br>
Polar coordinate = radial coordinate * Constant 1 + Constanr2.<br>
Other specific shapes, also non derivable and non-continuous or with zigzag shape,<br>
can.be envisaged typically in order to occupy a limited angular sector of the disk, while<br>
keeping the necessary polar and radial coordinate resolution on the instantaneous pickup<br>
position. With knowledge of the rotation period and the time difference between the two<br>
markers a polar position of the second marker, with respect to the first one, may be<br>
determined. Given the shape of the two markers, the difference in polar position is then<br>
used to determine the radial position of the pickup in the disk reference frame.<br>
According to the invention, the properties of the second marker differ from those of<br>
the first marker such that the two markers may be distinguished on the basis of the signal<br>
produced by the pickup. Suitable properties include reflectivity, width, structure, line<br>
duplication, and the like.<br>
This method assumes that the disk rotates around a fixed and known axis, defining<br>
the origin for the radial and polar coordinates. In practical cases, a removable disk is<br>
subject to misalignments when mounted on a spindle support, and the actual rotation axis<br>
does not necessarily coincide with the expected one. Additional markers may be provided<br>
to determine the actual rotation axis of the disk to address this issue. More specifically, the<br>
measurement of the time difference between markers may be used to verify the assumed<br>
axis position. With more than two markers of known shape, the time difference between<br>
them contains information on the axis position. The axis position may be inferred by<br>
minimizing the difference between measured time differences and time differences expected<br>
on the basis of a given axis position.<br>
This method may also be applied to devices that rotate around an axis lying outside<br>
the device's perimeter. In the case of rectangular shape disks, not only may the relative<br>
position of the pickup head with respect to the disk be determined, but also the disk position<br>
with respect to the rotation axis (including rotation) may be determined on the basis of a<br>
sufficient number of markers on the disk. The number of markers required depends on the<br>
accuracy needed.<br>
TEMPERATURE MONITORING AND CONTROL<br>
Due to the structure of the disk, its temperature may be controlled by application of<br>
an external heat or cooling source. The sides may have transparent or absorbing properties<br>
to thermal radiation and, in particular, to electromagnetic radiation in the infrared or<br>
microwave light spectrum. It is recognized that other heat exchange mechanisms other than<br>
radiation could be used, including convective fluid flow, resistive heating and conduction.<br>
For integrated microfluidic devices, it is often useful to have a means to determine the local<br>
temperature. In particular determining local temperature is useful for rapidly varying<br>
thermal cycles such as those required for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).<br>
The two-layer structure of the disk may also allow for two facing reservoirs: one<br>
used for the sample fluid whose temperature requires monitoring, and the second one<br>
containing a thermometric liquid. In a preferred embodiment, the thermometric liquid is<br>
based on water or alcohol. Because of the material layer thickness, there is generally a large<br>
thermal conductivity between the two fluid masses, so the temperature of the thermometric<br>
liquid may be approximated as the temperature of the sample liquid. The thermometric<br>
liquid temperature may be monitored as classical thermometers by measuring the (relative)<br>
expansion coefficient of the fluid, with respect to the volume it has at a reference<br>
temperature. Accordingly, the liquid contained in the capillary moves according to the<br>
volumetric expansion of the liquid inside the reservoir, and the determination of its position<br>
provides temperature monitoring.<br>
Alternatively, the pickup light itself may be used for local heating of a fluid. By off-<br>
focusing the pickup light to irradiate a large area of the material layer, the material layer<br>
absorption - or the thermometric fluid absorption if the liquid is chosen accordingly -<br>
dissipates the energy as heat in the sample fluid, producing an increase of its temperature.<br>
Furthermore, the pickup itself may be used to monitor the position of the<br>
thermometric fluid meniscus in a capillary, by evaluating the change of reflectivity<br>
corresponding to the air-liquid interface in the capillary. This evaluation may be performed<br>
by means of the focusing feedback mechanism described above.<br>
ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS<br>
According to the invention, the base may be used to distribute electrical connections<br>
to different parts and positions of the microfiuidic circuit. Provided the base is an insulator,<br>
various techniques are available to deposit thin layers of conductive materials, including<br>
metals, conductive polymers, conductive inks and graphite. Some of the techniques (for<br>
example electroless chemical deposition of metals) also allow, through photolithographic<br>
techniques, to deposit the conductor in a specific shape and partem, generating electrical<br>
distribution lines. These electrical lines may be used to generate electric fields, for example<br>
for electrophoresis, or to provide electrical power to components present on the disk. The<br>
electrical connections may be powered on the disk itself (micro batteries) or may exploit the<br>
presence of a magnetic field that, because of the disk rotation, induces an electric field on<br>
the conductor generating an electrical potential difference. The magnetic field, in particular,<br>
can be used to induce an apparent electric field onto a rotating disk, the magnetic field being<br>
used or for the generation of electrical currents or to generate an apparent electric field, for<br>
example required in protocols like patch clamp, voltage sensitive probe dyes and<br>
electrophoresis.<br>
Alternatively, the conductors can have an electrical connection on the spindle<br>
support, typically by mechanical contact, which is subsequently connected to the fixed part<br>
of the apparatus by means of brush contacts, through conductors coaxial to the rotation axis<br>
or by conductive liquid connections.<br>
DETECTION DEVICES<br>
One aim of the present invention is to perform programmable, flexible and<br>
automated manipulation of fluids.. In most applications, the detection of reaction products,<br>
meaning (in general) any detection of observable quantities consequent to a process, is of<br>
importance for a practical use of the device.<br>
In the present apparatus, it is possible to use the pickup itself for various operations,<br>
by making use of the readout present in the device to perform the focussing onto the base.<br>
The reflectivity information of the materials present on the focal point of the pickup may be<br>
used not only for the scope of valves and disk operation, but also to produce data<br>
concerning the fluidic process.<br>
In another illustrative embodiment of the invention, the reflected light may be<br>
associated with the position (in space) of the pickup, to generate images by using the pickup<br>
as a con-focal microscope. Bi-dimensional images may be easily constructed by varying<br>
the radial position of the pickup during spinning, and collecting the data from the pickup,<br>
for example, by digitisation. Three-dimensional images (via the con-focal properties of the<br>
optics) may be constructed using the focusing movement of the pickup, and varying the<br>
distance of me pickup from the base. Due to the low depth of focus achievable by con-focal<br>
optical systems, three-dimensional images of the fluids (and of the objects contained in the<br>
fluid that have a size and optical properties which are detectable) may be collected and<br>
stored for analysis purposes. Counting methods, for example applied to cells present in the<br>
fluid, are possible and profit significantly from volume scanning to increase the statistical<br>
significance of the data present in a small volume sample.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the disk is essentially a flat,<br>
typically transparent, thin substrate containing fluids which may include additional devices.<br>
These additional devices may be used to collect information on the fluids contained in the<br>
disk. These devices could be biosensors, transducers or arrays of tissues, cells and<br>
molecules. Standard well plate reader scanners, for example, may collect information on<br>
the optical properties of the fluids contained in the disk in a vast range of the<br>
electromagnetic spectrum, with the aim of colorimetric analysis, fluorescence detection, and<br>
radioactive emission measurement.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the disk can be used as an optical medium where the<br>
light is collected and transferred by internal reflection, possibly using prisms, lenses or other<br>
micro optical components integrated onto the surface.<br>
Another possible readout technology relies on the loading, during the manufacturing<br>
process, of the sides or of the base material with scintillating dyes. A radioactive activity<br>
related to the assay is converted into light signals inside the scintillating material, and the<br>
light intensity is used as a measurement of the radioactivity of the sample. The same result<br>
can be obtained by loading liquid scintillator in a microfluidic component facing the<br>
sample, and separated by it only by the base.<br>
It is contemplated within the scope of the invention that off-board detection may be<br>
utilized. Examples include mass spectrometers, irradiation with gamma, x-ray or neutron<br>
beams, and chromatography. Removable components within the microfluidic network, such<br>
as peel away MALDI targets foils or the like can be incorporated into the sides of the<br>
inventive disk. These peel away target surfaces can be advantageously positioned so that<br>
they form sides of chambers used for collection of a sample or samples of interest.<br>
MIXING<br>
In microfluidic devices, the fluid dynamics are typically dominated by laminar flow.<br>
In this sense, mixing - which is natural in the macroscopic world because of different<br>
phenomena like convection or turbulent motion - constitutes a critical issue. According to<br>
the invention, various mixing methods may be used. Magnetic beads may be transported in<br>
the fluids through capillaries, and can be agitated from the outside by the presence of a<br>
static magnetic field when the disk is spinning (or via a variable magnetic Field). Another<br>
method makes use of material layer's elasticity; having the material layer facing a vibrating<br>
reservoir. The vibration may be achieved in different ways: mechanically or induced by<br>
external electric or magnetic fields.<br>
Another method according to the invention makes use of variation of the angular<br>
speed and direction of the rotating disk, including the generation of vibrational and torsional<br>
modes at resonant rotation frequencies.<br>
A further method consists in the use of the Coriolis force to generate turbulent flow<br>
inside the channels of the disk.<br>
Alternatively, the fluid may be circulated, by changing the rotational speed of the<br>
disk, in alternated directions along the capillary. The reverse direction may be easily<br>
obtained by a pneumatic force generated from air (or gas) compressed into a reservoir that,<br>
when the rotational speed of the disk is reduced, returns the stored energy to the fluid.<br>
Alternatively, simple diffusion can be very effective for appropriate geometry of the<br>
microfluidic components (for example, in capillaries).<br>
The valve could also have an active role in mixing. Taking alternatively small<br>
amounts of two fluids to be mixed into the same reservoir or capillary increases the surface<br>
of the interface and therefore mixing by diffusion. Short plugs of multiple fluids could be<br>
alternated inside a capillary for the purpose of improved mixing efficiency by using the<br>
output of the dosimeters.<br>
FLUID TRANSPORT ACTIVATED BY A VALVE<br>
The valves of the present invention have the remarkable feature to withstand large<br>
differences of pressure and to be gas tight. Therefore it is conceivable to have a pneumatic<br>
overpressure or underpressure on one side, which is followed by a sudden gas flow when<br>
the valve is opened.<br>
A pneumatic overpressure can be easily made by means of a closed reservoir<br>
containing a volatile liquid or alternatively, by a chemical reaction between one or more<br>
components releasing gas, for example carbon dioxide. In another embodiment, the<br>
pressure could be generated by means of the centripetal force, compressing a liquid mass<br>
over a confined gas volume. In the last case, it is possible to store the energy for a time<br>
longer than the duration of the centripetal force by having the fluid entering into a Tesla<br>
valve that limits the motion of the fluid backward when the centripetal force is released.<br>
Such a system is hereafter called bottle. The volatile liquid, for example water, can be<br>
heated by means of the laser light in order to produce - by radiative energy transfer - a<br>
given amount of vapour. The connection of the bottle to another circuit, by opening a valve,<br>
will generate a pressure transient in the second circuit. With a multiplexer connection, a<br>
bottle could be put in pneumatic connection with one among a number of circuits. Once a<br>
valve is opened, the bottle is exhausted.<br>
The liquid in the second circuit can be connected to a calibrated capillary - called<br>
output nozzle- exiting from the surface of the chip. By opening the valve, the liquid is<br>
forced to flow through the nozzle, and calibrating the amount of vapour produced it is<br>
possible to avoid the "spraying" of the chemical. The outcome is a collimated liquid jet<br>
exiting from the surface of the chip.<br>
The sample disk can be piled above another one, called receptor disk, which has an<br>
input nozzle in correspondence of the output nozzle of the sample disk. The input nozzle is<br>
a hole connected to a capillary and able to collect the liquid. As an alternative, another<br>
bottle on the receptor disk could be used to suck the liquid by Venturi effect into a capillary,<br>
or by having a vacuum bottle with an underpressure aspirating the liquid into the device.<br>
The same method could be used in order to transfer fluids to and from devices with a<br>
different shape and purpose, such as microtitre plates, microfluidic devices with different<br>
functionality, analytical instruments or any device meant to modify the fluid properties (for<br>
example the fluid temperature). It should be noted that the technique of storing energy by<br>
means of a valve, energy that can be released in a controlled and desired manner, could be<br>
used in order to generate transient fluid flows with the consequence of mixing.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate the methods and products of the<br>
present invention with particular choices for the several components and particular values<br>
for the several variables described above. As described above, many variations on these<br>
particular examples are possible. These examples are merely illustrative and not limiting of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
The optical feedback for focusing according to the present invention has been<br>
implemented to assess the correct positioning onto a material layer 701, as depicted in FIG<br>
7. Turning to FIG. 7, the optical feedback makes use of a simple glass 702 (about 0.199<br>
mm thickness) that intercepts a few percent of the light reflected from the material layer 701<br>
(through the same optical system used for the light incident onto the base). The light from<br>
the material layer 701 is imaged through a 48 mm focal length objective 705 onto a CCD<br>
706. The CCD 706 records the actual shape of the laser spot onto the material layer 701,<br>
and can even image the material layer surface and - for example - beads floating in the<br>
fluid nearby the material layer.<br>
It is contemplated within the scope of the invention that optical feedback can be<br>
achieved by the use of Astigmatic focusing. It is further contemplated within the scope of<br>
the invention that the laser junction image can be magnified or demagnified according to the<br>
ratio of the condenser focal length in the setup (currently 3.1 mm) and the CCD objective<br>
(48 mm). The CCD 706 also records images from the material layer 701 with a<br>
magnification of about 20X, a region of about 200 x 150 microns with a pixel resolution of<br>
0.3 urn. It is contemplated within the scope of the invention that the CCD 706 can be<br>
replaced with a diode (probably a matrix of 2x2 diodes to perform also astigmatic focusing<br>
with the same system) because essentially of a speed issue related to the focusing feedback<br>
(lock and tracking of the focus).<br>
When working with a microfluidic platform such as a disk or chip, it is evident that<br>
three surfaces can be detected by this feedback method: the external surface of the side<br>
where the platform is in contact with atmosphere, the internal surface of the side 708 where<br>
the platform is in contact with the Quid (gas or liquid) contained in the capillaries (or<br>
reservoirs), an interface 710 between fluid and the material layer 701. This interface 710 is<br>
used and detected for focusing. It should be noted that - due to the very limited<br>
transparency (0.02% is the measured transmission for a material layer thickness of 10<br>
micrometer and an Epolight 2057 dye concentration of 1% by weight in PMMA) of the<br>
material layer at the laser wavelength - whatever is behind the material layer 701 does not<br>
affect reflections of the laser light, but it is only detectable in transmission mode.<br>
Working at low fluence, it was verified that the gradual base melting, and material<br>
layer 701 modifications, can be imaged by the same system, so to assess empirically the<br>
light density and temperature of the various parts of the elliptic spot.<br>
Extending this concept, it was verified that it is possible and easy to detect if a valve<br>
according to the invention has been opened or not. When a laser spot was correctly<br>
focused, the entire region exposed to the laser radiation was ablated, and there was no<br>
material left, in focus, to reflect the light through the feedback optical system. If the<br>
material was not fully ablated, then the polymer forming the material layer 701 remaining in<br>
the optical path produced a reflection that was easily measured.<br>
It was determined in real time if the inventive valve was correctly opened or if it had<br>
not been opened, and possibly repeating the opening step (for example, at the next turn of<br>
the disk) if necessary. It was found that the valve reproducibility, was better than 1/1000,<br>
meaning that less than one over a thousand valves has possible problems in the fluid<br>
passage (verified by optical inspection). The optical feedback, allows for quality assurance<br>
of the operation of the inventive valve.<br>
It was found that instead of fixing the energy of a shot, and perforating for a<br>
corresponding fixed time at a given power, it was possible to modulate the laser emission<br>
according to the feedback. The laser light was maintained up to the moment reflected light<br>
from the material layer disappeared, and then the laser was switched off. Advantageously,<br>
optical feedback allowed the laser irradiation to be reduced to a minimum, therefore<br>
reducing the amount of energy going into the system minimizing destruction or alteration of<br>
sample. Using optical feedback, the laser MTTF was improved significantly, as it is related<br>
to the temperature of the laser junction that increases significantly with the exposure time.<br>
Using optical feedback, it was possible to increase peak power of the laser, reducing the<br>
average shot pulse length. This allowed reducing even further the size of the heat transport<br>
region (whose diameter goes with the square root of the pulse time length); it also<br>
guaranteed that a valve had been correctly opened..<br>
Example 2<br>
Performance of the optical setup according to the invention can be characterized by<br>
the following example. The optical configuration is such, the energy of the beam after the<br>
CD lens and integrated all over its pupil amount to 16 uJ released in 10 us, corresponding to<br>
1.6W optical power. As expected, the original laser diode power of 6.2W was reduced<br>
because of collimation, matching and reflections in the optical setup.<br>
When an 8 µm material layer of PMMA from Microchem loaded with Epolight 2057<br>
was put on the CD lens focus, and a first shot was made, only approximately 7.6 µJ<br>
emerged from the base onto a pyrometer positioned behind the material layer. Neglecting<br>
reflections, which were expected to be about 4%, the remaining 8.4 microjoule were<br>
therefore deposited into the sample. As a reference, if the energy was uniformly deposited<br>
into a 1 microlitre water sample, its temperature would rise only approximately 0.0018 C<br>
degrees. However, the energy was sufficient enough to fuse the polymer volume<br>
corresponding to the valve area (3 pL), computed at 7.5 uJ.<br>
A second shot on the same position, showed that all the beam energy was measured<br>
on the pyrometer at the rear of the material layer. This measurement indicated that all the<br>
light was concentrated onto the valve surface and that increasing the shot duration did not<br>
release energy into the sample because the material layer was not absorbing it anymore<br>
since the light was passing through the base valve.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8 these above results are compared with data corresponding to a<br>
DVD configuration where a DVD optical pickup was used. In this case, the optical<br>
configuration was not optimized and, because of misalignments, aberrations and coma, part<br>
of the laser energy was not collimated onto the material layer in a concentrated spot. In this<br>
case, the full beam energy was not restored since it was still hitting the material layer that<br>
did not vaporize at low energy density.<br>
Example 3<br>
Performance of the laser according to the invention can be further understood with<br>
reference to the following example. The source of Laser emission used was the OSRAM<br>
SPL PL90_3 diode, having nanostack technology. The nanostack technology consists in the<br>
"vertical" or epitaxial integration of a number of discrete emitters on a semiconductor chip,<br>
and this produces a two to three times increase in maximum power. The specific diode<br>
exhibits an aperture of 200x10 microns, from three overlapping emitters that reach an<br>
optical output of approximately 75 W when limited to 100 ns pulse-lengths. The diodes<br>
were pulsed by means of a. DEI PCX 7410 diode laser driver, from Directed Energy Inc.<br>
capable of covering the regime 20 ns to 1 (is at 10A, and 5 A in CW mode. To access the<br>
regime above 10A, a DEI PCO 7120 hybrid OEM driver was employed. The pulse voltage<br>
and current was monitored by a Tektronix TDS2014 to reconstruct the electrical power onto<br>
the diode, and extrapolate its optical output on the basis of the diode specifications.<br>
Both the condenser and the objective can be chosen among aspheric lenses (as those<br>
used in optical disks systems) and glass multiplets optimized to operate in the near infrared<br>
region (700-1100 nm). The incident beam was monitored by means of a Melles Griot (MG)<br>
wincamD CCD triggered by the laser diode driver, which intercepts the beam by means of a<br>
semi-reflective window. The beam was collimated into the objective and tuned by means of<br>
various Logitech QC 4000 Pro CCDs, which monitored the beam spot size onto the<br>
objective lens, the impact point onto the sample and the light reflected backward from the<br>
sample.<br>
In a preferred configuration, the objective is a CD lens with its voice-coil actuator<br>
that can be moved along two axes by means of current control. This configuration allowed<br>
optimizing optical conditions and permitted shot by shot verification that the laser beam is<br><br>
in optimal configuration and also permitted prints of the laser diode emitter showing the<br>
nanostack structure onto the sample as shown in FIG. 9. The nanostack structure is visible<br>
as three overlaid narrow slits 901, 902 and 903, which correspond to the three emitting<br>
junctions of the PL90-3 laser diode used in the experiment. The sample under test was a<br>
polyethylene (PE) film from a commercial disposal bag having a thickness of approximately<br>
20 µm. The film was characterized by a high loading of carbon-black. The sample was<br>
exposed with a 6.5 mm objective (NA=0.615) MG 06GLC001 and a 25.6 mm condenser<br>
(NA=0.156) MG 06GLC004 showing evidence of base perforation. The diode laser<br>
parameters were 1=10A with a pulse-length of 100 microseconds, the focusing was<br>
performed by observing diffraction rings in the forward direction without direct observation<br>
of the laser spot on the base. The estimated optical energy of the pulse was below 3µJ,<br>
which is an upper limit that depends on the diode temperature and power degradation that is<br>
expected to occur for this diode in this particular pulse-length regime. It was found that<br>
most of the light was detected behind the base and was not absorbed by the sample material.<br>
The perforation entrance holes 1001 are depicted in FIG 10. The perforation exit<br>
holes 1101 in FIG. 11. The pitch between the entrance and exit holes is approximately 174<br>
microns allowing for an estimation of about 52 microns for the minor axis and 57 microns<br>
for the major axis on average.<br>
Example 4<br>
A solution of PMMA from Microchem of having a molecular weight of<br>
approximately 950,000 Dalton was dissolved at 11% in anisole and spin-coated onto a<br>
silicon substrate treated for detachment of the resulting film. The film was dried at about 20<br>
degrees for approximately 24 hours. The spin coating technique resulted in a film having<br>
thickness homogeneity of approximately 1 micron over a 4 inch wafer. The surface<br>
roughness, measured by alphastep, was approximately 39.6 nm average roughness value<br>
and approximately 53.8 nm root mean square roughness. These mechanical properties of<br>
the PMMA film were matched by its total transparency to infrared light, so that its exposure<br>
to the laser emission did not lead to any observable effects.<br>
A further PMMA film was produced with a loading of approximately 0.5% by<br>
weight of ADS905AM, an infrared dye for American Dye Source Inc., whose absorption<br>
spectrum is shown in FIG. 12. The film was optically perfect to visual inspection but a<br>
microscopic analysis revealed that the dye was not uniformly dissolved into the PMMA.<br>
Upon microscopic analysis it was found that the dye was in sort of an "emulsion" form or<br>
dispersed as non-uniform globules 1301 as depicted in FIG. 13. Despite this lack of<br>
uniformity, no observable laser light was transmitted through the dye loaded film.<br>
Upon exposure to a single laser shot of 100 ns, at 40A, the dye loaded film produced<br>
energy loss into the dye globules. While the non-uniform globules 1301 at the surface often<br>
exploded, no penetration at this exposure occurred.<br>
Upon exposure to multiple laser shots, having a configuration as set forth in example<br>
3, at a frequency of 1 KHz, visible penetration was observed. Such penetration did not<br>
achieve the sample depth of 20 microns; however, the laser light starts to be transmitted<br>
through the polymer foil. This transmission possibly indicates degradation of the dye<br>
absorption in the irradiated region. Without being bound by any particular theory, this<br>
effect is thought to be due to heat generation and subsequent thermal degradation of the dye<br>
molecule (C62H96N6SbF6).<br>
It was found that single laser shots of 10 us duration and 10A current produce<br>
openings that are passing through only when accurately focused. The laser setup used to<br>
produce the laser shots as within this example made use of a commercial CD pickup<br>
objective that required manual focusing at small power and exploited a laboratory grade<br>
25.6 mm condenser as used in the laser setup. The hole diameter was about 20-25 microns<br>
(minor axis) by about 30 microns (major axis). The hole configuration exhibited memory of<br>
the laser aperture shape on the entrance side. This memory of the laser shape is neither a<br>
problem nor limitation. It was found that when the laser focusing was not perfect, the holes<br>
are often not passing-through. It was also found that by increasing the laser shots to 20<br>
microseconds would be enough to effectuate a passing through. It was concluded that a 10<br>
(is laser shot at 10A is sufficient for perforation in these conditions provided the laser is<br>
correctly focused, the optical dye is evenly dispersed and the material layer is about 8<br>
microns.<br>
Example 5<br>
The following experiments were designed in order to maximize the damage to<br>
different biological samples induced by the VLV (Virtual Laser Valve) opening. This was<br>
accomplished by the following strategy: Maximize the number of valves in a given volume<br>
of fluid; increase the laser shot energy to a value which is significantly higher than the one<br>
expected for the prototype/product; minimize the amount of biological sample used in the<br>
experiment which is not exposed/affected by the VLV damage; and having different means<br>
(redundancy, calibration samples, and statistical tests) to assess the correctness of the<br>
assumptions and to validate the experiment consistency.<br>
The first objective implied a large VLV density, and the capability to open a large<br>
number of VLV in a short time (below 30 minutes). Matrices from 100 VLV/mm2 to 600<br>
VLV/mm2 were produced, the last value corresponding to the condition where the base is<br>
destroyed (cut) by the laser within known parameters.<br>
The Laser parameters were kept, during all the experiments, equal to 100 us shot<br>
producing .160 µJ of optical energy, largely sufficient for perforation with good margins.<br>
Fluorescent beads, mixed at a known concentration in the samples, were used for a<br>
quantitative check of the dilutions and sample recovery efficiency in most of the<br>
experiments.<br>
The samples were exposed in two main configurations: inside an experimental chip<br>
and in the so-called "drop" configuration. In all cases, the material layer was identical in<br>
thickness and dye loading.<br>
The data was presented in a unique manner: the calibration samples were averaged<br>
and renormalized to 1 (100%), independently for beads and the biological measurement on<br>
the calibration sample. Every result was expressed as the relative amount of material<br>
collected when the sample is exposed to the valves divided by the corresponding reference<br>
unexposed sample. The term "loss" corresponded to the relative difference (REF-<br>
VLV)/REF, which was a positive number in case of a biological loss or damage, and a<br>
negative number in case the exposed sample had more material than the reference sample.<br>
Chip experiments description<br>
With the exception of the pro-insulin exposures, one micrometer diameter YC<br>
carboxylated fluorescent beads (Polybeads from Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA) were<br>
added to sample in order to achieve, after final dilution, a concentration of 50 beads/µL.<br>
The beads were used also to verify in qualitative terms the sample inside the chip, and to<br>
monitor the chip rinsing by means of a fluorescent microscope. Calibration samples, as<br>
well as negative samples, were produced by standard dilution techniques.<br>
An experimental chip 1400 used according to this example is represented in FIG 14.<br>
The misalignment of the two sides and the fact one side is tilled with fluorescent beads<br>
helps in disentangling the configuration in depth. As shown in FIG 14, a sample was filled<br>
into an inlet 1401 by means of a peristaltic pump (not shown, from Ismatec) operated<br>
around 5 µL/min through a Tygon tubing of 0.19 or 0.25 mm inner diameter. Previous<br>
experiments had shown that the tube did not induce damage to our samples. In each<br>
experiment new tubes were used to avoid cross-contamination. In most cases, the chip<br>
1400 was filled with fluid without bubbles; in the few cases where these were present, the<br>
actual fluid volume was corrected by means of measurements taken on images taken with a<br>
camera mounted on the microscope. Only one side of the chip 1400, in this case a first side<br>
1402 was filled with fluid.<br>
An important requirement of the filling procedure consisted in being confident that<br>
all fluid (sample) was removed from the inlet 1401 and an outlet 1404 of the chip 1400.<br>
This was accomplished by pipetting and subsequent inspection with fluorescent<br>
microscopy that no beads were present in the connection reservoirs. If fluid was detected,<br>
it was pipetted out of the reservoir up to the absence of fluorescent beads. The<br>
determination of the nominal volume of the chip 1400 was, by itself, very difficult.<br>
Because of the design of the chip 1400, the reservoir filled with liquid had a nominal<br>
volume of approximately 3000 x 1400x50 µm.<br>
As a result of the chip 1400 design, two undesired phenomena occur: on one side,<br>
the pressure generated by the pump on the fluid can be very large (the ratio between the<br>
reactor section and the input capillary cross section is about 80X, meaning that the force<br>
applied onto the base in the reactor is SOX larger with respect to the base in the capillary).<br>
In addition, a movement of the material layer by 10 µm in depth determines a change of<br>
20% in the nominal volume of the reservoir. It was determined that the base was moving<br>
during the filling process when the inlet pressure was applied. Because of this base<br>
movement, a large pressure was applied onto the material layer, so to have it touching the<br>
opposite side surface and determining an absolute reservoir volume of about twice the<br>
nominal one. Care was taken to treat the samples identically in the two filling operations.<br>
When the chip 1400 was not exposed to the Virtual laser Valve (VLV), the rinsing<br>
procedure consisted of removing the sample by transporting an amount of buffer between<br>
50 and 400 µL into the chip 1400. A buffer was inserted by applying a positive pressure to<br>
the inlet 1402 and collecting the fluids from the outlet 1404. The rinsing process was<br>
typically done by a series of these operations, separated by few minutes when the chip<br>
1400 was completely empty of fluids. The rinsing speed was limited to about 50 micro<br>
litres per minute because of the capillaries' cross section. In the capillaries, this flow<br>
corresponds to a fluid speed of 0.3 m/s (1 km/h). The fluid speed inside the chip 2200<br>
hardly achieved 0.4 cm/s, and this explained the long rinsing process (from 30 minutes to 1<br>
hour) required in order to observe one order of magnitude drop in the beads content of the<br>
fluid - and similarly for the biological sample concentration.<br>
The chip filling for the exposure was kept as similar as possible to the calibration<br>
filling, and the same criteria in the analysis of the beads content applied.<br>
The VLV exposure was performed in some cases "downstream" of the laser<br>
direction, and in some cases "upstream".<br>
The rinsing of the chip 1400 exposed to the VLV differed from the one previously<br>
explained since all four inlets were in fluidic communication. The outlet 1404 connection<br>
was connected to the peristaltic pump (independent channels) and fed with the buffer. The<br>
fluid speed was kept from 10 µL per minute to about 40 µL per minute.<br>
In experiments where beads were present, 2 drops of 1 µL from each final<br>
eppendorf tube were taken and deposited onto a labelled microscope slide. The drop was<br>
allowed to gently evaporate, with the consequence that all the beads contained in the drop<br>
were collected onto the flat surface of the glass inside a small perimeter. An image of the<br>
beads was taken, and beads were blindly counted by means of Scion Software package.<br>
Both drops were systematically used in the analysis order to check possible errors in the<br>
process.<br>
Drop experiments description<br>
The analysis of the previous experimental procedure has indicated the possibility to<br>
eliminate systematic errors by a simplified experiment consisting of sample preparation,<br>
fluid handling double drop preparation, single drop valves exposure, double drop collection,<br>
bead measurement and biological processing.<br>
The drop exposure was often performed together with the chip experiments, to<br>
validate the result through consistency analysis. For this reason, the sample preparation was<br>
identical, with the precautions of "equalizing" the expected results (similar final<br>
concentrations).<br>
The double-drop preparation consisted of putting a 1 µL drop onto a piece of<br>
material layer of about 4x4 mm2 suspended onto a glass frame by its corners. The comers<br>
were attached to the glass by means of a minute drop of water, which generated attraction<br>
between the two surfaces. The sample drop had a circular shape and was deposited with a<br>
tip. Using this method, the drop never reached the edges of the material layer nor any other<br>
material. It was noticed that all drops made with the same buffer/sample were similar and<br>
attached to the material layer with a consistent contact angle determining its shape.<br>
However, it was found that the biological sample, its concentration and the buffer fluid<br>
introduced a large variability on the drop shape. The drop had a contact area of about 2<br>
mm2 in the case of pro-insulin in water buffer at 7 µg per µL, and a contact area of about 1<br>
mm2 for the E-coli culture medium with a concentration of about 1 E-6 E. coli per uL.<br>
The single drop exposure consisted of choosing, randomly, one of two drops and<br>
exposing it to laser radiation. Since the drop surface was substantially proportional to the<br>
drop volume (tested with drops of 1-2-3 µL and camera images) there was an overall<br>
constraint in the maximum number of valves that could be opened given by the available<br>
area.<br>
The double drop collection consisted of removing the material layer samples with<br>
the drop from the glass frame, and putting each sample into an eppendorf tube. The<br>
material layer was rinsed inside the tube by means of an inox clamp and accurately cleaned<br>
before each exposure to avoid cross-contaminations. The final eppendorf tube contained a<br>
buffer volume between 50 and 400 µL, where the base was immersed.<br>
The experimental procedure was tested with beads, and it was noticed that after a<br>
VLV opening, the fluid entered into the aperture and filled the VLV volume. Surface<br>
tension avoided that the fluid wets the surface opposite to the drop.<br>
Using the above procedures, an experiment aimed to test the viability of ampicillin<br>
resistant Escherichia Coli {E-Coli) bacteria exposed to the effects of the virtual laser valve.<br>
Bacteria were provided in solution for testing purposes and returned for evaluation also in<br>
solution. Triplicate plating, at different dilutions, was performed for each of the returned<br>
samples. The original bacteria concentration was kept at about SE5 E-Coli/µL, in a culture<br>
buffer and the sample was mixed with beads in the same buffer at a concentration of SO<br>
beads per µL.<br>
The experimental chip, similar to chip 1400 as shown in FIG. 14, had a 2000 x 2000<br>
urn nominal reactor. The chip 1400 was filled without evidence of clogging and<br>
substantially no bubbles were evident in any of the relevant steps. The rinsing strategy<br>
consisted in 4 rinsing steps of 100 µL each, in order to observe and measure the beads/E-<br>
coli content in the samples.<br>
The drop experiment was performed in quadruplicate and the material layer was<br>
removed from the eppendorf before it was sent for analysis. Two negative samples, as well<br>
as two calibration samples were present in the dataset. The calibration samples were diluted<br>
in order to generate the same colony counting of the chips experiment, in. the hypothesis of<br>
310 nL volumes (nominal) and perfect rinsing.<br>
As shown in table 1 below the data was renormalized in both columns to the average<br>
of calibration and calibration II. The corresponding numbers are 181.5 colonies and 43.3<br>
beads respectively, in line with expectations.<br>
The colonies were plated in duplicate at different concentration and both plates were<br>
consistent. The same parameters applied to the beads.<br>
Both the calibration and negative samples were fully compatible regarding beads<br>
and colony counting. Since beads counting resulted from the average of two drops<br>
containing approximately 50 beads, the statistical error of 10% was expected.<br>
The NOVLV drops could be considered as an additional calibration sample. In<br>
terms of the colonies the average was 89%, while in terms of beads the average was 101%.<br>
The chip rinsing data is depicted in FIG 15. The samples refer to 100 µL data points<br>
that translated into a rinsing decay constant of 157 µL. There was no striking difference<br>
between beads and colonies suggesting that the rinsing is essentially independent from the<br>
type of particle to be rinsed. Less, than 7% of the samples were expected to remain in the<br>
chip and therefore since this amount was less than the experimental error there was no<br>
correction as a result.<br>
The physical chip volume was estimated by imaging the chip and was found to be<br>
approximately 520 nL. This volume included capillaries and base bending onto the side.<br>
The volume corresponded to 167%. The integral counts from the chips are as follows:<br>
Integral reference Data 185.67%<br>
Integral Reference Beads 173.41%<br>
Integral VLV Data 145.45%<br>
Integral VLV Beads 124.86%<br>
Well matching the expectation for the NOVLV data. The measurement of the loss<br>
comes from the VLV/NOVLV ratio and corresponded to a loss of 28% for the bead and<br>
22% of the bacteria. The reduction of the beads and bacteria viability suggested that the E-<br>
Coli were damaged by the VLV similar to the beads. This result was independently verified<br>
by the drop experiments. The ratio between unexposed drops and exposed drops is<br>
graphically depicted in FIG. 16, both for E-Coli and beads.<br>
Data showed a consistent loss of 10% of the beads when the drop was exposed. E-<br>
Coli loss was equivalent in the sense that on average 15% less E-Coli were present in the<br>
exposed drops with respect to the unexposed drops. It was concluded that every 10X valve<br>
appeared to reduce the sample by less than 0.7 nL inside the chip and less than 0.9 nL in the<br>
drop experiments. Therefore there was a loss of 0.83 nL per valve for E. Coli and 0.79 nL<br>
per valve for the beads.<br>
Example 5<br>
The resistance of DNA plasmids coding ampicillin resistance to damage by the<br>
virtual laser valve was explored. Tins resistance was determined by measuring the<br>
resistance of cells to ampicillin after being transfected with the same material. Sample<br>
DNA at high concentration was provided in a TE buffer and the sample was mixed with<br>
beads at a concentration of 50 beads per microlitre. The chip used in this example was a<br>
2000 x 2000 uM nominal reactor and the rinsing strategy consisted of two rinsing steps of<br>
400 µL each. The drop experiment was performed in triplicate and the base was removed<br>
from the Eppendorf before it was sent for analysis. All samples used were diluted into a<br>
400 µL buffer volume.<br>
A negative sample as well as a calibration sample was included in the dataset. The<br>
calibration sample was diluted to generate the same colony counting of the chip experiment<br>
and the hypothesis of 310 nL volume (nominal) and perfect rinsing.<br>
The following data as shown in table 2 below was renormalized to the calibration<br>
sample according to the general procedure set forth in the above examples. The<br>
corresponding counting for the calibration samples is 336 colonies of transfected cells.<br>
Transfection was performed in duplicate and in the case of "Calibration", NOVLV Chipl",<br>
"VLV Drop 1" and NOVLV Drop 2", the transfection in duplicate was repeated a second<br>
time.<br>
Table 2<br>
Calibration 100.0%<br>
Negative sample 0.3%<br>
NOVLV Chip 1 304.5%<br>
NOVLV Chip 2 7.7%<br>
VLV Chip 1 188.1%<br>
VLV Chip 2 12.8%<br>
VLV Drop 1 83.3%<br>
NO VLV Drop 1 81.3%<br>
VLV Drop 2 67.6%<br>
NOVLV Drop 2 66.4%<br>
VLV Drop 3 44.0%<br>
NOVLV Drop 3 51.2%<br>
The negative sample matched expectations. Additionally, the rinsing of the chip<br>
was performed with 400 µL volumes instead of 100 µL and the data for the second rinsing<br>
step matched the expectation from previous data.<br>
The physical chip volume was estimated by imaging the chip to be 1.65% in the scale<br>
expressed in table 2 and the integral counts fro the chips were as follows:<br>
Integral Reference Data 312.20%<br>
Integral VLV data 200.89%<br>
Notably, the amount of DNA extracted from the unexposed chip was about a factor<br>
twice as large as expected. The hypothesis of a change in the transfection efficiency was<br>
dismissed by the repetition of the transfection step, done in the same time for the calibration<br>
sample and for the dominant point (NOVLV Chip 1).<br>
The face value ration between the exposed and the unexposed chip points to a 35%<br>
loss of DNA, however, the exposed sample has a counting rate of colonies compatible with<br>
expectation from the geometrical volume of the chip.<br>
The results of the drop experiments are depicted in FIG. 17. The average result<br>
suggests a 3% loss.<br>
Example 6<br>
This experiment consisted in producing one VLV drop, one NOVLV drop and one<br>
microlitre calibration sample of human pro-insulin at 7 microgram per microlitre. The<br>
drops on the base were immersed in a 50 µL buffer. Some problems were experienced with<br>
the behavior of the protein with the tips used, since the affinity of the fluid with the material<br>
of the tip was significantly higher man expected. The drop exposure was modified in order<br>
to avoid possible contacts of the backside of the drop with parafilm. The final eppendorf<br>
tubes were sent for analysis still containing the base samples exposed. No beads were used<br>
in the process.<br>
Approximately 1.3 µL of the sample solution was used for HPLC injection and<br>
HPLC was performed in triplicate for each eppendorf. The peaks shape was analyzed and<br>
no evidence of differences between the three samples was found. It appeared that no<br>
alteration or modification of the sample protein occurred. Further analysis was performed<br>
using quadrupole MS and confirmed the HPLC conclusion.<br>
Example 7<br>
Base loading optimization has been studied by varying the shot energy by means of<br>
a different laser shot pulse length, with the aim to find the perforation limit for bases of<br>
different materials, thickness ana absorption properties. The setup is substantially<br>
optimized for efficient light collection and focusing precision (CCD imaging of the focusing<br>
spot by analysis of the epi-reflected light from the base). Once these limit conditions are<br>
found, an absorption measureme t of the light for the various samples has been made, using<br>
the same laser light source but in a smaller intensity, and measuring the transmitted energy<br>
by means of a PEM 100 pyrometer by Lasertechnik Berlin, Germany. The data is reported<br>
in the following tables, including the minimum laser duration (in the same conditions) that<br>
was necessary to observe the film perforation. It is visible that the minimum laser<br>
perforation conditions are in qualitative agreement with the expectation based on the base<br>
absorptivity and the laser energy, the laser spot size being identical in all experiments.<br>
The following table shows the correlation between absorption properties and<br>
perforation conditions. Different materials and different dyes, both in type and<br>
concentration, have been subject to decreasing intensity of radiation by reducing the pulse<br>
duration of laser emission in identical conditions. Once found the minimum impulse time<br>
for perforation, a transmission measurement has been performed by comparing the laser<br>
intensity (accurately reduced in order to avoid perforation of the layer or damage of the dye)<br>
with identical material once loaded with a dye and without dye loading. It is evident from<br>
the table below that both materials and dye loading affect the perforation limits in identical<br>
irradiation conditions.<br>
Although the inventive valving device is described with a rotating platform<br>
dependant upon centripetal forces, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that such<br>
a valve may be used on any microfluidic device were it is desirable to use valving<br>
components. Likewise, it will be further appreciated that the inventive valving device can<br>
be adapted to larger scale analytical devices, with an increase of the overall laser intensity<br>
for larger valves, for example by means of laser diode bars. Likewise, it will be understood<br>
by those skilled in the art that this valving technology can be applied even for smaller scale<br>
devices, in the domain of nanotechnology. In fact, it is evident that the electromagnetic<br>
emission can be reduced down to diff action limited spots, and the valves could be a<br>
fraction of the illuminated spot. Valves in the nanometer range are possible, compatibly<br>
with the molecular structure of the material layer involved.<br>
Although the material layer within the inventive device utilizes dyes having certain<br>
spectral qualities, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other compounds or<br>
particles having desirable absorption properties may be used to capture electromagnetic<br>
radiation in order to perforate the material layer. Likewise, it will be further appreciated<br>
that films or layers having desirable absorption properties may also be used to capture<br>
electromagnetic radiation.<br>
Although the electromagnetic radiation is used within the inventive device to<br>
perforate a material layer, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that such<br>
electromagnetic radiation can be used to sublime or melt crystalline structures used for<br>
valving purposes.<br>
Although the inventive valve used within the specification and examples concern the<br>
valving of fluids, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the inventive valve<br>
may be used to valve gases or gaseous fluids. Likewise, it will be further appreciated that,<br>
many applications, for example fuel cells, thrust control in aerospace application, mixture<br>
control for combustion or the like, can utilize the inventive valving technology.<br>
Having now described a few embodiments of the invention, it should be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art that the foregoing is merely illustrative and not limiting, having been<br>
presented by way of example only. Numerous modifications and other embodiments are<br>
