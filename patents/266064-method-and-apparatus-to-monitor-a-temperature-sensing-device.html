METHOD AND APPARATUS TO MONITOR A TEMPERATURE SENSING DEVICE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to powertrain control systems and<br>
systems for detection of faults therein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Powertrain control architectures include systems for monitoring operation of various components and subsystems to ensure proper control and operation, and to identify component and system faults. This includes devices and control algorithms operative to monitor temperatures of some of the components and subsystems. Temperature monitoring can be accomplished using systems having temperature sensing devices, including circuits which utilize thermo-resistive devices, e.g., thermistors and other sensors. These systems and devices for monitoring temperature may have faults which lead to incorrect readings of temperature, and are often required to be monitored. [0003] Monitoring of temperature sensing systems includes systems operative to detect electrical shorts and open circuits. Monitoring can include rationality monitors, wherein a temperature sensor signal is monitored for signal bias or unexpected variations.<br>
[0004] One form of rationality monitoring is an algorithm executed in a control module comprising a mathematical model which predicts a temperature based upon operating conditions, and compares the predicted temperature to a temperature measured by the sensing system to determine whether the sensing system is operating properly. This approach requires engineering effort to develop and calibrate the predictive model, and consumes operating space, memory and execution time in the control module.<br><br>
GP-308915-PTH-CD<br>
2<br>
[0005] A risk of executing a temperature rationality monitor includes occurrence of a falsely indicated fault, wherein a system inaccurately identifies presence of a fault, and can be caused by executing the temperature rationality monitor during extreme environmental conditions, or electrical circuit noise, or errors in digital signal processing. One method to address such concerns includes limiting operating conditions as which rationality tests can be conducted, which results in reduced signal resolution, or reduced temperature sensing range.<br>
[0006] There is a need for a temperature monitoring scheme which addresses the issues described. Such a system is described hereinafter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a method and an article of manufacture are provided to monitor a temperature sensing circuit and detect a fault therein. The method comprises monitoring sensor readings output from a plurality of temperature sensing circuits. An average sensor reading is determined, calculated from the sensor readings output from a subset of the temperature sensing circuits. Each of the sensor readings is compared to the average sensor reading. A fault is identified when one of the sensor readings deviates from the average sensor reading by an amount greater than a threshold, more particularly when one of the sensor readings deviates from the average sensor reading by an amount greater than the threshold at least a quantity of X times out of Y sensor readings.<br>
[0008] These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed description of the embodiments.<br><br>

There is a User Interface ('UI') 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle operator typically controls or directs operation of the powertrain including the transmission 10 through a request for a torque output. Exemplary vehicle operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a brake pedal, transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control. Each of the aforementioned control modules communicates with other control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network ('LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of control parameters and commands between the various control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned control modules, and other control modules providing functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle stability.<br>
[0016] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19. and BPCM 21, based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the powertrain, including the battery pack. The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators, respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively shown as aggregate line 35. The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command signals to the transmission, including monitoring inputs from pressure switches and selectively actuating pressure control solenoids and shift solenoids to actuate various clutches to achieve various transmission operating modes.

GP-308915-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
batteries to the HCP 5. Such information includes battery state-of-charge ('SOC'), battery voltage and available battery power.<br>
[0017] Each of the aforementioned control modules preferably comprises a general-purpose digital computer generally including a microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory (EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog conversion (D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer circuitry.

[0018] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device. using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0019] Referring now to Fig. 2, more details of the exemplary system are depicted, comprising hardware for controlling one of the electrical machines.

GP-308915-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
[0021] Referring now to Fig. 3, a method 50 for monitoring outputs from the temperature sensing network to detect a fault therein is described, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The method comprises, overall, monitoring sensor readings output from a plurality of temperature sensing circuits. An average sensor reading is calculated from the sensor readings output from a subset of the temperature sensing circuits, and each of the sensor readings is compared to the average sensor reading. When one of the sensor readings deviates from the average sensor reading by an amount greater than a threshold, actions are taken. The method is preferably executed as one or more algorithms in the control system during one of the predetermined loop cycles. The method 50 comprises monitoring outputs of the sensor circuits for sensors Tl, T2, 13, and TM to obtain temperature sensor readings of TINV1, TINV2, TINV3, and TM from the respective sensor circuit (Step 52). A first average temperature, TAVG l, is determined based upon TINV1, TINV2, TINV3 (Step 54), and then compared to each of the readings TINV1, TINV2 TINV3 (Step 56).<br>
[0022] When one or more of TINV1, TINV2. TINV3 fall outside of a predetermined range a fault increment (FI) for the sensor which most greatly deviates from the first average temperature, TAVG_ 1 is set equal to one ("1"). By way of example, the most greatly deviating reading is identified as TINV1 in this flowchart. A second average temperature, TAVG 2 is determined based upon the readings from the remaining two sensors, TINV2, TINV3 (Step 58) and compare thereto (Step 60). When readings from the remaining two sensors. TINV2, TINV3 differ by a predetermined value and are outside of a range. TINV2 and TINV3 are each compared to TM (Step 62). When the comparisons of TINV2 and TINV3 to TM are both outside of a predetermined range, a fault increment (FI) for each of the sensors T2, T3, TM are set equal to one ("1") (Step 64). When the comparisons of one of TINV2 and TINV3 to TM is outside of a predetermined range, a fault increment for the out-of-range sensor, i.e., either T2 or T3 is set equal to one ("1") (Step 84).<br><br>
GP-308915-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
[0023] When readings from the remaining two sensors, TINV2, TINV3 are within range of each other (Step 60), fault increments for both sensors are set equal to zero ("0"), i.e., FI-T2 - 0, FI-T3 - 0 (Step 78). The reading for TM is compared to the second average temperature, TAVG 2 (Step 80), and when within a predetermined range, a fault increment for sensor TM (FI-TM) is set equal to zero ("0") (Step 86). When the reading for TM is outside the predetermined range, the fault increment for sensor TM (FI-TM) is set equal to one ("1") (Step 82).<br>
[0024] When the first average temperature, TAVG i, is compared to each of the readings TINV1, TINV2, TINV3 (Step 56), and none of TINV1, TINV2. TINV3 fall outside of the predetermined range the fault increments (FI) for sensors Tl, T2, T3 are set equal to zero ("0") (Step 72). The first average temperature, TAvc,j, is compared to TM (Step 74), and when TM is within range, the fault increment (FI) for sensor TM is set equal to zero (Step 88). When TM is out-of-range, the fault increment (FI) for sensor TM is set equal to one (Step 76). [0025] When fault increments (FI) for sensors Tl, T2, 13. and TM have been set, either to "1" or "'0", fault counts for each sensor are incremented by the corresponding fault increment, and a sample counter is incremented (Step 66). The fault counts are evaluated (Step 68) using an "X out of Y" analysis. wherein "X" represents the fault count for each sensor and "Y" represents a total number of samples. Thus each fault count is evaluated to determine whether the quantity of faults occurring exceed a threshold quantity of faults for the number of samples.<br>
[0026] It is preferable to execute the control scheme described herein after a cold start event, wherein the temperatures have equilibrated among the various circuits and devices, thus facilitating a common baseline temperature for all the devices monitored. It is preferable to monitor temperatures, within a range of temperatures that is predetermined based upon output of the thermistors or other temperature sensors used, in order to permit effective measurement of<br><br>

10<br>
temperatures in view of the signal range and capabilities of the sensor and the resolution of A/D converter of the control module.<br>

The invention has been described with specific reference to the embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications and alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the invention.<br><br>

An average sensor reading is determined, calculated from the sensor readings output from a subset of the temperature sensing circuits. Each of the sensor readings is compared to the average sensor reading. A fault is identified when one of the sensor readings deviates from the average sensor reading by an amount greater than a threshold, more particularly when one of the sensor readings deviates from the average sensor reading by an amount greater than the threshold at least a quantity of X times out of Y sensor readings.</td>
