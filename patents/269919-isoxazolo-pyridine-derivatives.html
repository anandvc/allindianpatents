				<td>Isoxazolo-Pyridine Derivatives<br>
The present invention is concerned with isoxazole-pyridine derivatives having affinity and selectivity for GABA A α5 receptor binding site, their manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as medicaments. The active compounds of the present invention are useful as cognitive enhancer or for the treatment of cognitive <br>
disorders like Alzheimer's disease.<br><br>
In particular, the present invention is concerned with isoxazole-pyridine derivatives of formula I <br><br>
wherein X, R1 to R6 are as described in claim 1.<br>
Receptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily and (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex which is a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally of α, β and γ subunits.<br><br>
Presently a total number of 21 subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned and sequenced. Three types of subunits (α, β and γ) are required for the construction of recombinant GABA A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of native GABA A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site lies between the α and γ subunits. <br><br>
Among the recombinant GABA A receptors, α l P2Y2 mimics many effects of the classical type-1 BZR subtypes, whereas α 2β 2 γ  , α 3(32y2 and α 5P2Y2 ion channels are termed type-II BZR.<br><br>
It has been shown by McNamara and Skelton in Psychobiology, 21:101-108 that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist P-CCM enhance spatial leaming in the Morris watermaze. However, p-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A a5 receptor partial or fill inverse agonist which is relatively free of activity at GABA A al and/or a2 and/or a3 receptor binding sites can be used to provide a medicament which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A a5 inverse agonists which are not free of activity at GABA A al and/or a2 and/or a3 receptor binding sites but which are functionally selective for a5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists which are selective for GABA A a5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A al, a2 and a3 receptor binding sites are preferred.<br><br>
Objects of the present invention are compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, the preparation of the above mentioned compounds, medicaments containing them and their manufacture as well as the use of the above mentioned compounds in the control or prevention of illnesses, especially of illnesses and disorders of the kind referred to earlier or in the manufacture of corresponding medicaments.<br><br>

As mentioned earlier, the compounds of formula I and their phannaceutically usable salts possess valuable pharmacological properties. It has been found that the compounds of the present invention are ligands for GABA A receptors containing the a5 subunit and are therefore usefiil in the therapy where cognition enhancement is required.<br>
The compounds were investigated in accordance with the test given hereinafter:<br>
Membrane preparation and binding assav<br>
The affinity of compounds at GABA A receptor subtypes was measured by competition for [3H]flumazenil (85 Ci/mmol; Roche) binding to HEK293 cells expressing rat (stably transfected) or human (transiently transfected) receptors of composition alp3Y2, a2p3y2, a3(33Y2 and a5p3y2.<br>
Cell pellets were suspended in Krebs-tris buffer (4.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaC12, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 120 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris; pH 7.5; binding assay buffer), homogenized by polytron for ca. 20 sec on ice and centrifiiged for 60 min at 4 °C (50000 g; Sorvall, rotor: SM24 = 20000 rpm). The cell pellets were resuspended in Krebs-tris buffer and homogenized by polytron for ca. 15 sec on ice. Protein was measured (Bradford method, Bio-Rad) and aliquots of 1 mL were prepared and stored at -80 °C.<br>
Radioligand binding assays were carried out in a volume of 200 mL (96-well plates) which contained 100 mL of cell memebranes, [3H]flumazenil at a concentration of 1 nM for al, a2, a3 subimits and 0.5 nM for a5 subunits and the test compound in tiie range of 10-10"^ x 10"* M. Nonspecific binding was defined by 10"^ M diazepam and typically represented less than 5% of the total binding. Assays were incubated to equilibrium for 1 hour at 4 °C and harvested onto GF/C uni-filters (Packard) by filtration using a Packard harvester and washing with ice-cold<br><br>
wash buffer (50 mM Tris; pH 7.5). After drying, filter-retained radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting. Ki values were calculated using Excel-Fit (Microsoft) and are^ means of two determinations.<br>
The compounds of the accompanying examples were tested in the above described assay, and the preferred compounds were found to possess a Ki value for displacement of [^H]flumazenil from a5 subunits of the rat GABA A receptor of 100 nM or less. Most preferred are compounds with a Ki (nM) 
 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I as well as their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharaiaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets,<br><br>
dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Lactose, com starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc can be used as such excipients e.g. for tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable excipients for soft gelatine capsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semisolid and liquid polyols etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are e.g. water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for injection solutions are e.g. water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for suppositories are e.g. natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols etc.<br>
Moreover, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
The dosage can vaiy within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral administration a daily dosage of about 0.1 to 1000 mg per person of a compound of general formula I should be appropriate, although the above upper limit can also be exceeded when necessary.<br>
