COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"COMPOUND HAVING AN INHIBITORY ACTIVITY ON THE REPLICATION OF THE RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS"<br>
We, JANSSEN PHARMACEUTICA N.V., of Tumhoutseweg 30, Beerse, B -2340, Belgium,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a compound having an inhibitory activity on the replication of the respiratory syncytial virus.<br>
I   The present invention is concerned with benzimidazoles and imidazopyridines having   "<br>
antiviral activity, in particular, they have an inhibitory activity on the replication of the • respiratory syncytial virus. It further concerns their preparation and compositions comprising them, as well as their use as a'medicine,<br><br>
Human RSV or Respiratory Syncytial Virus is a large RNA virus, member of the family of Paramyxbviridae, subfamily pneumovirinae together with bovine RSV. virus. Human RSV is responsible for a spectrum of respiratory tract diseases in people of all ages throughout the world It is the major cause of lower respiratory tract illness during infancy and childhood. Over half of all infants encounter RSV in their first year of life,. . and almost all within their first two years. The infection in young children can cause lung damage that persists for years and may contribute to chronic lung disease in later life (chronic wheezing, asthma). Older children and adults often suffer from a (bad) common cold upon RSV infection. In old age, susceptibility again increases," and RSV has been implicated in a number of outbreaks of pneumonia in the aged resulting in significant mortality.<br>
Infection with a virus from a given subgroup does not protect against a subsequent infection with an RSV isolate from the same subgroup in the following winter season. Re-infection with RSV is thus common, despite the existence of only two subtypes, A and B.<br>
Today only three drugs have been approved for use against RSV infection. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue, provides an aerosol treatment for serious RSV infection in hospitalized children. The aerosol route of administration, the toxicity (rislc of teratogenicity), the cost and the highly variable efficacy limit its use. The other two<br>
drugs, RespiGam® and palivizumab, polyclonal and monoclonal antibody <br>
immunostimulants, are intended to be-used in a preventive way,	 .<br>
Other attempts to develop a safe and effective RSV vaccine have all met with failure thus far. Inactivated vaccines failed to protect against disease, and in fact in some cases enhanced disease during subsequent infection. life attenuated vaccines have been tiled with limited success. Clearly there is a need for an efficacious non-toxic and easy to administer drug against RSV replication.<br><br>
EP-A-0,005,318 , EP-A-0,099,139 ,EP-A-0,145,037 , EP-A-0,144,101, EP-A-0,151,826 , EP-A-0,151,824 , EP-A-0,232,937 , EP-A-0,295,742 , EP 0,297,661 , EP-A-0,307,014 , WO 92 01697 describe benzimidazole and imidazopyridine substituted piperidine and piperazine derivatives as antihistaminics, antiallergics or serotonine antagonists.<br>

The term prodrug as used throughout this text means the pharmacologically acceptable derivatives, e.g. esters and amides, such that the resulting biotransformation product of the derivative is the active drug as defined in the compounds of formula (I). The<br>
fh<br>
reference by Goodman and Gilman (The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 8 ed., McGraw-Hill, Int. Ed. 1992, "Biotransformation of Drugs", p. 13-15) describing prodrugs generally, is hereby incorporated.<br>
As used herein C1-.3alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl,<br><br>
propyl, 1-methylethyl and the like; C1-.4alky! as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as the group defined for C1-.3alkyi and butyl and the like; C2-4alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms such as ethyl, propyl, 1-methylethyl, butyl and the like; C1-.6alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as the groups defined for C1-.4alkyl and pentyl, hexyl, 2-methyIbutyl and the like; C1-.9alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 9 carbon atoms such as the groups defined for C1-.6alkyl and heptyl, octyl, nony], 2-methylhexyl, 2-methylheptyl and the like; C1-.10alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms such as the groups defined for C1-.9alkyl and decyl, 2-methylnonyl and the like. C3_7cycloalkyl is generic to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl; C2.5alkanediyl defines bivalent straight and branched chain<br>
saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 2 to 5 carbon atoms such as, for example, 1,2-ethanediyl, 1,3-propanediyl, 1,4-butanediyI, 1,2-propanediyl, 2,3-butanediyl, 1,5-pentanediyl and the like, C2-.5alkanediyl is substituted on C1-.10alkyl as provided for in.<br>
the definition of R2, it is meant to be substituted on one carbon atom thus forming a spiro moiety; CMalkanediyl defines bivalent straight and branched chain saturated<br>
hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as, for example, methylene, 1,2-ethanediyl, 1,3-propanediyl, 1,4-butanediyl and the like; C1-.6alkanediyl is meant to include CMalkanediyl and the higher homologues thereof having from 5 to 6 carbon<br>
atoms such as, for example, 1,5-pentanediyl, 1,6-hexanediyl and the like; C1-.10alkanediyl is meant to include C1-.6alkanediyl and the higher homologues thereof<br>
having from 7 to 10 carbon atoms such as, for example, 1,7-heptanediyl, 1,8-octanediyl, 1,9-nonanediyl, 1,10-decanediyi and the like.<br>
As used herein before, the term (=0) forms a carbonyl moiety when attached to a carbon atom, a sulfoxide moiety when attached to a sulfur atom and a sulfonyl moiety when two of said terms are attached to a sulfur atom. The term (=N-OH) forms a hydroxylimine moiety when attached to a carbon atom.<br>
The term halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. As used in the foregoing and hereinafter, polyhaloC1-.6alkyl as a group or part of a group is defined as mono- or polyhalosubstituted C1-.6alkyl, in particular methyl with one or more fluoro atoms, for example, difluoromethyl or trifluoromethyl. In case more than one halogen atoms are<br><br>
attached to an alkyl group within the definition of polyhaloC1-.4alkyl, they may be the same or different.<br>
As described hereinabove, R1 defines a bicyclic heterocycle which may optionally be substituted. The substituents may be divided over both rings or they may be attached to one and the same ring.<br>
When any variable (e.g. aryl, R2,R3, R4, R5a, R5b etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent, each definition is independent.<br>
It will be appreciated that some of the compounds of formula (I) and their prodrugs, N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines, metal complexes and stereochemically isomeric forms may contain one or more centers of chirality and exist as stereochemically isomeric forms.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore defines all the possible stereoisomeric forms which the compounds of formula (I), and their prodrugs, N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines or physiologically functional derivatives may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of -compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure as well as each of the individual isomeric forms of formula (I) and their prodrugs, iV-oxides, salts, solvates or quatemary amines substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 10%, preferably less than 5%, in particular less than 2% and most preferably less than 1% of the other isomers. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention. As used hereinafter the terms trans or cis are well-known by the person skilled in the art.<br>
For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the counterion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases which are non-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether pharma¬ceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable acid and base addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid and base addition salt forms which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. The pharmaceutically<br><br>
acceptable acid addition salts can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acid. Appropriate acids comprise, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic (i.e. ethanedioic), malonic, succinic (i.e. butane-dioic acid), maleic, fumaric, malic (i.e. hydroxybutanedioic acid), tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids.<br>
Conversely said salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate base into the free base form.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) containing an acidic proton may also be converted into their non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like.<br>
The term addition salt as used hereinabove also comprises the solvates which the compounds of formula (I) as well as the salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are for example hydrates, alcoholates and the like.<br>
The term "quaternary amine" as used hereinbefore defines the quaternary ammonium salts which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted alkylhalide, aryihalide or aryiaikyihaiide, e.g. methyliodide or benzyliodide.- Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates, alkyl methanesulfonates, and alkyl p-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen. Pharmaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate and acetate. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins.<br>
It will be appreciated that the compounds of formula (I) may have metal binding, chelating, complexating properties and therefore may exist as metal complexes or metal chelates. Such metalated derivatives of the compounds of formula (I) are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
A special group of com pounds are those compounds of formula (I) wherein one or more of the following restrictions apply:<br>

The compounds of formula (I) show antiviral properties. Viral infections treatable using the compounds and methods of the present invention include those infections<br><br>

The in vitro antiviral activity against RSV of the present compounds was tested in a test as described in the experimental part of the description, and may also be demonstrated in a virus yield reduction assay. The in vivo antiviral activity against RSV of the present qompounds may be demonstrated in a test model using cotton rats as described in Wyde et al. (Antiviral Research (1998), 38, 31-42).<br>
Due to their antiviral properties, particularly their anti-RSV properties, the compounds of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, their prodrugs, iV-oxides; addition salts, quaternary amines, metal complexes and stereochemically isomeric forms, are useful in the treatment of individuals experiencing a viral infection, particularly a RSV infection, and for the prophylaxis of these infections. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals infected with viruses, in particular the respiratory syncytial virus.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may therefore be used as medicines. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the systemic" administration to viral infected subjects or to subjects susceptible to viral infections of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with the viral infection, in particular the RSV infection.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of the present compounds or any subgroup thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or the prevention of viral infections, particularly RSV infection.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form or metal complex, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical<br><br>
media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets.<br>
     Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in<br>
      which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered via oral inhalation or insufflation by means of methods and formulations employed in the art for administration via this way. Thus, in general the compounds of the present invention may be administered to the lungs in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry powder, a solution being preferred. Any system developed for the delivery of solutions, suspensions or dry powders via oral inhalation or insufflation are suitable for the administration of the present compounds.<br>
Thus, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition adapted for administration by inhalation or insufflation through the mouth comprising a compound of formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably, the compounds of the present invention are administered via inhalation of a solution in nebulized or aerosolized doses.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated<br><br>
tablets), capsules, pills, suppositories, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
In general it is contemplated that an antivirally effective daily amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from 0.1 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 1 to 1000 mg, and in particular 5 to 200 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight, sex, extent of disorder and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines.<br>
Also, the combination of another antiviral agent and a compound of formula (I) can be used as a medicine. Thus, the present invention also relates to a product containing (a) a compound of formula (I), and (b) another antiviral compound, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in antiviral treatment. The different drugs may be combined in a single preparation together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. For instance, the compounds of the present invention may be combined with iriterferon-beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha in order to treat or prevent RSV infections.<br>

C. Pharmacological example<br>
Example CI : In vitro screening for activity against Respiratory Syncytial Virus. The percent protection against cytopathology caused by viruses (antiviral activity or 5     ICso) achieved by tested compounds and their cytotoxicity (CC5o) were both calculated from dose-response curves. The selectivity of the antiviral effect is represented by the selectivity index (SI), calculated by dividing the CC50 (cytotoxic dose for 50% of the cells) by the ICso (antiviral activity for 50 % of the cells).<br>
10 Automated tetrazolium-based colorimetric assays were used for determination of ICso and CC50 of test compounds. Flat-bottom, 96-well plastic microliter trays were filled with 180 µll of Eagle's Basal Medium, supplemented with 5 % FCS (0% for FLU) and 20 mM Hepes buffer. Subsequently, stock solutions (7.8 x final test concentration) of compounds were added in 45 µl volumes to a series of triplicate wells so as to allow<br>
15     simultaneous evaluation of their effects on virus- and mock-infected cells. Five five¬fold dilutions were made directly in the microliter trays using a robot system. Untreated virus controls, and HeLa cell controls were included in each test. Approximately 100 TCID50 of Respiratory Syncytial Virus was added to two of the three rows in a volume of 50 |il. The same volume of medium was added to the third row to measure the<br>
20     cytotoxicity of the compounds at the same concentrations as those used to measure the antiviral activity. After two hours of incubation, a suspension (4 x 105 cells/ml) of HeLa cells was added to all wells in a volume of 50µl. The cultures were incubated at<br><br>
37°C in a 5% C02 atmosphere. Seven days after infection the cytotoxicity and the antiviral activity was examined spectrophotometrically. To each well of the microtiter tray, 25 µl of a solution of MTT (3-(4,5-dimemylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliurn bromide) was added. The trays were further incubated at 37°C for 2 hours, after which the medium was removed from each cup. Solubilization of the formazan crystals was achieved by adding 100 \i\ 2-propanol. Complete dissolution of the formazan crystals were obtained after the trays have been placed on a plate shaker for 10 min. Finally, the absorbances were read in an eight-channel computer-controlled photometer (Multiskan MCC, Flow Laboratories) at two wavelengths (540 and 690 nm). The absorbance measured at 690 nm was automatically subtracted from the absorbance at 540 nm, so as to eliminate the effects of non-specific absorption. Particular IC50, CC50 and SI values are listed in Table 15 hereinbelow. Table 15<br><br><br>
