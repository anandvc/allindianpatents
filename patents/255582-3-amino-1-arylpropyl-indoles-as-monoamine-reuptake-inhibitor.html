The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions, methods of using, and methods of preparing the aforementioned compounds.<br>
More particularly, this invention provides compounds usable as dual reuptalce inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrin, as well as related methods for making and using such compounds.<br>
Monoamine deficiency has been long been linked to depressive, arrxiolytic and other disorders (see, e.g.: Charney et al.,l. Clin. Psychiatiy (1998) 59, 1-14; Delgado et al., J. Clin. Psychiatry (2000) 67, 7-11; Resser et al., Depress. Anxiety (2000) 12 (Suppl 1) 2-19; and Hirschfeld et al., J. Clin. Psychiatry (2000) 61, 4-6. In particular, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine are recognized as key niodulatory neurotransrnitters that play an important role in mood regulation. Selective serotonin reuptalce inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram and escitalopram have provided treatments fox depressive disorders (Masand et al., Harv. Rev. Psychiatry (1999) 7, 69-84). Noradrenaline or norepinephrin reuptake inhibitors such as reboxetine, atomoxetine, desipramine and nortryptyline have provided effective treatments for depressive, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders (Scates et al., Ann. Pharmacother. (2000) 34,1302-1312; Tatsumi et al., Eur.j Pharmacol (1997) 340,249-258).<br>
Enhancement of serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission is recognized to be synergistic in the pharmacotherapy of depressive and anxiolytic disorders, in comparison with enhancement of only serotonin or norepinephrine neurotransmission alone (Thase et al., Br. J. Psychiatry (2001) 178, 234, 241; Iran et al., J. Clin. Psychopharmacology (2003) 23, 78-86). Dual reuptake inhibitors of both serotonin and norepinephrine, such as duloxetine, milnacipran and venlafaxine are currently under development for treatment of depressive and anxiolytic disorders (Mallinckrodt et al, J<br>
Clin. Psychiatry (2003) 5(1) 19-28; Bymaster et al., Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs (2003) 12(4) 531-543V Dual reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine also offer potential treatments for schizophrenia and other psychoses, dyskinesias, drug addition, cognitive disorders, Alzheimer's disease, obsessive-compulsive behaviour, attention deficit disorders, panic attacks, social phobias, eating disorders such as obesity, anorexia, bulimia and "binge-eating", stress, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidemia, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, seizure disorders such as epilepsy, and treatment of conditions associated with neurological damage resulting from stroke, brain trauma, cerebral .ischaemia, head injury and haemorrhage.   Dual reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and<br><br>
norepinephrine also offer potential treatments for disorders and disease states of the urinary tract, and for pain and inflammation.<br>
There is accordingly a need for compounds that are effective as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, norepmephrine reuptake inhibitors, and/or dual reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine, as well as methods of making and using such compounds in the treatment of depressive, anxiolytic, genitourinary, and other disorders. The present invention satisfies these needs.<br>

Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, esters (e.g., acetate, formate, and benzoate derivatives), carbamates (e.g., N,N-dimethyiaminocarbonyl) of hydroxy functional groups in compounds of formula I, N-acyl derivatives (e.g. N-acetyl) N-Mannich bases, Schiff bases and enaminones of amino functional groups, oximes, acetals, ketals and enol esters of ketone and aldehyde functional groups in compounds of Formula I, and the like, see Bundegaard, H. "Design of Prodrugs" pl-92, Elsevier, New York-Oxford (1985), and the like.<br>
"Protective group" or "protecting group" means the group which selectively blocks one reactive site in a multifunctional compound such that a chemical reaction can be carried out selectively at another unprotected reactive site in the meaning conventionally associated with it in synthetic chemistry. Certain processes of this invention rely upon the protective groups to block reactive nitrogen and/or oxygen atoms present in the reactants. For example, the terms "amino-protecting group" and "nitrogen protecting group" are used interchangeably herein and refer to those organic groups intended to protect the nitrogen atom against undesirable reactions during synthetic procedures.<br><br>
Exemplary nitrogen protecting groups include, but are not limited to, trifluoroacetyl, acetamido, benzyl (Bn): benzyloxycarbonyl (carbobenzyloxy, CBZ), p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), and the like.

Using the procedure described in Tetrahedron 56 (2000) 5479 - 5492, indole (5.0 g, 42.7 mmole) and 2,2-dimethyl-[l,3]dioxane-4,6-dione (6.15 g, 42.7 mmole) were mixed in acetonitrile (50 ml). To this mixture was added faenzaldehyde (9.06 g, 85.4 mmole) and dj-proline (0.25 g). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours after which time much of the reaction mixture had turned solid. The solvent was evaporated at reduced pressure and the residue was triturated with ether and filtered. The filter cake was washed with several portions of ether to afford pure 5-[(lH-indol-3-yl)-phenyl-methyl]-2,2-dimethyl-[l,3ldioxane-4,6-dione, 11.83 g, as a light pink solid (MS (M-H) = 348) which was used without further purification in the next step. Step 2 3-(lH-Indol-3-yl)-N-methyl-3-phenyl-propionamide<br><br><br>
5-[(lH-Indol-3-yI)-phenyl-methyl]-2,2-dimethyl-[1,3]dioxane-4,6-dione(0.500g)<br>
was dissolved in dry pyridine (5 ml) in a sealable test tube. To this solution was added methyl amine (2.0 ml, 2M in THF) and the tube was sealed and immersed in an oil bath which had been preheated to 120° C. The tube was heated at this temperature for 2 hours, after which time it was cooled and diluted with ice water. The product was extracted into ethyl acetate, washed with dilute HC1, dried (MgSO4) and evaporated to dryness to afford 0.338 g of 3-(lH-indol-3-yl)-N-methyl-3-phenyl-propionamide, (85%, MS (M+H) = 279), which was used in the following step without further purification. Step 3 [3-(lH-Indol-3-yl)-3-phenyl-propvl1-methyl-amine<br><br>
3-(lH-Indol-3-yl)-N-methyl-3-phenyl-propionamide (0.400 g) was dissolved in THF (20 ml) and treated with a solution of lithium aluminum hydride (3 ml 1 M in THF) at reflux for 4 hours at which time 2 ml of additional lithium aluminum hydride was added. After a total of 6 hours, the reaction mixture was cooled and sodium sulfate<br>
decahydrate (5 g) was cautiously added. The heterogeneous system was stirred for 15 minutes, filtered, and the filter cake was washed well with ethyl acetate. The filtrate was concentrated, and the product was isolated by chromatography on silica gel using . methylene chloride (130): methanol (10): ammonium hydroxide (1), thus affording pure [3-(lH-Indol-3-yl)-3-phenyl-propyl]-methyl-amine (0-235 g amorphous solid, MS<br>
(M+H = 265).<br>
Similarly prepared, using the appropriate substituted indoles as starting materials, were:<br>

3-Methylaniino-l-phenyl-propan-l-ol (1.65 g, 10 rnmole) was dissolved in methylene chloride (5 ml), and trifluoroacetic anhydride (5 g, 23.8 mmole) was added in portions. Following the brief exotherm which caused the solvent to boil, the mixture was<br><br>
evaporated to dryness and azeotroped twice with methylene chloride and once with toluene to remove any excess anhydride. The residue was taken up in methylene chloride, applied to a short silica gel column, and ehited with 3:7 ethyl acetate : hexane. The product thus isolated was pumped dry to afford trifluoro-acetic acid 3-[methyl-(2,2,2-trifluoro-acetyl)-amino]-l-phenyl-propyl ester, which was used in the following step without further purification. Step 2 [3- lH-Indol-3-yI)-3-phenyl-propyl] -methyl-amine<br><br>
Trifluoro-acetic acid 3-[methyl-(2,2,2-trifluoro-acetyI)-amino]-l-phenyl-propyl ester from step 1 was taken up in a minimum amount of methylene chloride and transferred to a sealable test tube. Indole (1.17 g, 10 mmole) was added to the solution and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. A small stirring bar was added, and the tube was sealed with a Teflon-lined cap and placed in a reaction block preheated to 1.10° C. The reaction was stirred for 30 minutes and then cooled.<br>
Methanol (45 ml) was added to the reaction, followed by sodium hydroxide solution (5 ml, 2N) (where base-sensitive substituents were present, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate was used instead of sodium hydroxide, with longer reaction times). The mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature overnight. Most of the methanol was removed under reduced pressure and the reaction mixture was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The layers were separated and the organic layer was evaporated to dryness to give 2.06 g of product as a foam. The crude product was taken up in methylene chloride and purified by chromatography on silica gel. After initial elution with methylene chloride and ethyl acetate, the product was eluted with methylene chloride (130): methanol (10): ammonium hydroxide (1) and isolated as an oil which eventually solidified (0.48 g). (M+H)+ = 265.3. Similarly prepared, using the appropriate substituted indoles in step 2, were:<br>

Screening for Human Serotonin Transporter (hSERT) Antagonists Using a Scintillation<br>
Proximity Assay (SPA)<br><br>
The screening assay of this example was used to determine the affinity of ligands at the hSERT transporter by competition with [3H]-Citalopram.<br>
Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) works by bringing radioligand within close proximity to the bead's scintillant to stimulate light emission. In this assay, the receptor-containing membranes were pre-coupled to the SPA beads and the binding of the appropriate radioligand to the transporter was measured. The light emission was proportional to the amount of bound radioligand. Unbound radioligand produced no signal as a result of distant proximity to scintillant (lack of energy transfer).<br>
HEK-293 cells (Tatsumi et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997, 30, 249-258) stably expressing recombinant hSERT were maintained with media (DMEM high glucose with 10% PBS, 300 μg/ml G418 and 2 mM L-Glutamine) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells are released from culture flasks using PBS for 1-2 minutes. The cells were subsequently centrifuged at 1000g's for 5 minutes and resuspended in PBS prior to being used in the membrane preparation.<br>
Cell membranes were prepared using a membrane preparation buffer of 50 mM TRIS (pH 7.4). Cell membranes were prepared from a single cube (7.5xl09cells total). Cells were homogenized using a Polytron (setting medium for a 4 second burst). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 48,000xg for 15 minutes, the supernatant subsequently removed and discarded, and the pellet resuspended with fresh buffer. After a second ceritrifugation, the pellet was re-homogenized and brought to a final volume determined during the assay. Typically, membrane portions were aliquoted in 3mg/ml<br>
(w:v). and stored at-80 °C,<br>
For Scintillation Proximity Assay IC50/Kj determination, 50 mM Tris-HCl and 300 mM NaCl, (pH 7.4) buffers were utilized. Compounds of the invention were diluted from 10 mM to 0.1 nM FAC (10 point curves, whole log /half log dilutions) VIaa Beckman Biomek 2000 using a serial dilution protocol. The test compounds were then transferred (20μl/well) and the [3H]-Citalopram radioligand was added at 50 μl/well. Membrane and beads were prepared to a ratio of 10 μg: 0.7 mg, with 0.7 mg PVT-WGA Amersham beads (Cat# RPQ0282V) added per well. 130μl of the membrane : bead mixture was added to the assay plate. The mixtures were allowed to stand at room temperature for one hour, and were then counted on a Packard TopCount LCS; a generic Scintillation Proximity Assay counting protocol settings (Energy Range: Low, Efficiency Mode: Normal, Region A: 1.50-35.00, Region B: 1.50-256.00, Count Time (min.): 0.40, Background Subtract: none, Half-Life Correction: no, Quench Indicator: tSIS, Platemap blank subtraction: No, Cross talk reduction: Off).<br><br>
The % inhibition was calculated for each compound tested [(Compound counts per minute (CPM) at maximum concentration-Non-Specinc CPM)/Total CPM * 100]. The concentration producing 50% inhibition (IC50) was determined using an iterative nonlinear curve fitting technique with Activity Base/Xlfit using the following equation:<br><br>
where max = total binding, min = non specific binding, x = concentration (M) of the tested compound and n = Hill slope. The inhibition dissociation constant (Ki) of each compound was determined according to the method of Cheng-Prusoff and then converted into negative logarithm (pKi) of the Ki.<br>
Using the above procedure, compounds of the invention were found to have affinity for human serotonin transporter. For example, [3-(4-methoxy-lH-indol-3-yl)-3-phenyl-propyl]-methyl-amine exhibited an IC50 of approximately 8.9 using the above assay.<br>
Example 16 Screening for compounds active at Human Norepinephrine Transporter (hNET) Using a<br>
Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA)<br>
This assay was used to determine the affinity of ligands for the hNET transporter by competition with [ H]-Nisoxetine. As in the hSERT assay of the above example, receptor-containing membranes were pre-coupled to the SPA beads and the binding of the appropriate radioligand to the transporter was measured. The light emission was proportional to the amount of bound radioligand, with unbound radioligand producing no signal.<br>
HEK-293 cells (Tatsumi et al, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997, 30,249-258) stably expressing recombinant hNET (Clone: HEK-hNET #2) were maintained with media (DMEM hi glucose with 10% FBS, 300 μg/ml G418 and 2 mM L-Glutamine) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were released from culture flasks using PBS for 1-2 minutes. The cells were subsequently centrifuged at lOOOg's for 5 minutes and resuspended in PBS prior to being used in the membrane preparation.<br>
Cell membranes were prepared using a membrane preparation buffer of 50 mM TRIS (pH 7.4). Cell membranes were prepared from a single cube (7.5x109 cells total). Cells were homogenized using a Polytron (setting medium for a 4 second burst). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 48,000xg for 15 minutes, the supernatant subsequently removed and discarded, and the pellet resuspended with fresh buffer. After a second centrifugation, the pellet was re-homogenized and brought to a final volume determined during the assay. Typically, membrane portions were aliquoted in 3-6 mg/ml<br>
(w:v). and stored at-80 °C.<br><br>
3[H] Nisoxetine radioligand (Amersham Cat. # TRK942 or Perldn Elmer Cat. # NET10S4, specific activity: 70-87 Ci/mmol, stock concentration: 1.22e-5 M, final concentration: 8.25e-9 M), and 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM Nad, (pH 7.4) buffers were used for Scintillation Proximity Assay IC50/Ki determination. Compounds of the invention were diluted from 10 mM to 0.1 nM FAC (10 point curves, whole log /half log dilutions) VIaa Beckman Biomek 2000 using a serial dilution protocol. The test compounds were then transferred (20ul/well) and the radioligand was added at 50 μl/well. Membrane and beads were prepared to a ratio of 10 μg : 0.7 mg, with 0.7 mg PVT-WGA Amersham beads (Cat # RPQ0282V) added per well. 130 μl of the membrane: bead mixture was added to the assay plate. The mixtures were allowed to stand at room temperature for one hour, and were then counted on a Packard TopCount LCS, a generic SPA counting protocol settings (Energy Range: Low, Efficiency Mode: Normal, Region A: 1.50-35.00, Region B: 1.50-256.00, Count Time (min.): 0-40, Background Subtract: none, Half-Life Correction: no, Quench Indicator: tSIS, Platemap blank subtraction: No, Cross talk reduction: Off).<br>
The % inhibition was calculated for each compound tested [(Compound CPM at maximum concentration-Non-Specific CPM)/Total CPM * 100]. The concentration producing 50% inhibition (IC50) was determined using an iterative non-linear curve fitting technique with Activity Base/Xlfit using the following equation:<br><br>
where max = total binding, min = non specific binding, x = concentration (M) of the tested compound and n = Hill slope. The inhibition dissociation constant (Ki) of each compound was determined according to the method of Cheng-Prusoff and then converted into negative logarithm (pKi) of the Ki.<br>
Using the above procedure, compounds of the invention were found to have affinity for the human norepinephrine transporter. For example, [3-(4-methoxy-lH-indo]-3-yl)-3-phenyl-propyl ]-methyl-amine exhibited an IC50 of approximately 7.3 using the. above assay.<br>
