URACIL SUBSTITUTED PHENYL SULFAMOYL CARBOXAMIDES Description<br>
Weeds cause tremendous global economic losses by reducing crop yields and lowering crop quality. Worldwide, agronomic crops must compete with hundreds of weed species.<br>
In spite of the commercial herbicides available today, damage to crops caused by weeds still occurs. Accordingly, there is ongoing research to create more effective and/or more selective herbicidal agents.<br>
In WO 98/06706 are disclosed the use of certain p trifluoro-mesylphenyl uracils, their method of production and their use as herbicides. In addition, WO 96/08151 discloses herbicidal aryl uracils and arylthio uracils in which the aryl ring is an optionally substituted phenyl group. In neither disclosure, however is there mentioned a sulfamoyl carboxamide group substituent.<br>
Therefore, it was an object of the present invention to provide novel 3-phenyluracils which are highly effective for the control of undesirable plant species. The object also extends to providing novel compounds which act as desiccants/defoliants.<br>
It was also an object of the present invention to provide a method for the control of undesirable plant species and compositions useful therefor.<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention that the method for the control of undesirable plant species may be employed in the presence of a crop.<br>
It was a further object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of herbicidal phenylsulfamoyl carboxamides and an intermediate compound useful therefor.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the detailed description thereof set forth below.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved in accordance with the invention by the novel uracil substituted phenylsulfamoyl   of the formula I<br><br><br>
wherein the variables have the following meanings:<br>
A   oxygen or sulfur;<br>

and the agriculturally useful salts of the compounds I.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to<br>
the use of the compounds I as herbicides and/or for the<br>
desiccation/defoliation of plants,<br>
herbicidal compositions and compositions for the<br>
desiccation/defoliation of plants which comprise compounds I<br>
as active substances,<br>
processes for preparing the compounds I and herbicidal<br>
compositions and compositions for the desiccation/defoliation<br>
of plants using the compounds I,<br>
methods for controlling undesirable vegetation and for the<br>
desiccation/defoliation of plants using the compounds I, and<br>
novel intermediates of the formula II.<br><br>
wherein Q, X’ and X’ are as defined hereinabove, with the proviso that Q must be other than Q’i,<br><br>
Preferred compounds of the formulae I and II can be seen from the sub-claims and from the description which follows.<br>
Depending on the substitution pattern, the compounds of the formula I can contain one or more chiral centers, in which case they exist in the form of enantiomer or diastereomer mixtures This invention provides both the pure enantiomers or diasteromers and mixtures thereof.<br>
Agriculturally useful salts are in particular the salts of those cations and the acid addition salts of those acids whose cations and anions, respectively, do not adversely affect the herbicidal activity of the compounds I. Suitable cations are therefore in particular the ions of the alkali metals, preferably sodium and potassium, of the alkaline earth metals, preferably calcium, magnesium and barium, and of the transition metals, preferably manganese, copper, zinc and iron, and the ammonium ion, which may carry one to four Ci-C4-alkyl substituents, and/or one phenyl or benzyl substituent, preferably diisopropylammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetrabutylammonium, trimethylbenzylammonium, and furthermore phosphonium ions, sulfonium ions’ preferably tri (Ci-C4-alkyl)sulfonium and sulfoxonium ions, preferably tri (Ci-C4-alkyl)sulfoxonium.<br>
Anions of useful acid addition salts are primarily chloride, bromide, fluoride, hydrogensulfate, sulfate, dihydrogenphosphate, hydrogenphosphate, phosphate, nitrate, hydrogencarbonate, carbonate, hexafluorosilicate, hexafluorophosphate, benzoate, and the anions of Ci-C4-alkanoic acids, preferably formate, acetate, propionate and butyrate.<br>
The organic moieties mentioned for the substituents X’ and R’ to R’i or as radicals on phenyl or heterocyclic rings are collective terms for individual enumerations of each of the group members, as is the meaning halogen. All carbon chains, ie. all alkyl, haloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and phenylalkyl moieties can be straight-chain or branched.<br>
The terms haloalkyl, haloalkoxy and haloalkenyl as used in the specification and claims designate an alkyl group, an alkoxy group or an alkenyl group substituted with one or more halogen atoms, respectively. The halogen atoms may be the same or different,<br>
Halogenated substituents preferably have attached to them one to five identical or different halogen atoms.<br><br>
In formula I above, 4- to 10-membered monocyclic or fused bicyclic, heterocyclic rings include, but are not limited to, benz imidazole, imidazole, imidazoline-2-thione, indole, isotopic anhydride, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, purine, pyrazole, pyrrole, pyrrolidine and 1,2,4-triazole rings, wherein each ring is optionally substituted with one or more groups independently selected from halogen, cyano, nitro, amino, hydroxyl, Ci"C4-alkyl, Ci-C’-haloalkyl, Ci-C4-alkoxy, Ci"C4-haloalkoxy or C1-C4-haloalkyl-sulfonyl groups.<br>
When the terms phenyl or benzyl are designated as being optionally substituted, the substituents which are optionally present may be any one or more of those customarily employed in the development of pesticide compounds and/or the modification of such compounds to influence their structure/activity, persistence, penetration or other property. Specific examples of such substituents include, for example, halogen atoms, nitro, cyano, thiocyanato, cyanato, hydroxyl, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, formyl, alkoxy-carbonyl, carboxyl, alkanoyl, alkylthio, alkylsulphinyl, alkyl-sulfonyl, carbamoyl, alkylamido, phenyl, phenoxy, benzyl, benzyl -oxy, heterocyclyl, especially furyl, and cycloalkyl, expecially cyclopropyl, groups. Typically, zero to three substituents may be present. When any of the foregoing substituents represents or contains an alkyl substituent group, this may be linear or branched and may contain up to 12, preferably up to 6, and especially up to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
In formula I above, 3- to 7-membered heterocyclic rings include, but are not limited to, imidazole and phthalimide rings wherein each ring is optionally substituted with any combination of one to three halogen atoms, one to three C1-C4-alkyl groups, one to three C1-C4-haloalkyl groups, one to three C1-C4-alkoxy groups, or one to three C1-C4-haloalkoxy groups.<br>

A)  Reaction of a benzoic acid derivative II with a sulfamide III, optionally in the presence of a coupling agent such as N,N-carbonyldiimidazole (GDI) or after converting II into the corresponding acid chloride:<br><br><br>
N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (GDI) is added to a solution of the carboxylic acid derivative of formula II in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. The resulting mixture is stirred under reflux for a sufficient period of time to allow the reaction to come to completion, and is then cooled to room temperature. An optionally substituted sulfamide III is added followed by diazabicycloundecane (DBU) and the mixture is stirred until the reaction is complete. Standard workup and isolation methods give the product in purified form.<br>
The benzoic acid derivatives II - and the corresponding carboxylates, which can be saponified in a simply manner to give the free acids II -   are known from the literature or can be prepared analogously to methods known from the literature.<br>
The methods for saponifying the esters to the benzoic acid derivatives II are sufficiently well known to the skilled artisan; consequently/ details are not necessary. By way of example, reference is made to Kocienski, "Protecting Groups",-Thieme Verlag 199 4, and Greene, Wuts, Protecting groups in organic synthesis, Wiley 1999, and Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, Vol. E5, Part I (1985), pp. 223 et seq.<br>
in addition to activation to the imidazolones other methods are also suitable.<br>
Various methods are suitable for activating the acids. They can, for example, be converted to the acid chloride by treating them with SOCI2/ JTOCls, PCI5, COCI2 or (C0C1)2. Alternatively, the imidazolide can be prepared by reaction with N,N-carbonyldiimida20le, The methods used are sufficiently well known to the skilled artisan, e.g., from Houben Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Vol. E5 (1985), Part 1, pp* 587 et seq. and Vol. E5 (1985), Part II, pp. 934 et seq.<br>

Hal = halogen, preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine.<br>
By this route, an aniline of formula IV is converted to a diazonium salt, then treated with iodine and potassium iodide to give the iodo compound of the formula V. Reaction of formula V compounds with an unsubstituted QH moiety, for example, a uracil of formula Q’’H in the presence of a copper(I) catalyst gives a final product of formula Iain this way, compounds I according to the invention where Q = Q21 can be obtained, by analogy to the method disclosed by T, Mainyama, K. Fujiwara and M, Fukuhara in J. Chem, Soc, Perkin Trans. 1995 (7), pp. 733-734, where Hal = iodine, and the reaction is carried out with the addition of a Cu(I) source.<br>
However, transition-metal-free methods are also suitable if the substituents Hal, X’ and X’ are properly selected. In this respect, reference is made by way of example to WO 95/39392, which describes methods which are suitable for the manufacture of compounds I where Q = Q’"‘,<br>
The haloaryl precursors V can be obtained by a Sandmeyer reaction from the corresponding anilines (see also formula scheme V), These methods are sufficiently well known to the skilled artisan, so reference is only made here to Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Org. Chemie, Vol. 5/4, 4th edition 1960, pp. 438 et seq.<br><br>
Reaction of an aniline intermediate VI with an oxazinone compound of the formula VII to give a compound I where A is oxygen, X’ is hydrogen, Q is Q’’, A’ &amp; A’ are oxygen and R’’ is hydrogen, optionally followed by alkylation and hydrolysis:<br><br>
R2’-Hal represents a C1-C6-alkyl, C1-C6-haloalkyl, C’-C-j-cycloalkyl, C2-C6-alkenyl, C2-C6-haloalkenyl or Ca’Cg-alkynyl<br>
halide.<br>
Among the methods known for the preparation of oxazinone compounds VII are those described in WO 99/14216,<br>
Formula Vl aniline derivatives may be prepared by conventional procedures such as the conversion of the appropriately substituted benzoic acid IX to the corresponding sulfamoyl carboxamide X (see method A) above), which in turn is then nitrated and reduced:<br><br><br>
Suitable nitration reagents are for example nitric acid in various concentrations, including concentrated and fuming nitric acid, mixtures of sulfuric and nitric acid, and acetyl nitrates and alkyl nitrates.<br>
The reaction can be carried out either without a solvent in an excess of the nitration reagent or in an inert solvent or diluent, suitable agents being, for example, water, mineral acids, organic acids, halohydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, anhydrides such as acetic anhydride, and mixtures thereof*<br>
The sulfamoyl carboxamide X and the nitration reagent are expediently employed in approximately equimolar amounts; with regard to the yield of X, it may be advantageous to use the nitration reagent in an excess of up to about 10 times the molar amount, based on the amount of X, When the reaction is carried out without a solvent in the nitration reagent, the latter is present in an even greater excess.<br>
The reaction temperature is generally from (-100)°C to 200’’0, preferably from (-30) to 50°C,<br>
The nitrated compounds XI can then be reduced to the aniline derivatives VI,<br>
The reduction is generally carried out by reaction of the nitro compound with a transition metal such as iron, zinc or tin under acidic conditions or with a complex hydride such as<br><br>
lithium aluminium hydride and sodium borohydride, the reduction being carried out in bulk or in a solvent or diluent.<br>
Examples of suitable solvents are - depending on the reducing agent selected - water, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol, or ethers such as diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and ethylene glycol dimethyl ether.<br>
If a metal is used for reduction purposes, it is preferable to work without a solvent in an inorganic acid, especially in concentrated or dilute hydrochloric acid, or in a liquid organic acid such as acetic acid and propionic acid. However, the acid can also be diluted with an inert solvent, e.g., one of those mentioned above. The reduction with complex hydrides is carried out preferably in a solvent, for example an ether or an alcohol.<br>
The nitrated compound XI and the reducing agent are frequently used in approximately equimolar amounts; to optimize the reaction it may however be advantageous to use either component in an excess of up to about the 10-fold molar amount.<br>
The amount of acid is not critical. So as to reduce the starting compound as completely as possible, it is expedient to use at least an equivalent amount of acid. Frequently, the acid is used in excess, based on the nitrated compound XI,<br>
The reaction temperature is generally from (-30) to 200°C, preferably from 0 to SO’’C.<br>
For working up, the reaction mixture is as a rule diluted with water and the product is isolated by filtration, crystallization or extraction with a solvent which is substantially immiscible with water, e.g., ethyl acetate, diethyl ether or methylene chloride. If desired, the product VI can then be purified in conventional manner.<br>
The nitro group of compounds XI can also be hydrogenated catalytically with hydrogen. Examples of suitable catalysts to this end are Raney nickel, palladium on charcoal, palladium oxide, platinum and platinum oxide. An amount of from 0,05 to 50 mol%, based on the compound XI to be reduced, is generally sufficient.<br><br>
It is possible to dispense with a solvent, or to use an inert solvent or diluent, e.g., acetic acid, a mixture of acetic acid and water, ethyl acetate, ethanol or toluene. When the catalyst has been separated off, the reaction solution can be worked up as usual to give the product vi, Hydrogenation can be effected at atmospheric or superatmospheric hydrogen pressure-<br>
Further methods and reaction conditions are given in the literature (see, for example, Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, nitrogen compounds I, Part 1 (1971), Vol. X/1, pp, 463 et seqj.<br>
Not only the compounds I according to the invention where Q = Q21, but also compounds I where 0 = 0"‘, Q’’ or Q’*’ can be produced from the aniline derivatives VI, To prepare compounds I where Q = Q22, reference is made to the methods described in WO 00/50409 and EP-A 584 655, and to prepare compounds I where Q = Q’°, reference is made to the methods taught in WO 94/10173 and WO 00/01700.<br>
The aniline derivatives VI can, however, also be converted in conventional manner (see, for example, WO 97/07104 and Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Vol, El, nitrogen compounds) to the corresponding hydrazines, from which compounds I where Q = Q’ Oder Q’"‘ can be prepared.<br>
Further methods for preparing compounds I according to the invention are given in Boger, Wakabayashi Peroxidizing herbicides. Springer Verlag 1999,<br>
Reacting a benzoic acid derivative VIII with an electrophilic amination reagent in the presence of a base to give the corresponding N-amino uracil benzoic ester, hydrolyzing said ester to give the benzoic acid II (with Q = Q’’; A’ &amp; A’ = 0; R2’ = NH2) and converting the latter to the compounds I (A = 0; Q = Q21; A’ &amp; A’ = 0; R’’ = NH2) by the route described above:<br><br><br>
Examples of electrophilic amination reagents are in particular 2,4-dinitrophenylhydroxylamine and 0-mesitylene-sulfonyl hydroxylamine.<br>
Examples of suitable reaction conditions are given in DE-A 19 652 431,<br>
All the processes described above are expediently carried out under atmospheric pressure or under the inherent pressure of the reaction mixture in question.<br>
As a rule, the reaction mixtures are worked up by methods known per se, for example by removing the solvent, partitioning the residue between a mixture of water and a suitable organic solvent and working up the organic phase to obtain the product.<br>
The uracil substituted phenyl sulfamoyl carboxamides I according to the invention can be obtained from the preparation as isomer mixtures which, if desired, can be separated into the pure isomers by the methods conventionally used for this purpose, eg* by means of crystallization or chromatography on an optically active adsorbate. Pure optically active isomers can, for example, also be prepared from suitable optically active starting materials,<br><br>
Compounds I with C-H acidic substituents can be converted into their alkali metal salts in a manner known per se by reaction with a base of the corresponding cation.<br>
Salts of I whose metal ion is not an alkali metal ion can normally be prepared by double decomposition of the corresponding alkali metal salt in agueous solution.<br>
Other metal salts, such as manganese, copper, zinc, iron, calcium, magnesium and barium salts, can be prepared from the sodium salts in the customary manner, and also ammonium and phosphonium salts by means of ammonia, phosphonium, sulfonium or sulfoxonium hydroxides*<br>
The compounds I and their agriculturally useful salts are suitable as herbicides, both in the form of isomer mixtures and in the form of the pure isomers. The herbicidal compositions comprising I effect very good control of vegetation on non-crop areas, especially at high rates of application. In crops such as wheat, rice, maize, soybeans and cotton they act against broad-leaved weeds and grass weeds without damaging the crop plants substantially. This effect is observed especially at low rates of application.<br>
Depending on the application method in question, the compounds I, or compositions comprising them, can additionally be employed in a further number of crop plants for eliminating undesirable plants. Examples of suitable crops are the following: Allium cepa. Ananas comosus, Arachis hypogaea. Asparagus officinalis. Beta vulgaris spec, altissima. Beta vulgaris spec. rapa, Brassica napus var. napus, Brassica napus var. napobrassica, Brassica rapa var, silvestris. Camellia sinensis, Carthamus tinctorius, Carya illinoinensis. Citrus limon. Citrus sinensis, Coffea arabica (Coffea canephora, Coffea liberica), Cucumis sativus, Cynodon dactylon, Daucus carota, Elaeis guineensis, Fragaria vesca. Glycine max, Gossypium hirsutum,<br>
(Gossypium arboreum, Gossypium herbaceum, Gossypium vitifolium), Helianthus annuus, Hevea brasiliensis, Hordeum vulgare, Humulus lupulus, Ipomoea batatas, Juglans regia. Lens culinaris, Linum usitatissimum, Lycopersicon lycopersicum, Malus spec, Manihot esculenta, Medicago sativa, Musa spec., Nicotiana tabacum<br>
(N,rustica), Olea europaea, Oryza sativa, Phaseolus lunatus, Phaseolus vulgaris, Picea abies, Pinus spec, Pisum sativum, Prunus avium, Prunus persica, Pyrus communis, Ribes sylvestre, Ricinus communis, Saccharum officinarum, Secale cereale, Solanum tuberosum. Sorghum bicolor (s. vulgare), Theobroma cacao, Trifolium pratense, Triticum aestivum, Triticum durum, Vicia<br><br>
faba, Vitis vinifera and Zea mays,<br>
Moreover, the compounds I may also be used in crops which have been made fully or partially tolerant to the action of herbicides due to breeding including genetic engineering methods-<br>
Furthermore, the substituted hydroximic acid derivatives I are also suitable for the desiccation and/or defoliation of plants.<br>
As desiccants, they are especially suitable for desiccating the aerial parts of crop plants such as potatoes, oilseed rape, sunflowers and soybeans. This allows completely mechanical harvesting of these important crop plants.<br>
Also of economic interest is facilitated harvesting, which is made possible by concentrating, over a period of time, dehiscence, or reduced adhesion to the tree, in the case of citrus fruit, olives or other species and varieties of pomaceous fruit, stone fruit and nuts. The same mechanism, ie. promotion of the formation of abscission tissue between fruit or leaf and shoot of the plants, is also essential for readily controllable defoliation of useful plants, in particular cotton*<br>
Moreover, a shortened period of time within which the individual cotton plants ripen results in an increased fiber quality after harvesting.<br>
The compounds I, or the compositions comprising them, can be employed, for example, in the form of directly sprayable aqueous solutions, powders, suspensions, also highly-concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for spreading or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, spreading or pouring* The use forms depend on the intended purposes; in any case, they should guarantee the finest possible distribution of the active ingredients according to the invention,<br>
Suitable inert additives are essentially: mineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling point such as kerosene and diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, eg* paraffins, tetrahydronaphthalene,. alkylated naphthalenes and their derivatives, alkylated benzenes and their derivatives, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol and cyclohexanol, ketones such as cyclohexanone or strongly polar solvents, eg, amines such as N-methylpyrrolidone or water.<br><br>
Acxueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes, wettable powders or water-dispersible granules by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substituted hydroximic acid derivatives as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. However, it is also possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and these concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, eg. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, of alkyl- and alkylaryl sulfonates, of alkyl sulfates, lauryl ether sulfates and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols, and of fatty alcohol glycol ether, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene, or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids, with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl-or nonylphenol&gt; alkylphenyl and tributylphenyl polyglycol ether, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers or polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignin-sulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or concommitantly grinding the active substances with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules, eg. coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules, can be prepared by binding the active ingredients to solid carriers. Solid carriers are mineral earths such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas and products of vegetable origin such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers*<br>
The concentrations of the active ingredients I in the ready-to-use products can be varied within wide ranges. In general, the formulations comprise approximately from 0.001 to 98% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 95% by weight, of at least one<br><br>
active ingredient. The active ingredients are normally employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum)*<br>
The formulation examples below illustrate the preparation of such formulations:<br>

carboxamide I are mixed with 97 parts by weight of finely<br>
divided kaolin. This gives a dust which comprises 3% by<br>

The active ingredients I, or the herbicidal compositions comprising them, can be applied pre- or post-emergence. If the active ingredients are less well tolerated by certain crop plants, application techniques may be used in which the herbicidal compositions are sprayed, with the aid of the spray apparatus, in such a way that they come into as little contact as possible, if any, with the leaves of the sensitive crop plants while reaching the leaves of undesirable plants which grow underneath, or the bare soil (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
Depending on the intended aim of the control measures, the season, the target plants and the growth stage, the application rates of active ingredient are from 0.001 to 3,0, preferably 0.01 to 1 kg/ha active substance (a,s.).<br><br>
To widen the spectrum of action and to achieve synergistic effects, the substituted hydroximic acid derivatives I can be mixed and applied jointly with a large number of representatives of other groups of herbicidally or growth-regulatory active ingredients. Suitable components in mixtures are, for example, 1,2,4-thiadiazoles, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles, amides, aminophosphoric acid and its derivatives, aminotriazoles, anilides, (het)aryloxyalkanoic acids and their derivatives, benzoic acid and its derivatives, benzothiadiazinones, 2-aroyl'l,3-cyclohexanediones, hetaryl aryl ketones, benzylisoxazolidinones, meta-CF3-phenylderivatives, carbamates, guinolinecarboxylic acid and its derivatives, chloroacetanilides, cyclohexane-1,3-dione derivatives, diazines, dichloropropionic acid and its derivatives, dihydrobenzofurans,<br>
dihydrofuran-3-ones, dinitroanilines, dinitrophenols, diphenyl ethers, dipyridyls, halocarboxylic acids and their derivatives, ureas, 3-phenyluracils, imidazoles, imidazolinones, N-phenyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimides, oxadiazoles, oxiranes, phenols, aryloxy- or hetaryloxyphenoxypropionic esters, phenylacetic acid and its derivatives, phenylpropionic acid and its derivatives, pyrazoles, phenylpyrazoles, pyridazines, pyridinecarboxylic acid and its derivatives, pyrimidyl ethers, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, triazines, triazinones, triazolinones, triazolecarboxamides and uracils.<br>
Moreover, it may be advantageous to apply the compounds I, alone or in combination with other herbicides, in the form of a mixture with additional other crop protection agents, for example with pesticides or agents for controlling phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the miscibility with mineral salt solutions which are employed for treating nutritional and trace element deficiencies, Non-phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates can also be added-<br>

2--Fluoro-4-chloro-5-(5-trifluoromethyl’pyridazin-3-on-2’yl)-<br>
benzoic acid<br>
Pyridazinone ester II with X’ = F, X’ = CI, Q = Q’'‘, R34 = H, R’’ = CF3 and R36 = H (3 g, 8.56 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous CH2CI2 (100 ml). A solution of BBr3 (30 ml, 1 M in CH2CI2, 30 mmol) was<br><br>
added to the solution and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 17 hours. Water (50 ml) was added and the mixture stirred vigorously for 3 hours.  A rotary evaporator was used to remove the CH2CI2 and the suspended solid was filtered, washed with water and dried to give 2.76 g of the product as a pale yellow solid. Yield: 95%.<br>
Using an identical procedure, the ester II with X’ = F, X’ = CI, Q = Q27’ R34 = H, R35 = CF3 and R36= CH3, shown above, was converted to the corresponding acid III in 97% yield.<br>

benzoyl}-N-isopropyl-N-methylsulfenamides<br>
The carboxylic acid III with x’ = F, X’ = ci, Q = Q’’, R34 = H, R’S = CF3 and R’’= CH3 (0,71 g, 2.10 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (15 ml) and GDI (0.51 g, 3,15 mmol) was added as a single portion.  The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes.  The mixture was refluxed for 5 minutes, then cooled to room temperature.  The sulfamide (0,32 g, 2.10 mmol) was added, followed by DBU (0.48 g, 3.15 mmol).  The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 17 hours.  5% strength HCl (15 ml) and ethyl acetate (10 ml) were added to the reaction, and the mixture was stirred vigorously for 10 minutes.  The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 15 ml) and the combined extracts were washed with water, dried over MgS04 and concentrated in a rotary evaporator to give a brown semi-solid.  The crude product was purified by chromatography on a basic alumina column (eluted with CH2CI2, 1%, 2% H3C-OH/CH2CI2 then 1% acetic acid/ CH2CI2) to give the final product Ida.xxx (0.45g) as an off-white solid.

USE EXAMPLES FOR THE HERBICIDAL ACTIVITY<br>
EXAMPLE 147: Postemergence herbicidal evaluation of test<br>
compounds<br>
The herbicidal activity of the compounds of the present invention was evaluated by the following tests.<br>
Seedling plants were grown in jiffy flats for about two weeks. The test compounds were dispersed in 80/20 acetone/water mixtures containing 1,0% SUN-IT®II, a methylated seed oil, in sufficient<br><br>
quantities to provide the equivalent of about 0,016 to 0.032 kg per hectare of active compound when applied to the plants through a spray nozzle operating at 40 psi for a predetermined time. After spraying, the plants were placed on greenhouse benches and were cared for in accordance with conventional greenhouse procedures.  Approximately two to three weeks after treatment, the seedling plants were examined and rated according to the rating scale (0-9) set forth below. Where more than one test is involved for a given compound, the data are averaged, Results obtained are reported in Table I below.  Where more than one test is involved for a given compound, the data are averaged.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 148: Preemergence herbicidal evaluation Of test compounds<br>
The herbicidal activity of the compounds of the present invention was evaluated by the following tests wherein the seeds of a variety of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants were separately mixed with potting soil and planted on top of approximately one inch of soil in separate pint cups.  After planting, the cups were sprayed with the selected aqueous acetone solution containing test compound in sufficient quantity to provide the equivalent of about 0,125 to 0,250 kg per hectare of test compound per cup.  The treated cups were then placed on greenhouse benches, watered and cared for in accordance with conventional greenhouse procedures.  From two to four weeks after treatment, the tests were terminated and each cup was examined and rated according to the .rating system provided in Example 94. When more than one test was performed for a given compound, the data were averaged. The results obtained are shown in Table B.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 149<br>
The herbicidal action of the uracil substituted phenyl sulfamoyl carboxamides no. Ij,86, Ip.86 and Iy,86 was demonstrated by the following greenhouse experiments:<br>
The culture containers used were plastic flowerpots containing loamy sand with approximately 3.0% of humus as substrate. The seeds of the test plants were sown separately for each species.<br>
For the post-emergence treatment, the test plants were grown to a plant height of from 3 to 15 cm, depending on the plant habit, and only then treated with the active ingredients which had been suspended or emulsified in water. To this end, the test plants were either sown directly and grown in the same containers, or they were first grown separately as seedlings and transplanted into the test containers a few days prior to treatment. The rate of application for the post-emergence treatment was 15.6 or 7.8 g/ha active ingredient.<br>
Depending on the species, the plants were kept at from 10 - 25*’0 and 20 -  35'='C, respectively. The test period extended over 2 to 4 weeks. During this time, the plants were tended, and their response to the individual treatments was evaluated.<br>
Evaluation was carried out using a scale of from 0 to 100. 100 means no emergence of the plants, or complete destruction of at least the aerial parts, and 0 means no damage or normal course of growth.<br><br>
At a rate of application of 15.6 or 7.8 g/ha of a.i., compound nos, Ij.86, Ip.86 and Iy.86 showed a very good herbicial action against the abovementioned undesired plants.<br>
DESICCANT/DEFOLIANT ACTIVITY OF THE COMPOUNDS I EXAMPLE 150: greenhouse-trials<br><br>
The test plants used were young cotton plants with 4 leaves (without cotyledons) which had been grown under greenhouse conditions (relative atmospheric humidity 50 to 70%; day/night temperature 27/20°C),<br>
The young cotton plants were subjected to foliar treatment to run-off point with aqueous preparations of the active ingredients (with an addition of 0,15% by weight of the fatty alcohol alkoxylate Plurafac® LF 700 ), based on the spray mixture). The amount of water applied was 1000 1/ha (converted). After 13 days, the number of leaves shed and the degree of defoliation in % were determined.<br>
No leaves were shed in the untreated control plants, ‘  a low-foam, nonionic surfactant from BASF AG<br>
EXAMPLE 151: field trials<br>
Field evaluations of preharvest desiccant activity were performed at several different locations using compound la.86,<br>
In each experiment treatments was replicated three times in a randomised complete block experimental design. Potatoes were grown using good agronomic practices of each area. Treatments were applied a few weeks before planned potato harvest.<br>
The test compound was formulated as an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulation with 120 grams a,i,/liter.  The formulation was diluted with water, spray adjuvants were added, and the treatment solution was applied to the foliage of potatoes in from 187 to 600 1/ha of total spray volume.  Unless indicated otherwise, the treatments also contained 15 v/v of methylated seed oil adjuvant (Hasten or SUN-IT II.  In the case of split applications, the second application was made about 1 week after the initial application.<br>
At various intervals after treatment, desiccation of stems and leaves was evaluated separately, on a visual % desiccation scale. In each test the test compound was compared to appropriate commercial standards at the normal rate for each standard for the area.<br>
The results showed that the abovementioned compound is very effective to desiccate the leaves and stems of potato plants.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
