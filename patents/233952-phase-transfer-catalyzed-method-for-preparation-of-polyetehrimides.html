				<td>PHASE TRANSFER CATALYZED METHOD FOR PREPARATION OF<br>
POLYETHER1MIDES<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the preparation of polyether polymers and more particularly<br>
to an improved method for such preparation in a phase transfer catalyzed reaction. In<br>
a particular embodiment the invention relates to the preparation of polyetherimides in<br>
a phase transfer catalyzed reaction.<br>
Polyetherimides have become an important genus of engineering resins because of<br>
their excellent properties. Conventionally, they have been prepared by the reaction of<br>
an aromatic diamine with an aromatic dianhydride. This method, however, has a<br>
disadvantage in that it requires many steps for preparation of the dianhydride,<br>
including, for example, the conversion of phthalic anhydride to an N-alkylimide,<br>
nitration of said N-alkylimide, displacement of the nitro group with an alkali metal<br>
salt of a dihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon and an exchange reaction with<br>
phthalic anhydride to afford the dianhydride.<br>
It has also long been known to prepare polyetherimides by a displacement reaction of<br>
an alkali metal salt of a dihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon with an aromatic<br>
bis(substituted phthalimide). As originally developed, this reaction required the use of<br>
expensive dipolar aprotic solvents and the product tended to develop color and be<br>
contaminated with various by-products,<br>
U.S. Patent 5,229.482 discloses a displacement method for the preparation of<br>
polyetherimides from bis(chlorophthalimides) using a solvent of low polarity such as<br>
o-dichlorobenzene, in the presence of a thermally stable phase transfer catalyst such<br>
as a hexaalkylguanidinium halide. U.S. Patent 5,830,974 discloses a similar method<br>
using a monoalkoxybenzene such as anisole as solvent. These methods made it<br>
possible, for the first time, to envision the commercial production of polyetherimides<br>
by the displacement method.<br>
Nevenhekss, severai problems remain to be solved for the optimum development of<br>
the displacement reaction for polyetherimide preparation. First, there has been no<br>
method for control of molecular weight of the product, other than limiting reaction<br>
time. Second, the amount of phase transfer catalyst required for polyetherimide<br>
preparation in substantial yield is high, typically on the order of 5 mole percent based<br>
on bis(chlorophtha)imide). Third, the product typically contains relatively large<br>
proportions, typically 8-10% by weight, of cyclic oligomers. While the preparation<br>
and ring-opening polymerization of cyclic poiyetherimide oligomers may be a useful<br>
alternative to other polymerization methods, the presence of such oligomers as byproducts<br>
in the linear polymer can adversely affect its properties and increase its<br>
polydispersity (Mw/Mn). Fourth, endcapping methods that might minimize problems<br>
resulting from the presence of reactive end groups have not been known. Fifth, the<br>
effects of such variables as impurity level and stoichiometric imbalance of the<br>
reagents have been unknown.<br>
It is of interest, therefore, to continue development of the displacement method of<br>
polyetherimide preparation and optimize the same.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based on a series of studies that identified several variables in<br>
the displacement process and led to the discovery of optimal conditions therefor.<br>
In one embodiment the invention is a method for preparing an aromatic polyether<br>
polymer which comprises contacting, in a solvent of low polarity, substantially<br>
equimolar amounts of at least one alkali metal salt of a dihydroxy-substituted<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon and at least one bis((N-(chlorophthalimido))-aromatic<br>
compound, in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst which is substantially stable at<br>
the temperatures employed; said method further comprising at least one of the<br>
following embodiments:<br>
(A) employing substantially dry solvent, alkali metal salt and bis(N-<br>
(chlorophthalimido))aromatic compound such that the reaction mixture comprising<br>
the same contains at most about 20 ppm by weight of water;<br>
(B) starting the reaction by addition of phase transfei catalyst wherein the polymer<br>
solids level in said solvent is at a value of at least about 15% and then concentratirm<br>
the -2- mixture during reaction until the said value is in the range of between about 25%<br>
polymer solids level and about 60% polymer solids level;<br>
(C) maintaining the combined level of said alkali metal salt and bis(N-<br>
(chlorophthalimido))aromatic compound in said solvent at a value in the range of<br>
between aboul 25% polymer solids level and about 60% polymer solids level;<br>
(D) beginning said contact using a molar excess of said bis(N-<br>
(chlorophthalimido))aromatic compound up to about 5% and subsequently adding<br>
alkali metal salt at least once to afford a polyether polymer of a desired molecular<br>
weight;<br>
(E) employing alkali metal salt having less than about 25% of particles with a<br>
diameter of greater than about 200 nm, and<br>
(F) employing at least one of<br>
(1) an alkali metal salt which is stoichiometrically pure or contains at most about 0.3<br>
mole % of free dihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon or of free sodium<br>
hydroxide, and<br>
(2) a bis(N-(chlorophthalimido))aromatic compound which is stoichiometrically pure<br>
or contains excess anhydride groups in a proportion up to 0.5 mole %, contains<br>
phlhalides in a proportion no greater than about 1000 ppm, and contains<br>
chlorobenzoic acids in a proportion no greater than about 0.15 mole %.<br>
Various other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
more apparent with reference to the following description and appended claims.<br>

There arc various embodiments of the present invention that can be used individually<br>
or in any combination. For each embodiment, the relevant parameters will be defined<br>
immediately hereinafter. Then the broad parameters, applicable generically except as<br>
dictated by one of the embodiments, will be delineated.<br>
In embodiment A, the reagents (alkali metal salt, bischlorophthalimidc and solvent)<br>
employed are substantially dry; i.e., the reaction mixture comprising the same<br>
contains at most about 20 ppm by weight of water. In some particular embodiments<br>
the amount of water in the reaction mixture is less than about 20 ppm, in other<br>
embodiments less than about 15 ppm, and in still other embodiments less than about<br>
10 ppm. The proportion of water may be determined by any convenient means and is<br>
typically determined by Karl Fischer titration. In some embodiments the amount of<br>
water in the reaction mixture is determined indirectly by measuring water content of<br>
an over-head distillate or condensate.<br>
In a particular subset of this embodiment, the alkali metal salt, in combination with a<br>
portion of solvent, is dried, most often by distillation, in one embodiment to a water<br>
content of at most about 20 ppm, and in another embodiment to a water content of at<br>
most about ]0 ppm. Bischlorophthalimide, in combination with a portion of solvent<br>
and optionally with chain termination agent, is similarly dried in one embodiment to a<br>
water content of at most about 20 ppm, and in another embodiment to a water content<br>
of at most about 10 ppm. This form of drying is generally and typically applicable to<br>
embodiment A, although other effective forms may be employed. It is within the<br>
scope of the invention to pre-dry the solvent, e.g., by contact with molecular sieves.<br>
In another particular subset of this embodiment (embodiment Al), the two reagents,<br>
alkali metal salt and bischlorophthalimide, may then be combined and, optionally,<br>
further dried by distillation until the threshold value of about 20 ppm water or less is<br>
attained. Dry PTC is then added, whereupon reaction immediately begins at a<br>
temperature on the order of about 190°C. PTC may be added all at once or in portions<br>
over time. In one particular embodiment PTC is added continuously over a period of<br>
time to moderate the reaction exotherm. In the present context dry PTC means that in<br>
one embodiment the catalyst contains less than about 50 ppm water, in another<br>
embodiment the catalyst contains less than about 30 ppm water, and in still another<br>
embodiment the catalyst contains less than about 20 ppm water. A substantially<br>
greater reaction rate, as shown by the slope of the curve of molecular weight<br>
attainment after a given time, is noted when embodiment A is employed than when<br>
reagents containing a higher proportion of water are employed.<br>
In another particular subset of embodiment A (embodiment A2),<br>
bischlorophthalimide. ail or at least a portion of solvent and all or at least a portion of<br>
PTC, optionally predried separately, may be combined and. if necessary, further dried<br>
by distillation u n t i l the threshold value of about 20 ppm water or less is attained. Dry<br>
alkali metal salt is then added, whereupon reaction immediately begins, typically at<br>
solvent reflux temperature. Dry alkali metal salt may be added all at once or in<br>
portions over time. In the present context dry alkali metal salt means that in various<br>
embodiments the salt contains less than about 50 ppm water, or less than about 30<br>
ppm water, or less than about 25 ppm water, or preferably less than about 20 ppm<br>
water. In one particular embodiment dry alkali metal salt is added continuously over<br>
a period of time to moderate the reaction exotherm. The reaction may be performed<br>
at an i n i t i a l solids level of at least about 15%, or at a solids level in a range of between<br>
about 15% and about 35%, or at a solids level in a range of between about 25% and<br>
about 30%. In some embodiments the reaction is performed at an initial solids level<br>
and then the mixture is concentrated to a higher solids level during reaction or after all<br>
the salt has been added or both during reaction and after all the salt has been added.<br>
The final solids level following complete addition of salt and any optional<br>
concentration step may be at least about 15%, or in a range of between about 15% and<br>
about 35%, or in a range of between about 25% and about 30%.<br>
In another particular subset of embodiment A, a portion of solvent is removed from<br>
the reaction vessel by distillation during the course of reaction, and, optionally, dry<br>
solvent is added to make up for that solvent removed. In some embodiments the<br>
solvent is ortho-dichlorobenzene dried to a level of at most 20 ppm water before<br>
addition 10 the reaction mixture.<br>
Embodiment B relates to starting the reaction by addition of phase transfer catalyst to<br>
mixture comprising said alkali metal salt and bis(N-(chlorophthalimido))aromatic<br>
compound in solvent wherein the solids level of polymer is at an initial value of at<br>
least about 15%, and then concentrating the mixture during reaction. In another<br>
embodiment the solids level of polymer is at an initial value of at least about 25%<br>
before starting the reaction by addition of phase transfer catalyst. In various<br>
embodiments following addition of phase transfer catalyst the mixture is concentrated<br>
until the said value is in one embodiment in a range of between about 25% polymer<br>
solids level and about 60% polymer solids level; in another embodiment in a range of<br>
between about 25% polymer solids level and about 50% polymer solids level; in still<br>
another embodiment in a range of between about 25% polymer solids level and about<br>
40% polymer solids level; and in still another embodiment in a range of between<br>
about 30% polymer solids level and about 40% polymer solids level. Solids level<br>
(sometimes also referred to herein as "polymer solids level") is calculated as weight<br>
polymer that would be formed divided by the sum of weight polymer than would be<br>
formed and solvent. Concentration of the reaction mixture may be done by any<br>
convenient method including, but not limited to, distillation of solvent. PTC may be<br>
added all at once or in portions over time. In one particular embodiment PTC is<br>
added continuously over a period of time to moderate the reaction exotherm.<br>
Embodiment C relates to the combined level of alkali metal salt and<br>
bischlorophthalimide reagents in solvent. Said combined level is maintained at a<br>
value in one embodiment in a range of between about 25% polymer solids level and<br>
about 60% polymer solids level; in another embodiment in a range of between about<br>
25%) polymer solids level and about 50% polymer solids level; in another embodiment<br>
in a range of between about 25% polymer solids level and about 40% polymer solids<br>
level, and in still another embodiment in a range of between about 30% polymer<br>
solids level and about 40% polymer solids level. Previously, values of 10-15% solids<br>
level were most often employed.<br>
At least two unexpected advantages of these relatively high solids levels have been<br>
observed. In the first place, the proportion of cyclic oligomers relative to polymer is<br>
substantially reduced, particularly in mixtures of 3- and 4-chlorophthalimide isomers.<br>
Cyclic oligomer levels are in one embodiment less than about 5 wt. %, in another<br>
embodiment less than about 4 wt. %, in another embodiment less than about 3 wt. %,<br>
and in .still another embodiment less than about 2 wt. %, based on weight polymer.<br>
Cyclics proportions may be determined by gel permeation chromatography using a<br>
suitable column; for example, a Polymer Labs Mixed E column, which separates<br>
materials of low molecular weight. In the second place, the reaction rate and<br>
efficiency of the PTC is substantially improved.<br>
Whereas total cyclic oliyomers, using o-dichlorobenzene as solvent, in<br>
polyetherimides prepared from bisphenol A salts and mixtures of<br>
1 ,3-bis[N-(4-chlorophthalirniclo)]benzcne and 1.3-bis["N-(3-chlorophthalimido)]-<br>
benzene in proportions (weight and mole, interchangeably) from 3:1 to 0:1 reached<br>
values on the order of 5% by weight at 15% of solids level in o-dichlorobenzene, the<br>
values at solids levels of 25-30% ranged from about 1.1% to about 2.1% by weight<br>
(calculated as weight cyclics divided by the sum of weight polymer and weight<br>
cyclics). Likewise, product molecular weights attained at a PTC level in some<br>
embodiments of 0.6-1.3 mole percent (based on alkali metal salt) and in other<br>
embodiments of 1.0-1.3 mole percent (based on alkali metal salt) and a solids level of<br>
22% were greater, particularly in reaction times of 60 minutes or greater, than those<br>
attained at a PTC level of 1.8 mole percent and a solids level of 15%. In some<br>
embodiments wherein lower catalyst levels are used at higher solids level, it is<br>
believed that less catalyst degradation occurs which may also account at least in part<br>
for attainment of higher product molecular weight.<br>
Embodiment D is a refinement of a method for rough control of molecular weight of<br>
the polyetherimide product. Previously, a slow approach to the desired molecular<br>
weight was achieved by initially employing an excess of bischlorophthalimide, said<br>
excess typically being provided by introducing only on the order of 70% of the<br>
stoichiometric amount of alkali metal salt. After the reaction reached a plateau, the<br>
molecular weight of the polyetherimide was determined and additional alkali metal<br>
salt was introduced. After several repetitions of this procedure, the desired molecular<br>
weight was reached and the reaction was stopped.<br>
One effect of this gradual approach was the necessity to use a rather large amount of<br>
PTC. It was discovered that this was, at least in part, a result of the instability of the<br>
PTC in the presence of phenoxide-type anions at high temperatures. Another effect<br>
was an undesirably long total reaction time, since many iterations of alkali metal salt<br>
addition and molecular weight determination, sometimes requiring a total reaction<br>
time of 8-10 hours, were required before the desired molecular weight was attained.<br>
In embodiment D, therefore, the initial excess of bischlorophthalimide is only up to<br>
about 5% on a molar basis. In one particular embodiment the initial excess of<br>
bischlorophthalimide is in the range of between about 0.75% and about 3%, and in<br>
another particular embodiment in the range of between about 0.75% and about 1.25%<br>
on a molar basis. The weight average molecular weight of the initial polyetherimide<br>
obtained is then generally in the range of between about 25,000 and about 37,000.<br>
depending on the presence and amount, if any, of chain termination agent present. For<br>
the most part, only one or two further additions of alkali metal salt are necessary to<br>
reach the desired molecular weight. Moreover, the amount of PTC necessary to<br>
conduct the reaction is substantially decreased, typically to a level as low as 0.6 mole<br>
percent based on alkali metal salt. In some embodiments a first further addition of<br>
alkali metal salt is done when the polymer solids level of the reaction mixture is in<br>
one embodiment in a range of between about 25% polymer solids level and about<br>
60% polymer solids level; in another embodiment in a range of between about 25%<br>
polymer solids level and about 50% polymer solids level; in another embodiment in a<br>
range of between about 25% polymer solids level and about 40% polymer solids<br>
level, and in still another embodiment in a range of between about 30% polymer<br>
solids level and about 40% polymer solids level.<br>
Embodiment E is based on the discovery of unexpected advantages resulting from the<br>
use of alkali metal salt of small particle size. Said salt exists in the reaction mixture in<br>
the form of a slurry in solvent, and undergoes a pseudo-interfacial reaction, mediated<br>
by the PTC, with the bischlorophthalimide which is in solution (being sparingly<br>
soluble). Therefore, the surface area of the alkali metal salt is a factor in reaction rate.<br>
In some preparative embodiments the alkali metal salt has an average particle size<br>
below about 100 microns, as determined by laser diffraction using, for example, a<br>
l.ascntec Size Analyzer. However, individual particles may be, without further<br>
treatment, as large as 500-1,000 microns. It has been discovered that such particles of<br>
lart.se size can persist for many hours during the polymerization reaction, resisting<br>
dissolution and increasing the time necessary to reach a desired polymer molecular<br>
weight, among other detrimental factors.<br>
In embodiment E, the presence of particles of a diameter greater than about 200<br>
microns is avoided, causing a substantial increase in molecular weight over time. The<br>
percentage of particles with diameter greater than about 200 nm is in one embodiment<br>
iess Ihan about 30%. in another embodiment less than about 25%, and in still another<br>
embodiment less than about 20% of the total particles. In other embodiments the<br>
percentage of particles with diameter greater than about 500 nm is in one embodiment<br>
less than about 5%. in another embodiment less than about 2%, and in still another<br>
embodiment less than about 1% of the total particles. In a particular embodiment the<br>
percentage of particles with diameter greater than about 200 nm is less than about<br>
25%, and the percentage of particles with diameter greater than about 500 nm is less<br>
than about 1%, In one embodiment the desired particle size range may be achieved<br>
by using commercially available grinders or their art-recognized equivalents, either<br>
during or after preparation of the alkali metal salt, to reduce particle size in the salt as<br>
required.<br>
In another embodiment control of particle size may be achieved during preparation or<br>
dehydration of the alkali metal salt. In a particular embodiment the alkali metal salt<br>
of a dihydroxy-substiiuted aromatic hydrocarbon may be prepared by contacting in<br>
water at leas! one dihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon and at least one alkali<br>
metal base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide. In one embodiment the alkali metal<br>
hydroxide is sodium hydroxide. Contact is performed using amounts of dihydroxysubstituted<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon and alkali metal base which are in one embodiment<br>
stoichiometric, in another embodiment deviate from stoichiometry by no more than<br>
plus/minus 0.1 mole c/b, in another embodiment deviate from stoichiometry by no<br>
more than plus/minus 0.2 mole %, in another embodiment deviate from stoichiometry<br>
by no more than plus minus 0.3 mole %, and in still another embodiment deviate from<br>
stoichiometry by no more than plus/minus 0.4 mole %. Said contact may be<br>
performed in water at a temperature in one embodiment above about 60°C, in another<br>
embodiment above about 70°C, in another embodiment above about 80°C, and in still<br>
another embodiment ;.bov« about 90°C. In a particular embodiment said contact is<br>
performed at a temper,iiurt: in a range of between about 90°C and about 100°C. Said<br>
contact may be performed under an inert atmosphere, such as under nitrogen. Said<br>
contact may be performed at a solids level in one embodiment of greater than about<br>
15%, in another embodiment of greater than about 20%, and in still another<br>
embodiment of greater than about 25%, wherein solids level is weight reactants<br>
divided by the sum of weight reactants and \veight solvent. In one particular<br>
embodiment said con:act is performed at a solids level in a range of between about<br>
26% and about 31%. and in another particular embodiment at a solids level in a ranee<br>
of between about 27", and about 30%. The course of the reaction may be monitored<br>
by known methods. The alkali metal salt reaction product may be isolated by known<br>
methods. In a particular embodiment the salt reaction product may be isolated by<br>
spraying of the aqueous solution containing the product into an organic solvent with<br>
boiling point above that of water. In some embodiments said solution is sprayed at a<br>
solids level similar to the solids level at which the salt was prepared. In other<br>
embodiments said solution is diluted with additional solvent before spraying.<br>
Spraying of the aqueous solution (sometimes referred to as atomization of the aqueous<br>
solution) into an organic solvent prevents agglomeration of salt during removal of<br>
water. In some embodiments the organic solvent is toluene, xylene, orthodichlorobenzene,<br>
para-dichlorobenzene, dichlorotoluene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene,<br>
diphenyl sulfone, phenetole, anisole or veratrole, or mixtures thereof. In some<br>
embodiments said organic solvent forms an azeotrope with water. In one particular<br>
embodiment the organic solvent is ortho-dichlorobenzene. In another particular<br>
embodiment the organic solvent is toluene. In one embodiment the organic solvent is<br>
contained in a vessel (sometimes referred to hereinafter as a dryer) which in various<br>
embodiments comprises baffles beneath the surface of said solvent which are believed<br>
to help prevent fouling of the vessel with salt cake. In various embodiments said<br>
vessel contains means for agitation. In one particular embodiment said vessel<br>
comprises a stirred tank with at least one stirring shaft agitator. The degree of<br>
agitation is typically such as not to favor formation of salt cake which may be difficult<br>
to remove from the dryer. Said vessel containing organic solvent may be fitted with<br>
one or more spray nozzles for introduction of aqueous solution containing salt. Any<br>
dead space cavities in the dryer may be heated externally or flushed with dry solvent<br>
lo prevent any accumulation of water therein. In one embodiment the vessel sides and<br>
top are traced with heating element. The rate of introduction of salt-containing<br>
aqueous solution into the vessel containing organic solvent depends upon a number of<br>
lactors including, but not limited to, vessel size, and may be determined without<br>
undue experimentation by those skilled in the art. In some embodiments, if the rate of<br>
introduction is too high, then the temperature of the organic solvent may fall and<br>
alkali metal salt may tend to cake. On the other hand, if the rate of introduction is too<br>
low, then process economics are less favorable. In particular embodiments saltcontaining<br>
aqueous solution is introduced into the vessel in such a manner that said<br>
solution does not impact the walls of the vessel or any stirrer shaft. The temperature<br>
of the organic solvent into which the aqueous solution is sprayed is in one<br>
embodiment in a ranee of between about 10G°C and about 220°C, in another<br>
embodiment in a range of between about 110°C and about 200°C, in another<br>
embodiment in a range of between about 130°C and about 180°C, and. in still another<br>
embodiment in a range of between about 140°C and about 160°C. In some<br>
embodiments heat is provided to the organic solvent by circulating said solvent<br>
through a heat exchanger. In one particular embodiment the heat exchanger is a tubeshell<br>
heat exchanger. In another particular embodiment the heat exchanger is a spiral<br>
heat exchanger. When said solvent contains alkali metal salt, the rate of flow of the<br>
solvent-salt mixture through the heat exchanger is such that turbulent flow is achieved<br>
to prevent fouling of the exchanger by solid salt, and may be determined by those<br>
skilled in the art without undue experimentation. In one embodiment the vessel<br>
holding organic solvent into which the aqueous solution is introduced may be under<br>
positive pressure so that the temperature of organic solvent may be above its normal<br>
boiling point at atmospheric pressure. Said vessel may be at a pressure in one<br>
particular embodiment in a range of between about and about 30 kilopascals (kPa)<br>
and about 280 kPa, m another particular embodiment in a range of between about 65<br>
kPa and about 240 kPa. and in another particular embodiment in a range of between<br>
about 100 kPa and about 210 kPa. In another embodiment the vessel holding organic<br>
solvent into which the aqueous solution is introduced may be under reduced pressure.<br>
Any organic solvent exiting the vessel along with vaporized water may optionally be<br>
replaced by adding additional organic solvent. In one embodiment additional organic<br>
solvent is added simultaneously with water vaporization to keep the total volume of<br>
solvent substantially the same. As water and organic solvent are removed from the<br>
vessel some precipitated alkali metal salt may be entrained. In various embodiments<br>
the entrained salt is recovered using any known means. In a particular embodiment<br>
entrained salt may be knocked out of water-solvent mixture by a spray of organic<br>
solvent introduced into a vent through which the water-solvent mixture with entrained<br>
salt passes. Said salt in organic solvent may then be passed back to the dryer. The<br>
salt reaction product may be isolated at a solids level in organic solvent of in one<br>
embodiment between about 5% and about 30%, and in another embodiment between<br>
about 10% and about 20%. Before or during transfer to a polymerization vessel the<br>
salt reaction product in organic solvent may be subjected to at least one drying step<br>
which may include, bu: is not limited to, combination with additional organic solvent<br>
and distillation, optionally at reduced pressure, or distillation of organic solvent from<br>
the mixture with addition of dry organic solvent at approximately the same rate as to<br>
keep the solvent amount in the dryer roughly constant. Dry organic solvent in the<br>
context of the present process means solvent with less than 100 ppm water. In other<br>
embodiments the salt in organic solvent may be transferred from the dryer to at least<br>
one other vessel for drying. The amount of water in the salt-containing organic<br>
solvent may be determined using known methods. In some embodiments the amount<br>
of water in the salt-containing organic solvent may be determined indirectly by<br>
measuring water content of an over-head distillate. The amount of water in the saltcontaining<br>
organic solvent before use in the polymerization reaction is in one<br>
embodiment less than about 40 ppm, in another embodiment less than about 30 ppm.<br>
and in still another embodiment less than about 20 ppm. Before or during transfer to<br>
a polymerization vessel the salt reaction product in organic solvent may be subjected<br>
to at least one particle size reduction step using equipment which may include, but is<br>
not limited to, one or more centrifugal pumps, grinders, drop-down blenders, particle<br>
size reduction homouenizer or delumpers. Embodiments of the process for making<br>
alkali metal salt described herein may be performed in batch, continuous or semicontinuous<br>
mode, and are capable of making alkali metal salts of not only dihydroxysubstituted<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons but also monohydroxy-substitutcd aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons, trihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons and tetrahydroxysubstituted<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
In embodiment F, careful control of the purity of one or both reagents is exercised,<br>
thus maximizing reaction rate and improving efficiency in attaining the desired<br>
molecular weight. Regarding the alkali metal salt (embodiment F-1), it has been found<br>
that the presence of free dihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon decreases the<br>
molecular weight of the polyetherimide product. The amount of free dihydroxysubstituted<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon is in one embodiment at most about 0.3 mole %. in<br>
another embodiment at most about 0.2 mole %, and in yet another embodiment at<br>
most about 0.15 mole % of the alkali metal salt. Also, the presence of free alkali metal<br>
hydroxide may cause a substantial decrease in molecular weight over time. The<br>
amount of free alkali metal hydroxide is in one embodiment at most about 0.3 mole<br>
%, in another embodiment at most about 0.2 mole %, and in yet another embodiment<br>
at most about 0.15 mole % of the alkali metal salt. Therefore, this embodiment<br>
includes the employment of alkali metal salt in which said materials are present in<br>
lesser proportions, and in a particular embodiment the employment of<br>
stoichiornetrically pure salt; that is, salt that is typically prepared from a<br>
sioichiometrically equivalent amount of dihydroxy-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
and alkali metal hydroxide.<br>
Regarding the bischlorophthalimide prepared by reaction of a diamine with two<br>
equivalents of an anhydride (embodiment F-2), a reagent containing residual amine<br>
often results in molecular weight below the desired value, as does the presence of<br>
such common impurities as phthalide, chlorophthalides and chlorobenzoic acids.<br>
Thus, bischlorophthalimide which is stoichiometrically pure (i.e., is within 0.02 mole<br>
% of stoichiometric) or has up to 0.5 mole % of residual anhydride groups requires a<br>
minimum of time to afford product of a specific desired molecular weight. The same<br>
is true of bischlorophthalimide containing in one embodiment at most about 1000<br>
ppm of phthalides and in another embodiment at most about 500 ppm phthalides,<br>
including chlorophthalides, and at most about 0.15 mole % of chlorobenzoic acids.<br>
Regulation of the amine to anhydride stoichiometry of the reactants producing the<br>
bischlorophthalimide (e.g.. m-phenylenediamine and 4-chlorophthalic anhydride) may<br>
be accomplished by known methods. Bischlorophthalimide purity will depend to<br>
some extent on method of preparation. When necessary, phthalides may be removed<br>
from the bischlorophthalimide by extraction of an aqueous solution of the<br>
corresponding chlorophthalic acid with an organic solvent including, but not limited<br>
to. toluene or xylene. while chlorobenzoic acids may be removed by extraction of an<br>
organic solvent solution of the chlorophthalic anhydride with aqueous bicarbonate.<br>
typically sodium bicarbonate.<br>
Other than as prescribed hereinabove for specific embodiments, the alkali metal salt<br>
and chlorophthalimide are typically employed over the cumulative course of the<br>
reaction in substantially equimolar amounts. For maximum molecular weight, the<br>
amounts should be as close as possible to exactly equimolar, but molecular weight<br>
control may he achieved by employing one reagent or the other in slight excess. It is<br>
also w i t h i n the scope of (he invention to employ chain termination agents, as noted<br>
hereinabove.<br>
.Reaction temperatures in embodiments of the invention are most often in the range of<br>
between about 125°C and about 250°C in some embodiments, and in the range of<br>
between about 180°C and about 225'C in other embodiments. The proportion of<br>
phase transfer catalyst employed is generally about 0.5-10 mole percent based on<br>
alkali metal salt, with lesser amounts within this range generally being necessary .<br>
Following the desired level of completion of the reaction, the aromatic polyether<br>
polymer may be isolated by conventional methods. This may include, but is not<br>
limited to, steps of washing and precipitation by combination of the polymer solution<br>
with a non-solvent for the polymer.<br>
Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can. using the<br>
description herein, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent. The following<br>
examples are included to provide additional guidance to those skilled in the art in<br>
practicing the claimed invention. 'Hie examples provided are merely representative of<br>
the work that contributes to the teaching of the present application. Accordingly,<br>
these examples are not intended to limit the invention, as defined in the appended<br>
claims, in any manner. Unless otherwise specified, all parts and percentages are by<br>
weight. Reagent grade o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB, employed as solvent) was dried<br>
over 4 angstrom molecular sieves; hexaethylguanidinium chloride (HEGC1) was used<br>
as a 20% solution in ODCB; l,3-bis[N-(4-chlorophthalirnido)]benzene (Formula<br>
XV11: sometimes referred to as "C1PAM1") (or the 3-chloro isomer when specified)<br>
was ground in a Waring blender and dried in vacuum at 160°C for 24 hours:<br>
bisphcnol A disodium salt (BPA-Na) was filtered from a toluene slurry, dried in<br>
vacuum at 160L'C for 24 hours, ground in a Waring blender and dried for an additional<br>
24 hours: and all leagents were stored and handled in a nitrogen-filled dry box.<br>
Weight average molecular weights (Mw) and levels of cyclic oligomers were<br>
determined by gel permeation chromatography relative to polystyrene standards. PTC<br>
levels arc based on BPA-Na, and CTA (when employed) concentrations are based on<br>
C1PAMI.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
EXAMPLE 1 (Embodiment A)<br>
A slurry of C1PAM1 in ODCB was prepared by the reaction of m-phenylenediamine<br>
with 4-chlorophthalic anhydride in a 250 ml three-necked flask and stored until use<br>
under nitrogen, along with a measured amount of 1-[N-(4-chlorophtharirnido)]-3-(Nphthalimido)<br>
benzene as CTA. The flask was fitted with a nitrogen sparge tube atop a<br>
reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer and a distillation apparatus. A further portion of<br>
ODCB was added, and distillation was performed under nitrogen to dry the slurry to a<br>
water content of at most about 10 ppm. BPA-Na slurry in ODCB was dried similarly<br>
in a separate flask.<br>
When both slurries were dry, the BPA-Na slurry was added to the C1PAMI slurry by<br>
pouring quickly under nitrogen and rinsing with dry ODCB, in a molar ratio of aryl<br>
chloride groups to ONa groups of 1.01:1 and a polymer solids level of 25%. A final<br>
distillation was performed to reduce the water content to at most 10 ppm.<br>
HEGC1, 0.8 mole % (based on BPA-Na), was added to the dried mixture at 190°C, a<br>
timer was started and samples were removed periodically, quenched with acetic acid<br>
and analyzed for molecular weight. The initial reaction rate was calculated as the<br>
slope of the molecular weight-time curve from 0 to 30 minutes.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 (Embodiment A)<br>
Predried and isolated reagents C1PAMI, CTA, BPA-Na and dry ODCB (5 ppm water<br>
content) were added together to a 250 ml three-necked flask and heated to reflux.<br>
HEGC1, 0.8 mole % (based on BPA-Na), was added to the mixture at 190°C, a timer<br>
was started and samples were removed periodically, quenched with acetic acid and<br>
analyzed for molecular weight. The initial reaction rate (in units of kilograms/mole<br>
minute) was calculated as the slope of the molecular weight-time curve from 0 to 30<br>
minutes.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 (Embodiment A)<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was followed except that the reaction was spiked at<br>
180°C with wet ODCB to a total water content of 45 ppm before catalyst addition.<br>
The amount of additional ODCB added was such that the % solids level remained at<br>
about 25%.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 (Embodiment A)<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was followed except that the reaction was cooled to<br>
room temperature before spiking with wet ODCB to a total water content of 45 ppm<br>
before catalyst addition. The amount of additional ODCB added was such that the %<br>
solids level remained at about 25%.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 (Embodiment A)<br>
The procedure of Example 2 was followed except that the ODCB had an initial water<br>
content of 57 ppm and was azeotropically dried'to a total water content of 5 ppm<br>
before catalyst addition.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 (Embodiment A)<br>
The procedure of Example 2 was followed except that the ODCB had an initial water<br>
content of 57 ppm and was azeotropically dried to a total water content of 5 ppm after<br>
catalyst addition.<br>
The results of Examples 1-6 are listed in Table 1, in comparison with a control<br>
reaction which employed the procedure of Example 2, except that the ODCB had an<br>
initial water content of 57 ppm and was not subsequently dried.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
From a comparison of Example 1 with Example 2, the advantage of the particular<br>
subset of embodiment A will be apparent. Example 1 when compared with<br>
Comparison of Example 3 with Example 4 shows the unexpected advantage for<br>
reaction rate and polymer molecular weight of having the reactants spend as little time<br>
as possible in the presence of water. Examples 5 and 6, when compared with the<br>
Control, show the advantage of drying, particularly before addition of the catalyst.<br>
Comparison of Example 5 with Example 6 shows the unexpected advantage for<br>
reaction rate and polymer molecular weight of having the reactants and catalyst spend<br>
as little time as possible in the presence of water.<br>
EXAMPLES 7-10 (Embodiment C)<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was repeated at a total water content of less than 10 ppm.<br>
using various proportions of PTC and 4-chloro-N-phenylphthalimide as CTA, varying<br>
the solids level and employing, in certain examples, a mixture of 3- and 4-isomers of<br>
C1PAMI. Proportions of cyclic oligomers having degrees of polymerization up to 4<br>
were determined. Comparison was made with two controls:<br>
Control A, at 15% polymer solids level;<br>
Control B, a commercially available polyetherimide prepared by the reaction of mphenylenediamine<br>
with 2,2-bis[4-(dicarboxyphenoxy)phenyl]propane dianhydride<br>
(96:4 ratio of 3,4-dicarboxy to 2,3-dicarboxy isomer).<br>
EXAMPLE 11 (Embodiment C)<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, replacing the C1PAM1 with an analogous<br>
compound prepared by the reaction of 4- and 3-chlorophthalic anhydrides (70:30<br>
weight ratio) with 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether.<br>
The results of Examples 7-11 are listed in Table U. Mole percentages of PTC are<br>
based on BPA-Na; mole percentages of CTA on C1PAM1.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results in Table 11 show the unexpected advantage at operating at a relatively high<br>
solids level, which affords a product approaching, in low cyclics content, the<br>
commercially available one prepared from a dianhydride and diamine. They further<br>
show the particular advantage of a solids level of at least 30%. The relatively high<br>
cyclics level in Example 5 is believed to be a steric effect of employing 100% 3-<br>
isomer, which is more readily cyclized than the 4-isomer.<br>
EXAMPLES 12-15 (Embodiment C)<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was employed with the following solids and PTC levels:<br>
Example 12: 15%, 1.8 mole percent;<br>
Example 13: 22%, 1.8 mole percent;<br>
Example 14: 22%, 1.3 mole percent;<br>
Example 15: 22%, 1.0 mole percent.<br>
The results are shown graphically in FIGURE 1. It is apparent that molecular weight<br>
attained over time is substantially higher at 22% than at 15% solids level, at least after<br>
reaction times of about 45 minutes, even with the use of lower PTC concentrations.<br>
EXAMPLE 16 (Embodiment D)<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was repeated at a solids level of 30%, a PTC proportion<br>
of 0.8 mole percent PTC and 3.0-4.7 mole % (based on CIPAMI) of 4-chloro-Nphenylphthalimide<br>
as CTA, except that in an initial stage of the reaction, a molar ratio<br>
of CIPAMI to BPA-Na of 1.03:1 was employed. When aMw in the range of between<br>
about 25,000 and about 37,000 (depending on CTA level) had been reached, further<br>
BPA-Na was added in an amount determined from number average molecular weight<br>
and the reaction was continued. As necessary, a further addition of BPA-Na was<br>
made, to a total molar ratio of CIPAMI to BPA-Na of 1.01:1. It was found that said<br>
constant molar ratio was possible, in contrast to previous experiments employing a<br>
greater excess of CIPAMI in the initial stage when the molar ratio had to be varied<br>
from 0.99:1 to 1.05:1. In addition, the level of unreactive N-phenylphthalimide end<br>
groups was almost twice that determined in previous experiments, and total reaction<br>
time was as low as 1.5 hours on a laboratory scale or 3 hours on a large scale, as<br>
contrasted with 8-10 hours in previous work.<br>
EXAMPLES 17-18 (Embodiment E)<br>
The procedure of Example ] was repeated at a water content of less than 10 ppm, a<br>
solids level of 25%, a CTA level of 3.6 mole percent and a PTC level of 0.7 mole<br>
percent. The BPA-Na employed was ground by immersing a laboratory-scale tissue<br>
homogcnizer in the slurry thereof for 5 minutes (Example 17) or 10 minutes (Example<br>
18), reducing the maximum particle diameter in each example to about 200 microns.<br>
The results are shown graphically in FIGURE 2, in comparison with Control H<br>
employing unground BPA-Na. The unexpected advantage of using small particle size<br>
BPA-Na is evident.<br>
EXAMPLES 19-22 (Embodiment F-l)<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was repeated with a PTC level of 0.8 mole percent, a<br>
solids level of 25%, a CTA level of 3.6 mole percent and a water content of at most<br>
10 ppm, using BPA-Na which had been prepared in toluene, filtered and dried in<br>
vacuum. Four different grades of BPA-Na were employed: stoichiometrically pure to<br>
within 0.05% (Example 19), varying from stoichiometric purity by at most 0.15%<br>
(Example 20), BPA-nch by 0.3% (Example 21) and sodium hydroxide-rich by 0.3%<br>
(Example 22).<br>
The results are shown graphically in FIGURE 3, which shows a significant decrease<br>
in molecular weight over time with the use of BPA-Na having any proportion of<br>
impurities. The most significant decreases, at least over times up to about 75 minutes,<br>
occur w i th the use of sal: containing greater than 0.15% impurities.<br>
EXAMPLE 23 (Embodiment F-2)<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was repeated with a PTC level of 0.8 mole percent, a<br>
solids level of 25%, a CTA level of 3.7 mole percent and a water content of at most<br>
10 ppm, using C1PAMI of various purities: within 0.02% of stoichiometric, 6.5% rich<br>
in ainine, and 0.5% rich in anhydride. The results are shown graphically in FIGURE<br>
4, and show the advantage of employing stoichiometrically pure or anhydride-rich<br>
C1PAM1.<br>
EXAMPLE 24 (Embodiment F-2)<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was repeated with a PTC level of 0.8 mole percent, a<br>
solids level of 25%. a CTA level of 3.7 mole percent and a water content of at most<br>
10 ppm, using stoiehiometrically pure C1PAM1 and three samples which had been<br>
spiked with 250, 500 and 3,700 ppm of phthalide. The results are shown graphically<br>
in FIGURE 5. which shows that phthalide levels up to 500 ppm produce essentially<br>
identical results but higher levels cause a substantial decrease in molecular weight<br>
over time.<br>
EXAMPLE 25 (Embodiment F-2)<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was repeated with a PTC level of 0.8 mole percent, a<br>
solids level of 25%, a CTA level of 3.5 mole percent and a water content of at most<br>
10 ppm, using sloichiometrically pure C1PAMI and three samples which had been<br>
spiked with 0.2 mole %, 0.5 mole % and 1.0 mole % of chlorobenzoic acids. The<br>
results are shown graphically in FIGURE 6. which shows that chlorobenzoic acid<br>
levels as low as 0.2 mole % cause a substantial decrease in molecular weight over<br>
time.<br>
