				<td>ELECTRODEIONIZATION DEVICE AND METHODS OF USE<br>
Field of the Invention <br>
The present invention relates to water purification and, more particularly, to water purification using an electrodeionization device, and to sanitization and/or sealing of the electrodeionization device.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Electrodeionization is a process for removing ionic or ionizable species from liquids using an electrically active medium and an electric field to influence ion transport. The electrically active medium may function to alternately collect and discharge ionizable species that facilitate the transport of ions by ionic or anionic substitution mechanisms. Electrodeionization devices can include media having permanent or temporary charge, and can be operated to cause electrochemical reactions designed to achieve or enhance performance. Electrodeionization devices typically include an electrically active membrane such as a semipermeable or an ion selective membrane.<br>
An electrodeionization device typically includes alternating electrically active semipermeable anion and cation exchange membranes. Spaces between the membranes can be configured to create liquid flow compartments with inlets and outlets. A transversely applied electric field may be imposed by an external power source through electrodes at the boundaries of the membranes and compartments. Upon imposition of the electric field, ions in the liquid to be purified are attracted to their respective counter-electrodes. The adjoining compartments, bounded by ion selective membranes, become ionically enriched as a result of ion transport. Electrodeionization devices have been described by, for example, Giuffrida et al. in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,632,745, 4,925,541, and 5,211,823; by Ganzi in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,259,936, and 5,316,637; by Oren et al. in U.S. Patent No. 5,154,809; and by Towe et al. in U.S. Patent No. 6,235,166.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The present invention is directed to a water purification system for providing purified water for industrial, commercial, and/or residential applications. The purification system includes an electrodeionization device which can comprise one or a plurality of stages. The electrodeionization device can be constructed with a resilient sealing member forming a water-tight seal between rigid thermally and dimensionally stable compartment spacers. The construction of the electrodeionization device may allow cycling of hot water and/or other liquids, which, in some cases, can improve efficiency and performance of the electrodeionization device. Moreover, the cycling of hot water and/or other liquids may be used to sanitize the electrodeionization device to at least a pharmaceutically acceptable condition and, preferably, in certain instances, to meet at least minimum requirements according to U.S. Pharmacopoeia guidelines by inactivating any microorganisms present within the electrodeionization device. In the device, an anode may be positioned at an opposite end of a stack of depleting and concentrating compartments from within which a cathode is positioned. Each anode and cathode may be provided with an electrode spacer and an ion selective membrane, wherein electrolyte can pass through the electrode spacer.<br>
The liquid, typically comprising water, to be purified can be passed in parallel through each depleting compartment, and a second liquid can be passed through each concentrating compartment in each stage, to effect removal of ions and/or ionic species from the first liquid in depleting compartment to the second liquid in the concentrating compartment. Examples of ions that may be dissolved in the water to be purified include sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, etc. Electrolytes may be passed through the spacer adjacent each electrode in the electrodeionization device. Other possible flow arrangements are possible. For example, counter-curve flow and reverse flow are shown such as those disclosed by, for example, Giuffrida et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,632,745.<br>
The liquid to be purified can contain other species, for example dissolved or suspended therein, such as ions and ionic species, organics, etc. The liquid to be purified may contain, for example, at least about 20 wt%, at least about 15 wt%, at least about 10 wr%, at least about 5 wt%, at least about 3 wt%, at least about 1 wt%, at least about 0.5 wt%, or at least about 0.1 wt% of one or more species contained therein. In other cases, the water or other liquid to be purified may contain a smaller percentage of species therein. In one embodiment, the liquid to be purified consists essentially of water (i.e., the water may include other ions, salts, suspension matter, etc., so long as those of ordinary skill in the art would consider the liquid to be essentially water, for example, the liquid may be tap water, filtered water, etc).<br>
FIG. 1 shows an exploded view of an electrodeionization device according to one embodiment of the present invention. The electrodeionization device 10 includes a depleting compartment 12 and a concentrating compartment 14. Ion-selective membranes may form the border between the depleting compartment 12 and concentrating compartment 14. Electrodeionization device 10 typically includes a plurality of depleting compartments 12 and concentrating compartments 14, which can be arranged as a stack as shown in FIG. 1. Depleting compartment 12 is typically defined by a depleting compartment spacer 18 and concentrating compartment 14 is typically defined by a concentrating compartment spacer 20. An assembled stack may be bound by end blocks 19 at each end and can be assembled using tie rods 21 secured with nuts 23. In certain embodiments, the compartments include cation-selective membranes and anion-selective membranes, which are typically peripherally sealed to the periphery of both sides of the spacers. The cation-selective membranes and/or anion-selective membranes may be formed from ion exchange powder, a powder binder (e.g., polyethylene) and/or a lubricant (e.g., glycerin). In some embodiments, the cation- and/or anion-selective membranes are heterogeneous polyolefin-based membranes, which are typically extruded by a thermoplastic process using heat and pressure to create a composite sheet.<br>
Depleting compartment 12 and concentrating compartment 14 may be filled with ion exchange resin (not shown). In some embodiments, the depleting and concentrating compartments may be filled with cation exchange and/or anion exchange resin. The cation exchange and/or anion exchange resin may be arranged in a variety of configurations within each of the depleting and concentrating compartments. For example, the cation exchange<br>
and/or anion exchange resin can be arranged in layers so that a number of layers in a variety of arrangements can be constructed. Other embodiments or configurations within the scope of the invention include, for example, the use of mixed bed ion exchange resin in any of the depleting, concentrating, and/or electrode compartments; the use of inert resin between layered beds of anion and/or cation exchange resin; or the use of various types of anionic and/or cationic resin including, but not limited to, those described by DiMascio et al., in U.S. Patent No. 5,858,191.<br>
In operation, a liquid to be purified, typically having dissolved cationic and anionic components, is introduced into the depleting compartment 12. An electric field can be applied across one or more compartments of the electrodeionization device, which may promote migration of ionic species towards their respective attracting electrodes. Under the influence of the electric field, cationic and anionic components may leave the depleting compartments and migrate into the concentrating compartments. Ion selective membranes 16 may block or at least inhibit migration of the cationic and anionic species to the next compartment. The electrodeionization device thus may be used to produce a product that consists essentially of water, and in some cases, is essentially water, i.e., the water may have a trace or undetectable amount of ions, etc., but the water would be considered by those of ordinary skill in the art to be "pure."<br>
In some embodiments, the applied electric field on electrodeionization device 10 creates a polarization phenomenon, which may lead to the dissociation of water into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions. The hydrogen and hydroxyl ions may regenerate the ion exchange resins so that removal of dissolved ionic components from the ion exchange resins can occur continuously and without a step for regenerating ion exchange resins exhausted as a result of ionic species migration. The electric field applied to electrodeionization device 10 is typically direct current. However, any applied current that creates a bias or potential difference between one electrode and another can be used to promote migration of the ionic species within the electrodeionization device.<br>
The ion exchange resin typically utilized in the depleting and/or concentrating compartments can have a variety of functional groups on their surface regions including, but not limited to, tertiary alkyl amino groups and dimethyl ethanolamine. These can also be used in combination with ion exchange resin materials having other functional groups on their surface regions, such as ammonium groups. Other modifications and equivalents useful<br>
in ion exchange resin material are within the scope of those persons of ordinary skill in the art, and/or can be ascertained using no more than routine experimentation. Other examples of ion exchange resin include, but are not limited to, DOWEX® MONOSPHERE™ 550A anion resin, MONOSPHERE™ 650C cation resin, MARATHON™ A anion resin, and MARATHON™ C cation resin, all available from the Dow Chemical Company (Midland, Michigan). Non-limiting representative suitable ion selective membranes include homogenous-type web supported styrene-divinyl benzene-based with sulphonic acid or quaternary ammonium functional groups, heterogeneous type web supported using styrene-divinyl benzene-based resins in a polyvinylidene fluoride binder, homogenous type unsupported-sulfonated styrene and quaternized vinyl benzyl amine grafts of polyethylene sheet.<br>
To prevent or at least inhibit leakage of ions and/or liquid from the depleting compartment to the concentrating compartment and vice versa, the ion selective membrane sandwiched between depleting compartment and concentrating compartment spacers may form a substantially water-tight seal. Typically, the spacers and the ion selective membranes are compressed together and fixed in position, for example, with nuts 23 and tie bars 21. In one embodiment of the present invention, as shown in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 2, . depleting compartment 12, positioned between concentrating compartments 14, can be defined, at least in part, by the cavity formed between depleting compartment spacer 18 and ion-selective membranes 16. Similarly, concentrating compartment 14 is a cavity that may be defined, at least in part, between concentrating compartment spacer 20 and by selective membranes 16. Also shown in the embodiment of FIG. 2, two water-tight seals 22 and 24 can be used to prevent leakage from and between depleting compartment 12 and concentrating compartment 14. Seals 22 and 24, positioned between the depleting compartment and concentrating compartment spacers, may comprise a resilient sealing member disposed within a groove formed on a surface of the depleting compartment spacer. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a compartment spacer having a groove formed on one side of the spacer. For example, the groove may be disposed around a perimeter of depleting compartment 12 or concentrating compartment 14, Resilient sealing member 26 may be dimensionally constructed and arranged to at least partially fit (and may be compressed in some cases) within the groove formed on the surface of the spacer when the electrodeionization device is assembled.<br>
As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 2, grooves are formed on a surface of depleting compartment spacer 18. However, other embodiments are also considered to be within the scope of the present invention. For example, electrodeionization device 10 may include a single seal comprising a groove defined on the surface of the concentrating compartment spacer 20, with a resilient sealing member disposed and compressed therein, thereby forming a water-tight seal between depleting compartment spacer 18 and concentrating compartment spacer 20. The present invention also contemplates, in other embodiments, the use of a plurality of seals, such as primary seal 22 with secondary seal 24.<br>
With reference to FIG. 1, in another embodiment, the invention provides port seals 28 that may form a water-tight seal, around fluid ports, and/or between adjacent spacers. Port seals 28 typically comprise a resilient sealing member, which may be similar to resilient sealing member 26. The port seal, in some cases, may be compressed within a groove surrounding a fluid connection port. Thus, as assembled, the resilient sealing member may prevent or at least inhibit leaks to and from the fluid port.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides the use of thermally stable materials that are suitable for thermal cycling and other thermal changes (i.e., changes in temperature). As defined herein, a "thermally suitable material" is one that can maintain its dimensional stability, having no significant change in dimension or shape or mechanical properties under the influence of temperature and/or pressure. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention contemplates the use of rigid polymeric or non-metallic materials in the construction and assembly of certain electrodeionization devices. Examples of polymeric materials include, but are not limited to, polysulfone, polyphenylsulfone, polyphenylene oxide, polyphenylene ether, chlorinated poly(vinyl chloride), polyphenylene sulfide, polyetherimide, polyetherketone, polyamide-imide and polybenzimidazole, and mixtures thereof. The resilient sealing member may be formed from any material such as an elastomer including, for example, silicon, polyisobutylene, ethylene-propylene, chlorosulfonated polyethylene, polyurethane, or any chlorinated elastomer that is chemically inert and thermally stable to 80°C.<br>
The electrodeionization device, in one set of embodiments, may be disinfected or sanitized by introducing a disinfectant solution or other liquid able to inactivate some or all of the microorganisms present within the electrodeionization device. As used herein, an "inactivated microorganism" is one that is destroyed or killed, or otherwise incapable of<br>
propagating into or forming other organisms. While there is no United States Pharmacopoeia specification for bacterial or microorganisms, the recommended action level limit is 100 colony forming units per milliliter for purified water.<br>
Thus, in some embodiments, the present invention provides disinfection of an electrodeionization device by the use of a liquid, for example, hot water or another heated liquid, to inactivate some or all of the microorganisms. The liquid may be heated within the device, and/or externally of the device, using any suitable technique known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, in one embodiment, the liquid is heated externally of the electrodeionization device before being introduced to the device; in another embodiment, the liquid is heated within the electrodeionization device; in another embodiment, the liquid is heated externally of the device, then further heated within the electrodeionization device (for example, to maintain and/or raise the temperature of the liquid within the electrodeionization device, for instance to a pharmaceutically acceptable sanitization temperature).<br>
According to one embodiment, sanitization may be performed by passing and/or circulating a liquid such as hot water through the electrodeionization device, for example, passing and/or circulating a liquid at at least the pharmaceutically acceptable sanitization temperature through the electrodeionization device, for instance, for a predetermined period of time, and/or for at least time necessary to reduce the number of active microorganisms within the electrodeionization device to a pharmaceutically acceptable level. In some cases, the liquid may be passed through a portion of the electrodeionization device, for example, through one or more concentrating compartments and/or one or more depleting compartments.<br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable sanitization temperature," as used herein, is one where a substantial number of microorganisms exposed to such a temperature are inactivated and, in particular, to one wherein the number of microorganisms is inactivated to below an acceptable action limit or a pharmaceutically acceptable level, for example, to below 1000 colony forming units/ml, below 100 colony forming units/ml, or below 10 colony forming units/ml. In one embodiment, the present invention provides for the passing and/or circulation of hot water or other liquids having a temperature of at least about 65 °C or at least about 80 °C through an electrodeionization device. In another embodiment, the liquid used to disinfect the electrodeionization device may be heated at a rate of at least about 5 °C/min, at least about 10 °C/min, at least about 15 °C/min, or at least about 20 °C/min, etc.,<br>
and the liquid may be heated within and/or externally of the electrodeionization device. The liquid may be heated for any suitable length of time, for example, for a predetermined length of time (e.g., for at least 5 minutes, at least 10 minutes, at least 15 minutes, at least 20 minutes, at least 30 minutes, at least 45 minutes, at least 60 minutes, etc.), and/or for a time necessary to reduce the number of active microorganisms within the device to a pharmaceutically acceptable level.<br>
In some cases, the disinfectant liquid passed through the electrodeionization device comprises water, e.g. as described above. In one embodiment, the disinfectant liquid consists essentially of water (i.e., the liquid may include other ions, salts, suspension matter, etc., so long as those of ordinary skill in the art would consider the liquid to be essentially water, for example, the liquid may be tap water, filtered water, etc). In another embodiment, the disinfectant liquid consists of water, i.e., the water may have a trace or undetectable amount of ions, etc., but the water would be considered "pure" by those of ordinary skill in the art. In still other embodiments, additional materials such as disinfectants, salts, or the like may be added to the disinfectant liquid. For example, the disinfectant liquid may include phenolics, alcohols (e.g., isopropanol, isobutanol, ethanol, etc.), halogens (e.g., dissolved chlorine, bromine, etc.), heavy metals (e.g., silver nitrate, etc.), quaternary ammonium compounds, detergents, aldehydes (e.g., formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, etc.), gases (e.g., carbon dioxide, ethylene oxide, ozone, etc.), or the like.<br>
The function and advantage of these and other embodiments of the present invention can be further understood from the examples below. The following examples are intended to illustrate the benefits of the present invention but do not exemplify the full scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1 <br>
Two electrodeionization devices, depicted in the exploded view of FIG. 1 and in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 2, were constructed. One electrodeionization device had a stack of 10 depleting compartments and concentrating compartments secured and held together by tie rods and nuts. The other electrodeionization device had a stack of 24 depleting and concentrating compartments. Depleting compartment spacer 18 and the concentrating compartment spacers 20 were molded using a rigid polymer available as RADEL® R-5100 polyphenylsulfone from BP Amoco Chemicals (Alpharetta, Georgia). A primary seal and a<br>
secondary seal were formed on opposite surfaces of the depleting compartment spacer. The primary seal included a groove and a resilient sealing member, in particular, an O-ring surrounding the cavity forming the depleting compartment. Upon assembly, resilient sealing members were compressed within the groove to form water-tight seals. The resilient sealing member was formed from an elastomeric material, having a lower hardness than the material forming the depleting compartment and concentrating compartment spacers. In particular, the resilient sealing members 26 were formed from silicone elastomer and buna-N elastomer.<br>
Example 2<br>
An electrodeionization device having 10 depleting and concentrating compartment pairs was constructed as described above in Example 1 to evaluate its performance. The test system comprised a hot water source in a closed loop with the electrodeionization device. The electrodeionization device was cycled approximately three times per day with deionized water. The feed pressure into the electrodeionization device ranged from between 3-5 psig, with a dilute flow of 1 to 1.5 gallons per minute and a concentrate flow of 0.75 to 1.0 gallons per minute.<br>
The typical sanitization cycle (HWS) comprised a one hour ramp up from 27 °C to 80 °C, a one hour soak at 80 °C and a 20-30 minute cool down to 20 °C. The electrodeionization device was allowed to sit at 27 *C for about 10 minutes before starting the next sanitization cycle.<br>
After 7, 25, 52, 104 and 156 cycles, the electrodeionization device was checked for cross-leaks, and operated to evaluate changes in the rinse up curve. Rinse up shows how the quality of product increases as a function of time. After running for approximately 24 hours, the electrodeionization device was re-exposed to the sanitization cycles. The first three tests were performed with feed water temperature of below 10 'C, while the later three tests were performed at 15 °C and 20 *C.<br>
FIG. 3 shows the resistivity, the quality of water, as a function of time after 7, 26, 52, 102 and 156 cycles. Notably, FIG. 3 showed that the resistivity, or the quality of the product water, improved with increasing number of hot water cycles. This figure also showed that the electrodeionization device can be used at higher temperatures, without component damage. In particular, this figure showed that the resin (which had been rated up to 60 °C)<br>
was suitable for sanitization cycles to 80 °C, without a loss in electrodeionization device performance.<br>
Example 3 <br>
An electrodeionization device was constructed as described above in Example 1, and hot water, sanitized as described above in Example 2, was used to evaluate the effect of HWS on biological activity within the device. Initially, the electrodeionization device was placed on standby for about 6 days to increase the bacterial activity. Samples were taken before, during, and subsequent to sanitization at 80 °C, and measured for colony forming units ("CFU"). Table 1 shows that during the hot water procedure, the concentration of colony forming units decreased.<br>

Example 4 <br>
Two electrodeionization devices, a 10-cell and a 24-cell stack, were assembled as described above in Example 1. The electrodeionization devices were exposed to HWS at<br>
80 °C as described in Example 2. Tables 2 and 3, listed below, summarize the operating conditions and performance of the devices and showed that the product quality, as measured by resistivity, increased after exposure to hot water cycling.<br>
Table 2.<br>
Table 3.<br>

Example 5 <br>
In this example, a 10-cell pair LX electrodeionization module with UDEL™ spacers and 3-layer resin configuration was aggressively hot water sanitized (HWS) at 85 °C and 30 psig with rapid heating and cooling, for 156 cycles (the equivalent of 3 years of weekly sanitizations).<br>
The LX modules were able to be hot water sanitized at 80 °C. After 150 sanitization cycles at 80 °C, there was no obvious external damage to the module. Module performance actually improved with successive sanitization cycles. Inlet pressure on the module was maintained at less than 10 psig, and the ramp-up cycle extended over an hour (1.6 °C/min). Many of these operating limits were based on the operating parameters for hot water sanitizable RO (reverse osmosis) cartridges. It was also desired to shorten the sanitization cycle by heating the CDI modules up as rapidly as possible. This may also allow for simultaneous sanitization of downstream components (e.g., UV, filtration) and piping.<br>
UDEL™ polysulfone was used to make the spacers for the LX modules. All LX modules were initially constructed with a 4-layer resin configuration in the dilute compartments using DOW® MONOSPHERE™ 550A as the Type I anion resin. Subsequent testing showed that better silica removal and better performance on high CO2 feeds was possible with a 3-layer configuration using DOW® MARATHON™ A as the Type I anion resin.<br>
An LX pilot system constructed with CPVC piping was set up for automated hot water cycle testing. Automation included a THORNTON™ 200CR with internal relays, a timing relay and four solenoid valves on the feed, product, concentrate, and cooling water lines. The heated water was supplied by a 30-gallon stainless steel tank with two immersion heaters, one in-line heater and a GRUNDFOS™ CR-2 centrifugal pump, which were part of the adjacent continuous high temperature (CHT) RO system. An LX10 module with 3 layer resin configuration was constructed by using cast aluminum end plates, machined polypropylene end blocks, and UDEL™ dilute and concentrate spacers. The module was operated on RO water overnight prior to hot water sanitization to determine baseline performance. Operating conditions during rinseup were 5 gpm product flow and 0.5 gpm concentrate flow.<br>
Hot water sanitization included pumping 85 °C deionized ("DI") water into the module at a flow of 2.5 gpm on the product side and 0.3 gpm on the concentrate side. Outlet diaphragm valves on the product and concentrate lines were adjusted to attain an inlet pressure of 30 psig on both the dilute and concentrate. To maintain temperature, the hot product and concentrate streams were both returned to the feed tank. When the concentrate outlet temperature on the Thornton conductivity probe reached 85 °C, the 60 minute recirculation of 85 °C water was initiated through the module. At the end of 60 minutes the<br>
hot DI water supply solenoid valve closed and the cool RO water solenoid valve opened. At this time, both the product and concentrate solenoid lines opened to drain. When the concentrate outlet temperature reached 25 °C, the cool RO water solenoid valve closed, the hot DI water solenoid valve opened and both product and concentrate solenoid drain valves closed, initiating the next sanitization cycle.<br>
After 26 sanitization cycles, the module was checked for tie rod torque and cross leaks. The module was then operated in service mode overnight on a blend of house RO and DI water (approximately 6 µS/cm feed). This was repeated every 26 sanitization cycles, after heat sanitization cycles 26, 52, 78, 104,130, and 156. The number of cycles completed during each work day varied from 5 to 7, and the module was normally idle overnight (except for the periodic service mode mentioned above). The product water TOC (total organic carbon) was monitored on-line during several hot water sanitizations and rinseups. After 156 sanitization cycles, the module was checked for torque, for cross leaks, and allowed to rinse-up to quality for the better part of a week. The module was then autopsied.<br>
Heating and cooling of the module was performed as quickly as the system would allow. The module feed water temperature changed from 25 °C to 85 °C within seconds, while the temperature on the concentrate outlet would usually take 3 to 4 minutes to reach set-point temperatures. In past CDI hot water cycle testing, the Thornton probes were located on the feed inlet and the product outlet. For this test, an additional probe was placed on the concentrate outlet stream. Since the concentrate flow was so much lower than the dilute flow (even during sanitization), this insured that the concentrate side of the module reached the 85 °C set point for the full 60-minute hold time.<br>
The heating stand included two 8 kW immersion heaters and one 12 kW in-line heater, both controlled by separate mechanical temperature controllers  In practice the 85 °C set point varied by + 3°C. In addition to the set point variation, there also appeared to be some minor heat loss across the module. To attain 85 °C on the concentrate outlet required the feed inlet to be about 87°C to 88 °C.<br>
After cool down, the solenoid drain valves close and the tank return valves opened. As hot water from the tank flowed into the module it forced the cold water that was presently in the module out and into the tank. If the tank temperature was at the low end of the set-point swing, it would sometimes took up to 15 minutes for the tank temperature to recover and raise the module temperature to 85 °C.<br>
Module performance during rinse-ups appeared to decline the more the module was sanitized, as illustrated in Fig. 4A. There was a concern that the slightly thicker Udel spacers may have led to resin slumping and thus the loss in performance. However, autopsy of the module revealed that resin slumping was not a problem; in fact the dilute and concentrate cells were slightly swelled.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the feed conductivity and product resistivity at the beginning and end of each rinse-up after every 26 sanitization cycles. A blend of house RO and DI water was used to makeup the feed water to the CDI during rinse-up because the house RO conductivity was about 12-18 µS/cm. The water ranged between 4 and 12 µS/cm as the flow and RO quality changed throughout the day. Rinse-up of the module after sanitization was very slow. In most cases it was allowed to run overnight. CDI product quality during rinse-up seemed stable for the first 52 sanitization cycles. The feed temperature during rinse-up ranged from about 8 °C at the start of the experiment, to about 15 °C by the middle of the test, and was fairly stable from then on.<br>
The pressure drop across the dilute side of the module was high from the start, but stable throughout the test at 36 psid. The low reading of 30 psid at the start of the test was due to a low dilute flow of 4 gpm. The high reading at the end of the test of 48 psid was due to the module being allowed to rinse-up for 5 days instead of overnight.<br>
The module resistance at the beginning of each rinse-up ranged between 25 to 30 ohms. However after overnight rinse-up the module resistance was higher after each additional 26 sanitization cycles. Initially 29 ohms, the resistance later increased to over 50 ohms. Cross leak on the module was initially about 6 ml/5 minutes at 5 psi and ambient temperature. This increased to about 12 ml/5 minutes after completion of the 156 sanitization cycles.<br>
A SEVERS™ 800 TOC analyzer was used on several occasions during this test to measure product water TOC on-line during hot water sanitization and during rinse-up after sanitization (Figs. 6 and 7). TOC increased during hot water sanitization, and dropped slightly between sanitization cycles, but generally increased with each additional sanitization. The TOC range during hot water sanitization was from 125 ppb to 350 ppb.<br>
The module was shut down overnight. When sanitization resumed in the morning after the module had cooled, the TOC ranged from 125 to 150 ppb at startup. TOC was monitored during two of the rinse-ups, after sanitization cycle 52 and 130. TOC at the start<br>
of rinse-up 52 was approximately 50 ppb, but quickly declined and stabilized at 20 ppb for the 8 hours it was operated. TOC during rinse-up 130 varied between 30 and 13 ppb for the 24 hours it was run. This variation in product TOC was probably due to variation in feed water.<br>
In conclusion, heat sanitization at 85 °C and 30 psig without temperature ramping did not appear to adversely affect the module mechanically, and TOC during and after hot water sanitization on a new module was well below the 500 ppb limit for pharmaceutical water applications.<br>
