DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawing (Fig-1) there is illustrated a swing bed having a swinging mechanism implemented according to the present invention. The swinging mechanism comprises a movable bed top frame assembly (2) and four leg supports (3) fixed on a stationer/ base (4). The stationary base comprises four leg supports (3) (Fig-3) spaced apart, each said leg support having rollers (5) and guiding curved surfaces (6) matching the set swing<br><br>
radius (7) (Fig-2) with respect to said virtual longitudinal axis (8). The movable top frame assembly (2) slidingly connected to the said rollers (5) and guiding curved surfaces (6) by means of corresponding matching curved surfaces and rollers respectively. Two leg supports (3) are housed in each support base assembly called front support base assembly (9) and back support base assembly (10) as shown in the (Fig-1). To impart swinging motion to the movable bed top frame assembly (2) a swing box assembly (11) is located in each of the support base assembly positioned between the two leg supports.<br>
The swing box (11) works under the following mechanism. The invention swing box comprises of a swing box housing (12) (Fig-4) wherein various parts are assembled.<br>
The novel idea being, if the fulcrum of the fulcrum nut pin (13) (Fig-4) is made to move between two predetermined movement limits A &amp; B (14) (Fig-6) over a fixed length with reference to the drive end (16), the corresponding change in the swing width is obtained at the swing end (17) of the lever (15). This is the crux of the invention.<br>
Now, the invention is described in detail with reference to the drawing {Fig-5), which shows the left elevation view of the swing box assembly. The device has a central screw rod (18) mounted on a cross rib support (19) integral to the swing box housing (12). An adjustable fulcrum nut pin (13) positioned at right angled to the central screw rod (18) axis and guides through the front body<br><br>
structure slot (20) (fig-4) and swing lever slot (21). A swing lever (15) is juxtaposed to the swing box housing (12) and has the ability to swing about the axis of the adjustable fulcrunn nut pin (13) position as fulcrum. The swing lever (15) is mounted on a swing lever drive pin (22) and supported by the bracket (23) of the swing box housing (12) through the bracket straight slot (24). The movement of the swing lever (15) is shown in the drawing (Fig-6) depicting various positions of the swing lever (15).<br>
The adjustable fulcrum nut pin (13) moves along the front body structure slot (20) vertically between the positions A and B (14) (Fig-6). The swing lever (15) can obtain a swing width of min.lO mm to max.] 50 mm on either side (i.e., + / -) of the center axis (51). Depending on the design requirement, the max / min swing width could be varied by varying the distance between the fulcrum movements limits A &amp; B (14) (Fig-6)<br>
A worm gear (25) (Fig -5) connected at the bottom of the central screw rod (18), converts the rotational motion in to a linear motion to the adjustable fulcrum nut pin (13)Jhe rotational motion to the worm gear (25) is provided by a swing width drive electric motor (27) (Flg-7) through a worm (26).<br>
Another swing frequency drive electric motor (28) that imparts reciprocation motion to the swing lever drive pin (22) through a rack connecting rod (30) mounted on the output gear of the gear box (29) of the swing frequency drive electric motor (28). The alternate clockwise and anti-clockwise rotation of the output gear<br><br>
of the gear box (29) is converted in to reciprocating movement to the rack connecting rod (30) through a rack pinion arrangement. Adjustable fulcrum nut pin (13) can be fixed / located any where between the fulcrum movement limits A &amp; B (14) (Fig-5 &amp; 6). This is the very important mechanism of the invention. By allowing the adjustable fulcrum nut pin (13) to move with reference to the swing lever drive pin (22) to occupy various points between the fulcrum movement limits A &amp; B location, one can get a Simultaneous Variable swinging action at the swing end (17) of the swing lever (15) while the reciprocating drive is effected at the drive end (16) by the rack connecting rod (30).<br>
The drive hook (31) (Fig-5) fixed at the bottom of the top frame assembly (2) is positioned to slide in the swing lever open slot<br>
(32)	{Fig-4) to transmit the swinging motion of the lever (15) to the<br>
movable top frame assembly (2).<br>
This movable top frame assembly (2) comprises a top frame<br>
(33)	{Fig-8) and bottom frame (34) keeping in between plurality of<br>
springs (35). By providing such an arrangement, any load on the<br>
bed (mattress) (36) (Fig-8) is evenly absorbed by the springs (35)<br>
thereby providing extra comforf to the user. Also, this effect gives a<br>
new, 'floating feel' to the user.<br>
The sv
The first additional feature of the swing bed is that the swing bed is multi-purpose. The movable top frame assembly (2) of the<br><br>
swing bed along with the mattress (36) (Fig-8) can be lifted with reference to the roller holder hinge axis (37) provided in the back support base assembly (10) from the horizontal position to vertical position by means of a lifting mechanism fixed at the head support base (38) (Fig-ll). This lifting mechanism has a lifting electric motor (39) attached with two drums (40) over which two belts (41) are fixed at one end while the other end is fixed with the bed end toggles(42)(Fig-10) passing through a guide rollers (43), for performing the lifting and lowering operation. While lifting the movable top frame assembly (2) the foldable head board frame (49) (Flg-15) will be folded touching the surface of the mattress (36). (Fig.12) shows the isometric view of the complete swing bed without optional features, with movable bed frame assembly in the horizontal position. The control panel (44) is shown in the drawing for remote operation facility. (Fig. 13) shows the isometric view of the complete bed without optional features with movable top bed frame assembly (2) in the vertical position. There is ample storage space (45). (Fig.l4) shows the top view of the complete bed without optional features except the computer monitor (46) assembly with its flexible arm (47) fixed at the head support assembly (48) portraying a user (50) using the computer monitor (46) in lying position. (Fig. 15) Shows the side elevation view of the complete swing bed portraying a user (50) using the computer monitor (46) in a lying position.<br><br>
