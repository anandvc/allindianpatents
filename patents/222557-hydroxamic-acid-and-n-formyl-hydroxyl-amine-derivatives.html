This invention relates to novel hydroxamic acid and N-formyl hydroxylamine derivatives having antibacterial activity, to methods of treatment using such compounds, and to pharmaceutical and veterinary compositions comprising such compounds.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
Many classes of antibacterial agents are known, including the penicillins and cephalosporins, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, monobactams, fluoroquinolones and quinolones, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, macroiides, polymyxins, lincosamides, trimethopnm and chloramphenicol. The fundamental mechanisms of action of these antibacterial classes vary.<br>
Bacterial resistance to many known antibacterials is a growing problem. Accordingly there is a continuing need in the art for alternative antibacterial agents, especially those which have mechanisms of action fundamentally different from the known classes.<br>
Amongst the Gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococci, Streptococci, Mycobacteria and Enterococci, resistant strains have evolved/arisen which makes them particularly difficult to eradicate. Examples of such strains are methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS), penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and multiply resistant Enterococcus faecium.<br>
Pathogenic bacteria are often resistant to the aminoglycoside, (B-lactam (penicillins and cephalosporins), and chloramphenicol types of antibiotic. This resistance involves the enzymatic inactivation of the antibiotic by hydrolysis or by formation of inactive derivatives. The p-lactam (penicillin and cephalosporin) family of antibiotics are characterised by the presence of a p-lactam ring structure. Resistance to this<br><br>
family of antibiotics in clinical isolates is most commonly due to the production of a "penicillinase" (P-lactamase) enzynne by the resistant bactenum which hydrolyses the p-lactam ring thus eliminating its antibacterial activity.<br>
Recently there has been an emergence of vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococci (Woodford N. 1998 Glycopeptide-resistant enterococci: a decade of experience. Journal of Medical Microbiology. 47(10):849-62). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are particularly hazardous in that they are frequent causes of hospital based infections and are inherently resistant to most antibiotics.   Vancomycin works by binding to the terminal D-Ala-D-Ala residues of the cell wall peptidioglycan precursor. The high-level resistance to vancomycin is known as VanA and is conferred by a genes located on a transposable element which alter the terminal residues to D-Ala-D-lac thus reducing the affinity for vancomycin.<br>
In view of the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, the development of antibacterial agents with novel modes of action that are effective against the growing number of resistant bacteria, particularly the vancomycin resistant enterococci and B-lactam antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as methiciilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is of utmost importance.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
This invention is based on the finding that certain hydroxamic acid and N-formyl hydroxylamine derivatives have antibacterial activity, and makes available a new group of antibacterial agents. It has been found that the compounds with which this invention is concerned are antibacterial with respect to a range of bacteria, with potency against Gram-positive organisms generally being greater than against Gram-negatives. Many of the compounds of the invention show activity against bacteria responsible for respratory infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus Influenzae.<br>
Although it may be of interest to establish the mechanism of action of the<br><br>
compounds with which the invention is concerned, it is their ability to inhibit bactenal growth that makes them useful.  However, it is presently believed that their antibacterial activity is due, at least in part, to intracellular inhibition of bacterial polypeptide deformylase (PDF; EC 3.5.1.31).<br>
All ribosome-mediated synthesis of proteins starts with a methionine residue. In prokaryotes the methionyl moiety carried by the initiator tRNA is N-formylated prior to its incorporation into a polypeptide. Consequently, N-formylmethionine is always present at the N-terminus of a nascent bacterial polypeptide. However, most mature proteins do not retain the N-formyl group or the terminal methionine residue. Deformylation is required prior to methionine removal, since methionine aminopeptidase does not recognise peptides with an N-terminal formylmethionine residue (Solbiati et al., J. Mol. Biol. 290:607-614, 1999). Deformylation is, therefore, a crucial step in bacterial protein biosynthesis and the enzyme responsible, PDF, is essential for normal bacterial growth. Although the gene encoding PDF (def) is present in all pathogenic bacteria for which sequences are known (Meinnel et al,, J. Mol. Biol, 266:939-49, 1997), it has no eukaryotic counterpart, making it an attractive target for antibacterial chemotherapy.<br>
The isolation and characterisation of PDF has been facilitated by an understanding of the importance of the metal ion in the active site (Groche et al., Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun., 246:324-6, 1998). The Fe form is highly active in vivo but is unstable when isolated due to oxidative degradation (Rajagopalan et al., J. Biol. Chem. 273:22305-10, 1998). The Ni' form of the enzyme has specific activity comparable with the ferrous enzyme but is oxygen-insensitive (Ragusa et al., J. Mol. Biol. 1998, 280:515-23, 1998). The Zn* enzyme is also stable but is almost devoid of catalytic activity (Rajagopalan etal., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119:12418-12419, 1997).<br>
Several X-ray crystal structures and NMR structures of E. coli PDF, with or without bound inhibitors, have been published (Chan et al.. Biochemistry 36:13904-9, 1997; Becker etal., Nature Stnjct. Biol. 5:1053-8, 1998; Becker etal., J. Biol. Chem.<br><br>
273:11413-6, 1998; Hao et ai., Biochemistry, 38:4712-9, 1999; Dardel et a!., J. Mol. Biol. 280:501-13, 1998; O'Connell et al., J. Biomol. NMR, 13:311-24, 1999), indicating similarities in active site geometry to metalloproteinases such as thermolysin and the metzincins.<br>
Recently the substrate specificity of PDF has been extensively studied (Ragusa et al., J. Mol. Biol. 289:1445-57, 1999; Hu et al., Biochemistry 38:643-50, 1999; Meinnei et al.. Biochemistry, 38:4287-95, 1999). These authors conclude that an unbranched hydrophobic chain is preferred at PI', while a wide variety of P2' substituents are acceptable and an aromatic substituent may be advantageous at the P3' position. There have also been reports that small peptidic compounds containing an H-phosphonate (Hu et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 8:2479-32, 1998) or thiol (Meinnei et al.. Biochemistry, 38:4287-95, 1999) metal binding group are micromoiar inhibitors of PDF. Peptide aldehydes such as calpeptin (N-Cbz-Leu-norleucinal) have also been shown to inhibit PDF (Durand et al.. Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 367:297-302, 1999).  However, the identity of the metal binding group and its spacing from the rest of the molecule ("recognition fragment") has not been studied extensively. Furthermore, non-peptidic PDF inhibitors, which may be desirable from the point of view of bactehal cell wall permeability or oral bioavailability in the host species, have not been identified.<br>
Related Prior Art<br>
Certain N-formyl hydroxylamine dehvatives have previously been claimed in the patent publications listed below, although very few examples of such compounds have been specifically made and deschbed:<br>
EP-B-0236872	(Roche)<br>
WO 92/09563	(Glycomed)<br>
WO 92/04735	(Syntex)<br>
WO 95/19965	(Glycomed)<br>
WO 95/22966	(Sanofi Winthrop)<br><br>
wo 95/33709	(Roche)<br>
WO 96/23791	(Syntax)<br>
WO 96/16027	(Syntex/Agouron)<br>
WO 97/03783	(British Biotech)<br>
WO 97/18207	(DuPont Merck)<br>
WO 98/38179	(GlaxoWellcome)<br>
WO 98/47863	(Labs Jaques Logeais)<br>
The pharmaceutical utility ascribed to the N-formyl hydroxylamine derivatives in those publications is the ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and in some cases release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and hence the treatment of diseases or conditions mediated by those enzymes, such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
In addition to these, US-A-4,738,803 (Roques et al.) also discloses N-formyl hydroxylamine derivatives, however, these compounds are disclosed as enkephalinase inhibitors and are proposed for use as antidepressants and hypotensive agents. Also, WO 97/38705 (Bristol-Myers Squibb) discloses certain N-formyl hydroxylamine derivatives as enkephalinase and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.<br>
Our copending International Patent Application No. WO 99/39704 descnbes and claims, inter alia, the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable salt thereof in the preparation of an antibactenai composition:<br><br>
wherein R, represents hydrogen, C1-Cg alkyl or C1-C5 alkyl substituted by one or more halogen atoms; R, represents a substituted or unsubstituted C1-Cg alkyl,<br><br><br>
wherein R represents the side chain of a natural or non-natural alpha amino acid, and R5 and Rg when taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form an optionally substituted saturated heterocyclic ring of 3 to 8 atoms which ring is optionally fused to a carbocyclic or second heterocyclic nng.<br>
Very many hydroxamic acid derivatives are known. Many have been disclosed as having matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitory activity, and thus to be potentially useful for the treatment of diseases mediated by MMPs, for example cancer, arthritides, and conditions involving tissue remodeling such as wound healing, and restenosis. In addition our International Patent Application No. WO 99/59568 describes the use of analogues of the N-formylhydroxylamine derivatives of WO 99/39704 {wherein the N-formylhydroxylamine group is replaced by a hydroxamic acid group) in the preparation of an antibacterial composition.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a group of antibacterially active hydroxamic acid and and N-formyl hydroxylamine compounds which differ in structure from those of International Patent Applications Nos. WO 99/59568 and WO 99/39704, principally in the nature of the -NRgRg group (see formulae (I), (lA) and (IB) above and the hydroxamic acid analogues thereof). In those applications, the term "optionally substituted" as used in relation to the saturated heterocyclic ring formed by R5, Rg and the nitrogen to which they are attached is defined as meaning certain specific substituents.  In the present<br><br>
compounds, the group -NR5R5 is also an optionally substituted saturated heterocyclic ring of 3 to 8 atoms which ring is optionally fused to a carbocyclic or second heterocyclic nng, but the substituents are different from those permitted by WO 99/59568 and WO 99/39704.

In another aspect, the invention provides a method for the treatment of bactenal infections in humans and non-human mammals, which comprises administering to a subject suffering such infection an antibacterially effective dose of a compound of formula (II) as defined above.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method for the treatment of bactenal contamination by applylng an antibacterially effective amount of a compound of formula (II) as defined above to the site of contamination.<br>
The compounds of formula (!l) as defined above may be used as component(s) of<br><br>
antibacterial cleaning or disinfecting materials.<br>
On the hypothesis that the compounds (II) act by inhibition of intracellular PDF, the most potent antibacterial effect may be achieved by using compounds which efficiently pass through the bacterial cell wall. Thus, compounds which are highly active as inhibitors of PDF in vitro and which penetrate bacterial cells are preferred for use in accordance with the invention. It is to be expected that the antibacterial potency of compounds which are potent inhibitors of the PDF enzyme in vitro, but are poorly cell penetrant, may be inhproved by their use in the form of a prodrug, ie a structurally modified analogue which is converted to the parent molecule of formula (II), for example by enzymic action, after it has passed through the bacterial cell wall.<br>

The widely used handbook by T. W. Greene and P. G. Wuts "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" Second Edition, Wiley, New York, 1991 reviews the subject. For example, carboxyl groups may be esterified (for example as a C1-Cg alkyl ester), amino groups may be converted to amides (for example as a NHCOC,-Cg alkyl amide) or carbamates (for example as an NHC(=0)0C,-C5 alkyl or NHC(=0)0CH2Ph carbamate), hydroxyl groups may be converted to ethers (for example an OC1-Cg alkyl or a 0(0,-06 alkyl)phenyl ether) or esters (for example a 00(=0)0i-05 alkyl ester) and thiol groups may be converted to thioethers (for example a tert-butyl or benzyl thioether) orthioesters (for example a SO(=0)C,-06 alkyl thioester).<br>
There are several actual or potential chiral centres in the compounds according to the invention because of the presence of asymmetric carbon atoms. The presence<br><br>
of several asymmetric carbon atoms gives rise to a number of diastereoisomers with R or S stereochemistry at each chiral centre. The invention includes ail such diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Currently, the preferred stereoconfiguration of the carbon atom carrylng the R, group is R; that of the carbon atom carrylng the R, group (when asymmetric) is S; and that of the carbon atom carrylng the R, group (when asymmetric) is R.<br>

Stock solutions of each test compound were prepared by dissolution of the compound in dimethylsulfoxide at 10mM. For the determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration, two fold serial dilutions were prepared in 2xYT broth (typtone 16g/1, yeast extract 10g/1, sodium chloride 5g/1 obtained from BIO 101 Inc, 1070 Joshua Way, Vista, CA92083, USA) to yleld 0.05 ml compound-containing medium per well. Inocula were prepared from cultures grown overnight in 2xYT broth at 37°C. Cell densities were adjusted to absorbance at 660nm (Aggo) = 0.1; the optical density-standardised preparations were diluted 1:1000 in 2xYT broth; and each well inoculated with 0.05ml of the diluted bacteria. Microtiter plates were incubated at 37°C for 18 hours in a humidified incubator. The MIC (iM) was recorded as the lowest drug concentration that inhibited visible growth.<br>
In general, the compounds of the Examples were more active against the Gram positive S. capitis than the Gram negative E. coli. Results for some of the compounds of the Examples are reported in Table 8:<br><br><br><br>
