				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to processes for producing a granular detergent composition. More particularly, the invention is directed to processes during which detergent granules or agglomerates are produced from starting detergent materials, one of which is a mid-chain branched surfactant. The mid-chain branched surfactants are mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants and mid-chain branched primary alkyl alkoxylated sulfate surfactants having an average of greater than 14.5 carbon atoms. The process produces a free flowing, granular detergent composition which can be commercially sold as a modern compact detergent product.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recently, there has been considerable interest within the detergent industry for laundry detergents which are "compact" and therefore, have low dosage volumes. To facilitate production of these so-called low dosage detergents, many attempts have been made to produce high bulk density detergents, for example with a density of .600 g/1 or higher. The low dosage detergents are currently in high demand as they conserve resources and can be sold in small packages which are more convenient for consumers.<br>
Generally, there are two primary types of processes by which detergent granules or powders can be prepared. The first type of process involves spray-drying an aqueous detergent slurry in a spray-drying tower to produce highly porous detergent granules. In the second type of process, the various detergent components are dry mixed after which they are agglomerated with a binder such as a nonionic or anionic surfactant. In both processes, the most important factors which govern the density of the resulting detergent granules are the density, porosity and surface area of the various starting materials and their respective chemical composition.<br>
There has been interest in the art for providing processes which increase the density of detergent granules or powders. Particular attention has been given to densification of spray-dried granules by post tower treatment. For example, one attempt invplves a batch process in which spray-dried or granulated detergent powders containing sodium _ tripolyphosphate and sodium sulfate are densified and spheronized in a MarumerizerÂ®. This apparatus comprises a substantially horizontal, roughened, rotatable table positioned within and at the base of a substantially vertical, smooth walled cylinder. This process,<br><br>
however, is essentially a batch process and is therefore less suitable for the large scale production of detergent powders. More recently, other processes have developed for increasing the density of "post-tower" or spray dried detergent granules. Typically, such processes require a first apparatus which pulverizes or grinds the granules and a second apparatus which increases the density of the pulverized granules by agglomeration. These processes achieve the desired increase in density by treating or densifying "post tower" or spray dried granules. The art is also replete with disclosures of processes which entail agglomerating detergent compositions. For example, attempts have been made to agglomerate detergent builders by mixing zeolite and/or layered silicates in a mixer to form free flowing agglomerates.<br>
Furthermore, it has been long-established practice for detergent formulators to use surfactants and combinations thereof in detergent compositions. By way of example, various anionic surfactants, especially the alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, alkyl alkoxy sulfates and various nonionic surfactants, such as alkyl ethoxylates and alkylphenol ethoxylates are commonly used in detergent formulations. Surfactants have found use as detergent components capable of the removal of a wide variety of soils and stains. A consistent effort, however, is made by detergent manufacturers to improve detersive properties of detergent compositions by providing new and improved surfactants. A problem commonly associated with anionic surfactants is their sensitivity to cold water and/or hard water. Improved cleaning performance above and beyond current standards, especially for granular detergent compositions to be used under colder wash water conditions and/or in hard water, has been difficult to attain. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a process for making a detergent composition which exhibits improved cleaning performance over a wide variety of soils and stains.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for a process which produces a granular and/or agglomerated detergent composition from starting detergent ingredients including a surfactant which exhibits improved cleaning performance over a wide variety of soils and stains. Also, there remains a need for such a process which is more efficient and economical to facilitate large-scale production of low dosage or compact detergents.<br>

EP 439,3 16 describes certain laundry detergents containing a specific commercial C14/C15 branched primary alkyl sulfate, namely LIAL 145 sulfate.

wherein the total number of carbon atoms ranges from 12 to 20 and Rl is a straight chain alkyl radical containing 9 to 17 carbon atoms and R2 is a straight chain alkyl radical containing 1 to 9 carbon atoms (67% 2-methyl and 33% 2-ethyl branching is exemplified).<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a flow chart illustrating a preferred process in which two agglomerating mixer/densifiers, fluid bed dryer, fluid bed cooler and screening apparatus are serially positioned in accordance with one process of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present process is used in the production of detergent compositions by way of agglomeration of starting detergent ingredients including a mid-chain branched surfactant or by way of spray drying techniques which can include further processing of the "post-tower" detergent granules. By "post-tower" detergent granules, it is meant those detergent granules which have been processed through a conventional spray-<br><br>
drying tower or similar apparatus.<br>
Agglomeration Process<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 1 which presents a flow chart illustrating the agglomeration process and various embodiments thereof. In the first step of the process, the invention entails continuously mixing into a high speed mixer/densifier 10 several streams of starting detergent ingredients including a surfactant paste stream 12 which includes the mid-chain branched surfactant and a dry starting detergent material stream 14. Based on the finished agglomerate weight basis, the surfactant paste 12 preferably comprises water and from about 25% to about 75%, preferably from about 35% to about 65% and, most preferably from about 38% to about 55%, of the mid-chain branched surfactant or combinations of such a surfactant and adjunct surfactants, all of which is described in detail hereinafter. Preferably, the dry starting detergent material 14 comprises from about 10% to about 50%, preferably from about 15% to about 45% and, most preferably from about 20% to about 40% of an aluminosilicate or zeolite builder and from about 10% to about 40%, preferably from about 15% to about 30% and, most preferably from about 15% to about 25% of a sodium carbonate. It should be understood that additional starting detergent ingredients several of which are described hereinafter may be mixed into high speed mixer/densifier 10 without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
However, it has been found that the surfactant paste 12 and the dry starting detergent material 14 are continuously mixed within the ratio ranges described herein so as to ensure production of the desired free flowing, crisp, high density detergent composition. Preferably, the ratio of the surfactant paste 12 to the dry starting detergent material 14 is from about 1:10 to about 10:1, more preferably from about 1:4 to about 4:1 and, most preferably from about 2:1 to about 2:3.<br>
Also, it has been found that the first processing step can be successfully completed, under the process parameters described herein, in a high speed mixer/densifier 10 which preferably is a L6dige CB mixer or similar brand mixer. These types of mixers essentially consist of a horizontal, hollow static cylinder having a centrally mounted rotating shaft around which several plough-shaped blades are attached. Preferably, the shaft rotates at a speed of from about 300 rpm to about 2500 rpm, more preferably from about 400 rpm to about 1600 rpm. Preferably, the mean residence time of the detergent ingredients in the high speed mixer/densifier 10 is preferably in range from about 2 seconds to about 45 seconds, and most preferably from about 5 seconds to about 15 seconds. The mean residence time can be conveniently and accurately measured by dividing the tear weight of the mixer/densifier by the throughput (e.g., kg/hr).<br><br>
The resulting detergent agglomerates formed in the high speed mixer/densifier 10 are then fed into a lower or moderate speed mixer/densifier 16 during which further agglomeration and densification is carried forth. This particular moderate speed mixer/densifier 16 used in the present process should include liquid distribution and agglomeration tools so that both techniques can be carried forth simultaneously. It is preferable to have the moderate speed mixer/densifier 16 to be, for example, a Lodige KM (Ploughshare) mixer, DraisÂ® K-T 160 mixer or similar brand mixer. The main centrally rotating shaft speed is from about 30 to about 160 rpm, more preferably from about 50 to about 100 rpm. The mean residence time in the moderate speed mixer/densifier 16 is preferably from about 0.25 minutes to about 15 minutes, most preferably the residence time is about 0.5 to about 10 minutes. This mean residence time also can be conveniently and accurately measured by dividing the tear weight of the mixer/densifier at steady state by the throughput (e.g., kg/hr). The liquid distribution is accomplished by cutters, generally smaller in size than the rotating shaft, which preferably operate at about 3600 rpm.<br>
In accordance with the present process, the high speed mixer/densifier 10 and moderate speed mixer/densifier 16 in combination preferably impart a requisite amount of energy to form the desired agglomerates. More particularly, the instant process imparts from about 5 x 1010 erg/kg to about 2 x 1012 erg/kg at a rate of from about 3x108 erg/kg-sec to about 3 x 109 erg/kg-sec to form free flowing high density detergent agglomerates. The energy input and rate of input can be determined by calculations from power readings to the moderate speed mixer/densifier with and without granules, residence time of the granules in the mixer/densifier, and the mass of the granules in the mixer/densifier. Such calculations are clearly within the scope of the skilled artisan.<br>
The density of the resulting detergent agglomerates exiting the moderate speed mixer/densifier 16 is at least 600 g/1, more preferably from about 700 g/1 to about 800 g/1. Thereafter, the detergent agglomerates are dried in a fluid bed dryer 18 or similar apparatus to obtain the high density granular detergent composition which is ready for packaging and sale as a low dosage, compact detergent product at this point. The particle porosity of the resulting detergent agglomerates of the composition is preferably in a range from about 5% to about 20%, more preferably at about 10%. As those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, a low porosity detergent agglomerate provides a dense or low dosage detergent product, to which the present process is primarily directed. In addition, an attribute of dense or densified detergent agglomerates is the relative particle size. The present process typically provides agglomerates having a median particle size of from about 400 microns to about 700 microns, and more preferably from about 475 microns to about 600 microns. As used herein, the phrase "median particle size" refers to individual agglomerates and not individual particles or detergent granules. The combination of the above-referenced<br><br>
porosity and particle size results in agglomerates having density values of 600 g/l and higher. Such a feature is especially useful in the production of low dosage laundry detergents as well as other granular compositions such as dishwashing compositions.<br>
Optional Process Steps<br>
In an optional step of the present process, the detergent agglomerates exiting the fluid bed dryer 18 are further conditioned by cooling the agglomerates in a fluid bed cooler 20 or similar apparatus as are well known in the art. Another optional process step involves adding a coating agent to improve flowability and/or minimize over agglomeration of the detergent composition in one or more of the following locations of the instant process: (1) the coating agent can be added directly after the fluid bed cooler 20 as shown by coating agent stream 22 (preferred); (2) the coating agent may be added between the fluid bed dryer 18 and the fluid bed cooler 20 as shown by coating agent stream 24; (3) the coating agent may be added between the fluid bed dryer 18 and the moderate speed mixer/densifier 16 as shown by stream 26; and/or (4) the coating agent may be added directly to the moderate speed mixer/densifier 16 and the fluid bed dryer 18 as shown by stream 28. It should be understood that the coating agent can be added in any one or a combination of streams 22, 24, 26, and 28 as shown in Fig. 1. The coating agent stream 22 is the most preferred in the instant process. See Capeci et al, U.S. Patent 5,516,448, issued May 14, 1996 and Capeci et al, U.S. Patent 5,489,392, issued February 6, 1996.<br>
The coating agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of aluminosilicates, silicates, carbonates and mixtures thereof. The coating agent can also be the improved builder material described in more detail hereinafter. However, the coating agent may be one or more combinations of the builder material, aluminosilicates, carbonates, silicates and the like. The coating agent not only enhances the free flowability of the resulting detergent composition which is desirable by consumers in that it permits easy scooping of detergent during use, but also serves to control agglomeration by preventing or minimizing over agglomeration, especially when added directly to the moderate speed mixer/densifier 16. As those skilled in the art are well aware, over agglomeration can lead to very undesirable flow properties and aesthetics of the final detergent product.<br>
Optionally, the process comprises the step of spraying an additional binder in one or both of the mixer/densifiers 10 and 16. A binder is added for purposes of enhancing agglomeration by providing a "binding" or "sticking" agent for the detergent components. The binder is preferably selected from the group consisting of water, anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone polyacrylates, citric acid and mixtures thereof. Other suitable binder materials including those listed herein are<br><br>
described in Beerse et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,108,646 (Procter &amp; Gamble Co.), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Other optional steps contemplated by the present process include screening the oversized detergent agglomerates in a screening apparatus 30 which can take a variety of forms including but not limited to conventional screens chosen for the desired particle size of the finished detergent product. Other optional steps include conditioning of the detergent agglomerates by subjecting the agglomerates to additional drying.<br>
Another optional step of the instant process entails finishing the resulting detergent agglomerates by a variety of processes including spraying and/or admixing other conventional detergent ingredients, collectively referenced as the finishing step 32 in Fig. I. For example, the finishing step encompasses spraying perfumes, brighteners and enzymes onto the finished agglomerates to provide a more complete detergent composition. Such techniques and ingredients are well known in the art.<br>
Preferably, the resulting detergent agglomerates produced by the process embodiments described herein contain from about 20% to about 50% by weight of the mid-chain branched surfactant, from about 10% to about 65% of a detergent builder such as aluminosilicate, and optionally, up to about 40% by weight of sodium carbonate. The surfactant, builder, and carbonate levels can vary beyond those given here as described previously and hereinafter. -<br>
Spray Drying Process<br>
One or more spray drying techniques can be used alone, or in combination with the aforementioned agglomeration processes, to make detergent compositions containing the mid-chain branched surfactants in accordance with the instant invention. One or more spray-drying towers may be employed to manufacture granular laundry detergents which often have a density of about 500 g/1 or less. In this procedure, an aqueous slurry of various heat-stable ingredients in the final detergent composition are formed into homogeneous granules by passage through a spray-drying tower, using conventional techniques, at temperatures of about 175Â°C to about 225Â°C. If spray drying is used as part of the overall process herein, additional process steps as described herein can be optionally used to obtain the level of density (i.e., &gt; 650 g/1) required by modern compact, low dosage detergent products.<br>
For example, spray-dried granules from a tower can be densified further by loading a liquid such as water or a nonionic surfactant into the pores of the granules and/or subjecting them to one or more high speed mixer/densifiers. A suitable high speed mixer/densifier for this process is the aforementioned "L6dige CB 30" or "Lodige CB 30 Recycler" which comprises a static cylindrical mixing drum having a central rotating shaft with mixing/cutting blades mounted thereon. In use, the ingredients for the detergent<br><br>
composition are introduced into the drum and the shaft/blade assembly is rotated at speeds in the range of 100-2500 rpm to provide thorough mixing/densification. See Jacobs et al, U.S. Patent 5,149,455, issued September 22, 1992. Other such apparatus includes the devices marketed under the trade name "Shugi Granulator" and under the tradename "Drais K-TTP 80).<br>
Another process step which can be used to density further spray-dried granules involves grinding and agglomerating or deforming the spray-dried granules in a moderate speed mixer/densifier so as to obtain particles having lower porosity.   Equipment such as the aforementioned "Lodige KM" (Series 300 or 600) or "L8dige Ploughshare" mixer/densifiers are suitable for this process step. Other useful equipment includes the device which is available under the tradename "Drais K-T 160". This process step which employs a moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige KM) can be used by itself or sequentially with the aforementioned high speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige CB) to achieve the desired density. Other types of granules manufacturing apparatus useful herein include the apparatus disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,306,898, to G. L. Heller, December 29, 1942.<br>
While it may be more suitable to use the high speed mixer/densifier followed by the low speed mixer/densifier, the reverse sequential mixer/densifier configuration is also contemplated by the invention. One or a combination of various parameters including residence times in the mixer/densifiers, operating temperatures of the equipment, temperature and/or composition of the granules, the use of adjunct ingredients such as liquid binders and flow aids, can be used to optimize densification of the spray-dried granules in the process of the invention. By way of example, see the processes in Appel et al, U.S. Patent 5,133,924, issued July 28, 1992 (spray-dried granules are brought into a deformable state prior to densification); Delwel et al, U.S. Patent 4,637,891, issued January 20, 1987 (granulating spray-dried granules with a liquid binder and aluminosilicate); Kruse et al, U.S. Patent 4,726,908, issued February 23, 1988 (granulating spray-dried granules with a liquid binder and aluminosilicate); and, Bortolotti et al, U.S. Patent 5,160,657, issued November 3, 1992 (coating densified spray-dried granules with a liquid binder and aluminosilicate).<br>
Admixing Process<br>
Specifically, other aspects of the process invention include admixing the builder material with spray dried granules, agglomerates or combinations thereof. This admixing step may be enhanced by combining the granules, agglomerates, or combinationsjhereof with the builder material and a liquid binder as described previously in a mixing drum or other similar device. Optionally, the builder material may be coated with a nonionic surfactant or other liquid binder as described previously before the admixing step so as to<br><br>
preclude any deleterious interaction with the other detergent ingredients (e.g. anionic surfactants) prior to immersion in the washing solution (i.e. during processing and storage). This liquid binder (e.g. nonionic surfactant) coating also improves the flow properties of the detergent composition in which the builder material is included.<br>
Other Processes<br>
In yet another process embodiment, the high density detergent composition can be produced by feeding a liquid acid precursor of an anionic surfactant, such as the mid-chain branched surfactant described herein, an alkaline inorganic material (e.g. sodium carbonate) and optionally other detergent ingredients into a high speed mixer/densifier (residence time 5-30 seconds) so as to form agglomerates containing a partially or totally neutralized anionic surfactant salt and the other starting detergent ingredients. Subsequently, the contents in the high speed mixer/densifier can be sent to a moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige KM) for further agglomeration resulting in the finished high density detergent composition. In another process embodiment, the surfactant paste is premixed or extruded in a mixing or extruding apparatus such as a twin-screw extruder (e.g., Werner and Pfleiderer, Continua Series) to structure the paste for easier agglomeration. Additionally, structuring agents such as polymers, sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride, postassium hydroxide silicates and the like can be used to render the paste more suitable for loading higher amounts of surfactant. See Aouad et al, U.S. Patent 5,451,354, issued September 19, 1995.<br>
Optionally, high density detergent compositions can be produced by blending conventional or densified spray-dried detergent granules with detergent agglomerates in various proportions (e.g. a 60:40 weight ratio of granules to agglomerates) produced by one or a combination of the processes discussed herein. Additional adjunct ingredients such as enzymes, perfumes, brighteners and the like can be sprayed or admixed with the agglomerates, granules or mixtures thereof produced by the processes discussed herein.<br>
Another process of the invention involves cooling a molten surfactant paste containing the mid-chain branched surfactant and forming flakes on a chill roll, after which the flakes are ground to the desired particle size. The cooled flakes can be dried further using a rotary drum dryer.<br>
Surfactant Paste<br>
The viscoelastic surfactant paste used herein has viscoelastic fluid properties which can be described by a commonly used mathematical model that accounts for the shear thinning nature of the paste. The mathematical model is called the Power Law Model and is described by the following relation:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where Ï= Shear Stress (dynes/cm2), K = Consistency (Poise-secn-1 0,Î³ = Shear Rate (sec'1), and n = Rate Index (dimensionless). The rate index n varies from 0 to 1. The closer n is to 0, the more shear thinning the fluid. The closer n is to 1, the closer it is to simple Newtonian behavior, i.e.<br>
constant viscosity behavior. K can be interpreted as the apparent viscosity at a shear rate of 1 sec' 1<br>
In this context, the viscoelastic surfactant paste used in the process has a consistency K at 70Â°C of from about 50,000 to about 450,000 cPoise-secn-1(500 to 2,500 Poise-secn-1), more preferably from about 100,000 to about 195,000 cPoise-secn-1 (1,000 to 1,950 Poise-secn-1), and most preferably from about 120,000 to about 180,000 cPoise-secn-1(1,200 to 1,800 Poise-secn-1). Preferably, the surfactant paste has a shear index n of from about 0.05 to about 0.25, more preferably from about 0.08 to about 0.20 and most preferably from about 0.10 to about 0.15.<br>
The surfactant paste includes surfactant mixtures comprising mid-chain branched surfactant compounds as described herein before. In such compositions, certain points of branching (e.g., the location along the chain of the R, R1, and/or R2 moieties in the above formula) are preferred over other points of branching along the backbone of the surfactant. The formula below illustrates the mid-chain branching range (i.e., where points of branching occur), preferred mid-chain branching range, and more preferred mid-chain branching range for mono-methyl branched alkyl Ab moieties useful according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It should be noted that for the mono-methyl substituted surfactants these ranges exclude the two terminal carbon atoms of the chain and the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the -X - B group.<br>
The formula below illustrates the mid-chain branching range, preferred mid-chain branching range, and more preferred mid-chain branching range for di-methyl substituted alkyl Ab moieties useful according to the present invention.<br>

The preferred branched surfactant compositions useful in cleaning compositions according to the present invention are described in more detail hereinafter.<br>

The present invention branched surfactant compositions may comprise two or more mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The surfactant mixtures of the present invention comprise molecules having a linear primary alkyl sulfate chain backbone (i.e., the longest linear carbon chain which includes the sulfated carbon atom). These alkyl chain backbones comprise from 12 to 19 carbon atoms; and further the molecules comprise a branched primary alkyl moiety having at least a total of 14, but not more than 20, carbon atoms. In addition, the surfactant mixture has an average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl moieties within the range of from greater than 14.5 to about 17.5. Thus, the present invention mixtures comprise at least one branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactant compound having a longest linear carbon chain of not less than 12 carbon atoms or more than 19 carbon atoms, and the total number of carbon atoms including branching must be at least 14, and further the average total number of carbon atoms' for the branched primary alkyl chains is within the range of greater than 14.5 to about 17.5.<br>
For example, a C16 total carbon primary alkyl sulfate surfactant having 13 carbon atoms in the backbone must have 1, 2, or 3 branching units (i.e., R, R1 and/or R2) whereby total number of carbon atoms in the molecule is at least 16. In this example, the C 16 total carbon requirement may be satisfied equally by having, for example, one propyl branching unit or three methyl branching units.<br>
R, Rl, and R2 are each independently selected from hydrogen and C1-C3 alkyl (preferably hydrogen or C\-C2 alkyl, more preferably hydrogen or methyl, and most preferably methyl), provided R, R1, and R2 are not all hydrogen. Further, when z is 1, at least R or R1 is not hydrogen.<br>
Although for the purposes of the present invention surfactant compositions the above formula does not include molecules wherein the units R, R1, and R2 are all hydrogen (i.e., linear non-branched primary alkyl sulfates), it is to be recognized that the present invention compositions may still further comprise some amount of linear, non-branched primary alkyl sulfate. Further, this linear non-branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactant may be present as the result of the process used to manufacture the surfactant mixture<br><br>
having the requisite one or more mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfates according to the present invention, or for purposes of formulating detergent compositions some amount of linear non-branched primary alkyl sulfate may be admixed into the final product formulation.<br>
Further it is to be similarly recognized that non-sulfated mid-chain branched alcohol may comprise some amount of the present invention compositions. Such materials may be present as the result of incomplete sulfation of the alcohol used to prepare the alkyl sulfate surfactant, or these alcohols may be separately added to the present invention detergent compositions along with a mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate surfactant according to the present invention.<br>

(2) Mid-chain Branched Primary Alkyl Polyoxyalkylene Surfactants<br>
The present invention branched surfactant compositions may comprise one or more mid-chain branched primary alkyl polyoxyalkylene surfactants having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The surfactant mixtures of the present invention comprise molecules having a linear primary polyoxyalkylene chain backbone (i.e., the longest linear carbon chain which includes the alkoxylated carbon atom). These alkyl chain backbones comprise from 12 to 19 carbon atoms; and further the molecules comprise a branched primary alkyl moiety having at least a total of 14, but not more than 20, carbon atoms. In addition, the surfactant mixture has an average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl moieties within the range of from greater than 14.5 to about 17.5. Thus, the present invention mixtures comprise at least one polyoxyalkylene compound having a longest linear carbon chain of not less than 12.carbon atoms or more than 19 carbon atoms, and the total number of carbon atoms including branching must be at least 14, and further the average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl chains is within the range of greater than 14.5 to about 17.5.<br>
For example, a C16 total carbon (in the alkyl chain) primary polyoxyalkylene surfactant having 15 carbon atoms in the backbone must have a methyl branching unit<br><br>
 (either R, R1 or R2 is methyl) whereby the total number of carbon atoms in the molecule is 16.<br>
R, R1, and R2 are each independently selected from hydrogen and C1j-C3 alkyl (preferably hydrogen or C1-C2 alkyl, more preferably hydrogen or methyl, and most preferably methyl), provided R, R1, and R^ are not all hydrogen. Further, when z is 1, at least R or R! is not hydrogen.<br>
Although for the purposes of the present invention surfactant compositions the above formula does not include molecules wherein the units R, R1, and R2 are all hydrogen (i.e., linear non-branched primary polyoxyalkylenes), it is to be recognized that the present invention compositions may still further comprise some amount of linear, non-branched primary polyoxyalkylene. Further, this linear non-branched primary polyoxyalkylene surfactant may be present as the result of the process used to manufacture the surfactant mixture having the requisite mid-chain branched primary polyoxyalkylenes according to the present invention, or for purposes of formulating detergent compositions some amount of linear non-branched primary polyoxyalkylene may be admixed into the final product formulation.<br>
Further it is to be similarly recognized that non-alkoxylated mid-chain branched alcohol may comprise some amount of the present invention polyoxyalkylene-containing compositions. Such materials may be present as the result of incomplete alkoxylation of the alcohol used to prepare the polyoxyalkylene surfactant, or these alcohols.may be separately added to the present invention detergent compositions along with a mid-chain branched polyoxyalkylene surfactant according to the present invention.<br>
Further regarding the above formula, w is an integer from 0 to 13; x is an integer from 0 to 13; y is an integer from 0 to 13; z is an integer of at least 1; and w + x + y + zis an integer from 8 to 14.<br>

The (EO/PO)m moiety may be either a distribution with average degree of alkoxylation (e.g., ethoxylation and/or propoxylation) corresponding to m, or it may be a single specific chain with alkoxylation (e.g., ethoxylation and/or propoxylation) of exactly the number of units corresponding to m.<br>

(3) Mid-chain Branched Primary Alkyl Alkoxylated Sulfate Surfactants<br>
The present invention branched surfactant compositions may comprise one or more (preferably a mixture of two or more) mid-chain branched primary alkyl alkoxylated sulfates having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The surfactant mixtures of the present invention comprise molecules having a linear primary alkoxylated sulfate chain backbone (i.e., the longest linear carbon chain which includes the alkoxy-sulfated carbon atom). These alkyl chain backbones comprise from 12 to 19 carbon atoms; and further the molecules comprise a branched primary alkyl moiety having at least a total of 14, but not more than 20, carbon atoms. In addition, the surfactant mixture has an average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl moieties within the range of from greater than 14.5 to about 17.5. Thus, the present<br><br>
invention mixtures comprise at least one alkoxylated sulfate compound having a longest linear carbon chain of not less than 12 carbon atoms or more than 19 carbon atoms, and the total number of carbon atoms including branching must be at least 14, and further the average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl chains is within the range of greater than 14.5 to about 17.5.<br>
For example, a C16 total carbon (in the alkyl chain) primary alkyl alkoxylated sulfate surfactant having 15 carbon atoms in the backbone must have a methyl branching unit (either R, R1 or R2 is methyl) whereby the total number of carbon atoms in the primary alkyl moiety of the molecule is 16.<br>
R, R1, and R2 are each independently selected from hydrogen and C1-C3 alkyl (preferably hydrogen or C1-C2 alkyl, more preferably hydrogen or methyl, and most preferably methyl), provided R, R1, and R2 are not all hydrogen. Further, when z is 1, at least R or R! is not hydrogen.<br>
Although for the purposes of the present invention surfactant compositions the above formula does not include molecules wherein the units R, R1, and R2 are all hydrogen (i.e., linear non-branched primary alkoxylated sulfates), it is to be recognized that the present invention compositions may still further comprise some amount of linear, non-branched primary alkoxylated sulfate. Further, this linear non-branched primary alkoxylated sulfate surfactant may be present as the result of the process used to manufacture the surfactant mixture having the requisite mid-chain branched primary alkoxylated sulfates according to the present invention, or for purposes of formulating detergent compositions some amount of linear non-branched primary alkoxylated sulfate may be admixed into the final product formulation.<br>
It is also to be recognized that some amount of mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate may be present in the compositions. This is typically the result of sulfation ofnon-alkoxylated alcohol remaining following incomplete alkoxylation of the mid-chain branched alcohol used to prepare the alkoxylated sulfate useful herein. It is to be recognized, however, that separate addition of such mid-chain branched alkyl sulfates is also contemplated by the present invention compositions.<br>
Further it is to be similarly recognized that non-sulfated mid-chain branched alcohol (including polyoxyalkylene alcohols) may comprise some amount of the present invention alkoxylated sulfate-containing compositions. Such materials may be present as the result of incomplete sulfation of the alcohol (alkoxylated or non-alkoxylated) used to prepare the alkoxylated sulfate surfactant, or these alcohols may be separately added to the present invention detergent compositions along with a mid-chain branched alkoxylated sulfate surfactant according to the present invention.<br>
M is as described hereinbefore.<br><br>
Further regarding the above formula, w is an integer from 0 to 13; x is an integer from 0 to 13; y is an integer from 0 to 13; z is an integer of at least 1; and w + x + y + z is an integer from 8 to 14.<br>

For example, the builder can be selected from the group consisting of aluminosilicates, crystalline layered silicates, MAP zeolites, citrates, amorphous silicates, polycarboxylates, sodium carbonates and mixtures thereof. The sodium carbonate ingredient can serve as the inorganic alkaline material when a liquid acid precursor of the mid-chain branched surfactant is used. Other suitable auxiliary builders are described hereinafter.<br>
Preferred builders include aluminosilicate ion exchange materials and sodium carbonate. The aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein as a detergent builder preferably have both a high calcium ion exchange capacity and a high exchange rate. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that such high calcium ion exchange rate and capacity are a function of several interrelated factors which derive from the method by which the aluminosilicate ion exchange material is produced. In that regard, the aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein are preferably produced in accordance with Corkill et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,605,509 (Procter &amp; Gamble), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Preferably, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material is in "sodium" form since the potassium and hydrogen forms of the instant aluminosilicate do not exhibit the as-high of an exchange rate and capacity as provided by the sodium form. Additionally, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material preferably is in over dried form so as to facilitate production of crisp detergent agglomerates as described herein. The aluminosilicate ion<br><br>
exchange materials used herein preferably have particle size diameters which optimize their effectiveness as detergent builders. The term "particle size diameter" as used herein represents the average particle size diameter of a given aluminosilicate ion exchange material as determined by conventional analytical techniques, such as microscopic determination and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The preferred particle size diameter of the aluminosilicate is from about 0.1 micron to about 10 microns, more preferably from about 0.5 microns to about 9 microns. Most preferably, the particle size diameter is from about 1 microns to about 8 microns.<br>
Preferably, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is from about 1 to about 5 and x is from about 10 to about 264. More preferably, the aluminosilicate has the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, preferably about 27. These preferred aluminosilicates are available commercially, for example under designations Zeolite A, Zeolite B and Zeolite X. Alternatively, naturally-occurring or synthetically derived aluminosilicate ion exchange materials suitable for use herein can be made as described in Krummel et al, U.S. Patent No. 3,985,669, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The aluminosilicates used herein are further characterized by their ion exchange capacity which is at least about 200 mg equivalent of CaCO3 hardness/gram, calculated on an anhydrous basis, and which is preferably in a range from about 300 to 352 mg equivalent of CaCO3 hardness/gram. Additionally, the instant aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are still further characterized by their calcium ion exchange rate which is at least about 2 grains Ca~H7gallon/minute/-gram/gallon, and more preferably in a range from about 2 grains Ca++/gallon/minute/-gram/gallon to about 6 grains Ca++f/gaHon/minute/-gram/gallon.<br>
In order to make the present invention more readily understood, reference is made to the following examples, which are intended to be illustrative only and not intended to be limiting in scope.<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
This Example illustrates the process of the invention which produces free flowing, crisp, high density detergent composition. Two feed streams of various detergent-starting ingredients are continuously fed, at a rate of 2800 kg/hr, into a Lo'dige CB-30 mixer/densifier, one of which comprises a surfactant paste containing surfactant and water and the other stream containing starting dry detergent material containing aluminosilicate<br><br>
and sodium carbonate. The rotational speed of the shaft in the Lodige CB-30 mixer/densifier is about 1400 rpm and the mean residence time is about 10 seconds. The contents from the Lodige CB-30 mixer/densifer are continuously fed into a Lodige KM 600 mixer/densifer for further agglomeration during which the mean residence time is about 30 seconds. The resulting detergent agglomerates are then fed to a fluid bed dryer and then to a fluid bed cooler, the mean residence time being about 10 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively. A coating agent, aluminosilicate, is fed after the Lodige KM 600 mixer/densifier to control and prevent over agglomeration. The detergent agglomerates are then screened with conventional screening apparatus resulting in a uniform particle size distribution. The composition of the detergent agglomerates exiting the fluid bed cooler for three process runs are set forth in Table I below:<br>
TABLE I<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 are sprayed onto the agglomerates described above in the finishing step to result in a finished detergent composition. The relative proportions of the overall finished detergent composition produced by the process of instant process is presented in Table II below:<br>
TABLE II<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
IA mixture of a mid-chain branched C16.5 alkyl sulfate ("BAS"), C14-15 alkyl sulfate ("AS") and C 12-13 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate ("LAS") surfactants. C-12-13 alkyl ethoxylate (EO=6.5) commercially available from Shell Oil Company.<br>
The density of the resulting detergent composition is 796 g/1, the median particle size is 613 microns.<br>
EXAMPLE II-III<br>
Several detergent compositions made in accordance with the invention and specifically for top-loading washing machines are exemplified below. The base granule is prepared by a conventional spray drying process in which the starting ingredients are formed into a slurry and passed though a spray drying tower having a counter current stream of hot air (200-300Â°C) resulting in the formation of porous granules. The admixed agglomerates are formed from two feed streams of various starting detergent ingredients which are continuously fed, at a rate of 1400 kg/hr, into a L6dige CB-30 mixer/densifier, one of which comprises a surfactant paste containing surfactant and water and the other stream containing starting dry detergent material containing aluminosilicate and sodium carbonate. The rotational speed of the shaft in the Lodige CB-30 mixer/densifier is about 1400 rpm and the median residence time is about 5-10 seconds. The contents from the Lodige CB-30 mixer/densifier are continuously fed into a Lodige KM-600 mixer/densifier for further agglomeration during which the mean residence time is about 1-2 minutes. The resulting detergent agglomerates are then fed to a fluid bed dryer and to a fluid bed cooler before being admixed with the spray dried granules. The remaining adjunct detergent ingredients are sprayed on or dry added to the blend of agglomerates and granules.<br>
