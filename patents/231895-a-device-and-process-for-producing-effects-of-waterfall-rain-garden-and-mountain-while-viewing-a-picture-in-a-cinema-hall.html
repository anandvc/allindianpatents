releasing the gas / perfume or energizing the heating/cooling means to produce the desired effects corresponding to the scene appearing on the screen.<br>
The said coded signal including an idle signals are either analogue or digital signal and are recorded against each desired scene.<br>
The said coded signal is an analogue signal in the form of frequency or amplitude or phase modulation or any combination thereof.<br>
The said coded signal is a digital signal and the number of bits to be used in the said digital coded signal depend upon the number of effects to be produced in cinema hall/open theatre/ TV.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a device for producing heating/cooling/aromatic effects of at least one of waterfall, rain, garden, mountains, desert, animals, kitchen and river scenes while viewing a picture, an advertisement or playing amusement games in a cinema hall/open theater/TV comprising: movie film/video tape/disc recorded with coded signals such as herein described for producing effects of at least one of waterfall, rain, garden, mountain, desert, kitchen and river scenes of advertisements, said coded signals either recorded separately or embedded on the sound signals; an electronic decoder for decoding said coded signals when said effect is to be expressed or a particular scene appears; and actuating means connected to an output of the electronic decoder for releasing gas/perfumes or energizing heating/cooling means to produce the desired effects corresponding to the scene appearing on a screen of the cinema hall/open theater/TV.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the invention in a closed theater where the coded signals and the sound signals are separately recorded on the film (F) / Video Tape.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the invention in a closed theater where the coded signal is embedded with the sound signal.<br>
Fig. 3 explains the invention in an open theater where the coded signal is embedded with the sound signal.<br>
Referring to the figure 1 film (F) / video tape has sound signals (S) and coded signals (D). The said coded signal (D) has an idle code (I). When the film (F) is moving and a particular scene, say, rain scene appears on the screen in a cinema hall, the coded signal (D) is sensed by the electronic decoder (ED) which is connected to actuating means (AM) for releasing the gas/perfume from the containers (Cl, C2) or energize the heating/cooling means (C3, C4 etc.) to produce the desired effects in the hall. The hall has the exhaust (El) and (E2).<br>
Referring to figure 2, the film (F) /video tape has coded signal embedded on the sound signal. The said coded signal (D) has an idle code (I). When the film (F) is moving and a particular scene, say, rain scene appears on the screen in a cinema hall, the coded signal (D) is sensed by the electronic decoder (ED) after sound signals are filtered'through filter (Fl) which is connected to actuating means (AM) for releasing the gas/perfume from the containers (Cl, C2) or energize the heating/cooling means (C3, C4 etc.) to produce the desired effects in the hall.<br>
The hall has the exhaust (El) and (E2). The idle code (I) functions only if the earlier effect has not exhausted.<br>
Referring to figure 3, in an open air theater, the film (F) /video tape has coded signal embedded on the sound signal. The said coded signal (D) has an idle code (I). When the film (F) is moving and a particular scene, say, rain scene appears on the screen, the coded signal (D) is sensed by the electronic decoder (ED) after sound signals are filtered through filter (Fl) which is connected to actuating means (AM) for releasing the gas/perfume from the containers (Cl, C2) or energize the heating/cooling means (C3, C4 etc.) to produce the desired effects in the hall. The open air theater does not require exhausts (El) and (E2). The idle code (I) functions only if the earlier effect has not exhausted.<br>
The actuating means can be a motor or a relay for energizing the heating/cooling means. It can be a solenoid for opening the gas cylinder for releasing the perfume or ozone gas for producing the rain effect. The perfume is meant for giving the effect of the flowers in the garden. The idle code is provided in the coded signals for idling the actuating means till the first effect, say, rain scene releasing ozone gas has been exhausted through exhausts (El) &amp; (E2).<br>
The optical device (OD) converts the sound signal to produce sound from the sound signals recorded on the film / tape .<br>
The above invention can be used even with the video cassettes in the drawing room in the house and also while playing amusement games by providing the above arrangements.<br>
Thus, the present invention includes human sense of smelling different smells/aromas and feeling different temperatures, climate, wind etc., for example, if a chocolate advertisement is shown in a movie hall, viewers can smell chocolate flavoured air, or a particular brand of perfume can be smelled or for creating the effect of wind air blower are used.<br>
The above invention includes any modification of the above invention including mechanical means in place of electronic means.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
