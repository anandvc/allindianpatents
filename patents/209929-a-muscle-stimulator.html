				<td>This invention relates to a muscle stimulator for use by the Doctors during the operation. Particularly this invention relates to a muscle stimulator for the identification of sphincter muscle.<br>
Sometime babies are born without a normal anal orifice. The operation done for the correction of this anomaly is called Posterior Sagittal Anorectoplasty. In this operation the blind ending rectum is opened and re-located at the proposed site of the anul verge. The whole operation requires very precise definition of the anatomy so that the body can control the passage of stools at will. This can. only be achieved if this muscle which control the passage of stool are identical with precision and which is a very difficult job.<br>
The main disadvantages is that the operation is done on the basis of Pre-sumptions/guess and therefore such operation are not always successful.<br>
Therefore, the main object of this invention is to propose a muscle stimulator to identify the muscles which control the passage of stool.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a muscle stimulator characterized in that is a transformer, voltage selector, diodes, a capacitor, an I.C., a voltage selector switch and a pair of sensors wherein transformer provided for low voltage required to operate the muscle stimulator, the output terminals of said transformer connected to the input terminals of a voltage selector having lower and upper terminal; diodes being connected between the upper terminals of first, second and third contact and also between lower terminal of first, second and third terminal, a capacitor being connected between the lower terminals of fourth and fifth contacts, an I.C. is connected to the lower terminals of sixth, seventh and eighth contacts, a voltage selector switch is connected to the upper terminals of the sixth and seventh contacts, a pair of sensors being connected to the common points of I.C. and the upper terminal of the seventh contacts and to the common point of the capacitor and lower terminal of fourth contact, so as to identify sphincter muscle of the anus.<br>
In accordance with this invention the muscle stimulator has a transformer adapted to be connected to the A.C mains supply. The output terminals of the transformer are connected to a voltage/current selector through an on-off switch such that to select the current to supply to a pair of sensors provided to sense/identify the sphincter muscles of the anus. A control switch is provided with the selector to select the desired voltage/current to be supplied to the pair of sensors. The current to be supplied to the sensors is between 50 to 280 ma and the voltage is between 15 to 20 volts. An indicator is connected to the selector to indicate the working of the selector.<br>
A muscle stimulator according to a  preferred embodimentof this invention herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:-<br>
Fig.l  shows circuit diagram  of the muscle stimulator.<br>
Referring to the drawings the muscle stimuJator of the present invention  comprises a step-down transformer 1 adapted to be connected with the main power supply to provide the low voltage supply as required by operating the muscle stimulator. The output terminals 2 &amp; 3  of the transformer 1 are connected to the input  terminals 4 &amp; 5  of a voltage/current selected device 6 provided for selecting the voltage supply to be supplied to the sensors 7 provided with said voltage selected device for identifying the  sphincter muscles of the anus  which  controlls the passes of stools.  An on/off switch 8 is provided between the transformer and voltage selector to switch on/switch off the voltage supply to the voltage selected device.   The voltage selected device 6 comprises a plurality of pair of contacts 9 having upper/lower terminals inter-connected with each other. Diodes 10 are connected between  the upper terminals of first<br>
and second contacts and upper terminal of fifth contact. Similarly<br>
diodes 11 are connected between lower terminal of first and second<br>
contacts and lower terminal of  fourth conntact.   Diodes are provided for converting A,C.current to D.C. current.A capacitor 12 is provided between the  lower terminals of fourth and fifth contacts.  The capacitor is  provided to control the voltage flectuation during the operation of the  device.    Sensors 7<br>
are connected to the common point of the capacitor 12 of lower terminal of the fourth contact and to the common point of the l.C. The sensors 7 are placed together for touching the same to the muscle of the fifth anus for the identification of sphincter muscles. The l.C. 13 is connected to the lower terminal of the contacts sixth, seventh and eighth. The lower terminals of the contacts 5th and 81h are interconnected with each other. The lower terminal of the contact 9 is connected to the earth. A selector switch 14 is connected between the upper terminals of the 6th and 7th contacts. The selected switch is provided to select the voltage/current to be supplied to the sensors 7. An indicator 15 is connected with the common point of the capacitor 12 of the lower terminal of the 5lh contact.<br>
During the operation of the device, the switch 8 is kept in the on position and the voltage to be supplied to the sensors 7 is selected with the help of selector switch 14 and the sensors are touched to the muscles to identify the sphincter muscles in order to open the rectorn in the middle so as to control the passage of stools at will.<br>
The voltage/current selector of this invention has a plurality of pair of contacts for example 9 as shown in Fig. 1. The upper terminals of the output contacts are connected to the output terminals of the transformer. A pair of diode is connected with the upper terminals of the contacts to which the transformer is connected. The terminals of the diodes,<br>
 are connected  to the upper terminal of the  fifth pair of contacts.<br>
Similarly another  pair of diodes is connected to the other lower terminals of the input contacts. The other terminals of the diodes are connected to one lower terminal of the fourth pair of contacts.  A capacitor is connected between fourth and fifth contacts.  An indicator is connected to the lower terminals of  the fifth contacts.  An integrated circuit (I.C) is connected to lower terminals of 6th, 7th and 8th contacts.  A selector switch is connected to the upper terminals of 6th and 7th contacts. A pair of sensors is connected to the common point of the I.C. and upper terminal of the 7th pair of contacts and the common point of the capacitor and lower terminal  of 4th  contact A selector switch is connected between the upper terminals of 6th and 7th contacts.  The switch is provided to control the output voltage/current to be supplied to  the sensors.<br><br><br><br><br>
