 APPARATUS TO PERFORM FILE<br>
MANAGEMENT"<br>
INTEL CORPORATION, &amp; company incorporated in the State of Delaware, United States of America, of 2200 Mission College Boulevard, Santa Clara, California 95052, United States of America,<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
12/7/2006<br><br>
FIELD<br>
This disclosure relates to computer and communication systems. More particularly, it relates to methods and apparatus to improve file management within a computer and communication system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Computer and communications systems are frequently similar in architecture. Each system may comprise a number of separate components each designed to perform certain functions. The components may communicate information to other components over an interconnect system. An interconnect system operates to manage the transfer of information over a communications medium, such as metal leads, twisted-pair wire, coÂ¬axial cable, fiber optics, radio frequencies and so forth. Communications between components typically help coordinate operations of the individual components so that they may act as a cohesive system. This type of distributed system architecture may provide certain advantages in terms of performance, redundancy, scalability and efficiency.<br>
There are disadvantages, however, associated with this type of system design. One disadvantage is that a component may have to remain idle as it waits for information from another component. Idle time may represent an inefficient use of system resources. Another disadvantage is that functionality may be allocated to components in a manner that increases the amount of information communicated between components. This<br><br>
increase in communications increases demands on the finite resources of the interconnect system.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The subject matter regarded as embodiments of the invention is particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the concluding portion of the specification. Embodiments of the invention, however, both as to organization and method of operation, together with objects, features, and advantages thereof, may best be understood by reference to the following detailed description when read with the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a system suitable for practicing one embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a client system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a server system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block flow diagram of operations performed by a client system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block flow diagram of operations performed by a server system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a software architecture in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It will be<br><br>
understood by those skilled in the art, however, that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the embodiments of the invention.<br>
Embodiments of the invention may improve performance of a distributed system by reducing idle time for distributed components as well as bandwidth demands for the interconnect system. More particularly, one embodiment of the invention may improve performance of a distributed system used for file management. Consequently, this may reduce delays associated with file operations. Accordingly, a user may benefit in terms of more responsive applications and services.<br>
A file management system typically comprises a client and a server. A client in this context may refer to a requestor of services. A server in this context may refer to a provider of services. The client typically sends a file request to a server over an interconnect system. The file request may be in the form of a message, and may include a function request and a file name. A message in this context may comprise one or more alphanumeric characters, symbols or logical expressions that when combined represent, for example, control words, commands, instructions, information or data. The message could vary in composition from a single bit to entire phrases, for example. The server associates a unique identifier with the file name, identifies location information for the file, and stores it with the unique identifier. The server then sends the unique identifier back to the client. The client receives the unique identifier and uses it in lieu of the file name for subsequent file requests.<br>
A unique identifier is assigned to a file name to reduce bandwidth demands on the interconnect systems. A file name may comprise a number of alphanumeric characters or symbols ("character string"), for example. Each character or symbol is converted to one<br><br>
or more bits, typically with 8 bits (e.g., 1 byte) per character. Since a file name mo, comprise many characters, the interconnect system may have to transport a relatively large number of bits. To reduce this problem, the server may assign a unique identifier to each file name and sends the unique identifier to the client. The unique identifier is typically smaller in length than the file name. For example, a unique identifier may have a length of 32 or 64 bits. The client may then use the unique identifier for subsequent file requests.<br>
There are disadvantages, however, to having the server assign a unique identifier to a file name. One disadvantage is that the client may have to remain idle as it waits for the unique identifier prior to processing subsequent file request. Another disadvantage is that the client and server may need to communicate more information than necessary, thereby increasing demands on the interconnect system.<br>
With respect to the first disadvantage, the client may have to remain idle as it waits for the unique identifier from the serveT. To initiate the assignment process, the client sends a message to the server requesting assignment rjfp unique identifier to a. filf~ name. The server associates a unique identifier with the file name, identifies location information for the file, and stores it with the unique identifier. The server then sends a message with the unique identifier back to the client. â  While waiting to receive the unique identifier from the server, the client may receive subsequent file requests with the same file name. The client may not be able to begin processing these file requests until the entire assignment process is completed. As a result, the client may be forced to remain idle during this time- -period.<br>
With respect to the second disadvantage, the client and server may need to communicate unnecessary information to perforin the assignment function, thereby increasing demands on the interconnect system. A file management system as described above requires at least two messages. The client sends a first message to the server<br><br>
requesting assignment of a unique identifier to a file riame. The server sends a second message to the client with the unique identifier. Each message requires use of a certain amount of bandwidth from the interconnect system. Bandwidth in this context may refer to the speed at which information can be transferred over an interconnect system, and is typically measured in kilobits per second (kbps). By way of contrast, one embodiment of the invention may perform the assignment process using only one message, thereby potentially reducing bandwidth demands on the interconnect system by as much as 50%. Embodiments of the invention may improve performance of a distributed system by reducing idie time for a client as well as bandwidth demands for the interconnect system. One embodiment of the invention assigns a unique identifier to a file name at the client, and sends the unique identifier to the server. This may reduce client idle time since the client may begin processing subsequent file requests without having to wait for a message from the server. This may also reduce bandwidth demands since the server does not need to send a message back to the server to complete the assignment process, or alternatively, may send a message that is shorter than those needed by previous file management systems.<br>
It is worthy to note that any reference in the specification to "one embodiment" or "an embodiment" means in this context that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment may be included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase "in one embodiment" in various places in the specification do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment.<br>
Referring now in detail to the drawings wherein like parts are designated by like reference numerals throughout, there is illustrated in FIG. 1 a system 100 suitable for practicing one embodiment of the invention. As shown in FIG. 1, system 100 comprises a client 102 and a server 106 connected by an interconnect system 104. The term "clienf as<br><br>
used herein may refer to any requestor of information. The term "server" as used herein may refer to any provider of information.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a client system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2 illustrates a client 200 that may be representative of client 102. As shown in FIG. 2, client 200 comprises a processor 202, a memory 204 and an interface 208, all connected by connection 210. Memory 204 may store program instructions and data. The term "program instructions" include computer code segments comprising words, values and symbols from a predefined computer language that, when placed in combination according to a predefined manner or syntax, cause a processor to perform a certain function. Examples of a computer language include C, C++ and assembly. Processor 202 executes the program instructions, and processes the data, stored in memory 204. Interface 208 coordinates the transport of data from client 200 to another device. Connection 210 transports data between processor 202, memory 204, and interface 208.<br>
Processor 202 can be any type of processor capable of providing the speed and functionality desirable for various embodiments of the invention. For example, processor 202 could be a processor from a family of processors made by Intel Corporation, Motorola, Compaq or Sun Microsystems. In one embodiment of the invention, processor 202 may be a dedicated processor to manage input/output (I/O) devices, such as hard drives, keyboards, printers, network interface cards and so forth. This processor is typically referred to as an I/O processor (IOP).<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, memory 204 comprises a machine-readable medium and may include any medium capable of storing instructions adapted to be executed by a processor. Some examples of such media include, but are not limited to, read-only memory (ROM), random-access memory (RAM), programmable ROM, erasable programmable ROM, electronically erasable programmable ROM, dynamic<br><br>
RAM, magnetic disk (e.g., floppy disk and hard drive), optical disk (e.g., CD-ROM) and any other media that may store digital information. In one embodiment of the invention, the instructions are stored on the medium in a compressed and/or encrypted format. As used herein, the phrase "adapted to be executed by a processor" is meant to encompass instructions stored in a compressed and/or encrypted format,- as well as instructions that have to be compiled or installed by an installer before being executed by the processor. Further, client 200 may contain various combinations of machine-readable storage devices through various I/O controllers, which are accessible by processor 202 and which are capable of storing a combination of computer program instructions and data.<br>
Memory 204 may store and allow execution by processor 202 of program instructions and data to implement the functions of a client, such as client 106 and client 200. In one embodiment of the invention, memory 204 includes a set of program instructions that will be collectively referred to herein as a file system interface 206.<br>
File system interface 206 may be an interface that operates to provide access to one or more files for system 100. An interface in this context may refer to a defined protocol by which one software module may access ftmctionality from another software module. A file in this context refers to a discrete set of data stored in memory, such as in memory 204 or a hard drive. File system interface 206 may receive a request to perform certain operations for a file, such as create, open; seek, read, write, rename, delete, copy, move, and so forth. The request may originate from a host OS or an application program, for example. A host OS may comprise an OS for a system. For example, if an embodiment of the invention was implemented as part of a personal computer, the host OS might comprise an OS sold by Microsoft Corporation, such as Microsoft WindowsÂ® 95, 98, 2000 and NT, for example.<br><br>
In one embodiment of the invention file system interface 206 operates as an Operating System Service Module (OSM) as defined by the Intelligent I/O Specification (I20) developed by the I20 Special Interest Group (SIG) (I20 SIG), version 1.5, adopted in April of 1997, and available from "www.J2Qsig.org" ("I20 Specification"), although the invention is not limited in scope in this respect.<br>
By way of background, the hO Specification defines a standard architecture for intelligent I/O that is independent of both the specific device being controlled and the host operating system (OS). Intelligent I/O in this context refers to moving the function of processing low-level interrupts from a central processing unit (CPU) or other processor to I/O processors (IOPs) designed specifically to provide processing for I/O functions. This may improve I/O performance as well as permit the CPU or other processor to provide processing functionality for other tasks. An interrupt in this context refers to a request to access an I/O device, such as a hard drive, floppy disk drive, printer, monitor, keyboard, network interface card (NIC) and so forth.<br>
The I2O Specification describes an OSM, an Intermediate Services Module (ISM) and a Hardware Device Module (HDM). The OSM may be a driver that operates as an interface between a host OS and an ISM. A driver in this context refers to a set of program instructions that manage operations of a particular component, device or software module. The ISM may operate as an interface between the OSM and a Hardware Device Module (HDM). The ISM may perform specific functionality for I/O management functions, network protocols or peer-to-peer functionality such as background archiving, for example. The HDM may be a driver that operates to control a particular I/O device.<br>
The I20 Specification defines a communications model that comprises a message-passing system. The OSM, ISM and HDM communicate and coordinate operations by passing information in the form of messages through a message layer. A message layer in<br><br>
this context may manage and dispatch requests, provide a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for delivering messages, and provide a set of support routines to process messages.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, file system interface 206 operates as an OSM in accordance with the I2O Specification. In one embodiment of the invention, file system interface 206 receives file requests from an application program via the host OS, translates the request into a message in accordance with the I2O Specification, and sends it to a file system manager (described below) for processing. An application program in this context refers to a program that provides a predetermined set of functions for specialized tasks, typically having a user interface to facilitate the processing of commands and instructions between a user and the computer system. Examples of application programs might include a word processor, spread sheet, database or Internet browser.<br>
Interface 208 may comprise any suitable technique for controlling communication signals between computer or network devices using a desired set of communications protocols, services and operating procedures, for example. In one embodiment of the invention, interface 208 may operate, for example, in accordance with the PCI Specification and the I2O Specification. In another embodiment of the invention, interface 208 may operate in accordance with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard 7, Request For Comment (RFC) 793, adopted in September, 1981, and the Internet Protocol (IP) as defined by the IETF standard 5, RFC 791, adopted in September, 1981, both available from "www.ietf.org." Although interface 208 may operate with in accordance with the above described protocols, it can be appreciated that interface 208 may operate with any suitable technique for controlling communication signals between computer or network devices using a<br><br><br>
desired set of communications protocols, services and operating procedures, for example,<br>
and still fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
Interface 208 also includes connectors for connecting interface 208 with a suitable<br>
communications medium. Interface 208 may receive communication signals over any<br>
suitable medium such as copper leads, twisted-pair wire, co-axial cable, fiber optics, radio<br>
frequencies, and so forth. In one embodiment of the invention, the connectors are suitable<br>
for use with a bus to carry signals that comply with the PCI Specification.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a server system in accordance with one embodiment<br>
of the invention. FIG. 3 illustrates a server 300 that is representative of server 106, in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the invention. As shown in FIG. 3, server 300<br>
comprises a processor 302, a memory 304 and an interface 308, all connected by<br>
connection 310. Elements 302, 304, 308 and 310 of FIG. 3 are similar in structure and<br>
operation as corresponding elements 202,204,208 and 210 described with reference to<br>
FIG. 2. Although server 300 is shown with a processor 302, it can be appreciated that<br>
server 300 may operate without processor 302 by using another processor available to<br>
server 300 (e.g., processor 202), and still fall within the scope of the invention. For<br>
example, such a configuration may occur if the embodiments of the invention were<br>
incorporated into a personal computer where the client and server were connected by a<br>
PCI bus and both shared a single processor.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, memory 304 contains program instructions<br>
for a file system manager 306. File system manager 306 performs file management and<br>
provides access to a storage medium (not shown) containing a plurality of files. File<br>
system 306 performs file operations such as create, open, seek, read, write, rename, delete,<br>
copy, move, and so forth, in response to file requests received from file system interface<br>
206. One example of file system interface 206 includes an ISM operating in accordance<br><br>
with the I20 Specification, although the scope of the invention is not limited in this respect.<br>
The operation of systems 100, 200 and 300 will be described in more detail with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5.  Although FIGS. 4 and 5 presented herein include a particular sequence of operations, it can be appreciated that the sequence of operations merely provides an example of how the general functionality described herein may be implemented. Further, the sequence of operations does not necessarily have to be executed in the order presented unless otherwise indicated.<br>
FIG, 4 is a block flow diagram of the operations performed by a client in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment of the invention, file system interface 206 operates as part of client 106. It can be appreciated that file system interface 206, however, can be implemented by any device, or combination of devices, located anywhere in a computer or network system and still fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, a client receives a request to access a file having a file name at block 402. The client associates the file name with an identifier at block 404. The client sends the associated identifier and file name to a server at block 406. The client stores the associated identifier and file name in memory at block 408. The client receives an acknowledgement message from the server at block 410.<br>
Once the client assigns an identifier to a file, the identifier is used for future requests for the file. The client receives a second request at the client to access the file. The client retrieves the identifier associated with the file name from memory. The client sends the second request to the server using the associated identifier.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block flow diagram of the operations performed by a server in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment of the invention,<br><br>
file system manager 306 operates as part of client 106. It can be appreciated that this functionality, however, can be implemented by any device, or combination of devices, located anywhere in a computer or network system and still fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, a server receives a file name and associated identifier for a file at block 502. The server sends an acknowledgement message to the client at block 504. The server searches for location information for the file at block 506. The server associates the location information with the identifier at block 508. The server stores the associated location information and identifier in memory.<br>
Once the server indexes the location information for a file using the identifier, the server can use the identifier to access the location information for subsequent file requests. The server receives a second request to access the file having the identifier. The server retrieves the location information from memory using the identifier.<br>
The operation of systems 100, 200. and 300, and the flow diagrams shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, may be better understood by way of example. An application program sends a request to read information from a file with a file name "test file one" to the host OS of system 100. A unique identifier in this context refers to a series of alphanumeric characters that when combined represent a unique word, value or binary string to the client, server and/or system with respect to other words, values or binary strings used by the client, server and/or system. The host OS passes the file request to file system interface 206. File system interface 206 generates a unique identifier "A123" and assigns it to file name "test file one." In this embodiment of the invention, the unique identifier "A123" may be a hexidecimal 32 bit number, for example. File system interface 206 creates a message "identify (test file one, A123)," and places it in an outbound message queue for transport over connection 104 to file system manager 306. The outbound<br><br>
message queue in this context refers to a queue such as first-in-first-out (FIFO) that is used to hold messages until the interconnect system can transport the message. File system interface 206 stores "test file one" with "A123" in a lookup table in memory 204.<br>
File system manager 306 receives the message over connection 104. File system manager 306 parses the message and invokes the function "identify (test file one, A123)." The term parses in this context refers to separating individual characters or sub-sets of characters from the message that represent, for example, commands, control words, file names, data, function calls, sub-routine names, flags and so forth. The term "invokes" in this context refers to a command sent to the processor to begin executing program instructions associated with a given function or sub-routine. This function takes as inputs "test file one" and "A123," and informs file system manager 306 that the file name "test file one" will be referenced in subsequent file requests as "A 123." This may be accomplished by updating a lookup table in memory by storing the file name and unique identifier together as corresponding or linked terms, that is, one may be found by searching for the other. File system manager 306 searches for location information for file "A123," which is typically located on a storage device such as a hard drive. Examples of location information may include addressing information, device, cylinder number and track number, although the invention is not limited in scope in this respect. File system manager 306 associates the location information with identifier "A123," and stores the location information with identifier "A123" in a lookup table in memory 304. File system manager 306 sends an acknowledgement message to file system interface 206 that the file name identifier and location information have been received. An acknowledgement message in this context refers to a short message indicating that a previous message was received. The acknowledgement message may comprise a single bit, character, word or phrase, as desired by a particular system.<br><br>
Subsequent file requests received by file system manager 306 will then use identifier "A123" when requesting operations for file name "test file one." For example, file system interface 206 receives a second request to perform a "delete" operation for "test file one." File system interface 206 retrieves the previously associated identifier i     "A123" for "test file one" from memory. File system interface 206 sends a message "delete('A123')" to file system manager 306. File system manager 306 receives the message "delete('A123')" and retrieves the location information for file name "test file one" using the identifier "A123." File system manager 306 then performs the requested file operation using the retrieved location information.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, file system interface 206 may be implementec as an OSM in accordance with the I20 Specification and a particular host OS, such as the Linux OS version 2.3.99 pre-3 kernel available from "www.kernel.org" ("Linux Kernel"). In this embodiment of the invention, the OSM may further comprise a stream forest OSM, a stream tree OSM, and a class specification. A class in this context may refer to a specific interface definition. A tree in this context may refer to a collection of storage objects called cones. An object in this context may refer to an instance of a class. A cone in this context may refer to a storage object that supports read, write and lock capabilities, for example. A forest in this context may refer to a collection of trees.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention, the stream forest OSM may be used to model a collection of file systems. The stream forest OSM may provide file naming operations, such as creating a name, erasing a name, or renaming a particular forest, for example. Further, open and close operations may also be supported. The tree OSM may be used to model a particular file system. A file may be modeled as a cone. The stream forest OSM may also function to support file operations, such as to name a file, rename it, erase it, lock it from change, read it or write it, for example.<br><br>
The OSM may be designed to communicate with an ISM. The ISM may further comprise a stream forest ISM and a stream tree ISM. The stream forest ISM may support the file system naming capability of the OSM.  In one embodiment of the invention, the stream tree ISM may support stream cone identifiers with lengths of 2s characters. The stream tree ISM may also support 216 open stream cones, as well as 232 possible stream cones. The tree ISM may support 2M bytes for all contained stream cones. It can be appreciated that these values do not limit the scope of the invention in this respect.<br>
In operation, the stream tree OSM, stream forest OSM, stream tree ISM and stream forest ISM may all communicate using a messaging scheme in accordance with a class specification as discussed below. This messaging scheme will be referred to as a streaming messaging scheme, and will be discussed in further detail below. A host OS may use the functionality provided by the stream forest OSM and stream tree OSM. The host OS may use the stream forest OSM to model a grouping of file systems, and the stream tree OSM to model a particular file system, for example. The stream forest OSM may use the stream forest ISM to manage groupings of file systems within an IRTOS environment. The stream tree OSM may use the stream tree ISM to manage a file system within an I2O Real-Time Operating System (IRTOS) environment. The stream forest OSM and stream tree OSM may communicate with the stream forest OSM and stream tree ISM, respectively, using the stream messaging scheme. This embodiment of the invention will be further described with reference to FIG. 7.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a software architecture in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. As shown in FIG. 6, a system 600 may comprise a file system interface having a stream forest OSM 602, a Linux OS 604, a Linux Virtual File System (VFS) 606, a stream tree OSM 608, and one or more Linux I20 drivers 610. Linux I2O drivers 610 may operate in accordance with the Linux Kernel and the I20 Specification. Linux I2O drivers<br><br>
610 may include PCI I20 drivers 612. PCI 120 drivers 612 may operate in accordance with the PCI Specification and the I20 Specification.<br>
The file system interface communicates with a file system manager over a bus 614 that communicates signals in accordance with the PCI Specification. The file system manager may comprise a stream forest ISM 616, a stream tree ISM 618, a Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) ISM 620, a Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) HDM 622 and IRTOS 624.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention, the modules shown in system 600 may be implemented using the C programming language, although the scope of the invention is not limited in this respect. Further, in this embodiment of the invention modules shown in system 600 support identifiers having a length of 255 characters.<br>
Stream tree OSM 608 may be configured to provide access to a typical file system. Stream tree OSM 608 may be configured to support one or more Linux VFS required functions, as defined by the Linux Specification. Stream tree OSM 608 may be configured to support stream tree class messages, as discussed in more detail below. Stream tree OSM 608 may be configured to operate with Linux OS 604 using, for example, the Linux Kernel. Stream tree OSM 608 may support a stream tree ISM, such as stream tree ISM 618.<br>
Stream forest OSM 602 may provide the function loctlO kerne] interface. Stream forest OSM 602 may function to create a stream tree within a stream forest, using a function name such as "IOCTL_SF_TREECREATE." This function may accept as inputs, for example, an input buffer defined in the C language as follows:<br>
struct ik_sf_treecreate {<br>
U32     SizelnBlocks;<br>
char    name[256]; <br><br><br>
Stream forest OSM 602 may also function to rename an existing stream tree, using a function name such as "IOCTL_SB_TREERENAME." This function may accept as inputs, for example, an input buffer defined in the C language as follows:<br>
struct ik_sf_treerename {<br>
char    IdentifierBeforeRename [256];<br>
char    IdentifierAfterRenarne [256]; }â¢<br>
Stream forest OSM 602 may also function to erase an existing stream tree, using a function name such as "IOCTL_SF_TREEERASE." This function may accept as inputs,, for example, an input buffer defined in the C language as follows:<br>
struct ik_sf_treeerase {<br>
char    IdentifierToErase[256];<br><br>
Stream forest OSM 602 may use one or more of the following data structures. A data structure referred to herein as a "super block" may be used to represent the initial "inode" of a file system. An "inode" in this context may refer to a file node of the file system.   A super block operation list may be a grouping of functions used to manipulate the super block. An inode record data structure may be used to represent each file node of the file system. An inode operation list may be a grouping of functions used to manipulate an inode. A file record data structure may be used to represent an abstract file within a file system. A file operation list may be used to support file operations. All of these data structures combined with operation list operations may be used to represent a file system.<br><br><br>
Stream tree class messages may be issued for several of the data structures. A stream tree class message may be issued, for example, for the inode operations create, lookup, make directory ("mkdir"), remove directory ("rmdir"), and rename directory. A stream tree class message may be issued for various file operations, such as open, read, write, seek, and close.<br>
Stream forest OSM 602 may register the contained file system with the identifier "i2ofs," for example, within the Linux kernel. Stream forest OSM 602 may use the NULL identifier for the root tree cone container, for example. Stream forest OSM 602 may use the identifier '.' for the current tree cone container, for example. Stream forest OSM 602 may use the identifier '..' for the parent tree cone container, for example.<br>
