				<td>Glucose based time-temperature indicator to access thermal processing of foods.<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The   invention   relates   to   the   development   of  glucose   based   time-temperature indicator to assess thermal (retort) processing of foods.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Thermal processing of foods is one of the most acceptable and successfully stablished means of food preservation. Optimization of heat treatment is considered as a most important critical control point to achieve desired shelf life as well as to ensure the microbial safety particularly after inactivation/killing of Clostridium botulinum by adopting '12D' reduction during thermal (retort) processing of ready-to-eat foods. Several methods for thermal process design and calculation have been developed mainly on the basis of three logical approaches namely physical-mathematical procedure, bio-indicators and chemical markers (of both intrinsic and extrinsic).<br>
Despite extensive work that has been reported on the evaluation of physical-mathematical methods, it still remains mainly as empirical and knowledge as it has numerous approximations, perhaps which seem to be the limiting factors for the application of these methods (Nikolas et al., 1997. Crit. Rev. Food Sci 85 Nutr. 37(5) 411-441).<br>
Sastry et al., (1988) reported that inoculum pack study of microorganisms/spores may be used as bio-indicator for process verification (Sastry et al., 1988. J Food Sci. 53(5) 1528-1530). However, analysis of microorganism usually takes long lag period of two to ten days and thus can not be used for immediate evaluation of process conditions.<br>
 <br>
Degradation of chemical constituents of food during cooking and sterilization  is  temperature  dependent as  in  the  case  of other pure chemical reactions. A few reactions of this kind are suitable to use as time-temperature indicators (TTI) /intrinsic chemical markers.<br>
The loss in thiamin content, vitamin C and degradation of natural food colour pigments such as anthocyanin during processing are reported as intrinsic chemical markers (Kim et al. 1993. Food Technol., 47 (1), 91-99). Maillard reaction products (MRPs) formed in the food during sterilization temperature is reported as potential intrinsic chemical markers (Wnorowski et al, 2002. J Food Sci., 67(6) 2149-2152). However the quantification and correlation with process lethality is not completely established.<br>
Us Patent (Patent No. 1,668,767) discloses the application of extrinsic chemical marker to identify whether the cans filled with food is exposed to adequate processing temperature. The filled cans are marked with organic colour, which undergoes colour change at 212째F (102.6째C). The organic colour consists of erythrocine, shellac (binder) and grain alcohol (solvent). Since, the temperature requirement for thermal (retort) processing of foods is 250째F (121.1째C), this system can not be used.<br>
In another case, hydrolysis of p-Nitrophenyl-D-Glucopyranoside (NPG) in borate buffer (pH 11) was investigated as a potential extrinsic chemical marker. Adams and Langley (1998) reported that glucose formed during hydrolysis further undergoes caramalization and these colored pigments may interfere with colour measurement of NPG reaction. Therefore, the colour values can not be correlated with exact holding time and process temperature (Adams and Langley, 1998, Food Chemistry, 62(1) 65-68).<br>
Acid hydrolysis of sucrose as a potential non-intrusive chemical time-temperature indicator (TTI) for assessing holding temperature during continuous thermal processes was investigated (Pinheiro Torres, a and<br>
 <br>
Oliveira, FAR Journal of Food Engineering, 1999, 40(3) 181-188). A TTI kinetic model was developed by combining a firs t order reaction and an Arrhenius type equation. TTI experiments were performed in a pilot plant continuous thermal processing system with circulating nitric acid as solvent. Experiments were performed at a temperature range of 70-86C with a holding time of 5 minutes. It was found that reaction rate increased exponentially with H concentration. Hence, the acid concentration was varied intentionally from pH 0.8 to 1.5 to study the suitability of the reaction at lower pH. It is concluded that acid hydrolysis of sucrose can be successfully applied to assess the holding temperature in continuous thermal processing. However, a large number of samples are necessary to obtain reliable results as well as to reduce standard error in a wide range of pH.<br>
The commercial chemical indicator available in the market is operable on pH basis to signal the attainment of one pre-selected value corresponding to an integral of system temperature and holding time. Although the system permits the visual inspection of the color, the indicator ink associated with the colour change of the product is very small and difficult to monitor. Since the colour change of the system is associated with one pre-selected value of temperature and holding time this cannot be used for food sterilization purpose in which the increase of time and temperature is progressive (US Patent 3,942,467).<br>
Therefore, development of a simple and cost effective chemical time-temperature indicator for a wide range of temperature and pH in food processing in continue to be a challenge and an active research (Hendrickx et al., 1995. Crit. Rev. Food Sci 8B Nutri. 35(3), 231-265).<br>
No information on glucose based time-temperature indicator system under alkaline condition for the application of thermal (retort) processing of foods is available.<br>
 <br>
The present claims relates to development of a simple and cost effective glucose based time-temperature indicator system under alkaline condition for real monitoring / validating the thermal (retort) process conditions.<br>
Objects of Invention<br>
The main object of this invention is to develop a simple and cost effective glucose based time temperature indicator system to access thermal processing of foods.<br>
Other object is to develop a simple glucose based time temperature indicator system under alkaline Condition for real monitoring /validating the thermal process conditions.<br>
Another object is to develop a glucose based time-temperature indicator to access thermal processing for different commercial sterility value.<br>
Yet another object is to develop a glucose based time-temperature indicator system to access thermal processing of foods wherein the change in colour of the aliquot can be measured immediately after processing which ensures the adequacy of the processing temperature and time without any time lag as in other method.<br>
Further object of this invention is to develop a system, which can be adopted easily by the industry for large scale production of thermal processed foods.<br>
Statement of Invention<br>
This invention relates to A glucose based time temperature indicator system both in liquid and solid forms to assess thermal processing of food comprising of glucose and disodium hydrogen phosphate solution with a pre-set pH value 6.0-9.5.<br>
 <br>
Detailed description of Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention describes a simple and cost effective glucose based time-temperature indicator system comprises: glucose dissolved in disodium hydrogen phosphate solution with pre-set pH value and packed in sterilizeable packaging materials such as glass vial and /or flexible packaging materials is exposed to a range of commercial sterility value (FQ-value) corresponding to an integral of process temperature and holding time forms brown colour from colourless for adequate sterilization and pate yellow from colourless for inadequate sterilization due to complex browning reaction.<br>
The glucose based time-temperature indicator system, which comprises (1) glucose was dissolved in 2N disodium hydrogen phosphate solution with pre-set pH value; (2) the aliquot thus formed was kept in liquid form (as such); and (3) in solid form (strips) after incorporation with water soluble Poly Vinyl Alcohol (PVA); (4) the liquid form was packed in glass vials and solid form (strips) was packed in 75 micron thick pre-fabricated polypropylene (PP) film pouches of size 2.5 cm X 5.0 cm); (5) one set of liquid form packed in glass vials and solid form (strips) packed in PP pouches were kept at geometric centre of the retort; (6) an another set of liquid form packed in glass vials and solid form (strips) packed in PP pouches were kept individually inside the food packed in cans/retortable pouches; (7) the cans/retortable pouches containing aliquot in liquid and solid forms were placed at different locations inside the retort apart from keeping one set at the geometric center of the retort; (8) both were subjected to thermal (retort) processing for different commercial sterility value (F0-value) of 0 to 8 as per guidelines described in 21 CFR part 113; (9) after thermal (retort) processing, liquid form was tested for colour development by means of optical density measurement at 420nm and the solid form (strips) was tested for colour indices such as " L" (whit) and " a" (red) values at different F0-values; (10) the values<br>
 <br>
optical density for liquid form and colour indices for solid form (strips) were found consistent with commercial sterility value (F0-value). Hence, both systems as per processors choice can be used to assess commercial sterility value (F0-value) during thermal (retort) processing of foods.<br>
One embodiment of the invention provides a process; wherein in step (1) glucose was dissolved in disodium hydrogen phosphate solution with pre-set pH value.<br>
Another embodiment, (2) the aliquot thus formed was kept in liquid form (as such); and (3) in solid form (strips) after incorporation with water soluble Poly Vinyl Alcohol (PVA).<br>
Yet another embodiment, in step (4) the liquid form was packed in glass vials and solid form (strip) was packed in pre-fabricated polypropylene (PP) film pouches.<br>
Yet another embodiment, in step (5) one set of liquid form packed in glass vials and solid form (strips) packed in PP pouches were kept at geometric centre of the retort;<br>
Yet another embodiment, in step (6) an another set of liquid form packed in glass vials and solid form (strips) packed in PP pouches were kept individually inside the food packed in cans/retortable pouches;<br>
Yet another embodiment, in step (7) the cans/retortable pouches containing aliquot in liquid and solid form were placed at different locations inside the retort apart from keeping one set at the geometric center of the retort;<br>
Yet another embodiment, in step (8) both were subjected to thermal (retort) processing for different commercial sterility value (F0-value) of 0 to 8 as per standard procedure;<br>
 <br>
Yet another embodiment, in step (9) after thermal (retort) processing, liquid form was tested for colour development by means of optical density measurement at 420nm and the solid form (strip) was tested for colour indices such as " L" (white) and "a" (red) values at different F-values;<br>
One more embodiment, the values optical density for liquid form and colour indices for solid form (strips) were found consistent with commercial sterility value (F0-value). Hence, both systems as per processors choice can be used to assess commercial sterility value (Fo-value) during thermal (retort) processing of foods.<br>
Both systems as per processors choice can be used to assess commercial sterility value (F0-value) during thermal (retort) processing of foods.<br>
The novelty of the process lies in the dissolution of 0.1 to 0.4grams of glucose in 50 to 100 ml of 2N disodium hydrogen phosphate solution With a pre-set pH value in the range of 6.0 to 9.5. The resultant aliquot was kept in liquid form (as such) and in solid form (strips) after incorporation with water soluble Poly Vinyl Alcohol (PVA). A known volume say 5-10 ml of the aliquot was packed in glass vials and solid form (strips) was packed in pre-fabricated polypropylene (PP) pouches. One set in glass vials and strips packed in PP pouches were kept at geometric centre of the retort and another set of glass vials and strip packed in PP pouches were kept inside the food packed in cans/retortable pouches. On thermal (retort) processing to achieve commercial sterility value (F0-value) of 0 to 8 at a temperature range of 110째C to 121.1째C, the aliquot under goes complex caramelization reaction under alkaline condition and forms typical brown colour resineous substance. The colour intensity (optical density) can be measured which is found to have direct correlation with process<br>
 <br>
temperature, holding time as well as F0-value. The change in colour of the aliquot can be measured immediately after processing and ensure the adequacy of the processing temperature and time without any time lag as in other methods of confirmation. The system is simple, inexpensive and can be adopted easily by the industry for large-scale production of thermal (retort) processed foods.<br>
The applicability of the system is further illustrated in the following examples. However, this should not be construed to limit the present invention.<br>
Example (liquid form of the aliquot (as such): Glucose solution preparation:<br>
0.25 gram of glucose was dissolved in 100 ml of 2N Disodium hydrogen phosphate solution with a pre-set pH value of 7.5 and packed in sterilizeable packaging materials such as glass vial or pre-fabricated polypropylene (PP) pouches of capacity 5-10 ml.<br>
Thermal processing:<br>
The chemical indicator solution tube was kept at geometric centre of the retort as well as inside the food packed in can/retortable pouches and placed at different locations inside the retort. Thermal process was carried out as per standard procedure to achieve a commercial sterility value of maximum 6.0. After the completion of processing, the change in colour of the aliquot was checked and found the development of brown colour from colour less due to caramelization reaction under alkaline condition.<br>
<br>
