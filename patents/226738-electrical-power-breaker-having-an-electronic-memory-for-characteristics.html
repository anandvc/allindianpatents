				<td>Description<br>
Electrical power breaker having an electronic memory<br>
for characteristics and conversion factors<br>
The invention relates to an electrical power breaker<br>
having an electronic protective device and having an<br>
electronic memory, which is accommodated in the power<br>
breaker such that it is physically separated from the<br>
protective device and which can be read and written to<br>
by the protective device, for operational data for the<br>
power breaker.<br>
A power breaker of this type has been disclosed in, for<br>
example, DE 100 19 092 A1. The protective device,<br>
which, in a known manner, is in the form of an<br>
electronic overcurrent release, is in this case located<br>
in a front region of the power breaker behind a control<br>
panel. On the other hand, current transformers or<br>
current sensors, which detect measured values for the<br>
current in each of the poles of the power breaker and<br>
supply auxiliary power required for operating the<br>
protective device, are arranged on the rear side of the<br>
power breaker which is opposite the control panel. A<br>
cable harness connects these two regions of the power<br>
breaker. The electronic memory, which serves the<br>
purpose of storing characteristics and conversion<br>
factors which are dependent on the physical size and<br>
design of the power breaker, is arranged in the path of<br>
the cable harness.<br>
A further known application of an electronic memory<br>
which is physically separated from the protective<br>
device is a rated current plug according to<br>
US 4,958,252. In this case, the memory serves the<br>
purpose of recording operational events, in particular<br>
the number of switching operations and the level of the<br><br>
respectively interrupted current in order to determine<br>
from this the time for required maintenance work to be<br>
carried out on the power breaker.<br>
If an electronic memory of the abovementioned type is<br>
arranged in the power breaker such that it is<br>
physically separated from the protective device, a<br>
connection line or cable harness is required for there<br>
to be communication between these units. In this case,<br>
the electronic memory can be arranged in the path of<br>
the cable harness, as is described in the mentioned<br>
DE 100 19 092 A1. All of the interacting components and<br>
units are thus subjected to the disruptive influence of<br>
the magnretic, electrical and electromagnetic fields<br>
occurring in a power breaker. Since the sensitivity of<br>
electronic components and circuits to influences of<br>
this type is known, shields have been fitted in order<br>
to prevent disturbances to the operation of the<br>
protective devices (US 5,303,113).<br>
However, the increasing requirements placed on the<br>
switching capacity of power breakers lead to the<br>
electromagnetic influences on all of the electronic<br>
components of a power breaker also being increased<br>
correspondingly. Although there is extensive experience<br>
in controlling these influences, it appears to be<br>
desirable in the interest of safety to increase the<br>
electr-entagnetic compatibility (EMC) in particular of<br>
the electronic memory which is arranged separately. In<br>
this case, at the forefront is the consideration that,<br>
in the case of communication between the protective<br>
device and the memory, address information as well as<br>
write and read information can be altered by an<br>
interference field which has accidentally been greatly<br>
increased. For example, it may be possible for a write<br>
operation to take place instead of a read operation<br>
without a user being capable of recognizing this. In<br>
certain circumstances, it is possible in this way to<br><br>
influence the behavior of the protective device, which<br>
can lead to undesired tripping of the power breaker or<br>
to this tripping being suppressed even though it is<br>
required.<br>
It is obvious per se to eliminate these undesirable<br>
influences by using the internal write protection of<br>
the electronic memory. The memory modules (EEPROM) have<br>
for this purpose a separate input (WC = WRITE CONTROL)<br>
which cancels or establishes the write protection<br>
depending on the potential applied, as is described,<br>
for example, in US 5,363,334. However, in a power<br>
breaker, the memory is not accessible, for example in<br>
the case of the arrangement in the path of a cable<br>
harness according to DE 100 19 092 A1. It is therefore<br>
not possible to use a jumper which is conventionally<br>
provided. Even an electrical connection of the write<br>
protection input of a memory (EEPROM) is subject to<br>
difficulties, since an additional line required for<br>
this purpose is not available and undesirable<br>
additional complexity is required to install it<br>
retrospectively.<br>
Against this background, the invention is based on the<br>
object of using means which are as simple but as<br>
effective as possible to significantly improve data<br>
security when using an electronic memory in a power<br>
breaker.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by<br>
the electronic memory being connected to the protective<br>
device via a data bus which can be used to transmit<br>
control signals output by the protective device for the<br>
purpose of activating or deactivating a write<br>
protection device of the electronic memory. The<br>
connection between the protective device and the memory<br>
being in the form of a data bus entails<br><br>
no additional complexity, since only two conductors are<br>
required for data transmission (serial bus) . In<br>
addition there are two conductors for the power supply,<br>
meaning that in total four conductors are required.<br>
This number of conductors has also been used to date,<br>
but did not allow the write protection of the<br>
electronic memory to be used.<br>
In the context of the invention, the data bus may be in<br>
the form of an I2C bus, the electronic memory which can<br>
be controlled by means of the I2C bus having an<br>
associated digital I/O module which can likewise be<br>
controlled by the protective device by means of the I2C<br>
bus and whose output can be used to activate or<br>
deactivate the write protection of the electronic<br>
memory.<br>
The arrangement described in DE 100 19 092 A1 may also<br>
be used in the context of the invention, specifically<br>
such that the electronic memory in the form of an<br>
EEPROM and the digital I/O module are accommodated in a<br>
common housing arranged in the path of a four-core<br>
cable harness.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below<br>
with reference to the exemplary embodiments shown in<br>
the accompanying figures.<br>
The low-voltage power breaker 1 shown in figure 1 has,<br>
in a known manner, a housing 2, in which for each pole<br>
one switching contact arrangement 3 having an<br>
associated arcing chamber 4 and one drive apparatus 5<br>
are accommodated for the purpose of simultaneously<br>
actuating all of the switching contact arrangements<br>
provided. Each of the switching contact arrangements 3<br>
has an upper connection rail 6 and a lower connection<br>
rail 7 in order to connect the power breaker 1 to a<br><br>
circuit. Each of the lower connection rails 7 is<br>
provided with a set of transformers 8 which detects the<br>
current flowing through the associated switching<br>
contact arrangement 3 and in addition supplies<br>
auxiliary power for the purpose of operating an<br>
electronic overcurrent release 10. For this purpose,<br>
each set of transformers 8 comprises a current<br>
transformer 11 and a power transformer 12.<br>
The connection rails 6 and 7 as well as the sets of<br>
transformers 8 are located on the rear side of the<br>
housing 2, whereas the electronic overcurrent release<br>
provided as the protective device 10 is accessible from<br>
the opposite front side of the housing 2. For the<br>
purpose of connecting the sets of transformers 8 to the<br>
protective device 10, a cable harness 13 is provided<br>
which is laid in channels which are provided for this<br>
purpose in the housing 2 and which bypass the drive<br>
apparatus 5 and the switching contact arrangements 3.<br>
Proper interaction between the protective device 10 and<br>
the current transformers 11 requires the protective<br>
device 10 to process the current signals fed to it<br>
using a conversion factor which depends on the rated<br>
current for the current transformers, the physical size<br>
of the power breaker and, if necessary, further<br>
parameters. For this purpose it is known to provide<br>
electrical and/or electronic modules which are referred<br>
to as the rated current plug (rating plug), the<br>
interface module or the switch identification module<br>
and which are not arranged in the protective device 10<br>
itself but are connected to it as a peripheral module.<br>
Some of the conventional arrangements are illustrated<br>
in figure 1. 14 denotes here a rated current plug, for<br>
example according to DE 100 27 934 A1 or US 4,958,252.<br>
In addition, an information memory of the mentioned<br>
type according to EP 0 847 587 B1 (corresponds to<br><br>
US 6,034,859) can be arranged on the rear side of the<br>
protective<br><br>
device 10, as is indicated by 15. A further possibility<br>
for the arrangement of an information memory is<br>
described in DE 100 19 092 A1, according to which the<br>
information memory is arranged at 16 in the path of a<br>
cable harness connecting the protective device 10 and<br>
the set of transformers. In the embodiment of the<br>
mentioned information memory as an electrically<br>
erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) ,<br>
according to the present invention significantly<br>
improved data security is achieved using the write<br>
protection system provided in the electronic memories.<br>
Details on this write protection system will be<br>
explained in more detail below with reference to figure<br>
2.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the circuit for the electronic<br>
memory 16 arranged in the cable harness 13. Said memory<br>
is accommodated together with an I/O module 17 in a<br>
housing 18. Only that part of the cable harness 13 is<br>
shown which extends between the housing 18 and the<br>
protective device 10, since the part passed on to the<br>
current transformers 11 and 12 is not essential to the<br>
understanding of the invention. The electronic memory<br>
16 is a memory of the EEPROM (electrically erasable<br>
programmable read-only memory) type, specifically with<br>
a design envisaged for use with the I2C bus. The I2C<br>
bus, as is documented, for example, at the Internet<br>
address http://www.embedded.com/97/feat9711.htm, acts<br>
as a series control means for connecting integrated<br>
circuits. Accordingly, the memory 16 Tias Only four<br>
connections required for operation, namely two for the<br>
power supply and two further connections for data<br>
transmission. In figure 2, the connections envisaged<br>
for the power supply are denoted +5V and GND, whereas<br>
the connections envisaged for<br><br>
data transmission are denoted SDA (data) and SCL<br>
(clock) . As a further connection, the memory 16 has a<br>
connection /WC (write control) which activates the<br>
write protection when it is subjected to a high level<br>
and deactivates the write protection when it is<br>
subjected to a low level, i.e. allows the memory to be<br>
written to. Said four connections of the memory 16 are<br>
connected with corresponding conducting cores of the<br>
cable harness 13 to the protective device 10.<br>
Controlled by the protective device 10 or using an<br>
external operating panel, or one connected to the<br>
protective device 10, data can thus be read to and from<br>
the memory 16. In particular, this may be data which<br>
contains the conversion factor of measured values for<br>
the current transformers 11 and further parameters<br>
relating to the design of the power breaker 1.<br>
The memory 16 is normally provided with its basic data<br>
when the power breaker 1 is produced and equipped at<br>
the manufacturer's. During operation, the protective<br>
device 10 refers to the stored data, i.e. reads the<br>
stored data and processes it together with the measured<br>
values, supplied by the set of transformers 8, for the<br>
current for tripping purposes in the event of an<br>
overcurrent, a ground fault and a short circuit.<br>
Changes to the power breaker 1 as regards the current<br>
transformers fitted to it or an altered mode of<br>
operation may be cause for the stored data in the<br>
memory 16 to be altered. During operation of the power<br>
breaker 1 (figure 1), the memory content of the memory<br>
16 is thus read regularly. However, this data traffic<br>
handled via the cable harness 13, like other electronic<br>
modules accommodated in the power breaker 1, is subject<br>
to the influence of disruptive magnetic,<br><br>
electrical and electromagnetic fields which emanate<br>
from the current-carrying switching contact<br>
arrangements and switching arcs in the arcing chambers<br>
4. Similar, although weaker, disruptive influences can<br>
emanate from adjacent power breakers considering that<br>
power breakers are often incorporated close to one<br>
another in switchgear assemblies. Although during<br>
operation over relatively long periods of time it has<br>
been established that said interference fields do not<br>
impair data traffic between the protective device 10<br>
and the memory 16, it cannot be ruled out that,<br>
depending on the level of the interference fields and a<br>
statistical coincidence of unfavorable conditions,<br>
faults may nevertheless occur. Such a fault may be, for<br>
example, a write operation taking place instead of a<br>
read operation. If by this means, for example, a stored<br>
value representing the conversion factor is altered,<br>
this may be cause for tripping in the event of a<br>
current which is too low, which can lead to operational<br>
faults. If, on the other hand, tripping is shifted to<br>
higher current values, this may mean that safety is<br>
seriously impaired.<br>
Operations of the described type are largely eliminated<br>
according to the invention by a write protection device<br>
being used which is provided as standard on the memory<br>
16. This takes place without the number of conductors<br>
provided in the cable harness 13 needing to be<br>
increased for this purpose. The cable harness provided<br>
having four conductors can thus be used without any<br>
alterations. The write protection input /WC of the<br>
memory 16 is controlled by an additional I/O module 17<br>
which has the same design as the memory 16 for<br>
operation using the I2C bus system. Accordingly, the<br>
I/O module 17 has the same connections<br><br>
+5V, SDA, SCL and GND. In addition, outputs are<br>
provided which the user can use as required. The write<br>
protection connection /WC of the memory 16 is connected<br>
directly to one of these outputs. Owing to a connection<br>
of the write protection connection /WC of the memory 16<br>
to the connection +5V via a resistor R1, the write<br>
protection is normally activated, i.e. it is not<br>
possible for data to be read to the memory 16, if such<br>
an instruction were to be issued erroneously owing to<br>
interference. Only when, via the I2C bus, by means of<br>
the cable harness 13 or by means of a plug apparatus<br>
fitted to the connection of the cable harness on the<br>
housing 18, a control command is transmitted to the I/O<br>
module 17 which deactivates the write protection at the<br>
input /WC of the memory 16 can the stored data be<br>
altered or overwritten in the memory 16 or can<br>
additional data be written to said memory 16. As a<br>
result of the fact that the memory 16 and the I/O<br>
module 17 are accommodated in the immediate vicinity of<br>
one another within the housing 18, it can be assumed<br>
from this that faults owing to this circuit module<br>
being directly subjected to interference fields are<br>
improbable.<br>
Where the memory 16 arranged in the path of the cable<br>
harness 13 is described above, this is merely to be<br>
understood as an example for connection of memories<br>
arranged at another point in the power breaker 1. The<br>
memories 14 or 15, which are likewise arranged such<br>
that they are physically separated from the protective<br>
device 10, can thus be combined in the same manner with<br>
an I/O module 17 and as a result protected against<br>
faulty writing by means of the control via the I2C bus.<br><br>
