				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to compounds, to processes for their preparation, to compositions derived therefrom and to their use in ink jet printing ("UP"). UP is a nonimpact printing technique in which droplets of ink are ejected through a fine nozzle onto a substrate without bringing the nozzle into contact with the substrate.<br>
There are many demanding performance requirements for dyes and inks used in UP. For example they desirably provide sharp, non-feathered images having good water-fastness, light-fastness and optical density. The inks are often required to dry quickly when applied to a substrate to prevent smudging, but they should not form a crust over the tip of ink jet nozzles because this will stop the printer from working. The inks should also be stable to storage over time without decomposing or forming a precipitate which could block the fine nozzles.<br>
JP 58-174459 describes certain dis-azo dyes comprising once-coupled 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene and their use in ink jet printing.<br>
JP 57-36693 and US 4,395,288 describe certain tetra-azo dyes comprising 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene and their use in ink jet printing.<br>
US 1,209,154, published in 1916, describes the synthesis of certain tris-azo dyes comprising a 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene group at one end and a 1,3-diaminobenzene group at the other end. These dyes are used for the conventional dyeing of cotton.<br>
GB 809279, published in 1959, describes the synthesis of copper complexes of certain tris-azo dyes comprising once-coupled 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene and a 3,3'-dimethoxy-1,1'-diphenyl linker. These dyes are used for the conventional dyeing of cotton.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that the tris-azo dyes of the present invention have exceptional properties when used as ink jet inks, producing prints of high optical density (OD) of a neutral black with excellent light and ozone-fastness and high operability.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for printing an image on a substrate comprising applying thereto a composition comprising a liquid medium and a tris-azo compound of Formula (1) or salt thereof: (Figure Remove)<br>
 wherein:<br>
A	is an optionally substituted alkenyl, a homocyclic or heterocyclic group;<br>
L1 and L2       are each independently optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl; and<br>
m and n	are each independently 0 or 1 such that m+n is 1 or 2;<br><br>
wherein:<br>
(i)        the compound of Formula (1) is optionally in the form of a metal chelate; and<br>
(ii)       at least one of L1 and L2 carries at least one substituent selected from sulpho, carboxy, C^-alkoxy and C^-alkoxy-OH.<br>
Preferably the composition is applied to the substrate by means of an ink jet printer. The ink jet printer preferably applies the composition to the substrate in the form of droplets which are ejected through a small orifice onto the substrate. Preferred ink jet printers are piezoelectric ink jet printers and thermal ink jet printers. In thermal ink jet printers, programmed pulses of heat are applied to the composition in a reservoir by means of a resistor adjacent to the orifice, thereby causing the composition to be ejected in the form of small droplets directed towards the substrate during relative movement between the substrate and the orifice. In piezoelectric ink jet printers the oscillation of a small crystal causes ejection of the composition from the orifice.<br>
The image is preferably text, a picture, a photorealistic image or a combination thereof.<br>
The substrate is preferably paper, plastic, metal or glass, more preferably a treated substrate such as a coated paper or coated plastic, especially plain paper. One of the advantages of the present process is its ability to provide very good printing results even on plain paper.<br>
Preferred papers have an acid, alkaline or neutral character. Examples of commercially available treated papers include HP Premium Coated Paper™, HP Photopaper™, HP Printing paper ™ (available from Hewlett Packard Inc.); Stylus Pro 720 dpi Coated Paper™, Epson Photo Quality Glossy Film™, Epson Photo Quality Glossy Paper ™ (all available from Seiko Epson Corp.); Canon HR 101 High Resolution Paper™, Canon GP 201 Glossy Paper™, Canon HG 101and HG201 High Gloss Film™, Canon PR101 ™ (all available from Canon); Kodak Premium Photopaper, Kodak Premium InkJetpaper ™ (available from Kodak); Konica InkJet Paper QP™ Professional Photo Glossy, Konica InkJet Paper QP™ Professional Photo 2-sided Glossy, Konica InkJet Paper QP™ Premium Photo Glossy, Konica InkJet Paper QP™ Premium Photo Silky ™ (available from Konica) and Xerox Acid Paper (available from Xerox).<br>
In this specification any groups shown in the free acid form also include the salt form. Furthermore the formulae shown in this specification cover all tautomers thereof.<br>
When the compound of Formula (1) is in the form of a salt preferred salts are alkali metal salts, especially lithium, sodium and potassium salts, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts and mixtures thereof. Especially preferred salts are salts with ammonia and volatile amines. The free acid form may be converted into a salt using known techniques. For example, an alkali metal salt may be converted into a salt with ammonia or an amine by dissolving an alkali metal salt of the composition in water, acidifying with a<br><br>
mineral acid and adjusting the pH of the solution to pH 9 to 9.5 with ammonia or the amine and removing the alkali metal cations by dialysis.<br>
The preferred optionally substituted homocyclic or heterocyclic group groups represented by A are optionally substituted aryl, heteroaryl and non-aromatic cyclic groups.<br>
Preferred optionally substituted aryl groups represented by A, L1 and L2are each independently optionally substituted phenyl, biphenyl or naphthyl.

Preferably A carries from 0 to 5 substituents, more preferably 1 to 4 substituents, especially 1, 2 or 3 substituents. In a preferred embodiment A is not 1,3-diaminophenyl.<br>
As examples of optionally substituted phenyl and naphthyl groups represented by A there may be mentioned 2,4-dihydroxyphenyl, 3-sulfo-4,6-diaminophenyl, 2-hydroxy-4-diethylaminophenyl 2-sulfo-4-diethylaminophenyl, 1-hydroxy-3,6-disu!phonaphthyl and 1,8-dihydroxy-3,6-disulfonaphthyl.

Preferably L1 and L2 are each independently, or comprise, one or more arylene groups, more preferably one or two optionally substituted phenylene or naphthylene groups.   When L1 or L2 is, or comprises, more than one arylene group, the said arylene groups are optionally connected by means of a covalent bond or group containing from 1 to 10 atoms selected from O, S, N, C, H and combinations thereof, for example -0-, -NR2-, -NR2-CO-, -NR2CONR2-, -S-, -SO-, -SO2-, -SO2NR2- or -C R2=C R2-, wherein each R2 independently is H or C^-alkyl.<br>
Preferably L1 and L2 are each independently optionally substituted phenylene or naphthylene, wherein at least one of L1 and L2 carries at least one substituent selected from sulpho, carboxy, CM-alkoxy and C^-alkoxy-OH.

When the compound of Formula (1) is in the form of a metal chelate the metal is preferably Boron or a transition metal, more preferably Mn, Fe, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu or Zn, especially Co, Ni or Cu. The metal may be complexed with the compound of Formula (1) in a ratio of from 1:2 to 2:1, preferably in a ratio of metal to compound of Formula (1) of 1:2, 2:3, 1:1, 2:2 or 2:1, especially 2:1. However we have found that when the compound of Formula (1) is not in the form of a metal chelate the compound is still a valuable colorant for ink jet printing. Such unmetallised dyes are cheaper and easier to make than the corresponding metal chelates and they are more environmentally friendly due to the absence of, for example, transition metals.<br>
Preferably the compound of Formula (1) is black.<br>
Bearing in mind the above preferences, the compound of Formula (1) is preferably of the Formula (1) wherein:<br>

optionally substituted acylamine;<br>
(iv) at least one of L1 and L2 carries at least one substituent selected from sulpho,<br>
carboxy, C^-alkoxy and Ci^-alkoxy-OH;and<br>
(v) when L1 carries a methoxy group A is not 1,3-diaminophenyl.<br>
The preferences for the compound according to the second aspect of the present invention are as described above in relation to the first aspect of the present invention, with the proviso that when both groups represented by L are free from sulpho, carboxy and C^-alkoxy-OH groups then A is not 1,3-diaminophenyl.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a composition comprising a tris-azo compound of Formula (1) or salt thereof as defined in relation to the first aspect of the present invention and a low melting point solid or a liquid medium comprising water and an organic solvent, wherein the compound of Formula (1) is not Formula (3) or a salt thereof:<br>

Optionally the liquid medium comprises an oxidant.<br>
Preferred low melting point solids have a melting point in the range from 60°C to 125°C. Suitable low melting point solids include long chain fatty acids or alcohols,<br><br>
preferably those with C18.24 chains, and sulphonamides. The compound of Formula (1) may be dissolved in the low melting point solid or may be finely dispersed in it.<br>
Typically the liquid medium will further comprise one or more surfactants, for example anionic and/or nonionic surfactants. Examples of anionic surfactants include: Sulfonate surfactants such as Sulfosuccinates (Aerosol™ OT, A196; AY and GP, available from CYTEC) and Sultanates (Aerosol™ DPOS-45, OS available from CYTEC; Witconate™ C-50H available from WITCO; Dowfax™ 8390 available from DOW); and Fluoro surfactants (Fluorad™ FC99C available from 3M). Examples of nonionic surfactants include: Fluoro surfactants (Fluorad™ FC170C available from 3M); Alkoxylate surfactants (Tergitol™ series 15S-5, 15S-7, and 15S-9 available from Union Carbide); and Organosilicone surfactants (Silwet™ L-77 and L-76-9 available from WITCO).<br>
One or more buffers may optionally be included in the liquid medium to modulate pH of the ink. The buffers can be organic-based biological buffers or inorganic buffers, preferably, organic-based. Examples of preferably-employed buffers include tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS), available from companies such as Aldrich Chemical (Milwaukee, Wis.), 4-morpholine ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), and beta-hydroxy-4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPSO). Further, the buffers employed should provide a pH ranging from about 3 to about 9 in the practice of the invention, preferably about 4 to about 6 and most preferably from about 4 to about 5.<br>
One or more of the biocides commonly employed in inkjet inks may optionally be used in the ink, such as Nuosept™ 95, available from Huls America (Piscataway, N.J.); Proxel™ GXL, available from Zeneca (Wilmington, Del.); and glutaraldehyde, available from Union Carbide Company (Bound Brook, N.J.) under the trade designation Ucarcide 250.<br>
Inks according to the invention may optionally also include one or more metal<br>
chelator. Such chelators are used to bind transition metal cations that may be present in<br>
the ink. Examples of preferred metal chelators include: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid<br>
("EDTA"),	diethylenediaminepentaacetic	acid	("DPTA"),	trans-1,2-<br>
diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic acid ("CDTA"), ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid ("EGTA"), or other chelators.<br>
In one embodiment inks according to the invention have a pH of from about 3 to about 5, preferably from about 3.5 to about 4.5. In another embodiment the pH of the composition is preferably from 4 to 11, more preferably from 7 to 10. Optionally the composition comprises a buffer.<br>
The viscosity of the composition at 25°C is preferably less than 50cP, more preferably less than 20 cP and especially less than 5cP.<br>
When the compositions according to the invention are used as ink jet printing compositions, the composition preferably has a concentration of less than 500 parts per million, more preferably less than 100 parts per million of halide ions. It is especially<br><br>
preferred that the composition has less than 100, more preferably less than 50 parts per million of divalent and trivalent metals, wherein parts refer to parts by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. We have found that purifying the compositions to reduce the concentration of these undesirable ions reduces nozzle blockage in ink jet printing heads, particularly in thermal ink jet printers. Similarly low levels as divalent and trivalent metals are also preferred.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be used as the sole colorant in the compositions because of their attractive black shade. However, if desired, one may combine the present compounds together and/or with one or more further colorants to reduce nozzle blockage (by improving their solubility) or if a slightly different shade is required for a particular end use.

(Figure Remove)Formula (4).<br><br>
The compound of Formula (4) may be prepared by diazotising a compound of Formula CH3CONH-L1-N=N-L2-NH2 and coupling the resultant diazonium salt onto a suitable 1,8-dihydroxy naphthalene compound, then removing the CH3CO group by hydrolysis. The compound of Formula CH3CONH-L1-N=N-L2-NH2 may be prepared by diazotising an amine of formula CH3CONH-L1-NH2 and coupling onto an amine of Formula H-L2-NH2.<br>
Preferably the diazotisations are carried out using a diazotising agent, especially sodium nitrite under acidic conditions. Further preferably the diazotisations are carried out at a temperature of 0 to 5°C. In the above process A, L1, L2, m and n are as hereinbefore defined.<br>

A still further as aspect of the present invention provides an ink jet printer cartridge, optionally refillable, comprising one or more chambers and a composition, wherein the composition is present in at least one of the chambers and the composition is as defined in the third aspect of the present invention.<br>
The present compounds and compositions provide prints of attractive, neutral black shades that are particularly well suited for the ink jet printing of text and images. The compositions have good storage stability and low tendency to block the very fine nozzles used in ink jet printers. Furthermore, the resultant images have good optical density, light-fastness, wet-fastness and resistance to fading in the presence of oxidising air pollutants (e.g. ozone).<br>

Table 7(Table Remove)Ozone Fastness<br>
The inks from Examples 61 to 66 were printed onto the substrate shown using a HP560™ ink jet printer. The printed substrate was then assessed for ozone stability using an ozone test cabinet from Hampden Test Equipment.   The test was carried out for 24 hours at 40°C and 50% relative humidity in the presence of 1 part per million of ozone. Fastness of the printed ink to ozone was judged by the difference in the optical density before and after exposure to ozone using a Gretag Spectrolino Spectrodensitometer. Thus, the lower the %OD loss the greater the ozone fastness. The results are shown in Table 8 <br>
