MODULA TORS OF CELLULAR ADHESION<br>
PRIORITY<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Nos.: 60/560,517, filed April 8, 2004; and 60/517,535, filed November 5,2003; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Research conducted over the last decade has helped elucidate the molecular events attending cell-cell interactions in the body, especially those events involved in the movement and activation of cells in the immune system. See generally, Springer, T. Nature, 1990, 346, 425-434. Cell surface proteins, and especially the Cellular Adhesion Molecules ("CAMs") and "leukointegrins", including LFA-1, MAC-1 and gpl50.95 (referred to as CD18/CD1 la, CD18/CD11b, and CD18/CDllc, respectively) have correspondingly been the subject of pharmaceutical research and development having as its goal the intervention in the processes of leukocyte extravasation to sites of injury and leukocyte movement to distinct targets. For example, it is presently believed that prior to the leukocyte extravasation, which is a mandatory component of the inflammatory response, activation of integrins constitutively expressed on leukocytes occurs and is followed by a tight ligand/receptor interaction between integrins {e.g., LFA-1) and one or several distinct intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) designated ICAM-1, ICAM-2, ICAM-3 or ICAM-4 which are expressed on blood vessel endothelial cell surfaces and on other leukocytes. The interaction of the CAMs with the leukointegrins is a vital step in the normal functioning of the immune system. It is believed that immune processes such as antigen presentation, T-cell mediated cytotoxicity and leukocyte extravasation all require cellular adhesion mediated by ICAMs interacting with the leukointegrins. See generally Kishimoto, T. K.; Rothlein; R. R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994, 25, 117-138 and Diamond, M.; Springer, T. Current Biology, 1994,4, 506-532.<br>
[0003] Clearly, because of the role that the interaction of the CAMs and the leukointegrins plays in the immune response, it would be desirable to modulate these<br><br>
WO 2005/044817	PCT/US2004/036942<br>
specific interactions to achieve a desired therapeutic result (e.g., inhibition of the interaction in the event of an overactive immune response). Significantly, it has been demonstrated that the antagonism of the interaction between the CAMs and the leukointegrins can be realized by agents directed against either component. Specifically, blocking of the CAMs, such as for example ICAM-1, or the leukointegrins, such as for example LFA-1, by antibodies directed against either or both of these molecules effectively inhibits inflammatory responses. In vitro models of inflammation and immune response inhibited by antibodies to CAMs or leukointegrins include antigen or mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, homotypic aggregation of lymphocytes, T-cell mediated cytolysis and antigen-specific induced tolerance. The relevance of the in vitro studies are supported by in vivo studies with antibodies directed against ICAM-1 or LFA-1. For example, antibodies directed against LFA-1 can prevent thyroid graft rejection and prolong heart allograft survival in mice (Gorski, A.; Immunology Today, 1994,15, 251-255). Of greater significance, antibodies directed against ICAM-1 have shown efficacy in vivo as anti-inflammatory agents in human diseases such as renal allograft rejection and rheumatoid arthritis (Rothlein, R. R.; Scharschmidt, L., in: Adhesion Molecules; Wegner, C. D., Ed.; 1994, 1-38, Cosimi, C. B.; et al, J. Immunol. 1990,144, 4604-4612 and Kavanaugh, A.; et al, Arthritis Rheum. 1994, 37, 992-1004) and antibodies directed against LFA-1 have demonstrated immunosuppressive effects in bone marrow transplantation and in the prevention of early rejection of renal allografts (Fischer, A.; et al, Lancet, 1989, 2, 1058-1060 and Le Mauff, B.; et al, Transplantation, 1991, 52,291-295).<br>
[0004] As described above, the use of anti-LFA-1 or anti-ICAM-1 antibodies to antagonize this interaction has been investigated. Additionally, the use of LFA-1 or ICAM-1 peptides, fragments or peptide antagonists {see, for example, US Patents 5,149,780, 5,288,854, 5,340,800, 5,424,399, 5,470,953, Published PCT applications WO 90/03400, WO90/13316, WO90/10652, WO91/19511, WO92/03473, WO94/11400, WO95/28170, JP4193895, EP314863, EP362526, EP362531), and small molecule antagonists have been investigated. For example, several small molecules have been described in the literature which affect the interaction of CAMs and leukointegrins. A natural product isolated from the root of Trichilia rubra was<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2005/044817	PCT/US2004/036942<br>
found to be inhibitory in an in vitro cell binding assay (Musza, L. L.; et al., Tetrahedron, 1994, 50, 11369-11378). One series of molecules (Boschelli, D. H.; et al, J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 111 and Boschelli, D. H.; et al, J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 4597-4614) was found to be orally active in a reverse passive Arthus reaction, an induced model of inflammation that is characterized by neutrophil accumulation (Chang, Y. H.; et al, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992, 69, 155-164). Another series of molecules was also found to be orally active in a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction in rats (Sanfilippo, P. J.; etal, J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 1057-1059). All of these molecules appear to act nonspecifically, either by inhibiting the transcription of ICAM-1 along with other proteins or act intracellularly to inhibit the activation of the leukointegrins by an unknown mechanism, and none appear to directly antagonize the interaction of the CAMs with the leukointegrins. <br>
[0005] Clearly, although several classes of compounds have been investigated for therapeutic use, there remains a need for the development of novel therapeutics that are capable of modulating interactions between CAMs and leukointegrins. In particular, it would be desirable to develop therapeutics capable of selectively targeting (preferably inhibiting) the interaction between LFA-1 and ICAM-1 that would be useful as a therapeutic agent for immune and/or inflammatory disorders.<br>

Thus, the present invention encompasses inventive compounds, their derivatives, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceuticaUy acceptable salts their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions containing them.<br>
[0161] 2) Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[0162] As discussed above this invention provides novel compounds that have biological properties useful for the treatment of Mac-1 and LFA-1 mediated disorders.<br>
[0163] Accordingly, in another aspect of the present invention, pharmaceutical compositions are provided, which comprise any one of the compounds described herein (or a prodrug, pharmaceutically acceptable salt or other pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof), and optionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In certain embodiments, these compositions optionally further comprise one or more additional therapeutic agents. Alternatively, a compound of this invention may be administered to a patient in need thereof in combination with the administration of one or more other therapeutic agents. For example, additional therapeutic agents for conjoint administration or inclusion in a pharmaceutical composition with a compound of this invention may be an approved anti-inflammatory agent, or it may be any one of a number of agents undergoing approval in the Food and Drug Administration that ultimately obtain approval for the treatment of any disorder mediated by Mac-1 or LFA-1. It will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds of present invention can exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof.<br>
[0164] As described above, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which, as used herein, includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to<br>
60<br><br>
WO 2005/044817	PCT/US2004/036942<br>
the particular dosage form desired. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sixteenth Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980) discloses various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutical compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the compounds of the invention, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other components) of the pharmaceutical composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this invention. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatine; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil, sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such as propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogenfree water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.<br>
[0165] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as<br>
61<br><br>
WO 2005/044817	PCT/US2004/036942<br>
wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
[0166] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
[0167] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.<br>
[0168] In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension or crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle, Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include (poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.<br>

In certain embodiments, the active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, eardrops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms are made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. As discussed above, penetration enhancing agents can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
[0176] It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be formulated and employed in combination therapies, that is, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated with or administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular<br>
66<br><br>
WO 2005/044817	PCT/US2004/036942<br>
combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another anti-inflammatory agent), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects).<br>
[0177] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention further comprise one or more additional therapeutically active ingredients (e.g., anti-inflammatory and/or palliative). For purposes of the invention, the term "Palliative" refers to treatment that is focused on the relief of symptoms of a disease and/or side effects of a therapeutic regimen, but is not curative. For example, palliative treatment encompasses painkillers, antinausea medications and anti-sickness drugs.<br>
[0178] 3) Research Uses, Pharmaceutical Uses and Methods of Treatment<br>
[0179] Research Uses<br>
[0180] According to the present invention, the inventive compounds may be<br>

[0182] As detailed in the exemplification herein, in assays to determine the ability of compounds to modulate T-cell adhesion to 5dICAM-Ig {e.g., cell attachment assay), certain inventive compounds exhibited IC50 values 
[0184] As discussed above, certain of the compounds as described herein exhibit activity generally as modulators of adhesion between intracellular adhesion molecules. More specifically, compounds of the invention demonstrate the ability to antagonize CD11/CD18 receptors associated with leukocytes and in certain embodiments exhibit the ability to antagonize LFA-1 interactions. Thus, in certain embodiments, compounds of the invention are useful for the treatment of LFA-1 mediated disorders.<br>
[0185] Accordingly, in another aspect of the invention, methods for treating (or preventing) of LFA-1 mediated disorders are provided comprising administering a<br>
68<br><br>
WO 2005/044817	PCT/US2004/036942<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or (II) as described herein, to a subject in need thereof. In certain embodiments, a method for the treatment of LFA-1 mediated disorders is provided comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an inventive compound, or a pharmaceutical composition, comprising an inventive compound to a subject in need thereof, in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result.

69<br><br>
WO 2005/044817	PCT/US2004/036942<br>
molecules {e.g., ICAM-1, 2 or 3) and the leukocyte integrin family of receptors. Thus, in certain embodiments, the present invention provides compounds useful for the treatment of disorders mediated by the CD11/CD18 family of cellular adhesion molecules. In certain embodiments of special interest, the present invention provides compounds useful for the treatment of disorders mediated by Mac-1 and/or LFA-1. For example, compounds of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment inflammatory disorders, organ graft rejection and autoimmune disorders, to name a few.<br>
[0189] Thus, as described above, in another aspect of the invention, a method for the treatment of disorders mediated by the CD11/CD18 family of cellular adhesion molecules is provided comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or (II) as described herein, to a subject in need thereof. In certain embodiments of special interest the inventive method is used for the treatment of disorders mediated by Mac-1 or LFA-1. It will be appreciated that the compounds and compositions, according to the method of the present invention, may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for the treatment of disorders mediated by the CD11/CD18 family of cellular adhesion molecules. For example, in certain exemplary embodiments, compounds of the invention are useful as antagonists of the interaction between Mac-1 or LFA-1 and intracellular adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM-1) and thus the compounds are useful for the treatment of LFA-1 mediated disorders including, but not limited to, psoriasis, responses associated with inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), dermatitis, meningitis, encephalitis, uveitis, allergic conditions such as eczema and asthma, conditions involving infiltration of T-cells and chronic inflammatory responses, skin hypersensitivity reactions (including poison ivy and poison oak), atherosclerosis, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, Reynaud's syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Sjorgen's syndrome, juvenile onset diabetes, and immune responses associated with delayed hypersensitivity mediated by cytokines and T-lymphocytes typically found in tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, polymyositis, granulomatosis and vasculitis, pernicious anemia, diseases involving leukocyte<br>

Thus, the expression "effective amount" as used herein, refers to a sufficient amount of agent to antagonize the interaction between intracellular adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM) and the leukocyte integrin family of receptors, and to exhibit a therapeutic effect. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular therapeutic agent, its mode of administration, and the like. The compounds of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression "dosage unit form" as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of therapeutic agent appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts (see, for example, Goodman and Gilman's, "The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", Tenth Edition, A. Gilman, J.Hardman and L. Limbird, eds., McGraw-Hill Press, 155-173, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
[0190] Another aspect of the invention relates to a method for inhibiting the interaction between LFA-1 and ICAM-1 in a biological sample or a patient, which method comprises administering to the patient, or contacting said biological sample with a compound of formula I or II or a composition comprising said compound.<br>

[0205] General Reaction Procedures:<br>
[0206] Unless mentioned specifically, reaction mixtures were stirred using a magnetically driven stirrer bar. An inert atmosphere refers to either dry argon or dry nitrogen. Reactions were monitored either by thin layer chromatography, by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), of a suitably worked up sample of the reaction mixture. [0207] General Work Up Procedures:<br>
[0208] Unless mentioned specifically, reaction mixtures were cooled to room temperature or below then quenched, when necessary, with either water or a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride. Desired products were extracted by partitioning between water and a suitable water-immiscible solvent (e.g. ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, diethyl ether). The desired product containing extracts were washed appropriately with water followed by a saturated solution of brine. On occasions where the product containing extract was deemed to contain residual oxidants, the extract was washed with a 10% solution of sodium sulphite in saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, prior to the aforementioned washing procedure. On occasions where the product containing extract was deemed to contain residual acids, the extract was washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, prior to the aforementioned washing procedure (except in those cases where the desired product itself had acidic character). On occasions where the product containing extract was deemed to contain residual bases, the extract was washed with 10% aqueous citric acid solution, prior to the aforementioned washing procedure (except in those cases where the desired product itself had basic<br>
75<br><br>
WO 2005/044817	PCT/US2004/036942<br>
character). Post washing, the desired product containing extracts were dried over<br>
anhydrous magnesium sulphate, and then filtered. The crude products were then<br>
isolated by removal of solvent(s) by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure, at an<br>
appropriate temperature (generally less than 45°C).<br>
[0209] General Purification Procedures:<br>
[0210] Unless mentioned specifically, chromatographic purification refers to<br>
i<br>
flash column chromatography on silica, using a single solvent or mixed solvent as eluent. Suitably purified desired product containing elutes were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure at an appropriate temperature (generally less than 45°C) to constant mass. Final compounds were dissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile, filtered and transferred to vials, then freeze-dried under high vacuum before submission for biological testing.<br>

[0454] 2) Biological Data:<br>
[0455] As discussed above, LFA-ICAM interactions have been directly implicated in numerous inflammatory disease states including, but not limited to graft rejection, dermatitis, psoriasis, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, compounds capable of modulating adhesion between intracellular adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM-1, -2 and -3) and the leukocyte integrin family of receptors would be useful in the development of novel therapeutics. Described below are certain assays used for the determination of ICAM-1 :LFA Receptor binding, Human T-Cell Adhesion, and T-Cell proliferation which are described in published PCT applications WO 99/49856 and WO 02/05114, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. WO 99/49856 also describes the preparation and purification of full-length LFA-1 from 293 cells, the preparation of a plasmid for expression of a human ICAM-1 immunoadhesion, and the generation of ICAM-1 immunoadhesion expressing 293 cell line.<br>
