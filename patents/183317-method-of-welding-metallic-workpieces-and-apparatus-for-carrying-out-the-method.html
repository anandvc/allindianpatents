				<td>Description<br>
Method of welding metallic workpieces and apparatus for<br>
carrying out the method<br>
The invention relates to a method of welding<br>
metallic workpieces and an apparatus for carrying out the<br>
method in  the joint welding of pipes.<br>
In a multiplicity of steels, for example austeni-<br>
tic steels, corrosion occurs primarily in the range of<br>
high tensile stresses upon contact with certain media,<br>
for example water. In order to avoid this type of cor-<br>
rosion, designated as stress corrosion cracking, it is<br>
necessary to reduce the level of tensile stresses in the<br>
workpiece. This can be done, for example, by design<br>
measures when fashioning a component or by production<br>
measures during its manufacture. However, tensile<br>
stresses occur in particular in the area of welding<br>
points, in particular at joint welding points of austeni-<br>
tic pipelines. These tensile stresses, which are residual<br>
stresses above the yield point, are caused by the shrink-<br>
age of the weld deposit introduced and are unavoidable.<br>
To shift such tensile stresses, it is known, for<br>
example, from US-A-4,683,014 to apply compressive forces<br>
to the periphery of the pipes in the area of a finished<br>
pipe weld seam, which compressive forces cause plastic<br>
deformation of the pipes and the build-up of axial<br>
compressive stresses at the inner surface of the weld<br>
seam.<br>
US~A-4,678,894 discloses a method of reducing<br>
residual stresses in a pipe weld seam, in which the pipe<br>
weld seam is subjected to a subsequent thermal treatment.<br>
In this known method, the pipe weld seam is inductively<br>
heated at its outer surface and is simultaneously cooled<br>
at its inner surface with water in order to produce a<br>
temperature gradient between the inner and outer surface.<br>
Compressive stresses are produced at the inner surface<br>
and tensile stresses are produced at the outer surface of<br>
the pipe by the different linear expansion on account of<br>
the temperature difference between the inner and outer<br>
surface. Here, the stresses produced at the outer surface<br>
are above the yield point and thus produce a permanent<br>
compressive stress at the inner surface after cooling.<br>
Methods are also known in which compressive<br>
stresses are brought about in the root area of a joint<br>
weld seam during the welding by producing a temperature<br>
gradient over the wall thickness of the workpiece. In so-<br>
called heat sink welding or last pass heat sink welding,<br>
this is done by the weld seam being cooled with water<br>
from the inside in a similar manner to the aforesaid<br>
thermal treatment method after the weld seam has been<br>
closed in the root area and during the welding of the<br>
outer filler runs.<br>
However, in particular during the pipeline<br>
assembly and in particular in the case of closing seams<br>
the cooling of the inner surface with flowing water can<br>
be carried out only at an unjustifiable cost and is<br>
therefore of limited suitability for practical applica-<br>
tion in situ and is very expensive.<br>
The object of the invention, then, is to specify<br>
a method of welding metallic workpieces with which a high<br>
temperature gradient over the wall thickness of the<br>
workpieces can be achieved at little cost in the area of<br>
the welding point during the welding. In addition, an<br>
apparatus for carrying out the method in the joint<br>
welding of pipes is to be specified.<br>
The said objects are achieved by the features of<br>
Patent Claims 1 and 6, respectively.<br>
In a welding method, in particular for the joint<br>
welding of metallic workpieces having a wall thickness,<br>
the metallic workpieces are cooled with liquid gas during<br>
the welding for producing a temperature gradient over<br>
their wall thickness. The liquid gas vaporizes upon<br>
striking the surface of the workpiece so that the heat of<br>
vaporization is additionally available for the cooling.<br>
The vaporizing gas flows by itself out of the pipeline<br>
into the ambient, so that no further technical measures<br>
are necessary for the removal of the gas.<br>
The cooling with liquid gas is here preferably<br>
effected on one side, on the surface of the workpieees<br>
which is opposite the heat input.<br>
The cooling with liquid gas is carried out in<br>
particular only after the welding groove is closed in the<br>
root area.<br>
The weld seam can also be partly or completely<br>
filled. Even at old weld seams, it is possible to<br>
subsequently reduce the tensile stresses by subsequent<br>
application of one or more additional welding beads<br>
during simultaneous cooling with liquid gas. These<br>
welding beads can be made by the stringer technique or by<br>
weaving. The heat input is reduced in an advantageous<br>
manner by the application of a plurality of small welding<br>
beads or additional finish runs.<br>
Liquid nitrogen or argon, for example, are<br>
suitable as the liquid gas. In an especially preferred<br>
development of the invention, liquid carbon dioxide is<br>
used as the liquid gas. In the case of this gas, so-<br>
called carbon-dioxide snow develops during the spraying,<br>
which is deposited on the inner surface of the pipe and<br>
results in especially effective cooling.<br>
As a result of the sublimation of the carbon<br>
dioxide or the vaporization of other chemically inert<br>
liquid gases suitable for cooling, the oxygen present is<br>
in addition displaced in the ambient of the weld seam and<br>
a shielding-gas atmosphere comparable to an inert forming<br>
gas is produced. Tarnishing or oxidation of the root area<br>
is thereby also prevented during the cooling.<br>
A suitable apparatus for the joint welding of two<br>
pipes contains a spray device which can be inserted into<br>
the interior of the pipes, is connected to a feed line<br>
for liquid carbon dioxide and is provided with at least<br>
one discharge opening. This spray device preferably<br>
contains a cylindrical spray head having a plurality of<br>
discharge openings distributed over its periphery.<br>
In an especially preferred development of the<br>
invention, the spray head is provided with baffle plates<br>
between which the discharge openings are arranged. To<br>
improve the cooling effect, swirling or a rotational<br>
flow of the liquid-gas stream can also be additionally<br>
provided by special nozzle arrangements and suitably<br>
shaped baffle plates.<br>
In a further development of the invention, spray<br>
devices can also be provided which have a plurality of<br>
spray heads, preferably of identical construction, to<br>
increase the cooling capacity.<br>
In a further preferred development of the inven-<br>
tion, the spray device contains sealing means for forming<br>
a chamber which is closed off to both sides of the pipe<br>
and in which the spray head is located. In particular,<br>
the feed line is connected via a three-way valve to both<br>
a liquid-gas supply and a shielding-gas supply.<br>
Consequently, before the root area of the weld is closed,<br>
forming or shielding gas can be admitted to the chamber<br>
formed by the spray device, so that a shielding-gas<br>
atmosphere can be produced in the interior of the pxpe in<br>
the area of the weld seam.<br>
To explain the invention in more detail, refer-<br>
ence is made to the exemplary embodiment in the drawing,<br>
in which:<br>
Figure 1  schematically illustrates  in  side view an<br>
apparatus, inserted into a pipe, according to<br>
the invention,<br>
Figure 2  shows a sectional detail of the weld seam<br>
during the welding.<br>
According to Figure 1, two workpieces, in the<br>
example of application two pipes 2 and 4 having a wail<br>
thickness d, are joined together at their ends 2a and 4a,<br>
respectively. Located between the ends 2a and 4a pre-<br>
formed before the welding operation is a welding groove<br>
6 which in accordance with the figure is already partly<br>
filled with a molten weld metal 8. The heat input takes<br>
place, for example, by means of an arc on the outer<br>
surface 2b, 4b of the pipes 2 and 4, respectively. In<br>
addition, the detail enlargement of the root area 10,<br>
already closed and solidified on the inner surface 2c,<br>
4c, of the weld seam can be recognized in Figure 2.<br>
Inserted into the interior of the pipes 2 and 4<br>
is a spray device 20 which is connected to a flexible<br>
feed line 40. The spray device 20 contains an approxi-<br>
mately cylindrical spray head 22 which is provided at its<br>
periphery with a plurality of nozzle-shaped discharge<br>
openings 24. These discharge openings 24 are arranged<br>
between two disc-shaped baffle plates 26 with which the<br>
medium flowing out of the discharge openings 24 can be<br>
aligned with the root area 10 of the weld seam.<br>
In addition, the spray device 20 contains two<br>
sealing discs 28 which form a chamber 30 which consists<br>
of a pipe section and is used at the start of the weld-<br>
ing, before the root 10 is closed, to build up a forming<br>
or shielding-gas atmosphere. To avoid excess pressure in<br>
this chamber 30, the sealing discs 28 are provided with<br>
openings 29a and b.<br>
As schematically shown in the figure, the feed<br>
line 4 0 is connected to a three-way valve 42, so that<br>
alternatively liquid gas 25, in particular liquid carbon<br>
dioxide CO2,liq, or shielding gas, for example argon Argas<br>
can be fed to the weld seam via the feed line 40.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, one of the sealing<br>
discs is provided with openings 29b which are arranged at<br>
its periphery. This not only avoids the build-up of<br>
excess pressure but also prevents excessive accumulation<br>
of CO2-snow. The openings 29b can additionally be pro-<br>
vided with a flap in order to prevent backflow of CO2-<br>
snow.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, austenitic pipes 2,<br>
4 having an outside diameter of about 160 mm and a wall<br>
thickness of 14 mm are welded to one another from outside<br>
by a TIG welding process. Forming is carried out on both<br>
sides with argon during the welding of the root run 10<br>
and the first backing runs. After the seam is filled to<br>
about one quarter, liquid carbon dioxide CO2,liq is<br>
injected into the spray device 20 via the three-way valve<br>
42 and the root run is cooled until all finish runs are<br>
applied.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, a temperature<br>
difference of about 200 °C resulted between the outer<br>
surface of the welding bead 8 at about 15 mm distance<br>
from the arc and the inner surface 2c, 4c of the pipes 2<br>
and 4, respectively, at about 0.5 mm distance from the<br>
welding root 10. The temperature at the inner surface was<br>
here always less than 50 °C. The differential stress a<br>
produced by this temperature gradient at the inner<br>
surface 2c, 4c is about 700 N/mm2 and was clearly higher<br>
than the yield point of the austenitic material used,<br>
which is about 200 N/mm2, so that permanent compressive<br>
stresses could be produced and the build-up of tensile<br>
stresses at the inner surface 2c, 4c in the area of the<br>
weld seam could be avoided.<br>
The welding technique illustrated with reference<br>
to joint welding of two pipes 2, 4 can be applied<br>
subsequently in the same manner to workpieces already<br>
welded to one another. By the application of an addi-<br>
tional weld or finish run by the method according to the<br>
invention, existing tensile stresses can subsequently be<br>
reduced. A plurality of small welding beads or finish<br>
runs can also preferably be applied one after the other<br>
to reduce the heat input.<br>
