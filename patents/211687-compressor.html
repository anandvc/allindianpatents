DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0032] Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In describing the embodiments of the present invention, same parts will be given the same names and reference symbols, and repetitive description of which will be omitted.<br>
[0033] FIG. 1 illustrates a plan view of a compressor in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention having an upper case removed therefrom, FIG. 2 illustrates a front view showing a suction muffler in FIG 1, FIG 3 illustrates a plan view of a compressor in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention having an upper case removed therefrom, showing a state in which functions of pipe are exchanged, and FIG. 4 illustrates a front view of a suction muffler provided to FIG. 3.<br>
[0034] Referring to FIGS. 1 to 4, the compressor includes a hermetic container having a lower case 30 and an upper case (not shown) which forms an outside appearance, and various components held inside of the hermetic container.<br>
[0035] There are mounting plates 32 on an underside of the lower case 30 for fastening the compressor. The lower case 30 has a terminal fitting part 33 at one side of the lower case 30, particularly, at a left side of the lower case 30 in FIG. 2, for supplying power to the compressor.<br>
[0036] There is an inside connector 33a on an inside wall of the lower case 30 opposite to the terminal fitting part 33. A cable is connected to the inside connector 33a for supplying power to an inside of the compressor. In the embodiment, though the terminal fitting part 33 is fitted to a left outside wall of the lower case 30, the terminal fitting part 33 may be fitted to a right outside wall of the lower case 30.<br>
[0037] For making inside and outside of the hermetic container in communication,<br>
there are at least two pipes 34, and 36 passed through the lower case 30. One of pipes 34, and 36 is called as a first pipe 34, and the other pipe is called as a second pipe 36.<br>
[0038] The first pipe 34 and the second pipe 36 are configured to enable<br>
exchange of functions according to design conditions of heat exchange cycle, i.e., positions of an evaporator and a condenser, and one of which functions as a suction pipe for guiding refrigerant into an inside of the hermetic container.<br>
[0039] It is preferable that the hermetic container includes a third pipe 38<br>
in addition to the first pipe 34 and the second pipe 36. Because, basically, in addition to a suction pipe for guiding the refrigerant into the hermetic container, and a discharge pipe for guiding compressed refrigerant to an outside of the hermetic container, it is preferable that the compressor has a process pipe for filling oil into the compressor.<br>
[0040] In more detail, one of the two pipes excluding the pipe functioning<br>
as the suction pipe functions as a discharge pipe, and the other pipe functions as the process pipe.<br>
[0041] If it is assumed that a part the terminal fitting part 33 is provided<br>
thereto is a side of the lower case 30, the first pipe 34 and the second pipe 36 pass a part between front and opposite sides of the lower case 30. The third pipe 38 passes an opposite side of a side the terminal fitting part 33 is provided thereto.<br>
[0042] In the embodiment, one of the first pipe 34 and the second pipe 36<br>
functions as the suction pipe according to design conditions of the heat exchange cycle, and the other one functions as the process pipe. That is, if the first pipe is used as a suction pipe, the second, pipe is used as the process pipe, and vice versa. The third pipe 38 performs a function of the discharge pipe.<br>
[0043] There is a frame 40 inside of the lower case<br>
30 for fitting various components of a compression part for<br>
drawing, compressing, and discharge of refrigerant, and a driving part<br><br>
for driving the compression part.<br>
[0044] The driving part includes a motor part having a stator 42 fixed to an underside of the frame 40, and a rotor 43 provided inside of the stator 42. There is a crankshaft 45 press fit at a center of the rotor 43 passed through the frame 40, for rotating by electro-magnetic action between the rotor 43 and the stator 42, together with the rotor 43.<br>
[0045] There is a crank pin 46 on the crankshaft 45 eccentric from a rotation axis of the crankshaft 45. The crank pin 46 has other end connected to a connecting rod 48 having one end connected to a piston 50. The connecting rod 48 converts rotation of the crankshaft 45 into a linear reciprocating movement of the piston 50.<br>
[0046] The piston 50 is inside of a cylinder 52 fixed to one side of top of the frame 40, forms a compression chamber for compressing the refrigerant, and functions for compressing the refrigerant. That is, the piston 50 reciprocates inside of the cylinder linearly, to compress the refrigerant.<br>
[0047] There is a valve assembly 54 at one side of the compression chamber of the cylinder 52. The valve assembly 54 has head cover 58 fabricated as one unit therewith, for isolating the refrigerant being drawn into the compression chamber from the refrigerant being discharged from the compression chamber.<br>
[0048] The valve assembly 54 having the head cover 58 fabricated as one unit therewith isolates the refrigerant being drawn into the compression chamber from the refrigerant being discharged from the compression chamber.<br>
[0049] In the meantime, there is a suction muffler 60 at one side the head cover 58. The suction muffler 60, provided for attenuating noise of the refrigerant drawn into the compression chamber from an outside of the hermetic container, has a suction hole 62 for receiving the refrigerant from an outside of the suction muffler 60.<br>
[0050] In more detail, the suction muffler 60 has a suction hole 62 projected outwardly from one side, and a discharge hole 63 at a top thereof connected to the head cover 58 for discharging the refrigerant toward the compression chamber.<br>
[0051] In the embodiment, the suction hole 62 of the suction muffler is connected to a pipe functioning as the suction pipe of the first pipe 34 and the second pipe 36 provided to the hermetic container. That is, in the compressor shown in FIG 1, the first pipe is connected to the suction hole of the suction muffler, such that the first pipe functions as the suction pipe, and in the compressor shown in FIG3, the second pipe is connected to the suction hole of the suction muffler, such that the second pipe functions as the suction pipe.<br>
[0052] For this, the suction muffler 60 is mounted inside of the lower case 30, particularly, opposite to a position between the first pipe 34 and the second pipe. Since the suction muffler 60 is mounted close to the cylinder 52, the cylinder 52 is also mounted inside of the lower case between the first pipe 34 and the second pipe.<br>
[0053] For using the first pipe 34 or the second pipe 36 as the suction pipe 36 according to design conditions of the heat exchange cycle, the suction muffler 60 has a suction hole 62 at a left side or right side when the drawing is seen from above. Of course, the suction muffler 60 may exchange functions of the pipes by changing connection between the suction hole and the pipes by using flexible connection pipes (not shown) provided separately without changing a position of the suction hole.<br>
[0054] In more detail, referring to FIG 1, in a case it is required that the first pipe is used as the suction pipe according to design conditions of the heat exchange cycle, the suction hole 62a of the suction muffler is extended to a left as shown in FIG 2, to opposite to an inside end of the first pipe. As shown in FIG 3, in a case it is required that second pipe is used as the suction pipe according to design conditions of the heat exchange cycle, as shown in FIG<br>
10<br>
4, the suction hole 62b of the suction muffler is extended to a right, to opposite to an inside end of the second pipe.<br>
[0055] Next, there is a discharge muffler 65 at the other side of the head cover 58 for attenuating noise of the discharged refrigerant. That is, the discharge muffler 65 serves to remove noise and pulsation of the working fluid compressed at the compression chamber. The discharge muffler 65 is made to be in communication with a pipe that serves as a discharge pipe by a loop pipe 67. In the embodiment, the discharge muffler is in communication with the third pipe 38.<br>
[0056] The loop pipe 67 connected between the discharge muffler 65 and the third pipe 38 is fabricated by bending a length of pipe many times, for attenuating pulsation and noise of the refrigerant compressed at the compression chamber and discharged therefrom.<br>
[0057] Thus, in the one embodiment of the present invention, though functions of the pipes 34, 36, and 38 connected to the lower case 30 are configured to be interchangeable, even if functions of the pipes are changed, there is no design change of configuration except the suction muffler 60.<br>
[0058] In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, since the suction muffler is provided between the first pipe and the second pipe, an inside space for mounting the power supply device including the inside connector 33a on the terminal fitting part becomes greater, relatively.<br>
[0059] Because a space between the lower case 30 and the suction muffler is the smallest as the suction muffler 60 is arranged projected the outer most among components of the compressor for connected to the first pipe or the second pipe 36.<br>
[0060] In the meantime, it is preferable that the hermetic container has entire surface formed as curved surface. As described, the hermetic container has the upper case and the<br><br>
lower case, and FIG. 5 or 6 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the upper case of the hermetic container.<br>
[0061] Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, the upper case 40 is provided to a top of the lower case 30, such that the upper case 40 and the lower case 30 form an upper half and a lower half of the hermetic container 20, to form the hermetic container with a curved surface in overall, to have a structure of a reinforced strength.<br>
[0062] The upper case 70 has a side surface part 71 and an upper surface part 73. The side surface part 71 and the upper surface part 73 are curved respectively. A curvature of the upper surface part 73 is relatively greater than the side surface part 71.<br>
[0063] The upper surface part 73 is a curved surface sloped downward from a left side to a right side, slightly. Such a curved surface of the upper surface part 73 increases strength of the part, relatively.<br>
[0064] The upper surface part 73 at a relatively high part of the upper case 70 that forms an upper outside appearance of the compressor has a relatively great strength by a supporting force of the side surface part 71, and can endure relatively high external force owing to the curved surface of the upper surface part 73, thereby protect the inside components, because the curved surface of the upper surface part 73 spreads an external impact. This is similar to a case of a tunnel of which upper part is curved.<br>
[0065] An extent of strength increase owing to the curved surface 73 of the upper case 70 is illustrated in FIG. 7.<br>
[0066] Referring to FIG 7, a solid line denotes a natural frequency of a case the upper case 70 described above is applied to the compressor, and the dashed line denotes a case the upper case of the related art is applied to the compressor.<br>
[0067] That is, it can be noted that a case the upper case 70 of the present invention is<br><br>
applied to the compressor has a relatively high natural frequency, in a range approx. 1.3 times of the related art, substantially.<br>
[0068] The upper case 70 has a plurality of recesses 75 into an inside of the case when seen from an outside of the upper case 70, and projected from the upper case 70 when seen from an inside of the upper case 70. The recesses 75 not only functions to increase strength of the hermetic container, but also functions as a stopper that prevents the inside components from shaking excessively, to minimize shaking of the inside components.<br>
[0069] It is preferable that the recesses are formed at a part the side surface part 71 and the upper surface part 73 of the upper case meet. Though the embodiment illustrates three recesses 75, a number of the recesses 75 are not necessarily 3, but it is preferable that at least two of the recesses 75 are formed at opposite positions according to design conditions of the inside components. For an example, since a direction of vibration of the frame can be the same with the reciprocating direction of the piston 50, it is preferable that the recesses 75 are formed at opposite ends of the reciprocating direction of the piston.<br>
[0070] The operation of the compressor of the present invention will be described, in detail.<br>
[0071] In the compressor shown in FIG. 1, the refrigerant is drawn from an outside of the compressor through a first pipe 34, and flows to the suction muffler 60 through the suction hole 62. Then, the refrigerant is introduced into the compression chamber of the cylinder through the valve assembly 54 in a state noise of the refrigerant is reduced at the suction muffler 60.<br>
[0072] The refrigerant compressed at the compression chamber by the piston is discharged to an inside of the head cover 56, and flows into the discharge muffler 65, and involved in attenuation of pulsation and noise thereof. The refrigerant flows from the<br><br>
discharge muffler 65 to the third pipe 38 that functions as a discharge pipe through the loop pipe 67, and is guided to an outside of the compressor.<br>
[0073] In the meantime, the piston 50 coupled to the crankshaft 45, rotated by electromagnetic interaction between the rotor 43 and the stator 42 of the motor part, with the connecting rod 48 reciprocates linearly, and compresses the refrigerant.<br>
[0074] Next, in the compressor illustrated in FIG 3, only the suction muffler 60 is changed while other components are mounted the same with a state illustrated in FIG. 1 without design change such the second pipe 36 functions as the suction pipe, and the first pipe 34 functions as the process pipe.<br>
[0075] In the present invention, since the inside connector 33a is arranged at a position perpendicular to a position the cylinder 52 and an inside surface of the lower case 30 are opposite, a worker can connect the motor part and the inside connector 33a more easily, and since the third pipe 38 is arranged at an opposite side of the inside connector 33a, the connection between the third pipe 38 and the loop pipe 67 is also easy.<br>
[0076] The overall curved shape of the hermetic container and the stoppers on the upper case 70 reinforces strength and prevents damage of the inside components.<br>
[0077] The compressor of the present invention has the following advantages.<br>
[0078] First, when the suction muffler is changed, functions of the pipes in the lower case can be used selectively, thereby dispensing with requirement for design change of the compressor in a heat exchange cycle.<br>
[0079] Second, the larger space between a configuration for supplying power to an inside of the compressor and an inside configuration fastened to the frame permits an easy connection for supply power.<br>
[0080] Third, the larger space between an inside wall of the hermetic container and<br><br>
the frame at a part the discharge pipe is connected to the loop pipe permits an easy connection of the loop pipe to the discharge pipe.<br>
[0081] Fourth, the overall curved surface of the hermetic container, and the stoppers in the upper case for minimizing shaking of the inside components permits reinforcement of strength, and prevents damage of the inside components.<br>
[0082] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
