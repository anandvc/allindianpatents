				<td>Process for Reduction of Bromine Index in Aromatics<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for reduction of bromine index in aromatics production<br>
plants. Specifically, this invention relates to the arrangement of clay treaters used<br>
with distillation columns for the reduction of bromine index in BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene)<br>
production plants.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
For use and further processing aromatics, such as benzene, toluene and xylene, have to be as<br>
pure as possible. One of the main issues regarding aromatics quality is the bromine index of<br>
aromatic products, which is defined as the number of milligrams of bromine that will react<br>
with trace olefins present in a 100 grams of an aromatics sample. The determination of the<br>
bromine index is an indication of the relative amount of olefins and diolefms, which are double-<br>
bounded straight-chain or cyclic hydrocarbons. Usually, a maximum bromine index of 10<br>
is, e.g., required for benzene produced for a conversion into ethyl benzene. Generally, to reduce<br>
bromine index aromatics mixture is passed through clay or catalyst bed of alumina/silica<br>
in the liquid phase at high temperature and pressure, where a reaction occurs and the olefins<br>
are alkylated with a portion of the aromatic compounds forming heavier aromatics with more<br>
than 10 carbon atoms.<br>
It is well known in the prior art that clay is used to alkylate or polymerize olefins in aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons followed by distillating in distillation columns to remove the polymers from<br>
column bottoms, as, for example, described in US 2,778,863 and 3,485,884. The aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon mixture described can contain some or all of the following compounds: benzene,<br>
toluene, xylene, olefins and diolefms which could be produced from thermal cracking of<br>
naphtha and gas oil or from LPG cyclar process or any other process. It is known from the<br>
prior art that clay treater life will decline with time due to clay deactivation depending on the<br>
amount and type of olefins and diolefms in the feed and clay reaction temperature.<br>
US 6,315,964 discloses the production of linear alkyl benzenes (LAB) and points out that the<br>
presence of longer chain olefms compared to shorter chain olefins during clay alkylation reactions<br>
may lead to the formation of carbonaceous deposits and heavy organics in the clay<br>
bed. The presence and accumulation of water in the catalyst bed is also deleterious to catalyst<br>
activity which can form in-side reactions during alkylation or can be present in the inlet feed.<br>
One of the main disadvantages in the prior art is that clay is exposed fully or partly to the<br>
aromatics feed with the various types of olefins chain length that can deactivate the catalyst<br>
bed quickly, especially if their concentrations are high. Also, the presence of high concentration<br>
of other impurities, such as heavy aromatics, nitrogen and sulfur compounds can lead to a<br>
much shorter clay life.<br>
As a result, clay or catalyst bed upstream of distillation columns have an average service life<br>
of at best a few weeks depending on olefins and impurities concentrations and therefore have<br>
to be replaced frequently with fresh clay when bromine index in the distillate aromatic stream<br>
product exceeds the allowed level. This frequent replacement imposes financial as well as<br>
environmental burden on the process. Additionally, it demands extra labor time resources,<br>
which could be put in more useful use elsewhere in the production plant.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to overcome the disadvantages of the prior<br>
art, especially to provide a process for reduction of bromine index maintaining longer clay life<br>
while also maintaining low bromine index in the aromatic distillate product, such as benzene.<br>
The object of the present invention is achieved by a process for reduction of bromine index ir.<br>
aromatics, comprising the steps of:<br>
(I) feeding an aromatics feed stream to a distillation column;<br>
(II) subjecting the aromatics feed stream to a distillation process;<br>
(III) withdrawing an overhead stream and/or a product stream from the column;<br>
(IV) subjecting at least a part of the overhead stream and/or the product stream to a<br>
treatment in a clay treater; and<br>
(V) re-injecting an outlet stream of the clay treater to the aromatics feed stream.<br>
Preferably the aromatics feed stream is fed to the distillation column at a tray about half way<br>
up the distillation column.<br>
Particularly preferred is that the withdrawn overhead stream is collected in a receiver and any<br>
free water is collected in a water boot in the receiver.<br>
In one embodiment one part of the withdrawn overhead stream is sent back to the distillation<br>
column as reflux.<br>
It is preferred that another drag part of the withdrawn overhead stream is removed from the<br>
receiver and passed over the clay treater.<br>
More preferred is that a smaller part of the withdrawn overhead stream is passed over the clay<br>
treater as drag stream.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention the withdrawn overhead stream is cooled<br>
and preferably condensed in a heat exchanger prior to being collected in the receiver.<br>
Still preferred is a process, wherein the condensed drag stream is, prior to entering the clay<br>
treater, heated in a heat exchanger and pressurized.<br>
Preferably the aromatics feed stream comprises benzene, toluene, xylene, heavy aromatics,<br>
olefins, diolefmes and the like.<br>
More preferred is that the aromatics feed stream is fed to the distillation column with a bromine<br>
index of about 300 to about 1000, preferably about 500 to about 700.<br>
According to the invention benzene distillate is a product stream withdrawn as side cut at a<br>
tray higher than the aromatics feed stream location.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention heat is supplied to the distillation column by a reboiler at<br>
the column bottom by heating up a bottom stream having left the distillation column and being<br>
of least partly re-introduced.<br>
It is preferred that the bottom stream comprises toluene, xylene and heavier olefines and aromatics.<br>
Still preferred is that the aromatics feed stream is fed to the distillation column at a temperature<br>
of about 50 to about 100°C preferably of about 75 to about 90°C, and a pressure of about<br>
1 to about 10 barg, preferably about 1 to about 5 barg.<br>
According to a further embodiment the bottom stream leaves the column at a temperature of<br>
about 120 to about 170°C, preferably 130 to about 150°C, and the product stream leaves the<br>
column at a temperature of about 75 to about 100°C, preferably about 85°C to about 95°C.<br>
In a further process of the invention the withdrawn overhead stream comprises about 97%<br>
benzene and has a bromine index of about 250 to about 350, preferably about 300 to about<br>
320.<br>
Moreover a process is preferred, wherein the drag stream of the withdrawn overhead stream to<br>
be subjected in the clay treater is removed with a flow rate of about 0,01-0.10 preferably<br>
about 0.03-0.05 of reflux flow rate, the low rate being the ratio of the flow rate of the drag<br>
stream to the flow rate of the reflux stream.<br>
Still preferred is a process, wherein the drag stream to be subjected in the clay treater is<br>
treated in the clay treater at a temperatur of about 150 to about 200°C, preferably 170 to about<br>
180°C, and a pressure of about 10 to about 20 barg, preferably about 14 to about 16 barg.<br>
Further, the process of the invention may be characterized in that the product stream comprises<br>
more than 99,90 wt.-% benzene and has a bromine index of about 5 to about 15, preferably<br>
about 8 to about 10.<br>
Moreover, it is preferred that a further clay treater is placed upstream the distillation column.<br>
It is further preferred that during a change over procedure at the end of service life an active<br>
downstream clay treater is used in place of deactivated upstream clay treater.<br>
Finally, it is preferred that the product stream is as processed as the overhead stream.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that by the process according to the present invention the bromine<br>
index of a product stream of the distillation columns in an aromatics production plant are<br>
lowered to the desired level, wherein at the same time the service life of the clay treater used<br>
within that process is drastically increased in comparison to the prior art processes. This is<br>
due to the fact that not the complete aromatics feed is passed through the clay heater, but only<br>
a smaller part of the withdrawn overhead stream of the column is subjected to the clay treater.<br>
The aromatics with low bromine index already treated in the clay treater is mixed with the<br>
aromatics feed stream, so that the bromine index of the side cut aromatics distillate product<br>
stream will decrease reaching the required level. Also, as the withdrawn overhead stream<br>
continuously removes accumulated olefins in the reflux stream, this will keep the bromine<br>
index of the aromatics product stable. At the same time, since the clay treater is exposed to a<br>
clean stream of only one aromatic product, such as benzene, with close boiling olefins, the<br>
clay will not be contaminated quickly in comparison with the prior art, where it is exposed to<br>
the main aromatic stream mixture of column feed. For example, in benzene distillation columns,<br>
benzene is usually produced as a side cut stream above the feed tray while toluene and<br>
higher boiling diolefms and olefins are withdrawn from the column bottom. Lighter olefms<br>
and close boiling olefins to benzene accumulate in the reflux stream at the top of the column<br>
and are traditionally removed from the system in a small drag stream. According to the present<br>
invention, it is proposed, to treat the reflux stream at the top of the column, which contains<br>
mainly benzene and close boiling olefms, which accumulate in the reflux giving high bromine<br>
index, in a ciay treater. This is achieved by passing the reflux drag stream at a sufficient flow<br>
rate to the clay treater at its designed temperature and pressure. The outlet stream from the<br>
clay treater will contain a low bromine index with olefm-alkylated heavy aromatics, the concentration<br>
of which will depend on the bromine index in the reflux drag. The treated stream is<br>
then re-injected into the aromatics feed stream of the distillation column, so that the heavy<br>
aromatics may be removed from the column bottom.<br>
A further advantage of the process of the present invention is the value added cost of recovering<br>
benzene reflux drag that is considered as waste or an off specification product which is<br>
sold at low market price. An additional feature of this invention is the high purity product<br>
obtained without having a polishing column downstream to remove polymerized product. For<br>
example placing a clay treater downstream of a distillation column to reduce a distillate<br>
stream of benzene with bromine index from 70 to 0 by treating close boiling olefins will lead<br>
to the formation of heavy alkylated aromatics of about 700 weight ppm of aromatics with<br>
more than 11 carbon atoms in the benzene final product which will require another polishing<br>
column to maintain product quality. Another feature of the process according to the invention<br>
is that the returned flow of the treated reflux drag stream to the column feed does not constitute<br>
an overburden of the column capacity due to its small flow rate.<br>
The invention is now being described more fully in the following detailed description and the<br>
following drawing, wherein<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of the process according to the present invention; and<br>
Figure 2 is a graph showing the effect of drag on the bromine index of the aromatics product.<br>
In the following, the process according to the present invention is explained in detail for a<br>
process using a distillation column to obtain benzene as the desired product. As apparent for<br>
someone skilled in the art, the process according to the present invention may be also utilized<br>
for other aromatics distillation columns, such as for toluene and xylene.<br>
According to figure 1, an aromatics feed stream, comprising benzene, toluene, xylene and<br>
heavy aromatics together with accompanying olefins and diolefins, is fed via line 1 to a benzene<br>
distillation column 2 at a tray halfway up the distillation column 2. Heat is supplied to<br>
the column 2 by a reboiler 3 at column bottom by heating up the bottom stream leaving the<br>
column via line 4 that comprises toluene, xylene and heavier olefins and aromatics, and reintroducing<br>
at least a part of the bottom stream into the column bottom. Benzene distillate is<br>
withdrawn as side cut via line 5 at a tray higher than the feed location. An overhead stream is<br>
withdrawn via line 6from the column 2 and cooled in a heat exchanger 7, and the condensate<br>
is collected in a receiver 8. Any free water is collected in a water boot 9 in the receiver 8. The<br>
return flow is sent back to the column 2 as reflux via line 10. A part of the withdrawn overhead<br>
stream, a drag stream, is withdrawn from the receiver 8 and is passed to a heat exchanger<br>
12 via line 11, where it is pressurized and heated to a temperature suitable for a clay treatei<br>
13. The drag stream is passed through the clay treater 13, the olefins are alkylated to heavier<br>
alkyl aromatics having more than 10 carbon atoms. The outlet stream of the clay treater 13 is<br>
fed back via line 14 to the column 2 and re-injected with the aromatics feed stream. Heavy<br>
alkylated aromatics may leave the column bottom in the bottom stream via line 4 with other<br>
heavy components, while treated pure benzene product stream leaves with the distillate<br>
stream via line 5 and lower bromine index due to a dilution effect.<br>
Of course, the clay treater may further comprise silica-alumina. Additionally, the process of<br>
the invention may comprise a further clay treater upstream the distillation column, which arrangement<br>
is particularly suitable for a high bromine index of aromatics BTX stream, i.e. an<br>
index in excess of 600. During change over procedure at the end of service life in this arrangement,<br>
relatively active downstream clay treater can be used in place of the deactivated<br>
upstream clay traeter. A fresh clay charge is then placed for the downstream clay treater.<br>
Further, it is possible according to the invention that the overhead stream and/or the product<br>
stream, e.g. benzene, may be treated in the clay treater 13.<br>
The invention is now further illustrated by way of experimental results. An aromatic feed<br>
stream of BTX comprising olefins with a bromine index of 560 is fed to a distillation column<br>
2 at 82°C and a pressure of 2 barg. The heavy aromatics stream leaves the column bottom at a<br>
temperature of 142°C and the distillate product stream of benzene leaves the distillation column<br>
2 at a temperature of 92°C. The overhead stream contains 97% benzene and the balance<br>
is saturated hydrocarbons and olefms with bromine index of 312 in the reflux. A small drag<br>
stream of the withdrawn overhead stream is removed from the system with a flow rate of<br>
about 0.03-0.05 of reflux flow rate. The drag stream is treated by feeding it into the clay<br>
treater 13 at a temperature of 175°C and a pressure of about 15 barg. The outlet stream of the<br>
clay treater 13 is combined with the aromatics feed stream and is re-injected into the distillation<br>
column 2. The benzene product bromine index is in the range of about 8 to about 10 with<br>
purity of 99,94%, compared with a bromine index of 30-33 with benzene purity of 99,91%<br>
without applying the process of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows the effect of increasing the drag stream flow rate in reflux stream against the<br>
olefin content in the product stream relative to that in the feed to the benzene column. It can<br>
be seen that for a constant amount of olefms content in the feed to the benzene column, the<br>
olefin content in the product stream decreases as the ratio of drag/reflux flow increases. A<br>
regression curve has been fitted to the data points to indicate the overall trend.<br>
The features disclosed in the foregoing description, the claims and the drawings may, both<br>
separately and in any combination thereof be material for realizing the invention in diverse<br>
