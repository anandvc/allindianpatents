BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chemicals derived from biomass feedstock are bringing the world on a sustainable platform. Carbohydrate feedstock has a remarkable opportunity to act as a future renewable biomass resource for substituting petroleum feedstock. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) obtained from carbohydrate serve as a prospective building block.<br>
5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) produced from renewable resources act as platform chemical because of the wide range of the chemical intermediates and end products is produced from these compounds which used in the polymer industry, fuel and pharmaceutical industries. HMF possesses a high potential industrial demand, and is reviewed as a sleeping giant to produce intermediate chemical from bio based renewable resources. HMF is versatile chemical compound; however, no technical process has been constructed through sugar route till now. The reasons are low selectivity to HMF, requirement of strong acids, which requires neutralization and lead to large amount of acid waste. The high boiling polar solvents like dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide,<br><br>
acetonitrile, poly(glycol ether) etc. give good selectivity to HMF but makes separation process most expensive.<br>
WO 012445 A1 disclose a method of producing HMF by mixing or agitating an aqueous solution of fructose and inorganic acid catalyst with water immiscible organic solvent to form an emulsion. The mixture is heated to 240 °C to 270 °C in a flow reactor at high pressure and then separated into aqueous and organic phase to obtain HMF.<br>
US 313889Al disclose the process for making hydroxymethylfurfural from saccharide. A metal complex of an N-heterocyclic Darbine and ionic liquid is used. Reaction mixture contains solvent immiscible with ionic liquid to extract 5-hydroxymethylfurfuraI from ionic liquid.<br>

The aqueous reaction solution contains an acid catalyst. Both aqueous solution and organic extraction solution contain at least one modifier such as dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone, acetonitrile, butyrolactone, dioxane and pyrrolidinone.<br>
US 033I87A1 disclose the process for converting carbohydrate to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in the presence of metal halide and acid catalyst. In this process ionic liquids are used as solvent to dissolve carbohydrates.<br>

fructose source and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is prepared by using ion exchange resin in presence of l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, dimethyl acetamide, dimethylformamide and combinations.<br>
US 4590283A disclose the process for manufacturing 5-hydroxymethyfurfural from hexose by heterogeneous catalyst comprising of strong acid cation exchange resin. This process is carried out continuously, particularly by the countercurrent principle. Strongly polar aprotic solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, are used, this makes product isolation tedious and costly.<br>

HMF yield was 38.1 % and fructose conversion was 83.6% for 5 min reaction time in presence of TiO2 catalyst was achieved. While HMF yield of 30.5% for fructose conversion of 65% was obtained for 5 min reaction time in presence of ZrO2. But these catalysts are suffered with poor reusability.<br>

Mineral acid catalysts are give high fructose conversion with low selectivity to HMF yield and major disadvantage is corrosion of reactor, separation of the product and large amount of acid waste. Solid acid catalysts, such as H-zeolite and metal phosphates (vanadyl phosphate) give low conversion and low selectivity.

The slurry was filtered and washed with water and dried under vacuum to get the active ICaT-2 catalyst.<br>
EXAMPLE 2-6:<br>
All the reactions are carried out in batch mode operation. The reaction is performed by loading autoclave reactor with fructose (0.025 mol), 100 ml mixture of solvents (acetone and water 7:3) and specific amount of the ICaT-2 catalyst. The reactor is purged with nitrogen and temperature is raised to 160 °C. The experiments are carried out in a 300 cm3 stainless steel Parr autoclave. Reaction mixture is agitated with a four bladed pitch turbine impeller. The reaction temperature is maintained at 160 °C with an accuracy of ± 1 °C by PID controller. Specific amount of ICaT-2 catalyst is added to reaction mixture (mentioned in Table 1). The effect of catalyst loading is studied with respect to variation in the quantity of catalyst (Drawing 1).

EXAMPLE 21-24:<br>
All the reactions are carried out in batch mode operation. The reaction is performed by loading autoclave reactor with fructose (0.025 mol), 100 ml mixture of solvents (acetone :water 7:3) and specific amount of the ICaT-2 catalyst (0.01 gm/cc). The reactor is purged with nitrogen and temperature is raised to 160 °C. The experiments are carried out in a 300 cm   stainless steel Parr autoclave. Reaction mixture is agitated with a four<br><br>
bladed pitch turbine impeller. The reaction temperature is maintained at 160 °C with an accuracy of ± 1 °C by PID controller. The progress of the reaction is monitor on HPLC by using UV and RI detector. Calibration curve method is adopted for calculating percentage conversion and percentage yield quantitatively. The reusability of the catalyst is tested by conducting four runs. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst is filtered and washed with acetone. Then it is refiuxed with 50 cm of acetone for 30 min and dried at 120 °C for 2 h. The reusability of the catalyst is mentioned in these examples (Table 5). Extraction and distillation procedures are employed for isolation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural from the reaction mixture.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 25:<br>
The isolation and purification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is carried out by a process selected from the group consisting of filtration, evaporation, extraction and distillation. Reaction mass is filtered through filter paper to remove solid heterogeneous ICaT-2 catalyst. Catalyst was washed with 50 cm of acetone. Reaction mass is distilled under reduced pressure to remove acetone and then aqueous mother liquor is extracted with 100 X 3 times organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, diethylether, methyl isobutyl ketone, dichloromethane, methyl-tertiary-butyl ether, butyl acetate. Organic layer is dried by using sodium sulfate and distilled under reduced pressure to get pure 98 % HMF.<br><br>
