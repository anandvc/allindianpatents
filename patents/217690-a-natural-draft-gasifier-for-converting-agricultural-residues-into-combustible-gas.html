				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a natural draft gasifier.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Gasification is a partial combustion process where with the controlled air input, biomass like agricultural residues is converted into a combustible gas known as Producer gas (P gas). P gas has two major applications. After cooling and filtration, it can be used together with a small amount of diesel to operate diesel engines. Petrol engines can be operated totally on P gas. Another use of P gas is to generate heat for thermal application by directly burning it. The equipment used for gasification is known as a gasifier.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Basically, the gasifiers can be classified into three types. Forced draft, induced draft, and natural draft, out of which first two are most common. Natural draft based gasifiers work on the principle of chimney effect and generate P gas without needing any artificial draft. It consists of a perforated plate at one end and the P gas pipe having burner at it's top at the other end of the reactor. Inside the gasifier, a grate is provided for the purpose of holding the biomass and filtering the ash which falls in the ash zone. Gasifier is loaded with the biomass from the biomass<br>
loading port which is to be kept closed during the gasifier operation. Biomass is set on fire from the perforated plate side. Gases moves horizontally through the biomass and reach to the burner. The combustion zone also keeps on moving horizontally till the exhaustion of the complete batch of biomass. The drawback of this gasifier is that it can be operated in batch mode only. The design configuration is such that recharging can not be done during operation which makes the existing design unsuitable for applications where thermal energy is required on continuous basis. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a novel construction of a natural draft gasifier.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a natural draft gasifier which obviates the disadvantages associated with those of the prior art.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a natural draft gasifier which is capable of being recharged without causing an interruption in the operation thereof.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a natural draft gasifier which is operable over a wide range of woody biomass fuels as a feedstock.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A natural draft gasifier for converting agricultural residues (biomass) into combustible gas comprising a biomass holder or hopper connected at its lower end to load a reactor with biomass to generate producer gas through combustion, the reactor having a burner at its top, the said residues being supported by a grate at the lower end of the reactor and an air inlet port for introduction of air to support said combustion.<br>
DESCRIPTION WITH REFERENCE TO ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing and wherein Fig.l shows the natural draft gasifier of the present invention.<br>
The gasifier 1 comprises a biomass holder or hopper 2 connected at its lower converging end to the P gas generation section or reactor 3 which has a P gas burning unit or gas burner 4 at its top, ash removal unit or grate 5 at its lower end and an ash pit 6 with gasifier air input port 7 at the bottom.<br>
Biomass hopper 2 is of cylindrical shape and may be fabricated out of sheet metal. Hopper 2 has a lid 2a which can have water, sand or similar material kept in the annular ring provided at its top for sealing purpose. The lower converging section of hopper<br>
  is  connected  to  reactor  3.   The  reactor  is   a cylindrical  shaped  structure made of sheet  metal  and internally lined with heat resistant material such as  a fire  brick lining 8 to withstand high  temperatures  of upto  1000  degrees  celsius.   The  dimensions  of  the reactor i.e. diameter and height are determined based on the rate of gasification needed to achieve the  required P  gas generation rate.  A firing port 9 is provided  on the  lower  side of the reactor through which  with  the help of a burning stick, biomass in side the reactor  is initially  ignited.  Grate unit 5 provided at the  lower end of reactor 3 can be of circular or rectangular shape and  it is made of stainless steel or cast iron  or  any other metal or alloy.  Ash scrapper 10 made of stainless steel  or cast iron is provided with grate which can  be operated   either   manually   or   mechanically.    The dimensions  of grate 5 are such as it's gross  and  open area  are estimated on the basis of the  thermal  energy demand and the thermochemical properties of the  biomass feedstocks.  Ash pit 6 provided below the grate is  made of  sheet  metal  with  internal  lining  of  insulating material.   It's volumetric capacity is decided  on  the basis  of the biomass gasification rate, ash content  of the biomass feedstock and system's operation schedule.<br>
Gasifier air input port 7 is provided at the bottom. Air gets aspirated in from port 7 and it enters into reactor 3 through grate 5. Gasifier air input port 7 is basically a cylindrical pipe. It's one end is connected to the ash pit. The other end is of rotating type and has perforations. This perforated end is suspended in water. Here water acts as a seal. More the perforations are open, more will be the air input rate. Gas generation rate is directly proportional to air input rate. Control mechanism for gasifitr air input port can be of manual, or mechanical type.<br>
Producer gas burner 4 is a cylindrical unit<br>
having it's shell body made of sheet metal. Burner 4<br>
has a burner plate 4a plate of stainless steel or cast<br>
iron and size and number of P gas ports are decided on<br>
the basis of P gas generation rate. Burner 4 is lined<br>
from inside with heat resistant material such as fire<br>
bricks lining 4b and a wool insulation lining 4c from<br>
the outside which can withstand temperatures upto 1200<br>
degrees Celsius. Air swirlers 11 are provided<br>
tangentially above the burner plate from where air<br>
enters tangentially and get mixed with the P gas coming<br>
out from the P gas ports. This P gas burner can be kept<br>
at the top of the reactor or near to it depending on the<br>
type of the application.	•<br>
Initially, biomass is loaded in reactor 3 upto the level. A small amount of kerosene or similar fuel is sprinkled on it and using a burning stick the<br><br>
biomas is set on fire. Initially gasifier air input port is kept open. Within five to ten minutes, a glowing char bed is formed on grate S. Gasifier input air port 7 is then closed and gasifier is completely •filled with biomass. Biomass level in the hopper should not be allowed to go below the lower end of it's cylindrical portion.<br>
Gasifier  air  input  port 7  is  opened.   A<br>
reactions series     of     thermochemical reactons   take     place     in     the<br>
reactor section of the gasifier which form different reaction zones like combustion zone Bl reduction zone B2 pyrolysis zone B3 and drying zone B4. Combustion zone Bl is formed above the grate which generates the heat energy through conversion of some amount of carbon and hydrogen present in the biomass in to carbon dioxide and water vapors respectively. In combustion zone Bl , the temperature varies bet-ween 800 to 1000 deg celsius. Carbon dioxide and water vapours along with other products of combustion zone move upward and get reacted with the hot charcoal bed in the reduction zone section 82, converting carbon dioxide and water vapours intc carbon monoxide and hydrogen respectively. This hot gas mixture then moves upward and form a pryolysis zone B3 where the biomass gets converted into charcoal and generate the combustible gases like methane &amp; hydrogen.<br><br>
8<br>
Above the pyrolysis zone is the biomass drying zone in which the hot P gas at the temperature above 300 deg Celsius moves through the biomass bed, drying it in the process. The wet P gas reaches to the P gas burner.<br>
During the gasifier operation, the whole biomass bed in the gasifier keeps on moving in the down ward direction i.e. raw biomass from the hopper to the drying zone, dried biomass from drying zone to pyrolysis zone, charred biomass from pyrolysis zone to reduction zone, and un converted charcoal to the combustion zone. Ash scrapping unit is required to be operated after certain interval of time to unload the ash in the ash pit. P gas moves upward and goes to the burner. P gas burner as explained in the preceeding paragraph, is of air swirling type. P gas enters in the combustion chamber through gas ports and gets mixed with the swirling air entering from the tangentially placed air ports of the burner. Arrangement is also made to provide control on the burner air input rate. P gas generation rate is controlled by varying the Gasifier air input port opening. More the gasifier air input port area open, more will be the P gas generation rate.<br>
The main aim of this invention is to provide a natural draft gasifier which can be recharged without interrupting operation and capable of accepting the wide range of woody biomass fuels in terms of physical and chemical properties as the feedstocks for generation of P gas.<br><br><br><br>
