				<td>New compounds for the inhibition of angiogenesis and use thereof<br>
4  	<br>
The present invention is related to new compounds and the use of said compounds for the manufacture of medicaments and diagnostics.<br>
Angiogenesis, also called neovascularization, is a fundamental process whereby new blood vessels are formed. Under normal physiological conditions angiogenesis is highly regulated and essential for reproduction, embryonic development and wound healing (Folkman and Shing, 1992, JBC, 267, 10931). However angiogenesis also occurs under various pathological conditions, including ocular neovascularization such as in diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degeneration and various other eye diseases, inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and tumor growth and metastasis (Folkman and Shing, 1992, JBC, 267,10931).<br>
During neovascular disorders in cancer newly formed blood vessels provide the tumor cells with oxygen and nutrients which are necessary for further growth above l-2mm3 and form a gateway for tumor cells to enter the circulation and to metastasize to distant sites of the body (Folkman and Shing, 1992, JBC, 267,10931).<br>
During ocular neovascular disorders the pathological growth of new blood vessels cause the loss of vision. The leading cause of blindness in individuals over the age of 65 is the age related macular degeneration (AMD), characterized by the growth of new blood vessels from the choroid, which remain beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), or breach the RPE and enter the subretinal space, leading to hemorrhage, detachment of RPE and formation of subretinal scars followed by blindness (Ambati, 2003, Survey of Ophthalmology, 48, 257). The leading cause of blindness in individuals under the age of 55 years is proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), whereby retinal blood vessels proliferate along the surface of the retina and into the posterior vitreous due to ischaemic stimuli (Klein, 1994, Arch Ophthalmol. 112, Friedlander, 1996, PNAS, 93, 9764).<br>
Angiogenesis is also associated with inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and others. The influx of lymphocytes into the inflammatory region stimulates angiogenesis and following this, the increased vasculature enables a greater influx of leukocytes, which promote the inflammatory process, such as destruction of cartilage and bone in the joint during arthritis.<br>
Angiogenesis is a highly regulated process which occurs in response to various proangiogenic stimuli like growth factors, cytokines and other physiological molecules as well as other factors like hypoxia and low pH (Folkman and Shing, 1992, JBC, 267, 10931). The angiogenic cascade for development of new blood vessels requires the cooperation of a variety of molecules that regulate necessary cellular processes such as extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, invasion, migration, proliferation, differentiation and tube formation (Brooks, 1996, Eur. J. Cancer, 32A, 2423). After an initiation phase proangiogenic molecules like VEGF, bFGF, PDGF and others activate endothelial cells via stimulation of their cell surface receptors (for example VEGFRl-Flt-1 and VEGFR2-Flkl/KDR). These activated cells undergo a process of cellular proliferation, elevated expression of cell adhesion molecules, increased secretion of proteolytic enzymes and increased cellular migration and invasion. A number of distinct molecules are involved to promote proliferation and invasion, including members of the integrin, selectin and immunoglobulin gene super family for adhesion as well as proteolytic enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases and serine proteinases for degrading the ECM (Brooks, 1996, Eur. J. Cancer, 32A, 2423). Finally, a complex cascade of biochemical signals derived from cell surface receptors interacting with ECM components and soluble factors, leading to lumen formation and differentiation into mature blood vessels.<br><br>
Inhibition of different molecules involved in the angiogenic cascade has been shown to be active in inhibition of angiogenesis and treatment of neovascular diseases in animal models and clinical studies (Madhusudan, 2002, Curr. Op. Pharm., 2, 403; Folkman, 2001, Thromb Haemost, 86, 23; Eyetech Study Group, 2003, Ophthalmology, 110, 979; Ferrara, 2002, Semin Oncol. 6 Suppl 16,10) for cancer and age related macular degeneration (AMD). Most of these angiogenic inhibitors are directed towards blocking the initial growth factor mediated activation step induced by VEGF or PDGF. These approaches target only one molecule of the multiple set of pro-angiogenic stimuli. However, angiogenesis takes place in response to various growth factors such as VEGF, bFGF, PDGF and others (Folkman and Shing, 1992, JBC, 267, 10931). Therefore, a more general approach for inhibiting angiogenesis due to this variety of stimuli would be more beneficial.<br>
Inhibition of cell adhesion to the ECM, the fundamental step for activation, survival, targeting and migration of activated endothelial cells (EC), is the most promising target mechanism for anti-angiogenesis. Most of these interactions are mediated by integrins, a family of multifunctional cell adhesion receptors.<br>
Members of the integrin family are non-covalently associated alpha/beta heterodimers that mediate cell-cell, cell-extracellular matrix and cell-pathogene interactions. These type I transmembrane proteins are expressed on a variety of cells and require bivalent cations for their physiological function. Until now, 19 different integrin alpha subunits and 8 different beta subunits are known that combine to form at least 25 different alpha/beta heterodimers with different ligand specificity. The ligands for the extracellular domain of many integrins are the proteins of the extracellular matrix, whereby mostly a consensus motif with the amino acid sequence RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate) is recognized. The intracellular domains of the integrins are either directly or indirectly connected to intracellular components such as kinases and the cytoskeleton. Integrins serve as bidirectional signalling receptors, whereby protein activities and gene expression are changed by integrins in response to ligand binding to the extracellular domain thereof, which is also referred to as outside-in signalling. On the other hand, the affinity of the integrins is modulated in response to intracellular changes such as binding of proteins to the intracellular domain of the integrin, which is referred to as inside-out signalling (Humphries, 2000, Biochem. Soc. Trans., 28, 311; Hynes, 2002, Cell 110, 673).<br>
A multitude of studies on the integrin pattern on activated endothelial cells, mice gene knockouts and inhibition studies in angiogenic animal models with antibodies, peptides and small molecules provided information about the integrins and ECM proteins involved in critical steps of angiogenesis (Brooks, 1994, Science, 264, 569; Brooks, 1996, Eur. J. Cancer, 32A, 2423; Mousa, 2002, Curr. Opin. Chem Biol, 6, 534; Hynes, 2002, Cell, 110, 673; Hynes, 2002, Nature Medicine, 8, 918; Kim, 2000, Am. J. Path., 156, 1345). Thereby it becomes clear that above all the vitronectin receptors alphavbeta3, alphavbetaS and the fibronectin receptor alphaSbetal play a critical role in angiogenesis. Gene deletion studies of integrins attributed essential roles for almost all integrins. The deletion driven defects suggest widespread contributions of the various integrins to both the maintenance of tissue integrity and the promotion of cellular migration. But only the deletion of alphaS and betal and its ligand fibronectin, leads to embryogenic lethality with major vascular effects, whereas ablation of alphav, beta3 and betaS genes fail to block angiogenesis and in some cases even enhance angiogenesis (Hynes, 2002, Nature Medicine, 8, 918).<br>
Additionally, experimental studies established a fundamental role of alphaSbetal in the regulation of alphavbeta3 mediated angiogenesis (Kim, 2000, JBC, 275, 33920).<br>
Only alphaSbetal genetic and pharmacological data are consistent and confirm the fundamental role of alphaSbetal for angiogenesis. Therefore, alphaSbetal should be the preferred target for the development of anti-angiogenic drugs. Consequently, antagonists of integrin alphaSbetal have a great therapeutic potential for the treatment of neovascularization in tumors, in the eye and of inflammatory processes.<br><br>
Several other diseases also involve integrin mediated effects and processes, such as in atherosclerosis progression and restenosis. Particularly, angiogenesis and migration are the critical features of plaque development during atherosclerosis (Hoshiga, 1995, Circ. Res. 77, 1129) and undesired vascular repair processes in vessels of atherosclerotic patients cause coronary restenosis (Panda, 1997, PNAS, 94, 9308). An integrin mediated eye disease is proliferative vitreoretinopathy with pathological proliferation of retinal pigment epithelium cells (Proulx, 2003, Molecular Vision, 9, 473).<br>
There is a lot of evidence suggesting a central role for alphaSbetal in angiogenesis, e.g. mice knockout data. Thus, genetic ablation of either of the monomers of alphaSbetal leads to embryonic lethality with major vascular defects (Hynes, 2002, Nature Medicine, 8, 918). Additionally, alphaSbetal is poorly expressed in quiescent endothelium but strongly expressed in proliferating endothelium. Its expression is significantly upregulated on blood vessels in human tumors and after stimulation with growth factors (Kim, 2000, Am. J. Path, 156, 1345; Collo, 1999, J. Cell Sc., 112, 569). Once expressed, alphaSbetal regulates the survival and migration of endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo (Kim, 2002, J. Clin. Invest., 110, 933; Kim, 2000, JBC, 275, 33920). Angiogenesis induced by multiple growth factors in several models was blocked with alphaSbetal antagonists (Varner, 1998, 98 (suppl), 1-795, 4166; Kim, 2000, Am. J. Path, 156,1345). Additionally, these antagonists also inhibit tumor angiogenesis, thereby causing regression of human tumors in animal models (Kim, 2000, Am. J. Path, 156,1345).<br>
Given the importance of integrins in angiogenesis, serious efforts have been undertaken to develop inhibitors thereto.<br>
There are at least three major classes of reagents developed as integrin, especially alphaSbetal integrin antagonists. These include antibodies such as monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, and antibody fragments (Kim, 2000, Am. J. Path., 156, 1345), natural peptides such as venom derived "disintegrin" peptides (Marcinkiewicz, 1999, Biochemistry, 38, 13302), synthetic peptides (Koivunen, 1994, JBC, 124, 373) and non-peptidic small molecules such as spiro compounds (WO97/33887).<br>
Although these compounds are in principle suitable as alphaSbetal antagonists, they have some drawbacks. For example, antibodies are complex biological molecules with usually high activity and specificity for the targeted molecule. But the mainly non-human source of antibodies could cause an immune response during later treatment of humans or the molecules have to be humanized with special additional procedures. Additionally, the human immune system could develop antibodies against the antigen binding region of the therapeutic antibody (anti-idiotypic antibodies). The development of an immune response against the therapeutic antibody could cause immunological problems in humans and decreases the effectivity of the antibody. Also the production of antibodies requires special treatment so as to avoid any contaminants such as prions or other proteinaceous material, which might have a detrimental effect upon application to a patient. Additionally, the high molecular weight of these molecules constrict the possible administration routes of the medicament during treatment of patients, usually to intra venous route.<br>
There are several peptidic alphaSbetal inhibitors known that are based on the natural ligand derived RGD-sequence, but these inhibitors show mostly no or only limited specificity against other integrins. Furthermore, peptidic molecules are generally disadvantageous concerning their application as a medicament. One aspect thereof resides in the limited stability against naturally occurring proteases. Another one is the limitation of possible administration routes.<br>
One fibronectin derived peptide (US 6,001,965) proposed to act via alphaSbetal showed anti-metastatic activity in mouse tumor models (Stoeltzing, 2003, Int. J. Cancer 104, 496) and inhibition of cell invasion (Livant, 2000, Cancer Res., 60, 309), but no direct inhibition of alphaSbetal- fibronectin interaction could be shown. It only binds to alphaSbetal (without effecting the fibronectin binding) and alphavbeta3 integrin (conference talk at 6th international symposium on anti-angiogenic agents, San Diego, 30th Jan- lstFeb 2004). Therefore, the molecular mechanism of action and the specificity remain<br><br>
unclear and shed some further doubt on the usage of fibronectin, non-RGD sequence derived peptides as inhibitors to alphaSbetal (so called synergistic sequence).<br>
The small molecules synthesized in the art are e.g. described in the international patent application WO 97/33887 which discloses compounds comprising a spiro moiety as a core element. However, due to the spiro moiety contained in these compounds they are rather rigid in their structure and difficult to synthesize. In contrast thereto, international patent application WO 95/32710 discloses the use of a benzyl residue as a core element. These compounds, however, seem to lack the required specificity for an integrin particularly relevant in the pathomechanism of the aforementioned diseases.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention is thus to provide chemical compounds which are suitable to interact with integrins, more particularly specifically interact with certain integrin species such as integrin alphaSbetal. A further problem underlying the present invention is to provide antagonists for alphaSbetal, which preferably show enhanced activity, stability, selectivity, and synthetic accessibility. A further problem underlying the present invention is to provide new modes of treatment for diseases, preferably for diseases involving integrin mediated effects and processes.<br>
In a first aspect the problem underlying the present invention is solved by a compound of the formula (I)<br>

Even more preferred compounds according to the present invention are those mentioned in any of the tables herein and those further disclosed and/or characterized in the examples.<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly found that the compounds according to the present invention " are particularly suitable to interact with integrins, more particularly with integrin alphaSbetal which is also referred to herein as alphaSbetal. Without wishing to be bound by any theory the present inventors assume that the structure underlying the compounds according to the present invention, more particularly comprising a central core structure represented by D in formula (I) and a total of three radii emerging there from, namely the radius X-A, the radius Z-G, and the radius Y-B, provides for this effect. Also, this class of compounds is advantageous in so far as it has a rather simple core structure provided by the heterocyclic and homocyclic, respectively, ring as represented by D of formula (I). It seems that this rather flexible design confers to the compounds according to the present invention the ability to specifically interact with the integrin, typically reflected in a low IC50 value. The compounds according to the present invention seem to be particularly binding and specific, respectively, for integrin alphaSbetal. However, it is also within the present invention that the compounds of the present invention show cross-reactivity with other compounds, preferably with other integrins.<br>
According to the current understanding of the inventors and without wishing to be bound by any theory, the various radii contributing in a synergistic manner to the binding of the compounds according to the present invention to the integrins and preferably to integrin alphaSbetal, can be assigned the following functions.<br>
The interaction of any molecule with integrins usually requires a basic and acidic moiety present in said molecule. These moieties are represented in the compounds according to the present invention by radius Z-G and radius Y-B, respectively. The compounds according to the present invention additionally comprise radius X-A, which to modulate the physico-chemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the compound, without effecting the activity or selectivity towards the target protein. A variety of functional groups can be placed in the position of radius X-A to increase for instance the solubility or metabolic stability.<br>
The basic radius Z-G can interact with carboxylic group(s) of the integrin protein. Basic functional groups like guanidine, amidine or aromatic nitrogen containing heterocycles are widely used as interaction partners. The term "basic" refers in so far to a functional group which is positively charged under physiologic conditions. However, also non-charged functional groups like amid or urea serve this requirement. The further design of this radius may be taken from the overall disclosure of the present application.<br>
The acidic radius Y-B bears usually a carboxylic acid and interacts with metal ions, which are incorporated in the protein structure. Esters, such as -CO2Alk and amides such as -CONR5R6 being derivatives of this carboxylic acid group (-CO2H) may advantageously be used as prodrugs of the active compound. Such prodrugs are compounds which undergo biotransformation prior to exhibiting their pharmacological effects and the invention particularly extends to prodrugs of the acid. Such prodrugs are well known in the art, see for example International Patent Application No. WOOO/26419, Bodor, N. (Alfred Benzon Symposium, 1982, 17, 156), Singh, G. et al. (J. Sci. Ind. Res., 1996, 55, 497) and Bundgaard, H., (Design of Prodrugs, 1985, Elsevier, Amsterdam). It is thus within the present invention that the compounds according to the present invention also comprise the prodrug form of the compounds disclosed herein.<br>
For this acidic interaction realised by the compounds according to the present invention a carboxylic acid group is preferably used as interaction partner for the interacting group of the integrin. Preferably the counter ion on the integrin is a metal ion. However, this interaction does not necessarily require a carboxylic acid functional group. Other functional groups like tetrazole, phosphates and acylsulfonamides can also serve as a binding partner for the group of the integrin interacting with said compound. These groups are bioisosteres for the carboxylic group. Other bioisosters for the carboxylic<br><br>
group are known to the ones skilled in the art. Thus the compounds according to the present invention also comprise those compounds where the carboxylic group is replaced by a bioisoster of such carboxylic group.<br>

More preferably such further moiety is an additional moiety, most preferably a compound on its own, which is attached, preferably conjugated to any of the compounds according to the present invention. Such further moiety is preferably selected from the group comprising a detection moiety, a targeted moiety and a delivery moiety. It is to be understood that the same moiety can have several functions.

This complex should bind specifically to the integrin alphaSbetal, which is poorly expressed on quiescent vasculature, but significantly upregulated on endothelial cells in tumors and after stimulation with growth factors. Therefore this complex should bind only to activated endothelial cells, which are symptomatic for disorders connected with angiogenesis, kill these cells exclusively and stops consequently the pathological angiogenesis.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the further moiety is a delivery moiety. Such delivery moiety is any agent which is suitable to improve the stability, solubility and pharmacokinetic properties of the compound to optimize the bioavailability after administration.

As used herein, the term "disease" describes any disease, diseased condition or pathological condition. Such disease may also be defined as abnormal condition, preferably connected with pathological angiogenesis or pathological proliferation and migration of cells. Also, in case of a pathogen, disease means a condition where a pathogen or an unwanted organism is present or present in a concentration or compartment where it is undesired and thus subject to reduction in numbers, removal, elimination, prevention of invasion and/or destruction by using the compounds according to the present invention.<br>
The term "treatment" as used herein comprises both treatment and prevention of a disease. It also comprises follow-up treatment and a combination treatment of a disease. Follow-up treatment is realized upon a treatment of a disease using compounds preferably different from the one according to the present invention, for example, after a failed or insufficient pre-treatment of the targeted disease, such as chemotherapy, anti-hormone therapy, radiation therapy, photodynamic therapy, other anti-angiogenic therapy or surgical treatment.

The term "inhibition of angiogenesis" preferably means the inhibition of angiogenesis in a tissue in an individual, by administering a compound according to the present invention, whereby the compound interacts with an integrin, preferably alphaSbetal, thereby reducing or inhibiting angiogenesis in the tissue in the individual. Such inhibition provides the reduction of severity of a pathological condition associated with angiogenesis. Inhibition of angiogenesis means also the reduction of the amount of newly formed blood vessels in a tissue in the presence of the compound according to the present invention compared to the tissue in the absence of this compound. Methods for determining the amount of blood vessel formation in a tissue are described in the example and are well known in the art.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention can be characterized by the IC50 value, which is also referred to herein as IC50. The term "IC50" means the inhibtion constant, the inhibition of the interaction between the integrin and the most preferred ligand of this integrin. The integrin is preferably alphaSbetal, but for determining the selectivity of the compound, also another integrin can be used.

The compounds according to the present invention are understood to bind to an integrin thus interfering with the binding of the integrin to a ligand. Preferably such ligand is expressed in the extracellular matrix of a tissue or on a cell surface. The specificity of interaction of the compounds according to the present invention with the integrins, more preferably with integrin alphaS betal, also referred to as alphaSbetal, defines the molecular environment where the compounds according to the present invention are active in terms of integrin inhibition and as compounds for the treatment of a disease. Integrins are crucial in mediating a number of biological processes, whereby particularly integrin alphaS betal is an integrin strongly associated with angiogenesis, and even more preferably related to pathological angiogenesis. As used herein, pathological angiogenesis is any angiogenesis which is undesired. An undesired angiogenesis is any angiogenesis which results in a disease or condition which is different from a desired condition, at least from a medical point of view. Additionally alphaSbetal is also strongly associated with other processes based on pathological migration and proliferation of cells.<br>
However, the mode of action of the compounds according to the present invention is not limited to competitive inhibition of the binding of an integrin and its ligand, but a compound according to the present invention can also change the binding characteristics of the integrin to the ligand and, optionally also vice versa, preferably through a different mechanism, such as an allosteric mechanism upon which either the integrin or the ligand is changed so as to modulate the interaction between the integrin and a ligand thereof. Finally, in principle, the compounds according to the present invention can also induce agonistic effects on integrins (Humphries, 2000, Trends Pharmacol Science, 21, 29). Any of these situations, i. e. an inhibitory as well as a stimulatory situation with regard to the binding of an integrin and a ligand thereof regardless of the particular underlying mode of action, represent an integrin associated state, which can be influenced by the compounds according to the present invention and thus be a reduction or inhibition of angiogenesis or induction of agonistic effects on integrins, as used herein. The term integrin associated state is preferably any of the diseases disclosed herein.<br>
Given the bio distribution of the integrins and particularly of alphaS betal in tissues, organs and cells, respectively and the appearance of pathological angiogenesis, the compounds according to the present invention can be used in the treatment of diseases of or involving various tissues and organs, respectively. Such tissues comprise ocular tissues, such as cornea, retina and macula, the skin, the joints and neoplasms. Further tissues are the synovial tissue, intestinal tissues and the bone tissue.<br>

It is also within the present invention that the compounds according to the present invention may be used for the treatment of a patient suffering from a disease or diseased condition as defined above. Such treatment comprises the administration of one or several of the compounds according to the present invention or a medicament or pharmaceutical composition described herein.<br>
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of a compound can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell culture or experimental animals. Cell culture assays and animal studies can be used to determine the LDso (the dose lethal to 50 % of a population) and the EDso (the dose therapeutically effective in 50 % of a population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which can be expressed as the ratio LDso/EDso. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosages suitable for use in humans. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon a variety of factors, e.g., the dosage form employed, the route of administration utilized, the condition of the subject, and the disease, which has to be treated.<br>
For any compound according to the present invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from protein binding and cell culture assays by determining an ICso (i.e., the concentration of the test substance which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of integrin binding or cell adhesion). A dose can then be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating concentration<br><br>
range in plasma or other compartments such as, e.g., vitreous humor, synovial liquid or other, that includes the lC$o as determined in binding assays. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma or other compartments may be measured, for example by HPLC, LC/MS, or ELISA.<br>
It should be noted that the attending physician would know how to and when to terminate, interrupt, or adjust administration due to toxicity, to organ dysfunction, and the like. Conversely, the attending physician would also know to adjust treatment to higher levels if the clinical response were not adequate (precluding toxicity). The magnitude of an administered dose in the management of the disorder of interest will vary with the severity of the condition to be treated, with the route of administration, and the like. The severity of the condition may, for example, be evaluated, in part, by standard prognostic evaluation methods. Further, the dose and perhaps dose frequency will also vary according to the age, body weight, and response of the individual patient. Typically, the dose will be between about 0.0001-100 mg/kg of body weight or 1 ng-1 mg per eye or comparable concentrations for other compartments. About 0.001 mg to about 50 mg will preferably be administered to a child, and between 0.01 mg and about 1000 mg will preferably be administered to an adult.<br>
A program comparable to that discussed above may be used in veterinary medicine. The exact dose will depend on the disorder to be treated and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques.<br>
Depending on the specific conditions to be treated, such compounds may be formulated and administrated systemically or locally. Techniques for formulation and administration may be found in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences", 1990, 18th ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA. The administration of a compound according to the present invention can be done in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, orally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intranasally, transdermally, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intrapulmonary, vaginally, rectally, or intraocularly, perioculary, intraorbitally, intracapsulary, intrasynovially, intracisternally, topically, just to name a few. In some instances, for example, in the treatment of wounds and inflammation, the compound according to the present invention may be directly applied as a ointment, powder, solution or spray. Topical administration also comprises passive or facilitated adsorption, preferably through the skin, including skin patches and iontophoresis.<br>
Depending on the route of administration some formulations are particularly advantageous. In case of administration of the compound to the eye the following formulations are preferred. In case of local administration, intraocular or periocular injection, local implants, drops and ointments are preferred. In case of systemic administration, injection and oral administration are preferred. In case of intraocular injection intravitreal, intracameral or sub-retinal injections are preferred. Periocular injections are selected from group comprising subconjunctival, para/retro bulbar, juxtascleral, sub-tenual, and others. In the case of local implants specialized sustained-release devices will be administered intraocular or periocular, to enable a constant, slow release of compound to the eye (Robinson, 2002, Exp. Eye Res, 74, 309; Geroski, 2000, 41, 961), other sustained release systems are microsheres, liposomes, nanoparticles or other polymer matrices (Bourlais, 1998, Prog. Retin Eye Res. 17, 33). In order to improve the stability and pharmacological properties of the compound for ocular administration, compound could be modified, as described before, and/or administered in combination with a special formulation, addition of penetration enhancers, bioadhesives and/or biodegradable polymers (Clark, 2003, Nature Rev. Drug Discovery, 2, 448; Sasaki, 1999, Crit Rev Ther Drug Carrier Syst., 16, 85; Kauer, 2002, Drug Dev Ind Pharm., 28, 473; Kimura, 2001, Ophthalmologica, 215, 143). An example for a sustained release of compound in the eye is the preparation of a dry compound pellet which will be coated with a silicone layer, after implantation into the eye the pharmaceutically active compound will be released constantly over a long period of time (Robinson, 2002, Exp. Eye Res, 74, 309).<br>

2. Cellular inhibition assays<br>
2. 1 . Cell Adhesion Assay with K562<br>
K562 erythroleukemia cells were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH (DMSZ, Braunschweig, Germany). Cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin (all from Biochrom AG, Germany).<br>
The cell adhesion assays were performed in 96-well Nunc-Immuno maxisorp plates. The wells were coated for 1 h at 37 °C with 100 uL aliquots of fibronectin (10 ^ig/mL in phosphate-buffered-saline, 120-kDa fragment, Chemicon Europe, Germany), then blocked with 10 mg/mL heat denatured BSA in phosphate buffer for 30 min.<br>
K562 cells were resuspended to 4 x 106 cells/mL in 150 mL NaCl, 25 mM Hepes, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. As a next step the cells were washed two times with the same buffer. 100 (j,L cell aliquots were then added to 100 |*L aliquots of the same buffer with in addition 4 mM MgCl2, 100 mM PMA and different concentrations of compounds. These samples were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After that 100 ^L aliquots were transferred to the microtiter wells and the cells were allowed to adhere to the substrate for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % COa. To determine the reference value for 100 % attachment, cells were seeded on poly-L-Lysin (0.01 % solution) coated wells and for detection of minimum attachment, cells were seeded on uncoated wells.<br>
Adherent cells were then fixed by addition of 5 % glutaraldehyde (100 uL/well) for 30 min at room temperature. After three wash steps with phosphate buffer the cells were stained with Crystal Violet<br><br>
(0.1 % in 200 mM MES buffer, pH 6.0) for 1 h at room temperature. Excess dye was removed by three washes with phosphate buffer, and bound dye was solubilized with 100 uL of 10 % acetic acid.<br>
v   The absorbance of each well at 570 nm was then measured using the SpectraMax Plus reader. Each sample was assayed in quadruplicate, and minimum attachment was subtracted from all measurements.<br>
The result is depicted in Fig. 6. As may be taken from Fig. 6 compound 71 and the other compounds from activity group A are significantly active in inhibiting cell adhesion in the above described assay at 0.5 uM.<br>
3. In vivo studies<br>
3.1.	Physiological retinal angiogenesis at newborn rats<br>
Rats are born with a completely avascular retina with physiological retinal vascular development occurring in a centripetal manner within the first two weeks of life. At postnatal day P6 approximately 65 % is physiologically vascularized, with vascularization being complete by PI 0-1 4.<br>
Sprague Dawley rats were used according to protocols which are in conformity with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology's statements on the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic Research.<br>
Rat pups were taken from within 24h of birth and injected intravitreally at PI with 3 uL of selected compound solved in saline. The same injection was repeated at P3. Controls include vehicle injected, as well as uninjected eyes. The animals were sacrificed by decapitation at P6.<br>
Upon sacrifice the eyes were enucleated and fixed in 10 % buffered formalin phosphate (Fisher Scientific) for 30 minutes at RT. The retinas were dissected and post- fixed in methanol for 10 minutes at -20 °C. The retinas were washed with 1 % Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated overnight with a 1/100 solution of TRITC conjugated lectin griffonia simplicifolia (Sigma- Aldrich) in 1 % Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing with PBS, the retinas were fiatmounted, viewed and photographed with an epifluorescent microscope (Nikon) and a digital camera set-up (Actl). The percentage of total vascularized area was calculated as a percent of the vascularized area over the total surface area (Adobe-Photoshop) .<br>
The results are represented in Fig. 7. Under the influence of compound 5 retinal angiogenesis was significantly reduced compared to the vehicle treated and non-treated eye.<br>
3.2.	Coraeal angiogenesis in mice<br>
Induction of neovascularization in the cornea: 1 month old mice (C57) were anesthetized with a mixture of Rompun und Ketanest. For local anesthesia of eyes Novesine (0.4 %, Novartis) was used. Neovascularization was induced by application of 2 uL of 0.15 M NaOH to the cornea of each mouse and the corneal and limbal epithel were scraped with a Tooke Corneal Knife (Arista Surgical Supply, New York). To prevent infection the eyes were treated with antibiotic ointment. Treatment: 7-10 days after induction of neovascularization mini-osmotic pumps (Alzet model 2001, Alza Corporation, Mountain View CA) were implanted intraperitoneally. Mice were implanted with pumps containing the test compound or vehicle, respectively. The pump rate was 1.0 uL/h. Treatment was carried out for 7 days.<br>
Visualization of vessels: At the end of the experiment mice were euthanized using COa. The Corneas were flatmounted and stained with FITC anti-CD31 antibody for endothelial cells. Therefore corneas were fixed for 20 min in ice-cold acetone (100 %). After washing 2-3 times with PBS corneas were incubated over night at 4 °C with fluorescence coupled antibodies (FITC-anti-CD3 1 (558738, BD Pharmingen) in PBS with 2 % BSA). After incubation corneas were washed for 5-10 min in PBS and<br><br>
embedded with mounting medium (Sigma). The corneal neovascularization was quantified using fluorescence microscope and digitalization software (Zeiss improvisation open lab, NIH Image).<br>
Activity group A compounds are able to inhibit significantly the corneal neovascularization in mice. 3.3. Oxygen induced retinal angiogenesis in rat<br>
Animals: Sprague Dawley rats were used according to a protocol in conformity with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology's statement on the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic Research.<br>
Rat pups were exposed to 8 cycles of hyperoxia (80 % O2, 21 h), hypercapnia (10 % CO2) and hypoxia (8 % O2,1 h) with a gradual return to 80 % O2, from PI to P8 (Modification of the model of Holmes et al.: Holmes, 1996. Curr Eye Res 15,403, Holmes, 1997. Curr Eye Res 16, 725). The rats were returned to room-air and neovascularization was evaluated at PI 3, after 5 days of relative ischemia.<br>
Drug administration: Rat pups were injected during the ischemic phase that follows the oxygen exposure. Rat pups were injected with 5 uL of test compound (in the right eye and vehicle in the left eye at P9 and P11 and sacrificed at P13.<br>
Quantification of intravitreal neovascularization: Upon sacrifice the eyes were enucleated and fixed in 10 % buffered formalin phosphate (Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at room temperature. The retinas were dissected and post-fixed in methanol for 10 min at -20 °C. The retinas were washed with 1 % Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated overnight with a 1/100 solution of TRITC conjugated lectin griffonia simplicifolia (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 % Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing with PBS, the retinas were flatmounted, viewed and photographed with an epifluorescent microscope (Nikon) and digital camera set-up (Act-1). Clock hours of abnormal neovascularization were counted.<br>
Statistical Analysis: Statistically significant differences among treated and untreated eye of the same animals were determined by paired t-test.<br>
Activity group A compounds are able to inhibit significantly the oxygen induced neovascularization in rat.<br>
