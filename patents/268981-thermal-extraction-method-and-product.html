				<td>Thermal Extraction Method and Product<br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing an extract by thermal extraction, and a thermal extraction product.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Extraction of a desired compound from a source is commonly performed by solvent extraction methods.<br>
Solvent extraction is used today on a number of starting materials, including biomass, to extract desired components.  A good example of this is the extraction of taxanes from biomass.<br>
Taxanes are a group of diterpenoid compounds, some of which have been demonstrated to be useful in the treatment of cancer and other serious diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and kidney disease.  In particular, the taxane compounds paclitaxel, docetaxel, Baccatin III, 10-O-deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB or DAB), 13-acetyl-9-dihydrobaccatin III (DHB), cephalomannine, and prostratin have been identified as useful in pharmaceutical applications.  For instance, paclitaxel, is currently being used in cancer treatment (marketed as TAXOL by Bristol-Myers Squibb).  Certain taxanes, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, can be used directly in pharmaceutical applications, without additional chemical modification, while other taxanes (DAB and DHB, for example) are viewed as precursors for the production of other taxanes such as paclitaxel and docetaxel.<br>
The major sources of taxanes are the bark, needles and clippings of the yew (hemlock) tree, which belongs to<br><br>
the genus Taxus.     Unfortunately, even though taxanes are more concentrated in yew than in other species of trees, the absolute concentrations are very low.  For example, it has been reported that in a typical sample, yields of only 0.01% of paclitaxel are obtained from the bark of tne yew tree, and in the range of from 0.003 to 0.015 percent (dry basis) of paclitaxel from the clippings and needles (Huang et al., J. Nat. Prod., 49:665, 1986.) where the first extraction is a solvent extraction.  Furthermore, the yew tree is relatively rare and grows quite slowly, raising valid concerns that reforestation and resource management cannot keep up with the demand.  Although synthetic and semiÂ¬synthetic pathways for producing paclitaxel have been devised, they are extremely complex and generally too costly for commercial production.  Semi-synthetic processes have also been devised for producing docetaxel.<br>
Current methods of commercial paclitaxel and other taxane production are complex and costly.  The unit operations are predominantly physical methods involving: harvesting/collection, grinding, mulching, preliminary solvent extraction and separation to get a crude taxane product.  Once the crude taxane product is produced, paclitaxel may be recovered and purified in additional solvent extractions and other refining steps.  In many cases, the other natural taxanes are chemically converted to additional yields of paclitaxel or to docetaxel.<br>
Current methods for isolating other compounds from starting materials also often include an initial step of solvent extraction, which removes a large amount of impurities together with the desired compounds.  As a result, one or more liquid partitioning steps to enrich the<br><br>
concentrations of desired compounds in the extracts are often performed, followed in some cases by several chromatography steps.<br>
A drawback of these methods is that they require large amounts of costly and, sometimes, toxic organic solvents for the extraction and partitioning steps. Commercially, this translates to very high capital and operating costs for materials, qualified expertise, qualified technical staffing, and infrastructure.<br>
There is therefore a need for a method of isolating compounds, which method would reduce or eliminate the requirement of large amounts of toxic and costly organic solvents.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of an example of a suitable thermal extraction system according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
PIG. 2 is a flow chart illustrating a method of the invention according to Example 1C.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
It has been observed that thermal extraction can be used as an alternate means of extraction to solvent extraction.<br>
An implication of thermal extraction is that the initial step of solvent extraction of a feedstock, as presently associated with solvent extraction methods, is not required.<br>
By "thermal extraction" (which may also be referred to as "thermal distillation" or "rapid thermal distillation"), as used herein is meant an extraction method where heat is used to separate one or more desired compounds from suitable starting materials.  By applying heat to suitable starting materials in a controlled manner in a contained (i.e., enclosed) environment, one or more desired compounds can be liberated, preserved, recovered, and left substantially undestroyed.  Thermal extraction may therefore be used to extract a naturally occurring desired compound from a starting material, which naturally occurring compound was found in the starting material, without chemical conversion.  While thermal extraction may destroy or chemically convert some compounds in the starting material, a substantial amount of the desired compound is not degraded or otherwise chemically altered.  By "naturally occurring desired compound" or "desired compound" obtained by thermal extraction is meant a compound present in the starting material and where a substantial amount of this compound is not degraded or otherwise chemically converted into another compound by the thermal extraction method of the present invention.<br><br>
The material that may be used in the present invention is not particularly limited, providing that it provides a source of the one or more desired compounds and it can be subjected to thermal extraction.  For example, biomass is a common starting material for solvent extraction methods, and it may also be a suitable starting material for the methods of the present invention.  The biomass may be, for example, derived from a plant.  Any part of the plant may be suitable for thermal extraction, including the bark, needles, stems, roots, leaves, seeds, plant cells in culture, etc.; or a mixture thereof.  Plant derived biomass material that is used in the present invention may be in, for example, a freshly harvested state, a dry state, or a hydrated state.<br>
If one or more taxanes are the desired compounds, then diterpenoid-containing biomass materials such as those derived from the yew tree are generally considered an excellent source of taxanes.  For example, all or various components of a species of the genus Taxus  or Austrotaxus may be used as a taxanes source.<br>
In another invention embodiment, thermal extraction may be used to extract flavonoids from suitable starting materials.  Over five thousand naturally occurring flavonoids (including isoflavonoids and neoflavonoids) have been characterized from various plants.  The thermal extraction method of the present invention can be used to extract some of these compounds from these biomass materials.  Some of these compounds include, without limitation, quercetin, epicatechin, proanthocyanidins, citrus bioflavonoids, catechins, resveratrol, kaempferol vanillin and beta-sitosterol.  In one embodiment of the<br><br>
present invention, epicatechin is extracted from cocoa or a cocoa containing starting material, for example.  Flavonoids may be used, for instance, as antioxidants, as well as other uses, such as in treating or preventing cancer, heart disease, etc.  Another source of flavonoids is, for example and without limitation, flax or a flax containing starting material.  Flax may be used to obtain a thermal extract according to the invention comprising one or more flavonoids including catechins and epicatechin.  Other natural products extracted from biomass might also be obtained by using thermal extraction, and used as medicines, natural supplements, etc.  By way of another non-limiting example, a starting material comprising coffee could be used to obtain a thermal extract comprising caffeine.<br>
It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that any number of other materials may be suitable starting materials for obtaining a thermal extract comprising one or more desired compounds.<br>
The starting material used in the present invention may also be reduced in size.  For example, it may be shredded or ground by methods known in the art, prior to thermal extraction.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the material that is to be subjected to thermal extraction is first reduced in size to having an average diameter of less than about 2cm in its smallest dimension. In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the starting material is first reduced in size to having an average diameter of less than about 1 cm in its smallest dimension.<br><br>
Thermal extraction according to the invention may be carried out in a thermal extraction system, which system is not particularly limited.  In a thermal extraction of the invention, all or a portion of the starting material may be exposed to heat in a controlled and contained environment. For instance, if the starting material is a biomass material, ligninic, cellulosic, or hemicellulosic fractions, or combinations thereof, could be used.  By a controlled environment is meant an environment where heat is applied in such a manner as to cause a phase change or chemical conversion of the starting material but not in a manner that would cause a substantial amount of the desired compound present in the starting material to be adversely altered, degraded, destroyed, etc.  For example, in one embodiment, the thermal extract comprises from about 0 to 10% w/w (or any sub-range thereof) of impurities resulting from chemical or other conversion of the desired compound into another compound.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, the thermal extraction is carried out in a thermal extraction system comprising a contained vessel, a heat source and one or more recovery units.  Thermal extraction may then be achieved by heat transfer to the starting material and any resulting intermediate product.  The starting material and any resulting intermediate product may thus be heated to a sufficient temperature for a sufficient period of time to produce a product stream, fractions of which may then be recovered in the one or more recovery units, and collected to obtain an extract.<br>
By way of example, the thermal extraction system may comprise a standard retort system (i.e., a fixed or<br><br>
moving bed either under vacuum or at pressure), a bubbling fluid bed, an upflow thermal extraction unit, a circulating fluid bed, a transported bed, an ablative thermal extraction unit, an entrained flow thermal extraction unit, a rotary kiln or a mechanical transport thermal extraction unit (e.g., heated auger system).<br>
Any device that collects product vapours and liquids produced during thermal extraction may be used as a recovery unit.  A recovery unit may include a condenser. The condenser may be a contact or surface condenser that cools and collects a liquid product from a vapour, or a liquid quench that may also cool and collect a liquid product from a vapour.  A recovery unit may also include demisters, fiber filter beds, or other devices used within the art to collect a liquid product from a vapour stream.  A recovery unit may comprise one or more components, for example, one or more condensers, which may be linked in series.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, sufficient heat is supplied in the thermal extraction system to produce a temperature in the range of from about 2 50Â°C to about 650Â°C, or any subrange thereof, including, for example, from about 300Â°C to about 550Â°C, or from about 320Â°C to about 400Â°C.  A total residence time of the material in the thermal extraction system may be, for example, less than about 30 seconds, for example, in the range of from about 0.1 to about 3 0 seconds, or any subrange thereof.  For instance, in an exemplary embodiment, the total residence time is from about 0.2 to about 5 seconds. In another exemplary embodiment, the total residence time is about 2 seconds, or less.  The residence time of the<br><br>
material in the thermal extractionsystem is measured as the time interval from the heating up of the starting material in the thermal extraction system to quenching (for example, cooling).<br>
Thermal extraction can produce a product stream comprising solid, liquid and/or vapour.  The product stream may be fractionated to obtain fractions, which may be collected to obtain one or more extracts.  Fractions may be a solid, e.g., a char, a liquid and/or a vapour, or a combination thereof.  Fractions or combinations thereof may be obtained comprising a concentrated extract of the desired compound.<br>
Liquid and/or vapour fractions will generally comprise a higher concentration of desired compounds than a solid fraction.  However, a solid fraction may also be obtained.  For example, during thermal extraction of yew biomass, taxanes may collect and concentrate on the surface, matrices or pores of any solid by-products, such as carbon by-products, which may result in a taxane-rich solid fraction, that can be collected to obtain a taxane-rich extract of the invention.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a liquid fraction is obtained by condensing vapours obtained according to the thermal extraction method of the invention. A liquid fraction may also be obtained following removal of solids, such as char, from the liquid and collecting the liquid to obtain an extract according to the invention.  A liquid fraction obtained following extraction of plant based biomass material may be, for example, a tar, a pitch, a pyroligneous acid mixture, etc.<br><br>
In the thermal extraction method of the invention, the liquid and/or vapour fractions may be further fractionated.  Each further fraction thus produced may be individually collected to obtain multiple extracts, or collected and combined into one or more extracts. Fractionation may also be used to selectively produce extracts rich in selected compounds, such as selected taxanes.<br>
The extract of the invention (also referred to herein as a "thermal extract") may be the collected solid, liquid or vapour fractions, or any combination thereof.  It may also be a fraction of the collected solid, liquid and/or vapour fractions, or a combination of selected collected fractions.  A single extract may be obtained by collecting a single fraction or collecting and combining multiple fractions.  Multiple extracts may also be obtained by collecting multiple fractions or by collecting multiple combined fractions.  Also, the extract may comprise a phase change from the starting material (e.g., solid to liquid, etc.), or not.<br>
It has been observed that thermal extraction can provide higher yields of extracted compounds than yields reported in the literature for other methods, including conventional solvent-recovery extraction and purification methods and other non-solvent methods.<br>
For instance, it has been observed that higher yields of total and specific taxanes, including paclitaxel, may be obtained by thermal extraction.  It has further been observed that the taxane-rich extract obtained by thermal extraction has a higher concentration of taxanes in a given volume than in an equivalent volume of Taxus or Austrotaxus<br><br>
solid biomass starting material or in an equivalent volume of the initial (first-stage) solvent-extract of the Taxus  or Austrotaxus biomass material.<br>
One implication of a more concentrated extract is that, to achieve a comparable amount of finished product, a smaller volume of material is required to be processed in subsequent purification, isolation and recovery steps, than is the case with solid feedstock material or an extract obtained from conventional solvent recovery processes.  It has been observed that the initial volume of an enriched extract of the invention to be processed in subsequent purification steps can be lower, for example, an order of magnitude lower, than the volume of initial material required to be processed in a conventional solvent extraction method in order to obtain comparable yields.  For instance, for taxanes extraction, thermal extraction may produce a volume of taxane-rich extract that is reduced by factors of, for example, 10, 15, 25 or 50, or greater, or factors in between, when compared to the volume of initial biomass material required to be processed in conventional solvent-extraction methods to obtain comparable yields of purified taxanes.<br>
Taxanes that may be present in a taxane-rich extract of the present invention include one or more than one of the following taxane compounds: paclitaxel, cephalomannine, baccatin III, 10-deacetyltaxol, 10-deacetylcephalomannine, 10-deacetylbaccatin III (also known as 10-DAB or DAB), 13-acetyl-9-dihydrobaccatin III (also known as DHB), 7-xylosyltaxol, 7-xylosylcephalonammine, 7-xylosylbaccatin III, and derivatives and analogs thereof. This listing is not intended to be exhaustive.  Other<br><br>
taxanes may also be present in the taxane-rich extract of the present invention.<br>
The fractions produced by thermal extraction, and the taxane-rich extract, may also comprise, in addition to one more taxane compounds, a number of other components, including depolymerized lignin, fragmented cellulose- and hemicellulose-derived products, and other reactive components including phenolics, as well as a number of other components.<br>
It has been observed that thermal extraction gives a higher overall yield of taxanes, and higher yields of taxanes that are of present commercial value, than known methods of taxane recovery or production.  The observed "fingerprint" or relative distribution of the predominant taxane components in the extract, and the concentration of taxanes in the extract obtained by thermal extraction is also different than extracts obtained by current methods. For example, it has been observed that paclitaxel yields can be increased by a factor of about 3 to about 5 (i.e., about 300 to about 500 %), DHB yields can be increased by a factor of about 2 to about 3 (i.e., about 2 00 to about 300 %), DAB yields increased by a factor of about 8 (i.e., about 800%) and overall taxane yields can be increased by a factor of about 20 (i.e., about 2000%), compared to average yields obtained from solvent extraction of yew needles and clippings, as reported in the literature.<br>
According to one theory of the invention, which is not to be considered limiting on the scope of the invention, thermal extraction is believed to liberate compounds that may be either chemically bound or physically isolated (e.g., in cellular structures) and therefore not as available for<br><br>
recovery by solvent methods.  In these cases, the thermal extraction of the present invention, while extracting  free and available desired compounds, may simultaneously free and extract bound or isolated compounds by rupturing weak chemical bonds and/or rupturing any physical structures which may isolate or inhibit extraction by conventional means.  For instance, where the starting material is a biomass, desired compounds may be contained in vacuoles that can be disrupted by thermal extraction to liberate the whole of the contents, which disruption and liberation would not normally occur by using conventional methods of extraction.<br>
Extracts of the invention, including, but not limited to, liquids, liquid fractions, solids and solid fractions may be further processed by various methods known to those skilled in the art to purify, isolate and recover the desired compounds for commercial use.<br>
For instance, where taxanes are recovered, the method of the present invention may further comprise a step of contacting taxane-rich extracts obtained, including, for example, the whole extract obtained by combining all of the fractions collected, selected liquid fractions collected, and solid carbon fractions collected, with water or some other appropriate partitioning solvent to further separate, isolate and concentrate the taxane components.  The addition of water or some other appropriate partitioning solvent may occur directly in the thermal extraction system (i.e., in situ) , particularly in product recovery units, during processing of the biomass, or as a separate step, or steps, after the product is recovered from the thermal extraction process.<br><br>
Furthermore, the thermal extraction method of the present invention may further comprise a step of fractionation for the purpose of isolating and concentrating certain desired compounds fractions from other less desirable components.  (For instance, where taxanes are extracted certain desired taxanes could be separated from less desirable taxanes, phenolics, lignocellulosics, inhibitors, and other contaminants.)  The removal of non-desirable components may be carried out to simplify subsequent purification steps or to increase the intermediate economic value.<br>
The isolated yield of paclitaxel obtained by current organic solvent extraction techniques from the bark of Taxus  is typically in the order of 0.01%, and from clipping and needles, about 0.003 to about 0.015%.  However, with the methods of the present invention, isolated yields of about 0.031 to 0.049 % have been obtained.  The isolated yield of DHB from clippings and needles, as obtained by current organic solvent extraction techniques, is typically on the order of 0.04%.  However, with the methods of the present invention, isolated DHB yields of between 0.08 and 0.12 % have been obtained.  The isolated yield of DAB from clippings and needles, as obtained by current organic solvent extraction techniques, is typically on the order of 0.06 %.  However, with the methods of the present invention, isolated DAB yields of between 0.46 and 0.53 % have been obtained.  The yield of total taxanes recovered from clippings and needles, as obtained by current organic solvent extraction techniques, is typically on the order of 0.25%.  However, with the methods of the present invention, total taxane yields of between 5 and 7 % have been measured.<br><br>
Thermal extraction can also be used on a starting material, which may have been initially processed, including by solvent extraction.  It has been observed, for example, that caffeine can be thermally extracted from a fresh source, or following a solvent extraction.<br>
An example of a thermal extraction system suitable for preparing an extract or extracts according to the present invention is described in US patent no. 6,844,420 (Freel and Graham); the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, and is diagrammatically presented in Figure 1.  Briefly, the system includes a feed system (10), a contained vessel (20), a particulate inorganic heat carrier reheating system (30), and for the purposes of the invention described herein, at least one recovery unit, which as shown in Figure 1, and which is not to be considered limiting in any manner, may comprise a primary (40) and a secondary (50) condenser through which the product vapor streams produced during thermal extraction are cooled and collected for example using a liquid quench (80). The recovery unit may also include a demister (60) and a fiber filter bed (70) or other device to collect the liquid product.  The thermally extracted product composition of this invention may be derived from a selected product fraction obtained from at least one recovery unit, for example the primary, or the secondary recovery unit, or a combination thereof, or it may be a whole oil (i.e, whole thermal liquid product) obtained from first and second recovery units, including demisters and fiber filter bed, or a combination thereof.  However, it is to be understood that analogous thermal extraction systems, comprising different number or size of recovery units, or different condensing<br><br>
means may be used for the selective preparation of the extract for the purpose of the present invention.<br>
The recovery unit system used within the thermal extraction reactor system, outlined in Figure 1, which is not to be considered limiting in any manner, may involve the use of direct-liquid contact condensers (80) to cool the thermal extraction product. However, it is to be understood that any suitable recovery unit may be used, including surface condensers.  In one embodiment, liquid, used within these condensers (80) to cool the thermal extraction product, is obtained from the corresponding cooled primary or secondary condenser product (90).  However, as would be evident to one of skill in the art, any other compatible liquid for cooling the product within the primary and secondary recovery units, or a combination thereof, may also be used for this purpose.  Furthermore, it is considered within the scope of this invention that other scrubber or cooling means including heat exchangers comprising solid surfaces and the like may also be used for cooling the product vapors.<br>
EXAMPLES 1 AND 2<br>
A.        DESCRIPTION OF A FEED MATERIAL - CANADA YEW<br>
Taxus  Canadensis  Marsh, Canada yew, ground hemlock shrubs were collected in July-September 2004 from Sault Ste. Marie surrounding area, Ontario, Canada (lat. 46.34 N, long. 84.17 W).  Pressed voucher specimens are deposited in the Canadian Forest Service-Sault Ste. Marie herbarium as Taxus canadensis  Marsh (2004- 4001-10 CFS-SSM # s), Taxaceae - yew family.  The fresh T. Canadensis needles and twigs were air dried at room temperature 22-24 Â°C.  The dried sample was<br><br><br>
ground to -0.5 mm particle size in a Thomas-Wiley Laboratory mill, Model 4 (Thomas Scientific, USA).<br>
B.        ANALYTICAL METHODS AND PROCEDURES<br>
Analysis of Taxane Products:<br>
High performance liquid chromatography was performed using a Waters Delta Prep 4000 Liquid Chromatograph equipped with a computer and Empower software, a Waters 996 autoscan photodiode array spectrophotometric detector; and an analytical column.  The analytical column used in the experiments described below was a Curosil-PFP Phenomenox (250 x 4.60 mm i.d.).  A modified gradient chromatographic technique (Phenomenex) was used at room temperature using an acetonitrile/water solvent system. However, other solvent systems were also used.  Samples were eluted using an appropriate gradient, for example, a 25/75 to 65/35 gradient of acetonitrile/water over a 40 minute period with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min.  Compounds were detected at a wavelength of 228 nm and resolved peaks were scanned by the photodiode array detector from 2 00 to 4 00 nm.<br>
A dilute solution (10 mg/mL) of extract was filtered through 13 mm GHP 0.45 Âµm Minispike (Waters, EDGE) and 10 ÂµL was injected onto an HPLC column with and without spiking with standards.  Peaks were identified on the basis of retention times and UV spectra. Peak heights, measured as absorbance at 228 nm, were converted to mg/ml using conversion factors obtained for commercial taxane standards. Such HPLC analyses were performed in triplicate.<br>
UV spectra were recorded on a UV-Vis. Beckman DU series 640 spectrophotometer. Taxanes were identified by<br><br>
co-chromatography with authentic samples (ChromaDex, Sanata Ana, CA, USA) using TLC and HPLC.<br>
Example 1: Production of thermal extract using thermal extraction<br>
A hemlock feedstock, prepared according to the procedure described above, was processed in a thermal extraction system essentially as described in US Patent No. 6,844,42 0 (the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference).  In the thermal extraction system, a char product is rapidly separated from the product vapor/gas stream, and the product vapor and liberated liquids are rapidly quenched within a primary recovery unit using, a direct liquid contact condenser, or a liquid quench, as described below.  The compounds remaining within the product vapor are transferred to a secondary recovery unit linked to the primary recovery unit in series.  The product vapor is then quenched within the secondary recovery unit using, a direct liquid contact condenser, or a liquid quench, and the condensed product collected.  Any remaining product within the product vapor is collected within the demister and filter bed (see FIG. 1).  The primary recovery unit product is collected, as well as the secondary recovery unit product.  The yield of liquid product from the recovery unit ranges from about 40 to about 60% (w/w), and is typically about 49% (see FIG. 1).<br>
Example 1A: Thermal Extraction Run 1<br>
A hemlock feedstock (4,715 g) containing 2.52 wt% ash and 8.73 wt% moisture was thermally extracted in an upflow reactor (See FIG.1)at 490Â°C using a surface-condenser, to produce a bio-oil sample.  The liquid yield on<br><br>
a feed "ash free" basis was 55.49 wt%.  Samples of the thermal extract submitted for taxane analysis included an aqueous fraction (1024.5g), a tar fraction (440.5g) and pure liquid fraction (170g) squeezed from a fiberglass filter material in the demister;<br>
Example IB: Thermal Extraction Run 2<br>
A hemlock feedstock (7,996 g) containing 1.80 wt% ash and 5.20 wt% moisture was thermally extracted in an upflow reactor (See FIG. 1) at 398Â°C run in surface-condensing mode, to produce a liquid thermal extract.  The liquid yield on a feed "ash free" basis was 45.12 wt%, char was 28.54 wt% and the gas was 17.41 wt%.<br>
Samples of the taxane-containing thermal extract products were taken and submitted for taxane analysis.<br>
In this example, the volume of the thermal extract is reduced by a factor of about 25 (without the requirement for any initial solvent extraction of the solid biomass) when compared to the initial volume of biomass from which the extract was produced.<br>
Example 1C; Thermal Extraction Run 3 (See FIG. 2)<br>
A hemlock feedstock (5,641 g) containing 1.80 wt% ash and 5.20 wt% moisture was thermally extracted in an upflow reactor (See FIG. 1) run at 397Â°C, and in liquid quench mode, to produce liquid thermal extract samples.  The quench liquid was an approximate 50/50 mix of the aqueous product from the run of Example 1A, and demineralized water. The liquid yield on a feed "ash free" basis was 46.77 wt%, char was 25.87 wt% and the gas was 19.0 wt%.  The purpose of<br><br>
this run was to compare product yields obtained using a liquid quench with that of surface condensing.<br>
Samples of the taxane-containing thermal extraction products were taken and submitted for taxane analysis.<br>
In this example, the volume of the thermal extract is reduced by a factor of about 50 (without the requirement for any initial solvent extraction of the solid biomass) when compared to the initial volume of biomass from which the extract was produced.<br>
Example 1D; Selective Fractionation of Taxanes in the Recovery Train<br>
An example of the selective fractionation and concentration of taxanes in the recovery train is demonstrated in the thermal extraction example described in IB.  In this example, approximately 50% of the identifiable taxane content was detected in the fraction of the thermal extract that was recovered from the fiber bed filter recovery unit, even though this fraction represented only 22% of the total thermal extract produced during Thermal Extraction Run 2.<br>
Example IE; Further Selective Fractionation of Taxanes in the Recovery Train<br>
An example of further selective fractionation and concentration through the addition of water or other partitioning solvent is demonstrated in the thermal extraction example described in 1C.  In this example, water was added in  situ  in the recovery train, and in the result, approximately 67% of the identifiable taxane content was<br><br>
detected in the fraction of the thermal extract that was recovered from the fiber bed filter recovery unit, even though this fraction represented only 24% of the total thermal extract produced during Thermal Extraction Run 3. Other than the addition of water and direct condensation of the thermal extract products, the thermal extraction conditions of Run 3 were similar to those of Run 2 with respect to temperature and processing time.  The selective fractionation of taxanes using water portioning was therefore demonstrated to be more effective in Run 3 when compared to the selective fractionation of taxanes without water partitioning as was the case in Run 2.<br>
Analyses for Examples 1A, 1B and 1C: Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of the thermal extract using silica gel and methylene chloride:MeOH 95:5 as a solvent was used and proved beneficial in obtaining qualitative analysis of the taxanes (i.e., confirmation of the presence of taxanes in the samples). The results of the TLC analysis are presented in the last column of Table 1 (i.e, taxanes are reported as "detected" or "not detected").<br>
Example 2:  Isolation and Quantitative Analyses of Taxanes by Gel chromatography and HPLC<br>
Isolation Method 1:  Thermal extract samples (1 g) obtained as outlined in Examples 1A, 1B and 1C were mixed and adsorbed onto 1 g of Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, PVPP (Sigma Chemical Co., P-6755  [25249-54-1]) and applied to strata-X 33 Âµm Polymeric Sorbent lg/20ml Giga Tubes (Phenomenex, 8B-S100-JEG).  The strata-X was conditioned with 2 0mL methanol and equilibrated with 20 mL D.I. water before loading the above-mentioned sample.  Elution was carried out at a slow rate using the following solvent systems:<br><br>
a)	methanol - D.I. water (7:3) [5 x 12mL],<br>
b)	methanol : acetonitrile : D.I. water (6:3:1), (6:2:2) or<br>
(5:2:3)   [5 x 12mL], and<br>
c)	methanol : acetonitrile (1:1) [5 x 12mL].<br>
The taxane enriched fractions were analyzed chromatographically by TLC and HPLC.  TLC was used for qualitative analysis (Table 1) and HPLC was used for quantitative analysis to determine the yields of total and individual taxanes (Tables 1, 2 and 3).  Solvent system "b" (6:3:1) was selected as effective for the quantitative determination of taxane yields, and the yields reported in the Tables were determined using this solvent system.<br><br>
Table 1: TLC and HPLC Analysis<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br><br>
The yield of total taxanes and individual taxane components, as produced via thermal extraction and as recovered using Isolation Method 1, are reported in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.  A comparison of total "Isolation Method 1" taxane yields with those reported in the literature for conventional solvent recovery processes (e.g. Daoust, G and Sirois, G., 2003, and "Canada   Yew   (Taxus canadensis Marsh.)   and Taxanes:  A Perfect  Species  for Filed Production and improvement Through Genetic Selection" Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Service, Sainte-Foy, Quebec), is also given in Table 2.  A comparison of the "Isolation Method 1" yields of individual representative taxanes with the solvent control test yields is also given in Table 3.<br>
As can be observed from the data in Tables 2 and 3, the yields of total taxanes and individual representative taxanes are higher using the methods of the present invention than yields that have been obtained using conventional solvent extraction methods.<br><br>

Isolation Method 2:  Liquid thermal extract samples (1 g) obtained as outlined in Examples 1A, 1B and 1C were mixed and adsorbed onto 1 g of Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, PVPP (Sigma Chemical Co., P-6755  [25249-54-1]) and applied to strata-X 33 Âµm Polymeric Sorbent lg/20ml Giga Tubes (Phenomenex, 8B-S100-JEG). The strata-X was conditioned with 20mL methanol and equilibrated with 20 mL D.I. water before loading the above-mentioned sample.  Elution was carried out at a slow rate using 20 mL of water followed by 20 mL aliquots of increasing concentrations (20, 50, 70, 100%) of methanol.  All fractions were analyzed chromatographically with maximum concentration found in the fraction eluting with 50-70% methanol.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Solvent Extraction of Taxanes (non-pyrolytic Control Test)<br>
Fresh Taxus  canadensis  Marsh needles (4417.13 g fr. wt.) were extracted at room temperature in two steps: first, by steeping for 24 h in 100% MeOH (1 g fr. wt/10 ml solvent), followed by chopping in a commercial Waring blender and decanting the solvent; second, by steeping the chopped<br><br>
residue for an additional 24 h in 60 % aqueous MeOH. The combined methanolic extracts were evaporated under reduced pressure until most or all of the MeOH had been removed. The residue was freeze-dried to obtain 713.88 g of crude extract. Thus from each g fresh weight of needles, 162 mg of T. canadensis  crude extract was obtained.  Results of this test are presented in Table 3 as "solvent control".<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
A post-solvent coffee feedstock was thermally extracted in an upflow reactor (See FIG. 1.) operated at a temperature of 464Â°C, and in a liquid quench mode, to produce thermal extract samples.  The liquid yields on a feed "ash free" basis was 55.15 wt%, the char yield was 16.87 wt%, and the gas yield was 24.37 wt%.  The purpose of the run was to determine whether any residual caffeine remaining in post solvent extracted coffee feedstock could be thermally extracted.<br>
A sample of the caffeine-containing thermal extraction products were taken and submitted for caffeine analysis using an Agilent Technologies 1200 Liquid Chromatograph equipped with a computer and Chem. Station software (Chem. 32), a Binary pump SL (G1312B), a high performance autosample SL (G1367C) and an autoscan photodiode array spectrophotometer detector Agilent Technologies (G1315C).<br>
Results:<br>
â  R158A Demister Glycol: 91.2ppm caffeine in 1 g of the oil<br><br>
â 	R158A Primary Condenser 129ppm caffeine in 1 g<br>
of the oil<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
A flax shive feedstock was thermally extracted in an upflow reactor (See FIG. 1.) operated at a temperature of 500Â°C, and in a liquid quench mode, to produce thermal extract samples.  The liquid yields on a feed "ash free" basis was 55.57 wt%, the char yield was 14.48 wt%, and the gas yield was 23.61 wt%.  The purpose of the run was to determine whether any epicatechin and catechin in flax shives could be thermally extracted.<br>
Samples of the collected liquid thermal extract products were taken and submitted for epicatechin and catechin analysis using an Agilent Technologies Eclipse Plus C-18 5 Âµm (4.6 x 150mm i.d.) reverse-phase analytical column.  A gradient chromatographic technique was used at room temp: solvent A=MeOH/Acetonitrile (95:5); solvent B=0.05% aq. HCOOH; with the flow rate set at 0.9 ml/min. Three fixed detection wavelengths were used: 270nm, 280nm and 350nm and resolved peaks were scanned by the photodiode array detector from 250 to 400nm.<br>
Results:<br>
â 	Epicatechin and cathechin were detected in<br>
significant quantities<br>
