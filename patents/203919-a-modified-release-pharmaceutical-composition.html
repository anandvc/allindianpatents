"A MODIFIED RELEASE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION"<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB,  a Swedish company of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
GRANTED<br><br>
20-7-2006<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel pharmaceutical formulations that provide for modified delivery of particular drugs, which drugs are useful in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
It is often necessary to administer pharrnaceutically--active compounds frequently throughout the day in order to maintain a desired therapeutic level of active principle in plasma, body tissues and/or the gastrointestinal tract This is particularly the case where it is intended to deliver the drug orally and to provide a uniform response over an extended period of time.<br>
Over the last thirty or so years, modified release dosage forms have increasingly become a preferred method of. delivering certain drugs to patients, particularly via the oral route. Such forms may e.g. provide for release of drug over an extended period of time, thus reducing the number of required daily doses, and during which time the rate of release may be substantially uniform and/or constant, within a specific part of the gastrointestinal tract, or pulsative.<br>
There are numerous modified release dosage forms known in the art and these have been summarised by inter alia De Haan and Lerk in Pharmaceutisch Weekblad Scientific Edition, 6, 51 (1984); Banker in "Medical Applications of Controlled Release", Vol II, eds. Langer and Wise<br><br>

in the form of the free base, which compound is referred to hereinafter as Compound D.<br>
The compounds  of international patent application WO  01/28992  are indicated as being useful in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.<br>
Although general information is provided in WO 01/28992 in relation to how the compounds disclosed therein may be formulated and thereafter administered to patients, no mention is made of modified release pharmaceutical formulations including, specifically, Compounds A, B, C or D and salts thereof.<br>
We have found that it may be advantageous to provide Compounds A, B, C and D, and pharmaceuticalry-acceptable salts of any of these compounds, in a modified release dosage form.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
According to the invention there is provided a modified release pharmaceutical composition (formulation) comprising, as active ingredient, Compound  A,   Compound  B,   Compound  C  or  Compound D,   or  a<br><br><br><br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable salt of any of Compounds A, B, C or D, which compositions are referred to hereinafter as "the compositions of the invention".<br>
Compounds A, B, C and D, as well as pharmaceutically-acceptable salts of these compounds, may be prepared as described in WO 01/28992, as described hereinafter and/or by way of routine techniques in organic chemistry. Compositions comprising solvates, including hydrates, as well as anhydrates (and ansolvates) of Compounds A, B, C, D, and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts of these compounds, are also included within the scope of the   invention.<br>
The term "modified release" pharmaceutical  composition will be well understood by the skilled person to include any composition/formulation in which the onset and/or rate of release of drug (whether in the form of Compound A,   Compound B,   Compound  C,   Compound  D,  or  as   a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt of any of these compounds) is altered by galenic manipulations,"and thus includes the definition provided in the United States  Pharmacopeia   (USP   XXE)   at   pages   xliii   and   xliv   of the preface/preamble part, the relevant disclosure in which document is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In the present case, modified release may be provided for by way of an appropriate pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, and/or other means, which carrier or means (as appropriate) gives rise to an alteration of the onset and/or rate of release of active ingredient. Thus, the term will be understood by those skilled in the art to include compositions which are adapted (for example as described herein) to provide for a "sustained", a "prolonged" or an "extended" release of drug (in which drug is released at a sufficiently retarded<br><br><br>
rate to produce a therapeutic response over a required period of time, optionally including provision for an initial amount of drug being made available within a predetermined time following administration to cause an initial desired therapeutic response);  compositions which provide for a "delayed" release of drug (in which the release of drug is delayed until a specific region of the gastrointestinal tract is reached, following which drug release may be either pulsatile or further modified as indicated above); as well as so-called "repeat action" compositions (in which one dose of drug is released either immediately or some time after administration and further doses are released at a later time).<br>
We prefer that the compositions of the invention provide for a delayed release or, more preferably, a sustained (i.e. prolonged or extended) release of drug over a period of time. More preferred compositions of the invention may be adapted (for example as described herein) to provide a sufficient dose of drug over the dosing interval (irrespective of the number of doses per unit time) to produce a desired therapeutic effect. Release may be uniform and/or constant over an extended period of time, or otherwise.<br>
Compositions of the invention may, for example, be in the form of the following, all of which are well known to those skilled in the art:<br>
(a) Coated pellets, tablets or capsules, which may be designed to release at least some of the drug when the formulation in question reaches a particular region of the gastrointestinal tract Such tablets may, for example be provided with some form of gastro-resistant coating, such as an enteric coating layer, providing for release of at least part of the drug present in the formulation in a specific part of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the intestinal regions,<br><br><br>
(b) Multiple unit or multiparticulate systems, which may be in the form of microparticles, microspheres or pellets comprising drug (which multiple units/multiparticulates may provide for gradual emptying of the formulation containing drug from the stomach into the duodenum and further through the small and large intestine while releasing drug at a pre-determined rate).<br>
(c) Formulations comprising dispersions or solid solutions of active compound in a matrix, which may be in the form of a wax, gum or fat, or, particularly, in the form of a polymer, in which drug release takes place by way of gradual surface erosion of the tablet and/or diffusion.<br>
(d) Systems which comprise a bioadhesive layer, which layer may provide for prolonged retention of composition of the invention in a particular region of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. the stomach). This includes floating or sinking systems (i.e. low and high density systems, respectively), as well as so-called "volume-enlarging" systems.<br>
(e) So-called "pendent" devices, in which drug is attached to an ion exchange resin, which provides for gradual release of drug by way of influence of other ions present in the gastrointestinal tract, for example, the acid environment of the stomach.<br>
(f)	Devices in which release rate of drug is controlled by way of its chemical.potential (e.g. the Osmotic Pump).<br>
(g)	Systems in which drug is released by diffusion through membranes, including multilayer systems.<br><br><br>
(h) Devices that act in accordance with an external signal, to release a small amount of drug.<br>
(i) Active, self-programmed systems, which may contain a sensing element, which element responds to a particular biological environment to modulate drug delivery.<br>
0) Silastic controlled release depots, which release drug as a function of diffusion of water and/or gastrointestinal fluids into the device via an entry/exit port, resulting in dissolution and subsequent release of drug.<br>
(k) Combinations of two or more of the above principles.<br>
The  above principles  are discussed at length in numerous prior art references including Pharmaceutisch Weekblad Scientific Edition, 6, 57 (1984); Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Vol It, eds. Langer and Wise (1984) Bocaraton, Florida, at pages 1 to 34; Industrial Aspects of Pharmaceuticals, ed. Sandel, Swedish Pharmaceutical Press (1993) at pages       93 to 104; and pages 191 to 211 of"Pharmaceutics: The Science of Dosage Form Design", ed. M. E. Aulton (1988) (Churchill Livingstone); as well as the references cited in the above-mentioned documents, the disclosures in all of which documents are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Suitable modified release formulations may thus be prepared by the skilled person in accordance with standard techniques in pharmacy, as described herein or in the above-mentioned documents, and/or which are well known.<br><br>
We prefer that, in the compositions of the invention, active ingredient is provided together with a pbarmaceutically-acceptable carrier. In particular, we prefer that compositions of the mvention are presented in the form of active ingredient embedded in a polymer matrix.<br>
In this respect, we prefer that the compositions of the invention are provided for oral administration in the form of a so-called "swelling" modified-release system, or a "gelling matrix" modified-release system, in which active ingredient is provided together with a polymer that swells in an aqueous medium (i.e. a "hydrophilic gelling component").    The term "aqueous medium" is to be understood in this context to include water, and liquids   which   are,   or  which   approximate   to,   those   present  in   the gastrointestinal tract of a mammal.     Such polymer systems  typically comprise hydrophilic macromolecular structures, which in a dry form may be in a glassy, or at least partially crystalline, state, and which swell when contacted with aqueous media. Modified release of drug is thus effected by one or more of the following processes: transport of solvent into the polymer matrix, swelling of the polymer, diffusion of drug through the swollen polymer and/or erosion of the polymer, one or more of which may serve to release drug slowly from the polymer matrix into an aqueous" . medium.<br>
Thus, suitable polymeric materials (i.e. carriers), which may be used as the hydrophilic gelling component of a gelling matrix modified-release composition include those with a molecular weight of above 5000 g/mol, and which either:<br>
(a)	are at least sparingly soluble in; or<br>
(b)	swell when placed in contact with,<br><br><br><br>
aqueous media (as defined hereinbefore), so enabling release of drug from the carrier.<br>
Suitable gelling matrix polymers, which may be synthetic or natural, thus<br>
include polysaccharides, such as maltodextrin, xanthan, scleroglucan<br>
dextran, starch, alginates, pullulan, hyaloronic acid, chitin, chitosan and the<br>
like; other natural polymers, such as proteins (albumin, gelatin etc.), poly-L-<br>
lysine; sodium poly(acrylic acid); poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylates) (e.g.<br>
poly(hydroxyethylmethacrylate));	carboxypolymethylene        (e.g.<br>
CarbopolTM); carbomer; polyvinylpyrroKdone; gums, such as guar gum,<br>
gum arabic, gum karaya, gum ghatri, locust bean gum, tamarind gum, gellan<br>
gum, gum tragacanth, agar, pectin, gluten and the like; poly(vmyl alcohol);<br>
ethylene vinyl alcohol; poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO); and cellulose ethers,<br>
such as hydroxyrnethylcellulose (HMC), hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC)<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), methylcellulose (MC), ethylceUulose (EC),<br>
carboxyethylcellulose    (CEC),	ethylhydroxyethylcellulose    (EHEC),<br>
carboxymethylhydroxyethylcellulose (CMHEC), hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropylethylcellulose (HPEC) and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Na CMC); as well as copolymers and/or simple mixtures of any of the above polymers. Certain of the above-mentioned polymers may further be crosslinked by way of standard techniques.<br>
For the compositions of the invention in the form of gelling matrix systems, we prefer that the principal swelling polymer that is employed is HPC, maltodextrin, scleroglucan or carboxypolymethylene, more preferably, PEO, HEC or xanthan, and, especially, HPMC, as well as copolymers and/or simple mixtures of any of these polymers.<br><br>
When PEO, HEC, xanthan and HPMC are employed in (i.e. as at least one of the polymers of) the hydrophilic gelling component, preferred molecular weights (i.e. weight average molecular weights, as determined by standard techniques, such as osmometry, size-exclusion chromatography with a refraction detector (in which molecular weight is determined by way of standard   calibration   curves),   light   scattering   and/or   ultracentrifuge techniques), for these polymers are in the range 5,000 g/mol up to 200,000,000 g/mol, such as up to 100,000,000 g/mol, preferably up to 25,000,000 g/mol and more preferably up to 20,000,000 g/mol. Mixtures of PEO, HEC, xanthan and HPMC polymers with different molecular weights within these ranges may be employed.<br>
Suitable HEC polymers also include those that produce solutions of polymer in water with viscosities, as measured by standard techniques, such as those described generally in the   United States Pharmacopeia XXTV (USP XXTV7NF19)  at page 2002 et seq (the relevant disclosures in which document are hereby incorporated by reference) of at least 200 cps for a 2% (w/w) aqueous solution and up to 8,000 cps for a 1% (w/w) aqueous solution, preferably at least 250 cps for a.2% aqueous solution and up to 5,500 cps for a 1% aqueous solution. Mixtures of HEC polymers with different viscosities within these ranges may be employed, in order, for example, to produce HEC mixtures which produce solutions as mentioned above with "average" viscosities (i.e. a viscosity for the mixture) within the above-mentioned preferred ranges.   Similarly, mixtures of HEC polymers (with viscosities and/or "average" viscosities within these ranges) with other above-mentioned polymers may be employed.   If HEC is employed as a polymer,  it is preferred that the polymer is  treated prior to  tablet formulation, for example by way of milling and/or precipitating from acetone.  Further, it may be desirable to coat a HEC polymer with another<br><br><br>
gelling polymer of a low viscosity (such as 6 cps HPMC), for example as described hereinafter. Suitable HEC polymers include those sold under the trademark NATRASOL™ (Aqualon).<br>
Suitable HPMC polymers also include those that produce 2% w/w solutions of polymer in water with viscosities, as measured by standard techniques, such as those described generally in the United States Pharmacopeia XXIV (USPXXTV7NF19) at page 2002 etseq, as well as, specifically, at pages 843 and   844   (the   relevant   disclosures   in   which   document   are   hereby incorporated by reference), of between 3 and 150,000 cps (at 20°C), such as between 10 and 120,000 cps, preferably between 30 and 50,000 cps and more preferably between 50 and 15,000 cps. Mixtures of HPMC polymers with different viscosities within these ranges may be employed, in order, for example, to produce HPMC mixtures which produce solutions as mentioned above with "average" viscosities (i.e. a viscosity for the mixture) within the above-mentioned preferred ranges. Similarly, mixtures of HPMC polymers (with viscosities and/or "average" viscosities within these ranges) with other above-mentioned polymers may be employed.    Suitable HPMC polymers include   those   fulfilling   the   United   States   Pharmacopeia   standard substitution types 2208, 2906, 2910 and 1828 (see USP XXIV/NF19 for further details). Suitable HPMC polymers thus include those sold under the trademark METHOCELTM (Dow Chemical Corporation) or the trademark METOLOSETM (Shin-Etsu).<br>
Suitable xanthan polymers include those that produce 1% w/w solutions of polymer in water with viscosities, as measured by standard techniques, such as those described generally in the United States Pharmacopeia XXIV (USP XXIV7NF19) at page 2002 et seq, as well as, specifically, at pages 2537 and 2538 (the relevant disclosures in which document are hereby incorporated<br><br><br>
by reference), of between 60 and 2,000 cps (at 24°C), for example between 600 and 1,800 cps and preferably between 1,200 and 1,600 cps. Mixtures of xanthan polymers with different viscosities within these ranges may be employed, in order, for example, to produce xanthan mixtures which produce solutions as mentioned above with "average" viscosities (i.e. a viscosity for the mixture) within the above-mentioned preferred ranges. Similarly, mixtures of xanthan polymers (with viscosities and/or "average" viscosities within these ranges) with other above-mentioned polymers may be employed.     Suitable xanthan polymers include those sold under the trademarks    XANTURAL™    and    KELTROLTM    (CPKelco),    and SATIAXAKE™ (Degussa, Texturant Systems).<br>
The choice of polymer will be determined by the nature of the active ingredient/drug (i.e. Compound AyB/C/D/salt) that is employed in the composition of the invention as well as the desired rate of release,   in particular, it will be appreciated by the skilled person, for example in the   . case of HPMC, that a higher molecular weight will, in general, provide a slower rate of release of drug from the composition.   Furthermore, in the case of HPMC, different degrees of substitution of methoxyl groups and hydroxypropoxyl groups will give rise to changes in the rate of release of drug from the composition.  In this respect, and as stated above, it may be desirable to provide compositions of the invention in the form of gelling matrix systems m which the polymer carrier is provided by way of a blend of two or more polymers of, for example, different molecular weights, for example as described hereinafter, in order to produce a particular required or desired release profile.<br>
When in the form of gelling matrix systems, we have also found that rate of release of drug from  compositions  of the invention may be further<br><br>
controlled by way of controlling the drug-.polymer ratio within, and the surface arearvolume ratio of, individual compositions (e.g. tablets) comprising drug and polymer carrier system.<br>
      Compositions of the invention, whether in the form of a gelling matrix system or otherwise, may contain one or more further excipients (in addition to the polymer carrier system) to further modify drug release, to improve the physical and/or chemical properties of the final composition, and/or to facilitate the process of manufacture. Such excipients are conventional in the formulation of modified release compositions.<br>
For example, compositions of the invention may contain one or more of the following diluents: calcium phosphate (monocalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate and tricalcium phosphate), lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, sorbitol, titanium dioiddG, aluminium silicate and the like. Preferred diluents include microcrystalline cellulose.<br>
Compositions of the invention may contain one or more of the following lubricants: magnesium stearate, sodium stearyl iumarate and the like.<br>
Compositions of the invention may contain a glidant, such as a colloidal silica.<br>
Compositions of the invention may contain one or more of the following binders: polyvinylpyrrolidone, lactose, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, a polyethylene glycol (PEG), a HPMC of a low molecular weight, a MC of a low molecular weight, a HPC of a low molecular weight and the like. Preferred binders include .microcrystalline cellulose.<br><br><br>
Compositions of the invention may contain one or more of the following pH controlling agents: organic acids (e.g. citric acid and the like) or alkali metal (e.g. sodium) salts thereof, pharmaceutically acceptable salts (e.g. sodium, magnesium or calcium salts) of inorganic acids (such as carbonic acid or phosphoric acid), oxides of magnesium, as well as alkali, and alkaline earth, metal (e.g. sodium, calcium, potassium and the like) sulphates, metabisulphates, propionates and sorbates.<br>
Other further excipients may include colourants, flavourings, tonicity- . modifying agents, coating agents, preservatives, etc.<br>
Combinations of the above-stated further excipients may be employed.<br>
It will be appreciated by the skilled person that some of the, above mentioned further excipients, which may be present in the final composition of the invention, may have more than one of the above-stated functions. Moreover, further excipients mentioned above may also function as part of a hydrophilic gelling component in a gelling matrix system.<br>
The total amount of further excipients (not including, in the case of gelling matrix systems, the principal polymer carrier) that may be present in the composition  of the. invention  will   depend  upon  the  nature  of the composition, as well as the nature, and amounts of, the other constituents of that composition, and may be an amount of up to 85%, for example between 0.1 to 75%, such as 0.2 to 65%, preferably 0.3 to 55%, more preferably 0.5 to 45% and especially 1 to 40%, such as 2 to 35% w/w. In any event, the choice, and amount, of excipient(s) may be determined routinely (i.e. without -recourse to inventive input) by the skilled person.<br><br><br>
In gelling matrix systems, the amount of polymer in the system should be    enough to ensure that a sufficient dose of drug is provided over the dosing interval to produce the desired therapeutic effect.  Thus, we prefer that at least 60% (such as 80%) of the initial drug content of the composition is released to a patient, and/or under the test conditions described hereinafter, over a period of 2 hours or longer, preferably a period of 4 hours or longer, more preferably a period of 6 hours or longer and particularly over a period of between 8 and 24 hours.   Suitable amounts of polymer that may be included, which will depend upon inter alia the active ingredient that is employed in the composition, any excipients that may be present and the nature of the polymer that is employed, are in the range 5 to 99.5%, for example 10 to 95%, particularly 15 to 80%, preferably 20 to 75%, more preferably 30 to 70% and especially 35 to 65% w/w.   In any event, the choice, and amount, of polymer may be determined routinely by the skilled person.<br>
When compositions of the invention are provided in the form of gelling matrix systems, active ingredients (Compounds A, B, C, D, or phannaceutically-acceptable salts of any of those compounds) that may be mentioned-iuclude the free base forms of Compounds A, B, C and, especially, D, as well as salts in which the solubility of that salt in aqueous media (as defined above) is substantially independent of the pH of that medium, particularly pHs in the physiological range typically found in the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Preferred salts of Compound A thus include l-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid salts, benzoic acid salts, 2-mesitylenesulphonic acid salts, hydroxy-substituted benzenesulphomc   acid  salts,   1,5-naphthalenesulphonic   acid  salts,   1,5-<br><br>
naphthalenedisulphonic acid salts, particularly, toluenesulphonic acid salts, or, especially, benzenesulphonic acid salts.<br>
Preferred salts of Compounds B, C and D may thus include methanesulphonic acid salts, hippuric acid salts, toluenesulphonic acid salts, pamoic acid salts, 1,5-naphthalenedisulphonic acid salts, terephthalic acid salts, succinic acid salts,   salts   of tartaric   acid  and  derivatives  thereof,   such   as   0,0"-dibenzoyltartaric  acid salts  and 0,0"-di-para-toluoyltartaric  acid salts, 2,2,3,3-tetramethyl-l,4-dibutanoic acid salts, 1,2-cyclopentanedi-carboxylic acid salts, or acid addition salts in which"the acid is a derivative of hippuric acid, for example an acid of formula I,<br><br>
wherein<br>
Ar1 represents phenyl or naphthyl, both of which are optionally substituted<br>
by one or more substituents selected from halo (e.g. chloro), nitro, C1-6<br>
alkyl, C1-6 alkoxy, hydroxy and phenyl; and<br>
Rl, R2 and R3 independently represent H or C1-3 alkyl.<br>
It will be appreciated by the skilled person that when Ar1 represents phenyl and R1, R2 and R3 all represent H, then the acid of formula I is hippuric acid.<br>
Preferred Ar1 groups include phenyl, which phenyl group is optionally substituted by phenyl (for example in the 4-position relative to the point of attachment of the C(0) group), chloro (for example in the 3- and/or 4-positions relative to the C(0) group), nitro (for example in the 4-position relative to the C(0) group) and/or C1-4 alkyl, such as methyl (for example<br><br><br>
in the 2- and/or 4-positions relative to the C(O) group); and naphthyl. More preferred values of Ar1 include phenyl, 4-phenylphenyl (biphenyl), 3,4-dichlorophenyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-nitrophenyl and 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl.<br>
Preferred R1 and R2 groups include H and methyl.  It is preferred that Rl and R2 either both represent H or both represent methyl.<br>
Preferred R3 groups include H.<br>
When Rl and R2 both represent methyl, it is preferred that Ar1 represents phenyl. When R1 and R2 both represent H, it is preferred that AR1 represents 4-nitrophenyl, 2,4,6-trirnethylphenyl or, especially, 3,4-dichlorophenyl, 2-naphthyl or 4-phenylphenyl (biphenyl).<br>
Acids of formula I are commercially available (e.g. hippuric acid, 4-mitrohippuric acid and 2-, 3- or 4-methylhippuric acid), or may be prepared in accordance with standard techniques.<br>
For example acids of formula I may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula II,<br><br>
wherein Rl, R2 and R3 are as hereinbefore defined, with an acid chloride of formula in,<br>
ArlC(0)Cl"	III<br>
wherein Ar1 is as hereinbefore defined, for example in the presence of base, e.g. aqueous NaOH, in accordance with classical Schotten-Baumann procedures   (see,   for   example,   J.   Med.   Chew..,   19S9,   32,   1033).<br><br>
Neutralisation with acid, e.g. conc, hydrochloric acid, may precipitate the acid of formula I, which may be recrystallised if necessary from various solvents, e.g. iso-propyl alcohol, methanol, ethanol, acetone and water, or mixtures of those solvents.<br>
Alternatively, ester (e.g. lower alkyl ester) derivatives of compounds of formula II, optionally in the form of a salt, e.g. the hydrochloride salt, can be reacted with an acid chloride of a formula III, in the presence of base, e.g. triethylamine, in a suitable solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, to give an ester-amide of formula IV,<br><br>
wherein R4 represents lower alkyl (such as C1-6 alkyl) or lower alkylphenyl (e.g. C1-3 alkylphenyl) and Ar1, R1, R2 and R3 are as hereinbefore defined (see, for example, J. Heterocyclic Chem. 1973,10, 935, Tetrahedron 1989, 45, 1691 and J. Org. Chem., 1999, 64, 8929). Ester-amides of formula IV may  be  solids   at room  temperature  and may  thus, be  purified  by crystallisation following their formation, if appropriate.    Compounds of formula IV may then be converted to compounds of formula I by "standard hydrolysis, e.g. with aqueous sodium hydroxide followed by addition of an acid," e.g. hydrochloric acid, to precipitate the product   Recrystallisation may then be carried out, if required.<br>
Compounds of formulae I, II and IV in which R3 represents C1-3 alkyl may be made by standard alkylation of a corresponding compound of formula I, II or IV in which R3 represents H.<br><br><br>
Compounds of formulae II (and ester derivatives) and III are commercially available or may be made readily by way of routine techniques.<br>
Preferred salts of Compound D include methanesulphonic acid, pamoic acid, 1,5-naphthalenedisulphonic acid, hippuric acid, terephthalic acid, succinic acid, 0,0"-dibenzoyI-.D-taTtaric acid, 0,0"-di-para-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid, 2,2,3,3-tetramethy1,4-dibutanoic acid and 1,2-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid salts, and acid addition salts in which the acid is a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined, for example 4-phenylhippuric acid, (3,4-dichlorobenzoylamino)acetic acid and [(naphthaIene-2-carbonyl)amino]acetic acid salts. Particularly preferred salts of Compound D include methanesulphonic acid salts.<br>
Preferred salts of Compound C include methanesulphonic acid salts and toluenesulphonic acid salts e.g. para-toluenesulphonic acid salts.<br>
Preferred active ingredients for use in the compositions of the invention, and especially gelling matrix systems, include Compound D and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, particularly Compound D in the form of the free base or in the form of a methanesulphonic acid salt.<br>
Suitable amounts of active ingredient in the compositions of the invention, whether in the form of gelling matrix systems or otherwise, depend upon many factors, such as the nature of that ingredient (free base/salt etc), the dose that is required, and the nature, and amounts, of other constituents of the composition. However, they may be in the range 0.5 to 80%, for example 1 to 75%, such as 3 to 70%, preferably 5 to 65%, more preferably 10 to 60% and especially 15 to 55% w/w.    In any event, the amount of<br><br><br>
active ingredient to be included may be determined routinely by the skilled person.<br>
Typical daily doses of Compounds A, B, C or D, or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts of any of these compounds, are in the range 10 to 2000 mg, e.g. 25, such as 30, to 1200 mg of free base (i.e., in the case of a salt, excluding any weight resulting from the presence of a counter ion), irrespective   of the   number  of  compositions   (e.g.   tablets)  that   are administered during the course of that day. Preferred daily doses are in the range 50 to 1000 mg, such as 100 to 500 mg.  Typical doses in individual compositions of the invention (e.g. tablets) are thus in the range 15 to 500 mg, for example 40 to 400 mg.<br>
Compositions of the invention such as those described hereinbefore may be made in accordance with well known techniques such as those described in the references mentioned hereinbefore.  Compositions of the invention that are in the form of gelling matrix systems may be prepared by standard techniques, and using standard equipment, known to the skilled person, including wet or dry granulation, direct compression/compaction, drying, milling, mixing, tabletting and coating, as well as combinations of these processes, for example as described hereinafter.<br>
Although compositions of the invention are preferably adapted to be administered orally, their use is not limited to that mode of administration. Parenteral modified release compositions of the invention, which may include systems that are well known to those skilled in the art, such as those based upon poloxamers, biodegradable microspheres, liposomes, suspensions in oils and/or emulsions, may be prepared in accordance with standard techniques, for example as described by Leung et al in "Controlled<br><br><br>
Drug Delivery: Fundamentals and Applications" (Drugs and the Pharmaceutical Sciences; vol. 29), 2nd edition, eds. Robinson and Lee, Dekker (1987) at Chapter 10, page 433, the disclosure in which document is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be dosed once or more times daily (e.g. up to six times, but preferably no more than twice, daily), irrespective of the number of individual units (formulations/compositions) that are* administered as part of one "dose".<br>
The compositions of the invention are useful in the delivery of Compounds A, B, C, D and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof to patients. As Compounds A, B, C, D and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof are useful in both the prophylaxis and the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, in particular atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation (e.g. atrial flutter)), the compositions of the invention are also expected to be useful in the treatment of such disorders.<br>
The compositions of the invention are thus indicated in the treatment or prophylaxis of cardiac diseases, or in indications Telated to cardiac diseases, in which arrhythmias are believed to play a major role, including ischaemic heart disease, sudden heart attack, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac surgery and thromboembolic events.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of treatment of an arrhythmia which method comprises aabnnistration of a composition of the invention to a person suffering from, or susceptible to, such a condition.<br><br>
For the avoidance of doubt, by "treatment" we include the therapeutic treatment, as well as the prophylaxis, of a condition.<br>
Compositions of the invention have the advantage that they may provide a modified release of Compounds A, B, C, D or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt of any of these compounds, in order to obtain a more even and/or prolonged effect against cardiac arrhythmias and may thus provide efficient dosing of active ingredient preferably no more than once or twice daily. Certain compositions of the invention may achieve this release in an essentially pH-independent manner.<br>
Compositions of the invention may also have the advantage that they may be prepared using established pharmaceutical processing methods and employ materials that are approved for use in foods or pharmaceuticals or of like regulatory status.<br>

Preparation A<br>
Preparation of Compound A and Benzenesulphonate Salt Thereof<br>
(i) 4-[(3-Hydroxypropyl)amino]ben2omtrile<br>
Alternative 1 A mixture of 4-fluorobenzonitrile (12.0 g, 99.1 mmol) and 3-amino-1-propanol (59.6 g, 793 mmol) was stirred at 80°C under an inert atmosphere for 3 hours before water (150 mL) was added. The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, and was then extracted with diethyl ether. The organic layer was separated, dried (Na2SC*4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo to yield 17 g (97%) of the sub-title compound as an oil that crystallised upon standing.<br>
Alternative 2 4-Fluorobenzonitrile (24.6 g, 0.203 mol, Aldrich 99%) was added to 3-amino-l-propanol (122.0 g, 1.625 mol, 8 equiv., Aldrich 99%) and the mixture heated to 80°C for 5 hours, under nitrogen. The solution was allowed to cool to 22°C and water (300 mL) was added. The cloudy solution was extracted twice with methylene chloride (300 mL and 200 mL) and the combined methylene chloride extracts were washed with water (300 mL; GC analysis of organic layer gave ~1.0 area% arninopropanol remaining).<br><br><br>
Alternative 3 To 4-fluorobenzonitrile (30.29 g, 247.7 mmol, 1.0 eq), was added 3-amino-l-propanol (150 mL, 148.8 g, 1981.5 mmol, 8.0 eq).   The mixture was stirred under nitrogen at room temperature (27°C) until all of the solid had dissolved. The solution was heated (oil bath) to 77°C and kept at this temperature for 7 hours, before being stirred at ambient temperature overnight (14 hours). Water (365 mL) was added, and the resultant cloudy solution was extracted with dichloromethane (365 mL, then 245 mL).  The combined organic layers were washed with water (365 mL).   The DCM solution of the product was dried by distillation: solvent (200 mL) was removed and replaced with fresh DCM (200 mL). More solvent (250 mL) was removed to bring the total solvent volume to 365 mL.<br>
(ii) 3-(4-Cyanoanilrno)propyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate Alternative    I   A   cooled   (0°C)   solution   of   4-[(3-hydroxypropyl)-aminojbenzonitrile (from step (i) (Alternative 1) above; 17 g, 96.5 mmol) in dry MeCN (195 mL) was treated with triethylamine (9.8 g, 96.5 mmol) and then p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (20.2 g, 106 mmol).    The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 90 minutes before being concentrated in vacuo.   Water (200 mL) was added to the residue, and the aqueous solution was extracted with DCM.     The  organic phase  was  dried (Na2S04),  filtered  and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was purified by crystallisation from wo-propanol to yield 24.6 g (77%) of the title compound. Alternative  II The solution of the  crude 4-[(3-hydroxypropyl)amino]-benzonitrile (from step (i) (Alternative 2) above) was concentrated to a volume of 300 mL by distillation and a further 200 mL methylene chloride added and re-distilled to 300 mL (solution water by Karl-Fischer 0.07%). Triethylarnine   (20.55   g,   0.203   mol),   followed  by  4-(N,V-dimethyl-amino)pyridine (248 mg, 2.0 mmol) was added and the solution was cooled to 0°C.   A solution of tosyl chloride (38.70 g, 0.203 mol) in methylene<br><br><br>
                                                        chloride (150 mL) added over ca. 30 minutes with cooling and good<br>
agitation, allowing the temperature to rise to 5°C. The reaction was stirred<br>
for 23 hours in the range 3 to 5°C under nitrogen.  (After 5 hours,<br>
triethylamine hydrochloride precipitation occurred. TLC showed very little<br>
if any further conversion of residual cyano alcohol at 20-23 hours.) Water .<br>
(300 mL) was added and the layers vigorously agitated for 15 min.   The<br>
organic solution was concentrated by distillation at 35 to 40° C to a volume<br>
of ca. 60 to 70 mL. iso-Propanol (100 mL) was added over 5 rninutes. (At<br>
this stage, some granular precipitation of product occurred prior to addition<br>
of iso-propanol.    Crystallization occurred rapidly upon addition of iso-<br>
propanol.)  Distillation was continued using vacuum to remove the last of<br>
the methylene chloride.  (A further -30 mL was removed and the distillate<br>
was checked by GC for the absence of methylene chloride.)   The crystal<br>
slurry was cooled to 0 to 5°C over ca. 1 hour with slow agitation and held<br>
for one hour at 0-5° C. The crystals were filtered on a medium sinter and the<br>
compacted damp filter cake carefully washed with cold (0°C) iso-propanol<br>
(80 mL).  The filter cake was dried under vacuum and a stream of nitrogen<br>
overnight. Yield: 52.6 g, 78.4 mole°/o; HPLC : 99.64 area%.<br>
Microanalysis : found (theory) : %C :6.1.60- (61.67); %H :5.41 (5.49); %N: 8.44 (8.47); %S : 9.71(9.70).<br>
(iii) N,N-Bis(2-oxiranylmethyl)benzenesulphonamide Water (2.5 L, 10 vol.) followed by epichlorohydrin (500 mL, 4 eq.) were added to benzenesulphonamide (250 g, 1 eq.). The reactants were heated to 40°C. Aqueous sodium hydroxide (130 g in 275 mL of water) was added such that the temperature of the reaction remained between 40°C and 43 °C. This took approximately 2 hours. (The rate of sodium hydroxide addition needs to be slower at the start of the addition than at the end in order to keep<br><br><br>
within the  temperature range stated.)     After the addition of sodium hydroxide was complete, the reaction was stirred at 40°C for 2 hours, then at ambient temperature overnight.   The excess epichlorohydrin was removed as a water azeotrope by vacuum distillation (ca. 40 mbar, internal temp 30°C), until no more epichlorohydrin distilled. Dichloromethane (1L) was added and the mixture stirred rapidly for 15 minutes.   The phases were allowed to separate (this took 10 minutes although totally clear phases are obtained after standing overnight).   The phases were separated and the dichloromethane solution used in the subsequent step below. lH NMR (400MHz5 CDC13): 5 2.55-2.65 (2H, m), 2.79 (2H, t, J 4.4), 3.10-3.22 (4H, m), 3.58-3.73 (2H, m), 7.50-7.56 (2H, m), 7.58-7.63 (1H, m), 7.83-7.87 (2H, m).<br>
(iv) 5-Benzyl-3,7-dihydroxy-l-phenylsulphonyl-l,5-dia2acyclooctane IMS (2.5 L, 10 vol) was added to the dichloromethane solution from step (iii) above. The solution was distilled until the internal temperature reached 70°C. Approximately 1250 mL of solvent was collected.    More IMS (2.5 L, 10 vol) was added followed by benzylamine (120 mL, 0.7 eq.) in one portion (no exotherm seen), and the reaction was heated at reflux for 6 hours       (no change from 2 hour sampling point). More benzylamine was added (15 mL) and the solution was heated for a further 2 hours.   The MS was distilled off (ca. 3.25 L) and toluene was added (2.5 L). More solvent was distilled (ca. 2.4 L) and then further toluene added (1 L).    The head temperature was now 110°C. A further 250 mL of solvent was collected at 110°C. Theoretically, this left the product in ca. 2.4 L of toluene at 110°C. This solution was used in the next step.<br>
lE NMR (400 MHz, CDCI3): 5 7.83-7.80 (4H, m, ArH), 7.63-7.51 (6H, m, ArH), 7.30-7.21 (10H, ArH), 3.89-3.80 (4H, m, CH(a) +CH(b))5 3.73 (2H, s, CH2Ph(a)), 3.70 (2H, s, CH2Ph(b)), 3.59 (2H, dd, CHHNS02Ar(a)), 3.54<br><br>
(2H, dd, CHHNS02Ar(b)), 3.40 (2H, dd, CHHNS02Ar(b)), 3.23 (2H, dd, CHHNS02Ar(a)), 3.09-2.97 (4H, m, CHHNBn(a) + CHHNBn(b)), 2.S3 (2H, dd, CHHNBn(b)), 2.71 (2H, dd, CHHNBn(a))<br>
(Data taken from purified material comprising a 1:1 mixture of trans- (a), and cis-diol (b))<br>
(v)3-Benzyl-7-(phenylsulphonyl)-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane The toluene solution from the previous step (iv) above was cooled to 50°C. Anhydrous methanesulphonic acid (0.2 L) was added. This caused a temperature rise from 50°C to 64°C. After 10 minutes, methanesulphonic acid was added (1 L) and the reaction heated to 110°C for 5 hours. Toluene was then distilled from the reaction; 1.23 L was collected.   (Note that the internal temperature should not be allowed higher than 110°C at any stage otherwise the yield will be decreased.) The reaction was then cooled to 50°C and a vacuum applied to remove the rest of the toluene. Heating to 110°C and 650 mbar allowed a further 0.53 L to be removed. (If the toluene can be removed at a lower temperature and pressure then that is beneficial.)  The reaction was then left to cool to 30oC and deionised water (250 mL) was added. This caused the temperature to rise from 30°C to 45°C. More water (2.15 L) was added over a total time of 30 minutes such that the temperature was  less  than  54°C.     The  solution was  cooled  to  30°C  and then dichloromethane (2 L) was added. With external cooling and rapid stirring, the reaction mixture was basified by adding aqueous sodium hydroxide (10 M, 2 L) at a rate that kept the internal temperature below 38°C. This took 80 minutes. The stirring was stopped and the phases separated in 3 minutes. The layers were partitioned. IMS (2 L) was added to the dichloromethane solution and distillation started.   Solvent (2,44 L) was collected until the head temperature reached 70oC. Theoretically, this left the product in 1.56 L of IMS.   The solution was then allowed to cool to ambient temperature<br><br>

and washed with IMS (0.5 L) to give a fawn-coloured product that, on<br>
drying at 50°C, in vacuum, gave 50.8 g (8.9% over 3 steps).  20.0 g of this<br>
product was dissolved in acetonitrile (100 mL) at reflux to give a pale<br>

formed were collected by filtration and washed with acetonitrile (100 mL).<br>
The product was dried in vacuo at 40°C for 1 hour to give 17.5 g (87%) of<br>

The    contents    were    cooled    to    room    temperature.	Toluene<br>
(1.2 L, 3 rel. vol.) was added and the mixture stirred vigorously for 15 minutes.   Stirring was stopped and the phases were partitioned.   The toluene phase was discarded along with a small amount of interfacial material.  The acidic phase was returned to the original reaction vessel and sodium hydroxide (10 M, 1.4 L, 3.5 rel. vol.) was added in one portion. The internal temperature rose from 30°C to 80°C.   The pH was checked to ensure it was &gt;14.    Toluene (1.6 L, 4 rel. vol.) was added and the temperature fell from 80°C to 60°C. After vigorous stirring for 30 minutes, the phases were partitioned. The aqueous layer was discarded along with a small amount of interfacial material. The toluene phase was returned to the original reaction vessel, and 2-propanol (4 L, 10 rel. vol.) was added.  The<br><br><br>

(vii) 3,3-DimethyI-1- [9-oxa-7-(phenyImethyI)-3,7-diazabicyclo [3.3.1 ]non-3-yl]-2-butanone<br>
Water (500 mL, 5 vol.) followed by 1-chloropinacolone (45.8 mL, 1 eq.) were added to sodium bicarbonate (114.2 g, 4 eq.). A solution of 3-benzyl-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane x 2 HC1 (100.0 g; see step (vi) above) in water (300 mL, 3 vol.) was added slowly, so that the evolution of carbon dioxide was controlled (20 mins.). The reaction mixture was heated at 65 to 70°C for 4 hours.   After cooling to ambient temperature, dichloromethane (400"mL, 4 vol.) was added and, after stirring, for 15 minutes, the phases were separated. The aqueous phase was washed with dichloromethane (400 mL, 4 vol.) and the organic extracts combined.  The solution was distilled and solvent collected (550 mL).    Ethanol (1  L) was added and the distillation continued. Further solvent was collected (600 mL). Ethanol (1 L) was added and the distillation continued. Further solvent was collected (500   mL)   (the   head   temperature   was   now   77°C).      This   solution (theoretically containing 1150 mL of ethanol) was used directly in the next step.<br><br>

The mixture was hydrogenated at 4 bar. The reaction was considered complete after 5 hours.  The catalyst was removed by filtration and washed with ethanol (200 mL).     The combined ethanol filtrates were/may be used in step (ix) below.   Solution assay gave 61.8 g of title product in ethanol (theoretically 1.35 L; measured 1.65 L). A portion of the product was isolated and purified. Analysis was performed on the purified product.<br>
]H NMR (300MHz, CDCI3): 5 1.17 (9H, s), 2.69 (2H, dt, J 11.4, 2.4), 2.93 (2H, d, J 10.8), 3.02 (2H, d, J 13.8), 3.26 (2H, s), 3.32 (2H, dt, J 14.1), 3.61 (2H,brs).<br>
This reaction may also be performed using a lower weight ratio of catalyst to benzylated starting material.  This may be achieved in several different ways, for example by using different catalysts (such as Pd/C with a metal loading different from that in the Type 440L catalyst employed above, or Rh/C) and/or by improving the mass transfer properties of the reaction mixture (the skilled person will appreciate that improved mass transfer may be obtained, for example, by performing the hydrogenation on a scale larger than that described in the above reaction).   Using such techniques, the weight ratio of catalyst to starting material may be reduced below 4:10 (e.g. between 4:10 and 1:20.).<br><br><br><br>
(ix) Compound A, benzenesulphonic acid salt monohydrate<br>
Method 1<br>
Potassium carbonate (56.6 g, 1.5 equiv) and 3~(4-cyanoanilmo)propyl-4-methylbenzenesulphonate (see step (ii) above, 90.3 g, 1 equiv) were added to an ethanol solution of 3,3rdimethyl-l-(9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]non-3-yl)-2-butanone (see step (viii) above; 61.8 g from assay in 1.65 L).  The reaction was heated at 80°C for 4 hours.  An assay showed some reactant remained       (8.3       g),       so       more       3-(4-cyanoanilino)propyl-4~ methylbenzenesulphonate (12.2 g) was added, and the resultant was heated at 80°C for 4 hours. Solvent (1.35 L) was distilled, then iso-propyl acetate (2.5 L) added.   Solvent (2.51 L) was removed.   iso-Propyl acetate (2.5 L) was added. Solvent (0.725 L) was removed. The internal temperature was now at 88°C. Solvent (0.825 L) was removed, leaving the product as an iso-propyl acetate solution (theoretically in 2.04 L).   After cooling to 34°C, water (0.5 L) was added. There was a black suspension, possibly of Pd, in the mixture. The pH of the aqueous phase was 11. Sodium hydroxide (1 M, 0.31 L) was added, so that the temperature was less than 25°C, and the mixture was stirred vigourously for 5 minutes. The pH of the aqueous phase was 12. The phases were separated and the aqueous phase discarded. More water (0.5 L) was added, and the phases were separated. The aqueous phase was discarded.    The remaining ester solution was filtered to remove suspended particles, and the filtrate w;as then made up to exactly 2 L.  The solution was then split into 2 x 1 L portions.<br>
(In order to avoid producing sub-title product comprising a high palladium content, the following treatment may be performed: Deloxan® resin (12.5 g, 25 wt%) was added to the solution of the free base (1 L), and the mixture heated at reflux with vigorous stirring for 5 hours. The solution was<br><br>
then cooled to room temperature, and was stirred for 2 days. The resin was removed by filtration.)<br>
An   assay   was   performed   to   calculate   the   required   amount   of benzenesulphonic acid, to make the b.enzenesulphonate salt.<br>
A solution of benzenesulphonic acid (20.04 g, 1 eq., assuming acid was pure monohydrate) in isopropyl acetate (200 mL) was added over 5 minutes (better to add slower if possible) with vigorous stirring to the solution of the free base (1 L) and a pale yellow precipitate formed. The temperature rose from 18°C to 22°C. After 10 minutes, the mixture was cooled to 10°C and the product collected by filtration. The product was washed with iso-propyl acetate (250 mL), sucked dry on the filter then dried under vacuum at 40°C for    2    days    to    give    59.0    g    (61%    from    3-benzyl-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclop .3.1 ]nonane x 2HC1).<br>
(The crude benzenesulphonate salt was alternatively prepared by the addition of a 70% (w/w) aqueous solution of benzenesulphonic acid to an ethanolic solution of the free base.)<br>
The crude sub-title product is isolated as a monohydrate.<br>
Ethanol (500 mL) and water (250 mL) were added to crude sub-title compound (50.0 g). The solution was heated to 75°C. Material was all dissolved at 55°C. The solution was held at 75°C for 5 minutes, then cooled to 5°C over 1 hour. Precipitation started at 18°C. The cold solution was filtered and the filtrate washed with ethanol:water (2:1; 150 mL), sucked dry on the filter, and then dried in vacuo at 40°C to give pure sub-title product (41.2 g, 82%).<br><br><br>
(This recrystallisation may be carried out with greater volumes of solvent if necessary to fit the reaction vessels e.g. EtOH : water 2:1, 45 vol. (gave 62% recovery) EtOH : water 6:1, 35 vol. (gave 70% recovery).)<br>
The sub-title product was isolated as the monohydrate  following the rescrystallisation (as determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction).<br>
Method 2<br>
(a) 3-(4-Cyanoanilino)propyl benzenesulfonate<br>
To the solution of 4-[(3-hydroxypropyl)amino]benzomtrile (from step (i) Alternative   3   above,   assumed   43.65   g,   247.7   mmol,   1.0   eq)   in dichloromethane (360 mL total solution volume) was added, sequentially, triethylarnine (52 mL, 37.60 g, 371.55 mmol, 1.5 eq) and rrimethylamine hydrochloride (11.89 g, 123.85 mmol, 0.5 eq) in one portion.  The yellow solution was cooled to -20°C (using an acetone/dry ice bath or a cold plate), and treated with a solution of benzenesulfonyl chloride (32 mL, 43.74 g, 247.7 mmol, 1.0 eq) in dichloromethane (220 mL, 5 vols with respect to the cyanoalcohol) via a pressure equalising dropping funnel. The solution was added portionwise such that the internal temperature did not exceed -14°C. The addition took 25 minutes to complete. The mixture was then stirred for 35 minutes at between -15 and -10°C. Water (365 mL) was added and .the temperature rose to 10°C.  The mixture was cooled back to O°C and stirred vigorously for 15 minutes.    The organic layer (volume 570 mL) was collected and distilled at atmospheric pressure to remove DCM (450 mL, pot temperature 40-42°C, still-head temperature 38-39°C).   Ethanol (250 mL) was added, and the solution was allowed to cool to below 30°C before turning on the vacuum.  More solvent was removed (40 mL was collected,.<br><br>
pressure 5.2 kPa (52 mbar), pot and still-head temperatures were 21-23°C), and the product gradually came out of solution. The distillation was stopped at this point, and more ethanol (50 mL) was added.    The mixture was warmed (hot water bath at 50°C) to 40°C to dissolve all the solid, and water (90 mL) was added slowly via a dropping funnel. The solution was stirred slowly at room temperature (20° C) overnight (15 hours), by which time some product had crystallised out.    The mixture was cooled to -5°C (ice/inethanol bath) and stirred at this temperature for 20 minutes before collecting the pale yellow solid by filtration. The solid was washed with an ethanol/water mixture (42 mL EtOH, 8 mL H2O),. and suction dried for 30 minutes before drying to constant weight in the vacuum oven (40°C, 72 hours).   The mass of crude product obtained was 47.42 g (149.9 mmole, 60%). Ethanol (160 mL, 8 vols) was added to the crude product (20.00 g, 63.22 mmol, 1.0 eq). The mixture was stirred under nitrogen and warmed to 40°C using a hot water bath. On reaching this temperature, all of the solid had dissolved to give a clear, yellow solution.  Water (60 mL, 3 vols) was added dropwise over a period of 10 minutes, whilst the internal temperature was maintained in the range 38-41°C. The water bath was removed, and the solution was allowed to cool to 25°C over 40 minutes, by which time crystallisation had begun. The mixture was cooled to -5°C over 10 minutes, men held at this temperature for a further 10 minutes. The pale yellow solid was collected by filtration, suction dried for 10 minutes, then dried to constant weight in a vacuum oven (40°C, 15 hours). The mass of sub-title compound obtained was 18.51 g (58.51 mmol, 93% (from the crude product)).<br>

butanone (assumed 34.97 g (verified by assay), 154.5 mmol, 1.0 eq; see step (viii) above) was added 3-(4-cyanoanilino)propyl benzenesulfonate (49.05 g, 154.52 mmol, 1.0 eq; see step (a) above) in one portion.   The resultant mixture was heated at 74°C for 6 hours, then stirred at room temperature (20°C) for 65 hours (over the weekend; the skilled person will appreciate that the reaction will also succeed without this prolonged stirring at room .   temperature).   Ethanol (370 mL) was removed, and water (200 mL) was added (this gave a 2:1 EtOH:H20 mixture, total volume 600 mL).   Upon adding the water, the pot temperature fell from 80°C to 61 °C. The solution was re-heated  to  70°C,  then  allowed to  cool  naturally  to   ambient temperature overnight (19 hours), whilst stirring slowly.    A solid was observed at this stage.   The mixture was cooled to 0°C and then stirred at this temperature for 15 minutes before collecting the off-white solid by filtration.  The solid was washed with a cold 2:1 mixture of ethanol:water (150. mL), suction dried for 1.25 hours, then oven-dried (40°C, 20 hours). The mass of crude product obtained was 57.91 g (103.3 mmol, 60%).<br>
The crude product was found to be 98.47% pure (as determined by HPLC analysis), and was recrystallised (using the procedure detailed below) to give the sub-title compound in a purity of 99.75% (84% recovery).<br>
Recrystallisation procedure:<br>
Ethanol (562 mL) and water (281 mL) were added to the crude product obtained above (56.2 g). The solution was heated to 75°C. All material dissolved at 55°C. The solution was held at 75°C for 5 minutes, before being cooled to 5°C over 1.5 hours. Precipitation started at 35°C. The cold solution was filtered and the collected precipitate was washed with ethanol : water (2:1, 168 mL). The solid material was sucked dry on the filter, before being dried in vacuo at 40°C to give product (47.1 g, 84%).<br><br>

The combined mixture was stirred for 15 minutes.   The layers were then separated and a small amount of interfacial material was  left with the upper aqueous  layer.     Ethanol (500 mL, 10 vol) was added to the dichloromethane solution and then solvent was removed by distillation (1.25 L).   The still head temperature was now at 78°C   The solution was allowed to cool to below reflux and ethanol (250 mL, 5 vol.) was added. Solvent was removed (250 mL). This warm solution was diluted with ethanol to 890 mL, 17.8 vol. (25 vol. assuming 100% conversion to free base).    After heating to reflux the solution was cooled slowly. At 5°C a seed of title compound was added. Crystallisation began and the mixture was stirred, at 5°C for 30 minutes. The  product   was   collected  by   filtration   and   washed   with   ethanol (2 x 50 mL, 2 x1 vol.).

(it) 3-Benzyl-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.11nonane x 2 HC1 This is an alternative preparation to that described in Preparation A(vi) above.   A 3L, three-necked flask was equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a thermometer and a reflux condenser.   Aqueous hydrobromic acid (48%, 0.76 L, 4.51 mol) was added to solid 3-ben2yl-7-(phenylsulphonyf)-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane  (190  g,  0.53  mol,  see Preparation A(v) above) and the mixture was heated to reflux under nitrogen.   The solid dissolved at 90°C.   After heating the mixture for 12 hours, GC analysis showed that the reaction was complete. The contents were cooled to room temperature.  Toluene (0.6L) was added and the mixture was stirred for a few minutes. The phases were separated.  The aqueous phase was returned to the original reaction vessel and aqueous sodium hydroxide (10M, 0.85 L, 8.5 mol) was added in one portion.  The internal temperature rose to 80°C and the mixture was strongly basic.   Toluene (0.8 L) was added when the internal temperature dropped to 55°C.   After stirring vigorously for 30 minutes, the toluene phase was separated and returned to the original reaction vessel. 2-Propanol (1.9 L) was added and the internal temperature was adjusted to between 40°C and 50°C.   Concentrated hydrochloric acid was added (until acidic) at such a rate to maintain the temperature between 409G and 50°C. A white precipitate formed. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes and then cooled to 7°C.    The white powder was collected by filtration, washed with 2-propanol (0.4 L), dried by pulling air through the sample for ten minutes, and then further dried in a vacuum oven at 40°C. Yield: 130 g (84%).<br>
(iii) tert-Butyl 7-benzyl-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.l]nonane-3-carboxylate<br>
hydrochloride<br>
A  5L,  three-necked flask was  equipped with  an overhead stirrer,  a<br>
thermometer and a nitrogen bubbler.  Water (1.4 L), dichloromethane (1.4<br><br>
L),  sodium  bicarbonate  (150   g,   1.79  mol)   and  3-benzyl-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane x 2 HC1 (130 g, 0447 mol, from step (ii) above) were all charged in order.  The mixture was stirred rapidly for ten minutes and then di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (0.113 L, 0.491 mol) was added slowly.       The mixture was stirred rapidly for three hours at room temperature.   The organic layer was separated, dried with magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to afford 160 g of an off-white solid. The off-white solid was charged into a 3L, three-necked flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, a thermometer and an addition funnel. Ethyl acetate (0.6 L) was charged and the clear solution was cooled to —10°C. A solution of HC1 in dioxane (4 M) was added dropwise until the pH was less than 4.   The hydrochloride salt precipitated and the mixture was stirred for an additional hour. The product was collected by filtration, washed with ethyl acetate (0.1 L), and dried overnight in a vacuum oven.  The white crystalline product weighed 146 g (92% yield).<br>

hydrochloride<br>
Hydrochloride salt from step (iii) above (146 g, 0.411 mol) and 20%   Pd(OH)2-C (7.5 g) were charged to a Parr hydrogenator bottle.  Methanol (0,5 L) was  added and the bottle was  shaken  vigorously under an atmosphere of hydrogen at 3.5 bar.   The reaction was monitored by GC analysis and was found to be complete after one hour.   The catalyst was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to afford an off-white crystalline product.  The crude product was dissolved in hot acetonitrile (1.2 L), and then filtered while hot.  The filtrate was diluted with ethyl acetate (1.2 L). The clear solution was allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The first crop of crystals was collected and dried under vacuum to afford 52 g of sub-title compound as a white solid.  The filtrate was concentrated to near<br><br><br>
dryness, then dissolved in hot acetonitrile (0.4 L), and diluted with ethyl acetate (0.4 L)." A second crop of crystals (38 g) was obtained after cooling the solution to 10°C. Both crops were found to be comparable by GC analysis and 1H NMR analyses. Combined yield: 90 g (83%).<br>
(v) tert-Butyl 7-[3-(4-cyanoanilino)propyl]-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]-nonane-3 -carb oxylate<br>
The hydrochloride salt of tert-butyl 9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carboxylate (see step (iv) above; 1.1 g, 4.15 mmol) was mixed with MeCN (46 mL), water (2.5 mL) and K2CO3 (3.5 g, 25 mmol).

benzyl-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane	dihydrochloride	(see<br>
Preparation A(vi) above) used.   Toluene (420 mL, 7 vols) and aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (2M, 420 mL, 7 vols, 4.0 eq) were added to 3-benzyl-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane    dihydrochloride    (60.07    g, 206.03 mmole, 1.0 eq., see Preparation A(vi) above).   The mixture was stirred under nitrogen, heated to 60°C and held at this temperature for 30 minutes by which time two clear layers had formed.   The lower, aqueous layer was removed, and the toluene solution of sub-title compound" (free base) was azeodried at atmospheric pressure (total volume of solvent removed = 430 mL; total volume of toluene added = 430 mL), then concentrated to a volume of 240 mL (4 vols). Karl Fischer analysis at this stage showed 0.06% water in the solution.  The dried solution of sub-title compound (theoretically 44.98 g, 206.03 mmole, 1.0 eq) was used as such in a subsequent step.<br><br><br>
(b) 2-(tert-ButyIoxycarbonylarnino)ethyl 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate Triethylamine (65 mL, 465.3 mmole, 1.5 eq) was added in one portion to a solution of tert-butyl iV-(2-hydroxyethyl)carbamate (50.11 g, 310.2 mmole, 1.0 eq.) in dichloromethane (250 mL, 5 vols).  The solution was cooled to       -10°C and trimethylarnine hydrochloride (14.84 g, 155.1 mmole, 0.5 eq.) was added in one portion.   The resultant mixture was cooled further to -15°C,   stirred   for   5   minutes,   then   treated   with   a   solution   of mesitylenesulfonyl   chloride   (74.74   g,   341.2   mmole,    1,1    eq)   in dichloromethane (250 mL, 5 vols), over 28 minutes such that the internal temperature remained below -10°C.   Once the addition was complete a precipitate had formed and the mixture was stirred at -10°C for a further 30 minutes.   Water (400 mL, 8 vols) was added and all of the precipitate dissolved.  The mixture was stirred rapidly for 5 minutes, and then the two layers were separated.    A solvent swap from dichloromethane to iso-propanol was carried out by distillation at reduced pressure.   Solvent was removed (450 mL) and replaced with iso-propanol (450 mL)  (initial pressure was 450 mbar, b.p. 24°C; final pressure was 110 mbar, b.p. 36 °C). At the end of the distillation, solvent (150 mL) was removed to bring the volume down to 350 mL (7 vols with respect to the amount of tert-butyl N-(2-hydroxyethyl)carbamate used).   The solution was cooled to 25°C, then water (175 mL) was added slowly with stirring, causing the solution gradually to turn cloudy.   No solid had precipitated at this stage.   More water (125 mL) was added, and a solid precipitate started to form after about 75 mL had been added. The internal temperature rose from 25°C to 31°C. The mixture was stirred slowly and cooled to 7°C. The solid was collected by filtration, washed with iso-propanol:water (1:1, 150 mL) and dried in vacuo at 40°C for 21 hours to give the sub-title compound as a white crystalline solid (92.54 g, 87%).<br><br>

The resultant solution was stirred rapidly under nitrogen, with heating at 68°C for 8 hours.    The reaction was left to stir at ambient temperature for 84 hours. A thick, white solid precipitate had formed in a pale yellow solution. The mixture was cooled to +9°C, and sub-title compound was collected by filtration.   The reaction vessel was washed with toluene (100 mL) and added to the filter. The filter cake was washed with toluene (150 mL). The white solid product was suction dried for 15 minutes, then dried to constant weight in vacuo at 40°C for 23 hours. The yield of sub-title compound obtained was 79.61 g, 141.7 mmole, 69%.   The combined filtrate and washings (670 mL) were washed with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (2M, 200 mL, 3.3 vols). The mixture was heated to 60°C, and held at this temperature for 20 minutes with rapid stirring.      The two layers were then separated. The toluene solution was concentrated to 200 mL by vacuum distillation (bp 50-54°C at 650-700 mbar; bp 46°C at 120 mbar at the end).    As the distillation progressed, the solution became cloudy due to the formation of sub-title compound.

Tablet Manufacture<br>
Tablets were manufactured using a standard tableting machine (Kilian<br>
SP300) in accordance with standard procedures.<br>
Where appropriate, mixtures of polymer, drug and, if present, other excipients, were dry mixed (for example in a mortar) or wet or dry granulated using standard techniques. In relation to ethanol and water granulation on a small scale, active ingredient, polymer and, if appropriate, further excipient were dry mixed together in a mortar. An appropriate quantity of solvent was added with mixing. The granulate was dried at 50°C for 16 hours.<br>
Test Method<br>
Drug/time release profiles for the tablets were determined using a United States Pharmacopoeia Method II (European Pharmacopoeia Paddle Method) apparatus with a UV detector and a paddle speed of 50 rpm (unless otherwise specified). A basket (see Int. J. Pharm., 60 (1990) 151) containing the tablet was placed 1 cm above the paddle. The release medium was phosphate buffer (pH=6.8) or HC1 (pH-1.0). The temperature in the release bath was 37°C. The volume of the release medium was 1000 mL, unless otherwise specified.<br><br>
