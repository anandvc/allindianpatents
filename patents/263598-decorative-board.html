DECORATIVE BOARD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention relates to a decorative board,<br>
particularly to a non-combustible decorative board.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] Conventionally, there is a known decorative<br>
board with fireproof performance and<br>
non-combustibility (hereinafter referred to as a<br>
"non-combustible decorative board"). Such a<br>
non-combustible decorative board includes a core<br>
layer, which is a prepreg formed by impregnating an<br>
inorganic fiber nonwoven fabric with a slurry<br>
including phenol resin or melamine resin as a binder<br>
component (see Patent Documents 1-3).<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2004-230611<br>
Patent Document 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 10-44323<br>
Patent Document 3: Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 64-56540<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] However, a non-combustible decorative board in<br>
which a prepreg containing phenol resin as a binder<br>
component is used as a core layer has a limitation in<br>
additive amount of the binder component, in order to<br>
ensure non-combustibility. Accordingly, a finished<br>
non-combustible decorative board is slightly<br>
inferior in strength and interlayer adhesion. Also,<br>
since the additive amount of the binder component is<br>
limited, and thereby a blending ratio of an inorganic<br>
filler is increased, smoothness of a surface of the<br>
non-combustible decorative board may be<br>
deteriorated.<br>
[0004] On the other hand, a non-combustible<br>
decorative board, in which a prepreg containing<br>
melamine resin as a binder component is used as a<br>
core layer can ensure non-combustibility even when<br>
the additive amount of the binder component is<br>
significantly increased, as compared with the case of<br>
phenol resin. However, melamine resin itself is<br>
hard and brittle, and thus the finished<br>
non-combustible decorative board sometimes has an<br>
inferior strength.<br>
[0005] The present invention, which was made in view<br>
of the above, has an object to obtain a decorative<br>
board having non-combustibility while achieving<br>
excellent interlayer adhesion, strength and surface<br>
smoothness.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0006] A decorative board in the present invention<br>
includes a core layer constituted by a prepreg<br>
including an inorganic fiber substrate impregnated<br>
with a slurry and a decorative layer, and the slurry<br>
contains (a) an organic resin component including a<br>
phenol-formaldehyde resin and an<br>
amino-formaldehyde resin, (b) one or more selected<br>
from a group consisting of carbonate, silica, talc and<br>
fly ash, and (c) a metal hydroxide.<br>
[0007] The decorative board in the present invention<br>
has a high non-combustibility, and also has high<br>
interlayer adhesion and strength since the core<br>
layer is constituted by the prepreg including the<br>
inorganic fiber substrate impregnated with (a) the<br>
organic resin component including the<br>
phenol-formaldehyde resin and the<br>
amino-formaldehyde resin, (b) one or more selected<br>
from the group consisting of carbonate, silica, talc<br>
and fly ash, and (c) the metal hydroxide.<br><br>
[0008] The decorative board in the present invention<br>
has an excellent surface smoothness since the<br>
decorative board includes the above-described core<br>
layer (particularly since the component (b) and the<br>
component (c) are contained in the slurry).<br>
[0009] The decorative board in the present invention<br>
preferably contains a silane coupling agent in the<br>
slurry. Concurrent use of the silane coupling agent<br>
with the phenol-formaldehyde resin and the<br>
amino-formaldehyde resin can further improve<br>
physical properties, such as adhesion,<br>
non-combustibility, strength, heat resistance, and<br>
impregnation property.<br>
[0010] As the silane coupling agent, for example, an<br>
epoxy silane coupling agent, an amino silane<br>
coupling agent, and an acryl silane coupling agent<br>
are preferable in terms of adhesion. Especially<br>
when an epoxy silane coupling agent is used, its<br>
high reactivity with an amino-formaldehyde resin<br>
and a phenol-formaldehyde resin leads to an<br>
improved interlayer strength.<br>
[0011] Also, when an amino silane coupling agent is<br>
used, its high reactivity with an<br>
amino-formaldehyde resin and a<br>
phenol-formaldehyde resin leads to an improved<br><br>
interlayer strength.<br>
[0012] The epoxy silane coupling agent includes, for<br>
example,<br>
B-(3, 4 - epoxycyclohexyL)ethyltrimethoxysilane),<br>
Y-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
Y-glycidyloxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane,<br>
glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, etc.<br>
[0013] The amino silane coupling agent includes, for<br>
example, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-<br>
aminopropyltriethoxysilane,<br>
N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropylmethyldimethoxy<br>
silane, N-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)ethylenediamine,<br>
3-ureidepropyltriethoxysilane,<br>
isopropyltri(N-amidoethyl-aminoethyl)titanate,<br>
etc.<br>
[0014] The acryl silane coupling agent includes, for<br>
example, a silane coupling agent having a<br>
methacrylo group in a framework, such as<br>
Y- methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane and<br>
Y- methacryloxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane, etc.<br>
[0015] In the slurry, a blending amount of the silane<br>
coupling agent is preferably 0.01-0.5 parts by<br>
weight per part by weight of the solid content of the<br>
component (a). Since the blending amount of the<br><br>
silane coupling agent is 0.01 or more parts by weight,<br>
strength and interlayer adhesion of the decorative<br>
board are further improved. Also, since the<br>
blending amount of the silane coupling agent is 0.5<br>
or less parts by weight, impregnation<br>
appropriateness of the slurry is further improved.<br>
[0016] In the slurry, a blending amount in solid<br>
equivalent of the amino-formaldehyde resin is<br>
preferably 0.1-5 parts by weight per part by weight<br>
of a solid content of the phenol-formaldehyde resin.<br>
[0017] Since the blending amount of the<br>
amino-formaldehyde resin is 0.1 or more parts by<br>
weight, strength and interlayer adhesion of the<br>
decorative board are further increased. Also, since<br>
the blending amount is 5 or less parts by weight,<br>
warpage of the decorative board can be reduced.<br>
[0018] A total blending amount in solid equivalent of<br>
the component (b) and the component (c) is<br>
preferably 4-19 parts by weight per part by weight of<br>
a solid content of the component (a).<br>
[0019] Since the total blending amount in solid<br>
equivalent of the component (b) and the component<br>
(c) is 4 or more parts by weight, non-combustibility<br>
is further improved. Also, the total blending<br>
amount is 19 or less parts by weight, interlayer<br><br>
adhesion is further increased.<br>
[0020] A content ratio of the slurry in the prepreg is<br>
preferably 500-3000% according to a calculation<br>
method indicated by a formula 1.<br>
[0021] [Formula l]<br><br>
Since the content ratio of the slurry in the<br>
prepreg is 500 % or more, interlayer adhesion is<br>
further improved. Also, since the content of the<br>
slurry is 3000 % or less, falling of a solid content is<br>
unlikely to increase, and thus easier handling of the<br>
decorative board can be achieved.<br>
[0022] The inorganic fiber substrate includes, for<br>
example, an unwoven fabric or a woven fabric, etc.<br>
constituted by inorganic fiber, such as glass fiber,<br>
rock wool, carbon fiber, and ceramic fiber.<br>
Particularly preferable is a glass fiber unwoven<br>
fabric, which is excellent in heat resistance, flame<br>
resistance, and easiness of slurry impregnation. It<br>
is preferable that the inorganic fiber substrate<br>
weighs in a range of 10-200 g/m2.<br>
[0023] The phenol-formaldehyde resin is obtained, for<br>
example, by reacting one of phenols with one of<br>
formaldehydes at a ratio of 1 mol of a phenol<br>
hydroxyl group to 1-3 mols of an aldehyde under the<br>
influence of a basic catalyst or an acid catalyst.<br>
The phenols include, for example, phenol, cresol,<br>
xylenol, octylphenol, phenylphenol, bisphenol A,<br>
bisphenol S, bisphenol F, etc. The aldehydes<br>
include, for example, formaldehyde,<br>
paraformaldehyde, glyoxal, trioxal, etc.<br>
[0024] Also, as needed, a phenol-formaldehyde resin<br>
which is modified with a modifier for accelerating<br>
plasticization, such as urea, urea derivative,<br>
paratoluenesulfonamide, wood oil, phosphate esters,<br>
and glycols, may be applicable.<br>
[0025] The basic catalyst to be used for synthesizing of<br>
the phenol-formaldehyde resin includes, for example,<br>
oxides or hydroxides of alkali metals (such as<br>
sodium and potassium) or alkaline-earth metals<br>
(magnesium, calcium, and the like), amines, such as<br>
triethylamine and triethanolamine, ammonia, etc.<br>
The acid catalyst includes, for example,<br>
para-toluenesulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid, etc.<br>
[0026] As the amino-formaldehyde resin, for example,<br>
an initial condensate obtained by reacting an amino<br>
compound (such as melamine, urea, benzoguanamine,<br>
and acetoguanamine) and formaldehyde, a substance<br>
obtained by etherifying the initial condensate with a<br>
lower alcohol, such as methyl alcohol and butyl<br>
alcohol, and a substance obtained by modifying the<br>
initial condensate with a reactive modifier for<br>
accelerating plasticization, such as<br>
para-toluenesulfonamide, may be applicable.<br>
Among these, melamine-formaldehyde resin which is<br>
excellent in durability is preferable.<br>
[0027] The metal hydroxide includes, for example,<br>
aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide.<br>
[0028] The carbonate includes, for example, calcium<br>
carbonate, magnesium carbonate, barium carbonate,<br>
strontium carbonate, beryllium carbonate, zinc<br>
carbonate, etc.<br>
[0029] An average particle diameter of the component<br>
(b) is preferably in a range of 0.5-200 µm. When<br>
the average particle diameter is in this range,<br>
impregnation appropriateness of the slurry into the<br>
inorganic substrate can be further improved.<br>
[0030] It is preferable to use, as the component (b), a<br>
carbonate, particularly calcium carbonate, which is<br>
advantageous in terms of workability and cutting<br>
performance, and use, as the component (c),<br>
aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide which<br>
is advantageous in terms of non-combustibility since<br>
crystal water is contained, and, at a high<br>
temperature, decomposition occurs, endotherm is<br>
performed, and bonding water is released. In this<br>
case, a blending ratio of the carbonate and the metal<br>
hydroxide (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium<br>
hydroxide) is preferably 1 part by weight of the<br>
carbonate to 2-15 parts by weight of the metal<br>
hydroxide so that a smooth and good surface<br>
appearance can be obtained. Since a blending<br>
amount of the metal hydroxide is 2 or more parts by<br>
weight, an excellent non-combustibility can be<br>
achieved. Since the blending amount of the metal<br>
hydroxide is 15 or less parts by weight, the metal<br>
hydroxide in the slurry is unlikely to precipitate,<br>
and thus an impregnation amount of the slurry can<br>
be easily controlled. Also, since the blending<br>
amount of the metal hydroxide is 15 or less parts by<br>
weight, wear of a cutting tool to be used for cutting<br>
the decorative board can be reduced.<br>
[0031] Although there is no limitation to the calcium<br>
carbonate and, for example, heavy calcium<br>
carbonate, light calcium carbonate (precipitated<br>
calcium carbonate) or the like may be used, heavy<br>
calcium carbonate is preferable. An average<br>
particle diameter of the calcium carbonate is<br>
preferably in a range of 0.05-10 µm, and more<br>
preferably in a range of 1-5 µm. In a case of 0.05(1)<br>
µm or more, secondary aggregation is unlikely to<br>
occur and agglomerates are unlikely to be formed,<br>
and thus an excellent impregnation property of the<br>
slurry can be achieved. In a case of 10(5) µm or<br>
less, the decorative board has a further smooth<br>
surface and thus has a good appearance. The light<br>
calcium carbonate means calcium carbonate<br>
chemically produced by baking limestone, while the<br>
heavy calcium carbonate means fine-powdered<br>
calcium carbonate produced by dry or wet<br>
pulverization of white crystalline limestone.<br>
[0032] In the decorative board of the present invention,<br>
the decorative layer may be provided either on one<br>
side of the core layer or on both sides thereof.<br>
Forming methods of the decorative layer include, for<br>
example, a forming method by painting, a method<br>
using resin impregnated decorative paper, a method<br>
of transferring a decorative layer using a transfer<br>
foil, etc. Among these, the method using resin<br>
impregnated decorative paper is particularly<br>
preferable in terms of productivity, adhesion with<br>
the core layer, and wear resistance.<br>
[0033] The forming method by painting includes, for<br>
example, a method by painting on the core layer a<br>
resin liquid, in which a curing agent (such as methyl<br>
ethyl ketone peroxide), a curing accelerator (such as<br>
cobalt naphthenate) are blended to unsaturated<br>
polyester resin colored with a pigment, and<br>
subsequently covering a painted surface with a<br>
vinylon film or a PET film, spreading with a roller,<br>
and peeling the vinylon film after the resin is cured.<br>
[0034] The unsaturated polyester resin is obtained by<br>
performing a dehydration-condensation reaction,<br>
according to a usual method, of an unsaturated<br>
dibasic acid and/or an acid anhydride thereof,<br>
another saturated acid and/or an acid anhydride<br>
thereof to be used as needed, and a polyalcohol,<br>
under an inert gas atmosphere, such as nitrogen and<br>
argon, at a temperature of about 160-230°C and<br>
preferably 210-230°C, and then adding a<br>
polymerizable monomer, such as styrene monomer.<br>
[0035] The method using resin impregnated decorative<br>
paper is a method in which a base paper for<br>
decorative board is impregnated with a resin liquid<br>
containing a thermosetting resin as a main<br>
component and is dried to obtain a resin<br>
impregnated decorative paper, and then the resin<br>
impregnated decorative paper is stacked and<br>
thermocompression forming is performed. The<br>
resin impregnated decorative paper may be obtained<br>
by impregnating a resin liquid containing a<br>
thermosetting resin, such as amino-formaldehyde<br>
resin, diallyl phthalate resin, and unsaturated<br>
polyester resin into a decorative paper for<br>
decorative board weighing 30-140 g/m2 such that an<br>
impregnation rate as indicated by the formula 2 is<br>
80-300%. Thermocompression forming may be<br>
performed using a press machine, such as a flat<br>
press machine and a continuous press machine.<br>

(Evaluation of Decorative Boards)<br>
The decorative boards produced in the<br>
respective embodiments and comparative examples<br>
were evaluated according to a method described<br>
below.<br>
(i) Evaluation of Non-combustibility<br>
Heat release tests using a cone calorimeter<br>
according to ISO5660 were performed, and<br>
evaluation was made according to the following<br>
criteria.<br>
[0067] During a test for 20 minutes, a total heat<br>
release is equal to or less than 8MJ/m2, a maximum<br>
heat release rate remains not exceeding 200 kW/m2<br>
for consecutive 10 seconds or more, and a test object<br>
after the test has no breakage or crack passing<br>
through to a reverse surface thereof.<br>
 During a test for 10 minutes, a total heat<br>
release is equal to or less than 8MJ/m2, a maximum<br>
heat release rate remains not exceeding 200 kW/m2<br>
for consecutive 10 seconds or more, and a test object<br>
after the test has no breakage or crack passing<br>
through to a reverse surface thereof.<br>
 Any one of requirements indicated in or<br>
 is not satisfied.<br><br>
(ii) Evaluation of Heat-resistant Adhesion<br>
A heating body held at a temperature of 200°C<br>
was made to contact with a surface of each<br>
decorative board for 10 minutes, and evaluation was<br>
made according to the following criteria.<br>
[0068] No interlayer delamination, swelling or<br>
crack occurs after 10 minutes.<br>
 Interlayer delamination, swelling or crack<br>
occurs in 5 minutes or more and less than 10<br>
minutes.<br>
 Interlayer delamination, swelling or crack<br>
occurs in 30 seconds or more and less than 5 minutes.<br>
X : Remarkable delamination, swelling or crack<br>
occurs in 30 seconds or less.<br>
(iii) Evaluation of Strength<br>
A steel ball of 28 g was dropped on the surface<br>
of each non-combustible decorative board while<br>
gradually increasing a dropping height, and<br>
evaluation was made according to the following<br>
criteria.<br>
[0069] The dropping height is 800 mm or more when<br>
a crack occurs.<br>
 The dropping height is 700 mm or more and<br>
less than 800 mm when a crack occurs.<br>
 The dropping height is 600 mm or more and<br><br>
less than 700 mm when a crack occurs.<br>
 The dropping height is less than 600 mm<br>
when a crack occurs.<br>
(iv) Evaluation of impregnation property<br>
Evaluation was made on impregnation property<br>
of the slurry used in each of the embodiments and<br>
comparative examples according to the following<br>
criteria.<br>
[0070] It was possible to impregnate a glass fiber<br>
substrate with the slurry corresponding to a desired<br>
resin rate in a continuous and stable manner for a<br>
long time period.<br>
 Although desired impregnation was<br>
possible, periodic adjustment of slurry viscosity or<br>
the like was required in a case of performing<br>
continuous impregnation.<br>
 Although desired impregnation was<br>
possible, continuous impregnation was impossible<br>
due to large effects of time-dependent changing<br>
factors, such as thickening.<br>
 An impregnation amount could not be<br>
controlled due to aggregation,<br>
(v) Evaluation of surface smoothness<br>
Evaluation was made on a degree of "orange<br>
peel" of the surface of the decorative board.<br>
Measurement of the surface of the decorative board<br>
was performed three times using a BYK Gardener<br>
wave-scan DOI (an orange peel/distinctness of image<br>
measuring instrument). Evaluation was made on<br>
average values of Longwave values and Wc values,<br>
respectively, according to criteria shown in Table 2<br>
below. It is indicated that the lower the Longwave<br>
value or the Wc value is, the greater the smoothness<br>
is.<br><br>
Evaluation results are shown in Table 3.<br>
As shown in Table 3, the decorative board in<br>
each of the embodiments was excellent in any of<br>
non-combustibility, heat resistant adhesion,<br>
strength, impregnation appropriateness, and surface<br>
smoothness.<br>
[0073] Also, in the decorative board in each of the<br>
embodiments, chipping during a cutting process,<br>
delamination of a decorative layer, edge defect, dent<br>
or crack during construction work will not occur,<br>
and interlayer puncture due to radiant heat will not<br>
occur when the decorative board is used for a<br>
cooking stove.<br>
