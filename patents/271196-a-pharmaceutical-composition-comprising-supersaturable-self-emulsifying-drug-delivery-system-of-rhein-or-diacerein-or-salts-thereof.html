SUPERSATURABLE SELF EMULSIFYING DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM OF<br>
RHEIN OR DIACEREIN OR SALTS THEREOF<br>
2. APPLICANT (S)<br>
(a)	NAME: WOCKHARDT LTD.<br>
(b)	NATIONALITY: INDIAN<br>
(c)	ADDRESS: D-4, M.I.D.C. Area, Chikalthana, Aurangabad - 431210,<br>
(M.S.) INDIA.<br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
There is provided a supersaturable self-emulsifying drug delivery system comprising rhein or diacerein, or salts, or esters, or prodrug thereof optionally with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
4. Description<br>
There is provided a supersaturable self-emulsifying drug delivery system comprising rhein or diacerein, or salts or esters, or prodrug thereof optionally with one or more pharmaceuticaly acceptable excipients.<br>
Rhein, (Formula I), is chemically 9, 10-dihydro-4, 5-dihydroxy-9, 10-dioxo-2-anthracene carboxylic acid and diacerein, (Formula II), is chemically 4,5-bis (acetyloxy) 9,10-dihydro-4, 5-dihydroxy-9, 10-dioxo-2-anthracenecarboxylic acid. Diacerein is used particularly in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Diacerein has a unique mode of action that differentiates it from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other conventional forms of drug therapy. It has a melting point of 217-218°C. It has a molecular weight of 368.29 and molecular formula is C19H1208.<br>
OH	O	OH<br><br>
Formula-I<br><br>
Formula-ll<br><br><br>
Diacerein is practically insoluble in the solvents compatible with a pharmaceutical use, such as water, alcohols, acetone, dichloromethane and chloroform. Further, diacerein can be administered by oral route but it cannot be completely absorbed by the digestive tract, and this incomplete absorption may result in undesirable side effects such as laxatives effects.<br>
In order to overcome these problems, various derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions and specific galenic forms have been proposed in the literature. For example, European patent EP 243,968 describes a diacerein potassium salt, which is water-soluble and can be used in the preparation of compositions for parenteral administration.<br>
Besides, it is known that the solubility and/or wettability of a substance can be improved by treatment with a surface-active agent, which results in promoting the bioavailability of the active principle.<br>
It is also known that the grinding of active principles in the presence of certain water-soluble polymers improves the solubility and the bioavailability of the product (Yamamoto et al., J. Pharm. Sci. (1976) 65, p. 1484-88).<br>
There are various patents/applications, which describe pharmaceutical compositions of diacerein. For example, EP243968B1 provides parenteral preparations of diacerein salts.<br>
US Patent No 6,124,358 and European Patent No EP904060B1 provides pharmaceutical composition comprising co-micronized rhein or diacerein, with sodium lauryl sulfate. Here sodium lauryl sulfate acts a wetting agent and is just co micronized with diacerein and the formulation is in solid form and not a liquid or emulsion or self-emulsifying system.<br>
3<br><br>
Although it is possible to improve the bioavailability of diacerein by comicronization, as described in EP 904061B1; US 6,124,358, it is still desirable to develop new formulations or new compositions likely to further improve the bioavailability, and it might be possible to use the dissolution kinetics of diacerein.<br>
US Patent No 5,149,542 (EP263083B1), 4,861,599 (EP 264989B1) and 5,275,824 (EP 446753B1) provides controlled release or delayed release compositions.<br>
US Patent No 5,225,192 (EP 364944B1) and 5,569,469 describe different poorly soluble medicaments supported on polymer substances.<br>
US Patent No 5,952,383 and European Patent No EP 862423B1 provides pharmaceutical compositions of diacerein, rhein and their salts along with excipients.<br>
The inventors have discovered while working on the diacerein composition, that when diacerein is formulated in self-emulsifying drug delivery system; it results in significant increase in solubility of diacerein and percent drug release of diacerein as compared to Art 50 (Marketed formulation of diacerein). However, the high surfactant level typically present in self-emulsifying drug delivery system leads to gastrointestinal side effects as well as a reduction in the free drug concentration and thus a reduced rate of intestinal absorption. The inventors have now developed supersaturable self-emulsifying drug delivery system (S-SEDDS) in an attempt to reduce the surfactant side effects and achieve rapid absorption of poorly soluble drugs. The S-SEDDS compositions contain a reduced surfactant level as compared to conventional SEDDS system, hence leading to reduced Gl side effects. The supersaturable self-emulsifying drug delivery system comprises polymers in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle comprising oil and/or emulsifiers, which forms an emulsion on contact with an aqueous environment. The polymers prevent precipitation of the drug by generating and maintaining a<br>
4<br><br>
supersaturated state in vivo. The system generates a supersaturated solution of the drug when the composition is released from an appropriate dosage form into an aqueous medium. Art 50 releases about 13% of diacerein in 120 minutes, whereas pharmaceutical composition of the invention releases more than 60 % of diacerein in 120 minutes. This leads to increased bioavailability. The increased bioavailability further leads to reduction in side effects i.e. soft stools.<br>
In one of the embodiments of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising supersaturable self-emulsifying drug delivery system of rhein or diacerein, or salts or esters, or prodrug thereof optionally with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising supersaturable self-emulsifying drug delivery system of rhein or diacerein, or salts or esters or prodrugs thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable polymers, optionally with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising supersaturable self-emulsifying drug delivery system of rhein or diacerein, or salts or esters, or prodrug thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable polymers in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, optionally with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising supersaturable self-emulsifying drug delivery system of rhein or diacerein, or salts or esters, or prodrug thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable polymers in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, optionally with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle comprises one or more emulsifiers.<br>
5<br><br>
In another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising supersaturable self-emulsifying drug delivery system of rhein or diacerein, or salts or esters, or prodrug thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable polymers in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, optionally with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle comprises one or more emulsifiers and/or oil.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising supersaturable self-emulsifying drug delivery system of rhein or diacerein, or salts or esters, or prodrug thereof, and wherein the composition exhibits a dissolution profile such that within 120 minutes at least 60 % of diacerein is released, wherein the release rate is measured in Apparatus 2 (USP, Dissolution, paddle, 75 rpm) using 1000 ml of pH 5.7 Tampon phosphate buffer at 37 °C ± 0.5°C.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a process of preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising supersaturable self-emulsifying drug delivery system of rhein or diacerein, or salts or esters, or prodrug thereof, which process comprises of mixing rhein or diacerein or salts or esters or prodrugs thereof with suitable emulsifiers and pharmaceutically acceptable polymers optionally with other pharmaceutical additives and converting the mixture into suitable dosage form.<br>
