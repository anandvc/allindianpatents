POLYISOCYANATE COMPOSITIONS AND A PROCESS FOR THE<br>
5	PRODUCTION OF LOW-DENSITY FLEXIBLE FOAMS WITH LOW<br>
HUMID AGED COMPRESSION SETS FROM THESE POLYISOCYANATE COMPOSITIONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
10	This invention relates to novel polyisocyanate compositions, to a<br>
process for the production of these polyisocyanate compositions, to a process for the production of cold cure flexible molded foam wherein the isocyanate component comprises the polyisocyanate composition of the present invention, and to the cold cure flexible molded foams produced by this process.<br>
Mixtures of diisocyanates based on diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and polymethylene poly(phenyl isocyanate) (i.e. polymeric MDI or PMDI), and prepolymers based on such mixtures are known and described in the art. The use of these mixtures of diisocyanates based on 20     MDI and polymeric MDI or PMDI, and prepolymers based on such<br>
mixtures in the art of manufacturing flexible polyurethane foam is also known and described in, for example, U.S. Patents 4,239,856, 4,256,849, 4,261,852 and 4,365,025.<br>
Numerous patents have issued which describe mixtures of diphenylmethane diisocyanates (MDI), polymethylene poly(phenyl isocyanate), and prepolymers based on these mixtures. See, for example, U.S. Patents 3,152,162, 3,644,457, 3,701,796, 4,055,548, 4,118,411, 4,154,752, 4,177,205, 4,261,852, 4,442,235, 4,478,960, 4,490,302, 4,910,333, 5,070,114, 5,240,635, 5,246,977, 5,266,604, 5,350,778, 5,399,594, 5,563,232, 5,585,452, 5,877,227, 6,077,456 and 6,090,864. It is known that MDI can be readily liquefied through carbodiimi-dization. Typical of this process are the processes described in U.S. Patents 3,152,162, 3,384,643, 3,449,256, 3,640,966, 3,641,093, 3,701,796, 4,014,935, 4,088,665, 4,154,752, and 4,177,205.<br><br>
Mo-5977<br>
It is also known, although less common, that MDI can be reacted<br>
with N,N-di-(2-hydroxy-propyl)ani(ine (as described in U.S. Patent<br>
3,394,165) and heating with N.N'-disubstituted thioureas (as described in<br>

1500, and ii) up to 30% by weight of a second isocyanate<br>
which can be the 2,4'-isomer or a polymethylene poly(phenyl<br>

Other liquid isocyanate compositions are described in U.S. Patents 4,365,025, 4,525,490, 4,644,018, 5,070,114, 5,266,604 and 5,430,072.<br>
The liquid isocyanates of U.S. Patent 4,365,025 are prepolymers prepared from (a) a mixture of MDI and PMDI having a functionality of greater than 2.0, and (b) one or more polyols having 2 to 3 hydroxy! groups and at least about 50% by weight of oxyethylene groups, wherein the ratio of NCO equivalents to hydroxyl equivalents is from 1.5:1 to 5:1.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,070,114 describes a liquid isocyanate-containing prepolymer having an NCO functionality greater than 2 and an NCO content of from 2 to 12%. These are prepared by reacting (i) an isocyanate-reactive polymer having a nominal functionality of 2 to 4 and an average equivalent weight of about 500 to about 5,000, with (ii) a stoichiometric excess of a MDI composition having an average functionality of from 2 to 2.3 and containing at least 2% by weight of the 2,4'-isomer of MDI.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,266,604 discloses a liquid polyisocyanate prepolymer having a free NCO-group content of from 2 to 15% by weight. These prepolymers comprise the reaction products of an isocyanate-reactive polymer having a nominal functionality of 2 to 6 and an equivalent weight of 500 to 5,000 with a stiochiometric excess of a polyisocyanate. Flexible polyurethane foams can be prepared from these prepolymers by reaction with an isocyanate-reactive composition comprising at least 50% by weight water.<br>
Liquid isocyanate-terminated prepolymers are also disclosed by U.S. Patent 5,399,594. These are characterized by a functionality of 2 or more and have an NCO content of 2 to 15%. The prepolymers are reaction products of an isocyanate-reactive polymer having a functionality<br><br><br>
Mo-5977	<br>
of 2 to 6 and an equivalent weight of 750 to 5,000, with a stoichiometric<br>
excess of an MDI having an average functionality of 2 to 2.3. Flexible<br>
foams can also be prepared from these prepolymers.<br>
A homogenous mixture of two polyisocyanates is disclosed by U.S. Patent 5,430,072. One of the polyisocyanate components is a prepolymer having an NCO group content of from 2 to 15% by weight, and is the reaction product of an isocyanate-reactive compound having a nominal functionality of 2 to 8 and an equivalent weight of 500 to 5,000 with a stoichiometric excess of a MDI composition. The other isocyanate in the homogeneous mixture has an NCO group content of at least 25% by weight. This homogeneous mixture of isocyanates can be used to form flexible polyurethane foams by reaction with an isocyanate-reactive component which is at least 40% by weight water.<br>
The polyisocyanate compositions of U.S. Patent 5,877,227 comprise a semi-prepolymer which is the reaction product of an excess of a base isocyanate formulation with 5 to 50% by wt. of a first polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene polyol, having a nominal functionality of 2 to 4, a molecular weight of 1,000 to 8,000 and an EO content of about 0 to 30% by wt.

This polyisocyanate composition is disclosed as being suitable for the preparation of flexible open celled polyurethane foam prepared by reaction with an isocyanate-reactive component and water as the sole blowing agent.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,877,227 describes the technology used to make the prepolymer used in the comparative example of the present application. Differences between this prepolymer and the prepolymers of the presently claimed invention include 1) the ethylene oxide (EO) content of the polyol, i.e. the present invention requires &gt; 50% of EO in the polyol, and 2) the NCO group content of the prepolymer (the present invention requires 
 <br>
Mo-5977	<br>
20% NCO), followed by blending with polymeric MDI (i.e. a different<br>
process of producing the prepolymer).<br>
Liquid polyisocyanate prepolymer compositions are also disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,077,456. These prepolymers have an NCO group content 5     of 10 to 31%, and comprise the reaction product of an organic polyisocyanate blend and a polyoxyalkylene poiyol. Suitable polyisocyanate blends comprise A) diphenylmethane diisocyanate having 50 to 95% by weight of the 4,4,-isomer, from 6 to 50% by weight of the 2,4-isomer and less than 10% by weight of the 2,2'-isomer; B) a polymethylene polypheny! polyisocyanate comprising 30 to 70 % by weight of MDI, with the balance being PMDI, 2nd having a functionality greater than 2, and C), optionally, a uretonimine-carbodimide modified diisocyanate comprising 10 to 35 % by wt. uretonimine-carbodiimide species, with the balance consisting essentially of pure 4,4'-MDI. Suitable polyoxyalkylene polyols for this process include those having molecular weight of 700 to 10,000 and average functionalities of 1.6 to 3.<br>
U.S. Patent 6,090,864 discloses polymeric MDI prepolymer compositions and their use in the preparation of flexible foams. These prepolymers comprise the reaction product of (a) a polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanate and (b) a polyether polyol having an average hydroxy! equivalent weight of at least about 700, and are characterized as having an average viscosity of between 400 and 7,000 cps at 25°C.<br>
In the production of flexible foams, typical isocyanate-reactive materials include (1) mixtures of polyether triols having molecular weights of 2,000 to 7,000 with diethanolamine as described in, for example, U.S. Patent 4,239,856; (2) mixtures of polyethers having primary hydroxyl groups having molecular weights of 400 to 10,000 with mixtures of low molecular weight active hydrogen containing materials (U.S. Patent 4,256,849); (3) polyoxypropylene or poly(oxypropylene-oxyethylene)diols 30     or triols having equivalent weights of 700 to 2,000 as described in, e.g. U.S. Patent 4,261,852, and (4) water (see U.S. Patent 4,365,025).<br><br><br>
Mo-5977<br>
It is also known to use various low molecular weight crosslinkers in<br>
the manufacture of flexible foams. U.S. Patent 3,067,148 describes the<br>
use of tetrahydric compounds derived from ethylene diamine and alkylene<br>
oxides. U.S. Patent 3,948,825 discloses the use of reaction products of<br>
methylene dianiline and alkylene oxides; and U.S. Patent 4,569,952<br>
describes the use of an addition product of an alkylene oxide and an<br>
aromatic diamine and a mixture of the addition product with an<br>
alkanolamine.<br>
Amines such as, for example, Dytek A which is commonly described as 2-methylpentamethylenediamine, are also known and disclosed as being suitable chain extenders for polyurethane flexible foams.<br>
While many foam formulations based on MDI and PMDI provide adequate properties for many applications, it is generally difficult to have good processability over a broad isocyanate index range. In addition, it would be desirable to develop a flexible foam exhibiting high tear strength, high elongation, and low compression set for automotive seating and headrests, as well as non-automotive seating applications.<br>
Advantages of the present polyisocyanate composition vs. state-of-the art prepolymers with comparable MDI isomer composition include the fact that the polyisocyanate compositions of the present invention can be used to prepare flexible foams which exhibit improved (i.e. reduced) compression set and humid aged compression set properties, and improved (i.e. increased) tear strengths, while maintaining sufficiently high hardness. The concept of blending a low-NCO prepofymer with a monomeric-polymeric MDI allows for variability in optimizing these properties by virtue of varying mix ratios of A(1) and A(2) of the present invention as set forth in the claims.<br>

In accordance with the present invention, the foaming reaction for<br>
producing foam products is often carried out inside molds. In the process,<br>
the foamable reaction mixture is introduced into a mold which may be<br>
made of a metal such as aluminum or a plastics materia! such as an<br>
epoxide resin. The reaction mixture foams up inside the mold to produce<br>
the shaped product. The process of foaming in molds is carried out to<br>
produce a product having a cellular structure on its surface. According to<br>
the invention, the desired result can be obtained by introducing just<br>
sufficient foamable reaction mixture to fill the mold with foam after the<br>
reaction is completed.<br>
So-called externa! mold release agents known in the art, such as silicone waxes and oils, are frequently used when foaming is carried out inside the molds. The process may also be carried out with the aid of so-called internal mold release agents, if desired, in combination with external mold release agents, e.g., described in German Offenlegungsschriften Nos. 2,121,670 and 2,307,589.<br>
Cold setting foams may also be produced, as described in British Patent No. 1,162,517 and German Offenlegungsschriften No. 2,153,086.<br>
Foams may, of course, also be produced by the process of block foaming or by the laminator process known in the art. The products obtainable according to the invention may be used, for example, as upholstery or padding materials.<br>
The following examples further illustrate details for the preparation and use of the compositions of this invention. The invention, which is set forth in the foregoing disclosure, is not to be limited either in spirit or scope by these examples. Those skilled in the art will readily understand that known variations of the conditions and processes of the following preparative procedures can be used to prepare these compositions.

The foams produced in Examples 2 and 3 exhibited higher (i.e.,<br>
improved) elongations, higher (i.e., improved) tear strengths and higher<br>
(i.e., improved) tensile strengths, in addition to the improved (i.e., lower)<br>
compression sets, and the higher hardness (lLD, CFD 40), in comparison<br>
to the foam produced in Comparison Example 1.<br>
As the foam of Example 4, the foam of Example 3 also exhibits lower (i.e., improved) humid aged compression set as the foam of Comparison Example 1, but at a higher hardness level (ILD, CFD 40), and with improved elongation, tear and tensile strength. This result was achieved at a higher %NCO value of the isocyanate component, i.e., less isocyanate was used to make the foam at the same index.<br>
