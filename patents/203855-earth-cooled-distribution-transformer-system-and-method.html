EARTH COOLED DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an earth cooled distribution transformer; system and method wherein the transformer is buried directly in the ground with the transformer having its primary and secondary windings casted in a solid insulating material and its steel magnetic core exposed to provide heat dissipation in the surrounding soil, and further wherein the supply cable and feed power cables may also be buried in the ground, and further wherein a plurality of these transformers may form part of a distribution system buried in ground to supply electrical power to an entire consumer load community.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Distribution transformers are usually mounted in a protection casing which is provided with oil to act as a thermal carrier whereby heat generated by the windings is dissipated through the casing in contact with the oil. The use of oil and casing has proven to be problematic and also increases the physical size of the distribution transformer, making them difficult to directly bury them in the ground. Attempts have been made to bury distribution transformers in the ground as well as their cables which service the homes whereby to eliminate pole-mounted transformers or pad-mounted transformers. However, these buried transformers still required cooling when positioned underground and therefore the transformers were mounted in housings and the oil in the transformer or else the housing was cooled by a system of cooling pipes, also buried in the ground. An example of such distribution transformers construction is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,212,563 and 4,009,418<br>
With the advent of solid or dry transformers the size of the transformer has been greatly reduced but the cooling of such transformer is usually affected by heat<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
exchange  with  air  or  a  liquid  circulated  within  the transformer structure or solid heat sinks in contact with ambient air.  Some of the difficulties encountered with such solid or dry transformers are that heat dissipation through a solid dielectric material has proven to be poor and the result of thermal build-up can create hot spots or high thermal  gradients  which  can  crack  the  solid  dielectric material.  This can lead to serious breakdowns which require the replacement of the transformer.   Also, most of these transformers require a grounded enclosure to remove  any electrical shock hazard.   Such enclosures  are typically metal  cages  having  dimensions  much  larger  than  the transformer   itself,   thus   making   installation   space requirements difficult.<br>
Recently, and with reference to U.S. Patent 5,656,984, improved solid insulating transformers have been developed but these also require the casting of the entire transformer into a surrounding shell or housing. Such are usually mounted in very large manholes whereby to accommodate the cooling equipment which circulates the cooling liquid through the inner coils and core of the transformer to extract heat. Accordingly, such installations are fairly bulky and expensive. Recently, distribution transformers have also been developed wherein the transformer is fully protected by fiberglass and vinylester resin or else the transformer is casted in concrete. Such transformers are usually mounted in manholes and require some form of cooling medium.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,349,801 describes a single-phase transformer wherein the windings are cast in resin and wherein the wound cores are also protected from corrosion and mechanical damage in a suitable encapsulation of shock-proof construction whereby to permit the sealed transformer to be buried in the soil. Waterproof connector sockets are provided to connect underground cable thereto. Figure 3 of the  patent  illustrates  such  a  buried-type  construction.<br><br>
-3-<br>
These transformers are costly to fabricate, are bulky and develop the problems associated with overheating.<br>
U.S, Patent No. 4,236,13 4 teaches a multiphase transformer for power distribution and wherein the transformer is contained within a solid block of cast resin. The block is then buried in ground with sand disposed thereabout, except on top where it is earth filled. The sand assures minimum of heat removal, This design is contrary to applicant's system where the transformer is exposed to ground to dissipate heat.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is a feature of the present invention to provide a power distribution transformer structure which can be buried directly in ground without the use of a cooling agent, whereby the surrounding earth provides the cooling medium, to dissipate heat generated by the transformer windings.<br>
Another feature of the present invention is to provide an earth cooled distribution transformer wherein the primary and secondary windings are casted in a solid insulating material with the steel magnetic core remaining relatively exposed and providing for the conduction of heat generated by the windings to dissipate the heat in the surrounding earth.<br>
Another feature of the present invention is to provide an earth cooled distribution transformer which is buried in ground and wherein the high voltage supply cable as well as the power distribution cable of the secondary winding are also buried in ground to form an underground power' distribution network to feed electrical power to a plurality of consumer load's.<br>
Another feature of the present invention is to provide an earth cooled distribution transformer which is buried in ground adjacent a manhole enclosure and wherein the  connections  to the transformer are provided through<br><br>
-4-<br>
terminals mounted in the manhole and connected directly into the buried transformer adjacent to the manhole.<br>
Another feature of the present invention is to provide a method of cooling a distribution transformer by burying the transformer in ground with the primary and secondary windings of the transformer being encapsulated in a solid insulating material and the core being exposed to the surrounding earth to provide heat dissipation into the earth.<br>
Another feature of the present invention is to provide a method of distributing electrical power to a plurality of consumer loads through distribution transformers which are buried directly into the ground ana wherein the primary and secondary windings of the transformers are insulated in a solid insulating material with their cores being exposed to provide heat dissipation within the surrounding earth,<br>
According to the above features, from a broad aspect, the present invention provides an earth, cooled distribution transformer system which comprises a distribution transformer having a steel magnetic core defining core legs about which primary and secondary windings are respectively wound. Each of the windings is insulated by a solid insulating material. The distribution transformer is buried . at a predetermined depth in ground with the steel core exposed to the ground whereby to dissipate heat generated by the windings in the ground to cool the transformer by the surrounding earth. A high voltage supply cable is connected to the primary winding and extends at least partly in the ground. A power distribution cable is connected to the secondary winding and extends at least partly in the ground to feed power to one or more consumer loads.<br>

insulated cables, and an exposed core. The transformer is buried in soil at a desired depth with the core in contact with the soil whereby to dissipate heat in the soil which acts as a cooling medium.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS   <br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing an installation of the earth cooled distribution transformer of the present invention directly buried in the ground adjacent a manhole enclosure;<br><br>
-6 -<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of the power distribution transformer buried in ground to dissipate heat in the surrounding cool earth; and<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic illustration showing a distribution network consisting of a plurality of directly buried distribution transformers feeding a plurality of consumer loads.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to Figure 1, there is shown generally at 10 the earth cooled distribution transformer of the present invention which is directly buried in the ground 11 and as hereinshown adjacent a manhole enclosure 12. As also shown in Figure 2, the distribution transformer 10 has a steel magnetic core 13 which defines core legs 14 and 15 about which a primary winding 16 and a secondary winding 17 are wound. Each of the windings 16 and 17 are insulated by a solid insulating resin material 18 as well known in the art. The steel magnetic core 13 remains exposed.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the power distribution transformer 10 is buried in the ground 11 at a predetermined depth "d" at which the surrounding ground temperature is at approximately 8°C which is ideal for cooling the transformer. " Because the steel core 13 is exposed to the surrounding earth 19 heat generated by the coils 16 and 17 is transmitted through the core 13 and dissipated into the ground 19. Accordingly, the surrounding ground provides the cooling medium for the transformer and the core acts as a heat sink.<br>
A high voltage supply cable 20 is connected to the primary winding 16 and a power distribution cable is connected to the secondary winding 17. Both these cables extend at least partly in the ground 11. The power distribution cable may be connected to an underground or above-ground terminal whereby to supply power to a plurality of consumer loads usually four or six residential homes.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
As hereinshown, the high voltage supply cable, which usually carries approximately 25 KV is connected directly to the primary winding as well as the distribution cable 21. Accordingly, there is no need to provide bushings on the transformer thus resulting in a cost saving. Also, because the transformer is directly exposed to the surrounding earth, there is no need to provide a casing nor an insulating medium. This results in a substantial cost saving in the construction of such power distribution transformers and the size is reduced as there is no housing nor cooling devices.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, when the power distribution transformer 10 is buried adjacent a manhole enclosure, such as the enclosure 12 illustrated herein, the high voltage supply cable 20 is fed directly into the manhole and connected to the high voltage terminal 22 through a fault detector device 23. A primary supply cable 20' interconnects the primary winding 16 to the terminal 2 2 and a current limiting fuse 24 is preferably connected to this cable. Another section of the high voltage cable 20 is also connected to the terminal 2 2 and out of the manhole whereby to supply a further manhole or to connect directly to another distribution transformer, depending on the installation.<br>
As 'shown in Figure l, the manhole is also provided with a junction box 2 5 where the 12 0/240 volt supply to the consumer loads is provided. The junction box supplies power to a plurality of consumer loads, as illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
Referring again to Figure 2,  it is pointed out that the steel magnetic core 13 may be provided with a thermally-conductive coating 2 6 so as to retard oxidation of the core when exposed to earth.  Also, as shown in Figure 1, a grounding rod 27 may be secured in the ground adjacent the buried transformer 10 and the steel magnetic core may be connected to this grounding rod by a suitable conductor 28, as hereinshown.   Additionally,  as shown in Figure 2,  the<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
primary and secondary windings may both be provided with a conductive paint such as a carbon paint 2 9 on the outer insulated surface thereof to provide better thermal conductivity into the surrounding earth. A manhole cover 3 0 provides access to the interior of the manhole enclosure for installation and servicing.<br>
With reference to Figure 3,  it can be seen that the  earth cooled distribution  transformer system of  the present invention has many advantages.  As shown in Figure 3, a complete underground direct buried power distribution system may be provided whereby to feed an entire community of  consumer  loads.     As  hereinshown,  a  plurality  of transformers 10 are buried under the ground 11 and each feeds a plurality of consumer loads 31.   The primary and secondary windings of the transformer may be provided with suitable  terminals  to' provide  interconnection  of  the transformers as well as the consumer loads directly to the transformers-   Alternatively,  underground or above-ground junction  boxes  may  be  provided  in  suitable  safety enclosures.    However,  when  the  distribution  system  is entirely underground,  the ground also provides electrical insulation of the distribution system and safety to the people above ground.    TD locate  the power distribution transformers a suitable indicating means would be secured into the ground surface directly above the transformer.  The life expectancy of such directly buried transformers and cables is expected to be at least 40 years which is quite suitable as very little or no maintenance will be necessary for such installations as there are no underground bushings or  cooling  mediums  or  powered  equipment  necessary  to circulate a cooling medium into the transformers.  Thus, the transformer  is  self-sustaining  with  the  cooling  being effected by the natural condition of the surrounding earth. In the event of explosion the earth will absorb the shock and prevent debris projectiles.   The transformer will also not contaminate the earth.<br><br>
-9-<br>
The  present  invention  can  be  summarized  as providing a method of cooling a distribution transformer which comprises the provision of the transformer 10 with its steel magnetic core 13 being exposed to surrounding earth when buried in ground and with its windings 16 and 17 being encapsulated in solid insulating material.  A supply cable and a power distribution cable is secured to the primary and secondary windings respectively and also laid entirely or partly  underground,    The  transformer  is  buried  at  a predetermined depth where it is known that the temperature surrounding the transformer will be sufficient to cool the transformer and this  temperature has  been found to be adequate when at approximately 8oC,   The depth that the transformer is buried varies  from location to  location depending on the composition, of the earth in the ground and other  factors  such  as  geographical  locations.     The transformers may also be buried adjacent manhole enclosures as shown in Figure 1 although this is not necessary.  It is also conceivable that a single manhole enclosure may be associated with  one  or  more buried power  distribution transformers 10 of the present invention.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other underground distribution networks while using the same method    and    system    as    hereinabove    described.<br><br>
