SPECIFICATION<br>
Section 10<br>
"LEVELLER BAR FOR COKING OVENS"<br>
DEUTSCHE MONTAN TECHNOLOGIE GmbH, Franz-Fisher-Weg 61, D-45307 Essen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly  describes  and  ascertains  the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to levelling bar for coking ovens.<br>
Prom EP 0 483 497 Bl a generic levelling bar is known, which comprises two vertical plates of sheer metal arranged in longitudinal direction of the oven and spaced parallel from each other, where in the intervening space between the plates transverse coal deflecting/entraining devices (coal carriers) in the form of sheet metal walls up to the height of the plates are positioned at regular intervals. Shortly before the toal chute cones forming during the charging process under the charging holes of the coking oven chamber reach up to the gas collecting space, which needs to be left unobstructed, the levelling bar is inserted into the coking oven chamber through the levelling bar opening and is moved back and forth thereby levelling the coal chute cones.    In order to avoid a substantial portion of the gas collecting apace above the coal being obstructed after the insertion of the levelling bar into the oven chamber", the coal carriers do not extend over the entire width of the intervening space between the two plates but exetend alternately successively from one plate or the other toward the opposite plate. The plates are therefore connected to each other by spacing rods.<br><br>
It has been found in the application of such a levelling bar that, during the levelling process, in spite of the alternately arranged intervening space between the plates and the free ends of the coal carriers, the alternating iniervening spaces may be blocked by the coal to be levelled so that the charging gas can no longer be withdrawn to the gas collecting main without hindrance. This results in more or less strong, uncontrolled emissions, since the charging gas can no longer be freely withdrawn via the ascension pipe.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a levelling bar. which ensures at all times during the levelling process a sufficiently unhindered gas passage in the gas collecting space and simultaneously ensures an efficient oven charging rate.<br>
The object of the present invention is achieved by the characterisation of Claim 1.<br>
The subclaims contain advantageous embodiments of the invention.<br>
The levelling bar in accordance with the invention has the advantage that during the levelling process an unobstructed gas channel is created in the intervening space between the checks or plates of the levelling bar through which channel me charging gas has unhindered horizontal flow towards the ascension pipe or gas collecting main<br>
This gas channel has a particularly reliable design if, in accordance with a further development of the invention, the coal carriers have a maximum heighi which corresponds to half the height of the cheeks.<br><br>
Since the levelling; bar is open at the front, it pushes into the coal chute cone and levels the cone by means of the coal carriers. This does not lead to the occiurencc of a piling up of the coal cones in front of the levelling bar as is the case in the levelling bars of prior art To ensure that the levelling bar has a sufficient transport capacity, according to the present invention the number of the coal carriers is increased. To ensure that the transport capacity of the levelling bar according to the invention corresponds at least to the transport capacity of the known levelling bar (EP 0 483 497 Bl). the number of die coal carriers is at least such that the sum of all partial areas of the transverse web corresponds to the sum of all full areas of the transverse web of coal carriers whose height extends to the height of the cheeks. The number of the coal carriers is increased up to a maximum number where the distance between the coal carriers corresponds to the height of the coal carriers. This design ensures that the coal can in any event fall through the coal carriers and into the cell formed between the coal carriers. It is not possible for coal bridges to build up on the coal carriers.<br>
Due to the higher number of coal carriers present in the levelling bar according to the present invention, the transport capacity is increased so that with each to and fro motion of the levelling bar more coal is being transported. In this way, the creation of coal chute cooes under the charging holes is already largely prevented. If the levelling bar is moved in the oven chamber with greater frequency than is usual to date, a chute cone creation at the level of the levelling bar is prevented.<br>
The coal carriers arranged one behind the other can also have different heights. In this way it is additionally prevented that high coal heaps can be built up in front of the coal carriers. The coal spilling over a coal carrier of lesser height falls into the cell situated behind the respective coal carriers thereby preventing the formation of a high coal heap. This ensures that above the coal spilling<br><br>
over the coal carriers, an unhindered gas channel is available for the withdrawal of the charging gas within the levelling bar.<br>
Another option is to fasten the coal carriers at the cheeks of the levelling bar at an angle diverging firom the perpendicular. In this case, some coal carriers can be arranged with their upper edge at an incline towards the rear end of the levelling bar and other coal carriers with their upper edge at an incline towards the front end of the levelling bar. At an inclined arrangement towards the rear, the spilling over of the coal during the forward movement of the levelling bar is more easily facilitated. In the event where the coal carriers are arranged at an incline towards the front, the coal is pressed down slightly in this region and the levelling bar is subjected to a certain lifting force. Furthermore, the coal carriers arranged at an incline serve as deflector plates during the charging process. The coal is being guided by the coal carriers from the charging holes into the region between the charging holes. In this way, the formation of coal chute cones is being reduced.<br>
Another option is to arrange the coal carriers in a displaceable manner. For instance, some of the coal carriers can be displaceabty arranged in the upper or the lower region of the cheeks of the levelling bar. With each advance and withdrawal of fee levelling bar the canters change their position and level the coal in the respective inclined position. To prevent the coal carriers firom assuming a horizontal position, the angular setting is restricted by a limit stop.<br>
A further option is offered in that the coal carriers can be designed in a wedge shape. In this case the wedge can point upwards or downwards. Such a wedge Shape provides the opportunity for a light-weight construction of the levelling bar, as the wedge-shaped coal carriers allow for a reduction in the material thickness.<br><br>
The cheeks of the levelling bar can also be of a wedge-shaped design. In this way the statics of the levelling bar are improved. If the wedge points downwards in the direction of ifae coal 10 be levelled, the coal cannot collect between the wedge-shaped cheeks, as the intervening space widens downwards.<br>
In order to reduce the action offerees of the coal on the levelling bar during the charging process, the upper edge of the cheeks and/or the coal carriers can have a one-sided or two-sided bevel.<br>
The stroke of the levelling bar, the frequency of the levelling action, the number, the spacing and the height of the coal carriers must be adjusted in accordance with the rate of flow of the charging device.<br>
It is known that due to the levelling process the coal chute cone is to some extent left behind in the form of coal cone residue strips under die charging holes of the oven chamber between the chamber wall and the cheeks of the levelling bar. Apart from a hindrance being presented to the gas withdrawal, this can also lead to graphite deposits in the gas collecting space in this region. One possibility to prevent these residue strips from occurring is to have the levelling bar perform a wobbling or swinging motion. To achieve this, the bottom and guide rollers of the levelling bar can be provided with an incline which causes the wobbling or swinging motion.<br>
A further option to remove the coal residue strips is to design the bottom and guide rollers to be laterally displaceable by means of a sliding device. Due to its slideabiUty, the levelling bar can remove the coal strips on both sides of the gas collecting space during the levelling process. The removal of the coal strips can be improved by means of ribs or corrugated sheets arranged, on the outside of the cheeks.<br><br>
In accordance with a further development of the invention, the cheeks have openings. These openings enable a lateral fall of the coal into the cells forming between the coal carriers. The efficiency of the levelling process is thereby increased<br>
The openings can be of a size such that they are only interrupted by stmts at which the coal carriers are mounted. These struts can also be arranged at an incline.<br>
In this embodiment, the levelling bar becomes a lattice beam which is rectangular in cross-section and which blocks the gas collecting space during the levelling process only to a small extent. An obstruction of the gas collecting space by coal is thereby particularly effectively prevented and the charging gas resulting during the charging process can be withdrawn without hindrance in the longitudinal direction of the ovea Due to the lattice structure of the levelling bar furthermore a lateral flow through the levelling bar is possible, i.e. transverse to the longitudinal direction of the oven.<br>
The individual struts, which are arranged in the openings of the cheeks, can be arranged at an angle to the cheeks. In this way the coal is more easily scraped off at the sides of the coking oven chamber.<br>
The cheeks of the levelling bar can be widened outwardly at their front end. In this design, the coal is removed directly at the sides of the coking oven chamber at the levelling bar point.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, the levelling bar comprises at its front end one or a plurality of guide bows.  The guide bow or bows enable the levelling bar to be easily inserted into the levelling opening.<br><br>
In this way, the levelling bar, with its front part which is open with the exception of the guide how or bows, can be shoved (pushed) into the coal chute cone without the latter being increasingly heaped higher. The subsequent coal carriers then remove the top of the cone and level the coal charge.<br>
At the front end of the levelling bar or in the region of the cheek openings, movable coal scrapers can be arranged. Due to the action of forces of the coking coal on Ac coal scrapers during the rearward motion of tfie levelling bar, the movable coal scrapers are pressed against the walls of the coking oven chamber. Daring a renewed forward motion of the levelling bar, the coal strips at the oven walls are removed by the open coal scrapers. During the withdrawal of the levelling bar from the oven chamber, the arras of the coal scrapers which have been tilted outwards, are brought into a closed position by means of the levelling opening frame. When inserted into the next oven, the coal scrapers can act as guide bows to facilitate the insertion of the levelling bar.<br>
The levelling process in accordance with the invention can be improved by using gas which is under pressure. For this purpose fluid feeding ducts with nozzles are arranged at the cheeks of the levelling bar. The gas is used m the first place to blow away the coal residue strips after the levelling bar lias passed through the coal chute cone. The nozzles can be arranged spaced out at the same height above the levelling bar length behind each other OT above each other.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the nozzles are combined with the levelling bar having openings in its cheeks. In this case the coai which has been blown<br><br>
off, is blown through the openings into the intervening space between the cheeks and from there transported off by the coal carriers.<br>
As explained above, the levelling bar in accordance with the invention includes the provision of a gas channel in the gas collecting space, through which the charging gases can be sucked off. Within the region of the levelling opening of the respective oven chamber there is the risk that entrained air is sucked in through the gas channel. The invention therefore provides for the levelling bar to be sealed by a sealing and guiding box. This sealing and guiding box has bulkheads which extend from above into the levelling bar up to just above the coal carriers, which bulkheads are connected by a sealing sheet, and thus seal the gas channel. Below the levelling bar, the seal is completed by a sealing plate.<br>
In order to further improve the seal of the levelling bar, the levelling bar can be enclosed by a casing which is mounted to the levelling door opening in a sealing manner.<br>
In the design variation of the levelling bar where the coal carriers have different heights, the sealing and guiding box is equipped with hinge joints in such a way that tine respective bulkhead of the sealing and guiding box can be moved to and fro and thereby adjusts to the height differences of the coal carriers. In addition, the movable bulkhead can be displaced from the low pressure side towards the larter"s direction, whereby the low pressure effect will be limited. To increase the sealing effect, a plurality of sealing and guiding boxes can be arranged one behind the other. Each sealing and guiding box should be of larger size than the distance between the coal carriers, so that at least two coal carriers are covered by the sealing and guiding box.<br><br>
In order to increase even further the gas channel of the levelling bar in accordance with the invention, the coal carriers can be provided with openings. Any number of openings can be selected so that in the extreme case the coal carriers are defined as perforated sheets. It is advantageous to arrange the openings in the upper region of the coal carriers or design them to be larger in that region. The gas channel between the cheeks is thereby partially expanded within the region of the coal carriers. It is also possible to design the coal carriers to be of the same height as the cheeks and to create a gas channel through the openings in the coal carriers.<br>
The components mentioned above, as well as those in the claims and described in the embodiment examples, which are to be used in accordance with the invention, are not subject to any particular exceptional conditions with regard to their size, design, choice of material and technical concept, so that the selection criteria known in the respective application area can be used without any restrictions.<br>
Further details, features and advantages of the object of the invention are evident from the following description including the attached drawings, which show - by way of example - preferred embodiments of the levelling bar with gas channel. Shown are<br>

Figjl	a sixth embodiment of a levelling bar with openings in the coal<br>
carriers.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a levelling bar with cheeks 1 and between the cheeks 1 coal carriers 2 being arranged. The height 3 of the coal carriers 2 is distinctly lower than the height H of the cheeks 1. The coal carriers 2 are arranged behind each other at a distance 5. Their transverse web area 4 only covers a minor portion of the intervening space between the cheeks 1, so that an unobstructed gas channel 6 is formed.<br>
Figure 2 shows that between the cheeks 1 there are coal carriers 2 arranged behind each other, which carriers have different heights 3. This embodiment . offers the advantage that a coal heap cannot be piled up in front of the first few, lower coal carriers 2. The excess coal can spill into the next cell and is<br><br>
then transported on from there. Above the coal carrier 2 there is an unobstructed gas channel 6 at all times.<br>
Figure 3 shows examples of coal carriers 2, which are mounted at the cheeks 1 at an angle diverging from the perpendicular. The coking coal falling into the oven during the charging process is distributed by the coal carriers 2 thereby preventing the formation of chute cones.<br>
Figure 4 shows wedge-shaped coal carriers 2 and cheeks 1. This design reduces the obstruction by coking coal of the transport ceils formed between the coal carriers 2 , since the passage area for the falling coking coal widens downwardly.<br>
Figure 5 shows the mounting of the levelling bar with the cheeks 1 and the coed carriers 2. The bottom and guide roller 8 shows an incline 7. The edges of the bottom and guide roller 8 guiding the cheeks 1 of the levelling bar, due to the incline 7. at each turn of the bottom and guide roller 8 cause a change of the directional control of the levelling bar which is moving to and fro. Thereby, the levelling bar, during the levelling process* is caused to perform a lateral movement, which possibly removes the coal strips below the charging holes between the cheeks 1 and the oven wall.<br>
Figure 6 shows bottom and guide rollers 8, which can be laterally displaced by means of a sliding device 9. It is thereby also possible to urge the levelling bar into a lateral motion and to remove coal strips which are forming.<br>
Figure 7 shows a levelling bar, whose cheeks 1 have openings 11. Through the openings 11 the coal is able to fall into the transport cells of the levelling bar positioned between the coal carriers 2 and can be distributed during the levelling stroke. The openings 11 are limited by struts 12 at which the coal<br><br>
carriers 2 are mounted. The struts 12 can be arranged at an angle to the cheeks 1. In this way the coal is more easily guided into the transport cells between the coal carriers 2. At the cheeks 1, a guide bow 13 can be arranged, which facilitates the insertion of the levelling bar into the levelling opening.<br>
Figure 8 shows that at Ac front end of the levelling bar moveable coal scrapers 15 with anns 16 and 17 are arranged at the cheeks 1. The coal scrapers 15 pivot about a joint 18. Due to the action of forces of the coking coal during the rearward movement of the levelling bar, the arm 16 of the coal scraper 15 is pressed against the wall of the coking oven chamber via arm 17. When the levelling bar is withdrawn from the oven, the coal scraper 15 is brought through the frame of the levelling opening into the closed position shown in the lower part of Figure 8. During the insertion into the next oven chamber, the coal scrapers 15 perform the function of a guide bow.<br>
Figure 9 shows that ducts 20 with nozzles 21 are arranged at the cheeks 1. By way of nozzles 21 a gas under pressure, for instance nitrogen, can be blown in during the levelling process in such a way that the lateral coal cone strips are removed or are even prevented from forming. Nozzles 21 can be arranged in any desired configuration. By taking advantage of the recoil action of the nozzles, a swinging or wobbling motion can be produced.<br>
From Figure 10 it is evident that the gas channel 6 is scaled by a scaling and guiding box 23. The gas channel 6 is largely scaled by means of a suspended sealing sheet 25 of the sealing case 23 which sheet is moveably arranged with shafts 26 and bulkheads 27. Below the cheeks 1 and the coal carriers 2 a sealing plate 28 is provided. This sealing plate 28 can form part of a casing 24, which encases the levelling bar and is mounted in a sealing manner at the levelling door opening (not shown). This seal prevents an undesirable air infiltration into the oven during the charging gas withdrawal<br><br>
Figure 11 shows coal camera 2, which have openings 29 and 30. The openings 29 and 50 allow the charging gas to pass during the levelling process.<br><br>
