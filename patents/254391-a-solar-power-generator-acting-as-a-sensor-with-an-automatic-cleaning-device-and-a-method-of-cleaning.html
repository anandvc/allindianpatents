FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a solar module/s as a solar power generator as<br>
well as a sensor with an automatic module cleaning device for solar modules<br>
used in solar power systems.<br>
More particularly the proposed invention is related to development of a simple<br>
device and method for automatic cleaning of the solar modules by water<br>
sprinkling on the solar module for a predetermined time for optimized<br>
performance of the solar battery without detaching any module integrated and<br>
electrically interconnected into an array once mounted.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
At present large number of solar systems/installations are installed and being<br>
installed to meet the energy requirement in village and remote areas. The<br>
system/installation relies on seasonal cleaning of the modules during rains and is<br>
adapted at higher rating than usual requirement of load.<br><br>
Moreover the system is often encountered with deep discharge of the solar<br>
battery and eventuality of getting damaged in the extreme dust conditions as the<br>
modules with dust accumulated on it does not generate energy sufficient to meet<br>
up the load.<br>
Usually in practice, a manual cleaning schedule is recommended for such kind of<br>
installations but the said cleaning procedure is cumbersome or difficult as the<br>
solar modules are installed at the top of the solar installation to avoid shading<br>
effects and thus not easily reachable to make quick cleaning.<br>
There was a long felt need of solar industry to develop an undisturbed system of<br>
cleaning of solar module/s once they are installed.<br>
No prior references has been found in this technological field.<br>
The proposed invention is aimed to develop a real time and cost effective<br>
installation and method by cleaning the modules automatically on water spray on<br><br>
the solar modules for a predetermined short time without detaching any module<br>
of the battery panel or disturbing the continuous operation of the solar battery<br>
once the integrated and electrically interconnected modules are formed into an<br>
array and mounted.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
When photovoltaic solar cells are illuminated, a solar cell acts like a battery,<br>
pushing positive and negative charges to opposite sides. These charges are<br>
collected by conductive films and are available as electrical currents.<br>
A solar module is an assembly of one or more solar cells that are electrically<br>
interconnected. A module is generally sealed in a frame or encapsulating<br>
substance by known art, to protect the cells from damaging effects of dirt,<br>
moisture and other environmental hazards. Electrical connections are provided to<br>
pass electrical currents out of the frame or encapsulant. A single solar module<br>
produces enough energy to charge a 12 volt battery. Solar modules when<br>
assembled and electrically connected together in series and parallel to increase<br>
the total output voltage and current, such assembly is called an array.<br><br>
A solar module is used as solar power generator as well as a sensor on incidence<br>
of sunlight producing voltage to charge the battery or to run the load.<br>
But in spite of such protection of the mounted solar cells, the frame or<br>
encapsulant cannot prevent the hazardous atmospheric conditions and the cells<br>
get damaged in the extreme dust conditions.<br>
According to one objective of the proposed invention there is provided an<br>
installation for automatic cleaning of the solar module/s by water sprinkling<br>
through a DC pump for a preset time of a timer, by a sensor circuit on sensing a<br>
preset level of voltage of a module to run the said pump.<br>
According to another objective of the invention the cleaning is carried through<br>
automatically without disturbing the operation of the solar cells once mounted.<br>
According to yet another objective of the invention the modules are cleaned once<br>
in a morning for a preset time of 30 seconds to 5 minutes by a timer located on<br>
the sensor circuit and connected with the DC pump.<br><br>
A further objective of the invention is to operate a solar module as a solar power<br>
generator and charging the battery through a charge controller.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a solar module or an array of solar<br>
modules as a solar power generator as well as a sensor with an automatic<br>
cleaning device comprising of a solar module mounted on a support, a charge<br>
controller, sensor and a timer running a DC pump for predetermined time by a<br>
timer adapted in the sensor circuit on sensing a preset level of voltage of the<br>
module, wherein water is sprinkled on the module to clean the module from any<br>
dust through water holes in the module repeatedly on every morning on sensing<br>
incident sunlight to produce a voltage to charge the battery or to run a load<br>
continuously.<br>
According to the invention there is also provided a method of automatic cleaning<br>
from dust a solar module or an array of modules as a solar power generator and<br>
a sensor comprising the steps of running a DC pump by a timer adapted in a<br>
sensor circuit for a predetermined time to sprinkle water on the module/s to<br>
clean the module/s on sensing a preset level of voltage of the module/s and<br><br>
operating the solar module as a power generator and sensor optimisingly<br>
through sensing incident sunlight to produce a voltage to charge a battery or to<br>
run a load continuously.<br>
The proposed invention will be better understood from the following description<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawing in which<br>
Figure 1	represents an automatic cleaning installation of a solar module<br>
and<br>
Figure 2	represents circuit diagram illustrating schematically mode of<br>
operation of the automatic cleaning device.<br>
Figure 1 shows a solar module (1) mounted by a vertical column (2) and a<br>
horizontal support (3). On the column a charge controller, sensor and timer<br>
circuit (8) are fixed. The sensor circuit (8) is connected with a DC pump (5),<br><br>
which sprinkles water from a water tank (4) on the solar module (1) through<br>
water holes (10). The solar module used as a solar power generator as well as a<br>
sensor, on incidence of sunlight produces voltage to charge the battery (9) or<br>
run a load (7), viz a lamp.<br>
The sensor circuit on sensing a preset level of voltage of the module runs the<br>
small DC pump (5) for a time (-60 seconds) set by a timer.<br>
The pump (5) being connected with the load (7) through a connector (6) via the<br>
sensor circuit (8). The pump stops after predetermined time and the system<br>
continues to charge the 12 volt battery (9) via the charge controller IC 7815 on<br>
incidence of sunlight and run load (lamp) at night.<br>
The timer can be preset or can be varied from 30 seconds to 5 minutes through<br>
a preset timer located on the sensor circuit. It has been observed that 60<br>
seconds of running of the pump is enough to clean the solar module.<br><br>
The solar module also functions as solar power generator and charges the<br>
battery through a charge controller. The charged battery either runs a light or<br>
any other load, which can be run through a switch, or some other automatic<br>
switching device such as a dusk to dawn switch. The charged battery alternately<br>
can be used for running any other load such as fan etc. also.<br>
The mode of sequential operation of the automatic cleaning device is illustrated<br>
in Figure 2 as narrated below:<br>
1.	At dawn, relay Rl starts and remains on till dusk.<br>
2.	Relay Rl operates Timer which also remains powered till dusk.<br>
3.	Timer operates relay R2 for a preset period ranging 0.5-5.0 minutes.<br>
4.	R2 in turn operates the pump for the time it remains on.<br>
5.	Pump sprinkles water on the module for cleaning for a preset time.<br>
6.	The cycle repeats next day and so on. .<br>
The invention is illustrated with the help of the following example.<br>
An automatic module cleaning system is installed on a 70—watt solar lighting<br>
system. The system had a CFL based luminaire consisting of a solar charge<br>
controller, CFL inverter, and dusk to dawn switch. The solar module charges a<br><br>
sealed maintenance/low maintenance lead acid battery in the day time so that<br>
battery is available for running a lighting load in the night. A sensing circuit along<br>
with IC 555 based timer has been installed independently to sense the voltage of<br>
the module and run a DC pump on battery for a predetermined time.<br>
A 12-volt DC pump used for water sprinkling of the windscreen in the cars was<br>
installed for sprinkling of water on the module. The Dc pump was found to<br>
consume about 36 watt at 12 volt while sprinkling the water. As the pump runs<br>
only for short time (about 60 seconds), it consumes less than a watt-hour, which<br>
is much less than the power generated by the system (200 to 300 watt hours per<br>
day).<br>
The present invention is applicable to dozens of integrated solar modules and<br>
can be used optimisingly to an array of precalculated designed size of preformed<br>
multiple number of modules.<br>
The invention as herein narrated and illustrated should not be read and<br>
construed in a restrictive manner as various adaptations, alterations and<br>
modifications are possible within the scope and limit of the invention defined in<br>
the appended claims.<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
