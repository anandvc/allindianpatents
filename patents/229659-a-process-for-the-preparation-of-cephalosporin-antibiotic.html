Example 1<br>
Cefepime hydrochloride<br>
Step (i)<br>
Preparation of Cefepime sulfate<br>
To dichloromethane (300 mL), 4-chloro-2-methoxyimino-3-oxobutyric acid (50 g)<br>
was added under stirring to get a clear solution at 23-28 °C and cooled to -5 to 0 °C under nitrogen. To the cold solution, phosphorous pentachloride (64 g) was added under nitrogen and stirred for 30-40 min. The reaction mixture was cooled to -25 to -20 °C and cold water (500 mL) added to it. The organic layer was separated and charged into 7-amino-3-((N-methylpyrrolidino)methyl)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (100 g) in aqueous acetone (700 mL) at -5 to 0 °C over a period of 30-40 min while maintaining the pH in the range 6.0-7.0 using dil. ammonia solution (15%). Thiourea (28 g), and sodium acetate trihydrate (56 g) were added to the reaction mixture at -5 to 0 °C. The temperature of the reaction mixture was allowed to rise to 18-20 °C over a period of 20 min and stirred well. The aqueous layer was separated and dil. sulphuric acid added to adjust the pH to 1.1-1.2 at 15-20 °C, followed by excess acetone (4000 mL).  The resulting slurry was cooled<br><br>
to 0-2 °C, filtered, and washed with water and acetone. The wet material of cefepime sulfate was used as such for the preparation of cefepime hydrochloride.<br>
Step (ii)<br>
Preparation of cefepime hydrochloride<br>
To a stirred mixture of water (210 mL) and ethyl acetate (70 mL), cefepime sulfate (104 g, wet) was added at 18-20 °C. A solution of amberlite LA-2 resin (110 mL) in ethyl acetate (440 mL) was added over a period of 45-60 min while maintaining<br>
the pH 3.8-3.9. The aqueous layer was separated and the organic layer extracted with water (70 mL). The aqueous layers were combined and charcoalized. The filtrate was warmed to 35-40 °C and the pH adjusted to 0.7-0.8 with hydrochloric acid. Acetone (2800 mL) was added over 75 min at 35-38 °C under stirring. The product obtained was filtered, and washed with aqueous acetone and acetone. Drying under vacuum afforded pure cefepime hydrochloride.<br>

To the reaction mixture, cold water (200 mL) was added at -5 to 0 °C and the organic layer separated. The organic layer was added to 7-ACT (20 g) in aqueous acetone (200 mL) at -5 to 0 °C in 30-40 min while maintaining the pH 9.8-7.0 using dil. ammonia. The pH of the reaction mixture was maintained until completion of the reaction. The aqueous layer was separated at -5 to 0 °C. To the aqueous layer, thiourea  (6.5   g)   and  sodium  acetate  trihydrate   (13   g)  were  added  and  the<br><br>
temperature raised to 18-20 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h. Sodium acetate (5 g) was added and the stirring continued for another 1 h. The reaction mixture was charcoalized &amp; dil HC1 added to the filtrate to set the pH ~ 2.0 over a<br>
period of 60-70 min. The product, ceftriaxone acid, obtained was separated by filtration and washed with water. The ceftriaxone acid was dissolved in water using triethylamine. To the clear solution obtained, sodium 2-ethylhexanoate (25 g) was added followed by acetone (340 mL) and then stirred for 15 min at 18-20 °C. Insoluble impurity was removed and to the clear solution, acetone (560 mL) added. The precipitated product of ceftriaxone sodium was obtained by filtration followed by washing with acetone &amp; drying under vacuum.<br>
