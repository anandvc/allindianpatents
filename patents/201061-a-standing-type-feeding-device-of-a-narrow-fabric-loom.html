V<br>
The present invention relates to a standing type feeding device having multiple feeding wheels symmetrically provided at opposite sides of a frame fixed uprightly on a cabinet of a narrow fabric loom. 1. Description of Related Art<br>
It has become popular for people to carry items such as camera bags or shoulder bags by using a decorative strap that has a name of a manufacturer or owner woven into it. A shuttle loom used to weave the decorative straps normally comprise a warp yam feeding device provided therein. Because the patterns of the straps are designed to be more and more beautiful and complex, a conventional feeding device of the shuttle loom generally consists of multiple feeding wheels in order to satisfy the different requirements of various patterns of straps.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a conventional feeding device of a narrow fabric loom comprises two parallel frames (90, 92) respectively disposed in an upright position at two opposite sides thereof, a driving shaft (94) extending horizontally between the two frames (90, 92), a feeding assembly (940) including multiple feeding wheels mounted around the driving shaft (94), and a driving gear (96) including multiple gear wheels (962) and a driving belt (960) provided at an outer side of the frame (90). The driving shaft (94) is driven by a motor of the loom via the driving gear (96) to run so as to cause the feeding assembly (940) to run, therefore yams respectively threaded on the feeding wheels are fed by the feeding assembly (940) for interlacing a strap.<br>
However, the aforesaid conventional feeding device has some drawbacks in the<br><br>
operation which are as follows.<br>
First, to thread yams on the feeding wheels of the feeding assembly (940), an operator has to move from one side to another side of the loom, because the feeding assembly (94) is disposed in inner sides of the frames (90, 92).<br>
Second, if belts, feeding wheels, friction rings or other components of the feeding assembly (940) need to be replaced, the driving shaft (94) must be disassembled from the frames (90, 92), and the driving gear (96) must be disassembled in advance. Then, all these parts have to be reassembled and the driving gear (96) and the feeding assembly (940) must be adjusted again, so the replacement of the conventional feeding device is quite complicated.<br>
Third, because the driving gear (96) is exposed at the outer side of the frame (90), when the gear wheels (962) are miming at high speed, there is a risk in the operation of threading yams around the feeding wheels for the operator who must carefully avoid being caught up in the driving gear (96).<br>
Therefore, it is an objective of the invention to provide an improved feeding device of a narrow fabric loom to mitigate and/or obviate the aforementioned problems. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a standing type feeding device of a narrow fabric loom. The standing type feeding device has a post uprightly fixed on a cabinet thereof, a frame mounted at one side of the post and extending in a direction parallel to warps, a driving gear provided at one side of the frame, and a feeding assembly including multiple feeding wheels symmetrically disposed at two opposite sides of the frame, whereby the feeding assembly is driven by a motor via the driving gear to feed yams for weaving of a strap. The operation of threading yams on the<br><br>
feeding assembly and replacing of components of the feeding assembly are both easy, and the safe reliability of operation of the feeding device is improved.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a standing type feeding device of a narrow fabric loom comprising: a post uprightly fixed on a cabinet of the narrow fabric loom; a frame mounted at one side of the post and extending in a direction parallel to warps, a driving gear provided at one side of the frame; and a feeding assembly having a driving shaft extending horizontally through the fame, and multiple feeding wheels mounted around the driving shaft and symmetrically disposed at two opposite sides of the frame; wherein a bracing bar is extended horizontally through the frame, and two opposite ends of the bracing bar and the driving shaft are respectively connected by two bracing pieces, whereby the feeding assembly is actuated by the driving shaft when the driving shaft is driven by a motor of the loom through the driving gear to feed yams for interlacing of a strap.<br>
Other objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a standing type feeding device of a narrow fabric loom in accordance with the invention, showing the feeding device in a view of one angle;<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the standing type, feeding device of the narrow fabric loom in accordance with the invention, showing the feeding device in a view of another angle; and<br>
Fig. 3 is an exploded perspective view of a conventional feeding device of a narrow fabric loom.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, a standing type feeding device of a narrow fabric loom comprises a cabinet (10) having a post (12) uprightly fixed thereon, a frame (14) fixedly mounted at one side of the post (12) and extending along a direction parallel to warps, a driving gear (20) provided at one side of the frame (14), and a feeding assembly (30) driven by a motor of the loom via the driving gear (20).<br>
The driving gear (20) is disposed close to a side surface of the frame (14). The<br>
feeding assembly (30) includes a driving shaft (32) extending horizontally through<br>
the frame (14), and multiple feeding wheels mounted around the driving shaft (32)<br>
and symmetrically disposed at two opposite sides of the frame (14). A bracing bar	<br><br>
(36) is extended horizontally through the frame (14). Two opposite ends of the bracing bar (36) and the driving shaft (32) are respectively connected by two bracing pieces (360) so as to ensure the stability of the two opposite ends of the driving shaft (32).<br>
A secondary feeding assembly (40) is provided at a lower portion of the frame (14) and consists of a driving shaft (42) extending horizontally through a lower portion of the frame (14), and multiple feeding wheels moimted around the driving shaft (42) and symmetrically disposed at two opposite sides of the frame (14).<br>
The standing type feeding device of the invention has the following advantages:<br>
1.	Because the feeding wheels of the feeding assembly (30) are symmetrically disposed at opposite sides of the frame (14), an operator can easily thread yams on the feeding wheels without having to move frequently from one side to another side of the loom.<br>
2.	All components of the feeding assembly (30) can be easily replaced without disassembly of frame (14) and driving gear (20).<br>
3.	The driving gear (20) is positioned close to one side of the frame (14), whereby the operator can easily avoid getting caught up in the driving gear (20), so that the structure of the feeding device has an improved safe reliability in the operation.<br>
4.	Because the secondary feeding device (40) is provided at the lower end of the frame (14) and within easy reach of the operator, the production efficiency of the narrow fabric loom is improved.<br>
It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size,<br><br>
ana arrangement ot parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.<br><br><br>
