Field of invention: Present invention describes the diastereoselective synthesis of AOSA using the camphorsultam as a key and recyclable chiral auxiliary.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
(3R, 4R)-4-Acetoxy-3-[r(R)-tert-Butyldimethylsilyloxyethyl] azetidin-2-one (AOSA) is a highly versatile and important starting material used in the manufacture of many of the new-generation beta-lactams. This includes the marketed and clinical versions of the penems 1 and carbapenems 2 exemplified as ertapenem, meropenem, doripenem, faropenem etc.. AOSA 3, which is their common intermediate and is available on an industrial scale, dominates a considerable proportion of their cost of materials. Therefore, it is highly desirable to achieve an improved synthesis of 3 for development of 1 &amp; 2 penems.<br><br>
Priorart shows a plethora of novel synthetic approaches for the synthesis of (3R, 4R)-4-Acetoxy-3-[l' 5(R)-tert-Butyldimethylsilyloxyethyl] azetidin-2-one (AOSA).<br>
US 4861877 by Kanegafochi Chemical Industry Co. Ltd., discloses the process for the preparation of AOSA from methyl 3-hydroxy butyrate<br><br><br>
US 5204460 by Takasago international corporation, JAPAN describes the process from (2S,3R)-2-aminomethyl3-hydroxy-butyric acid<br><br>
In another method as reported in Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 7779-7782., hexahydrotriazine has been used for the stereocontrolled synthesis of AOSA 3. However, this too suffers from the formation of the undesired isomer during the crucial cyclisation.<br>
The advantage of the present process is cost-effective, scalable through commercially available raw material which is recovered and recycled.<br>
Summary of the invention: The objective of the present invention is to prepare AOSA through a novel synthetic and non-infringement route using commercially available raw material Camphorsultam. Camphorsultam is recovered in the process and recycled. The following scheme I depicts the novel synthetic route for the preparation of AOSA. Camphorsultam is converted to N-acryloyl derivative followed by Baylis-Hilmann reaction to form 1,3 dioxane-4-one derivative. During this step camphorsultam is recovered in quantitative yield and recycled for the first step. 1,3 dioxane-4-one derivative is further esterified with methanol followed by silylation step. Thus formed silylated ester compound is reacted with benzylamine to form the silylbenzylamine ester followed by next step debenzylation by hydrogenolysis to form the free amino compound. Free amino group in the compound formed in the previous step is silylated to form Silylaminoester derivative which is cyclised and followed by next step acetoxylation to form the final product AOSA.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the invention: The following scheme I represents a novel synthesis of AOSA 3 using commercially available camphorsutlam 1.<br><br>
(a)acryloyl chloride, THF, CuCl, DIPEA (b) CH3CHO, DABCO, MDC,(c) BF3Et2O, MeOH (d) TBDMSCI, imidazoie, DMF(e) PhCH2NH2, MeOH (f) 20% Pd (OH)2/C, H2(8 Kg/cm2), MeOH (g) (1) HMDS, TMCS, MDC (2) t- BuMgCl, THF(h) RuCl3.3H2O, 40%CH3COOOH,*NaOAc, CH3CN.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, stereoselective synthesis of the (R)-3-Hydroxy-2-methylene-butyric acid methylester 5 is carried out using commercially available Camphorsultam 1 as chiral auxiliary. Thus camphorsultam 1 was reacted with acryloylchloride at about 5 to -5°C in aprotic solvents like Dichloromethane, Diethylether, Tetrahydrofuran, or acetonitrile in presence of one or combinations of catalysts selected from the group consisting of cuprous chloride, Triethylamine, diisoproylethylamine to yield the N-Acryloylcamphorsultam 2. Subsequent Baylis-Hilman reaction of 2 with acetaldehyde and l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)<br><br>
in solvents selected from the group consisting of dichloromethane, THF for about 40 to 60hrs yielded the 1, 3-dioxane-4-one derivative 4.The crude mass obtained from this step was subjected to extraction with solvents like hexane, heptane to recover the camphorsultam 1 in 70% yield for recycle. In the next step the compound 4 was esterified in methanol using catalytic amount of borontrifluoride etherate yielded allylalcoholester 5. The product 5 was isolated and on silylation with t-Butyldimethylsilylchloride (TBDMS-C1) and imidazole in aprotic solvents selected from the group comprising N,N-dimethylformamide, THF, N,N-Dimethylacetamide, Dichloromethane resulted silylatedester 6 in quantitative yield. This was then subjected to diastereoselective Michael addition with benzyl amine in methanol as per literature described in J. Org. Chem. 1995, 60, 6515-6522 ; Tetrahedron Lett. 1988, 29, 949-952 to afford the product 7. Debenzylation of 7 with 20% Pd (OH)2 on carbon or 10% Pd/C in solvents like methanol, ethanol at ambient temperature yielded amino compound 8 which on further silylation with hexamethyldisilazine (HMDS) using catalytic amount of chlorotrimethylsilane followed by reaction with t-Butyl magnesiumchloride yielded compound 9. Compound 9 was converted to the AOSA 3 as per the experimental procedure described in US 5081239 wherein acetoxylation is carried out inpresence of anhydrous sodium acetate in acetonitrile and ruthenium trichloride trihydrate at about -5°C to 0°C and the final compound was characterized by H-NMR and specific rotation.<br>
While the present invention has been described in terms of its specific embodiments, certain modifications and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
