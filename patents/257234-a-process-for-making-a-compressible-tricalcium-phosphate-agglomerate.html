DIRECTLY COMPRESSIBLE TRICALCIUM PHOSPHATE Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to tricalcium phosphate for use in directly compressible tablet formulations.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Tricalcium phosphate is widely used as an excipient in pharmaceutical applications.<br>
Recent studies that establish the value of mineral dietary supplements that supply both calcium and phosphorus has given rise to an interest in making oral dosage forms, such as tablets or caplets and including chewable oral dosage forms such as chewable tablets, wherein calcium phosphate is the main ingredient.<br>
However, attempts to use tricalcium phosphate as the main ingredient in oral dosage forms have resulted in tablets that exhibit an undesirably low hardness. Moreover, chewable tablets made using calcium phosphates exhibit undesirable mouth feel described as "gritty" and or "chalky11.<br>
What is needed is a way to make oral dosage forms that contain a high relative amount of tricalcium phosphate and that exhibit good properties, including acceptable hardness. A further need is for such tablets, if designed to be chewable tablets, to have acceptable sensory qualities, including good mouthfeel, lack of grittiness, and lack of chalkiness.<br><br>

In a second aspect, the present invention is directed to a process for making a compressible tricalcium phosphate agglomerate, comprising spray drying an aqueous solution of tricalcium phosphate and a binder comprising a polyvinylpyrollidone, carageenan, or a guar gum.<br>
In a third aspect, the present invention is directed to a directly compressible calcium dietary supplement composition, comprising, based on 100 parts by weight ("pbw") of the composition:<br>
from about 20 to about 80 pbw of an agglomerate, comprising tricalcium phosphate particles, each having an outer surface, and a binder comprising a polyvinylpyrollidone, carageenan, or a guar gum, supported on at least a portion of the outer surface of at least a portion of the tricalcium phosphate particles,<br>
