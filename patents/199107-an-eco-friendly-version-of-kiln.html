The Number 3 in the figures is the main duct. The main duct loins through out the inner wall numbered as 6.<br>
â– ^I'he Number 4 in tlie figures arc damper holes and are positioned evenly along the main duct. The said darnper holes Numbered 4 connecters the sub duct numbered 2 with main duct numbeicd 3.<br>
The Number 5 is the outer wall of the kiln end number 6 is the inner wall the kiln. Number 7 is the inner arch in Ihe inner wail end number 8 is the ouler arch in the ouler wall. The inner arch and ouler arch are connected by sub duct numbered as 2.<br>
The Number 9 is Ihe screw Jockey lift type spindles attached lo the cast iron or steel value plates Numbered 10. 'Ihc valve plales cover the damper holes Numbered 4. The Number 11 is die. rotalitig wheel and it helps lo move up and down and the valve plate numbered 10.<br>
The Number 12 denotes position of the chambers in the kiln. The quantity of chambers can be increased or decreased according to tlie production need and it is to be [Secided by the commercial mariisger of tlie kiln. In Oie figures quantily of chambers shown are 22 and the numbers 14 to 35 in the figures relate to them.<br>
The number 13 shows flue filters for controlling air pollution and the fillers are arranged in an evenly distributed manner in the inside of main duct 3. The flue niter is by Ihe ussage of the green bricks arranged inside Ihe tunnel.<br><br>
I'hc iiiiniber 121J is roof on top of the kihi.<br>
Fig IV describes tlic burning function of llie kiln. The verbal explanation of funcEioning of" the kiln is enumerated below with the help of the fig. IV annexed herewith the application.<br>
In the fig.IV the number of 14 [o55 denotes chambers. The empty chambers are show by numbers as 14 to 18 in the said fig. IV. The chamber numbered as 19 is called as Unloading chamber. The burned bricks are shown in the chamber-ffumbered as 20 to 27. The burning process is shown in the chamber numbered as 28 and it is called Firing chamber. The raw bricks are sliown in liic chambers numbered 29 to 35. The raw bricks chambers are again bifurcated into two sections. The chambers numbering 29 to 32 is called preheating chambers. The reason for naming the said chambers as pre hearing chamber is because at the time of burning the flue from the firing chamber passes through the chambers numbering 29 to 32. The chamber numbered as 33 to 35 are shown in the figure to denote the process of loading of raw material.<br>
Now ihe firing functioning of the kiln is explained as follows. According to the said figure, the green bricks are in Ihe process of loading in (he chambers numbered as 33<br>
to 35.<br>
During the burning process, the atmospheric air that is present in the empty chambers enter into the Unloading chamber and thereafter runs to the cooling chambers. In this invention, the cooling chamberacomprises of 9'^ 14 segments depending upon the height of the chimney. By increasing number of cooling chambers, the burned bricks are cooled slowly and the slow cooling process avoid cracks to the burned bricks.<br>
The heat loss is also prevented with the increased number of cooling chambers. The atmosphere air that passes through Ihe Unloading chamber, contains water content. At the unloading chamber, moist air absorbed by the finished bricks and the dry air passes on to the cooling chamber.<br><br>
"/ Ai (lie cooling cliainbcr, Ihe -said diy air absorbs heal from the finished bricks, thereby<br>
making Ihe firiislicd bricks cooler and dry air becoming liollcr. As the dry hot air from<br>
the cooling chamber enter into the burning chamber, the fuel combustion occurs to the<br>
maximum extent and it reduces fuel consumption.<br>
In this invention with the help of valve, the maximum necessity of air for good combustion can be monitored and controlled to the extent required for maximum combustion of the fuel. In ihe kilns prevalent in the market the steps taken to prevent air pollution is not addressed.<br>
The flue that is coming out of the combuslion chamber enters the pre-healing chamber. The green brick in Ihe pre-heating chamber absorbs the heat from the flue. In the kiln prevalent in the market the length of the pre-healing chamber extends to 4 lo 5 meters. But in this invention Ihe lengih/area of Ihe pre-healing chambers is extended to a length of 5 to 25 meters. The high power draught fixed chimney gives an advantage for absorption of more heat bV the green bricks and the fillers evenly distributed control the escape of air pollutants to ihe atmosphere.<br>
'f he flue with minimum heal pass through the inner arch and outer arch with the help of valves. This invention relate to the existence of both inner arch outer arch. The inner and outer arch arc numbered as 7 and 8 respectively in the figure III. Incase of large width chambers there is an existence of an ouier and inner arch and the flue gas passes through the green bricks on all sides of the chamber on an uniform manner helping the green bricks lo be burned on an evenley burning pattern. In case of small widlh chambers there can be only inner arch and outer arch is absent because of space constrainment.<br>
The valve plates shown as number 10 in the figure(s) are moved up and down by rotating the rotating wheel as number 11 in figure II to increase and decrease the volume of air passing from the cooling chamber to the firing chamber. The color of the flue that comes out the chimney determines the nature of combustion that is occurring into the firing chamber. If the flue is colourless then it is understood that good combustion is happening. If the flue is blackish in color, it is understood that there is scarcity of air and in order to bring in proper combustion the valve plates are<br><br>
lined for increasing llic volume of incoming air from llie cooling chamber to llie firing chamber. If llie flue is white in colour, it is understood that there is excess air than what is required for combustion to take place and it can be rectified by pushing down the valve plates thereby decreasing the volume of incoming air from Ihe cooling chamber to the firing chamber. The valve plates is to be adjusted till the flue becomes colourless and it directly helps to check environmental pollution.<br>
By operation of valve, the top and bottom of the chamber get uniform heat, Valve operation is the uniqueness of this invention. The operation of value is given below:<br>
During the firing function the valve is adjusted to regulate the necessity air required for good combustion of the fuel and to control the production of carbon monoxide in excess quantity. By increasing the opening of valve, more atmospheric air is let in and the fuel can be fed in according to the proportion of the air. The increase of opening of the valve increases the production and decrease of opening of the valve decreases the production. Therefore the operation of valve is directly proportional to the production. When the valve is closed fully, the heat in the chambers is retained to all layers for a considerable period of time, so the kiln can be kept idle. So in this invention the kiln can be kept idle with less maintenance cost.<br>
Figure VI shows the valve mechanism, wherein the valve is fixed in a vertical manner without outer arch and sub duct in comparison to the kiln shown in Fig.lII wherein the valve is fixed in a horizontal manner with outer arch and sub duct. The luln with vertical type of valve without outer arch and sub duct is considered to be cost effective in respect of infrastructure of the kiln with comparison to a kiln with horizontal valve with outer arch and sub duct.<br>
In this invention, air filtration is done by green bricks placed inside main duct also to control air pollution. When the flue pass from the valve and run thorough the main duct Ihe carbon monoxide and other air pollutants are filtered by the green bricks placed inside the main duct.<br>
Figure VII explains the cyclone system of filtration in the Idin. The Methodology of cyclone system adopted in the kiln by the inventor helps to restrict pollutants entering<br><br>
Into the atmosphere. Number 13B in the figure is the outlet through which the settled pollutants are removed manually. In Figure VII Number 12 A is the area where the cyclone of the filtration is happening.<br>
An Eco-friendly version of kiln wherein used with inner and outer, arch with horizontal and vertical valves along with the arrangement of green bricks inside the main duct and to provide cyclonic filter of function as air filters.<br>
In this invention, the chimney is made of brick but in practice the chimneys of the kiln are made of thin steel sheets of short height for the purpose of easy mobility.<br>
In this invention the mobility of the chimney is absent and the advantages cf 50-150fr high brick made/steel chimney and   it creates high draught with low temperature of exhaust flue thereby controlling the air pollution,  increase production with low<br>
I<br>
consumption of fuel.<br>
In this invention the kiln can be operated at all weather conditions, due to the roof top on the kiln. In raining season the bricks with moisture can be dried easily when it is stored on the kiln with roof top. The heat evolved in the kiln dries up the stored raw brick.<br><br><br>
