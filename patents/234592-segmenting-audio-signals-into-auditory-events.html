Segmenting Audio Signals into Auditory Events<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention pertains to the field of psychoacoustic processing of<br>
audio signals, In particular, the invention relates to aspects of dividing or segmenting<br>
audio signals into "auditory events," each of which tends to be perceived as separate<br>
and distinct, and to aspects of generating reduced-information representations of<br>
audio signals based on auditoiy events and, optionally, also based on the<br>
characteristics or features of audio signals within such auditory events. Auditory<br>
events may be useful as defining the MPEG-7 "Audio Segments" as proposed by the<br>
"1SO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11."<br>
BA CKGROUND AR T<br>
The division of sounds into units or segments perceived as separate and<br>
distinct is sometimes referred to as "auditory event analysis" or "auditory scene<br>
analysis" ("ASA"). An extensive discussion of auditoiy scene analysis is set forth by<br>
Albert S. Bregman in his book Auditoiy Scene Analysis - The Perceptual<br>
Organization of Sound, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1991, Fourth<br>
printing, 2001, Second MlT Press paperback edition.) In addition, United States<br>
Patent 6,002,776 to Bhadkamkar, et al, December 14, 1999 cites publications dating<br>
back to 1976 as "prior ait work related to sound separation by auditoiy scene<br>
analysis." However, the Bhadkamkar, et al patent discourages the practical use of<br>
auditory scene analysis, concluding that "[t]echniques involving auditoiy scene<br>
analysis, although interesting from a scientific point of view as models of human<br>
auditoiy processing, are currently far too computationally demanding and specialized<br>
to be considered practical techniques for sound separation until fundamental progress<br>
is made."<br>
There are many different methods for extracting characteristics or features from<br>
audio. Provided the features or characteristics are suitably defined, their extraction can be<br>
performed using automated processes. For example "ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11"<br>
(MPEG) is currently standardizing a variety of audio descriptors as part of the MPEG-7<br>
standard. A common shortcoming of such methods is that they ignore auditory scene<br>
analysis. Such methods seek to measure, periodically, certain "classical" signal processing<br>
parameters such as pitch, amplitude, power, harmonic structure and spectral flatness. Such<br>
parameters, while providing useful information, do not analyze and characterize audio<br>
signals into elements perceived as separate and distinct according to human cognition.<br>
However, MPEG-7 descriptors may be useful in characterizing an Auditory Event<br>
identified in accordance with aspects of the present invention.<br>
Reynolds (WO 9119989) is a 'fingerprint" detection scheme in which a specific<br>
event including its boundaries is detected by comparing a set of data of a known event (a<br>
fingerprint) with corresponding sets of data derived from a signal being processed. Event<br>
boundaries are not identified in response to a change in signal characteristics exceeding a<br>
threshold. Reynolds stores one or more predetermined small segments of audio<br>
("Fingerprints") and then determines when identical segments, or segments closely<br>
resembling them, but no others, appear in a passage of audio (an audio stream). Thus, prior<br>
knowledge of the characteristics of the events whose boundaries are to be identified is<br>
required. Reynolds identifies some event boundaries, if any, as a result of comparing<br>
signal characteristics with those of a known event. However, such boundaries do not<br>
define the boundaries of any other event or events. Reynolds does not obtain a continuous<br>
succession of auditory events. Rather, it obtains isolated events.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with aspects of the present invention, a computationally<br>
efficient process for dividing audio into temporal segments or "auditory events" that tend to<br>
be perceived as separate and distinct is provided. The locations of the boundaries of these<br>
auditory events (where they begin and end with respect to time) provide valuable<br>
information that can be used to describe an audio signal. The locations of auditory event<br>
boundaries can be assembled to generate a reduced-in formation representation, "signature,<br>
or "fingerprint" of an audio signal that can be stored for use, for example, in comparative<br>
analysis with other similarly generated signatures (as, for example, in a database of known<br>
works).<br>
Bregman notes that "[w]e hear discrete units when the sound changes abruptly in<br>
timbre, pitch, loudness, or (to a lesser extent) location in space." {Auditory Scene Analysis<br>
~ The Perceptual Organization of Sound, supra at page 469). Bregman also discusses the<br>
perception of multiple simultaneous sound streams when, for example, they are separated<br>
in frequency.<br>
In order to detect changes in timbre and pitch and certain changes in<br>
amplitude, the audio event detection process according to an aspect of the present<br>
invention detects changes in spectral composition with respect to time. When<br>
applied to a multichannel sound arrangement in which the channels represent<br>
directions in space, the process according to an aspect of the present invention also<br>
detects auditoiy events that result from changes in spatial location with respect to<br>
time. Optionally, according to a further aspect of the present invention, the process<br>
may also detect changes in amplitude with respect to time that would not be detected<br>
by detecting changes in spectral composition with respect to time.<br>
In its least computationally demanding implementation, the process divides<br>
audio into time segments by analyzing the entire frequency band (full bandwidth<br>
audio) or substantially the entire frequency band (in practical implementations, band<br>
limiting filtering at the ends of the spectrum is often employed) and giving the<br>
greatest weight to the loudest audio signal components. This approach takes<br>
advantage of a psychoacoustic phenomenon in which at smaller time scales (20<br>
milliseconds (ms) and less) the ear may tend to focus on a single auditoiy event at a<br>
given time. This implies that while multiple events may be occurring at the same<br>
time, one component tends to be perceptually most prominent and may be processed<br>
individually as though it were the only event taking place. Taking advantage of this<br>
effect also allows the auditoiy event detection to scale with the complexity of the<br>
audio being processed. For example, if the input audio signal being processed is a<br>
solo instrument, the audio events that are identified will likely be the individual notes<br>
being played. Similarly for an input voice signal, the individual components of<br>
speech, the vowels and consonants for example, will likely be identified as individual<br>
audio elements. As the complexity of the audio increases, such as music with a<br>
drumbeat or multiple instruments and voice, the auditoiy event detection identifies<br>
the "most prominent" (i.e., the loudest) audio element at any given moment.<br>
Alternatively, the most prominent audio element may be determined by taking<br>
hearing threshold and frequency response into consideration.<br>
While the locations of the auditoiy event boundaries computed from full-<br>
bandwidth audio provide useful information related to the content of an audio signal,<br>
it might be desired to provide additional information further describing the content of<br>
an auditory event for use in audio signal analysis. For example, an audio signal<br>
could be analyzed across two or more frequency subbands and the location of<br>
frequency subband auditory events determined and used to convey more detailed<br>
information about the nature of the content of an auditory event. Such detailed<br>
information could provide additional information unavailable from wideband<br>
analysis.<br>
Thus, optionally, according to further aspects of the present invention, at the<br>
expense of greater computational complexity, the process may also take into<br>
consideration changes in spectra! composition with respect to time in discrete<br>
frequency subbands (fixed or dynamically determined or both fixed and dynamically<br>
determined subbands) rather than the full bandwidth. This alternative approach<br>
would take into account more than one audio stream in different frequency subbands<br>
rather than assuming that only a single stream is perceptible at a particular time.<br>
Even a simple and computationally efficient process according to aspects of<br>
the present invention has been found usefully to identify auditory events.<br>
An auditory event detecting process according to the present invention may be<br>
implemented by dividing a time domain audio waveform into time intervals or blocks<br>
and dien convening the data in each block to the frequency domain, using either a<br>
filter bank or a time-frequency transformation, such as the FFT. The amplitude of<br>
the spectral content of each block may be normalized in order to eliminate or reduce<br>
the effect of amplitude changes. Each resulting frequency domain representation<br>
provides an indication of the spectral content (amplitude as a function of frequency)<br>
of the audio in the particular block. The spectral content of successive blocks is<br>
compared and changes greater than a threshold may be taken to indicate the temporal<br>
start or temporal end of an auditory event. FIG. 1 shows an idealized waveform of a<br>
single channel of orchestral music illustrating auditory events. The spectral changes<br>
that occur as a new note is played trigger the new auditoiy events 2 and 3 at samples<br>
2048 and 2560, respectively.<br>
As mentioned above, in order to minimize the computational complexity, only<br>
a single band of frequencies of the time domain audio waveform may be processed,<br>
preferably either the entire frequency band of the spectrum (which may be about 50<br>
Hz to 15 kHz in the case of an average quality music system) or substantially the<br>
entire frequency band (for example, a band defining filter may exclude the high and<br>
low frequency extremes).<br>
Preferably, the frequency domain data is normalized, as is described below.<br>
The degree to which the frequency domain data needs to be normalized gives an<br>
indication of amplitude. Hence, if a change in this degree exceeds a predetermined<br>
threshold, that too may be taken to indicate an event boundary. Event start and end<br>
points resulting from spectral changes and from amplitude changes may be ORed<br>
together so that event boundaries resulting from either type of change are identified.<br>
In the case of multiple audio channels, each representing a direction in space,<br>
each channel may be heated independently and the resulting event boundaries for all<br>
channels may then be ORed together. Thus, for example, an auditory event that<br>
abruptly switches directions will likely result in an "end of event" boundary in one<br>
channel and a "start of event" boundary in another channel. When ORed together,<br>
two events will be identified. Thus, the auditory event detection process of the<br>
present invention is capable of detecting auditory events based on spectral (timbre<br>
and pitch), amplitude and directional changes.<br>
As mentioned above, as a further option, but at the expense of greater<br>
computational complexity, instead of processing the spectral content of the time<br>
domain waveform in a single band of frequencies, the spectrum of the time domain<br>
waveform prior to frequency domain conversion may be divided into two or more<br>
frequency bands. Each of the frequency bands may then be convened to the<br>
frequency domain and processed as though it were an independent channel in the<br>
manner described above. The resulting event boundaries may then be ORed together<br>
to define the event boundaries for that channel. The multiple frequency bands may<br>
be fixed, adaptive, or a combination of fixed and adaptive. Tracking filter techniques<br>
employed in audio noise reduction and other arts, for example, may be employed to<br>
define adaptive frequency bands (e.g., dominant simultaneous sine waves at 800 Hz<br>
and 2 kHz could result in two adaptively-determined bands centered on those two<br>
frequencies). Although filtering the data before conversion to the frequency domain<br>
is workable, more optimally the full bandwidth audio is converted to the frequency<br>
domain and then only those frequency subband components of interest are processed.<br>
In the case of converting the full bandwidth audio using the FFT, only sub-bins<br>
corresponding to frequency subbands of interest would be processed together.<br>
Alternatively, in the case of multiple subbands or multiple channels, instead of<br>
ORing together auditory event boundaries, which results in some loss of information,<br>
the event boundary information may be preserved.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the frequency domain magnitude of a digital audio signal<br>
contains useful frequency information out to a frequency of Fs/2 where Fs is the<br>
sampling frequency of the digital audio signal. By dividing the frequency spectrum<br>
of the audio signal into two or more subbands (not necessarily of the same bandwidth<br>
and not necessarily up to a frequency of Fs/2 Hz), the frequency subbands may be<br>
analyzed over time in a manner similar to a full bandwidth auditory event detection<br>
method.<br>
The subband auditoiy event information provides additional information about<br>
an audio signal that more accurately describes the signal and differentiates it from<br>
other audio signals. This enhanced differentiating capability may be useful if the<br>
audio signature information is to be used to identify matching audio signals from a<br>
large number of audio signatures. For example, as shown in FIG. 2, a frequency<br>
subband auditoiy event analysis (with a auditory event boundary resolution of 512<br>
samples) has found multiple subband auditory events stalling, variously, at samples<br>
1024 and 1536 and ending, variously, at samples 2560, 3072 and 3584 . It is unlikely<br>
that this level of signal detail would be available from a single, wideband auditoiy<br>
scene analysis.<br>
Tire subband auditoiy event information may be used to derive an auditory<br>
event signature for each subband. While this would increase the size of the audio<br>
signal's signature and possibly increase the computation time required to compare<br>
multiple signatures it could also greatly reduce the probability of falsely classifying<br>
two signatures as being the same. A tradeoff between signature size, computational<br>
complexity and signal accuracy could be done depending upon the application.<br>
Alternatively, rather than providing a signature for each subband, the auditory events<br>
may be ORed together to provide a single set of "combined" auditory event<br>
boundaries (at samples 1024, 1536, 2560, 3072 and 3584. Although this would result<br>
in some loss of information, it provides a single set of event boundaries, representing<br>
combined auditory' events, that provides more information than the information of a<br>
single subband or a wideband analysis.<br>
While the frequency subband auditory event information on its own provides<br>
useful signal information, the relationship between the locations of subband auditory<br>
events may be analyzed and used to provide more insight into the nature of an audio<br>
signal. For example, the location and strength of the subband auditory events may be<br>
used as an indication of timbre (frequency content) of the audio signal. Auditoiy<br>
events that appear in subbands that are harmonically related to one another would<br>
also provide useful insight regarding the harmonic nature of the audio. The presence<br>
of auditoiy events in a single subband may also provide information as to the tone-<br>
like nature of an audio signal. Analyzing the relationship of frequency subband<br>
auditory events across multiple channels can also provide spatial content information.<br>
In the case of analyzing multiple audio channels, each channel is analyzed<br>
independently and the auditoiy event boundary information of each may either be<br>
retained separately or be combined to provide combined auditoiy event information.<br>
This is somewhat analogous to the case of multiple subbands. Combined auditory<br>
events may be better understood by reference to FIG. 3 that shows the auditoiy scene<br>
analysis results for a two channel audio signal. FIG. 3 shows time concurrent<br>
segments of audio data in two channels. ASA processing of the audio in a first<br>
channel, the top waveform of FIG. 3, identifies auditoiy event boundaries at samples<br>
that are multiples of the 512 sample spectral-profile block size, 1024 and 1536<br>
samples in this example. The lower waveform of FIG. 3 is a second channel and<br>
ASA processing results in event boundaries at samples that are also multiples of the<br>
spectral-profile block size, at samples 1024, 2048 and 3072 in this example. A<br>
combined auditoiy event analysis for both channels results in combined auditoiy<br>
event segments with boundaries at samples 1024, 1536, 2048 and 3072 (the auditory<br>
event boundaiies of the channels are "ORed" together). It will be appreciated that in<br>
practice the accuracy of auditory event boundaries depends on the size of the<br>
spectral-profile block size (N is 512 samples in this example) because event<br>
boundaries can occur only at block boundaries. Nevertheless, a block size of 512<br>
samples has been found to determine auditory event boundaiies with sufficient<br>
accuracy as to provide satisfactoiy results.<br>
FIG. 3 A shows three auditoiy events. These events include the (1) quiet<br>
portion of audio before the transient, (2) the transient event, and (3) the echo / sustain<br>
portion of the audio transient. A speech signal is represented in FIG. 3B having a<br>
predominantly high-frequency sibilance event, and events as the sibilance evolves or<br>
"morphs" into the vowel, the first half of the vowel, and the second half of the vowel.<br>
FIG. 3 also shows the combined event boundaries when the auditoiy event<br>
data is shared across the time concurrent data blocks of two channels. Such event<br>
segmentation provides five combined auditory event regions (the event boundaiies<br>
are ORed together).<br>
FIG. 4 shows an example of a four channel input signal. Channels 1 and 4<br>
each contain tluee auditoiy events and channels 2 and 3 each contain two auditoiy<br>
events. The combined auditoiy event boundaiies for the concurrent data blocks<br>
across all four channels are located at sample numbers 512, 1024, 1536, 2560 and<br>
3072 as indicated at the bottom of the FIG. 4.<br>
In principle, the processed audio may be digital or analog and need not be<br>
divided into blocks. However, in practical applications, the input signals likely are<br>
one or more channels of digital audio represented b mples in which consecutive<br>
samples in each channel are divided into blocks of, example 4096 samples (as in<br>
the examples of FIGS. 1, 3 and 4, above). In practical embodiments set forth herein,<br>
auditor}' events are determined by examining blocks of audio sample data preferably<br>
representing approximately 20 ms of audio or less, which is believed to be the<br>
shortest auditoiy event recognizable by the human ear. Thus, in practice, auditoiy<br>
events are likely to be determined by examining blocks of, for example, 512 samples,<br>
which corresponds to about 11.6 ms of input audio at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz,<br>
within larger blocks of audio sample data. However, throughout this document<br>
reference is made to "blocks" rather than "subblocks" when referrina to the<br>
examination of segments of audio data for the pmpose of detecting auditory event<br>
boundaries. Because the audio sample data is examined in blocks, in practice, the<br>
auditory event temporal start and stop point boundaries necessarily will each coincide<br>
with block boundaries. There is a trade off between real-time processing<br>
requirements (as larger blocks require less processing overhead) and resolution of<br>
event location (smaller blocks provide more detailed information on the location of<br>
auditory events).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for dividing each of<br>
multiple channels of digital audio signals into auditory events, each of which tends to<br>
be perceived as separate and distinct, comprising : detecting changes in signal<br>
characteristics with respect to time in the audio signal in each of the channels, and in<br>
each channel, identifying a continuous succession of auditory event boundaries in the<br>
audio signal, in which every change in signal characteristics with respect to time<br>
exceeding a threshold defines a boundary, wherein each auditory event is an audio<br>
segment between adjacent boundaries and there is only one auditory event between<br>
such adjacent boundaries, each boundary representing the end of the preceding event<br>
and the beginning of the next event such that a continuous succession of auditory<br>
events is obtained, wherein neither auditory event boundaries, auditory events, nor<br>
any characteristics of an auditory event are known in advance of identifying the<br>
continuous succession of auditory event boundaries and obtaining the continuous<br>
succession of auditory events.<br>
Other aspects of the invention will be appreciated and understood as the<br>
detailed description of the invention is read and understood.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of one aspect of the present invention,<br>
auditory scene analysis is composed of three general processing steps as shown in a<br>
portion of FIG. 5. The first step 5-1 ("Perform Spectral Analysis") takes a time-<br>
domain audio signal, divides it into blocks and calculates a spectral profile or spectral<br>
content for each of the blocks. Spectral analysis transforms the audio signal into the<br>
short-term frequency domain. This can be performed using any filterbank, either<br>
based on transforms or banks of bandpass filters, and in either linear or warped<br>
frequency space (such as the Bark scale or critical band, which better approximate<br>
the characteristics of the human ear). With any filterbank there exists a tradeoff<br>
between time and frequency. Greater time resolution, and hence shorter time<br>
intervals, leads to lower frequency resolution. Greater frequency resolution, and<br>
hence narrower subbands, leads to longer time intervals.<br>
The first step, illustrated conceptually in FIG. 6 calculates the spectral content<br>
of successive time segments of the audio signal. In a practical embodiment, the ASA<br>
block size is 512 samples of the input audio signal. In the second step 5-2, the<br>
differences in spectral content from block to block are determined ("Perform spectral<br>
profile difference measurements"). Thus, the second step calculates the difference in<br>
spectral content between successive time segments of the audio signal. As discussed<br>
above, a powerful indicator of the beginning or end of a perceived auditory event is<br>
believed to be a change in spectral content. In the third step 5-3 ("Identify location<br>
of auditoiy event boundaries"), when the spectral difference between one spectral-<br>
profile block and the next is greater than a threshold, the block boundary is taken to<br>
be an auditoiy event boundary. The audio segment between consecutive boundaries<br>
constitutes an auditoiy event. Thus, the third step sets an auditoiy event boundary'<br>
between successive time segments when the difference in the spectral profile content<br>
between such successive time segments exceeds a tlireshold, thus defining auditoiy<br>
events. In this embodiment, auditoiy event boundaries define auditoiy events having<br>
a length that is an integral multiple of spectral profile blocks with a minimum length<br>
of one spectral profile block (512 samples in this example). In principle, event<br>
boundaries need not be so limited. As an alternative to the practical embodiments<br>
discussed herein, the input block size may vary, for example, so as to be essentially<br>
the size of an auditory event.<br>
The locations of event boundaries may be stored as a reduced-information<br>
characterization or "signature" and formatted as desired, as shown in step 5-4. An<br>
optional process step 5-5 ("Identify dominant subband") uses the spectral analysis of<br>
step 5-1 to identify a dominant frequency subband that may also be stored as part of<br>
the signature. The dominant subband information may be combined with the<br>
auditory event boundaiy information in order to define a feature of each auditoiy<br>
event.<br>
Either overlapping or non-overlapping segments of the audio may be<br>
windowed and used to compute spectral profiles of the input audio. Overlap results<br>
in finer resolution as to the location of auditoiy events and, also, makes it less likely<br>
to miss an event, such as a transient. However, overlap 3lso increases computational<br>
complexity. Thus, overlap may be omitted. FIG. 6 shows a conceptual<br>
representation of non-overlapping 512 sample blocks being windowed and<br>
transformed into the frequency domain by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).<br>
Each block may be windowed and transformed into the frequency domain, such as by<br>
using the DFT, preferably implemented as a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for speed.<br>
The following variables may be used to compute the spectral profile of the<br>
input block:<br>
N = number of samples in the input signal<br>
M = number of windowed samples in a block used to compute<br>
spectral profile<br>
P = number of samples of spectral computation overlap<br>
Q = number of spectral windows/regions computed<br>
In general, any integer numbers may be used for the variables above.<br>
However, the implementation will be more efficient if M is set equal to a power of 2<br>
so that standard FFTs may be used for the spectral profile calculations. In addition, if<br>
N, M, and P are chosen such that Q is an integer number, this will avoid under-<br>
running or over-running audio at the end of the N samples. In a practical<br>
embodiment of the auditory scene analysis process, the parameters listed may be set<br>
to:<br>
M = 5.12 samples (or 11.6 ms at 44.1 kHz)<br>
P =0 samples (no overlap)<br>
The above-listed values were determined experimentally and were found<br>
generally to identify with sufficient accuracy the location and duration of auditory<br>
events. However, setting the value of P to 256 samples (50% overlap) rather than<br>
zero samples (no overlap) has been found to be useful in identifying some hard-to-<br>
find events. While many different types of windows may be used to minimize<br>
spectral artifacts due to windowing, the window used in the spectral profile<br>
calculations is an M-point Harming, Kaiser-Bessel or other suitable, preferably non-<br>
rectangular, window. The above-indicated values and a Harming window type were<br>
selected after extensive experimental analysis as they have shown to provide<br>
excellent results across a wide range of audio material. Non-rectangular windowing<br>
is preferred for the processing of audio signals with predominantly low frequency<br>
content. Rectangular windowing produces spectral artifacts that may cause incorrect<br>
detection of events. Unlike certain encoder/decoder (codec) applications where an<br>
overall overlap/add process must provide a constant level, such a constraint does not<br>
apply here and the window may be chosen for characteristics such as its<br>
time/frequency resolution and stop-band rejection.<br>
In step 5-1 (FIG. 5), the spectrum of each M-sample block may be computed<br>
by windowing the data by an M-point Hanning, Kaiser-Bessel or other suitable<br>
window, converting to the frequency domain using an M-point Fast Fourier<br>
Transform, and calculating the magnitude of the complex FFT coefficients. The<br>
resultant data is normalized so that the largest magnitude is set to unity, and the<br>
normalized array of M numbers is converted to the log domain. Tire array need not<br>
be converted to the log domain, but the conversion simplifies the calculation of the<br>
difference measure in step 5-2. Furthermore, the log domain more closely matches<br>
tire nature of the human auditoiy system. The resulting log domain values have a<br>
range of minus infinity to zero. In a practical embodiment, a lower limit can be<br>
imposed on the range of values; the limit may be fixed, for example -60 dB, or be<br>
frequency-dependent to reflect the lower audibility of quiet sounds at low and very<br>
high frequencies. (Note that it would be possible to reduce the size of the array to<br>
M/2 in that the FFT represents negative as well as positive frequencies).<br>
Step 5-2 calculates a measure of the difference between the spectra of<br>
adjacent blocks. For each block, each of the M (log) spectral coefficients from step<br>
5-1 is subtracted from the corresponding coefficient for the preceding block, and the<br>
magnitude of the difference calculated (the sign is ignored). These M differences are<br>
then summed to one number. Hence, for a contiguous time segment of audio,<br>
containing Q blocks, the result is an array of Q positive numbers, one for each block.<br>
The greater the number, the more a block differs in spectrum from the preceding<br>
block. This difference measure may also be expressed as an average difference per<br>
spectral coefficient by dividing the difference measure by the number of spectral<br>
coefficients used in the sum (in this case M coefficients).<br>
Step 5-3 identifies the locations of auditory event boundaries by applying a<br>
threshold to the array of difference measures from step 5-2 with a threshold value.<br>
When a difference measure exceeds a threshold, the change in spectrum is deemed<br>
sufficient to signal a new event and the block number of the change is recorded as an<br>
event boundary. For the values of M and P given above and for log domain values<br>
(in step 5-1) expressed in units of dB, the threshold may be set equal to 2500 if the<br>
whole magnitude FFT (including the mirrored part) is compared or 1250 if half the<br>
FFT is compared (as noted above, the FFT represents negative as well as positive<br>
frequencies — for the magnitude of the FFT, one is the minor image of the other).<br>
This value was chosen experimentally and it provides good auditory event boundary<br>
detection. This parameter value may be changed to reduce (increase the threshold) or<br>
increase (decrease the threshold) the detection of events.<br>
For an audio signal consisting of Q blocks (of size M samples), the output of<br>
step 5-3 of FIG. 5 may be stored and formatted in step 5-4 as an array B(q) of<br>
information representing the location of auditoiy event boundaries where q = 0, 1, . .<br>
i<br>
Q-l. For a block size of M = 512 samples, overlap of P = 0 samples and a signal-<br>
sampling rate of 44.1kHz, the auditory scene analysis function 2 outputs<br>
approximately 86 values a second. The array B(g) may stored as a signature, such<br>
that, in its basic form, without the optional dominant subband frequency information<br>
of step 5-5, the audio signal's signature is an array B(q) representing a string of<br>
auditory event boundaries.<br>
Identify dominant subband (optional)<br>
For each block, an optional additional step in the processing of FIG. 5 is to<br>
extract information from the audio signal denoting the dominant frequency<br>
"subband" of the block (conversion of the data in each block to the frequency domain<br>
results in information divided into frequency subbands). This block-based<br>
information may be converted to auditory-event based information, so that the<br>
dominant frequency subband is identified for every auditory event. Such information<br>
for every auditoiy event provides information regarding the auditory event itself and<br>
may be useful in providing a more detailed and unique reduced-information<br>
representation of the audio signal. The employment of dominant subband<br>
information is more appropriate in the case of determining auditoiy events of full<br>
bandwidth audio rather than cases in which the audio is broken into subbands and<br>
auditoiy events are determined for each subband.<br>
The dominant (largest amplitude) subband may be chosen from a plurality of<br>
subbands, three or four, for example, that are within the range or band of frequencies<br>
where the human ear is most sensitive. Alternatively, other criteria may be used to<br>
select the subbands. The spectrum may be divided, for example, into three subbands.<br>
Useful frequency ranges for the subbands are (these particular frequencies are not<br>
critical):<br>
Subband 1             300 Hz to 550 Hz<br>
Subband 2             550 Hz to 2000 Hz<br>
Subband 3             2000 Hz to 10,000 Hz<br>
To determine the dominant subband, the square of the magnitude spectrum (or<br>
the power magnitude spectrum) is summed for each subband. This resulting sum for<br>
each subband is calculated and the largest is chosen. The subbands may also be<br>
weighted prior to selecting the largest. The weighting may take the form of dividing<br>
tire sum for each subband by the number of spectral values in the subband, or<br>
alternatively may take the form of an addition or multiplication to emphasize the<br>
importance of a band over another. This can be useful where some subbands have<br>
more energy on average than other subbands but are less perceptually important.<br>
Considering an audio signal consisting of Q blocks, the output of the dominant<br>
subband processing is an array DS(g) of information representing the dominant<br>
subband in each block (9 = 0, 1, ..., Q-l). Preferably, the array DS(g) is formatted<br>
and stored in the signature along with the array B(q). Thus, with the optional<br>
dominant subband information, the audio signal's signature is two arrays B(q) and<br>
DS(q), representing, respectively, a suing of auditory event boundaries and a<br>
dominant frequency subband within each block, from which the dominant frequency<br>
subband for each auditory event may be determined if desired. Thus, in an idealized<br>
example, the two arrays could have the following values (for a case in which there<br>
are tluee possible dominant subbands).<br>
10100010010000010 (Event Boundaries)<br>
11222211133333311 (Dominant Subbands)<br>
In most cases, the dominant subband remains the same within each auditory<br>
event, as shown in this example, or has an average value if it is not uniform for all<br>
blocks within the event. Thus, a dominant subband may be determined for each<br>
auditory event and the array DS(q) may be modified to provide that the same<br>
dominant subband is assigned to each block within an event.<br>
The process of FIG. 5 may be represented more generally by the equivalent<br>
arrangements of FIGS. 7, 8 and 9. In FIG. 7, an audio signal is applied in parallel to<br>
an "Identify Auditory Events" function or step 7-1 that divides the audio signal into<br>
auditory events, each of which tends to be perceived as separate and distinct and to<br>
an optional "Identify Characteristics of Auditory Events" function or step 7-2. The<br>
process of FIG. 5 may be employed to divide the audio signal into auditoiy events or<br>
some other suitable process may be employed. The auditory event information,<br>
which may be an identification of auditory event boundaries, determined by function<br>
or step 7-1 is stored and formatted, as desired, by a "Store and Format" function or<br>
step 7-3. The optional "Identify Characteristics" function or step 7-3 also receives<br>
the auditory event information. The "Identify Characteristics" function or step 7-3<br>
may characterize some or all of the auditory events by one or more characteristics.<br>
Such characteristics may include an identification of the dominant subband of the<br>
auditor}' event, as described in connection with the process of FIG. 5. The<br>
characteristics may also include one or more of the MPEG-7 audio descriptors,<br>
including, for example, a measure of power of the auditoiy event, a measure of<br>
amplitude of the auditoiy event, a measure of the spectral flatness of the auditory<br>
event, and whether the auditoiy event is substantially silent. The characteristics may<br>
also include other characteristics such as whether the auditoiy event includes a<br>
transient. Characteristics for one or more auditoiy events are also received by the<br>
"Store and Format" function or step 7-3 and stored and formatted along with the<br>
auditoiy event information.<br>
Alternatives to the arrangement of FIG. 7 are shown in FIGS. 8 and 9. In FIG.<br>
8, the audio input signal is not applied directly to the "Identify Characteristics"<br>
function or step 8-3, but it does receive information from the "Identify Auditoiy<br>
Events" function or step 8-1. The arrangement of FIG. 5 is a specific example of<br>
such an arrangement. In FIG. 9, the functions or steps 9-1, 9-2 and 9-3 are arranged<br>
in series.<br>
The details of this practical embodiment are not critical. Oilier ways to<br>
calculate the spectral content of successive time segments of the audio signal,<br>
calculate the differences between successive time segmer , and set auditoiy event<br>
boundaries at the respective boundaries between success time segments when the<br>
difference in the spectral profile content between such successive time segments<br>
exceeds a threshold may be employed.<br>
It should be understood that implementation of other variations and<br>
modifications of the invention and its various aspects will be apparent to those skilled<br>
in the ait, and that the invention is not limited by these specific embodiments<br>
described. It is therefore contemplated to cover by the present invention any and all<br>
modifications, variations, or equivalents that fall within the true spirit and scope of<br>
the basic underlying principles disclosed and claimed herein.<br>
The present invention and its various aspects may be implemented as software<br>
functions performed in digital signal processors, programmed general-puipose digital<br>
computers, and/or special purpose digital computers. Interfaces between analog and<br>
digital signal streams may be performed in appropriate hardware and/or as functions<br>
in software and/or firmware.<br>
