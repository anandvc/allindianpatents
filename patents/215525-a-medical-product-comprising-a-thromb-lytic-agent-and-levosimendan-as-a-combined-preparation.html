				<td>"A MEDICAL PRODUCT COMPRISING A "THROMBOLYTIC AGENT AND<br>
LEVOSIMENDAN AS A COMBINED PREPARATION"<br>
Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a medical product comprising,<br>
a thrombolytic agent and levosimendan or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof ?as a combined preparation.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Myocardial infarction is an important complication of coronary artery disease<br>
and usually results from a critical reduction in coronary blood flow secondary to<br>
coronary thrombosis. Intravenous thrombolytic agent therapy has been widely used to<br>
restore flow to the occluded coronary artery. A thrombolytic agent is a medicament<br>
capable of lysing the fibrin-platelet thrombus, and thereby permitting; blood to again<br>
flow through the affected blood vessel. Such agents include streptokinase, urokinase,<br>
prourokmase, reteplase, alteplase and itissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). The<br>
mortality of patients with acute myocardial infarction even if treated with<br>
thrombolytic agents remains high.<br>
Levosimendan, which is the (-)-enaatiomer of [[4-(l,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-<br>
methyl-6-oxo-3-pyridazinyl)phenyl]hydrazono]propanedinitrile, and the method for<br>
its preparation is described in EP 565546 B1. Levosimendan is potent in the<br>
treatment of heart failure and has significant calcium dependent binding to troponin.<br>
Levosimendan is represented by the formula:<br>
The hemodynamic effects of levosimendan in man are described in Sundberg,<br>
S. et al., Am. J. Cardiol., 1995; 75:1061-1066 and in Lilleberg, J. et al., J.<br>
Cardiovasc. Pharmacol., 26(Suppl.1), S63-S69,1995. Pharmacokinetics of<br>
levosimendan in man after i.v. and oral dosing is described in Sandell, E.-P. et al., J.<br>
Cardiovasc. Pharmacol., 26(Suppl.l), S57-S62,1995. The use of levosimendan in the<br>
treatment of myocardial ischemia is described in WO 93/21921. The use of<br>
levosimendan in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension is described in WO<br>
99/66912. The use of levosimendan in the treatment or prevention of coronary graft<br>
vasospasm in described in WO 01/ 00211. Levosimendan solutions suitable for<br>
intravenous use have been described in WO 01/19334. Clinical studies have<br>
confirmed the beneficial effects of levosimendan in congestive heart failure patients.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It has now been found that administration of a thrombolytic agent together<br>
with levosimendan has a beneficial synergistic effect on the mortality of patients<br>
treated for myocardial infarction. Therefore, the combination is particularly useful for<br>
the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.<br>
Thus, in one aspect the present invention provides a method for the treatment<br>
of acute myocardial infarction, which comprises the simultaneous, separate or<br>
sequential administration of an effective amount of a thrombolytic agent and<br>
levosimendan or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a patient in need<br>
thereof.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a method for the treatment of<br>
acute myocardial infarction, said method comprising administering to a patient in<br>
need thereof a thrombolytic agent in combination with levosimendan or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
hi another aspect the present invention provides a method for reducing<br>
mortality of patients with acute myocardial infarction, which comprises the<br>
simultaneous, separate or sequential administration of an effective amount of a<br>
thrombolytic agent and levosimendan or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to<br>
a patient in need thereof.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides a method for reducing mortality of<br>
patients with acute myocardial infarction, which comprises administering to a patient<br>
in need thereof a thrombolytic agent in combination with levosimendan or a<br>

In another aspect the invention provides a medical product comprising,<br>
separately or together, as active ingredients a thrombolytic agent and levosimendan<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as a combined preparation.<br>
In another aspect invention provides a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising as active ingredients a thrombolytic agent and levosimendan or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides the use of a thrombolytic agent and<br>
levosimendan or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as active ingredients in<br>
the manufacture of a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential<br>
administration.<br>
In still another aspect the invention provides use of a thrombolytic agent and<br>
levosimendan or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as active ingredients in<br>
the manufacture of a medicament for reducing mortality of patients with myocardial<br>
infarction.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The method of the invention relates to a combination therapy for more<br>
effective treatment of acute myocardial infarction. The present method provides a<br>
treatment, which improves the overall clinical outcome of patients treated with a<br>
thrombolytic agent by administering levosimendan in combination with a<br>
thrombolytic agent. In particular, the combination treatment of the invention is able<br>
to synergistically reduce mortality of acute myocardial infarction patients.<br>
The terms "treatment" or "treating" as used herein refers to reduction in<br>
severity or frequency of symptoms and/or their underlying cause, improving the<br>
clinical outcome of a patient, prevention of the occurrence of the symptoms and/or<br>
their underlying cause, and improvement or remediation of damage.<br>
The term "acute myocardial infarction" is defined as immediate or sudden<br>
(not chronic) infarction of the heart muscle, i.e. an insufficiency of arterial blood<br>
flow as a result of occlusion of a coronary artery due to at least partial blockage of<br>
the artery by an embolus or thrombus. As used herein, "thrombus" or "embolus" refer<br>
to a blood clot within the blood vessel. "At least partial" blockage of the artery means<br>
that the artery contains an embolus or thrombus, which reduces the cross sectional<br>
area of the artery.<br>
The term "thrombolytic agent" is meant to refer to any agent effective in<br>
helping to dissolving or breaking up an occluding thrombus. A thrombolytic agent<br>
may be selected from those thrombolytic agents, which are known in the art. These<br>
include, but are not limited to, streptokinase, urokinase, prourokinase, alteplase,<br>
reteplase, anistreplase and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and biologically active<br>
variants thereof. A combination of two or several thrombolytic agents may be also<br>
used.<br>
The active ingredients are preferably administered concurrently as soon as<br>
possible, preferably within six hours, after the onset of symptoms of an acute<br>
myocardial infarction. If it is desired to avoid other medication during the<br>
thrombolytic therapy, which may be given e.g. as an intravenous bolus or infusion,<br>
levosimendan may be administered sequentially after the administration of the<br>
thrombolytic agent.<br>
While it is preferred to administer levosimendan during or immediately after<br>
the thrombolytic therapy, it has been found that the synergistic effect of the<br>
combination is still obtained, if levosimendan administration is started not later than<br>
five days, preferably not later than three days, more preferably not later than 48<br>
hours, from the thrombolytic therapy or, preferably, from the onset of symptoms of<br>
an acute myocardial infarction.<br>
If desired, levosimendan administration may also be given before the<br>
thrombolytic therapy. However, in general, thrombolytic therapy should be started as<br>
soon as possible once the condition of a blocked artery has been diagnosed. .<br>
Therefore, it is preferred that, in case of sequential administration, the treatment<br>
method according to the invention comprises a first step of administering an effective<br>
amount of a thrombolytic agent and a second step of administering an effective<br>
amount of levosimendan, wherein the time period between the two treatments is not<br>
more than five days, preferably not more than three days, more preferably not more<br>
than 48 hours.<br>
The administration routes of the active ingredients include, but are not limited<br>
to, enteral, e.g. oral or rectal, or parenteral, e.g. intravenous, intramuscular,<br>
intraperitoneal or transdermal. In the treatment of myocardial infarction, the active<br>
ingredients are preferably administered parenterally, intravenous route being<br>
particularly preferred. Single or multiple dosages may be given. Preferably, the active<br>
agents are administered via continuous infusion.<br>
Preferably, the method comprises administering to a patient an amount of the<br>
combination, which is synergistically effective in reducing mortality of patients with<br>
myocardial infarction.<br>
Levosimendan may be administered intravenously using an infusion rate<br>
which is from about 0.05 to 0.4 µg/kg/min. For an intravenous bolus a suitable dose<br>
is in the range from about 5 to 30 µg/kg. In the treatment of patients with acute<br>
myocardial infarction an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion may be<br>
needed.<br>
Levosimedan may be administered orally to man in daily dose ranging from<br>
about 0.1 to 8 mg given once a day or divided into several doses a day, depending on<br>
the age, body weight and condition of the patient. The effective amount of<br>
levosimendan to be administered to a subject depends upon the condition to be<br>
treated, the route of administration, age, weight and the condition of the patient.<br>
Preferred thrombolytic agents include streptokinase, urokinase, prourokinase,<br>
alteplase, reteplase, anistreplase and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and<br>
biologically active variants thereof as well as any combinations thereof. The<br>
thrombolytic agent may be administered using the conventional dosage ranges for<br>
these agents, for example a daily dosage used when the agent is administered in<br>
thrombolytic therapy as a monotherapy. The range will, of course, vary depending on<br>
the thrombolytic agent employed. Examples of normal dosage ranges are as follows:<br>
urokinase - 500,000 to 6,250,000 units/patient; streptokinase -140,000 to 2,500,000<br>
units/patient; prourokinase - 5,000 to 100,000 units/patient; anistreplase - 10 to 100<br>
units/patient; t-PA - 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg body weight.<br>
Thrombolytic therapy is typically given as an intravenous bolus alone or<br>
followed by intravenous infusion or as an infusion alone. The infusion is normally<br>
administered over a time ranging from less than one hour to about 12 hours, typically<br>
from about 1 to 3 hours. For example, the thrombolytic therapy may comprise<br>
administration of up to 10 % of the total dose as bolus injection over 1 to 5 minutes<br>
and the remaining 90 % then as a constant infusion during the next hour.<br>
When the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level, treatment can<br>
be stopped.<br>
The combination may be supplemented with one or more other active<br>
ingredients, e.g. anticoagulants, or surgical methods such as angioplasty.<br>
The active ingredients can be formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms<br>
suitable for the treatment according to the present invention using the principles<br>
known in the art. They are given to a patient as such or preferably in combination<br>
with suitable pharmaceutical excipients in the form of tablets, granules, capsules,<br>
suppositories, emulsions, suspensions or solutions whereby the contents of the active<br>
compound in the formulation is from about 0.5 to 100 % per weight. Choosing<br>
suitable ingredients for the composition is a routine for those of ordinary skill in the<br>
art. It is evident that suitable carriers, solvents, gel forming ingredients, dispersion<br>
forming ingredients, antioxidants, colours, sweeteners, wetting compounds, release<br>
controlling components and other ingredients normally used in this field of<br>
technology may be also used.<br>
The active ingredients may be formulated in the same pharmaceutical<br>
formulation. Preferably, such pharmaceutical composition of thrombolytic agent and<br>
levosimendan is adapted to intravenous administration. Such compositions may be<br>
prepared for storage by mixing these compounds with optional pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers, e.g. into the form of infusion<br>
concentrates or aqueous solutions, or powders adapted to be reconstituted with sterile<br>
water or aqueous infusion vehicles for infusion.<br>
Alternatively, the active ingredients are formulated as separate pharmaceutical<br>
dosage forms. The combination of the two pharmaceutical dosage forms may be<br>
packaged as a single medical product or kit for use in the method of the invention,<br>
optionally together with a package insert instructing to the correct use of the medical<br>
product.<br>
Formulations suitable for intravenous administration such as injection or<br>
infusion formulation, comprise sterile isotonic solutions of the active ingredient and<br>
vehicle, preferably aqueous solutions. Typically an intravenous infusion solution of<br>
levosimendan comprises from about 0.01 to 0.1 mg/ml of levosimendan. Levosimen-<br>
dan composition as stored before use is preferably an infusion concentrate product,<br>
which can be reconstituted with sterile water or aqueous infusion vehicle for<br>
infusion. Levosimendan solutions suitable for use in the present invention are<br>
described e.g. in WO 01/19334.<br>
For oral administration of levosimendan in tablet form, suitable carriers and<br>
excipients include e.g. lactose, corn starch, magnesium stearate, calcium phosphate<br>
and talc. For oral administration in capsule form, useful carriers and excipients<br>
include e.g. lactose, corn starch, magnesium stearate and talc. For controlled release<br>
oral compositions release controlling components can be used. Typical release<br>
controlling components include hydrophilic gel forming polymers such as<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl celluloses,<br>
alginic acid or a mixture thereof; vegetable fats and oils including vegetable solid oils<br>
such as hydrogenated soybean oil, hardened castor oil or castor seed oil (sold under<br>
trade name Cutina HR), cotton seed oil (sold under the trade names Sterotex or<br>
Lubritab) or a mixture thereof; fatty acid esters such as triglycerides of saturated fatty<br>
acids or their mixtures e.g. glyceryl tristearates, glyceryl tripalmitates, glyceryl<br>
trimyristates, glyceryl tribehenates (sold under the trade name Compritol) and<br>
glyceryl palmitostearic acid ester.<br>
Tablets can be prepared by mixing levosimendan with the carriers and<br>
excipients and compressing the powdery mixture into tablets. Capsules can be<br>
prepared by mixing levosimendan with the carriers and excipients and placing the<br>
powdery mixture in capsules, e.g. hard gelatin capsules. Typically a tablet or a<br>
capsule comprises from about 0.1 to 8 mg, more typically 0.2 to 5 mg, of<br>
levosimendan.<br>
Thrombolytic agent compositions as used in clinical practice comprises<br>
generally water as a carrier and pharmaceutical adjuvants known in the art, i.e.<br>
isotonizing agents; acid, base or buffer substances to adjust the pH of the solution;<br>
and stabilizing agents for the thrombolytic agent. Said thrombolytic agent<br>
composition as stored before use is preferably a sterile lyophilized product, which<br>
can be reconstituted with sterile water for injection.<br>
The concentration of the thrombolytic agent in the composition depends on<br>
the nature of the thrombolytic agent. For example, tissue plasminogen activator may<br>
be present in an amount from 20 mg to 100 mg per dosage form. The concentration<br>
of tissue plasminogen activator in a lyophilized product is typically in the range of<br>
from 1.5 to 2 % (w/w). As pH adjusting agents, phosphoric acid and optionally<br>
sodium hydroxide may be used, so that upon reconstitution with sterile water for<br>
injection, a pH of about 7.3 is reached. As stabilizing agent for the thrombolytic<br>
agent, an ammo acid may be used, for example I^arginine in the case of tissue<br>
plasminogen activator. The stabilizing agent makes up the bulk of the lyophilized<br>
thrombolytic agent, typically from about 70 % to about 80 % (w/w).<br>
Examples of preferred products according to the present invention are those<br>
wherein the thrombolytic preparation and levosimendan solution are miscible and,<br>
when mixed, form a stable formulation for up to eight hours at room temperature.<br>
The two formulations can then be stored together, but in separate containers such as<br>
vials, prefilled syringes and the like, and mixed immediately before use. A preferred<br>
container comprises the thrombolytic preparation (a) and the levosimendan solution<br>
(b) separately in a two-chamber container including means to mix both liquids. The<br>
two-chamber container is ideally a pre-filled, two-chamber syringe with bypass or<br>
similar means (e.g. a breakable seal) allowing mixing of the two separate solutions<br>
prior to administration, and which is further adapted for use with infusion devices.<br>
Alternatively, the separate containers may be adapted to allow administration<br>
of the thrombolytic preparation and the levosimendan solution sequentially, e.g. such<br>
that levosimendan solution can be administered immediately after thrombolytic<br>
administration or e.g. after one hour from the administration of the thrombolytic<br>
agent.<br>
Salts of levosimendan may be prepared by known methods. Pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts are useful as active medicaments, however, preferred salts are the<br>
salts with alkali or alkaline earth metals.<br>
Pharmaceutical examples.<br>
Example 1. Concentrate solution for intravenous infusion<br>
(a) levosimendan 2.5 mg/ml<br>
(b)KollidonPF12 10 mg/ml<br>
(c) citric acid 2 mg/ml<br>
(d) dehydrated ethanol ad 1 ml (785 mg)<br>
The concentrate solution was prepared by dissolving citric acid, Kollidon PF121 and<br>
levosimendan to dehydrated ethanol in the sterilized preparation vessel under stirring.<br>
The resulting bulk solution was filtered through a sterile filter (0.22 µm). The sterile<br>
filtered bulk solution was then aseptically filled into 8 ml and 10 ml injection vials (with<br>
5 ml and 10 ml filling volumes) and closed with rubber closures.<br>
The concentrate solution for intravenous infusion is diluted with an aqueous<br>
vehicle before use. Typically the concentrate solution is diluted with aqueous isotonic<br>
vehicles, such as 5 % glucose solution or 0.9 % NaCl solution so as to obtain an<br>
aqueous intravenous solution, wherein the amount of levosimendan is generally<br>
within the range of about 0.001 -1.0 mg/ml, preferably about 0.01 - 0.1 mg/ml.<br>
Example 2. t-PA composition in lyophilized state<br>
(a) t-PA 2.0 % (w/w)<br>
(b) phosphoric acid 20 % (w/w)<br>
(c) L-arginine 78 % (w/w)<br>
The ingredients were mixed, lyophilized and sterilized using standard<br>
methods. The lyophilized product comprising 20, 50 or 100 mg t-PA per dosage form<br>
(vial) is reconstituted with sterile water for injection, for example to solution having<br>
concentration of 1 mg/ml.<br>
Example 3. Oral levosimendan composition<br>
Hard gelatin capsule size 3<br>
Levosimendan 2.0 mg<br>
Lactose 198 mg<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation in the form of a capsule was prepared by<br>
mixing levosimendan with lactose and placing the powdery mixture in hard gelatin<br>
capsule.<br>
Experiments<br>
Effect of the combination on the mortality of the patients with acute myocardial<br>
infarction<br>
Patients who had suffered from acute myocardial infarction within five days received<br>
placebo or a 6-hour infusion of levosimendan using a bolus of 6,12 or 24 µg/kg and<br>
subsequent infusion of 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 µg/kg/min. Patients were divided according to<br>
whether they had received thrombolytic therapy or not. The 180 day mortality was<br>
measured. The results are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that the combination<br>
provided synergistic reduction in the mortality of patients with acute myocardial<br>
infarction.<br>
