BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a system and method for<br>
allocating a Channel Quality Information Channel (CQICH) in a communication<br>
system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Active research on the next generation communication system is being<br>
conducted to provide users with desired services which can meet a desired<br>
Quality-of-Service (QoS) at a high data rate.<br>
A wireless Local Area Network (LAN) communication system and a<br>
wireless Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) communication system support a<br>
high data rate. The wireless MAN communication system, one of the typical<br>
Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) communication systems, has broader service<br>
coverage and supports a higher data rate, compared with the wireless LAN<br>
communication system. Therefore, active research on the next generation<br>
communication system is being conducted to develop a new communication<br>
system that guarantees mobility of a mobile station (MS) and QoS to the wireless<br>
LAN communication system and the wireless MAN communication system, both<br>
of which guarantee a higher data rate, to thereby support a higher data rate of the<br>
next generation communication system.<br>
A system employing an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) scheme and/or an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access<br>
(OFDMA) scheme to support a broadband transmission network for physical<br>
channels of the wireless MAN communication system is known as an Institute of<br>
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 communication system. The<br>
IEEE 802.16 communication system, applies the OFDM/OFDMA scheme to the<br>
wireless MAN communication system, and can therefore support high-speed data<br>
transmission by transmitting physical channel signals using a plurality of<br>
subcarriers. For convenience, the following description will be made with<br>
reference to the IEEE 802.16 communication system, one of the typical BWA<br>
communication systems.<br><br>
A description will now be made of a Fast Base Station Switching (FBSS)<br>
scheme among various handover schemes for connection switching from a<br>
serving base station (BS) to a target BS in the IEEE 802.16 communication<br>
system.<br>
The FBSS scheme is a handover scheme that uses selection diversity and<br>
fast switching mechanism to improve link quality. In the FBSS scheme, a mobile<br>
station (MS) exchanges signals with only one active BS, i.e., an anchor BS,<br>
among active BSs included in the MS's diversity set. The anchor BS is a type of<br>
serving BS, and is replaceable (or switchable) according to a BS selection scheme<br>
of the MS. A description will now be made of the diversity set.<br>
Each of active BSs constituting the MS's diversity set is distinguished<br>
with a temporary BS indicator (Temp BS ID), and all of the active BSs<br>
constituting the diversity set share capability, security parameters, service<br>
parameters, and full Medium Access Control (MAC) context information of the<br>
corresponding MS. Each of the active BSs constituting the diversity set can be<br>
excluded from the diversity set or a new BS currently not included in the diversity<br>
set can be added to the diversity set as a new active BS according to strength of a<br>
signal received (by the MS) from each active BS.<br>
The MS selects one of the active BSs constituting the diversity set as an<br>
anchor BS. In this case, strength, for example, carrier-to-interference and noise<br>
ratio (CINR), of a signal received from the active BS selected as the anchor BS is<br>
highest, compared with CINRs of signals transmitted by the other active BSs<br>
constituting the diversity set. Therefore, in the FBSS scheme, the MS "performs<br>
communication" with only the anchor BS. The anchor BS that currently<br>
communicates with the MS will be referred to as a "serving anchor BS." The MS<br>
measures signal quality for each of the active BSs constituting the diversity set<br>
while communicating with the serving anchor BS. Measuring the signal quality<br>
means measuring a CINR of the corresponding signal. Upon detecting the<br>
presence of any active BS providing higher signal quality than that of the current<br>
serving anchor BS as a result of the signal quality measurement, the MS<br>
determines to handover from the serving anchor BS to the active BS that provides<br>
the higher signal quality than that of the current serving anchor BS,<br>
accomplishing fast switching. Herein, an active BS, to which the MS performs<br>
fast switching, that provides a higher signal quality than that of the current<br>
serving anchor BS will be referred to as a "target anchor BS."<br><br>
With reference to FIG. 1, a description of an FBSS-based fast switching<br>
operation of an MS in a conventional IEEE 802.16 communication system will<br>
now be given. FIG. 1 is a flowchart illustrating an FBSS-based fast switching<br>
operation of an MS in a conventional IEEE 802.16 communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an MS performs communication with a serving<br>
anchor BS in step 101. Thereafter, the MS measures signal quality for each active<br>
BSs constituting the MS's diversity set in step 103. Herein, the phrase an MS<br>
performs communication with a serving anchor BS means that allocation<br>
information for the MS is included in MAP messages, i.e., a downlink MAP (DL-<br>
MAP) message and an uplink MAP (UL-MAP) message, transmitted by the<br>
serving anchor BS.<br>
The MS determines in step 105 whether it should switch the serving<br>
anchor BS, i.e., it should perform a fast switching operation. Herein, the MS<br>
determines to switch the serving anchor BS if there is any active BS having a<br>
higher signal quality than that of the serving anchor BS. If there is no need to<br>
switch the anchor BS as a result of the determination, the MS returns to step 101.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 105 that there is a need to switch the anchor<br>
BS, the MS proceeds to step 107.<br>
In step 107, the MS detects a start point of a switch period. Herein, the<br>
switch period refers to a period in which an MS reports a serving anchor BS that<br>
it will perform a fast switching operation to a new active BS, i.e., a target anchor<br>
BS, rather than the serving anchor BS. The switch period will be described later<br>
in detail with reference to FIG. 2. In step 109, after detecting the start point of the<br>
switch period, the MS transmits a Temp BS ID of a target anchor BS to which it<br>
will perform a fast switching operation from the serving anchor BS, to the serving<br>
anchor BS in the switch period. Herein, the MS transmits the Temp BS ID of the<br>
target anchor BS (i.e., a codeword corresponding to the Temp BS ID), to the<br>
serving anchor BS through a CQICH allocated from the serving anchor BS. The<br>
CQICH is a channel used by the MS to transmit a control signal in a process of<br>
feeding back a Channel quality information (CQI) value of the serving anchor BS<br>
or performing an FBSS-based fast switching operation.<br>
Possible codewords mapped to corresponding Temp BS IDs are shown in<br>
Table 1 below.<br><br><br>
In Table 1, "Value" represents codewords mapped to corresponding Temp<br>
BS IDs of active BSs. For example, if the MS desires to perform fast switching<br>
from a serving anchor BS to a target anchor BS with Temp BS ID="011", the MS<br>
transmits a codeword "Ob 100011" mapped to the Temp BS ID='011' to the<br>
serving anchor BS through a CQICH. In Table 1, a codeword '0b101000' is not a<br>
codeword mapped to a Temp BS ID of an active BS, but is a codeword used by<br>
the serving anchor BS to inform the MS that it has received a transmitted anchor<br>
BS switch Information Element (Anchor BS Switch IE). A format of the Anchor<br>
BS Switch IE will be described later in detail.<br>
In step 111, the MS transmits a CQI value for the serving anchor BS<br>
through a CQICH being identical to the CQICH used for transmitting a codeword<br>
mapped to the Temp BS ID of the target anchor BS. The MS determines in step<br>
113 whether an Anchor BS Switch IE indicating a fast switching cancel request to<br>
the target anchor BS is received from the serving anchor BS. A format of the<br>
Anchor BS Switch IE is shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
In Table 2, N_Anchor BS_Switch represents the number of anchor BS<br>
fast switching informations included in the Anchor BS Switch IE, and the Anchor<br>
BS Switch IE can include anchor BS fast switching informations allocated to a<br>
plurality of MSs because it is included in a MAP message before being<br>
broadcasted. Herein, the number of anchor BS fast switching informations is<br>
equivalent to "N_Anchor BS_Switch", and each of "anchor BS fast switching<br>
informations" is equivalent to each of informations in "for (i = 0; i
BS_Switch;i++)" structure. The Anchor BS Switch IE includes a Connection<br>
Identifier (CID) for each of the anchor BS fast switching informations, an Action<br>
code, and CQICH allocation information for the Action code. The CID represents<br>
a basic CID for each MS, and the Action code represents information on a switch<br><br>
period in which the MS fast-switches to the target anchor BS, or information used<br>
for commanding the MS to fast-switch to a target anchor BS indicated by the<br>
serving anchor BS in a period (i.e., a switch period), indicated by the serving<br>
anchor BS, or for commending the MS to cancel the fast switching.<br>
As shown in Table 2, Action code="00" indicates that the MS should<br>
perform a fast switching operation to the target anchor BS at a default time in a<br>
switch period defined in a Downlink Channel Descriptor (DCD) message, Action<br>
code='01' indicates that the MS should perform a fast switching operation to the<br>
target anchor BS at an action time specified in the Anchor BS Switch IE, and<br>
Action code='10' indicates that the MS should cancel the fast switching operation<br>
and maintain communication with the serving anchor BS.<br>
In Table 2, CQICH Allocation Indicator represents CQICH allocation<br>
information to be used by the MS in the target anchor BS. The CQICH allocation<br>
information includes CQICH ID, Feedback channel offset indicating a position of<br>
a CQICH actually allocated to the MS in a CQI field defined in a UL-MAP<br>
message, Period(p) indicating a period in which the MS reports a CQI value,<br>
Frame offset indicating a time at which the MS starts reporting a CQI value, and<br>
Duration(d) indicating information on effective duration of a CQICH allocated<br>
from the target anchor BS. Therefore, an MS, receiving the CQICH allocation<br>
information, reports a CQI value to the target anchor BS through the CQICH<br>
every 2P frame for frame duration after the Frame offset time.<br>
If it is determined in step 113 that an Anchor BS Switch IE indicating a<br>
fast switching cancel request to the target anchor BS is received from the serving<br>
anchor BS (i.e., the Action code is set to "10"), the MS proceeds to step 115. In<br>
step 115, the MS cancels a fast switching operation (from the serving anchor BS<br>
to the target anchor BS), and then ends the process.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 113 that an Anchor BS Switch IE<br>
indicating a fast switching cancel request to the target anchor BS is not received<br>
from the serving anchor BS, the MS proceeds to step 117 where it determines<br>
whether the switch period has expired. If it is determined that the switch period<br>
has not expired, the MS returns to step 109 where it can repeatedly transmit<br>
information indicating a desired fast switching operation to the target anchor BS<br>
(i.e., the MS transmits a codeword mapped to a Temp BS ID of the target anchor<br>
BS), to the serving anchor BS. The repeated transmission of the codeword<br><br>
mapped to the Temp BS ID of the target anchor BS continues until the switch<br>
period has expired in step 117 or the Anchor BS Switch IE indicating a fast<br>
switching cancel request to the target anchor BS is received from the serving<br>
anchor BS in step 113 even though the switch period has not expired.<br>
If it is determined in step 117 that the switch period has expired, the MS<br>
proceeds to step 119 where it determines whether CQICH allocation information<br>
to be used in the target anchor BS has been received from the serving anchor BS.<br>
Herein, the MS can be aware of the CQICH allocation information to be used in<br>
the target anchor BS through CQICH allocation information previously allocated<br>
before the MS performs a fast switching operation from the serving anchor BS to<br>
the target anchor BS, or through Anchor BS Switch IE shown in Table 2 for the<br>
switch period. Alternatively, even in the process of adding a new active BS to it's<br>
the MS's diversity set, the MS can acquire CQICH allocation information of the<br>
active BS through a handover control message. The operation of managing the<br>
diversity set through the handover control message will not be further described<br>
herein because it is not directly related to the present invention.<br>
If it is determined in step 119 that the CQICH allocation information to<br>
be used in the target anchor BS has not been received, the MS proceeds to step<br>
121 where it performs a fast switching operation from the serving anchor BS to<br>
the target anchor BS and then waits a preset time. Further, the MS determines<br>
whether CQICH allocation information is received through a MAP message<br>
broadcasted by the target anchor BS within the preset time. A format of CQICH<br>
allocation information, i.e., CQICH Alloc IE, in the MAP message including the<br>
CQICH allocation information is shown in Table 3 below.<br><br><br><br>
In Table 3, CQICH Alloc IE allocated in a target anchor BS indicates<br>
CQICH allocation information used by an MS to exchange control signals with<br>
the target anchor BS, and the CQICH Alloc IE includes CQICH ID, Feedback<br>
channel offset for providing actual location information of a CQICH in a CQI<br>
field defined in a UL-MAP message, and Frame offset indicating a time at which<br>
the MS actually starts reporting a CQI value after being allocated a CQICH. In<br>
addition, the CQICH Alloc IE includes Period(p) indicating a period in which the<br>
MS reports the CQI value, and Duration(d) indicating an effective time for which<br>
the MS can use the allocated CQICH.<br>
If it is determined in step 121 that the CQICH allocation information is<br>
not received, the MS proceeds to step 123. In step 123, the MS performs a<br>
network re-entry operation with the target anchor BS and then ends the process<br>
because it failed to receive CQICH allocation information from the target anchor<br>
BS, i.e., because the MS failed to be allocated the CQICH from the target anchor<br>
BS even after the MS completed a fast switching operation from the serving<br>
anchor BS to the target anchor BS. Herein, the term "network re-entry operation"<br>
refers to an operation of acquiring synchronization with the target anchor BS and<br>
then performing initial ranging, registration and authentication.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 119 that the CQICH allocation<br>
information to be used in the target anchor BS has been received, the MS<br>
proceeds to step 125. Also, if it is determined in step 121 that the CQICH<br>
allocation information has been received, the MS proceeds to step 125. In step<br>
125, the MS performs a fast switching operation and communication with the<br>
target anchor BS through the CQICH allocated thereto, and then ends the process.<br>
The FBSS-based fast switching operation of an MS in the conventional<br>
IEEE 802.16 communication system has been described so far with reference to<br>
FIG. 1. Next, with reference to FIG. 2, a description will be made of a format of<br>
an Anchor Switch Reporting (ASR) slot used in an FBSS-based fast switching<br>
operation of an MS in the general IEEE 802.16 communication system.<br><br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a format of an ASR slot used in an FBSS-<br>
based fast switching operation of an MS in a conventional IEEE 802.16<br>
communication system. Reference numeral 201 represents transmission of a<br>
control signal from an MS to a serving anchor BS, shown on the time axis,<br>
reference numeral 203 represents transmission of a control signal from the MS<br>
and a target anchor BS, also shown on the time axis. As illustrated in FIG. 2, in<br>
the FBSS scheme, the time axis is divided in ASR slots. Each of the ASR slots is<br>
comprised of a plurality of, for example, M frames. The number, M, of frames<br>
constituting the ASR slot is determined by a BS, and the MS obtains the number,<br>
M, of frames constituting the ASR, determined by the BS, through a DCD<br>
message.<br>
Reference numeral 205 represents an ASR slot before a fast switching<br>
operation performed with the serving anchor BS by the MS, and reference<br>
numerals 207 and 209 represent ASR slots in a switch period, for which the MS<br>
transmits a control signal used for informing the serving anchor BS of the fast<br>
switching operation from the serving anchor BS to the target anchor BS. The<br>
switch period includes one or more ASR slots. The number of ASR sots<br>
constituting the switch period is also determined by the BS, and the MS finds the<br>
number of ASR slots constituting the time switch, determined by the BS, through<br>
the DCD message. Reference numeral 211 represents an ASR slot in which the<br>
MS performs communication with the target anchor BS after performing a fast<br>
switching operation from the serving anchor BS to the target anchor BS, i.e., after<br>
completing the switching operation.<br>
In the ASR slot 205 before a fast switching operation, in which the MS is<br>
communicating with the serving anchor BS, the MS transmits a CQI value of the<br>
serving anchor BS .to the serving anchor BS every frame in the ASR slot 205<br>
while performing communication with the serving anchor BS. In the ASR slot<br>
205, if the MS determines that it should a perform fast switching operation from<br>
the serving anchor BS to the target anchor BS, the MS waits until termination of<br>
the corresponding ASR slot, i.e., the ASR slot 205, where it determined to<br>
perform the fast switching operation, instead of immediately performing the fast<br>
switching operation at the time where it determined to perform the fast switching.<br>
After termination of the ASR slot 205, the MS informs the serving anchor<br>
BS for the switch period that it will perform fast switching from the serving<br>
anchor BS to the target anchor BS. In this case, the MS transmits, to the serving<br><br>
anchor BS, a CQI value CA of the serving anchor BS and an indicator IB<br>
indicating that it will perform a fast switching operation from the serving anchor<br>
BS to the target anchor BS. Although the indicator IB and the CQI value CA are<br>
alternately transmitted in FIG. 2 on a frame-by-frame basis, by way of example, a<br>
pattern for transmitting the indicators IB and the CQI values CA in the switch<br>
period can be variably determined by the MS. At any rate, the MS should transmit<br>
the indicator IB and the CQI value CA at least once in a first ASR slot of the<br>
switch period.<br>
After the end of the switch period, the MS that performed the fast<br>
switching operation from the serving anchor BS to the target anchor BS, transmits<br>
a CQI value of the target anchor BS in the ASR slot 211 while performing<br>
communication with the target anchor BS.<br>
As described above, in the FBSS scheme, the MS performs a fast<br>
switching operation from the serving anchor BS to the target anchor BS by<br>
transmitting control signals using a CQICH. However, if the MS fails to be<br>
previously allocated a CQICH from the target anchor BS after performing the fast<br>
switching operation from the serving anchor BS to the target anchor BS in the<br>
switch period, the MS should perform network re-entry with the target anchor BS<br>
as described above, causing a delay in connection setup.<br>
If the MS fails to acquire CQICH allocation information from the target<br>
anchor BS even after performing the FBSS-based fast switching operation, the<br>
MS performs a network re-entry operation with the target anchor BS, causing a<br>
connection setup delay. Accordingly, there is a need for a scheme capable of<br>
enabling the MS to rapidly set up a connection with the target anchor BS after<br>
performing the FBSS-fast switching operation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a system and method for allocating a<br>
CQICH in a communication system.<br>
The present invention also provides a system and method for allocating a<br>
CQICH in an FBSS-based fast switching operation in a communication system.<br>
The present invention further provides a system and method in which an<br><br>
MS sends a CQICH allocation request to a target anchor BS in an FBSS-based<br>
fast switching process in a communication system.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method for allocating a channel quality information channel (CQICH) in a<br>
communication system. After performing fast switching operation from a serving<br>
anchor base station (BS) to a target anchor BS, a mobile station (MS) detects<br>
absence of a CQICH allocated from the target anger BS. Upon detecting the<br>
absence of the allocated CQICH, the MS sends a request for allocating the<br>
CQICH to the target anchor BS. Upon receiving the CQICH allocation request,<br>
the target anchor BS detects a need to allocate a CQICH to the MS.<br><br>

after performing a fast switching operation from a serving anchor BS to the target<br>
anchor BS in a BWA communication system, the MS sends a CQICH allocation<br>
request to the target anchor BS and the target anchor BS allocates a CQICH to the<br>
MS in response to the CQICH allocation request from the MS. For convenience,<br>
an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to an<br>
IEEE 802.16 communication system, one of the typical BWA communication<br>
systems. An embodiment of the present invention can also be applied to other<br>
communication systems as well as the IEEE 802.16 communication system.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an FBSS-based fast switching<br>
operation in an IEEE 802.16 communication system according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. An MS 300 performs communication with a serving<br>
anchor BS 350 in step 301. Herein, the phrase the MS 300 performs<br>
communication with a serving anchor BS 350 means that allocation information<br>
for the MS 300 is included in MAP messages (i.e., a downlink MAP (DL-MAP)<br>
message and an uplink MAP (UL-MAP) message), transmitted by the serving<br>
anchor BS 350. In the course of performing communication with the serving<br>
anchor BS 350, the MS 300 transmits a CQI value of the serving anchor BS 350<br>
through a CQICH allocated from the serving anchor BS 350. Also, in the course<br>
of performing communication with the serving anchor BS 350, the MS 300<br>
measures signal quality for each of active BSs constituting its own diversity set in<br>
step 303. Herein, measuring the signal quality for each of the active BSs means<br>
measuring strength, i.e., a carrier-to-interference and noise ratio (CINR) of a<br>
signal received from each of the active BSs.<br>
The MS 300 determines to replace (switch) a serving anchor BS<br>
according to the signal quality measurement result for each of the active BSs<br>
included in the diversity set. In other words, the MS 300 determines to switch its<br>
anchor BS from the serving anchor BS 350 to a particular active BS among the<br>
active BSs (i.e., a target anchor BS 360), in step 305. Herein, the MS 300<br>
determines to switch its anchor BS from the serving anchor BS 350 to the target<br><br>
anchor BS 360 if there is any active BS, i.e., the target anchor BS 360, having<br>
higher signal quality than that of the serving anchor BS 350.<br>
Upon determining to switch its anchor BS, the MS 300 detects a start<br>
point of a switch period after termination of a corresponding Anchor Switch<br>
Reporting (ASR) slot. In the switch period, the MS 300 transmits a codeword<br>
mapped to a temporary BS indicator (Temp BS ID) of the target anchor BS 360 to<br>
the serving anchor BS 350 in order to inform that the MS will perform a fast<br>
switching operation from the serving anchor BS 350 to the target anchor BS 360,<br>
in step 307. A format of the ASR slot is to the same as the ASR slot format used<br>
in an FBSS-based fast switching operation of an MS in the conventional IEEE<br>
802.16 communication system, described in connection with FIG. 2. Therefore, a<br>
detailed description thereof will be omitted herein for the sake of clarity. Also, the<br>
codeword mapped to the Temp BS ID has been described with reference to FIG. 1<br>
and will note be described further for the sake of clarity.<br>
After transmitting the codeword mapped to the Temp BS ID of the target<br>
anchor BS 360 in the switch period, the MS 300 transmits a CQI value of the<br>
serving anchor BS 350 to the serving anchor BS 350 in step 309. The operation<br>
(steps 311 and 313) of transmitting a codeword mapped to a Temp BS ID of the<br>
target anchor BS 360 and transmitting a CQI value of the serving anchor BS 350<br>
continues until the switch period expires or an Anchor BS Switch IE indicating a<br>
fast switching cancel request to the target anchor BS 360 is received from the<br>
serving anchor BS 350 even though the switch period has not expired. The<br>
Anchor BS Switch IE has been described with reference to Table 2.<br>
Even though the MS 300 transmitted the codeword mapped to the Temp<br>
BS ID of the target anchor BS 360 in the switch period to inform the serving<br>
anchor BS 350 that it will perform fast switching operation from the serving<br>
anchor BS 350 to the target anchor BS 360, the serving anchor BS 350 may<br>
occasionally fail to recognize the scheduled fast switching operation in step 315.<br>
The serving anchor BS 350, because it failed to detect the scheduled fast<br>
switching operation of the MS 300 to the target anchor BS 360, cannot inform the<br>
target anchor BS 360 of the scheduled fast switching operation of the MS 300.<br>
If the switch period expires, the MS 300 performs fast switching from the<br>
serving anchor BS 350 to the target anchor BS 360 in step 317. After performing<br>
the fast switching to the target anchor BS 360, the MS 300 recognizes in step 319<br><br>
that it failed to be allocated a CQICH from the target anchor BS 360. Herein, the<br>
MS 300 detects allocation information for a CQICH allocated from the target<br>
anchor BS 360 through a MAP message broadcasted from the target anchor BS<br>
360. If there is no CQICH allocation information for the MS 300 in the MAP<br>
message, the MS 300 recognizes that it has failed to be allocated a CQICH from<br>
the target anchor BS 360.<br>
Upon recognizing the failure to be allocated a CQICH from the target<br>
anchor BS 360, the MS 300 transmits a CQICH allocation request to the target<br>
anchor BS 360 in step 321. The MS 300 transmits the CQICH allocation request<br>
to the target anchor BS 360 by setting a Type field of a Bandwidth Request header<br>
to "111" before transmission. A format of the Bandwidth Request header<br>
transmitted for requesting CQICH allocation will be described later in detail.<br>
Upon receiving the Bandwidth Request header with Type field="111"<br>
from the MS 300, the target anchor BS 360 recognizes in step 323 that it should<br>
allocate a CQICH to the MS 300, determining that the MS requests CQICH<br>
allocation. Therefore, the target anchor BS 360 allocates a CQICH to be used by<br>
the MS 300, and transmits information on the allocated CQICH to the MS 300 in<br>
step 325. The CQICH allocation information, i.e., CQICH Alloc IE, is<br>
broadcasted through a UL-MAP message, and a format of the CQICH Alloc IE<br>
has been described with reference to Table 3.<br>
Although the operation of transmitting a CQICH allocation request of the<br>
MS 300 using the Bandwidth Request header has been described with reference<br>
to FIG. 3, the MS 300 can also transmit the CQICH allocation request in a method<br>
of adding Type/Length/Value (TLV) to a Ranging-Request (RNG-REQ) message<br>
transmitted in the course of performing a network re-entry operation with the<br>
target anchor BS 360. That is, upon receiving the RNG-REQ message with a<br>
CQICH Allocation Indication bit being set in TLV thereof, the target anchor BS<br>
360 allocates a CQICH to the MS 300, determining that the MS 300 requests<br>
CQICH allocation.<br>
Although an embodiment of the present invention has been described<br>
with reference to the method of transmitting a CQICH allocation request of the<br>
MS 300 using the Bandwidth Request header, in alternate embodiments it is also<br>
possible to define a new message or message header for requesting CQICH<br>
allocation.<br><br>
The FBSS-based fast switching operation in the IEEE 802.16<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention has<br>
been described so far with reference to FIG. 3. Next, with reference to FIG. 4, a<br>
description will be made of a format of a Bandwidth Request header for<br>
requesting CQICH allocation according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
FIG, 4 is a diagram illustrating a format of a Bandwidth Request header<br>
for requesting CQICH allocation according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The Bandwidth Request header is a Medium Access Control (MAC)<br>
header transmitted by an MS to request allocation of a bandwidth for transmitting<br>
a control signal or data, and a numeral written in each field of the Bandwidth<br>
Request header represents the number of bits constituting the corresponding field.<br>
A Header Type (HT) field of the Bandwidth Request header indicates a header<br>
type, and an Encryption Control (EC) field indicates encryption control. In<br>
addition, a Type field indicates a type of a MAC header, and a Bandwidth Request<br>
(BR) field indicates a requested bandwidth that the MS requests to be allocated.<br>
The Type field indicates a type of a corresponding bandwidth allocation request.<br>
For example, if the Type field is set to "000", it means that the bandwidth<br>
allocation request indicates "incremental". That is, it means that a value set later<br>
in the BR field indicates an additional bandwidth that the MS requests to be<br>
allocated later. For example, if the Type field is set to '000' and the BR field is set<br>
to "200" it means that the MS requests an additional 200-bit bandwidth to be<br>
allocated thereto.<br>
If the Type field is set to "001", it means that the bandwidth allocation<br>
request indicates "aggregate". That is, it means that a value set later in the BR<br>
field indicates the needed total bandwidth that the MS was allocated. For example,<br>
if the Type field is set to "001" and the BR field is set to "800" it means that the<br>
MS is allocated an 800-bit bandwidth obtained by totaling the bandwidth<br>
allocated up to the present and the bandwidth allocated through the bandwidth<br>
allocation request.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention sets the Type field to "111". In<br>
this case where the Type field is set to "111", after performing a fast switching<br>
operation from a serving anchor BS to a target anchor BS, an MS requests<br>
allocation of a CQICH to be used in the target anchor BS. When the Type field is<br>
set to "111", the BR field can be filled with "0" (or Null), or filled with<br><br>
information related to a CQI value of the target anchor BS, measured by the MS.<br>
Herein, the information related to the CQI value of the target anchor BS,<br>
measured by the MS, can he expressed with, for example, 5 bits.<br>
A Connection Identifier (CID) field of the Bandwidth Request header<br>
indicates a basic CID of an MS, and a Header Check Sequence (HCS) field<br>
indicates a header check sequence. That is, the Bandwidth Request header is a<br>
CQICH Allocation Request header used by the MS to request CQICH allocation.<br>
The format of the Bandwidth Request header for requesting CQICH<br>
allocation according to an embodiment of the present invention has been<br>
described so far with reference to FIG. 4. Next, with reference to FIG. 5, a<br>
description will be made of an FBSS-based fast switching operation of an MS in<br>
an IEEE 802.16 communication system according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an FBSS-based fast switching operation<br>
of an MS in an IEEE 802.16 communication system according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Before a description of FIG. 5 is given, it should be<br>
noted that a process of steps 501 through 519 shown in FIG. 5 is substantially<br>
equal to the process of steps 101 through 119 described with reference to FIG. 1,<br>
so a detailed description thereof will be omitted herein The MS determines in step<br>
519 whether CQICH allocation information to be used in the target anchor BS has<br>
been received from the serving anchor BS. If it is determined that the CQICH<br>
allocation information to be used in the target anchor BS has not been received,<br>
the MS proceeds to step 521 where it waits a preset time after performing a fast<br>
switching operation from the serving anchor BS to the target anchor BS, and then<br>
determines whether CQICH allocation information is received through a MAP<br>
message broadcasted by the target anchor BS within the preset time. If it is<br>
determined in step 521 that the CQICH allocation information is not received, the<br>
MS proceeds to step 523.<br>
In step 523, the MS transmits a Bandwidth Request header for requesting<br>
CQICH allocation to the target anchor BS because the MS failed to receive<br>
CQICH allocation information of the target anchor BS, i.e., because the MS failed<br>
to be allocated a CQICH from the target anchor BS even after completing a fast<br>
switching operation from the serving anchor BS to the target anchor BS. The MS<br>
determines in step 525 whether the number of transmissions for the Bandwidth<br><br>
Request header is greater than the predetermined maximum number of<br>
transmissions. If the number of transmissions for the Bandwidth Request header<br>
is not greater than the maximum number of transmissions, the MS returns to step<br>
521.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 525 that the number of transmissions<br>
for the Bandwidth Request header is greater than the maximum numer of<br>
transmissions, the MS proceeds to step 527 where it performs a network re-entry<br>
operation with the target anchor BS and then ends the process. Herein, the term<br>
"network re-entry operation" refers to an operation of acquiring synchronization<br>
with the target anchor BS and then performing initial ranging, registration and<br>
authentication.<br>
If it is determined in step 519 that the CQICH allocation information to<br>
be used in the target anchor BS has been received, the MS proceeds to step 529.<br>
Also, if it is determined in step 521 that the CQICH allocation information has<br>
been received, the MS proceeds to step 529. In step 529, the MS performs<br>
communication with the target anchor BS through a CQICH allocated thereto,<br>
and then ends the process.<br>
As can be understood from the foregoing description, in the BWA<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention,<br>
during FBSS-based fast switching, an MS sends a CQICH allocation request to a<br>
target anchor BS if the MS fails to be allocated a CQICH from the target anchor<br>
BS even after performing fast switching from a serving anchor BS to the target<br>
anchor BS, thereby contributing to a reduction in connection setup delay. In<br>
particular, for fast switching, the MS sends the CQICH allocation request to the<br>
target anchor BS using a Bandwidth Request header, enabling fast connection<br>
setup to the target anchor BS.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a<br>
certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the<br>
art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>
