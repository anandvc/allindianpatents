				<td>Description<br>
The present invention relates to a method for setting up a non-wired network by<br>
determining and utilizing local topology information.<br>
The wire-based network topology for transmitting data between a plurality of<br>
communication devices is associated with loss of mobility and therefore loss of<br>
convenience. By contrast, network technology which is not wire-based allows<br>
data to be transmitted over short distances without being subject to limitations in<br>
terms of mobility. In addition to this, the communication devices can connect<br>
spontaneously and autonomously.<br>
In a first method, a first communication device initially receives a list specifying<br>
the further communication devices to which it can connect. By advancing<br>
progressively through the list or by means of manual manipulation, the first<br>
communication device decides which further communication device it should ask<br>
to set up a connection.<br>
In a second method (Specification *of the Bluetooth System, Version 1.2, Core)<br>
for setting up a non-wired network, a distinction relating to communication<br>
devices is made between a communication control device which is responsible<br>
for the control of the communication and a communication device which is<br>
controlled by the communication control device. Two communication control<br>
devices or two controlled communication devices cannot generally connect to<br>
each other. The number of communication devices which can be controlled by a<br>
communication control device can be limited by technical and/or administrative<br>
measures. If a communication control device can only control a limited number of<br>
communication devices, this means that the size of a network is restricted by the<br>
subscriber capacity of its communication control device. A larger number of<br>
communication devices can be achieved by combining individual networks to<br>
form a larger overall network. There are two possibilities for creating the required<br>
bridge connection between two communication control devices. One possibility is<br>
for a device to function as a communication control device in the first network<br>
and as a controlled communication device in the second network. Another<br>
possibility is to connect two communication control devices via a controlled<br>
communication device. Various network topologies can be obtained in this<br>
context, e.g. tree-type, chain-type or mesh-type topologies.<br>
In one implementation of a non-wired network according to the second method at<br>
the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, information indicating<br>
whether it is to operate as a communication control device or as a controlled<br>
communication device is required from each device when it starts. Various<br>
topologies can then be generated on the basis of the positioning and the<br>
sequence in which the devices are switched on (http://wwwcomnet.<br>
technion.ac.il/~cn9w02). Such a network having a tree topology has been<br>
set up at the ETH in Zurich (http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/~beutel/bt_node.html). The<br>
formation algorithm is not known in greater detail.<br>
This method has a disadvantage in that no information concerning the local<br>
topology of the network is available to a communication device desiring to set up<br>
a connection. As a consequence, it is possible that an individual communication<br>
device or whole subnetworks are not integrated into the overall network.<br>
Furthermore, the setup of a network can only be achieved statically and therefore<br>
does not satisfy the dynamic requirements in the case of non-wired transmission<br>
involving a plurality of communication devices.<br>
The present invention addresses the problem of specifying a method by means<br>
of which an overall network comprising a plurality of communication devices can<br>
organize itself, and individual communication devices and/or subnetworks which<br>
are not yet connected are included when this network is set up.<br>
This problem is solved by a method having the features specified in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention are specified in the dependent<br>
claims.<br>
An essential aspect of the invention is the determining of the local topology<br>
information. In accordance with the claimed method as per claim 1, this is<br>
achieved by means of a message exchange between the communication<br>
devices. To this end, a first communication device sends a query message<br>
containing a list of identification codes of further communication devices, to which<br>
a connection can be set up, to second communication devices which are<br>
connected to said first communication device. At least one second<br>
communication device, wherein a connection exists between the second<br>
communication device and one of the further communication devices identified in<br>
the query message and/or wherein said second communication device is itself a<br>
communication device identified in the query message, sends a reply message to<br>
the first communication device. From the reply message, it is possible to<br>
determine the identification codes of the further communication devices which<br>
are connected to the second communication device and/or to extract the<br>
identification code of the second communication device if this is itself a<br>
communication device identified in the query message.<br>
The first communication device requests the setting up of a connection to at least<br>
one further communication device which is identified in the query message and<br>
to which no connection exists from a second communication device. A successful<br>
request results in a connection setup.<br>
Without restricting the generality of this term, communication devices are<br>
understood to include PCs and computer peripheral devices, mobile devices<br>
(laptops, handheld PCs, PDAs), telecommunication devices (mobile phones,<br>
ISDN installations), video and TV devices, audio devices and domestic<br>
appliances (washing machines, refrigerators), for example. These devices can be<br>
networked using IrDA, Bluetooth or WLAN modules, for example.<br>
In accordance with a further advantageous embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the identification codes of the further communication devices which are identified<br>
in the query message and connected to the second communication device are<br>
listed in the reply message of the second communication device and/or the<br>
identification code of the second communication device is listed if the latter is<br>
itself a communication device from the query message. This requires less<br>
storage space and therefore ensures a faster and more efficient message<br>
exchange.<br>
The mesh size of a non-wired network is advantageously adjusted by a step size<br>
for the message exchange, wherein said step size defines the number of<br>
communication devices via which a query message is sent within a network<br>
topology. A mesh-type topology of the network emerges in this context. The<br>
bigger the step size, the coarser the mesh of the overall network. Mesh-type<br>
topologies have the advantage that they are less susceptible to failure than other<br>
topologies such as tree-type or chain-type topologies. If one route in a network<br>
fails, the option of a second possible route still remains. In the event of a failure<br>
of a device or a subnetwork, it is usually possible already to repair the overall<br>
network after the next message exchange of a participating communication<br>
device. An additional advantage of a mesh-type topology is the faster routing of<br>
data. As a result of the multiple possible routes for a connection between two<br>
devices, a smaller traffic load is produced on individual devices/routes.<br>
Furthermore, the routes between two devices are usually shorter as a result of<br>
meshing than in the case of a chain topology, for example.<br>
According to an advantageous development of the present invention, the local<br>
topology information is determined by means of a message exchange between<br>
the communication control devices.<br>
A first communication control device sends a query message containing a list of<br>
identification codes of further communication devices, to which a connection can<br>
be set up, via a communication device which is controlled by a communication<br>
control device, to second communication control devices which are connected to<br>
said controlled communication device. At least one second communication<br>
control device, wherein a connection exists between the second communication<br>
control device and one of the further communication devices identified in the<br>
query message and/or wherein said second communication control device is<br>
itself a communication device identified in the query message, sends a reply<br>
message to the first communication control device. From the reply message, it is<br>
possible to determine the identification codes of the further communication<br>
devices which are connected to the second communication control device and/or<br>
to extract the identification code of the second communication control device if<br>
this is itself a communication device identified in the query message.<br>
The first communication control device requests the setting up of a connection to<br>
at least one further communication device which is identified in the query<br>
message and to which no connection exists from a second communication<br>
control device. A successful request results in a connection setup.<br>
Without restricting the generality of this term, communication control devices are<br>
understood to include a master device in accordance with the Bluetooth<br>
communication protocol or a primary station in accordance with the IrDA<br>
protocol. Consequently, a controlled communication device corresponds to a<br>
slave device in accordance with the Bluetooth protocol and to a secondary<br>
station in accordance with the IrDA protocol.<br>
The present invention is explained below using an exemplary embodiment with<br>
reference to the drawing, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of an exemplary network topology<br>
comprising a plurality of communication control devices and<br>
controlled communication devices,<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic illustration of the network topology from Figure<br>
1 after execution of the algorithm using the step size n=2,<br>
Figure 3 shows a schematic illustration of the network topology from Figure<br>
1 after execution of the algorithm using the step size n=4.<br>
In the Figures 1-3, the six black colored circles symbolize the communication<br>
control devices and the fourteen white colored circles symbolize the controlled<br>
communication devices. In this configuration, it is not possible for two<br>
communication control devices or two controlled communication devices to<br>
connect to each other directly. A connection between two communication control<br>
devices is only possible via a communication device which, in this exemplary<br>
embodiment, can be connected to a maximum of two communication control<br>
devices. In general, it is possible to extend the number of communication control<br>
devices which can be connected via a controlled communication device. In the<br>
following exemplary embodiment, the controlled communication devices are<br>
designated simply as communication devices. The term devices is used as a<br>
generic term for communication control devices and controlled communication<br>
devices.<br>
Figure 1 shows a subnetwork comprising four communication control devices<br>
1,2,3,5 and ten communication devices 7,8,9,10,11,15,16,17,18,19, a<br>
subnetwork which is not connected to this and comprises two communication<br>
control devices 4,6 and three communication devices 12,13,20, and one<br>
individual communication device 14. The drawn partial circle 22 graphically<br>
illustrates the transmission range of the communication control device 1. An<br>
unbroken line 21 symbolizes an existing connection between the devices, the<br>
example for the line 21 being a connection between the communication control<br>
device 1 and the communication device 15.<br>
As a first step, the communication control device 1 receives a list containing the<br>
identification codes of the devices 14,16,17,19,2,18,3,15,11,4,6,12,20,13 within<br>
its transmission range. The communication control device 1 firstly removes the<br>
identification codes of the communication devices 15 and 16, to which it is<br>
directly connected, from its list, which therefore contains the identification codes<br>
of the devices 14,17,19,2,18,3,11,4,6,12,20,13.<br>
The execution of the algorithm is considered once using the step size n=2 and<br>
once using the step size n=4.<br>
n=2:<br>
After the communication control device 1 has sent the list to the communication<br>
control devices which are connected to it within the step size n=2, it receives the<br>
reply message identifying the devices 3,18 from the communication control<br>
device 3. Following receipt of the message, the communication control device 1<br>
deletes the identification codes cited in the reply message from its list, which<br>
consequently contains the identification codes of the devices<br>
14,17,19,2,11,4,6,12,20,13.<br>
The communication control device 1 successfully sets up a connection to<br>
communication device 14. A new query message is now generated containing<br>
the identification codes of the devices 17,19,2,11,4,6,12,20,13. There is no reply<br>
message in the present example, because the communication device 14 does<br>
not have a connection to any communication control device other than<br>
communication control device 1.<br>
The communication control device 1 now sets up a connection to communication<br>
device 17, which is also successful. A new query message containing the<br>
identification codes of the following devices 19,2,11,4,6,12,20,13 is now<br>
generated and sent. The communication control device 1 receives a reply<br>
message containing the identification codes of the devices 2,19 from the<br>
communication control device 2. Following receipt of the message, the<br>
communication control device 1 deletes the identification codes cited in the reply<br>
message from its list, which consequently contains the identification codes of the<br>
devices 11,4,6,12,20,13.<br>
The communication control device 1 successfully sets up a connection to<br>
communication device 11. A new query message containing the identification<br>
codes of the devices 4,6,12,20,13 is now generated and sent. Although the<br>
communication device 11 is connected to the communication control device 5,<br>
the communication control device 1 does not receive a reply message from the<br>
communication control device 5 because none of the devices known to the<br>
communication control device 5 is included in the query message.<br>
The communication control device 1 now attempts to set up a connection to the<br>
communication control device 4, but this fails because the communication control<br>
device 4 is itself a communication control device. The communication control<br>
device 4 is deleted from the list. The attempt to set up a connection to the<br>
communication control device 6 fails for the same reason. The communication<br>
control device 6 is deleted from the list. The connection setup to the<br>
communication device 12 likewise fails because the communication device 12 is<br>
already connected to two communication control devices. The communication<br>
device 12 is deleted from the list.<br>
The communication control device 1 successfully sets up a connection to the<br>
communication device 20. A query message containing the identification code of<br>
the communication device 13 is now generated and sent. Although the<br>
communication device 13 is connected to the communication control device 6,<br>
the communication control device 1 does not receive a reply message from the<br>
communication control device 6, because the communication control device 1 did<br>
not request a device to which the communication control device 6 is directly<br>
connected or which the communication control device 6 itself is.<br>
The communication control device 1 successfully sets up a connection to the<br>
communication device 13. Communication device 13 is deleted from the list,<br>
which is consequently empty. The execution of the algorithm is therefore<br>
complete.<br>
Figure 2 shows the network topology from Figure 1 after the above-described<br>
algorithm using the step size n=2 has been executed. It is clear that the individual<br>
communication device 14 and the subnetwork including the devices 4,6,12,13,20<br>
have been integrated into the network by the communication control device 1.<br>
n=4:<br>
After the communication control device 1 has sent the list to the communication<br>
control devices which are connected to it within the step size n=4, it receives the<br>
reply message containing the identification codes of the devices 3,18 from the<br>
communication control device 3, the reply message containing the identification<br>
codes of the devices 2,18,17,19 from the communication control device 2, and<br>
the reply message containing the identification code of the communication device<br>
11 from the communication control device 5. Following receipt of the message,<br>
the communication control device 1 deletes the identification codes cited in the<br>
reply message from its list, which consequently contains the identification codes<br>
of the devices 14,4,6,12,20,13.<br>
The communication control device 1 successfully sets up a connection to<br>
communication device 14. A new query message containing the identification<br>
codes of the following devices 4,6,12,20,13 is now generated. There is no reply<br>
message, because the communication device 14 does not have a connection to<br>
any communication control device other than communication control device 1.<br>
10<br>
The communication control device 1 now attempts to set up a connection to the<br>
communication control device 4, but this fails because the communication control<br>
device 4 is itself a communication control device. The communication control<br>
device 4 is deleted from the list. The attempt to set up a connection to the<br>
communication control device 6 fails for the same reason. The communication<br>
control device 6 is deleted from the list. The connection setup to the<br>
communication device 12 likewise fails because the communication device 12 is<br>
already connected to two communication control devices. The communication<br>
device 12 is deleted from the list.<br>
The communication control device 1 successfully sets up a connection to the<br>
communication device 20. A query message containing the identification code of<br>
the communication device 13 is now generated and sent. Because the<br>
communication device 20 is connected to the communication control device 6<br>
and because the step size n=4, whereby the communication control device 4 is<br>
also reached, communication control device 1 receives the reply message<br>
containing the identification code of the communication device 13 from the<br>
communication control device 4. Communication device 13 is deleted from the<br>
list, which is consequently empty. The execution of the algorithm is therefore<br>
complete.<br>
Figure 3 shows the network topology from Figure 1 after the above-described<br>
algorithm using the step size n=2 has been executed. It is clear that the individual<br>
communication device 14 and the subnetwork including the devices 4,6,12,13,20<br>
have been integrated into the network by the communication control device 1. In<br>
comparison with Figure 2, it is also clear that a more coarsely meshed topology<br>
is produced by the algorithm using the larger step size n=4.<br>
The application of the present invention is not restricted to the exemplary<br>
embodiments described here.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
