FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention relates to the filed of heterogeneous wireless networks such as Third Generation Universal Mobile Telecommunications System and Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks. More particularly, this invention relates to a system and methods for integration of third generation Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems and Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
A typical IEEE 802.16d/e [1],[2] wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) consists of mobile stations (MS) or mobile terminals (MT), base station (BS) or access points (AP) and access point controller (APC) or access router (AR), as shown in Fig. 1. A session is defined as a shared state between an MS and an AP. Each session is composed of multiple connections, where a connection is defined as the active portion of a session that requires resources at the air interface. The IEEE 802.16d/e standard specifies a connection oriented medium access control (MAC) in which each connection is assigned a connection identifier (CID) to enable the AP to allocate resources to the connection. At the beginning of every session, it is necessary for the AP and the MS to negotiate the protocols and protocol configurations for the session so as to enable efficient resource allocation and provide the necessary quality of service (QoS).<br>
The IEEE 802.16 system has a connection oriented MAC and each flow is identified by a unique connection identifier (CID). The radio resource management is based on the CID, which specifies the required quality of service (QoS) for each flow. The standards to support mobility in such networks are provided in [2]. Efficient mobility management mechanisms for such networks were discussed in [3]. The QoS provisioning is enabled by classifying traffic into 4 categories namely, unsolicited grant service (UGS) for ATM CBR like services, real time polling service (RT PS) for VoIP, streaming video services, non-real time polling service (nRT PS) for FTP traffic and best effort. The MT registers with the AP using the REG-REQ and REG-RSP commands. The bandwidth request MAC header enables the MT to request the AP for bandwidth according to the application. The DSA-REQ command is sent by the MT to the AP specifying the application and traffic category for QoS negotiation.<br>
The UMTS system [4] consists of a mobile terminal (MT) also referred to as the user equipment (UE), a base station (BS), also called as node-B and a radio network controller (RNC), which, in turn, is connected to the GSM core network. The basic architecture for a UMTS system is shown in Fig. 2. The interfaces between the network components are also defined and are shown in Fig. 2. The network shown in Fig. 2 is also called as the UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN). The RNC controlling a base station is called as<br><br>
the controlling RNC for the corresponding node B. From the UE point of view, there is a serving RNC which terminates the mobile link layer communications. There could be one or more drift RNC's which terminate the mobile physical layer communications. The splitting and combining of uplink and downlink traffic are done at the node B, the serving RNC and the drift RNC's.<br>
The interfaces at the UMTS networks are as follows [5]. The lu interface (between the RNS and the core network) is also considered as the reference point. The RNC's are connected by the lur interface that enables the UMTS network to operate as an autonomous network from the core GSM network The RNC and the base stations are connected by the lub interface and the air interface between the UE and the node B is called as the Uu interface. The user plane of the lu interface allocates resources to various flows over the physical link. Resources are allocated upon activity and re-allocated during idle periods. When an RNC wants to disassociate from an SGSN, it issues an lu_Release command, upon receiving which, the lu can be released. The packet switched traffic is routed from the RNS to the SGSN using the lu-PS interface. This interface is also responsible for the mobility management. The RNC is responsible for frequency allocation and the allocated frequency or channel set to each node B is conveyed to the respective node B's through the lub interface.<br>
The mobility management in the UMTS system is as follows. As soon as the UE powers up it is in the PMM-DETATCHED state in which there is no communication between the UE and the node B. When the GPRS attach procedure is completed, the MS moves to the PMM-CONNECTED state. When PS signaling is released, the state changes to PMM-IDLE, which is a state indicating that the PS signaling to the 3G-SGSN is broken. If the UE is out of coverage or if the URA update timer expires or if the radio resource controller connection cannot be established, then the UE is detached from then SGSN and the state changes to PMM-DETATCHED. The state transitions at the UE are shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The state transition diagram at the SGSN is as shown in Fig. 4. The signals leading to the state transitions are as at the UE except that the state remains at PMM-CONNECTED if the serving RNC changes.<br>
The network operation mode could be of two types: Type I when the Gs interface is present and Type II when Gs interface is not present. When the Gs interface is present, the UE can initiate combined update procedures. However, the mode should be the same for the entire routing area.<br>
The radio resource controller (RRC) state machine for UTRAN is shown in Fig. 5. When there is no radio resource allocated to a UE, the RRC is in the RRC Idle Mode, in which, the MS can receive paging messages about the CN. In the RRC Connected Mode, the main states are Cell Connected and URA connected. When the UE is tracked at cell<br><br>
level the RRC state is in the Cell Connected state and if the UE is tracked at the routing area level, then the state is URA connected. No dedicated radio resources are used at the URA Connected state. The UE in the RRC URA Connected state is paged by the RNC before a downlink transfer. In response, the UE sends a Cell Update message, upon receiving which, the state changes to the RRC Cell Connected state, and then, the RNC transfers the data and the signaling messages to the UE. To provide quality of service (QoS) to users, the traffic is classified into 4 categories, namely, interactive, voice, stream and best effort.<br>
In the current technology, there is no efficient architecture and interfaces defined for the integration of WMAN and 3G wireless networks.<br>

In the tightly coupled system, the WMAN network is made to appear as a foreign 30 network to an existing 3G network. Similarly the 3G network is made to appear as a foreign WMAN network to an existing WMAN network. The tightly coupled architecture requires an integrating component that has the functionalities of both the 3G as well as the WMAN networks.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention presents a tightly coupled architecture for the integration of UMTS and IEEE 802.16 networks. There are two cases considered here:<br>
1.	When the UMTS and the 802.16 networks are at the same level, i.e., we have a one hop wireless network<br>
2.	When the coverage is only by UMTS but the traffic to the back bone network is back-hauled to an IEEE 802.16 network, thus resulting in a two hop wireless network<br>
It first provides the architecture for case 1 mentioned above, and then extend the architecture to include case 2.<br><br>
For the Type 1 network mentioned above, we present the architecture shown in Fig. 6. In the figure, we have the MT, AP and AR that belong to the IEEE 802.16 system, and the UE, node B and the RNC that belongs to the UMTS system. We define mobile user terminal (MUT) which has a dual mode capability and can associate with both the UMTS system as well as the IEEE 802.16 system. The UMTS-802.16 Integrator shown in Fig. 6 has the following functions. The integrator is expected to have the SGSN as well as the 802.16 APC/AR functionalities built in it because is to be connected to the backbone network as well as the GGSN of a 3G core network. The 3G GGSN treats the integrator as another SGSN, while the IEEE 802.16 AR treats the integrator as another AR. When an MUT registers with a 3G-UMTS network and decides to send traffic over the 3G network, then the data is transmitted to the back bone network through the SGSN. The integrator is connected to the AR of the 802.16 network as well as the back bone network. When an MUT moves from an 802.16 WMAN network to a 3G UMTS network, the integrator corresponds to the appropriate GGSN through the back bone network and also mentions the IP address of the target RNC. The GGSN treats this as an SGSN-SGSN handover and the existing handover mechanisms for inter SGSN defined in the 3GPP standards can be used. However, these result in additional signals to the RNC and the node B's since the registration process into the 3G handover is now initiated by the SGSN, and not the UE. The UE capabilities in UMTS [4] consist of the UMTS UE radio capability information, including power control, code resource, UE mode, ciphering and PDCP capabilities. When a dual mode MUT undergoes a hand off from an IEEE 802.16 network and indicates a handoff from an IEEE 802.16 network to a UMTS network, it shall inform the AP of its UMTS capabilities along with target UMTS RNC, which in turn, transfers this information to the IEEE 802.16 AR along with the context of the active flows. The integrator then performs a registration of the MUT at the SGSN. The MUT capabilities are then communicated to the appropriate RNC. Once the MUT hands off to the UMTS network, it shall then perform the UMTS power up procedures. The choice of the SGSN and RNC are however made after taking into account, information on the context of the flows incident on the mobile and the QoS requirements. The signaling for an IEEE 802.16 to UMTS handover is shown in Fig. 7. In the figure, the MOB_HOJND message is the hand off indication message that is given by the IEEE 802.16 AR to the integrator. The integrator obtains the mobile registration information and communicates to the SGSN, the UMTS RNC and the Node B. The mobile then registers in the UMTS network following the UMTS power up procedures This also requires the SBC-REQ and the SBC-RSP messages in the IEEE 802.16 network to be suitably modified to incorporate dual mode capability of the MT and the appropriate 3G MS ID and the IEEE 802.16 MAC address. The SBC-REQ message in the IEEE 802.16 standards [1] has an 8 bit field for the management message<br><br>
type and a variable length field which is TLV encoded information. In the TLV encoded information the MUT shall communicate the dual mode capability along other capabilities. The MOB_HOJND message for the IEEE 802.16e standard [2] has an 8 bit field for management message type and a 6 bit reserved field. It also contains a 2 bit field for the hand off type. The handoff type 11 is currently reserved. The reserved handoff type is now used for indicating vertical handoff. Following the handoff type field is a 48 bit field for the target AP MAC address. This field is used only for the horizontal handoff, i.e., from one IEEE 802.16 network to another. When the vertical handoff type message is received by an AP, the AP sends a UBC_REQ message to the MUT. This message is the UMTS basic capabilities request message. The MUT responds with the UBC_RSP message which contains the UMTS capabilities of the MUT. The AP communicates this information to the AR, which, in turn communicates this to the SGSN, from which the RNC and node B obtain the capabilities and the context information. The MUT then powers up performs the UMTS network re-entry process at the UMTS node B. The modified MOB_HOJND message is shown in Table 1. The UBC_REQ and UBC_RSP message formats are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The TLV encoded information for the UBC_REQ message shall include the RNC and the node B in which the MUT can be expected to register after handoff to the UMTS network. The UBC^RSP message format is shown in Table 3. The TLV encoded information shall include the UMTS capabilities of the MUT as well as the UMTS MS-ID.<br>

Table 3: UBC_RSP message for Type 1 architecture<br>
Similarly, the registration process in the 3G network and the capability negotiation in the 3G network require additional fields to incorporate the dual mode capability of the terminals.<br>
When handover takes place from the 3G UMTS to the IEEE 802.16 network, then the integrator is treated as a new AR and L3 handover mechanisms are required for completing the handover process. The mobile traffic context and the MAC address is informed to the corresponding AP and radio resource management and the registration processes are performed. However, the handover process also requires changes to the UMTS standards because the registration at the IEEE 802.16 network is now performed by the AR and not the MT as specified in the standards [1], [2]. Instead, we present a set of hand over signals as shown in Fig. 8. In the figure, the RA_Update message is the message sent by the UE to the node B indicating a change in the routing area. The integrator assigns a care-of-address (CoA) to the UE and also maps the CoA to the IEEE 802.16 IP address. When the handover is indicated by the routing area update with the new SGSN/RNC id corresponding to that of the integrator, the MUT capabilities are transferred to the IEEE 802.16 AR, which, in turn, initiates the registration and network entry process. It is also essential that the mobile context and QoS categories be mapped appropriately. The integrator therefore maps all the 3G categories of the incident flows to the appropriate IEEE 802.16 QoS classes. Hence, the integrator and the associated IEEE 802.16 network is made to appear as a foreign 3G UMTS network.<br><br>
The MUT stack is shown in Fig. 9. It contains both the 802.16 device driver as well as the UMTS device driver.<br>
The UMTS device driver implements the UMTS user and control functions [4]. When an MUT powers up in the UMTS coverage area, it runs the UMTS- GPRS power up procedure through the serving RNC (SRNC). The GPRS attach and the authentication procedures are followed and the best effort bearer set up is also performed. When powered up in the 802.16 network, the MUT exchanges the REG-REQ, REG-RSP messages to register and the basic capability negotiation is performed with the SBC-REQ and SBC-RSP messages. Depending on the QoS required for the service, radio resource availability and the network conditions an MUT could choose to handover from one network to the other. In the following, we present some of the basic messages in the integrated system and the interfaces between the various components of the integrated system.<br>
The interfaces for the Type 1 architecture mentioned earlier are provided in Fig. 10. The functions of the interfaces are as follows.<br>
The integrator acts as a foreign 3G network and the authentication and accounting is performed through the 3G AAA server. As mentioned earlier, the integrator consists of GGSN functionalities of the GPRS-UMTS system. When an MUT powers on in the 3G network it communicates with the node B over the Uu interface. The other interfaces are explained as follows:<br>
&gt;	Gn/Gp: This is the interface between an SGSN and a GGSN. The Gn interface is used if both the SGSN as well as the GGSN belong to the same PLMN and the Gp interface is used, otherwise. This interface allows an SGSN to communicate user data while changing SGSN.<br>
&gt;	Wz: This reference point occurs between the 802.16 AAA server and the AR. This reference point allows the 802.16 AAA server to authenticate 3G users in the WMAN cell. Functions of this reference point are similar to the Wy reference point mentioned below.<br>
&gt;	Wr': This interface connects the 802.16 network to the 3G network through the integrator. The reference point exists between the integrator and the AR. The functionalities of this reference point include<br>
^   Data for authentication signaling between MT and the 3G ^   Signaling for WMAN AR and the 3G authentication ^   Purging data for 802.16 access termination<br>
&gt;	Wy: This interface exists between the 3G AAA server and the 3G home subschber<br>
system i.e., the home GGSN. The prime purpose is for the 802.16 AAA infra<br>
structure and the HSS. This shall be RADIUS based. Some of the functionalities of<br><br>
this reference point include<br>
/   Registration of theSGPP server for authorized 802.16 access<br>
^   Purge procedure between 3GPP AAA and HSS<br>
/ Retrieval of online and offline charging function addresses from the HSS An alternate architecture is one in which the MUT does not have a dual mode capability and has only 3G UMTS or IEEE 802.16 capabilities. In this case the MUT registers with the network depending on its capabilities. If the MUT has only 3G capabilities and wants to move to the IEEE 802.16 network, the flows handled by the MUT needs to be mapped to appropriate service flow ID (SFID) and the connection ID (CID). It is also essential for the MUT to obtain a care of address (CoA). The integrator provides the CoA for the MUT and acts as a foreign network for the home 3G network. The signaling shown in Fig. 8 can be applied to this scenario for the handoff from UMTS network to IEEE 802.16 network. However, the basic capabilities need not be registered with the IEEE 802.16 AR. The CoA can be appropriately mapped to a virtual mobile in the IEEE 802.16 network. All packets from the correspondent node are then transferred to the appropriate IEEE 802.16 AR, with IP tunneling. Similariy, when the MUT has IEEE 802.16 capabilities and wants to hand over to the 3G UMTS network, then the service class of the flows need to be appropriately mapped to the 3G traffic category and the CoA and the SRNC is assigned to the MUT. The integrator now acts as a foreign 3G network and the message exchanges are suitably performed (i.e., the 802.16 REG and MUT capability messages are suitably changed to the 3G messages).<br>
A third type of architecture for the Type 1 network is as shown in Fig. 11. In this type of architecture, the integrator has to have the functionalities of the SGSN, the RNC, and the IEEE 802.16 AR built in it. Here, when an MUT powers up in the UMTS domain, It registers with the serving RNC. When a handover takes place to another RNC, the UMTS handover procedures are followed. When the MUT moves from an 802.16 network to a UMTS network, the integrator is treated as a new RNC or a new SGSN depending on the target SGSN. Then, one of the inter-RNC or inter-SGSN handover procedures can be applied accordingly. The handover from UMTS to IEEE 802.16 network is as explained in the previous architecture shown in Fig. 10. It is also possible to upgrade the integrator to include functions of the node B also. This results in added complexity and overheads, but may result in reduced vertical handoff latency time.<br>
We also present an architecture for the integration of a UMTS and an IEEE 802.16 network, when the IEEE 802.16 network is used as a back haul to the UMTS network. A schematic of this scenario is shown in Fig. 12. In the figure, it is shown that the integrator has an air interface connection to the IEEE 802.16 AP. Thus there exists a two hop wireless network to transfer traffic into the back bone network. In this scenario the IEEE 802.16 AP<br><br>
treats the integrator as an IEEE 802.16 MT. The Registration request and response messages now contain the MAC address of the integrator. However, it is noted that the packets that are transmitted by the SGSN are IP packets whereas the AP can only decipher MAC packets. Hence, the integrator needs to include the IEEE 802.16 MAC headers before transmitting the packets to the AP. The MAC address of the integrator shall then be used by the AR to de-capsulate the IP packets and then transmit it over the back bone network. Similarly, when the AR receives IP packets from the back bone network corresponding to the IP address of the UMTS MUT, the AR forwards the packet to the appropriate AP. The AP then encapsulates the IP packet with the appropriate MAC packets and transmits to the integrator. This architecture therefore requires that when the SGSN registers with an AP it also mentions to the AP about the IP addresses of the MUTs associated with it. Hence, it requires the following changes to the registration process at the IEEE 802.16 AP. The REG-REQ message in the IEEE 802.16 standards [1] has an 8 bit field for the management message type and a variable length field which is TLV encoded information. In the TLV encoded information the integrator shall add the IP addresses of the MUT or the SGSN along with other capabilities. The architecture shown in Fig. 12 is valid or MUT with dual mode capabilities or with UMTS capabilities. For an MUT with IEEE 802.16 capabilities alone, the MUT cannot handover to the UMTS network as there is no link to the back bone network. To handover to a UMTS network that is back hauled to another IEEE 802.16 AP-_ -Mechanisms in [31 can be adopted to perform an inter-IEEE 802.16 AP handover. If the UMTS network belongs to a different AR, then L3 handover mechanisms are applied to perform the handover to the UMTS network.<br>
