The front wheel brake BF is a hydraulic brake operated by a fluid pressure applied thereto by a front wheel master cylinder 13 which is operated by operating the front wheel brake operating lever 11 or by a front wheel slave cylinder 17 which is operated by a fluid pressure applied thereto by a rear wheel master cylinder l41. The front wheel brake BF is, for example, a disk brake having a caliper piston 15 operated by the output fluid pressure of the front wheel master cylinder 13. The rear wheel brake BR is a mechanical brake which is operated by a rear wheel slave cylinder 16 which is operated by the output fluid pressure of a rear wheel master cylinder operated by operating the rear wheel brake operating lever 121. The rear wheel brake BR is, for example, a drum brake comprising a brake drum 19 mounted on a rear axle 18, a pair of brake shoes 22 supported on a brake panel 20 by pins 21 so as to be brought into frictional engagement with the inner circumference of the brake drum 19, a cam supported for turning on the brake panel 20 and capable of pressing the brake shoes 22 against the inner circumference of the brake drum 19, a brake cam arm 24 having a base end connected to the brake cam 23 and extending outside the brake drum 19, a fixed arm 25 fixed to the brake drum 19 opposite to the brake cam arm 24, and a return spring 25 resiliently extended between the arms 24 and 25 so as to bias the brake cam arm 24 in a direction to move the brake shoes<br>
22 toward each other. The rear wheel slave cylinder 16 drives the brake cam arm 24 to apply the rear wheel brake BR.<br>
Handgrips 29 and 30 to be gripped by the driver's right and the driver's left hand are attached to the right and the left end of a steering bar supported on the front portion of the body of the motor scooter. The front wheel master cylinder 13 is fixedly attached to a portion of the steering bar 28 on the inner side of the handgrip 29. The rear wheel master cylinder 14X is fixedly attached to a portion of the steering bar 28 on the inner side of the handgrip 30.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the rear wheel master cylinder 141 has a cylinder body 31 fixed to the steering bar 28, and a master piston 33 axially slidably fitted in the cylinder body 31 with the front end, i.e. , the right end as viewed in Fig. 2, thereof received in a liquid pressure chamber 32. A piston rod 34 coaxial with the master piston 33 extends from the master piston 33 backward, i.e., to the left as viewed in Fig. 2. A return spring 35 is extended in the liquid pressure chamber 32 so as to bias the master piston 33 backward. A limiting plate 36 for limiting the backward movement of the master piston 33 and determining the rearmost position of the master piston 33 is attached to a rear portion of the cylinder body 31.<br>
A pair of cup seals 37 and 38 are mounted on the master piston 33 to define an annular liquid supplying chamber 39 •between the outer circumference of the master piston 33 and the inner circumference of the cylinder body 31. The cup seal 37 separating the fluid pressure chamber 32 and the liquid supplying chamber 39 from each other allow the flow of the brake fluid from the liquid supplying chamber 39 into the liquid pressure chamber 32. A reservoir tank 4Ol is joined to an upper portion of the cylinder body 31. A releasing port 41 connected to the reserve tank 401 is formed in the cylinder body 31 so that the releasing port 41 opens into the liquid pressure •chamber 31 when the master piston 33 is retracted to the rearmost position. A supply port 42 connected to the reservoir tank 40: is formed in the cylinder body 31 so as to open into the liquid supply chamber 39 regardless of the position of the master piston 33.<br>
A bracket 3 la is formed in the rear end portion of the cylinder body 31, and the rear wheel brake operating lever 12X is supported at its base end portion for turning by a pin 43 on the bracket 3la. The rear wheel brake operating lever 121 has a projection 12a kept in contact with the rear end of the piston rod 34 so as to push the piston rod 34 of the rear wheel master cylinder 14L into the cylinder body 31 when the rear •wheel brake operating lever 121 is operated by the left hand<br>
gripping the handgrip 30.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, the rear wheel slave cylinder 16 has a cylinder body 44 having an end wall 44a at one end thereof and formed in the shape of a bottomed circular cylinder, a piston 45 axially slidably fitted in the cylinder body 44 so as to form a liquid pressure chamber 46 between the end wall 44a and the piston 45, a spring retainer 48 put in an open end of the cylinder body 44 and restrained from falling off the cylinder body 44 by a snap ring 47 put in place in a groove formed in the inner circumference of the end portion of the cylinder body 44, and a return spring 49 extended between the piston 45 and the spring retainer 48 so as to bias the piston 45 in a direction to reduce the volume of the liquid pressure chamber 46. A piston red 45a formed coaxially and integrally with the piston 45 extends axially slidably through the end wall 44a in a liquid-tight fashion and projects outside the cylinder 44. A spring chamber 50 formed between the piston 45 and the retainer 48 and containing the return spring 49 is open into the outside through a through hole 48a formed in the retainer 48.<br>
One end of a rod 52 supported axially movably on the fixed arm 25 of the rear wheel brake BR as shown in Fig. 1 is connected to the outer end of the piston rod 45a by a connecting<br>
member 51 and the other end of the rod 52 connected to the brake cam arm 24 of the rear wheel brake BR. A pressure line 53 for transmitting the output liquid pressure of the rear wheel master cylinder 14: is connected to the liquid pressure chamber 46 of the rear wheel slave cylinder 16. When the rear wheel brake operating lever I2l is operated so as to make the rear wheel master cylinder 141 provide a liquid pressure, the liquid pressure is applied to the liquid pressure chamber 46 of the rear wheel slave cylinder 16 to shift the piston rod 45a to the left as viewed in Fig. 3 according to the liquid pressure, so that the rear wheel brake BR is applied.<br>
The output liquid pressure of the rear wheel master cylinder 14j is applied through a liquid pressure line 54 connected to the rear wheel master cylinder 14i together with the liquid pressure line 53 to the front wheel slave cylinder 17. The front wheel master cylinder 13 that provides a liquid pressure according to the operation of the front wheel brake operating lever 11, and the front wheel slave cylinder 17 are disposed side by side with their axes in parallel to each other and joined together.<br>
Referring to Figs. 4 and 5, the front wheel master cylinder 13 has a cylinder body 55 fastened to the steering bar 28, and a master piston 57 axially slidably fitted in the cylinder body<br>
55 with its front end, i.e., the left end as viewed in Fig. 4, received in a liquid pressure chamber 56. A piston rod 58 extends rearward, i.e., to the right as viewed in Fig. 4, coaxially with and from the master piston 57. A return spring 59 is extended in the liquid pressure chamber 56 so as to bias the master piston 57 rearward. A limiting plate 60 determining the rearmost position of the master piston 57 is fastened to a rear end portion of the cylinder body 55.<br>
An annular liquid supplying chamber 63 is formed between the outer circumference of the master piston 57 and the inner circumference of the cylinder body 55 by a pair of cup seals 61 and 62 mounted on the master piston 57. The cup seal 61 separating the liquid supplying chamber 63 and the liquid pressure chamber 57 from each other allows the flow of the brake fluid from the liquid supplying chamber 63 into the liquid pressure chamber 56. A reservoir tank 64 is joined to an upper portion of the cylinder body 55. A release port 65 opening into the reservoir tank 64 is formed in the cylinder body 55 so as to open into the liquid pressure chamber 56 when the master piston 57 is retracted to its rearmost position. A supply port 66 connected to the reservoir tank 64 is formed in the cylinder body 55 so as to open into the liquid supplying chamber 63 regardless of the position of the piston 57 . A liquid pressure line 67 has one end connected to the liquid pressure chamber<br>
56 and the other end connected to the front wheel brake BF.<br>
The front wheel slave cylinder 17 has a cylindrical cylinder body 68 having a front end, i.e. , a left end as viewed in Fig. 4, to which the fluid pressure line 54 is connected, a piston 69 axially slidably fitted in the cylinder body 68 so that the output fluid pressure of the front wheel master cylinder 141 is applied through the liquid pressure line 54 to its front end, a piston rod 70 formed coaxially and integrally with the piston 69 so as to extend rearward from the rear end, i.e., the right end as viewed in Fig. 4, a disk 71 fixedly fitted in the cylinder body 68 so that the piston rod 70 extend axially slidably therethrough, and a characteristic setting spring 72 compressed between the disk 71 and the piston 69.<br>
The cylinder body 55 of the front wheel master cylinder 13 and the cylinder body 68 of the front wheel slave cylinder 17 are disposed with their axes in parallel to each other. A pair of connecting lugs 55a and 55b projecting from the cylinder body 55 toward the cylinder body 68, and a pair of connecting lugs 68a and 68b projecting from the cylinder body 68 toward the cylinder body 55 are fastened together with a pair of bolts 73, respectively.<br>
A boot 74 in elastic contact with a rear portion of the inner circumference of the cylinder body 55 of the front wheel master cylinder 13 is connected to the piston rod 58 of the front wheel master cylinder 13 so that the rear end of the piston rod 58 is exposed. A boot 75 in elastic contact with a rear portion of the inner circumference of the cylinder body 68 of the front wheel slave cylinder 17 is connected to the piston rod 70 of the front wheel slave cylinder 17 so that the rear end of the piston rod 70 is exposed.<br>
An interlocking member 76 of a substantially circular shape is disposed in a plane including the axes of the piston rods 58 and 70 with its opposite ends in contact with the rear ends of the piston rods 58 and 70, respectively. The interlocking member 76 is supported for turning at its middle portion on a support shaft 77 supporting the front wheel brake operating lever 11 at its base portion.<br>
A pair of brackets 80a and 80b are formed integrally with the cylinder 55 of the front master cylinder 13 at the rear end of the cylinder 55, and the support shat 77 is fixedly held on the brackets 80a and 80b, a cylindrical sleeve 78 is mounted on a portion of the support shaft 77 between the pair of brackets 80a and 80b, and the interlocking member 76 and the front wheel brake operating lever 11 are able to turn on<br>
the support shaft 77. A torsion spring 79 is disposed between the bracket 80a and the front brake operating lever 11 so as to bias the front wheel operating lever 11 toward its inoperative position.<br>
The interlocking member 76 is provided with a shoulder 76a with which the front brake operating lever 11 comes into contact with the same is operated to apply the front wheel brake BF. When the front wheel brake operating lever 11 is operated for a braking operation, the front wheel brake operating lever 11 comes into contact with the shoulder 76a to turn the interlocking member 76, so that the piston rod 58 of the front wheel master cylinder 13 is pushed according to the turning action of the interlocking member 76 . If the front wheel slave cylinder 17 is operated by the output liquid pressure of the rear wheel master cylinder 14j with the front wheel brake operating lever 11 positioned at the inoperative position, only the interlocking member 76 turns leaving the front wheel brake operating lever 11 at the inoperative position to push the piston rod 58 of the front wheel master cylinder 13.<br>
The operation of the first embodiment will be described hereinafter. If only the front wheel brake operating lever 11 is operated and the rear wheel brake operating lever 12 is kept at its inoperative position, the interlocking member 76<br>
is turned according to the braking operation of the front wheel brake operating lever 11 to push the piston 58 of the front wheel master cylinder 13, so that the front wheel master cylinder 13 applies an output liquid pressure through the liquid pressure line 67 to the front wheel brake BF. Thus, the front wheel brake BF is applied and only the front wheel braking force as indicated by line A-B in Fig. 6 is exerted.<br>
If only the rear wheel brake operating lever 12l is operated and the front brake operating lever 1 is kept at its inoperative position, the output liquid pressure provided by the rear wheel master cylinder 141 is applied through the liquid pressure line 53 to the rear wheel slave cylinder 16 to apply the rear wheel brake BR and, at the same time, the output liquid pressure of the rear wheel master cylinder 141 : is applied through the liquid pressure line 54 to the front wheel slave cylinder 17. However, the piston 69 of the front wheel slave cylinder 17 does not move until the output liquid pressure of the rear wheel master cylinder 141 applied to the piston 69 produces a force that overcomes the force applied to the piston 69 in the opposite direction by the characteristic setting spring 72, and only a rear wheel braking force indicated by line A-C in Fig. 6 is exerted.<br>
If the front wheel brake operating lever 11 is not<br>
operated and only the rear wheel brake operating lever 12: is operated to an extent that a liquid pressure applied by the rear wheel master cylinder 14V to the piston 69 produces a force that overcomes the force applied by the characteristic setting spring 72 to the piston 69 of the front wheel slave cylinder 17, he front wheel slave cylinder 17 is actuated to turn the interlocking member 76. Consequently, the front wheel master cylinder 13 applies an output liquid pressure through the liquid pressure line 67 to the front wheel brake BF and the front wheel brake BF exerts a braking force. Thus, both the rear wheel brake BR and the front wheel brake BF can be applied in an interlocked braking mode by operating only the rear wheel brake operating lever 121 Braking characteristic in the interlocked braking mode is indicated by line C-D in Fig. 6.<br>
Thus, the braking system operates in a braking mode indicated by line A-C-D in Fig. 6 which resembles an ideal braking mode when the front wheel brake operating lever 11 is kept at its inoperative position and only the rear wheel brake operating lever 12l is operated for braking operation. The point C in Fig. 6, i.e., the braking force L of the rear wheel brake BR when the rear wheel brake operating lever 12: is operated relatively lightly and the front wheel brake operating lever 11 is not operated to apply only the rear wheel brake BR, is dependent on the resilient force applied to the piston<br>
69 by the characteristic setting spring 72 and the braking characteristic of the brake system can easily be adjusted by selectively using an appropriate spring as the characteristic setting spring 72. If the front wheel brake BF is a disk brake, the gradient 6 (Fig. 6) of the braking characteristic curve in an interlocked braking mode an easily be determined.<br>
If both the front wheel brake operating lever 11 and the rear wheel brake operating lever 121 are operated for braking, respective braking forces of both the front brake BF and the rear brake BR are available, and the relation between the respective braking forces of the front brake BF and the rear brake BR varies in a shaded region shown in Fig. 6 according to forces applied to the front wheel brake operating lever 11 and the rear wheel brake operating lever 12lf respectively.<br>
Thus, the front brake BF and the rear brake BR are interlocked so that both the front brake BF and the rear brake BR can be applied by operating only the rear wheel brake operating lever 121 Since the output liquid pressure of the rear wheel master cylinder l4l is used for the interlocked operation of the front wheel brake BF, the degree of freedom of arrangement of the liquid pressure line 54 is large and the output liquid pressure of the rear wheel master cylinder 141 can efficiently be transmitted, whereas, in the conventional<br>
interlocking mechanism employing an interlocking cable, the brake operating force is transmitted at a low transmission efficiency because of frictional resistance against the movement of the interlocking cable and the arrangement of the interlocking cable needs to be determined at a limited degree of freedom of arrangement.<br>
Since the interlocking member 76 for transmitting the operating force of the front wheel slave cylinder 17 to the front wheel master cylinder 13, and the front wheel brake operating lever 11 for operating the front wheel master cylinder 13 are supported for turning on the same support shaft 77, the number of parts can be reduced.<br>
In a modification of the embodiment, the cylinder body 55 of the front wheel master cylinder 13 and the cylinder body 68 of the front wheel slave cylinder 17 may be formed integrally in a single piece, which contributes to the reduction of the number of parts.<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 7, in which parts like or corresponding to those of the first embodiment are designated by the same reference characters.<br>
An antilock braking control modulator 81 for regulating the respective output liquid pressures of a front wheel master cylinder 13 and a rear wheel master cylinder 141 so that regulated liquid pressures are applied to a front wheel brake BF and a rear wheel brake BR is disposed between the front wheel master cylinder 13 and the front wheel brake BF and between the rear wheel master cylinder 141 and the rear wheel slave cylinder 16. The antilock braking control modulator 81 is interposed between a section 67a connected to the front wheel master cylinder 13 and a section 67b connected to the front wheel brake BF of a liquid pressure line 67 , and between a section 53a connected to the rear wheel master cylinder 141 and a section 53b connected to the rear wheel slave cylinder 16 of a liquid pressure line 53. The antilock braking modulator 81 is of a known type controlled by a control unit 82 to regulate working liquid pressures to be applied to the front wheel brake BF and rear wheel slave cylinder 16.<br>
A detection signal provided by a sensor 85 for detecting the rotating speed of a sensor ring 84 mounted on a front axle 83, and a detection signal provided by a sensor 87 for detecting the rotating speed of a sensor ring 86 mounted on a rear axle 18 are given to the control unit 82 . The control unit 82 decides whether or not antilock braking control operation is necessary on the basis of those detection signals, and controls the<br>
operation of the antilock braking control modulator 81 according to a decision made on the basis of those detection signals .<br>
Since the second embodiment is provided with the known antilock braking control modulator 81 disposed between the front wheel master cylinder 13 and the front wheel brake BF and between the rear wheel master cylinder 141 and the rear wheel slave cylinder 16, the second embodiment is able to carry out an antilock braking control operation, which is difficult for the conventional interlocked braking mechanism employing an interlocking cable.<br>
A third embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 8, in which parts like or corresponding to those of the foregoing embodiments are designated by the same reference characters.<br>
A rear wheel master cylinder 142, to which a reservoir tank 402 is connected, provides a liquid pressure corresponding to the stroke of a brake pedal 122. The output liquid pressure of the rear wheel master cylinder 142 is exerted through a liquid line 53 on a rear wheel slave cylinder 17, and through a liquid pressure line 54 on a front wheel slave cylinder 17. A known proportional pressure reducing valve 88 is placed in one of<br><br>
the liquid pressure lines 53 and 54, for example, in the liquid pressure line 54.<br>
The third embodiment is capable of easily achieving a braking force distribution control operation in an interlocked braking mode, which has been difficult to achieve by the conventional interlocked braking mechanism employing an in-terlocking cable, by using the proportional pressure reducing valve 88.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in it preferred embodiments, the present invention is not limited in its practical application to the foregoing embodiments and many changes and variations may be made therein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as set forth in appended claims.<br>
For example, a hydraulic brake may be used as the rear wheel brake BR and the rear wheel slave cylinder 16 may be omitted.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
According to the inventions stated in claims 1 to 3, the other master cylinder is operated by the output liquid pressure of the specified master cylinder among the plurality<br>
of master cylinders. Therefore, the degree of freedom of path along which the force for interlocked braking operation is transmitted is greater than that of the conventional interlocked braking mechanism employing an interlocking cable, and the present invention is able to transmit the force for interlocked braking operation at an improved transmission efficiency.<br>
According to the invention stated in claim 4, the interlocked braking mechanism is capable of easily carrying out an antilock braking operation in the interlocked braking mode by using the known modulator.<br>
According to the invention stated in claim 5, the interlocked braking mechanism is capable of easily carrying out a braking force distribution control operation in the interlocked braking mode by using the known proportional pressure reducing valve.<br>
