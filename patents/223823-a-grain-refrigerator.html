				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a grain refrigerator, and more particularly, to a grain<br>
refrigerator in which an evaporator is installed in a grain storage space as well as in a wall of<br>
a grain storage part to keep the entire space where grains are stored, at a constant<br>
temperature.<br>
Background Art<br>
For the purpose of preserving grain for a long time by preventing spoilage of grain<br>
and occurrence of harmful insects, grain containers need to be maintained at a low<br>
temperature. Up to now, a variety of grain refrigerators have been researched and developed.<br>
Specifically, rice must be preserved at a low temperature in order for a long preservation and<br>
a protection from insects. By doing so, the flavor of rice also becomes good. For this<br>
reason, rice only refrigerators have been developed.<br>
In conventional grain refrigerators, an evaporator is installed in a wall. Therefore,<br>
among a grain receiving space, an area adjacent to the wall is at the lowest temperature and a<br>
central area apart from the wall is at relatively high temperature. Like general refrigerators,<br>
since air convection phenomenon inside a storage space is limited due to grain, it is very<br>
difficult to maintain an overall storage space to uniform temperature. In case of large-sized<br>
grain refrigerators used in place of business, such as a restaurant, the difficulty becomes<br>
greater.<br>
Additionally, in case of lowering the temperature for maintaining a central area of<br>
the grain refrigerator at a low temperature, dew condensation occurs at an area adjacent to<br>
the wall causing grain to be damaged.<br>
Recently, because people want to drink water of appropriate temperature, water<br>
purifiers and water cooler/heaters become the necessary household electric appliances.<br>
Additionally, in order to reduce an installation space, a combination equipment integrally<br>
constructed with both the grain refrigerator and the water cooler/heater tends to be developed.<br>
According to the grain refrigerators having a conventional water cooler/heater,<br>
however, a rice chest and a water cooler/heater are operated individually according to a<br>
refrigeration cycle having two kinds of refrigerant flows. Therefore, the: number of parts<br>
increases and a manufacturing cost rises due to a complex installation structure. Further, the<br>
conventional grain refrigerators have a problem in that malfunctions may occur frequently.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention has been made in an effort to solve the aforementioned<br>
problem, and accordingly an object of the present invention is to provide an evaporator<br>
installed in an inside of a grain storage space, particularly, in a center thereby keeping all<br>
grains stored in the grain storage space at a constant temperature.<br>

refrigerator to the cool water tank evaporator.<br>
Alternatively, the above grain refrigerator may further comprise a temperature<br>
controller for keeping the grain refrigerator at a constant temperature, wherein the circulation<br>
of the refrigerant is controlled by the temperature controller.<br>
Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a sectional view of a grain refrigerator according to the present invention<br>
and FIG. 2 is a perspective view of an evaporator and illustrates an installation of the<br>
evaporator.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 1 and 2, a grain refrigerator 200 includes a grain storage part 210<br>

receiving container 220, and evaporators 240, 220 and 260 installed in the grain storage pan<br>
210 of the receiving container 220.<br>
The heat radiation part 230 radiates heat of refrigerant, and is provided with a<br>
compressor 231 for compressing a refrigerant in a high temperature and a high pressure state,<br>
a blower 232 for inhaling air from an exterior and blowing the inhaled air, and a condenser<br>
233 for changing the refrigerant compressed by the compressor 231 to a low temperature and<br>
a low pressure refrigerant using the air blown by the blower 232.<br>
The auxiliary evaporator 221 according to a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention is directly connected with the evaporators 240, 250 and 260 to circulate the<br>
refrigerant.<br>
The grain storage part 210 formed inside the receiving container 220 is provided<br>
with the first evaporator 2S0 installed at a center portion, and the second and third<br>
evaporators 240 and 260 installed between walls of the receiving container 220. The size<br>
and number of the first to third evaporates 240, 250, 260 are design consideration matters<br>
determined by the size of the grain refrigerator 200.<br>
Also, the refrigerant moves from the auxiliary evaporator 221 to the evaporators 240,<br>
250, 260 and enters into the heat radiation part 230.<br>
Preferably, the evaporators 240,250 and 260 are made in various shapes. Also, the<br>
grain may be maintained at a low temperature by the evaporators 240, 250 and 260 without<br>
the auxiliary evaporator 221, and the number of the evaporators 240, 250 and 260 may be<br>
changed. FIG. 2 shows such an example.<br>
A cylindrical fixing rod 302 is vertically coupled to a bottom 301 of the receiving<br>
container 220 by bolts 303, 303', the evaporator 250 is installed in a spiral shape along an<br>
outer circumference of the fixing rod 302, and the evaporator 250 is fixedly supported to the<br>
fixing rod 302 by a fixing clip 304 so as not to be shaken.<br>
Thus, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, in case that only one evaporator is<br>
installed, the central evaporator 250 is preferably installed, thereby maintaining a uniform<br>
temperature throughout an entire space.<br>
FIG. 3 is a perspective view of an evaporator according to another embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, an evaporator 410 has a suitable structure when one evaporator<br>
is installed in the receiving container 220 to maintain a uniform temperature.<br>
The evaporator 410 has a multi-layer structure. Each layer has a plurality of bent<br>
portions on a horizontal plane so as to be distributed in a wide area of the receiving container<br>
220. End portions of the respective layers are continuous such that the refrigerant<br>
circulates. Also, the evaporator 410 is installed at a fixing body 401 fixed to the wall of the<br>
receiving container 220. The fixing body 401 is shaped in a plate, and connection pipes<br>
connecting the respective layers are fixed to the fixing body 401 by a fixing clip 402, thereby<br>
fixing the evaporator 401.<br>
FIG. 4 is a cut perspective view of a grain refrigerator according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, an evaporator 501 is not directly contacted with<br>
grains, and is installed inside an evaporator receiving part 502 such that a small amount of<br>
moisture contained in the grains is not condensed at the evaporator.<br>
The evaporator receiving part 502 is preferably formed of loess, and is closed or<br>
partially opened by a cylindrical tube capable of receiving the evaporator 501 therein. Also,<br>
the evaporator receiving part 502 is preferably formed with a furrow along a circumference<br>
thereof so as to radiate cool air of the evaporator 501 easily. Also, the evaporator 501 is<br>
preferably formed in a spiral shape such that the evaporator 501 is received in the evaporator<br>
receiving part 502.<br>
FIG. 5 is a partial cutaway perspective view of a grain refrigerator according to the<br>
present invention. The receiving container 220 is provided therein with a diaphragm 600<br>
having a through hole formed at a center portion thereof. An upper portion divided by the<br>
diaphragm 600 forms the grain storage part 210 and a lower portion forms an exhaust<br>
container 220 containing grains exhausted through the through hole of the diaphragm 600.<br>
The through hole of the diaphragm 600 is connected to a sealing part (not shown) opening or<br>
closing the through hole by an exhaust handle 221.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, when the exhaust handle 221 is pushed right, the through hole<br>
is opened so that the grains stored in the grain storage part 210 drop to the exhaust container<br>
222 installed below the through hole through the through hole. Also, at an upper center<br>
portion of the diaphragm 600, an evaporator and an evaporator receiving part 700 are<br>
installed. Below the exhaust container 222, a compressor 231 and a condenser 233 forming<br>
a cooling cycle along with the evaporator are installed.<br>
FIG. 6 is an assembly perspective view of FIG, 5, and FIG. 7 is a sectional view<br>
taken along a length direction of FIG. 5.<br>
The diaphragm 600 has a structure inclined toward the through hole 610 positioned<br>
at a center thereof such that the grains stored in the grain storage part 210 are exhausted to<br>
the lower portion through the through hole 610. The diaphragm' 600 has horizontal<br>
supporting bars 620, 630, 640 welded at four corners. The support bar 620 is installed<br>
between two diagonal corners, one end of the supporting bar 630 is coupled to a comer and<br>
the other end is coupled perpendicular to the supporting bar 620. Also, one end of the<br>
supporting bar 640 is coupled to the remaining corner, and the other end is coupled to the<br>
supporting bar 620. A vertical rod 701 is welded to a center of the supporting bar<br>
connecting the two comers in a vertical direction.<br>
The vertical rod 701 has lower end and upper end each having a screw thread of a<br>
predetermined length. A bottom part 710 of the receiving part is inserted onto the vertical<br>
rod 701 through a penetration hole formed at a center thereof at a mid portion of the vertical<br>
rod 701. The bottom part 710 has a protrusion jaw 711 formed in a circumferential<br>
direction between the central penetration hole and an outer circumference. If the bottom<br>
part 710 of the receiving part is inserted onto the vertical rod 701, a washer 704 and a nut<br>
702 are inserted onto the vertical rod 701 and then the bottom 710 is coupled to the vertical<br>
rod 701. A lower portion of the bottom part 710 is mounted on a connection part of the<br>
supporting bars 620 and 630 and a connection part of the supporting bars 620 and 640 so that<br>
the bottom part is firmly fixed.<br>
Also, a guide tube 705 is inserted onto the vertical rod 701 and is then installed<br>
inside the protrusion jaw 711 of the bottom part 710. A sponge tube 706 having an<br>
elasticity is inserted and installed on the guide tuba 705. The guide tube 705 fixes and<br>
supports the sponge tube 706 when a spiral part 732 of the evaporator is inserted along an<br>
outer circumference of the sponge tube 706. An outer tube 720 of the receiving part is<br>
inserted and installed onto an outer surface of the protrusion jaw 711 of the bottom part 710<br>
of the receiving part. At this time, the bottom part 710, the guide tube 705, the outer tube<br>
720, an upper tube 740 and an induction tube 744 to be described later, are preferably<br>
formed of a solid material that deformation is not caused, or a material radiating far-infrared<br>
radiation. Particularly, loess is more preferable because it can contain a certain amount of<br>
moisture, which may be generated in the cooling operation.<br>
An evaporator 707 is installed between the sponge tube 706 and the outer tube 702.<br>
The evaporator 707 includes a straight line part 731 shaped in a straight line from an upper<br>
end to a lower end, and a spiral part 732 directed toward the upper end from the lower end of<br>
the straight line part 731. The upper end of the straight line part 731 is connected with a<br>
capillary tube 733 such that a refrigerant is introduced into the straight line part 731 through<br>
the capillary tube 733. An upper tube 740 facing the top surface of the outer tube 720 is<br>
installed on the top surface of the outer tube 720. The upper tube 740 of the receiving part<br>
has an opened lower portion and a cylindrical side portion. The lower portion of the<br>
cylindrical tube faces the top surface of the outer tube 720 and has a predetermined sized<br>
through hole. The upper surface of the cylindrical tube is formed in a curved shape, and<br>
has a through hole into which the vertical rod 701 penetrates. The vertical rod 701 is<br>
inserted into the through hole of the upper tube 740, and the exhaust tube 734 and the<br>
capillary tube 733 connected to the upper end of the spiral part 732 are led out through a<br>
penetration hole 741 formed at a side portion of the upper tube 740. After the exhaust tube<br>
734 and the capillary tube 733 are led out, the washer 742 and the nut 743 are inserted onto<br>
the vertical rod and fixed. The exhaust tube 734 is connected with a connection pipe and<br>
then led out of the housing through an induction tube 744. The upper end of the vertical<br>
rod 701 is protruded from the upper surface of the upper tube 740 of the receiving part<br>
through the through hole of the upper tube 740 such that the nut 743 is exposed to an<br>
exterior. The exposed upper surface of the upper tube 740 is coved by a cap 745 such that<br>
the exposed nut 743 or the like is concealed. At this time, the cap 745 is adhered to the<br>
upper tube 740 by an adhesive.<br>
Meanwhile, in case where the outer tube 720 of the receiving part is directly in<br>
contact with the spiial part 732 of the evaporator, dew condensation phenomenon is<br>
generated inside and outside the outer tube 720. Hence, to prevent a contact between the<br>
outer tube 720 and the spiral part 732 and to prevent a shaking of the evaporator, a buffer<br>
material 750,751 such as sponge or styrofoam between the spiral part 732 and the outer tube.<br>
The evaporator constructed as above is simple in assembly and is strong. Although<br>
the evaporator receiving part proposed herein is vertically installed, it may be installed<br>
horizontally. Hence, it would be well understood to those skilled in the art that alteration<br>
on design can be made.<br>
FIG. 8 is a sectional view of a grain refrigerator according to the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the grain refrigerator is constructed in contact with a water<br>
cooler/heater 100 in parallel with each other.<br>
An inside of the water cooler/heater 100 is divided into three rooms by two<br>
diaphragms 170 and 180. The uppermost room has a water storage part 150 for storing<br>
water. In the mid room, a cool water tank 400 is installed on the diaphragm 107 and water<br>
of the water storage part 150 is introduced into the cool water tank 400. An evaporator 160<br>
is installed on an outer wall of the cool water tank 140.<br>
The lowermost room is provided with heat radiation devices. Hence, the<br>
diaphragm 170 is preferably formed of an adiabatic wall. A hot water tank 130 is installed<br>
below the diaphragm 170 such that hot water is supplied by a heater. The hot water tank<br>
130 is also supplied with water from the water storage tank 150. A compressor 110 is<br>
installed at a lower portion of the lowermost room, and a condenser 120 is installed on a<br>
sidewall of the lowermost room. In addition to the above-mentioned parts, various parts<br>
such as a capillary tube forming a cooling cycle exist, but their description will be omitted<br>
since it is general.<br>
In this embodiment, the grain refrigerator 200 is installed in contact with a sidewall<br>
of the water cooler/heater 100. The grain refrigerator 200 is constructed in a general rice<br>
box having an exhaust hole (not shown), and has a grain storage part 210 capable of storing<br>
grains in an internal space surrounded by a wall 270. A spiral evaporator 250 is fixed to the<br>
wall by a fixing member 280,280' in a space of the grain storage part 210 to operate or stop<br>
the compressor 110. The temperature controller 290 is directly attached on the evaporator<br>
250 to maintain the evaporator 250 at a constant temperature.<br>
Next, an operation of the grain refrigerator 200 installed in contact with the water<br>
cooler/heater will be described.<br>
A high temperature and high pressure refrigerant compressed in the compressor 110<br>
is liquefied through the condenser 120. The pressure of the refrigerant is reduced through<br>
the capillary tube. The pressure-reduced refrigerant is introduced into a lower portion of<br>
the evaporator 250 installed in the grain storage part 210, circulates and is then exhausted<br>
through an upper end of the evaporator 250. After that, the refrigerant circulates in the<br>
evaporator 160 installed in the cool water tank 140 of the water cooler/heater 100, and <br>
returns to the compressor 110 and is then compressed. At this time, since the temperature<br>
controller 290 controls the temperature of the compressor 110 by the temperature of the <br>
grain storage part 210 or the temperature of the evaporator 250, it is possible to maintain the <br>
grain storage part at a constant temperature.<br>
While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to<br>
preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various<br>
changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope<br>
of the invention as defined by the appended claims. The preferred embodiments should be<br>
considered in descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. Therefore, the scope<br>
of the invention is defined not by the detailed description of the invention but by the<br>
appended claims, and all differences within the scope will be construed as being included in<br>
the present invention.<br>
