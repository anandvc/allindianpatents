USE OF A COMBINATION COMPRISING L-CARNITINE OR ALKANOYL L-CARNITINE,<br>
LIPID<br>
SOLUBL BENZOQUINONE AND OMEGA-3-POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID FOR THE PREPARATION<br>
OF A DIETARY SUPPLEMENT OR MEDICAMENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF CORNEAL DISEASES<br>
The present invention relates to the use of L-carnitine and/or one or<br>
more alkanoyl L-carnitines in combination with a lipid-soluble benzoquinone<br>
and a polyunsaturated fatty acids, for the preparation of dietetic<br>
supplements and medicaments useful for the prevention and treatment of<br>
diseases of the cornea.<br>
The corneal epithelium is the outermost layer of the cornea, many<br>
diseases can damage this delicate structure and cause de-epithelialisation.<br>
The main causes of impairment of the epithelial structure of the cornea are<br>
dry eye syndrome, corneal abrasions and injuries, the mechanical action due<br>
to the application of contact lenses and refractive laser surgery.<br>
Other diseases of the cornea are associated with impairment of the<br>
normal transparency of the corneal surface, caused, for example, by damage<br>
in the aftermath of keratitis, particularly bacterial, viral or fungal keratitis;<br>
by damage resulting from trauma and refractive laser surgery; as well as<br>
degenerative or hereditary diseases such as chronic and acute keratocono.<br>
The tear film, which coats the corneal epithelium and is essential for<br>
the homeostasis of the eye surface, performs an important optical function,<br>
acting as a lubricant between the eyelids and the eyeball and as a vehicle for<br>
oxygen, guaranteeing the metabolism of the cells of the corneal epithelium; it<br>
also performs a flushing function, ensuring the removal of external agents.<br>
Also important is its function as a carrier for growth factors, neuropeptides,<br>
and   neuromodulators   that   regulate   the   activation,   proliferation   and<br><br>
WO 2007/006672	PCT/EP2006/063769<br>
differentiation of corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells. It also transports<br>
immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgE), complement factors (C3, C4, C5),<br>
metalloproteases (MMP-2, 4, 9), enzymes (lysozyme, lactoferrin) and immune<br>
system cells, thus performing a fundamental defensive function against<br>
infections.<br>
As mentioned above, there are diseases in which this homeostasis is<br>
impaired.<br>
Dry eye syndrome is characterised by a quantitative (hypolacrimation)<br>
and/or qualitative (dyslacrimation) impairment of the tear film of<br>
multifactorial origin which may or may not cause clinically significant<br>
damage to the eye surface. The prevalence of dry eye syndrome ranges from<br>
10 to 40% in the adult population and there is a highly significant<br>
correlation with age.<br>
In the United States the prevalence of mild-to-moderate dry eye<br>
syndrome is up to approximately 10 million people [Am. J. Ophthcdmol:,<br>
1997'; 124:723-728; Arch Ophthalmol, 2000; 118: 1264-1268).<br>
Various studies conducted in order to understand the mechanisms<br>
activated in this disease have shown that the tears of subjects affected by<br>
dry eye syndrome present: an increased evaporation rate, increased surface<br>
tension, reduced vitamin A concentration, increased osmolarity, reduced<br>
concentration of a number of proteins (lysozyme, lactoferrin), insufficient<br>
mucus production or qualitative changes in mucus production, with<br>
consequent inadequate reconstruction of the mucus layer, reductions in a<br>
number of growth factors (EGF, TGF-a, aFGF-bFGF, LG-F, HGF)<br>
(Contactologia,   1982;  4:  34-37),     changes  in  concentration  of inorganic<br><br>
WO 2007/006672	3	PCT/EP2006/063769<br>
elements, reduced androgens and dysregulation of T lymphocyte activity<br>
(Cornea, 2005; 24: 1-7).<br>
The clinical signs regarded as being most closely related to this<br>
pathological condition are reduced break-up time (BUT test) and Schirmer<br>
test results as are described in all textbooks for graduate students.<br>
(Pescosolido N.: Le alterazioni del film lacrimale. In Stendler P.: "il sistema<br>
lacrimale", Fabiano editore, Canelli (AT), 2000; pag. 237-330; hereinafter this<br>
reference will be referred to as Pescosolido 2000).<br>
The BUT test has to do with the mucin content of the tear film and, in<br>
the dry eye, yields only values below 5 seconds. The Schirmer test, on the<br>
other hand, has to do with the water content of the tear film and, in the dry<br>
eye, yields values below 5 millimetres in 5 minutes.<br>
The patient presents the following symptoms: foreign body sensation,<br>
burning, difficulty blinking, bruit on opening the eyelids, itching, eye fatigue,<br>
photophobia, blurred vision, and mucus extravasation at the inner canthi.<br>
The treatment of this syndrome is based on the use of the following:<br>
(1)	tear substitutes whose task is the regular moisturising of the<br>
cornea, but which do not exert any action on the basic causes of the<br>
disease and are endowed only with very short-lasting efficacy;<br>
(2)	inserts (plugs) in the lacrimal canaliculus;<br>
(3)	immunoregulators such as topical cyclosporin; topical steroids;<br>
anti-inflammatory agents  (rumexilone  and  loteprednol);  autologous<br>
serum (cytokine inhibitors);<br>
(4)	topical or systemic androgens;<br><br>
4<br>
WO 2007/006672	PCT/EP2006/063769<br>
(5)	mucus    (HETE    eicosanoid)    and    aqueous    (P2Y2    agonists)<br>
secretogenic substances;<br>
(6)	acquaporins and agents such as antibiotics and detergents for<br>
the treatment of blepharitis (Cornea, 2005; 24: 1-7).<br>
Also used is treatment with iodide iontophoresis owing to its scavenger<br>
activity as a reducing agent and electron donor (Adv. Clin. Path., 2000;<br>
4: 11-17; Br. J. Ophthalmol, 2005; 89: 40-44).<br>
Even these latter treatments, despite exerting an action which may be<br>
regarded as more relevant to treating the causes of the disease, have failed to<br>
yield the anticipated results.<br>
The normal transparency of the cornea can be impaired by the<br>
aftermath of numerous diseases that damage the delicate structure of the<br>
various constituent components. The disease conditions most commonly<br>
implicated are post-keratitis damage, particularly after herpetic keratitis,<br>
and damage occurring in the aftermath of trauma and laser refractive<br>
surgery. The minimum common denominator is the formation of corneal<br>
opacities (leucomas) that functionally jeopardise vision. The events involved<br>
in wound healing that occur in the corneal tissue after infection, injury and<br>
refractive ablative surgery are have a profound effect on the final<br>
morphological and refractive outcomes of the restitutio ad integrum process.<br>
The acute epithelial and stromal corneal lesions occurring immediately<br>
after injury and laser ablation are probably involved in the regulation of the<br>
subsequent corneal tissue repair events, and, among the latter, keratocyte<br>
apoptosis probably plays a major role (Cornea, 2000;19:S7-12). This event is<br>
responsible for the corneal repair process since keratocyte apoptosis is the<br><br>
WO 2007/006672	PCT/EP2006/063769<br>
prime mover of the reproliferative stimulus. The stroma keratocytes<br>
underlying the initial acellular stroma therefore represent the cell source<br>
that mediates the subsequent healing of the superficial stroma beneath the<br>
epithelium. As a result of the cellular repopulation, the activated keratocytes<br>
undergo myofibroblastic transformation (Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sei,<br>
1998;39:487-501), thus proving responsible for the production of collagen<br>
fibres and of basic substances involved in the restituito ad integrum process.<br>
This process, however, is not self-controlled and, in many cases, abnormal,<br>
excessive healing occurs followed by a greater production of collagen and an<br>
increase in lamellar disorganisation (Arch. Ophthalmol, 1990; 108: 665-675).<br>
These abnormalities are involved in the pathogenesis of the most feared<br>
complication of stromal regeneration after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK),<br>
namely, haze, with consequent impairment of the functional outcome. Haze<br>
is classified according to Heitzmann in 5 degrees on the basis of the visual<br>
impairment due to the reduced corneal transparency. Though the incidence<br>
of haze has been substantially reduced over recent years, as a result of the<br>
technological advances in the field of excimer lasers, it is still a fairly<br>
frequent complication even today and, in rare cases, would appear hard to<br>
reverse, even after months of cortisone therapy. In cases of persistent haze<br>
(more than 15-18 months) which fails to respond to medical therapy (an<br>
event that can occur with late-onset haze), the only feasible procedure is<br>
phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) with an excimer laser, a procedure used<br>
for the laser-assisted surgical removal of superficial stromal opacities.<br>
L-carnitine and alkanoyl L-carnitines are known compounds, whose<br>
preparation process is described in US patents 4439438 and 4254053.<br><br>
WO 2007/006672	PCT/EP2006/063769<br>
The polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 fatty acids) are known for<br>
their triglyceride-lowering effects and for their effects in raising the levels of<br>
high-density lipoproteins (HDL). These fatty acids can be obtained by<br>
synthesis or, preferably, from fish oil. In that case, it is possible to use<br>
various mixtures of omega-3 fatty acids depending on their characteristics.<br>
Preferably, the omega-3 fatty acids are the long-chain ones (from 20 to 22<br>
carbon atoms). The ones most preferred are 5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentanoic<br>
acid (EPA) and cis 0,13,16,19-docosahexanoic acid (DHA). In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the omega-3 fatty acid is cis 4,7,10,13,16,19-<br>
docosahexanoic acid (DHA), most preferably in a ratio of 1:1. These omega-3<br>
fatty acids can possibly be esterified or salified to pharmaceuticaUy<br>
acceptable derivatives, with alcohols or bases, respectively. The omega-3<br>
fatty acids, or their esters or salts, alone or in mixtures thereof, can be<br>
procured on the market, or can be prepared by known methods. The<br>
mixtures can be specifically formulated for the combination according to<br>
the invention.<br>
Coenzyme Q10 is now so well known in its human use that it requires<br>
no particular explanation and the substance is available on the market.<br>
Experts in the sector can refer to the patent documents filed by the present<br>
applicant, where this substance is amply described.<br>
Previous uses of carnitine in the ophthalmological field are already<br>
known.<br>
US Patent 5,037,851 describes the use of aceryl L-carnitine for the<br>
treatment of cataract.<br><br>
WO 2007/006672	PCT/EP2006/063769<br>
US 5,145,871 and US 5,432,199 describe the use of acetyl D-carnitine<br>
for the treatment of glaucoma.<br>
US 5,883,127 describes the use of acetyl L-carnitine for the treatment<br>
of maculopathy and macular degeneration.<br>
US patent 4,599,232 discloses a pharmaceutical composition<br>
containing L-carnitine or acetyl L-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 suitable for<br>
the therapeutic treatment of atherosclerotic disorders, myocardial and<br>
coronary insufficiency and pathological conditions deriving from tissue<br>
anoxia.<br>
Further uses of carnitine are also known.<br>
US 5,753,703 describes pharmaceutical composition comprising L-<br>
carnitine or an alkanoyl L-carnitine in combination with a polyunsaturated<br>
fatty acid of the omega-3 series for the prevention and the treatment of lipid<br>
metabolism disorders and cardiovascular disorders.<br>
In Drugs Exp Clin Res 1992; 18 (8) : 355-65 the use of L-carnitine in<br>
the cardiological field is described'.<br>
US 5,543,556 describes the use of acyl L-carnitine esters with gamma-<br>
hydroxybutyric acid for the inhibition of neuronal degeneration and in the<br>
treatment of coma.<br>
US 5,811,457 describes the use of propionyl L-carnitine for the<br>
treatment of chronic obliterating arteriopathy.<br>
As above mentioned the use of Coenzyme Q10 and one omega-3<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acid are already known.<br>
WO00/23069 describes a compositions containing as active<br>
ingredients Coenzyme Q10 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid for the<br><br>
WO 2007/006672	8	PCT/EP2006/063769<br>
prevention and/or treatment of inherited mitochondriopathies and among<br>
the numerous pathologies cited, chronic progressive external<br>
ophthalmoplegia syndrome and retinis pigmentosa are mentioned.<br>
None of the above-cited patents or publications describes or suggests<br>
the use of L-carnitine or of alkanoyl L-carnitine in combination with a lipid-<br>
soluble benzoquinone and a polyunsaturated fatty acids, for the preparation<br>
of a medicament for the treatment of diseases of the cornea.<br>
In the medical field there is still a strongly perceived need for the<br>
availability of therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of the above-<br>
mentioned comeal diseases.<br>
It has now been found that a combination composition comprising as<br>
active ingredients:<br>
(a)	L-carnitine and/or one or more alkanoyl L-carnitines, or their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts,<br>
(b)	a lipid soluble benzoquinone, and<br>
(c)	at least one omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid or an ester<br>
thereof; is useful for the preparation of a dietetic supplement or a<br>
medicament for the treatment of diseases of the cornea.<br>
One object of the present invention is the use of a combination<br>
composition comprising as active ingredients:<br>
(a) L-carnitine and/or of one or more alkanoyl L-carnitines selected<br>

DHA are  the  triglycerides and the  ethyl ester;  for preparing a dietetic<br>
supplement or a medicament for the treatment of corneal diseases in which<br>
said corneal disease is selected from the group comprising, de-epithelialising<br>
diseases,  dry eye syndrome;  infective keratitis; acid or alkaline caustic<br>
damages; corneal abrasions and/or injuries due to mechanical action or<br>
contact lenses; degenerative disease of the corneal stroma such as acute or<br>
chronic keratocono, stromal damages caused by refractive laser surgery; and<br>
dystrophic diseases:<br>

a medicament for the treatment of impairment of the transparency of the<br>
cornea, in which said impairment of the transparency is caused by various<br><br>
WO 2007/006672	PCT/EP2006/063769<br>
types of infective keratitis (viral, bacterial and fungal), or by injuries that<br>
damage the structure of the various components constituting the cornea,<br>
such as, for instance, injuries of a mechanical, post-surgical and post-laser-<br>
refractive surgery type (such as, for example, haze); hereditary or<br>
degenerative diseases such as chronic and acute keratoconus.<br>
What is meant by pharmaceutically acceptable salt of L-carnitine is<br>
any salt of the latter with an acid that does not give rise to toxic or side<br>
effects.<br>
These acids are well known to pharmacologists and to experts in<br>
pharmacy. Non-limiting examples of such salts are: chloride, bromide,<br>
orotate, aspartate, acid aspartate, acid citrate, magnesium citrate,<br>

fumarate, lactate, maleate and acid maleate, oxalate, acid oxalate, pamoate,<br>
acid pamoate, sulphate, acid sulphate, glucose phosphate, tartrate and acid<br>
tartrate, glycerophosphate, mucate, magnesium tartrate, 2-amino-<br>
ethanesulphonate,	magnesium	2-amino-	ethanesulphonate,<br>
methanesulphonate, choline tartrate, trichloroacetate, and trifluoroacetate.<br>
What is meant by pharmaceutically acceptable salt of L-carnitine is<br>
also a salt approved by the FDA and listed in the publication Int. J. of<br>
Pharm. 33 (1986), 201-217, which is incorporated herein by way of a<br>
reference.<br>
The combination according to the invention may additionally contain<br>
other useful elements, such as antioxidants such as, for example, vitamin E<br>
and/or vitamin C; coenzyme, mineral, without this substantially impairing<br>
the activity.<br><br>
WO 2007/006672	PCT/EP2006/063769<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A clinical trial was conducted in which 40 patients suffering from dry<br>
eye syndrome were recruited.<br>
The patients recruited were all women aged from 36 to 75 years, 30 of<br>
whom were suffering from Sjogren's syndrome, diagnosed on the basis of Fox<br>
et al.'s criteria (Arthritis Rheum, 1986; 29: 577-584; 1986).<br>
Patients were selected on the basis of the BUT test, the Schirmer test,<br>
the fluorescein test and the rose bengal test (Pescosolido 2000; Arch.<br>
Ophthalmol, 1969;82: 10-14).<br>
The BUT test had to yield results ≤ 5 seconds, while the Schirmer test<br>
did not contraindicate inclusion in the trial.<br>
 Damage to the surface of the eye was evaluated by means of the rose<br>
bengal staining test and the fluorescein test. Damage in the rose Bengal<br>
staining test was determined by reference to the van Bijsterveld evaluation<br>
(Arch. Ophthalmol, 1969;82: 10-14), dividing the exposed surface into 3<br>
zones, with a score of 0 to 3 per zone.<br>
For abnormality of the fluorescein test score both the affected surface<br>
(A) and the damage density (D) were evaluated, with a range from 0 to 3 (low<br>
and high) on the basis of severity (Jap. Clin. Ophthalmol; 1994; 48: 183-188).<br>
On the basis of the test score results, patients were divided into 3<br>
subgroups, namely, those with mild dry eye (A1D1, A1D2, A2D1), those with<br>
moderate dry eye (A1D3, A2D2, A3D1) and those with severe dry eye (A2D3,<br>
A3D2, A3D3).<br><br>
WO 2007/006672	PCT/EP2006/063769<br>
Patient were treated twice daily for 6 months with the combination<br>
composition according to the present invention having the following<br>
composition:<br>
acetyl L-carnitine mucate 100 mg, fish oil mg 500 (containing EPA 165<br>
mg and DHA 110 mg) and Coenzyme Q10 10 mg.<br>
The results obtained are reported in the following tables.<br>
TABLE 1/1<br><br>
In this clinical trial were enrolled 20 patients, 9 men and 11 women,<br>
ranging in age from 22 to 31 years, who had been submitted to refractive<br>
laser surgery (PRK) in both eyes with myopia not exceeding 6 diopters.<br><br>
WO 2007/006672	PCT/EP2006/063769<br>
Patients were divided in two groups 10 patients each (control and<br>
treated group respectively).<br>
Patients were treated twice daily with the combination composition<br>
according to the invention described in Example 1.<br>
The eyes of both groups (treated and control) were also treated with<br>
antibiotic eye-drops for 4 days, and a hydrogel contact lens was applied to<br>
both eyes after PRK for the first 5 days postoperatively.<br>
The efficacy of adequate re-epithelialisation after PRK was evaluated<br>
before the treatment and after 7 days, 1 and 6 months of treatment.<br>
Since the vision of an object or image cannot be limited to<br>
minimum separable perception (visual acuity), one important parameter<br>
evaluated was the contrast of the object. To study this parameter, the<br>
perception threshold was measured for a whole range of objects of<br>
various sizes with increasingly reduced contrasts. The resulting<br>
assessment was the spatial contrast sensitivity function (spatial CSF)<br>
(PescosoUdo 2001), For this function, test images were mainly used<br>
consisting of stripes with a sinusoidal luminance profile. These bars,<br>
alternating dark and light, were defined by their spatial frequency [cycles<br>
per degree (CPD) or number of pairs of stripes (black/white) per degree of<br>
visual angle] and by their contrast. The inverse of contrast (C) was<br>
contrast sensitivity (S) (S=l/C). Contrast is often expressed in terms of<br>
percentages, 98% being very high, and 3% very low (PescosoUdo 2001).<br>
The contrast sensitivity test was performed using the Optec 6500<br>
vision tester capable of receiving ETDRS and FACT test scores and<br>
software for the management and analysis of contrast sensitivity data.<br><br>

The system was capable of simulating the way in which the patient<br>
actually saw things. Moreover, it was capable of comparing patient<br>
simulations with standard representations. The examination was<br>
performed first after 7 days and then at 3 and 6 months postoperatively.<br>
Patients started treatment immediately after PRK.<br>
The results obtained are reported in Table 2.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
In this clinical trial were recruited 14 patients, who had been<br>
submitted to refractive laser surgery (PRK) in both eyes with myopia not<br>
exceeding 10 diopters (3-10 diopters).<br>
Patients were divided in two groups (7 patients each).<br>
Group 1 (7 patients) received postoperative standard treatment<br>
consisting of eye drops containing corticosteroids and antibiotics and ocular<br>
drops (artificial tears) containing hyaluronic acid.<br>
Group 2 (7 patients) received the same treatment of group 1 and the<br>
composition according to the present invention described in Example 1,<br>
twice daily.<br>
The treatment started 30 day before the refractive laser surgery and<br>
was continued for 6 months after the surgery.<br><br>
WO 2007/006672	PCT/EP2006/063769<br>
The following parameters were controlled at the beginning, and after 1<br>
and 6 months of treatment.<br>
(1)      irritation symptoms (by a questionnaire):<br>
Irritation symptoms were subdivided in 3 groups:<br>
(i)       dysestesia: foreign body sensation, dryness,   burning, difficulty<br>
blinking;<br>
(ii)      hyperestesia:  particular sensitivity to:  the air flow (wind, air<br>
conditioned, powder, smog, smoke); topical medications; eye fatigue<br>
and pain; frequent blinking; higher tear production; and photophobia;<br>
(iii) daily variation of the symptoms.<br>
(2)	inflammatory sign by slit-lamp examination:<br>
Two subgroup of inflammatory signs were also recorded:<br>
(i)	hyperemia and papillary hypertrophy of the conjunctiva,<br>
(ii) discharge (particulate matter in the tear film, plugged<br>
Meibomian glands, blurred vision improving with blinking due to mucus<br>
on the ocular surface, mucus thread at the inner canthus or in the<br>
lower fornix, difficulties of opening the eye upon waking).<br>
(3)	tear flow by modified Schirmer test (Cornea. 2003 May;22(4):285-7)<br>
and BUT test.<br>
(4)	daily frequency of treatment with artificial tear.<br>
(5)	corneal   sensitivity  with   Cochet-Bonnet   estesiometer      (Can   J<br>
Ophthalmol. 2004; Dec;39(7):767-71).<br>
For evaluation of irritation symptoms and inflammatory signs the<br>
following score system was applied:<br>
score 0= no;<br><br>
WO 2007/006672	PCT/EP2006/063769<br>
score 1= mild;<br>
score 2= medium;<br>
score 3= severe.<br>
The mean score of both eyes were considered.<br>
The results obtained are reported in the following tables.<br>
TABLE 3/1 Symptoms of irritation<br><br><br>
WO 2007/006672	PCT/EP2006/063769<br>
In the postoperative period the mean number of daily installation of<br>
tear substitutes was significantly lower in the treated group compared to<br>
controls (p

Corneal sensitivity dramatically decreased after laser surgery.<br>
However, the recovery was significantly enhanced in treated group compared<br>
to controls (p
The results obtained, above reported, show that the combination<br>
composition according to the present invention improves the regeneration of<br>
sensory nerves of the cornea after laser refractive surgery and subsequently<br>
improve postoperative dry eye symptoms.<br>
The acetyl L-carnitine, omega-3 fatty acids and coenzyme Q10 can be<br>
in any form suitable for oral administration in human subjects.<br>
On the basis of various factors such as the concentration of active<br>
ingredient and the subject condition, the composition according to the<br>
invention can be marketed as a health food supplement, nutritional<br>
supplement, or as a therapeutic product.<br><br>
The nutritional supplement according to the present invention can be<br>
prepared by mixing the active ingredient (acetyl L-carnitine, omega-3 fatty<br>
acids and coenzyme Q10) with excipients suitable for the formulation of<br>
compositions for oral administration.<br><br>
