				<td>Radiometry using an uncooled Microbolometer detector<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present embodiments relate to radiometry using an uncooled Microbolometer detector and more particularly but not exclusively to obtaining more accurate results from an uncooled Microbolometer so as to extend its useful range of applications into areas previously only feasible with the more power consuming and more complex vacuum packages. Infra-red (IR) detectors detect the IR radiation emitted from an object, and are used for non-contact measurement of temperatures in many industrial and medical applications. These applications include stress testing electronic components, measuring human temperature, surveillance systems including long range and nighttime surveillance systems, fire detection, and portable night vision equipment<br>
IR detectors generally operate by detecting the differences in the thermal radiance of various objects in a scene. The difference is converted into an electrical signal which is then processed and analyzed and/or displayed. Imaging radiometers, such as forward-looking IR (FLIR) cameras, utilize an array of IR sensors to provide a two-dimensional thermal image. The more simple detectors are typically used to provide an image, since a simple differential over the field of view provides an image which can be meaningful to the eye. However, generally more sophisticated equipment is required if the intention is to measure a temperature from the received radiation.<br>
In many cases the sensor array is a microbolometer array, Microbolometers are IR radiation detectors that are fabricated on a substrate material using integrated circuit fabrication techniques. Microbolometer detector arrays may be used to sense the incident radiation. Each microbolometer detector of an array absorbs incident radiation which leads to a corresponding change in its resistance due to its change in temperature. With each microbolometer functioning as a pixel, a two-dimensional<br><br>
WO 2005/015143<br><br>
PCT/IL2004/000714<br><br>
image or picture representation of the incident infrared radiation may be generated using a suitable array of the microbolometers.<br>
FLIR cameras have non-uniform responses to uniform incident infrared radiation. This is due to:<br>
a.	small variations in the detectors1 electrical and thermal<br>
properties as a result of the manufacturing process,<br>
b.	variation of the electromagnetic wave intensity as a<br>
function of emitting/absorbing angle,<br>
c.	optics vignetting,<br>
d.	optics change in temperature, etc<br>
These non-uniformities in the microbolometer response characteristics are generally corrected to produce an electrical signal with adequate signal-to-noise ratio for image processing and display.<br>
As is well known in the art, offset and gain information associated with each of the detectors is obtained by a calibration technique known as non-uniformity correction (NUC), in which the microbolometer array is subjected to several scenes of uniform radiation at different levels. During regular use a controlled shutter is closed to obscure the microbolometer array's field of view (FOV), so that all of the sensors view a uniform temperature scene. The response of each of the detectors is used to derive a corresponding offset value. The shutter is then opened, and normal imaging operation is resumed. The derived offsets are used to correct the response from each pixel in the array. Furthermore, in order to compensate for the optics and new temperature distributions within the internal camera parts the detector itself is stabilized in temperature so that its response is relatively stable. While the shutter blocks the detector's FOV, an additional correction of the microbolometer array response, known as bad pixel replacement (BPR) updating, may be performed. The signal from each detector pixel is checked to determine whether the detector pixel is functioning properly. If the detector pixel is found to be inoperative, or its signal properties drastically differ from the average properties, then the value of the corresponding pixel is determined by other means, such as taking an average of the<br><br>
WO 2005/015143<br><br>
PCT/IL2004/000714<br><br>
surrounding pixels. An alternative technique is to perform sorting instead of averaging.<br>
There are several main obstacles related to building an imaging radiometer, especially when the instrument is based on an uncooled microbolometer detector array. A simple uncooled microbolometer array detector does not contain any radiation shield. Thai is to say in the more sophisticated detectors there are radiation shields which protect the detector from IR radiation from internal camera parts. The simple detectors do not contain such a shield, making the package smaller and the optics simpler, but meaning that the simple detector exchanges energy with the internal camera parts and its vacuum package through a solid angle of 2n radians. Indeed it is noted that the detector always exchanges energy through a solid angle of 2% radians. However, conventional more sophisticated radiometric detectors block the detector field of view using the above mentioned radiation shields. Furthermore the radiation shields are kept at a constant temperature, which can therefore be compensated for relatively easily.  Returning to the simple detectors and in fact most of the energy exchanged is between the detector and the internal camera parts. After all, the internal camera parts are much nearer than the objects being imaged- Only a very small fraction (usually about 10%) of the energy exchanged by the detector comes from the scene it is intended to be imaging. A very small change in temperature of the internal camera parts therefore may produce a large change of the detector output signal. The average value and the very low frequency components of the video signal obtained from the microbolometer detector after the processes of NUC and BPR are greatly influenced by the temperature of the detector's vacuum package and internal camera parts.<br>
One set of solutions is the cryogenic cooled detectors arrays. Cooled detectors have the disadvantages of greater weight and complexity, as well as additional power consumption for cooling, shorter lifetimes and greater cost Advantages of cooled detectors are that they can work at shorter wavelengths, say the 3 to 5 micron band and thus produce images having greater resolution. FLIRs based on the cooled devices have good sensitivity even for relatively high f numbers (f#) and have a very short time constant<br><br>
WO 2005/015143<br><br>
PCT7IL2004/000714<br><br>
On the other hand, the uncooled thermal microbolometer array has other advantages. For example, uncooled devices have smaller physical size, lower weight and low power consumption.<br>
The uncooled devices give video output immediately after power on, have a long MTBF (mean time between failures) relative to the cooled devices, and are generally cheaper.<br>
Overall the cooled devices are used for long range applications and those in which the greater expense can be justified and the uncooled devices are used for medium and short range applications and those in which budgets are limited.<br>
A second solution to the above described problem is proposed in U.S. Patent No. 6,476,392 by Kaufman et al., which presents a temperature dependent focal plane array that operates without a temperature stabilization cooler and/or heater. Gain, offset, and/or bias correction tables are provided in a flash memory, in memory pages indexed by the measured temperature of the focal plane array. The gain, offset, and/or bias for each pixel are determined at each small temperature increment over the entire temperature operating range, for example by placing the array in a controlled oven and examining the array's response to a known temperature. The bias, gain, and offset data within the database are later read out, converted to analog form, and used by analog circuits to correct the focal plane array response. The data used for signal correction is determined only once, and then not under normal operating conditions. Kaufman et al. do not account for the variation in detector response over time, or due to other factors. Furthermore, Kaufman's patent deals with the detector response for the case that the detector does not have a fixed temperature stabilized working point In such a case, temperature measuring requires a complete new data set for each small temperature increment. Such an approach is impractical.<br>
An additional problem for imaging IR radiometers is that microbolometer detector arrays generally have a finite spatial response. Two black bodies that have the same temperature, but differ in size, or the same object at the same temperature but at different distances from the camera, produce different video signals at the detector output A direct translation of the differential video signal into temperature is relatively accurate only for large objects. More specifically, the translation of the<br><br>
WO 2005/015143<br><br>
PCT/IL2004/000714<br><br>
video signal into temperature is subject to an error introduced by the limited modulation transfer function (MTF) response for high spatial frequencies.<br>
There are currently available a large number of uncooled microbolometer FLIR (forward looking infra-red) cameras, covering a large number of applications. These cameras contain regular uncooled microbolometer sensors that do not contain any radiometric shield. Typically, these cameras come with a standard lens of 35mm or 50 mm focal length or other focal length optics. A problem is to find a way to upgrade these existing cameras in order to overcome the above-described drawbacks of the uncooled detector to allow them to gjve accurate temperature measurements under the restriction of very minor hardware modifications.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present embodiments are of a infra-red camera such as a FLIR camera with a detector or detection mechanism that uses an uncooled microbolometer array, has standard optics and does not include any radiation shield.  The embodiments allow such a camera to be used for temperature measurement The embodiments discount internal temperature and temperature effects by approximating a temperature change response function of the camera.  Regular optics means optics that do not reimage the input optics aperture on the radiation shield. To date such an arrangement does not exist for regular detectors.<br>
A general description of the design considerations, temperature drift model and the expected accuracy is presented. The embodiments enable temperature measurement at a relatively high accuracy for an uncooled microbolometer based FLIR, even if the detector is not a radiometric one, by using the NUC flag as an extremely low frequency chopper.<br>
The principles and operation of an infra-red detector and associated temperature correction mechanism according to the present embodiments may be better understood with reference to the drawings and accompanying descriptions.<br>
Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be<br><br>
WO 2005/015143<br><br>
PCT/IL2004/000714<br><br>
understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 1, which is a simplified block diagram illustrating an infra-red detector 14 (10 is the entire seeker including the optics the shutter and the detector). Seeker 10 comprises focusing optics 12 for gathering infra-red energy from an external scene. Typically the focusing optics comprises one or more lenses, one of which is controllably mounted to alter the focal length. The focusing optics are preferably optimized for the operating spectral frequency range of the application and detector and for the spatial resolution required.<br>
Located behind the optics 12 is an uncooled IR sensor 14 which is arranged to detect infra red energy from the focusing optics 12. There is no radiation shield around the sensor and therefore the IR radiation that impinges on the sensor is not only IR information from the scene arriving via the focusing optics but also includes energy from surrounding parts of the camera as well. Furthermore, as the surrounding parts of the camera are considerably closer than the IR sources in the scene, and the camera is uncooled, the energy exchanged between the detector and the camera internal parts is much larger than (he signal from the scene.  As mentioned in the background the energy exchanged between the detector and the camera internal parts including the optics tends to overwhelm the signal collected from the scenery in an uncooled detector by around ten to one.<br>
In between the optics and the sensor is an internal temperature reference unit 16. The reference unit comprises a shutter which is controllably mounted to periodically interpose itself between the focusing optics 12 and the uncooled sensor 14. Mounting 18 allows the shutter to move between a position in which it interposes between the optics and the sensor and a second position in which it does not interpose, and control is provided, typically via a computer controlled actuator so that the shutter can move between the two positions with a frequency which is high enough not to obscure the view.   More particularly, the shutter is moves sufficiently fast so as not to obscure the view for any significant time period. Furthermore the shutter stays in the closed position for a period of time that enables collection of at least a few frames. The period of time between one shutter image obscuring and the next one is usually<br><br>
WO 2005/015143	PCT/IL2004/000714<br>
set to a few minutes. This period of time has to be, and indeed is, much shorter than the camera thermal time constant The camera itself is sealed, and thus has a relatively long thermal time constant for temperature change, typically of the order of half an hour. The shutter can therefore take temperature measurements say once every few minutes and then make a calibration to cover the time until the next measurement can be carried out, by making a mathematical extrapolation from the current and previous measurements. That is to say the internal camera parts have a temperature, and that temperature fluctuates.Even in the case of the largest likely temperature fluctuations in the environment of the camera, the temperature changes within the camera are limited by a certain time constant so that as long as temperature measurements are made more frequently than this time constant the measurements remain valid.<br>
The mechanism allows the detector to carry out periodic calibration operations by taking a calibration temperature measurement over the temperature reference unit and at other points on the camera such as the detector and the internal body of the camera. That is to say the temperature of the shutter and other points is measured and used as input to a function to provide a time dependent offset which can then be applied to the detector signal to discount the influence of internal camera parts. Thus the modified detection signal can provide an accurate temperature measurement of an object being imaged.  The mechanism and the ability to extrapolate typically ensures that the internal temperature reference nnit needs to be in a position of periodic interposition relatively infrequently.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 2 and 3 which show uncooled microbolometer based sensors 20. with shutters 22. The optics are removed for simplicity. In Fig. 2 the shutter is in position to interpose between the optics and the sensor and in Fig. 3 the shutter is out of the way, exposing the sensor. The shutters and sensors are mounted within housing 24, and shutter 22 is attached to the housing via controllable mounting 26.<br>
The internal reference unit is made up of a shutter and the shutter is typically a flat sheet The sheet may be metallic or made of any other suitable material. The sheet is sized such that when interposed between the focusing optics and the uncooled<br><br>
WO 2005/015143<br><br>
PCT/IL2004/000714<br><br>
sensor array, it substantially obscures the external scene from the sensor but does not necessarily obscure internal structures of the detector. A typical size in relation to the rest of the detector is as shown in above referenced figures 2 and 3.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment the internal surface of the shutter has an emissivity which is as close as possible to 1 over the spectral frequency range used by the detector. That is to say it is provided with a surface coating to give it black body properties over the given spectral frequency range in which the microbolometer detector exchanges radiation energy.<br>
In such an embodiment the uncooled sensor itself may be configured to make the calibration temperature measurement by measuring radiation from the blade body surface of the shutter. That is to say the sensor simply images the shutter as it would a scene and converts the received image into a temperature. As the shutter is a black body thus having substantially no reflection, the temperature measured externally through radiation is the temperature of the shutter itself and not of surrounding features. The sensor is thus configured to obtain temperature measurements from a video signal of the internal reference unit<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 4, which is a simplified diagram showing a variation of the embodiment of Fig. 1, in which a temperature sensor 30 is placed on the shutter.<br>
The temperature sensor makes a contact type temperature measurement For a black body the internal temperature and its radiation temperature are the same, so that in this case, a contact type measurement of the black body indicates the shutter's temperature, An additional temperature sensor 32 may be placed on the housing.<br>
In an alternative embodiment the shutter has a reflectivity as close as possible to 1, within a spectral frequency range used by the detector. That is to say the internal surface of the shutter is a mirror.. Again, the uncooled sensor is configured to make the calibration temperature measurement by measuring radiation from the internal reference unit In this case, the radiation, being reflected, indicates the temperature of the uncooled sensor itself.  In the case of a reflecting shutter the reference temperature is the temperature at which the microbolometer is stabilized. If the<br><br>
WO 2005/015143<br><br>
PCT/IL2004/000714<br><br>
microbolometer detector is stabilized at 30 degrees Celsius for example the reference temperature is fixed and equal to 30 degrees Celsius.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig, 5, which is a simplified diagram showing a microbolometer 40. Microbolometers are widely used as IR sensors and can be made small and packed into arrays so that each microbolometer is a pixel on an array type image sensor.   The structure and workings of the microbolometer are well-known to the skilled person.<br>
The temperature measurements made at the uncooled sensor are subject to an error introduced by the camera's modulation transfer function. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the uncooled sensor is equipped to overcome the error by incorporating an inverse of the modulation transfer function of the respective FLIR camera. Fig. 6 illustrates such an inverse function for a 320 by 240 element array. The function is implemented as a higji pass filter.<br>
At the same time as the local temperature is being determined, the shutter is used to update the non-uniformity correction matrix for the uncooled sensor. That is to say, since the shutter is not in focus, all pixels imaging the shutter should obtain the same measurement Thus any variation between the pixels, after the non uniformity correction process, is due to the new temperature distribution on the internal surfaces of the vacuum package because the primary non uniformity response of the different detector's elements is corrected by a different and much more complex correction process. A matrix of variations between the pixels may be built up and subsequently used to correct the received image.<br>
During the same period of time that the reference pictures are acquired for the NUC updating process, the reference temperature is measured and associated with the average video signal named ASn. The video signal after NUC and BPR is used for the average calculation.<br>
Subsequently, when the shutter is in the non-obscuring position, the temperature at any point in the detector's field of view can be calculated from<br><br><br>

F(...) represents a general function that translates the detector video signal into temperature using different input variables such as the video signal, the average video signal measured during the NUC updating process, the emissivity, the ambient temperature etc.<br>
The same measuring process involving the sensor and the internal reference unit comprises imaging the shutter to enable bad pixel replacement Thus any pixel determined by the imaging process not to be working can be discounted and its signal be replaced, for example by an average of the surrounding pixels.<br>
In the following, a relatively detailed model for the energy exchanged between the microbolometer detector and the view, the optics, and the internal camera parts is given. A mathematical model that describes the detector signal versus target temperature is derived, that results in a polynomial model for temperature measurement The solution implemented for reducing the measured temperature drift, as outlined above, is also discussed and an accuracy obtained.<br>
Energy exchanged model<br>
The video signal at the microbolometer output is generated by the energy<br>

the internal camera parts depends on temperature distribution of the intemal camera parts. This distribution is not constant, due to the fact that the camera's thennal time constant is very long (about half an hour) and usually the environmental conditions are not stable for such long periods of time. A dynamic model based on the temperature distribution of internal camera parts is too complicated and beyond the capability to be implemented in the existing hardware. Therefore in the presently preferred embodiments the non-uniformity correction (NUC) update process is used in order to eliminate the influence of internal camera parts. The  flag (or shutter) inserted in front of the detector during the NUC update process is used as an extremely low-frequency chopper. The  flag's surface facing the detector may in one embodiment be treated and coated in order to behave as close as possible to an ideal Blackbody surface. Referring again to the embodiment of Fig. 5, a few very accurate thermistors (±0.025°C) may then be installed at the following locations: One thermistor 30 on the rear of the flag or shutter surface, One thermistor 34 on the external surface of the detector's vacuum package Two thermistors (only one shown) 32 are glued to the external optics metal case.<br>
Temperature measurement description<br>
Let us assume, just for simplicity, that the influence of the optics is negligible. (Later on we review this assumption). Since the NUC update process is periodically performed, we may assume that during Process tin, the average detector signal Asn * after NUC update and bad pixel replacement (BPR) have been performed - has been calculated. We also assume that during the same NUC updating Process number n, the temperatures of all the installed thermistors have been acquired.<br>
Tfn represents the temperature measured on the flag during the n NUC update process,<br>
Tdn represents the temperature measured on the external surface of the detector's vacuum package during the number n NUC update process,<br>
Tott represents the average temperature measured on the external optics case during the number n NUC update process.<br><br><br><br>

PCT/IL2004/000714<br><br>
F        represents the transform that translates the video signal<br>
to temperature.<br>
Equation 4 presents the general idea of using any chopper as a reference<br>
source. The chopper's video signal is subtracted from the video signal to be measured.<br>
In this way a differential measurement is performed.   The video value Sig — Asa is<br>
translated to temperature and the offset value Tfn\s finally added This general<br>
approach works very well in the case that As n and Tfn are almost constant between<br>
successive samples. However, as explained above this is not the case. The Error between the real object temperature and the reconstructed one by the first approximation formula, was plotted versus the temperature measured on the external surface of detector's vacuum package (Td) during a period of more than 10 minutes. The results are shown in Fig. 11, which is a plot of temperature error versus vacuum package thermistor temperature. The plot described in Fig. 11 shows typical behavior. Fig. 12 describes the minimum mean square error linear fit to the Error value. However, the slope of the linear best fit is not constant in time. A high slope value means that the camera is far from thermal steady state situation and a very low slope means that the camera is in thermal equilibrium.<br>
Each time the NUC update procedure is performed, the error of the measured<br>
temperature Tjnes caused by the internal camera temperature fluctuations is<br>
eliminated. The typical behavior described in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 suggests that by<br>
adding an additional term to the first approximation (	Equation 4) a better<br>
solution can be obtained<br><br>
where Tdn represents the temperature measured on the external surface of the detector's surrounding vacuum package during the n NUC update process. The general idea expressed in Equation 5 cannot be directly implemented. An approximation of this idea was implemented using the values Asn,Tfn   and Tdn producing Equation 6:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Examples<br>
An implementation of the above-described embodiments was constructed to provide an instrument designed to detect human beings suffering from fever. The instrument monitors the face temperature and any area in the image which is above a predetermined temperature threshold is made to flicker. For such an application the instrument only needs to cover a relatively very small temperature range. A range of 30 to 42 degrees Celsius is more than adequate and can be covered with an accuracy of ±0.25 degrees Celsius. Such an embodiment has applications for use in airports as a convenient and non-invasive detector for screening for carriers of SARS and like infective illnesses.<br>
The basic concept of temperature measurement using a regular uncooled microbolometer detector is thus provided. The additional hardware required for the temperature measurement capability is limited and inexpensive, thus allowing existing devices to be easily upgraded. It is reasonable to expect that the capability to measure internal temperature and thus to provide the necessary compensation will expand the applications span of the regular uncooled microbolometer FLIR cameras.<br>
It is expected that during the life of this patent many relevant microbolometers and other infra-red detection pixels and arrays will be developed and the scope of the corresponding terms is intended to include all such new technologies a priori.<br>

Although the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims.
