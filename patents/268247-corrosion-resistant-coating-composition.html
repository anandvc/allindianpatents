				<td>SPECIFICATION Title: Corrosion-Resistant Coating Composition Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a chrome-free coating composition showing excellent corrosion resistance and a coated metal sheet by use of the coating composition, particularly to a coating composition effective on improving corrosion resistance of not only non-fabricated flat portion but also fabricated portion and edge face in the coated metal sheet even after degradation of the coating film made progress due to photodegradation and hydrolysis in outdoor environment and a coated metal sheet by use of the coating composition. Background of the Art:<br>
A precoated metal sheet such as a precoated steel sheet coated by coil coating has widely been used in the art as housing-related goods, for example, building materials such as roofs, walls, shutters, garage and the like for an architectural structure, various kinds of household appliances, panel boards, refrigerator showcase, steel furniture, kitchen fitments, etc.<br>
The housing-related goods are usually prepared from the precoated metal sheet, for example, by a process which comprises cutting a precoated steel sheet, followed by subjecting to fabrication such as press molding and joining. Consequently, the housing-related goods often have a metal-exposed portion as a cut surface and a crack-developed<br>
portion due to press molding. Corrosion resistance of the metal-exposed portion and the crack-developed portion may be reduced compared with other portions. For the purpose of improving corrosion resistance, a primer coating film on the precoated steel sheet generally contains a chrome-based anticorrosion pigment.<br>
However, the chrome-based anticorrosion pigment may contain or produce a hexavalent chrome showing excellent corrosion resistance, resulting in providing problems from the standpoints of health of human body and environmental protection.<br>
Various kinds of chrome-free anticorrosion pigments such as zinc phosphate, aluminum tripolyphosphate, zinc molybdate and the like have been commercially available, and various kinds of primers containing combinations of chrome-free pigments have been proposed. For example, Patent Reference 1 discloses a coating composition prepared by adding an anticorrosion pigment mixture consisting of a combination of calcium silicate and phosphorus vanadate, or an anticorrosion pigment mixture consisting of a combination of calcium carbonate, calcium silicate, aluminum phosphate and phosphorus vanadate to a vehicle component consisting of epoxy resin and phenol resin. Further, Patent Reference 2 discloses a coating composition prepared by adding an anticorrosion pigment mixture consisting of a combination of dibasic magnesium phosphate and a calcined product of manganese oxide vanadium oxide, or consisting of a calcined<br>
product of calcium phosphate and vanadium oxide to a polyester resin. However, a coating film formed from the coating compositions disclosed in Patent References 1 and 2 shows poor corrosion resistance, particularly unsatisfactory corrosion resistance in the fabricated portion and edge face portion compared with a coating composition prepared by use of a chrome based pigment, and further often shows poor chemical resistance such as alkali resistance and acid resistance and poor water resistance when a large amount of the anticorrosion pigment mixture is used. Accordingly, the anticorrosion pigment mixture disclosed in Patent References 1 and 2 is unsatisfactory to be replaced for the chrome based anticorrosion pigment in the preparation of the precoated metal sheet.<br>
Patent Reference 3 discloses a coating composition prepared by adding, to a vehicle component containing an organic resin having hydroxyl or epoxy group, and a curing agent, a silica fine particle having an oil absorption of 30 to 200 ml/100 g and a pore volume of 0.05 to 1.2 ml/g and forming a cured coating film having a glass transition temperature in the range of 40 to 125°C. However, a coating film formed from the coating composition disclosed in Patent Reference 3 shows some corrosion resistance, but shows poor corrosion resistance and poor chemical resistance, particularly unsatisfactory corrosion resistance in the edge face portion compared with a coating composition prepared by use of a chrome based pigment.<br>
Further, Patent Reference 4 discloses a corrosion-resistant coating composition containing (A) a hydroxyl group-containing coating film-forming resin, (B) a crosslinking agent, and (C) an anticorrosion pigment mixture consisting of a specified vanadium compound, a silica particle and a phosphate-based metal salt selected from phosphate-based calcium salt, phosphate-based zinc salt, phosphate-based aluminum salt, phosphate-based magnesium salt, etc., and showing good corrosion resistance.<br>
However, the above coating composition is unsatisfactory in resistance to corrosion reaction after degradation of topcoat coating film due to outdoor exposure, that is, in durability of corrosion resistance, further improvements in corrosion resistance being demanded. Patent Reference 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 61001/99.<br>
Patent Reference 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 199078/00.<br>

Effect of the Invention;<br>
The coating composition of the present invention provides such particular effects that the coating composition of the present invention does not contain a chrome-based anticorrosion pigment and is advantageous from the standpoints of environment and health, that the coating composition of the present invention can form a coating film showing excellent corrosion resistance in a fabricated portion and an edge face portion in addition to other non-fabricated flat portion when used in the coated metal sheet, being difficult to provide by a chrome-free anticorrosive coating composition, and that the phosphate or phosphate salt group-containing resin (D) contained in the coating composition of the present invention function as a strong adhesion-imparting component, and has excellent adhesion-imparting properties in acid-environment, resulting in improvements in corrosion resistance with time in outdoor environment in combination with the specified vanadium compound and ion-exchange silica as the anticorrosion pigment<br>

The coating film formed by coating the coating composition of the present invention onto a metal sheet shows excellent corrosion resistance.<br>
This is firstly because a direct formation of a precipitating salt in place of a redox reaction between a metal ion formed by dissolution of a substrate metal due to chloride ion or the like under corrosion environment and pentavalent vanadium ion, i.e., vanadate ion such as VO3- or<br>
VO43-, and an effective formation of a precipitating salt or compound due to a combination of cation and silicate ion. emitted by hydrolysis of the ion-exchange silica in corrosion environment with trivalent vanadium ion formed by redox reaction of pentavalent vanadium ion with the substrate metal ion and the substrate metal ion, results in that exposed surface of a substrate may effectively coated.<br>
This is secondly because the ion-exchange silica strongly functions to control pH of a wet environment near corrosion environment at a weakly acidic value due to effect of weakly acidic functional group on its surface in addition to effect due to cation emitted in corrosion environment and promotes redox reaction between pentavalent vanadium ion and the substrate metal, and further the ion-exchange silica is fixed in the coating film and keeps pH-controlling power for progressive corrosion under corrosion environment over a long term, and keeps taking place hydrolysis sacrificially, emitting silicate ion under stronger progressive corrosion environment.<br>
This is thirdly because in the case of a coated steel sheet, although a topcoat coating film may become hydrophilic due to degradation and various kinds of corrosion-promoting materials may penetrate from non-fabricated flat portion of the topcoat coating film, phosphate or phosphate salt group-containing resin (D) functions as a strong adhesion-imparting component in acid environment and has a function to inhibit peeling of the coating film in anode near the corrosion-<br>
progressive portion, and can effectively neutralize hydroxyl group generated by reduction reaction of oxygen in cathode and can keep the resulting pH near neutrality.<br>
The phosphate group and phosphate salt group of phosphate or phosphate salt group-containing resin (D) may provide an effect to keep pH of environment at weakly acidic value.<br>
Combinations of the above various functions may accomplish excellent corrosion resisitance.<br>
Combined use of vanadium compound (1) and ion-exchange silica (2) constituting anticorrosion pigment mixture (C), and phosphate or phosphate salt group-containing resin (D) makes it possible to effectively conquer respective poor properties in acid resistance, alkali resistance and water resistance of vanadium compound (1), ion-exchange silica (2) and phosphate or phosphate salt group-containing resin (D). Synergistic effects of respective functions of the anticorrosion pigment mixture (C) and phosphate or phosphate salt group-containing resin (D) result excellent corrosion resistance.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a coating composition effective on improving corrosion resistance of not only non-fabricated flat portion but also fabricated portion and edge face in the coated metal sheet even after degradation of the coating film made progress due to photodegradation and hydrolysis in outdoor environment by function of phosphate or phosphate salt group-containing<br>
resin (D) to inhibit peeling of the coating film in an anode near the corrosion-progressive protion along with function as a strong adhesion-imparting component in acid-environment, in addition to by function of the anticorrosion pigment mixture (C) component consisting of vanadium compound (1) and ion-exchange silica (2) to effectively coat an exposed surface of a substrate, and a coated metal sheet by use of the coating composition. Coated Metal Sheet<br>
The coated metal sheet of the present invention has a coating film formed by coating the coating composition of the present inventxon onto a metal sheet as a substrate, followed by curing.<br>
The metal sheet as the substrate may include cold-rolled steel sheet, hot dipped galvanized steel sheet, electroplated galvanized steel sheet, iron-zinc alloy plated steel sheet (galvanneal steel sheet), aluminum-zinc alloy plated steel sheet ("galvalume steel sheet" containing about 55% of aluminum in the alloy, "galfan" containing about 5% of aluminum in the alloy, etc.), nickel-zinc alloy plated steel sheet, stainless steel sheet, aluminum sheet, copper sheet, copper plated steel sheet, tin plated steel sheet, etc. These metal sheet may optionally be subjected to conventional metal surface treating process, for example, the phosphating process such as zinc phosphate-treating process, iron phosphate-treating process and the like, composite oxide film-treating process, chrome phosphate-treating process,<br>
chromating process, etc.<br>
The coating composition of the present invention may be coated onto the metal sheet by the conventional coating method such as roll coating method, curtain flow coating method, spray coating method, brushing method, dip coating method and the like. A film thickness of the coating film formed from the composition of the present invention may not particularly be limited, but is usually in the range of 2 to 10 urn, preferably 3 to 6 urn. Drying of the coating film may be carried out under suitable conditions depending on kind of the resin to be used, but in the case where a coating film formed by the coil coating method is continuously heat cured, the heat curing may be carried out, usually at a substrate maximum temperature of 160 to 250°C, preferably 180 to 230°C for 15 to 60 seconds. Heat curing in the batch-wise process may be carried out, usually at a surrounding temperature of 80 to 200°C for 10 to 30 minutes.<br>
In the case where heating is unnecessary in the crosslinking reaction on forming a coating film, for example, in the case where a non-blocked polyisocyanate compound is used as the crosslinking agent (B), or in the case where a bisphenol type epoxy resin is used as the resin (A) and an amine compound is used as the crosslinking agent (B), drying may be carried out at room temperature to be cured according to the conventional process.<br>
The coated metal sheet of the present invention may include ones having the coating film only formed from the<br>
coating composition of the present invention on an optionally surface treated metal sheet, but may also include ones having a topcoating film on the above coating film. The topcoating film has a film thickness in the range of 8 to 30 urn, preferably 10 to 25 urn.<br>
A topcoating composition forming the topcoating film may include conventionally available ones for use in the precoat metal sheet, for example, polyester resin based, alkyd resin based, silicone-modified polyester resin based, silicone-modified acrylic resin based, fluorocarbon resin based topcoating compositions. In the case where fabrication properties are of a great importance, use of a topcoating composition having good fabrication properties such as a polyester resin based topcoating composition for use in high fabrication makes it possible to obtain a coated metal plate having particularly good fabrication properties. The coated metal sheet having the above topcoating film in the present invention shows good film performances in corrosion resistance.<br>
In the case where the galvanized steel sheet and aluminum-zinc alloy plated steel sheet, corrosion resistance in a non-fabricated flat portion has been improved to some extent, but corrosion resistance in a cut edge surface portion and fabricated portion have been unsatisfactory in the art. In contrast, coating of the coating composition of the present invention makes it possible to obtain excellent corrosion resistance in edge surface portion and fabricated<br>
portion.<br>
A coating film from the coating composition of the present invention may be formed on a double-side of the substrate, and optionally the topcoating film may be formed on the coating film from the coating composition of the present invention.  Forming the coating film from the coating composition of the present invention on the double-side including the back side of the substrate makes it possible to obtain a coated metal sheet free of a chrome-based anticorrosion pigment and advantageous from the standpoints of environmental protection and health and showing excellent corrosion resistance.
