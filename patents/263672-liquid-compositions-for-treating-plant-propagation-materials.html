				<td>Liquid Compositions for Treating Plant Propagation Materials<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates to liquid compositions and methods for treating plant propagation materials to protect against pest infestation in useful crops. More specifically, the present invention relates to methods for protecting crops against insects and fungi comprising applying to the plant propagation material an effective amount of a fast-drying liquid composition. The present invention further relates to plant propagation materials treated by said liquid compositions and to methods for promoting suberization in cut plant propagation materials. The present invention also relates to methods for speeding the drying time of plant propagation materials treated by liquid compositions.<br>
[0002] Seed treatments are used on a large variety of crops to control many types of pests. Seed treatments are commonly used to ensure uniform stand establishment by protecting against soil borne diseases and insects. Systemic seed treatments may provide an alternative to traditional broadcast sprays of foliar fungicides or insecticides for certain early season airborne diseases and insects. [0003] Many seed treatment materials are availabje.for on-farm use. Some are known as hopper-box or planter-box treatments wherein liquid or dry formulations are applied to seed as it passes through an auger from the transport bin or truck to the planter boxes. These formulations are a very convenient way to apply seed treatment onto bulk seed right before planting. However, some seeds are treated and stored for later planting. Conventional dry treatments generally are formulated with talc or graphite which adhere the treatment chemical to the seed. Liquid seed treatments are less common due to the development of moisture-related problems such as fungal growth during storage. Good seed coverage is required for maximum benefit from any seed treatment formulation.<br>
[0004] However, obtaining thorough seed coverage can be difficult when attempting to treat seed. For example, dry formulations can present unacceptable worker exposure to the fungicidal and insecticidal active ingredients. In addition to the increased risk of inhalation of dry formulations, it is often.necessary to use larger quantities of dry formulations to achieve adequate seed coverage. Certain liquid formulations can become inhomogeneous on storage, such that particle sizes or viscosity do not remain constant. Additional problems can arise such as unacceptable drying times, material build-up in the seed treater, low seed flowability, poor seed coverage and dust-off of the active ingredients from the seed prior to planting. As a<br><br>
result, handling is rendered difficult and the biological efficacy of the seed treatment is reduced.<br>
[0005] These problems are especially prominent in certain types of seeds. For example, tubers and bulbs, which may be planted whole or cut, require special care during seed treatment. In the case of tubers, such as potatoes, the cut portions of the potato seedling are especially vulnerable to bacterial and fungal infections because of the exposed surface of the potato. Potato tubers are easily skinned, nicked, and bruised during handling operations, causing seed damage which may affect plant growth.  Because of this vulnerability, dust formulations are usually preferable for cut seed as liquid dip treatments may inhibit wound healing or suberization. Additionally, liquid treatments do not dry quickly enough to prevent fungal growth and bacterial spread during the time between cutting and planting. |0006] There is a need in the art for alternative new liquid pesticidal compositions that dry quickly and are especially effective for use with cut seeds and other vulnerable plant propagation materials. More particularly, there is a need in the art for new liquid pesticidal treatments which promote wound healing or suberization on treated plant propagation materials.<br>
[0007] The present invention includes a fast-drying liquid composition for treating plant propagation materials, especially cut seeds, including tubers, against pests and promoting suberization. More particularly, the present invention includes a fast-drying liquid formulation comprising at least one fungicide and at least one insecticide.<br>

In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a fast-drying liquid composition comprising water, at least one fungicide, and at least one insecticide in combination with a blend of a drying agent, a wetting agent, a dispersing agent, a suberization agent, and optionally, an antifreeze agent and a solvent. The fast-drying liquid composition provides protection to the treated plant propagation material and dries within 90 minutes of application. The present invention also relates to a method for treating plant propagation material, including seeds, comprising applying the fast-drying liquid composition. [0009] The present invention further relates to a method for preventing pest infestation in useful crops comprising treating plant propagation material, including seeds, with a pesticidally effective amount of a fast-drying liquid composition<br>

least one insecticide in combination with a blend of a drying agent, a wetting agent, a<br>
dispersing agent, a suberization agent, and optionally, an antifreeze agent and a<br>
solvent.<br>
[00013]	The present invention further relates to a method for selectively<br>
loading a liquid pesticide onto the skin side of a cut tuber, the method comprising<br>
treating the cut tuber with a fast-drying liquid composition comprising water, at least<br>
one fungicide, and at least one insecticide in combination with a blend of a drying<br>
agent, a wetting agent, a dispersing agent, a suberization agent, and optionally, an<br>

[00068]	The term "plant propagation material" is used herein to refer to all the<br>
generative parts of the plant that can be used for the multiplication of the vegetative plant material such as cuttings and tubers (for example potatoes). There may be mentioned, for example and not for limitation, the seeds (in the strict sense), roots, fruits, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, and parts of plants. Germinated plants and young plants, which are to be transplanted after germination or after emergence from the soil, may also be mentioned. These young plants may be coated before transplantation by a total or partial treatment by immersion or the like. In a specific embodiment, the method of the present invention has particular application for coating the plant propagation material of cultivated plants. Such plants are those plants that are cultivated by man, or from which is harvested parts or products that are used by man. Suitable cultivated plant propagation material includes, but is not<br>
limited to, seed selected from monocotyledonous, dicotyledonous, and multicotyledonous (gymnosperm) plants.<br>
[00069]	Specifically, plant propagation material includes seeds and cuttings<br>
and other generative parts of plants including tubers (such as but not limited to potatoes, Jerusalam artichokes and yams), bulbs (such as but not limited to onion, hyacinth, squill, amaryllis, snowdrop, tulip, daffodil, narcissis, lily and orchid), root vegetables (such as but not limited to carrots, beets, arrowhead, arrowroot, cassavas, Chinese artichoke, globe artichoke, horseradish, parsnips, radishes, and the like), trees, shrubs, and other ornamentals, including roses.<br>
[00070]	The liquid composition of the present invention may be used in a<br>
method for preventing pests, including fungi and insects, in cut seeds and propagation materials. For example and not for limitation, some planting regions cut seedling potatoes prior to planting, exposing the inner flesh of the seedling to the elements. Such exposure increases the risk of infection by fungi, bacteria, insects and other pests. The liquid composition of the present invention provides a barrier against these elements, preventing contamination of the seedling, thus resulting in reduced decay of the plant propagation materials.<br>
[00071]	The fast-drying liquid compositions of the present invention are<br>
exemplified by the following non-limiting examples.<br>

[00078]	The liquid compositions of the present invention are fast-drying<br>
compared to other liquid treatments for plant propagation materials. The compositions of the present invention dry in periods between about 30 minutes and 200 minutes. Preferably, the liquid compositions of the present invention dry after application in periods between about 60 minutes to about 180 minutes. More preferably, the post-application drying time of the liquid compositions of the present invention is between about 75 minutes to about 90 minutes. [00079]         The following non-limiting examples demonstrate the decreased drying time of the liquid compositions of the present invention.<br>
Example 3—Drying Time<br>
[00080]	Drying times of the liquid compositions of the present invention were<br>
compared to existing liquid treatments for plant propagation materials. Specifically, compositions of the present invention were compared to (a) a liquid formulation of fludioxonil (Maxim® 4FS) and (b) a powder formulation of fludioxonil in combination with mancozeb (Maxim® MZ).<br>
[00081]	Potato tubers of approximately 5 cm3 were treated with liquid<br>
compositions of the present invention and with fludioxonil formulations known in the art (Maxim® 4FS and Maxim® MZ). Using a recommended application rate/100kg tubers and adjusting to constant total volume for all treatments (0.626g slurry/0.5kg tubers), the liquid composition was added to a treatment bag, the cut potato tubers were added, and the bag was shaken for about 15 seconds. The tubers were then removed and allowed to dry at ambient temperature. The results are provided below.<br>

[00083]	The following non-limiting examples demonstrate the reduction in<br>
decay of three different types of potato seedlings.<br>
Example 4—Fungal Decay<br>
[00084]	Using the formulation described above in Example 1, labelled A14382,<br>
different types of cut potato seedlings were treated and tested for Fusarium decay<br>
against untreated control (UTC), and a liquid formulation of fludioxonil, Maxim™<br>
4FS (Syngenta). Each variety included all three treatments.<br>
[00085]	For each variety, seed was cut and treated on seven (7) different<br>
treatment days. These included the day of planting (0 days), 2, 5, 7, 9,12, and 14<br>
days before planting. After being cut, the seed was stored in burlap bags at 50° F and<br>
90% relative humidity until the planting date, except for the last treatment day in<br>
which the seed was cut, treated, and planted on the same day.<br>
[00086]	All of the seed was inoculated the day of planting with a slurry of<br>
Fusarium sambucinum isolate FID 71-6 (Benzimidazol sensitive), F, sambucinum isolate FID 212 (Benzimidazol resistant), and F. solani var. coeruleum isolate MR-6. 4.2 ml of water suspension at 1.6 X 104 CFU/ml was applied to 48 seed pieces for each treatment.<br>
[00087]	Data reported here are 7 or 9 days before planting. Data collected here<br>
shows early season field evaluations where the plants were dug up and evaluated for<br>
seed piece decay. Seed piece decay was evaluated in percentage ofFusarium "dry" decay, soft rot decay, or a combination of the two in each seed piece, as well as percentage of all of the seed pieces in each treatment which have decay.<br>

[00088]	Cut seedlings undergo a process of Self-healing, called suberization.<br>
During suberization, the cell walls of the seedling excrete suberin, a biochemical that protects the cut area by forming a cork-like barrier between the environmental elements and the inner flesh of the seed. Suberin is composed of two distinctly different biochemical components: a polyphenolic component and a polyaliphatic component. Once the plant material experiences a trauma, which includes cutting and bruising, the plant's own cells initiate suberization to form the protective, healing coating.<br>
[00089]	As shown in Example 4, the fast-drying formulation of the present<br>
invention promotes the cut tuber's natural suberization process, allowing the self-protecting coating to protect the cut, or other trauma cite, and fight against external pathogens. Accordingly, the present invention further provides a process for promoting suberization in plant propagation material comprising applying to the propagation material an effective amount of the liquid composition described herein.<br>
Example 5—Suberization<br>
[00090]	Suberization is objectively measured using a process called the<br>
"suberization index." The following protocol is used to obtain the measurements.<br>
[00091]	Eight seed pieces from each treatment are removed for evaluation at 2,<br>
3, 6, 8 and 13 days after cutting and treating.<br>
[00092]	A rectangular block of tissue, approximately 1 x 3 x 0.5 cm, is cut<br>
from each seed piece at the center of the juncture of the two cut planes. Under a dissecting scope, three serial sections approximately 1mm in thickness are cut from<br>
each rectangular block of tissue. The outer-most sections are discarded and the other<br>
two sections are mounted in water on a microscope slide.<br>
[00093]	The sections are evaluated on a phase contrast microscope using both<br>
incandescent and ultraviolet light.<br>
[00094]	All measurements are taken at 1OOX magnification, at which 10 units<br>
are equal to .08mm.<br>
[00095]	Evaluations include measurements and observations of the number of<br>
cell layers and the thickness of the suberized cells, the uniformity of the suberin<br>
development across the cut surface, the inception and development of a meristematic<br>
region (phellogen) and the periclinal cell division which forms the phellogen, the final<br>
stage of the healing process. These measurements are all used to calculate the<br>
"suberization index".<br>
Example 6—Selective Loading<br>
[00096]	Generally, treatment of potato tubers and/or cut seeds with liquid<br>
pesticides results in the majority of the pesticide settling on the cut side of the seed rather than on the skin side of the seed. Such affinity for the cut side is thought to be based on the pesticides' affinity for water. Because of the naturally-occurring suberization of the tuber or seed, the cut surface is believed to provide better protection against pests and does not need as much pesticide. Rather, the pesticidal action is more useful on the skin side of the tuber, where the eyes are present and where germination occurs.<br>
[00097]	The formulation of the present invention demonstrates a tendency to<br>
selectively load the pesticide on the skin side of the tuber. Although not wanting to be bound by any particular theory, it is thought that the nonpolar nature of the waxes and silicas present in the formulations of the present invention have affinity for the skin side, causing a greater loading of the active ingredients on the skin side. Such affinity is demonstrated by the following results, wherein the thiamethoxam/fluidioxonil formulation of Example 2 of the present invention is compared with the same formulation of Example 2 without wax.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[00098]	As shown in the table above, the amount of thiamethoxam present on<br>
the cut side of the tuber is essentially the same for either formulation; however, the selectivity of the thiamethoxam for the skin side is more defined for the wax-containing formulation. Additionally, the amount of fludioxonil present on the skin side of the tuber is greater than that of the cut side.<br>
Example 6—Insect Protection<br>
[00099]	Comparative trials were conducted to show the protection of the<br>
formulation described herein against different insect pests.. [000100]        In two trials measuring the control of Colorado Potato Beetles on potatoes, the formulation of Example 1 showed improved control versus the untreated check and slightly better control than or the same control as imidacloprid.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[000101]        In trials testing the number of Green Peach Aphids per sample of potatoes, the formulation of Example 1 showed greater reduction in the number of aphid pests than the untreated check or Tops MZ Gaucho™ (Bayer Crop Science; imidacloprid formulation). Results are measured as aphids per sample.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 7—Improved Yield<br>
[000102]        The formulation of the present invention has shown improved yields on trials of potato crops. In trials conducted in Washington and Idaho, the crops resulting from potato seeds treated with the formulation of Example 1 showed better yield, as measured by plant stand, than the untreated contfol and better or comparable yield when compared to Tops MZ Gaucho (Bayer Crop Science).<br>
