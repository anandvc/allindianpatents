DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a system and method for assisting air borne moving vehicles to land within a prescribed landing area. The prescribed landing area is a landing pad on a ship deck. Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the system according to the invention. Optical detectable images (1) of various shapes and sizes are placed on both surfaces of air borne moving vehicles. These moving vehicles may be helicopters or small aircrafts which are capable of landing on a ship deck. A plurahty of optical cameras (2) and optical sources (3) are placed on either side of the ship deck (5) having the prescribed landing area (6) as shown in figure 2. Preferably<br><br>
four optical cameras (2) and four optical sources (3) are placed on the ship deck (5). The optical cameras (2) are infra-red cameras and the optical sources (3) are infra-red sources. The field of view of the optical cameras (2) as shown in figure 3 usually covers the entire area of the ship deck (5). The optical detectable images (1) which are placed on both surfaces of the air borne moving vehicle are infra -red detectable images (1).<br>
When the moving vehicle is within the field of view of the optical cameras (2), the optical sources (3) illuminate the field of view area. The optical cameras (2) capture images of the optical detectable images (1) which are on either sides of the moving vehicle by photographing them. The image information which is captured is sent from the optical cameras (2) to an image processing means (4). The image processing means (4) then computes the centroid of the area formed by the images captured by the optical cameras (2) from both sides of the moving vehicle. This centroid information determines the deviation of the moving vehicle with respect to the center line of the ship deck (5). With the computed centroid, the position of the moving vehicle is estimated with reference to the center of the prescribed landing area (6) on the ship deck. Then, the offset distance of the computed centroid from the prescribed landing area (6) is measured along the x-plane, y-plane and z-plane. All the afore mentioned information is processed in the image processing means (4).<br>
A guidance display (7) is placed on the ship's hangar in a position that can be easily viewed by a pilot approaching the ship deck (5) for   landing an air borne<br><br>
moving vehicle, as shown in figure 2. The display (7) consists of an array of light emitting diodes (LED's) (8). These LED's (8) are arranged in clusters (9) as shown in figure 4. Each cluster of LED's (9) represent a particular position on the prescribed landing area (6) on the ship deck (5). The display (7) is controlled by a control system (10) which is a microprocessor. The information which is processed in the image processing means (4) is transmitted to the control system (10) through an interface. This maybe be a standard serial port interface like RS232/RS485. The control system (10) then transmits this information to driver units (11) which are provided to control the illumination of the LED's (8) in the display (7). During landing approach all the LED's (8) are illuminated continuously, except a particular cluster (9). This one cluster (9) will be flashing in order to denote the position of the moving vehicle with respect to the prescribed landing area (6). The display (7) serves as a visual guidance aid for an aircraft or helicopter pilot approaching the ships deck (5) since it gives the pilot a visual cue as to where the position of the vehicle is with respect to the prescribed landing area (6). The LED's (8) on the display (7) are preferably blue in colour to facilitate clear vision during bad whether and poor light conditions.<br><br><br><br><br>
