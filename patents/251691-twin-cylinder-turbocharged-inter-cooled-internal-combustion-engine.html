DESCRIPTION OF PREFFERED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to the drawings Fig. 1 to 8, wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same,<br>
A novel twin cylinder turbocharged intercooled IC engine in accordance with this invention mainly comprises crank train with its housing, combustion chamber (14,15), valve train and its housing, manifolds (3,4), flywheel (16), turbocharger (5) with a provision of exhaust gas recirculation and intercooler (17). Said crank train primarily comprises of crankshaft (18), connecting rod (19), Piston (20) with piston rings. Said valve train comprises of cam shaft (21), inlet and exhaust valves (22,23). Said valve train housing comprises cylinder head (2), inlet and exhaust ports (24,25) and combustion chambers (14,15).<br>
Wherein said crank train housing houses crankshaft (18) at its bottom, piston with rings is connected to the crankshaft by a connecting rod (19), flywheel (16) with provision for speed sensing, is connected to crankshaft rear end.<br>
Said combustion chambers are pre-combustion chamber (15) and main combustion chamber (14), wherein said pre-combustion chamber (15) is provided in the cylinder head (2) and main combustion chamber (14) is provided in piston (20). Intake and exhaust valves (22,23) are actuated by direct acting overhead camshaft (21). Intake and exhaust ports (24,25) are provided on the same side of the cylinder head. Intake and exhaust manifolds connect ports to intake and exhaust system respectively. Fuel injectors (26) are provided on opposite side of said ports. Said turbocharger (5) is mounted on exhaust manifold (4) and exhaust gas recirculation valve (6) is mounted on inlet manifold (3) and is interconnected with inlet and exhaust manifolds (3,4). Said intercooler (17) is provided in between compressor outlet of said turbocharger and at inlet of said intake manifold.<br><br><br>
Said cylinder head (2) has a provision of external oil return (10) along with internal oil return (27) to sump, required for naturally aspirated engine.<br>
Said engine has got a provision of mounting EGR valve (6) on said inlet manifold. EGR tube (13) is provided in between EGR valve (6) and exhaust manifold (4) to mix the exhaust gases with fresh air in intake system. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, features of exhaust manifold (4) takes care of pulse effects, attributed to the firing interval duration for twin cylinder engine as this has got a major effect on turbocharger effectiveness. EGR valve location is provided such that, distribution of exhaust gases is uniform in both runners of intake manifold &amp; thereafter in intake ports.<br>
Said cylinder block (1) is provided with cross holes between two cylinders, to take additional heat load. On cylinder block, there is a provision of piston cooling nozzle for better cooling of piston. For even firing order of engine, the dead space volume inside crankcase is increased, to minimize the effect of build-up of crankcase pressure &amp; achieve negative crankcase pressure. Increase in dead space volume is achieved by increased oil sump width across crankcase. The oil sump (7) is connected to cylinder crankcase through ladder frame (8), which also helps for structural rigidity. The blow-by gases of cylinder crankcase are taken back to turbocharger inlet, externally, through engine mounted breather (9). Opening of blow by gas connection on oil sump (7) is kept above maximum oil level in oil sump. Blow-by gases from cylinder crankcase to intake system &amp; breather separated oil return to sump, both flows through common pipe (11).<br>
Return passage (10) of engine oil from cylinder head &amp; turbocharger is also routed externally &amp; connected to oil sump such that, it will always enter below minimum level of oil, in oil sump (7). The blow-by passage &amp; oil passage are provided such that, there is minimum mixing of oil with blow-by.<br>
The internal oil return passage &amp; blow-by passage are provided in such a way that, both can be used for naturally aspirated engine, with minimum effort &amp; without affecting engine performance. The features of the said intercooler provided is such a way that<br><br><br>
there should be a minimum drop in charge pressure, so that optimum turbocharger performance can be obtained.<br>
Said engine will also work even if the intercooler is eliminated from the circuit.<br>
The fuel injection system is distributor type pump (12) with boost capsule, which controls the fuel delivery, by sensing the boost pressure, from intake manifold.<br><br>
