				<td>Alpha, Beta-Unsaturated Sulfoxides For Treating Proliferative Disorders<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
This application claims the benefit of copending U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/520,523, filed November 14, 2003, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to compositions and methods for the treatment of proliferative disorders, including but not limited to cancer. The invention further relates to compositions that afford protection from the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation and of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Ionizing Radiation Health Risks<br>
Ionizing radiation has an adverse effect on cells and tissues, primarily through cytotoxic effects. In humans, exposure to ionizing radiation occurs primarily through therapeutic techniques (such as anticancer radiotherapy) or through occupational and environmental exposure.<br>
Therapeutic Administration of Radiation<br>
A major source of exposure to ionizing radiation is the administration of therapeutic radiation in the treatment of cancer or other proliferative disorders. Depending on the course of treatment prescribed by the treating physician, multiple doses may be received by an individual over the course of several weeks to several months.<br>
Therapeutic radiation is generally applied to a defined area of the individual's body which contains abnormal proliferative tissue, in order to maximize the dose absorbed by the abnormal tissue and minimize the dose absorbed by the nearby normal tissue. However, it is difficult (if not impossible) to selectively administer therapeutic ionizing radiation to the abnormal tissue. Thus, normal tissue proximate to the abnormal tissue is also<br><br>
exposed to potentially damaging doses of ionizing radiation throughout the course of treatment.<br>
There are also some treatments that require exposure of the individual's entire body to the radiation, in a procedure called "total body irradiation", or "TBI." The efficacy of radiotherapeutic techniques in destroying abnormal proliferative cells is therefore balanced by associated cytotoxic effects on nearby normal cells. Because of this, radiotherapy techniques have an inherently narrow therapeutic index which results in the inadequate treatment of most tumors. Even the best radiotherapeutic techniques may result in incomplete tumor reduction, tumor recurrence, increasing tumor burden, and induction of radiation resistant tumors.<br>
Numerous methods have been designed to reduce normal tissue damage while still delivering effective therapeutic doses of ionizing radiation. These techniques include brachytherapy, fractionated and hyperfractionated dosing, complicated dose scheduling and delivery systems, and high voltage therapy with a linear accelerator. However, such techniques only attempt to strike a balance between the therapeutic and undesirable effects of the radiation, and full efficacy has not been achieved.<br>
For example, one treatment for individuals with metastatic tumors involves harvesting their hematopoietic stem cells and then treating the individual with high doses of ionizing radiation. This treatment is designed to destroy the individual's tumor cells, but has the side effect of also destroying their normal hematopoietic cells. Thus, a portion of the individual's bone marrow (containing the hematopoietic stem cells), is removed prior to radiation therapy. Once the individual has been treated, the autologous hematopoietic stem cells are returned to their body.<br>
However, if tumor cells have metastasized away from the tumor's primary site, there is a high probability that some tumor cells will contaminate the harvested hematopoietic cell population. The harvested hematopoietic cell population may also contain neoplastic cells if the individual suffers from cancers of the bone marrow such as the various French-American-British (FAB) subtypes of acute myelogenous leukemias (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), or acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Thus, the metastasized tumor<br><br>
cells or resident neoplastic cells must be removed or killed prior to reintroducing the stem cells to the individual. If any living tumorigenic or neoplastic cells are re-introduced into the individual, they can lead to a relapse.<br>
Prior art methods of removing tumorigenic or neoplastic cells from harvested bone marrow are based on a whole-population tumor cell separation or killing strategy, which typically does not kill or remove all of the contaminating malignant cells. Such methods include leukopheresis of mobilized peripheral blood cells, immunoaffinity-based selection or killing of tumor cells, or the use of cytotoxic or photosensitizing agents to selectively kill tumor cells. In the best case, the malignant cell burden may still be at 1 to 10 tumor cells for every 100,000 cells present in the initial harvest (Lazarus et al. J. ofHematotherapy, 2(4):457-66, 1993).<br>
Thus, there is needed a purging method designed to selectively destroy the malignant cells present in the bone marrow, while preserving the normal hematopoietic stem cells needed for hematopoietic reconstitution in the transplantation subject.<br>
Occupational/Environmental Radiation Exposure<br>
Exposure to ionizing radiation can also occur in the occupational setting. Occupational doses of ionizing radiation may be received by persons whose job involves exposure (or potential exposure) to radiation, for example in the nuclear power and nuclear weapons industries. Military personnel stationed on vessels powered by nuclear reactors, or soldiers required to operate in areas contaminated by radioactive fallout, risk similar exposure to ionizing radiation. Occupational exposure may also occur in rescue and emergency personnel called in to deal with catastrophic events involving a nuclear reactor or radioactive material.    Other sources of occupational exposure may be from machine parts, plastics, and solvents left over from the manufacture of radioactive medical products, smoke alarms, emergency signs, and other consumer goods. Occupational exposure may also occur in persons who serve on nuclear powered vessels, particularly those who tend the nuclear reactors, in military personnel operating in areas contaminated by nuclear weapons fallout, and in emergency personnel who deal with nuclear accidents.   Environmental<br><br>
exposure to ionizing radiation may also result from nuclear weapons detonations (either experimental or during wartime), discharges of actinides from nuclear waste storage and processing and reprocessing of nuclear fuel, and from naturally occurring radioactive materials such as radon gas or uranium. There is also increasing concern that the use of ordnance containing depleted uranium results in low-level radioactive contamination of combat areas.<br>
Radiation exposure from any source can be classified as acute (a single large exposure) or chronic (a series of small low-level, or continuous low-level exposures spread over time). Radiation sickness generally results from an acute exposure of a sufficient dose, and presents with a characteristic set of symptoms that appear in an orderly fashion, including hair loss, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, skin burns and bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract and mucous membranes. Genetic defects, sterility and cancers (particularly bone marrow cancer) often develop over time. Chronic exposure is usually associated with delayed medical problems such as cancer and premature aging. An acute a total body exposure of 125,000 millirem may cause radiation sickness. Localized doses such as are used in radiotherapy may not cause radiation sickness, but may result in the damage or death of exposed normal cells.<br>
For example, an acute total body radiation dose of 100,000 - 125,000 millirem (equivalent to 1 Gy) received in less than one week would result in observable physiologic effects such as skin burns or rashes, mucosal and GI bleeding, nausea, diarrhea and/or excessive fatigue. Longer term cytotoxic and genetic effects such as hematopoietic and immunocompetent cell destruction, hair loss (alopecia), gastrointestinal, and oral mucosal sloughing, venoocclusive disease of the liver and chronic vascular hyperplasia of cerebral vessels, cataracts, pneumonites, skin changes, and an increased incidence of cancer may also manifest over time. Acute doses of less than 10,000 millirem (equivalent to 0.1 Gy) typically will not result in immediately observable biologic or physiologic effects, although long term cytotoxic or genetic effects may occur.<br>
A sufficiently large acute dose of ionizing radiation, for example 500,000 to over 1 million millirem (equivalent to 5 - 10 Gy), may kill an individual immediately. Doses in the hundreds of thousands of millirems may kill within 7 to 21 days from a condition called "acute radiation poisoning."<br><br>
Reportedly, some of the Chernobyl firefighters died of acute radiation poisoning, having received acute doses in the range of 200,000 - 600,000 millirem (equivalent to 2 - 6 Gy). Acute doses below approximately 200,000 tnillirem do not result in death, but the exposed individual will likely suffer long-term cytotoxic or genetic effects as discussed above.<br>
Acute occupational exposures usually occur in nuclear power plant workers exposed to accidental releases of radiation, or in fire and rescue personnel who respond to catastrophic events involving nuclear reactors or other sources of radioactive material. Suggested limits for acute occupational exposures in emergency situations were developed by the Brookhaven National Laboratories, and are given in Table 1.<br>
Table 1:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
* 100,000 millirem equals one sieved (Sv). For penetrating radiation such as gamma radiation, one Sv equals approximately one Gray (Gy). Thus, the dosage in Gy can be estimated as 1 Gy for every 100,000 millirem.<br>
A chronic dose is a low level (i.e., 100 - 5000 millirem) incremental or continuous radiation dose received over time. Examples of chronic doses include a whole body dose of ~5000 millirem per year, which is the dose typically received by an adult working at a nuclear power plant. By contrast, the Atomic Energy Commission recommends that members of the general public should not receive more than 100 millirem per year. Chronic doses may cause long-term cytotoxic and genetic effects, for example manifesting as an increased risk of a radiation-induced cancer developing later in life. Recommended limits for chronic exposure to ionizing radiation are given in Table 2.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
By way of comparison, Table 3 sets forth the radiation doses from common sources.<br>
Chronic doses of greater than 5000 millirem per year (0.05 Gy per year) may result in long-term cytotoxic or genetic effects similar to those described for persons receiving acute doses. Some adverse cytotoxic or genetic effects may also occur at chronic doses of significantly less than 5000 millirem per year. For radiation protection purposes, it is assumed that any dose above zero can increase the risk of radiation-induced cancer (i.e., that there is no threshold). Epidemiologic studies have found that the estimated lifetime risk of dying from cancer is greater by about 0.04 % per rem of radiation dose to the whole body.<br>
While anti-radiation suits or other protective gear may be effective at reducing radiation exposure, such gear is expensive, unwieldy, and generally not available to public.   Moreover, radioprotective gear will not protect normal tissue adjacent a tumor from stray radiation exposure during radiotherapy. What is needed, therefore, is a practical way to protect individuals who are scheduled to incur, or are at risk for incurring, exposure to ionizing radiation.   In the context of therapeutic irradiation, it is desirable to enhance protection of normal cells while causing tumor cells to remain vulnerable to the detrimental effects of the radiation.  Furthermore, it is desirable to provide systemic protection from anticipated or inadvertent total body irradiation, such as may occur with occupational or environmental exposures, or with certain therapeutic techniques. Pharmaceutical radioprotectants offer a cost-efficient, effective and easily available alternative to radioprotective gear. However, previous attempts at radioprotection of normal cells with pharmaceutical compositions have not been entirely successful.   For example, cytokines directed at mobilizing the peripheral blood progenitor cells confer a myeloprotective effect when given prior to radiation (Neta et al, Semin. Radial. Oncol. 6:306-320, 1996), but do not confer systemic protection.   Other chemical radioprotectors administered alone or in combination with biologic response modifiers have shown minor protective effects in mice, but application of these compounds to large mammals was less successful, and it was questioned whether chemical radioprotection was of any value (Maisin, J.R., Bacq and Alexander Award Lecture.   "Chemical radioprotection: past, present, and future prospects", Int J. Radial Biol. 73:443-50,   1998).      Pharmaceutical   radiation   sensitizers,  which   are   known   to preferentially enhance the effects of radiation in cancerous tissues, are clearly<br><br>
unsuited for the general systemic protection of normal tissues from exposure to ionizing radiation.<br>
What is needed are therapeutic agents to protect individuals who have incurred, or are at risk for incurring exposure to ionizing radiation. In the context of therapeutic irradiation, it is desirable to enhance protection of normal cells while causing tumor cells to remain vulnerable to the detrimental effects of the radiation. Furthermore, it is desirable to provide systemic protection from anticipated or inadvertent total body irradiation, such as may occur with occupational or environmental exposures, or with certain therapeutic techniques.<br>
Protection From Toxic Side Effects of Experimental Chemotherapy<br>
Experimental chemotherapy has been the mainstay of treatment offered to patients diagnosed with surgically unresectable advanced cancers, or cancers refractory to standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Of the more effective classes of drugs, curative properties are still limited. This is because of their relatively narrow therapeutic index, restricted dosage, delayed treatments and a relatively large proportion of only partial tumor reductions. This state is usually followed by recurrence, increased tumor burden, and drug resistant tumors.<br>
Several cytoprotective agents have been proposed to enhance the therapeutic index of anticancer drugs. For methotrexate toxicity, such agents include asparaginase, leucovorum factor, thymidine, and carbipeptidase. Because of the extensive use of anthracyclines, specific and non-specific cytoprotective agents have been proposed which have varying degrees of efficacy; included are corticosteroids, desrazoxane and staurosporin. The latter is of interest in that it includes a Gl/S restriction blockade in normal cells. (Chen et al, Proc AACR 39:4436A, 1998).<br>
Cisplatin is widely used and has a small therapeutic index which has spurred investigation and search of cytoprotectants. Among the cytoprotectants for cisplatin with clinical potential are mesna, glutathione, sodium thiosulfate, and amifostine (Griggs, Leuk. Res. 22 Suppl 1:827-33, 1998; List et al., Semin. Oncol. 23(4 Suppl 8):58-63, 1996; Taylor et al, Eur. J. Cancer 33(10): 1693-8, 1997). None of these or other proposed cytoprotectants such as oxonic acid for<br><br>
fluoropyrimidine toxicity, or prosaptide for paclitaxel PC 12 cell toxicity, appears to function by a mechanism which renders normal replicating cells into a quiescent state.<br>
What is needed are new effective cytoprotective agents which are effective in protecting animals, inclusive of humans, from the cytotoxic side effects of chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
q.B-Unsaturated Sulfone Compounds<br>
Certain a,fl-unsaturated sulfones, particularly styrylbenzyl sulfones have been shown to posses antiproliferative, radioprotective and chemoprotective activity. See, US patents 6,599,932, 6,576,675, 6,548,553, 6,541,475, 6,486,210, 6,414,034, 6,359,013, 6,201,154, 6,656,973 and 6,762,207, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein.<br>
Metabolic Sulfoxide Oxidation<br>
Sulfoxide functional groups are metabolically oxidized to the corresponding sulfones via the cytochrome P-450 family of oxidizing enzymes. Cytochrome P-450 enzymes are iron-based proteins that mediate redox reactions wherein a substrate, e.g., a drug molecule, is oxidized and the iron is reduced.<br>
The oxidative metabolism of sulfoxide moieties has been employed by administering sutfoxide compounds that are metabolically converted to active metabolite sulfone compounds. One example of this strategy is the administration of sulindac sulfoxide, a commonly prescribed antiinflammatory drug has been shown to additionally have cancer chemopreventative activity. See, Thompson et al., Cancer Research, 1997, Jan. 15; 57(2), pg. 267-271.<br>
The sulindac sulfoxide possesses no antiinflammatory activity but is rather a prodrug that is converted metabolically to the active sulfide. Once administered, the sulindac suifoxide is readily reduced to the antiinflammatory sulfide form in the liver and in the colon via bacterial microflora. However, the sulindac sulfoxide is also metabolically oxidized in the liver to the sulfone that is subsequently excreted in the bile and intestine. The sulfone metabolite has no antiinflammatory activity, however the sulfone still retains the ability to inhibit tumor cell growth and induce apoptosis. See S. M. Fischer, Frontiers in Bioscience, 2, pg. 482-500, (1997).<br><br>
Definitions<br>
General<br>
The term "individual" or "subject", includes human beings and non-human animals. With respect to the disclosed radioprotective and cytoprotective methods, these terms refer, unless the context indicates otherwise, to an organism that is scheduled to incur, or is at risk for incurring, or has incurred, exposure to ionizing radiation or exposure to one or more cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
The expression "effective amount" when used to describe therapy to a patient suffering from a proliferative disorder, refers to the amount of a compound of Formula I that inhibits the growth of tumor cells or alternatively induces apoptosis of cancer cells, preferably tumor cells, resulting in a therapeutically useful and selective cytotoxic effect on proliferative cells when administered to a patient suffering from a cancer or other disorder which manifests abnormal cellular proliferation. The term "effective amount" is inclusive of amounts of a compound of Formula I that is metabolized to an active metabolite in an amount that inhibits the growth of tumor cells or induces apoptosis of cancer cells.<br>
The term "antibody" is intended to encompass not only intact antigen-binding immunoglobulin molecules, but also to include antigen-binding fragments thereof such as Fab, Fab' and F(ab')z fragments, or any other fragment retaining the antigen-binding ability of an intact antibody.<br>
The expression "humanized antibody" refers to an antibody that has its complementary determining regions (CDR's) derived from a non-human species immunoglobulin, and the remainder of the antibody molecule derived from a human immunoglobulin.<br>
The expression "chimeric antibody" means an antibody comprising a variable region and a constant region derived from different species.<br>
The expression "humanized chimeric antibody" is meant a chimeric antibody in which at least the constant region is human-derived.<br>
The expression "monospecific polyclonal antibody" means an antibody preparation comprising multiple antibody species having specificity for a single antigen.<br><br>
The term "proliferative disorder" means a disorder wherein cells are made by the body at an atypical ly accelerated rate.<br>
Radioprotection<br>
As used herein, "ionizing radiation" is radiation of sufficient energy that, when absorbed by cells and tissues, induces formation of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage. This type of radiation includes X-rays, gamma rays, and particle bombardment (e.g., neutron beam, electron beam, protons, mesons and others), and is used for medical testing and treatment, scientific purposes, industrial testing, manufacturing and sterilization, weapons and weapons development, and many other uses. Radiation is typically measured in units of absorbed dose, such as the rad or gray (Gy), wherein 1 rad = 0.01 Gy, or in units of dose equivalence, such as the rem or sievert (Sv), wherein 1 rem = 0.01 Sv.<br>
The Sv is the Gy dosage multiplied by a factor that includes tissue damage done. For example, penetrating ionizing radiation (e.g., gamma and beta radiation) have a factor of about 1, so 1 Sv = ~1 Gy. Alpha rays have a factor of 20, so 1 Gy of alpha radiation = 20 Sv.<br>
By "effective amount of ionizing radiation" is meant an amount of ionizing radiation effective in killing, or in reducing the proliferation, of abnormally proliferating cells in an individual. As used with respect to bone marrow purging, "effective amount of ionizing radiation" means an amount of ionizing radiation effective in killing, or in reducing the proliferation, of malignant cells in a bone marrow sample removed from an individual.<br>
By "acute exposure to ionizing radiation" or "acute dose of ionizing radiation" is meant a dose of ionizing radiation absorbed by an individual in less than 24 hours. The acute dose may be localized, as in radiotherapy techniques, or may be absorbed by the individual's entire body. Acute doses are typically above 10,000 millirem (0.1 Gy), but may be lower.<br>
By "chronic exposure to ionizing radiation" or "chronic dose of ionizing radiation" is meant a dose of ionizing radiation absorbed by an individual over a period greater than 24 hours. The dose may be intermittent or continuous, and may be localized or absorbed by the individual's entire body. Chronic doses are typically less than 10,000 millirem (0.1 Gy), but may be higher.<br><br>
By "at risk of incurring exposure to ionizing radiation" is meant that an individual may intentionally, e.g., by scheduled radiotherapy sessions, or inadvertently be exposed to ionizing radiation in the future. Inadvertent exposure includes accidental or unplanned environmental or occupational exposure.<br>
By "effective amount of a radioprotective compound" is meant an amount of compound of Formula I effective to reduce or eliminate the toxicity associated with radiation in normal cells of the individual, and also to impart a direct cytotoxic effect to abnormally proliferating cells in the individual. As used with respect to bone marrow purging, "effective amount" of the radioprotective compound of Formula I means an amount of compound effective to reduce or eliminate the toxicity associated with radiation in bone marrow removed from an individual, and also to impart a direct cytotoxic effect to malignant cells in the bone marrow removed from the individual.<br>
Cvtoprotection<br>
By "effective amount" of the mitotic phase cell cycle inhibitor or topoisomerase inhibitor is meant an amount of said inhibitor effective in killing or reducing the proliferation of cancer cells in a host animal.<br>
By "effective amount" of the cytoprotective compound of Formula I is meant an amount of compound effective to reduce the toxicity of the mitotic phase cell cycle inhibitor or topoisomerase inhibitor on normal cells of the animal.<br>
The expression "cell cycle" refers to the usual description of cell development in terms of a cycle consisting of a series of phases - interphase and M (mitotic) phase - and the subdivision of interphase into the times when DNA synthesis is proceeding, known as the S-phase (for synthesis phase), and the gaps that separate the S-phase from mitosis. Gl is the gap after mitosis but before DNA synthesis starts, and 02 is the gap after DNA synthesis is complete before mitosis and cell division. Interphase is thus composed of successive Gl, S and G2 phases, and normally comprises 90% or more of the total cell cycle time. The M phase consists of nuclear division (mitosis) and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis). During the early part of the M phase, the replicated<br><br>
chromosomes condense from their extended interphase condition. The nuclear envelope breaks down, and each chromosome undergoes movements that result in the separation of pairs of sister chromatids as the nuclear contents are divided. Two new nuclear envelopes then form, and the cytoplasm divides to generate two daughter cells, each with a single nucleus. This process of cytokinesis terminates the M phase and marks the beginning of the interphase of the next cell cycle. The daughter cells resulting from completion of the M phase begin the interphase of a new cycle.<br>
By "mitotic phase cell cycle inhibitor" is meant a chemical agent whose mechanism of action includes inhibition of a cell's passage through any portion of the mitotic (M) phase of the cell cycle.<br>
By "topoisomerase inhibitor" is meant a chemical agent whose mechanism of action includes interfering with the function of a topoisomerase.<br>
By "topoisomerase" is meant an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of DNA from one topological form to another by introducing transient breaks in one or both strands of a DNA duplex.<br>
"Topological isomers" are molecules that differ only in their state of supercoiling. Type I topoisomerase cuts one strand of DNA and relaxes negatively supercoiled DNA, but does not act on positively supercoiled DNA. Type II topoisomerase cuts both strands of DNA and increases the degree of negative supercoiling in DNA.<br>
Chemical<br>
The term "alkenyl" employed alone or in combination with other terms, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight chain, branched chain or cyclic hydrocarbon group having the stated number of carbon atoms and containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Examples include vinyl, propenyl (allyl), crotyl, isopentenyl, butadienyl, 1,3-pentadienyl, 1,4-pentadienyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclopentadienyl and the higher homologs and isomers. A divalent radical derived from an alkene is exemplified by -CH=CH-CH2-.<br>
The term "alkyl", by itself or as part of another substituent, e.g., alkoxy, haloalkyl or aminoalkyl, means, unless otherwise stated, a saturated hydrocarbon radical having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e.<br><br>
means one to six carbons) and includes straight, branched chain, cyclic and polycyclic groups. Examples include: methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, norbornyl and cyclopropylmethyl. Most preferred is (C|-C3)alkyl, particularly ethyl, methyl and isopropyl.<br>

Examples of substituted alkyls include, but are not limited to, 2,2-difluoropropyl, 2-carboxycyclopentyl and 3-chloropropyl.<br>
The term "alkylene", by itself or as part of another substituent means, unless otherwise stated, a divalent straight, branched or cyclic chain hydrocarbon radical.<br>
The term "alkoxy" employed alone or in combination with other terms means, unless otherwise stated, an alkyl group having the designated number of carbon atoms, as defined above, connected to the rest of the molecule via an oxygen atom, such as, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, 1-propoxy, 2-propoxy (isopropoxy) and the higher homologs and isomers.

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Treatment of Proliferative Disorders<br>
According to the present invention, a,|3-unsaturated sulfoxides and salts thereof are believed to selectively inhibit proliferation of cancer cells, and kill various tumor cell types without killing (or with reduced killing of) normal cells. It is believed that cells are killed at concentrations where normal cells may be temporarily growth-arrested but not killed.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered to individuals (mammals, including animals and humans) afflicted with cancer.<br>
The compounds of the invention are believed to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells and, for some compounds, to induce cell death. Cell death is believed to result from the induction of apoptosis. The compounds are believed effective against a broad range of tumor types, including but not limited to the following: ovarian cancer; cervical cancer; breast cancer; prostate cancer; testicular cancer, lung cancer, renal cancer; colorectal cancer; skin cancer; brain cancer; leukemia, including acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, acute Jymphoid leukemia, and chronic lymphoid leukemia.<br>
More particularly, cancers that may be treated by the compounds, compositions and methods of the invention include, but are not limited to:<br>
Cardiac: sarcoma (angiosarcoma, fibrosnrcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma), myxoma, rhabdomyoma, fibroma, lipoma and teratoma;<br>

Cancers may be solid tumors that may or may not be metastatic. Cancers may also occur, as in leukemia, as a diffuse tissue. Thus, the term "tumor cell" as provided herein, includes a cell afflicted by any one of the above identified disorders.<br>
The compounds are also believed useful in the treatment of non-cancer proliferative disorders, that is, proliferative disorders which are characterized by benign indications. Such disorders may also be known as "cytoproliferative" or "hyperproliferative" in that cells are made by the body at an atypically elevated rate. Non-cancer proliferative disorders believed treatable by compounds of the invention include, for example: hemangiomatosis in newborn, secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, chronic progressive myelodegenerative disease, neurofibromatosis, ganglioneuromatosis, keloid formation, Pagets Disease of the bone, fibrocystic disease of the breast, uterine fibroids, Peronies and Duputren's fibrosis, restenosis, benign proliferative breast disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder (Duncan disease), post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), macular degeneration, and retinopathies such as diabetic retinopathies and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR)<br>
Other non-cancer proliferative disorders believed treatable by compounds of the invention include pre-cancerous lymphoproliferative cells associated with an elevated risk of progression to a cancerous disorder. Many non-cancerous lymphoproliferative disorders are associated with latent viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Hepatitis C. These disorders often begin as a benign pathology and progress into lymphoid neoplasia as a function of time.<br>
Treatment of tumor cells with the a,p-unsaturated sulfoxide compounds of the invention is believed to lead to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptotic cell death.<br><br>
Rad ioproteoti ve Treatment<br>
The compounds of the invention are also believed to protect normal cells and tissues from the effects of acute and chronic exposure to ionizing radiation.<br>
Individuals may be exposed to ionizing radiation when undergoing therapeutic irradiation for the treatment of proliferative disorders. The compounds are believed effective in protecting normal cells during therapeutic irradiation of abnormal tissues. The compounds are also believed useful in protecting normal cells during radiation treatment for leukemia, especially in the purging of malignant cells from autologous bone marrow grafts with ionizing radiation.<br>
According to the -invention, therapeutic ionizing radiation may be administered to an individual on any schedule and in any dose consistent with the prescribed course of treatment, as long as the radioprotectant compound of the invention is administered prior to the radiation. The course of treatment differs from individual to individual, and those of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine the appropriate dose and schedule of therapeutic radiation in a given clinical situation.<br>
Chemoprotective Treatment<br>
In addition, the compounds of the present invention are believed to protect normal cells and tissues from the effects of exposure to cytotoxic agents such as for example, mitotic phase cell cycle inhibitors and topoisomerase inhibitors.<br>
Mitotic Phase Cell Cycle Inhibitors<br>
The usual description of the cell cycle describes the cycle in terms of a series of phases - interphase and M (mitotic) phase â€¢ and the subdivision of interphase into the times when DNA synthesis is proceeding, known as the S-phase (for synthesis phase), and the gaps that separate the S-phase from mitosis. Gl is the gap after mitosis but before DNA synthesis starts, and G2 is the gap after DNA synthesis is complete before mitosis and cell division. Interphase is thus composed of successive Gl, S and G2 phases, and normally comprises 90% or more of the total cell cycle time. The M phase consists of nuclear division<br><br>
(mitosis) and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis). During the early part of the M phase, the replicated chromosomes condense from their extended interphase condition. The nuclear envelope breaks down, and each chromosome undergoes movements that result in the separation of pairs of sister chromatids as the nuclear contents are divided. Two new nuclear envelopes then form, and the cytoplasm divides to generate two daughter cells, each with a single nucleus. This process of cytokinesis terminates the M phase and marks the beginning of the interphase of the next cell cycle. The daughter cells resulting from completion of the M phase begin the interphase of a new cycle.<br>
A mitotic phase cell cycle inhibitor is a chemical agent whose mechanism of action includes inhibition of a cell's passage through any portion of the mitotic (M) phase of the cell cycle. Such agents include, by way of example and not limitation, taxanes, such as paclitaxel and its analogs; vinca alkaloids such as vincristine and vinblastine; coichicine; estramustine; and naturally occurring macrolides such as rhizoxin, maytansine, ansamitocin P-3, phomopsin A, dolastatin 10 and halichrondin B.<br>
Paclitaxel is an anti-mitotic drug presently used as an initial treatment for ovarian, breast and lung cancer, with moderate success. Vincristine is a well-established anti-mitotic drug widely used for the treatment of breast cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma and childhood cancers.<br>
Topoisomerase Inhibitors<br>
A topoisomeruse inhibitor is a chemical agent whose mechanism of action includes interfering with the function of a topoisomerase.<br>
The topoisomerases constitute a group of enzymes that catalyze the conversion of DNA from one topological form to another by introducing transient breaks in one or both strands of a DNA duplex. Topological isomers are molecules that differ only in their state of supercoiling. Topoisomerases serve to relieve torsional stress during replication and transcription. They alter the DNA structure, but not the sequence.<br>
Three different types of topoisomerases have been reported in humans. They are topoisomerase I (91 kDa monomer), and topoisomerase II, which is further subclassified as Ha (170 kDa dimer), and lip (180 kDa dimer). The<br><br>
three different types are encoded by genes on three separate chromosomes. Simpler organisms possess only topoisomerase I; however, higher organisms have all three types of topoisomerases. While topoisomerase Ila is present in all eukaryotes, lip is present only in vertebrates and appears to be more closely associated with cell differentiation than proliferation. Topoisomerase lip appears to be highly homologous to the type Ila.<br>
Topoisomerases act by catalyzing the breakdown and rejoining reactions in the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA molecules. Topoisomerase I reversibly cleaves a single strand in duplex DNA molecule, whereas topoisomerase II breaks and rejoins both DNA strands. These reactions are believed to proceed via transient reaction intermediates, known as "cleavable complexes," where the enzymes (or enzyme subunits) form covalent bonds involving a tyrosine and the cleaved phosphodiester bond of the DNA substrate backbone.<br>
Topoisomerases have become important chemotherapeutic targets for cancer treatment.     Camptothecin and  its derivatives are reported to act specifically at the level of the topoisomerase I - DNA complex and stimulate DNA cleavage. Agents, such as p-lapachone, act by blocking the formation of the topoisomerase I - DNA complex. Several novel compounds have been developed that can target either topoisomerase I or topoisomerase IIa-/II(3-isoforms, or all three types of topoisomerases. Inhibition of topoisomerase II is considered to be more challenging due to the complexity of interactions. Most inhibitors of topoisomerase 11 block the ligation step, leading to stabilized "cleavable complexes" between DNA and the enzyme. Most enzyme inhibitors function by docking into the enzyme active site or nearby allosteric site to block the reaction of the normal substrate. Inhibition of the topoisomerase II involves two parts: the aromatic part of the inhibitor molecule intercalates between DNA base pairs and another more polar portion  interacts with topoisomerase. Because topoisomerase II inhibitors (e.g., doxorubicin, and etoposide) act as poisons rather than as classical competitive inhibitors, their action is dependent upon the level of the enzyme in cells. Rapidly proliferating cells, which contain relatively higher levels of topoisomerase II, appear to be more sensitive to these<br><br>
agents. On the other hand, differentiated cells have relatively low topoisomerase II levels and are much more resistant to the action of these inhibitors.<br>
Inhibitors of topoisomerase I include, for example, adriamycin, etoposide, 0-lapachone (Calbiochem No. 428022), AG-555 (Calbiochem No. 112270), 10-hydroxycamptothecin (Calbiochem No. 390238), AG-1387 (Calbiochem No. 658520), rebeccamycin (Calbiochem No. 553700), nogalamycin (Calbiochem No. 488200), and topotecan (Calbiochem No. 614800).<br>
Inhibitors of topoisomerase II include, for example, camptothecin, irinotecan and topotecan, amsacrine (Calbiochem No. 171350), aurintricarboxylic acid (Calbiochem No. 189400), bruneomycin (Calbiochem No. 571120), ellipticine (Calbiochem No. 324688), epirubicin (Calbiochem No. 324905), etoposide (Calbiochem No. 341205), genistein (Calbiochem No. 345834), and merbarone (Calbiochem No. 445800).<br>
Inhibitors of topoisomerase I and II include, for example, aclarubicin (Calbiochem No. 112270), congocidine (Calbiochem No. 480676), daunomycin (Calbiochem No. 251800), ellagic acid (Calbiochem No. 324683), and suramin (Calbiochem No. 574625).<br>
a.p-Unsaturated Sulfoxides of the Invention<br>
The compounds of the present invention differ from other known cytoprotective agents in that they arc believed to not only protect normal cells, but also to be operationally cytotoxic in tumor cells. In normal cells, the cytoprotective compounds of the invention are believed to induce a reversible resting state rendering the normal cells relatively refractory to the cytotoxic effect of mitotic phase cell cycle inhibitors and topoisomerase inhibitors.<br>
In addition, without wishing to be bound by any theory, the sulfoxides of the present invention may be metabolized to active metabolites, such metabolism including, but not limited to, oxidation of the sulfoxide moiety to a sulfone. The biological activity of a,p-unsaturated sulfones including antiproliferative activity, radioprotection activity and chemoprotectant activity is described in US patents: 6,201154, 6,359,013, 6,414,034, 6,486210, 6,541,475,<br><br>
6,548,553,6,576,675, 6,599,932, and PCX publications: WO 02069892A3, WO 03064616A2, WO 03072062A2 and WO 03072063A2, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The ring systems A and B of the compounds of the invention are optionally substituted. Any degree of substitution is possible on the ring systems A and B of Formula I. The aryl and heteroaryl rings A and B are preferably mono-, di- or tri substituted, but may be fully substituted, i.e., wherein every ring hydrogen atom on A and B is replaced with a substituent.<br>
The pattern of substitution for ring hydrogens of A and B of Formula I may comprise any pattern of substitution. For example, on a phenyl A or B ring, tri-substitution may comprise substitution at positions 2, 3 and 4, positions 2, 4 and 5, positions 3, 4 and 5, positions 2, 5 an 6 or positions 2, 4 and 6. Likewise, the pattern of tetra-substitution of a phenyl A or B ring may comprise, for example, substitution at positions 2, 3, 4 and 5, positions 2, 4, 5 and 6, or positions 2, 3, 5 and 6. Di-substitution of a phenyl A or B ring may comprise substitution, for example, at the 2 and 3 positions, the 2 and 4 positions, the 2 and 5 positions, the 2 and 6, positions, the 3 and 4 positions, the 3 and 5 positions, or the 3 and 6 positions.<br>
The pattern of substitution on a five-membered heteroaryl A or B ring must also account for the number of heteroatoms contained in the heteroaromatic ring and point of attachment of the heteroaryl ring. Substitution on a five membered heteroaromatic ring containing one heteroatom, wherein the heteroaryl ring is bonded via its two position serves to exemplify the variety of substitution patterns. Substitution on the aforesaid five-membered heteroaryl ring may be, for example, at the 3, 4 or 5 position for mono-substitution; and at the 3 and 4, the 3 and 5, or the 4 and 5 positions for di-substitution.<br>
Where a phenyl A or B ring is mono-substituted the substituent is preferably located at the ortho- or para-position . Where a phenyl A or B ring is di-substituted, the substituents are preferably located at the ortho- and para-positions, or the meta- and para-positions.<br>
According to certain preferred embodiments, the meta- and para-position of the aryl or heteroaryl A ring of Formula I is substituted. Preferably, the para<br>
substituent is halogen or (C1-C6)alkoxy, and the meta substituent is amino, alky I amino, acyl amino or suifonyl amino in these embodiments<br>
Besides the terms "para-", "meta-" and "ortho-", substitution positions on a ring may be denoted by a numbering system. However numbering systems are often not consistent between different ring systems. In six-membered aromatic systems, the spatial arrangements are specified as described above by the common nomenclature "para" for 1,4-substitution, "meta" for 1,3-substitution and "ortho" for 1,2-substitution as shown below in Scheme 3.<br>
, <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Since aromatic rings are essentially planar, these designations essentially define geometric positions on a six-membered ring that could be communicated geometrically, i.e., the ortho substituent forms a planar angle of 60Â° with a reference substituent to which it is referred to as being ortho. Likewise, a meta substituent defines a 120Â° planar angle and a para substituent defines a 180Â° angle.<br>
To designate substituent patterns in a general way for any planar ring system, the ortho-meta-para nomenclature is only descriptive for six-membered monocycles, i.e., there is no "para" substituent on a five-membered aromatic ring or a bicyclic ring. However, definition of a planar angle or a range of planar angles between two substiruents is a convention which readily communicates a particular substitution pattern that is independent of the nature of the particular ring involved. Thus, a para substituent in a six-membered aromatic ring is closely approximated in other planar mono- or bicyclic rings by any substituent which, with the reference substituent, forms a planar angle of between about 144Â° and about 180Â°. Likewise, a meta substituent in a six-membered aromatic ring is approximated in other planar mono- or bicyclic rings by any substituent which, with the reference substituent, forms a planar angle of between about 90Â° and about 144Â°. Several examples of substituent patterns which could be communicated in this way are depicted in Scheme 4.<br><br>
, <br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br><br><br><br>
In some instances, a true angle is not formed between a substituent and a reference substituent. One example of this is a naphthalene system substituted at the 1 - and 5-positions as shown in the (e) structure above. In the (e) structure there is no geometric intersection between the lines defined by the I- and 5-position bonds. However, it is reasonable to regard these "parallel" bonds as defining a 180Â° angle and thus approximating the para-arrangement of a six-membered planar ring.<br>
Preparation of Compounds of the Invention<br>
a,p-unsaturated sulfoxides of Formula I may be prepared via synthetic organic chemistry methods within the capability of a chemist of ordinary skill. Compounds of Formula le and of Formula Iz are preferably prepared via procedures that are selective for the preparation of (E)- or (Z)- olefins respectively.<br>
Preparation of (Â£)-Compounds of the Invention<br>
One preferred preparation of the (Â£)-a,p-unsaturated sulfoxides of Formula le is by a Knoevenagel condensation of B-aldehydes (iv) with A-(CHR')n-sulfinyl acetic acids (iii), according to the Scheme 5 below, wherein A, B, n and R1 are defined as for Formula I, above.<br>

The reaction is done in the presence of a suitable base, preferably sodium-/er/-butoxide. The reaction is preferably done in the presence of a suitable solvent, preferably a solvent having a boiling point greater than 50Â° C, more preferably a solvent selected from the group consisting of toluene, xylene, mesitylene, DMF, NMP, and THF. See, Li et al., J. Org. Chem., 2001, 66, 8677-8681; and Li et al, J. Org. Chem., 2002, 67, 3643-3650, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The sulfide acetic acid compound (ii) in Scheme 5 may be then oxidized with a suitable oxidizing agent to give a corresponding sulfinyl acetic acid compound (iii). A suitable oxidizing agent is any oxidant capable of selectively oxidizing a sulfide to a sulfoxide. Examples include 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) (Aldrich 27,303-1) and potassium peroxymonosulfate (Aldrich 22,803-6) The oxidation is preferably performed at low temperature, preferably from -40Â°C to 0Â°C. The reaction is preferably carried out in a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents are preferably nonpolar organic solvents, more preferably halogenated solvents, e.g., dichloromethane (DCM).<br>
Condensation of (iii) with the B-aldehydes (iv) via a Knocvenagel reaction in the presence of benzylamine and glacial acetic acid yields the desired (Â£)-a,p-unsaturated sulfoxide of Formula le.<br>
The following is a more detailed two-part synthesis procedure for preparing the Formula le a,p-unsaturated sulfoxides, (Â£)-A-CHR'SOCH=CH-B, according to the above Scheme 5 via intermediate sulfonylacetic acid (iii). The following synthesis procedures show syntheses of compounds wherein A and B are both phenyl. However the procedures are exemplary of compounds of Formula I comprising other aryl and heteroaryl A and B rings.<br><br>

, <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
According to Scheme 6, to a cold (0Â° C) solution of sodium hydroxide (40 g, 1 mol) in methanol (500 mL), is added thioglycollic acid (46 g, 0.5 mol) slowly over 30 minutes. The precipitated sodium thioglycollate formed thereby is dissolved by stirring and warming the reaction mixture to about 50Â° C. The solution is then cooled to room temperature. A substituted benzyl chloride 1 (80.5 g, 0.5 mol) is added portionwise in order to attenuate of exothermic nature of the reaction. The resulting reaction mixture is then heated at reflux for 2 hours, then cooled to ambient temperature and poured onto crushed ice (1 Kg) containing concentrated hydrochloric acid (100 mL). A solid white precipitate is formed. The precipitate is filtered, washed with ice cold water and dried under vacuum to yield a benzylthioacetic acid 2.<br>
According to an alternative to step A above, the benzylthioacetic acid intermediates 2 may be generated via the two-step route shown in Scheme 6, by substituting a thioglycollate ester (HS-CH2.CO2R) for thioglycollic acid, wherein R is an alkyl group, typically (Ci-CgJalkyl.

The resulting mixture is washed successively with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (3 x 30 mL), sodium bisulfite (40 mL), dilute hydrochloric acid (40 mL) and water (60 mL). The ether layer is then dried over anhydrous calcium chloride and concentrated. The resulting solid residue is purified by crystallization or by column chromatography on silica gel to yield an (Â£^-a,p-unsaturated Sulfoxides of Formula le, 5.<br>

, <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
According to Scheme 9, the (2p-o,p-unsaturated sulfoxides of Formula Iz are preferably prepared by a nucleophilic addition of an appropriate thiol salt (v) to an optionally substituted aryl or heteroarylacetylene (vi), according to the Scheme 9 below. A, B, n and R1 are defined as for Formula I, above, and Q+ is a counterion, preferably an alkali metal, e.g., sodium, lithium or potassium, an alkaline earth metal, e.g., calcium or magnesium, or a transition metal, e.g., zinc or copper. The procedure is analogous to the procedure described by Reddy et al, Sulfur Letters 13:83-90 (1991) for the production of (2)-styryl benzylsulfoxides. The entire disclosure of Reddy et al. is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The sulfide intermediate (vii) is then oxidized by a suitable oxidizing agent. A suitable oxidizing agent is one capable of oxidizing a sulfide to a sulfoxide of Formula Iz. Suitable oxidizing agents for this reaction are as described above for the oxidation of sulfide acetic acids (ii) to sulfoxide acetic acids (iii) in the preparation of (Â£)-a,p unsaturated sulfoxides.<br>
The following is a more detailed two-part synthesis for preparing the Formula Iz a,p-unsaturated sulfoxides, (Z)-A-CHR'SOCH=CH-B. The procedure is illustrated where A and B are both phenyl. However the procedure is applicable to the preparation of compounds of Formula I comprising other aryl and heteroaryl A and B rings.<br>

The reaction mixture is stirred at -5Â° C for 6 hours. The precipitated 3-chlorobenzoic acid is removed by filtration. The filtrate is washed with water, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated. After removal of the solvent, the product (Z)-a,p-unsaturated sulfoxide of Formula I is purified either by crystallization or silica gel chromatography.<br><br>
g.B-Unsaturated  Sulfoxides as Intermediates  in Preparing q.p-Unsaturated Sulfones<br>

, <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
According to Scheme 12, an o,p-unsaturated sulfoxide, according to Formula I may be oxidized to the corresponding sulfdne according to Formula V by use of any reagent capable of oxidizing a sulfoxide to a sulfone.  Suitable oxidizing reagents include peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide, peracids such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA) or persulfates such as OXONE (potassium peroxymonosulfate).   The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent.   Suitable solvents include, for example, water, acetic acid or non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM). The reaction may be performed at elevated temperature, for example, from about 30 to about 100Â° C with 30% hydrogen peroxide (0.12 mol) in glacial acetic acid (25 mL) by refluxing for 1-2 hours. When the reaction is complete, the reaction mixture may be cooled to ambient temperature and poured onto crushed ice.   The product may precipitate and subsequently be collected  by filtration and recrystallized from a suitable solvent.    Suitable solvents include water and mixtures of water with one or more water-miscible organic solvents such as THF, acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and acetonitrile.<br>
Derivatization of Compounds of the Invention to form Conjugates<br>
Preferably, the derivative comprises a carboxylic acid derivative. The carrier may comprise any molecule sufficiently large to be capable of generating an immune response in an appropriate host animal. One such preferred carrier is keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Additionally, structural components of substituents on the A or B rings of compounds of the invention (e.g., as peptidyl<br><br>
substituents) can potentially provide antigenic activity sufficient to raise antibodies to the styryl sulfones. Antibodies, preferably monoclonal antibodies and monospecific polyclonal antibodies, and most preferably tumor-specific antibodies may be covalently linked to compounds of the present invention.<br>
The covalent linker between a compound of Formula I (or Formulae le, Iz or IA) and an antibody may, in its simplest form, comprise a single covalent bond connecting the compound of Formula I to the antibody. More commonly, the compound of Formula I is attached to the antibody using a suitable bifunctional linking reagent. The term "bifunctional linking reagent" refers generally to a molecule that comprises two reactive moieties which are connected by a spacer element. The term "reactive moieties" in this context, refers to chemical functional groups capable of coupling with an antibody or a compound of Formula I by reacting with functional groups on the antibody and the compound of Formula I.<br>
An example of a covalent bond formed as a linker between a compound of Formula I and an antibody is a disulfide bond formed by the oxidation of an antibody and a compound of Formula I, wherein a substituent on A or B of Formula I comprises a peptidyl moiety containing one or more cysteine amino acids. The cysteine residues can be oxidized to form disulfide links by dissolving 1 mg of the a suitable compound of Formula I and 0.5 equivalents of the desired antibody in 1.5 mL of 0.1% (v/v) 17.5 mM acetic acid, pH 8.4, followed by flushing with nitrogen and then 0.01 M K2Fe(CN)6. After incubation for one hour at room temperature, the adduct peptide is purified by HPLC.<br>
Another example of a suitable covalent bond formed as a linker between a compound of Formula I and an antibody is an amide bond formed by reacting an amino group on a compound of the invention with a carboxylic acid group which forms part of the primary structure of the antibody (Ab) (e.g., for example a glutamic or aspartic amino acid residue). Alternately, an amide bond could be formed if the reacting moieties were reversed, i.e., the compound of Formula I could contain a carboxylic acid functionality and react with an amino functionality within the Ab structure.<br><br>
Alternatively, a compound of Formula I and an antibody Ab may be covalently linked using a bifunctional linking reagent. In one such embodiment of the present invention, a compound of Formula I, wherein a substituent on A or B of Formula I comprises a peptidyl moiety, is coupled to an antibody using a bifunctional linking reagent.<br>
/<br>
For example,  adducts can be  prepared  by  first preparing S-(-N-hexylsuccinimido)-modified derivatives of an antibody and of a compound of Formula I, according to the method of Cheronis et al, J Med. Chem. 37: 348 (1994)(the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). N-hexylmaleimide, a precursor for the modified antibody and compound of Formula I, is prepared from W-(methoxycarbonyl)maleimide and AMiexylamine by mixing the two compounds in saturated NaHCOs at 0Â° C according to the procedure of Bodanszky and Bodanszky, The Practice of Peptide Synthesis; Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 29-31 (1984)(the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). The product of the resulting reaction mixture is isolated by extraction into ethyl acetate, followed by washing with water, dried  over NazSO^  and  is then  concentrated  in  vacua to  produce N-hexylmaleimide as  a  light yellow  oil.     S-(AMiexylsuccinimido)-modified antibody and Formula I compound are then prepared from a cysteine-containing peptide and jV-hexylmaleimide by mixing one part peptide with 1.5 parts N-hexylmaleimide in DMF (3.3 mL/mM peptide) followed by addition to 30 volumes of 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5.  The S-alkylation reaction carried out in this manner is complete in 30 min.    The resulting S-(N-hexylsuccmimido)-rnodified   peptide   monomer   is   purified   by  preparative reverse-phase HPLC, followed by lyophilization as a fluffy, white powder.<br>
Bis-succinimidohexane peptide heterodimers (wherein one peptide is the antibody and the other peptide is a Formula I compound wherein a substituent on A or B of Formula I comprises a peptidyl moiety), may be prepared according to the method of Cheronis et al., supra from cysteine-substituted peptides. A mixture of one part bis-maleimidohexane is made with two parts peptide monomer in DMF (3.3mL/mM peptide) followed by addition to 0.1 ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature and is usually completed within 30 min. The resulting bis-<br><br>
succinimidohexane peptide dimer is purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC. After lyophilization the material is a fluffy, white powder.<br>
Covalently linked adducts of the Formula I-L-Ab may be prepared by utilizing homo-bifunctional linking reagents (wherein the two reactive moieties are the same), such as, for example, disuccinimidyl tartrate, disuccinimidyl suberate, ethylene glycolbis-(succinimidyl succinate), l,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene ("DFNB"), 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene ("DIDS"), and bis-maleimidohexane ("BMH"). The linking reaction occurs randomly between the Ab and a compound of Formula 1 having a peptidyl moiety as part of at least on substituent on A or B of Formula I.<br>
Alternatively, hetero-bifunctional linking reagents may be employed.<br>
Such agents include, for example, Af-succinimidyI-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate<br>
("SPDP"), sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(p-azidosalicylamido)ethyM-3'-dithiopropionate<br>
("SASD", Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL), Af-maleimidobenzoyl-N-<br>
hydroxy-succinimidyl ester ("MBS"), m-maleimidobenzoylsulfosuccinimide<br>
ester ("sulfo-MBS"), Af-succinimidyl(4-iodoacetyl)aminobenzoate ("SIAB"),<br>
succinimidyl 4-(A'-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-l -carboxylate ("SMCC"),<br>
succinimidyl-4-(p-maleimidophenyl)butyrate ("SMPB"), sulfosuccinimidyl(4-<br>
iodoacetyl)amino-benzoate ("sulfo-SIAB"), sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-<br>
maleimidomethytycyclohexane-1 -carboxylate	("sulfo-SMCC"),<br>
sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(p-maleimidophenyl)-butyrate ("sulfo-SMPB"), bromoacetyl-p-aminobenzoyl-N*-hydroxy-succinimidyl ester, iodoacetyl-A^ hydroxysuccinimidyl ester, and the like.<br>
For hetero-bifunctional linking, a compound of Formula I is derivatized with, for example, the W-hydroxysuccinimidyl portion of the bifunctional reagent, and the resulting derivatized compound is purified by chromatography. Next, a suitable tumor-specific Mab is reacted with the second functional group of the bifunctional linking reagent, assuring a directed sequence of binding between components of the desired adduct<br>
Typical hetero-bifunctional linking agents for forming protein-protein conjugates have an amino-reactive W-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS-ester) as one functional group and a sulfhydryl reactive group as the other functional group. First, epsilon-amino groups of surface lysine residues of either the Mab<br><br>
or the Formula I compound are acylated with the NHS-ester group of the cross-linking agent. The remaining component, possessing free sulfhydryl groups, is reacted with the sulfhydryl reactive group of the cross-Unking agent to form a covaiently cross-linked dimer. Common thiol reactive groups include for example, maleimides, pyridyl disulfides, and active halogens. For example, MBS contains a NHS-ester as the amino reactive group, and a maleimide moiety as the sulfhydryl reactive group.<br>
Photoactive hetero-bifunctional linking reagents, e.g., photoreactive phenyl azides, may also be employed. One such reagent, SASD, may be linked to either a Mab or to a Formula I compound wherein at least one substituent on A or B comprises a peptidyl moiety, via its NHS-ester group. The conjugation reaction is carried out at pH 7 at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Molar ratios between about 1 and about 20 of the cross-linking agent to the compounds to be linked may be used.<br>
Numerous bifunctional linkers, useful as linkers (-L-), exist which have been used specifically for coupling small molecules to monoclonal antibodies, and many of these are commercially available. Examples include N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionate (SPDP), 2-iminothiolane (2-IT), 3-(4-carboxam idopheny Id ith io)prop ionth ioim idate (CDPT), AT-succinim idy 1-acetylthioacetate (SATA), ethyl-S-acetyl-propionthioimidate (AMPT) and N-succinimidyl-3-(4-carboxamidophenyldithio)propionate (SCDP). Procedures for preparation of immunoconjugates using these linkers is detailed in Toxin-Targeted Design for Anticancer Therapy. II: Preparation and Biological Comparison of Different Chemically Linked Gelonin-Antibody Conjugates (Cartel, et al, J. Pharm. Sci., 82:7, p699-704, 1993), (the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference).<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention the antibody comprises a tumor-specific antibody, more preferably a tumor-specific monoclonal antibody or a tumor-specific monospecific polyclonal antibody.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies may be advantageously cleaved by proteolytic enzymes to generate fragments retaining the antigen-binding site. For example, proteolytic treatment of IgG antibodies with papain at neutral pH generates two identical fragments, termed "Fab" fragments, each containing one intact light<br><br>
chain disulfide-bonded to a fragment of the heavy chain (Fd). Each Fab fragment contains one antigen-combining site. The remaining portion of the IgG molecule is a dimer known as "Fc". Similarly, pepsin cleavage at pH 4 results in the fragment, termed a F(ab')2 fragment.<br>
Methods for preparation of such fragments are known to those skilled in the art. See, Coding, Monoclonal Antibodies Principles and Practice, Academic Press (1983), p. 119-123. Fragments of the anti-DBF-MAF monoclonal antibodies containing the antigen binding site, such as Fab and F(ab')2 fragments, may be preferred in therapeutic applications, owing to their reduced immunogenicity. Such fragments are less immunogenic than the intact antibody, which contains the immunogenic Fc portion.<br>
The effects of sensitization in the therapeutic use of animal origin monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of human disease may be diminished by employing a hybrid molecule generated from the same Fab fragment, but a different PC fragment, than contained in Mab's previously administered to the same subject.  It is contemplated that such hybrid molecules formed from the monoclonal antibodies of the invention may be used in therapy. The effects of sensitization are  further diminished by preparing animal/human chimeric antibodies, e.g., mouse/human chimeric antibodies, or humanized (i.e. CDR-grafted) antibodies.   Such monoclonal antibodies comprise a variable region, i.e., antigen binding region, and a constant region derived from different species. Chimeric animal-human monoclonal antibodies may be prepared by conventional recombinant DNA and gene transfection techniques well known in the art. The variable region genes of a mouse antibody-producing myeloma cell line   of   known   antigen-binding    specificity   are   joined    with    human immunoglobulin constant region genes.    When such gene constructs are transfected into mouse myeloma cells, antibodies are produced which are largely human but contain antigen-binding specificities generated in mice.  As demonstrated by Morrison et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81, 6851-6855, 1984, both chimeric heavy chain V region exon (VH)-human heavy chain C region genes and chimeric mouse light chain V region exon (V*)-human * light chain gene constructs may be expressed when transfected into mouse myeloma cell lines. When both chimeric heavy and light chain genes are transfected into<br><br>
the same myeloma cell, an intact H2L2 chimeric antibody is produced. The methodology for producing such chimeric antibodies by combining genomic clones of V and C region genes is described in the above-mentioned paper of Morrison el al., and by Boulianne et al., Nature 312, 642-646, 1984. Also see Tan et al., J. Immunol. 135, 3564-3567, 1985 for a description of high level expression from a human heavy chain promotor of a human-mouse chimeric * chain after transfection of mouse myeloma cells. As an alternative to combining genomic DNA, cDNA clones of the relevant V and C regions may be combined for production of chimeric antibodies, as described by Whitte et al., Protein Eng. \, 499-505, 1987 and Liu et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 3439-3443, 1987.<br>
For examples of the preparation of chimeric antibodies, see the following U. S. Patents: 5,292,867; 5,091,313; 5,204,244; 5,202,238; and 5,169,939. The entire disclosures of these patents, and the publications mentioned in the preceding paragraph, are incorporated herein by reference. Any of these recombinant techniques are available for production of rodent/human chimeric anti-DBP-MAF monoclonal antibodies.<br>
To   further   reduce   the   immunogenicity   of   murine   antibodies,<br>
"humanized" antibodies have been constructed in which only the minimum<br>
necessary  parts of the mouse antibody, the complementarity-determining<br>
regions (CDRs), are combined with human V region frameworks and human C<br>
regions (Jones et al., Nature 321, 522-525, 1986; Verhoeyen et al, Science 239,<br>
1534-1536, 1988; Reichmann et al, 322, 323-327, 1988; Hale et al, Lancet 2,<br>
1394-1399, 1988; Queen et al, Proc. Natl Acad Sci. USA 86, 10029-10033,<br>
1989).   The entire disclosures of the aforementioned papers are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.  This technique results in the reduction of the xcnogeneic<br>
elements in the humanized antibody to a minimum.   Rodent antigen binding<br>
sites are built directly into human antibodies by transplanting only the antigen<br>
binding site, rather than the entire variable domain, from a rodent antibody.<br>
This technique is available for production of chimeric rodent/human antibodies<br>
of reduced human  immunogenicity.    Several such monoclonal antibodies,<br>
chimeric animal-human monoclonal antibodies, humanized antibodies and<br><br>
antigen-binding fragments thereof have been made available.  Some examples include:<br>
Satumomab Pendetide (by Cytogen, a murine Mab directed against TAG-72); Igovomab (by CIS Bio, a murine Mab fragment Fab2 directed against tumor-associated antigen CA 125); Arcitumomab (by Immunomedics, a murine Mab fragment Fab directed against human carcinoembryonic antigen CEA); Capromab Pentetate (by Cytogen, a murine Mab directed against tumor surface antigen PSMA); Tecnemab KJ (by Sorin, murine Mab fragments (Fab/Fab2 mix)    directed    against    HMW-MAA);    Nofetumomab    (by    Boehringer Ingelheim/NeoRx, murine Mab fragments (Fab) directed against carcinoma-associated   antigen);   Rituximab   (by  Genentech/IDEC   Pharmaceuticals,   a chimeric Mab directed against CD20 antigen on the surface of B lymphocytes); Trastuzumab (by Gen in tech, a humanized antibody directed against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2)); Votumumab (by Organon Teknika, a human Mab directed against cytokeratin tumor-associated antigen); Ontak (by Seragen/Ligand Pharmaceuticals, an IL-2-diphtheria toxin fusion protein that targets cells displaying a surface IL-2 receptor); IMC-C225 (by Imclone, a chimerized monoclonal antibody that binds to EGFR); LCG-Mab (by Cytoclonal Pharmaceutics Monoclonal antibody directed against lung cancer gene LCG) ABX-EGF (by Abgenix, a fully human monoclonal antibody against the   epidermal   growth   factor   receptor   (EGFr));   and   Epratuzumab   (by Immunomedics, a humanized, anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody).<br>
Hence, compounds of Formula I can readily be covalently bonded to antibodies, preferably tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mab) via a suitable bifunctional linker (-L-) to yield a conjugate of general Formula, I-L-Ab. In addition, compounds of Formulae le, Iz and IA can be covalently bonded to antibodies (Ab), preferably tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mab) via a suitable bifunctional linker (-L-) to yield conjugates of general Formula, le-L-Ab, Iz-L-Ab or lA-L-Ab. A general synthetic route for preparing compounds of the present invention of general Formula I-L-Ab is<br>
shown in Scheme 13, wherein: vL7~N"2 is a compound according to Formula I wherein at least one substituent on the A or B ring is -NHj.<br>

-Geometric and stereo isomerism in compounds of the invention<br>
E-/Z- Isomerism<br>
The a,(3-unsaturated sulfoxides of the invention are characterized by<br>
isomerism resulting from the presence of an olefinic double bond.    This<br>
isomerism is commonly referred to as cis-trans isomerism, but the more<br>
comprehensive naming convention employs E- and Z- designations.    The<br>
compounds are named according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, the IUPAC<br>
1974 Recommendations, Section  E:  Stereochemistry,  in Nomenclature of<br>
Organic Chemistry, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, NY, 4th ed., 1992, p.<br>
127-138, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference. Using<br>
this system of nomenclature, the four groups about a double bond are prioritized<br>
according to a series of rules.  Then, that isomer with the two higher ranking<br>
groups on the same side of the double bond is designated Z (for the German<br>
word "zusammen", meaning together).   The other isomer, in which the two<br>
higher-ranking groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, is designated E<br>
(for the German word "entgegen", which means "opposite").  Thus if the four<br>
groups on a carbon-carbon double bond are ranked, A being the lowest rank and<br>
D being highest, A&gt; B&gt;C&gt; D, the isomers would be named as in Scheme 14.<br>
B<br>
Z configuration	E configuration<br>
Scheme 14<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, both configurations, as depicted below in Scheme 15, and mixtures thereof, are included in the scope of "a,(3-unsaturated sulfoxides."<br><br>
B. Optica) Isomerism<br>
The present invention is also directed to isolated optical isomers of compounds according to Formula I. The isomers resulting from the presence of a chiral center comprise a pair of nonsuperimposable isomers that are called "enantiomers." Single enantiomers of a pure compound are optically active, i.e., they are capable of rotating the plane of plane polarized light.     Single enantiomers are designated according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system.  See March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th Ed., (1992), p. 109. Once the priority ranking of the four groups is determined, the molecule is oriented so that the lowest ranking group is pointed away from the viewer. Then, if the descending rank order of the other groups proceeds clockwise, the molecule is designated (R) and if the descending rank of the other groups proceeds counterclockwise, the molecule is designated (S). In the example in Scheme 16, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog ranking is A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D. The lowest ranking atom, D is oriented away from the viewer.<br><br><br>

Scheme 16<br>
Sulfoxides of Formula I have at least one chiral center which is the sulfoxide sulfur atom. In addition compounds of Formula 1 wherein n is 1 and R1 is other than hydrogen potentially have a second chiral center.<br>
For the sulfoxide chiral center in compounds of the present invention, the lowest priority (an empty orbital) and the highest priority (the sulfoxide oxygen) atoms about the chiral sulfur are fixed. Thus, the absolute configuration of compounds of the invention depends on the priority ranking of the two carbon atoms bonded to the sulfoxide group as shown in Scheme 17.<br><br>
B<br><br>
Certain compounds may have more than one chiral center, e.g., n is 1 and R1 is other than -H. If a compound has more than one chiral center, diastereomeric isomerism results, as exemplified in Scheme 18.<br>
, <br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br><br><br>
 The present invention is meant to encompass diastereomers as well as their racemic and resolved, diastereomerically and enantiomerically pure forms and salts thereof. Diastereomeric pairs may be resolved by known separation techniques including normal and reverse phase chromatography, and crystallization.<br>
By "isolated optical isomer" means a compound which has been substantially purified from the corresponding optical isomer(s) of the same formula. Preferably, the isolated isomer is at least about 80%, more preferably at least 90% pure, even more preferably at least 98% pure, most preferably at least about 99% pure, by weight.<br><br>
Isolated optical isomers may be purified from racemic mixtures by well-known chiral separation techniques. According to one such method, a racemic mixture of a compound having the structure of Formula I, or a chiral intermediate thereof, is separated into 99% wt.% pure optical isomers by HPLC using a suitable chiral column, such as a member of the series of DAICEL CHIRALPAK family of columns (Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The column is operated according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Salts of compounds of the invention<br>
The compounds of the present invention may take the form of salts. The term "salts", embraces salts commonly used to form alkali metal salts and to form addition salts of free acids or free bases.   The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable salt" refers to salts which possess toxicity profiles within a range so as to have utility in pharmaceutical applications. Pharmaceutically unacceptable salts may nonetheless possess properties such as high crystallinity, which have utility in the practice of the present invention, such as for example utility in a synthetic process. Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from an inorganic acid or from an organic acid. Examples of such inorganic acids are hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, carbonic, su If uric and phosphoric acid. Appropriate organic acids may be selected from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, araliphatic, heterocyclic, carboxylic and sulfonic classes of organic acids, example of which are  formic,  acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, gluconiu, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, glucuronic, maleic, fumaric, pyruvic, aspartic, glutamic, benzoic, anthrnnilic, mesylic,   4-hydroxybenzoic,   phenylacetic,    mandeiic,   cmbonic   (pamoic), methanesulfonic,      ethanesulfonic,      benzenesulfonic,      pantothenic,      2-hydroxyethanesulfonic,  toluenesulfonic,  sulfanilic,  cyclohexylaminosulfonic, stearic, alginic, beta-hydroxybutyric, salicylic, galactaric and galacturonic acid. Examples of pharmaceutical ly unacceptable acid addition salts include, for example, perchlorates and tetrafluoroborates.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical ly acceptable base addition salts of compounds of the invention include for example, metallic salts made from calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc or organic salts made from N.N-<br><br>
dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine (A/-methyIglucamine) and procainc. Examples of pharmaceutically unacceptable salts include lithium salts and cyanate salts. All of these salts may be prepared by conventional means from the corresponding a,(3-unsaturated sulfoxide by reacting, for example, the appropriate acid or base with the compound of Formula I.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The sulfoxides of the invention may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, in combination with a pharmaceutical ly acceptable carrier. The active ingredient in such formulations may comprise from 0.1 to 99.99 weight percent. By "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" is meant any carrier, diluent or excipient which is compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered to individuals (mammals, including animals and humans) afflicted with cancer.<br>
The compounds are also useful in the treatment of non-cancer<br>
proliferative disorders, that is, proliferative disorders which are characterized by<br>
benign indications. Such disorders may also be known as "cytoproliferative" or<br>
"hyperproliferative" in that cells are made by the body at an atypically elevated<br>
rate. Such disorders include, but are not limited to, the following:<br>
hemangiomatosis in new born, secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, chronic<br>
progressive	myelodegenerative	disease,	ncurofibromatosis,<br>
ganglioncuromatosis, keloid formation, Pagets Disease of the bone, fibrocyslic disease of the breast, Peronics and Duputren's fibrosis, restenosis and cirrhosis.<br>
Administration of compounds of the invention<br>
The compounds may be administered by any route, including oral and parenteral administration. Parenteral administration includes, for example, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intranasal, rectal, intravaginal, intravesical (e.g., to the bladder), intradermal, topical or subcutaneous administration. Also contemplated within the scope of the invention is the instillation of drug in the body of the patient in a controlled formulation, with systemic or local release of the drug to occur at a later time.<br>
For example, the drug may localized in a depot for controlled release to the circulation, or for release to a local site of tumor growth.<br>
The active agent is preferably administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier selected on the basis of the selected route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The active agent may be formulated into dosage forms according to standard practices in the field of pharmaceutical preparations. See Alphonso Gennaro, ed., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., (1990) Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA. Suitable dosage forms may comprise, for example, tablets, capsules, solutions, parenteral solutions, troches, suppositories, or suspensions.<br>
For parenteral administration, the active agent may be mixed with a suitable carrier or diluent such as water, an oil (particularly a vegetable oil), ethanol, saline solution, aqueous dextrose (glucose) and related sugar solutions, glycerol, or a glycol such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol. Solutions for parenteral administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active agent. Stabilizing agents, antioxidizing agents and preservatives may also be added. Suitable antioxidizing agents include sulfite, ascorbic acid, citric acid and its salts, and sodium EDTA. Suitable preservatives include benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propyl-paraben, and chlorbutanol. The composition for parenteral administration may take the form of an aqueous or nonaqueous solution, dispersion, suspension or emulsion.<br>

For example, the active agent may be combined with at least one excipient such as fillers, binders, humectanis, disintegrating agents, solution relarders, absoiplion accelerators, wetting agents absorbents or lubricating agents. According to one tablet embodiment, the active agent may be combined with carboxymethylcellulose calcium, magnesium stearate, mannitol and starch, and then formed into tablets by conventional tableting methods.<br>
The specific dose of a compound according to the invention to obtain therapeutic benefit for treatment of a proliferative disorder will, of course, be determined by the particular circumstances of the individual patient including,<br><br>
the size, weight, age and sex of the patient, the nature and stage of the proliferative disorder, the aggressiveness of the proliferative disorder, and the route of administration of the compound.<br>
For example, a daily dosage of from about 0.05 to about 50 mg/kg/day may be utilized. Higher or lower doses are also contemplated.<br>
Radioprotection<br>
The compounds of the invention are further believed useful in the protection of normal cells from the cytotbxic and genetic effects of exposure to radiation, in individuals who have incurred, who will in the future incur and who are at risk for incurring exposure to ionizing radiation.<br>
/7&gt;<br>
The specific dose of compound according to the invention to obtain therapeutic benefit for radioprotection will, be determined by the particular circumstances of the individual patient including, the size, weight, age and sex of the patient, the type, dose and timing of the ionizing radiation, and the route of administration of the compound of the invention.<br>
For example, a daily dosage of from about 0.05 to about 50 mg/kg/day may be utilized. Higher or lower doses are also contemplated.<br>
Exposure to radiation by an individual may comprise therapeutic radiation administered to the individual or in some indications, to bone marrow removed from the individual.<br>
An individual may also be exposed to ionizing radiation from occupational or environmental sources, as discussed in the background section. For purposes of the invention, the source of the radiation is not as important as the type (i.e., acute or chronic) and dose level absorbed by the individual. It is understood that the following discussion encompasses ionizing radiation exposures from both occupational and environmental sources.<br>
Individuals suffering from effects of acute or chronic exposure to ionizing radiation that are not immediately fatal are said to have remediable radiation damage. Such remediable radiation damage can be reduced or eliminated by the compounds and methods of the present invention.<br>
An acute dose of ionizing radiation which may cause remediable radiation damage includes a localized or whole body dose, for example, between<br>
about 10,000 millirem (0.1 Gy) and about 1,000,000 millirem (10 Gy) in 24 hours or less, preferably between about 25,000 millirem (0.25 Gy) and about 200,000 (2 Gy) in 24 hours or less, and more preferably between about 100,000 millirem (I Gy) and about 150,000 millirem (1.5 Gy) in 24 hours or less.<br>
A chronic dose of ionizing radiation which may cause remediable radiation damage includes a whole body dose of about 100 millirem (.001 Gy) to about 10,000 millirem (0.1 Gy), preferably a dose between about 1000 millirem (.01 Gy) and about 5000 millirem (.05 Gy) over a period greater than 24 hours, or a localized dose of 15,000 millirem (0.15 Gy) to 50,000 millirem (0.5 Gy) over a period greater than 24 hours.<br>
Radioprotection: Therapeutic Ionizing Radiation<br>
For radioprotective administration to individuals receiving therapeutic ionizing radiation, the compounds of the invention should be administered far enough in advance of the therapeutic radiation such that the compound is able to reach the normal cells of the individual in sufficient concentration to exert a radioprotective effect on the normal cells. The pharmacokinetics of specific compounds may be determined by means known in the art and tissue levels of a compound in a particular individual may be determined by conventional analyses.<br>
The compound may be administered as much as about 24 hours, preferably no more than about 18 hours, prior to administration of the radiation. In one embodiment, the therapy is administered at least about 3-12 hours before administration of the therapeutic radiation. Most preferably, the compound is administered once at about 18 hours and again at about 6 hours before the radiation exposure.<br>
One or more a,(3-unsaturated sulfoxides may be administered simultaneously, or different a,p-unsaturated sulfoxides may be administered at different times during the treatment.<br>
Where the therapeutic radiation is administered in serial fashion, it is preferable to intercalate the administration of one or more radioprotective compounds within the schedule of radiation treatments. As above, different radioprotective compounds of the invention may be administered either<br><br>
	-simultaneously or at different times during the treatment. Preferably, an about 24-hour period separates administration of the radioprotective compound and the   therapeutic   radiation.      More  preferably,   the   administration   of the radioprotective compound and the therapeutic radiation is separated by about 6 to 18 hours. This strategy will yield significant reduction of radiation-induced side effects without affecting the anticancer activity of the therapeutic radiation. For example, therapeutic radiation at a dose of 0.1 Gy may be given daily for five consecutive days, with a two-day rest, for a total period of 6 - 8 weeks.   One or more a,(3-unsaturated sulfoxides may be administered to the individual 18 hours previous to each round of radiation.   It should be pointed out, however, that more aggressive treatment schedules, i.e., delivery of a higher dosage, is contemplated according to the present invention due to the protection of the normal cells afforded by the radioprotective compounds.   Thus, the radioprotective effect of the compound increases the therapeutic index of the therapeutic radiation, and may permit the physician to safely increase the dosage of therapeutic radiation above presently recommended levels without risking increased damage to the surrounding normal cells and tissues.<br>
Radioprofection: Radiation-treated Bone Marrow<br>
The radioprotective compounds of the invention are further useful in protecting normal bone marrow cells from radiologic treatments designed to destroy hematologic neoplastic cells or tumor cells which have metastasized into the bone marrow. Such cells include, for example, myeloid leukemia cells. The appearance of these cells in the bone marrow and elsewhere in the body is associated with various disease conditions, such as the French-American-British (FAB) subtypes of acute myelogenous leukemias (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).<br>
CML, in particular, is characterized by abnormal proliferation of immature granulocytes (e.g., neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, liver, and other tissues and accumulation of granulocytic precursors in these tissues. The individual who presents with such symptoms will typically have more than 20,000 white blood cells per microliter of blood, and the count may exceed 400,000. Virtually all CML patients will<br><br>
develop "blast crisis", the terminal stage of the disease during which immature blast cells rapidly proliferate, leading to death.<br>
Other individuals suffer from metastatic tumors, and require treatment with total body irradiation (TBI). Because TBI will also kill the individual's hematopoietic cells, a portion of the individual's bone marrow is removed prior to irradiation for subsequent reimplantation. However, metastatic tumor cells are likely present in the bone marrow, and reimplantation often results in a relapse of the cancer within a short time.<br>
Individuals presenting with neoplastic diseases of the bone marrow or metastatic tumors may be treated by removing a portion of the bone marrow (also called "harvesting"), purging the harvested bone marrow of malignant stem cells, and reimplanting the purged bone marrow. Preferably, the individual is treated with radiation or some other anti-cancer therapy before the autologous purged bone marrow is reimplanted.<br>
Thus, the invention provides a method of reducing the number of malignant cells in bone marrow, comprising the steps of removing a portion of the individual's bone marrow, administering an effective amount of at least one radioprotective compound according to the present invention and irradiating the treated bone marrow with a sufficient dose of ionizing radiation such that malignant cells in the bone marrow are killed. As used herein, "malignant cell" means any uncontrollably proliferating cell, such a tumor cell or neoplastic cell. The radioprotective compounds protect the normal hematopoietic cells present in the bone marrow from the deleterious effects of the ionizing radiation. The compounds also exhibit a direct killing effect on the malignant cells. The number of malignant cells in the bone marrow is significantly reduced prior to reimplantation, thus minimizing the occurrence of a relapse.<br>
Preferably, each ct,(3-unsaturated sulfoxide is administered to the bone marrow in a concentration from about 0.25 to about 100 micromolar; more preferably, from about 1.0 to about 50 micromolar; in particular from about 2.0 to about 25 micromolar. Particularly preferred concentrations are 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 micromolar and 5, 10 and 20 micromolar. Higher or lower concentrations may also be used.<br><br>
The radioprotective compounds may be added directly to the harvested bone marrow, but are preferably dissolved in an organic solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Pharmaceutical compositions of cc,3-unsaturated sulfoxides such as are described in more detail below may also be used.<br>
Preferably, the radioprotective compound is added to the harvested bone marrow about 20 hours prior to radiation exposure, preferably no more than about 24 hours prior to radiation exposure. In one embodiment, the radioprotective compound is administered to the harvested bone marrow at least about 6 hours before radiation exposure. One or more compounds may be administered simultaneously, or different compounds may be administered at different times. Other dosage regimens are also contemplated.<br>
If the individual is to be treated with ionizing radiation prior to reimplantation of the purged bone marrow, the individual may be treated with one or more radioprotective compounds prior to receiving the ionizing radiation dose, as described above.<br>
Radioprotection: Environmental or Occupational Radiation Exposure<br>
The invention also provides a method for treating individuals who have incurred remediable radiation damage from acute or chronic exposure to ionizing radiation, comprising reducing or eliminating the cytotoxic effects of radiation exposure on normal cells and tissues by administering an effective amount of at least one radioprotective compound. The compound is preferably administered in as short a time as possible following radiation exposure, for example between 0-6 hours following exposure.<br>
Remediable rudiution damage may take the form of cytotoxic and genotoxic (i.e., adverse genetic) effects in the individual. In another embodiment, there is therefore provided a method of reducing or eliminating the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of radiation exposure on normal cells and tissues, comprising administering an effective amount of at least one radioprotective compound prior to acute or chronic radiation exposure. The compound may be administered, for example about 24 hours prior to radiation exposure, preferably no more than about IS hours prior to radiation exposure. In one embodiment, the compound is administered at least about 6 hours before<br><br>
radiation exposure. Most preferably, the compound is administered at about 18 and again at about 6 hours before the radiation exposure. One or more radioprotective compounds may be administered simultaneously, or different radioprotective compounds may be administered at different times.<br>
When multiple acute exposures are anticipated, the radioprotective compounds of the invention may be administered multiple times. For example, if fire or rescue personnel must enter contaminated areas multiple times, radioprotective compounds of the invention may be administered prior to each exposure. Preferably, an about 24-hour period separates administration of the compound and the radiation exposure. More preferably, the administration of radioprotective compounds and the radiation exposure is separated by about 6 to 18 hours. It is also contemplated that a worker in a nuclear power plant may be administered an effective amount of a radioprotective compound of the invention prior to beginning each shift, to reduce or eliminate the effects of exposure to ionizing radiation.<br>
If an individual is anticipating chronic exposure to ionizing radiation, the radioprotective compound may be administered periodically throughout the duration of anticipated exposure. For example, a nuclear power plant worker or a soldier operating in a forward area contaminated with radioactive fallout may be given the radioprotective compound every 24 hours, preferably every 6-18 hours, in order to mitigate the effects of radiation damage. Likewise, the radioprotective compound may be periodically administered to civilians living in areas contaminated by radioactive fallout until the area is decontaminated or the civilians are removed to a safer environment.<br>
Chemoprotection<br>
The compounds of the invention are believed useful in protecting individuals from the cytotoxic side effects of chemotherapeutic agents, particularly mitotic phase cell cycle inhibitors and topoisomerase inhibitors, used in the treatment of cancer and other proliferative disorders.<br>
The specific dose of a compound according to the invention to obtain therapeutic benefit for chemoprotection will be determined by the particular circumstances of the individual patient including, the size, weight, age and sex<br><br>
of the patient, the type and dose of the administered chemotherapy, the nature and stage and cell damage, and the route of administration of the compound of the invention.<br>
For example, a daily dosage of from about 0.05 to about 50 mg/kg/day may be utilized. Higher or lower doses are also contemplated.<br>
For providing cytoprotection from cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents, the schedule of administration of the cytotoxic drug, i.e., mitotic phase cell cycle inhibitor or topoisomerase inhibitor, can be any schedule with the stipulation that the a,(3-unsaturated sulfoxide is administered prior to the cytotoxic drug. The cytoprotective compound should be administered far enough in advance of the cytotoxic drug such that the former is able to reach the normal cells of the patient in sufficient concentration to exert a cytoprotective effect on the normal cells. Again, individual drug pharmacokinetics and blood levels of a specific drug in a specific patient are factors that may be determined by methods known in the art.<br>
The cytoprotective compound is administered at least about 1 hour, preferably, at least about 2 hours, and more preferably, at least about 4 hours, before administration of the cytotoxic drug. The compound may be administered as much as about 48 hours, preferably no more than about 36 hours, prior to administration of the cytotoxic drug. Most preferably, the compound is administered about 24 hours before the cytotoxic drug. The compound may be administered more or less than 24 hours before the cytotoxic tiffed, but the protective effect of the compounds is greatest when administered about 24 hours before the cytotoxic drug. One or more cytotoxic drugs may be administered. Similarly, one or more of the a,(3-unsaturated sulfoxides may be combined.<br>
Where the cytotoxic drug or drugs is administered in serial fashion, it may prove practical to intercalate cytoprotective compounds of the invention within the schedule with the caveat that a 4-48 hour period, preferably a 12-36 hour period, most preferably a 24 hour period, separates administration of the two drug types. This strategy will yield partial to complete eradication of cytotoxic drug side effects without affecting anticancer activity.<br><br>
For example, the mitotic inhibitor may be given daily, or every fourth day, or every twenty-first day. The a,p-unsaturated sulfoxide may be given 24 hours previous to each round of inhibitor administration, both as a cytoprotective agent and as an antitumor agent.<br>
The practice of the invention is illustrated by the following non-limiting examples. In each of the following examples, the sulfinyl acetic acid compound A-CH2-SO-CH2-COOH is made according to Part A of General Procedure 1: Synthesis of (E)-a,P Unsaturated Sulfoxides, above. The (2)-sulfide intermediates are made according to Part A of General Procedure 2: Synthesis of (Z)-a,p Unsaturated Sulfoxides, above. The final (Â£)- and (2)-sulfoxide compounds A-(CHR')n-SO-CH=CH-B are recrystallized from 2-propanol and the purity is ascertained by HPLC.<br>

Step A. General Preparation of BenTylthioaeetic acids lla-d.<br>
To a cold (about 0Â° C) solution of sodium hydroxide (40 g, 1 mol) in methanol (500 mL) was added thioglycollic acid (46 g, 0.5 mol) slowly over 30 minutes. A solid precipitate of sodium thioglycollatc formed. The precipitate was dissolved by stirring and warming the mixture to about 50Â° C. After dissolution of the precipitated sodium thioglycollate, the resulting solution was cooled to room temperature (25Â° C). To the cooled solution was added the substituted benzyl chloride (10a. lOb, IQc or 10d) (Â°-5 mol) portionwise at a rate wherein the temperature of the resulting mixture was kept below 40Â° C during the addition. When the addition of the substituted benzyl chloride was<br>
complete, the resulting mixture was warmed to reflux and maintained at reflux temperature for 2 hours. The hot mixture was then cooled to room temperature (25Â° C) and poured onto crushed ice (1 Kg) containing hydrochloric acid (12M, 100 mL). A white precipitate formed. The precipitate was filtered, washed with ice cold water (3 x 100 mL) and dried under vacuum to yield the desired benzylthioacetic acid (lla. lib, lie or lid).<br>
Step B. General Preparation of Benzylsulfmylacetic acids 12a-12d.<br>
To a vigorously stirred solution of sodium hydroxide (3 g, 0.076 mol) in deionized water (150 mL) was added a substituted benzylthioacetic acid (lla. lib, lie or lid) prepared according to Step A (0.058 mol).   The resulting suspension was stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature (25Â° C). To the stirred solution was added sodium bicarbonate (39.25 g, 0.467 mol) and acetone (49 mL).   The resulting mixture was cooled to about 1 Â°C.   To the cooled solution was added a solution of potassium peroxymonosulfate (0.038 mol) dissolved in aqueous ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (123 mL of 0.004M solution) over 10 min to form a reaction mixture as a suspension. The reaction temperature was kept below 5Â° C during the addition of the potassium peroxymonosulfate solution. The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 min.  The reaction was then quenched by the addition of aqueous sodium bisulfite (14.7 g in 30 mL water) at 2Â° C.   The quenched reaction mixture was acidified by addition of aqueous HC1 (6N, 88 mL). Sodium chloride (73.6 g) was added to the acidified reaction mixture and the resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 75 mL). The ethyl acetate extracts were combined and washed with deionized water (50 mL) and brine (50 mL), and then dried over anhydrous MgSC&gt;4. The dried extract was filtered and concentrated under vacuum to yield the desired substituted benzyl sulfonylacetic acid compounds (yield 64-73%). Compound 12a:   m.p = 110-111Â° C.   Compound 12b:   m.p. = 142-146Â° C. Compound 12c: m.p. = 144-146 Â°C. Compound 12d: m.p. = 124-126Â° C.<br>
Step C. General Preparation of Compounds of Examples 29-32.<br>
To a solution of a substituted benzylsulfinylacetic acid (12a. 12b. 12c or 12d) prepared according to Step B (10 mmol) in toluene (100 mL, 25Â° C) was added catalytic amounts of piperidine (0.1 mL) and benzoic acid (134 mg). To<br><br>
the resulting mixture was added a substituted benzaldehyde 13a or 13b (10 mmol) to form a reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was warmed to reflux temperature and maintained at reflux for 6 hours in a reaction vessel equipped with Dean-Stark trap. After 6 hours, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature (25Â° C). The cooled reaction mixture was washed successively with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (3 x 30 mL), saturated aqueous sodium bisulfite (1 x 40 mL), aqueous hydrochloric acid (IN, 1 x 40 mL), and water (1 x 60 mL). The toluene layer was dried over anhydrous sodium suifate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum to yield a solid residue. The solid residue obtained after concentration was purified by crystallization or by silica gel column chromatography to yield the following desired compounds as listed in Table 6.<br>

B.	Treatment with Sulfoxides and Viability Assay<br>
The effect of the a,p-unsaturated sulfoxides according to Formula I on tumor cells of prostate, colon, lung and breast origin was examined by utilizing the following cell lines: prostate tumor cell line DU-145; colorectal carcinoma cell line DLD-1; non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line HI57; and breast tumor cell line BT-20. BT-20 is an estrogen-unresponsive cell line. BT-20, DLD-1 and HI57 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. DU145 was cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum containing penicillin and streptomycin. NIH/3T3 (normal murine fibroblasts) and HFL-i cells (normal diploid human lung fibroblasts) were grown in DMEM containing 10% calf serum supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin.<br>
Cells were plated at density levels of 1.0 x If)5 cells per well in six-well plates. Cell cultures were maintained at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.<br>
Cells were treated with compounds of the invention at doses ranging from 10 nM to 5 jiM concentration, and cell viability was determined after 96 hours by the Trypan blue exclusion method.<br>

Example 36:   Radioprotective   Effect   of   a.B-Unsaturated   Sulfoxides   on Cultured Normal Human Cells:<br>
The radioprotective effect of a,p-unsaturated sulfoxides on cultured normal cells is evaluated as follows.<br>
HFL-1 cells are plated into 24 well dishes at a cell density of 3000 cells per 10 mm2 in DMEM completed with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. a,p-Unsaturated sulfoxide test compound is added to the cells 24 hours later at concentrations 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 micromolar, using DMSO as a solvent. Control cells are treated with DMSO alone. The cells are exposed to the lest compound or DMSO for 24 hrs. The cells are then irradiated with either 10 Gy or 15 Gy of ionizing radiation (IR) using a J.L. Shepherd Mark I, Model 30-1 Irradiator equipped with I37cesium as a source.<br>
After irradiation, the medium on the test and control cells is removed and replaced with fresh growth medium without the test compounds or DMSO. The irradiated cells are incubated for 96 hours and duplicate wells are trypsinized and replated onto 100 mm2 tissue culture dishes. The replated cells are grown under normal conditions with one change of fresh medium for 3 weeks. The number of colonies from each 100 mm2 culture dish, which<br><br>
represents the number of surviving cells, is determined by staining the dishes as described below.<br>
To visualize and count the colonies derived from the clonal outgrowth of individual radioprotected cells, the medium is removed and the plates are washed one time with ambient temperature phosphate buffered saline. The cells are stained with a 1:10 diluted Modified Giemsa staining solution (Sigma) for 20 minutes. The stain is removed, and the plates are washed with tap water. The plates are air-dried, the number of colonies from each plate is counted and the average from duplicate plates is determined.<br>
Example 37: Effect of Exposure to Ionizing Radiation on Normal and Malignant Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Growth After Pretreatment with a.B-Unsaturated Sulfoxides of the Invention<br>
The effect of ionizing radiation on normal and malignant hematopoietic progenitor cells which are pretreated with a,p-unsaturated sulfoxides of the invention is determined by assessing cloning efficiency and development of the pretreated cells after irradiation.<br>
To obtain hematopoietic progenitor cells, human bone marrow cells (BMC) or peripheral blood cells (PB) are obtained from normal healthy, or acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia (AML, CML), volunteers by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation, and are partially enriched for hematopoietic progenitor cells by positively selecting CD34+ cells with immunomagnetic beads (Dynal A.S., Oslo, Norway). The CD34+ cells are suspended in supplemented alpha medium and incubated with mouse anti-HPCA-I antibody in 1:20 dilution, 45 minutes, at 4Â°C with gentle inverting of tubes. Cells are washed x 3 in supplemented alpha medium, and then incubated with beads coated with the Fc fragment of goat anti-mouse Igd (75 uJ of immunobeads/!07 CD34* cells). After 45 minutes of incubation (4Â°C), cells adherent to the beads are positively selected using a magnetic particle concentrator as directed by the manufacturer.<br>
2 x 104 CD34+ cells are incubated in 5 mL polypropylene tubes (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) in a total volume of 0.4 mL of Iscove's modified<br><br>
Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) containing 2% human AB serum and 10 mM Hepes buffer. oc,p-Unsaturated sulfoxide test compounds are added to the cells; in four different concentrations (0.25 uM, 0.5 u,M, 1.0 uM and 2.0 uM). Control cells receive DMSO alone. The cells are incubated for 20-24 hours and irradiated with 5 Gy or 10 Gy of ionizing radiation.<br>
Immediately after irradiation, the medium is removed and replaced with fresh medium without the test compound or DMSO. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, the treatment and control cells are prepared for plating in plasma clot or methylcellulose cultures. Cells (1 x 104 CD34+ cells per dish) are not washed before plating.<br>
Assessment of the cloning efficiency and development of the treated hematopoietic progenitor cells are carried out essentially as reported in Gewirtz et at., Science 242, 1303-1306 (1988), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Example 38:   Bone    Marrow   Purging   with    Ionizing   Radiation    After Pretreatment with q.p-Unsaturated Sulfoxides of the Invention.<br>
Bone marrow is harvested from the iliac bones of an individual under general anesthesia in an operating room using standard techniques.   Multiple aspirations are taken into heparinized syringes. Sufficient marrow is withdrawn so that the individual will be able to receive about 4 x 108 to about 8 x 10s processed marrow cells per kg of body weight. Thus, about 750 to 1000 mL of marrow is withdrawn. The aspirated marrow is transferred immediately into a transport medium (TC-199, Gibco, Grand Island, New York) containing 10,000 units of preservative-free heparin per 100 mL of medium.    The aspirated marrow is filtered through three progressively finer meshes to obtain a cell suspension devoid of cellular aggregates, debris and bone particles.     The filtered marrow is then processed further into an automated cell separator (e.g., Cobe 2991  Cell Processor) which prepares a "buffy coat" product, (i.e., leukocytes devoid of red cells and platelets). The buffy coat preparation is then placed in a transfer pack for further processing and storage. It may be stored until purging in liquid nitrogen using standard procedures.    Alternatively,<br>
purging can be carried out immediately, then the purged marrow may be stored frozen in liquid nitrogen until it is ready for transplantation.<br>
The purging procedure is carried out as follows. Cells in the buffy coat preparation are adjusted to a cell concentration of about 2 x 107/mL in TC-199 containing about 20% autologous plasma. a.p-Unsaturated sulfoxides of the invention, for example, at concentrations of from 0.25 fiM to 2.0 f^M are added to the transfer packs containing the cell suspension and incubated in a 37Â° C waterbath for 20-24 hours with gentle shaking. The transfer packs are then exposed to 5-10 Gy ionizing radiation. Recombinant human hematopoietic growth factors, e.g., rH IL-3 or rH GM-CSF, may be added to the suspension to stimulate growth of hematopoietic neoplasms and thereby increase their sensitivity to ionizing radiation.<br>
The cells may then either be frozen in liquid nitrogen or washed once at 4Â°C in TC-199 containing about 20% autologous plasma. Washed cells are then infused into the individual. Care must be taken to work under sterile conditions wherever possible and to maintain scrupulous aseptic techniques at all times.<br>
