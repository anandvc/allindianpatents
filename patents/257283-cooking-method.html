				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a cooking method, and more particularly, to a heating method that effectively cooks foodstuffs subject to foodstuffs' properties, assuring foodstuffs safety and saving energy.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Following the progress of human civilization, fine culture of food and drink is developed.<br>
To fit different time schedules and to satisfy different cooking requirements, "slow cooker" and "stew-pot" cooking methods are developed.<br>
Slow cooker is a cooking method to cook food using a small power when one is going to sleep at night or to work outdoors at daytime so that one can enjoy the food when wakes up in the morning or returns home after working. Traditionally, the heating power used in a slow cooker is subject to the designed cooking time, for example, 4 hours, 6 hours or 8 hours. Normally, the heating power for slow cooker is about 250W, or one half of a regular electric rice cooker. However, this traditional design does not meet certain cooking requirements, and a person employing this method may be unable to have food be well cooked or may cause food to be excessively cooked. When cooking food at a low heating temperature, for example, within 20~50°C, for a long period, microbes may grow on the cooking food. To understand the accurate design principle of slow cooker, the cooking object and properties of food must be studied at first.<br>
The heating process during cooking is primarily to kill bacteria and<br><br>
microbes that are harmful to human body, and secondarily to convert food into an eatable condition for absorption by human beings.<br>
Normally, microbes stop movement when at 60°C (140°F). However, harmful microbes on food will be killed only when the temperature reaches 74°C. The temperature range within 15°C~52°C is the most dangerous range where microbes grow fast. Foods will start to deteriorate when keeping under this dangerous temperature range for long. Heating cannot eliminate toxic substances produced by microbes.<br>
Therefore, when employing a slow cooker cooking method, the initial heating power must be able to heat the cooker (cooking pan) to the safety temperature level to stop microbes stop from movement within a predetermined time period. Normally, the cooker shall reach 60°C (140°F) within 2 hours after start of the slow cooker cooking method. Except the reason of food safety, heating can convert foods into an eatable form for easy absorption by human beings. For example, cooking by heating can soften meat and decompose starch from a crystal structure into absorptive gel. Further, tough meat is not easy to be thoroughly cooked. Actually, tough meat contains a big amount of collagen that starts to decompose into gel-like condition and to dissolve in water when heated to 60°C~65°C. This process requires time; however it is not necessary to heat to the boiling status. Therefore, slow cooker cooking method is very suitable for cooking certain meat, more particularly, beef shank, to a softened status.<br>
Cooking foods of starch group, such as rice, corn and etc., requires a relatively higher heating temperature, about 65°C~93°C so that contained starch can be thoroughly cooked into a gel-like condition.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been accomplished under the circumstances in view. A cooking method in accordance with the present invention is designed subject to the following rules:<br>
1.	At the initial stage, the heating temperature must reach the safety<br>
temperature level within 2 hours so as to stop microbes from movement. In<br>
consideration of environmental factors and engineering tolerance, the temperature can<br>
be set within 65°C~75°C.<br>
2.	Adjust the highest temperature subject to the type of foods to be cooked,<br>
for example, 85°C for cooking meat to assure complete killing of microbes and well<br>
cooking of meat, or 95°C for cooking cereal foods.<br>
3.	Cooker is designed to have excellent heat isolating and keeping effects,<br>
lowering heat dissipation speed and saving energy consumption. Conventional<br>
cookers for slow cooker cooking commonly use 250W heater. When operating<br>
continuously over 4 hours, a conventional cooker consumes about IKW-hr, and the<br>
major part of the thermal energy is dissipated from the cooker. However, this heat<br>
dissipation function is necessary; otherwise the cooker cannot have the foods reach<br>
the safety temperature level within a reasonable time without causing the foods to be<br>
excessively cooked. Applying a slow cooker cooking method consumes much energy,<br>
about twice of a regular cooking method. To save energy consumption, conventional<br>
slow cooker cooking methods and cookers for slow cooker cooking must be modified.<br>
When reached the set temperature during cooking, the heat power should be lowered to a level slightly lower that the heat dissipation speed of the cooker to have the internal temperature of the cooker be lowered slowly to a predetermined temperature-maintaining level, for example, 65°C, avoiding excessive cooking of<br><br>
foods. During this temperature lowering procedure, a low heat is provided at the bottom side of the cooker so that a convection in the cooker can be maintained, assuring uniformity temperature in the cooker.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a cooking temperature-cooking time chart obtained subject to a cooking method according to the present invention.<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic circuit diagram of a heating control circuit according to the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a cooking method in accordance with the present invention includes a heating step A, a temperature-lowering step B, and a temperature-maintaining step C. The cooking apparatus to be used is designed subject to the aforesaid three steps.<br>
The cooking procedure of the cooking method shown in FIG. 1 can be controlled by means of electronic control or mechanical control. This electric heating control is obvious to any person skilled in the art. For easy understanding of the present invention, mechanical control, as shown in FIG. 2, is employed as an example. However, this embodiment is simply an example of the present invention but not a limitation.<br>
In FIG. 2, the reference sign S indicates an activation switch. When the cooker (cooking pan) is set in the cooking position, the positioning switch, referenced by P, is switched off. When the activation switch S is pressed at this time, the coil assembly CK of the relay, referenced by K, is activated, causing double pole single-<br><br>
throw switches Kl, K2 to be switched off. When operating the activation switch S, a linking device L is forced to return manual return bimetal temperature control devices T3 and T4, thereby resuming to off status. Switching off the switch K2 causes heating resistors Rl, R2, R3 to be simultaneously conducted, corresponding to activation heating mode Al in the heating step A shown in FIG. 1. When the temperature reaches 65°C, auto return bimetal temperature control devices T2 trips off, however the parallelly connected manual return bimetal temperature control device T3 remains OFF. When the temperature reaches 75°C, no microbes appear in foodstuffs, and at this time, the manual return bimetal temperature control device T4 trips off, the heating resistor R2 is switched off, and therefore the heating procedure enters a slow cooker mode (slow pan mode) A2. Because heating resistors Rl and R3 are low power heating resistors, the heating speed is slow. Therefore, the system enters the slow cooker mode at this moment. After a certain period during the slow cooker mode, the temperature rises to 85°C, and the slow cooker mode is done. At this time, the bimetal temperature control device T3 trips off, the heating resistor R3 is switched off, and therefore the system enters the temperature-lowering step B. At this time, the heating resistor Rl is maintained in operation. Because the heating resistor Rl is a lower-power heat source that provides a thermal energy smaller than the heat dissipating power of the cooker (cooking pan), the temperature of the cooker (cooking pan) is lowered slowly so that a convection is maintained in the cooker (cooking pan), keeping the temperature uniform in the cooker (cooking pan). Actually, the slow cooker mode is still running during this stage, however the consumption of power energy is low. When the temperature is lowered to 65°C, the bimetal temperature control device T2 is returned to its former position, and the system enters the temperature-maintaining step C. At this time, the 'heating resistor R3 is switched on again, maintaining the temperature around 65°C. During the temperature-lowering<br><br>
step B, it passes through the point of 85°C and the point of 75°C, however, the temperature control devices T3 and T4 do not return to the off status automatically because they are manual return bimetal temperature control devices. Therefore, the temperature control devices T3 and T4 do no work during the temperature-maintaining step C.<br>
When the cooking is done, the cooker (cooking pan) is removed from the stove, and at this time, the positioning switch P is switched off, the coil assembly CK of the relay, switches Kl, K2 are electrically disconnected, stopping the supply of power supply.<br>
The auto return bimetal temperature control devices Tl is a safety device. When the temperature reaches 95°C, the auto return bimetal temperature control devices Tl trips off, turning off power supply.<br>
Subject to the aforesaid embodiment of the present invention, the cooking method of the present invention assures well cooking of foodstuffs and high safety of cooked foodstuffs and saves consumption of energy.<br><br><br>
