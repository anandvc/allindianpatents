				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an integrated composite anthropometer adapted to measure multiple body parameters of a large population in a short span of time. Tn particular the invention relates to an integrated composite anthropometer which would be reliable and portable apart from measuring multiple dimensions of large population.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
/<br>
It is presently known to measure human body dimensions using different pieces of/ graduated scale bars. Such known devices .suffer from lack of a self-contained arrangement for measurement of body dimensions in standing as well as seated posture. Further such equipment does not provide any arrangement for measurement of strength parameters of a standing or seated subject. Also there is no provision for weighing subjects which is also essential in such conventional anthropometer devices presently in use.. Moreover the need for adjustable backrest and seat for measurement of back dimensions and other seated dimensions are not provided for and made available to the user in such conventional devices. Moreover such systems do not provide for integrated arrangement of other measuring devices such as foot size measurement, elbow angle measurement in a forehand working posture. Further such equipment, apart from being available in discreet forms also suffer from problems of comfortable disposition of subjects for effective measurement.<br>
In view of the above shortcomings of the known art of anthropometric measurements, in particular the absence of a composite anthropometer which would provide for measuring of various dimensions/strength related characteristic of human body the need was felt in the art to develop a versatile system which would take care of the above limitations of the known art and facilitate easy and comfortable as well as reliable measurement of various parameters under an integrated composite anthropometer. Moreover, the need was felt for the development of a composite anthropometer which would be capable of measuring<br>
2<br><br>
various dimensions of the body in sitting and standing posture, registering the body weight and at the same time evaluating the strength measurements Moreover apart from complexity involved in measuring various body parameters/characteristics using discreet and unrelated measuring devices the same also resulted in substantial expenses. Thus while several measuring devices serving purposes of anthropometer had been known over the years it was important to develop a composite anthropometer integrating various measuring devices which would apart from being user friendly would also be cost effective. Importantly and preferably the need was felt for a composite anthropometer, which apart from serving the above purposes would also be portable and easily transported/ carried from one place to other.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide an integrated composite anthropometer which would provide for multiple measurements of various body dimensions and / or strength in sitting as well as standing posture.<br>
It is thus the object of the present invention to provide an integrated composite anthropometer that is simple, versatile, easily adaptable and portable equipment for measurement of a large number of human body dimensions both in a seated as well as standing posture.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an integrated composite anthropometer which apart from serving the above said objectives would also have provisions for measuring foot dimensions, finger dimensions palm dimensions, and weight.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an anthropometer which would be cost effective and simple to assemble and dissemble.<br>
3<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided an easily adaptable, portable,<br>
integrated composite anthropometer comprising:<br>
(i)        a base platform;<br>
(ii)       an adjustable backrest plate and adjustable sitting means selectively disposed with<br>
respect to various measuring units such as to facilitate measuring dimensions both<br>
in standing as well as sitting posture; and (iii)      a linkage mechanism assembly adapted for strength measurement<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The integrated composite anthropometer of the present invention is a multipurpose equipment performing varied functions in a user friendly manner. It provides by way of a composite measuring system various measurements comfortably by simple variation in orientation/ disposition of the units such as carrying out the hand strength measurement, grip dimensions, finger diameter, hand stretch length and by altering the position of the various components the same can provide leg strength measurements. Measurements of various body dimensions in standing and sitting posture can be achieved from the system by adjusting the components. The said system can measure also foot dimensions, weight, skin thickness.<br>
Moreover the system of the invention is advantageously developed to facilitate easy assembling and disassembling of the various units to thereby provide for the much required portability of the unit. Importantly, the frequent switching between the bending and standing postures as adopted by conventional method for data recording is avoided by the new system. Hence it is useful in anthropometric survey of a large sample group within a short span of time. Moreover engineers and designers can utilize the generated anthropometric database for optimum design of workplace and controls for agricultural tool and machinery intended to be used by agricultural workers. Additionally the anthropometer of the present invention is cost effective.<br>
4<br><br>
The linkage assembly of the integrated composite anthropometer of the present invention comprises   of  a   handle   bar,   adjustable   frames,   hinge   connected   frames,   spring dynamometer. The handle bar of the linkage assembly is adjustable to identify the hand stretch length of the subjects. The linkage assembly may be optionally provided with grip diameter measuring device.<br>
Additionally the linkage assembly comprises of a carrying bracket, a foot pedal frame and a lever for strength measurement. These along with the handle bar and the spring dynamometer are adjusted for strength measurement of hand and leg. The pushing strength can be measured with the spring dynamometer fitted to the handle bar. The arrangement, with minor modifications, can be used to measure pulling strength and foot strength of the subjects in sitting posture<br>
The backrest plate of the integrated composite anthropometer of the present invention is adjustable by means of a pulley and rope arrangement and is provided with a transverse scale. The frame supporting the backrest plate is provided with small outside calipers for skin fold thickness measurement and the frame also supports a hinged side frame carrying a running vertical scale for measuring dimensions of the body.<br>
The graduated seat of the said integrated composite anthropometer is foldable and its height and position is adjustable to take various measurements in sitting posture.<br>
The base platform of the integrated composite anthropometer of the present invention is provided with grip diameter measuring cone and a finger diameter measuring device. The base platform is further provided with a graduated foot measuring arrangement in the middle in the form of a T shaped scale and a weighing machine.<br>
Provisions are also made to measure various breadths and girths of the body.<br>
The present invention is further explained with reference to non-limiting illustrative exemplary embodiments as per the accompanying figures:<br>
