				<td>1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a water sinking confirmation device and in particular, it relates to one to be used in a portable terminal device or the like, enabling judgment on whether or not the device has been sunk in water only by seeing a lower case.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Conventionally, as a water sinking confirmation device to be used in a portable terminal device such as a portable phone device or a PHS, one shown in FIG. 6 has been known. In FIG. 6, the water sinking confirmation device comprises an internal unit 61 with a water sinking confirmation seal 62 attached at a predetermined position, and a lower case 63 having a hole 64 formed at a predetermined position such that the water sinking confirmation seal 62 attached on the internal unit 61 is seen through a transparent sheet 65, attached together.<br>
However, since other parts of the portable terminal device are mounted on the hole 64 provided in the lower case 63 in the conventional water sinking confirmation device, it involves a problem in that the water sinking state of the water sinking confirmation seal 62 attached on the internal unit 61<br><br>
cannot be seen directly through the hole 64 formed in the lower case 63.<br>
Moreover, since the water sinking confirmation seal 62 is attached directly on a predetermined position of the internal unit 61 and the transparent sheet 65 is bonded or adhered to the lower case 63, surrounding the hole 64, the water sinking confirmation seal 62 and the transparent sheet 65 are not sealed closely, and thus a problem is involved in that the water sinking confirmation seal 62 may generate the state change when it is not sunk in water.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to solve the above problems, an object of the invention is to provide a water sinking confirmation device enabling judgment on whether or not a portable terminal device or the like has been sunk in water only by seeing a lower case.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, according to the invention, there is provided a water sinking confirmation device comprising: a lower case provided with a hole for confirming water sinking; a double side coated adhesive member for bonding both sides, surrounding the hole; a transparent sheet allowing a state change of a water sinking confirmation seal seen through from a surface thereof; and the water sinking confirmation seal including a double side coated adhesive member disposed at both ends of the transparent sheet and a white plain paper, and the white plain paper applied with red<br><br>
color printing with a water-color ink at a center thereof. BRTEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view showing the configuration of a water sinking confirmation device according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
FIG. 2 is a plan view of a water sinking confirmation seal according to the embodiment of the invention.<br>
FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view showing the configuration of the water sinking confirmation device according to the embodiment of the invention used in a portable terminal device.<br>
FIG. 4 is an exploded perspective view showing the order of assembling the water sinking confirmation device according to the embodiment of the invention.<br>
FIG. 5 is a perspective view for explaining the configuration of the invention, corresponding to a conventional configuration.<br>
FIG. 6 is a perspective view showing the configuration of the conventional water sinking confirmation device. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view showing the configuration of a water sinking confirmation device according to the invention to be used in a portable terminal device, such<br><br>
as a portable phone device or a PHS. In FIG. 1, the water sinking confirmation device comprises a lower case 2 provided with a hole 3, a double side coated adhesive member 4 for bonding both sides, surrounding the hole 3, a transparent sheet 5 for blocking entrance of water from the hole 3 and allowing the state change of a water sinking confirmation seal 10 seen through from the surface thereof, and the water sinking confirmation seal 10 including a double side coated adhesive member 6 disposed at both ends of the transparent sheet 5 and a white plain paper 7, and the white plain paper 7 applied with red color printing 8 with a water-color ink at the center. The hole 3 is formed at a position not to be covered by another part mounted on the lower case 2, for example, above a holding member 1.<br>
FIG. 2 is a plan view of the water sinking confirmation seal 10, showing the state comprising the double side coated adhesive member 6 disposed below the transparent sheet 5, capable of bonding both sides at both end portions of the transparent sheet 5, and being applied with red color printing 8 with a water-color ink at the center. Moreover, as shown in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 1, since the double side coated adhesive member 6 is provided between the white plain paper 7 and the transparent sheet 5 so as to form a gap 9, consequently water can enter from the gap 9.<br>
FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of the configuration<br><br>
of the water sinking confirmation device used in a portable terminal device, such as a portable phone device. In FIG. 3, since the water sinking confirmation device is provided in the lower case 2 on the holding member (external connector ) 1 attached on the lower part of the portable phone device, whether or not the portable terminal device, such as the portable phone device has been sunk in water can be judged only by exposing the lower case 2 . Further, the water sinking confirmation seal 10 is attached to the lower case 2 at a position below a soldering portion 12 of the holding member 1 with the main body positioned upright.<br>
FIG. 4 is an exploded perspective view showing the order of assembling the water sinking confirmation seal. In FIG. 4, the double side coated adhesive member 6 is placed and bonded on both ends of the white plain paper 7 applied with red color printing 8 with a water-color ink at the center. The transparent sheet 5 is placed and bonded on the double side coated adhesive member 6. Furthermore, the double side coated adhesive member 4 provided with a hole at the center is placed and bonded on the transparent sheet 5 . The configuration shown in FIGS. 1 and 3 can be provided by bonding the water sinking confirmation seal thus assembled with the hole of the double side coated adhesive member 4 placed around the hole 3 of the lower case 2.<br>
Therefore, since the hole 3 of the lower case 2 is<br><br>
surrounded by the double side coated adhesive member 4 and the transparent sheet 5 and thus water entering from the hole 3 of the lower case 2 can be blocked, the state of the water sinking confirmation seal 10 cannot be changed merely by moisture. Further, the water sinking confirmation seal 10 cannot be peeled off even if it is forced in from the hole 3 by mischief or the like.<br>
FIG. 5 is a view for explaining the configuration of the invention, corresponding to the conventional configuration shown in FIG. 6. In FIG. 5, the water sinking confirmation device can be placed on the holding member 1 mounted on a predetermined position of the printed board 11 when the water sinking confirmation seal 10 is put on the lower case 2 at the hole 3 thereof from below.<br>
As apparent from the above description, since the invention comprises a lower case provided with a hole for confirming water sinking, a double side coated adhesive member for bonding both sides, surrounding the hole, a transparent sheet allowing the state change of a water sinking confirmation seal later described seen through from the surface thereof, and the water sinking confirmation seal including a double side coated adhesive member disposed at both ends of the transparent sheet and a white plain paper later described, and the white plain paper applied with red color printing with a water-color ink at the center, the effect of enabling judgment on whether<br><br>
or not a portable terminal device or the like has been sunk in water only by seeing the lower case can be achieved.<br><br><br>
