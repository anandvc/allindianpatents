				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to   a   depilatory strip.<br>
Depilation, particularly for cosmetic purposes, is performed by several techniques. The technique of electrolysis, electrical devices gripping and pulling out the hair, for example with the aid of rotating parts, chemical agents such as sulphite, the conventional tweezers, as well as hot and cold depilatory waxes, may be cited, for example.<br>
Cold depilatory waxes are generally applied to a thin backing in the form of a strip.   Such a wax will hereinafter be termed adhesive paste medium.<br>
Traditionally, a film of cellophane comprising a coating of polyvinyl chloride on both sides is used by way of backing for the adhesive paste medium. The adhesive paste medium is deposited directly on one of the two sides coated with polyvinyl chloride. The quality of adhesion obtained between the adhesive paste medium and the backing is therefore the result of the adhesiveness between the adhesive paste medium and the polyvinyl chloride.<br>
In addition to this first function as an adhesive surface for the adhesive paste medium, the polyvinyl chloride also acts as a barrier to prevent this adhesive paste medium from migrating through the backing film. In fact the consequences of the migration of the adhesive paste medium may be in particular the risks of undesirable bonding of the outer side of the strip, that is to say of the side opposite that on which the adhesive paste medium is deposited, or else reduced effectiveness of depilation.<br>
Such cold wax strips are used as follows: the user presses the strip firmly onto the area to be depilated, the adhesive medium being placed in the direction of the area to be depilated, then one end of the backing strip is grasped and pulled sharply away from the area to be depilated.<br>
The hairs trapped in the adhesive paste medium are therefore removed from the treated area and in principle the whole of the adhesive paste medium remains attached to the backing strip.<br>
However, quite frequently residues of adhesive paste medium remain on the depilated area,  and these very sticky residues are difficult to remove from the skin,<br><br>
particularly as the skin is often silently irritated.<br>
It would be desirable, therefore, to have depilatory strips which would leave substantially no residues stuck to the treated skin.<br>
That is why the present invention relates to a depilatory strip comprising an adhesive paste medium deposited on a backing film, characterized in that one side of the backing film of single-layer or multi-layer plastics material is joined to a non-woven fabric on which the adhesive paste medium is deposited.<br>
"Joined" means that the non-woven fabric is securely attached to the backing film for example by the techniques of extrusion coating or extrusion lamination.<br>
By way of non-woven fabric, any non-woven fabric may be used, for example polypropylene-based, particularly calendared, or particularly polyester-based, having a gram weight of between 10 and 100 g per m2-. However, non-woven fabrics having a low gram weight, of between 10 and 40 g/m2- for example are preferred, this in order to provide a better contact with the zone to be depilated, by virtue of the suppleness of the backing.<br>
Depending on the area to be depilated and on the size of the strip, the person skilled in the art will have no difficulty in selecting the quality of non-woven fabric to use.<br>
The film of plastics material joined to the non-woven fabric may be for example a single-layer film or a multi-layer film, composed mainly of ethylene copolymer or ethylene glycol-vinyl alcohol copolymer whether or not coe.xtruded with a polyethylene film, of non-orientated, mono-orientated or bi-orientated extruded polyamide in particular, of polyester, of polyethylene, of polypropylene, of bi-orientated polypropylene or of polyvinyl chloride for example. This film provides the barrier properties necessary in order to prevent any risk of bonding between the strips, which would be caused by the diffusion through the backing film of the adhesive paste medium or of one of its constituents. Films constituted by polyamide, by polyvinyl chloride or by an ethylene or ethylene glycol-vinyl alcohol copolymer are preferred.<br>
Its thickness may range for example from 5 to 50 [xm, and preferably from 10 to 30 ,um.<br><br>
As in the state of the art, the adhesive paste medium may be composed of 97% colophony resin and derivatives, with the addition of one or more colourings and perfumes.<br>
Some commercial backing films joined to a non-woven fabric are for example those marketed by the PWA-K DUFFEL Company under the references 40 766 (non-woven polyester fabric 30 g'm2- + ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer 55 g/m2) or 41 516 (non-woven polyester fabric 17 g/m- + low density polyethylene 15 gm2 + polyamide 25 um + low density polyethylene 30 gm2) respectively.<br>
Those marketed by the A.C.E. Company in particular under the reference LAMESTE CODE 300 (calendared non-woven polypropylene fabric 40 g/m2 + polyethylene 32 um) may also be cited.<br>
The outer face of the backing film may be treated to accept printing and/or an additional layer of a polymer to make it softer to the touch. The corona treatment may be cited for e.xample.<br>
The inner side of the film of plastics material, that is to say the non-woven side or the non-woven fabric, can accept a layer of an agent well known in the state of the art serving to provide a welding termed "pcelable" of two strips relative to one another.<br>
By way of agents serving to provide a weld termed "peelable" in order to allow easy separation of the two strips at the moment of use, extruded or laminated polyethylene may be cited for example, or a thermo sealable lacquer heat-sealable by means of heating jaws for example; a coating cold-sealable by pressure, deposited by photogravure may further be cited. Polyethylene, whether peel able or not, is preferably retained.<br>
Such an agent may be applied in the areas not covered with adhesive paste medium.<br>
By placing two strips face to face, a strip is obtained double-welded on either side of the adhesive medium.<br>
Such double strips have remarkable properties: running of the adhesive paste is thus prevented and these double strips retain their original clean and regular<br><br>
appearance in the event of their being subject for example to an abnormal rise in temperature during storage and/or transport.<br>
During the use of these depilation strips, the two strips can be separated easily without damage to the backing and/or to the adhesive paste medium.<br>
That is why the present application also, relates to a depilatory strip characterized in that it is constituted by rwo single strips, as defined above, welded face to face by virtue of an agent permitting hot welding or cold welding to be carried out and providing mutual peel ability between two strips, said agent being deposited on the areas of the backings not covered with adhesive paste medium, on the non-woven fabric side. Such an agent makes it possible, by virtue of its peel ability properties, to separate the two parts of the depilatory strip easily and without damaging the backing film.<br>
The depilatory strips according to the invention can be manufactured as follows:<br>
In order to produce a single strip, adhesive paste medium is deposited on a continuous film (on a roll), by spraying hot and under pressure through a calibrated nozzle which determines the width of the adhesive medium. The timing of the spray and the rate of feed of the film determine the length and the quantity of adhesive medium deposited. The strip is then covered on the adhesive medium side with a protective film easy to remove such as a silicone coated paper, and then the whole is then cut to the length required in order to obtain a single strip.<br>
In order to produce a double strip, the unitary strips being partially welded to one another, the same procedure as described above is followed except for the difference that the film is equivalent in width to two strips, and then that it is folded back onto itself after the adhesive medium has been deposited, without application of protective film. Welding if necessary by heating jaws, or by simple pressure in the case of a cold-sealable coating, takes place next, and then the cutting to the right length, as also the longitudinal cutting on the side of the part folded back, corresponding to the middle part of the original film, so as to obtain two separable strips.<br>
A further possibility for depositing the adhesive medium for the production of double strips may be to use a film having a width equivalent to one strip and to<br><br>
transfer the adhesive medium by a process of the offset type onto two parallel strips fed in synchronization. The width of the transfer roller determines the width of adhesive medium deposited and the angle of rotation of the roller determines the length of the adhesive paste medium deposited. The two strips are then placed face to face so as to obtain a separable double strip.<br>
The present invention lastly relates to the application of a strip described above to depilation, as also a depilation process characterized in that a depilatory strip as defined above is used.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a depilatory strip comprising an adhesive paste medium deposited on a backing film, characterized in that one side of the backing film of single-layer or multi-layer plastics material is joined to a non-woven fabric on which the adhesive paste medium is deposited.<br>
The invention will be better understood with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a single depilatory strip according to the invention, seen in cross-section, whereas Figures 2 and 3 show, also in cross-section, double depilatory strips according to the present invention.<br>
In Figure 1, are seen, from top to bottom, the layer of adhesive paste medium 1, then the layer of non-woven fabric 2, next the bond layer 3 necessary to join the layer of non-woven fabric with the layer of barrier film 4. Lastly, and subsidiary, there is an outer layer 5 protecting the barrier layer and making it possible to have a printed surface 6.<br><br>
In Figure 2, which shows a double depilatory strip, consisting of two single strips disposed face to face as described above, and the bond layer 3 which here serves also as a layer for welding two strips to one another, the non-woven sides are seen to be placed face to face in this assembly.<br>
In Figure 3, similar to Figure 2, a welding agent 2' is additionally seen which has been deposited directly onto the inner side of the non-woven fabric 2, in order to weld the two strips to one another.<br>
