SPECIFICATION<br>
(39 OF 1970)<br>
TITLE: VERTICAL HONING MACHINE<br>
NAME: AJIT HARIDAS SAMANI<br>
ADDRESS: KHUSHBU ENGINEERS F-24/1, M.I.D.C. SHIROLI, KOLHAPUR - 416 122 (INDIA) PH.NO. 0230 2468859<br>
NATIONALITY: INDIAN.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be manufactured.<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
1302/MUM/2004<br><br>
This invention relates to a Vertical Honing Machine. Background of the invention<br>
Honing is a relatively new industrial process. Originally it was developed for finishing or reconditioning of<br>
automobile cylinders, liners and also for correcting the shape, size and surface condition of liners.<br>
The honing process consists the following.<br>
The honing tool is mounted on the rotating spindle of the honing machine, which simultmeously<br>
reciprocates in the bore being finished. Special coolant oil is used in the honing process. The cost-effective<br>
hydraulic honing machine is designed to cater precise requirements of honing application at reasonable<br>
capital investment. This honing machine is manufactured keeping in view fast, accurate and precision<br>
honing at a minimum cost for any variety of jobs. The machine offers   all reqved features" to ease<br>
operation. The design is compact, sturdy but reliable. The set-up time is less hence it is more efficient &amp;<br>
productive.<br>
The existing machines are complex in design, highly expensive and power consuming. These machines are<br>
not maintenance friendly and occupy more space.<br>
Prior Art-<br>
It has been proposed in US 4816731 wherein controller is based on Microprocessor, Position transducer<br>
arrangement for giving digital output in accordance with the linear stroke position of the spindle with respect to work piece, with the help of this arrangement the Stroke length is set on the high end control console. The control of reciprocation motion is exercised in six phases.<br>
It has been proposed in US 4887221 wherein Controlling and setting up the operations of the controllers for the said machine tool is through a high end computer. Computer calculates the operating condition for the machine tool. The Calculations being independent of further action by the operator. The said machine control include means for adjusting the honing dia and range and therefore means to establish machine operating RPM, stroking frequency, length and operating load. It also includes work piece initial and final bore size, bore length and work piece material. The honing machine have load sensor responsive to load on the mandrel. The machine is simplified as follows-<br>
1.	The controller is programmable logic controller (PLC) instead of an computer.<br>
2.	The stroke length is set with two proximity switches physically.<br>
3.	The control of reciprocation motion is exercised through a pilot operated hydraulic Direction Control valve instead of in six phases.<br>
4.	Operating conditions for the machine tool are manually fed to PLC.<br>
5.	Machine operating RPM, stroking frequency, length and operating load are set manually on hydraulic Power Pack.<br>
6.	Load on the mandrel is set by pressure relief vale and display on Pressure dial gauge.<br>
7.	Honing head is mounted on two vertical guide bars instead of guide ways.<br><br>
8.	Stroking cylinder is mounted on the vertical wall of the Mid Steel Fabricated Body behind the honing head in between guide bar instead of guide ways.<br>
9.	Hydraulic motor is mounted axially parallel to the spindle connected by gear inside the honing head instead of Electric Motor.<br><br>
10.	Expansion cylinder is mounted on top of the honing head while push rod is fitted on Expansion cylinder rod, passes through spindle and universal link which is connected to mandrel wedge.<br>
11.	Power Pack is mounted on two side of the machine fabricated body which will not occupy more floor space.<br>
Objective of the invention<br>
1.	The principal object of the present invention is to construct a honing machine where the honing head slides on two round vertical guide bars.<br>
2.	The further object of the present invention is to mount Stroking cylinder on the vertical wall of the fabricated body behind the honing head in between guide bar to minimise the stress on guide bar.<br>
3.	The further object of the present invention is to mount Hydraulic motor axially parallel to the spindle connected by gear inside the honing head for positive drive and compact design.<br>
4.	The further object of the present invention is to mount Expansion cylinder on top of the honing head while push rod is fitted on Expansion cylinder rod, passes through spindle and universal link which is connected to mandrel wedge for ease of construction.<br>
5.	The further object of the present invention is to mount Power Pack on two side of the machine fabricated body to reduce floor space occupied by machine.	<br>

Working /operation<br>
With cycle start button, the rough hone sticks will expand in few second and Spindle will start rotating and reciprocating till the programmed numbers of rough strokes are completed then finish hone sticks will expand in few second and Spindle will start rotating and reciprocating till the programmed numbers of finish strokes are completed. The cycle will continue in the same manner.<br>
Detail Machine Operations -<br>
Insure that the Emergency Stop push Button is released.<br>
Put rear main switch ON.<br>
Switch on the machine by using ON - OFF Switch by Key, located on the Control Panel. Manual Mode Operation-Put the Selector switch into the Manual mode, located on the Control Panel. The following screen will be displayed on PLC.<br>
MANUAL MODE<br>
Check for all the operation like Spindle rotation, Stone expansion, and Stone retraction to ensure that individual functions are operating correctly. Set the Stroke Up PROXY such that Honing Stones are out of the component by l/3rd and Stroke Down Proxy such that the stones are l/3rd below out of the components.(l/3rd of the honing stone length).<br>
Auto Mode Operation:<br>
a)	Put the Selector switch into Auto mode located on the Control Panel.<br>
The following screen will be displayed.<br>
AUTO MODE and ENTER STROKE<br>
b)	To enter the number of strokes - Press Enter push button, curser will blink. Press the UP Yellow Trangle to enter the required digit (for e.g. 5), move the curser by using Right Yellow Trangle to the second digit and Press the Down Yellow Trangle to enter the required digit (for e.g.4). Press Enter Push button to enter the number of strokes.(i.e. number of strokes 54)<br>
c)	Put the coolant switch ON.<br>
d)	Keep Pressing the Cycle Start push button (it is inching operation) till the Stroke Up Proxy glows. PLC will display WATT for a few seconds. Press the Cycle Start push button again after getting display PRESS CYCLE START.<br>
The cycle will take place in the following sequence.<br><br>
First the Rough Hone sticks will expand in few second then the Spindle will start rotating and reciprocating between the Stroke up PROXY and Stroke down proxy, till the programmed numbers of Rough strokes are completed then Finish Hone sticks will expand in few second and Spindle will start rotating and reciprocating between the Stroke up Proxy and Stroke down Proxy, till the programmed numbers of Finish strokes are completed<br>
After the set numbers of strokes are completed, the Spindle stops rotating and reciprocating at Stroke Up Proxy.<br>
Then the Hone sticks will collapse in few seconds.<br>
After pressing the CYCLE STOP, the Spindle move up till the Home Proxy and then PLC displays the CYCLE COMPUTED AND ENTER STROKE.<br>
If the Stop Cycle push button is pressed at any time during the Reciprocation then the present stroke will be completed, the Rotation will stop, the Honing Stones Collapse and then the Spindle will return to the HOME position.<br>
In the Auto mode, if the Dwelling/ Jogging/ short stroking (F4) push button is pressed at any time during Reciprocation, the Spindle will dwell till the Dwelling push button is released. The Dwelling will be done at the any required portion of the components. The strokes during the dwelling will not be counted.<br>
The spindle will reciprocate normally if the dwelling push button is released, the stroke counting will continue after this.<br>
The operator can remove taper in bore by dwelling the honing mandrel at the required portion of the component.<br><br>
