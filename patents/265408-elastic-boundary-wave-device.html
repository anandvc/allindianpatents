				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
ELASTIC BOUNDARY-WAVE DEVICE<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to boundary acoustic<br>
wave devices used as, for example, resonators or band-pass<br>
filters. The present invention particularly relates to a<br>
boundary acoustic wave device including a piezoelectric<br>
body, an electrode formed by embedding a metal in the upper<br>
surface of the piezoelectric body, and a dielectric body<br>
extending over the piezoelectric body and the electrode.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Duplexers (DPXs) and RF filters used in mobile<br>
communication systems need to have both broad band-pass<br>
properties and good temperature properties. Conventional<br>
boundary acoustic wave devices used for such DPXs or RF<br>
filters each include a piezoelectric substrate made of 36-<br>
50 degrees rotated Y-plate X-propagation LiTaO3. The<br>
piezoelectric substrate has a temperature coefficient of<br>
frequency of -45 to -35 ppm/°C. A known technique for<br>
improving temperature properties is to form a SiO2 layer<br>
having a positive temperature coefficient of frequency over<br>
IDT electrodes arranged on the piezoelectric substrate.<br><br><br>
[0003]<br>
In such a structure that the SiO2 layer extends over the<br>
IDT electrodes, unevenness occurs between fingers of the IDT<br>
electrodes and spaces between the electrode fingers. That<br>
is, a surface of the SiO2 layer cannot avoid having<br>
differences in height between the IDT electrodes and spaces<br>
therebetween. Therefore, there is a problem in that surface<br>
irregularities of the SiO2 layer cause the deterioration of<br>
insertion loss.<br>
[0004]<br>
An increase in the thickness of the IDT electrodes<br>
necessarily increases the height of the irregularities.<br>
Therefore, the IDT electrodes cannot be increased in<br>
thickness.<br>
[0005]<br>
In recent years, boundary acoustic wave devices have<br>
been replacing surface acoustic wave devices and have been<br>
attracting much attention because the boundary acoustic wave<br>
devices are useful in manufacturing small-size packages.<br>
Non-patent Document 1 below discloses a boundary acoustic<br>
wave device including a LiNbO3 substrate, IDT electrodes,<br>
and a SiO2 layer defining a dielectric body laminated in<br>
that order. The IDT electrodes have a large thickness such<br>
that the acoustic velocity of an SH-type boundary acoustic<br>
wave propagating between the LiNbO3 substrate and the SiO2<br><br><br>
layer is less than that of a slow transverse wave<br>
propagating in the SiO2 layer; hence, the SH-type boundary<br>
acoustic wave is nonleaky. Fig. 3 of Non-patent Document 1<br>
shows that the thickness of an IDT electrode that is<br>
sufficient for an SH-type boundary acoustic wave to be<br>
nonleaky is 0.15λ or more when the IDT electrode is made of<br>
Al, or 0.04λ or more when the IDT electrode is made of one<br>
of Cu, Ag, and Au, wherein λ represents the wavelength of<br>
the SH-type boundary acoustic wave.<br>
Non-patent Document 1: "RF Filter using Boundary Acoustic<br>
Wave" (Proc. Symp. Ultrason. Electron., Vol. 26, pp. 25-26<br>
(2005/11))<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
[0006]<br>
When boundary acoustic wave devices, as well as the<br>
boundary acoustic wave device disclosed in Non-patent<br>
Document 1, include IDT electrodes which are made of Au and<br>
which have a thickness of 0.04λ or more, frequency<br>
properties of the boundary acoustic wave devices vary<br>
significantly due to differences in thickness between the<br>
electrodes. Therefore, it has been difficult to manufacture<br>
boundary acoustic wave devices having good frequency<br>
properties with high reproducibility.<br>
[0007]<br>
In view of the foregoing circumstances, it is an object<br><br><br>
of the present invention to provide a boundary acoustic wave<br>
device which includes electrodes having reduced thickness,<br>
which can confine an SH-type boundary acoustic wave between<br>
a piezoelectric body and a dielectric body, and which has<br>
low loss.<br>
[0008]<br>
A first aspect of the present invention provides a<br>
boundary acoustic wave device that includes a LiNbO3<br>
substrate which has a plurality of grooves formed in the<br>
upper surface thereof and which has Euler angles (0°, θ, -<br>
45° to +45°), electrodes formed by filling the grooves with<br>
a metal material, and a dielectric layer formed over the<br>
LiNbO3 substrate and the electrodes. The upper surface of<br>
the dielectric layer is flat. The metal material used to<br>
form the electrodes is at least one selected from the group<br>
consisting of Al, Ti, Ni, Cr, Cu, W, Ta, Pt, Ag, and Au. Al<br>
and Ti are grouped into a first group. Ni and Cr are<br>
grouped into a second group. Cu, W, Ta, Pt, Ag, and Au are<br>
grouped into a third group. The thickness of the electrodes<br>
made of the metal materials assigned to each group, θ of the<br>
Euler angles of the LiNbO3 substrate, and the thickness of<br>
the dielectric layer are within any of ranges shown in Table<br>
1 below.<br>
[0009]<br>
[Table 1]<br><br><br>
[0010]<br>
In the boundary acoustic wave device of the first<br>
aspect, the thickness of the electrodes, θ of the Euler<br>
angles of the LiNbO3 substrate, and the thickness of the<br>
dielectric layer are within any of ranges shown in Table 2<br>
below.<br>
[0011]<br><br>
[0012]<br>
A second aspect of the present invention provides a<br><br>
boundary acoustic wave device that includes a LiTaO3<br>
substrate which has a plurality of grooves formed in the<br>
upper surface thereof and which has Euler angles (0°, θ, -<br>
45° to +45°); electrodes formed by filling the grooves with<br>
a metal material; and a dielectric layer formed over the<br>
LiTaO3 substrate and the electrodes. The upper surface of<br>
the dielectric layer is flat. The metal material used to<br>
form the electrodes is at least one selected from the group<br>
consisting of Al, Cu, Au, Ta, and Pt. The thickness of the<br>
electrodes, θ of the Euler angles of the LiTaO3 substrate,<br>
and the thickness of the dielectric layer are within any of<br>
ranges shown in Table 3 below.<br>
[0013]<br><br>
[0014]<br><br>
In the boundary acoustic wave device according to the<br>
second aspect, the thickness of the electrodes, θ of the<br>
Euler angles of the LiTaO3 substrate, and the thickness of<br>
the dielectric layer are within any of ranges shown in Table<br>
4 below.<br>
[0015]<br><br>
[0016]<br>
In the boundary acoustic wave device according to each<br>
aspect, the dielectric layer is made of silicon dioxide.<br>
Since silicon dioxide has a positive temperature coefficient<br>
of frequency TCF and LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 have a negative<br>
temperature coefficient of frequency TCF, a boundary<br>
acoustic wave device having a temperature coefficient of<br>
frequency with a small absolute value and good temperature<br><br>
properties can be provided.<br>
(Advantages)<br>
[0017]<br>
In the boundary acoustic wave device according to the<br>
first aspect, the electrodes are formed by filling the<br>
grooves, which are formed in the upper surface of the LiNbO3<br>
substrate, with the metal material and the dielectric layer<br>
is formed over the LiNbO3 substrate and the electrodes, the<br>
thickness of the electrodes can be adjusted by varying the<br>
depth of the grooves. Therefore, there are substantially no<br>
unevenness between electrode-bearing portions and electrode-<br>
free portions; hence, the upper surface of the dielectric<br>
layer can be readily planarized and the insertion loss can<br>
be reduced.<br>
[0018]<br>
In addition, the metal material used to form the<br>
electrodes is at least one of the metal materials of the<br>
first group, those of the second group, and those of the<br>
third group and θ of the Euler angles of the LiNbO3 substrate,<br>
the thickness of the dielectric layer, and the thickness of<br>
the electrodes are within any of ranges shown in Table 1.<br>
Therefore, as is clear from experiments below, an SH-type<br>
boundary acoustic wave can be nonleaky even if the<br>
electrodes have a reduced thickness. Hence, a boundary<br>
acoustic wave device which uses such a SH-type boundary<br><br>
acoustic wave and which has low loss can be provided.<br>
[0019]<br>
When the thickness of the electrodes, 0 of the Euler<br>
angles, and the thickness of the dielectric layer are any of<br>
those shown in Table 2, the loss of the boundary acoustic<br>
wave device can be further reduced.<br>
[0020]<br>
According to the second aspect, the electrodes are<br>
formed by filling the grooves, which are formed in the upper<br>
surface of the LiTaO3 substrate, with the metal material and<br>
the dielectric layer is formed over the LiNbO3 substrate and<br>
the electrodes, there are substantially no unevenness<br>
between electrode-bearing portions and electrode-free<br>
portions; hence, the upper surface of the dielectric layer<br>
is flat and therefore the insertion loss can be reduced. In<br>
addition, the material used to form the electrodes is at<br>
least one of metal materials such as Al, Cu, Au, Ta, and Pt<br>
and the thickness of the electrodes, θ of the Euler angles<br>
of the LiTaO3 substrate, and the thickness of the dielectric<br>
layer are within any of ranges shown in Table 2. Therefore,<br>
an SH-type boundary acoustic wave can be nonleaky even if<br>
the electrodes have a reduced thickness. Hence, a boundary<br>
acoustic wave device which uses such a SH-type boundary<br>
acoustic wave and which has low loss can be provided.<br>
[0021]<br><br>
In particular, when the thickness of the electrodes, θ<br>
of the Euler angles, and the thickness of the dielectric<br>
layer are within any of the ranges shown in Table 4, the<br>
loss of the boundary acoustic wave device can be further<br>
reduced.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0024]<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will now be<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawings in<br>
detail. The present invention will become apparent from the<br>
description.<br>
[0025]<br>
(First experiment)<br>
A method for manufacturing a boundary acoustic wave<br>
device according to an embodiment of the present invention<br>
is described below with reference to Figs. 1(a) to 1(f) such<br>
that the structure of the boundary acoustic wave device<br>
becomes apparent.<br>
[0026]<br>
As shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), a LiNbO3 substrate<br>
defining a piezoelectric substrate is prepared.<br>
[0027]<br>
A photoresist layer 2 is formed over the upper surface<br>
la of the LiNbO3 substrate 1. The photoresist layer 2 can be<br>
formed from any photoresist material resistant to reactive<br>
ion etching (RIE) performed later. In this example, a<br>
positive resist, AZ-1500™, available from Clariant (Japan)<br>
K.K. is used. In this example, the thickness of the<br>
photoresist layer 2 is 2 µm.<br>
[0028]<br><br><br>
The photoresist layer 2 is patterned in such a manner<br>
that the photoresist layer is exposed to light and then<br>
developed, whereby a photoresist pattern 2A is formed as<br>
shown in Fig. 1(b). In the photoresist pattern 2A, portions<br>
for forming IDT electrodes are removed from the photoresist<br>
layer.<br>
[0029]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1(c), a plurality of grooves 1b with a<br>
desired depth are formed in the upper surface 1a of the<br>
LiNbO3 substrate 1 by reactive ion etching. The desired<br>
depth thereof is equal to the thickness of the IDT<br>
electrodes formed later. However, the etching depth may be<br>
slightly greater or less than the thickness of the IDT<br>
electrodes.<br>
[0030]<br>
A1 layers are formed by vapor deposition or sputtering.<br>
This allows the A1 layers, that is, electrode layers 3 to be<br>
placed in the grooves 1b as shown in Fig. 1(d) . An A1 layer<br>
is placed on the photoresist pattern 2A.<br>
[0031]<br>
The LiNbO3 substrate is immersed in a stripping solution<br>
containing acetone or the like, whereby the photoresist<br>
pattern 2A and the A1 layer placed on the photoresist<br>
pattern 2A are removed. This allows the grooves 1b to be<br>
filled with the electrode layers 3 and allows the LiNbO3<br><br><br>
substrate 1 to have a substantially flat upper surface as<br>
shown in Fig. 1(e).<br>
[0032]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1(f), a SiO2 layer 4 defining a<br>
dielectric layer is formed on the upper surface, whereby the<br>
boundary acoustic wave device 5 is obtained. The SiO2 layer<br>
4 has a flat surface. This is because the upper surface 1a<br>
of the LiNbO3 substrate 1 and the upper surface of each<br>
electrode layer 3 are substantially flush with each other<br>
and are substantially flat. Therefore, the surface of the<br>
SiO2 layer 4 can be securely planarized when the SiO2 layer 4<br>
is formed by a common process.<br>
[0033]<br>
A process for forming the SiO2 layer 4 is not<br>
particularly limited. The SiO2 layer 4 may be formed by an<br>
appropriate process such as a printing process, a vapor<br>
deposition process, or a sputtering process.<br>
[0034]<br>
The method for manufacturing the boundary acoustic wave<br>
device 5 of this embodiment is as described above with<br>
reference to Figs. 1(a) to 1(f), which principally<br>
illustrate electrode portions. In particular, the electrode<br>
layers 3 form an electrode structure including IDT<br>
electrodes. The electrode structure is not particularly<br>
limited and may be a one port-type boundary acoustic wave<br><br><br>
resonator 11 shown in Fig. 2 in plan view. In this case,<br>
the electrode layers form reflectors 12 and 13 arranged on<br>
both sides of the electrode layers 3 which form the IDT<br>
electrodes in the direction of a boundary acoustic wave<br>
propagation.<br>
[0035]<br>
In this example, there are substantially no unevenness<br>
between electrode-bearing portions and electrode-free<br>
portions; hence, the upper surface of the SiO2 layer 4,<br>
which defines a dielectric layer, can be readily planarized<br>
and the insertion loss can be reduced.<br>
[0036]<br>
The boundary acoustic wave device, which has low loss,<br>
can be provided without increasing the thickness of the<br>
electrode layers 3. The electrode layers 3 are made of a<br>
metal material that is at least one selected from the group<br>
consisting of Al, Ti, Ni, Cr, Cu, W, Ta, Pt, Ag, and Au. Al<br>
and Ti are grouped into a first group; Ni and Cr are grouped<br>
into a second group; Cu, W, Ta, Pt, Ag, and Au are grouped<br>
into a third group; the thickness of the electrode layers<br>
made of the metal materials assigned to each group, 9 of the<br>
Euler angles of the LiNbO3 substrate 1, and the thickness of<br>
a dielectric layer are within any of ranges shown in Table 5<br>
below. Therefore, although the electrode layers have a<br>
small thickness, the boundary acoustic wave device, which<br><br><br>
has low loss, can be provided. This is described below in<br>
detail using examples.<br>
[0037]<br><br>
[0038]<br>
Non-patent Document 1 cited above describes that the<br>
SH-type boundary acoustic wave is nonleaky in a<br>
SiO2/electrodes/y-cut X-propagation LiNbO3 multilayer<br>
structure when the electrodes are made of Al and have a<br>
thickness of 0.16A, or more or when the electrodes are made<br>
of Au, Cu, or Ag and have a thickness of 0.04λ or more.<br>
[0039]<br>
However, experiments conducted by the inventors have<br>
shown that an SH-type boundary acoustic wave can be nonleaky<br>
in the boundary acoustic wave device 5 of this embodiment<br>
although the electrode layers 3, which are formed by filling<br>
the grooves lb with the metal material, have a small<br><br><br>
thickness. This is described below with reference to Figs.<br>
3 to 5.<br>
[0040]<br>
Fig. 3 is a graph showing the relationship between the<br>
thickness of electrode layers 3 made of the metal materials<br>
of the first group and the attenuation constant a of<br>
boundary acoustic wave devices 5 including LiNbO3 substrates<br>
with Euler angles (0°, 103°, 0°). Fig. 4 is a graph showing<br>
the relationship between the thickness of electrode layers 3<br>
made of the metal materials of the second group and the<br>
attenuation constant a of boundary acoustic wave devices 5.<br>
Fig. 5 is a graph showing the relationship between the<br>
thickness of electrode layers 3 made of the metal materials<br>
of the third group and the attenuation constant a of<br>
boundary acoustic wave devices 5. The electrode layers 3<br>
have an electrode structure for forming the one port-type<br>
boundary acoustic wave resonator shown in Fig. 3.<br>
[0041]<br>
Figs. 3 to 5 illustrate that the following combination<br>
is within ranges specified in Tables 6 to 11: a combination<br>
of the thickness of the electrode layers that are made of<br>
the corresponding metal materials of the first to third<br>
groups such that the propagation loss a is 0.1 dB/λ or less<br>
or substantially zero, θ of Euler angles, and a SiO2 layer.<br>
[0042]<br><br><br>
[0045]<br>
[Table 9]<br>
α≈0<br><br><br>
[0048]<br>
As is clear from Figs. 3 to 5, since the electrode<br>
layers 3 are formed by filling the grooves lb with the metal<br><br>
materials, the attenuation constant a of an SH-type boundary<br>
acoustic wave is 0.1 dB/λ or less and therefore the SH-type<br>
boundary acoustic wave is nonleaky when the electrode layers<br>
3 are made of Al or Ti and have a thickness of 0.03λ, or<br>
more; when the IDT electrodes are made of one of the metal<br>
materials of the second group, that is, Ni or Cr and have a<br>
thickness of 0.01λ or more; or when the IDT electrodes are<br>
made of one of the metal materials of the third group, that<br>
is, Cu, W, Ta, Pt, Ag, or Au and have a thickness of 0.005λ,<br>
or more.<br>
[0049]<br>
In the boundary acoustic wave devices 5, θ of the Euler<br>
angles (0°, θ, 0°) of each LiNbO3 substrate is varied and IDT<br>
electrodes are made of the corresponding metal materials of<br>
the first to third groups. Figs. 6 to 8 each show the<br>
relationship between θ of the Euler angles and the<br>
attenuation constant α.<br>
[0050]<br>
As is clear from Figs. 6 to 8, the attenuation constant<br>
a is very small and therefore a boundary acoustic wave is<br>
nonleaky in a specific range when the IDT electrodes are<br>
made of the corresponding metal materials of the first to<br>
third groups and 6 of the Euler angles and the thickness of<br>
the electrodes are varied.<br>
[0051]<br><br>
In the boundary acoustic wave devices 5, dielectric<br>
layers were formed from SiO2 layers 4. The following<br>
relationship was determined using LiNbO3 substrates with<br>
Euler angles (0°, 103°, 0°): the relationship between the<br>
normalized thickness H/λ, of the dielectric layers formed<br>
from the SiO2 layers 4 and the electromechanical coefficient<br>
k2 of SH-type normalization. The results are shown in Figs. <br>
9 to 11. As is clear from Figs. 9 to 11, an increase in the<br>
thickness of the SiO2 layer 4 tends to reduces the<br>
electromechanical coefficient k2 of an SH-type boundary<br>
acoustic wave. Since the magnitude of the electromechanical<br>
coefficient k2 may be selected depending on applications,<br>
the thickness of the dielectric layers formed from the SiO2<br>
layers 4 may be selected within ranges shown in Figs. 9 to<br>
11 depending on a range required for the electromechanical<br>
coefficient k2 of the SH-type boundary acoustic wave.<br>
[0052]<br>
The results of electrode layers 3 made of Al, Ni, and<br>
Cu are shown in Figs. 9 to 11. It has been confirmed that<br>
Ti shows substantially the same value as that of Al; Cr<br>
shows substantially the same value as that of Ni; and Cu, W,<br>
Ta, Pt, or Ag shows a value close to that of Au.<br>
[0053]<br>
Figs. 12 and 13 are schematic views each illustrating<br>
the energy distribution of an acoustic wave propagating in a<br><br>
structure including an IDT electrode placed in a groove lb<br>
formed in a LiNbO3 substrate 1 and a SiO2 layer 4 deposited<br>
over the IDT electrode, the SiO2 layer 4 defining a<br>
dielectric layer of which normalized thicknesses H/λ are<br>
less than 0.8 and 0.8 or more, respectively.<br>
[0054]<br>
As is clear from Fig. 12, the energy of the acoustic<br>
wave is distributed over the upper surface of the dielectric<br>
layer made from the SiO2 layer 4, which has a normalized<br>
thickness H/λ of less than 0.8; hence, the structure cannot<br>
be used as any boundary acoustic wave device. In contrast,<br>
the SiO2 layer 4 shown in Fig. 13 has a normalized thickness<br>
H/λ of 0.8 or more and therefore the energy of the acoustic<br>
wave is confined in this structure; hence, this structure<br>
can be used as a boundary acoustic wave device.<br>
[0055]<br>
The results shown in Figs. 3 to 5, 6 to 8, 9 to 11, 12,<br>
and 13 show that the following relationship may be within<br>
any of ranges shown in Table 5: the relationship between<br>
the type of a material most suitable for electrodes used for<br>
boundary acoustic waves, the normalized thickness H/λ of<br>
each electrode, the normalized thickness of a dielectric<br>
layer made of SiO2, and θ of the Euler angles. In Table 5,<br>
Euler angles are expressed in the form of (0°, θ, -45° to<br>
+45°), that is, Ψ ranges from -45° to 45°, although Ψ = 0 in<br><br>
the above experiments. This is because if 6 of the Euler<br>
angles of a LiNbO3 substrate is within a specific range, a<br>
small propagation loss is obtained as described above when Ψ<br>
is 0° or is within the range of -45° to 45°. Not only in<br>
LiNbO3 but also in LiTaO3 used in a second experiment below,<br>
Ψ of Euler angles (0°, θ, Ψ) shows substantially the same<br>
results as those achieved when Ψ = 0°, if Ψ is within the<br>
range of -45° to 45°.<br>
[0056]<br>
When any of ranges shown in Table 12 below is satisfied,<br>
propagation loss can be further reduced.<br>
[0057]<br><br>
[0058]<br>
In the boundary acoustic wave device 5 of this<br>
embodiment, the electrode layers 3 including IDT electrodes<br>
are formed by filling the grooves 1b, disposed in the upper<br><br>
surface of the LiNbO3 substrate 1, with the metal material.<br>
According to this structure, the absolute value of a<br>
temperature coefficient of frequency TCF can be reduced and<br>
frequency-temperature characteristic can be improved as<br>
compared to those of comparative examples in which IDT<br>
electrodes are formed on LiNbO3 substrates without filling<br>
grooves with any metal material. This is shown in Fig, 14,<br>
Fig. 14 shows the temperature coefficient of frequency TCF<br>
of the boundary acoustic wave device of this embodiment, the<br>
boundary acoustic wave device being obtained in such a<br>
manner that the grooves are formed in the LiNbO3 substrate<br>
with Euler angles (0°, 103°, 0°), the IDT electrodes with a<br>
thickness of 0.04X are formed by filling the grooves with Au,<br>
and the SiO2 layer with a thickness of 1A, or 2\ is deposited<br>
over the IDT electrodes. For comparison, Fig. 14 also shows<br>
the temperature coefficient of frequency TCF of a boundary<br>
acoustic wave device which is obtained in such a manner that<br>
IDT electrodes made of Au having the same thickness are<br>
formed on a LiNbO3 substrate without forming any grooves and<br>
a SiO2 layer having the thickness of 1λ, or 2λ similar to the<br>
above described embodiment.<br>
[0059]<br>
As is clear from Fig. 14, according to the embodiment,<br>
the absolute value of the thermal coefficient of frequency<br>
TCF can be reduced and can be improved by about 5 ppm/°C as<br><br>
compared to comparative examples regardless of whether the<br>
normalized thickness H/λ of a dielectric layer made of SiO2<br>
is 1λ or 2λ.<br>
[0060]<br>
In this embodiment, the dielectric layer is formed from<br>
the SiO2 layer 4 and may be made of silicon oxide other than<br>
SiO2.<br>
[0061]<br>
(Second experiment)<br>
Although the LiNbO3 substrates were used in the first<br>
experiment, LiTaO3 substrates were used in a second<br>
experiment. A plurality of grooves lb were formed in the<br>
upper surfaces of the LiTaO3 substrates in the same manner<br>
as that described with reference to Fig. 1, electrode layers<br>
3 were formed by filling the grooves lb with various metal<br>
materials, and SiO2 layers defining dielectric layers were<br>
deposited. Figs. 15 to 19 are graphs illustrating the<br>
relationship between 0 of the Euler angles (0°, θ, 0°) of<br>
the LiTaO3 substrates, which are disposed in boundary<br>
acoustic wave devices obtained as described above, the<br>
thickness of the electrode layers, and the attenuation<br>
constant a of the boundary acoustic wave devices.<br>
[0062]<br>
Fig. 15 shows results obtained using Al as an electrode<br>
material, Fig. 16 shows results obtained using Cu as an<br><br>
electrode material, and Fig. 17 shows results obtained using<br>
Au as a metal material for forming electrodes.<br>
[0063]<br>
Electromechanical coefficients were determined in such<br>
a manner that LiTaO3 with Euler angles (0°, 126°, 0°) were<br>
used to prepare the LiTaO3 substrates and the thickness of<br>
electrodes and the type of a metal material for forming the<br>
electrodes were varied. The obtained results are shown in<br>
Figs. 20 to 24. Figs. 20 to 24 show results obtained using<br>
Al, Au, Cu, Ta, and Pt as metal materials for forming the<br>
electrodes.<br>
[0064]<br>
As is clear from Figs. 20 to 24, for the use of the<br>
LiTaO3 substrates, an increase in the thickness of SiO2<br>
layers reduces the electromechanical coefficient k2. The<br>
thickness of SiO2 layers may be selected such that an<br>
electromechanical coefficient k2 suitable for the<br>
application is obtained.<br>
[0065]<br>
The results shown in Figs. 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 show<br>
that the use of a LiTaO3 substrate, as well as the LiNbO3<br>
substrates, having Euler angles (0°, θ, -45° to +45°)<br>
provides a boundary acoustic wave device with low loss and<br>
utilizing an SiO-type boundary acoustic wave when θ of the<br>
Euler angles, the thickness of electrodes, and the thickness<br><br>
of a SiO2 layer are within any of ranges shown in Tables 13<br>
to 22.<br>
[0066]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0076]<br>
The analysis of data in Tables 13 to 22 shows that such<br>
a boundary acoustic wave device with low loss is obtained if<br>
any of ranges shown in Tables 23 and 24 is satisfied. In<br>
particular, any of ranges shown in Table 24 is preferably<br>
satisfied because the loss thereof is reduced.<br><br><br>
[0079]<br>
In the first and second experiments, the IDT electrodes<br><br>
are made of a single metal such as Al or Au. The IDT<br>
electrodes may each have a multilayer structure in which an<br>
electrode layer principally containing such a metal is<br>
disposed on another electrode layer made of another metal<br>
material.<br>
[0080]<br>
The dielectric layers may be made of another dielectric<br>
material having an acoustic wave velocity of a transverse<br>
wave greater than that of the electrodes. Examples of such<br>
a dielectric material include glass, SixNy, SiC, and Al2O3.<br>
When the dielectric layers are made of any one of these<br>
materials, the thickness thereof may be determined in<br>
inverse proportion to the acoustic wave velocity of a<br>
transverse wave of SiO2.<br><br>
