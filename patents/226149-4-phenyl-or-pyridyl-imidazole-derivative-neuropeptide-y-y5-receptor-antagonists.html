The present invention relates to selective 4-(phenyl or pyridyl)-imidazole derivative neuropeptide Y Y5 receptor antagonists useful in the treatment of eating disorders, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treatment using the compounds.<br>
Neuropeptide Y is a 36 amino acid peptide that is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems. This peptide mediates a number of physiological effects through its various receptor subtypes. Studies in animals have shown that neuropeptide Y is a powerful stimulus of food intake, and it has been demonstrated that activation of neuropeptide Y Y5 receptors results in hyperphagia and decreased thermogenesis. Therefore compounds that antagonize neuropeptide Y at the Y5 receptor subtype represent an approach to the treatment of eating disorders such as obesity and hyperphagia, and diabetes.<br>
Substituted imidazoles are used in various pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical applications. WO 99/01128 discloses substituted diarylimidazoles as NPY Y5 receptor antagonists.   WO 99/48873<br>
discloses non-peptidergic antagonists of NPY receptors, which are<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Alkyl represents a straight or branched saturated hydrocarbon chain having the designated number of carbon atoms. If the number of carbon atoms is not specified, e.g., if the term lower alkyl is used, chain lengths of 1 to 6 carbons are intended.<br>
AryMlncluding the aryl portion of arytalkyl and heteroarytalkyl)-represents a carbocyclic group containing from 6 to 15 carbon atoms and having at least one aromatic ring (e.g., aryl is a phenyl ring), with all available substitutable carbon atoms of the carbocyclic group being intended as possible points of attachment, said carbocyclic group being optionally substituted with one or more (e.g., 1  <br><br>
Halogano represents fluoro, chtoro, bromo or todo.<br>
As defined above, heterocycloaikvl represents 4 to 6 membered rings comprising 3 to 5 carbon ring members and 1 to 3 ring members selected from the group consisting of -NR12-, -O- and -S-. Where a heterocydoalkyl ring comprises more than one heteroatom, no rings are formed where there are adjacent oxygen atoms, adjacent suffur atoms, or three consecutive heteroatoms. Examples of heterocycloalkyl rings are piperazinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, pyrrotidinyl, piperidinyt, morpholinyl and thiomorpholinyl.<br>
Heteroaryl means a 5 or 6-membered aromatic ring comprising 1 to 3 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of -0-, -S- and -N=, provided that the rings do not include adjacent oxygen and/or sulfur atoms. Examples of heteroaryl groups are pyridyl, isoxazotyt, oxadiazolyl, furanyt, pyrrolyi, thienyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, tetrazotyl, thiazolyt, thiadiazolyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyt, pyridaanyl and triazolyt. The heteroaryl rings are attached to the rest of the molecule through a ring carbon atom. All positional isomers are contemplated, e.g., 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl and 4-pyridyl. The substituted heteroaryl groups specifically identified in the definition of R, e.g. R^pyridyl and R3-thiazolyt, can be substituted at any available ring carbon atom.<br><br><br>
W-oxides can form on a tertiary nitrogen present in an R substftuent (e.g., R Is 3-pyridyl W-oxide) or when X is = N-, in the Y substituted ring.<br>
Compounds of formula I can exist in unsptvated and sofvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the sotvated forms, with pharmaceuticany acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol and the like, are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for purposes of this invention.<br>
A. compound of formula I may form pharmaceuticalty acceptable salts with organic and inorganic acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesuffonic and other mineral and carboxylic acids well known to those skilled in the art The salts are prepared by contacting the free base forms with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner. The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution, such as dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, ammonia or sodium bicarbonate. The free base forms differ from thBir respective sari forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the salts are otherwise equivalent to their respective free base forms for purposes of the invention.<br>
Compounds of formula I may be produced by processes known to those skilled in the art as shown in the following reaction schemes and in the preparations and examples below.<br>
The following reaction schemes are provided by way of illustrating how compounds of the invention may be prepared. It will be appreciatated that the parts of the schemes that refer to compounds outside of the scope of the invention are provided by way of showing analogous procedures by which compounds of the invention may be made.<br>
Scheme 1:<br>
Compounds of formula 1a or 1b wherein X is -  <br><br><br><br><br>
Compounds of formula id can be converted to compounds of formula I wherein R is N-substrtuted-4-piperidyI by reducing the compound of formula 1d, for example by hydrogenation.<br><br><br><br><br>
Starting materials of formula II are prepared according to the<br><br>
acetal and the product is reacted with ammonium acetate to form an imidazole substituted at the 2-position by N-protected 4-piperidinyl. A (2-tnmethylsilyl)ethoxyoKymethy! group is placed on the imidazole nitrogen and the resultant product is brominated to give a mixture of regioisomeric 4- and 5-bromoimidazotes of formula XII.<br><br>
The pyridyl amidine shown in Scheme 1 is prepared by treating 3-cyanopyridlne with an ammonia equivalent such as LHMDS or methytchloroaluminum amide.<br>
Substituted amidines used in the method of Scheme 1 are known or can be prepared by known procedures.<br>
The compounds of formula I exhibit selective neuropeptide Y Y5 antagonizing activity, which has been correlated with pharmaceutical activity for treating eating disorders, such as obesity and hyperphagia, and diabetes.<br>
The compounds of formula I display pharmacological activity in test procedures designated to indicate neuropeptide Y Y5 receptor antagonist activity. The compounds are non-toxic at pharmaceutically therapeutic doses. Following are descriptions of the test procedures.<br>
cAMP Assay<br>
CHO cells expressing NPY Y5 receptors were maintained in Ham's F-12 media (Gfocc-BRL) supplemented with 10% FCS (ICN), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1 % non-essential amino acids and 200 //g/ml Geneticin (GibcoBRL #11811-031) under a humidified 5% C02 atmosphere. Two days prior to assay, cells were released from T-175 tissue culture flasks using cell dissociation solution (1X; non-enzymatic [Sigma #C-5914]) and seeded into 96-well, flat-bottom tissue culture plates at a density of 15,000 to 20,000 cells per well. After approximately 48 hours, the cell monolayers were rinsed with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) then preincubated with approximately 150 /;l/well of assay buffer (HBSS supplemented with 4 mM MgCI2,10 mM HEPES, 0.2% BSA [HH]) containing 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine ([IBMX] Sigma #I-5B79) with or without the antagonist compound of interest at 37°C. After 20 minutes the 1 mM IBMX-HH assay buffer (± antagonist compound) was removed and replaced with assay buffer containing 1.5 pM forskolin (Sigma #F-6686} and various concentrations of NPY in the presence or absence of one concentration of the antagonist compound of interest. At the end of 10 minutes, the media were removed and the cell monolayers treated with 75 (A ethanol. The tissue culture plates were agitated on a platform shaker for 15 minutes, after which the plates were transferred to a warm water bath in order to evaporate the ethanol. Upon<br><br>
bringing ail wells to dryness, the cell residues were resolubilized with 250 ^IFlashPiate assay buffer. The amount of cAMP m each we!) was quantified using the [125l]-cAMP FiashPlate kit (NEN #SMP-001) and according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Data were expressed as either pmo! cAMP/ml or as percent of control. All data points were determined in triplicate and ECso's (nM) were calculated using a nonlinear (sigmoidal) regression equation (GraphPad Prism™). The KB of the antagonist compound was estimated using the following formula:<br>
KB = [B] / (1 . flAV [A]}) where [A] is the ECM of the agonist (NPY) in the absence of antagonist,<br>
[A1] is the ECso of the agonist (NPY) in the presence of antagonist,<br>
and [B] is the concentration of the antagonist<br>
NPY Receptor Binding Assay Human NPY Y5 receptors were expressed in CHO cells. Binding assays were performed in 5D mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 2.5 mM CaCl2,1 mM MgCi2 and 0.1% BSA containing 5-10 j/g of membrane protein and 0.1<br>
125 nM      l-peptide YY in a total volume of 200 (A. Non-specific binding was<br>
determined in the presence of 1 uM NPY. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature, then filtered through MilUpore MAFC glass fiber fitter plates which had been pre-soaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine. The filters were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and radioactivity was measured in a Packard TopCount scintillation counter.<br>
