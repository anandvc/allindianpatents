				<td>The present invention relates to Spirocyclic Compounds as HDAC Inhibitors<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel class of substituted spirocyclic compounds. These compounds can inhibit histone deacetylase and are suitable for use in selectively inducing terminal differentiation, and arresting cell growth and/or apoptosis of neoplastic cells, thereby inhibiting proliferation of such cells. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful in treating a patient having a tumor characterized by proliferation of neoplastic cells. The compounds of the invention may also be useful in the prevention and treatment of TRX-mediated diseases, such as autoimmune, allergic and inflammatory diseases, and in the prevention and/or treatment of diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as neurodegenerative diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inhibition of HDACs can repress gene expression, including expression of genes related to tumor suppression. Inhibition of histone deacetylase can lead to the histone deacetylase-mediated transcriptional repression of tumor suppressor genes. For example, inhibition of histone deacetylase can provide a method for treating cancer, hematological disorders, such as hematopoiesis, and genetic related metabolic disorders. More specifically, transcriptional regulation is a major event in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. There are several lines of evidence that histone acetylation and deacetylation are mechanisms by which transcriptional regulation in a cell is achieved (Grunstein, M., Nature, 389: 349-52 (1997)). These effects are thought to occur through changes in the structure of chromatin by altering the affinity of histone proteins for coiled DNA in the nucleosome. There are five types of histones that have been identified. Histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 are found in the nucleosome, and H1 is a linker located between nucleosomes. Each nucleosome contains two of each histone type within its core, except for H1, which is present singly in the outer portion of the nucleosome structure. It is believed that when the histone proteins are hypoacetylated, there is a greater affinity of the histone to the DNA phosphate backbone. This affinity causes DNA to be tightly bound to the histone and renders the DNA inaccessible to transcriptional regulatory elements and machinery.<br>
The regulation of acetylated states occurs through the balance of activity between two enzyme complexes, histone acetyl transferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC).<br>
The hypoacetylated state is thought to inhibit transcription of associated DNA. This hypoacetylated state is catalyzed by large multiprotein complexes that include HDAC enzymes. In particular, HDACs have been shown to catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the chromatin core histones.<br>
It has been shown in several instances that the disruption of HAT or HDAC activity is implicated in the development of a malignant phenotype. For instance, in acute promyelocytic leukemia, the oncoprotein produced by the fusion of PML and RAR alpha appears to suppress specific gene transcription through the recruitment of HDACs (Lin, R.J. et al., Nature 39/:811-14 (1998)). In this manner, the neoplastic cell is unable to complete differentiation and leads to excess proliferation of the leukemic cell line.<br>
U.S. Patent Numbers 5,369,108, 5,932,616, 5,700,811, 6,087,367 and 6,511,990, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, disclose hydroxamic acid derivatives useful for selectively inducing terminal differentiation, cell growth arrest or apoptosis of neoplastic cells. In addition to their biological activity as antitumor agents, these hydroxamic acid derivatives have recently been identified as useful for treating or preventing a wide variety of thioredoxin (TRX)-mediated diseases and conditions, such as inflammatory diseases, allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, diseases associated with oxidative stress or diseases characterized by cellular hyperproliferation (U.S. Application No. 10/369,094, filed February 15, 2003, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference). Further, these hydroxamic acid derivatives have been identified as useful for treating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) such as neurodegenerative diseases and for treating brain cancer (See, U.S. Application No. 10/273,401, filed October 16, 2002, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference).<br>
In view of the wide variety of applications for compounds containing hydroxamic acid moieties, the development of new inhibitors having improved properties, for example, increased potency or increased bioavailability is highly desirable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel class of substituted spirocyclic compounds. These compounds, which can be used to treat cancer, inhibit histone deacetylase and are suitable for use in selectively inducing terminal differentiation, and arresting cell growth and/or apoptosis of neoplastic cells, thereby inhibiting proliferation of such cells. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful in treating a patient having a tumor characterized by proliferation of neoplastic cells. The compounds of the invention may also be useful in the prevention and treatment of TRX-mediated diseases, such as autoimmune, allergic and inflammatory diseases, and in the prevention and/or treatment of diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as neurodegenerative diseases. The present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of the instant invention, and safe, dosing regimens of these pharmaceutical compositions, which are easy to follow, and which result in a therapeutically effective amount of these compounds in vivo.<br>

Chemical Definitions<br>
As used herein, "alkyl" is intended to include both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, C1-C10, as in "C1-C10alkyl" is defined to include groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,<br><br>
7, 8, 9 or 10 carbons in a linear or branched arrangement.  For example, "Ci-C JO alkyl"<br>
specifically includes methyl, ethyl, w-propyl, /'-propyl, n-butyl, J-butyl, /'-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, and so on. The term "cycloalkyl" means a monocyclic saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group having the specified number of carbon atoms. The cycloalkyl is optionally bridged (i.e., forming a bicyclic moiety), for example with a methylene, ethylene or propylene bridge. The bridge may be optionally substituted or branched. The cycloalkyl may be fused with an aryl group such as phenyl, and it is understood that the cycloalkyl substituent is attached via the cycloalkyl group. For example, "cycloalkyl" includes cyclopropyl, methyl-cyclopropyl, 2,2-dimethyl-cyclobutyl, 2-ethyl-cyclopp,ntyl, cyclohexyl, and so on. In an embodiment of the invention the term "cycloalkyl" \pcludes the groups described immediately above and further includes monocyclic unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups. For example, "cycloalkyl" as defined in this embodiment includes cyclopropyl, methyl-cyclopropyl, 2,2-dimethyl-cyclobutyl, 2-ethyl-cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclobutenyl and so on. In an embodiment, if the number of carbon atoms is not specified, "alkyl" refers to C1-C12 alkyl and in a further embodiment, "alkyl" refers to C=-C6 alkyl. In an embodiment, if the number of carbon atoms is not specified, "cycloalkyl" refers to C3-C10 cycloalkyl and in a further embodiment, "cycloalkyl" refers to C3-C7 cycloalkyl. In an embodiment, examples of "alkyl" include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, /'-propyl, n-butyl, t-butyl and i-butyl.<br>
The term "alkylene" means a hydrocarbon diradical group having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, "alkylene" includes -CH2-, -CH2CH2- and the like. In an embodiment, if the number of carbon atoms is not specified, "alkylene" refers to C1-C12 alkylene and in a further embodiment, "alkylene" refers to C1-C6 alkylene.<br>
When used in the phrases "alkylaryl", "alkylcycloalkyl" and "alkylheterocyclyl" the term "alkyl" refers to the alkyl portion of the moiety and does not describe the number of atoms in the aryl and heteroaryl portion of the moiety. In an embodiment, if the number of carbon atoms is not specified, "alkyl" of "alkylaryl", "alkylcycloalkyl" and "alkylheterocyclyl" refers to C1-C12 alkyl and in a further embodiment, the term refers to C1-C6 alkyl.<br>
If no number of carbon atoms is specified, the term "alkenyl" refers to a non-aromatic hydrocarbon radical, straight, branched or cyclic, containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and at least one carbon to carbon double bond. Preferably one carbon to carbon<br>
double bond is present, and up to four non-aromatic carbon-carbon double bonds may be present. Thus, "C2-C6 alkenyl" means an alkenyl radical having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. Alkenyl groups include ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, 2-methylbutenyl and cyclohexenyl. The straight, branched or cyclic portion of the alkenyl group may contain double bonds and may be substituted if a substituted alkenyl group is indicated.<br>
The term "alkynyl" refers to a hydrocarbon radical straight, branched or cyclic, containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and at least one carbon to carbon triple bond. Up to three carbon-carbon triple bonds may be present. Thus, "C2-C6 alkynyl" means an alkynyl radical having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms.

stereochemistry<br>
Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms having the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these compounds, called stereoisomers, are identical except that they are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer can also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture. Many of the compounds described herein can have one or more chiral centers and therefore can exist in different enantiomeric forms. If desired, a chiral carbon can be designated with an asterisk (*). When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the Formulas of the invention, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon, and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced within the Formula. As is used in the art, when it is desired to specify the absolute configuration about a chiral carbon, one of the bonds to the chiral carbon can be depicted as a wedge (bonds to atoms above the plane) and the other can be depicted as a series or wedge of short parallel lines is (bonds to atoms below the plane). The Cahn-Inglod-Prelog system can be used to assign the (R) or (S) configuration to a chiral carbon.<br>
When the HDAC inhibitors of the present invention contain one chiral center, the compounds exist in two enantiomeric forms and the present invention includes both enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers, such as the specific 50:50 mixture referred to as a racemic mixtures. The enantiomers can be resolved by methods known to those skilled in the art, such as formation of diastereoisomeric salts which may be separated, for example, by crystallization (see, CRC Handbook of Optical Resolutions via Diastereomeric Salt Formation by David Kozma (CRC Press, 2001)); formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives or complexes which may be separated, for example, by crystallization, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography; selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example enzymatic esterification; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example on a chiral support for example silica with a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral solvent. It will be appreciated that where the desired enantiomer is converted into another chemical entity by one of the separation procedures described above, a further step is required to liberate the desired enantiomeric form.    Alternatively, specific enantiomers may be synthesized by asymmetric<br>
synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting one enantiomer into the other by asymmetric transformation.<br>
Designation of a specific absolute configuration at a chiral carbon of the compounds of the invention is understood to mean that the designated enantiomeric form of the compounds is in enantiomeric excess (ee) or in other words is substantially free from the other enantiomer. For example, the "R" forms of the compounds are substantially free from the "S" forms of the compounds and are, thus, in enantiomeric excess of the "S" forms. Conversely, "S" forms of the compounds are substantially free of "R" forms of the compounds and are, thus, in enantiomeric excess of the "R" forms. Enantiomeric excess, as used herein, is the presence of a particular enantiomer at greater than 50%. In a particular embodiment when a specific absolute configuration is designated, the enantiomeric excess of depicted compounds is at least about 90%.<br>
When a compound of the present invention has two or more chiral carbons it can have more than two optical isomers and can exist in diastereoisomeric forms. For example, when there are two chiral carbons, the compound can have up to 4 optical isomers and 2 pairs of enantiomers ((S,S)/(R,R) and (R,S)/(S,R)). The pairs of enantiomers (e.g., (S,S)/(R,R)) are mirror image stereoisomers of one another. The stereoisomers that are not mirror-images (e.g., (S,S) and (R,S)) are diastereomers. The diastereoisomeric pairs may be separated by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example chromatography or crystallization and the individual enantiomers within each pair may be separated as described above. The present invention includes each diastereoisomer of such compounds and mixtures thereof.<br>
As used herein, "a," an" and "the" include singular and plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "an active agent" or "a pharmacologically active agent" includes a single active agent as well a two or more different active agents in combination, reference to "a carrier" includes mixtures of two or more carriers as well as a single carrier, and the like.<br>
This invention is also intended to encompass pro-drugs of the compounds of the instant invention disclosed herein. A prodrug of any of the compounds can be made using well-known pharmacological techniques.<br>
This invention, in addition to the above listed compounds, is intended to encompass the use of homologs and analogs of such compounds. In this context, homologs are molecules having substantial structural similarities to the above-described compounds anc analogs are molecules having substantial biological similarities regardless of structura similarities.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
The compounds of the instant invention described herein can, as noted above, be prepared in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are salts that retain the desired biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological effects. Examples of such salts are acid addition salts, organic and inorganic acids, for example, acid addition salts which may, for example, be hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, formic acid, phosphoric acid and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can also be prepared from by treatment with inorganic bases, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can also salts formed from elemental anions such as chlorine, bromine and iodine.<br>
The active compounds disclosed can, as noted above, also be prepared in the form of their hydrates. The term "hydrate" includes but is not limited to hemihydrate, monohydrate, dihydrate, trihydrate, tetrahydrate and the like.<br>

Furthermore, the compound particles may be micronized, or may be agglomerated, particulate granules, powders, oils, oily suspensions or any other form of solid or liquid physical form.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also exhibit polymorphism. This invention further includes different polymorphs of the compounds of the present invention. The term "polymorph" refers to a particular crystalline state of a substance, having particular physical properties such as X-ray diffraction, IR spectra, melting point, and the like.<br>
As used herein, "a," an" and "the" include singular and plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "an active agent" or "a pharmacologically active agent" includes a single active agent as well a two or more different active agents in combination, reference to "a carrier" includes mixtures of two or more carriers as well as a single carrier, and the like.<br>

Definitions:<br>
The term "treating" in its various grammatical forms in relation to the present invention refers to preventing (i.e., chemoprevention), curing, reversing, attenuating, alleviating, minimizing, suppressing or halting the deleterious effects of a disease state, disease progression, disease causative agent (e.g., bacteria or viruses) or other abnormal condition. For example, treatment may involve alleviating a symptom (i.e., not necessary all symptoms) of a disease or attenuating the progression of a disease. Because some of the inventive methods involve the physical removal of the etiological agent, the artisan will recognize that they are equally effective in situations where the inventive compound is administered prior to, or simultaneous with, exposure to the etiological agent (prophylactic treatment) and situations where the inventive compounds are administered after (even well after) exposure to the etiological agent.<br>
Treatment of cancer, as used herein, refers to partially or totally inhibiting, delaying or preventing the progression of cancer including cancer metastasis; inhibiting, delaying or preventing the recurrence of cancer including cancer metastasis; or preventing the onset or development of cancer (chemoprevention) in a mammal, for example a human.<br>
As used herein, the term "therapeutically effective amount" is intended to encompass any amount that will achieve the desired therapeutic or biological effect. The therapeutic effect is dependent upon the disease or disorder being treated or the biological effect desired. As such, the therapeutic effect can be a decrease in the severity of symptoms associated with the disease or disorder and/or inhibition (partial or complete) of progression of the disease. The amount needed to elicit the therapeutic response can be determined based on the age, health.<br>
size and sex of the subject. Optimal amounts can also be determined based on monitoring of the subject's response to treatment.<br>
In the present invention, when the compounds are used to treat or prevent cancer, the desired biological response is partial or total inhibition, delay or prevention of the progression of cancer including cancer metastasis; inhibition, delay or prevention of the recurrence of cancer including cancer metastasis; or the prevention of the onset or development of cancer (chemoprevention) in a mammal, for example a human.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, when the compounds are used to treat and/or prevent thioredoxin (TRX)-mediated diseases and conditions, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount that regulates, for example, increases, decreases or maintains a physiologically suitable level of TRX in the subject in need of treatment to elicit the desired therapeutic effect. The therapeutic effect is dependent upon the specific TRX-mediated disease or condition being treated. As such, the therapeutic effect can be a decrease in the severity of symptoms associated with the disease or disorder and/or inhibition (partial or complete) of progression of the disease or disease.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, when the compounds are used to treat and/or prevent diseases or disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), a therapeutically effective amount is dependent upon the specific disease or disorder being treated. As such, the therapeutic effect can be a decrease in the severity of symptoms associated with the disease or disorder and/or inhibition (partial or complete) of progression of the disease or disorder.<br>
In addition, a therapeutically effective amount can be an amount that inhibits histone deacetylase.<br>
Further, a therapeutically effective amount, can be an amount that selectively induces terminal differentiation, cell growth arrest and/or apoptosis of neoplastic cells, or an amount that induces terminal differentiation of tumor cells.<br>
The method of the present invention is intended for the treatment or chemoprevention of human patients with cancer. However, it is also likely that the method would be effective in the treatment of cancer in other subjects. "Subject", as used herein, refers to animals such as mammals, including, but not limited to, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, pigs, dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, mice or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine, feline, rodent or murine species.<br>
HISTONE DEACETYLASES AND HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS<br>
As demonstrated herein, the compounds of the present invention show improved<br>
activity as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention relates to a method of inhibiting the activity of histone deacetylase comprising contacting the histone deacetylase with an effective amount of one or more of the compounds of the instant invention.<br>
Histone deacetylases (HDACs), as that term is used herein, are enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues in the amino terminal tails of the nucleosomal core histones. As such, HDACs together with histone acetyl transferases (HATs) regulate the acetylation status of histones. Histone acetylation affects gene expression and inhibitors of HDACs, such as the hydroxamic acid-based hybrid polar compound suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) induce growth arrest, differentiation and/or apoptosis of transformed cells in vitro and inhibit tumor growth in vivo. HDACs can be divided into three classes based on structural homology. Class I HDACs (HDACs 1, 2, 3 and 8) bear similarity to the yeast RPD3 protein, are located in the nucleus and are found in complexes associated with transcriptional co-repressors. Class II HDACs (HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9) are similar to the yeast HDA1 protein, and have both nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular localization. Both Class I and II HDACs are inhibited by hydroxamic acid-based HDAC inhibitors, such as SAHA. Class III HDACs form a structurally distant class of NAD dependent enzymes that are related to the yeast SIR2 proteins and are not inhibited by hydroxamic acid-based HDAC inhibitors.<br>
Histone deacetylase inhibitors or HDAC inhibitors, as that term is used herein are compounds that are capable of inhibiting the deacetylation of histones in vivo, in vitro or both. As such, HDAC inhibitors inhibit the activity of at least one histone deacetylase. As a result of inhibiting the deacetylation of at least one histone, an increase in acetylated histone occurs and accumulation of acetylated histone is a suitable biological marker for assessing the activity of HDAC inhibitors. Therefore, procedures that can assay for the accumulation of acetylated histones can be used to determine the HDAC inhibitory activity of compounds of interest. It is understood that compounds that can inhibit histone deacetylase activity can also bind to other substrates and as such can inhibit other biologically active molecules such as enzymes. It is also to be understood that the compounds of the present invention are capable of inhibiting any of the histone deacetylases set forth above, or any other histone deacetylases.<br>
For example, in patients receiving HDAC inhibitors, the accumulation of acetylated histones in peripheral mononuclear cells as well as in tissue treated with HDAC inhibitors can be determined against a suitable control.<br>
HDAC inhibitory activity of a particular compound can be determined in vitro using, for example, an enzymatic assays which shows inhibition of at least one histone<br>
Jeacetylase. Further, determination of the accumulation of acetylated histones in cells treated with a particular composition can be determinative of the HDAC inhibitory activity of a compound.<br>
Assays for the accumulation of acetylated histones are well known in the literature. See, for example, Marks, P.A. et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 92:1210-1215, 2000, Butler, L.M. et al., Cancer Res. 60:5165-5170 (2000), Richon, V. M. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 95:3003-3007, 1998, and Yoshida, M. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265:17174-17179, 1990.<br>
For example, an enzymatic assay to determine the activity of an HDAC inhibitor compound can be conducted as follows. Briefly, the effect of an HDAC inhibitor compound on affinity purified human epitope-tagged (Flag) HDAC1 can be assayed by incubating the enzyme preparation in the absence of substrate on ice for about 20 minutes with the indicated amount of inhibitor compound. Substrate ([3H]acetyl-labelled murine erythroleukemia cell-derived histone) can be added and the sample can be incubated for 20 minutes at 37°C in a total volume of 30 DL. The reaction can then be stopped and released acetate can be extracted and the amount of radioactivity release determined by scintillation counting. An alternative assay useful for determining the activity of an HDAC inhibitor compound is the "HDAC Fluorescent Activity Assay; Drug Discovery Kit-AK-500" available from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA.<br>
In vivo studies can be conducted as follows. Animals, for example, mice, can be injected intraperitoneally with an HDAC inhibitor compound. Selected tissues, for example, brain, spleen, liver etc, can be isolated at predetermined times, post administration. Histones can be isolated from tissues essentially as described by Yoshida et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265:17174-17179, 1990. Equal amounts of histones (about 1 Dg) can be electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and can be transferred to Hybond-P filters (available from Amersham). Filters can be blocked with 3% milk and can be probed with a rabbit purified polyclonal anti-acetylated histone H4 antibody (DAc-H4) and anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody (DAc-H3) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Levels of acetylated histone can be visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000) and the SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). As a loading control for the histone protein, parallel gels can be run and stained with Coomassie Blue (CB).<br>
In addition, hydroxamic acid-based HDAC inhibitors have been shown to up regulate the expression of the p21WAF1 gene. The p21WAF1 protein is induced within 2 hours of culture with HDAC inhibitors in a variety of transformed cells using standard methods. The induction of the p21WAF1 gene is associated with accumulation of acetylated histones in the<br>
chromatin region of this gene. Induction of p21        can therefore be recognized as involved in the Gl cell cycle arrest caused by HDAC inhibitors in transformed cells.<br>
COMBINATION THERAPY<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or in combination with other therapies suitable for the disease or disorder being treated. Where separate dosage formulations are used, the compounds of the instant invention and the other therapeutic agent can be administered at essentially the same time (concurrently) or at separately staggered times (sequentially). The pharmaceutical combination is understood to include all these regimens. Administration in these various ways are suitable for the present invention as long as the beneficial therapeutic effect of the compounds of the instant invention and the other therapeutic agent are realized by the patient at substantially the same time. In an embodiment, such beneficial effect is achieved when the target blood level concentrations of each active drug are maintained at substantially the same time.<br>

Combinations with compounds other than anti-cancer compounds are also encompassed in the instant methods. For example, combinations of the instantly claimed compounds with PPAR-y (i.e., PPAR-gamma) agonists and PPAR-8 (i.e., PPAR-delta) agonists are useful in the treatment of certain malingnancies. PPAR-y and PPAR-5 are the nuclear<br>
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors y and 5. The expression of PPAR-y on endothelial cells and its involvement in angiogenesis has been reported in the literature (see J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1998; 31:909-913; J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274:9116-9121; Invest. Ophthalmol Vis. Sci. 2000; 41:2309-2317). More recently, PPAR-y agonists have been shown to inhibit the angiogenic response to VEGF in vitro; both troglitazone and rosiglitazone maleate inhibit the development of retinal neovascularization in mice. (Arch. Ophthamol. 2001; 119:709-717). Examples of PPAR-y agonists and PPAR- y/a agonists include, but are not limited to, thiazolidinediones (such as DRF2725, CS-011, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone), fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, clofibrate, GW2570, SB219994, AR-H039242, JTT-501, MCC-555, GW2331, GW409544, NN2344, KRP297, NP0110, DRF4158, NN622, GI262570, PNU182716, DRF552926, 2-[(5,7-dipropyl-3-trifluoromethyl-l,2-benzisoxazol-6-yl)oxy]-2-methylpropionic acid (disclosed in USSN 09/782,856), and 2(R)-7-(3-(2-chloro-4-(4-fluorophenoxy) phenoxy)propoxy)-2-ethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (disclosed in USSN 60/235,708 and 60/244,697).<br>
Another embodiment of the instant invention is the use of the presently disclosed compounds in combination with gene therapy for the treatment of cancer. For an overview of genetic strategies to treating cancer see Hall et al. (Am J Hum Genet 61:785-789, 1997) and Kufe et al (Cancer Medicine, 5th Ed, pp 876-889, BC Decker, Hamilton 2000). Gene therapy can be used to deliver any tumor suppressing gene. Examples of such genes include, but are not limited to, p53, which can be delivered via recombinant virus-mediated gene transfer (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,069,134, for example), Duc-4, NF-1, NF-2, RB, WT1, BRCA1, BRCA2, a uPA/uPAR antagonist ("Adenovirus-Mediated Delivery of a uPA/uPAR Antagonist Suppresses Angiogenesis-Dependent Tumor Growth and Dissemination in Mice," Gene Therapy, August 1998; 5(8): 1105-13), and interferon gamma (J. Immunol. 2000; 164:217-222).<br>

A compound of the instant invention may also be useful for treating or preventing cancer in combination with -secretase inhibitors.<br>
Also included in the scope of the claims is a method of treating cancer that comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I in combination with radiation therapy and/or in combination with a second compound selected<br><br>
from: an estrogen receptor modulator, an androgen receptor modulator, a retinoid receptor modulator, a cytotoxiccytostatic agent, an antiproliferative agent, a prenyl-protein transferase inhibitor, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, an HIV protease inhibitor, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, an angiogenesis inhibitor, PPAR- agonists, PPAR-8 agonists, an inhibitor of inherent multidrug resistance, an anti-emetic agent, an agent useful in the treatment of anemia, an agent useful in the treatment of neutropenia, an immunologic-enhancing drug, an inhibitor of cell proliferation and survival signaling, a bisphosphonate, an aromatase inhibitor, an siRNA therapeutic, 7-secretase inhibitors, agents that interfere with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and an agent that interferes with a cell cycle checkpoint.<br>
The use of all of these approaches in combination with the compounds of Formula I and II, as described herein, are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
DOSAGES AND DOSING SCHEDULES<br>
The dosage regimen utilizing the compounds of the present invention can be selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and the type of cancer being treated; the severity (i.e., stage) of the disease to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of tb$ patient; and the particular compound or salt thereof employed. An ordinarily skilled physician or veterinarian can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to treat, for example, to prevent, inhibit (fully or partially) or arrest the progress of the disease.<br>
For oral administration, suitable daily dosages are for example between about 5-4000 mg/m2 administered orally once-daily, twice-daily or three times-daily, continuous (every day) or intermittently (e.g., 3-5 days a week). For example, when used to treat the desired disease, the dose of the compounds of the instant invention can range between about 2 mg to about 2000 mg per day.<br>
The compound of the instant invention may be administered once daily (QD), or divided into multiple daily doses such as twice daily (BID), and three times daily (TDD). For administration once a day, a suitably prepared medicament would therefore contain all of the needed daily dose. For administration twice a day, a suitably prepared medicament would therefore contain half of the needed daily dose. For administration three times a day, a suitably prepared medicament would therefore contain one third of the needed daily dose.<br>
In addition, the administration can be continuous, i.e., every day, or intermittently. The terms "intermittent" or "intermittently" as used herein means stopping and starting at either regular or irregular intervals.   For example, intermittent administration of an HDAC inhibitor<br>
may be administration one to six days per week or it may meaa administration in cycles (e.g., daily administration for two to eight consecutive weeks, then a rest period with no administration for up to one week) or it may mean administration on alternate days.<br>
Typically, an intravenous formulation may be prepared which contains a concentration of the compounds of the instant invention of between about 1.0 mg/mL to about 10 mg/mL. In one example, a sufficient volume of intravenous formulation can be administered to a patient in a day such that the total dose for the day is between about 10 and about 1500 mg/m2.<br>
Subcutaneous formulations, preferably prepared according to procedures well known in the art at a pH in the range between about 5 and about 12, also include suitable buffers and isotonicity agents, as described below. They can be formulated to deliver a daily dose of HDAC inhibitor in one or more daily subcutaneous administrations, e.g., one, two or three times each day.<br>
The compounds can also be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, or course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regime.<br>
It should be apparent to a person skilled in the art that the various modes of administration, dosages and dosing schedules described herein merely set forth specific embodiments and should not be construed as limiting the broad scope of the invention. Any permutations, variations and combinations of the dosages and dosing schedules are included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The term "administration" and variants thereof (e.g., "administering" a compound) in reference to a compound of the invention means introducing the compound or a prodrug of the compound into the system of the animal in need of treatment. When a compound of the invention or prodrug thereof is provided in combination with one or more other active agents (e.g., a cytotoxic agent, etc.), "administration" and its variants are each understood to include concurrent and sequential introduction of the compound or prodrug thereof and other agents.<br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein means that amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a<br>
tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
The compounds of the invention, and derivatives, fragments, analogs, homologs pharmaceutically acceptable salts or hydrate thereof, can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Such compositions typically comprise a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds above, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment, the effective amount is an amount effective to selectively induce terminal differentiation of suitable neoplastic cells and less than an amount which causes toxicity in a patient.<br>
Any inert excipient that is commonly used as a carrier or diluent may be used in the formulations of the present invention, such as for example, a gum, a starch, a sugar, a cellulosic material, an acrylate, or mixtures thereof. A preferred diluent is microcrystalline cellulose. The compositions may further comprise a disintegrating agent (e.g., croscarmellose sodium) and a lubricant (e.g., magnesium stearate), and in addition may comprise one or more additives selected from a binder, a buffer, a protease inhibitor, a surfactant, a solubilizing agent, a plasticizer, an emulsifier, a stabilizing agent, a viscosity increasing agent, a sweetener, a film forming agent, or any combination thereof. Furthermore, the compositions of the present invention may be in the form of controlled release or immediate release formulations.<br>

As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration, such as sterile pyrogen-free water. Suitable carriers are described in the most recent edition of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, a standard reference text in the field, which is incorporated herein by reference. Preferred examples of such carriers or diluents include, but are<br>
not limited to, water, saline, finger's solutions, dextrose solution, and 5% human serum albumin. Liposomes and non-aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils may also be used. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.<br>
Solid carriers/diluents include, but are not limited to, a gum, a starch (e.g., corn starch, pregelatinized starch), a sugar (e.g., lactose, mannitol, sucrose, dextrose), a cellulosic material (e.g., microcrystalline cellulose), an acrylate (e.g., polymethylacrylate), calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide, talc, or mixtures thereof.<br>
For liquid formulations, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions or oils. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Examples of oils are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, and fish-liver oil. Solutions or suspensions can also include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates, and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide.<br>
In addition, the compositions may further comprise binders (e.g., acacia, cornstarch, gelatin, carbomer, ethyl cellulose, guar gum, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, povidone), disintegrating agents (e.g., cornstarch, potato starch, alginic acid, silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, guar gum, sodium starch glycolate, Primogel), buffers (e.g., tris-HCI, acetate, phosphate) of various pH and ionic strength, additives such as albumin or gelatin to prevent absorption to surfaces, detergents (e.g., Tween 20, Tween 80, Pluronic F68, bile acid salts), protease inhibitors, surfactants (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate), permeation enhancers, solubilizing agents (e.g., glycerol, polyethylene glycerol), a glidant (e.g., colloidal silicon dioxide), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite, butylated hydroxyanisole), stabilizers (e.g., hydroxypropyl cellulose, hyroxypropylmethyl cellulose), viscosity increasing agents (e.g., carbomer, colloidal silicon dioxide, ethyl cellulose, guar gum),<br>
sweeteners (e.g., sucrose, aspartame, citric acid), flavoring agents (e.g., peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring), preservatives (e.g., Thimerosal, benzyl alcohol, parabens), lubricants (e.g., stearic acid, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate), flow-aids (e.g., colloidal silicon dioxide), plasticizers (e.g., diethyl phthalate, triethyl citrate), emulsifiers (e.g., carbomer, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate), polymer coatings (e.g., poloxamers or poloxamines), coating and film forming agents (e.g., ethyl cellulose, acrylates, polymethacrylates) and/or adjuvants.<br>
In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate oral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be administered intravenously on the first day of treatment, with oral administration on the second day and all consecutive days thereafter.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be administered for the purpose of preventing disease progression or stabilizing tumor growth.<br>
The preparation of pharmaceutical compositions that contain an active component is well understood in the art, for example, by mixing, granulating, or tablet-forming processes. The active therapeutic ingredient is often mixed with excipients that are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. For oral administration, the active agents are mixed with additives customary for this purpose, such as vehicles, stabilizers, or inert diluents, and converted by customary methods into suitable forms for administration, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard or soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions and the like as detailed above.<br>
The amount of the compound administered to the patient is less than an amount that would cause toxicity in the patient. In the certain embodiments, the amount of the compound that is administered to the patient is less than the amount that causes a concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma to equal or exceed the toxic level of the compound. In one embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 10 nM. In another embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 25 nM. In another embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 50 nM. In another embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 100 nM. In another embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 500 nM. In another embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 1000 nM. In another embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 2500 nM. In another embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 5000 nM. The optimal amount of the compound that should be administered to the patient in the practice of the present invention will depend on the particular compound used and the type of cancer being treated.<br>
The instant invention also includes a pharmaceutical composition useful for treating or preventing cancer that comprises a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I and a second compound selected from: an estrogen receptor modulator, an androgen receptor modulator, a retinoid receptor modulator, a cytotoxic/cytostatic agent, an antiproliferative agent, a prenyl-protein transferase inhibitor, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, an EHV protease inhibitor, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, an angiogenesis inhibitor, a PPAR-y agonist, a PPAR-8 agonist, an inhibitor of cell proliferation and survival signaling, a bisphosphonate, an aromatase inhibitor, an siRNA therapeutic, y-secretase inhibitors, agents that interfere with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and an agent that interferes with a cell cycle checkpoint.<br>

HDAC INHIBITION BY NOVEL COMPOUNDS - HDACl-Flag Assay:<br>
Novel compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit histone deacetylase, subtype 1 (HDACl) using an in vitro deacetylation assay. The enzyme source for this assay was an epitope-tagged human HDACl complex immuno-purified from<br>
stably expressing mammalian cells. The substrate consisted of a commercial product containing an acetylated lysine side chain (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA). Upon deacetylation of the substrate by incubation with the purified HDAC1 complex, a fluorophore is produced that is directly proportional to the level of deacetylation. Using a substrate concentration at the Km for the enzyme preparation, the deacetylation assay was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of novel compounds to semi-quantitatively determine the concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition (IC50) of the deacetylation reaction. The compounds of the instant invention described in the Examples and Tables above exhibit histone deacetylase inhibitory activity at concentrations of less than about 1 µM. EXAMPLE 34<br>
HDAC Inhibition in Cell Lines - ATP Assay<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention were tested for their ability to inhibit proliferation of the human cervical cancer (HeLa) and colon carcinoma (HCT116) cells. In this assay, also referred to as the Vialight Assay, cellular ATP levels are measured as a means of quantifying cellular proliferation. This assay makes use of a bioluminescent method from Cambrex (ViaLight PLUS, cat. #LT07-121). In the presence of ATP, luciferase converts luciferin to oxyluciferin and light. The amount of light produced (emission at 565nM) is measured and correlates with a relative amount of proliferation. Human cervical cancer (HeLa) or colon carcinoma (HCT116) cells were incubated with vehicle or increasing concentrations of compound for 48, 72 or 96 hours. Cell proliferation was quantified by adding the cell lysis reagent (provided in the Vialight assay kit) directly to culture wells, followed by addition of the ATP-monitoring reagent (containing luciferase/luciferin). The amount of light produced is then measured (emission at 565nM). The quantity of light produced, as measured by 565nM absorbance, is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture.<br>
