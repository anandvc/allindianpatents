TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a medicament, especially a novel heterocyclic compound having elastase inhibitory activity, its intermediate and an elastase inhibitory agent containing the said novel compound as an active ingredient,<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Elastase is a general term for proteases which degrade elastin constituting the connective tissue. Neutrophil elastase, pancreas elastase, metallo elastase, etc., are known as elastase. The former two are structurally similar proteases and have the similar specificity against the substrate.<br>
Neutrophil elastase is a serine protease which is contained in granules of neutrophils. A large amount of neutrophil elastase is released from accumulated neutrophils in the tissue in case of suffering from an infectious disease or an inflammatory disease. The neutrophil elastase degrades proteins constituting the interstitium in various tissues of lung, cartilage, vessel wall, etc., such as elastin, collagen, proteoglycan, fibronectin and so on. It is also known that neutrophil elastase participates in degradation of other various proteins and injury of cells. Usually the activity of neutrophil elastase is controlled not to be in excess by an endogenous protease inhibitor such as a i-protease inhibitor, etc. However, it is considered that in the tissue where drastic<br><br>
inflammation occurs, as the amount of neutrophil elastase secreted from neutrophils increases and the endogenous protease inhibitor is inactivated by reactive oxygen spieces produced in that area, neutrophil elastase acts excessively and therefore, the tissue is injured. So it has been desired to have a medicament having neutrophil elastase inhibitory activity.<br>
The diseases which neutrophil elastase participates in include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including pulmonary emphysema and chronic bronchitis), chronic and acute interstitial pneumonia, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (UP), diffuse panbronchioHtis, cystic lung fibrosis, acute lung injury (ALl)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bronchiectasis, asthma, pancreatitis, nephritis, hepatitis (hepatic failure), chronic rheumatoid arthritis, arthrosclerosis, osteroarthritis, psoriasis, periodontal disease, atherosclerosis, organ transplant rejection, tissue injury caused by ischemia/reperfusion, shock, septicemia, blood coagulopathy including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DICJ and deep vein-thrombosis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.<br>
Furthermore, pancreas elastase is originally an exocrine digestive enzyme, but it is considered that pancreas elastase participates in injury of the pancreas tissue due to autodigestion in case of pancreatitis.<br>
Thus, although neutrophil elastase (and pancreas elastase in pancreatitis) is considered to participate in various chronic or acute diseases, there are a few compounds showing practical elastase inhibitory activity by oral administration and applicable to its chronic disease. Therefore, it is considered that an elastase inhibitory agent which is orally active is effective as a treating or prophylactic agent for<br><br>
these diseases.<br>
Under such expectation, various elastase inhibitors have been reported. For example, in European patent publication A 189305, many kinds of compounds having elastase inhibitory activity are disclosed. In claim 1 of the said patent publication, a compound represented by a following general formula (A-1J {corresponding to the formula lb of the said publication);<br><br>
wherein in the above formula (A-l), Ri is allsyl having 1 to 5 carbon atoms (See page 240 of the said publication), Ra is a group selected from alkyl having I to 10 carbon atoms, etc. (See page 241 of the said publication), R4 is hydrogen, etc., (See page 259 of the said publication), A is -CO-, etc., (See page 259 of the said publication), and n is 1, etc., (See page 259 of the said publication) is described.<br>
When the definitions of the above Rj, R2, R4, A and n are appb'ed to the above formula (A-l), the following formula can be written:<br><br>
By the way, R3 in the formula (A-2) is defined at pages 245-259 of the said publication. Although this definition is not surely clear, the definition of Ra in the item (VIII) described at page 258 of the said publication is relatively concerned to the compounds of the present<br><br>
invention mentioned below. Namely, Ra in the item (VIII) is defined as:<br>
"an aromatic heterocyclic group containing (a) from 1 to 15 carbons and from 1 to 4 heteroatoras each of which is selected independently from the group consisting of sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen, and (b) from 1 to 3 five or six-membered rings at least one of which is aromatic, and optionally, wherein up to 3 carbons of the aromatic ring(s) may be substituted at any carbon atom with a member of the group consisting of fluoro.., and provided further that any nitrogen may be substituted by an alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbons, provided that when A is OCO or NHCO then A must be bonded to a carbon of the aromatic heterocycle".<br>
However, in the proviso (3) at page 260 of the said publication, it is defined that no heteroatom may be directly bonded to a sulfur, nitrogen or oxygen. Judging from this definition, it is clear that the compounds of the present invention mentioned below are not included therein. Furthermore, no concrete compound wherein R3 in (A-2) corresponds to the above item (VIII) is described in the said publication at all.<br>
In addition, in J. Med. Chem., 1997, 40, 1876-1885, compounds included in the formula (A-2) of the said publication are described and following compounds as a compound relatively similar to the compounds of the present invention are described:<br><br>
wherein     R     is     2-pyridylcarbonyl,     3-pyridylcarbonyl,     4-<br><br>
pyridylcarbonyl or 4-imidazolecarbonyl.<br>
Although a compound wherein R is 2-pyridylcarbonyl shows a weak activity in Table 2 (page 1880) of the above article, these compounds are reported to have been inactive in the oral model (page 1879, right column lines 9-10).<br>

The salt of the compound (I) of the present invention is not limited, but preferably a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, for example, a salt with an organic base such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine and a salt with an inorganic metal such as sodium or potassium. Furthermore, several compounds of the compounds of the present invention form an acid addition salt with an organic acid such as tartaric acid, fumaric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, methanesulfonic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, gluconic acid, or an amino acid such as asparatic acid, or an acid additional salt with an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, etc.<br>
The compound (I) of the present invention may be in the form of a hydrate or a solvate. Furthermore, the compound (1} of the present invention exists in the form of an optically active compound, a stereoisomer or a mixture thereof, and all of them are included in the compound of the present invention.<br>
Process for preparation of the compound of the present invention:<br>
The compound of the present invention is novel and can be prepared, for example by the following method.<br><br><br>
wherein R1 is the same as defined above.<br>
Step 1:<br>
The step 1 is a step for preparation of compound (I-b'J by reacting compound (II) and compound (III). This step is carried out by mixing with stirring compound (H) and compound (HI) in the presence or absence of a base such as triethylamine without a solvent or in a solvent such as pyridine, dichloromethane or dimethylformamide. This step is carried out preferably, in the presence of a condensing agent such as l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimido hydrochloride, N,N'-dicydohexylcarbodiimide, l,l'-carbonyldiimidazole or N,N'-disuccinimidyl carbonate. With respect to the proportions of the quantities of the compounds (II) and (III), compound (III) may be used in the amount of 0.9 to 2 moles, preferably 0.9 to 1.5 moles per one mole of compound (II). The condensing agent may be used in the amount of 1' to 2 moles, preferably 1 to 1.5 moles per one mole of compound (II). The reaction is carried out at 0 to 40°C, preferably 0 to 25°C, for 1 to 20 hours, and preferably 2 to 15 hours.<br>
Thus obtained compound (I-b'J of the present invention (OH compound) is novel and used as a starting material in the following Step 2 for direct preparation of the compound (I-a) of the present invention (ketone compound), which is novel and useful as an elastase inhibitory agent.<br>
The compound (II) is known and can be prepared for example, by the method described in WO 00/52032. Almost all of the compounds of the compound (HI) are known, but some are novel. The said novel compounds are prepared in accordance with the method for preparation of the known compounds.<br><br>
Step 2<br>
The step 2 is a step for oxidation of hydroxy group of the compound (I-b'). The oxidation can be carried out by reacting compound (I-b') with an oxidizing agent in a solvent such as dichloromethane, dimethylfonnamide, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate or toluene.<br>
As the oxidizing agent, an iodobenzene derivative, namely Dess-Martin reagent is illustrated. In this step using Dess-Martin reagent, compound (I-bT) is dissolved in the above solvent, and thereto are added tert-butanol (1 to 2 mole per compound (I-b1)) and Dess-Martin reagent (1.5 to 3 moles, preferably 1.5 to 2.2 moles per compound (I-b')). The reaction is carried out at about 0 to 40°C, for 0.5 to 15 hours, preferably 1 to 2 hours. In addition, oxidations with diphosphorus pentaoxide in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, with l-ethyI-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyljcarbodiimide or N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide hydrochloride-dichloroacetic acid (ClxCHCOOH) in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, and with a combination of oxaryl chloride and triethylamine {Swern oxidation) are preferably conducted, too.<br>
The compound of the present invention is isolated from the reaction mixture by the conventionally known method for separation and purification, for example, concentration, extraction with a solvent, filtration, recrystalization, many kinds of chromatography, etc.<br>
Thus obtained compound of the present invention can be converted into a salt thereof, or can be subjected to desaltation by the conventional manner. When there are obtained many kinds of isomers, these isomers are separated by the conventional manner.<br>
An optically active compound of the compound (I-a) can be conveniently prepared by using an optically active compound of the<br><br>
compound (II) as a starting material.<br>
Elastase inhibitory agent of the present invention<br>
Among of the compounds (I) of the present invention, the compounds useful as an elastase inhibitory agent are compounds (I-a) (ketone compound), more preferably compounds (I-c).<br>
The compound (I-a) of the present invention or its salt (sometimes abbreviated as an active ingredient) shows neutrophil elastase inhibitory activity and pancreas elastase inhibitory activity in oral administration.<br>
An effective amount of the compound (I-a) of the present invention or a salt thereof is administered to a patient suffering from a disease caused by elastase.<br>

This experiment tested on in vivo efficacy of the compound of the present invention. When human neutrophil elastase is intratracheally administered to a hamster, the pulmonary hemorrhage is induced. A definite time later after administration of the elastase, in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by washing lung via trachea, hemoglobin is detected. This experiment was to estimate how potently the compound of the present invention inhibited the hemorrhage by measuring the hemoglobin concentration.<br>
Hamsters (Syrian strain, 7-10 weeks old male) were divided into groups consisting of 3 to 6, and each group was treated as follows:<br>
(A)	A group to which the compound of the present invention was<br>
not administered (disease control):<br>
Physiological saline solution (0.2ml) in which 25 unit of human neutrophil elastase (Elastin Product Co., Inc.) was dissolved was intratracheally administered to a hamster to induce the pulmonary hemorrhage. One hour later after administration of elastase, the hamsters were sacrificed by exsanquination, and alveoli were transtracheaUy washed twice with physiological saline (2.5 ml), and the hemoglobin concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (5 ml) was determined by measuring the absorbance at 414 nm.<br>
(B)	A group to which the compound of the present invention was<br>
administered:<br>
A fixed amount of the compound of the present invention was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and thereto was added 0.5%<br><br>
tragacanth gum to prepare a suspension. The suspension was orally administered to a hamster, 30 minutes prior to the administration of human neutrophil elastase (HNE) (final concentration of DMSO, 1%), and then, human neutrophil elastase was administered in the same manner as the above method (A). After 1 hour, the concentration of hemoglobin in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was determined in the same manner as the above method (A).<br>
