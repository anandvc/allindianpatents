The preisent invention relates to novel pyrimidine-sulfamides of the genera) formula I and their use as active ingredients in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions. The invention also concerns related aspects including processes for the preparation of the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more compounds of the general formula I, and especially their use as endothelin receptor antagonists.<br>
Endothetins (ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3) are 21-amino acid peptides produced and active in almost all tissues (Yanagisawa M et al.: Nature (1988) 332:411). Endothelins are potent vasoconstrictors and important mediators of cardiac, renal, endocrine and immune functions {McMJIIen MA et al.: J Am Coll Surg (1995) 180:621). They participate in bronchoconstriction and regulate neurotransmitter release, activation of inflammatory celts, fibrosis, cad proliferation and ced differentiation (Rubanyi GM et al.: Pharmacol Rev (1994) 46:328).<br>
Two endothelin receptors have been cloned and characterized in mamnrials (ETA. ETB) (Aral H et al.: Nature (1990) 348:730; Sakurai T et al.: Nature (1990) 348:732)- The ETA receptor is characterized by higher affinity for ET-1 and ET-2 Uian for ET-3. It is predominant in vascular smooth muscle cells and mediates vasoconstricting and proliferative responses (Ohistein EIH et al.: Drug Dev Res (1993) 29:108). In contrast, the ETB receptor has equivalent affinity for the three endothelin isopeptides and binds the linear fomi of endothelin, tetra-ala-endothem, and sarafotoxin S6C (Ogawa Y et ai: BSRC (1991) 178:248). This receptor is located in the vascular endothelium and smooth muscles, and is also particularly abundant in lung and brain. The ETB receptor from endothelial cells mediates transient vasodilator responses to ET-1 and ET-3 through the release of nitric oxide and/or prostacyclin whereas the ETB receptor from smootfi muscle ceils exerts vasoconstricting actions (Sumner MJ el al.; Bril J PharmacD) (1992)<br><br>
107:858). ETA and ETB receptors are highly similar in structure and belong to the superfamilycf G-proteIn coupted receptors.<br>
A pathophysiological role has been suggested for ET-1 in view of its increased plasma and tissue levels in several disease states such as hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, sepsis, atherosclerosis, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart faiJure, renal failure, migraine and asthma. As a consequence, endothelin receptor antagonists have been studied extensively as potential therapeutic agents. Endothelin receptor antagonists have demonstrated preclinical and/or clinical efficacy in various diseases such as cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage, heart failure, pulmonary and systemic hypertension, rteurogenic inflammation, renal failure and myocardial infarction.<br>
Today, only one endothelin receptor antagonist (Tracleer'*') is marketed and several are in dinical trials. However, some of these molecules possess a number of weaknesses such as complex synthesis, low solubility, high molecular weight, poor pharmacokinetics, or safety problems (e.g. liver enzyme increases). Furthermore, the contribution of differing ETA / ETB receptor blockade to the clinical outcome is not known. Thus, tailoring of the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties and the selectivity profile of each antagonist for a given clink:al indication is mandatory. So far, no endothelin receptor antagonists with a pyrimidine core stnicture containing a sulfamide unit, have been reported [2, 3, 5, 6. 8]. Surprisingly, we have discovered a new class of substituted pyrimidines of the structure below and found that they allow the specific tailoring described above and, in addition, compounds exhibiting mixed as well as ETA-selective binding profiles have been identified.<br>
The inhibitory activity of the compounds of general formula I on endothelin receptors can be demonstrated using the test procedures described hereinafter:<br><br>
For the &gt; valuation of the potency and efficacy of the compounds of the general formula I the following tests were used:<br>
1) InhibiJon of endothelin binding to membranes from CHO cells carrying human E T receptors:<br>
For com letition binding studies, membranes of CHO cells expFessing human recombir ant ETA or ETB receptors were used. Microsomal membranes from recombir ant CHO cells were prepared and the binding assay made as previously describet (Breu V., et al, FEBS Lett 1993; 334:210).<br>
The assc y was performed in 200 uL 50 mM Tris/HCI buffer, pH 7.4, inc uding 25 mM MnC 2, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% (wA/) BSA in polypropylene microtiter plates. Membrar es containing 0.5 ug protein were incubated for 2 h at 20'C with 8 pM [^^*I]ET-1 (4000 cpm) and increasirig concentrations of unlabelled antagonists. Maximun and minimum binding were estimated in samples without and with 100 nM ET-1 respectively. After 2 h, the membranes were filtered on fiiiterplates containin | GF/C filters (Unifilterplates from Canben'a Packard S.A Zurich, Switzeria id). To each well, 50 uL of scintillation cocktail was added (MicroScint 20, Canb ;rra Packard S.A. ZQrich, Switzerland) and the filter plates counted in a microplat! counter (TopCount, Canberra Packard S.A. ZCirk:h, Switzerland).<br>
All the te X compounds were dissolved, diluted and added in DMSO. The assay was run in the presence of 2.5% DMSO which was found not to interfere signifrcan ly with the binding. tCso was calculated as the concentration of antagonis: inhibiting 50 % of the specific binding of ET-1. For reference compoum is, the following IC50 values were found; ETA cells: 0.075 nM (n=8) for ET-1 and 118 nM (n=8) for ET-3: ETB celts: 0.067 nM (n=8) for ET-1 and 0.092 nM (n=3) or ET-3.<br><br>
The IC50 values obtained with compounds of general formula t are given in Table 1.<br><br>
The functional inhibitory potency of the endothelin antagonists was assessed by their inhibition of the contraction induced by endothelin-1 on rat aortic rings (ETA receptors] and of the contraction induced by sarafotoxin S6c on rat tracheal rings (ETB receptors). Adult Wistar rats were anesthetized and exsanguinated. The thoracic aorta or trachea were excised, dissected and cut in 3-5 mm rings. The endotheliunrt/eptthelium was removed by gentle rubbing of the intimal surface. Each ring was suspended in a 10 ml isolated organ bath filled with Krebs-Henseleit solution (in mM; NaCI 115. KCI 4.7, MgSO« 1.2. KH2PO4 1.5. NaHCOa 25, CaClz 2.5, glucose 10} kept at 37°C and gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The rings were connected to force transducers and isometric tension was recorded {EMKA Technologies SA, Paris, France). The rir&gt;gs were stretched to a resting tension of 3 g (aorta) or 2 g (trachea). Cumulative doses of ET-1 (iaorta) or sarafotoxin S6c (trachea) were added after a 10 min Incubation with the test compound or Its vehicle. The functional inhibitory potency of the test compound was assessed by calculating the concentration ratio, i.e. the shift to the right of the EC50 induced by different concentrations of test compound. ECso is the concentraton of endothelin needed to get a half-maximal contraction. pA2 is the<br><br>
negative logarithm of the antagonist concentration which induces a two-fold shift in the ECso value.<br>
The pA2 values obtained with connpounds of formula I are given in Table t'..<br><br>
Because of their ability to inhibit the endothelin binding, the described compounds can be used for treatment of diseases, which are associated with an increase in vasoconstriction, proliferation or inflammation due to endothelin. Exa-nples of such diseases are hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, coronary diseases, cardiac insufficiency, renal and myocardial ischemia, renal failure, cerebral ischemia, dementia, migraine, subarachnoidal hemorrhage, Raynaud's syndrome, digital ulcers and portal hypertension. They can also be used in the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis, restenosis after balloon or stent anfjioplasty, inflammation, stomach and duodenal ulcer, cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, prostatic hypertrophy, erectile dysfunction, hearing loss, amaurosis, chronic bronchitis, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, gram negative septicemia, shock, sickle cell anemia, glomerulonephritis, renal colic, glaucoma, connective tissue diseases, therapy and prophylaxis of diabetic complications, complicjitions of vascular or cardiac surgery or after organ transplantation, compli«itions of cyclosporin treatment, pain, hyperiipidemta as well as other diseases, presently known to be related to endothelin.<br><br>
