				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional applications Serial Nos. 60/894,096, filed March 9, 2007, and 60/915,066, filed April 30, 2007, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates generally to methods for preparing and storing embryonic plant tissue and its subsequent use in regeneration and transformation. The invention relates generally to methods for preparing and storing embryonic plant tissue directly fi-om dry seed and its subsequent use in regeneration and transformation. The resulting novel explant is storable and can germinate and or be transformed when appropriate conditions are provided.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Transformed plants may be obtained by directly treating meristematic tissue of a plant embryo (e.g. U.S. Patent 6,384,301). The meristematic tissue contains formative plant cells that differentiate to produce multiple plant structures including stem, roots, leaves, germ Hne tissue, and seeds. Plant embryos may be treated and selected or screened to determine which of those treated embryos have incorporated the new genetic information into germ line tissue. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,384,301 and 7,002,058 and U.S. Publication 20060059589 describe methods of genetically transforming soybeans (Glycine max) using bacterial-mediated gene transfer directly on the meristematic cells of soybean embryos.<br>
In typical soybean traasformation procedures, seeds are hydrated/imbibed to soften the seed coat and allow for or extraction of the explant tissue. After hydration the embryo or embryonic tissue is excised fi-om seed. When meristems are used as the explant, primary leaf tissue may be removed to expose the meristem of the soybean embryo. Considerable effort is involved in excising the embryos, transferring the genetic material into the embryos, and culturing the embryos. Processing can cause damage to the explant tissue, which negatively impacts subsequent transformation and regeneration steps. It is thus important to reduce damage to the explant tissue that could result in transformation and/or regeneration effort being applied to non-viable tissue.<br><br>
The excision of plant embryos is often therefore performed by hand. In this process, surface sterilized seeds are aseptically handled one at a time with gloved hands. The explant is then carefully tixcised. In the case of meristems, the seeds are carefully oriented in a manner as to eject the seed coat with applied force and then the embryonic leaves (cotyledons) are removed near the primary meristem to leave the seed embryo containing meristematic tissue. Even the carefiil handling of individual seeds, however, results in less than desirable recovery of viable embryos, and may be less than 70% even with high quality seeds.<br>
Bacterial contamination of embryos after excision is also a significant concern. The increased handling to pieserve higher viability and recovery of explants also increases the likelihood of destructive contamination (which will manifest itself in subsequent processing steps). Such contamination can result in significant loss, as a single contaminated explant will contaminate other samples during tissue culture. This causes loss of yield and/or transformation fi-equency, and eventually transformation efficiency. Moreover, the manual excision is extremely labor intensive, time-consuming, and stands as a barrier to a scaling up of the transformation process in which many plants must typically be treated to yield desired results.<br>
In addition, the current processes are limited because the harvested explant must be moved quickly into the subsequent steps of transformation, or viability is lost. Typically, once an explant is harvested (e.g. U. S. Patent Application Publication 20050005321 and corresponding PCT Publication WO 2005/000471), it is placed on media and subjected to co-culture with transforming bacteria within hours of being removed. Thus, anytime transformations are to be performed, it is necessary to first prepare all of the explants that will be needed so they are ready to immediately move into an incubation or transformation process. This timing can be very complicated and inflexible, particularly if sudden demands arise and explants cannot be prepared in time. Clearly, the lack of an ability to store such explants for more than a few hours is a major deficiency in the art.<br>
There remains a great need for processes that can increase the availability of transformable embryos without unacceptably increasing total costs and/or timelines of explant preparation for transformation. The ability to store excised meristematic tissue (explant) for later use in particular has been lacking. Such methods would substantially increase the availability of transformable embryos, and allow efficient planning and<br><br>
execution of large-scale transformation studies. Such methods should enable explant storage to meet demands creaited during peak operational hours or during inadvertent disruptions in the production line and shipping of explants, for example, to different sites for maintaining production runs. Further, the use of dry embryo explants (artificial seeds) for transformation is not known in the art due to common wisdom in the art to use "wet" explants for transformation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a seed explant having a specified moisture content. In one embodiment, lan explant may comprise an internal moisture content of from about 3% to about 20%. In a further embodiments, an explant provided herein may be defined as a storable, substantially intact embryo axis containing at least some meristem tissue that is extracted fi-om a seed with an internal moisture as specified herein, for example, from about 3% to about 20%.<br>
In another aspect, the invention comprises a method for producing obtaining a plant comprising the steps of: (a) obtaining a dry plant seed; and (b) preparing an explant firom the plant seed under conditions wherein the explant does not germinate and remains viable and competent for germination and or genetic transformation.

In certain embodiments, the explant comprises a substantially intact seed modified to expose at least a first transformable cell of the seed. In other embodiments, the method for preparing the explant may comprise drilling at least a first aperture in the seed, or nicking the seed. The seed or explant comprises meristematic tissue.<br>
In certain embodiments the method may further comprise the step of (c) transforming at least a first cell of the explant with a selected DNA, and (d) regenerating a transgenic plant from said cell, wherein the regenerated plant is stably transformed with the selected DNA. Regenerating may be performed at a temperature of up to about 35°C. The explant may further comprise meristematic tissue, for instance an embryonic meristem. In one embodiment, a plant may be regenerated without the use of one or more plant growth regulators such as to alter the development of the explant.<br>
In other embodiments, tlie method may comprise storing the explant prior to step (c) or (d) under conditions wherein the explant does not germinate. In yet other embodiments, the seed or explant may be dehydrated prior to or after preparing the<br><br>
explant.   A transformable and regenerable explant produced by the method is also an aspect of the invention.<br>
In certain embodiments, the conditions in step (a) or (b) may comprise a seed or explant internal moisture content of from about 3% to about 25%. In particular embodiments the conditions in step (a) or (b) may comprise a seed or explant moisture content of from about 4% to about 16%. In certain embodiments, the method may be defined as comprising reducing the moisture content of the plant seed and/or the explant prior to step (c). In other embodiments, the method may ftirther be defined as comprising increasing the moisture content of the explant prior to, concurrently with, and/or after step (d).<br>
Further, the methods may be defined as ones wherein step (a) and/or step (b) is performed in the absence of a ] iquid. Alternatively, the methods may be defined as ones wherein step (a) and/or step (b) is performed in the presence of a liquid. In yet other embodiments, the methods may be defined as ones wherein step (a) and step (b) are performed in the absence of a liquid. The conditions in step (a) or (b) may comprise a temperature of between about -80°C and about 60°C. In particular embodiments, the temperature may be between about -20°C and about 40°C.<br>
In other embodiments, the method may be defined as one wherein step (b) is further defined as comprising obtaining a plurality of explants from plant seeds and selecting an explant from the plurality based on a characteristic associated with the ability to transform the explant and/or regenerate a plant from the explant. In particular embodiments, the characteristic is selected from the group consisting of color, size, shape, density, proximate analysis, carbohydrate content, protein content, fat content, volatile content, fibre (ash) content, moisture content, viability, germplasm, intactness, pathogen presence, and optical characteristics.<br>
In certain embodiments, the method may be further defined as comprising sanitizing the plant seed and/oi the explant prior to or concurrently with step (c). The method may further comprise priming the seed by contacting the seed with an aqueous solution. The aqueous solution may comprise a disinfectant such as bleach or alcohol. The method may further be defined as comprising disinfecting the plant seed and/or the explant prior to step (c). In certain embodiments, the method may comprise disinfecting the explant, wherein disinfecting comprises application of a disinfectant selected from the<br><br>
group consisting of bleach, alcohol (e.g. ethanol), ozone, chlorine gas, ultraviolet light, temperatures of-20°C or loweir, and exposure to a temperature higher than 40°C or 50°C.<br>
The method for obtaining an explant from a seed may be automated. In certain embodiments, the method comprises an automated process in which the plant seed is oriented as it passes through a mechanical separator to provide a substantially uniform output of regenerable meristematic plant tissue. The method may be performed on bulk seed using the force generated with opposing rollers, such as illustrated in FIG. 6, for example, as well as on singulated seed such as illustrated in FIGs. 2-5, for example.<br>
In some embodiments, the transformation method may be carried out by bacterially-mediated transformation, or by microprojectile bombardment. Explant transformation may be carried out prior to, or subsequent to, explant disinfection. The method may be performed wherein the fransgenic plant is regenerated without producing a callus tissue culture, by organogenesis or by direct meristem transformation and subsequent shoot growth.<br>
Further, the method may comprise storing the explant for from about 1 hour to about 2 years prior to step (c) or step (d). In certain embodiments the method may comprise storing the explant for from about 1 hour to about 24 hours. The explant may be hydrated or pre-cultured after storage.<br>
Another aspect of the invention comprises an apparatus for preparation of transformable embryonic plant tissue from singulated seed comprising: (a) a holder for a singulated seed; (b) a means for applying a force to the seed being held so as to divide the seed into separate cotyledons, stsed coat and embryonic tissue. The apparatus may ftirther comprise: (c) a means for separating the embryonic tissue from the seed coat and cotyledons and (d) a means for cleaning and/or sterilizing the tissue. FIGs. 2-5 illustrate an apparatus for preparation of transformable embryonic plant tissue from singulated seed. As shown in FIG. 3, the apparatus (1) comprises a holder (2) for the singulated seed (16). As shown in FIG. 2, the holder (2) comprises an upper and lower seed fixture (3,4); and means for applying force to the seed (16) at a shear force point or plane (5), to divide the seed (16) into separate cotyledons, seed coat, and embryonic tissue. The holder may comprise vacuum cups (6) that maintain the position of the seed (16) while applying a shear force to it. FIG. 4 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the holder (2), wherein serrated knurled posts (7) maintain the position of the seed (16) while applying shear<br><br>
force. The vacuum cups or serrated posts turn in opposite directions, generating the force which results in division of the seed (16) at or near the shear force point (5). The apparatus fiirther comprises vacuum generators (8) or similar means for removing components of a sheared singulated seed from the vicinity of the holder (2), allowing the next seed to be placed therein.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a method useful for bulk separation of embryonic meristem tissues from cotyledon tissue and seed coat tissues. Sheer is generated between rollers. In this example, one is metal and one is an elastomer. Dry seed is passed between these two rollers at a gap setting appropriate for the seed type, and sheer is applied such that the seed is split and seed coats and cotyledon parts can be further separated from the desired meristem containing embryo a:ds, for example, utilizing adjustable air flow and properly sized screens or the like.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates an apparatus for separating embryonic tissue from cotyledon, seed coat, or other debris, and cleaning the tissue. As shown in the separator (13) of FIG. 7, sterile air flows through a manifold (9) into an explant delivery and recovery chamber (10). Air flow forces the plant material comprising embryonic tissue into an explant free flight area (11), where materials are separated. The apparatus may further comprise an explant excluding chamber (12) to prevent explant loss but allow passage of dust and airflow out of the separator (13), and anmeans for static removal such as an ion generator (17). FIG. 8 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the separator (13), comprising charged plates (14) to collect d\ist, mold spores, or the like. FIG. 9 illusfrates yet another embodiment of a separator, further comprising a means for sterilizing the tissue. As shown in FIG. 9, a sterilizing means such as germicidal UV lamps (15) may be placed within the separator (13), such as within the explant free flight area (11), to sterilize the explant tissue.<br>
Still yet another aspect of the invention is a method for preparing fransformable and regenerable explant materid comprising meristematic tissue from a singulated seed, comprising: a) subjecting a sing;ulated seed that comprises a seed coat, cotyledon tissue , and meristematic tissue to a force sufficient to fracture the seed; and b) separating the meristematic tissue from the seed coat and optionally the cotyledon tissue, wherein the method is mechanized. A transgenic plant produced by this method, wherein the method further comprises transforming and regenerating the explant material to produce a<br><br>
transgenic plant, is also an aspect of the invention. In certain embodiments the plant may be a soybean, cotton, onion, pepper, rice, wheat, cucurbit, canola or com plant.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following is a detailed description of the invention provided to aid those skilled in the art in practicing the present invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art may<br><br>
make modifications and variations in the embodiments described herein without departing fi"om the spirit or scope of the present invention.<br>
The invention provides methods and compositions for preparing and recovering and storing explants, for instiince, using mechanization and automation. Fluid can be used to move explants and separate desirable explants fi-om debris during mechanized handling of seeds and embr&gt;'onic tissue, including compressed air, other gases, and liquids. Wet or dry excision of plant embryos to yield transformable meristematic tissue may be performed, followed by immediate use in transformation methods. Alternatively, wet or dry excised embryos may be subsequently dried and stored for later transformation or other use and dry excised embryos may be stored as such or after drying them fiarther depending upon their moisture content at the time of excision..<br>
Flexibility of plant transformation methods is increased by redefining the storage product fi-om seed to transformation-ready explant. Explant preparation can occur at off-peak times and days, and explants stored for later use, greatly enhancing the efficiency of the overall transformation process. Advancements in excision, processing, explant isolation and storage, and manipulation make this process much more labor efficient and well suited for high volume, liigh-throughput transformation needs. Methods for the manipulation of the moisture content of the seed to adjust seed shattering characteristics and subsequent seed and explant vigor and process yield are also provided by the invention. Transformable embryos and meristems produced by the described methods are fiirther an embodiment of the invention.<br>
In one embodiment, an explant prepared in accordance with the invention may be defined as having an internal moisture of about 4-25%, including about 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25% internal moisture, and specifically including all ranges derivable between any two such values. In particular embodiments, seeds fi-om which explants are to be prepared may be harvested at a predetermined internal moisture suitable for isolating transformable material therefrom. In certain non-limiting embodiments, seeds from which explants are obtained may be defined as having an internal moisture of about 3-25%, including about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25% internal moisture, and specifically including all ranges derivable between any two such values, such as, for example, from about 4% to 16%. In certain embodiments, brittleness of seeds may be altered by manipulating moisture content, allowing for efficient splitting of seeds and preparation of explants. For instance, an intemal moisture content such as 3% to 7% may<br><br>
be advantageous. Seeds may be held at such moisture contents or any other moisture content yielding stable storage conditions (and transformable explants) prior to use. The seeds in certain embodiments may be soybean or cotton seeds, and may also be, without limitation, com, canola, onion, pepper, tomato, cucurbit, rice, common bean, peanut, maize, wheat, or rapeseed seeds.<br>
Dry explants may be used that have been excised from seed under low moisture conditions, and may be prepared as dried wet explants by excising from seed following hydration/imbibition where the explant is subsequently dehydrated and stored, including combinations thereof The explants may be of various ages. In one embodiment, explants are relatively "young" in that they have been removed from seeds for less than a day, for example, from about 1 to 24 hours, such as about 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 20, or 23 hours prior to use. In other embodiments, explants may be stored for longer periods, including days, weeks, months or even years, depending upon storage conditions used to maintain explant viability. Those of skill in the art in particular will understand that storage times may be optimized such that the quality and/or yield of transformants as well as the efficiency of the transformation process is maximized. This can be carried out for any particular transformation protocol, for example, such as Agrobacterium-mediated fransformation, microprojectile bombardment transformation, as well as other transformation procedvires.<br>
Prior to embryo excision, seeds may be subjected to an optional culling step intended to remove seeds with a high degree of bacterial or fimgal contamination and also seeds that may for any reason would be unlikely to produce viable embryonic tissue for use with the present invention. Culling may be carried out, for example, based on parameters such as the size, color, or density of the seed or other physical characteristics that in other contexts would be unobjectionable, and may be adjusted empirically by variation of the excision, sterilization, and storage parameters and by measurement of ultimate yields of viable tissue and of regeneration and fransformation efficiencies. Examples of culling methods may include the use of an automatic scale after size sorting. An optical sorter suitable for this purpose is the Sortex Seed Sorter or the Satake ScanMasterT"^ II (Satake USA Inc., Houston, TX). Other culling techniques may also be employed including culling by moisture content.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, recovered dry explants may be washed prior to use in a fluid, which can be a gas or liquid. An example of use of a gas includes<br>
10<br><br>
flushing dry explants in sterile air while de-ionizing explants to remove static. Further, specifically charged plates and UV germicidal lamps can be used to remove undesirable particles such as contaminants and microscopic dust. Dry explants may also be subjected to a hydration (pre-culture) to increase internal moisture content prior to being transformed with a heterologous nucleic acid. Transformation is alternatively carried out prior to priming or germination. In this embodiment, seed and/or explant sterilization is carried out, e.g., using CI gas, followed by chipping or breaching of the seed protective outer skin by other means, allowing infiltration of a liquid Agrobacterium culture. This process can be carried out immediately following the sterilization and breaching of the seed coat, or after continued storage.<br>
The invention may in particular aspects involve sterilization of explants prior to excision and/or post-excision. Sterilization can include contacting seed or explant material with various fluids {i.e. liquid or gaseous) that serve to reduce or eliminate the presence of viable bacterial or fungal contaminants that could otherwise interfere with seed or embryo viability and later plant tissue culture. Sterilization by application of liquid may also hydrate or partially hydrate the plant tissues, and serve the purpose of priming seeds or embryos. Methods for sterilization include, but are not limited to, use of chlorine gas, ozone, solutions of bleach or alcohol, ultraviolet light, temperatures of -20°C or lower, and exposure to a temperature higher than 40°C.<br>
Splitting of seeds to isolate the explant may be performed manually or by an individual using a variety of mechanical techniques in order to isolate the explant. Seeds may be split in half along the axis of the cotyledon, using tools such as forceps or by hand. For instance, a seed may be split or fi-actured along the axis of the cotyledon by applying direct pressure to the seed along the same axis. This may be accomplished, for example, by striking the seed with a hard object, or by using a press, such as a standard arbor press {e.g. Dayton 4Z328A or Dayton 4Z329D; Dayton Tool Company, Dayton, OH). Some seeds will split such that the explant may be immediately separated. Other seeds may split along the axis of the cotyledon, but may still require additional manipulation to isolate the exphuit. Automated mechanical excision of hydrated embryo tissue comprising meristems may also be attempted by putting seeds through counter rotating cylinders and collecting resulting seed material, for instance as is described in U.S. Patent Publication 20050005321.<br>
11<br><br>
In some embodiments, a dry seed or an explant may be first primed, for example, by imbibition of a liquid such as water or a sterilization liquid, redried, and later used for transformation and regeneration. In other embodiments, the seed or the explant may be primed by raising the internal seed moisture content to greater than 30%, holding the seed or the explant at a time point, imd then re-initiating imbibition at a later time point. In an alternative embodiment, the seed or the explant may be primed by raising the internal moisture content to greater thaa 30%, storing the seed or the explant for a predetermined period, drying the seed or the explant to the internal moisture content of below 20%, and then re-initiating imbibition.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, explant quality yield can be optimized by pre-orientation of seeds prior to seed disassembly. In this manner, the relatively random impact of the seeds hitting a roller in an automated machine is controlled, thus controlling the splitting of the seeds between the cotyledon halves.<br>
Any method to separate desired explant material from individual split seeds or the bulk yield of split seeds may be used (e.g. a process as shown in FIG. 6, or use of an apparatus as shown in FIGs. 2-5 and FIGs. 10-11), for instance by automated processing. Such methods may include aspiration in which a partial vacuum is applied to a first chamber containing bulk yield from the rice sheller or other machine. The first chamber consists of a series of alternating angled sides. As seed material falls down these sides and into a collection vessel, vented slots in the chamber allow lighter material to be pulled into a second chamber. Airflow, and thus the weight of the seed material being pulled through, is controlled by valves. FIG. 6 describes an exemplary automated process for excising and separating explant material from seed coats and other tissues. Following excision the excised explant may then be stored under appropriate temperatiire and moisture conditions for later use.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, rather than performing excision of bulk seed, seeds are singulated prior to explant excision, and excision is performed on the singulated seed, for instance, via a high throughput method (e.g. FIGs. 2-5). The seed (e.g. a soybean seed) may be manipulated by a vacuum cup system to locate the seed, and then placed between holders such as a set of vacuum cups or serrated surfaces. In a particular embodiment the seed coat is removed by use of a blast of high pressure air or other fluid, or particles, to pulse or blast the seed coat from the seed. The seed tissue may then be manipulated and placed into a suitable container for ftirther manipulation, such as<br>
12<br><br>
embryo excision, culling, processing, storage, and transformation. In another embodiment, culling, selection, or other processing steps may occur prior to seed singulation. The singulated sesed may be at a predetermined moisture level, for instance as determined by storage conditions following seed harvest. The singulated seed may be automatically imaged for analysis of pre-determined quality, for instance, to test for viability, chemical and biological properties, and suitability in the transformation or regeneration process. The excised explant may be stored under appropriate temperature and moisture conditions for later use. An apparatus for high throughput excision of transformable meristematic tissue from singulated seed is also an embodiment of the invention (e.g. FIGs. 2-5).<br>
Another method for sepiarating explant material is by manual sieving. Bulk yield from the rice sheller or other machine is put througji a series of geological separation sieves, such that unwanted large and small debris are separated from the desired explant by size exclusion. This is effectively accomplished, for instance with soybean material, using U.S. Standard sieves (listed from top to bottom): #7 (2.8 mm opening), #10 (2.0 mm opening), #16 (1.18 mm opening), and then a collection pan on the bottom. Large debris collected on either the #7 or #10 sieves, while desired embryo explant material is retained and collected on the #16 sieve. Unwanted fine particles passed through to the collection pan. The explant yield collected on the #16 sieve may be fiirther purified by placing this yield into a vertical airflow separation column (e.g. an OREGON SEED BLOWER; Hof&amp;nan Manufacturing, Jefferson, OR) in which air is passed through the material, blowing lighter unwjinted material upward where it is trapped for removal. Modification of the column with various static reduction means would allow for dust removal from embryo surfaces and reduce bio-contamination and remove any unnecessary plant cell and tissue.<br>
Mechanized sieving and airflow separation may also be utiUzed. For instance, bulk yield from the Rice Sheller is fed into a machine that utilizes vibration and gravitational pull to sieve and separate the unwanted seed material from the desired explants. As an example, the CLIPPER OFFICE TESTER (Clipper Separation Technologies; A.T. Ferrell Company, Bluffton, IN) may be utilized. This machine has two slots for separation screens to be inserted, whereby seed material is separated according to size.  In addition, this machine utilizes a fan that duplicates the ftmction of<br>
13<br><br>
the previously mentioned vertical airflow separation device, thus giving a final purified yield of explants (FIG. 1) in a single step.<br>
In one embodiment, a machine for splitting the seeds is stacked over a mechanical separator for continuous flow-through of material and for greater automation (FIGs. 10-11). The seeds are placed in the machine such as a Grainman® Laboratory Paddy Rice Sheller (e.g. Model #64-115-60-WDC; Grain Machinery Manufacturing Corp., Miami, FL). Much of the light material such as seed coats are separated by aspiration during the excision/splitting process (e.g. FIG. 2, FIG. 6) and the heavier seed fractions i.e., cotyledon pieces and the explants fall directly into a mechanical separator which separates the cotyledons from the explants by way of size exclusion by using vibrating sieves and gravity. Airflow is used to aspirate dust and other light seed debris out during separation (e.g. FIGs. 7-9).<br>
Regenerable transformable explants may be harvested that contain no, some, or a part of each cotyledon remaining attached to the embryonic tissue, for example as much as YA of the cotyledon. These explants are considered substantially similar, as they may each result in a stable transformed plant. The explant should however contain at least some of the meristematic region of the embryo such that typically the explant can produce a shoot within 12 weeks of the onset of tissue culture growth conditions.<br>
The explant may be recovered from a hydrated seed, from dry storable seed, from a partial hydration of dried hydrated explant, wherein "hydrating" or "hydration" is defined as any act to yield an increase in the moisture content of a seed and/or explant, without limitation as to wheth(a" or whether not the seed and/or explant being hydrated has been subject to dehydration. An explant may be from seed that is "primed"; that is, a seed that has initiated germination but has been appropriately placed in stasis pending favorable conditions to complete the germination process. Those of skill in the art will be able to use various hydration methods and optimize length of incubation time prior to fransformation. The resulting novel explant is storable and can germinate and or be transformed when appropriate conditions are provided. Thus the new dry, storable meristem explant may be referred to as an artificial seed.<br>
Examples of such hydration and priming conditions are presented below in Tables 4-8. For instance. Table 4 illustrates placing explants following excision in a 15mL conical tube with 5 ml of sterile distilled water (SDW) for a period of 4 hours. A typical<br>
14<br><br>
protocol for machine excision, such as the "SOP" treatment, may involve placing seeds for 15 minutes in a bleach solution of 200 ppm active CI, followed by a 2 hour period of no liquid exposure, followed by an overnight hydration in either bean germination medium (BGM) or a bleach solution of 50ppm active CI.<br>
Following excision, one of skill in the art may store the explant according to the disclosed methods prior to subsequent use. Methods and parameters for drying, storing, and germinating seed are known in the art {e.g. Senaratna et al, 1983; Vertucci and Roos, 1990; Chai et al, 1998). Storage of excised meristems in accordance with the current invention may be carried out using modifications of such storage conditions as desired. Any such conditions may be used as desired, including at temperatures, for example, of from about -80°C to about 60°C. Temperatures of about -20°C to room temperature in particular have been found to fimction well, but the invention is in no way limited to these temperatures.<br>
The data described in the Examples illustrates, for instance, that stored seed explants comprising meristematic tissue may remain viable and useful for subsequent genetic transformation and regeneration for weeks or months following excision firom seeds {e.g. Example 11 and Table 14). Manipulation of excision, sterilization, storage, hydration, redehydration, and transformation parameters allows development of efficient automated high throughput plant transformation protocols.<br>
A number of parameters for obtaining and handling explants may be varied. In one embodiment, the excision method may be manual; in an alternative embodiment excision occurs by an automated process. In other embodiments sterilization may be performed by contacting a seed or explant with a liquid sterilizing agent. In an alternative embodiment, a seed or an exphint may be contacted with a gaseous sterilizing agent. In an alternative embodiment, a seed or an explant may be contacted with an irradiating sterilizing agent such as UV lig;ht. FIGs. 7-9 illustrate apparatuses for such sterilization methods. In an altemative embodiment, a seed or an explant may be sterilized by subjecting the seed or the explant to a brief period of high temperatures so as to reduce the vigor of biological contaminants such as adventitious bacteria and fungi on the surface of the seed or the explant without reducing the vigor of the seed or the explant. This can be achieved at a temperature higher than 40°C; preferably the temperature is between 40°C to 90°C.   The temperature can be raised, for instance, by either forced<br>
15<br><br>
heated air or steam. Such temperatures can be provided by dryers produced by Bry-Air Inc. (Sunbury, Ohio, USA). In still a further embodiment, moisture content of the seed at the time of excision may be varied. In another embodiment, the temperature of the seed at the time of excision may be varied. In other embodiments, a storage parameter following excision may be varied. For instance, in one embodiment the relative humidity \mder which explant storage occurs may be varied. In another embodiment, the explant storage temperature may be varied. In yet other embodiments, the length of explant storage time may vary. In yet other embodiments, the composition of the medium in which the explant is stored may vary. Further parameters that may be manipulated include hydration and rehydration media compositions, incubation temperature, length of time, and transformation methods, among others.<br>
Various methods have been developed for transferring genes into plant tissue including high velocity microprojection, microinjection, electroporation, direct DNA uptake and, bacterially-mediated transformation. Bacteria known to mediate plant cell transformation include a number of species of the Rhizobiaceae, including, but not limited to, Agrobacterium sp., Sinorhizobium sp., Mesorhizobium sp., and Bradyrhizobium sp. {e.g. Broothaerts et al., 2005; U.S. Patent Application Publication 20070271627). Targets for such transformation have often been undifferentiated callus tissues, although differentiated tissue also has been used for transient and stable plant transformation.<br>
Bacterially-mediated gene delivery {e.g. Agrobacterium-xaeAisXoA; U.S. Patent 5,563,055; 5,591,616; 5,693,512; 5,824,877; 5,981,840) can be made into cells in the living meristem of an embryo excised from a seed, such as soybean {e.g. U.S. Patent 6,384,301). The meristematic region may be cultured in the presence of a selection agent such as the herbicide glyphosate. The result of this step is the termination or at least growth retardation of most of tlie cells into which the foreign genetic construction has not been delivered and the simultjmeous induction of the formation of shoots, which arise from a small cluster of cells including a transformed meristematic cell. The meristem can also be cultivated in the presence of other selection agent alone or in combination, including, but not limited to auxin-like herbicides such as dicamba or 2,4-D, MCPA, glufosinate, acetolactate synthase inhibitors, protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitors, and hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate-dioxygenase inhibitors, neomycin, kanamycin, paramomycin, G418,   aminoglycosides,   spectinomycin,   streptomycin,   hygromycin   B,   bleomycin.<br>
16<br><br>
phleomycin, sulfonamides, streptothricin, chloramphenicol, methotrexate, 2-deoxyglucose, betaine aldehyde, S-aminoethyl L-cysteine, 4-methyltryptophan, D-xylose, D-mannose, benzyladenine-N-3-glucuronidase. Examples of various selectable markers and genes providing resistance against them are disclosed in Miki and McHugh, 2004. In one embodiment of the invention a coding region for the selectable marker aminoglycoside adenyltransferase (aadA) conferring resistance to spectinomycin or streptomycin is used (e.g. U.S. Patent 5,217,902; or Sandvang, 1999).<br>
As is well known in the art, other methods for plant transformation may be utilized, for instance as described by Miki et al, (1993), including use of microprojectile bombardment {e.g. U.S. Patent 5,914,451; McCabe et al., 1991; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,015,580; 5,550,318; 5,538,880).<br>

A variety of tissue culture media are known that, when supplemented appropriately, support plant tissue growth and development, including formation of<br>
18<br><br>
mature plants from excised meristems or embryos. These tissue culture media can either be purchased as a commercial preparation or custom prepared and modified by those of skill in the art. Examples of such media include, but are not limited to those described by Murashige and Skoog, (1962); Chu et al., (1975); Linsmaier and Skoog, (1965); Uchimiya and Murashige, (1962); Gamborg et al, (1968); Duncan et al., (1985); McCown and Lloyd, (1981); Nitsch and Nitsch,(1969); and Schenk and Hildebrandt, (1972), or derivations of these media supplemented accordingly.

EXAMPLE 1 Separation of explant material<br>
Seeds were processed manually, or subjected to automated excision in a rice sheller {e.g. Grainman® Laboratory Paddy Rice Sheller (e.g. Model #64-115-60-WDC; Grain Machinery Manufacturing Corp., Miami, FL), or for instance as described in U.S. Patent Publication 20050005321. hi order to obtain meristematic explant material, soybean seeds (cv. A3525; Asgrow Seed Company) were processed to separate the embryo, comprising meristematic tissues, from the seed coat and cotyledon(s). The effect of the internal moisture content of the starting seed at the time of excision on explant yield from this process is shown in Table 1.<br>

Moisture Content of Soybean Seed	Explant estimate per Kg of seed processed<br>
6.3%	1626<br>
8.2%	939<br>
11.5%	87<br>
The temperature of the seed prior to preparation of explant material also affected explant yield. Table 2 illusfrates that explants can be excised at various temperatures, including -20°C to room temperature.<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
Recovery of explant material<br>
Table 3 illustrates the yield of usable explant tissue given differing seed moisture content at the start of the excision procedure. Lower seed moisture (about 6.2%) allowed for greater yield of explant material by weight of seed processed. This is noteworthy, as the internal moisture content of dry soybean seed when freshly harvested from the field is approximately 9 to 14% and is ideally maintained at about 11% for long term (1 to 20 years) storage. The higher moisture content allows the seeds to be handled without breakage and loss of vigor to the embryo. The inventors discovered that dry seed at the higher moisture content were much less brittle than seed dried to lower internal moisture contents (3% to 7%). This discovery allows seed to be handled and stored at the ideal<br>
20<br><br>
internal moisture content for \'igor (approximately 9 to 12%), yet manipulated for ideal extraction of dry explants (artiiScial seeds) by drying seeds to approximately 3% to 7% to achieve a brittleness. This brittle state maintains vigor of the embryo, yet allows for a clean split of the seed between the cotyledons, and thus allows both high quality, and high yield.<br>
The optimum moisture content to achieve a brittle state and thus allow high process yield and high transformation quality explant may vary based on soybean genotype and crop type. This example illustrates the methodology necessary to optimize conditions for a given germplasm source or type of plant seeds.<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
Sterilization of Seeds and/or Explant Material<br>
A number of techniques of sterilizing seeds before excision, as well as sterilizing explants after excision from the seeds were tested. Post-excision sterilization of dry explants using chlorine gas in a vacuum desiccation chamber was tested at time intervals ranging from 15 minutes to 16 hours. Contamination control increased with longer exposure to CI gas, although fungal contamination grew in treatments in which the exposure to CI gas had surpassed the survivable threshold of the explants.<br>
Ozone gas treatments were also tested. Both whole seed (before excision) and dry explants (after excision) were exposed to O3 gas in a PLEXIGLAS chamber (OSR-8 Ozone Generator; Ozone Solutions, Sioux Center, lA) at various time intervals of 1-24 hours. O3 was used at a concentration of 467 ppm. After seed was exposed to ozone, embryonic material was excised and explant viability was measured. Ozonation of soybean seed for 12 hours or less did not impact viability of subsequently isolated explants, but drastically decreased bioburden found in explants. Ozonation of dry excised explants for as little as 1-4 hours decreased explant health {i.e. number of viable embryos).<br>
Additional tests on pre-excision sterilization of whole seed were performed using a bleach solution of 200 ppm active chlorine, followed by an overnight hydration period (~9 hours) in a solution of 50 ppm active chlorine. These seeds were then allowed to dry in a laminar flow hood (typically for 12-48 hours) before being excised mechanically. A modification to the 50% bleach soak protocol was also tested, in which the seeds were first rinsed with a 70% solution of ethanol. The ethanol was immediately drained (total exposure to ethanol was less than 5 seconds), and then the 50% bleach soak was performed by treating seeds 3-15 min in 50% bleach followed by 3 rinses with water and drying the seeds overnight such that the moisture content was less than 8%. UV light may also be employed to sterilize the plant material.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Hydration of Seeds and Explant Material<br>
Studies employing new pre-culture hydration/germination strategies were tested. The types of media used for this step included "bean germination medium" (BGM; Media Table 11), soy inoculum medium (INO; Media Table 11), and prepared log-phase Agrobacterium growth<br>
cultures (AGRO).  The Agrobacterium growth culture was grown overnight in Lysogeny Broth<br>
23<br><br>
(LB, also commonly referred to as Luria-Bertani Broth) to log phase, and then centrifiiged and resuspended to a final optical density at 660nm of 0.25 to 0.6. The medium used for the dilution is the same as the soy inoculum medium. Plant Preservative Mixture (PPM^M, Product #P820; Phytotechnology Laboratories, Shawnee Mission, KS) was also tested at a concentration of 2 mg/L (as per manufacturer recomraiendations on label). Explants were soaked in this solution overnight at 4°C. Other variations were made in the duration of exposure to respective hydration media, the various temperatures during this exposure, and the extent of saturation in the respective media. Exposure times tested ranged from 0 to 24 hours. Temperatures during longer exposure times (those greater than 4 hours) were either room temp (~26°C), 23°C, or 4°C. Exposure times of 4 hours or less were all tested at room temperature. As an alternative to completely submerging or substantially saturating explants with liquid media during the hydration process, some treatments employed the use of moistened filter paper (enough liquid to wet, but not to saturate). This was done with filter paper moistened with either BGM or Agrobacterium<m medium. hydration was performed in a variety of vessels including but not limited to conical centrifuge tubes graduated glass bottles or plantcon tissue culture container biomedicals irvine c></m>
This example also demonstrates that hydration can be done in a variety of media containing various types of carbohydrates such as glucose (INO), and sucrose (BGM). Other carbohydrates such as galactose may be useful in hydration medium.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Transformation and Cultivation of Soybean Explants<br>
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation followed the hydration step as indicated in Tables 4-9. Soybean meristem explamts were transformed with pMON67438 comprising a CP4 EPSPS gene conferring glyphosate tolerance and a GUS reporter gene. Explants that had been hydrated in something other than Agrobacterium culture medium, i.e. soy inoculum medium (INO) or sterile distilled water (SDW), bean germination medium (BGM), or Plant Preservative Mixture, had that liquid removed, and then the explants were rinsed twice with sterile distilled water. Explants were then placed in a PLANTCON (if not already in one). Prepared Agrobacterium culture (as described above) was added to the container (enough to cover all explants within the PLANTCON). Explants that were hydrated in Agrobacterium culture to begin with remained in that culture, and were also transferred to a PLANTCON. Explants were then subjected to sonication wounding for 20 seconds while in the PLANTCON according to<br>
24<br><br>
standard procedures (U.S. Patent No. 7,002,058). Following sonication wounding, explants were transferred to new PLANTCONS containing a cut-to-size piece of filter paper. 2.5mL to 5mL of soy inoculum medium was used to moisten the filter paper. Explants were co-cultured at 23°C for 2 - 4 days either in dark or light. Following co-culture, explants were placed on the surface of solid woody plant medium (WPM; Table 12), and implanted into solid woody plant medium at approximately the 17* day post-inoculation, for the remainder of the tissue culture experiment phase. Shoots were transferred to Bean Rooting Medium for rooting (BRM; Table 13). Concentrations of various hormones may be manipulated to effect regeneration. For examples, BAP may be used at 0.04 ppm (0.18 ^M) in WPM and lAA may be used at about 0.099 ppm (0.565 ^M) in BRM. Other plant growth regulators and concentrations have been routinely utilized to facilitate transformation and regeneration, for instance as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,384,301.<br>
Explants that had been placed within assay well plates for initial hydration were left there for the entire duration of the experiment life span, including sonication and co-culture periods. For these experiments, liquid media was used instead of solid media, and was replaced with fresh media at ~17 days post inoculation. This demonstrates that the explants are amenable to liquid culture as well as solid (gel-based) tissue culture steps.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Comparison of Explant Excision, Sterilization, Storage, and Hydration Parameters<br>
Subsequent studies tested a \'ariety of parameters involving seed storage, excision, and sterilization methods and conditions; explant storage conditions; and transformation conditions as they impacted the ability of excised meristematic material to initiate shoot formation (SF), whether or not having been transformed, as well as transformation frequency (TF). These parameters, for either or both seed and explant material, included pre- or post-excision sterilization procedures, storage conditions, hydration conditions, and subsequent tissue culture conditions, including in the absence or presence of selection.<br>
In study SAG_709 (Table 4), whole soybean seed were sterilized prior to excision by immersion in a 50% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution. Following sterilization, seeds were rinsed and dried to a moisture content of 
25<br><br>
under a broad range of storage temperature and a variety of hydration media. The result of DNA testing showed a normal distribution for copy numbers based on the sample size.<br>
In Study SAG? 12 (Table 5), soybean seeds were sterilized with CI gas prior to dry excision. Following sterilization and dry excision, length of storage and hydration conditions were varied. This was compared with wet excision method as described in U.S. Publ. 20050005321 and U.S. Patent No. 7,002,058 (Trt 7).<br>
In Study SAG? 14 (Table 6), seeds were sterilized prior to excision by immersion in a 50% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution. Following sterilization, rinsing, drying, and dry excision, explants were stored for one to three days prior to transformation at various temperatures (e.g. -20°C, 4°C, and room temperature), and hydration conditions were also varied. The ability of explants treated in this maimer to form shoots (shoot frequency; "SF") or transformed plants (transformation frequency; "TF") was compared with explants that were prepared by a "wet excision" metliod, for instance as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 20050005321 and then dried and stored (Trt 7 and Trt 8).<br>
Transformation has also be
1)	Dry seeds are rinsed with sterile water, or a solution of Sodium hypochlorite (ranging from 0 ppm to -30,000 ppm active chlorine, including 50 ppm and 200 ppm active chlorine) for 3 to 20 minutes. Liquid is then drained.<br>
2)	Approximately 2 hours later, rehydration medium is applied for 5 to 24 hours. This rehydration medium can be BGM, sterile deionized water, sterile or clean tap water, or a dilute disinfectant solution, such as sodium hypochlorite with an active chlorine content of 50 to 1000 ppm.<br>
3)	Following rehydration medium, the seeds may be immediately excised to isolate embryo explants (either by mechanical or manual methods), or may be further rinsed with water or other dilute disinfectant, such as sodium hypochlorite with an active chlorine content of 50 to 1000 ppm for 15 minutes.<br>
26<br><br>
4)	Following its excision and recovery, the explant is dried and prepared for storage by being spread out in a shallow tray under a flow of air. This is typically done in a clean-air tissue culture hood. Explants were tj'pically allowed to dry for -18 to 24 hours.<br>
5)	Dried explants were stored (typically in sealed 50mL conical tubes). Storage duration prior to transformation initiation can range from minutes to weeks or months. Temperature conditions during storage can range from room temperature to '80 degrees C.<br>
6)	Following desired storage, explants were hydrated for transformation as described in example 4.<br>
Study 716 (Table 7) tested the effect of a 7 day storage period following dry excision on the ability of explants to form shoots.<br>
Study 762 (Table 8) tested the effect of a 7 week storage period on the ability of excised explant material to form shoots. A dry excised embryo that was stored for up to 7 weeks was able to produce a transgenic plant.<br>
An overall summary of shoot-formation and transformation frequencies for the above listed studies is found in Table 9. The results indicate that dry excised as well as wet-excised (and then dried) soybean explants remain viable, retain the ability to form shoots and plants, and may be successfully transformed with heterologous DNA, even after dry storage of excised embryos for periods of time up to 8 weeks under a variety of temperature conditions and types of hydration media. Shoot formation frequency (SF) and transformation frequency (TF) of dry excised and stored explants or wet excised, dried, and stored explants compared favorably with those of explants that were not stored, according to previously described methods (U.S. Publ. 20050005321). The copy number and presence of introduced transgenes (e.g. CP4), and presence of vector backbone sequences (e.g. oriV) was also tested by Southern analysis or by INVADER assay (e.g. Mein et ai, 2001) at the RO generation (Tables 5-9). DNA analysis of Rl plants yielded the same results demonstrating stable and heritable transformation<br>

35<br><br>
Another parameter that was varied in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was a change in the timing of Agrobacterium culture onset, and sonication wounding initiation. Instead of waiting for 1 hour or more for dry explants to hydrate, sonication wounding procedures in some studies were initiated immediately upon submersion in the hydration medium. Alternatively, some treatments received a 1 to 2 day delay in the onset of Agrobacterium culture inoculation. Instead of being inoculated immediately after the hydration step, these explants were placed on moistened filter paper for the delay period, and then inoculated and sonication procedures were completed. In a different treatment, the sonication wounding step was left from the procedure completely, as explants were being hydrated on filter paper moistened with Agrobacterium culture.<br>
Also tested was a delayed onset of selection pressure {e.g. exposure to glyphosate). Instead of transferring explants onto solid media with selection compound at 2-4 days post inoculation studies received liquid WPM without glyphosate for additional 48 hours, or 1 week before being transferred to the solid WPM with selection compound to terminate or at least retard the growth of non-transformed cells.<br>
An alternative to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was also tested. Dry excised explants were inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum strains RL 2370LBA &amp; RL 2048G, pMON96033. The protocol for Rhizobium-mediai^ transformation was similar to Agrobacterium-vaedxaied transformation, except for replacing the bacterial strain with Rhizobium.<br>
A cytokinin, 6-Benzylamino purine (BAP) was also tested as an additive to the Agrobacterium culture inoculum medium (also referred to as soy inoculum medium, INO) {e.g. McCabeand Martinell, 1993).<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Preparation and Transformation of Cotton Explants<br>
Excised cotton (cv STN 474) meristem explants dried after excision and stored dried for 30 days or more are viable after re-hydration and co-culture transformation with Agrobacterium. The protocol for cotton meristem transformation essentially followed the method of McCabe and Martinell (1993). Seeds were excised and prepared as per McCabe &amp; Martinell (1993), with the exception that excised embryos were spread out and left in an open container until dry. Storage conditions, and seed pre-sterilization, re-hydration, Agrobacterium inoculation, co-culture and tissue culture procedures were essentially identical<br>
36<br><br>
to those described for soy. Consistent with results from soybean, shoots and young leaves were observed on cultured cotton explants following transformation of meristematic tissue with exogenous DNA.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 9<br>
High Throughput Single Seed Excision<br>
The dry excision process may also be accomplished by use of a singulation system to provide individual (singulated) seeds for processing. After singulation the seed (e.g. a soybean seed) is manipulated by a vacuum cup system to locate the seed. The seed is then placed between a set of vacuum cups and the seed is pinched between the cups, allowing removal of the seed coat by use of a blast of high pressure air alternatively a similar arrangement to pulse, sandblast, or air blast the seed coat from the seed. As shown in FIGs. 2-3, the seed (16) is placed on the lower vacuum cup (6) and the seed is pinched by lowering an upper vacuum cup (6). The seed and the two vacuum cups are then rotated in opposite directions to produce a shearing force point or plane (5) along the center of the elliptical axis of the seed to facilitate the splitting of the seed in the elliptical axis plane. Upon splitting the upper vacuum cup is lifted, and/or one of the vacuum generators (8) is turned on, allowing manipulation of the explant and its separation from other portions of the seed. The explant may then be moved to a desired location such as a tube or a well plate. In FIGs. 4-5 a similar concept is executed, with the inclusion of a metal serrated surface to help to rotate the seed without slipping. This system includes vacuum placement and pickup units. Although the explant may comprise some cotyledonary tissue in addition to its embryonic tissue, it contains at least some of the meristematic region of the embryo such that typically the explant can produce a shoot within 12 weeks of the onset of tissue culture growth conditions.<br>
The object of this process is to remove the meristematic tissue of the seed under dry conditions on a single seed high-speed basis and to then place the explant in a suitable container for additional transfomiation steps. Additional explant processing (e.g. sterilization, culling or hydration) may also be performed between the removal of the explant from the seed and its delivery to the container. Additional processing could also include advance imaging of the explant for desirable traits and characteristics, sterilization and transformation treatments. Alternatively, seed could be imaged and sorted for viability and suitability before going through the singulating and explant removal process. Such methods<br>
40<br><br>
allowing for high throughput explant excision can be made more efficient through parallel systems.<br>
FIGs. 2-5 and 7-9 illustrate embodiments of mechanical separators and cleaner/sterilizers for use in excising transformable embryonic tissue from seed. FIGs. 2-5 illustrate mechanisms for holding a single seed as a shear force is applied, FIGs. 7-9 illustrate embodiments for mechanically cleaning and sanitizing explant material using, for example, an ion generator, charged plates to collect mold, dust, etc.; or UV germicidal lamps.<br>
Referring now to FIGs. 2-5, which generally illustrate examples of a mechanized apparatus for excising embryonic tissue from singulated seed (16), the singulated seed is held so as to apply a shear force as described. In FIGs. 2-5, the first and second vacuum cups (6) and first and second knurled posts (7) turn in opposite directions as a single seed rests or is pinched against them, resulting in fracture of the singulated seed. Other means for holding singulated seed, such as rollers or gyrates that allow application of an appropriate shear force, may also be employed.<br>
Upon fracturing of the se(;d and excision of transformable embryonic tissue, the explant comprising embryonic tissues (e.g. FIG. 1) may be moved to a desired location or container for immediate use or storage imder appropriate conditions, for instance as described in Example 6 above. This method for excising explant material from singulated seed allows automated high throughput preparation of convenient amounts of fransformable embryonic tissues.<br>
Cleaning, culling, sterilization, and selection procedures may be applied to non-excised seed in bulk, or following singulation, or they may be applied to explant material following excision. FIGs. 7-9 illustrate exemplary cleaner/sanitizers for performing such operations on explant material.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Stacked Equipment for High-throughput Explant Preparation<br>
As shown in FIG. 10, the seeds are placed in the mechanized apparatus on top (e.g. a Grainman® sheller; see Example 1) to be split as also described, for example, in Example 9 and in FIG. 6. Much of the light material, such as seed coats, are separated by aspiration during the excision process, and the heavier seed fractions, such as cotyledon pieces and explants fall through for fiarther separation of cotyledons from other explant material. In this "stacked" configuration (FIGs.   10-11), the heavier fraction now falls directly into an<br>
41<br><br>
automatic separator which separates the cotyledons from the explants, for instance by size exclusion with vibrating mesh screens and gravity (e.g. as achieved by the CLIPPER OFFICE TESTER or similar component). Airflow may also be used to aspirate dust and other light seed debris away from the desired material, to clean and/or to sterilize the material (e.g. FIGs. 7-9; FIG. 11). These machines and processes are also described individually (e.g. Example 9), however their combination by stacking for continuous flow-through represents a further improvement in the process and apparatus.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Transformation of dry-excised soy explants stored for extended periods of time<br>
Dry-excised explants were stored for up to 20 months at -20°C to 4°C, and then tested for survival, transformability and vigor. Explant survival and overall vigor appeared to be similar in all freatment groups, regardless of storage conditions or temperature compared to confrol treatment (Treatment 1). Ifhis demonstrates the ability to store dry-excised explants for almost two years without detriment. Explants from each freatment were tested for transient GUS expression 4 days after inoculation. Table 14 shows a comparison of meristem specific gus expression between treatments, scored on a scale from 0-9, with 0 being no visible expression, and 9 being extensive expression in all 3 meristems of the embryo. This demonstrates that dry-excised explants can not only survive long-term storage in various conditions without significant loss of vigor, but they also retain amenability to fransformation. Thus it is now possible to excise large quantities of explants during off-peak times for later use, which represents significant potential cost savings and flexibility in planning and executing transformation studies.<br>

EXAMPLE 12<br>
Identification of suitable Pre-inoculation culture C^Pre-culture") compositions and<br>
conditions<br>
It is likely that dry excised explants are still in a state of semi-dormancy when they are inoculated with Agrobacterium for transformation. Thus a method was developed to stimulate the metabolic activity of the dry excised explants prior to Agrobacterium inoculation, for increasing their transformation competency. That is, by manipulating the biology of the dry explant, it is possible to increase % germline positive events per explant by 2 to 10 fold.<br>
Several media compositions: BGM (Table 10), INO (Table 11), or OR (Table 15) were tested at 23°C and/or 28°C temperatures, and under different light/dark conditions from 1 to 5 days, for their ability to enhance transformation competency. After pre-culturing step, explants were pooled together and inoculated with the Agrobacterium culture according to the method described in Example 5. Transient GUS expression assays performed on explants showed increased GUS activity in the pre-cultured treatments after 2 days and 4 days of co-culture.<br>
Plant losses occurred due to fimgal infection in some of the pre-culturing experiments, but overall TF of the dry excised explants that were pre-cultured on filter papers wetted with BGM at 23"C in dark for 5 days appeared to be highest when compared with dry excised explants that were not pre-cultured. The losses due to fimgal contamination could be mitigated by using an anti-fimgal agent such as BRAVO 75 and Captan 50 at about 1% each during the pre-culture and/or co-culture step. Southern blot and INVADER analysis of the plants produced in this example with a CP4 probe confirmed the transgenic nature of these plants.<br>

Studies were repeated comparing two constructs, pMON101343, comprising one T-DNA that comprises a CP4 gene specifying glyphosate resistance and an OriV replication origin; and pMON107350 comprising one T-DNA that comprises a CP4 gene specifying glyphosate resistance and an OriR replication origin (e.g., see US20070074314) in the vector backbone. Again, pre-culturing of dry explants boosted TF as compared to the TF of non pre-cultured dry explants, as shown in Table 17. Table 17: Additional studies on pre-culture of dry-excised explants.<br>

As shown in Table 18, pre-cultured dry excised explants also yielded higher TFs when explants were cultured in liquid regeneration medium (media of Table 12 except for AgarGel) which was removed and added automatically using a robotic system. TF appeared<br>
44<br><br>
to be even higher with the liquid regeneration medium with a pre-culturing step. Wet excised explants in liquid media appear to have had low TF due to contamination.<br>
Pre-culturing surprisingly improves competency for transformation and improves transformation uniformity. Such improvements reduce variability during production runs at industrial scale for producing transgenic soybean plants and are likely to improve TFs where selection agents in general yield lower TFs.<br>

EXAMPLE 13<br>
Production of transgenic soybean plants using dry soybean explants and spectinomycin<br>
selection<br>
Dry, viable, seeds (properly stored quality soybean seed comprise approximately 10<br>
to 12% internal moisture content) were rinsed with sterile water, or a solution of Sodium<br>
hypochlorite (ranging fi-om 0 ppm to -30,000 ppm active chlorine, including 50 ppm and 200<br>
ppm active chlorine) for 3 to 20 minutes.  Liquid was then drained. This process raises the<br>
internal moisture content to approximately 16%. Following this brief surface sanitation step,<br>
the seed internal moisture content was lowered in a commercial seed dryer with a flow of<br>
dehumidified air (temperature controlled to approximately 60 to 90 degrees F) to less than<br>
8%.<br>
Following desired storage, explants were hydrated for transformation. The types of media used for this step may be varied and included "bean germination medium" (BGM; Table 10), soy inoculum medium (INO; Table 11), and prepared log-phase Agrobacterium growth cultures (AGRO). The Agrobacterium growth culture was grown overnight in Lysogeny Broth (LB, also commonly referred to as Luria-Bertani Broth) to log phase, and then centrifuged and resuspended to a final optical density at 660nm of 0.25 to 0.6. The medium used for the dilution is the same as the soy inoculum medium. Hydration temperatures and durations also caji be varied, with some experiments having explants that<br>
45<br><br>
were soaked in one of these solutions overnight at 4°C. Other variations were made in the duration of exposure to respective hydration media, the various temperatures during this exposure, and the extent of saturation in the respective media. Exposure times tested ranged from 0 to 24 hours. Hydrations during longer exposure times (those greater than 4 hours) were done at either room temp (~26°C), 23°C, or 4°C. Exposure times of 4 hours or less were all tested at room temperature. As an alternative to completely submerging or substantially saturating explants with liquid media dxiring the hydration process, some treatments employed the use of moistened filter paper (enough liquid to wet, but not to saturate). This was done with filter paper moistened with either BGM or Agrobacterium-culture medium. Hydration was performed in a variety of vessels, including but not limited to conical centrifijge tubes, graduated glass bottles, or a PLANTCON tissue culture container (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA).<br>
After hydration, explants were briefly sonicated in the presence of the appropriate Agrobacterium cultures. Co-culture and subsequent steps were performed in lighted Percival incubators for 2 to 5 days (16 hours of light, 8 hours of dark, with light intensity of at least 5^iE to 200\xE) at a temperature of approximately 23 to 25°C, and may be performed up to about 35°C. Light is known to promote gene transfer from Agrobacterium to plant cells. Spectinomycin was applied as a selection agent either during hydration, in co-culture steps, and/ or following co-culture at 15 mg/L to 1000 mg/L.<br>
Phenotype positive shoots (plants) were routinely recovered, as shown in Table 19, using the construct, pMON96999, comprising one T-DNA comprising an aadA gene and an OriV origin of replication or the construct, or pMON101343 comprising one T-DNA comprising a CP4 gene and an OriV origin of replication. By "phenotype positive" in the presence of spectinomycin, it is meant that shoots are green and robust, while phenotype negative shoots are weak and bleached (white), if they elongate at all. Spectinomycin or glyphosate were used in the regeneration medium (both solid or liquid) at the concentration shown in Table 19.<br>
Table 19. Transformation frequency of dry soybean explants using glyphosate or spectinomycin as selective agent.<br><br>
Spectinomycin (%TF)	Glyphosate (% TF)<br>

Spectinomycin was also used as a selective agent for transformation of dry excised soybean embryos utilizing the following conditions: 1 hr hydration in INO medium, 4 days co-culture in INO, 150 ppm spectinomycin, with culture on solid or liquid WPM (Table 12, with or without added agar). Temperatures of 23-25 or 28°C, up to about 35°C, may be utilized. Phenotype positive shoots were harvested at 8 and 10 weeks post Agrobacterium inoculation, and rooting was induced on solid BRM (Table 13) with 150 ppm Spectinomycin. Very high transformation frequencies of 25.05% and 19.27% were obtained in two different studies. Explants used in this study were not treated with cytokinin-like plant growth regulators (such as TDZ or BAP), thus demonstrating that high fransformation frequency could be achieved in the absence of such plant growth regulators.<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
Production of transgenic soybean plants using dry soybean embryos, spectinomycin,<br>
and liquid culture medium<br>
In these studies, explants were initially hydrated and eventually regenerated on WPM solid media with Hquid overlay or WPM liquid medium as above. All explants were transferred at 6 weeks post inoculation to frays containing Oasis® Wedge System (Smithers-Oasis USA; Kent, OH) and a simplified liquid medium (0.5 g / L WPM with 0.25 mg/L IBA). Rooted and shooted Ro plants were obtained two to 4 weeks later. In all studies and treatments, initial hydration of explants was done for 1 hour in the respective media as shown in the Table 20. Liquid culture medixum was the same as in Table 12 except glyphosate was replaced by spectinomycin at 150 ppm. In liquid overlay freatment both solid and liquid culture media were used; liquid medium was dispensed over the top of explants as they were lying on solid medium at a specified time during tissue culture as identified in the Table 21. This was done as a type of media refreshment and avoids the need for fransferring explants from old media to new media. In the confrol treatments, explants were surface plated on a solid WPM medium (Table 12). Shoots were harvested and rooted on solid BRM as described above, except glyphosate was replaced with spectinomycin at 150 ppm.<br>

EXAMPLE 15<br>
Production of transgenic soybean plants using dry soybean embryos, spectinomycin, and transferring the whole regenerated explant with a pre-culturing step<br>
In these studies, as with Exjunple 12, a pre-culturing step (5 days 23 °C dark in BGM) was used. A one hour hydration of the dry excised explant on INO medium was also done before the pre-culturing step. About 12 mis of liquid WPM containing 150 ppm of spectinomycin was dispensed directly into the co-culture PLANTCON after the co-culture period, and explants were surface plated on solid WPM containing 150 ppm spectinomycin 4 days later. In this example, phenotype positive green shoots were identified at about week 4 of regeneration and transferred from WPM regeneration medium to trays containing Oasis Wedge System (Smithers-Oasis US5A; Kent, OH) and a simplified liquid medium (0.5 g / L WPM with 0.25 mg/L IBA). Rooted and shooted Ro plants were obtained two to 4 weeks later. Overall, pre-culturing in these studies also improved TF % (Table 22). Percentage quality events shown below (Table 22) refers to the proportion of transgenic events demonstrating the presence of 1-2 copies of both a gene of interest (GUS) and a marker gene (aadA) by Invader^'^ assay. Estimated marker-free TF (mTF) refers the % of events without the marker gene. Explants used in this study were freated with 1.0 ppm TDZ during co-culture, thus demonstrating that high transformation frequency with dry explants could be<br>
48<br><br>
achieved in the presence of a cytokinin-like plant growth regulator, which could be used in<br>
promoting shoot proliferation..<br>

EXAMPLE 16<br>
Production of transgenic soybean plants using stored dry soybean embryos, spectinomycin, and transfer of whole regenerated explant with a pre-culturing step<br>
In this example, 3 months stored dry explants were used, and a 1 hr hydration step carried out in INO was utilized, on dry excised explants. Pre-culturing was performed for 5 days at 23°C in dark conditions in BGM with 50 ppm nystatin and 10 ppm TBZ (thiabendazole) fungicides (nystatin and TZB Stock is made as by dissolving 50,000ppm Nystatin and 10,000 ppm TBZ in pure DMSO, diluted 1000 fold (1ml of stock in IL of INO)). TDZ (1.0 ppm) and lipoic acid were both added to the inoculum and to the co-culture media (INO). The construct, pMONI07379, was a conventional 2T vector comprising oriRi and aadA gene, and co-culture was done for 5 days. After co-culture the explants were surface plated on solid WPM and then transferred to the Oasis® Wedge System (Smithers-Oasis USA; Kent, OH) with a simplified liquid medium (0.5 g/L WPM with 0.25 mg/L IBA). As shown in Table 23, pre-culturing dry explants boosted TF. Thus, 3 month old stored dry explants could perform similarly to fi-eshly excised dry explants. The addition to INO Co-culture media of nystatin (50 ppm) and thiabendazole (10 ppm) dissolved in DMSO (1.0 ml of DMSO per liter of INO) improved the health of explants, likely by controlling yeasts and fimgi commonly found in and on seeds and therefore can be beneficial when performing large and/ or automated tissue culture.<br>
