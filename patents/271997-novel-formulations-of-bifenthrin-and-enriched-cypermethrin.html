NOVEL FORMULATIONS OF BIFENTHRIN AND ENRICHED<br>
CYPERMETHRIN<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/152,919 filed December 22,2005.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of insecticides and insecticidal compositions. In particular, the invention relates to novel insecticidal compositions comprising bifenthrin and enriched cypermethrin that are physically stable when diluted with water.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
To enable the efficient elimination or controlling of imwanted insects in agricultural and other applications, it is desirable to use effective chemical insecticides on these unwanted pests. Formulations containing multiple insecticides are desirable in order to broaden the spectrum of economically important insect, mite, and other pest species killed or controlled and take advantage of the individual pesticidal characteristics of each of the active ingredients.<br>
Compositions containing two or more insecticides have been practiced in the art, but problems with the physical stability of such mixtures in water have caused application and efficacy issues. When traditional insecticidal compositions are combined, the combined components (surfactants, viscosity modifiers, wetting agents) of both may cause accelerated physical degradation (phase separation) of the mixture when diluted in low to moderately hard water. This physical degradation can occur in the mix tanks prior to application on plants or another locus where control is desired. Often this problem goes unnoticed and a uniform application of the insecticide .mixture is not achieved, yielding inadequate efficacy.<br>
Typically, in commercial applications, the insecticidal formulation comprises less than one percent of the tank mixture to keep the cost of the formulation low, while still yielding spectrum and onset of visual symptomology benefits. The<br>
 <br>
physical stability of the formulation when diluted with water is a key problem in the art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, novel liquid formulations comprising bifenthrin and enriched cypermethrin have been found which have significantly improved the physical stability when diluted in water.<br>
DETAILED DESCRTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to novel insecticidal compositions comprising bifenthrin and enriched cypermethrin in an insecticidal formulation having significantly improved physical stability when the composition is diluted in water.<br>
zeto-Cypermethrin is a potent and quick acting insecticide, which controls a broad spectrum of chewing, sucking and flying insects. In addition to controlling chewing, sucking and flying insects, the pyrethroid bifenthrin is also active against a number of key mite pests and exhibits a longer residual activity than zeta-cypermetbrin.<br>
•The term "bifenthrin" means 2-methyIbiphenyl-3-ylmethyi (Z)-(lRS)-cis-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-l -enyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxylate.<br>

 <br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Dilution stability studies were conducted using 2.5 mL of the fonnulation of Example 1 added to 47.5 mL of water with 342 ppm hardness in a 50 mL Nessler tube. The Nessler tube was sealed with a rubber stopper and the contents mixed by inverting the tube ten times. The Nessler tube was placed in a tube rack at ambient temperature and the percent separation was recorded at 2.0 hours and 4,0 hours. The percent separation was calculated by first measuring the height of the separation, if any, then the total height of the mixture. Dividing the separation height by the total height and multiplying by 100 provides the percent separation. Table 2 sets forth the dilution stability percent separation of the formulations described in Example I and Table 1. The formulations are identified by the formulation code corresponding to those in Example 1 and in Table 1.<br>
As a control experiment, 6.0 grams of a commercially available formulation of bifenthrin (Capture 2EC available from FMC Corporation) and 1.2 grams of a commercially available formulation of zete-cypermethrin (Mustang Max 0.8EC* available from FMC Corporation) were blended together in 1.2 grams of Aromatic 200. The concentration of AI's was similar to the concentration of AI's in fonnulation code F2. A dilution stability test was performed using 2.5 mL of the control blend in 47.5 mL of water containing 342 ppm hardness as described above. The dilution stability percent separation results of the control experiment are presented in Table 2.<br>

The Nessler tube was sealed with a rubber stopper and the contents mixed by inverting the tube ten times. A total of three Nessler tubes were prepared in this manner. One Nessler tube was placed in a tube rack maintained at 0°C, one in a tube rack maintained at ambient temperature and one in a tube rack maintained at 30 "C, all were maintained for 24 hours. The percent separation after 24 hours was 0% for each temperature.<br>

 <br>
mixture was allowed to cool to less than 40°C at which time 8.S grams of refined glycerine (Agnique QLY99-U) and 010 grams of preservative (Legend MK) were added. The resulting mixture was stirred until a homogenous solution was obtained while cooling to ambient temperature.<br>
