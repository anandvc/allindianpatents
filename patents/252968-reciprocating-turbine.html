				<td>NATURE:<br>
The title of the invention is "Reciprocating Turbine" according to its' working process. The field in which the machine can work and, be utilized is hydro power generation. It may be mechanical or electrical. Previous turbines which are already existed in this field have blades or vanes in their construction. This rtiachine does not have blades. This machine have a piston which reciprocates in the bore. If there is a difference between two hight's of water, we can use this machine. This will be performed   Using potential energy of water.<br>
THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:<br>
There should be a big main pipe. When pipe will be filled with water completely having rro air bubbles in it water will flow through it with a great speed Though its inlet and outlet are at downwards than it's position of the middle part. At the same time the inlet must be at "higher positions and the outlet must be at lower positions.<br>
The machine should be fixed to the inlet of main pipe and it must not be fixed to the outlet. Outlet will be dipped in the water of a small tub. So air will not enter into the main pipe. A care must be taken about air not to enter in the machine also and the water level should be maintained in that way.<br>
The piston has two springs which help to maintain the position of piston valve according to the situation arised when machine is working.<br>
h<br><br>
I explain the first stage of machine's working process, hi thi^piston valve will be closed^bottom valve will be opened. Two masses which are fixed to the two massy wheels will be at downwords. Middle valve will also be opened. When it will be under the position that has been said as abo\-e-to start the machine we will remo\'e the (lid)cap. Which is fitted to the outlet of main pipe. Radious of main pipe is greater than the radious of exteriorcase(Bore). It is 2 or 3 times greater When compared. So main pipe must have greater radious. When the cap(lid) is removed water flows through the main pipe and machine. So piston will also nio\'e to the forward(upwards) position with some power until it hit\s the first rod. Then the piston valve will be opened and at the same time the bottom valw will be closed consequeirtTyT Water will not run (flow)through the pipe. This .siiuaiinn iiuiic;ilcs \hc initial position of second stage. The masses of wheels will ho ;il upwaids.<br>
I explain the second stage which is mentioned as abo\e follows the given changes, 'fhe masses of wheels comes to down wards. Consequently piston moves to downwards until it hit's the middle valve. Then the middle valve and piston valve both will be closed and the bottom valve will be opened. This situation indicates the intial position of first stage. The water fiows through the main pipe and piston mo\'es in the upwards direction. Like the above the two stages follow each other consequenth'. Then the turbine will give some power from it's output wheel, which rotates itself around it and about the centre of wheel. Power efficiency may be nearly 60% according to my practicals.<br>

1)	The First stage Is shown in Pig,No, 1 of  drawing sheet No, 1<br>
2)	The  Second stage is shown in Fig, No,2 of drawing sheet No,2<br>
3)	The whole machinery is shown In Pig,No,3 of  Drawing sheet No,3 A view of  massy wheel is shown In Fig,5  and A view of piston is shown in Pig.4  and 6,<br><br>
#â– .        At first this machinery is arranged as shown in Fig.3. Then the positions of<br>
different parts of machine are as follows. The masses of two massy wheels<br>
are at down position. The bottom valve will be opened and the piston valve<br>
and middle valve both are closed.   The lower end of rod of piston valve is<br>
pressing the middle valve. The pipe is in siphon mode. The outlet of the pipe<br>
is covered by a cap. The out let is dipped in the water of small Tub.<br>
When we remove the cap from the outlet of pipe. Then the water will be<br>
allowed tO; under the influence of atmospheric pressure.    So the water will be<br>
drawned to downwards.   The piston along with the water moves from it's initial<br>
position   When it reaches the first rod. The upper end of the rod of piston valve will<br>
be iiil wilii the llrst ro;id, in such a way that llie piston \a!\o will be opened.  Ai the<br>
same lime   Second rod iiits the iifler to lilt up liie boiioni \al\e.   iiicn liie lifter lift"s<br>
up the bottom valve with the iron wire. So the bottom \alve cover the inlet of bore.<br>
Consequently the water will be stopped to flow. Then there is no,flowing of water.<br>
Meanwhile the piston valve comes to down wards in the bore    With the help   of<br>
power which is in the running massy wheels. In other words the massy wheels take<br>
the piston valve and piston to downwards. Thenit's lower end Pressed the middle<br>
valve. Then the bottom vahe, which stopped the flowing of water, will be opened and<br>
allows water to flow out.  At the same time   There is no relation between the lifter<br>
and bottom valve.  As soon as the bottom valve will be opened   The piston will be<br>
pushed forward along with the water. The masses of two mass\- wheels will be lifted<br>
in the running of wheels   Wheeels willbe rotated by means of two joints, rods and<br>
'U' type rod. So then there is "Start of Water". Again the upper end of rod of<br>
4<br><br>
the piston valve Hit's the First rod and ;At the same timeicoiTsequently. 1 second rod hit's the lifter and the lifter lift's up the bottom valve and then result's the "Stop of Water", Again massy wheels make the piston to hit t he middle valve. The bottom valve will be opened. Then it result's to start of water. The above procedure of "Stop and Start" follows each other. Consequently machine run's with some power according to it's potential energy of water. We can take the power through the output wheel. Whenever if we need not run the machine we may cover the outlet with cap.<br>
The piston valve will be used to create a hole. When there is "Stop position". So piston comes freely to downwards ie., towards bottom valve. If there is no valve inpiston it become's impossible to reach downwards. This same piston valve is used to cover that hole In such a way that even a single drop of water will not be allowed. So piston will be pushed to forwards when there is "Start Position".<br><br>
there are two types of pistons. FIRST TifPEi First type piston has Inflexible walls. First type piston has no expanding Walls which are pulled towards the wall of inside of Bore in the reciprocating action. Piston moves in the Bore with some friction In Both directions. This friction is same either in upward or downward. So energy will be consumed to remove  the friction in Both directions.<br>
SECOND TyPE;       Ihe  Second type piston has flexible and    expanding Walls (Automatic-expansible walls  )  which are pulled towards      the wall of inside of  Bore    in the reciprocating action    in    upwards movement only due  to atmospheric    pressure.   SÂ© some       friction will be   there in upward's    movement only,     So energy      will    be consumed to remove the friction In that upward's direction    only. At the  same  time  tfae     Bottom valve will be opened and allows the water.   Next In downward* s movement    we  shut the  Bottom valve.   SÂ© atmospheric pressure will not be  there,   as in  (Fig.2 of  Sheet No.2) Then Walls are not pulled towards the wall of inside of  Bote,and keeping soma  small gap between the bo'ifft^ piston and Inside of    Bore^<br>
Because  the wall of piston is Inlts original nature.   Then    the piston comes freely without having    friction.     3Â© energy will not be consumed.     In view of  friction in downward's direction      only. So    this type of piston has beeter efficiency when i*e corrpared with    First type piston.     This Is shown in Fig.6 of Sheet No,3<br>
TO RUN THE MACHINE TWO CYCLES(STAGES) WIE NECESSARY THEY ARE: I) First cycle, "Start of Flowout" ID Second cycle "Stop of  Flowout".<br>
I. START OF FLOW OUT:     This will be  achieved generally by a part<br>
of  a pipe in which two valves are established. If we get the<br>
blocking of    pipe at    some    point      in    the      pipe     	<br>
C<br><br>
by using any of ttese values this will te achieved. Then one valve is so pressed that no wgter will bs allowed through it . Consequently the remaining valÂ¬ve will be opened easily. And the "start of flow out" of Water will te allowed. That is the inter changing of niddle and Bottom valves. Thia Is shown In Fig.a and 9 m drawing sheet N0.4 . The arrow marks indiÂ¬cate   the water direction,<br>
II.STCP   OF  FLOW  OUT;       This will  fce   achieved  by     any of     these  valves.     When we   shut any of   the  valve. Then  that valve will be  closed.   There  is  no flowing of water  to out side     finally.  I   concluded  that  these two cycles fbllcwed by each other to activate   t^e machine.<br>
To get   ttfi   openinj   of   tlrÂ»3   val'^'e  which  is  closed in  order   to stop   tire   water  flow   out.   We     required   morÂ« .power kt the   same   morrent.     This leads  to sorre  disadvÂ¬antages.   To avoid this we  arrange  the  bottom valve   as a com.bination of   sub valves.   Then tVese   two effects  of two cycles will   be   achieved    according  to tY&amp;   opening or closing  of   sab-valves  one   by one  directly  in order to activate   the   receprocating  Tirbine.  In such system there  will  be   no middle   v^lve.<br>
There is relation between the dianetre, length of bore , and diameter of big main pipe. (Draft pipe ) If we ma^ie any variations in these three, or any of three. The out put will be varied at constant hight of Water source. TbÂ£ power that will bs delivered by the out put wheel will fce varied according to the potÂ¬ential energy. TTB valves used plane,or triangular or semlsphere   shaped solids in their    constructions.<br>

Thejre  are  two methods to Start and Stop  this Reciprocating ibrblne.<br>
FIRST METHOD TO START TOE  TURHENEt     At first we  separate  the bottom Valve.  Which Is clasped at a point,  Inorder that bottom valve  become* s free,   and Next,we  must connpress the middle valve with the edge of piston valve by rotating the massy wheel.When the bottom valve.Closes the Inlet of bore.   Then the bottom waive will be opened and the  TVirblne will be  started usually.   Then the  masses of wheels are  at downwards.   At same  time water Is flowing to the outside of  Thb. This  Is shown In Pig 7 of Drawing sheet No.4<br>
FIRST METHOD TO STOP   THE  TORHTNE:    We  must  shut  the  Inlet of  bore with the bottom valve,   and clasp It to some other point,Inorder that it dows not move  to downwards.     This Is shown In the ^Ig.T of Drawing sheet No.4  ,<br>
SECOND METHOD TO START THE TORBINEt     At first we  must  set  the valves of  1\irtalne  are    as shown In Pig.lOof Drawing sheet No.   5 by rotating the wheel,   le.,   bottom valve la opened and  the middle val&gt;Â« is not conpressed by edge of piston valve  and  the piston valve Is closed and next we remove  the cap  (lid) (cover) from the outlet of  draft pipe and set aside  as shown in Pig.ll of ^ra!&gt;ti.ng sheet No,5.     Then the  lUrblnB will be  started usually.     Generally the masses  are  just above  to down wards as shown In Pigl2    of drawing sheet No.5  .     At same time water Is flowing to outside of  "Hib.<br>
SECOND  NETHOD  TO  STOP   THE   TORHtNEt     if  we   shut   the  outlet Of<br>
draft pipe with the cap (or)   lid  (or)  cover.   The   turbine will<br>
be  stopped usually. This Is shown In ^'Ig.No.lO of Drjjwlng sheet No.Â»/.<br>
