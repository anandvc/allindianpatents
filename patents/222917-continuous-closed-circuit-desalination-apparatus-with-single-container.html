				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for the desalination of<br>
Sea Water (SW) or Brackish Water (BW) by Reverse Osmosis (SWRO or<br>
BWRO) in closed circuit.<br>
Desalination by reverse osmosis (RO) occurs when salt water solution is<br>
compressed against semi-permeable membranes at pressure higher than its<br>
osmotic pressure. The "Plug Flow Desalination" (henceforth "PLD") method<br>
involves the passing of pressurized feed flow through pressure vessels<br>
(modules) with semi-permeable membrane elements, wherein it separates<br>
continuously into none pressurized flow of desalted permeate and pressurized<br>
flow of brine effluent. The SWRO or BWRO recovery of PFD relates to the<br>
feed concentration, the applied pressure, the number of elements per module,<br>
the staging of modules and the specifications of elements. Pressurized feed<br>
flow in PFD is always greater than the permeate flow and 50% recovery<br>
implies that pressurized feed flow is twice that of permeate. PFD may also<br>
involve partial recycling to enhance recovery and this method is characterized<br>
by the continuous flow of its three components; the pressurized feed, the<br>
pressurized brine effluent and the permeate.<br>
In contrast with PFD, Closed Circuit Desalination (henceforth "CCD") is a<br>
batch process performed with solution recycling under hydrostatic pressue<br>
with same rate of pressurized feed supply and permeate delivary. Intermal<br>
flow in CCD is created by circulation means in order to minimize<br>
concetrration polarization effects. The CCD technology was first reported<br><br>
in the late eighties by Szuz et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,983,301 and by Bartt in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,814,086 and the making of such a such batch process<br>
continuous was proposed by means of ".. two relatively large capacity<br>
tanks .." that are alternately engaged in the closed circuit, thereby, allow<br>
the recharge of the closed circuit with fresh feed without the stopping<br>
desalination. Earlier patents from the late seveties, such as DE 26 22 461<br>
A (1977) and JP 54 128985 A (1979), describe PFD with partial re-<br>
circulation that is fundamentally different form CCD inspite of the<br>
similarity of certain fitures (e,g,. circuit with membrane module(s), lines<br>
for feed and for recycling, ciruclation means, pressurizing means, means<br>
for effluent discharge, monitoring means, etc.). The distinction between<br>
CCD and PLD is clear and unmistakable, since only the former process<br>
involves the replacement of brine effluent with fresh feed at atmospheric<br>
pressure, thereby avoiding the need for energy recovery from the<br>
pressurized brine effluent that is essentail in the latter process.<br>
In comparison with PLD, the CCD requires much smaller means for<br>
pressurization fresh feed and proceeds with lower specific energy without<br>
need of energy recovery. The CCD technology according to said patents is<br>
a batch process made to operate continuously by means of consectuive<br>
sequential steps involving two relatively large capacity containers and this<br>
approach has not been considered economically favored for the design of<br>
desalination plants.<br>
The present invention describes both apparatus and methods whereby Closed<br>
Circuit Desalination (CCD) may be performed continuously by means of a<br>
relatively small single container, thereby, the making of this technology<br>
economical feasible for diverse applications involving both sea water and/or<br>
brackish water desalination.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention proposes an apparatus and methods for desalination<br>
of sea water, or brackish water, on the basis of reverse osmosis using a<br>
closed circuit, wherein feed is. recycled through parallel desalination<br>
modules by a circulation driving means and counter pressure is created by a<br>
pressurizing means which also replaces the released permeate by fresh feed<br>
supply. The volume of feed pressurized into the closed circuit during the<br>
desalination sequence is monitored by means of a flow meter, this volume<br>
at any given instance being equal to the volume of released permeate. The<br>
circulation driving means is made to operate at low inlet-outlet pressure<br>
difference under elements specifications of maximum element recovery and<br>
flow ratio of concentrate to permeate, and the pressurizing means may be<br>
made to deliver variable pressure as function of the recovery as monitored<br>
by the flow of permeate and/or the flow of pressurized feed and/or the<br>
changing concentrations during course of the desalination sequence.<br>
Counter pressure of desalination at module inlets is maintained at a fixed<br>
level above osmotic pressure during the entire desalination sequence.<br>
The variable pressure closed circuit desalination apparatus may be made to<br>
operate continuously by adding a single container which is actuated<br>
intermittently to recharge the closed-circuit with fresh feed and at the same<br>
time remove the consumed brine effluent from the system. While the<br>
pressurized container with fresh feed is engaged with the closed circuit, the<br>
desalination process is continued and the modules may be operated non-<br>
stop at their specified permeate output.<br>
The inventive method and apparatus of variable pressure closed circuit<br>
desalination by reverse osmosis may be implemented by a simple apparatus<br><br>
made of readily available commercial components and it allows low cost<br>
desalination at highly significant savings in components including power<br>
components and energy.<br>
The inventive apparatus may be operated at constant pressure such that the<br>
costs of the pressurizing means are considerably reduced while the energy<br>
expenditure is still kept lower than in the methods of the prior art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a solution to the problem of extensive<br>
energy consumption and high costs involved in reverse osmosis<br>
desalination processes of the prior art by proposing an apparatus and<br>
method for consecutive sequential desalination of sea water, or brackish<br>
water, by reverse osmosis comprised of a closed-circuit, wherein feed is<br>
recycled through parallel desalination modules by a circulation pump, a<br>
single container is used intermittently to recharge the closed-circuit with<br>
fresh feed and remove the brine effluent, and counter pressure is created by<br>
a pressurizing pump which also replaces the released permeate by fresh<br>
feed supply.<br>
In accordance with the inventive method, the volume of the feed<br>
pressurized into the closed circuit during the desalination sequence is<br>
monitored by means of a flow meter, this volume at any given instance<br>
being equal to the volume of released permeate. The volume of released<br>
permeate being directly proportional to the raise in osmotic pressure, the<br>
monitoring of this volume provides the means to control the counter<br>
pressure of desalination at modules' inlets such that it is kept at a fixed<br>
level above osmotic pressure throughout the desalination sequence.<br>
In accordance with the novel apparatus and method of the invention,<br>
modules may comprise one, two, three or more membrane elements each<br>
and this number dictates the module recovery per single recycling pass,<br>
whereas, the ultimate recovery of the entire sequential process depends<br>
only on the total number of recycling passes performed in the closed-circuit<br>
under variable pressure conditions of fixed net driving pressure. In sharp<br><br>
contrast, single pass desalination of. sea water by the CFD method of the<br>
prior art requires modules of seven or eight elements and the overall<br>
recovery remains low (40%-42%) if the maximum element recovery<br>
specified by the manufacturers' of membrane elements under test<br>
conditions (e.g. 10%) is not exceeded. In simple terms, the novel invention<br>
allows the reaching of any desired desalination recovery without exceeding<br>
the specified maximum element recovery under test conditions, whereas,<br>
the recovery limits of the CFD method of prior art under such conditions<br>
are in the range of 40%-42% .<br>
The inventive method allow the attainment of high average recovery per<br>
element without exceeding the specifications of maximum element<br>
recovery under test conditions and this is not possible by the CFD method<br>
of prior art.<br>
The recovery of modules with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 elements with<br>
specified maximum element recovery of 10% under test conditions is<br>
10.0(10)%, 18.1(9.05)%, 24.5(8.1)%, 29.7(7.4)%, 33.9(6.8)%, 37.3(6.2)%,<br>
40.0(5.7)%, 42.1(5.3)%, respectively, with average recovery value per<br>
element given in parenthesis. The much higher average element recovery<br>
expected by the inventive method as compared with the CFD method of<br>
prior art implies significant savings of membrane elements by the new<br>
method.<br>
The average flow per element under the specified test conditions of the<br>
manufacturers is directly related to the average recovery per element, and<br>
therefore, higher element recovery also implies faster permeate flow. Salt<br>
passage of semi-permeable membrane element is inversely related to the<br>
average element flow, and therefore, the inventive method is expected to<br><br>
afford permeates of lower salt content and higher quality as compared with<br>
the CFD method of prior art. In light of the aforementioned, the salt<br>
passage by the inventive method is expected to decrease as function of<br>
decreased number of elements per module. Accordingly, the better quality<br>
permeates by the inventive method are received with modules of fewer<br>
elements.<br>
It is another advantage of the invention that by gradually increasing the<br>
counter pressure of desalination such that it is kept at a fixed value above<br>
the osmotic pressure of concentrate at modules' inlets, the mean counter<br>
pressure of the entire process is significantly lower than the constant<br>
counter pressure required by the CFD method of the prior art, and this<br>
implies significant savings in power and energy by the inventive method.<br>
In accordance with another advantage of the invention, the flow in the<br>
closed circuit created by the circulation means can be controlled and<br>
adjusted to minimize the concentration polarization effect by disturbing the<br>
concentrate thin layer on the membrane surfaces.<br>
The inventive method circumvents completely the need for expensive<br>
energy recovery means which are the most tedious and troublesome<br>
components in CFD apparatus of the prior art.<br>
The novel apparatus and method of the invention eliminate the need for the<br>
application of vast over-power as well as the need for excess power<br>
recovery practice characteristic of the existing CFD methods.<br>
In accordance with another advantage of the invention, the footprint of<br>
desalination units is sharply reduced in comparison with existing CFD<br><br>
methods due to the significant savings in power components, membrane<br>
elements and energy as well as by eliminating completely the need for<br>
energy recovery from the brine effluent.<br>
Fig. IA is a schematic drawing of an apparatus that is one of the preferred<br>
embodiments of the inventive apparatus. As seen in Fig. IA, the inventive<br>
desalination apparatus comprises a pressurized sea water circuit which<br>
feeds in parallel a plurality of desalination modules M1-M6 with said circuit<br>
and modules constitute a Closed-Circuit (henceforth "CC") wherein<br>
desalination takes place. It will be understood that the number of modules<br>
is not limited to the six modules shown in Fig. IA and it may be smaller or<br>
larger according to different design requirements. It is one of the<br>
advantages of the inventive apparatus that it may be operated with the<br>
commercial modules known from the prior art. It is also envisaged that<br>
different kinds of modules may be designed to be applied in the inventive<br>
apparatus, or the apparatus may be provided with commercial modules not<br>
known at the time of this invention. The modules to be applied in the<br>
inventive apparatus will generally comprise one or more elements within<br>
housing. The concentrate from modules outlets is recycled back to the<br>
modules inlets through the CC by means of a circulation pump CP that is<br>
operated at low inlet-outlet pressure difference. The desired hydrostatic<br>
pressure in the CC, including the modules M1-M6, is created by means of<br>
a pressurizing pump PP that feeds sea water into the apparatus through line<br>
L replacing the volume of released permeate, designated by an arrow A, by<br>
fresh sea water supply designated by arrow E1. The volume of the sea water<br>
supply is being monitored continuously by means of a flow meter FM. The<br>
pressurizing pump PP is made to actuate either at constant pressure or at<br>
progressively increased pressure as function of desalination recovery<br>
manifested by monitored volume on the flow meter FM. The apparatus also<br><br>
comprises lines L1 for conducting supply in the CC from the circulation<br>
pump CP to the inlets of modules M1-M6 via secondary lines L1.1, L1.2,<br>
L1.3, L1.4, L1.5, L1.6. The apparatus further comprises line L2 for the recycling<br>
of partially desalinated sea water from the modules outlets via secondary<br>
collecting lines L2.1, L2.2, L2.3, L2.4, L2.5, L2.6 driven by circulation pump CP.<br>
The entire CC comprises of lines L1, L2 and the modules M1-M6 with their<br>
inlets and outlets secondary lines. It will be understood that the design of<br>
the desalination circuit and lines as shown in Fig. IA is schematic and<br>
simplified and is not to be regarded as limiting the invention. In practice the<br>
desalination apparatus may comprise many additional lines, branches,<br>
valves and other installations or devices as necessary according to specific<br>
requirements while still remaining within the scope of the invention and the<br>
claims.<br>
Referring again to Fig. IA, the desalination apparatus further comprises a<br>
line AA for the collection of released permeate (desalted solution) from the<br>
modules outlets A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6.<br>
Referring again to Fig. IA, the desalination apparatus further comprises a<br>
system for Feed Recharge (henceforth "FR"), whereby brine is replaced<br>
with fresh feed in the CC at the end of each desalination sequence of<br>
desired recovery. The FR system comprises the lines E2, B1, B2, and C, the<br>
two-way valves V1-V5, the container CN, and the recharge pump RP. Fig.<br>
IA describes desalination in progress in the CC system, while recharge in<br>
progress takes place in the FR system. The CC and FR systems in Fig. IA<br>
are disengaged since valve V1 is opened and valves V2 and V3 are closed.<br>
During the recharge operation of the FR system, fresh feed is admitted<br>
through valve V4 (opened) and line B2 to the top of the container CN, and at<br>
the same time brine is removed from the bottom of the container CN to the<br><br>
outside (arrow C) through line B1, valve V5 (opened) and line C, by<br>
means of the recharge pump RP which is actuated at low pressure (~1.0<br>
bar) under nearly laminar flow conditions.<br>
Fig. IB describes the valves positions after the container recharge operation<br>
completed and the FR system is being pressurized and made ready to<br>
provide fresh feed supply to the CC system. The valves of the FR system at<br>
this stage are closed, except for valve V3 though which pressurization is<br>
taking place.<br>
Fig. IC describes the valves positions when the FR system provides fresh<br>
feed supply to the CC system and removes the brine effluent. If the CC and<br>
FR systems are of the same intrinsic volume, one full FR container with<br>
fresh feed is sufficient to complete the recharge of the entire CC system.<br>
During the feed recharge operation, the desalination process is continued<br>
non-stop.<br>
The direction of flow in the inventive apparatus is indicated by light grey<br>
arrows. Non-pressurized lines are indicated by dashed lines, lines which are<br>
pressurized part of the time are indicated by dotted lines and lines of the CC<br>
system which are continuously pressurized are indicated by continuous<br>
lines. It will be understood that the lines, valves and pumps shown in Fig.<br>
I(A-C) are but one way of implementing the invention and many other<br>
installations may be envisaged for diverse embodiments of the invention.<br>
It will be understood that the inventive apparatus and method can be<br>
applied as non-modular or as modular systems, in the former case the<br>
pressurizing means comprises a variable pressure pump(s) for feed provided<br>
at atmospheric pressure, and in the latter case the pressurizing means<br><br>
comprises a variable pressure booster pump(s) for feed already provided<br>
under pressure. The non-modular inventive apparatus intended primarily<br>
for autonomous desalination units, whereas the modular apparatus intended<br>
as building blocks for large desalination plants wherein pressurized feed is<br>
supplied to the units centrally from a main line and the variable pressure<br>
booster pump of each unit in the system used for pressure adjustments as<br>
required by the unit.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention may be realized using a large<br>
number of modules such that the modules are arranged in multiple parallel<br>
lines, each line supplied in parallel with solution for desalination from the<br>
main line of the apparatus and each module within each line also supplied<br>
in parallel. In such an apparatus separate circulation means may be used for<br>
each of the said lines respectively or a single circulation means may be used<br>
for all of the said lines.<br>
The pressurizing means or the circulation means or both may be<br>
implemented by two or more pumps installed in parallel or any other design<br>
according to specific requirements.<br>
In accordance with the inventive apparatus, the container need not be a<br>
vessel of large volume and it may be implemented as a pipe or duct section.<br>
The desalination method of the invention involves the following steps,<br>
described herein below with reference to the apparatus of Fig. I(A-C): (I)<br>
the entire apparatus is filled with fresh sea water or brackish water supply;<br>
(II) the pressurizing pump(s) is set to deliver constant pressurized feed flow<br>
under the appropriate variable pressure conditions; (III) the circulation<br>
pump CP is actuated at low inlet-outlet pressure difference such that flow<br><br>
rate of concentrate to permeate is consistent with specifications of modules;<br>
(IV) the sequential RO desalination in the CC system is performed by the<br>
recycling of the process concentrate and its mixing with fresh pressurized<br>
feed supplied to the CC during the course of the desalination sequence; (V)<br>
concomitant with the completion of the desired sequential recovery in the<br>
CC system, flow circulation is diverted intermittently through the FR<br>
system until the CC system is recharged with a fresh feed supply and the<br>
brine effluent removed; (VI) concomitant with the completion of the fresh<br>
feed recharge of the CC system, the CC and FR systems are disengaged,<br>
the former starts a new desalination sequence and the latter undergoes fresh<br>
feed recharge combined with brine discharge followed by pressurization,<br>
thus, made ready the next CC recharge operation.<br>
It will be understood that in order to maintain constant permeate flow from<br>
the modules of the inventive apparatus, the variable pressure in the CC<br>
system should account for a constant, or nearly constant, net driving<br>
pressure (henceforth "NDP"). It will be further understood that said NDP<br>
in the context of the inventive method is the pressure difference between<br>
the applied pressure, also referred to as counter pressure, and the osmotic<br>
pressure of the recycled solution at the inlet to modules during the<br>
continuous desalination process.<br>
It will be obvious to those versed in the art that the desalination method of<br>
the invention may be operated in desalination apparatus of different designs<br>
as explained above in respect of the inventive apparatus as long as such an<br>
apparatus comprises a closed circuit of conducting lines with a container,<br>
one or more desalination modules of one or more membrane elements each<br>
supplied in parallel, a pressurizing means, a circulating means, a flow<br>
monitoring means and a conductance monitoring means.<br><br>
Furthermore, it will be obvious to those versed in the art that single<br>
inventive apparatus of said modular design of any preferred production<br>
capacity can be joined together and made into a desalination plant of an<br>
expanded production capacity in which the pressurized feed is centrally<br>
generated and supplied to the individual units of the plant through<br>
extensions from a single high pressure delivery line of fresh feed.<br>
Example-I<br>
The application of the new technology is exemplified in TABLE-I by sea<br>
water desalination under progressively increased pressure conditions of<br>
constant net driving pressure using an apparatus of the schematic design<br>
shown in Fig. I(A-C) with six modules of three elements each and a single<br>
container of 394 liter which is of the same intrinsic volume of the closed<br>
circuit. The elements in this example are of a commercial type, or similar,<br>
and their presumed specifications under test conditions are listed in<br>
TABLE-I. The specified maximum element recovery of 10% that of the<br>
head elements in the modules is not exceeded during the entire sequential,<br>
or consecutive sequential, desalination operation described by the example.<br>
The specified modules recovery of 24.5% cited in TABLE-I is that of a<br>
three-element module under test conditions with maximum element<br>
recovery being 10%. Permeate flow in the example under review is<br>
presumed constant since the desalination process is performed under<br>
constant, or nearly constant, net driving pressure (NDP) of ~30.4 bar which<br>
is the specified NDP under test the conditions of the elements. Under the<br>
conditions of constant NDP applied in the example, the pressurized feed<br>
flow per module (37.4 lit/min) and the recycled concentrate flow per<br>
module (115.3 lit/min) remain constant with the former being identical to<br>
the permeate flow per module (37.4 lit/min). The constant flow parameters<br><br>
for the exemplified apparatus of six modules is six time that cited in<br>
TABLE-I per single module.<br>
The presumed efficiency factors (f) of pumps in this example are fpp=0.88,<br>
fcp=0.85 and fRP=0.80; wherein, fpp;fcp and fRP are the efficiency factors of<br>
the pressuring pump (PP), the circulation pump (CP) and the feed recharge<br>
pump (RP), respectively. In this example the presumed variable pressure<br>
delivery of the PP is in the range of 54.9-70.8 bar (mean pressure, 62.8<br>
bar), RP operates at 0.5 bar and the CP operates at an inlet-outlet pressure<br>
difference(Ap) of 1.0 Bar (~15 psi).<br>
The example under review in TABLE-I contains constant flow data per<br>
module as expected of a system which operates under the cited variable<br>
applied pressure (AP) of constant net driving pressure (NDP). The<br>
constant flow is derived from the permeate flow equation (1) and the<br>

The combining of sequential desalination steps into a continuous process of<br>
consecutive sequences for continuous desalination is done by means of a<br>
controlled system which actuates valves and other components in<br>
compliance with on-line monitored information of concentrations and/or<br>
pressures and/or flow of permeate and/or of pressurized feed. The follow-<br>
up of the conductivity of the solution in the closed circuit is one of several<br><br>
means by which such a desalination process can be effectively managed and<br>
controlled.<br>
According to the date in TABLE-I, the apparatus in this example operates<br>
with a sequential period (T) for 50% recovery of 107 seconds (1.75<br>
minutes) of which some 34 seconds are consumed for closed circuit<br>
recharge with fresh feed through a container of 395 liters, the same volume<br>
as that of the closed circuit itself. Therefore, the time difference of 73<br>
seconds (107-34) between successive actuations of the recharge container is<br>
the maximum period available for its recharge and pressurization.<br>
In summary, the preferred embodiment of the inventive method and<br>
apparatus is exemplified (Example-I) by a units for 323 m3/day capacity of<br>
desalted sea water on the basis of 100% availability and 50% recovery<br>
which requires a mean specific energy of 2.18 kWh/m3 under variable<br>
counter pressure (54.9-70.8 bar) conditions or 2.38 kWwh/m3 under<br>
constant applied pressure (70.8 bar) conditions.<br>
