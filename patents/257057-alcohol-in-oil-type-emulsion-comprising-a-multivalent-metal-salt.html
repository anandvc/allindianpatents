The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of emulsion type science, in particular with respect of providing stable alcohol-in-oil type emulsions comprising substances that provide a high level of electrolytes. Typically, the high level of electrolytes may be obtained by adding a metal salt to the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
During production of products, it may be necessary to mix two or more types of liquid which as such are not mixable. To overcome this, liquids may be mixed in an emulsion where a temporary or permanent dispersion of an oil or another hydrophobic material in an aqueous solution, or vice versa, forming an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oii emulsion. Generally, such oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions are capable of providing a stable solution.<br>
However, for some products, the use of such oil in water emulsions or water-in-o emulsions may- cause- various disadvantages as precipication and sedimentation of components of the mixtures and non-homogenous distribution of the constituents of the mixture during storage.<br>
EP 0 386 018 describes an efficient antiperspirant composition wherein a metal salt is combined with a buffer salt suspended in alcohol. HoWever, this composition has the drawback of developing sedimentation of the suspended particles during storage. This sedimentation causes an inhomogeneous dosing of the Antiperspirant and leakage of the composition from the roller-ball of the device.<br>
Thus, it is suggested to provide a different system, such as an alcohol-in-oil type emulsion This alcohoi-in-oil type emulsion is not an emulsion as sUch because of the lack of water. However, it is a mixture of two types of liquid which as such are not mixable, namely a lower alcohol and an oil. However, it is established knowledge in the art that such kind of alcohol-in-oil type emulsions containing high levels of particles, e.g. metal ions, are considered as being unstable.<br>
To improve the chemical stability of suspended particles that will release hydrochloric acid in presence of water, there is a need for a water-free composition, such as a alcohol-in-o type emulsion. At the same time the water-free emulsion must be stable even in presence<br>
2<br><br>
of a high level of electrolytes to provides a homogeneous distribution of the suspended particles.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
With the aim of providing an improved emulsion type mixture that has improved stability during storage, avoiding precipitation and sedimentation, of components and providing an homogenous composition, a first aspect of the present invention provides an alcohol-in-oii type emulsion comprising i) a metal salt, ii) a lower-alcohol phase, and iii) an oil phase.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention a method for producing an alchohol-in-oil type emulsion is provided. The method comprises the steps of:<br>
(i) providing an oil phase,<br>
(ii) providing a suspension of a metal salt in an alcohol phase,<br>
(iii) mixing the oil phase provided in step (i) with the suspension provided in step (ii) to obtain a mixture,<br>
(iv) providing a further suspension of a metal salt in an alcohol phase,<br>
(v) mixing the mixture obtained in step (iii) with the further suspension of an metal salt in an alcohol phase provided in step iv) to obtain the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention an antiperspirant is provided. The antiperspirant comprises: (i) an aluminium salt, (ii) a lower alcohol phase, and (iii) an oil phase.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventor of the present invention has found that an alcohol-in-oil type emulsion according to the present invention provide a stable homogenous emulsion type even when the emulsion type contains a high level of ions, such as a metal salt and where the precipitation and sedimentation of e.g. metal ions is limited or avoided.<br>
3<br><br>
In the present context the term "precipitation" relates to formation of particles in the mixture, such as in the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion. Precipitation can occur when an insoluble substance is formed in the solution due to a reaction or by agglomeration of suspended particles. In most situations, the solid forms ("falls") out of the solute phase or the suspension, and sinks to the bottom of the mixture or the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion,<br>
In the present context the term "sedimentation" relates to the deposition of a particulate matter as a layer of solid particles on the bed or bottom of a body of a liquid, such as an alcohol-in-oil type emulsion. Sedimentation is the deposition by settling of a suspended material.<br>
An alcohol-in-oil emulsion<br>
In a first aspect of the present invention an alcohol-in-oil type emulsion is provided. The emulsion type comprises a metal salt, a lower-alcohol phase, and an oil phase. In this aspect the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion has a viscosity sufficient to maintain the metal salt suspended homogeneously during storage. The alcohol-in-oil type emulsion has the clear advantage of being essentially free of water resulting in a good chemical stability of the suspended metal salt. It is to be understood that the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion of the present invention is stable despite the high ion level.<br>
A method of preparing the alcohol-in-oil emulsion<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for producing an alcoholf<br>
in-oil type emulsion, wherein said method comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) providing an oil phase,<br>
(ii) providing a suspension of a metal salt in an alcohol phase,<br>
(iii) mixing the oil phase provided in step (i) with the suspension provided in step (ii) to obtain a mixture,<br>
(iv) providing a further suspension of a metal salt in an alcohol phase, and .<br>
(v) mixing the mixture obtained in step (iii) with the further suspension of an metal salt in an alcohol phase provided in step iv) to obtain the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion.<br>
4<br><br>
Though an alcohol-in-oil type emulsion is known in the art, it is widely acknowledged that high level of ions is not compatible with a stable alcohol-in-oil type emulsion. To provide a stable emulsion according to the present invention, there are several actions that may be noticed. According to the invention in the first step i) an oil phase is provided. In the second step ii) a suspension of a metal salt in an alcohol phase is provided. To obtain.a better and more homogenous distribution of the metal salt, it may be preferred that in the third step iii) where the oil phase is added to the suspension, the oil phase provided in step i) is added gently to the suspension of a metal salt provided in step ii) to obtain the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the metal comprised in the suspension of a metal salt provided in step ii) is typically an aluminium salt, such as a salt comprising an active antiperspirant salt. However, in other embodiments other metal salts providing a high ion level can be used if such a composition will benefit from being formulated as a stable alcohol-in-oil type emulsion. In such an embodiment, the mixture obtained in step iii) may be suitable for the given propose of the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion provided. such as being used as an antiperspirant. In such a case steps iv) and v) are optional steps and may be excluded from the method.<br>
In yet an embodiment of the present invention it may be advantages to add the oil phase to the metal salt mixed with the alcohol phase by 2 or more sequences, such as in 3 or mora sequences, e.g. in 4 or more sequences, such as in 5 or more sequences.<br>
Step v) of the process, may be performed by adding the further suspension provided in step iv) to the mixture obtained in step iii) to obtain the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion. Again, to obtain a better and more homogenous distribution of the metal salt, the further suspension provided in step iv) may be added gently to the mixture obtained in step iii).<br>
In a typical embodiment, the metal salt present in the suspension provided in step ii) and/or step iv) comprises a di- or tri- or tetra-valence metal-ion.<br>
In one embodiment, the metal salt in step ii) may be a metal salt of an organic acid. Such metal salt of an organic acid has the function of a buffer salt, which reacts with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, that may be a reaction product of the active metal salt. By means of this buffer salt an adverse effect, such as skin irritation, due to e.g. free hydrochloric acid is limited or even avoided.<br>
5<br><br>
In one embodiment the metal salt provided in step ii) may be a metal salt of an organic acid, such as aluminium lactate or a hydrate thereof. In this embodiment, the metal salt of an organic acid functions as a buffer salt.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the metal salt comprised in the further suspension of a metal salt in step iv) may be a metal salt of an inorganic acid. Typically, a metal salt of an inorganic acid has the function of an active metal salt. Such an active metal salt may in some embodiments be a metal salt providing an antiperspirant effect. Contacted by water, such a metal salt typically reacts with the water or moisture giving a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, as a reaction product.<br>
In one embodiment the metal salt in step ii) may be a metal salt of an inorganic acid. Such a metal salt of an inorganic acid has the function of being an active metal salt. Such an active metal salt is in some embodiments a metal salt providing an antiperspirant effect. Contacted by water such a metal salt typically reacts with the water or moisture giving a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, as a reaction product.<br>
In one embodiment, the metal salt is an aluminium chloride.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the metal salt comprised in the further suspension of a metal salt in step iv) is a metal salt of an organic acid, which reacts with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, that may be a reaction product of the active metal salt and e.g. water. By means of this buffer salt an adverse effect, such as skin irritation, due to e.g. free hydrochloric acid is limited or even avoided.<br>
In one embodiment the metal salt provided in step ii) the metal salt of an organic acid may be aluminium lactate or a hydrate thereof. In this embodiment, the metal salt of an organic acid functions as a buffer salt.<br>
In the embodiments where an acid, such as hydrochloric acid, is liberated resulting from the metal salt being contacted with water, the product according to the invention will have a characteristically low pH value when measuring the pH as follows. When measuring the pH on a mixture of 50(w/w)% of the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion, such as is obtained in step v) mixed with 50(w/w)% water, the pH is in the range of 0-5, such as in the range of 0-4, such as in the range of 0-3. When measuring the pH on a mixture of 50%(w/w) alcohol-in-oil type emulsion and 50%(w/w) water, the temperature of the mixture must be 20°C.<br>
6<br><br>
In the embodiments where an acid, such as hydrochloric acid is liberated by contact with water, it is characteristic for the product that the conductivity will be high due to the high level of ions. When measuring the conductivity on a mixture of 50(w/w)% of the alcohol in-oil type emulsion obtained in step v) and 50(w/w)% water, the conductivity is in the: range of 4-18 ms/cm, such as in the range of 5-16 ms/cm, such as in the range of 6-15 ms/cm, such as in the range of 7-14 ms/cm, such as 8-13 ms/cm, such as 9-12 ms/cm, such as in the range of 10-11 ms/cm. When measuring the conductivity on a mixture ot 50%(w/w) alcohol-in-oil type emulsion and 50%(w/w) water, the temperature of the mixture must be 20°C.<br>
The metal salt/The buffering component<br>
The metal salt comprised in the invention may be any metal salt providing a high level cf electrolytes in the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion. The metal salt may either be a salt of an organic and/or inorganic acid.<br>
In an embodiment, the metal salt comprises a combination of a metal salt of an organic acid and a metal salt of an inorganic acid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the metal salt is a combination of a metal salt having antiperspirant effect and a metal salt having a buffer effect. Typically, the metal salt having antiperspirant effect is an inorganic salt, where the metal salt having buffer effect is a metal salt of an organic acid.<br>
From the prior art, it is well known that AlCl3 is an effective antiperspirant salt and most of the commercially available antiperspirant compositions contain AlCl3 as the active component, e.g. dissolved in a suitable solvent. AlCl3 exerts its antiperspirant activity by reacting with water from the sweat to form aluminium hydroxychloride which acts as an astringent and thereby reduces the sweat output of the sweat glands. However, the disadvantage of using AlCl3 is that the reaction with water from the sweat to form aluminium hydroxychforide also generates hydrochloric acid as a side product which may cause local skin irritation because of the high acidity. Additionally, clothes in contact with the application area may also be damaged, and both of these adverse effects can be ascribed to the formation of hydrochloric acid on the skin and in the sweat ducts.<br>
The problems that appear from the high acidity of hydrochloric acid may be overcome e.g. by allowing the hydrochloric acid to react with a salt of the weaker acid, such as an<br>
7<br><br>
organic acid, with no pK value below 2.5, the weaker acid then, according to well known principles, being liberated from the salt by the stronger hydrochloric acid to give the free weaker acid and a chloride instead. Such a salt of a weaker acid is referred to as a buffer salt. The fact that an aluminium salt of the weaker acid may be used, has the advantage of resulting in the formation of a further amount of aluminium hydroxychloride, thereby resulting in a further antiperspirant effect. On the otner hand, the acidity is lowered considerably since the free acid present in the skin environment is now not solely hydrochloric acid but is in effect the weaker acid with no pK value below 2.5, the aluminium salt of which forms part of the composition of the invention. Since a weaker acid is less irritant to the skin, the net result is a reducfion in or elimination of the skin irritation.<br>
In order to prevent premature reaction of the aluminium chloride with water from the sweat, it is preferred that the composition is anhydrous. This is in particular obtained by using a carrier system, which is anhydrous or has no available water so that aluminium chloride does not undergo hydrolysis to aluminium hydrochloride and hydrochloric acid.<br>
The terms "no available water" and "substantially free from water" are used<br>
interchangeably and are intended to mean that the water present in the formulation is not<br>
able to solvate the aluminium salts, either because the water is present in too small an<br>
amount, or because the water is bound too strongly by another component in the<br>
composition. Thus, A1C13 will for example not undergo hydrolysis in 95% ethanol or in<br>
liquid	sorbitol,<br>
A preferred composition is one in which the weaker acid/acids has/have no pK value<br>
below 3, in particular not below 3.5, especially not below 4. The use of an acid or acids<br>
with such properties will ensure a significant reduction in the level of skin irritation. The<br>
acid	or	acids	is/are	preferably	physiologically	acceptable.<br>
Since a number of organic acids have various biological properties, it is preferred that an acid in the composition of the invention has a biological effect such as astringent, antibacterial, antimicrobial, antiseptic, antifungal, antiparasitic, antiperspirant, deodorant antiinflammatory, emollient, anesthetic, hemostatic, antipruritic properties, etc. By using an aluminium salt of one or more acids with one or more such properties, the properties of the composition of the invention may be amplified as Well as expanded in its spectrum. Thus, if the acid used in the composition of the invention has antifungal properties, the composition of the invention could be useful in therapy or profylactic treatment of Tinea<br><br>
pedis, also known as "athlete's foot". This affliction is extremely common and is associated with sweating, and the maceration of the skin by the sweat facilitates the infection and makes it more difficult to treat. Even in persons with "normal" sweating it is desirable to reduce       the       amount       of      perspiration       when       treating       the       fungi.<br>
Potentially useful acids with no pK value in aqueous solutions below 2.5 are the following:<br>
acetic, propionic, citric, acetylsalicylic, benzoic, salicylic, ascorbic, nicotinic, tartaric,<br>
phtalic, lactic, fatty acids (oleic, linoleic, undecenoic, octanoic, palmitic, ricinoleic, stearic,<br>
etc.), acetylcretosinic, succinic, carbarmoylphenoxyacetic, diacetylsalicylic, anthranilic,,<br>
mefenamic, gentisic, tolfenamic, acetotartaric, agaric, formic, subacetic, ellagic, fumaric,<br>
malic, morrhuic, oxalic, para-amino-benzoic, gallic, cinnamic, isoascorbic, sorbic;<br>
aminocaproic. aminom ethyl benzoic, tranxenamic acid, naturally occuring amino acids<br>
such as glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, serine or threonine, etc, and<br>
derivatives thereof as well as tar acids, phenol, thymol and cation exchange resins. The<br>
term "derivatives thereof is intended to mean that the various acids listed may also be<br>
further substituted with various groups, the presence of derivative substituents conferring<br>
one or more of the biological properties mentioned above to the acid in question. The<br>
substituent groups forming the derivatives may be selected from a broad range such as<br>
phenyl, phenylamino, naphtyl, benzoyl, indenyl or various heterocyclic groups such as<br>
indolyl, benzoxazolyl, pyridyl, benzindolyl etc., the substituent groups optionally<br>
themselves being substituted with substituents such as halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, optionally<br>
alkylsubstituted	amino	etc.<br>
Thus, various derivatives of propionic, acetic, phenylacetic, salicylic, and anthranilic acid etc. are able to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and can therefore function as local antiinflammatory agents. Examples of propionic acid derivatives are naproxen, ibuprofer, benoxaprofen, and bucloxic acid; examples of phenylacetic and acetic acid derivatives are indomethacin, bufexamac, diclofenac, sulindac, and aclofenac; examples of salicylic acid derivatives are aspirin, acetaminosalol, diflunisal, dipyrocetyl, and fendosal; examples of anthranilic acid are etofenamic acid, flufenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, and tolfenamic acid;      and      an      example      of      butyric      acid      derivatives      is      fenbufen.<br>
Among the acids listed above, several are known to have some of the biological properties mentioned above. Thus, salicylic, acetotartaric, agaric, formic, subacetic and ellagic acid are known to have astringent properties, and undecenoic, octanoic, propionic, tolfenamic, isoascorbic     and     sorbic     acid     are     known     to     have     antifungal     properties.<br>
9<br><br>
Preferred examples of acids having no pK value below 2.5 are acetyl salicylic, salicylic, benzoic, propionic, octanoic, undecanoic, sorbic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, stearic acid, citric acid, phthalic acid, tartaric acid, or a naturally occurring amino acid.<br>
In order to ensure satisfactory neutralization of any hydrochloric acid liberated as a result<br>
of the reaction between AlCl3 and water from the sweat, the molar ratio between the<br>
aluminium salt or salts of the acid or acids and AICI3 is preferably in the range from 1:1 to<br>
1:2,	in	particular	about	2:3.<br>
In order to provide a composition effective for antiperspirant purposes, it is preferred that the AlCb and the aluminium salt of the acid is present in the composition of the invention in amounts corresponding to a total aluminium content of up to 3 gram atoms of Al per kilogram of composition, in particular from 1.0 to 2.0 gram atoms Al per kg composition.<br>
The carrier or carriers in which the AlCI3 and the aluminium salt of the weaker acid is dissolved and/or dispersed may be any of the carriers traditionally used for incorporation into antiperspirant compositions. Thus, the carrier may be a liquid, a gel, a semisolid or a powder. Liquid carriers may be alcohols, glycols, fats, fatty acid esters, fatty acids, paraffins, liquid polymers (such as silicone oil), for example ethyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, glycerine, propylene glycol, etc. as well as mixtures thereof. A gel carrier may be an alcohol or another of the above mentioned liquid carriers such as ethyl alcohoj containing a cellulose derivative such as hydroxypropyl cellulose. A semisolid carrier may be a polyglycol, a paraffin (for example vaseline), fats, or any of the above mentioned liquids containing a polymer such as liquid paraffin containing dissolved polyethylene (marketed under the trade name Plastibase). A solid carrier may be talc, starch, kaolin etc.<br>
The composition of the invention may be prepared by methods commonly used within the art for the preparation of antiperspirant compositions, the preparation ordinarily comprising simply mixing together the constituents. Thus, a liquid composition may be prepared by dissolving or dispersing the aluminium chloride and the weaker acid/acids in the liquid carrier; optionally, the aluminium chloride and the weaker acid/acids may be dissolved or dispersed separately in two portions of the carrier or in two different carrier components followed by mixing of the mixtures. A gel composition may be obtained by starting from a liquid composition and adding gelling agent such as the above mentioned cellulose derivative.<br>

The lower alcohol<br>
The alcohol-in-oil type emulsion typically comprises a lower-alcohol present in a discontinuous phase, where the oil phase typically is present in a continuous phase. In a preferred embodiment the alcohol present in the discontinuous alcohol phase is a lower alcohol such as an alcohol having 1-10 carbonatoms.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term 'discontinuous phase" relates to the alcohol phase because the alcohol phase is being suspended in the oil phase in parts. Thus, these parts of the alcohol phase are not connected.<br>
12<br><br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "continuous phase" relates to the oil phase because this phase is substantially one coherent phase surrounding the alcohol phase.<br>
In an embodiment, the alcohol phase comprises a lower-alcohol phase, said lower alcohol<br>
comprised herein may be a mono- or di-alcohol.	<br>
In an embodiment, the alcohol phase comprises a lower-alcohol phase, said lower alcohol comprised herein may be an alcohol having an unbranched carbon chain.<br>
In an embodiment, the alcohol phase comprises a lower-alcohol phase, said lower alcohol comprised herein may be selected from the group consisting of ethanol, l-propanol, 2-propanol, ethyleneglycol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol or any combination thereof.<br>

In an embodiment, the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion comprises an oil phase in an amount so that the content of the oil phase relative to the total amount of the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion is in the range of 0-20%(w/w), such as in the range of 3-15%(w/w), e.g. in the range of 5-10%(w/w), such as 1-5 %(w/w), e.g. in the range of l-20%(w/w), such as in the range of l-15%(w/w), e.g. in the range of 2-10%(w/w), such as 3-5 %(w/w).<br>
The product<br>
The product of the invention is characteristic in that the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion of the product processes a high emulsion stability providing a high homogeneity of the metal salt in the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion. This high level of stability is demonstrated when<br>
13<br><br>
storing the product and subsequently to the storage, measuring the phase separation of the type emulsion.<br>
Thus, the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion according to the present invention has a phase separation of at the most 10 mm, such as at the most 5 mm, e.g. at the most 3 mm, such as at the most I mm, e.g. at the most 0.7 mm, such as at the most 0.5 mm, e.g. at the most 0.4 mm, such as at the most 0.3 mm, e.g. at the most 0.2 mm, such as at the most 0.1 mm, where the phase separation is resulting after storage for VA month and measured on an amount of 0.5 1 alcohol-in-oil type emulsion contained in a vessel having an inner diameter of 6.8 mm.<br>
Alternatively, when storing the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion for a longer storage period, the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion has a phase separation of at the most 5 mm, e.g. at the most 1 mm, where the phase separation is resulting after storage for 1/2 month, such as i month, e.g.1 1/2 month, such as 2 month, e.g. 3 month, such as 4 month, e.g. 5 month, such as 6 month, e.g. 12 month, and measured on an amount of 0.5 1 alcohol-in-oil type emulsion contained in a vessel having an inner diameter of 6.8 mm. A main reason for this phase separation may be caused by evaporation of the alcohol phase during day-time and subsequent condensation of the alcohol phase during the night-time. Thus, significant improvements of the phase separation may be obtained if the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion is stored under conditions with no, or limited influence of temperature and light.<br>
When referring to a "homogeneous" alcohol-in-oil type emulsion or a "homogeneous" mixture or "homogeneous" in any context herein, there is "homogeneous" to be understood as the phases comprised in the composition are uniformly distributed and/or that the particles are uniformly distributed throughout the composition. As used herein the term "homogeneous" is further to be understood as that the suspended particles do not sediment and that the phases of the emulsion do not separate substantially.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion, the antiperspirant or the product obtained in steps in) or v) of the present invention may be substantially free of water.<br>
Further, it may be characteristic for the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion to have a density in the range of 1.02-0.82 g/ml, such as in the range of 0,87-0.97 g/ml, such as in the range of 0,90-0.95 g/ml.<br>
14<br><br>
As used herein, the term "density" is to be understood as the weight of the alcohol in-oil type emulsion measured as g pr ml. The measurement is carried out at 20 °C.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion, the antiperspirant or the product obtained in steps iii) or v) has a pH-value in the range of 0-5, such as in the range of 0-4, such as in the range of 0-3, when measuring on a mixture of 50% (w/w) alcohol-in-oil type emulsion (or the antiperspirant or the product obtained in steps iii) or v)) and 50% (w/w) water at 20°C.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion, true antiperspirant or the product obtained in steps iii) or v) has a conductivity in the range of 4-18 ms/cm, such as in the range of 5-16 ms/cm, such as in the range of 6-15 ms/cm, such as in the range of 7-14 ms/cm, such as 8-13 ms/cm, such as 9-12 ms/cm, such as in the range of 10-11 ms/cm, when measuring on a mixture of 50%(w/w) alcohol-in-oil type emulsion (or the antiperspirant or the product obtained in steps iii) or v)) and 50%(w/w) water at 20°C.<br>

A stable alcohol-in-oil type emulsion may be achieved, when the ratio between the alcohol phase and the oil phase are within well-defined limits. A too high level of alcohol may result in a reversion of the phases from the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion to an oil-in-alcohol type emulsion. This is because increased levels of alcohol in the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion may pull the emulsifier out of the interface between the alcohol phase and the oil phase and result in the formation of flocculates and the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion may collapse. Therefore the alcohol-in-oil type emulsion may comprise an alcohol in an amount within the range of 45-95%(w/w), such as in the range of 55-85%(w/w), such as in the range of 65-75%(w/w).<br>

The alcohol-in-oil type emulsion may comprise a further emollient. In an embodiment, the emollient comprises a cetyl ester, such as cetyl palmitate in an amount less than 5%(w/w), such as less than 4%(w/w), such as less than 3%(w/w), such as less than 2%(w/w), such as less than l%(w/w).<br>
The alcohol-in-oil type emulsion may comprise a viscosity controlling agent. In an embodiment, the viscosity controlling agent comprises a wax, such as microcrystalline wax in an amount less than 5%(w/w), such as less than 4%(w/w), such as less than 3%(w/w), such as less than 2%(w/w), such as less than l%(w/w).<br>
