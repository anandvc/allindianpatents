				<td>DEVICE FOR REGULATION OF TYPE II COLLAGEN GENE EXPRESSION<br>
AND THE USE THEREOF<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Applications<br>
The present patent application is a continuation-in-part patent application of U.S.<br>
Patent Application Serial No.297,454, which is the U.S. national phase patent application of<br>
PCT/USO1/05991, filed February 23,2001, which, in turn, claims the benefit of the filing<br>
date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/184,491, filed February 23,2000.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a method of regulating type U collagen gene<br>
expression in cartilage cells via the application of specific and selective fields generated by<br>
specific and selective electric and electromagnetic signals for the treatment of injured or<br>
diseased articular cartilage, as well as a device for generating such signals.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The bioelectrical interactions and activity believed to be present in a variety of<br>
biological tissues and cells are one of the least understood of the physiological processes.<br>
However, there has recently been much research into these interactions and activity<br>
regarding the growth and repair of certain tissues and cells. In particular, there has been<br>
much research into stimulation by electric and electromagnetic fields and its effect on the<br>
growth and repair of bone and cartilage. Researchers believe that such research might be<br>
useful in the development of new treatments for a variety of medical problems.<br><br>
Osteoarthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease, is characterized by<br>
degeneration of articular cartilage as well as proliferation and remodeling of subchondral<br>
bone. The usual symptoms are stiffness, limitation of motion, and pain. Osteoarthritis is the<br>
most common form of arthritis, and prevalence rates increase markedly with age. It has been<br>
shown that elderly patients with self-reported osteoarthritis visit doctors twice as frequently<br>
as their unaffected peers. Such patients also experience more days of restricted activity and<br>
bed confinement compared to others in their age group. In one study, the majority of<br>
symptomatic patients became significantly disabled during an 8-year follow-up period.<br>
Massardo et al., Ann Rheum Dis.48: 893-7 (1989).<br>
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remain the primary treatment<br>
modality for osteoarthritis. It is unknown whether the efficacy of NSAIDs is dependent<br>
upon their analgesic or anti-inflammatory properties or the slowing of degenerative<br>
processes in the cartilage. There is also a concern that NSAIDs may be deleterious to<br>
patients. For example, NSAIDs have well known toxic effects in the stomach,<br>
gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney. However, aspirin inhibits proteoglycan synthesis and<br>
normal cartilaginous repair processes in animals. One study in humans suggested that<br>
indomethacin might accelerate breakdown of hip cartilage. All adverse effects appear more<br>
commonly in the elderly - the very population most susceptible to osteoarthritis.<br>
In the disease commonly known as osteoporosis, bone demineralizes and becomes<br>
abnormally rarefied. Bone comprises an organic component of cells and matrix as well as an<br>
inorganic or mineral component. The cells and matrix comprise a framework of collagenous<br>
fibers that is impregnated with the mineral component of calcium phosphate (85%) and<br>
calcium carbonate (10%) that imparts rigidity to the bone. While osteoporosis is generally<br>
thought as afflicting the elderly, certain types of osteoporosis may affect persons of all ages<br>
whose bones are not subject to functional stress. In such cases, patients may experience a<br>
significant loss of cortical and cancellous bone during prolonged periods of immobilization.<br>
Elderly patients are known to experience bone loss due to disuse when immobilized after<br>
fracture of a bone, which may ultimately lead to a secondary fracture in an already<br>
osteoporotic skeleton. Diminished bone density may lead to vertebrae collapse, fractures of<br><br>
hips, lower arms, wrists, ankles as well as incapacitating pains. Alternative nonsurgical<br>
therapies for such diseases are needed.<br>
Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) and capacitive coupling (CC) have been used<br>
widely to treat nonhealing fractures and related problems in bone healing since approval by<br>
the Food and Drug Administration in 1979. The original basis for the trial of this form of<br>
therapy was the observation that physical stress on bone causes the appearance of tiny<br>
electric currents that, along with mechanical strain, were thought to be the mechanisms<br>
underlying transduction of the physical stresses into a signal that promotes bone formation.<br>
Along with direct electric field stimulation that was successful in the treatment of nonunion,<br>
noninvasive technologies using PEMF and capacitive coupling (where the electrodes are<br>
placed on the skin in the treatment zone) were also found to be effective. Pulsed<br>
electromagnetic fields generate small induced currents (Faraday currents) in the highly<br>
conductive extracellular fluid, while capacitive coupling directly causes currents in the<br>
tissues; both PEMFs and CC thereby mimic endogeneous electrical currents.<br>
The endogeneous electrical currents, originally thought to be due to phenomena<br>
occurring at the surface of crystals in the bone, have been shown to be due primarily to<br>
movement of fluid containing electrolytes in channels of the bone containing organic<br>
constituents with fixed negative charges, generating what are called "streaming potentials."<br>
Studies of electrical phenomena in cartilage have demonstrated a mechanical-electrical<br>
transduction mechanism that resembles those described in bone, appearing when cartilage is<br>
mechanically compressed, causing movement of fluid and electrolytes over the surface of<br>
fixed negative charges in the proteoglycans and collagen in the cartilage matrix. These<br>
streaming potentials apparently serve a purpose in cartilage similar to that in bone, and,<br>
along with mechanical strain, lead to signal transduction that is capable of stimulating<br>
chondrocyte synthesis of matrix components.<br>
The main application of direct current, capacitive coupling, and PEMFs has been in<br>
orthopedics in healing of nonunion bone fractures (Brighton et al., J. Bone and Joint<br>
Surgery, 63: 2-13, 1981; Brighton and Pollack, J. Bone and Joint Surgery, 67: 577-585,<br>
1985; Bassett et al., Crit. Rev. Biomed. Eng., 17:451-529 (1989); Bassett et al., JAMA 247:<br>
623-8 (1982). Clinical responses have been reported in avascular necrosis of hips in adults<br><br>
and Legg-Perthes"s disease in children. Bassett et al., Clin Orthop 246:172-6 (1989); Aaron<br>
et al.,Clin Orthop 249: 209-18 (1989); Harrison et al, J Pediatr Orthop 4: 579-84 (1984). It<br>
has also been shown that PEMFs (Mooney, Spine, 15: 708-712, 1990) and capacitive<br>
coupling (Goodwin, Brighton et al., Spine, 24: 1349-1356, 1999) can significantly increase<br>
the success rate of lumbar fusions. There are also reports of augmentation of peripheral<br>
nerve regeneration and function and promotion of angiogenesis. Bassett, Bioassays 6: 36-42<br>
(1987). Patients with persistent rotator cuff tendinitis refractory to steroid injection and other<br>
conventional measures, showed significant benefit compared with placebo treated patients.<br>
Binder et al., Lancet 695-8 (1984). Finally, Brighton et al. have shown in rats the ability of<br>
an appropriate capacitive coupling electric field to both prevent and reverse vertebral<br>
osteoporosis in the lumbar spine (Brighton et al., J. Orthop. Res. 6: 676-684, 1988; Brighton<br>
et al., J. Bone and Joint Surgery, 71: 228-236, 1989).<br>
More recently, research in this area has focused on the effects stimulation has on<br>
tissues and cells. For example, it has been conjectured that direct currents do not penetrate<br>
cellular membranes and that control is achieved via extracellular matrix differentiation.<br>
Grodzinsky, Crit. Rev. Biomed. Engng 9:133 (1983). In contrast to direct currents, it has<br>
been reported that PEMFs can penetrate cell membranes and either stimulate them or<br>
directly affect intracellular organelles. An examination of the effect of PEMFs on<br>
extracellular matrices and in vivo endochondral ossification found increased synthesis of<br>
cartilage molecules and maturation of bone trabeculae. Aaron et al., J. Bone Miner. Res. 4:<br>
227-233 (1989). More recently, Lorich, Brighton et al. reported (Clin Orthop and Related<br>
Research 350: 246-256, 1998) that signal transduction of a capacitively coupled electric<br>
signal is via voltage gated calcium channels, leading to an increase in cytosolic calcium with<br>
a subsequent increase in activated (cytoskeletal) calmodulin.<br>
Much research has been directed at studying tissue culture in order to understand the<br>
mechanisms of response. In one study, it was found that electric fields increased [3H]-<br>
thymidine incorporation into the DNA of chondrocytes, supporting the notion that Na and<br>
Ca2+ fluxes generated by electrical stimulation trigger DNA synthesis. Rodan et al., Science<br>
199: 690-692 (1978). Studies have found changes in the second messenger, cAMP, and<br>
cytoskeletal rearrangements due to electrical perturbations. Ryaby et al., Trans. BRAGS 6:<br><br>
(1986); Jones et al., Trans. BRAGS 6: 51 (1986); Brighton and Townsend, J. Orthop. Res. 6:<br>
552-558, 1988. Other studies have found effects on glycosaminoglycan, sulphation,<br>
hyaluronic acid, lysozyme activity and polypeptide sequences. Norton et al., J. Orthop. Res.<br>
6: 685-689 (1988); Goodman et al., Proc. Natn. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 3928-3932 (1988).<br>
It was reported in 1996 by the present inventor that a cyclic biaxial 0.17%<br>
mechanical strain produces a significant increase in TGF-?1, mRNA in cultured MC3T3-E1<br>
bone cells. Brighton et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 229: 449-453 (1996). Several<br>
significant studies followed in 1997. In one study it was reported that the same cyclic<br>
biaxial 0.17% mechanical strain produced a significant increase in PDGF-A mRNA in<br>
similar bone cells. Brighton et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 43: 339-346 (1997). It<br>
was also reported that a 60 kHz capacitively coupled electric field of 20 mV/cm produced a<br>
significant increase in TGF-?1, in similar bone cells. Brighton et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res.<br>
Commun. 237:225-229 (1997). However, the effect such a field would have on other genes<br>
has not been reported in the literature.<br>
In the above-referenced parent patent application, entitled "Regulation of Genes Via<br>
Application of Specific and Selective Electrical and Electromagnetic Signals," methods were<br>
disclosed for determining the specific and selective electrical and electromagnetic signals for<br>
use in creating specific and selective fields for regulating target genes of diseased or injured<br>
tissues. The present invention builds upon the technique described therein by describing the<br>
method of regulating one targeted gene expression, namely, type II collagen gene<br>
expression, through application of a specific and selective field generated by a specific and<br>
selective electrical and electromagnetic signal, for the treatment of cartilage disease<br>
(arthritis), cartilage injury, and cartilage defects.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to regulating the type II collagen gene expression in<br>
cartilage cells via the application of specific and selective fields generated by specific and<br>
selective electric and/or electromagnetic signals. By performing dose-response curves on the<br>
electric field duration, amplitude, frequency, and duty cycle, the optimal signal for up-<br>
regulating type II collagen mRNA in articular cartilage chondrocytes was discovered. The<br><br>
optimal signal generated a capacitively coupled electric field with an amplitude of 20<br>
mV/cm, a duration of 30 minutes, a duty cycle of 8.3% (1 minute ON, 11 minutes OFF, 30<br>
cycles), a frequency of 60 kHz, and a sine wave configuration. In particular, the present<br>
invention relates to up-regulating type II collagen gene expression in cartilage cells via the<br>
application of fields generated by such signals.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, methods are provided to specifically and<br>
selectively up-regulate the gene expression of type II collagen mRNA with capacitively<br>
coupled electric fields, electromagnetic fields, or combined fields. Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, cartilage injury, cartilage defects, and the like are treated with a capacitively<br>
coupled electric field of about 20 mV/cm with an electric field duration of about 30 minutes,<br>
a frequency of about 60 kHz, a duty cycle of about 8.3%, and a sine wave configuration that<br>
causes the expression of type II collagen mRNA to be up-regulated. In accordance with the<br>
method of the invention, a "specific and selective" signal is a signal that has predetermined<br>
characteristics of amplitude, duration, duty-cycle, frequency, and waveform that up-regulates<br>
the expression of the type II collagen gene (specificity). This allows one to choose different<br>
signals to up-regulate type II collagen gene expressions in order to achieve a given biological<br>
or therapeutic response (selectivity). The invention further relates to devices employing the<br>
methods described herein to generate specific and selective signals that create specific and<br>
selective fields to up-regulate the expression of the type II collagen gene.<br>
In related aspects, the present invention relates to methods and devices for the<br>
treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, cartilage injury, and cartilage defects. The<br>
method of the invention also includes the methodology for determining the "specific and<br>
selective" signal for the type II collagen gene by methodically varying the duration of a<br>
starting signal known to increase or suspected to increase cellular production of type II<br>
collagen. After selecting the optimal duration, the amplitude of the signal is varied for the<br>
optimal duration of time as determined by the gene expression of type II collagen. The duty<br>
cycle, frequency, and waveform are varied methodically while keeping the other signal<br>
characteristics constant. This process is repeated until the optimal signal is determined that<br>
produces the greatest increase in the expression of type II collagen.<br><br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that type II collagen gene expression is<br>
functionally complementary or synergistic to aggrecan gene expression in cartilage cells<br>
exposed to various electrical and electromagnetic signals. Specific and selective signals for<br>
regulating aggrecan gene expression are described in copending U.S. Patent Application<br>
Serial No. , also to the present inventor. These and other aspects of the present invention<br>
will be elucidated in the following detailed description of the invention.<br>
 Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawines<br>
 The present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, of which:<br>
 Figure 1 is a graphic representation of type II collagen mRNA expression when<br>
articular cartilage chondrocytes are exposed to a 20 mV/cm capacitively coupled electric<br>
field for various time durations. As indicated, the optimum type II collagen mRNA<br>
production occurred with a signal of 30 minutes duration.<br>
Figure 2 is a graphic representation of type II collagen mRNA expression when<br>
 articular cartilage chondrocytes are exposed to a 20 mV/cm capacitively coupled field for 30<br>
minutes. The amount of type II collagen mRNA produced after various response times - as<br>
compared to that of controls (no electricity) - is shown. As also shown, the optimum type II<br>
collagen mRNA production occurred 5.5 hours after the electrical stimulation ceased.<br>
Figure 3 is a graphic representation of type II collagen mRNA expression when<br>
) articular cartilage chondrocytes are exposed to various amplitudes of a capacitively coupled<br>
electric field for 30 minutes" duration and harvested 5.5 hours after the electrical stimulation<br>
ceased. As indicated, the optimum production of type II collagen mRNA occurred with a<br>
signal producing an electric field amplitude of 20 mV/cm.<br>
Figure 4 is a graphic representation of Northern blot analysis of type II collagen<br>
5 expression (white bar) and type II collagen mRNA expression (shaded bar) when articular<br>
cartilage chondrocytes are exposed to 20 mV/cm capacitively coupled electric field for 30<br>
minutes" duration and harvested 5.5 hours after cessation of the electrical signal. As<br>
indicated, the Northern blot analysis of the type II collagen mRNA is 3.5-fold greater than<br><br>
that of unstimulated controls, and the amount of type II collagen mRNA as determined by<br>
RT-PCR is 6.5-fold greater than that of unstimulated controls.<br>
Figure 5 is a graphic representation of type II collagen mRNA expression when<br>
articular cartilage chondrocytes are exposed to a capacitively coupled electric field of<br>
various duty cycles with a duration of 30 minutes ON time at 20 mV/cm electric field<br>
amplitude and harvested 5.5 hours after cessation of the electrical signal. As indicated, the<br>
optimum duty cycle was found to be 8.3% (1 minute ON, 11 minutes OFF, 30 cycles).<br>
Figure 6 is a graphic representation of type II collagen mRNA expression when<br>
articular cartilage chondrocytes are exposed to a capacitively coupled electric field of<br>
various frequencies of 30 minutes" duration (ON time) at 20 mV/cm electric field amplitude<br>
with a 8.3% duty cycle (1 minute ON, 11 minutes OFF, 30 cycles) and harvested 5.5 hours<br>
after cessation of the electrical signal. As indicated, the optimal frequency was found to be<br>
60 kHz.<br>
Figure 7 is a graphic representation of articular cartilage chondrocytes grown for 7<br>
days in culture and then exposed to a capacitively coupled electric field of 20 mV/cm, 50%<br>
duty cycle (1 minute ON, 1 minute OFF, 30 cycles), at a frequency of 60 kHz, and having a<br>
sine wave configuration. The chondrocytes were exposed to this field for 1 hour per day for<br>
7 days. Control chondrocytes were grown under the same conditions but were not exposed<br>
to any electric stimulation. No interleukin-1? (IL-1P), a cytokine that stimulates articular<br>
cartilage degradation, was present in the media of these cultures. As indicated,<br>
hydroxyproline, an amino acid that is a characteristic constituent of collagen, was increased<br>
1.7-fold when chondrocytes were exposed to the electric field as compared to control<br>
chondrocytes that were not exposed to the electric field.<br>
Figure 8 is a graphic representation of articular cartilage chondrocytes grown for 7<br>
days in culture and then exposed to a capacitively coupled electric field of 20 mV/cm, 50%<br>
duty cycle (1 minute ON, 1 minute OFF, 30 cycles), at a frequency of 60 kHz, and having a<br>
sine wave configuration. Interleukin-l? (10 ng/ml) was added to the media at day 7. The<br>
chondrocytes were then exposed to this field for 1 hour per day for 7 days. Control<br>
chondrocytes were grown under the same conditions with interleukin in the media but were<br>
not exposed to any electric stimulation. As indicated, hydroxyproline still showed a 1.4-fold<br><br>
increase when exposed to the electric field, despite the presence of interleukin in the media<br>
of the cultures, as compared to control cultures that were not exposed to the electric field.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates a device 10 in accordance with the present invention that is used<br>
to treat a patient with osteoarthritis of the knee.<br>
Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
The invention will be described in detail below with reference to Figures 1-9. Those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that the description given herein with respect to those<br>
figures is for exemplary purposes only and is not intended in any way to limit the scope of<br>
the invention. All questions regarding the scope of the invention may be resolved by<br>
referring to the appended claims.<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery that the expression of certain genes<br>
can be regulated by the application of specific and selective fields generated by specific and<br>
selective electric and/or electromagnetic signals. In other words, it has been discovered by<br>
the present inventor that there is a specific and selective electric and/or electromagnetic<br>
signal that generates a specific and selective field for regulating each gene in bone, cartilage<br>
and other tissue cells and that these fields are capable of specifically and selectively<br>
regulating the genes in such cells. In particular, gene expression governing the growth,<br>
maintenance, repair, and degeneration or deterioration of tissues or cells can be regulated in<br>
accordance with the invention via the application of specific and selective fields generated<br>
by specific and selective electric and /or electromagnetic signals so as to produce a salutary<br>
clinical effect. Such discoveries are useful in the development of treatment methods that<br>
target certain medical conditions including bone fractures and defects, osteoarthritis,<br>
osteoporosis, cancer and other diseases, as well as for developing devices employing such<br>
methods.<br>
In particular, the present invention demonstrates that the expression of type II<br>
collagen may be significantly up-regulated to increase the production of collagen in articular<br>
cartilage. Type II collagen, along with aggrecan, are the main constituents of articular<br>
cartilage that are compromised and/or degraded early in the course of arthritis. The present<br>
invention clearly shows that the optimal electric field described herein can significantly up-<br><br>
regulate type II collagen mRNA and, hence, increase type II collagen synthesis, even in the<br>
presence of IL-1?. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that an appropriate electric<br>
field, as described herein with capacitive coupling but equally effective with any and all<br>
field application techniques, can be used to treat arthritis (both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid<br>
arthritis), cartilage injury, and cartilage defects.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "signal" is used to refer to a variety of signals including<br>
mechanical signals, ultrasound signals, electromagnetic signals and electric signals output by<br>
a device. It is to be understood that the term "field" as used herein refers to an electrical field<br>
within targeted tissue, whether it is a combined field or a pulsed electromagnetic field or<br>
generated by direct current, capacitive coupling or inductive coupling.<br>
The phrase "remote" is used to mean acting, acted on or controlled from a distance.<br>
"Remote" regulation refers to controlling the expression of a gene from a distance. To<br>
provide "remotely" refers to providing from a distance. For example, providing a specific<br>
and selective signal from a remote source can refer to providing the signal from a source at a<br>
distance to tissue or a cell or from a source outside of or external to the body.<br>
The phrase "specific and selective" signal means a signal that produces a specific and<br>
selective electric field that has predetermined characteristics of amplitude, duration, duty-<br>
cycle, frequency, and waveform that up-regulate or down-regulate a targeted gene or<br>
targeted functionally complementary genes (specificity). This allows one to choose different<br>
"specific and selective" signals to up-regulate or down-regulate various gene expressions in<br>
order to achieve a given biological or therapeutic response (selectivity).<br>
The term "regulate" means to control gene expression. Regulate is understood to<br>
include both up-regulate and down-regulate. Up-regulate means to increase expression of a<br>
gene, while down-regulate means to inhibit or prevent expression of a gene.<br>
"Functionally complementary" refers to two or more genes whose expressions are<br>
complementary or synergistic in a given cell or tissue.<br>
"Tissue" refers to an aggregate of cells together with their extracellular substances<br>
that form one of the structural materials of a patient. As used herein, the term "tissue" is<br>
intended to include muscle and organ tissue as well as bone or cartilage tissue. Also, the<br>
 term "tissue" as used herein may also refer to an individual cell.<br><br>
"Patient" refers to an animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human.<br>
The present invention provides treatment methods and devices that target certain<br>
tissues, cells or diseases. In particular, the gene expression associated with the repair<br>
process in injured or diseased tissues or cells can be regulated by the application of specific<br>
and selective fields generated by electric signals that are specific and selective for the genes<br>
to be regulated in the target tissues or ceils. Gene expression can be up-regulated or down-<br>
regulated by the application of signals that are specific and selective for each gene or each<br>
set of complementary genes so as to produce a beneficial clinical effect. For example, a<br>
particular specific and selective signal may create a specific and selective electric field that<br>
up-regulates a certain desirable gene expression, while the same or another particular<br>
specific and selective signal may create a specific and selective electric field that down-<br>
regulates a certain undesirable gene expression. A certain gene may be up-regulated by a<br>
specific and selective field generated by one particular specific and selective signal and<br>
down-regulated by a specific and selective field generated by another specific and selective<br>
signal. Those skilled in the art will understand that certain diseased or injured tissues can be<br>
targeted for treatment by regulating those genes governing the growth, maintenance, repair,<br>
and degeneration or deterioration of the tissues.<br>
The methods and devices of the present invention are based on identifying those<br>
signals that generate fields that are specific and selective for the gene expression associated<br>
with certain targeted diseased or injured tissue. For example, electricity in its various forms<br>
(e.g., capacitive coupling, inductive coupling, combined fields) can specifically and<br>
selectively regulate gene expression in targeted tissues or cells in a patient"s body by varying<br>
the frequency, amplitude, waveform or duty cycle of the applied specific and selective field<br>
for each selected gene. The duration of time exposed to electricity can also influence the<br>
capability of electricity to specifically and selectivity regulate gene expression in targeted<br>
tissues or cells in a patient"s body. Specific and selective signals may generate specific and<br>
selective electric fields for application to each gene systematically until the proper<br>
combination of frequency, amplitude, waveform, duty cycle, and duration is found that<br>
provides the desired effect on gene expression.<br><br>
It is to be understood that a variety of diseased or injured tissues ordisease states can<br>
be targeted for treatment because the specificity and selectivity of an electric field for a<br>
certain gene expression can be influenced by several factors. In particular, an electrical field<br>
of appropriate frequency, amplitude, waveform and/or duty cycle can be specific and<br>
selective for the expression of certain genes and thus provide for targeted treatments.<br>
Temporal factors (e.g., duration of time exposed to the electrical field) can also influence the<br>
specificity and selectivity of an electric field for a particular gene expression. The regulation<br>
of gene expression may be more effective (or made possible) via the application of a specific<br>
and selective electrical field for a particular duration of time. Therefore, those skilled in the<br>
art will understand that the present invention provides for varying the frequency, amplitude,<br>
waveform, duty cycle and/or duration of application of an electric field until the electric field<br>
is found to be specific and selective for certain gene expressions in order to provide for<br>
treatments targeting a variety of diseased or injured tissue or diseases.<br>
Thus, the present invention can provide for targeted treatments because it is possible<br>
to regulate expression of certain genes associated with a particular diseased or injured tissue<br>
via the application of specific and selective fields generated by specific and selective signals<br>
of appropriate frequency, amplitude, waveform and/or duty cycle for an appropriate duration<br>
of time. The specificity and selectivity of a signal generating a specific and selective<br>
electrical field may thus be influenced so as to regulate the expression of certain genes in<br>
order to target certain diseased or injured tissue or disease states for treatment. In particular,<br>
the present invention provides for the targeted treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, cartilage injury, and cartilage defects.<br>
The present invention also provides a device that includes a source of at least one<br>
signal specific and selective for type II collagen gene expression. The devices of the present<br>
invention can provide for the production of such signals for application to cartilage cells by<br>
at least one electrode adapted to apply the specific and selective field generated by the<br>
specific and selective signal. In particular, the optimal field described herein can be applied<br>
to any joint via appropriate surface electrodes, two or more, in pairs or in strips, incorporated<br>
in garments, braces, wraps or casts, and delivered by means of capacitive coupling, inductive<br>
coupling (electromagnetic fields), or combined fields.<br><br>
The device of the present invention is capable of applying a specific and selective<br>
field generated by specific and selective signals directly to diseased or injured tissue and/or<br>
to the skin of a patient. The device of the present invention may also provide for the remote<br>
application of specific and selective fields (e.g., application of a field at a distance from<br>
diseased or injured tissue), although it will be appreciated that capacitively coupled devices<br>
must touch the subject"s skin. The device of the present invention may include means for<br>
attaching the electrodes to the body of a patient in the vicinity of injured or diseased tissue.<br>
For example, self-adherent conductive electrodes may be attached to the skin of the patient<br>
on both sides of a knee joint afflicted with osteoarthritis as shown in Figure 9. As also<br>
shown in Figure 9, the device 10 of the present invention may include self-adherent<br>
electrodes 12 for attaching the device 10 to the body of a patient. For example, the device<br>
10 of the present invention may include electrodes 12 attached to a power unit 14 that has a<br>
VELCRO® patch 16 on the reverse side such that the power unit 14 can be attached to a<br>
VELCRO® strap (not shown) fitted around the calf, thigh or waist of the patient.<br>
The device 10 of the present invention can be employed in a variety of ways. The<br>
device 10 may be portable or may be temporarily or permanently attached to a patient"s<br>
body. The device 10 of the present invention is preferably non-invasive. For example, the<br>
device 10 of the present invention may be applied to the skin of a patient by application of<br>
electrodes adapted for contact with the skin of a patient for the application of specific and<br>
selective fields generated by the predetermined specific and selective signals. Such signals<br>
may also be applied via coils in which time varying currents flow, thus producing specific<br>
and selective electromagnetic fields that penetrate the tissue. The device 10 of the present<br>
invention may also be capable of implantation in a patient, including implantation under the<br>
skin of a patient.<br>
The example below will illustrate that the method of the present invention may<br>
provide for cartilage growth and repair. Cartilage growth and repair can be stimulated via<br>
signals specific and selective for the regulation of expression of type II collagen in cartilage<br>
cells so as to stimulate articular cartilage repair in osteoarthritis patients. In particular, the<br>
methods of the present invention can provide for the up-regulation of type II collagen genes<br>
that repair cartilage. A variety of cartilage cells can be targeted by the methods of the present<br><br>
invention including articular chondrocytes and including articular cartilage, hyaline<br>
cartilage, and growth plate cartilage.<br>
The example below further illustrates that the method of the present invention<br>
provides for the regulation of gene expression in articular chondrocytes. For example, in the<br>
example below, fetal articular chondrocytes have been exposed to a capacitively coupled 60<br>
kHz electrical field of 20 mV/cm for 0.5,2.0,6.0 and 24.0 hours. A statistically significant<br>
incorporation of 35SO4/ug DNA (indicating significant proteoglycan synthesis) was found<br>
after only 0.5 hours of stimulation. An identical experiment was repeated and the levels of<br>
type II collagen mRNA, the messenger for the major cartilage proteoglycan, monitored.<br>
After only 0.5 hours of electrical stimulation there was a significant increase in type II<br>
collagen mRNA. Accordingly, temporal factors may influence the specificity and selectivity<br>
of a signal that generates specific and selective electric fields for regulating gene expression<br>
in articular chondrocytes.<br>
Those skilled in the art will understand that a variety of other cartilage diseases and<br>
injuries may be targeted for treatment via the method of the present invention.<br>
Those skilled in the art will further understand that the devices of the present<br>
invention can be provided in a variety of forms including a capacitively coupled power unit<br>
with programmed multiple switchable specific and selective signals for application to one<br>
pair or to multiple pairs of electrodes, electromagnetic coils attached to a power unit with<br>
switchable multiple specific and selective signals, and an ultrasound stimulator with a power<br>
supply for generating specific and selective signals. Generally speaking, device preference<br>
is based on patient acceptance and patient compliance. The smallest and most portable unit<br>
available in the art at the present time is a capacitive coupling unit; however, patients with<br>
extremely sensitive skin may prefer to use inductive coupling units. On the other hand,<br>
ultrasound units require the most patient cooperation but may be desirable for use by certain<br>
patients.<br>
Example<br>
The invention is demonstrated in the following example, which is for purposes of<br>
illustration and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Chondrocyte cultures were prepared from fetal bovine articular cartilage.<br>
Chondrocytes (5 x 105 cells/cm2) were plated onto specially modified Cooper dishes. The<br>
cells were grown to seven days with the medium changed just prior to beginning of the<br>
experimental condition. The experimental cell cultures throughout these studies were<br>
subjected to a capacitively coupled 60 kHz sine wave signal electric field with an output of<br>
44.81 volts peak to peak. This produced a calculated-field strength in the culture medium in<br>
the dishes of 20 mV/cm with a current density of 300 µA/cm2. Control cell culture dishes<br>
were identical to that of the stimulated dishes except that the electrodes were not connected<br>
to a function generator.<br>
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol, according to the manufacturer"s instructions,<br>
and reversed transcription using Superscript II reverse transcriptase was performed.<br>
Oligonucleotide primers to be used in the competitive PCR technique were selected from<br>
published cDNA sequences. Quantitative analysis of PCR products was performed using<br>
ScionImage software.<br>
The optimal signal for the desired gene regulation was found systematically as<br>
follows. An electrical signal known to increase (or even just suspected to increase) cellular<br>
production of a given protein is taken as the starting signal for determining the specific<br>
signal for generating the specific and selective field for the gene expression (mRNA) of that<br>
protein. A dose-response curve is first performed by varying the duration of the signal while<br>
holding all the other signal characteristics constant (amplitude, duty-cycle, frequency, and<br>
waveform) (Figure 1). This determines the optimal duration of the starting signal for the<br>
gene expression of that protein. A second dose-response curve is performed by varying the<br>
field amplitude (Figure 3) for the optimal duration of time (Figure 2). This determines the<br>
optimal field amplitude for the optimal duration of time as determined by the gene<br>
expression of the protein of interest. A third dose-response curve is then performed, this time<br>
varying the duty-cycle from 100% (constant) to 5% or less while holding the optimal<br>
amplitude and other signal characteristics constant (Figure 5). A dose-response is repeated<br>
a fourth time (varying frequency) (Figure 6) keeping the other signal characteristics<br>
 constant. Though not shown, the dose response may be repeated a fifth time (varying<br><br>
waveform) each time keeping the other signal characteristics constant. By this method an<br>
optimal signal is determined for producing the greatest increase in the gene expression of the<br>
protein of interest.<br>
Gene expression may be determined by any method known in the art, such as reverse<br>
transcription PCR and Northern analysis, and protein expression may be determined by<br>
spectrophotometric, fluorometric, etc. immunoassays, and the like.<br>
Type II collagen production by articular chondrocytes<br>
Articular chondrocytes were exposed to a capacitively coupled electric field of 20<br>
mV/cm at 60 kHz. The results are illustrated in Figures 1-8.<br>
Figure 1 is a graphic representation of type II collagen mRNA expression when<br>
articular cartilage chondrocytes (attomole per µl) are exposed to a 20 mV/cm capacitively<br>
coupled electric field for various time durations (0.5, 2, 6, and 24 hours). As indicated, the<br>
optimum type II collagen mRNA production occurred with a signal of 30 minutes duration.<br>
Figure 2 is a graphic representation of type II collagen mRNA expression when<br>
articular cartilage chondrocytes (attomole per µl) are exposed to a 20 mV/cm capacitively<br>
coupled field for 30 minutes. The amount of type II collagen mRNA produced after various<br>
response times - as compared to that of controls (no electricity) - is shown. As also shown,<br>
the optimum type II collagen mRNA production occurred 5.5 hours after the electrical<br>
stimulation ceased.<br>
Figure 3 is a graphic representation of type II collagen mRNA expression when<br>
articular cartilage chondrocytes are exposed to various amplitudes of a capacitively coupled<br>
electric field for 30 minutes" duration and harvested 5.5 hours after the electrical stimulation<br>
ceased. As indicated, the optimum production of type II collagen mRNA occurred with a<br>
signal producing an electric field amplitude of 20 mV/cm. By comparison, the optimal<br>
amplitude established for aggrecan mRNA has been found by the present inventor to be 10-<br>
20 mV/cm.<br>
Figure 4 is a graphic representation of Northern blot analysis of type II collagen<br>
expression (white bar) and type II collagen mRNA expression (shaded bar) when articular<br>
cartilage chondrocytes are exposed to 20 mV/cm capacitively coupled electric field for 30<br>
minutes" duration and harvested 5.5 hours after cessation of the electrical signal. As<br><br>
indicated, the Northern blot analysis of the type II collagen mRNA is 3.5-fold greater than<br>
that of unstimulated controls, and the amount of type II collagen mRNA as determined by<br>
RT-PCR is 6.5-fold greater than that of unstimulated controls.<br>
Figure 5 is a graphic representation of type II collagen mRNA expression when<br>
articular cartilage chondrocytes are exposed to a capacitively coupled electric field of<br>
various duty cycles with a duration of 30 minutes ON time at 20 mV/cm electric field<br>
amplitude and harvested 5.5 hours after cessation of the electrical signal. As indicated, the<br>
optimum duty cycle was found to be 8.3% (1 minute ON, 11 minutes OFF, 30 cycles). By<br>
comparison, the optimal duty cycle for aggrecan mRNA expression was found by the present<br>
inventor to be 50% (1 minute ON, 1 minute OFF, 30 cycles).<br>
Figure 6 is a graphic representation of type II collagen mRNA expression when<br>
articular cartilage chondrocytes are exposed to a capacitively coupled electric field of<br>
various frequencies of 30 minutes" duration (ON time) at 20 mV/cm electric field amplitude<br>
with a 8.3% duty cycle (1 minute ON, 11 minutes OFF, 30 cycles) and harvested 5.5 hours<br>
after cessation of the electrical signal. As indicated, the optimal frequency was found to be<br>
60 kHz.<br>
Figure 7 is a graphic representation of articular cartilage chondrocytes grown for 7<br>
days in culture and then exposed to a capacitively coupled electric field of 20 mV/cm, 50%<br>
duty cycle (1 minute ON, 1 minute OFF, 30 cycles), at a frequency of 60 kHz, and having a<br>
sine wave configuration. The chondrocytes were exposed to this field for 1 hour per day for<br>
7 days. Control chondrocytes were grown under the same conditions but were not exposed<br>
to any electric stimulation. No interleukin-1? (IL-1?), a cytokine that stimulates articular<br>
cartilage degradation, was present in the media of these cultures. As indicated,<br>
hydroxyproline, an amino acid that is a characteristic constituent of collagen, was increased<br>
1.7-fold when chondrocytes were exposed to the electric field as compared to control<br>
chondrocytes that were not exposed to the electric field. Those skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that since the duty cycle used in this experiment (50%) is not the optimal duty<br>
cycle for type II collagen (see Figure 5) an even greater response is expected should the<br>
optimal duty cycle (8.3%) be used.<br><br>
Figure 8 is a graphic representation of articular cartilage chondrocytes grown for 7<br>
days in culture and then exposed to a capacitively coupled electric field of 20 mV/cm, 50%<br>
duty cycle (1 minute ON, 1 minute OFF, 30 cycles), at a frequency of 60 kHz, and having a<br>
sine wave configuration. Interleukin-113 (10 ng/ml) was added to the media at day 7. The<br>
chondrocytes were then exposed to this field for 1 hour per day for 7 days. Control<br>
chondrocytes were grown under the same conditions with interleukin in the media but were<br>
not exposed to any electric stimulation. As indicated, hydroxyproline still showed a 1.4-fold<br>
increase when exposed to the electric field, despite the presence of interleukin in the media<br>
of the cultures, as compared to control cultures that were not exposed to the electric field.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that since the duty cycle used in this experiment<br>
(50%) is not the optimal duty cycle for type II collagen (see Figure 5) an even greater<br>
response is expected should the optimal duty cycle (8.3%) be used.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates a device 10 in accordance with the present invention that is used<br>
to treat a patient with osteoarthritis of the knee. As illustrated, two circular, soft conductive,<br>
self-adherent electrodes 12 are placed on the skin on either side of the knee at the level of the<br>
joint line. The electrodes 12 are attached to a power unit 14 that has a VELCRO® patch 16<br>
on the reverse side such that the power unit 14 can be attached to a VELCRO® strap (not<br>
shown) fitted around the calf, thigh or waist. The electrodes 12 may be placed on the skin<br>
before the patient goes to bed each evening or any other convenient time. Of course, other<br>
suitable types of electrodes 12 may also be used.<br>
The power unit 14 is preferably small (e.g., 6-8 ounces) and powered by a standard<br>
9-volt battery to emit a 5-volt peak-to-peak, 6-10 mAmp, 20 mV/cm, 60 kHz sine wave<br>
signal to the electrodes 12 placed on the skin. When this signal is provided approximately<br>
30 minutes per day with the proper duty cycle (8.3%), it has been shown to significantly up-<br>
regulate genes encoding type II collagen. This treatment should prevent or minimize further<br>
articular cartilage deterioration as well as to heal articular cartilage that already is damaged<br>
or degenerated.<br>
The example described above demonstrates that the expression of the type II collagen<br>
gene may be significantly up-regulated to increase the production of proteoglycan in<br>
articular cartilage so as to treat arthritis (both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis),<br><br>
cartilage injury, and cartilage defects. Proteoglycan, along with type II collagen, is the main<br>
constituent of articular cartilage and is degradated and destroyed early in the development of<br>
arthritis. The present invention clearly shows that the optimal electric field described in the<br>
example can very significantly up-regulate type II collagen mRNA and, hence, increase<br>
proteoglycan synthesis, even in the presence of TL-?1. Those skilled in the art will appreciate<br>
that an appropriate electric field, as described herein with capacitive coupling, is also equally<br>
effective with any and all electromagnetic systems that produce equivalent, or nearly<br>
equivalent, electric field characteristics. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that<br>
more particularized signal characteristics may be discovered through more experimentation<br>
with more data points, but relatively minor variations in each of the signal characteristics are<br>
believed to be within the level of those skilled in the art given the teachings herein.<br>
Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that numerous other modifications to the<br>
invention are possible within the scope of the invention. For example, the optimal field<br>
described herein can be applied to any joint via two or more appropriate surface electrodes,<br>
in pairs or strips, incorporated in garments, braces, wraps, or casts, and delivered by means<br>
of capacitive coupling, inductive coupling (electromagnetic fields), or combined fields.<br>
Accordingly, the scope of the invention is not intended to be limited to the preferred<br>
embodiment described above, but only by the appended claims.<br><br>
