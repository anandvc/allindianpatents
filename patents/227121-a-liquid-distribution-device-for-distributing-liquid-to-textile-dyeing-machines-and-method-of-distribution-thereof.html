				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a.liquid distribution device for distributing liquid to textile dyeing machines and methods of distribution thereof, to a liquid distribution device that distributes liquid to two or more textile dyeing machines.<br>
The present invention relates to a liquid distribution device for distributing liquid to a plurality of textile dyeing machines, which liquid di$tribution device comprises, a vessel having a'plurality of liquid inlet openings and liquid outlet openings in the vessel wall wherein when the device is arranged, for use, all of the outlet openings are above the inlet openings and the outlet openings are arranged on the same horizontal plane, such that in use of the device, incoming liquid from a plurality of different sources is mixed in the vessel and then distributed to the plurality of textile dyeing machines simultaneously and in substantially equal quantities through the outlet openings.<br>
In the process of dyeing batches of yam packages it is common that the quantity of yam packages exceeds the capacity of a single dyeing machine. Therefore, it is necessary to divide the yam packages into smaller batch sizes. Each, smaller, batch may then be processed by a different dyeing machine. Variants in colour and shade often result between the batches when different dyeing machines have been used.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of distributing liquid to a plurality of textile dyeing machines, wherein liquid from a plurality of different sources is pumped into a vessel, via a plurality of inlet openings in the vessel wall, from a plurality of different sources and is mixed in the vessel, the liquid is then distributed from the vessel to the plurality of textile dyeing machines via a plurality of outlet openings in the vessel wall, substantially simultaneously and in substantially equal quantities, all of the inlet openings being located below the outlet openings and the outlet openings being in substantially the same horizontal plane.<br>
To improve uniformity of colour and shade from the dying process it is common to joint the pipe-work system of two dyeing machines together by means of a coupling device. Traditional coupling methods and coupling devices are particularly suitable for use with machines fitted with extemal pipe-work.<br>
According to a traditional coupling device, dyeing liquid can re-distributed between machines by coupling the pump discharge of a first machine to the dyeing vessel of a second machine and likewise coupling the pump discharge of the second machine to the dyeing vessel of the first machine.<br>
A problem associated with this, traditional, coupling device is that the liquid level in both machines, relative to each other, becomes unequal as the dyeing process progresses. Therefore, the problems of variations in colour and shade may still occur in the yam packages in each machine.<br>
The liquid levels in both machines may be equal at the beginning of the dyeing process. However, as the dyeing process progresses, the liquid level of one machine may vary from the other due to a variation in flow rate from the pumps supplying each machine. Typically, the problem is resolved by slowing down the flow rate to one machine or shutting down one of the pumps until the liquid level of both machines equalizes.<br>
In an attempt to regulate the liquid levels, a frequency inverter may be used. Using a frequency inverter may reduce the problems associated with   unequal     liquid levels in each of the dyeing machines, but its use often results in<br><br>
increased cost of the dyeing machine and may lead to the loss of competitiveness in the market.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of preferred embodiments of the present invention to provide an improved liquid distribution device.<br>

An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a liquid distribution device;<br>
Figure 2 shows a side view of the liquid distribution device of figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 shows apian view of the liquid distribution device of figures 1 and 2; and<br>
Figure 4 shows an end elevation view of the liquid distribution device of figures 1 to 3<br>
Throughout the figures like reference numerals are used to refer to like features.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 4 there is shown a liquid distribution device that distributes liquid to two textile dyeing machines.<br>
A vessel 9 is arranged intermediate and to be in liquid distribution with two pipe arrangements 1, 2 Each of the pipe arrangements 1, 2 consists of an inner pipe 22, 23 and<br>
an outer pipe 24, 25 co-axially arranged such that an annular passage 15, 16 is formed between them. The outer wall of the inner pipe 22, 23 and the inner wall of the outer pipe 24, 25 define the walls of the annular passage 15, 16. The inner pipe 22, 23 defines an inner passage.<br>
A separation plate 3, 4 fits over the inner pipe 22, 23 to divide the annular passage 15,16 into two chambers 11, 12, 13, 14, a fore chamber 11, 12 and a back chamber 13, 14. The plate is inclined relative to the longitudinal axis of the pipe arrangement and is substantially elliptical in shape with the Outer edge and inner edge of the plate 3. 4 contacting the outer and inner surfaces of the annular passage 15,16 respectively.<br>
The fore chamber 11, 12 and the back chamber 13, 14 cormect respectively with the inlet pipe 5, 6 and outlet pipe 7, 8 to facilitate liquid flow to and fi-om the vessel 9.<br>
The vessel 9 is connected to two inlet pipes 5, 6 and two outlet pipes 7, 8. The proximal end 26, 27 of each inlet pipe 5, 6 is bent or has an elbow connection attached thereto, and extends into the vessel 9. The arrangement, of the proximal ends 26, 27 of the inlet pipes<br>
5,	6, provides liquid flow in a direction corresponding to the bend or elbow angle so that<br>
the direction of liquid flow is directed away from the longitudinal axis of the inlet pipe 5,<br>
6.	The inlet pipes 5, 6 are arranged so as to avoid a head on collision of incoming liquid.<br>
The preferred change of flow direction corresponds to an angle of 33° from the<br>
longitudinal axis of the inlet pipe. The proximal ends 26, 27 of the inlet pipes 5, 6 are<br>
arranged facing each other on opposing sides of the vessel 9, so that the incoming liquid<br>
flow creates swirling motion and turbulent flow to encourage mixing of the incoming<br>
liquid.<br>
The distal end of each of the inlet pipes 5, 6 extends from the vessel and couples with the fore chamber 11,12 of corresponding the pipe arrangement 1, 2.<br>
Similarly, the distal end of each of the outlet pipes 7, 8 extends fi-om the vessel 9 and couples with the back chamber 13, 14 of the corresponding pipe arrangement 1,2.<br>

Bold arrows shown in figure 1 indicate the liquid flow cycle using the liquid flow distribution device of figures 1 to 4.<br>
To begin the dyeing cycle, liquid flows 10, 19 are each pump driven to the fore chambers 11, 12, respectively. Liquid is transported from each of the fore chambers 11, 12 through the inlet pipes 5, 6 into the vessel 9. The entry direction of the liquid flow creates a swirling motion and the liquid flow 10,19 are mixed and combined within the vessel 9.<br>
The mixed liquid is equally distributed between the outlets 28, 29 and is transported through the outlet pipes 7, 8 to the associated respective back chamber 13, 14 of the pipe arrangement 1, 2. Liquid flow 20, 21 exists the back chambers 13, 14 and is transferred to an associated dyeing machine (not shown) to facilitate the dyeing process.<br>
To complete the liquid flow cycle, liquid 17, 18 in the dyeing machine is drawn back into the pump suction via the inner pipe 22, 23 to complete the cycle. Subsequently, the pump (not shown) discharges the liquid flow 17, 18 in the opposite direction as flows 10, 19 through the fore chamber 15, 16 to begin the whole process again. The continuous flow cycle provides uniform colour and shade from each of the dyeing machines (now shown).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
