Device for the feeding of auxiliary operating facilities for a fuel-electrically driven vehicle<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical area<br>
The invention relates to the area of auxiliary operating facilities for fuel-electrically driven vehicles. It is based on a device for the feeding of auxiliary operating facilities for a fuel-electrically driven vehicle according to the preamble of the independent claims.<br>
Prior art<br>
Today, auxiliary operating facilities for fuel-electrically driven vehicles are mainly employed in diesel-electric locomotives or large diesel-electric mine vehicles, where the auxiliary operating facilities are constructed as fans, air-conditioning systems, actuators, on-board network converters etc. Such auxiliary operating facilities are popularly fed by means of a suitable device. Such a device for the feeding of auxiliary operating facilities for a fuel-electrically driven vehicle is for example mentioned in the US 6,087,791 and in the DE 200 01 113 U1. In it the device has a combustion engine, a generator driven by the combustion engine and a rectifier connected with the generator on the AC voltage side. On the DC voltage side the rectifier is<br><br>
connected with a first and a second connection of a DC voltage circuit. In addition, with the device according to DE 200 01 113 U1, a multiplicity of inverters is connected to the first and second connection of the DC voltage circuit, which inverters each supply the relevant auxiliary operating facility such as for example fan, air-conditioning system, actuator, on-board network converter etc. with electric energy. According to the US 6,087,791 and the DE 200 01 113 U1 a drive inverter is also connected to the first and second connection of the DC voltage circuit, which drive inverter on the AC voltage side feeds one or several drive motors of the vehicle.<br>
Obviously it is also conceivable that a second rectifier connected with a generator is provided. The second rectifier is then connected on the DC voltage side with a first and a second connection of a second DC voltage circuit, while a second drive inverter is connected to the first and second connection of the second DC voltage circuit, which second drive inverter on the AC voltage side feeds one or several drive motors of the vehicle.<br>
Since the power requirement of such drive motors is very high, a DC voltage of several kilo-volts is typically present between the first and the second connection of the DC voltage circuit in order to be able to provide the appropriate power. Problematic in this context with the device for the feeding of auxiliary operating facilities for a fuel-electrically driven vehicle of the US 6,087,791 and the DE 200 01 113U1 is that the inverters connected to the first and second connection of the DC voltage circuit have to be designed to the high DC voltage mentioned above, i.e. the power semiconductor switches of the respective inverters have to have a high blocking capability and suitable protective facilities and operating methods specifically adapted to these. The construction of the inverters is thus highly complicated, susceptible to faults and accordingly requires a lot of space. In addition, insulation distances of the supply lines and rails to the inverters and between the inverters themselves have to be maintained, which requires additional space. This complicated and space-intensive construction of the inverters and the device for the feeding of auxiliary operating facilities consequently causes major expenditure in terms of installation and maintenance. Especially a simple, compact and robust construction of the device for the feeding of auxiliary operating facilities however is extremely desirable with a fuel-electrically driven vehicle.<br><br>
In the DE 94 13 638 U1 a device for the feeding of auxiliary operating facilities for a fuel-electrically driven vehicle is also disclosed, which device has a first combustion engine and a first generator driven by the first combustion engine. On the AC voltage side with the first generator, a first rectifier assigned to the first generator is connected, wherein a first step-down converter is connected downstream of the first rectifier. An assigned first DC voltage circuit is connected downstream of the first step-down converter with which first DC voltage circuit a first inverter for the feeding of auxiliary operating facilities is connected. In addition to this, the device of the DE 94 13 638 U1 has a second combustion engine and a second generator driven by the second combustion engine. On the AC voltage side a second rectifier assigned to the second generator is connected to the second generator while a second step-down converter is connected downstream of the second rectifier. An assigned second DC voltage circuit is connected downstream of the second step-down converter with which second BC voltage circuit a second inverter for the feeding of auxiliary operatingfacilities is connected.<br>
Presentation of the invention<br>
The object of the invention therefore is to state a device for the feeding of auxiliary operating facilities for a fuel-electrically driven vehicle which has low space requirements and is additionally sturdy and not susceptible to faults. This object is solved through the characteristics of claim 1, claim 2 and claim 15 respectively. In the dependent claims advantageous developments of the invention are stated.<br>
The device for the feeding of auxiliary operating facilities for a fuel-electrically driven vehicle according to the invention comprises a combustion engine, a generator driven by the combustion engine, and a rectifier connected with the generator on the AC voltage side and assigned to the generator, wherein the rectifier on the DC voltage side is connected to a first and a second connection of a DC voltage circuit assigned to the rectifier and connected downstream of the rectifier. According to the invention, a first and a second step-down converter is provided, wherein the first and second step-down converter each is connected to the first and second connection of the DC voltage circuit and the first and second step-down converter is further connected to a common DC voltage rail system for the feeding of the auxil-<br><br>
iary operating facilities connected downstream of the first and second step-down converter. Inverters of the auxiliary operating facilities and/or DC voltage converters of the auxiliary operating facilities are connected to the common DC voltage rail system for their feeding.<br>
Through the two step-down converters the voltage on the DC voltage rail system can be set with advantage. This setting is performed such that the voltage on the DC voltage rail system is lower than the voltage between the first and second connection of the DC voltage circuit. By means of the voltage of the DC voltage rail system which is lower compared with the DC voltage circuit the insulation distance of the DC voltage rail system, i.e. of the rail system legs of the DC voltage rail system can be reduced so that space can be saved with advantage and the installation and maintenance expenditure kept low in addition. Furthermore a redundant feed of the DC voltage rail system is possible through the two step-down converters connected to the common DC.voltage rail systefff, le. in the event of a fault or a failure of a step-down converter, feeding of the DC voltage rail system is carried out by way of the other step-down converter so that the auxiliary operating facilities can continue to be fed via their inverters and/or DC voltage converters. As a result, the device according to the invention is highly robust, not susceptible to faults and characterized by high availability.<br>
By means of the voltage of the DC voltage rail system which is lower in comparison with the DC voltage circuit the inverters and/or DC voltage converters of the auxiliary operating facility, i.e. the power semiconductor switches of the inverters and/or DC voltage converters with corresponding protective facilities and operating methods for example need not be designed to the high voltage of the DC voltage circuit as is known from the prior art, but merely to the lower voltage of the DC voltage rail system. Advantageously the construction of the inverters and/or DC voltage converters is simplified as a result, the inverters and/or DC voltage converters are less susceptible to faults and require correspondingly less space. In addition, the simple and space-saving construction of the inverters and/or DC voltage converters causes less installation and maintenance expenditure.<br>
As an alternative to the second step-down converter a further rectifier connected with the generator on the AC voltage side and assigned to the generator is provided wherein the first step-down converter and the further rectifier are connected with a common DC voltage rail<br><br>
system connected downstream of the first step-down converter and the further rectifier for the feeding of the auxiliary operating facilities.<br>
Through the first step-down converter and the further rectifier the voltage on the DC voltage rail system can likewise be set with advantage as has already been explained with the solution with two step-down converters. By means of the voltage of the DC voltage rail system achieved which is lower in comparison with the DC voltage circuit, the insulation distance of the DC voltage rail system, i.e. the rail system legs of the DC voltage rail system can be reduced so that with advantage space can be saved and the installation and maintenance expenditure kept low in addition. In addition, redundant feeding of the DC voltage rail system is possible through the first step-down converter and the further rectifier, both of which are connected with the common DC voltage rail system, i.e. during a fault or a failure for example of the step-dowFreonverter, feeding of the DC voltage rail system is carried oufvFa*the rectifier so that the auxiliary operating facilities can continue to be fed via their inverters and/or DC voltage converters. The device according to the invention is thus very robust, not susceptible to faults and characterized by high availability.<br>
With the alternative solution with the first step-down converter and the further rectifier, too, the inverters and/or DC voltage converters of the auxiliary operating facilities for instance need not be designed for the high voltage of the DC voltage circuit as is known from the prior art because of the voltage of the DC voltage rail system, which is lower in comparison with the DC voltage circuit, but merely for the lower voltage of the DC voltage rail system. Advantageously, the construction of the inverters and/or DC voltage converters is simplified as a result, the inverters and/or DC voltage converters are less susceptible to faults and require correspondingly less space. In addition, the simple and space-saving construction of the inverters and/or DC voltage converters causes less installation and maintenance expenditure.<br>
As a further alternative the device for the feeding of auxiliary operating facilities for a fuel-electrically driven vehicle according to the invention comprises a combustion engine, a generator driven by the combustion engine and first and second rectifiers connected with the generator on the AC voltage side and assigned to the generator, wherein the first rectifier is connected on the DC voltage side with a first and a second connection of a first DC voltage circuit assigned to the first rectifier and connected downstream of the first rectifier and the<br><br>
second rectifier on the DC voltage side with a first and a second connection of a second DC voltage circuit assigned to the second rectifier and connected downstream of the second rectifier. According to the invention a first and a second step-down converter is then provided wherein the first step-down converter is connected with the first and second connection of the first DC voltage circuit and the second step-down converter with the first and second connection of the second DC voltage circuit and the first and second step-down converter continues to be connected with a common DC voltage rail system for the feeding of the auxiliary operating facilities connected downstream of the first and second step-down converter. Inverters of the auxiliary operating facilities and/or DC voltage converters of the auxiliary operating facilities are then also connected to the common DC voltage rail system for their feeding. The advantages mentioned above also apply to this alternative solution.<br>

As a matter of principle, identical parts are provided with identical reference-numbers in the Figures.: The described embodiments stand as exampies'for the~ subject matter of the invention and have no restrictive effect.<br>
Ways of carrying out the invention<br>
In Fig. 1, a first embodiment of the device for the feeding of auxiliary operating facility for a fuel-electrically driven vehicle according to the invention is shown. The device according to Fig. 1 according to the invention comprises a combustion engine 1, a generator 2 driven by the combustion engine 1 and a rectifier 3 connected on the AC voltage side with the generator 2 and assigned to the generator 2, wherein the rectifier 3 on the DC voltage side is connected with a first and second connection 5, 6 of a DC voltage circuit 4 assigned to the rectifier 3 and connected downstream of the rectifier 3. According to the invention, a first and a second step-down converter 7, 8 is provided, wherein each the first and the second step-down converter 7, 8 is connected with the first and second connection 5, 6 of the DC voltage circuit 4. According to Fig. 1 the DC voltage circuit 4 with regard to the first and second step-down converter 7, 8 more preferably constitutes a common DC voltage circuit 4, wherein more preferably the first and second step-down converter 7, 8 is connected downstream of the DC voltage circuit 4. In addition, the first and second step-down converter 7, 8 is connected with a common DC voltage rail system 9 for the feeding of auxiliary operating facilities 10 connected downstream of the first and second step-down converter 7, 8. According to Fig.<br><br>
1, inverters of the auxiliary operating facilities 10 and/or DC voltage converters of the auxiliary operating facilities 10 are connected to the common DC voltage rail system 9 for their feeding.<br>
Through the two step-down converters 7, 8 the voltage can be set on the DC voltage rail system 9 with advantage. This setting is carried out such that the voltage on the DC voltage rail system 9 is lower than the voltage between the first and second connection 5, 6 of the DC voltage circuit 4. Through the voltage of the DC voltage rail system 9 which is lower in comparison with the DC voltage circuit 4 the insulation distance of the rail system legs of the DC voltage rail system 9 can be reduced so that advantageously space can be saved and additionally the installation and maintenance expenditure kept low or minimised. Furthermore, redundant feeding of the DC voltage rail system 9 is possible through the two step-down converters 7, 8 connected with the common DC voltage^.rail system 9. This means that in the.:   . event of a fault or a failure for example of the first step-down converter 7 the feed of the DC voltage rail system 9 is performed via the second step-down converter 8 so that the auxiliary operating facilities 10 can continue to be fed by way of their inverters and/or DC voltage converters. The device according to the invention is thus highly robust, not susceptible to faults and characterized by high availability.<br>
According to Fig. 1 the respective step-down converter 7, 8 is formed through a series circuit of a controllable power semiconductor switch 11 with a diode 12 and through a capacity 13 connected in parallel with the series circuit of the controllable power semiconductor switch 11 with the diode 12. According to Fig. 1 the controllable power semiconductor switch 11 is designed as bipolar transistor with gate electrode arranged in an insulated manner (IGBT). However it is also conceivable that the controllable power semiconductor switch is designed as power MOSFET, as turn-off thyristor (GTO - Gate Turn-Off Thyristor) or as integrated thyristor with commutated gate electrode (IGCT - Integrated Gate Commutated Thyristor). According to Fig. 1, the controllable power semiconductor switch 11 with the respective step-down converter 7, 8 is additionally connected with the first connection 5 of the DC voltage circuit 4 and the diode 12 with the second connection 6 of the DC voltage circuit 4. In addition, with the respective step-down converter 7, 8, the diode 12 is connected through a first connection 14 and the connection point of the diode 12 with the controllable power semiconductor switch 11 through a second connection 15 with the common DC voltage rail system 9.<br><br>
The respective step-down converter 7, 8 consequently manages with a minimum number of components and can thus be realised very easily and space-savingly. Through the low number of components the first and second step-down converter 7, 8 are particularly robust and not susceptible to faults and therefore have a high availability.<br>
According to Fig. 1 with the respective step-down converter 7, 8 a filter circuit 16 is additionally connected between the first connection 14, 15 and the common DC voltage rail system 9 and to the second connection 15. The filter circuit 16 advantageously results in that undesirable voltage fluctuations and current fluctuations created through switching actions of the respective step-down converter 7, 8 are filtered out so that the voltage of the DC voltage rail system 9, i.e. the voltage present between the rail system legs, is nearly a DC voltage.<br>
-In-contrast wjth the first embodiment SGcarding-to. Fig. 1, a current direction limitation element c 17 each is connected with the respective step-down converter 7, 8 in the first connection 14 and in the second connection 15 in a second embodiment of the device according to the invention according to Fig. 2. The respective current direction limitation element 17 serves to ensure that only a current in defined current direction flows from the respective step-down converter 7, 8 to the DC voltage rail system 9 and, in a defined manner, back again. As a result, it is advantageously avoided that a fault current, for example caused through faults of the DC voltage rail system 9 and/or a fault in one or in several auxiliary operating facilities 10 can flow back to the respective step-down converter 7, 8 and damage or even destroy the respective step-down converter 7, 8. The respective current direction limitation element 17 according to Fig. 2 is preferably designed as a diode and can thus be advantageously realised very easily and space-savingly.<br>
In contrast with the first and second embodiment of the device according to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 the respective step-down converter 7, 8 in a third embodiment of the device according to the invention, according to Fig. 3, is formed through a first and a second series circuit 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b each of a controllable power semiconductor switch 11a, 11b with a diode 12a, 12b and through a capacity 13 each connected in parallel with each series circuit, wherein the diode 12a of the first series circuit 7a, 8a is connected with the diode 12b of the second series circuit 7b, 8b. According to Fig. 3 the controllable power semiconductor switch 11a, 11b is designed as a bipolar transistor with gate electrode designed in an insulated manner (IGBT).<br><br>
However it is also conceivable that the controllable power semiconductor switch is designed as power MOSFET, as turn-off thyristor (GTO - Gate Turn-Off Thyristor) or as integrated thy-ristor with commutated gate electrode (IGCT - Integrated Gate Commutated Thyristor). According to Fig. 3 with the respective step-down converter 7, 8, the controllable power semiconductor switch 11a of the first series circuit 7a, 8a is connected with the first connection 5 of the DC voltage circuit 4 and the controllable power semiconductor switch 11b of the second series circuit 7b, 8b with the second connection 6 of the DC voltage circuit 4. In addition, with the respective step-down converter 7, 8, the connecting point of the diode 12a of the first series circuit 7a, 8a with the controllable power semiconductor switch 11a of the first series circuit 7a, 8a is connected with the common DC voltage rail system 9 through a first connection 14. In addition, with the respective step-down converter 7, 8, the connecting point of the diode 12b of the second series circuit 7b, 8b with the controllable power semiconductor switch 11b of the second series circuit 7b,- 8b is connected with the common-DG voltage rail system 9 through a second connection 15. Through the embodiment of the first and second step-down converter 7, 8 described above a voltage of the DC voltage circuit 4 which is higher compared with the embodiment of the first and second step-down converter 7, 8 according to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 can be connected since this voltage is split over the two capacities 13 of the respective step-down converter 7, 8. If however a comparable voltage of the DC voltage 4 as with the embodiment of the first and second step-down converter 7, 8 according to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 is selected, more economical low-voltage semiconductors can be used for the relevant controllable power semiconductor switches 11a, 11b and diodes 12a, 12b because of the splitting of this voltage over the two capacities 13, which can be operated with a high switching frequency. Step-down converters 7, 8 designed in this way advantageously generate less undesirable voltage fluctuations and current fluctuations and consequently cause less EMC problems. In addition, step-down converters 7, 8 designed in this way only have minimum conductance and switching losses so that the step-down converter 7, 8 can be operated particularly efficiently. The respective step-down converter 7, 8 according to Fig. 3 additionally manages to get by with a minimum quantity of components and can therefore be realised very easily and space-savingly. Through the low quantity of components the first and second step-down converters 7, 8 are particularly robust and not susceptible to faults and therefore have a high availability.<br><br>
According to Fig. 3 with the respective step-down converter 7, 8 a filter circuit 16 is connected between the first connection 14 and the common DC voltage rail system 9 and between the second connection 15 and common DC voltage rail system 9. The filter circuit 16 advantageously results in that undesirable voltage fluctuations and current fluctuations created through switching actions of the respective step-down converter 7, 8 are filtered out so that the voltage of the DC voltage rail system 9, i.e. the voltage present between the rail system legs, is nearly a DC voltage.<br>
In a fourth embodiment of the device according to the invention according to Fig. 4, in contrast with the third embodiment according to Fig. 3, a current direction limitation element 17 each is connected with the respective step-down converter 7, 8 in the first connection 14 and in the second connection 15. The respective current direction limitation element 17 serves to ensure~that only a current in defined current direction" flows from the respective sfep^down   — converter 7, 8 to the DC voltage rail system 9 and, in a defined manner, back again. As a result it is advantageously avoided that a fault current, for instance caused through a fault of the DC voltage rail system 9 and/or a fault in one or in several auxiliary operating facilities 10, can flow back to the respective step-down converter 7, 8 and damage or even destroy the respective step-down converter 7, 8. The respective current direction limitation element 17 according to Fig. 4 is preferably designed as a diode and therefore advantageously realised very easily and space-savingly.<br>
In a fifth and sixth embodiment of the device according to the invention according to Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 a further rectifier 21 connected with the generator 2 on the AC voltage side is provided alternatively to the first, second, third and fourth embodiment according to Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 instead of the step-down converter 8, wherein the first step-down converter 7 and a further rectifier 21 connected with the generator 2 on the AC voltage side and assigned to the generator 2 is connected with a common DC voltage rail system 9 for the feeding of the auxiliary operating facilities 10 connected downstream of the first step-down converter 7 and the further rectifier 21. According to Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 the first step-down converter 7 is connected downstream more preferably of the DC voltage circuit 4. In addition, the first step-down converter 7 according to Fig. 5 is embodied and connected or switched according to the first step-down converter according to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 and has the already mentioned advantages. Moreover the first step-down converter 7 according to Fig. 6 is de-<br><br>
signed and connected or switched according to the first step-down converter according to Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 and also has the two already mentioned advantages.<br>
Through the first step-down converter 7 and the further rectifier 21 the voltage on the DC voltage rail system 9 can be set with advantage. This setting is performed such that the voltage on the DC voltage rail system 9 is lower than the voltage between the first and second connection 5, 6 of the DC voltage circuit 4. Through the voltage of the DC voltage rail system 9 which is lower in comparison with the DC voltage circuit 4 the insulation distance of the rail system legs of the DC voltage rail system 9 can be reduced so that advantageously space can be saved and additionally the installation and maintenance expenditure can be kept low or minimised. In addition, through the first step-down converter 7 and the further rectifier 21, both of which are connected with the common DC voltage rail system 9, a redundant feed of<br>
the DC veltage rail system 9 is possible. This means that in the-event of a faultor-a farhJre for	<br>
example of the first step-down converter 7 the feed of the DC voltage rail system 9 is performed by way of the further rectifier 21 so that the auxiliary operating facilities 10 can continue to be fed by way of their inverters and/or the DC voltage converters. As a result, the device according to the invention is highly robust, not susceptible to faults and characterized by high availability.<br>
According to Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 a current direction limitation element 17 each is connected into the first connection 14 and in the second connection 15 with the further rectifier 21 as well as with the first step-down converter 7. The respective current direction limitation element 17 serves to ensure that only a current flows in defined current direction from the first step-down converter 7 and from the further rectifier 21 to the DC voltage rail system 9 and, defined, back again. As a result, it is advantageously avoided that a fault current, for example caused through a fault of the DC voltage rail system 9 and/or a fault in one or in several auxiliary operating facilities 10, is able to flow back to the first step-down converter 7 or the further rectifier 21 and damage or even destroy the first step-down converter 7 or the further rectifier 20. The respective current direction limitation element 17 according to Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 is preferably designed as a diode and can therefore be advantageously realised highly simply and space-savingly.<br><br>
To isolate the faulty or failed first step-down converter 7 or the further rectifier 21 as mentioned above, an isolating element 21 is connected into the first and second connection 14, 15 both with the further rectifier 21 and the first step-down converter 7.

The isolating element 20 is preferably embodied as low-inductive switch, for example as a mechanical or controllable power semiconductor switch, or as a fuse.<br>
With all embodiments of the device according to the invention according to Fig. 1 to Fig. 4 the common DC voltage rail system 9 has an overvoltage limitation network 18. The over-voltage limitation network 18 is formed through a resistor and a controllable switch, preferably a controllable power semiconductor switch, wherein the overvoltage limitation network 18 is actuated by closing the switch when an bvervbltage of the voltage of the DC voltage-raiT -system 9 occurs. Advantageously, when the switch is actuated, energy of the DC voltage rail system 9 is converted into heat in the resistor and consequently the voltage of the DC voltage rail system 9 reduced easily, quickly and effectively. The actuation of the overvoltage limitation network 18 preferably takes place for a specified period of time. This period of time is preferably specified as a function of the thermal capacity of the resistor. Actuation takes place according to criteria known to the expert which will not be discussed in more detail at this point.<br>

tifiers 3a, 3b assigned to the generator 2 are now connected with the generator 2 on the AC voltage side, wherein the first rectifier 3a on the DC voltage side is connected with a first and a second connection 5a, 6a of a first DC voltage circuit 4a assigned to the first rectifier 3a and connected downstream of the first rectifier 3a and the second rectifier 3b on the DC voltage side with a first and a second connection 5b, 6b of a second DC voltage circuit 4b assigned to the second rectifier 3b and connected downstream of the second rectifier 3b. According to the invention, a first and a second step-down converter 7, 8 is then provided, wherein the first step-down converter 7 is connected with the first and second connection 5a, 6a of the first DC voltage circuit 4a and the second step-down converter 8 with the first and second connection 5b, 6b of the second DC voltage circuit 4b. In addition, the first and second step-down converters 7,8 is connected with a common DC voltage rail system 9 for the feeding of the auxiliary operating facilities 10 connected downstream of the first and second step-down €onv6rter7,8. According to Fig. 7 to Fig. 10 the first step-down converter 7 is more preferably connected downstream of the first DC voltage circuit 4a and the second step-down converter 8 more preferably connected downstream of the second DC voltage circuit 4b. According to Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 the common DC voltage rail system 9 has two of the rail system legs. According to Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 inverters of the auxiliary operating facilities 10 and/or DC voltage converters of the auxiliary operating facilities 10 are connected to the common DC voltage rail system 9 for their feeding.<br>
Through the two step-down converters 7, 8 according to Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 the voltage on the DC voltage rail system 9 can be set with advantage. This setting is performed such that the voltage on the DC voltage rail system 9 is lower than the voltage between the first and second connection 5a, 5b, 6a, 6b of the respective DC voltage circuit 4a, 4b. Through the voltage of the DC voltage rail system 9 which is lower in comparison with the respective DC voltage circuit 4a, 4b the insulation distance of the rail system legs of the DC voltage rail system 9 can be reduced so that advantageously space can be saved and the installation and maintenance expenditure additionally kept low or minimised. Furthermore, through the two step-down converters 7, 8 connected with the common DC voltage rail system 9 a redundant feed of the DC voltage rail system 9 is possible. This means that in the event of a fault or a failure for example of the first step-down converter 7 the feed of the DC<br>
voltage rail system 9 is performed by way of the second step-down converter 8 so that the<br>
*<br>
auxiliary operating facilities 10 can continue to be fed by way of their inverters and/or DC volt-<br><br>
age converters. As a result, the device according to the invention is highly robust, not susceptible to faults and characterized by high availability.<br>

According to Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 the controllable power semiconductor switch 11 is designed as a bipolar transistor with gate electrode arranged in an insulated manner (IGBT). However, it is also conceivable that the controllable power semiconductor switch is designed as power MOSFET, as turn-off thyristor (GTO - Gate Turn-Off Thyristor) or as integrated thyristor with commutated gate electrode (IGCT - Integrated Gate Commutated Thyristor). According to Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig.<br>
10 the controllable power semiconductor switch 11 with the respective stepdown convefter7,	<br>
8 is additionally connected with the first connection 5a, 5b of the corresponding DC voltage circuit 4a, 4b and the diode 12 with the second connection 6a, 6b of the corresponding DC voltage circuit 4a, 4b. In addition to this, with the respective step-down converter 7, 8, the diode 12 is connected with the common DC voltage rail system 9 through a first connection 14 and the connecting point of the diode 12 with the controllable power semiconductor switch 11 through a second connection 15.

According to Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 with the respective step-down converter 7, 8 a filter circuit 16 is additionally connected between the first connection 14 and the common DC voltage rail system 9 and to the second connection 15. The filter circuit 16 advantageously results in that undesirable voltage fluctuations and current fluctuations created through switching actions of the respective step-down converter 7, 8 are filtered out so that the voltage of the DC voltage rail system 9, i.e. the voltage present between the rail system legs, is nearly a DC voltage.<br><br>
In the eighth embodiment of the device according to the invention according to Fig. 8, in contrast with the seventh embodiment according to Fig. 7, with the respective step-down converter 7,8, a current direction limitation element 17 each is connected to the first connection 14 and to the second connection 15. The respective current direction limitation element 17 serves to ensure that only a current in defined current direction flows from the respective step-down converter 7, 8 to the DC voltage rail system 9 and, in a defined manner, back again. As a result, it is advantageously avoided that a fault current, for example caused through faults of the DC voltage rail system 9 and/or a fault in one or in several auxiliary operating facilities 10, can flow back to the respective step-down converter 7, 8 and damage or even destroy the respective step-down converter 7, 8. The respective current direction limitation element 17 according to Fig. 8 is preferably designed as a diode and consequently can be realised very easily and space-savingly.<br>
In the ninth embodiment of the device according to the invention according to Fig. 9 in contrast with the seventh and eighth embodiment according to Fig. 7 and Fig.B the respective step-down converter 7, 8 is formed through a first and a second series circuit 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b each of a controllable power semiconductor switch 11a, 11b with a diode 12a, 12b and through a capacity 13 each connected in parallel with each series circuit, wherein the diode 12a of the first series circuit 7a, 8a is connected with a diode 12b of the second series circuit 7b, 8b. According to Fig. 9 the controllable power semiconductor switch 11a, 11 b is designed as a bipolar transistor with gate electrode arranged in an insulated manner (IGBT). However it is also conceivable that the controllable power semi-conductor switch is designed as power MOSFET, as turn-off thyristor (GTO - Gate Turn-Off Thyristor) or as integrated thyristor with commutated gate electrode (IGCT - Integrated Gate Commutated Thyristor). According to Fig. 9 with the respective step-down converter 7, 8, the controllable power semi-conductor switch 11a of the first series circuit 7a, 8a is connected with the first connection 5a, 5b of the corresponding DC voltage circuit 4a, 4b and the controllable power semiconductor switch 11b of the second series circuit 7b, 8b with the second connection 6a, 6b of the DC voltage circuit 4a, 4b.

In addition, with the respective step-down converter 7, 8 the connecting point of the diode 12b of the second series circuit 7b, 8b with the controllable<br><br>
power semiconductor switch 11b of the second series circuit 7b, 8b is connected with the common DC voltage rail system 9 through a second connection 15. Through.the embodiment of the first and second step-down converter 7, 8 described above a higher voltage of the respective DC voltage 4a, 4b in comparison with the embodiment of the first and second step-down converter 7, 8 according to Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 can be connected since this voltage is split over the two capacities 13 of the respective step-down converters 7, 8. If however a comparable voltage of the respective DC voltage circuit 4a, 4b as with the embodiment of the first and second step-down converter 7, 8 according to Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 is selected, because of the division of this voltage over the two capacities 13 of the respective step-down converter 7, 8, economical low voltage semiconductors can be used for the corresponding controllable semiconductor switches 11a, 11b and diodes 12a, 12b, which can be operated with a high switching frequency. Step-down converters 7, 8 designed such advantageously generate less undesirable voltage fluctuations and current fluctuations and consequently cause less EMC problems. In addition, step-down converters 7, 8 designed thus only have minimum conductance and switching losses so that the step-down converters 7, 8 can be operated particularly efficiently. The respective step-down converter 7, 8 according to Fig. 9 additionally manages with a minimum quantity of components and can consequently be realised very easily and space-savingly. Through the low quantity of components the first and second step-down converter 7, 8 is particularly robust and not susceptible to faults and thus has a high availability.<br>
According to Fig. 9 a filter circuit 16 is connected with the respective step-down converter 7, 8 between the first connection 14 and the common DC voltage rail system 9 and between the second connection 15 and the common DC voltage rail system 9.

converter 7, 8 to the DC voltage rail system 9 and, defined, back again. As a result it is advantageously avoided that a fault current for example caused through a fault of the DC voltage rail system 9 and/or a fault in one or in several auxiliary operating facilities 10 can flow back to the respective step-down converter 7, 8 and damage or even destroy the respective step-down converter 7, 8. The respective current direction limitation element 17 according to Fig. 10 is preferably designed as a diode and can thus be realised advantageously very easily and space-savingly.<br>
