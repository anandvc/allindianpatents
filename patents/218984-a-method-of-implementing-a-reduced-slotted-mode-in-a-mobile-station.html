Serial No. 60/448343, entitled "APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR<br>
IMPLEMENTING A REDUCED SLOTTED MODE IN A COMMUNICATION<br>
SYSTEM,* filed February 13,2003, which is commonly owned and<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of communication<br>
systems, and more particularly, to an apparatus and method for implementing<br>
a reduced slotted mode in a communication system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Call setup for a mobile station terminated call can take several<br>
seconds or more to complete. Although this length of time may be<br>
acceptable for voice calls, it has a significant negative impact on the user's<br>
perception of call quality for data calls. Therefore, in typical deployments, the<br>
traffic channel is maintained during a period of data inactivity before the data<br>
call is released to the dormant state. Such prolonged maintenance of the<br>
data call during periods of data inactivity results in inefficient use of RF and<br>
channel element resources, The desirable reduction or elimination of hold<br>
overtime, while preserving acceptable service for the end user, requires fast<br>
call setup time.<br>
One of the most significant components of call setup For mobile station<br>
terminated calls is the paging delay. White in the idle State, the mobile<br>
station typically operates in the Slotted Mode in order to conserve battery life.<br>
in the Slotted Mode, the mobile station monitors the forward common control<br>
channel for pages only during certain assigned time slots. The Slot Cycle<br>
Index (SCI) governs how often the mobile station checks for a page. The<br>
lowest currently standardized SCI value (i.e. 0) corresponds to 1.28 seconds.<br><br>
WO 20004/075416	PCT/US 2004/005759<br>
Thus, a page for a mobile station using the shortest slot cycle in the Slotted<br>
Mode can be delayed up to 1.23 seconds, even when the lowest SCl value is<br>
used.<br>
As previously described, the cdma2000 standard currently supports<br>
the concept of Slotted Mode. Slotted Mode is described in the TIA/EIA 15-<br>
2000.5 standard, section 2.6.2.1,1.3, However, Slotted Mode as currently<br>
defined has a significant impact to call setup delay because the shortest slot<br>
cycle is 1.23 seconds, The cdma2000 standard also currently supports a<br>
Slotted Timer feature. in accordance with this feature, the mobile station<br>
operates in Non-Slotted Mode, i.e., continuously monitors the forward<br>
common control channel, following its release from the traffic channel for a<br>
duration of time specified by the Slotted Timer (provided by the base station).<br>
A significant drawback to this feature is thet continuously monitoring the<br>
forward common control channel has a significant impact on the battery life of<br>
the mobile station. Also, the feature is controlled entirely by the base station.<br>
The mobile station is unable to request being put in Non-Slotted Mode.<br>
One proposed solution thet has been introduced for standards body<br>
consideration is to allow reduced SCl values. If accepted, the proposal would<br>
reduce the shortest slot cycle down to 80 ms. However, under the solution,<br>
the only way for a mobile station to change its SCI is via mobile registration.<br>
Therefore, in order to effectively make use of the reduced SCI without<br>
wasting mobile station battery life, the mobile station must register each time<br>
it changes between a reduced SCl value (i.e. while a packet data session is<br>
dormant) and a higher SCl value (i.e. while there is no dormant packet data<br>
session). This results in increased loading on the air and IOS interfaces,<br>
Thus, a need exists for an apparatus and method for implementing a<br>
reduced slotted mode, with minimal impact on the air and IOS interfaces.<br>

request comprises a desired reduced slotted timer value and a desired<br>
reduced slot cycle index value: determining whether the request is granted;<br>
and when the request is granted, operating in reduced slotted mode until a<br>
time corresponding to the reduced slotted timer value occurs (in the case of<br>
an absolute time, e.g., 2:30 pm on a given date) or until a period of time<br>

maximum reduced slotted timer value; when the firat message does not<br>
specify a maximum reduced slotted timer value, sending a second message<br>
to the base station requesting reduced slotted mode, wherein the second<br>
message specifies a reduced slotted timer value and a desired reduced slot<br><br>
WO 20004/075416	PCT/US 2004/005759<br>

slotted timer value, sending a second message to the base station requesting<br>
reduced slotted rnode. wherein the second message specifies a reduced slot<br>
cycle Index and a reduced slotted timer value thet is earlier in time (in the<br>
case of an absolute time) then the maximum reduced slotted timer value<br>

Referring now to FlG.1, a fanctional block diagram of a system thet<br>
can be used with the present invention is shown. It is assumed thet the<br>
reader is familiar with cellular telephone systems and the manner in which<br>
messages are transmitted between a Base Transceiver Station (BTS) serving<br>
a particuler service cell and a mobile station (MS) located within thet cell. To<br>
simplify the present description, only the portion of a cellular telephone<br>
system relevant to the present invention is discussed. FIG. 1 shows, a MS<br>
102 in communication with a BTS 104 aver an air interface. The MS 102 may<br>
be but is not limited to a radiotelephone, internet appliance, Iaplop computer,<br>
or other suitable communication device. The STS 104 is coupled to a Base<br>
Station Controller (BSC) 106. The BTS 104 and BSC 106 are collectively<br>
referred to herein as the Base Station (BS) 103. The BS 105 is coupled to a<br>
Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 110 over an JOS interface (as specified in<br>
36PP2 A-S0001-A, "3GPP2 Access Network Interfaces Interoperability<br>
Specification", and subsequent versions). Any commercially available US<br>
102 can be used with the present invention. A BS 108 commercially available<br>
from Motorola, Inc., Schaumburg, 1L and a MSC 110 commercially available<br>
from Nortel Networks, Inc., can be used with the present invention.<br><br>
WO 20004/075416	PCT/US 2004/005759<br>
As commonly known in the art, the Paging Channel or the Forward<br>
Common Control Channel protocol provides for scheduling the transmission<br>
of messages for a specific MS in certain assigned slots. A MS thet monitors<br>
The Paging Channel or the Forward Common Control Channel only during<br>
certain assigned slots, typically one or two slots per slot cycle, is referred to<br>
as operating in the Slatted Mods. During the slats in which the Paging<br>
Channel or the Forward Common Control Channel is not being monitored, the<br>
MS can stop or reduce processing for power conservation. A MS may not<br>
operate in the slotted mode in any state except the Mobile Station Idle State.<br>
Currently, when the MSC 110 has data to transmit to ths MS 102, it<br>
instructs the BS 108 to page the MS 102 using the SCI thet the MS 102<br>
provided during registration. The MIS 102 also uses toe SCI to determiner how<br>
often to check for a page from the BS 103, The present invention provides<br>
an apparatus and method for operating in reduced slotted mode, wherein the<br>
MS 102 can change the SCI without registering the new SCI with the MSC<br>
110. While implementing reduced slotted mode, the BS 103 overrides ths<br>
SCI communicated by the MSC 110 and uses an SCI requested by ths MS<br>
102. Ths MS 102 also requests to operate in reduced slotted mode fora<br>
period of time. The MS 102 selects the reduced SCI and the period of time<br>
for operating in reduced slotted mode based on its knowledge of the<br>
application, the MS's capabilities, battery status and possibly information from <br>
the BS 108.<br>
in first and second embodiments of the invention, methods of<br>
implementing reduced slotted mode in the MS 102 are described. in the first<br>
embodimerit, US initiated reduced stotted mode is described. in the second<br>
embodiment, BS initiated reduced slotted mode is described. Turning now to<br>
the first embodiment, the MS 102 initiates reduced slotted mode by sending a<br>
request to the BS 108, The request includes a desired reduced SCI and a<br>
desired reduced Slotted timer value corresponding to a time period spent<br>
operating in reduced slotted mode; The timer value may define a period of<br>
time (e.g., 30 seconds) or may define an absolute time limit (3:30 pm on<br>
February 3). The MS 102 waits for the BS 103 to acknowledge whether it<br><br>
WO 20004/075416	PCT/US 2004/005759<br>
supports reduced slotted made. If the BS 108 response is thet it supports<br>
reduced slotted mode or if the MS 102 does not receive a response, the M.S<br>
102 sets the reduced Slotted timer according to the desired reduced Slotted<br>
timer value and begins operating in reduced slotted mode using its desired<br>
reduced SCI, As described in more detail below, the MS 102 may use a<br>
different reduced slotted timer value if the BS 108 so dictates.<br>
The MS 102 operates in reduced slotted mode until the timer expires<br>
and then reverts back to Normal operation. The MS 102 also reverts back to<br>
Normal operation when the MS 102 acquires the traffic channel as a result of<br>
an origination or termination while the timer is running. Normal operation in<br>
the Idle State typically means Normal Slotted Mode operation, white Normal<br>
operation in the Traffic State typically means traffic channel processing,<br>
BS Initiated reduced slotted mode in the MS 102 will now be described.<br>
After a predetermined period of inactivity over the traffic channel occurs<br>
during a packet data session, the MS 102 receives a message from the BS<br>
108 releasing the MS 102 from the traffic channel. The MS determines from<br>
the message whether the BS 108 supports reduced shotted mods, and if so,<br>
whether the BS 108 specified a maximum reduced slotted timer value. When<br>
a maximum reduced slotted timer value is specified, the MS 102 requests<br>
reduced slotted mode specifying a reduced SCI and a reduced slotted timer<br>
value thet is no greater then the maximum value specified by the BS 108.<br>
This informs the BS 108 thet the MS 102 desires to operate in reduced<br>
slotted mode using the reduced SCI for a period of time corresponding to the<br>
reduced slotted timer value. The MS 102 then releases the traffic channel<br>
and operates in reduced slotted mods until art event occurs to causa the MS<br>
102 to revert back to Normal operation.<br>
in third and fourth embodimerits of the invention, methods of<br>
implementing reduced sfotted mode fn the BS 106 are described. in the third<br>
embodiment, BS Initiated reduced slotted mode is described, in the fourth<br>
embodiment, MS initiated reduced slotted mode is described. Turning now to<br>
the third embodiment, the BS 108 initiates reduced slotted mode by sending a<br>
message to the MS 102 releasing the MS 102 from the traffic channel and<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 20004/075416					PCT/US 2004/005759<br>
indicating thet the BS 106 supports reduced slotted mode. Optionally, the<br>
message may specify a maximum time period during which the BS 108 wilI<br>
support reduced slotted mode (maximum reduced slotted timer value). when<br>
the 8S 108 receives a reduced slotted mode request from the MS 102, the<br>
request including a desired reduced SCl and a desired reduced slotted timer<br>
value, the BS 108 enables a reduced slotted timer using a timer value thet<br>
does rot exceed a maximum value as determined by the BS 108, and begins<br>
operating in reduced slotted mode using the desired reduced SCI to page the<br>
MS 102 when a page request is received. When the timer expires of when<br>
any other event occurs to cease reduced slotted mode operation, such as<br>
acquiring MS 102 on the traffic channel, the BS 108 reverts back to Normal<br>
operation. Normal operation with the MS 102 in the idle Slate typically<br>
means Normal Slotted Mode operation using the registered SCI to page the<br>
MS 102 when a page request arrives, while Normal operation with the MS<br>
102 in the Traffic State- typically maans traffic channel processing.<br>
MS initiated reduced slotted mode operation in. the BS 108 will now bs<br>
described. The BS 108 receives a reduced slotted mode request from the<br>
MS 102, the request including a destred reduoed SCI and a desired reduced<br>
slotted timer value. The BS 108 determines whether the requested reduced<br>
slotted timer value exceeds a maximum value. When the requested value<br>
exceeds the maximum, the BS 108 specifies the maximum reduced slotted<br>
timer value in a message to the MS 102 confirming support of reduced slotted<br>
mode. The BS 106 then begins slotted mode operation using the reduced<br>
SCI specified by the MS 102 for a period of time corresponding to the<br>
maximum reduced slotted timer value. When the requested value does not<br>
exceed the maximum, the BS 108 confirms that it supports reduced slotted<br>
mode and begins stotted mode operation using the reduced SCI specified by<br>
the MS 102 for a period of time corresponding to the reduced slotted timer<br>
value requested by the MS 102. When the time period expires or when any<br>
other event occurs to cease reduced slotted mode operation, the BS 108<br>
reverts back to Norm al operation.<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 20004/075416	PCT/US 2004/005759<br>
Regarding the operation of the reduced slotted mode feature in<br>
conjunction with the existing cdma2000 Slotted Timer feature described<br>
earlier, the Slotted Timer (specified by the SS) and the Reduced Slotted<br>
Timer (specified by the MS) can run concurrently, with the Non-Slotted Mode<br>
feature taking precedence over the reduced slotted mode feature while both<br>
timers are enabled.<br>
The embodiments of the method of the present invention will now be<br>
described in detail with rafarence to the flow charts of FIG. 2-5. Figure 2 is a<br>
flow diagram of the first embodiment of the method of the present invention,<br>
la accordance with the first embodiment, the MS 10.2 Initiates the request far<br>
reduced slotted mode. The method runs in the MS 102 on a microprocessor<br>
OF general purpose computer commonly known in the art. At step 201, the<br>
MS 102 sends a reduced slotted mode request to the BS 108, The request<br>
Includes a reduced SCI value and a reduced slotted timer value. At step 202,<br>
the MS 102 determines whether the BS 108 supports reduced slotted mode.<br>
tf the MS 102 receives a message from the BS 108 indicating thet the BS 108<br>
does not support reduced slotted mode, the MS 102 releases the traffic<br>
channel and continues Normal operation (step 204), Next, the method ends<br>
at step 206. If at step 202 the MS 102 receives a message from the BS 10B<br>
indicating thet the BS 106 supports reduced slotted mode ("yes") or the MS<br>
102 does not renews a response from the BS 108 ("unknown"), the MS 102<br>
determines whether the BS 108 specified a maximum reduced slotted tinner<br>
value thet is less then the requested reduced slotted timer value (step 208).<br>
if the BS specified a maximum value less then the requested value, the MS<br>
102 sets the reduced slotted timer value to the maximum value specified by<br>
the BS 108 (step 210). Next, the MS releases the traffic channel (step 212)<br>
and begins operating in reduced slotted mode with the requested reduced<br>
SCI (step 214). Referring back to step 203, if the BS did not specify a<br>
maximum reduced slotted timer value less then the requested value, the<br>
method skips step 210 and proceeds to step 212 (as previously described).<br>
There are several events thet can occur to cause the MS 102 to cease<br>
operating in reduced slotted mods. At step 216, the MS 102 monitors<br>
-s-<br><br>
WO 20004/075416	PCT/US 2004/005759<br>
whether the reduced slotted timer has expired. If the answer is yes. the MS<br>
102 resumes Normal operation and the method ends (step 206). jf the<br>
answer is no, the method determines whether an event (other then the timer<br>
expiring) has occurred to cause the MS 102 to cease reduced slotted mode<br>
operation (step 220). Such events can be, for example, the MS 102 befog put<br>
on the traffic channel,<br>
ln such a case, the MS 102 dears the reduced slotted timer (step<br>
222), resumes Normal operation (step 218), and the method ends at step<br>
206. 1f another event has not occurred to cause the MS 102 to cease<br>
reduced slotted mode operation, the method continues Iooping through steps<br>
213 and 220 until the timer expires or another event occurs to end reduced<br>
stotted mode operation. The embodiment of FIG. 2 illustrates one order in<br>
which the steps may be performed. A person of ordinary skilf in the art will<br>
recognize thet these steps, for example steps 216 and 220 may be performed<br>
in a different order or concurrently depending on the particular design or<br>
implementation chosen.<br>
Figure 3 is a flow diagram of the second embodiment of the method of<br>
the present invention. After detecting a predetermined period of inactivity on<br>
the traffic channel, the BS 108 releases the MS 102 from the traffic channel.<br>
The BS 108 includes in the release an indication of whether it supports<br>
reduced slotted mode. The method begins at step 302 when the MS 102<br>
receives a message from the BS 108 releasing the MS 102 from the traffic<br>
channel. The message "includes an indication of whether the BS 108<br>
supports, reduced statted mode. At step. 304, the MS 102 determine whether<br>
the BS 108 supports reduced slotted mode. If the answer is no, the MS 102<br>
releases the traffic channel and continues normal operation (step 306), At<br>
step 332, the method ends.<br>
Referring back to step 304, if the MS 102 deiermirtes thet the BS 108<br>
supports feduced soltted mods, the MS 102 determines whether the BS<br>
specffied a maximum reduced slotted timer value (step 312). If the answer is<br>
yes, the MS 102 sets the desired reduced slotted timer value to a value no<br>
greater then the maximum value specified by the BS 108 (step 314). If the<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 20004/075416	PCT/US 2004/005759<br>
answer is no, the MS (102) determines the desired reduced slotted timer<br>
value (step 316). Next, the MS 102 sends a reduced slotted mode request to<br>
the BS 108 and includes a desired SCI value and desired reduced slotted<br>
timer value (step 318), At step 320, the MS 102 releases the traffic channel<br>
and starts operating in reduced slotted mode with the reduced SCl At step<br>
324, the MS 102 monitors whether the reduced slotted timer has expired. If<br>
the answer is yes, the MS 102 resumes Normal operation and the method<br>
ends (step 332). If the answer is no, the: method determines whether a<br>
different event has occurred to cause the MS 102 to cease reduced slotted<br>
mode (step 326). in such a case, the MS 102 clears the reduced slotted<br>
timer (step 328), resumes Normal operation (step 330), and the method ends<br>
at step 332. 11 another event has not occurred to cause the MS 102 to cease<br>
slotted mode operation, the method continues looping through steps 324 and<br>
326 untii the timer expires or another event occurs to end reduced slotted<br>
mode operation. The embodiment of FIG. 3 illustrates one order in which the<br>
steps may be performed. A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize<br>
thet these steps, for example steps 324 and 326 may be perfomned in a<br>
different order or concurrently depending on the particular design or<br>
implementation chosen.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 illustrate embodiments of the method of the present<br>
invention from the BS 108 perspective. The method can run in any element<br>
of the BS 108 on any microprocessor or genenal purpose computer commonly<br>
known in the art. Referring to FIG. 4. a third embodiment of the method of<br>
the present invention is shown. in this embodiment, the BS 108 initiates<br>
communication with the MS 102, in particular, at step 402, the BS 108 sends<br>
a message to the MS 102 releasing the MS from the traffic channel. The<br>
message includes an indication thet the BS 108 supports reduced slotted<br>
mode and specifies a maximum reduced slotted timer value. At step 404, the<br>
BS 108 determines whether reduced slotted mode has teen requested,<br>
where the request inciudes a reduced SCI value and reduced slotted timer<br>
value. If the answer is no, the BS 106 continues Normal operation (step 406).<br>
At step 416, the method ends. If the answer is yes, the BS 108 determines<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 20004/075416	PCT/US 2004/005759<br>
whether the requested reduced slotted timer value i&amp; less then or equal to a<br>
maximum reduced slotted timer value specified by the BS 103 (step 405). If<br>
the answer is yes, the BS 108 initializes the reduced slotted timer to the<br>
requested slotted timer value (step 408), If the answer is no, the BS initiates<br>
the reduced slotted timer to the maximum reduced slotted timer value (step<br>
407). At step 410, the BS 103 begins reduced Slotted mode operation using<br>
the reduced SCI to page the MS 102 when a page request arrives.<br>
At step 412, the BS 106 monitors whether the reduced slotted timer<br>
has expired. If the answer is yes, the BS 108 resumes Normal operation<br>
(step 414), and the method ends (step 416). If the answer is TO, the method<br>
determines whether a different event has occurred to cause the BS 108 to<br>
cease reduced slotted mode (step 413), such as acquiring MS 102 on the<br>
Traffic Channel. in such a case, the BS 108 dears the reduced slotted timer<br>
(step 415), resumes Normal operation (step 414), and the method ends at<br>
step 416. If another event has not occurred to cause the BS 108 to cease<br>
slotted mode operation, the method continues looping through steps 412 and<br>
413 until the timer expires or another event occurs to end reduced slotted<br>
mode operation. The embodiment of FIG- 4 illustrates one order in which the<br>
steps may be performed. A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize<br>
thet these steps, for example steps 412 and 413 may be performed in a.<br>
different order or concurrently depending on the particular design or<br>
implementation chosen.<br>
in the embodiment of FIG. 4, the BS 108 may not specify a maximum<br>
reduced slatted timer value in step 402. in thet case, at step 404, the BS 108<br>
determines whether reduced slotted mode has been requested, where the<br>
request includes a reduced SCI value and reduced slotted timer value. The<br>
method continues at step 408 as previously described above.<br>
Referring now to FIG, 5, a fourth embodiment of the method of the<br>
present invention is shown. in this embodiment, the BS 108 responds to MS<br>
Initiated reduced slotted mode. At step 502, the BS 108 receives a message<br>
from the MS 102 requesting reduced slotted mode. The request includes a<br>
reduced SCI value and a reduced slotted timer value. At step 504, the BS<br><br>
WO 20004/075416	PCT/US 2004/005759<br>
108 determines whether the requested reduced slotted timer value is less<br>
then or equal to a maximum reduced slotted timer value (as determined by<br>
the BS 108). Following the "yes" path, the BS 106 initializes the reduced<br>
slotted timer to the requested reduced slotted timer (step 606), At step 508,<br>
the BS 108 sends a message to the MS 102 confirming support of reduced<br>
slotted mode. At step 510, the BS 108 begins reduced slotted mode<br>
operation using the requested reduced SCl to page the MS 102 when a page<br>
request arrives.<br>
At step 512, the BS 108 monitors whether the reduced slotted timer<br>
has expired, If the answer is yes, the BS 108 resumes normal op-aration<br>
(step 514), and the method ends (step 516), if the answer is no, the method<br>
determines whether a different event has occurred to cause the BS 108 to<br>
cease reduced slotted mode (step 513), such as acquiring MS 102 on the<br>
Traffic Channel, in such a Case, the BS 1GB dears the reduced slotted timer<br>
(slep 515), resumes Normal operation (slep 514), and the method ends at<br>
step 516. If another event has not occurred to cause the BS 103 to cease<br>
slotted mode operation, the method continues looping through steps 512 and<br>
513 until the timer expires or another event occurs to end reduced slotted<br>
mods operation. The embodiment of FIG, 5 illustrates one order in which the<br>
steps may be performed. A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize<br>
thet these steps, for example steps 512 and 513 may be performed in a<br>
different order or concurrency depending on the particular design or<br>
implementation chosen.<br>
Referring back to step 504 and following the "no" path, when the<br>
requested reduced slotted timer value is not less then or equal to the<br>
maximum reduced slotted timer value, the BS initializes the reduced slotted<br>
timer to the maximum reduce slotted timer value (step 520). At step 522,<br>
the BS 108 sends a message to the MS 102 confirming support of reduced<br>
slatted mode, wherein the confirmation specifies the maximum reduced<br>
slotted timer value. This informs the MS 102 thet the requested reduced<br>
slotted timer value was rejected by the BS 108 in favor of a lower value. After<br><br>
WO 20004/075416	PCT/US 2004/005759<br>
step 522, the method proceeds to step 510 to continua processing as<br>
previously described.<br>
The present indention is advantageous, Following the release of the<br>
traffic channel, the MS can operate with a shorter slot cycle for a specified<br>
period of time. The primary benefit of the invention is faster call setup for<br>
mobile station terminated calls, without requiring registration with the MSC to<br>
change the preferred slot cycle Index. This is particularly beneficial for packet<br>
data calls, where the mobile station may want to operate with a short slot<br>
cycle for a period of time of dormancy before reverting back to its normal (i.e.<br>
registered) slot cycle.<br>
While the Invention may be susceptible to various modifications and<br>
alternative forms, a specific embodiment has been shown by way of example<br>
in the drawings and has been described [n detail herein. However, it should<br>
be understood thet the invention is not intended to be limited to the particular<br>
forms disclosed. Rather, the invention is to cover all modification, equivalents<br>
