				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ORTHOGONAL CODE HOPPING MULTIPLEXING COMMUNICATIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for statistically multiplexing channels by using an orthogonal code hopping in a wire/wireless communications system where a plurality of the channels   synchronized  through  one  media and  having  a  low  data activity coexist.    More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus   and   a   method   in   which,   in   a   system   having   a   first communication   station   and   a   plurality   of  second   communication stations synchronized with the first communication station, the first communication   station   recognizes   a   channel   toward   each   second communication station with an orthogonal code hopping pattern, the orthogonal code hopping pattern of the second communication stations is  determined  at random,  orthogonal code symbols in  the  hopping patterns of different channels may coincide at an instance (hereinafter, the above coincidence of the orthogonal code symbols is referred as "hopping pattern collision"), the system inspects send data symbolsTor all send channels of the first communication station related with the collision and makes a corresponding data symbol interval OFF if any channel sends a data symbol not coincident with other channels, and<br><br>
transmission power of all channels where transmission of the data symbol is OFF as much as an amount and during an interval defined in a communication protocol in order to supplement average bit energy of loss data in all relevant channels.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Descriptions in this application are based on a wireless communication communications system, however the statistical multiplexing suggested in the application may be applied to a wire communications system as well as the wire communications system without any change.<br>
In order to point out clearly which parts or concepts are developed or improved in the present invention in comparison with the prior art, a prior art is described on basis of a communication communications system IS-95, which is already in service.<br>
The first communication station and the second communication in this application are corresponding to a base station and a mobile station in a conventional system. One first communication station communicates with a plurality of second communication stations and the present invention suggests a statistical multiplexing, which may be applied to a synchronized channel group having an orthogonality from the  first  communication  station   toward   the  second  communication<br><br>
stations.     For a system, which maintains the orthogonality only for each channel group, such as Quasi-Orthogonal Code(Q.OC) adapted to Code   Division   Multiplexing Access   (CDMA)   2000,   which   is   one   of candidate techniques for the next generation mobile communications"" system "the IMT-2000 (International Mobile Telecommunications-2000)", the   present  invention  may  be  independently  implemented   for  each channel   group.      Moreover,   when   classifying  channels   of the  first communication station such as sectored or smart antenna systems into channel  groups  having the  same  send  antenna  beam,   the  present invention may be independently implemented in each channel group.<br>
In the communications method by OCDM (Orthogonal Code Division Multiplexing) adapted by the conventional IS-95 system, the first communication station allocates orthogonal code symbols, which has not been allocated among the orthogonal codes when establishing a call, to one of the second communication stations and the second communication station gives back the allocated orthogonal code symbols to the first communication station when releasing the call such that other second communication stations may use the orthogonal code symbols.<br>
In description of the prior art, same reference number is used for a component having same function as that of the present invention.<br>
FIG,   1  shows a system according to both the prior art and the<br><br>
present invention. As shown in the figure, each communication channel 121, 122, 123 from the first communication station 101 to the second communication stations 111, 112, 113 is synchronized with maintaining orthogonality.<br>
FIG. 2a shows configurations of a transmitter of the first communication station, which corresponds to a common element of the prior art and embodiments of the present invention. FIG. 2b shows configurations of the transmitter of the first communication station for a traffic channel of the prior art.<br>
A pilot channel 200 is used as a reference signal for initial synchronous detection and tracking and synchronous decoding in the second communication station of FIG. 1. The pilot channel 200 is commonly used in all second communication stations in an area covered by the first communication station. The pilot channel 200 provides a phase reference for the synchronous decoding by transmitting symbols having a known pattern without passing through channel coding and channel interleaving as shown in FIG. 2a.<br>
A synchronous channel 210 is a broadcast channel which is one-sidedly transmitted to all second communication stations in an area covered by the first communication station, like the pilot channel 200. The first communication station transmits information (e.g. visual information, an identifier of the first communication station, etc.),<br><br>
which the second communication stations commonly require, to the second synchronous channel 210 through the synchronous channel 210. The data from the synchronous channel 210 pass through a convolutional encoder 214, a repeater 216 for adjusting a symbol rate, a block interleaver 218 for correcting an error burst and a repeater 219 for matching a send data symbol rate and are then transmitted to a spreading and modulating unit, shown in FIG. 3 and described below.<br>
A paging channel 220 is a common channel used in case of an incoming message to the second communication station or for answering to a request of the second communication station. A lot of the paging channels 220 can exist. The data transmitted to the paging channel pass through a convolutional encoder 224, a symbol repeater 226 and a block interleaver 228 and passes through an exclusive OR gate 236 together with an output of a long code generator 232 generated by a long code mask 230. The data through the exclusive OR gate 236 is then transmitted to the spreading and modulating unit of FIG. 3.<br>
A traffic channel 240 in FIG. 2b is a channel dedicatedly allocated to each second communication station for use until the call is completed. When there are /data to be transmitted to each second communication station, the first communication station transmits the data through the traffic channel 240. The data from the traffic channel 240 passes through a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) 241 for inspecting<br><br>
an error in a specific time unit, or frame, (e.g. 20ms in IS-95).   Tail bits 242 are inserted into the traffic channel, all of which are "0", and the data through the CRC 241 pass through a convolutional encoder 244 for ensuring to independently encoding the channel in a frame unit. The  data  then  pass  through  a  symbol  repeater  246  for  matching transmission data symbol rate according to a send data rate.    After passing through the symbol repeater 246,  the data pass through a block interleaver 248 for changing an error burst into a random error. The data passing through the block interleaver 248 are scrambled in a scrambler 256 with use of a pseudo-noise (PN) sequence, generated by passing  an  output  of a  long  code  generator  232  decimated   in   a decimator 234 with use of a long code mask 250 generated by an electronic serial number (ESN) allocated to each second communication station.    A PCB (page control block) position extractor 258 extracts a position where a command for controlling transmission power from the second   communication   station    is    inserted    in    the   PN    sequence decimated in the decimator 234.    A punch and insert 260 punches a data symbol corresponding to the insert position of the power control command extracted by the PCB position extractor 258 among the data symbols scrambled in the scrambler 256 and inserts the power control command,   then   transmitting   the   power   control   command   to   the spreading and modulating unit in FIG. 3.<br><br>
FIGs. 3a, 3b and 3c show an embodiment of a spreading and modulating unit according to the prior art.<br>
FIG. 3a corresponds to the commonly used IS-95 method employing BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) as a data modulating method. FIG. 3b shows the spreading and modulating unit employing QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) as a data modulating method for transmitting double data in comparison the method in FIG. 3a.<br>
FIG.  3b is adapted the CDMA 2000 method, which is one of candidate techniques for the IMT-2000.    FIG.  3c shows a spreading and modulating unit, which employs QOC  (Quasi-Orthogonal Code) used in CDMA 2000, which is one of candidate techniques for the IMT-2000. In FIG. 3, signal converters 310, 326, 330, 346, 364 convert logic signals "0" and "1" into physical signal "+1" and "-1" to be really transmitted.      Each  channel  of FIG.   2   passes   through   the   signal converters and is then spread in spreaders 312, 332 by an output of a Walsh code generator 362.    Transmission power of each channel is adjusted in amplifiers 314, 334. All channels of the first communication station  are   spread  in  spreaders  314,   334   by an  orthogonal  Walsh function of the Walsh co'de ^generator 362 allocated to each channel fixedly.    The channels are then amplified in the amplifiers 314, 334 and then pass through QPSK spreading and modulating units 318, 338. Signals spread and modulated in the QPSK spreading and modulating<br><br>
units 318, 338 are multiplied by a carrier in multipliers 322, 342 to transit to a sending band through low-pass filters (LPF) 320, 340. The signal multiplied by the carrier passes through a radio communication unit and is then transmitted through an antenna, not shown in the figures.<br>
FIG. 3b is identical to FIG. 3a except the fact that, in order to transmit the signal generated in FIG. 2 to QPSK instead of BPSK, different information data are carried in an in-phase channel and a quadrature phase channel through a demultiplexer 390. Using the | demultiplexer 390 and the signal converters 310, 330 enables QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) as well as QPSK.<br>
FIG. 3c shows the case that a QOC mask is used for distinguishing a channel from the first communication station to the second communication stations. Orthogonality is not maintained in a code symbol group using different QOC masks but maintained in a code symbol group using same QOC mask. Therefore, the present invention is applied to the orthogonal code symbol group using same QOC mask, which may maintain the orthogonality.<br>
FIGs. 4a, 4b and 4-c shows signals used in the code division multiplexing, which spreads the signal generated in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 into the orthogonal code symbol fixedly allocated to each channel, according, to the prior art.    A pilot channel 410 is spread by a fixedly<br><br>
allocated orthogonal Walsh code symbol W#0 in a spreader 412. Other channels are also spread by orthogonal Walsh code symbols W#l, W#2, .... W#29, W#30, .... W#63 fixedly allocated regardless of activities of the corresponding channels. If allocating the orthogonal code symbol fixedly to a channel such as channels 440, 450, 460 having relatively low transmission data activity, utilization of the orthogonal code, which is a limited source, is much less than 100%.<br>
FIG. 4b shows how a despreading data symbol is spread by the orthogonal code. In reference numbers 471 to 477, white areas mean "0[+l]" and black areas mean "1[-1]", for the Walsh code as an example of the orthogonal code.<br>
FIG. 4c shows that the orthogonal code symbols are allocated to each channel in OCDM.<br>
FIG. 5 briefly shows a configuration of a receiver of the second communication station corresponding to the transmitter of the first communication station according to the prior art. As shown in the figure, the signal received through the antenna passes through multipliers 510, 530 for multiplying the signal with a carrier, low pass filters (LPFs) 512, 532 for generating a baseband signal and short code generators 520, 540 for synchronizing the signal with a sequence same as the PN sequence used in the transmitter. The signal then passes through multipliers 514, 534 for multiplying the signal by the received<br><br>
baseband signal and then despreaders 516, 536 for accumulating the signals during a transmission data symbol area. A channel estimator 550 estimates a transmission channel by extracting only pilot channel components from the baseband signal as the orthogonal code symbol allocated to the pilot channel. A phase recovery 560 compensates phase distortion of the baseband signal with use of an estimated phase distortion value.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a configuration of a receiver for a channel in which a control command for controlling transmission power from the second communication station to the first communication station like the paging channel is not inserted. Referring to the figure, maximum ratio combiners 610, 612 combine signals passing through the phase compensation to a maximum ratio. If the receiver performs QPSK data modulation as shown in FIG. 3b, the receiver performs descrambling by multiplexing the signal in a multiplexer 614, performing soft decision in a soft decision unit 616, then decimating an output of a long code generator 622 generated by a long code mask 620 in a decimator 624, and then multiplying the signal through the soft decision unit with a decimated result of the decimator 624. In the present invention, a configuration of a receiver in the second communication station for the orthogonal code hopping multiplexing is similar to the configuration in FIG. 6.    For the synchronous channel, the descrambling processes 620,<br><br>
622, 624, 626, 628 using the long code may be skipped.<br>
FIG. 7 shows a configuration of a receiver to which a control command    for    controlling    transmission    power    from    the    second communication   station   to   the   first  communication   station   like   the traffic channel.   As shown in the figure, the signal enduring the phase compensation in FIG. 5 passes through maximum ratio combiners 710, 712.    In case that a receiver performs QPSK data modulation as shown in FIG. 5, a multiplexer 714 multiplexes a in-phase component and an orthogonal phase component in the signal.    An extractor 740 extracts a signal   component   corresponding   to   the   power   control   command transmitted from the first communication station among the received signal.    The signal from the extractor 740 then passes through a hard decision  unit 744 and is then transmitted to a transmission power controller of the second communication station.    Data symbols except the power control command in the received signal from the multiplexer 714 pass through a soft decision unit 742.    A decimator 724 decimates an output of a long code generator 722 generated by a long code mask 720 generated by an identifier of the second communication station. The data symbols from the soft decision unit 742 is then multiplied in a multiplier   718   by   a   result   of  the   decimator   724,   so   to   perform descrambling.<br>
FIG.- 8 shows a function of recovering the received signal through<br><br>
the signal processes of FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 from the first communication station, through block deinterleavers 818, 828, 838 and convolutional decoders 814, 824, 834.    In a synchronous channel 810, in order to lower a symbol rate, a sampler 819 performs symbol compression for the signals through the soft decision unit by accumulating the signals, which is an inverse process to the symbol repeater 219.    The signal through the sampler 819 passes through a block deinterleaver 818. Then, a sampler 816 performs symbol compression again for the signal, which is an inverse process to the symbol repeater 216,  before the signal  passes  to  a  convolutional  decoder  814.     The  signal  passing enduring    the     symbol    compression     then     passes     through     the convolutional decoder 814, then recovering the synchronous channel transmitted from the first communication station.<br>
In case of a paging channel 820, the signal enduring the soft decision passes through a block deinterleaver 828 for channel interleaving. The signal enduring the channel interleaving passes through a sampler 826 for symbol compression according to the send data rate, which is an inverse process of the symbol repeater 226. The signal enduring the symbol compression passes through a convolution decoder 824 for channel decoding, so recovering the paging channel transmitted from the first communication station.<br>
In case of a traffic channel 830,  the signal enduring the soft<br><br>
decision   passes   through   a   block   deinterleaver   838   for  performing channel deinterleaving regardless of a  send  data rate.     The  signal enduring the channel interleaving passes through a sampler 836 for performing symbol compression according to the send data rate, which is an  inverse process  to  the  symbol repeater 246.     A convolutional decoder 834 performs channel decoding for the signal enduring the symbol compression.    A tail bit remover 832 removes tail bits of the signal used for independent send signal generation in a frame unit.    A CRC   831   generates  a  CRC  bit  for  the   send  data  portion  like   the transmitter and inspects errors by comparison with a recovered CRC after channel decoding.    If the two CRC bits coincides, the CRC 831 determines that there is no error and then the traffic channel dataware,, recovered.   -If the transmitter does not include information about the send data rate in 20ms frame unit, the send data rate of the first communication station may be determined by channel-decoding the signals    enduring    the     independent    channel    deinterleaving    and comparing the CRC bits.    A system, which transmits a send data rate independently,   just   further   requires   a   channel   decoding   process corresponding to~the data rater<br>
In case of spreading the despreading data symbol by fixedly using the orthogonal code allocated when establishing a call as shown in FIG. 3 in order to maintain orthogonality between channels from the first<br><br>
communication station to the second communication station as shown in FIG.  1, the orthogonal code, limited source, may not be efficiently used for send data having relatively low activity such as data indicated by  reference  numbers  440,   450  and  460  in  FIG.   4a.     In  order  to increase  activity of the  orthogonal code with fixed  allocation,  rapid channel allocation and return are required.    However, if transmitting the control signal information for channel allocation and return more frequently,  more  significant amounts of limited  frequency  resources should be used for the control information of data transmission, not for data   transmission   itself.       Moreover,   however   rapid   the   channel allocation and return are processed, there should be a buffering process after the data to be transmitted reaches at the first communication station till transmitted in order to transmit a channel allocation (or return)   message   and   respond   to   the   message.     As   time  for   such processes   is   extended,   more   capacity   is   required   in   the   buffer. Information,   which   requires   checking   whether   the   information   is transmitted normally, should be buffered for retransmission.    However, in    case    of    transmitting    information    without    checking    normal transmission of the information,  such as, in a datagram method, a delay should be minimized in an allowable range in order to decrease the capacity of the buffer.<br>
Therefore, while the prior art allocates the orthogonal codes in a<br>
fixed manner so to have 1:1 relation between the orthogonal code and the channel, the present invention, with a little modification of the prior art, performs statistical multiplexing for traffic channels having low activities in consideration of activity of the send data in order to increase activities of the orthogonal codes, which are limited resources, and eliminates unnecessary channel allocating and returning processes in order to decrease buffer capacity and data transmission delay.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is designed to overcome the above problems of the prior art. An object of the invention is to decrease waste of resources caused by transmission of unnecessary control signals, minimize a required capacity of a buffer in a first communication station used for time division multiplexing and reduce a data transmission delay by means of utilizing the limited resources efficiently with use of a statistical multiplexing method, namely orthogonal code hopping multiplexing, when synchronized channels maintaining orthogonality have low activities, and performing spreading or despreading according to a hopping pattern of each transmitter and receiver by skipping unnecessary channel allocating and returning processes.<br>
In order to accomplish the above object, the present invention<br>
provides a method for orthogonal code hopping multiplexing communications in a band spreading communications system, which performs statistical multiplexing for communication channels from a first communication station to second communication stations by orthogonal code hopping multiplexing communications.<br>
The channels from the first communication station to a plurality of the second communication stations may be synchronized to distinguish the channels by using orthogonality.<br>
The method may include a further step of distinguishing the channels from the first communication station to the second communication stations with use of orthogonal code hopping patterns.<br>
The orthogonal code may be a Hadamard code, a variable spreading factor code or a gold code.<br>
The method may include a further step of allocating the orthogonal code hopping pattern to the second communication stations dedicatedly.<br>
It is preferred that the orthogonal code hopping pattern is allocated to the second communication stations from the first communication station when starting communication, and the second communication stations give back the orthogonal code hopping pattern when the communication is completed.<br>
The . method   may   include   a   further   step   of   performing   the<br>
The orthogonal code hopping patterns may hop not to generate collision each other in the orthogonal code hopping multiplexing communications and may be periodically repeated in a frame unit.<br>
The frame unit is an independent data unit based on channel encoding.<br>
The first communication station may detect a hopping pattern collision caused by the random orthogonal code hopping patterns in advance in order not to transmit a corresponding despreading data symbol.<br>
The method may include a further step of comparing despreading data symbols at time of a hopping pattern collision caused by the random orthogonal code hopping patterns in order to transmit the data symbols in case that all of the data symbols are same.<br>
The method may include a further step of comparing despreading data symbols at time of a hopping pattern collision caused by the random orthogonal code hopping patterns in order not to transmit the data symbols in case that the data symbols are not same.<br>
The method may include a further step of increasing transmission power of a data symbol nepct to the data symbols, which are not transmitted because of discordance of the despreading data symbols at time of the hopping pattern collision.<br>
It is also preferred that the transmission power is increased as<br>
orthogonal   code   hopping   multiplexing   for   a   channel   among   the channels, which has a low transmission data activity.<br>
The method may include a further step of transmitting a command for controlling transmission power of the second communication stations with use of a separate common power control channel of the first communication station.<br>
The transmission power control command of each second communication station in the common power control channel can be time-multiplexed and may employ a collision-resistant hopping pattern for preventing collision of the hopping pattern.<br>
The collision-resistant hopping pattern may include a fixed orthogonal code symbol allocation like a code division multiplexing.<br>
The orthogonal code hopping patterns for the statistical multiplexing may be generated at random or with use of a pseudo-noise sequence generator.<br>
A plurality of the orthogonal code hopping patterns for the statistical multiplexing are allocable to one of the second communication stations according to a send data rate of the first communication station.<br>
Each of the orthogonal code hopping patterns may hop independently in the orthogonal code hopping multiplexing communications.<br><br>
much as an amount given by a system parameter during a period given by a system parameter.<br>
The two system parameters may be position functions of the not-transmitted despreading data symbols and preferably at least 0.<br>
Preferably, the hopping pattern collision is prevented only when there is a possibility that sending antenna beams of the first communication station, where the hopping patterns are collided, are superposed so to cause a serious error in a channel decoding process of the second communication station.<br>
A pilot signal can be used for initial synchronous gain and tracking of the channels and synchronous decoding of the channels owing to phase distortion compensation.<br>

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In this application, similar reference numbers are used for components similar to the prior art and only modified or added components in comparison with the prior art are described for the present invention in detail.<br>
FIG. 9 is a modified one of the traffic channel of the prior art for performing orthogonal code hopping multiplexing in case of having a low send data activity, which is identical to the prior art except that a transmission power control command for the second communication station is inserted. Communication is divided into bi-directional communication and one-directional communication, in which the one-directional communication does not need the transmission power<br>
control command for the second communication station.<br>
However,    in   case   of   the    bi-directional   communication,    the transmission power control command is required in order to maximize system  capacity  through  effective  power control.     For  improving  a processing rate, the power control command does not endure channel coding in  most cases.     A random  orthogonal code  hopping pattern inevitably causes collisions between each other channels.    Therefore, it is required to transmit the power control command to a channel in which a collision is generated.    In this point, a concept of a common power  control   channel   adapted   in   CDMA   2000,   which   is   one   of candidate  techniques  for the  IMT-2000,  may  be  introduced.     The common power control channel is spread by a separate orthogonal code symbol such as the pilot channel and transmitted by the time division multiplexing for a plurality of the second communication stations.   A position of the power control command for each second communication station is allocated in a call establishing process.    FIG. 9 shows an embodiment of the common power control channel for controlling 24 second communication stations.<br>
FIGs. 10a, 10b and' 10c show embodiments to which characteristics of the present invention are applied to the prior art shown in FIGs. 3a, 3b and 3c. For statistical multiplexing by the orthogonal    code   hopping   multiplexing   suggested    in    the    present<br>
invention, required are an orthogonal code hopping pattern generator 380 and collision comparator &amp; controller 384, 386 for suitable control by detecting collisions of the orthogonal code symbols generated by the random hopping pattern generation.     An  example of the orthogonal code  hopping pattern  generator is  shown  in FIG.   11,  which  has  a configuration for generating the hopping pattern with use of a general PN sequence generator.    There is required an orthogonal code generator 382 for generating a spreading orthogonal code symbol according to the hopping pattern generator 380.    The orthogonal code generated in the 
When an output of the orthogonal code hopping pattern generator 380 is constant, the present invention equals to the orthogonal code division multiplexing identical to the prior art. That is, the orthogonal code division multiplexing of the prior art is a subset of the orthogonal code hopping multiplexing of the present invention. Therefore, after dividing one orthogonal code into two orthogonal code symbol groups, one orthogonal code group is used for an orthogonal code hopping<br>
multiplexing using fixed allocation and the other orthogonal code group is used for an orthogonal code hopping multiplexing using a hopping pattern.<br>
Or else, one orthogonal code symbol group among the two divided orthogonal code symbols performs the orthogonal code hopping multiplexing with use of a hopping pattern intentionally selected to prevent collision of the hopping patterns, while the other orthogonal code symbol group performs the orthogonal code hopping multiplexing by the statistical multiplexing with use of a hopping selected randomly in which a collision between the hopping patterns may happen.<br>
In the two cases, it is preferred that the former is allocated to a channel having a relatively high send data activity and the later is allocated to a channel having a relatively low send data activity. In case of using a hierarchical orthogonal code supporting a variable spreading gain as a spreading code as shown in FIG. 12a, it is preferred to divide the orthogonal code into orthogonal code symbol groups 393, 397 consisting of all child code symbols having same parent code symbol 391, 395 such as "01" or "0110" because it may support the variable spreading gain. As described above in brief, if the orthogonal code hopping pattern generator intentionally generates the orthogonal code hopping patterns not to select different channels at same orthogonal code symbol in the same instant, no collision generates.<br>
However,   such   method   has   disadvantages   that   the   hopping pattern  should  be  allocated  by  the  first  communication  station   in establishing a call and that number of the hopping patterns allocated by the first communication station is limited by a size of the orthogonal code.    In this case, because the statistical multiplexing according to the data activity of each channel  is  not possible,  hopping patterns are allocated to each channel independently and at random.    In this reason, orthogonal  code   patterns,   which   select  the   same  orthogonal   code symbol at the same instant, make a collision inevitably.    Therefore, the present   invention   receives   hopping   patterns   of each   channel   and despreading data symbols to be transmitted and determines whether the hopping patterns collide with use of the collision comparator &amp; controller 384, 386 for overcoming such problems.    Besides that, the present invention compares whether the despreading data symbols of all channels corresponding to the collisions are all same.<br>
In case that all despreading data symbols match, the data symbols in the collision area are spread and transmitted. It is because the data symbol may cause an error in the channel decoding process. However, if there is one data symbol not matched, the data symbol in the collision area of the corresponding channel is not transmitted. That is, according to a result of the collision comparator &amp; controller 384, 386, an input of the multipliers 385, 387 becomes "+1" or "0".    In<br>
the area that the input of the multiplier is "0", the transmission is stopped.<br>
In order to compensate deficiency of an average receiving energy in the second communication station due to transmission stop of the despreading data symbol for satisfied quality, a gain of amplifiers 315, 335 of the corresponding channel is adjusted as much as a size given by a system parameter during an area given by a system parameter like the reference numbers 1072, 1074 in FIG. 14h, then increasing the transmission power of the first communication station. Regardless of the above process, the transmission power control for the first communication station is performed according to the method of the prior art.<br>
FIGs. 14a to 14h show concepts of a send signal of the first communication station according to the present invention. FIG. 14a shows a send signal in case of performing the code division multiplexing by fixedly allocating the orthogonal code symbols to a channel which transmits data having a relatively high activity. FIG. 14b shows a send signal in case of performing the orthogonal code hopping multiplexing to select a spreading orthogonal code symbol according to hopping patterns H][n], H2[n], H3[n], ..., Hivifn] for a channel which transmits data having a relatively low activity. The number of the hopping patterns may be over a size of the orthogonal code.     Because the<br><br>
hopping patterns may cause collision when generating the hopping patterns at random, it is preferred that the orthogonal code symbols are fixedly allocated as designated by a reference number 912 to a pilot channel 910 used as a phase reference for the synchronous demodulation and a channel not enduring channel coding such as the common power control channel of FIG. 9, while the orthogonal code hopping multiplexing is performed with use of remained orthogonal code symbols.<br>
It is also preferred to use the statistical multiplexing by the orthogonal code hopping multiplexing in a data area and not to use the orthogonal code hopping multiplexing in a pilot area not only when the pilot channel exists in the code division multiplexing method but also when performing the time division multiplexing for the pilot signal like W-CDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access), another candidate technique of the IMT-200 system. In the send data area, the orthogonal code symbol used in the pilot area may be also used.<br>
If the send antenna beams from the first communication station are different according to positions of the second communication stations such as smart antenna, the pilot signals are separately managed for each antenna beam. In addition, in an asynchronous modulation/demodulation system, which does not use the pilot signal and  does  not require  the  pilot signal,  the  orthogonal code  hopping<br><br>
multiplexing is performed with use of all orthogonal code symbols in the orthogonal code.<br>
FIG. 14c shows an example of the orthogonal code symbol used for spreading the despreading data symbol according to the present invention. As shown in the figure, it will be easily known that a symbol of this embodiment has no difference from the prior art in FIG. 4b except the case that a different orthogonal code is used.<br>
FIG. 14d shows a case of fixedly allocating the orthogonal code symbols to each channel having a high send data activity similar to the prior art.<br>
FIG.    14e   shows   the   orthogonal   code   hopping   multiplexing according to the present invention, in which the hopping channels in each channel 1011, 1012, 1013, 1014, 1015, 1016, 1017 do not collide in all symbol areas 1021, 1022, 1023, 1024, 1025, 1026, 1027, 1028. However,    in    case    of   performing    the    orthogonal    code    hopping multiplexing as shown in FIG.  14h, it can be seen that the hopping patterns collide in the symbol areas 1041, 1043, 1046.    In a time area 1041, the hopping patterns collide but the despreading data symbols coincide  (shown with double-dine box).    Time areas  1043,   1046 is a case that the despreading data symbols do not coincide.    Through the hopping patterns collide in the time areas 1043, 1046 as shown in FIG. 14g.    however, in the case of time area  1061 where the send data<br><br>
symbols coincide, corresponding despreading data symbols are spread and transmitted, while in the case of time areas 1063, 1066 where the send data symbols do not coincide, transmission of all relevant channel is stopped.<br>
Such channel stop is carried out for the channel group existing in same send antenna beam from the first communication station. In case that a plurality of send antenna beams 1120, 1130, 1140 from the first communication station such as a smart antenna exist, the transmission is not stopped for channels 1132, 1142, 1144 in non-overlapped send antenna beams 1130, 1140 though the hopping patterns collide.<br>
FIG. 14h shows the process of increasing transmission power as much as a regulated amount during a regulated time in order to satisfy an average receiving signal energy in the second communication station required for communication quality after an area where the transmission is stopped due to collision of the hopping patterns and discordance of the despreading data symbols as described above in brief, similar to FIG. 14g.<br>
As described in embodiments of the present invention, if performing the orthogonal code hopping multiplexing with random hopping patterns, the send data may be intentionally lost in an area where the hopping patterns collide.   Therefore, in order to recover the<br><br>
data existing in the loss area in the receiver, it is essential that the transmitter performs the channel encoding and the receiver performs the channel decoding.<br>
The statistical multiplexing of the present invention may be used in combination with other multiplexing methods such as a time division multiplexing, a frequenc}' division multiplexing, a space division multiplexing, etc.<br>
In addition, as a development of the orthogonal code division multiplexing system using a multi-code method, a plurality of channels<br>
i<br>
may be allocated to one second communication station with use of a plurality of hopping patterns, which may realize a rapid send data rate. At this time, in allocating the multiple hopping patterns, the hopping patterns of each channel are generated as described above.<br>
As described above, the present invention employs the statistical multiplexing method, namely the orthogonal code hopping multiplexing, in case that synchronized channels maintaining orthogonality have low activities, which may enable to use limited resources efficiently and increase less complexity than the prior art. The receiver particularly needs no increase of hardware except the orthogonal code hopping pattern generator. In addition, because the receiver and the transmitter perform spreading and despreading according to the respective- hopping patterns without any process for excessive channel<br><br>
allocation or return for a traffic having a low activity from the first communication station to the second communication, the present invention may decrease waste of resources due to, such as, unnecessary control signal transmission and reduce buffer capacity and data transmission delay caused by scheduling of the send data of the first communication.<br>
Moreover, the present invention may distinguish nearly unlimited number of channels (if the hopping pattern has a period in a frame unit, near 6419-2ksPs"20ms = 64384 of channels on basis of IS-95 system) when selecting the hopping patterns at random in comparison to the method of    allocating    the    spreading    orthogonal    code    symbols    fixedly. Furthermore,   though   there  occurs  collision   between  the  spreading orthogonal code symbols due to the random selection of the hopping patterns,   there   is   no   need   to   stop   transmission   of  the   colliding despreading  data  symbol  in  case  that  the   second  communication station exists in an area where send antenna beams of, such as, a sectored antenna and a smart antenna are not overlapped.    In addition, the data symbols, which is not transmitted due to the hopping pattern collision   between   channels   in   same   send   antenna   beam,   may   be recovered     in     the     channel     decoding     process     of    the     second communication station without informing to the second communication station.<br>
The concept of the present invention may be applied to each carrier code group and each quasi-orthogonal code group in systems using a multiple carrier transmission method, a quasi-orthogonal code, etc. to realize the statistical multiplexing.<br><br><br>
