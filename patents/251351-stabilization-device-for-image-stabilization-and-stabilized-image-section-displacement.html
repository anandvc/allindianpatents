				<td>Description<br>
The invention provides a stabilization device for image capture apparatus or systems, for example a film camera, binoculars, a photo camera etc., which enables the user to stabilize an image and/or stabilize the motion path of the image and optionally also to stabilize the sequence of a preprogrammed motion path.<br>
Prior art<br>
In the case of a multiplicity of image capture apparatus it is expedient to suppress as far as possible both blurriness in the case of individual pictures and also undesired displacements of individual frames of an image sequence or an unevenness of an image motion path during panning. This applies particularly to hand-held image capture apparatus, which capture an image sequence, for example film cameras and binoculars.<br>
In prior art various solutions in this regard are already known.<br>
Thus for film shots tripods are used above all, since to date only these satisfy professional requirements for blur-free<br>
images. The disadvantage of these lies in their size and weight. Therefore stabilization systems have already for many years been incorporated into image capture apparatus, particularly binoculars and video cameras.<br>
Therefore there are stabilization systems integrated into the lenses of image capture apparatus or placed thereon, which by means of controllable optical elements can shift the image therein, projected in the focal plane. Mirrors, variable prisms or lenses, which can move laterally to the optical axis are employed as controllable optical elements. Their displacement is controlled by a movement sensor such that image shifts caused by trembling of the image capture apparatus are compensated. These systems have the advantage that they can also be used for film cameras, which record on chemical film.<br>
In addition for image capture apparatus with electronic capture sensors, such as video cameras for example, there are image stabilization systems, which can select the image section to be utilized. This image section and/or the whole capture sensor is shifted by a movement sensor such that the image shifts, caused by trembling of the image capture apparatus, are followed as exactly as possible in the sensor plane.<br>
These optical and electronic stabilization systems essentially work on the same control principle. A desired target alignment or target alignment sequence of the image capture apparatus and thus a desired image section or image section sequence is compared with the real particular actual alignment of the image capture apparatus and an alignment difference is determined thereby. Solutions of the most varied kind, which for example use acceleration sensors, gyroscopic systems,<br>
angular measuring devices etc. are already known for technically executing such determination of the alignment difference. Any deviation from the desired image detail caused by a particular alignment difference is compensated by one of the compensation devices described above.<br>
Both optical and electronic stabilization systems suppress very well any undesired high frequency alignment differences according to this control arrangement. However this does not apply, due to reasons of principle, for low-frequency alignment differences, which are caused particularly by the user through his unavoidable, slow swaying movements, whenever for example he is holding a film camera or binoculars by hand. These slow movements cannot be compensated, at least above a certain limit, since otherwise it would not be possible to carry out image section displacements during an intended panning movement of the image capture apparatus. Conventional stabilization systems do not have the facility of clearly differentiating whether a slow movement of the image capture apparatus beyond a certain limit is undesired or intended.<br>
None of the systems known to date can meet all requirements of an ideal stabilization system. A tripod only results in perfectly blur-free image detail with a stable base, whereas perfect, even panning can only be achieved with great difficulty, since the panning speed in practice depends on the amount of pressure on the panning lever and whereas the operator gets no feedback as to whether he possibly is exceeding the allowable maximum panning speed. The known optical and electronic stabilization systems only suppress undesired high-frequency trembling very well, but they cannot achieve a completely motionless and blur-free image sequence or stabilization of a motion path, which for example is necessary in the case of horizontal panning.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
An object of the present invention therefore consists above all in creating a stabilization device, with which a completely motionless, blur-free image sequence of arbitrary duration without undesired jitter and swaying movements and/or a completely even image shift movement, for example when panning using hand-held image capture apparatus is made possible, whereby the user has control of whether, when and how an image section ought to be shifted.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
By providing a communication device in accordance with Claim 1 the alignment difference between the actual alignment and target alignment can be held for example in the proximity of the alignment difference value zero by the user orientating the image capture apparatus. Thus an undesired and unnoticed, due to the stabilized image, slow deviation of the alignment difference further and further from zero, can be avoided. In the case of conventional stabilization devices the user cannot recognize this alignment difference and make corresponding corrections in the alignment of the image capture apparatus. The consequence of this was that when a certain positional difference was exceeded, image shift was inevitable, since the stabilization device had to interpret such an alignment difference as desired displacement of the image section.<br>
In one embodiment, such a stabilization device includes (a) a controller that determines an alignment difference between an actual alignment of the image capture system and a target alignment of the image capture system, and a compensation device that compensates for the alignment difference on a<br>
rojected image section. A communication device, such as a display, then communicates the alignment difference with respect to pre-definable alignment difference values or ranges of values, such that a user is able, by adjusting the orientation of the image capture system, to steer the alignment difference to a pre-determined value or into a predetermined range of values.<br>
In addition the amplitude of the inadvertent slow fluctuations of the alignment difference can be limited to lesser values according to the invention due to feedback through the communication device to the user, than would otherwise be the case without this feedback. In this way the efficiency of conventional stabilization devices as such can be substantially improved. Furthermore stabilization devices with a reduced stabilization range compared to conventional solutions can also be used.<br>
The deviation of the alignment difference in relation to a pre-determined value or range of values can be communicated in various ways, also acoustically for example. Preferably however, the communication device consists of an optical display.<br>
Thus the deviation of the alignment difference from zero or from the limits of an alignment difference range can be communicated for example by means of arrows arranged on the side of the viewfinder. The amount of deviation for example can be indicated by the brightness and/or colour and/or flash frequency of the arrows. This type of display has the advantage that it does not conceal the viewfinder image, as is desirable with binoculars in particular.<br>
Advantageously the display, in particular in the case of film cameras, is implemented in a graphic way by means of an electronic display, which is overlaid onto the viewfinder image. The graphic display has the advantage that the user can simply control an alignment difference more precisely and that several types of alignment differences can be clearly displayed with their pre-definable alignment difference values or ranges of values, as is desirable for professional applications of the invention. In particular at least one function is assigned to at least one range of difference values for influencing the target image position or for other control purposes.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the invention are described in the dependent claims.<br>
In accordance with one preferred embodiment of the stabilization device parameters defining the target image section, such as target alignment of the optical axis and its target movement etc., can be specified via algorithms, which for the most important stabilization functions, for instance image freeze, even movement, acceleration and deceleration while panning, are preferably totally independent of the alignment difference, provided the alignment differences lie within a pre-definable alignment difference range assigned to the respective function.<br>
It shall be noted that when using the term "pre-definable" as well as the terms "preset" and "predetermined" in the context of this specification, the scope of these terms is meant to include "fixedly set", "variably settable", "automatically settable", and "user induced". Thus, these terms also include the possibility that an alignment difference range be kept fixed during operation, as chosen by the user or<br>
automatically, or the alignment difference range being subject to variations or modifications during use, again either automatically or user induced.<br>
There may also be functions and alignment difference ranges assigned thereto, for which the alignment difference values should be included in the pre-determined target alignment, such as for example the function of shifting the image section anlogue to the alignment of the image capture apparatus.<br>
In addition it is shown as advantageous to pre-set the alignment difference range assigned to a function greater than the extent of the alignment difference fluctuation amplitude or disturbance values caused by the user due to his trembling and swaying. Thus a alignment difference range assigned to the "image freeze" function for example can be +-2 degrees in each direction relative to the target alignment of the optical axis of the image capture apparatus, which is somewhat greater than a typical alignment difference fluctuation amplitude of the optical axis caused by the user.<br>
The user can now intentionally produce an image section freeze by steering the alignment difference through corresponding alignment of the image capture apparatus into this range assigned to the "image freeze" function and holding it there, which he can easily do for any arbitrary duration due to feedback via the communication device and the amount of the alignment difference range for image freeze. The target alignment data, for example the target alignment data of the optical axis, are kept constant even if the alignment differences vary for example within + - 1 degree due to trembling or swaying of the user. Since in addition as suggested the effect of any alignment difference on the projected image section is constantly fully compensated,<br>
independent of frequency/ by a compensation device, if at all technically feasible, the affect of undesired fluctuation of the structural optical axis on an image freeze is totally eliminated for example. Therefore the most important object of a stabilization device is achieved (see also flow chart in Pig. 3)<br>
If the image section has to be shifted, the user steers the alignment difference value out of the range reserved for "image freeze" and into a alignment difference range for example provided for analogue displacement of the image section, as described below.<br>
In accordance with a further preferred embodiment of the stabilization device according to the invention for professional film cameras for example, several types of alignment differences are considered at the same time. It is advantageous in this case when using the principles according to the invention described above that an image section totally unaffected by all inadvertent movements in any direction can be obtained. The additional technical complexity is relatively minor in comparison to the minimum cost.<br>
For this purpose not only the directional alignment difference of the structural optical axis to a target alignment, but also the positional difference of a point of reference of the image capture apparatus to a target position is determined and preferably also the horizon difference of the image capture apparatus to a target horizon position. The advantage of stabilizing the image horizon is particularly valid in the case of film shots. The advantage, provided by taking into consideration the positional difference, lies in particular in the fact that shots with extreme tele focal lengths can also be stabilized: for example if the captured image section is<br>
only 20 cm wide and the image capture apparatus sways by 1 cm to the side, then the image section inadvertently shifts by as much as 5% of the image width. The point of reference difference is preferably determined only in the plane perpendicular to the alignment of the optical axis, since undesired displacements of the image capture apparatus along the optical axis only result with extreme close-ups of the captured image section.<br>
Expediently the compensation device is able as far as possible to completely compensate, independent of frequency, the effects of any of the types of alignment differences determined on the captured image section. For compensating the positional difference preferably an approximation solution is used, whereby an angle, which is added to the value of the directional alignment difference determined so that the compensation device only has to compensate two types of alignment differences, is computed from the value of the point of reference difference and the momentary distance adjustment of the lens. The angle results from W = arctan [point of reference difference/distance]. In order to compensate the horizon difference, if present, preferably the whole electronic image sensor is rotated or electronics for rotating the evaluated image section on the image sensor are used.<br>
For each of the three types of alignment differences their alignment difference total value, which can be compensated by the compensation device, is preferably divided into several alignment difference ranges, to which various range functions are assigned to carry out a particular stabilization function or for other control purposes. These range functions are executed, provided the corresponding alignment difference is located within the corresponding alignment difference range, this preferably being dependent on minimum holding times. This<br>
has the advantage that range functions are not inadvertently executed and/or terminated, if for example unintentionally, due to a trembling or swaying movement, an alignment difference range is only relinquished for a short time.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is envisaged that for the purpose of communicating and evaluating the alignment difference in regard to alignment difference ranges a variable offset value can be added to the physical alignment differences which is calculated so that the average physical alignment difference always falls back to zero or close to zero in a predetermined time e.g. 1 sec., and/or whereby the high frequency fluctuations of the physical alignment difference values are suppressed. The predetermined time can be set for example to 0.5 sec., 1 sec. or 2 or more seconds. By utilizing this measure, relatively simple compensation devices may be used, which can provide good quality images only at relatively small alignment differences. In case of larger alignment differences, images achievable with such relatively simple alignment devices would be subject to image deficiencies such as chromatic aberration and distortion. Such image deficiencies would become especially noticeable in case of still images or uniformly moving image sequences.<br>
In addition preferably the high-frequency fluctuations of the alignment differences are suppressed, with exception of the values fed to the compensation device, which has the advantage that fast jitter of an indicated alignment difference is less visible and/or is smoothed in the display and therefore the alignment difference can be more easily controlled by the user, holding by hand an image capture apparatus equipped with the invention.<br>
For image capture apparatus or systems, such as professional film cameras for instance, preferably the following alignment difference ranges corresponding to the moat important stabilization functions are provided and "discrete" range functions are assigned thereto for pre-defining the target image section alignment, in the result of which the respective alignment difference value is not included (only the fact that the current alignment difference value is located in a certain alignment difference range is considered), so that inadvertent fluctuations of the image capture apparatus continue to have no effect on the projected image section:<br>
freeze of the image section centre,<br>
retention of the momentary movement of the image section<br>
centre,<br>
retention of a desired image horizon,<br>
restriction of the movement to pre-set values and maximum<br>
values regarding velocity and/or acceleration,<br>
As a result the three most important functions of a stabilization device for a film camera can be achieved, namely a shot of a static or evenly moving image section - free from all inadvertent movements of the film camera - or the shot during horizontal panning with steady start, even progression and steady finish.<br>
In addition alignment difference ranges are provided for image section displacement analogous to the alignment of the image capture apparatus and "analogue" range functions assigned thereto for pre-determining the target image section alignment, in the result of which the respective alignment difference is also included, so that movements and/or fluctuations of the image capture'apparatus also affect the projected image section:<br>
change in the momentary movement of the image section<br>
centre,<br>
change in the momentary image horizon,<br>
change in the positional point of reference of the image<br>
capture apparatus,<br>
Since changes in a movement mostly only occur during a very brief period, any unsteadiness due to fluctuation is only slightly noticeable, so that the advantage of controlling a change in velocity and direction by means of analogous controlled alignment of the image capture apparatus prevails.<br>
For communicating the three types of alignment difference concerning the alignment difference ranges an optical display is preferably used, on which both the three types of alignment differences and their components, as well as the alignment difference ranges assigned to the different functions are preferably displayed in graphic form. For film cameras with an optical viewfinder the display can be overlaid for example optically over this viewfinder image. In the case of video cameras the existing viewfinder image display is preferably used.<br>

Figs. 5 and 6 show two further preferred embodiments of an image stabilization device according to the invention, which illustrate how conventional stabilization devices can also be modified without reconstruction, in order to exploit certain advantages of the invention.<br>
It is to be understood that the features mentioned above and those yet to be described below can be used not only in the combination indicated in each case, but also in other combinations or alone, without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
A film camera, wherein the stabilization device according to the invention can be used in the preferred way, is schematically shown from above in Fig. 2 and designated throughout with the numeral 10. The film camera has a housing in which the stabilization device according to the invention is arranged together with further components. The lens of the film camera 10 is shown schematically simplified and is designated with the numeral 14. The lens 14 defines a structural optical axis of the film camera 10, which is designated with the letter M in Fig. 2. The structural optical axis M in its turn defines an image section designated below as structural image section 16.  Expediently the optical axis M is directed toward the centre of this structural image section. Structural image section in the following is understood to mean the image section which is captured by the camera and/or is present in the viewfinder of the camera, if no compensation and/or stabilization of the image is implemented by means of compensation devices of the film camera yet to be described. The structural image section is therefore also to be understood as the image section the centre of which is defined by the structural optical axis M. It is to be understood that the term "structural image section" to a certain extent designates a "virtual" image section, which actually is not usually to be captured and/or observed by the optical device 10.<br>
In addition it is assumed that a target image section designated with the numeral 18 is the image section, which is desired by the user. That is to say the latter would like to maintain this target image section 18, and/or its displacement movement for a certain period and/or arbitrary duration for example. The corresponding target alignment of the camera, in the following also called the effective optical axis, is designated with the letter Z. At the point of time<br>
illustrated in Fig. 2 the film camera 10 is directed along its structural optical axis M, which differs from the target alignment Z by a difference angle R. The size of this angle results from the alignment difference caused by the user through intentional alignment of the camera plus a disturbance angle caused by the unavoidable trembling and swaying of the user.<br>
This alignment difference R can be compensated by means of a first compensation device 19 located in front of the lens 14. This means the effective optical axis of the film camera at the time point illustrated in Pig. 2 is Z, although the structural optical axis is M.Compensation and/or image shift devices of this kind as they are designated here with the numeral 19, are presently known and therefore not described in detail.<br>
A further axis X runs in the image shift device 19, perpendicularly to the axis Z and through the intersection of axes M, Z, a plane extending through the axes X and Z describing the target horizon of the target image section 18.<br>
The structural horizon of the film camera is defined by the axis M and an axis K running perpendicularly thereto, whereby the structural horizon plane of the camera extends through these two axes.<br>
The connection between target horizon and structural horizon is likewise illustrated on the basis of a simple example: if it is assumed that the axes M, Z and X run in the projection plane of Fig. 2, that is to say horizontal, and only the axis K has a component perpendicular to this projection plane, this means that the target horizon also runs in the projection<br>
plane, thus horizontally, but the structural horizon runs diagonally to this, as shall be clarified later with reference to Fig. 1.<br>
The camera 10 may have a further compensation device designated with the numeral 20 for compensating the alignment difference between structural horizon and target horizon, designated with the letter H below. The compensation device 20 here is provided in the focal plane 22 of the camera 10 and compensates the horizon difference, for example by corresponding rotation of the electronic image sensor.<br>
The alignment direction difference R illustrated in Fig. 2 is only caused by an angular movement of the film camera 10 around the intersection of the axes M, Z. In reality linear deviations of the point of reference are also to be taken into consideration, that is to say substantially perpendicular to the axis Z defining the target image section. Such deviations are designated below with the letter C2.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a preferred embodiment of a viewfinder image, which can be used in the context of the device according to the invention.<br>
Firstly the axes Z and M can be recognized in the viewfinder image shown in Fig. 1. The axis Z here is located in the centre of the viewfinder image. By means of geometrical figures which can be displayed in the viewfinder image, various alignment difference ranges may be defined, which can be assigned to different functions in each case.<br>
For indication of the directional alignment difference, that is to say the deviation between the axes Z and M, a direction cursor Cl is preferably displayed, for example in the form of<br>
a possibly flashing small cross. This cursor Cl is preferably indicated in the centre of the viewfinder display if the momentary directional alignment difference is equal to zero.<br>
A directional difference range Rl for the discrete range function "freezing of the image section centre" is projected in the centre of the display, preferably in the form of a circle. This range corresponds for example to a directional difference range of 1 degree around the target direction of the image section center. The range function is executed whenever the direction cursor Cl is steered into the circle Rl and held there. It then keeps the target directional alignment constant, which corresponds to freezing of the image section centre.<br>
If the cursor Cl is steered out of the range Rl, it thus moves into the remaining range R3, to which preferably the analogue range function "change of the momentary movement of the image section centre" is assigned, which preferably works for example as follows: the target direction is determined by the direction in which the cursor Cl leaves the circle Rl. As soon as the cursor is outside Rl for a minimum time, a vector is determined and preferably indicated as arrow V, which starts from the centre of the circle. From this moment the directional difference range Rl is deactivated, although however it continues to be displayed. The length and direction of the arrow V are a measure for the size and direction of the momentary target displacement velocity of the target image section, this preferably by taking account of the momentary image angle of the lens and being measured in image section widths per second. The arrow length is preferably approximately proportional to the logarithm of the momentary target velocity, the initial velocity being very low or equal<br>
to zero and the initial length being e.g. equal to the radius<br>
of Rl.<br>
By steering the cursor position of the cursor Cl (through corresponding directional alignment of the film camera) the head of the arrow is now steered in any arbitrary direction and, in this way, direction and velocity of the movement of the target image section are changed. Preferably the head of the arrow does not follow the cursor Cl directly, but with a certain time lag. The greater the distance of the cursor Cl from the head of the arrow, the faster it is tracked, so that it never departs very far from the cursor Cl. Preferably a feedback is given to the user/operator e.g. by flashing of the arrow, when the target displacement velocity reaches a predefineable value. This is especially important when filming with 24 frames per second where a too fast pan would give a stuttering effect. If the range R2 described below is activated around the head of the arrow, only the distance between cursor and range limit of R2 is considered. In the way just described the target image section can be shifted similar to the camera alignment in any arbitrary direction and with arbitrary velocity, whereby this displacement is possible with sensitivity because of the acceleration algorithms applied. Swaying the camera however during the execution cannot be suppressed entirely during this analogue range function, since it affects the modification of the velocity vector.<br>
As soon as the velocity has again been reduced to the initial value and therefore the arrow length again to the initial length, the arrow disappears and the directional difference range Rl becomes active again.<br>
In addition a directional difference range R2 is preferably provided. It is displayed at the tip of the velocity vector V<br>
preferably in the form of a circle R2, the radius of which is preferably variable and e.g. equal to the arrow length minus the radius of Rl, although expediently its size should not be greater than a pre-determined maximum value.<br>
The discrete range function assigned to the range R2 is executed whenever the cursor Cl is steered into this circle R2. The range function then keeps the momentary target velocity and target direction of the image section displacement constant, provided the cursor is held in this circle R2.<br>
The display of the range R2 preferably can be omitted as required if, instead of this for example the cursor Cl changes its colour and/or flash frequency etc. accordingly when approaching the (now invisible) edge of the circle and/or after passing it.<br>
The advantage of this range R2, which is variable in its position, lies in the fact that acceleration of an image section movement can be terminated in an intuitive way and changed to an even motion by the user steering the cursor Cl into the range R2 always located in the proximity of the cursor.<br>
A position cursor C2 reflects the deviation of the point of reference of the image capture apparatus from a target position of the environment. The effect of this distance with its unavoidable fluctuations should be taken into consideration particularly with extreme telephoto shots and compensated by the compensation device.<br>
For this purpose a discrete range function for stabilizing the camera position fluctuations and a positional difference range<br>
assigned thereto are preferably provided, which is indicated for example in the form of a circle PI in the centre of the viewfinder image, the area of which corresponds to a positional difference value range of 8 cm diameter for example. Pi coincides e.g. for the sake of clarity with the circle Rl. The range function hands over size and direction of this difference together with the focal distance, as already described above, to the compensation device. It is executed, whenever for example a position cursor C2 represented by a small square e.g. is steered by moving the image capture apparatus to the side and height-wise into the range PI and held there. In the case of film cameras a substantially smaller range of values is preferably assigned to PI during pauses in shooting, which has the advantage that C2 always lies at the start of filming in the proximity of the centre of PI.<br>
If the cursor C2 is located outside the positional difference range Pi in the remaining range P2, the deviation from the point of reference of the environment is always preferably taken back again according to an algorithm to the range limit Pi. This corresponds to a correlational movement of the positional point of reference of the environment with the camera, serving to characterize the target position.<br>
Ranges, functions and displays regarding the horizon difference will be illustrated below by examples:<br>
A horizon cursor C3 reflects the deviation of the camera horizon from the target horizon. It is preferably indicated by two short lines on the viewfinder display edge, which lie on an imaginary line running through the display centre, the position of which is similar to the angle between the camera horizon and the target horizon, whereby the target horizon<br>
preferably always runs horizontally through the viewfinder image centre.<br>
Preferably a discrete range function is provided for a target horizon position parallel to the real horizon. It is executed whenever the horizon cursor C3 is steered by aligning the camera around its optical axis into the corresponding horizon difference range HI on the viewfinder edge and held there. This range for example comprises an angle of + - 3 degrees to the target horizon. The range function then sets the target image horizon to zero. Hereupon the compensation device automatically keeps the projected horizon parallel to the real horizon, whereby its position is then no longer affected by trembling and swaying of the camera.<br>
In addition an analogue range function for changing the target horizon position is preferably provided. The rotation and rotation velocity of the target horizon should preferably approximately follow the rotation of the camera around its optical axis. This analogue range function is executed whenever the horizon cursor C3 is steered through rotating the image capture apparatus around its optical axis out of the horizon difference range appertaining to the momentary horizon position. Then the change in the target horizon angle is all the faster the further the cursor C3 is distant from the range HI and/or H2. During execution of this analogue range function swaying of the camera is also included in the movement of the image horizon.<br>
In addition a discrete range function for keeping the momentary target horizon position constant is preferably provided. This is executed whenever the cursor C3 is steered by aligning the camera around its optical axis into the corresponding positional difference range H2 on the viewfinder<br>
edge and held there. This range H2 preferably is only indicated if the target horizon deviates from the horizon of the environment. The horizon difference range H2 preferably lies on the left and/or right of the viewfinder centre and comprises for example an angle of + - 2 degrees. The discrete range function then keeps the momentary target horizon angle constant. Hereupon the projected image horizon is then automatically held by the compensation device parallel to the target horizon, its position not being affected by trembling and swaying of the image capture apparatus.<br>
Directional difference ranges and their discrete range functions for horizontal or vertical panning are preferably provided for film cameras. These, as described below, are preferably activated by selection from a menu, whereby the desired maximum panning speed can be pre-selected at the same time. Subsequently, panning preferably begins in the direction in which the cursor Cl leaves the central range for image freeze, whereby the direction of motion of the target image section is limited to horizontal and/or vertical movement. The start is preferably made with constant acceleration, until the pre-selected panning speed is reached. The finish also occurs with the same braking acceleration, when the cursor is again steered into the central range. After stopping the normal difference ranges are again activated.<br>
Due to the use only of discrete range functions the advantage results that all phases of panning, including start and finish, remain free of undesired fluctuations. In connection with the compensation of horizon fluctuations panning shots, which are captured more steadily than with a tripod, can be taken by hand.<br>
Another three special functions are detailed below, which are only possible by application of the principles according to the invention illustrated, especially as in Claims 1 to 5:<br>
In the following a function for system control during a shot will be illustrated as an example:<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, especially according to Claim 9, a directional difference range, which preferably extends over the whole display and its range function of which keeps the momentary movement of the image section constant, can be activated and displayed by pressing a key etc. Such a key can be provided for example in a suitable place on the housing of the image capture apparatus. This range is overlaid with further alignment difference ranges labeled or provided with symbols, the range functions of which control system parameters of the image capture apparatus, such as for instance white balance, colour temperature, grey filter, aperture, exposure time, activation of panning ranges with selection of maximum panning speed etc. They are selected by steering the cursor Cl into their corresponding range and executed for example when releasing the key.<br>
The advantage of this range function lies in the fact that by corresponding alignment of the image capture apparatus any control function can be intentionally executed, even during a continuous shot without removing the eye from the viewfinder and without disturbing the image section and its even movement.<br>
In the following a function for adjusting focus during a shot will be illustrated as an example:<br>
In addition preferably during such pressing of a key etc., a directional difference range can be activated, the limits of which are optically laid over the viewfinder image covering a substantial part hereof and the range function of which on the one hand keeps the momentary movement of the image section constant and on the other hand continually determines the corresponding point in the image section from the cursor position and passes this continuously or on activation of a key on to an automatic focus device for focusing on this point of the image section. The remaining alignment difference range is preferably assigned to an analogue range function for changing the momentary movement of the image section.<br>
The advantage of this range function lies in the fact that even during a continuous shot by corresponding alignment of the image capture apparatus focusing can be automatically carried out intentionally on any point of the image so that both intentional focus shifts as well as continuous focusing on an object moving in the image section are possible while keeping the motion path of the image perfectly stabilized at the same time.<br>
For simple compensation devices which may reduce the image quality for higher physical alignment differences and e.g. introduce chromatic aberration or distortion artifacts etc., it would be advantageous to avoid at least persistent high physical alignment differences, e.g. during long pans, setting of system parameters, selecting the part of the image section to focus on, etc. This can be accomplished by applying the principles described in claim 5. For long pans the offset value could be corresponding to the length of the vector V also.<br>
Functions for pre-programming and program-controlled execution of an image section sequence for film cameras will be illustrated below.<br>
This is also achieved using existing devices in a very simple way and without significant technical complexity. Such a sequence is implemented for example as follows:<br>
The cameraman aligns the camera to the start image. The cameraman presses a start image key and begins with the image shift.<br>
The system control stores the respective momentary position of the image section, the respective image angle of the lens and the respective distance adjustment in a memory at regular periodic intervals. The cameraman presses a finish key, when the desired final image is reached and the length of time it has been displayed is sufficient.<br>
The system control smoothes out irregularities of the stored motion sequence according to mathematical algorithms.<br>
The image position control slowly leads the image section back to the start image and instructs the cameraman by flashing of the central circle Rl in the display e.g. to hold the direction cursor Cl within or at least in the proximity of the flashing circle while the camera returns to the initial position. When the initial position is reached, the central circle stops flashing. The cameraman begins to film, as a result of which the image position control starts the stored target motion sequence and by flashing of the central circle Rl instructs the cameraman to hold the direction cursor Cl within or at least in the proximity of the flashing circle. Hereupon the cameraman is instructed as to how he<br>
must align the camera, so that the compensation device does not exceed its technically restricted range limits. The desired image section sequence is now recorded exactly, and, if technically feasible, the image angle of the lens and the distance are also continuously modified.<br>
Thus, the term "instruction" as used in the specification, especially in claims 7 and 10, is meant to include instructions relating to any one, any combination or all possible instructions relating to the alignment differences a user may compensate.<br>
On the basis of an example of stabilized binoculars a simple variant of the invention is described below which permits a static image section, substantially free from the influence of inadvertent movement of the binoculars, with simultaneous control by the user as to when and for how long an image is to be frozen and/or when the image section ought to be shifted.<br>
By means of an integral gyroscope e.g. the movement of the structural optical axis is registered in the known way and the directional difference, for example to a target directional alignment stored in a memory, is continuously determined. The effect of this directional difference on the projected image section is constantly fully compensated by an optical compensation device for all frequencies of the directional difference. This means the projected image section is completely frozen provided the target alignment does not change and the directional difference does not exceed the values which can be compensated by the compensation device.<br>
According to Claim 2 a first directional difference range is pre-determined by the stabilization device according to the invention in the form of a cone for example with an angle of <br><br>
degrees around the target alignment of the optical axis and the "image section freeze" function is assigned to this range. Provided the directional differences are within this range, the target position data remain the same.<br>
In addition a second directional difference range is defined, which consists of all remaining directional differences able to be compensated by the compensation device, and the "displacement of the image section" function is assigned to this range. Provided the directional differences are within this second range, the target directional data are changed according to an algorithm in which above all direction and distance of the momentary directional difference in relation to the first directional difference range are included. The greater the distance from the range limit the higher the velocity of the target image shift. This preferably takes place according to an exponential correlation: with a directional difference, for example of 2, 3, 4 and/or 5 degrees relative to the target direction, the velocity of the target direction is then set for example to 0, I, 10 and/or 100 degrees per second. For a directional difference of for example 3 degrees right of the target image centre the horizontal component of the target direction data is then increased continuously by 1 degree per second.<br>
According to Claim 1 the directional difference is communicated for example here as follows:<br>
eight arrows are optically illustrated around the viewfinder image, for example. These arrows can be modulated in their colour and/or brightness and/or flash frequency, whereby through the type of display the correlation between the directional difference and the alignment difference ranges is made perceptible to the user, for example as follows: provided the directional difference values are located within the<br>
central first directional difference range A, the arrows shine steady green. Their brightness reflects the size and direction of the momentary directional difference. For a directional difference of zero all arrows shine equally brightly. For a directional difference for example of 1 degree to the right, the right arrow shines more brightly and the other arrows shine correspondingly less brightly. If the directional difference approaches the range limit of 2 degrees the corresponding arrow is displayed yellow and additionally if necessary also flashes. If the directional difference exceeds the range limit the corresponding arrow is displayed red.<br>
Hereby the user can quite intentionally produce an image freeze, by holding the arrows in the green range through corresponding alignment of the binoculars. He can do this without much trouble, since according to Claim 3 the central directional difference range for the "image freeze" function with two degrees around the target position of the optical axis is selected here so that it is greater than the disturbance value amplitude caused by trembling and swaying of the user.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the user can increase the central directional difference range 1 for image freeze by pressing a key for example from two to four degrees around the target position of the optical axis. As a result he can easily, even when standing on a swaying base such as on a boat, hold the arrows in the green or yellow range and therefore achieve a blur-free and fluctuation-free image section.<br>
As distinct from conventional solutions, it is possible thus to prevent the image section from fluctuating or the alignment of the binoculars from moving slowly and unnoticed away from<br>
the desired target position and causing the image section to shift inadvertently.<br>
The user also determines when the image section is to be shifted. To do this he aligns the binoculars for example to the right until the right arrow turns red, after which the image section begins to move to the right. This becomes faster the faster the binoculars are moved to the right. Since with this simple variant of the invention the velocity of the image section displacement for velocities greater than zero always depends on the momentary amount of the directional difference, no optimum stabilization of the image section displacement movement can be achieved, which however in the case of binoculars is also not of great importance. As soon as, by corresponding alignment of the binoculars, the arrows are again steered into the green and/or yellow range, a direct and blur-free static image is obtained.<br>
This simple variant of the invention can also naturally be used for a film camera recording on chemical film or for an amateur video camera.<br>
In the case of binoculars or video cameras with exclusively simple angular acceleration sensors and without gyroscopes, which cannot determine the absolute displacement velocity of the image section and thus cannot recognize any static image section, the "even movement" function of the image section can be assigned to the first directional difference range and the "change of the momentary movement" function of the image section can be assigned to the second directional difference range. As a result an image freeze can also be achieved and maintained by the user initially slowing down a momentary movement to a stop through corresponding alignment of the<br>
binoculars and then holding the directional difference within the first range.<br>
To overcome the drawbacks of angular acceleration sensors, the unknown angular velocity could be synchronized to a. known value whenever a motion analyzis of the projected image sequence detects a reliable velocity value which would be easiest for the velocity zero e.g.<br>
Since this simple variant of the invention only takes the directional difference in relation to the target alignment of the optical axis into consideration, no absolutely stable or blur-free image section can be obtained with strong magnification and short focal distance. This instability however could be suppressed by taking into consideration the positional difference, which technically means only slight additional complexity. The lacking stabilization of the horizon position on the other hand in the case of binoculars is only of minor importance.<br>
Fig. 2A shows basic elements of one stabilization device 50, with which the present invention, especially the methods according to the invention, can be put into practice. Device 50 comprises a controller 52, an alignment sensor 54, a display 56, a battery 58 and a compensation device 59. The stabilization device 50 may also comprise an additional user interface, by means of which, for example, the controller is programmable (for example, ranges, range functions etc.). As explained in detail throughout this specification, the positioning of a cursor to control range functions also constitutes a user interface. An image capture system comprising device 50 is suitable to provide image stabilization or stabilized image section displacement according to the present invention. The compensation device 59 for example operates as image shift device 19, FIG. 2, and/or as compensation device 20, such that compensation can be achieved in the focal plane array 22. Thus, compensation for<br>
alignment differences, for example directional alignment differences or horizon differences, can be achieved.<br>
The basic operation of device 50 will now be explained. Various modes of operation are described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 3-6, but references will illustratively be made, as an example, to the embodiment according to FIG. 3.<br>
In illustrative operation, therefore, device 50 compares target image alignment data (functional block 301, FIG. 3) with actual alignment image data (functional block 302, FIG. 3), and determines the alignment difference (functional block 303, FIG. 3).  In one embodiment, functional blocks 301 and 303 are implemented by controller 52, and functional block 302 by means of alignment sensor 54, which, for example, can comprise a gyroscope or an accelerometer. Functional block 301 may be provided through data storage in internal memory of controller 52, for example, and functional block 303 may be provided by processing functions (e.g., software) of controller 52.<br>
The alignment difference data as determined by controller 52 are provided to the compensation device 59 and the display 56. In FIG. 3, functional block 304 corresponds to compensation device 59, and functional block 313 to display 56. Accordingly, both the compensation device 59 and the display 56 are provided with these alignment difference data; this enables a user of the image capture system (e.g., system 10, FIG. 1) provided with the image stabilization according to the invention to effectively produce stabilized images, as will be explained in detail below. Especially, the alignment difference information provided to the user via the display 56 renders possible an efficient functioning of the compensation<br>
device 59, as the user can, then, keep the alignment difference within a desired or pre-determined range by orientating the image capture system in space. Stabilization information may for example be displayed to the user on display 54 in a manner like the viewfinder image of FIG. 1.<br>
Further to providing these alignment difference data to compensation device 59 and display 56, these data are processed/analyzed with respect to alignment difference ranges and/or functions associated with these ranges. These ranges and functions are stored in controller 52. Thus, in FIG. 3, functional blocks 311 (comparing alignment difference data with specific alignment difference ranges) as well as functional blocks 314 to 315 (specifying and implementing specific range functions) are implemented/operated by the processing and storage memory of controller 52.  Further, the system control (as specified in functional block 312 in Fig 3) is implemented by controller 52.<br>
Display 54 and battery 56 are shown illustratively. It should be clear that these items may be separate from device 50 to provide like function. For example, display 56 may be the display integrated with the image capture system, and battery 58 may be the main power pack of a hand-held image capture system, providing power to both display 56 and controller 52, as shown.<br>
As mentioned, controller 52 includes software and/or firmware that may be implemented (e.g., programmed) in accordance with the embodiments of FIG. 3-FIG. 6, described below.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to FIG. 3 to FIG. 6. In these figures, two main blocks are shown: 300 and 310, 400 and 410, 500 and 510, 600<br>
and 610, respectively. All blocks within these main blocks are referred to as functional blocks in the following. A number of these functional blocks may be referred to by specific functions or as specific components. Functional blocks within 300, 400, 500 and 600 (optionally with further components) for example constitute basic stabilization device functionality, while functional blocks within 310, 410, 510 and 610 provide for alignment ranges, range functions, display and system control.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a functional diagram of a simple embodiment of an image stabilization device according to the invention. In the further description only the alignment of the optical axis is taken into consideration, which for amateur binoculars or amateur video cameras can be quite sufficient, since undesired movements of the optical axis have by far the greatest effect on image stability. The position of the image capture apparatus and the horizon position could possibly be taken into consideration accordingly, that is to say the same functional diagram may be used in each case.<br>
301 pre-determines the target alignment of the optical axis, by for example storing corresponding direction data in a memory. Their initial value can for example be an arbitrary 30 degrees east and 10 degrees under the horizon.<br>
An actual positional detector 302 determines the real direction of the structural optical axis. For this purpose a gyroscope can be used for example. If the horizon position and the alignment to the zenith are not determined, fictitious initial values for the alignment of the optical axis can be assumed, for example 0 degrees under the horizon, whereby a rotation around the vertical axis of the image capture apparatus then changes the value of the alignment concerning<br>
the direction of the sky, and a rotation around the transverse axis of the image capture apparatus changes the value for the inclination to the horizon.<br>
303 then determines the directional difference between actual direction and target direction and converts this into the two components, which can be compensated by the compensation device, for example the two angles to be compensated around the vertical axis and the transverse axis of the image capture apparatus.<br>
The compensation device 304 then fully compensates the alignment difference for all frequencies of a changing alignment difference, as already mentioned above.<br>
All technical embodiments corresponding to functional blocks 301 to 304 are known in various forms and are a component part of conventional stabilization devices and therefore will not be described in detail.<br>
A core of the invention lies in the functional blocks 311 to 315. Here two directional difference ranges 311 are predetermined by a system control 312: a central range ADR-1 of 2 degrees around the target direction of the image section center and a remaining range ADR-2 between 2 degrees and 5 degrees around the target direction of the image section center. The system control now constantly monitors into which range the momentary alignment difference of the structural optical axis falls. At the same time the directional difference concerning the range limits is communicated to the user via the communication device 313, so that the user can intentionally steer the directional difference into one of the ranges and hold it there by corresponding alignment of the<br>
image capture apparatus. In the context of the application ADR is used as Abbreviation for "Aligenment Difference Range".<br>
If the directional difference is held for a minimum time within the range ADR-1, the discrete range function 314 "image freeze" is called up and executed by the system control, which leaves the momentary target coordinates of the target alignment of the optical axis unchanged as long as this range function is active. Even if the directional difference value due to trembling and swaying of the image capture apparatus moves irregularly within +/- 2 degrees around the target alignment, a still standing image sequence is captured, since the target alignment remains unchanged and the compensation device 304 always fully compensates all values and frequencies of the directional differences. Since the user can hold the directional difference with the help of the communication device within ADR-1 for an arbitrary period, he can obtain a stable, still standing blur-free image sequence in this way for any arbitrary duration, which is not feasible in principle with conventional solutions.<br>
If the directional difference is now steered by the user into the range ADR-2, the analogue range function 315 "displacement/movement" of the target alignment of the optical axis is called up and executed by the system control, which changes the momentary target alignment of the optical axis all the faster the further the directional difference is distant from the limit of the range ADR-1, the direction of the change being derived from the direction of the directional difference to the centre of ADR-1. The target direction hereupon follows analogue to the alignment of the image capture apparatus. Inadvertent fluctuations of the directional difference however, as also with conventional solutions, are included in the displacement velocity. In addition arbitrary<br>
directional initial values are also synchronized by this range function, when the image capture apparatus is switched on, with directional difference values, which cannot be compensated since any large directional difference tracks the target position with high velocity, so that the directional difference is automatically reduced in the briefest time to values which can be compensated.<br>
Pig. 4 illustrates a functional diagram of a more complex embodiment of an image stabilization device according to the invention, for a professional film camera for example. In the further description only the differences to the embodiment according to Fig. 3 are considered:<br>
The main difference consists in the fact that there are more than two directional difference ranges whereby some can be variable in their position and size, such as for example the directional difference range ADR-4 for the range function "constant movement" of the target image direction. This range is only activated by the system control 415 if the directional difference has left the central range ADR-2 for "image freeze". Its position and therefore its range of values are preferably a function of the velocity and direction of the momentary displacement velocity of the target image direction, as already described above. Provided the directional difference is held by the user within this range ADR-4, the range function 422 is executed by the system control 415, which changes the target direction coordinates of the target image, corresponding to the target displacement velocity existing before call up of 422, evenly and constantly. This even movement of the target image section is then completely free from any undesired directional difference fluctuations. This naturally also applies due to the always present full<br>
compensation of all directional differences for the captured image section.<br>
For intentional control of the directional difference by the user a graphic display 418 with graphic indication of the directional difference ranges ADR 1, 2, 3, 4... is provided here in the form of graphic symbols and graphic display of the directional difference in the form of cursors (see also description of Fig. 1 and 2}.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a functional diagram of an image stabilization device according to the invention, which indicates how conventional stabilization devices can also be modified without reconstruction, in order to use the advantages of the invention. In the further description only the differences to the embodiment according to Fig. 3 are considered:<br>
A conventional stabilization device is illustrated with 501 to 505 of the group 500. The main difference to Fig. 3 consists in the fact that the core range 510 of the invention only intervenes in the existing low-pass filter logarithm 505 of the conventional stabilization device. In the simplest case this is simply deactivated by the range function 514 for "image freeze", assigned to the directional difference range ADR-1, during execution of this function, so that it then no longer changes the target image direction. The image section is then frozen, unaffected by directional alignment fluctuations.<br>
If the directional difference is steered into the range ADR-2 by the user and if the corresponding range function 515 is executed, this restarts the filter algorithm and the image capture apparatus regarding the function of the image section<br>
displacement/movement behaves like a conventional stabilization device.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a functional diagram of an image stabilization device according to the invention, which indicates how a further variant of a conventional stabilization device can also be modified without reconstruction, in order to use the advantages of the invention. In the further description only the differences to the embodiment according to Fig. 3 are considered:<br>
A conventional stabilization device is illustrated with 603 to 605 of the group 600. The main difference to Fig. 3 consists in the fact that the core range 610 of the invention only intervenes in the existing high-pass filter algorithm 605 of the conventional stabilization device. In the simplest case this range function 615 for "even movement", assigned to the directional difference range ADR-1, is simply "short-circuiting" the high-pass filter during execution of this function, so that all detected actual alignment fluctuations of any frequency are compensated by the compensation device 604. The image section then maintains its movement unaffected by alignment fluctuations.<br>
If the directional difference is steered into the range ADR-2 by the user and if the corresponding range function 614 is executed, this restarts the filter algorithm and the image capture apparatus regarding the function of changing the image section movement behaves like a conventional stabilization device.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

user, a steering of the alignment difference to or into which leads to a displacement of the<br>
target alignment in dependence on the actual alignment difference.<br>
18.	Method according to claim 16 or 17, wherein at least one pre-definable alignment<br>
difference value or at least two pre-definable ranges of alignment difference values are<br><br>
provided, wherein at least one function is assigned to the at least one pre-determined value or each of the at least two pre-determined ranges values, which functions are selectable by steering the alignment difference to the at least one pre-determined value or the at least two determined ranges of values.<br>
19.	Method according to claim 18, wherein said at least one function comprises a stabilization function.<br>
20.	A stabilization device for hand-held image capture system, comprising:<br>
a controller for determining an alignment difference between an actual alignment of the image capture system and a target alignment of the image capture system; and a compensation device for compensating for the determined alignment difference on a projected image section, the controller communicating the alignment difference, with respect to at least two alignment values or ranges of values stored by the controller, to a display, such that a user is able, by adjusting the orientation of the image capture system, to steer the alignment difference to the one or more values or within the range of values.<br>
21.	The stabilization device according to claim 20, further comprising the display, integrated with the image capture system.<br>
22.	The stabilization device according to claim 20 or 21, wherein the controller stores parameters defining a target image section according to an algorithm, such that "freeze" or "even movement of the image section" functions of the image capture system are substantially unaffected by an actual value of the alignment difference so long as the actual value, controlled by the user, lies within a fixed alignment difference range or variably pre-definable alignment difference range.<br>
23.	The stabilization device according to claim 20, whereby effect of alignment<br>
differences on the projected image section may be compensated, independent of frequency,<br>
by the compensation device.<br><br>
24.	The stabilization device according to claim 20, wherein the alignment difference range assigned to a particular function is pre-determined to be greater than the extent of a disturbance value range caused by user motion.<br>
25.	The stabilization device of claim 20, the parameters comprising one or more of position, alignment and movement.<br>
26. The stabilization device according to claim 20, the controller implementing tasks for each of a plurality of difference ranges throughout a total range of the compensation device.<br>
27. A method for stabilizing an image generated from a hand-held image capture system, comprising:<br>
determining an alignment difference between an actual alignment of the image capture system and a target alignment of the image capture system;<br>
displaying the alignment difference relative to one or more alignment values or ranges of values; and<br>
compensating the actual alignment of the image capture system, in response to user orientation of the image capture system, to steer the alignment difference to the one or more values or within the range of values.<br></td>
