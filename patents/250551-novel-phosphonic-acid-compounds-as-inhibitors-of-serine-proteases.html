CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [31 M<br>
This application claims benefit of provisional application Serial Number<br>
60/330,343, filed 19 October 2001 and US Serial No. 10/273,208 filed October<br>
17, 2002, which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to certain novel compounds, methods for<br>
preparing the compounds, compositions, intermediates and derivatives thereof<br>
and for treating inflammatory and serine protease mediated disorders. More<br>
particularly, the phosphonic acid compounds of the present invention are serine<br>
protease inhibitors .useful for treating inflammatory and serine protease<br>
mediated disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Serine proteases represent a broad class of endopeptidases that are<br>
involved in physiological processes such as blood coagulation, complement<br>
activation, phagocytosis and turnover of damaged cell tissue. For example,<br>
cathepsin G (cat G) is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease found in the<br>
azurophilic granules of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Along with other serine<br>
proteases such as human neutrophil elastase and protease 3, cat G functions<br>
to degrade proteins during inflammatory responses. Cat G is thought to<br>
degrade human elastin during chronic lung inflammation, a process which may<br>
in part be responsible for asthma, pulmonary emphysema, chronic obstructive<br>
pulmonary diseases (COPD) as well as other pulmonary inflammatory<br>
conditions. Similarly, human chymase (HC) is a chymotrypsin-like serine<br><br>
protease synthesized in mast cells. HC has a variety of functions, including<br>
degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, cleavage of angiotensin I to<br>
angiotensin n and activation of matrix proteases and cytokines. Inadequate<br>
control by their natural inhibitors can cause these enzymes to degrade healthy<br>
constituents of the extracellular matrix, and thereby contribute to inflammatory<br>
disorders such as asthma, emphysema, bronchitis, psoriasis, allergic rhinitis,<br>
viral rhinitis, ischemia, arthritis and reperfusion injury. Thus, small molecule<br>
inhibitors of cat G and HC are likely to represent useful therapeutic agents.<br>
US Patent 5,508,273 to Beers, et al. and Bioorganic &amp; Med. Chem. Lett.,<br>
1995, 5, (16), 1801-1806 describe phosphonic acid compounds useful in<br>
treating bone wasting diseases. In particular, 1-napthylmethylphosphonic acid<br>
derivatives have been described as osteoclastic acid phosphatase inhibitors of<br>
the formula:<br><br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
phosphonic acid compounds that are serine protease inhibitors (in particular,<br>
inhibitors of cathepsin G and chymase) useful for treating inflammatory and<br>
serine protease mediated disorders. It is another object of the invention to<br>
provide a process for preparing phosphonic or phosphinic acid compounds,<br>
compositions, intermediates and derivatives thereof. It is a further object of the<br>
invention to provide methods for treating inflammatory and serine protease<br>
mediated disorders.<br><br><br>

The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the<br>
compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional<br>
derivatives of the compounds, which are readily convertible in vivo into an<br>
active compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present invention,<br>
the term "administering" shall encompass the treatment of the various disorders<br>
described with the compound specifically disclosed or a prodrug compound<br>
which would be obviously included within the scope of the invention although<br>
not specifically disclosed including, but not limited to diphenylphosphonate or<br>
diphenylphosphinate esters of certain of the instant compounds. Conventional<br>
procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are<br>
described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier,<br><br>
1985. Phosphonic acid prodrugs (as described in De Lombaert S., et al, Non-<br>

The compounds according to this invention may have at least one chiral<br>
center and thus may exist as enantiomers. In addition, the compounds of the<br>
present invention may also possess two or more chiral centers and thus may<br>
also exist as diastereomers. Where the processes for the preparation of the<br>
present compounds give rise to a mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may<br>
be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography.<br>
Accordingly, the compounds may be prepared as a racemic mixture or, by<br>
either enantiospecific synthesis or resolution, as individual enantiomers. The<br>
compounds may, for example, be resolved from a racemic mixture into their<br>
component racemates by standard techniques, such as the formation of<br>
diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active base, followed by<br>
fractional crystallization and regeneration of the compounds of this invention.<br>
The racemic mixture may also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric<br>
esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the<br>
chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using a chiral<br>
HPLC column. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures thereof<br>
are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The compounds according to this invention wherein Z forms a double<br>
bond with the carbon of attachment for X, Y is not present and X is hydroxy<br>
may have at least one keto-enol tautomeric form and thus may exist in<br>
equilibirum as geometric isomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers<br><br>
and mixtures thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the<br>
present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or<br>
reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by<br>
means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and<br>
T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient<br>
subsequent stage using methods known in the art.<br>
Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist<br>
as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present<br>
invention. In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water<br>
(i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents, and such solvates are also<br>
intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention.<br>
As used herein, unless otherwise noted, "alkyl" whether used alone or as<br>
part of a substituent group refers to straight and branched carbon chains<br>
having 1 to 8 carbon atoms or any number within this range. The term "alkoxy"<br>
refers to an -O-alkyl substituent group, wherein alkyl is as defined supra.<br>
Similarly, the terms "alkenyl" and "alkynyl" refer to straight and branched<br>
carbon chains having 2 to 8 carbon atoms or any number within this range,<br>
wherein an alkenyl chain has at least one double bond in the chain and an<br>
alkynyl chain has at least one triple bond in the chain. An alkyl and alkoxy<br>
chain may be substituted on a terminal carbon atom or, when acting as a<br>
linking group, within the carbon chain.<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" refers to saturated, moncyclic or polycyclic<br>
hydrocarbon rings of from 3 to 20 carbon atom members (preferably from 3 to 12<br><br>
2-imidazolinyl, imidazolidinyl, 2-pyrazolinyl, pyrazolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl,<br>
thiomorpholinyl and piperazinyl. In the present invention, when Ri is selected<br>
from heterocyclyl, the term "heterocyclyl" refers to a nonaromatic cyclic ring of 5 to<br>
8 members in which 1 to 4 members are nitrogen; wherein, the point of<br>
attachment for the heterocyclyl ring at Ri is a nitrogen ring member; and, wherein<br>
optionally the ring contains zero, one (for 5 and 6 member rings) or two (for 6, 7<br>
and 8 member rings) unsaturated bonds.<br>
The term "aryl" refers to an unsaturated, aromatic monocyclic ring of 6<br>
carbon members or to an unsaturated, aromatic polycyclic ring of from 10 to 20<br>
carbon members. Further, an aryl ring may optionally be fused to one or more<br>
benzene rings (benzo fused aryl), cycloalkyl rings (e.g. benzo fused cycloalkyl) or<br>
cycloalkenyl rings (e.g. benzo fused cycloalkenyl) wherein, for the purpose of<br>
these definitions, the cycloalkyl rings and cycloalkenyl rings may be fused to an<br>
additional benzene ring (to provide fused multiple ring systems such as fluorene).<br>
Examples of such aryl rings include, and are not limited to, phenyl, naphthalenyl,<br>
fluorenyl, indenyl or anthracenyl.<br>
The term "heteroaryl" refers to an aromatic ring of 5 or 6 members<br>
wherein the ring consists of carbon atoms and has at least one heteroatom<br>
member. Suitable heteroatoms include nitrogen, oxygen or sutfur. In the case<br>
of 5 membered rings, the heteroaryl ring contains one member of nitrogen,<br>
oxygen or sulfur and, in addition, may contain up to two additional nitrogens. In<br>
the case of 6 membered rings, the heteroaryl ring may contain from one to<br>
three nitrogen atoms. For the case wherein the 6 member ring has three<br>
nitrogens, at most two nitrogen atoms are adjacent. Optionally, the heteroaryl<br>
ring is fused to a benzene ring (benzo fused heteroaryl), a 5 or 6 membered<br>
heteroaryl ring (containing one of O, Sor N and, optionally, one additional<br>
nitrogen), a 5 to 7 membered alicyclic ring or a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclo ring<br>
(as defined supra but absent the option of a further fused ring). Examples of<br>
heteroaryl groups include, and are not limited to, furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, oxazolyl,<br><br>
thiazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, isoxazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, triazolyl,<br>
thiadiazolyl, pyridinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl or pyrazinyl; fused heteroaryl groups<br>
include indolyl, isoindolyl, indolinyl, benzofuryl, benzothienyl, indazolyl,<br>
benzimidazolyl, benzthiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, benzisoxazolyl, benzothiadiazolyl,<br>
benzotriazolyl, quinolizinyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl or quinazolinyl.<br>
The term "arylalkyl" means an alkyl group substituted with an aryl group<br>
(e.g., benzyl, phenethyl). Similarly, the term "arylalkoxy" indicates an alkoxy<br>
group substituted with an aryl group (e.g., benzyloxy).<br>
As used herein, the term "carboxyl" refers to the linking group -C(0)0- or<br>
(when used accordingly) to the substituent-COOH; the term "imino" refers to the<br>
substituent HN=.<br>
Whenever the term "alkyl" or "aryl" or either of their prefix roots appear in a<br>
name of a substituent (e.g., arylalkyl, alkylamino) it shall be interpreted as<br>
including those limitations given above for "alkyl" and "aryl." Designated numbers<br>
of carbon atoms (e.g., C1-C6) shall refer independently to the number of carbon<br>
atoms in an alkyl moiety or to the alkyl portion of a larger substituent in which alkyl<br>
appears as its prefix root. However, for clarity in the terms "Cg-C-u benzo fused<br>
cycloalkyT, "C9-C14 benzo fused cycloalkenyl", "C9-C14 benzo fused aryl"; C9-C14<br>
refers to the number of carbon atoms both in the benzene ring (6) and the<br>
number of atoms in the ring fused to the benzene ring, but does not include<br>
carbon atoms that may be pendent from these multiple ring systems. The<br>
amount of substituents attached to a moiety "optionally substituted with one to five<br>
substituents" is limited to that amount of open valences on the moiety available<br>
for substitution.<br>
In general, under standard nomenclature rules used throughout this<br>
disclosure, the terminal portion of the designated side chain is described first<br>
followed by the adjacent functionality toward the point of attachment. Thus, for<br><br>
example, a "phenylCi-C6 alkylamidoCi-Cealkyl" substituent refers to a group of<br>
the formula: <br>
It is Intended that the definition of any substituent or variable at a<br>
particular location in a molecule be independent of its definitions elsewhere in<br>
that molecule. It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on<br>
the compounds of this invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily<br>
synthesized by techniques known in the art as well as those methods set forth<br>
herein.<br>
Illustrative of the invention is a composition comprising a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable earner and any of the compounds described above. Also illustrative of<br>
the invention is a composition made by mixing any of the compounds described<br>
above and a pharmaceutically acceptable earner. A further illustration of the<br>
invention is a process for making a composition comprising mixing any of the<br>
compounds described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The<br>
present invention also provides compositions comprising one or more compounds<br>
of this invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful serine protease<br>
inhibitors (in particular, inhibitors of cathepsin G and chymase) useful for treating<br>
inflammatory and serine protease mediated disorders. Some of these disorders<br>
include, inflammatory and serine protease mediated disorders include, and are<br>
not limited to, pulmonary inflammatory conditions, chronic obstructive pulmonary<br>
diseases, asthma, pulmonary emphysema, bronchitis, psoriasis, allergic rhinitis,<br>
viral rhinitis, ischemia, arthritis, glomerulonephritis, postoperative adhesion<br>
formation and reperfusion injury. These compounds would be useful in treating<br><br>
disease states caused by angiotensin II including but not limited to hypertension,<br>
hypercardia myocardial infarction, arteriosclerosis, diabetic and non-diabetic<br>
retinopathy, vascular restenosis and the like. Additionally, these compounds can<br>
be used for immune modulation. The utility of the compounds to treat<br>
inflammatory and serine protease mediated disorders can be determined<br>
according to the procedures described herein. '<br>
An embodiment of the invention is a method for treating inflammatory<br>
and serine protease mediated disorders in a subject in need thereof which<br>
comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of any<br>
of the compounds or compositions described above. Also included in the<br>
invention is the use of a compound of Formula (I) for the preparation of a<br>
medicament for treating an inflammatory or serine protease mediated disorder<br>
in a subject in need thereof. The term "treating" as used herein refers to a<br>
method for improving, halting, retarding or palliating an inflammatory or serine<br>
protease mediated disorder in the subject in need thereof. All such methods of<br>
treatment are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In accordance with the methods of the present invention, the individual<br>
components of the compositions described herein can also be administered<br>
separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in<br>
divided or single combination forms. The instant invention is therefore to be<br>
understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating<br>
treatment and the term "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
The term "subject" as used herein, refers to an animal (preferably, a<br>
mammal; most preferably, a human) who has been the object of treatment,<br>
observation or experiment.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein, means that<br>
amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or<br><br>
medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human, that is being sought by<br>
a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor, or other clinician, which includes<br>
alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.<br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a<br>
product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well<br>
as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the<br>
specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
To prepare the compositions of this invention, one or more compounds<br>
of Formula (I) or salt thereof as the active ingredient, is intimately admixed with<br>
a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical<br>
compounding techniques, which earner may take a wide variety of forms<br>
depending of the form of preparation desired for administration (e.g. oral or<br>
parenteral). Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well known in<br>
the art. Descriptions of some of these pharmaceutically acceptable carriers<br>
may be found in The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, published by the<br>
American Pharmaceutical Association and the Pharmaceutical Society of Great<br>
Britain.<br>
Methods of formulating compositions have been described in numerous<br>
publications such as Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets. Second Edition.<br>
Revised and Expanded. Volumes 1-3, edited by Lieberman et al;<br>
Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Parenteral Medications. Volumes 1-2, edited<br>
by Avis et al; and Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems. Volumes<br>

In preparing a composition of the present invention in liquid dosage form<br>
for oral, topical, inhalation/insufflation and parenteral administration, any of the<br>
usual pharmaceutical media or excipients may be employed. Thus, for liquid<br>
dosage forms, such as suspensions (i.e. colloids, emulsions and dispersions)<br><br>
and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include but are not limited to<br>
pharmaceutical^ acceptable wetting agents, dispersants, flocculation agents,<br>
thickeners, pH control agents (i.e. buffers), osmotic agents, coloring agents,<br>
flavors, fragrances, preservatives (i.e. to control microbial growth, etc.) and a<br>
liquid vehicle may be employed. Not all of the components listed above will be<br>
required for each liquid dosage form.<br>
In solid oral preparations such as, for example, powders, granules,<br>
capsules, caplets, gelcaps, pills and tablets (each including immediate release,<br>
timed release and sustained release formulations), suitable carriers and<br>
additives include but are not limited to diluents, granulating agents, lubricants,<br>
binders, glidants, disintegrating agents and the like. Because of their ease of<br>
administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral<br>
dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously<br>
employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated, gelatin coated, film coated<br>
or enteric coated by standard techniques.<br>
Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as<br>
tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, sterile parenteral<br>
solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules,<br>
autoinjector devices or suppositories for administration by oral, intranasal,<br>
sublingual, intraocular, transdermal, parenteral, rectal, vaginal, inhalation or<br>
insufflation means. Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form<br>
suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an<br>
insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be<br>
adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection.<br>
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active<br>
ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tabletting<br>
ingredients such as diluents, binders, adhesives, disintegrants, lubricants,<br>
antiadherents and glidants. Suitable diluents include, but are not limited to,<br><br>
starch (i.e. corn, wheat, or potato starch, which may be hydrolized), lactose<br>
(granulated, spray dried or anhydrous), sucrose, sucrose-based diluents<br>
(confectioner's sugar; sucrose plus about 7 to 10 weight percent invert sugar;<br>
sucrose plus about 3 weight percent modified dextrins; sucrose plus invert<br>
sugar, about 4 weight percent invert sugar, about 0.1 to 0.2 weight percent<br>
cornstarch and magnesium stearate), dextrose, inositol, mannitol, sorbitol,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose (i.e. AVICEL ™ microcrystalline cellulose available<br>
from FMC Corp.), dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate dihydrate, calcium<br>
lactate trihydrate and the like. Suitable binders and adhesives include, but are<br>
not limited to accacia gum, guar gum, tragacanth gum, sucrose, gelatin,<br>
glucose, starch, and cellulosics (i.e. methylcellulose, sodium<br>
carboxymethycellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, and the like), water soluble or dispersible binders (i.e.<br>
alginic acid and salts thereof, magnesium aluminum silicate,<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose [i.e. TYLOSE ™ available from Hoechst Celanese],<br>
polyethylene glycol, polysaccharide acids, bentonites, polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
polymethacrylates and pregelatinized starch) and the like. Suitable<br>
disintegrants include, but are not limited to, starches (corn, potato, etc.),<br>
sodium starch glycolates, pregelatinized starches, clays (magnesium aluminum<br>
silicate), celluloses (such as crosslinked sodium carboxymethylcellulose and<br>
microcrystalline cellulose), alginates, pregelatinized starches (i.e. com starch,<br>
etc.), gums (i.e. agar, guar, locust bean, karaya, pectin, and tragacanth gum),<br>
cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like. Suitable lubricants and<br>
antiadherents include, but are not limited to, stearates (magnesium, calcium<br>
and sodium), stearic acid, talc waxes, stearowet, boric acid, sodium chloride,<br>
DL-leucine, carbowax 4000, carbowax 6000, sodium oleate, sodium benzoate,<br>

Suitable gildants include, but are not limited to, talc, cornstarch, silica (i.e. CAB-<br>
O-SIL ™ silica available from Cabot, SYLOID ™ silica available from W.R.<br>
Grace/Davison, and AEROSIL ™ silica available from Degussa) and the like.<br>
Sweeteners and flavorants may be added to chewable solid dosage forms to<br><br>
improve the payability of the oral dosage form. Additionally, colorants and<br>
coatings may be added or applied to the solid dosage form for ease of<br>
identification of the drug or for aesthetic purposes. These carriers are<br>
formulated with the pharmaceutical active to provide an accurate, appropriate<br>
dose of the pharmaceutical active with a therapeutic release profile.<br>
Generally these carriers are mixed with the pharmaceutical active to<br>
form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of<br>
the pharmaceutical active of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof. Generally the preformulation will be formed by one of<br>
three common methods: (a) wet granulation, (b) dry granulation and (c) dry<br>
blending. When referring to these preformulation compositions as<br>
homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly<br>
throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided<br>
into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This<br>
solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of<br>
the type described above containing from about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg of<br>
the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills containing the<br>
novel compositions may also be formulated in multilayer tablets or pills to<br>
provide a sustained or provide dual-release products. For example, a dual<br>
release tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage<br>
component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The<br>
two components can be separated by an enteric layer, which serves to resist<br>
disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact<br>
into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be<br>
used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of<br>
polymeric materials such as shellac, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate<br>
phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, methacrylate and<br>
ethylacrylate copolymers and the like. Sustained release tablets may also be<br>
made by film coating or wet granulation using slightly soluble or insoluble<br><br>
substances in solution (which for a wet granulation acts as the binding agents)<br>
or low melting solids a molten form (which in a wet granulation may incorporate<br>
the active ingredient). These materials include natural and synthetic polymers<br>
waxes, hydrogenated oils, fatty acids and alcohols (i.e. beeswax, carnauba<br>
wax, cetyl alcohol, cetylstearyl alcohol, and the like), esters of fatty acids<br>
metallic soaps, and other acceptable materials that can be used to granulate,<br>
coat, entrap or otherwise limit the solubility of an active ingredient to achieve a<br>
prolonged or sustained release product.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention<br>
may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include, but are not<br>
limited to aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil<br>
suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil,<br>
sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar<br>
pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable suspending agents for aqueous<br>
suspensions, include synthetic and natural gums such as, acacia, agar,<br>
alginate (i.e. propylene alginate, sodium alginate and the like), guar, karaya,<br>
locust bean, pectin, tragacanth, and xanthan gum, cellulosics such as sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose, and combinations thereof, synthetic polymers such as<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbomer (i.e. carboxypolymethylene), and polyethylene<br>
glycol; clays such as bentonite, hectorite, attapulgite or sepiolite; and other<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agents such as lecithin, gelatin or the<br>
like. Suitable surfactants include but are not limited to sodium docusate,<br>
sodium lauryl sulfate, polysorbate, octoxynol-9, nonoxynol-10, polysorbate 20,<br>
polysorbate 40, polysorbate 60, polysorbate 80, polyoxamer 188, polyoxamer<br>
235 and combinations thereof. Suitable deflocculating or dispersing agent<br>
include pharmaceutical grade lecithins. Suitable flocculating agent include but<br>
are not limited to simple neutral electrolytes (i.e. sodium chloride, potassium,<br>
chloride, and the like), highly charged insoluble polymers and polyelectrolyte<br><br>
species, water soluble divalent or trivalent ions (i.e. calcium salts, alums or<br>
sulfates, citrates and phosphates (which can be used jointly in formulations as<br>
pH buffers and flocculating agents). Suitable preservatives include but are not<br>
limited to parabens (i.e. methyl, ethyl, /7-propyl and n-butyl), sorbicacid,<br>
thimerosal, quaternary ammonium salts, benzyl alcohol, benzoic acid,<br>
chlorhexidine gluconate, phenylethanol and the like. There are many liquid<br>
vehicles that may be used in liquid pharmaceutical dosage forms, however, the<br>
liquid vehicle that is used in a particular dosage form must be compatible with<br>
the suspending agent(s). For example, nonpolar liquid vehicles such as fatty<br>
esters and oils liquid vehicles are best used with suspending agents such as<br>
low HLB (Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance) surfactants, stearalkonium hectorite,<br>
water insoluble resins, water insoluble film forming polymers and the like.<br>
Conversely, polar liquids such as water, alcohols, polyols and glycols are best<br>
used with suspending agents such as higher HLB surfactants, clays silicates,<br>
gums, water soluble cellulosics, water soluble polymers and the like. For<br>
parenteral administration, sterile suspensions and solutions are desired. Liquid<br>
forms useful for parenteral administration include sterile solutions, emulsions and<br>
suspensions. Isotonic preparations which generally contain suitable<br>
preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is desired.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of the present invention can be administered in<br>
an intranasal dosage form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles or via<br>
transdermal skin patches, the composition of which are well known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery<br>
system, the administration of a therapeutic dose will, of course, be continuous<br>
rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in a form<br>
suitable for intranasal or inhalation therapy. For such therapy, compounds of<br>
the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of a solution or<br>
suspension from a pump spray container that is squeezed or pumped or as an<br><br>
aerosol spray from a pressurized container or a nebulizer (such as, a metered<br>
dose inhaler, a dry powder inhaler or other conventional or non-conventional<br>
modes or devices for inhalation delivery) using a suitable propellant (such as,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane,<br>
carbon dioxide or other suitable gas). In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the<br>
dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered<br>
amount. The pressurized container or nebulizer may contain a solution or<br>
suspension of the active compound. Capsules and cartridges (such as, those<br>
made from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated<br>
containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder<br>
base such as lactose or starch.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form<br>
of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar<br>
vesicles, multilamellar vesicles and the like. Liposomes can be formed from a<br>
variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, phosphatidylcholines<br>
and the like.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered by the use of<br>
monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules<br>
are coupled. The compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with<br>
soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include, but are<br>
not limited to polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer,<br>
polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidephenol, polyhydroxy-ethylaspartamidephenol,<br>
or polyethyl eneoxidepolylysine substituted with palmitoyl residue. Furthermore,<br>
the compounds of the present invention may be coupled to a class of<br>
biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for<br>
example, to homopolymers and copolymers (which means polymers containing<br>
two or more chemically distinguishable repeating units) of lactide (which<br>
includes lactic acid d-, I- and meso lactide), glycolide (including glycolic acid), e-<br>
caprolactone, p-dioxanone (1,4-dioxan-2-one), trimethylene carbonate (1,3-<br><br>

tetraoxacyclotetradecane-7,14-dione), 1,5-dioxepan-2-one, 6,6-dimethyH ,4-<br>
dioxan-2-one, polyorthoesters, poiyacetals, polydihydropyrans,<br>
polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of<br>
hydrogels and blends thereof.<br>
The therapeutically effective amount of a compound or composition<br>
thereof may be from about 0.001 mg/Kg/dose to about 300 mg/Kg/dose.<br>
Preferably, the therapeutically effective amount may be from about 0.001<br>
mg/Kg/dose to about 100 mg/Kg/dose. More preferably, the therapeutically<br>
effective amount may be from about 0.001 mg/Kg/dose to about 50<br>
mg/Kg/dose. Most preferably, the therapeutically effective amount may be from<br>
about 0.001 mg/Kg/dose to about 30 mg/Kg/dose. Therefore, the<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the active ingredient contained per dosage<br>
unit (e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, suppository, teaspoonful and the<br>
like) as described herein will be in the range of from about 1 mg/day to about<br>
21,000 mg/day for a subject, for example, having an average weight of 70 Kg.<br>
For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of<br>
tablets containing, 0.01, 0.05,0.1, 0.5,1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0,15.0, 25.0,50.0,100,<br>
150,200,250 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic<br>
adjustment of the dosage to the subject to be treated.<br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those<br>
skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of<br>
administration, the strength of the preparation, and the advancement of the<br>
disease condition. In addition, factors associated with the particular subject<br>
being treated, including subject age, weight, diet and time of administration, will<br>
result in the need to adjust the dose to an appropriate therapeutic level.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered in a<br><br>
single daily dose or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided<br>
doses of two, three or four times daily.<br>

General Synthetic Methods<br>
Representative compounds of the present invention can be synthesized in<br>
accordance with the general synthetic methods described below and are<br>
illustrated more particularly in the scheme that follows. Since the scheme is an<br>
illustration, the invention should not be construed as being limited by the<br>
chemical reactions and conditions expressed. The preparation of the various<br>
starting materials used in the schemes is well within the skill of persons versed<br>
in the art.<br>
Scheme A<br>
Scheme A is illustrative of a general method for the preparation of compounds<br><br>
of the invention by addition of a phosphonate or phosphinate anion, prepared<br>
from a phosphonate or phosphinate Compound A2, and an organometallic<br>
base such as /7-butyllithium, to an anhydride Compound A1 in a solvent such<br>
as THF to afford a ketophosphonate or ketophosphinate Compound A3,<br>
wherein Z is hydrogen, Y is not present and X is one oxygen substituent<br>
attached by a double-bond to the carbon in the position p to R4.<br>
Other compounds of the present invention may be obtained from Compound<br>
A3 using standard ketone manipulations wherein the p position carbon may be<br>
reduced from the ketone to a compound of Formula (I) wherein X and Y are<br>
both present or wherein Z is a bond. Examples of ketone manipulations<br>
include, but are not limited to, the use of 1) organometallic reagents to form<br>
alkoxy groups; 2) hydroxyl amines to form imino groups; and, 3) Lawesson's<br>
reagent to substitute a thio group in place of the ketone (with appropriate<br>
protecting groups added to the COOH group shown).<br>
Compound A2, wherein R6 is as previously defined, can be made according to<br>
known methods, such as those described in Katritsky, et. al., Org. Prep.<br>
Proced. Int., 1990, 22(2), 209-213; J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2002, 124, 9386-9387;<br>
and, Chem. Ber., 1963, 96, 3184-3194. In an embodiment of a general<br>
synthetic method, the Rs substitutent of Compound A4 is hydrogen and the R6<br>
substituted is ethoxy.<br>
Compound A2, wherein R4 is heteroaryl, can be prepared from commercially<br>
available or known haloalkyl substituted heteroaryl starting materials (such as<br>
3-bromomethyl-5-CI-benzothiophene used to prepare Cpd 33) using techniques<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Compound A3 may be coupled to the R1 portion of Formula (I) using standard<br>
coupling reactions. For example, when Rn is a secondary amine in a<br>
heterocyclyl ring, the nitrogen on the ring may be coupled to Compound A3<br><br>
(similar to the reaction shown in Scheme A, e.g. the ring nitrogen in Compound<br>
A4 would be coupled with Compound A8). Appropriate blocking groups can be<br>
employed to minimize undesirable side reactions. Analogous coupling<br>
reactions with Compound A3 can be performed when Ri is N(R7RB) to couple<br>
the substituted amine to the carboxylic acid of Compound A3. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention the coupling reaction of Compound A3<br>
with Ri when Ri is N(R7R8) and Rg is a heterocycle is provided to further<br>
illustrate the present invention.<br>
In Scheme A, the reaction of a suitably protected amino substituted heterocycle<br>
Compound A4 (wherein the protected amino is substituted with a hydrogen<br>
atom for R7 and an unsubstituted ad), heterocycle for R8) with a Q-substituted<br>
Raa Compound A5 (wherein Q is a suitable leaving group (such as , but not<br>
limited to, a halogen atom) and Rsa is a substituent as previously defined in the<br>
Ra ba).-bl) list) in a solvent such as DMF containing a base (such as, but not<br>
limited to, triethylamine) provided an Rab substituted Compound A6.<br>
In an embodiment of a general synthetic method, the heterocyclyl portion of<br>
Compound A4 was further substituted on a nitrogen ring atom by reaction with<br>
an acid chloride Compound A5, wherein the Q portion was chlorine and<br>
wherein the Raa portion was be), carbonyl substituted with an R8b substituent<br>
selected from Ci.8alkyl, aryl, aryl(Ci^)alkyl, aryl(C2^)alkenyl, heteroaryl,<br>
heteroaryl(Ci^)alkyl or heteroaryl(C2-8)alkenyl. In an alternate embodiment, the<br>
reaction may performed by reaction with an acid chloride Compound A5,<br>
wherein the Q portion is chlorine and wherein the Reaportion is bl). sulfonyl<br>
substituted with an R8b substituent; wherein R«b is as previously defined.<br>
Treatment of Compound A6 with a base such as potassium hydride followed by<br>
treatment with an R7X alkylating agent such as iodomethane in a solvent such<br>
as THF yielded Compound A7. The amine Compound A8 can be obtained<br>
from Compound A7 by removal of the Boc protecting group upon treatment<br><br>
with an acid such as TFA in a solvent such as CHfeCfe. The free base of<br>
Compound A8 is obtained upon treatment with a base such as aqueous<br>
Na2C03.<br>
Compound A9 can be prepared by a standard coupling procedure between<br>
Compound A3 and Compound A8 using routine reagents such as DCC and<br>
HOBT in a solvent such as CH3CN. Dealkylation of Compound A9 with reagent<br>
such as bromotrimethylsilane in a solvent such as pyridine, followed by<br>
treatment with dilute HCI afforded Compound A10 (wherein, in an embodiment<br>
of a general synthetic method, the R5 ethyl group and the F^ ethoxy group were<br>
replaced with hydrogen). A salt of Compound A10 such as target Compound<br>
A11 can be prepared by treating Compound A10 with a monobasic or dibasic<br>
amine such as tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane in a solvent system such as<br>
i-PrOH and water.<br><br><br><br>
Scheme B<br>
Scheme B is illustrative of an alternative general synthetic method for the<br>
preparation of compounds of the invention by addition of a Compound A2 (in<br>
an embodiment of an alternative general method, the R5 substituted of<br>
Compound A2 is ethyl and the R6 substituted is ethoxy) and R"M (wherein R"M<br>
represents an organometallic reagent such as LiHMDS (lithium<br><br>
hexamethyldisilylazide), lithium tetramethylpiperidide or NaHMDS (sodium PS -,<br>
hexamethyldisilazide)) to an anhydride Compound A1.<br>
The reaction is subsequently quenched with 6N HCI to a pH between 4 and 6<br>
to afford an enol Compound B1, wherein for a compound of Formula (I), 2 is a<br>
bond, Y is not present and X is one oxygen substituent attached by a single-<br>
bond to the carbon in the position p to R4. Other compounds of the present<br>
invention may be obtained from Compound B1 using standard ketone<br>
manipulation wherein the enol double bond may be reduced to the ketone;<br>
wherein for a compound of Formula (I), Y is not present and X is one oxygen<br>
substituent attached by a double-bond on the p position carbon. A coupling<br>
reagent (such as, but not limited to, chloroformates (such as, but not limited to,<br>
isobutyl chloroformate), cyanuric chloride, methanesulfonyl chloride, or diethyl<br>
chlorophosphate) may then be employed for ring closure to form a substituted<br>
lactone intermediate Compound B2 in the presence of a base such as, but not<br>
limited to, Et^N.<br>
Reaction of a dihydroxy substituted heterocycle Compound B3 (or other<br>
ketones and other protected ketones) with a Q-substituted R8a Compound A5 in<br>
a solvent (such as, but not limited to, CH2CI2, THF or mixtures thereof)<br>
containing a base (such as, but not limited to, sodium bicarbonate, potassium<br>
carbonate) provided an Rsb substituted Compound B4.<br>
Compound B4 was treated with R7NH2 in a solvent (such as, but not limited to,<br>
CH2CI2, THF or mixtures thereof) then subjected to reductive amination or<br>
hydrogenation using a hydride reducing agent (such as, but not limited to,<br>
NaBH(OAc)3, or hydrogenation with Pd, Pt or Ni catalyst). The free base of<br>
Compound A8 was obtained upon quenching the reaction with a base such as<br>
aqueous Na2C03.<br>
Compound A9 (in tautomeric equilibrium with Compound B6) was prepared by<br><br>
opening the 5-membered lactone ring intermediate Compound B2 with<br>
Compound A8 (or Compound B5, a salt of Compound A8) in the presence of<br>
DIEA (diisopropylethylamine) in a solvent (such as, but not limited to, acetone<br>
or MEK (methylethyl ketone)).<br>
Dealkylation of the equilibrium mixture of Compound A9-Compound B6 with a<br>
reagent (such as, but not limited to, TMSBr (bromotrimethylsilane) or TMSI) in<br>
a solvent (such as, but not limited to, CH3CN or pyridine), followed by<br>
recrystallization afforded Compound A10 (wherein the R5 ethyl group is<br>
replaced with hydrogen and the R6 ethoxy group is replaced with hydroxy). A<br>
salt of Compound A10 such as Compound A11 (and tautomers thereof) was<br>
prepared by treating Compound A10 with a diamine such as<br>
tris(hydroxyrnethyl)aminomethane in a solvent system such as a mixture of<br>
EtOH and water.<br><br><br><br>
Scheme C<br>
Scheme C is illustrative of an alternative method for the preparation of the<br>
intermediate Compound B2, wherein the enol Compound B1 is protonated to<br>
the free acid ketone Compound A3 by adjusting the pH to about pH 1, followed<br>
by intramolecular dehydration to provide the target lactone intermediate<br>
Compound B2. <br>
Scheme D is illustrative of a method for the preparation of an acid addition<br>
compound B5, wherein Compound A8 is reacted with an acid HA (such as, but<br>
not limited to, HCI, HBr or p-toluenesulfonic acid) to provide the target<br>
Compound B5 which may be carried forward in place of Compound A8 in the<br>
reaction with Compound B2.<br><br><br><br><br>
Compound E1 can be prepared from commercially available or known starting<br>
materials using techniques known to those of skill in the art.<br>

For Examplel, TLC was performed using Whatman 250-nm silica gel plates.<br>
Preparative TLC was performed with Analtech 1000-u.m silica gel GF plates.<br>
Flash column chromatography was conducted with flash column silica gel (40-<br>
63 urn) and column chromatography was conducted with standard silica gel.<br>
HPLC separations were carried out on three Waters PrepPak® Cartridges (25 x<br>
100 mm, Bondapak® C18, 15-20 urn, 125 A) connected in series; detection was<br>
at 254 nm on a Waters 486 UV detector. Analytical HPLC was carried out on a<br>
Supelcosil ABZ+PLUS column (5 cm x 2.1 mm), with detection at 254 nm on a<br>

Robertson Microlit Laboratories, Inc.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
about -20 °C using a dry ice-methanol cooling bath. A solution of 1M UHMDS<br>
(1597.0 mL, 1.597 mol) in THF was added to the cooled mixture while keeping<br>
the temperature at about -20 °C to form a fine slurry which was stirred for an<br>
additional 30 minutes. A 2,3-naphthalinedicarboxytic anhydride Compound 2A<br>
(158.80 gm, 0.7612 mol) was added portionwise over about a 1 h period while<br>
keeping the temperature of the mixture at about -20 CC. The addition funnel and<br>
flask walls were rinsed with THF (100.0 mL), the cooling bath was removed and<br>
the mixture temperature raised to about 5 °C for about 1.5 h. Once the reaction<br>
was complete (as shown by HPLC), the final pH of the mixture was adjusted to<br>
about pH 5 by slowly adding 6N HCI (422 mL, 2.34 mol) while the temperature of<br>
the mixture was maintained at about 5 °C. The mixture was stirred for about 30<br>
min more at about 5 °C to provide a crude product as a fine white solid. The<br>
crude product was filtered using a porcelain filter. The wet solid was then<br>
washed with water (1000.0 mL), left to filter overnight, then dried at 70 °C to<br>
provide a dilithium salt Compound 2C (365.1 gms; mass yield: 100.6%).<br>
Compound 2C was used in the next step without further purification.<br>
Methanol (2500.0 mL) and water (360.0 mL) were added to a flask and stirred.<br>
Compound 2C (365.1 gm, 0.7612 mol) was added to the stirring solution and<br>
the flask was rinsed with methanol (100.0 mL) to form a slurry. The slurry was<br>
stirred at RT for 30 minutes and then 12 N HCI (80.0 mL, 0.960 mol) was added<br>
over a 2 min period as the slurry turned into a hazy solution. The solution was<br>
stirred at RT until crystallization began, then was cooled to about 5 °C for 1 h to<br>
provide a crude product as a white granular solid. The product was filtered and<br>
washed with water (500.0 mL), then dried in vacuo overnight at a temperature<br>
of about 50 °C to provide Compound 2D (280 gms; mass yield: 77.3%).<br>
Compound 2D (199.8 gm) and THF (2 L) were combined in a flask, then<br>
agitated and cooled to a temperature of from about 0 °C to about 5 °C. NMM<br>
(4-methylmorpholine) (51.5 mL) was added to the flask while the mixture<br><br>
temperature was maintained at a temperature of from about 0 °C to about 5 °C.<br>
The mixture was then agitated for an additional 15 min or until a solution was<br>
obtained. IBCF (isobutylchloroformate) (56 mL) was added portionwise while<br>
the mixture temperature was maintained at a temperature of from about 0 °C to<br>
about 15 °C. When the addition was complete, the mixture temperature was<br>
warmed to a temperature of from about 20 °C to about 25 °C, then agitated for<br>
1 h. Once the reaction was complete, the NMM salts were filtered, washed<br>
with THF (150 mL) and allowed to dry. The filtrate was then combined with<br>
n-heptane (2.5 L) over a period of about 10 min and then agitated at a<br>
temperature of from about 20 °C to about 25 °C for about 30-45 min. Additional<br>
n-heptane (1.5 L) was added over a period of about 10 min. The mixture was<br>
then cooled to a temperature of from about 0 °C to about 5 °C and aged for<br>
about 1.5 h. The resulting suspension was filtered and washed with n-heptane<br>
(250 mL), allowed to air dry over a period of about 30 min and then dried in<br>
vacuo overnight at a temperature of from about 45 to about 50 °C to provide<br>
Compound 2E (165 gms; mass yield: 88.4%).<br>
DCM (dichloromethane) (600 mL) and a 2-naphthoyl chloride Compound 2F<br>
(189.0 gm) were combined in a flask and agitated until solubilized.<br>
4-Piperidone hydrate hydrochloride Compound 2G (150 g) and NaHC03<br>
(sodium hydrogen carbonate) (260.0 gms) were then added via addition funnel.<br>
DCM (300 mL) was used to rinse the funnel and the resulting mixture was<br>
agitated for 18 h. Once the reaction was complete (as shown by HPLC), water<br>
(2.6 L) was added to the flask and the mixture was stirred vigorously to dissolve<br>
the NaHC03. After a period of about 5 to about 10 minutes, the layers were<br>
allowed to separate over a period of about 30 minutes. The aqueous layer was<br>
removed. Saturated aqueous NaHC03 (300 mL) was again added and the<br>
mixture agitated for a period of about 5 to about 10 min. The layers were<br>
allowed to separate over a period of about 30 min and the aqueous layer was<br>
removed. Water (300 mL) was added and the mixture stirred gently for a<br>
period of from about 5 to about 10 min. The layers were allowed to separate<br><br>
over a period of about 30 min and the organic layer (-960 mL) containing<br>
Compound 2H was removed (concentration of Compound 2H in DCM: 235.98<br>
mg/ mL; calculated mass of Compound 2H in DCM: 226.54 gms; calculated<br>
mass yield: 93.46%).<br>
Compound 2H (~50 gms, -265 mg/mL in DCM) and acetic acid (4.9 mL) were<br>
combined in a flask and the mixture was cooled to a temperature of from about<br>
0 °C to about 5 °C. 2.0M MeNH2 (methylamine) (296 mL) in THF was added<br>
portionwise while maintaining the mixture at a temperature of from about 0 °C<br>
to about 19 °C. The mixture was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and<br>
was agitated for a period of about 30 min. NaBH(OAc)3 (sodium<br>
triacetoxyborohydride) (51.4 gms) was then added portionwise while<br>
maintaining the solution at a temperature of from about 19 °C to about 27 °C.<br>
The mixture was aged for about 40 min at a temperature of from about ambient<br>
to about 27°C. Once the reaction was complete (as shown by HPLC), water<br>
(500 mL) was added while maintaining the solution at a temperature of below<br>
about 30 °C. Sodium hydroxide (115 mL; 5% w/v in water) was then added to<br>
the mixture to raise the pH to from about pH 10 to about pH 11. The mixture<br>
was agitated vigorously for a period of from about 3 to about 10 min. The<br>
layers were separated and the aqueous layer was removed. Water (143 mL)<br>
was added and the mixture agitated for a period of from about 3 to about 10<br>
min. The layers were again separated and the organic layer containing<br>
Compound 21 was removed (concentration of Compound 21 in DCM: 0.229 mg/<br>
mL; calculated mass of Compound 21 in DCM: 45.18 gms; mass yield: 85.3%).<br>
Compound 21 (150 mL, 0.069 mol) was placed in solution with CH2CI2:THF (150<br>
mL; 1:8) and concentrated to a thick oil in vacuo while maintaining the mixture<br>
at a temperature of about or below 40°C using a cooling bath. 2-Butanone<br>
(320 mL) was added portionwise to the thick oil to transfer the oil to another<br>
flask. The mixture was agitated and EtN(/-Pr)2 (diisopropylethylamine) (11.0<br>
mL, 0.063 mol) and Compound 2E (27.3 gms, 0.057 mol) were added. The<br><br>
mixture was heated to a temperature of about 65 °C for a period of from about<br>
6 to about 7 h. Once the reaction was complete (as shown by HPLC), the<br>
mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and crystallized over a period of<br>
from about 72 to about 96 h (the product can take up to 48 h to start to<br>
crystallizing, having a cloud point time around 28 h). The product was filtered<br>
and washed with acetone (2X 10 mL) (each wash), then dried in vacuo<br>
overnight at a temperature of about 75 °C to provide Compound 2J (31.4 gms;<br>
yield: 75.1%) as a white powder.<br>
Compound 2J (10.0 g) and acetonitrile (40 mL) under nitrogen were added to a<br>
flask to form a suspension. The suspension was agitated for a period of from<br>
about 5 to about 10 min, then bromotrimethylsilane (10 mL) was added via<br>
additional funnel over a period of from about 10 to about 15 min at RT. The<br>
solution was stirred for at least a time period of about 1 h at rt. Once the<br>
reaction was complete (as shown by HPLC), the mixture was transferred to an<br>
addition funnel and then added to water (250 mL). The resulting slurry was<br>
stirred vigorously during the addition and the temperature maintained at from<br>
about 20 °C to about 25 °C. The slurry was further agitated over a period of<br>
from about 1 to about 1.5 h, then filtered and washed with water (2X15 mL).<br>
The resulting wet cake was then dried in vacuo overnight at a temperature of<br>
about 40 °C to provide a crude product Compound 2K (10.2 gms) as a white<br>
solid.<br>
Compound 2K (110.0 gms, 0.127 mol) and methanol (550 mL) were added to a<br>
flask to form a slurry. The slurry was stirred at RT over a period of from about<br>
55 to about 60 min (the recrystallization mixture gave a hazy solution within<br>
about 5 minutes after adding MeOH and gradually afforded a white suspension<br>
after about 30 minutes). An acetone:water (1100 mL; 4:1) solution was added<br>
and the suspension was stirred at RT for a period of from about 180 to about<br>
190 min to afford a white solid. The solid was filtered and washed with water (3<br>
X 350 mL), forming a wet cake was then dried in vacuo overnight at a<br><br>
temperature of from about 30 to about 35 °C to provide a recrystallized<br>
Compound 2K (82.3 gms; yield: 96.1 %) as a fine white solid.<br>
Recrystallized Compound 2K (30.0 g, 0.0431 mol) and<br>
tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (13.07 g, 0.107 mol; a clear white crystalline<br>
solid) were combined in a flask and ethanol (300 mL) and water (30 mL) were<br>
added. The solution was agitated to provide a clear solution after a period of<br>
about 15 min. A thin suspension was formed after a period of from about 2 to<br>
about 3 h and a thick white suspension was formed after a period of from about<br>
3 to about 5 h (the mixture may need to be seeded to enhance crystallization if<br>
a thin suspension is not formed after a period of about 3 h). The suspension<br>
was stirred at RT for an additional period of about 4 h. The thick suspension<br>
was thinned by adding ethanol (180 mL), then filtered and washed with ethanol<br>
(120 mL), allowed to air dry over a period of about 30 min and then dried in<br>
vacuo for a time period of from about 24 to about 67 h at a temperature of<br>
about 40 °C to provide Compound 2E (38.6 gms; yield: 91.8%) as a bis-<br>
tromethane salt (ratio of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane:Compound 2E:<br>
1.99:1).<br>

Biological Experimental Examples<br>
The utility of the compounds of the present invention as a serine protease<br>
inhibitor and, particularly, as a cathepsin G or chymase inhibitor useful for the<br>
treatment of inflammatory or serine protease mediated disorders can be<br>
determined according to the procedures described herein.<br>
Example 1<br>
Enzyme-Catalyzed Hydrolysis Assays - Cathepsin G<br>
Enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis rates were measured spectrophotometrically<br>
using human neutrophil"cathepsin G (Athens Research and Technology) or<br>
human skin chymase (Cortex Biochem), a chromogenic substrate (Suc-Ala-Ala-<br>
Pro-Phe-pNa) (Bachem) in aqueous buffer (100 mM Hepes, 500 mM NaCI, pH<br>
7.4 for catG; 450 mM Tris, 1800 mM NaCI, pH 8.0 for chymase), and a<br>
microplate reader (Molecular Devices). IC50 experiments were conducted by<br>
fixing the enzyme and substrate concentrations (70 nM enzyme, 5 mM<br>
substrate for cat G, 10 nM enzyme, 0.7 mM substrate for chymase) and varying<br>
the inhibitor concentration. Changes in absorbance at 405 nM were monitored<br>
using the software program Softmax (Molecular Devices), upon addition of<br>
enzyme, with and without inhibitor present at 37CC for 30 minutes. Percent<br>
inhibition was calculated by comparing the initial reaction slopes of the samples<br>
without inhibitor to those with inhibitor. IC50 values were determined using a<br><br><br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
Anti-Asthmatic Effects in a Sheep Model of Asthma<br>
The efficacy of Compound 2 for the treatment of asthma was evaluated in a<br>
validated model of Ascaris suum antigen-induced asthmatic response in<br>
conscious sheep (Abraham, W.M., Pharmacology of allergen-induced early and<br>
late airway responses and antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in<br>
allergic sheep, Pulmonary Pharmacology, 1989, 2, 33-40).<br>
Experimental Protocol<br>
Baseline dose response curves to aerosol carbachol were obtained 1-3 days<br>
prior to antigen challenge. Baseline values of specific lung resistance (SRL)<br>
were obtained and the sheep were then given a specified amount (mg) of the<br>
test compound as an inhaled aerosol at a specified time before antigen<br>
challenge. Post drug measurements of SRL were obtained and the sheep were<br><br>
then challenged with Ascan's suum antigen. Measurements of SRL were<br>
obtained immediately after challenge, hourly from 1-6 h after challenge and on<br>
the half-hour from 6!4-8 h after challenge. Measurements of SRL were<br>
obtained 24 h after challenge followed by a 24 h post-challenge with carbachol<br>
to measure airway hyperreactivity.<br>
Compound 2 was administered as an aerosol at 0.1 mg/Kg/dose, twice-a-day<br>
(BID) for three consecutive days, followed by a dose on day 4, 0.5 h prior to<br>
antigen challenge. Ascaris suum antigen challenge was given at the zero time<br>
point.<br>
Figure 1 shows that the early airway response (0-2 h after antigen challenge)<br>
was dramatically reduced and that the late airway response (6-8 h after antigen<br>
challenge) was completely blocked (n = 4 sheep/group).<br>
Figure 2 shows that the delayed airway hyperreactivity measured at 24 h post<br>
antigen challenge as measured using carbachol challenge was also completely<br>
blocked.<br>
In addtion to blocking the increase in airway resistance, as shown in Table 5,<br>
Compound 2 also blocked the rise in inflammatory cell numbers in the broncho-<br>
alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid sampled from these sheep.<br><br><br><br><br>
