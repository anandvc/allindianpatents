Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a 2-haloimidazole compound useful as an intermediate for pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals, an intermediate for dyes, and the like.<br>
Background Art<br>
In Patent Document 1, as a process for producing a 2-haloimidazole compound, a synthetic method represented by the reaction scheme (A) of chem 1 is disclosed.  In Patent Document 2, a synthetic method represented by the reaction scheme (B) of chem 2 is disclosed.  In Patent Document 3, a synthetic method represented by the reaction scheme (C) of chem 3 is disclosed.<br>

(Scheme Removed)<br>
[Chem 2] Reaction Scheme   (B)<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
[Chem 3]<br>
Reaction Scheme (C)<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
However, in the synthetic method represented by the reaction scheme (A), there is a problem that n-BuLi which must be handled with care should be employed.  In the synthetic method represented by the reaction scheme (B), there is a problem that the 2-imidazolone compound to be<br>
used as a raw material is expensive and further the reaction yield of the 2-chloroimidazole compound as a product is low.  In the synthetic method represented by the reaction scheme (C), there is a drawback that an expensive catalyst such as platinum or palladium-based one should be used in the case of using a hydrogen gas as a reducing agent for an iodinated imidazole compound as an intermediate.  Moreover, in the case where a sulfite salt is used instead of the above hydrogen gas, there is a problem that the separation and isolation of the 2-bromoimidazole compound as an objective product require time and labor since the regioselectivity of the dehalogenation reaction is low and a 2-debrominated imidazole compound is produced in a large amount as a byproduct .<br>
