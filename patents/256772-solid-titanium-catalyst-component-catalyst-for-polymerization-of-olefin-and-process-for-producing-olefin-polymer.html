SOLID TITANIUM CATALYST COMPONENT, CATALYST FOR POLYMERIZATION OF OLEFIN AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING OLEFIN POLYMER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a solid titanium catalyst component which is preferably used for polymerization of an a-olefin having 3 or more carbon atoms, to a catalyst for olefin polymerization containing the solid titanium catalyst component, and to a process for producing an olefin polymer using the catalyst for olefin polymerization.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As the catalysts for producing an olefin polymer such as a homopolymer of ethylene or an a-olefin, and a copolymer of ethylene and an a-olefin, the catalysts containing a titanium compound supported on magnesium halide in the active state have been conventionally known (hereinafter, the term "polymerization" may be described to encompass both of "homopolymerization" and "copolymerization").<br>
As the catalyst for olefin polymerization, a catalyst containing titanium tetrachloride or titanium trichloride, which is called a Ziegler-Natta catalyst, a catalyst composed of a solid titanium catalyst component comprising magnesium,<br>
titanium, halogen and an electron donor, and an organometallic compound, and the like have been widely known.<br>
The latter catalyst exhibits high activity in the polymerization of α-olefins such as propylene and butene-1, in addition to ethylene. Also, the obtained α-olefin polymer may have high stereoregularity.<br>
It is reported that when among these catalysts, in particular, a catalyst comprising a solid titanium catalyst component having an electron donor, supported thereon, selected from carboxylic acid esters, typically exemplified by phthalic acid esters, and as a co-catalyst component, an aluminum-alkyl compound, and a silicon compound having at least one Si-OR (wherein R is a hydrocarbon group) is used, excellent polymerization activity and stereospecif icity are exhibited in JP-A No. 57-63310 (Patent Document 1), etc.<br>
The obtained polymers obtained by using the above-described catalyst often have narrower molecular weight distributions, as compared with the polymers obtained by using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst.  It is known that the polymers having narrow molecular weight distributions tend to have "low melt flowability", "low melt tension", "poor moldability", "slightly low rigidity", or the like. On the other hand, from the standpoints of improvement of productivity, reduction in cost, or the like, various high speed molding technologies such<br>
as, for example, high speed stretching technologies aimed at improvement of productivity of the stretched film, have evolved.<br>
When the polymers having relatively narrow molecular weight distributions as described above are to be stretched at a high speed, for example, the neck-in or flapping of the films may become more remarkable due to shortage of melt tension, and thus it becomes difficult to improve the productivity. Therefore, the polymers having higher melt tensions are demanded by the market.<br>
In order to solve these problems, there have been many reports on a method for broadening the molecular weight distributions of the polymers by producing the polymers having different molecular weights by means of a multi-stage polymerization (JP-A No. 5-170843 (Patent Document 2)), a catalyst comprising plural kinds of electron donors (JP-A No. 3-7703 (Patent Document 3)) , a catalyst using a succinic acid ester having an asymmetric carbon as the electron donor contained in the solid titanium catalyst component (pamphlet of International Publication WO 01/057099 (Patent Document 4) , pamphlet of International Publication WO 00/63261 (Patent Document 5) , pamphlet of International Publication WO 02/30998 (Patent Document 6)), and the like.<br>
On the other hand, JP-A No. 2001-114811 (Patent Document<br>
7) and JP-A No. 2003-40918 (Patent Document 8) disclose a solid catalyst component for olefin(s) polymerization, which is obtained by bringing into contact with a titanium compound, a magnesium compound and an electron-donating compound, and a catalyst for olefin(s) polymerization comprising the catalyst component. As the electron-donating compound, 1, 2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid esters having a purity of the trans-isomers of 80% or more are used in the invention as described in Patent Document 7; and cyclohexenedicarboxylic acid diesters are used in the invention as described in Patent Document 8. As the specific example of these cyclohexenedicarboxylic acid diesters,<br>
1-cyclohexenedicarboxylic acid diester only is disclosed, in which the alkoxycarbonyl group is bonded to the 1-position and the 2-position of the cyclohexene ring of 1-cyclohexene (paragraphs [0021] to [0024], and Examples). However, Patent Documents 7 and 8 have no description on the molecular weight distributions of the olefin polymers.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
However, the above-described catalyst has been the catalysts which have an insufficient effect of broadening the molecular weight distribution of the olefin polymer, and according to the investigation conducted by the present inventors, broaden the molecular weight distribution by increasing the content of the low molecular weight components. On the other hand, as evaluated from the market, it cannot be said that the catalysts provide sufficient improvement of the melt tension of the olefin polymer . Further, from the viewpoint of reduction in the cost, appearance of a catalyst which makes it possible to produce an olefin polymer having a molecular weight distribution broadened by means of a simpler process is demanded by the market.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a catalyst component and a catalyst which are capable of conveniently producing an olefin polymer having a broad molecular weight distribution and a high melt tension, and being<br>

The reason for this is that these compounds have high catalytic performances, and can be prepared using a Diels Alder reaction at a relatively low cost.<br>
These compounds may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds thereof. Further, these cyclic ester compounds (a) may be used in combination with a catalyst component (b) or a catalyst component (c) as described below, as long as it does not give any adverse effect on the purpose of the invention.<br>
Further, the cyclic ester compound (a) may be formed during the process of producing the solid titanium catalyst component (I) .  For example, when the solid titanium catalyst component (I) is produced, the cyclic ester compound (a) can be contained in the solid titanium catalyst component by involving a process of substantially bringing an anhydrous carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid dihalide corresponding to a catalyst component (a), and a corresponding alcohol into contact with each other.<br>
By the process for producing an olefin polymer of the invention, a polymer having a broad molecular weight distribution can be obtained. The reason for this is unclear at present, but is assumed to be as follows.<br>
It is known that the cyclic hydrocarbon structures form<br>
a variety of steric structures such as a chair conformation and a boat conformation.  In addition, when the cyclic structure has a substituent, variation of the steric structure which can be taken further increases.  If the bond between a carbon atom bonded with an ester group (COOR1 group) and another carbon atom bonded with an ester group (COOR1 group) among the carbon atoms constituting the cyclic backbone of the cyclic ester compound (a) is a single bond, variation of the steric structure which can be taken increases. These various steric structures which can be taken lead to the formation of various active species on the solid titanium catalyst component (I) . As a result, when the olefin polymerization is carried out by using the solid titanium catalyst component (I), the olefin polymers having various molecular weights can be prepared at one time, that is, the olefin polymers having broad molecular weight distributions can be prepared.<br>

[Process for producing olefin polymer] The process for producing an olefin polymer according to the invention is characterized in that it comprises polymerizing an olefin by using the catalyst for olefin polymerization of the invention. In the invention, the term "polymerization" may encompass copolymerization such as random copolymerization and block copolymerization, as well as homopolymerization.<br>
For the process for producing an olefin polymer of the invention, it is also possible that polymerization is carried out in the presence of a prepolymerization catalyst obtained by prepolymerization of an a-olefin in the presence of the catalyst for olefin polymerization of the invention. This prepolymerization is carried out by prepolymerization of an a-olefin in an amount of 0.1 to 1000 g, preferably 0.3 to 500 g, and particularly preferably 1 to 200 g, based on 1 g of the catalyst for olefin polymerization.<br>
The concentration of the catalyst in the prepolymerization system may be higher than that in the polymerization system.<br>
In the prepolymerization, the concentration of the solid titanium catalyst component (I) is in the range of preferably about 0.001 to 200 mmol, more preferably about 0.01 to 50 mmol, and particularly preferably 0.1 to 20 mmol, in terms of titanium 5  atom, based on 1 liter of the liquid medium.<br>
In the prepolymerization, the amount of the organometallic compound catalyst component (II) may be such that 0.1 to 1,000 g, and preferably 0 . 3 to 500 g of the polymer is produced, based on 1 g of the solid titanium catalyst 10 component (I), and the amount is preferably about 0.1 to 300 mol, more preferably about 0.5 to 100 mol, and particularly preferably 1 to 50 mol, based on 1 mol of the titanium atom in the solid titanium catalyst component (I).<br>
In the prepolymerization, the catalyst component (III) 15  may be used, if necessary, and these components are used in an amount of 0.1 to 50 mol, preferably 0.5 to 30 mol, and particularly preferably 1 to 10 mol, based on 1 mol of the titanium atom in the solid titanium catalyst component (I) . The prepolymerization can be carried out under the mild 20  condition by adding an olefin and the above-described catalyst components to an inert hydrocarbon medium.<br>
In this case, specific examples of the inert hydrocarbon medium to be used include aliphatic hydrocarbons such as propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, decane, dodecane and<br>
kerosene;<br>
alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cycloheptane, cycloheptane, methylcycloheptane, 4-cycloheptane, 4-cycloheptane and methyl-4-cycloheptane; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene;<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons such as ethylene chloride and chlorobenzene ;<br>
and a mixture thereof. 10       Among these inert hydrocarbon media, aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons are particularly preferably used. As such, when the inert hydrocarbon medium is used, it is preferable that the prepolymerization is carried out batchwise.<br>
On the other hand, the prepolymerization may be carried 15  out by using olefin itself as a solvent, and substantially without a solvent.  In this case, it is preferable that the prepolymerization is carried out continuously.<br>
The olef ins used in the prepolymerization may be the same or different from those used in the polymerization as described 20  below, and specifically, it is preferably propylene.<br>
The temperature for prepolymerization is in the range of preferably about -20 to +100°C, more preferably about -20 to +80°C, and even more preferably 0 to +40°C.<br>
Next, the polymerization after the afore-mentioned<br>
prepolymerization or without prepolymerization will be described.<br>
Examples of the olefins which can be used (that is,<br>
polymerized) for the polymerization include a-olefins having 5  3 to 20 carbon atoms, for example, linear olefins such as propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene, 1-tetradecene, 1-hexadecene, 1-octadecene and 1-eicosene; and branched olefins such as 4-methyl-l-pentene, 3-methyl-l-pentene and 3-methyl-l-butene, and preferred are<br>
10  propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene and 4-methyl-l-pentene.<br>
Further, particularly preferred are propylene, 1-butene and 4-methyl-l-pentene, from the viewpoint that the polymer having a broader molecular weight distribution easily exhibits its advantages for the resin with high rigidity.<br>
Along with these a-olefins, ethylene; aromatic vinyl compounds such as styrene and allylbenzene; or alicyclic vinyl compounds such as vinylcyclohexane and vinylcycloheptane can be used. Furthermore, the compound having a polyunsaturated bond such as, for example, conjugated dienes or nonconjugated<br>
dienes, for example, dienes such as cyclopentene, cycloheptene, norbornene, tetracyclododecene, isoprene and butadiene can be used as the polymerization materials together with ethylene and an cc-olefin. These compounds may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds thereof.  (Hereinafter,<br>
the olefins to be used together with the "a-olefin<br>
having 3 to 20 carbon atoms" may be also referred to as "other olefins").<br>
Among such other olefins, preferred are ethylene and the aromatic vinyl compounds.  Further, small amount, for example, 10% by weight or less, and preferably 5% by weight, based on 100% by weight of the total amount of olefins, of the other olefins such as ethylene may be used in combination therewith. According to the invention, the prepolymerization and the polymerization can be carried out in any of liquid phase polymerizations such as bulk polymerization, solution polymerization and suspension polymerization, and vapor phase polymerization.<br>
When slurry polymerization is employed for the polymerization, the inert hydrocarbons used in the prepolymerization as described above, or an olefin which is liquid at a reaction temperature can be used as a reaction solvent.<br>
In the polymerization in the process for producing the polymer of the invention, the above-described solid titanium catalyst component (I) is used in an amount of usually about 0.0001 to 0.5 mmol, and preferably about 0.005 to 0.1 mmol, in terms of titanium atom, based on 1 liter of the polymerization volume. Further, the above-described organometallic compound<br>
catalyst component (II) is used in an amount of usually about 1 to 2000 mol, and preferably about 5 to 500 mol, in terms of titanium atom in the prepolymerization catalyst component in the polymerization system. The above-described catalyst component (III), if used, is used in an amount of 0.001 to 50 mol, preferably 0. 01 to 30 mol, and particularly preferably 0.05 to 20 mol in the organometallic compound catalyst component (II).<br>
If the polymerization is carried out in the presence of hydrogen, the molecular weight of the obtained polymer can be controlled to obtain a polymer with a high melt flow rate.<br>
In the polymerization according to the invention, the polymerization temperature of olefins is in the range of usually about 20 to 200°C, preferably about 30 to 100°C, and more preferably about 50 to 90°C. The pressure is set to be in the range of usually ambient pressure to 100 kgf/cm2 (9.8 MPa) , and preferably about 2 to 50 kgf/cm2 (0.20 to 4.9 MPa).  In the process for producing a polymer of the invention, the polymerization can be carried out by any of batchwise, semi-continuous and continuous processes. Further, the polymerization can be carried out in two or more stages under different reaction conditions. When the multi-stage polymerization is carried out, it is possible to further broaden the molecular weight distribution of the olefin polymer.<br>
Thus obtained olefin polymer may be any one of a homopolymer, a random copolymer, a block copolymer, and the like.<br>
If the polymerization of an olefin, in particular the polymerization of propylene is carried out by using the catalyst for olefin polymerization, a propylene polymer with high stereoregularity which has a content of the decane-insoluble components of 70% or more, preferably 85% or more, and particularly preferably 90% or more is obtained.<br>
Further, according to the process for producing an olefin polymer of the invention, even when the polymerization is carried out in a small number of stages, for example, one stage, rather than in multi-stages, a polyolefin, in particular polypropylene, having a broad molecular weight distribution can be obtained. The process for producing an olefin polymer of the invention is characterized in that an olefin polymer may be often obtained, which has a higher ratio of the high molecular weight components and a lower ratio of the low molecular weight components (particularly referred to as "Beta" components (sticky components) ) , as compared with the conventional olefin polymers having the same melt flow rate (MFR) as the present olefin polymer. These characteristics can be confirmed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurement described below, and a polymer having both of a high Mw/Mn value and a high Mz/Mw<br>
value can be obtained.<br>
The conventional polypropylene obtained by using a solid titanium catalyst component comprising magnesium, titanium, halogen and an electron donor generally has an Mw/Mn value of 5 or less and an Mz/Mw value of less than 4, which are indicators of the molecular weight distribution as determined by GPC measurement, for example, in the region with an MFR of 1 to 10 g/10 min. However, according to the process for producing an olefin polymer of the invention, an olefin polymer having an Mw/Mn value of 6 to 30, and preferably 7 to 20 can be obtained under the same polymerization conditions as described above. Further, an olefin polymer having an Mz/Mw value of preferably 4 to 15, and more preferably 4.5 to 10 can be obtained. Particularly, according to the process for producing an olefin polymer of the invention, a polymer having a high Mz/Mw value can be often obtained.<br>
It is commonly known to a skilled person in the art that polypropylene having a high Mw/Mn value is excellent in moldability and rigidity. On the other hand, a high Mz/Mw value indicates a high content of high molecular weight components, and thus it is expected that the obtained propylene has high melt tension and excellent moldability.<br>
When the process for producing an olefin polymer of the invention is used, a polymer having a broad molecular weight<br>
distribution can be obtained even without the use of multi-stage polymerization, and thus it is possible to make the apparatus for producing a polymer simpler.  Further, when the conventional multi-stage polymerization is applied, it is expected that a polymer with more excellent melt tension and moldability can be obtained.<br>
As other methods for obtaining a polymer having a broad molecular weight distribution, the methods of dissolving and mixing, or dissolving and kneading the polymers having different molecular weights can be employed, but the polymers obtained by these methods may have insufficient in improvement on melt tension or moldability, while involving relatively complicated operations. The reason for this is presumed that the polymers having different molecular weights are basically difficult to be mixed with each other. On the other hand, since the polymers obtained by means of the process for producing an olefin polymer of the invention are mixture of the polymers having extremely broad, different molecular weights in a catalytic level, that is, a nano-level, it is expected that they have high melt tension and excellent moldability.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Hereinbelow, the present invention will be described with reference to Examples, but it should be not construed that the<br>
invention is limited to these Examples.<br>
In the following Examples, the bulk specific gravity, the melt flow rate, the content of the decane-soluble (insoluble) components, the molecular weight distribution, or the like of the propylene polymer were measured by the methods described below.<br>
(1)  Bulk specific gravity:<br>
The bulk specific gravity was measured in accordance with JIS K-6721.<br>
(2)  Melt flow rate (MFR):<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) was measured in accordance with ASTM D 1238E at a measurement temperature of 230°C in the case of a propylene polymer, and 260°C in the case of a 4-methyl-l-pentene polymer.<br>
(3)  Content of decane-soluble (insoluble) components: Into the glass container for measurement were introduced<br>
about 3 g (measurement was made in the order of 10"4 g, and the weight was represented by b (g) in the following equation) of a propylene polymer, 500 ml of decane, and a small amount of a heat-resistant stabilizer soluble in decane, and the mixture was stirred with a stirrer while elevating the temperature to 150°C over 2 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere to dissolve the propylene polymer, maintained at 150°C for 2 hours, and then slowly cooled to 23°C over 8 hours. The solution containing<br>
the obtained precipitates of the propylene polymer was filtered under reduced pressure with a glass filter of a 25G-4 specification manufactured by Iwata glass Co., Ltd.  100 ml of the filtrate was taken and dried under reduced pressure to obtain a portion of the decane-soluble components, the weight of which was measured in the order of 10~4 g (this weight was represented by a (g) in the following equation). After this operation, the amount of the decane-soluble components was determined by the following equation:<br>
Content of decane-soluble components = 100 x (500 x a)/(100 x b)<br>
Content of decane-insoluble components = 100 - 100 x (500 x a)/(100 x b)<br>
(4) Molecular weight distribution:<br>
The Mw/Mn value and the Mz/Mw value were calculated by analyzing, using a well-known method, the chromatogram obtained by the measurement under the following conditions. The measurement time per one sample was 60 minutes.<br>
Liquid chromatograph: ALC/GPC 150-C plus type manufactured by Waters Co., Ltd. (Integrated type differential refractometer-detector)<br>
Column: GMH6-HT x 2 and GMH6-HTL x 2 manufactured by Tosoh Corporation connected in series<br>
Mobile phase medium: o-dichlorobenzene<br>
Flow rate: 1.0 ml/min Measurement temperature: 140°C<br>
Process for producing calibration curve: Using standard polystyrene sample<br>
Concentration of sample: 0.10% (w/w)<br>
Amount of sample solution: 500 p,l<br>
(5) Melt tension:<br>
Using an apparatus for measurement of melt tension provided with an equipment for measurement of melt tension in a Capirograph "IB" type apparatus manufactured by Toyo Seiki Seisaku-sho, Ltd., the strand of the sample resin, melted for 6 minutes in the cylinder at 230°C (under a nitrogen atmosphere) in the apparatus, was extruded through a nozzle having a length of 8 mm and a diameter of 2.095 mm with a piston. The extrusion speed of the piston was 15 mm/min. This strand was pulled out in the shape of a filament, and wound up using a roller at a predetermined speed through a pulley provided with the load cell. At this time, the stress force as defected with the load cell was referred to a melt tension.<br>
In addition, as the compound corresponding to the above-described cyclic ester compound (α), a product synthesized by AZUMA-Japan, Inc. was used unless specifically mentioned otherwise. The purities of the isomers of trans- and cis-conformation are both 95% or more unless specifically<br>
mentioned otherwise.<br>
Example 1<br>
(Production of solid titanium catalyst component (αl) A high speed stirring device having an internal volume<br>
of 2 liters (manufactured by Tokushu Kika Kogyo Co., Ltd.) was<br>
sufficiently purged with nitrogen, and 700 ml of purified decane,<br>
10 g of commercial available magnesium chloride, 24.2 g of<br>
ethanol and 3 g of Leodol (trade name) SP-S20 (sorbitan<br>
distearate, manufactured by Kao Corporation) were charged<br>
thereinto. While stirring this suspension, the temperature of<br>
the system was elevated and the suspension was stirred at 120°C<br>
and 800 rpm for 30 minutes.   Then, this suspension was<br>
transferred to a 2-liter glass flask (equipped with a stirrer)<br>
which was previously charged with 1 liter of purified decane<br>
cooled to -10°C by using a Teflon (registered trade mark) tube<br>
having an inner diameter of 5 mm under high speed stirring so<br>
as not to generate the precipitates. The solid obtained from<br>
liquid transferring was filtered and sufficiently washed with<br>
purified n-hexane to obtain a solid adduct in which 2.8 mol of<br>
ethanol is coordinated to 1 mol of magnesium chloride.<br>
46.2 mmol of the solid adduct, in terms of magnesium atom, which was suspended in 30 ml of decane, was wholly introduced into 200 ml of titanium tetrachloride which was maintained at<br>
-20°C, under stirring. The temperature of the mixture was elevated to 80°C over 5 hours. When the temperature reached 80°C, diisobutyl 4-methyl-cylcohexane-l,2-dicarboxylate (a mixture of a cis-isomer and a trans-isomer) was added thereto in a proportion of 0.15 mol, based on 1 mol of a magnesium atom in the solid adduct, and then the temperature thereof was elevated to 120°C over 40 minutes. The temperature was maintained at 120°C under stirring for 90 minutes to effect the reaction.<br>
After the completion of the reaction for 90 minutes, a solid portion was recovered by hot filtration. This solid portion was resuspended in 200 ml of titanium tetrachloride, and the temperature thereof was elevated to 130°C, and then maintained at that temperature under stirring for 45 minutes to effect reaction. After the completion of the reaction for 45 minutes, a solid portion was recovered again by hot filtration. The recovered solid portion was sufficiently washed with decane and heptane at 100°C until a free titanium compound was no longer detected in the washing solution.<br>
Thus, the solid titanium catalyst component (αl) which was prepared in the above procedure was stored as a decane slurry. An aliquot portion of the slurry was picked and dried to examine the catalyst composition.<br>
(Polymerization)<br>
To a polymerization vessel with an internal volume of 2 liters, 500 g of propylene and 1 NL of hydrogen were added at room temperature, and then 0.5 mmol of triethylaluminum, 0.1 mmol of cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane and 0.004 mmol, in terms of titanium atom, of the solid catalyst component (al) as prepared above were added thereto, and the internal temperature of the polymerization vessel was rapidly elevated to70°C. After polymerization at 70°C for 1 hour, a small amount of methanol was added thereto to stop the reaction, and propylene was purged. The obtained polymer particles were dried under reduced pressure overnight at 80°C.<br>

(Table Removed)<br><br>
 The results of the measurement of melt tension were shown in Table 2. It can be seen that PP of Comparative Example 2 has a lower melt tension, as compared with that of Example 11. Further, the threads obtained upon measurement of melt tension of the polymers obtained in Comparative Examples 2 and 3 were weak, and thus troubles such as thread breakages or moving away from the pulley easily occurred.<br>
Table 2<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It can be seen that polypropylene obtained by using the solid titanium catalyst component, the catalyst for olefin polymerization and the process for producing an olefin polymer of the invention is a polymer having a broad molecular weight distribution. In particular, it is characterized that when comparing the PP's having almost the same MFR values with each<br>
other, the Mz/Mw values are high, which shows high contents of the high molecular weight components.<br>
Above all, when using the solid titanium catalyst component comprising a cyclic diester compound having a dicarboxylic acid diester group on the 1-position and the 2-position, and a substituent on the 3-position, a polymer having an extremely high Mw/Mn value is obtained. In particular, it can be seen that the polymer obtained by using the solid titanium catalyst component comprising cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid diester (corresponding to the compound of the above-described formula (la)) having a substituent on the 3-position and the 6-position exhibited extremely high Mw/Mn values and Mz/Mw values, and the activity of the catalyst and the stereoregularity of the obtained polymer are high.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
