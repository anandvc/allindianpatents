and the physiologically tolerated acid addition salts thereof.<br><br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, because of their greater solubility in water compared with the initial or basic compounds, particularly suitable for medical applications. These salts must have a pharmaceutically acceptable anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the invention are salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric, sulfonic and sulfuric acids, and of organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isothionic, lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, succinic, p-toluenesulfonic, tartaric and trifluoroacetic acids. The chloride salt is particularly preferably used for medical purposes. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium salts) and alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium salts).<br>
Salts with a pharmaceutically unacceptable anion likewise belong in the scope of the invention as useful intermediates for the preparation or purification of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or for use in nontherapeutic, for example in vitro, applications.<br>
The term "physiologically functional derivative" used herein refers to any physiologically tolerated derivative of a compound of the invention, e.g. an ester which is able on administration to a mammal, such as, for example, a human, to form (directly or indirectly) such a compound or an active metabolite thereof.<br>
Prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention are another aspect of this invention. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to give a compound according to the invention. These prodrugs may or may not be active themselves.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can also exist in various polymorphous forms, for example as amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms. All the polymorphous forms of the compounds according to the invention are included in the scope of the invention and are a further aspect of the invention.<br>
All references to "compound(s) according to formula (I)" in the following text relate to compound(s) of the formula (I) as described above and their salts, solvates and<br><br>
physiologically functional derivatives as described herein.<br>
Saccharide residues mean compounds derived from aldoses and ketoses which have 3 to 7 carbon atoms and may belong to the D or L series; these include amino saccharides, sugar alcohols or saccharic acids. Examples which may be mentioned are glucose, mannose, fructose, galactose, ribose, erythrose, glyceraldehyde, sedoheptulose, glucosamine, galactosamine, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, gluconic acid, galactonic acid, mannonic acid, glucamine, 3-amino-1,2-propanediol, glucaric acid and galactaric acid.<br>
Disaccharides means saccharides composed of two saccharide units. Di-, tri-, or tetrasaccharides are produced by acetal-like linkage with 2 or more sugars. The linkages may moreover occur in the a or p form. Examples which may be mentioned are lactose, maltose and cellobiose.<br>
If the saccharide is substituted, the substitution preferably takes place on the hydrogen atom of an OH group of the sugar.<br>
Suitable protective groups for the hydroxyl groups of the saccharides are essentially the following: benzyl, acetyl, benzoyl, pivaloyl, trityl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, benzylidene, cyclohexylidene or isopropylidene protective groups.<br>
The term amino acids or amino acid residues mean e.g. the stereoisomeric forms, i.e. D or L forms, of the following compounds:<br><br>
2-aminoadipic acid	2-aminoisobutyric acid<br><br>
3-aminoadipic acid<br>

The abbreviated names for the amino acids follow the generally customary names (cf. Schroder, Lubke, The Peptides, Vol. I, New York 1965, pages XXII-XXIII; Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Volume XV/1 and 2, Stuttgart 1974). The amino acid pGlu is pyroglutamyl, Nal is 3-(2-naphthyl)alanine, azagly-NH2 is a compound of the formula NH2-HN-CONH2 and D-Asp is the D form of aspartic acid. According to their chemical nature, peptides are amides and decompose into amino acids on hydrolysis.<br>
Diamino acid residue, triamino acid residue, tetraamino acid residue are understood as meaning peptides which are composed of 2 to 4 of the abovementioned amino acids.<br>
Suitable protective groups (see, for example, T.W. Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis") employed for amino acids are primarily: Arg(Tos), Arg(Mts), Arg(Mtr), Arg(PMV), Asp(OBzl), Asp(OBut), Cys(4-MeBzl), Cys(Acm), Cys(SBut), Glu(OBzl), Glu(OBut), His(Tos), His(Fmoc), His(Dnp), His(Trt),<br><br>
Lys(CI-2), Lys(Boc), Met(O), Ser(Bzl), Ser(But), Thr(Bzl), Thr(But), Trp(Mts), Trp(CHO), Tyr(Br-Z), Tyr(Bzl) or Tyr(but).<br>
Amino protective groups used are preferably the benzyloxycarbonyl(Z) radical which is removable by catalytic hydrogenation, the 2-(3,5-dimethyloxyphenyl)prop-2-yloxycarbonyl (Ddz) or trityl (Trt) radical which can be eliminated by weak acids and the 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) radical which can be eliminated by secondary amines.<br>
The amount of a compound of formula (I) and of other active ingredients necessary to achieve the desired biological effect with the combination depends on a number of factors, e.g. the specific compound chosen, the intended use, the mode of administration and the clinical condition of the patient. The daily dose is generally in the range from 0.1 mg to 100 mg (typically from 0.1 mg to 50 mg) per day per kilogram of body weight, e.g. 0.1-10 mg/kg/day. Tablets or capsules may contain, for example, from 0.01 to 100 mg, typically from 0.02 to 50 mg. In the case of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, the aforementioned weight data are based on the weight of the aminopropanol ion derived from the salt. The compositions of matter are, however, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with a convertible carrier. The carrier must, of course, be compatible in the sense that it is compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and is not harmful for the patient's health. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compounds as single dose, for example as tablet, which may contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active ingredient. Other pharmaceutically active substances may likewise be present, including other compounds of formula (I). The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be produced by one of the known pharmaceutical methods which consist essentially of mixing the ingredients with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are those suitable for oral and peroral (e.g. sublingual) administration, although the most suitable mode of administration depends in each individual case on the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and on the nature of the particular compound of formula (I) used. Coated formulations and coated slow-release formulations are also within the scope of the<br><br>
invention. Acid- and gastric juice-resistant formulations are preferred. Suitable gastric juice-resistant coatings comprise cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compounds for oral administration may be in the form of separate units such as, for example, capsules, cachets, lozenges or tablets, each of which contain a defined amount of the compound of the formula (I) and of the other active ingredients; as powders or granules; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. These compositions may, as already mentioned, be prepared by any suitable pharmaceutical method which includes a step in which the active ingredient and the carrier (which may consist of one or more additional ingredients) are brought into contact. These compositions are generally produced by a uniform and homogeneous mixing of the active ingredient with a liquid and/or finely divided solid carrier, after which the product is shaped if necessary. Thus, for example, a tablet can be produced by compressing or shaping a powder or granules of the compound, where appropriate with one or more additional ingredients. Compressed tablets may be produced by tableting the compound in free-flowing form, such as, for example, a powder or granules, where appropriate mixed with a binder, glidant, inert diluent and/or one (or more) surface-active/dispersing agent in a suitable machine. Shaped tablets can be produced by shaping the compound which is in powder form and has been moistened with an inert liquid diluent in a suitable machine.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for peroral (sublingual) administration include lozenges which contain a compound of formula (I) and the other active ingredient with a flavoring, normally sucrose and gum arabic ortragacanth, and pastilles which comprise the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or sucrose and gum arabic.<br>
Other active ingredients which are suitable for the combination products are: all antidiabetics mentioned in the Rote Liste 2001, chapter 12. They can be combined with compounds of the invention of formula I in particular for synergistic improvement of the effect. Administration of the active ingredient combination can<br><br>
take place either by separate administration of the active ingredients to the patient or in the form of combination products in which a plurality of active ingredients are present in one pharmaceutical preparation. Most of the active ingredients listed below are disclosed in the USP Dictionary of USAN and International Drug Names, US Pharmacopeia, Rockville 2001.<br>
Antidiabetics include insulin and insulin derivatives such as, for example, Lantus® (see www.lantus.com) or HMR 1964, fast-acting insulins (see US 6,221,633), GLP-1 derivatives such as, for example, those disclosed in WO 98/08871 of Novo Nordisk A/S, and orally active hypoglycemic active ingredients.<br>

The synergistic effect of the combinations of compounds of the formula I with other active ingredients was tested in an animal experiment. For this purpose, the following compound (C1) from the group of compounds of the formula I was tested:<br><br>
Hamsters were used for the biological testing of the combination products of the invention.<br>
Male Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) from 8 to 10 weeks of age were used for the experiment. The animals received a standard feed (Teklad 8604M) supplemented with 0.1% cholesterol. An additional normal control group received only standard feed.<br>
The test substances were administered orally by gavage once a day on 12 consecutive days, and the control group was treated with the vehicle.<br>
Feces were collected on days 5 and 6 of the experiment for bile acid analysis.<br><br>
Retroorbital blood was taken from the animals on day 10 of the experiment, and the lipid levels in the plasma were determined. Radioactive tracers were administered orally to the animals on day 11 of the experiment to determine the cholesterol absorption in analogy to the method described by Zilversmith et al. On day 11 of the experiment, the animals were sacrificed, and the animals' livers were removed for cholesterol analysis and preparation of microsomes. The 7a-hydroxylase activity was determined in the liver microsomes ex vivo by a modified method of Hylemon et al.<br><br>
The substances are dissolved in 2% ETOH in a final concentration of 5%. The solutions are then suspended with 0.4% potato starch. Administration takes place between 7-8 a.m. with 10 ml/kg<br>
Feed: Teklad 8604M batch: 032201M<br>
Experimental animals: Male Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) supplied by<br>
Harlan, 100-120 g at the start of adaptation<br>
Measured parameters:<br>
Safety parameters (CH; TG; ALAT/ASAT; AP; CK; HDL/LDL -CH)<br>
Liver cholesterol (HPLC) = 1 x 500 mg in ETOH/KOH<br>
CYP7 activity (liver microsomes as group pool of 0.5 g each - preparation on day of<br>
experiment)<br>
Feces collected on day 5-7 for bile acid determination<br>
Cholesterol synthesis:<br>
i.v. administration of 14C-octanoate 10 //Ci/100 g of animal 1 h before the end of the experiment (isoflurane anesthesia) Removal of 2 x 500 mg of liver in EtOH/KOH<br><br><br><br>
Cholesterol absorption<br>
Oral aministration of 2μiCi 3H-sitosterol/1μCi 14C-cholesterol in 0,5ml 1:1<br>
tricaprin: tricaprylin<br>
Feces collected from day 8-10<br>
The feces are then dried and combusted for isotope determination in an Oximat (Packard)<br>
It is evident from the table that the compounds of the formula I in combination with ezetimibe show a synergistic effect on the plasma parameters.<br><br><br><br>
