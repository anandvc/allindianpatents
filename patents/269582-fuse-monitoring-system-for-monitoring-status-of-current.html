				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a monitoring system to<br>
monitor the electrical status of current limiting devices.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to a monitoring<br>
system to individually monitor the electrical status of<br>
current limiting devices and avoid single phasing of fuses<br>
thereby protecting load connected to the power system from<br>
overload.<br>
The system of the present invention finds application in<br>
current limiting devices such as thermal fuses or positive<br>
temperature coefficient (PTC) resistors present in each<br>
phase of a multiphase system.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Study of international market clearly indicates that in an<br>
industrial environment monitoring the status of fuses is<br>
very important since a fuse in bad condition may cause a<br>
single phasing condition, which is not desirable. Several<br>
companies have come up with products, which monitors the<br>
status of the fuse. But almost all of them give only master<br>
indication but do not provide the secondary information for<br>
individual fuse, like in which phase fuse has blown and<br>
many of these products require an external dc source for<br>
its functioning.<br>
US1984000646535 describes an online indicator connected<br>
across each fuse across an electrical circuit, which<br>
includes a LED, which is illuminated if its protected fuse<br><br>
blows. Groups of these online indicator can be connected<br>
via an 'OR' gate to provide master indicator. Opto-<br>
isolators are used to reduce standby current drain and to<br>
isolate online indicators and not as the voltage sense<br>
element as in the invention. These are intended for use in<br>
dc systems.<br>
DE3515773 refers to a device which monitors the operating<br>
condition of one or several fuse links, preferably low<br>
voltage power fuses and emits outwards a continuous current<br>
pulse both for the normal operation, i.e. low voltage power<br>
fuse intact, as also for the disturbance, i.e. the fuse<br>
burnt. According to the invention the device consists of a<br>
parallel stretch to the fuse link, which, in case of<br>
disturbance, independently of the voltage prevailing on the<br>
fuse, gives a constant current on the luminous diode of a<br>
photo-coupler, so that the switching transistor of the<br>
photo-coupler switches on to a transistor component. In the<br>
normal operation the voltage present on the fuse link is so<br>
low that the photo-coupler does not switch through.<br>
Depending upon the condition of the photo-coupler, the<br>
transistor component switches through a permanent pulse<br>
either for normal operation or for a disturbance, whereby<br>
the other continuous pulse is switched off. During this<br>
optionally 2 luminous diodes are switched on for direct<br>
indication on the fuse monitor device. In this case the<br>
problems lie in the varying mains conditions and in the<br>
disconnecting property of a fuse link. The network can<br>
display either AC voltage or DC voltage; in case of AC<br>
voltage (poly-phase AC) up to 660V, in case of DC voltage<br>
up to 440V. On the burning of a fuse, e.g. in case of poly-<br>
phase AC, as a consequence of counter-EMS of a large motor,<br><br>
but with secured parallel cables, the residual voltage on<br>
the fuse link can be very small in comparison with the<br>
mains voltage. On disconnecting the fuse link a short-lived<br>
switching voltage surge can occur, which is higher by a<br>
multiple that the mains voltage.<br>
DE-OS1933942 describes a switch arrangement for electronic<br>
switch monitoring specially designed for circuits for<br>
supply to several parallel connected, individually secured<br>
consumer devices or for converters with parallely connected<br>
valves. A diode equipped with a resistor-capacitor<br>
circuitry lies in series to that fuse link. The blocking<br>
voltage appearing during the load on the diode in the<br>
blocking direction with burnt-through fuse at the fuse<br>
stretch is used for switching a transistor located in the<br>
device. Its switching leads to the switching of a thyristor<br>
connecting an optical indication with a separate auxiliary<br>
voltage.<br>
DE-OS2533182 describes an arrangement for electronic fuse<br>
monitoring where the fuse links lie in parallel diode<br>
branches, through which a common consumer device is<br>
supplied. If one of the fuse links is released, then, due<br>
to the increased current, the other fuse links are released<br>
one after the other, whereby already the release of the<br>
first fuse link is recorded, since an resistor capacitor-<br>
member is parallely connected to each diode, through which<br>
the signaling device receives current during the blocking<br>
direction loading of the diode with burnt-through fuse<br>
link. A separate control voltage source is not necessary,<br>
since the required energy is taken from the capacitor of<br>
the RC-member. Since the diodes with their RC-member lie<br><br>
at the mains branches, an application during the supply to<br>
any arbitrary number of consumer devices or to consumer<br>
devices directly connected to an AC network or poly-phase<br>
AC network is not possible.<br>
DE-OS2831139 describes an arrangement for fuse monitoring<br>
possessing a luminous diode, which lies connected in series<br>
to a thermally controlled resistor and a resistance in<br>
parallel connecting to the thermally controlled resistor<br>
parallel to the fuse link. In this series circuit yet<br>
another bridge rectifier can be included so that then the<br>
luminous diode lies at the DC outlet of the bridge<br>
rectifier. With this arrangement the leading out of the<br>
continuous pulses for a remote signaling or remote control<br>
is not possible. An indication for the normal operation is<br>
eliminated. Since the thermally controlled resistor with<br>
parallel resistance must be matched to the balancing diode<br>
at maximum mains voltage in cold condition, of which the<br>
maximum permissible voltage lies under 5V, and which<br>
increases its resistance substantially on exceeding the<br>
pull-out current, in spite of the parallel resistance, a<br>
deployment of the arrangement is possible only in a limited<br>
mains voltage range. The luminous diode is also endangered<br>
by excess switching voltage.<br>
DE-OS 2851956 describes an arrangement for electronic fuse<br>
monitor possessing a parallel stretch to the fuse link,<br>
consisting of a rectifier diode, a glow lamp, a limiting<br>
resistance and of a luminous diode of a photo-coupler,<br>
which are connected in series. In case of burnt fuse the<br>
positive half-wave of the AC voltage present on fuse link<br>
is passed through the rectifier diode and after the<br><br>
response of the glow lamp over the luminous diode of the<br>
photo-coupler so that this one switches through and<br>
activates a relay with the help of an auxiliary voltage.<br>
During this a smoothing of the half-waves through a<br>
capacitor can take place. A lamp indication takes place<br>
through the glow lamp in case of a disturbance. The<br>
arrangement gives a high response voltage on burning of a<br>
fuse link due to the use of a glow lamp. It cannot be used<br>
in low voltage ranges or in case of secured parallel<br>
cables. However, besides the motor protection switch, till<br>
now it is the only arrangement, which is suitable for a<br>
remote signaling or remote control.<br>
US6492799 B1 describes measuring the voltage difference<br>
between the two star points formed from six resistor taps<br>
taken from the lines of three phase system. In normal case<br>
there will not be any voltage difference between these<br>
points and in an abnormal condition voltage difference<br>
between these star points is detected and appropriate<br>
indication is given. But this logic can be used for giving<br>
master indications only and cannot be used for giving<br>
information as to in which phase the fuse has blown.<br>
Thus there is a need to provide a monitoring system to<br>
individually monitor the electrical status of current<br>
limiting devices and avoid single phasing of fuses thereby<br>
protecting load connected to the power system from<br>
overload.<br>
The present inventors have found that the a monitoring<br>
system can be achieved comprising some sensor means in<br>
operative connection to desired control means in a manner<br><br>
that it is possible to individually monitor the electrical<br>
status of current limiting devices and avoid single phasing<br>
of fuses thereby protecting load connected to the power<br>
system from overload. Further monitoring can be done in<br>
both load and no-load condition.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
Thus one object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
monitoring system for accurate monitoring the status of<br>
current limiting devices and individual monitoring fusion<br>
of a fuse detecting the fuse in which fault has occurred.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
self-generating power supply unit in the device so that it<br>
can work without the help of any external dc power supply.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
monitoring within a wide range (220 to 690 V AC) of<br>
operating voltage.<br>
Yet one more object of the present invention is to provide<br>
protection to a motor or any multiphase load connected to<br>
the power system from overload which may occur due to<br>
single phasing caused by the fusion of a fuse in one of the<br>
phases of a multiphase system with the help of potential<br>
free contacts whose state is decided by the control<br>
electronics depending on the state of the current limiting<br>
device.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
monitoring operation in both load and no-load condition.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide fuse<br>
monitor system that can withstand high impulse voltages.<br>
The other object is to provide monitor system which can<br>
work in presence of reverse voltage through the load.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there<br>
is provided a monitoring system adapted to monitor<br>
electrical status and operating conditions of plurality of<br>
current limiting devices or fuses whereby detecting and<br>
individually monitoring conditions of each fuse,<br>
wherein the said fuse links are connected in each phase of<br>
a multi-phase system and<br>
wherein from over said fuse links connecting means being<br>
provide in a manner so as to establish operative connection<br>
from power supply network to said fuse monitoring system,<br>
said fuse monitoring system comprising :<br>
(i) plurality of sensor means operatively<br>
connected across each of the phases of the<br>
multi phase system; wherein said sensor means<br>
being adapted to output instantaneous<br>
condition of each fuse of said plurality of<br>
fuses;<br>
(ii) controller means connected to said sensor<br>
means such that it gives desired output<br><br>
depending on the status of the current<br>
limiting device; and<br>
(iii) indicator means operatively connected to the<br>
controller means indicating the status of the<br>
fuses or individual fuse.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The electronic fuse monitoring system of the present<br>
invention comprises plurality of identical sub system for<br>
each phase of the multi phase power system for voltage<br>
detection, and it individually monitors the condition of<br>
each fuse of the plurality of fuses connected in the<br>
phases. The said sub system comprises an output circuitry<br>
comprising plurality of voltage sensors adapted to output<br>
instantaneous condition of each fuse monitored by the fuse<br>
monitoring unit correlating with the individual<br>
distinguishing information. The said voltage sensors<br>
comprises opto-couplers having predetermined threshold<br>
level of voltage for its actuation thus influencing the<br>
state of control electronics depending on the voltage<br>
present across its input terminals. In normal conditions<br>
the input voltage to opto coupler is below the said<br>
threshold level and the indications corresponding to normal<br>
operation comes on.<br>
In case of an abnormal condition such as a blown fuse, the<br>
voltage across this fuse is above the threshold limit of<br>
the voltage and this actuates the opto coupler and thereby<br>
changes the state of the control circuit and thus<br>
indications corresponding to faulty condition in the system<br>
comes on.<br><br>
The sub system comprises multiphase power supply unit which<br>
powers the output circuitry and comprises transformer less<br>
one in which the input voltage is fed to rectifier means<br>
directly from the supply lines. The said rectifier means<br>
comprises three phase bridge rectifier provided with<br>
plurality of arms having upper arms and lower arms. The<br>
said lower arm comprises means for protecting the power<br>
supply unit and also regulating the output voltage of the<br>
rectifier. The said means comprises transient voltage surge<br>
suppressor diodes. Additionally, the output of the power<br>
supply unit is used to energize sensing logic circuitry and<br>
the potential free auxiliary relay contact system. The said<br>
logic circuitry comprises plurality of logic gates, which<br>
control the voltage in the system according to the need of<br>
operation.<br>
The fuse monitoring system comprises display module<br>
comprising plurality of indicator means adapted for visual<br>
indication of the status of the fuse links. The said<br>
indicator means comprises green LED showing the healthy<br>
status of all the three phases, indicating all the three<br>
fuses are intact, one orange LED indicating that a faulty<br>
condition like a blown fuse has occurred in the power<br>
system, three red LEDs corresponding to each phase in a<br>
multi phase system and the red LED corresponding to a<br>
particular phase comes on whenever the fuse corresponding<br>
to that phase blows. This provides information as to in<br>
which phase the fuse has blown, making its replacement much<br>
more convenient.<br><br>
The fuse monitor is also provided with a set of potential<br>
free contacts, which can be used for protection or remote<br>
indication purposes or can be used in protection schemes to<br>
disconnect the load during abnormal conditions in the power<br>
systems.<br>
During fusion of fuse link connected in line LI between the<br>
fuse terminals Fl and F2, the voltage appearing across the<br>
fuse in this fused condition is well above the threshold<br>
value of the opto coupler causing it to turn ON, thereby-<br>
causing the voltage across the zener diode connected to the<br>
output of the opto coupler to go down to zero. Thus one of<br>
the inputs to the NAND gate which receives its inputs from<br>
the out put side of the opto-couplers connected across each<br>
fuse link, goes low causing its output to go high. This<br>
causes the transistor having green LED in its collector to<br>
receive a high base drive causing it to go into saturation<br>
and this causes the voltage across the green LED to drop to<br>
zero thereby causing it to turn OFF, and the output of the<br>
NOT gate which is connected to the output of the said NAND<br>
gate goes low as the output of the NAND gate is high<br>
cutting of the base drive to the transistor which carries<br>
the orange LED in its collector thereby causing the orange<br>
LED to go ON indicating an abnormal condition in the<br>
system. Since the opto coupler has turned ON the transistor<br>
connected through the zener at the output of optocoupler<br>
doesn't receive any base drive causing it to work in the<br>
cut off region, thereby the red LED connected in the<br>
collector of this transistor and corresponding to the fuse<br>
link comes ON indicating that there is a fault in the fuse<br>
link. At the same time since the output of the said NAND<br>
gate is high the transistor receives a base drive through<br><br>
the resistor driving it into saturation causing the relay-<br>
to get energized and thus causing the auxiliary contacts of<br>
the relay to change over.<br>
Similarly during fusion of fuse links in lines L2 and L3<br>
the red LEDs corresponding to those phases also comes ON<br>
indicating a fault in the corresponding phase. Similarly,<br>
during faults in more than one phase and fusion of more<br>
than one fuse links, the red LEDs corresponding to the<br>
phases having faulty fuse links comes ON. The orange LED<br>
also comes ON indicating an abnormal condition in the<br>
system.<br>
The power required for the entire circuit is supplied by<br>
the three phase bridge rectifier circuit. The lower arms of<br>
the bridge rectifier consist of Transient Voltage<br>
Suppressor Diodes which protects the circuit from the line<br>
side disturbances as well as regulates the voltage. The<br>
filtered output of the bridge rectifier supplies the<br>
voltage required to energize the relay in case of an<br>
abnormal condition. The voltage levels required for the ICs<br>
in the circuit are obtained by stepping down and regulating<br>
the outputs of the bridge rectifier using zener diodes.<br>
The system comprises balanced load system formed by<br>
plurality of resistors making it possible for the circuit<br>
of the system to monitor the status of the fuse even when<br>
the load is in disconnected condition. When the load is in<br>
disconnected condition the path for the flow of the current<br>
between the phases get completed through these resistors.<br><br>
The said fuse monitoring system consumes only very low<br>
power because of the use of low threshold optocouplers as<br>
voltage sensors. It also avoids the need for any external<br>
power supply because of the self generating power supply<br>
unit present in the device. The said fuse monitoring device<br>
gives the status of the current limiting device in each<br>
phase of a multiphase system and it can further be used for<br>
remote indication and protection purposes also.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 illustrates schematic diagram for fuse monitoring<br>
system of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the circuit configuration of the fuse<br>
monitoring system of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
Referring to figure 1 it is realizable that the fuse<br>
monitor is connected across the terminals (F1) and (F2) of<br>
fuse link (9), (F3) and (F4) of fuse link (10) and (F5) and<br>
(F6) of fuse link (11) (also shown in figure 2) and that<br>
the circuitry consists of a built-in power supply unit (5),<br>
voltage sensing units (6,7 and 8), logic circuitry (2) and<br>
display module (4). The output of the power supply unit (5)<br>
energizes the sensing logic circuitry (2) and the potential<br>
free auxiliary relay contact system (3) . The voltage<br>
sensors (6,7 and 8) are connected across the fuse links<br>
(9,10 and 11) and continuously monitors the voltage across<br>
each of the said fuse links (9, 10 and 11) . The output of<br>
these voltage sensors (6, 7 and 8) depends on the condition<br><br>
of the fuse i.e, whether it is in good state or fused<br>
state. The output of the voltage sensors (6,7 and 8) is fed<br>
to the logic circuitry (2) which gives an output such that<br>
appropriate indications in the display module (4) comes ON<br>
indicating the status of the fuse links (9,10 and 11). The<br>
display module (4) comprises five LEDs (described in<br>
details in the description of figure 2).<br>
Figure 2 represents an embodiment of the fuse monitor for a<br>
three phase system and it lucidly indicates the circuit<br>
details. The lines (L1), (L2) and (L3) represents<br>
individual phases of three phase power supply system. Fuses<br>
(9), (10) and (11) are thermal fuses inserted into the<br>
lines (L1, L2 and L3) respectively for the protection of<br>
the system in case of an abnormal condition in the system.<br>
The fuse monitor is connected across the fuse terminals<br>
(F1) and (F2), (F3) and (F4), (F5) and (F6) corresponding<br>
to fuse links (9, 10 and 11) respectively. In this<br>
embodiment the voltage sensors (6, 7 and 8) connected<br>
across fuse links (9, 10 and 11) respectively are low<br>
threshold sensing opto couplers with ac to dc logic<br>
interface. These opto couplers (6, 7, and 8) are connected<br>
to the lines (L1, L2 and L3) respectively through high<br>
resistors (46) and (47), (48) and (49), (30) and (31) in<br>
that order. These resistors determine the operating voltage<br>
range of the fuse monitor by setting the threshold values<br>
for the opto couplers (6, 7 and 8). Whenever the fuses (9,<br>
10 and 11) are in good condition the voltage across the<br>
fuses are below the threshold level of the voltage sensors<br>
(6, 7 and 8) and hence the opto coupler wiL1 be OFF and so<br>
the voltage Vcc applied to the optocouplers (6, 7 and 8)<br>
through (33, 43 and 52) appears across the zener diodes<br><br>
(34,39 and 55) causing them to operate in their breakdown<br>
region. NAND gate (14) which receives it's input from<br>
across the zeners (34, 39 and 55). Since the zeners (34,39<br>
and 55) are operating in their breakdown region aL1 the<br>
inputs to the NAND gate (14) is high and forcing the output<br>
of the NAND gate (14) to remain low. This causes the<br>
transistors (25) to operate in the cut off region thereby<br>
causing the voltage Vcc to appear across the green LED (24)<br>
and thus it turns on indicating that aL1 fuses are in a<br>
healthy condition. NOT gate (59) gives a high output as it<br>
receives its input from the low output of the NAND gate<br>
(14). This provides a base drive for the transistor (16)<br>
causing it to operate in the saturation region thereby<br>
causing the voltage across the orange LED (17) to drop to<br>
zero, causing it to remain OFF. Similarly as the opto-<br>
couplers (6,7 and 8) are in OFF condition transistors<br>
(35,40 and 56) receives base drive from the voltages<br>
through the resistors (33,43 and 52) causing it to go into<br>
saturation and thus the red LEDs (36,42 and 57) to remain<br>
OFF indicating healthy condition of aL1 the fuse links.<br>
The invention has been described in a preferred form only<br>
and many variations may be made in the invention which wiL1<br>
stiL1 be comprised within its spirit. The invention is not<br>
limited to the details cited above. The components of the<br>
circuit used as described and iL1ustrated in the above<br>
description and the drawings do not restrict the scope of<br>
the invention. The structure thus conceived is susceptible<br>
of numerous modifications and variations, aL1 the details<br>
may furthermore be replaced with elements having technical<br>
equivalence. In practice the materials and dimensions may<br><br>
be any according to the requirements, which wiL1 stiL1 be<br>
comprised within its true spirit.<br><br>
