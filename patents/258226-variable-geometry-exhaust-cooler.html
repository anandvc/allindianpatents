FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to exhaust coolers, and more<br>
particularly to a variable geometry exhaust cooler.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0003] Diesel engine systems are popular due to their generally high<br>
efficiency relative to other kinds of internal combustion engines. This efficiency<br>
is due, in part, to the increased compression ratio of the Diesel combustion<br>
process and the higher energy density of Diesel fuel. However, the Diesel<br>
combustion process does produce particulates that are carried in the exhaust<br>
gas produced by the Diesel engine system.<br>
[0004] A Diesel particulate filter is often used to remove these<br>
particulates from the exhaust gases. Typically, the Diesel particulate filter is<br>
coupled to the exhaust system downstream of the Diesel engine. The Diesel<br>
particulate filter receives the exhaust gas and filters particulates out of the<br>
exhaust gas. While useful for its intended purpose, the Diesel particulate filter<br>
can become full over time, and if not cleaned, the operating effectiveness of the<br>
Diesel particulate filter can be degraded.<br>
1<br><br>
[0005] Another solution known in the art is to use a regeneration<br>
process to remove particulates trapped in the Diesel particulate filter. These<br>
regeneration processes may take various forms, such as, for example, exhaust<br>
gas recirculation or using post-combustion fuel injected into the cylinder in order<br>
to raise the temperature of the exhaust gas stream. An exemplary regeneration<br>
process is found in commonly owned U.S. Patent Number 7,104,048 B2, hereby<br>
incorporated by reference as if fully disclosed herein. These regeneration<br>
processes typically heat the exhaust gasses to a high temperature in order to<br>
burn the particulates from the Diesel particulate filter.<br>
[0006] During conditions when the Diesel engine system is in an idle<br>
state, it is desirable to cool the exhaust gasses before they are expelled into the<br>
environment. Accordingly, an exhaust gas cooler may be coupled to the Diesel<br>
engine system downstream of the Diesel particulate filter to cool the exhaust gas.<br>
The exhaust gas cooler is operable to mix the hot exhaust gas with the cooler<br>
ambient air, thereby reducing the temperature of the exhaust gas. To do so,<br>
however, the amount of exhaust gas entering the exhaust cooler is typically<br>
restricted such that sufficient cooling can take place. This restriction of the<br>
exhaust gas can lead to back pressure, lowered horsepower, and other<br>
inefficiencies in the Diesel engine system when the Diesel engine system is<br>
running at a non-idle state and producing large amounts of exhaust gas.<br>
Accordingly, there is room in the art for an exhaust cooler that is operable to vary<br>
the amount of exhaust gas entering the exhaust cooler based on the operating<br>
state of the Diesel engine system.<br>
2<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0030] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0031] With reference to FIG. 1, an exemplary Diesel engine system is<br>
illustrated and generally indicated by reference number 10. The Diesel engine<br>
system 10 is preferably employed in a motor vehicle (not shown), though the<br>
Diesel engine system 10 may be used in various other applications without<br>
departing from the scope of the present invention. The Diesel engine system 10<br>
generally includes a Diesel engine 12. The Diesel engine 12 is in electronic<br>
communication with an engine controller 14. The engine controller 14 is<br>
operable to control the Diesel engine 12 based on various parameters.<br>
[0032] The Diesel engine 12 is operable to combust Diesel fuel (not<br>
shown) in a combustion process within the Diesel engine 12. The by-product of<br>
this combustion process is an exhaust gas. The exhaust gas is discharged from<br>
the Diesel engine 12 as an exhaust gas stream into an exhaust pipe 16, as<br>
indicated by the arrows in FIG. 1.<br>
[0033] The exhaust pipe 16 includes a first section 18 that<br>
communicates the exhaust gas from the Diesel engine 12 to a catalyst 20 located<br>
downstream of the Diesel engine 12. The catalyst 20 is mounted to the exhaust<br>
pipe 16. The catalyst 20 may be any exhaust scrubbing device, such as, for<br>
6<br><br>
example, an NOx filter. The catalyst 20 is operable to filter the exhaust gas to<br>
meet applicable emissions standards.<br>
[0034] A second section 22 of the exhaust pipe 16 carries the exhaust<br>
gas from the catalyst 20 to a Diesel particulate filter 24. The Diesel particulate<br>
filter 24 is mounted to the exhaust pipe 16 and is located downstream of the<br>
catalyst 20 and the Diesel engine 12. The Diesel particulate filter 24 filters the<br>
exhaust gas stream and traps particulates therein. The Diesel particulate filter 24<br>
may take various forms without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention. For example, the Diesel particulate filter 24 may include a ceramic<br>
structure through which the exhaust gas stream passes. The particulates are<br>
trapped and accumulate on the walls of the ceramic structure until such time as<br>
they are burned off in a regeneration process using hot exhaust gasses.<br>
[0035] The exhaust gas stream passes from the Diesel particulate filter<br>
24 to a tailpipe section 26 of the exhaust pipe 16. An exhaust cooler 30 is<br>
mounted to an end of the tailpipe section 26. As will be described in greater<br>
detail below, the exhaust cooler 30 acts to cool the exhaust gas stream before<br>
the exhaust gas stream enters the surrounding environment.<br>
[0036] Turning now to FIG. 2A, the exhaust gas cooler 30 generally<br>
includes a variable geometry nozzle assembly 32 coupled with a jet pump 34.<br>
The nozzle assembly 32 is disposed on an end of the tailpipe section 26 and<br>
defines an opening 36. Preferably, the opening 36 has a diameter equal to the<br>
diameter of the tailpipe section 26. However, it should be appreciated that the<br>
7<br><br>
opening 36 may have a diameter different than the diameter of the tailpipe<br>
section 26 without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0037] The nozzle assembly 32 further includes a first throttle plate 38A<br>
and a second throttle plate 38B. The throttle plates 38A and 38B are each<br>
generally semi-circular in shape and each have an outer diameter larger than the<br>
diameter of the opening 36. Alternatively, the throttle plates 38A and 38B could<br>
have an outer diameter less than the opening 36 such that the throttle plates 38A<br>
and 38B fit within the opening 36. The throttle plates 38A and 38B each<br>
respectively include a semi-circular opening or cut out 42A and 42B. The semi-<br>
circular cut outs 42A and 42B are concentric with the generally semi-circular<br>
shape of the throttle plates 38A and 38B, and each semi-circular cut out 42A and<br>
42B has a diameter less than the outer diameter of the throttle plates 38A and<br>
38B.<br>
[0038] The throttle plates 38A and 38B are each pivotally mounted to<br>
the tailpipe section 26 at the opening 36. In the example provided, a first hinge<br>
44A pivotally couples the first throttle plate 38A to the tailpipe section 26. The<br>
first hinge 44A is mounted to the tailpipe section 26 and is mounted to the<br>
circumferential center, or apex, of the semi-circular outer edge of the first throttle<br>
plate 38A. A second hinge 44B pivotally couples the second throttle plate 38B to<br>
the tailpipe section 26. The second hinge 44B is mounted to the tailpipe section<br>
26 at a position opposite the first hinge 44A. The second hinge 44B is also<br>
mounted to the circumferential center, or apex, of the semi-circular outer edge of<br>
the second throttle plate 38B. While hinges 44A and 44B have been illustrated<br>
8<br><br>
as pivotally coupling the throttle plates 38A and 38B to the tailpipe section 26, it<br>
should be appreciated that various other mechanisms that allow the throttle<br>
plates 38A and 38B to pivot relative to the tailpipe section 26 may be employed<br>
without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0039] The throttle plates 38A and 38B are respectively biased to a<br>
closed position by a first biasing member 48A and a second biasing member<br>
48B. In the preferred embodiment, the biasing members 48A and 48B are<br>
torsional springs, though various other biasing devices may be employed without<br>
departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0040] The closed position of the throttle plates 38A and 38B is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2A. When in the closed position, the throttle plates 38A and<br>
38B are positioned to at least partially cover the opening 36. Furthermore, the<br>
cut outs 42A and 42B cooperate to define a reduced opening 50. The reduced<br>
opening 50 has a diameter less than the diameter of the opening 36.<br>
[0041] The jet pump 34 includes a cylindrical pipe portion 56. An<br>
intake portion 58 is mounted on one end of the cylindrical pipe portion 56. The<br>
intake portion 58 is generally frusto-conical in shape and defines an intake<br>
opening 60. An output portion 62 is mounted on an opposite end of the<br>
cylindrical pipe portion 56. The output portion 62 is also generally frusto-conical<br>
in shape and defines an exhaust output 64 at an end thereof. In an alternate<br>
embodiment, the jet pump 34 includes only the cylindrical pipe portion 56.<br>
[0042] The jet pump 34 is mounted to the tailpipe section 26 by struts<br>
66. The struts 66 extend from the intake portion to the tailpipe section 26. The<br>
9<br><br>
jet pump 34 extends out from the tailpipe section 26 away from the nozzle<br>
assembly 32.<br>
[0043] With reference to FIG. 1 and continued reference to FIG. 2A, in<br>
order to clean the Diesel particulate filter 24, hot exhaust gas is passed through<br>
the exhaust pipe 16, through the Diesel particulate filter 24, and on to the<br>
exhaust cooler 30. When the Diesel engine 12 is in an idle state, the hot exhaust<br>
gas passes through the nozzle opening 50. Cooler ambient air is sucked through<br>
the intake opening 60 of the jet pump 34. The hot exhaust gas and the cooler<br>
ambient air circulate and mix within the cylindrical pipe portion 56 and the output<br>
portion 62. The hot exhaust gas is cooled and exits the exhaust cooler 30 from<br>
the exhaust output 64. Hot exhaust ranging in temperature from 450-600<br>
degrees Celsius at the nozzle opening 50 may be cooled to less than 300<br>
degrees Celsius at the exhaust output 64.<br>
[0044] As the exhaust gas stream leaves the Diesel engine 12, the<br>
exhaust gas stream flows through the exhaust pipe 16. As the exhaust gas<br>
stream 12 reaches the exhaust cooler 30, the exhaust gas stream exerts a<br>
pressure on the throttle plates 38A and 38B. During idle conditions, the exhaust<br>
gas stream pressure is less than the force exerted on the throttle plates 38A and<br>
38B by the biasing members 46A and 46B. Accordingly, the throttle plates 38A<br>
and 38B remain in the closed position and the nozzle opening 50 speeds up the<br>
exhaust gas as it passes through the restricted nozzle opening 50, thereby<br>
entraining more air in the jet pump 34 and achieving increased cooling from the<br>
increased volume of entrained ambient air.<br>
10<br><br>
[0045] When the Diesel engine 12 is running at non-idle conditions, the<br>
amount of exhaust gas produced by the Diesel engine 12 increases, and<br>
accordingly the pressure of the exhaust gas stream on the throttle plates 38A<br>
and 38B increases. This exhaust gas pressure is operable to move the throttle<br>
plates 38A and 38B into an open position. The open position of the throttle<br>
plates 38A and 38B is illustrated in FIG. 2B. When the exhaust stream pressure<br>
exceeds the force exerted by the biasing members 46A and 46B on the throttle<br>
plates 38A and 38B, the throttle plates 38A and 38B are pivoted against the<br>
biasing members 46A and 46B on the hinges 44A and 44B. As the throttle plates<br>
38A and 38B are pivoted away from each other, the opening from the tailpipe<br>
section 26 into the jet pump 34 increases in size from the area provided by the<br>
nozzle 50 to the area provided by the opening 36. Accordingly, a larger amount<br>
of exhaust gas is allowed to pass from the nozzle assembly 30 into the jet pump<br>
34, thereby reducing back pressure and other inefficiencies at non-idle speeds.<br>
[0046] With reference to FIG. 3A, a second embodiment of the exhaust<br>
gas cooler is generally indicated by reference number 130. The exhaust gas<br>
cooler 130 generally includes the jet pump 34, as described in FIG.'s 2A and 2B,<br>
and a nozzle assembly 132.<br>
[0047] The nozzle assembly 132 is disposed on an end of the tailpipe<br>
section 26 and includes a nozzle 134. The nozzle 134 has a generally frusto-<br>
conical shape and is hollow such that an interior of the nozzle 134 communicates<br>
with the tailpipe section 26 to receive the exhaust gas stream. The nozzle 134<br>
further defines an outlet 136 at an end thereof. The outlet 136 has a diameter<br>
11<br><br>
less than the diameter of the tailpipe section 26 and therefore restricts the<br>
amount of exhaust gas passing from the tailpipe section 26 to the jet pump 34.<br>
[0048] A plurality of valves 140, only two of which are shown, are<br>
located around an outer surface 142 of the nozzle 134. The valves 140 are in<br>
communication with the interior of the nozzle 134 and in turn the exhaust gas<br>
stream within the tailpipe section 26. In the preferred embodiment, six to eight<br>
valves are spaced evenly around the outer surface 142 of the nozzle 134.<br>
However, it should be appreciated that any number of valves 140 may be<br>
employed with the present invention. The valves 140 are moveable between a<br>
closed position, as shown in FIG. 3A, and an open position, as shown in FIG. 3B.<br>
The valves 140 are biased toward the closed position. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, the valves 140 are reed type valves. However, it should be<br>
appreciated that various other types of valves may be employed with the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0049] During idle conditions, the exhaust gas stream pressure is not<br>
sufficient to open the valves 140, and the valves remain in the closed position as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3A. Accordingly, the outlet 136 speeds up the exhaust gas<br>
stream as it passes through the restricted opening of the outlet 136, thereby<br>
entraining more air in the jet pump 34 and achieving increased cooling from the<br>
increased volume of entrained ambient air. When the Diesel engine 12 is<br>
running at non-idle conditions, the amount of exhaust gas produced by the Diesel<br>
engine 12 increases, and accordingly the pressure of the exhaust gas stream on<br>
the valve 140 increases. This exhaust gas pressure is operable to move the<br>
12<br><br>
valves 140 into the open position, as illustrated in FIG. 3B. Accordingly, a larger<br>
amount of exhaust gas is allowed to pass from the nozzle assembly 130 into the<br>
jet pump 34, thereby reducing back pressure and other inefficiencies at non-idle<br>
speeds. This allows the exhaust gas cooler 130 to automatically adjust to the<br>
operating state of the engine 12.<br>
[0050] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
