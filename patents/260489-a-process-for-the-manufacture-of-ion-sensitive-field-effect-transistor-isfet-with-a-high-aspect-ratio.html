The process disclosed enables to overcome the implementational problem of high drain-source leakage current encountered in extremely large aspect ratio ISFETs.

				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) with a high aspect ratio and ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) made thereby, leading to fabrication of sensors with enhanced performance for chemical and biological applications. The present invention particularly relates to an improved process for fabrication of ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) structure with a high aspect ratio (channel width/channel length) leading to development of sensors with enhanced performance for chemical and biological applications (without enzyme immobilization in cited cases).<br>
The main utility of the present invention is that an improved process is provided for fabrication of a high aspect ratio (channel width/channel length) ISFET structure with a large transconductance useful as the physical transduction element for fabrication of sensors for chemical and biological applications in medical diagnostics, Pharmaceuticals, food processing, agriculture and environment. Therefore, this invention has widespread applications in chemical and life sciences to fabricate sensors for cations like K+, Na+, Ca2+, Ag+, Pb2+, Cd2+, NHUf; anions like nitrite/nitrate, phosphate, chloride; and biomaterials like glucose, urea, cholesterol, triglyceride, creatinine, penicillin and acetylcholine.<br>
Prior state~of-the-art is that the available ISEFTs have an aspect ratio between 5 and 50, and are generally fabricated by standard CMOS/NMOS technology using Al gate metallization. The ISFET was first introduced by P. Bergveld in 1970 (Bergveld, P., Development of an Ion-Sensitive Sol id-State Device for Neurophysiological Measurements, IEEE Trans, on Biomedical Engineering, BME-17, January 1970, pp. 70-71). The WIL ratio used was 1 mm/100 urn = 10. In a subsequent publication (Bergveld, P., Development, Operation and Application of the Ion-sensitive Field-Effect Transistor as a Tool for Electrophysiology, IEEE Trans, on Biomedical Engineering, BME-19,<br>
September 1972, pp. 342-351), the WIL ratio was 1 mm/20 or 40 ^im = 50 or 25. The contacting layer was evaporated aluminium.<br>
Abe, H., Esashi, M. and Matsuo, T., ISFETs Using Inorganic Gate Thin Films, IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, Vol. 26, 1979, pp. 1939-1944 have taken the aspect ratio as I000um/30|am = 33.3.<br>

and 50 urn, respectively giving W/L-20. Metallization was performed by Al sputtering.<br>
ISFET fabrication by an unmodified two-metal commercial CMOS technology has been described by Bausells J., Carrabina J., Errachid, A. and Merlos A., Ion-Sensitive Field-Effect Transistors Fabricated in a Commercial CMOS Technology, Sensors and Actuators, Vol. B 57, 1999, pp. 56-62, wherein aspect ratios of 500 (4,m/2.5u.m = 200 have been obtained in the linear gate and (10 x 250) urn /2.5nm = 1000 in an interdigitated-continuous metal gate structure.

A number of patents relating to ISFETs have been obtained, as summarized hereinafter. United States Patent 4,791,465, December 13, 1988, to Sakai, T., Katsura, M., Hiraki, H., Uno, S., Shimbo, M., and Furukawa, K., discloses field-effect transistor type semiconductor sensor and method of manufacturing the same with channel width of 1000 um and channel length of 20 urn so that WIL ratio was 50. Cr and Au metallization was used.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent No. 6,218,208, April 17, 2001, to Chou, J.-C., Chung, W.-Y., Hsiung, S.K., Sun, T.-P., and Liao, H.K., wherein is disclosed the fabrication of a multi-structure ion-sensitive field- effect transistor with a pH sensing layer of a tin oxide thin film. Channel width of this device was 100 um and channel length was 5 um with WIL - 20. Aluminum was used as the metal layer.<br>
In US Patent No. 6,740,911, May 25, 2004 to Chou, J. C., and Chiang, J. L. (Alpha-WO3-Gate ISFET Devices and Method of Making the Same), the width of the channel, the length of the channel and ratio of width/length of the channel of the ISFET were 1000 urn, 50 jam and 20, respectively. The device used aluminum metal layer.<br>
In US Patent No. 6,905,896, June 14, 2005 to Chou, J.C., and Wang, Y. F. (SnO2 ISFET Device, Manufacturing Method, and Methods and Apparatus for Use Thereof), the SnO2 ISFET had a channel width of about 1000 um and a channel length of about 50 urn. Thus, the aspect ratio (channel width/channel length) of the SnC&gt;2 ISFET was 20. Aluminium metal layer was used. Further, United States Patent No. 7,009,376 dated March 7, 2006 to Chou, J.-C. and Wang, Y. F. describing an SnOa ISFET device, manufacturing method, and methods and apparatus for use thereof, chose the aspect ratio of 20 for the SnO2 ISFET. Aluminium was used as the contact metal.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,963,193 dated November 8, 2005 to Chou, J.C., and Tsai, H.-M. discloses an a-C:H ISFET device, manufacturing method, and testing methods and apparatus thereof, using aspect ratio (channel width/channel length) of 20 for the the a-C:H ISFET. Al was used as the contact metal.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,974,716 dated December 13, 2005 to Hsiung, S, S. K., Chou, J.-C., Sun, T.-P., Chung, W.-Y., Chin, Y.-L.; Ce, L.Z. (Method for Fabricating a Titanium Nitride Sensing Membrane on An EGFET) used a width to length (WIL) ratio of 600 um/20 u,m= 30, and Al as the contact metal.<br>
Based on the above literature survey and patent search as cited herein above, it is evident that aspect ratios ranging between 5 to 50 have been most widely used for ISFET fabrication. Examples of the use of higher aspect ratios are very scarce. CMOS/NMOS fabrication process, in a simple metal gate/polysilicon gate<br>
version, has been followed with the modification that there is no metal layer on the gate. Al, Cr-Au and Pt/Ti metallizations, have been used with Al being the most common.<br>
The main drawback of the above-referred works was that they were constrained to use an aspect ratio of the order of 50. This was primarily the result of the fabrication process employed. The low value of aspect ratio of these ISFETs did not make them suitable for use as sensors without enzymes.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the manufacture of ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) with a high aspect ratio and ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) made thereby, leading to fabrication of sensors with enhanced performance for chemical and biological applications, which obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art as detailed herein above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the fabrication of sensors without the use of enzymes for measuring concentrations of biological specimens that do not contain interfering ions.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the fabrication of sensors having a long shelf life for biological applications.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to ensure that the improved process is simple in implementation and economical.<br>
The process of the present invention for the manufacture of ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) with a high aspect ratio and ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) made thereby, has enabled fabrication of N-channel, enhancement mode ISFET with channel aspect ratio of 400 (channel width =<br>
4800 |^m, channel length = 12 p.m) using an interdigitated source-drain geometry. The process disclosed herein enables to overcome the implementational problem of high drain-source leakage current encountered in extremely large aspect ratio ISFETs. It comprises chromium-gold metallization followed by pre-sintering and cleaning in hot HNOs, water rinsing, dip in dilute HF and thorough water rinsing, after which the wafers are sintered in forming gas, with similar cleaning performed again after dicing of the wafers into chips.<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification, figure- 1 is a three-dimensional view showing an ion-sensitive field-effect transistor. Region 1 is the N+ source, region 2 is the N+ drain and region 3 is the silicon nitride-silicon dioxide gate without any metallization layer. Region 4 is the N-channel produced in the P-substrate 5 upon inversion. The complete device except the gate region 3 is covered with insulation layer 6 to prevent short circuit when the device is immersed in the analyte solution 7 for measurement. The drain-source bias (FDs) battery 8 makes the drain positive with respect to the grounded source. During operation, Fbs - 0.5-2V. The gate-source bias (Fos) battery 9 applies the gate voltage of 1-2 V through the Ag/AgCl reference electrode 10. The P-substrate 5 is kept grounded. The designed threshold voltage of the equivalent metal gate device is i V. Threshold voltage measured in pH=7 solution using Ag/AgCl reference electrode at VDS = 2V has been found to be FGS = 2.4V for /DS = 50 microampere and FGS = 2.8 V for IDS = 100 microampere.<br>
Figure-2 shows the geometrical layout of the high-transconductance ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (not to scale). The dimensions of the various marked regions in the diagram are as follows: Region 1: 1000 jam, Regions 2: 250 |xm, Region 3: 16 urn, Region 4: 50 urn, Region 5: 500 jam, Region 6: 700 ^m, Region 7: 250 ^m, Region 9: 400 u.m, Region 10: 1800 |im, Regions 1 1 : 300 ^m,<br><br>
Regions 14:300 |um, Region 15: 200 jam, and Region 16: 250 fj.m. Region 8 is the gate while regions 12 and 13 are source and drain respectively.<br>

The novelty of the process of the present invention for the manufacture of ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) with a high aspect ratio and ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) made thereby, leading to fabrication of sensors with enhanced performance for chemical and biological applications (without enzyme immobilization in cited cases), resides in the large channel aspect ratio for the ISFET structure having a high aspect ratio of the order of 400 and sub-threshold drain-source current between 10 to 100 nA, at a drain-source voltage of 0.5 V in darkness. Further, the ISFET structure manufactured by the process as herein described, having the top preconditioned gate layer (without enzyme immobilization), capable of determining concentrations of glucose and urea, enables elimination of the use of glucose oxidase enzyme and urease enzyme<br>
respectively, and increasing the shelf life of these sensors, suitable for measurements in absence of interfering ions.<br>
The inventive steps are the introduction of noble metal layer permitting acidic cleaning yielding the reduction of leakage current thus allowing the selection of a large channel aspect ratio for the ISFET structure. Particularly the introduction of chromium-gold metallization with acidic cleaning and subsequent sintering in a reducing ambient of wafers together with further acidic cleaning of the chips has reduced the drain-source leakage current, thus making the realization of high aspect ratio ISFET possible. Thus, the non-obvious inventive steps which have enabled realization of the novelty are the use of a large channel aspect ratio for the ISFET structure, and the necessary modification in the fabrication process to realize this structure, namely, HNOs and HF cleaning, gold sintering, and chip cleaning after wafer dicing.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. They do not restrain the generic nature and versatility of this platform for realization of sensors for chemical and biological applications.<br>
Example-1<br>
The process of the present invention was followed for ISFET fabrication. The surface of the gate dielectric was conditioned by immersion in deionized water of pH~7 for a period of one day (24 hours). Then the ISFET was biased at drain-source voltage FDS = 2V and gate-source voltage FGS = 1.5 V applied through an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, in pH=10 solution. Drain-source current /DS was 10 jitA. When the ISFET was dipped in pH=7 solution, /Ds increased to 21 jaA but was restored to the original value by decreasing FGS- The necessary change in FGS<br>
denoted by A PCS was determined. Similarly, the values for pH changes form 7 to<br>
4 and 10 to 4 were found out. The high transconductance of the ISFET resulted in large changes in IDS helping in accurate estimation of the pH sensitivity factor AFos/pH as 54mV/pH and establishing the linearity of pH response. Thus the device is useful for determination of an unknown pH with greater precision.<br>
