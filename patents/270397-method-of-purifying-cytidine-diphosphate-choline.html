[0003]<br>
1<br><br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method<br>
of purifying CDP-choline, in which method CDP-choline can be<br>

Effect of the Invention<br>
[0005]<br>
The present invention provides CDP-choline and a salt<br>
thereof at a low cost.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0006]<br>
The CDP-choline solution to be used in the present<br>
invention may be prepared by any method as long as it contains<br>
a nucleic acid analogue and has a pH of not less than 0.5 and<br>
not more than 5.0. When the prepared CDP-choline solution has<br>
a pH of 0.5 - 5.0, it is directly used. When the pH is higher<br>
than 5.0, an acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid,<br>
nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, is added, and when<br>
the pH is lower than 0.5, an alkali such as sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide and the like is added to adjust to pH 0.5<br>
- 5.0, preferably 1.0 - 3.5, before use.<br>
[0007]<br>
The H-type strongly acidic cation exchange resin may be<br>
of a gel type or a porous type, as long as it is an H-type<br>
strongly acidic cation exchange resin. Specific examples<br>
thereof include the Dowex series (e.g., HCR-S, HCR-W2,<br>
Marathon C, Monosphere 650C, MSC-1, Monosphere 88, 50W*2,<br>
50W*4, 50W*8 etc.) manufactured by Dow Chemical Company,<br>
Diaion SK series (e.g., SK1B, SK104, SK110, SK112 etc.)<br>
manufactured by Mitsubishi chemical, Diaion PK series (e.g.,<br>
PK208, PK212, PK220, PK228 etc.) manufactured by Mitsubishi<br>
Chemical, Amberlite series (e.g., IR120B, IR124 etc.)<br>
manufactured by Rohm and Haas and the like.<br>
3<br><br>
[0008]<br>
Degree of crosslinking of the H-type strongly acidic<br>
cation exchange resin is not particularly limited as long as<br>
CDP-choline and nucleic acid analogue can be separated at the<br>
degree of crosslinking. It is preferably 2 - 10%, more<br>
preferably 4-6%.<br>
In the present invention, the H-type strongly acidic<br>
cation exchange resin is preferably used in the form of a<br>
packed column, and as the column to be used in the present<br>
invention, any column may be used.<br>
The CDP-choline solution containing a nucleic acid<br>
analogue and having a pH of not less than 0.5 and not more<br>
than 5.0 is contacted with the H-type strongly acidic cation<br>
exchange resin by applying the solution to a column packed<br>
with the resin and the like to allow adsorption of CDP-choline<br>
onto the resin. For example, when the solution is applied to a<br>
column packed with an H-type strongly acidic cation exchange<br>
resin having a degree of crosslinking of 2 - 10%, the flow<br>
rate (SV) is 0.1 - 5.0, preferably 0.2 - 3.0.<br>
[0009]<br>
By the above-mentioned adsorption treatment, a nucleic<br>
acid analogue contained in the solution, particularly a<br>
pyrimidine type nucleic acid substance such as orotic acid,<br>
orotidine-5'-monophosphate (hereinafter to be abbreviated as<br>
OMP), uridine-5'-monophosphate (hereinafter to be abbreviated<br>
as UMP), uridine-5'-diphosphate (hereinafter to be abbreviated<br>
as UDP), UTP, CMP, cytidine-5'-diphosphate (hereinafter to be<br>
abbreviated as CDP), cytidine-5'-triphosphate (hereinafter to<br>
be abbreviated as CTP) and the like can be efficiently<br>
separated or removed from CDP-choline. Out of the nucleic acid<br>
analogues, uracil and UTP are particularly preferably<br>
separated and removed, since they hardly adsorb to or do not<br>
at all adsorb to the resin, when a CDP-choline solution<br>
containing uracil and UTP is brought into contact with the<br>
resin at a pH of not less than 0.5 and not more than 5.0.<br>
4<br><br>
[0010]<br>
CDP-choline adsorbed on the H-type strongly acidic cation<br>
exchange resin is eluted by applying an aqueous solution<br>
having an ion concentration of not more than 0.1 mol/L,<br>
preferably not more than 0.03 mol/L, more preferably water,<br>
and the like, whereby CDP-choline is eluted from the resin,<br>
for the separation and purification.<br>
Where necessary, the CDP-choline-containing solution<br>
collected by the above-mentioned elution step may be subjected<br>
to an activated carbon treatment or decolorization treatment<br>
using a nonpolar porous synthetic adsorbent, for example,<br>
Diaion HP series (e.g., HP20, HP21 etc.) manufactured by<br>
Mitsubishi Chemical, Diaion SP800 series (e.g., SP825, SP850<br>
etc.) manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical, Diaion SP200 series<br>
(e.g., SP207 etc.) manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical,<br>
Amberlite XAD series (e.g., XAD4, XAD7HP, XAD16HP, XAD1180,<br>
XAD2000 etc.) manufactured by Rohm and Haas and the like.<br>
[0011]<br>
The above-mentioned CDP-choline-containing solution or<br>
decolorized solution is adjusted to pH 2.0 - 4.0 with acid or<br>
alkali. After concentration is carried out as necessary, the<br>
concentration of CDP-choline is adjusted to 50 - 800 g/L,<br>
preferably 100 - 700 g/L, and crystals of CDP-choline can be<br>
obtained using an organic solvent, preferably a hydrophilic<br>
organic solvent such as acetone, ethanol, methanol, propanol<br>
and the like.<br>
In addition, the above-mentioned CDP-choline-containing<br>
solution or decolorized solution is adjusted to pH 5.0 - 9.5<br>
with sodium hydroxide. After concentration is carried out as<br>
necessary, the concentration of CDP-choline is adjusted to 50<br>
- 800 g/L, preferably 100 - 700 g/L, and crystals of CDP-<br>
choline sodium salt can be obtained using an organic solvent,<br>
preferably a hydrophilic organic solvent such as acetone,<br>
ethanol, methanol, propanol and the like.<br>
[0012]<br>
5<br><br>
Examples of the method of obtaining CDP-choline crystals<br>
using an organic solvent include a method comprising adding an<br>
organic solvent to a CDP-choline solution to allow<br>
precipitation of crystals, and a method comprising adding<br>
dropwise a CDP-choline solution to a large amount of an<br>
organic solvent to allow precipitation of crystals.<br>
In the present invention, the CDP-choline solution<br>
containing a nucleic acid analogue may be any as long as it is<br>
a solution containing CDP-choline and a nucleic acid analogue.<br>
Examples thereof include a solution produced by a chemical<br>
synthetic method, a method using a biocatalyst having an<br>
activity to produce CDP-choline from a precursor of UTP and<br>
choline or phosphorylcholine (hereinafter to be abbreviated as<br>
CDP-choline-producing activity).<br>
[0013]<br>
Examples of the biocatalyst include a culture of a<br>
microorganism having a CDP-choline-producing activity, a<br>
treated culture thereof, an enzyme that catalyzes a reaction<br>
to produce CDP-choline and the like.<br>
As the microorganism, any microorganism can be used as<br>
long as it has a CDP-choline-producing activity. A<br>
microorganism inherently having a CDP-choline-producing<br>
activity can be used as it is for the production of CDP-<br>
choline, and a microorganism naturally having no CDP-choline-<br>
producing activity can be used for the production of CDP-<br>
choline by introducing a DNA encoding an enzyme that catalyzes<br>
a reaction to produce CDP-choline from a precursor of UTP and<br>
choline or phosphocholine. Preferable examples of the<br>

Manual, Third Edition, Sambrook et al. edit, Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Laboratory (2001), incorporating the DNA into an<br>
expression vector to prepare a recombinant DNA, and<br>
transforming the above-mentioned microorganism as a host cell.<br>
[0023]<br>
First, a DNA encoding PyrG, CCT or CKI is obtained from<br>
the above-mentioned plasmid pMW6, plasmid pCC41 or plasmid<br>
pCKID and, based on the obtained DNA, a DNA fragment having a<br>
suitable length and containing a part encoding the polypeptide<br>
is prepared as necessary.<br>
Where necessary, moreover, a DNA wherein nucleotide of<br>
the nucleotide sequence of a partial DNA fragment<br>
corresponding to a CDP-choline-producing enzyme are<br>
substituted so as to provide a codon optimal for the<br>
expression of a host cell is prepared. The DNA is useful for<br>
an efficient production of a CDP-choline-producing enzyme.<br>
[0024]<br>
A recombinant vector is produced by inserting the DNA<br>
fragment or full-length DNA into the downstream of a promoter<br>
of a suitable expression vector. In this case, DNA encoding a<br>
CDP-choline-producing enzyme may be independently inserted<br>
11<br><br>
into an expression vector, or plural DNAs may be inserted into<br>
the same expression vector.<br>
The recombinant vector is introduced into a host cell<br>
suitable for the expression vector.<br>
[0025]<br>
As the host cell, the above-mentioned microorganisms can<br>
be mentioned.<br>
As the expression vector, one capable of autonomous<br>
replication or one capable of being incorporated into a<br>
chromosome in the host cell, and having a promoter at a site<br>
permitting transcription of a DNA encoding a CDP-choline-<br>
producing enzyme can be used.<br>
When prokaryote such as bacterium and the like is used as<br>
a host cell, a recombinant vector having a DNA encoding a CDP-<br>
choline-producing enzyme is preferably autonomously<br>
replicatable in a prokaryote, as well as constituted with a<br>
promoter, a ribosome binding sequence, the DNA and a<br>
transcription termination sequence. A gene regulating the<br>
promoter may also be contained.<br>
[0026]<br>

(manufactured by Pharmacia), pET system (manufactured by<br>
Novagen) and the like.<br>

is functionable in the host cell. Examples of the promoter<br>
include those derived from Escherichia coli, phage and the<br>
like, such as trp promoter (PtrP), lac promoter,' PL promoter, PR<br>
promoter, T7 promoter and the like. In addition, a promoter<br>
having an artificially altered design such as a promoter<br>
(Ptrp*2) in which two Ptrp are sequently connected in tandem, tac<br>
promoter, lac T7 promoter and let I promoter, and the like can<br>
also be used.<br>
[0028]<br>
It is preferable to use a plasmid in which the distance<br>
between a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (ribosome binding sequence)<br>
and an initiation codon is adjusted to a suitable distance<br>
(e.g., 6 to 18 bases).<br>
In the recombinant vector of the present invention, a<br>
transcription termination sequence is not always necessarily<br>
for the expression of a DNA encoding a CDP-choline-producing<br>
enzyme. However, it is preferable to place a transcription<br>
termination sequence directly downstream the structure gene.<br>
[0029]<br>
As a method of introducing the recombinant vector, any<br>
method can be used as long as a DNA can be introduced into the<br>

Example 1<br>
Purification of CDP-choline using strongly acidic cation<br>
exchange resin<br>
CDP-choline (50 g; manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical<br>
Industries, Ltd.), uracil (2 g; manufactured by Nacalai<br>
Tesque) and UTP (1 g; manufactured by Nacalai Tesque) were<br>
dissolved in water to prepare 5 L of CDP-choline solution. The<br>
solution was adjusted to pH 3.0 with sulfuric acid and applied<br>
to a column packed with a strongly acidic cation exchange<br>
resin Diaion PK208 (H-type) (10 L) with a crosslinking degree<br>
of 4%. Subsequently, water was applied, and a fraction wherein<br>
each concentration of uracil and UTP was less than 0.1% (w/w)<br>
relative to CDP-choline was obtained as a result of analysis<br>

filtration, washed with 100% ethanol solution, and dried under<br>
reduced pressure at 20°C for 3 days. As the result, 40 g of<br>
CDP-choline crystals, wherein each concentration of uracil and<br>

seed-cultured with shaking at 600 rpm at 32°C under culture<br>
condition of airflow 2.5 L/minute while adjusting the mixture<br>
to pH 6.8 with concentrated aqueous ammonia. At the time point<br>
when glucose in the supernatant of the above-mentioned seed-<br>
culture medium was consumed, the culture (350 mL) was<br>
aseptically collected, inoculated to a 5 L culture bath<br>
containing a liquid medium (2.5 L) having a composition of<br>
glucose (180 g/L), KH2P04 (10 g/L), K2HP04 (10 g/L), MgS04-7H20<br>

600 rpm at 32°C under culture condition of airflow 2.5 L/minute<br>
while adjusting the mixture to pH 6.8 with concentrated<br>
25<br><br>
aqueous ammonia. The culturing was ceased at the time point<br>
when glucose in the culture supernatant was consumed.<br>
[0060]<br>
The culture (360 mL) of Escherichia coli MM294/pCKG55<br>
strain and the culture (360 mL) of Corynebacterium-ammoniagenes<br>
ATCC21170 strain thus obtained were placed in a 2 L culture<br>
bath, glucose (100 g/L), orotic acid (10 g/L), choline<br>
chloride (8.4 g/L), MgS04-7H20 (5 g/L) and xylene (20 mL/L)<br>
were added thereto, and distilled water was added to allow the<br>
total amount to be 800 mL. The mixture was reacted with<br>
shaking at 800 rpm at 32°C under the condition of airflow 0.8<br>
L/minute while adjusting the mixture to pH 7.2 with ION sodium<br>
hydroxide. During the reaction, KH2P04 was added as<br>
appropriate to keep the concentration of phosphoric acid in<br>
the supernatant of the reaction mixture at 1 - 5 g/L as KH2P04.<br>
The reaction was carried out for 23 hours to obtain 11.0 g/L<br>
of CDP-choline.<br>
[0061]<br>
Four batches of the above-mentioned reaction mixture were<br>
adjusted to pH 1.0 with sulfuric acid, cells were separated by<br>
centrifugation (7000 rpm, 10 min), and water was added to the<br>
obtained supernatant to make the total amount 6 L (CDP-choline<br>
6.0 g/L, uracil 0.5 g/L, UTP 1.0 g/L). This<br>
cytidinediphosphoric choline solution was applied to a column<br>
packed with a strongly acidic cation exchange resin Diaion<br>
SK104 (H-type, 10 L) having a crosslinking degree of 4%.<br>
Subsequently, water was applied, and a fraction, in which each<br>
concentration of uracil, UTP was less than 0.1%(w/w) relative<br>
to CDP-choline (analyzed by high performance liquid<br>
chromatography) was collected. The CDP-choline fraction was<br>
decolorized using activated carbon, and then concentrated to<br>
100 mL. Ethanol (350 mL) was gradually added to the<br>
concentrated solution, and the precipitated crystals were<br>
collected by filtration. The obtained crystals were washed<br>
with 100% ethanol solution, and then dried under reduced<br>
26<br><br>
pressure at 20°C for 3 days. As a result, CDP-choline crystals<br>
(18 g), in which each concentration of uracil, UTP was less<br>
than 0.1% (w/w) relative to CDP-choline, were obtained.<br>
Example 3<br>
Purification of CDP-choline sodium salt from a culture of<br>
microorganism having an ability to produce CDP-choline<br>
Four batches of the reaction mixture obtained in the same<br>
manner as in Example 2 were adjusted to pH 1.0 with sulfuric<br>
acid, cells were separated by centrifugation (7000 rpm, 10<br>
min), and water was added to the obtained supernatant to make<br>
the total amount 6 L (CDP-choline 6.0 g/L, uracil 0.5 g/L, UTP<br>
1.0 g/L). This cytidine diphosphate choline solution was<br>
applied to a column packed with a strongly acidic cation<br>
exchange resin Diaion SK104 (H-type, 10 L) having a<br>
crosslinking degree of 4%. Subsequently, water was applied,<br>
and a fraction, in which each concentration of uracil, UTP was<br>
less than 0.1%(w/w) relative to CDP-choline (analyzed by high<br>
performance liquid chromatography) was collected. The CDP-<br>
choline fraction was adjusted to pH 7.5 with sodium hydroxide,<br>
decolorized with activated carbon, and then concentrated to<br>
100 mL. Ethanol (400 mL) was gradually added to the<br>
concentrated solution, and the precipitated crystals were<br>
collected by filtration. The obtained crystals were washed<br>
with 100% ethanol solution, and then dried under reduced<br>
pressure at 20°C for 3 days. As a result, CDP-choline sodium<br>
salt crystals (20 g), in which each concentration of uracil,<br>
UTP was less than 0.1% (w/w) relative to CDP-choline, were<br>
obtained.<br>
[0063]<br>
From the foregoing results, it has been clarified that<br>
CDP-choline or a salt thereof free from impurity can be<br>
obtained conveniently by treating a CDP-choline solution<br>
containing a nucleic acid analogue only once with a strongly<br>
acidic cation exchange resin.<br>
