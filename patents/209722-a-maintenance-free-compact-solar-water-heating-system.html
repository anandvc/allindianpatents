TITLE<br>
"A MAINTENANCE. FREE COMPACT SOLAR WATER HEATING.. SYSTEM"<br><br>
APPLICANT<br>
SANGEETA M SAKHADEO, an Indian national, of Flat 4  Rohan Park, Near Padmavati Temple, Sahakarnagar No.l, Pune 411 009, Maharashtra, India  and  ANANT WAGH, an Indian national, of 15/4A  Vasudeo Estate, Opp.Shankar maharaj Temple, Pune-Satara Road, Pune  411 043, Maharashtra, India<br>
26-9-2005<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
The present invention relates to solar   water heating system. This invention particularly relates to solar       water heating system with heat exchanger.<br>
There is at present a scarcity of energy around the world. The power consumption is rising at faster rate and no single source of energy is adequate to meet the ever increasing need of the growing population. The conventional energy sources are limited and are not every -lasting. It is well accepted that the solar energy offers a better alternative to other sources of renewable energies.<br>
India is blessed with considerable solar insolation.<br>
The average daily insolation in central India is about 5.5<br>
Kwh/sq.mtr. with maximum not exceeding 7.0 Kwh/sw.mtr. There is a tremendous amount of clean, non-pollutant and almost inexhaustable energy. It is no wonder that intense efforts are going all over the world to develop techniques and technologies to convert solar energy into useful forms of energy, more particularly storable energy.<br><br><br><br>
1)	Thermal<br>
2)	Photovoltaic Energy Conversion<br>
3)	Biomass.<br>
All three approaches are being persued and they are at different stages of development and utilisation. In the first approach, solar energy is collected using a variety of Collectors and then it is converred   into thermal energy. There are different types of Collectors, out of which Flat Plate Collectors are most commonly used.<br>
Domestic Solar Water Heaters are becoming more and more popular now-a-days due to its simplicity of operation. Continuous research and development work is required for achievement of its maximum efficiency at reasonable cost.<br>
Basically Solar Water Heating Systems are of two types-<br>
1)	Thermosyphon; and<br>
2)	Forced Flow.<br><br><br>
Further, the classification can be extended to      <br>
3)	Direct Systems; and<br>
4)	Indirect Systems.<br>
Thermosyphon type of solar water water heating consists of Solar Collectors, Insulated Tank, System Piping and Distributing Piping. The water in collector tubes get heated due to solar radiation and rises up in the tank due to natural convection. The cold water replaces the hot water forming a natural chain. This system is suitable for Domestic purpose ie. for small capacity water heating.<br>
For commercial applications, Forced Flow system is preferred. It consists of Solar Collectors, Insulated Tank, System Piping, Pump or Motor set, Temperature Controller, Control Panel etc. The water is forced through Collector tubes and gets accumulated in Storage Tank at required temperature.<br>
In direct system, the water circulates and recirculates through Collector tubes, Storage Tank and associated pipelines. This system is not suitable for hard water which may detoriate life of components included in the system.<br><br>
Indirect system is the Closed Loop system.          Heat Exchangers are used in which primary heat transfser 'fluid is filled, which does not come in contact with actual water for use. Systems with heat exchanger are specially useful for hard and borewell water heating. This system can be used with or without pumps for circulation.<br>
In  India,  in  many states  like  Gujrat,  Rajasthan,<br>
Marathwada  Region  in  Maharashtra,  hard  water  is  readily<br>
available.  Heating  of hard water with normal  solar water<br>
heaters becomes troublesome due to detoriation of components.<br>
The use of borewell water in solar water heaters is restricted<br>
due to its hardness. The major problems are scale formation,<br>
reduced flow rate,  reduced heating and frequent down time<br>
for cleaning. Water treatment is done by water softening plant<br>
which is based on technique of counter flow regeneration.<br>
The unit is complex in nature, dependent on electric supply,<br>
time consuming and requires creation of very high pressures<br>
for  operation.  For  proper  operation,  the  softening  plant<br>
requires additional accessories like pressure guages, hardness<br>
test kit. The overall cost of unit increases.<br><br><br>
A maintenance free compact solar water heating system comprising a water storage tank for hard water, a water circulating tank connected wim the storage tank, a heat exchanger wim an inlet for sofi/distilled water installed within the said water circulating tank wim an outlet tap and a solar heat collector characterized in mat me said soil/distilled water is circulated within the solar heat collector and heat exdianger via inlet and outlet of the heat exchanger , to heat the said heat exchanger due to convection and resulting heating up of the circulated hard water without making any contact with the components of solar water heater.<br>
m the above- mentioned maintenance free compact solar water heating system, the water storage tank and the water circulating tank are conveniently located so as to have an easy flow of the water from the source to the storage tank to the heat exchanger housed within said water circulating tank.<br>
In the Bolar heating system of the present invention the heat exchanger is connected to said solar heat collector so mat the flow of water controls the temperature of the solar cells / collector at a predetermined value, with the help of calculated value with relation between amount of sun ray falling on collector surface and amount of soft water circulating.<br><br><br>
In die heating system of the present invention the water pump may be conveniently used to circulate water through the solar heat collector and / or between the water storage tank and circulating tank. The said solar heat collector is preferably and conveniently positioned below the heat exchanger for the optimum operation of the syBtem.<br>
The present invention is described hereinbelow with reference to the drawings accompanying the Provisional Specification.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 a Heat Exchanger (10) is installed inside the water circulating tank (30). The outlet (IS) and intlet (20) of collector (25) is connected to Heat Exchanger (10). Distilled or Soft Water can be filled and circulated in the Collector and Heat Exchanger through an inlet (F). The hard water from storage tank (12) positioned above the circulating tank (30) with an outlet tap (T) is passed through the tank (30) outside the Heat Exchanger (10) which gete heated due to convection. So in the unit, the hard water does not come in contact with components of solar water heater i.e. Collector finB and Tubes. The distilled water is circulated again and agaia It is refilled wimin a month or so. The system is totally non-conventional and independent of electric supply.<br><br><br>
The salient features which are distinctly         advantageous over the conventional solar heat exchanger are  as follows-<br>
1)	The unit is compact,	no extra space is required for installation of softening plant and its accessories.<br>
2)	The unit is totally	non-conventional independent of electric supply.<br>
3)	Cost is tremendously	reduced due to elimination of softening plant.<br>
4)	life of overall unit	is increased due to elimination of components, like	softners, which are complex in nature.<br>
5)   The  unit  is  maintenance-free,  only  refilling  of distilled water should be done once in a month or so.<br><br>
WE CLAM:<br>
1.	A maintenance free compact solar water heating system comprising a water storage tank (12) for hard water, a water circulating tank (30) connected with the storage tank, a heat exchanger (10) with an inlet (F) for soft/distilled water installed within the said water circulating tank with an outlet tap (T) and a Bolar heat collector (25) characterized in mat the said soft/distilled water is circulated within the solar heat collector (25) and heat exchanger (10) via inlet (15) and outlet (20) of the heat exchanger (10), to heat the Baid heat exchanger (10) due to convection and resulting heating up of the circulated hard water without making any contact with the components of solar water heater.<br>
