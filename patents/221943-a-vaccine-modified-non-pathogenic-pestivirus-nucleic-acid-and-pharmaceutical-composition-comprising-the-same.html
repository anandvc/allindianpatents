 A      VACCINE,       MODIFIED NON-PATHOGENIC PESTIVIRUS NUCLEIC<br>
.   ACID AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION COMPRISING THE SAME"<br>
BOEHRINGER    INGELHEIM . VETMEDICA    GMBH,    a    German company, of D-55216 Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and.<br>
the manner in which it is to be performed:   	GRANTED<br><br>
The present invention relates to a       . vaccine,	modified non-pathogenic<br>
pestivirus, nucleic acid and pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.<br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   a   method   for   attenuating pestiviruses  by  inactivating  the  ribonuclease   activiry(RNase  activity)   . residing in glycoprotein ERNS    The invention also relates to pestiviruses attenuated according to the invention, nucleic acid for preparing such pestivruses, vaccines and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the attenuated pestiviruses of the invention.   The invention further relates to    . methods  for   distinguishing  between   the   attenuated  viruses   of the<br>
invention and pathogenic viruses.<br>
Pestiviruses   are   causative   agents   of  economically   important<br>
diseases of animals in many countries worldwide.   Presently known virus<br>
isolates have been grouped into three different species which together<br>
form one genus within the family Flaviviridae.<br>
I	Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) causes bovine viral diarrhea<br>
(BVD) and mucosal disease (MD) in cattle (Baker 1987; Moenning and<br>
Plagemann, 1992; Thielet al., 1996).<br>
II	Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), formerly named hog cholera virus, is responsible for classical swine fever (CSF) or hog cholera (HC) Moenning and Plagemann, 1992; Thiel et al., 1996),<br>
III	Border disease virus (BDV) is typically found in sheep and causes border disease (BD). Symptoms similar to MD in cattle have also been described to occur after intrauterine infection of lambs with BDV (Moennig and Plagemann, 1992; Thiel et al, 1996).<br>
An alternative classification of pestiviruses is provided by Becher et al (1995) or others.<br>
Pestiviruses are small enveloped viruses with a single stranded RNA genome of positive polarity lacking both 5' cap and 3' poly(A) sequences. The viral genome codes for a polyprotein of about 4000 amino acids giving rise to final cleavage products by co-and    posttranslational    rocessing involving cellular and    viral<br><br><br>
proteases. The viral proteins are arranged in the polyprotein in the order NH2-Npro-C-ERNS-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-COOH (Rjce.  1996). Protein C and the glycoproteins ERNS, E1  and E2 represent structural components of the pestivirus virion (Thiel et al., 1991). E2 and to a lesser extent ERNS were found to be targets for antibody neutralization (Donis et a!., 1988; Paton et al., 1992; van Rijn et al., 1993; Weiland etal., 1990.1992). ERNS lacks a membrane anchor and is secreted in considerable amounts from the infected cells; this protein has been reported to exhibit RNase activity (Hulst et al., .1994; Schneider et al., 1993; Windisch et al., 1996). The function of this enzymatic activity for the viral life cycle is presently unknown. In the ease of a CSFV vaccine strain experimental destruction of the RNase by site directed mutagenesis has been reported to result in a cytopathogenic virus that has growth characteristics in cell culture equivalent to wild type virus (Hulst et al., 1998). The enzymatic activity depends on the presence of two stretches of anino acids conserved between the pestivirus ERNS and different known RNases of plant and fungal origin. Both of these conserved sequences contain a histidine residue (Schneider et al., 1993). Exchange of each of these residues against lysine in the ERNS protein of a CSFV vaccine strain resulted in the destruction of RNase activity (Hulst et al., 1998). Introduction of these mutations into the genome of the CSFV vaccine strain did not influence viral viability or growth properties but led to a virus exhibiting a slightly cytopathogenic phenotype (Hulst etal., 1998).<br>
Vaccines comprising attenuated or killed viruses or viral proteins expressed in heterologous expression systems have been generated for CSFV and BVDV and are presently used. The structural basis of the attenuation of these viruses used as life vaccines is not known. This leads to the risk of unpredictable revertants by backmutation or recombination subsequent to  vaccination. On the other hand, the efficacy of inactivated vaccines or heterologously expressed viral proteins (subunit vaccines) in the induction of immunity is rather low.<br>
In general, live vaccines with defined mutations as a basis for attenuation would allow to avoid the disadvantages of the present generation of vaccines. Potential targets for attenuating mutations in pestiviruses are not available at present. A further advantage of said attenuating mutations lies in their molecular uniqueness which allows to use them as distinctive labels for an attenuated pestiviruses and to distinguish them from pestiviruses from the field.<br><br><br><br><br>
Because of the importance of an effective and safe as well as detectable prophylaxis and treatment of pestiviral infections, there is a strong need for live and specifically attenuated vaccines with a high potential for induction of immunity as well as a 5     defined basis of attenuation which can  also be distinguished  from  pathogenic pestiviruses.<br>
Therefore, the technical problem underlying the present invention is to provide specifically attenuated and detectably labeled pestiviruses for use as live attenuated 10     vaccines with a high efficiency for the induction of immunity which, as a result of this method, can also be distinguished from pathogenic pestiviruses from the field.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
15     The solution to the above technical problem is achieved by the description and the embodiments characterized in the claims.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that pestiviruses can be specifically attenuated by the inactivation of the RNase activity residing in glycoprotein ERNS The attenuated pestiviruses now provide live vaccines of high immunogenicity.<br>
20     Therefore, in one aspect the present invention provides a live vaccine comprising a pestivirus, wherein the RNase activity residing in glycoprotein ERNS is inactivated. The   term   "vaccine"   as   used   herein   refers   to   a   pharmaceutical   composition comprising   at   least   one   immunologically   active   component   that   induces   an immunological response in an animal and possibly but not necessarily one or more<br>
25 additional components that enhance the immunological" activity of said active component. A vaccine may. additionally comprise further components typical to pharmaceutical compostions. The immunologically active component of a vaccine may comprise complete live organisms in either its original form or as attenuated organisms in a so called modified live vaccine (MLV) or organisms inactivated by<br>
30 appropriate methods in a so called killed vaccine (KV). In another form the immunologically active component of a vaccine may comprise appropriate elements of said organisms (subunit vaccines) whereby these elements are generated either by destroying the whole organism or the growth cultures of such organisms and subsequent purification steps yielding in the desired structure(s). or by synthetic<br><br>
processes induced by an appropriate manipulation of a suitable system like, but not restricted to bacteria, insects, mammalian or other species plus subsequent isolation and purification procedures or by induction of said synthetic processes in the animal needing   a   vaccine   by direct  incorporation   of  genetic   material   using  suitable 5     pharmaceutical compositions (polynucleotide vaccination). A vaccine may comprise one or simultaneously more than one of the elements described above. Additional components to enhance the immune response are constituents commonly referred to as adjuvants, like e.g. aluminiumhydroxide.  mineral or other oils or ancillary molecules added to the vaccine or generated  by the body after the 10     respective induction  by such additional* components, like but  not restricted to interferons, interleukins or growth factors.<br>
A "pharmaceutical composition" essentially consists of one or more ingredients capable of modifying physiological e.g. immunological functions of the organism it is inistered to, or of organisms living in or on its surface like but not restricted to 15     antibiotics or antiparasitics, as well as other constituents added to it in order to achieve certain other objectives like, but not limited to, processing traits, sterility, stability, feasibility to administer the composition via enteral or parenteral routes such as oral, intranasal, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous  intradermal or other suitable route, tolerance after administration, controlled release properties. 20      A vaccine of the invention refers to a vaccine as defined above, wherein one immunologically active component is a pestivirus or of pestiviral origin. The term "live vaccine" refers to a vaccine comprising a living, in particular, a living viral active component.<br>
The term "pestivirus" as used herein refers to all pestiviruses, characterized by 25     belonging to the same genus as BVDV, CSFV and BDV within the family Flaviviridae<br>
and by their expression of glycoprotein ERNS.Of course, said term also refers to all<br>
pestiviruses  as characterized  by Becher" ef al.   (1995)  or others  that express<br>
glycoprotein  ERNS.  "RNase  activity" as  used   herein  refers  to  the  ability of the<br>
glycoprotein ERNS to hydrolyze RNA.<br>
30      It should be noted that the term glycoprotein EO is often used synonymously to<br>
glycoprotein ERNS in publications.<br>
The term "inactivation of the RNase activity residing in said glycoprotein" refers to the<br>
inability or reduced capability of a modified glycoprotein ERNS to hydrolyze RNA as<br>
compared to the unmodified wild type of said glycoprotein ERNS.<br><br><br>
inactivation of the RNase activity residing in glycoprotein E can be achieved by deletions and/or mutations of at least one amino acid of said glycoprotein as demonstrated herein and by Hulst et al. (1998). Therefore, in a preferred embodiment the present invention relates to live vaccines, wherein said RNase activity is inactivated by deletions and/or mutations of at least one amino acid of said glycoprotein.<br>
It has been shown that the glycoprotein ERNS forms a disulfide-bonded homodimer of about 97 kD, wherein each monomer consists of 227 amino acids corresponding to the amino acids 268 to 494 of the CSFV polyprotein as described by Rumenapf et al. (1993). The first 495 amino acids as expressed by the Alfort strain of CSFV are shown in figure 1 for reference purpose only. The genome sequence-of the Alfort strain of CSFV is available in the GenBank/EMBL data library under accession number J04358; alternatively, the amino acid sequence for the BVDV strain CP7 can b*ef accessed in the GenBank/EMBL data library (accession number U63479). Two regions of amino acids are highly conserved in glycoprotein ERNS as well as in some plant and fungal RNase-active proteins (Schneider et al., 1993). These two regions are of particular importance to the RNase enzymatic activity. The first region consists of the region at the amino acids at position 295 to 307 an8l the second region consists of the amino acids at position 338 to 357 of said viral polyprotein as exemplified by figure 1 for the Alfort strain of CSFV (numbering according to the published deduced amino acid sequence of CSFV strain Alfort (Meyers et al., 1989). The amino acids of particular importance to the RNase activity as mentioned above are by no means limited to the exact position as defined for the-Alfort strain of CSFV but are simply used in an exemplary manner to point out the preferred amino acids being at that position or corresponding to that position in other strains such as found in BVDV, BDV and pestiviruses in general since they are highly conserved. For pestiviruses other than the CSFV Alfort strairr'the numbering of the positions of the preferred amino acids is often different but an expert in the field of the molecular biology of pestiviruses will easily identify these  preferred  amino acids by their position relative to the highly conserved amino acids of said glycoprotein. In one particular non-limiting  example,  the  position of CSFV Alfort 346  is identical to position 349 of BVDV strain cp7.<br>
As a consequence, the present invention relates in a more preferred embodiment to a vaccine of the invention, wherein said inactivating deletions and/or mutations are<br><br><br><br>
located at the amino acids at position 295 to 307 and/or position 338 to 357. as described in figure 1 for the CSFV Alfort strain in an exemplary manner or corresponding thereto in other strains, of said glycoprotein:<br>
In a very preferred embodiment the present invention discloses that the inactivation of said RNase activity by deletion or mutation of the amino acid at position 346 of said glycoprotein leads to particularly useful live vaccines. Therefore, the present invention relates to vaccines according to the invention, wherein said Rnase activity is inactivated by deletion or mutation of the amino acid at position 346, as described in figure 1 for the CSFV Alfort strain in an exemplary manner or corresponding thereto in other strains, of said glycoprotein.<br>
The present invention demonstrates that pestiviruses are viable and code for an E      protein without RNase activity when the histidine residue ai position 346 di the viral   polyprotein   (numbering   according   to   the   published   sequence   of  CSFV A|fort/Tubingen (Meyers et al.,  1989)). which represents one of the conserved putative active site residues of the ERNS RNase,  is deleted.  It has also been demonstrated for this invention that the deletion of the respective histidine in the ERNS   of a BVD pestivirus (position 349, numbered according to the sequence of BVDV CP7 GenBank/EMBL data library (accession number U63479)) results in a viable virus in which the ERNS glycoprotein has lost the RNase activity. In contrast to point mutations changing one amino acid into another, a deletion mutant is generally much more stable with respect to revertants. Infection of pigs with a mutant of the pathogenic CSFV Alfort/Tubingen expressing ERNS with this deletion did not lead to fever or other typical clinical signs of CSFV infections whereas the infection with wild type virus resulted in fever, diarrhea, anorexia, apathy, depletion of B-cells and central nervous disorders. These pigs were killed in a moribund stage showing severe hemorrhages in the skin and internal organs 14 days post inoculation. The pigs infected with the mutant did neither show viremia nor B-cell depletion as tested on days 3, 5, 7. 10. 14 post infection while CSFV was easily isolated from blood samples derived from the pigs inoculated with wild type virus. The deletion mutant apparently replicated in the animals as indicated by the induction of neutralizing antibodies (see Example 3, Table 3c). The immune response to the mutant virus was sufficient to permit to survive a lethal challenge with 2x105 TCID50 of the highly pathogenic   infection   with   the   CSFV   strain   Eystrup   (Konig,    1994)   which   is heterologous to the Alfort strain. Moreover, the tested animals displayed ho typical<br><br><br>
clinical signs for CSFV infection like fever, diarrhea, hemorrhages.'B-cell depletion or anorexia after the challenge infection. This data demonstrates that infection of pigs with the deletion mutant induces an immune response sufficient for protection against a stringent challenge.<br>
Therefore, in a most preferred embodiment, the invention relates to vaccines according to the invention, wherein said RNase activity is inactivated by the deletion of the histidine residue at position 346, as described in figure 1 for the CSFV Alfort strain in an exemplary manner or corresponding thereto in other strains, of said glycoprotein.<br>
Jn a further-most preferred embodiment, the invention relates to BVDV vaccines according to the invention, wherein said RNase activity is inactivated by the deletion of the histidine residue at position 346, as described in figure 1 for the CSFV Alfort strain in an exemplary manner or corresponding thereto in other BVDV strains, of said glycoprotein.<br>
In another aspect the present invention relates to attenuated pestiviruses, wherein the RNase activity residing in glycoprotein ERNSis inactivated by deletions and/or mutations of at least one amino acid of said glycoprotein with the proviso that the amino acids at position 297 and/or 346 of said glycoprotein as described in figure 1 for CSFV are not lysine. A recombinant pestivirus, wherein amino acids at position 297 and/or 346 of said glycoprotein are lysine has been described by Hulst et al. in 1998. These particular pestiviruses demonstrated cytopathic effects in swine kidney cells. Up to now, there has been total unawareness of the surprising and innovative attenuating feature due to the inactivation of the ERNS enzymatic activity. In a preferred embodiment for the reasons stated above "for vaccines the present invention also relates to pestiviruses according to the invention, wherein said RNase activity is inactivated by deletions and/or mutations located at the amino acids at position 295 to 307 and/or position 338 to 357, as described in figure 1 for the CSFV Alfort strain in an exemplary manner or corresponding thereto in other strains, of said glycoprotein.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment for the reasons stated above for vaccines the present invention also relates to pestiviruses of the invention, wherein said RNase activity is inactivated by deletion or mutation of the amino acid at position 346. as<br><br><br><br>
described  in  figure  1   for the  CSFV Aifort strain  in  an  exemplary manner or corresponding thereto in other strains, of said glycoprotein.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment for the reasons stated above for vaccines the present invention also relates to pestiviruses, wherein said RNase activity is 5 inactivated by the deletion of the histidine residue at position 346, as described in figure 1 for the CSFV Aifort strain in an exemplary manner or corresponding thereto in other strains, of said glycoprotein.<br>
In a further most preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to BVDV pestiviruses, wherein said RNase activity is inactivated by the deletion of the histidine 10 residue at position 346, as described in figure 1 for the CSFV Aifort strain in an exemplary manner or corresponding thereto in other BVDV strains, of said glycoprotein.<br>
Hhte attenuated pestiviruses and active components of the vaccines of the present 15 invention can easily be prepared by nucleic acid-modifying recombinant techniques resulting in the expression of a mutant amino acid sequence in glycoprotein ERNS. Therefore, a further aspect of the present invention relates to nucleic acids coding for a glycoprotein ERNS, wherein the RNase activity residing in said glycoprotein is inactivated  by deletions  and/or mutations  of at least one  amino  acid of said<br>
20     glycoprotein with the proviso that the amino acids at position 297 and/or 346 of the<br>
;  glycoprotein as described in figure 1 for the CSFV Aifort strain are not lysine.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the present invention relates, for reasons as mentioned<br>
above, to nucleic acids according to the invention, wherein said RNase activity is<br>
inactivated by deletions and/or mutations that are located at the amino acids at<br>
25 position 295 to 307 and/or position 338 to 357, as described in figure 1 for the CSFV Aifort strain in an exemplary manner or corresponding thereto in other strains, of said glycoprotein.<br>
In  a  more  preferred embodiment the present invention  relates,  for reasons as mentioned for vaccines, to nucleic acids according to the invention, wherein said<br>
30 RNase activity is inactivated by deletion or mutation of the amino acid at position 346, as described in figure 1 for the CSFV Aifort strain in an exemplary manner or corresponding thereto in other strains, of said glycoprotein.<br>
In  a  most preferred  embodiment the present invention  relates to nucleic acids according to the invention, wherein said RNase activity is inactivated by the deletion<br><br>
of the histidine residue at position 346. as described in figure 1 for the CSFV Alfort<br>
strain in an exemplary manner or corresponding thereto in other strains, of said<br>
glycoprotein.<br>
In a further most preferred embodiment the present invention relates to BVDV<br>
nucleic acids accordirig to the invention, wherein said RNase activity is inactivated by<br>
the deletion of the histidine residue at position 346. as described in figure 1 for the<br>
CSFV Aifort strain in an exempfary manner or corresponding thereto in other BVDV<br>
strains, of said glycoprotein.<br>
Nucleotides, e.g. DNA or RNA. are also useful for preparing DNA-, RNA- and/or<br>
vector-vaccines. In these vaccines, the nucleotides are applied directly to the animal<br>
or indirectly Via vectors other than the original'virus. Nucleotide vaccines and vector<br>
vaccines are well known from the present state of the art and will not be elaborated<br>
further.<br>
in afurther aspect  the present invention relates to the use of nucleic acids of the<br>
present invention for preparing nucleotide- and/or vector-vaccines.<br>
The vaccines,  attenuated  pestiviruses,  and/or nucleic  acids  according  to  the<br>
invention are particularly useful for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
In consequence, a further aspect of the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a vaccine according to the invention, and/or a pesUvirus according to the invention, and/or a nucleotide sequence according to the invention One non-limiting example of such a pharmaceutical composition, solely given for demonstration purposes, could be prepared as follows: Cell culture supernatant of an infected cell culture is mixed with a stabilizer (e.g. spermidine and/or BSA (bovine serum albumin)) and the mixture is subsequently lyophilized or dehydrated by other<br>
methods. Prior to vaccination, said mixture is then rehydrated in aquous (e.g. saline. ,<br><br>
PBS (phosphate buffered saline)) or non aquous solutions (e.g. oil emulsion, aluminum-based adjuvant).<br>
An additional aspect of the present invention relates to a method of attenuation for pestiviruses. The invention provides a unique and unexpected method for attenuating pestiviruses characterized in that the RNase activity residing in glycoprotein ERNS is inactivated.<br><br><br>
The specifically attenuated pestiviruses are especially useful for the preparation of vaccines. Therefore, in a further additional aspect the present invention relates to methods for producing a specifically attenuated pestivirus vaccine characterized in that the Rnase activity residing in glycoprotein ERNS is inactivated.<br>
The inactivation of the RNase activity residing in glycoprotein ERN provides a surprising and new method fordetectably labeling pestiviruses. In a further aspect the present invention provides a method for detectably labeling pestiviruses characterized in that the RNase activity residing in glycoprotein ERNS is inactivated. The feature of absence of RNase activity residing in the glycoprotein ERNS of pestiviruses of the invention now enables for detectably labeling these pestiviruses. Labeled and unlabeled pestiviruses or the ERNS secreted from pestivirus infected cells in body fluids can clearly be distinguished by the absence or presence of<br>
-RNS auuvny ui uits yiyuupiuitJirus t<br>
activity.<br>
For pestiviruses inactivated in their RNase activity residing in glycoprotein ERNS by<br>
deletion  and/or mutation,  a  number of other techniques  can  be used.  Such<br>
pestiviruses can easily be detected because of the structural consequences resulting<br>
from such deletions and/or mutations. For example, the sequence difference of the<br>
nucleic acid sequence of altered glycoprotein ERNS is detectable by nucleic acid<br>
sequencing    techniques    or   PCR-techniques    (polymerase-chain    reaction)    as<br>
demonstrated in example 8; the altered protein  sequence can be detected  by<br>
specific monoclonal antibodies, that do not recognize unaltered proteins. Vice versa,<br>
it is also possible to detect the altered and thereby structurally labeled proteins by<br>
the absence of binding to specific monoclonal antibodies that recognize unaltered<br>
glycoproteins ERNS under the proviso that the presence of pestiviruses can  be<br>
.-/   s established otherwise. And, of course, the deletions and/or mutations abrogating the<br>
RNase activity in the labeled viruses will result in different immune responses in<br>

As mentioned above the inactivation of the RNase activity residing in glycoprotein ERNS provides a surprising and new method for labeling pestiviruses. As a consequence" one aspect of the present invention relates to methods for distinguishing the detectably labeled pestiviruses according to the invention from 20 unlabeled and possibly pathogenic pestiviruses. Such methods are especially useful for tracing the efficacy of labeled pestiviruses in animals. A vaccine treated animal will prove label-positive after obtaining a sample of such animal and assaying for said label. Unlabeled animals and especially unlabeled animals-that prove pestivirus positive can be immediately separated, isolated or slaughtered to remove the 25      imminent danger of spreading the pathogenic infection to other animals.<br>
The present invention provides a method for detectably labeling pestiviruses characterized in that the RNase activity residing in glycoprotein ERNS is inactivated. This feature of absence of RNase activity residing in the glycoprotein E of pestiviruses of the invention now enables for detectably labeling these pestiviruses. 30 As a result labeled and unlabeled pestiviruses can clearly be distinguished by the absence or presence of RNase activity of the glycoprotein ERNS upon isolation and assaying such enzymatic activity. The determination of presence or absence of this enzymatic activity upon obtaining a sample containing a pestivirus of interest or<br><br><br>
material thereof can be performed according to standard methods as, for example, described in Example 2 or in Hulst et al. (1994).<br>
Therefore, in a- preferred embodiment the present invention relates to a method for distinguishing pestivirus-infected animals from animals vaccinated with a specifically 5     attenuated pestivirus according to the invention, comprising the following steps:<br>
(1)	Obtaining a sample from an animal of interest suspected of pestivirus infection or a vaccinated animal;<br>
(2)	Determining   the   absence   or   presence   of   RNase   activity   of   a glycoprotein ERNS within said sample;<br>
10	(3)    Correlating the absence of RNase activity of glycoprotein ERNS with a<br>
vaccinated animal and correlating the presence of said activity with a pestivirus infection of said animal.<br>
Wjpe present invention provides pestiviruses inactivated in their RNase activity 15 residing in glycoprotein ERNS by deletion and/or mutation. Such pestiviruses are easily detected because of the structural consequences resulting from such deletions and/or mutations. The sequence difference of the ERNS gene coding for the altered glycoprotein ERNS is detectable by sequencing techniques or PCR-techniques. As a result, the present invention provides in a preferred embodiment a 20 method for distinguishing pestivirus-infected animals from animals vaccinated with a specifically attenuated pestivirus according to the invention, comprising the following steps:<br>
(1)      Obtaining a sample from an animal of interest suspected of pestivirus<br>
infection or a vaccinated animal;<br>
25	(2)      Identifying the nucleotide sequence of a pestfvirus genome or protein<br>
within said sample;	<br>
(3)      Correlating  the  deletions  and/or mutations   of the  ERNS  nucleotide<br>
sequence as present in the vaccine with  a vaccinated animal  and<br>
correlating  the  absence of said  deletions  and/or mutations  with  a<br>
30	pestivirus infection of said animal.<br>
Furthermore, the structural changes resulting from the altered protein sequence of the glycoprotein ERNS of pestiviruses of the invention can be detected by specific monoclonal  or polyclonal  antibodies,  that do  not recognize  unaltered  proteins.<br><br>
Therefore, in a further embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for distinguishing pestivirus-infected animals from animals vaccinated with an attenuated pestivtrus according to the invention, comprising the following steps:<br>
(1)	Obtaining a sample from an animal of interest suspected of pestivirus infection or a vaccinated animal;<br>
(2)	Identifying a modified ERNS glycoprotein of an attenuated pestivirus by the specific binding of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to ERNS glycoproteins present in said sample, said glycoproteins being modified by a method according to the invention, whereby said monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies do not bind to unmodified ERNS glycoproteins;<br>
(3)	Correlating the specific binding of said monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies with a vaccinated animal and correlating the absence of antibody binding to a pestivirus infection of said animal under the proviso that the presence of pestiviral material in said animal and/or said sample is established otherwise.<br>
Vice versa, it is also possible to detect the altered and thereby structurally labeled proteins by the absence of binding to specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies that recognize unaltered glycoproteins ERNS only, if the presence of pestiviruses can be established otherwise. In a preferred embodiment the present invention relates to a method for distinguishing pestivirus-infected animals from animals vaccinated with an attenuated pestivirus according to the invention, comprising the following steps;<br>
(1)	Obtaining a sample from an animal of interest suspected of pestivirus infection or a vaccinated animal;<br>
(2)	Identifying an unmodified  ERNS glycoprotein of a  pestivirus by the specific   binding   of  monoclonal' or   polyclonal   antibodies   to   E glycoproteins present in said  sample, said glycoproteins not being modified   by  a   method   according   to  the   invention,   whereby  said monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies do not bind  to modified  E glycoproteins;<br>
(3)	Correlating the specific binding of said monoclonal or polyclonal<br>
antibodies with a pestivirus infection in said animal and correlating the<br>
absence of antibody binding to an vaccinated animal under the proviso<br><br>
that the presence of pestiviral material in said animal and/or said sample is established otherwise.<br>
Of course, the structural modification and absence of the RNase activity in the<br>
    labeled viruses of the invention will result in different immune responses in animals when compared to the responses resulting from unlabeled pestivirus infections. The pestiviruses of the invention elicit a different and distinct immune response, cellular as well as humoral, that differs from unmodified and possibly pathogenic immune responses. For example, glycoproteins ERNS according to the invention will result in<br>
10 polyclonal antibodies that are different in their binding specificity when compared to polyclonal antibodies resulting from unmodified glycoproteins. This difference in binding specificity provides a label for distinguishing animals vaccinated with pestiviruses from the invention from pestivirus field infected animals. Tests for screening sera for specific polyclonal antibodies that either bind to a wildtype epitope<br>
15 or a marker deletion mutation of that epitope for the purpose of differentiating infected and vaccinated animals have been described, for example for pseudorabies-infected and vaccinated pigs (Kit et al., 1991).<br>
In   a   preferred   embodiment   the   present   invention   relates   to   a   method   for distinguishing pestivirus-infected animals from animals vaccinated with an attenuated<br>
20     pestivirus according to the invention, comprising the following steps:<br>
(1)	Obtaining a sample of polyclonal antibodies from an animal of interest suspected of pestivirus infection or a vaccinated animal;<br>
(2)	Identifying any specific binding of said polyclonal antibodies to unmodified   glycoprotein   ERNS   or   glycoprotein   ERNS   as   modified<br>
25	according to the invention.<br>
(3)	Correlating the binding of said ^polyclonal antibodies to unmodified<br>
glycoprotein ERNS with a pestivirus infection and correlating the binding<br>
of said polyclonal antibodies to glycoprotein E N   as modified according<br><br>
30<br><br>
to the invention with a vaccinated.<br>

Examples Generation of RNase-negative pestivirus mutants<br><br>
15 Starting with the full length cDNA clones pA/CSFV (Meyers et ah. 1996a\or pA/BVDV (Meyers et al., 1996b), from which infectious cRNA can be obtained by in vitro transcription, subclones were generated. For CSFV, a Xhol/Sspl fragment of pA/CSFV was cloned into pBluescript SK+, cut with Xhc! and Smal. For BVDV, a Xhol/Bglll fragment from pA/BVDV was cloned into plasmid pCITE-2C, cut with the<br>
20 same enzymes. Single stranded plasmid DNA was produced from these constructs according to the method of Kunkel (Kunkel et al., 1987) using E. coli CJ 236 cells (BioRad) and the VCMS single strand phage (Stratagene). The single stranded DNA was converted to double strands using the 'Phagemid in vitro Mutagenesis Kit' (BioRad), Some of the synthetic oligonucleotides which were used as primers for<br>
25     generating the desired pestivirus mutants are Jisted below in an exemplary fashion:<br>

The double stranded plasmid DNA was used for transformation of E.coli XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene). Bacterial colonies harboring plasmids were isolated via ampicillin selection.   Plasmid   DNA   was   prepared   and   further   analyzed   by   nucleotide sequencing   using   the   T7   polymerase   sequencing   kit   (Pharmacia).   Plasmids containing the desired mutations and no second site changes were used for the construction of full length cDNA clones. In the case of CSFV, a Xhol/Ndei fragment from the mutagenized plasmid was inserted together with a Ndel/Bglll fragment derived from  plasmid  578 (pCITE 2A,  containing the Xhol/Bglll  fragment form pA/CSFV) into pA/CSFV cut with Xhol and Bglll. To obtain the BVDV CP7 mutant, a Xhol/Bglll fragment containing the deletion was inserted into pA/BVDV cut with Xhol and Ncol together with a Bglil/Ncol fragment isolated from pA/BVDV/lns-. From construct   pA/BVDV/lns-   a   cRNA   was   transcribed    that   gives    rise   to    a rfoficytopathogenic BVDV upon transfection in suitable cells (Meyers et al., 1996b). The different full length clones were amplified, and the plasmids isolated. The presence  of   the   desired   mutations   was   proven   by   DNA   sequencing.   After linearization with Srfl (CSFV full length clones) or Smal (BVDV full length clones) cRNA was transcribed as described previously (Meyers et al 1996ab). RNA was purified by gel filtration and phenol/chloroform extraction and used for transfection of porcine kidney (PK15) cells or bovine kidney (MDBK clone B2) cells (CSFV or BVDV constructs, respectively). The transfections were analyzed by immunofluorescence with virus specific antisera. In cases where the desired mutants could be recovered (immunofluorescence positive) the viruses were amplified by passage on the same cell lines used for the transfection experiments. Further analysis of the    CSFV mutants included determination of one step growth curves and characterization of viral RNA by Northern blot with virus specific cDNA probes as well as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT:PCR) and subsequent sequencing of the PCR fragments to verify the presence of the desired  mutations in the viral genome. In all cases the presence of the desired mutation was proven. All of the recovered viruses grew equally well and produced similar amounts of RNA just as the virus resulting from the plasmid displaying the wild type sequence. The viability of the BVDV mutant was shown by transfection of the respective cRNA and splitting of the cells 3 days thereafter. Part of the cells was seeded into a 3.5 cm diameter dish, fixed with acetone/methanol at the day thereafter and analyzed by<br><br>
immunofluorescence with a mixture of BVDV-specific monoclonal antibodies (Weiland  et al., 1989). All cells were found positive whereas a control of cells transfected with noninfectious RNA showed no signal. From a part of the cells transfected with the respective cRNA, an extract was produced by one cyde of freezing and thawing. Fresh cells were infected with this cell extract and proved to be BVDV positive by BVDV specific immunofluorescence 3 days post infection. Table 1 summarizes the different changes introduced into the conserved sequences of ERNS representing the putative active site of the RN^se which are encoded by the indicated virus mutants<br>

	Example 2 Effect of different mutations on RNase activity of ERNS<br>
10<br>
To test the effect of the different mutations on the RNase activity of ERNS appropriate cellsfwere infected with the mutant viruses. For CSFV, the infection was carried out with a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.01. Infection with wild type virus served as a positive control whereas nbninfected cells were used as a negative control. At 48h<br>
15 post infection, cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered*saline and lysed in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris/HCI; 100 mM NaCi, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mg/mi bovine serum albumin; 1% Triton X100; 0.1% deoxychoiic acid: 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). The iysate was given into 1.5 ml reaction tubes, sonified (Branson sonifier B12, 120 Watt, 20 s in a cup horn water bath), cleared by centrifugation (5 min,<br>
,20 14,000 rpm, Eppendorf Centrifuge, 4°C) and the supernatant subjected to ultracentrifugation (Beckmann table top ultracentifuge, 60 min at 4°C and 45,000 rpm in a TLA 45 rotor). Determination of RNase activity was done in a total volume of 200 p\ containing 5 or 50 μl of supernatant of the second centrifugation step and 80 μl of Poly(rU)(Pharmacia) in RNase-assay buffer (40mM Tris-acetate (pH 6.5), 0.5 mM<br>
25 EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)). After incubation of the reaction mixture at 37°C for 1 hour 200 μl of 1.2 M perchloric acid, 20 mM LaS04 was added. After 15 min incubation on ice the mixture was centrifugated for 15 min at 4°C and 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge. To the supernatant 3 volumes of water were added and an aliquot of the mixture was analyzed by measuring the optical density at 260 nm using<br>
30 an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Pharmacia). In all cases, the mutations introduced into the Ems gene completely abrogated RNase activity (Table 1).<br><br><br>
For the BVDV mutant RNase activity was tested with material obtained after RNA transfection without passage of the recovered viruses. Ceils transfected with the appropriate RNA were split 72h post transfection and seeded in two dishes. 24h later, from one dish, cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for RNase activity as 5 described above. To prove infection, the cells of the second dish were analyzed by immunofluorescence with BVDV specific monoclonal antibodies (Weiland et al., 1989) and found 100% positive. Transfection was carried out with RNA transcribed from pA/BVDV/lns- and from pA/B-346-d, the plasmid equivalent to pA/BVDV/lns-but containing the deletion of the codon equivalent to the codon 346 in the CSFV 10     Alfort genome. Nontransfected MDBK cells served as a negative' control.<br>

PK15 cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an m.o.i. (multiplicity of infection) of 0.01, incubated at 37°C for 48 h in a CG2 incubator, and then lysed and subjected to RNase test. The acid soluble RNA resulting from incubation with the different cell extracts was quantified by measuring the optical density at 260 nm. The<br>
20    . observed differences in RNase activity were not due to different amounts of E protein in the samples since similar values were obtained after quantification of E by radioactive labeling,  immunoprecipitation and analysis of "radioactivity with a phosphorimager. Moreover, reduction of the Ems concentration in the assay down to only one tenth of the  usual  amount did not change  the  resulting  OD values<br>
25     considerably, indicating that with the chosen conditions the assay was saturated with<br>

Example 3   Pathogenicity of CSFV after RNase inactivation<br>
To test, whether the destruction of the RNase activity influences the pathogenicity of 10     pestiviruses in their natural host, animal experiments were conducted with mutant V(pA/C-346-d) (C346-d in. tables). Virus recovered from the CSFV full length clone without mutation (V(pA/CSFV)) served as a positive control (G-WT in,tables). For each mutant three piglets (breed: German landrace; about 25kg body weight) were us^d. The infection dose was 1x105 TCID50 per animal; two thirds of the inoculate 15     was administered intranasally (one third in each nostril), one third intramuscularly. The two groups were housed in separate isolation units. Blood was taken from the animals two times before  infection and on days 3, 5, 7, 10, 12 and 14. In addition, temperature was recorded daily (Figure 2). The animals infected with the wild type virus showed typical symptoms of classical swine fever like fever, ataxia, anorexia. 20     diarrhea, central nervous disorders, hemorrhages in the skin (Table 3a). Virus could be recovered form the blood on days 3 (animal #68) and on days 5, 7, 10,  14 (animals #68, #78, #121) (Table 3b) The animals were killed in a moribund stage at day 14 post infection. At this time, no virus neutralizing antibodies could be detected. In contrast, the animals infected with the mutant did not develop clinical symptoms 25      (Table 3a). The temperature stayed normal (Figure 2) over the whole experimental period and the animals never stopped taking up food. At no time virus could be recovered from the blood. Nevertheless, the-animals were clearly infected and the virus most likely replicated since all animals developed neutralizing antibodies (Table 3c). 30<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Antibody titers of pigs infected with virus mutant C-346-d determined at different time 5     points during the animal experiment:<br>
50 μl of the diluted serum were mixed with 50 μl of medium containing 30 TCID50 of<br>
virus (CSFV Alfort/Tubingen). After 90 minutes incubation at 37°C, 100 μl of cells<br>
(1.5x104 cells) were added and the mixture was seeded in 96 well plates. After 72 h<br>
the cells were fixed with ice cold acetone/methanol and analyzed for infection by<br>
10 infmunofluorescence with a monoclonal antibody specific for glycoprotein E2 (mAb<br>
A18, Weiland et al. 1990). On day 69 post infection the animals were challenged<br>
with 2x105 TCID50 of CSFV strain Eystrup. The table gives the highest serum dilution<br>
resulting in complete neutralization of input virus.	<br>
15      Example 4   Induction of protective immunity by infection with RNase negative virus<br>
To analyze whether the infection with the mutant virus had led to a protective immunity, a challenge experiment was conducted about 9 weeks after the infection<br>
20 with the CSFV mutant using a highly pathogenic heterologous CSFV strain (strain Eystrup, originated from Behring). 2x105 TCID50 of virus was used for the infection. This amount of virus was found to be sufficient to induce lethal disease in several preceeding experiments (Konig, 1994). However, the animals previously infected with the CSFV RNase mutant did not show symptoms of disease after challenge<br>
25 infection. Neither fever (Figure 3) nor viremia could be detected but an increase in neutralizing antibodies indicated productive infection and replication of the challenge virus.<br><br><br><br>
Example 5   Confirmation of attenuation principle<br>
To show, that the observed attenuation of the mutant virus is indeed due to the deletion of the histidine at position 346 of the polyprotein and not a consequence of 5     an unidentified second site mutation,  the wild type sequence was restored by exchange of a 1.6 kb Xhol/Ndel fragment of the full length clone pA/C-346-d against the corresponding fragment of pA/CSFV displaying the wild type sequence. The fragment excised from pA/C-346-d was analyzed by nucleotide sequencing for mutations. Except for the deletion of the triplet coding for histidine 346 of the 10     polyprotein, no difference with regard to the wild type sequence was found. From the cDNA construct with the rescued mutant* virus V(pA/C-346-d/Rs) could be'recovered that grew equally well as wild type virus and showed equivalent RNase activity (Table 2A).<br>
second animal experiment, the rescued virus was used for infection of pigs. As a<br>
15     control, the deletion mutant was used. Again, two groups consisting of three animals<br>
were used. As the animals were younger (German landrace, about 20kg) than those<br>
in the first experiment, SxlO4TCIDso of virus were used for infection this time. Again,<br>
the animals infected with the mutant showed no clinical signs* (Table 5, Figure 4).<br>
Only one animal had fever for one day. Nevertheless, these animals developed<br>
20     neutralizing   antibodies  and   were   protected   against  a Jethal   CSFV  challenge.<br>
Challenge was again performed by infection with 2x105 TCID50 of challenge strain<br>
Eystrup. The animals did not show clinical signs after challenge and the temperature<br>
stayed normal (Figure 5). In contrast to the pigs infected with the deletion mutant, the<br>
animals inoculated with the rescued wild type virus developed fatal classical swine<br>
25      fever. One animal had to be killed 11 days after infection, the other two 3 days later.<br>
All animals showed typical symptoms of classical swine fever, i.e. fever, diarrhea,<br>
annorexia, and pathological signs like hemorrhages in different organs including the<br>
kidney.<br>

Example 6   Effects of double mutation within ERNS<br>
To test the effects of a double mutation within ER*S on the ability of the respective virus to replicate in its natural host and on pathogenicity, an animal experiment was 25     conducted with mutant V(pA/C-297-L/346-L). Virus recovered from the CSFV full<br><br>
length clone without mutation (V(pA/CSFV) served as a positive control. For each ntutant three piglets (breed: German land race; about 25 kg body weight) were used The infection dose was 1x105 TCID50 per animal; two thirds of the inoculate was administered intra-nasally (one third in each nostril), one third intramuscularly. Blood 5     was taken from the animals before infection (day 0) and on days 5, 8.12 and 20. In addition, temperature was recorded daily (Fig. 6). The animals infected with the double mutant did not develop any clinical symptoms, and the animals never stopped taking up food. The animals showed no fever over the whole experimental period (animals 45/2 and 45/3) except animal 45/1 on day 8, probably due to<br>
10     bacterial infection caused by injury of the right hind leg. After treatment of this animal with an antibiotic on day 10, temperature returned to normal values within one day (Fig. 6). For all animals virus was recovered from the blood on day 5 whereas no viremia was detected at later time points (Table 6a). All animals developed ifielutralizing antibodies (Table 6b). For animal 45/1 the neutralization titer was again<br>
15     determined about 4.5 months p.i. and was found tobe 1:4374. Thus, the infection with the double mutant resulted in long lasting immunological memory.<br>

Example 7   Immunogenicity and attenuation principle of the BVDV virus "B-346-d"<br>
This experiment was designed to investigate the attenuation principle as well as the immunogenicity of the BVDV virus ,B-346-d' recovered from pA/B-346-d by comparing it with the ,B-WT' virus recovered from pA/BVDV/lns-. The virus ,B-346-d' is of course mutated in original BVDV position 349 but named "B-346" to indicate the position relative to the CSFV Alfort position 346 of figure 1. Three groups of BVDV seronegative animals of 3-6 months of age were selected. Groups 1 and 2 comprised 5 animals each while group 3 comprised 3 animals, Animals of group 1 and 2 were infected by administration of 2x10 TCID50 of B-346-d (group 1) or B-WT (group 2) in a volume of 5 ml per route. Animals were infected intra-muscularly (gluteal muscle), intranasally and subcutaneously (over scapula). Over a period of 14 days after infection, viremia in both groups was monitored through parameters like blood cell viremia and virus shedding in nasal swabs. In addition, clinical parameters like rectal temperatures, white blood cell counts and general health parameters were monitored.<br>
The protective immunity against an infection with an antigeneticaliy heterologous and virulent BVDV-isolate (#13) was investigated by challenge infection 77 days after infection of the animals of group 1 with B-346-d. Animals of group 3 served as challenge control and were infected according to the procedure for the animals of group 1 with the virulent BVDV-isolate. The BVDV virus (#13) belongs to a different antigenetic group (type II), whereas the B-346-d virus belongs to the antigenetic group (type I) according to the classification described by (Pellerin, C. et. a!.,  1994). Animals of group 1 and 3 got infected by administration of 2x106 TCID50 of BVDV isolate (#13) in a volume of 5 ml per route. Animals were infected via the intra-muscular (gluteal muscle), intra-nasal and subcutaneous route (over Scapula). Over a period of 14 days after infection viremia in both groups-was monitored by parameters like blood cell viremia and virus shedding in nasal swabs. In addition, clinical parameters like rectal temperatures, white blood cell counts and general health parameters were monitored.<br>
After infection with B-346-d animals did not show any typical clinical symptoms of a BVDV infection such as rectal temperature increase (Table 7a), or any respiratory clinical symptomes (not shown).<br><br>
10<br>
15<br><br>
The reduced blood cell viremia(Table 7b) and virus shedding in nasal swabs (Table 7c) did clearly indicate an attenuation of B-346-d compared to B-WT. The virulent BVDV isolate #f 3 didinduce in the animals of group 3 astrong viremia with typical signs of a BVDV infection, like rectal temperature increase over a period of several days (Table 7d), strong leucopenia (Table 7e). extended blood cell viremia (Table 7f) and virus shedding in nasal swab fluid (Table 7g). In contrast, animals of group 1, which had been vaccinated by infection with B-346-d, did show almost no e&amp;mcat symptoms typicalfora BVDV infection after the challenge infection with the virulent BVDV isolate #13. There'was no significant increase in rectal temperatures after infection (Table 7d). The observed leucopenia was very marginal with regard to magnitude and duration (Table 7e). No BVDV could be isolated from the blood -(Table 7f) and for only one Animal virus shedding in nasal swab exudate could be detected (Table 7g).<br>
Therefore, infection with B-346-d induces a strong immunity which clearly reduces clinical signs, virus shedding and blood ceil viremia after challenge infection with a heterologous BVDV isolate.<br><br><br><br>

EDTA blood was sampled daily up to day 10 post infection with B-346-d and B-WT, respectively. 0.2 ml of blood were added to each of 3 cultures of calf testis (Cte) cells with medium containing heparin (1 unit/ml to prevent clotting). After overnight incubation inoculum/medium was replaced with fresh medium without heparin. After incubation for 4 to 6 days, BVDV infected celis were detected by immunefluorescence with a polyclonal serum specific for BVDV.

Example 8   Discrimination between C-346-d and CSFV without deletion of the<br>
15	histidine codon 346 by RT-PCR<br>
The RNA sequence coding for the conserved RNase motif in CSFV glycoprotein E is highly conserved. Among all known CSFV sequences no nucleotide exchanges were found in the region corresponding to residues 1387 to 1416 of the<br>
20 published sequence of the CSFV Alfort strain (Meyers et a!, 1987). Thus. oligonucleotide primers derived from this conserved region of the genome can be used in an RT-PCR assay for detection of all CSFV isolates (see figure 7). In consequence, the absence of the triplet coding for histidine 346 (nucleotides 1399-1401) could be detected by an RT-PCR assay with an appropriately designed primer.<br>
25      Different oligonucleotides covering the conserved region were synthesized that either<br><br>
contained the histidine codon or not. These oligonucleotides served as upstream primers in RT-PCR reactions with oligonucleotide ERNS-Stop as downstream primer. RNA purified from tissue culture cells infected with C-346-d. C-WT, 0346-L or C-346-K, respectively, were used as templates. Reverse transcription of 2 pg heat 5     denatured RNA (2 min 92°C. 5 min on ice in11.5 μl of water in the presence of 30 pMol reverse primer) was done after addition of 8 μl RT mix (125 mM Tris/HCI pH 8.3, 182.5 mM KCI. 7.5 mM MgCi2. 25 mM dithiothreitol. 1.25 mM of each dATP, dTTP, dCTP, dGTP), 15 U of RNAouard (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) and 50 U of Superscript (Life Technoloojes/BRL, Eggenstein, Germany) for 45 min at 37°C. After 10     finishing reverse transcription, the tubes were placed on ice and 30 pi of PCR mix (8.3 - mM Tris/HCI. pH8.3; 33.3 mM KCI; 2.2 mM MgCI2; 0.42 mM of each dATP, dTTP,.. dCTP, dGTP;  0.17%  TritonX100;  0.03%   bovine  serum  albumine;   5  U  of Taq polymerase (Appiigene, Heidelberg, Germahy) and 16.7% DMSO) were added. When printerOl H+3 was used, the reaction mix for amplification contained no DMSO. 15     Amplification was earned out in 36 cycles (30 sec 94°C; 30 sec 57°C; 45 sec 74°C). 1 pi of amplification reaction was loaded on a 1% agarose gel, the amplified products were   separated   by   electrophoresis,   and   stained   with   ethidium   bromide.   As demonstrated in Fig. 7, primer pair Ol H-3/OI EmsStop allowed to specifically amplify a band derived from RNA containing the deletion of codon 346 whereas with the other 20     two primer combinations products containing codon 346 were amplified and ho band was observed when the RNA with the deletion of this codon was used as a template.<br>

Figure 7:      Discrimination between C-346-d and CSFV without deletion of the histidine codon 346 by RT-PCR according to example 8 15<br>
a) Primer pair Ol H-3/OI EmsStop allows to specifically amplify a band derived from RNA containing the deletion of codon 346 (C-346-d) as described in detail in example 8. In contrast, RNA, not containing said deletion^does not interact with said primer pair (C-WT, C-346-L, C-346-K). 20 b) And c) The other two primer combinations (Ol H+2 and Ol H+3) amplify bands derived from RNA that do not contain the deletion of codon 346 (Ol H+2 and Ol H+3). No band can be observed when RNA from the 346-deletion mutant C-346-d is used as a template.<br>
