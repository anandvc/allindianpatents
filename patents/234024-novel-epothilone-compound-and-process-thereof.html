COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule. 13]<br>
"NOVEL EPOTHILONE COMPOUND AND PROCESS THEREOF"<br>
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation of Lawrenceville-Princeton Rd., P.O. Box 4000, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
The present -invention relates to a compound represented by the formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 to R5 have the meanings given herein below.<br>
Epothilones are macrolide compounds that find utility in the pharmaceutical field. For example, epothilones A and B having the structures:<br><br>
epothilone A      R=H epothilone B       R=Me<br>
may be found to exert microtubule-stabilizing effects similar to paclitaxel (TAXOL®) and hence cytotoxic activity against rapidly proliferating cells, such as, tumor cells or other hyperproliferatjve cellular disease, see Hofle, G., et al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.   . Engl., Vol. 35, No. 13/14, 1567-1569 (1996); WO93/10121 published May 27, 1993; and W097/19086 published May 29, 1997.<br>
Derivatives and analogs of epothilones A and B have been synthesized and may be used to treat a variety of cancers and other abnormal proliferative diseases. Such analogs are disclosed in Hofle et al., Id.; Nicolaou, K.C., et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.. Vol. 36, No. 19, 2097-2103 (1997); and Su, D.S., et al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.. Vol. 36, No. 19, 2093-2097 (1997).<br>
Analogs of the epothilones that have been found to have advantageous activity are represented by the following structure<br><br><br>
wherein Q, and R1 through R6 have the meanings given herein below.<br>
An improved synthesis for these analogs involving novel intermediates is provided in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br>
The present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of compounds represented by formulas I and II wherein Q, Z, and R1 through R6 are as defined below.<br><br>
The compounds represented by formula I are novel intermediates for the preparation of epothilone analogs that are useful in the treatment of a variety of cancers and other abnormal proliferative diseases. Compounds represented by formula I may be utilized to prepare epothilone analogs represented by formula II which are useful as anticancer agents.<br>
The process of the present invention provides an advantageous synthesis for the compounds represented by formula II including the preparation of novel ring opened epothilone intermediate compounds represented by formula I.<br><br><br>
As used in formulas I and II, and throughout the specification, the meaning of<br>
i ■ the symbol Q is: <br>
M is selected from the group consisting of oxygen, sulfur, NR8, and CR9R10; Z is selected from the group consisting of<br><br>
R1 -R5, R7, and R11 - R15 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl and heterocyclo, and wherein R and R are alkyl, they can be joined to form a cycloalkyl;<br>
R6is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclo and substituted heterocyclo;<br>
R8 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, RnC=0, Rl2OC=0 and R,3S02;<br>
R9andR10 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, heterocyclo, hydroxy, R14C=0, and R15OC=0; and<br>
R16,R17,andR18 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl, and aralkyl.<br>
The process of the present invention is advantageous in that only two steps are required to prepare the epothilone analogs from the epothilone starting material, for example, epothilone B. Two further distinct advantages of the process of the present<br><br>
invention are that the yields of crystallized compounds represented by formula II are significantly higher than those previously realized utilizing the free acid of the compound represented by'formula I as the intermediate compound, and the fact that the preparation of the intermediate is amendable to being carried out in one step. A further advantage of this process is that it can progress from the epothilone starting material to the epothilone represented by formula II without the need to isolate and purify an intermediate. Those skilled in the art will immediately recognize the economic benefits of such a process.<br>

The novel open-ring intermediates represented by formula I can be prepared from an epothilone starting material represented by formula III in Scheme 1 wherein Q, Z, and R1 through R6 are as defined above. The epothilone starting materials represented by formula III are known compounds, see, for example, Hofle, G., et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., Vol. 35, No.13/14,1567-1569 (1996); WO93/10121 published May 27,1993; and WO97/19086 published May 29, 1997; Nicolaou, K.C., et al. Angew Chem. Int. Ed.
