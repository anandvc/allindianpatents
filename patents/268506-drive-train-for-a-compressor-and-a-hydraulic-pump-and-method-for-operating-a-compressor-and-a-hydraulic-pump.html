Drive train for a compressor and a hydraulic pump<br>
The invention reflates to a drive train for a compressor<br>
and a hydraulic pump of a motor vehicle which has a<br>
hydraulic power steering system and an electric<br>
superimposed steering system for providing steering<br>
assistance;, wherein the compressor and the hydraulic<br>
pump are driven By means of a common output shaft of a<br>
motor vehicle drive motor.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for operating a<br>
compressor and a hydraulic pump of a motor vehicle<br>
which has a hydraulic power steering system and an<br>
electric superimposed steering system for providing<br>
steering assistance, wherein the compressor and the<br>
hydraulic pump are driven by means of a common output<br>
shaft of a motor vehicle drive engine..<br>
In modern 'motor vehicles, in particular in the field of<br>
utility vehicles, systems which are operated with<br>
compressed air are used in many cases. For example, the<br>
brakes, the pneumatic suspension, the transmission etc.<br>
use compressed air as a working medium. In the design<br>
and manufacture of such systems it is necessary to keep<br>
the power demand for providing compressed air as low as<br>
possible while ensuring continuous operational<br>
reliability of thie systems. Nowadays it is customary to<br>
allow the compressor used for providing compressed air<br>
to continue to be driven by the engine of the motor<br>
vehicle in phases in which it is not feeding any<br>
compressed air. The air which is fed at such a time is<br>
however not utilized to provide compressed air! but<br>
rather fed into the surrounding air. This typically<br>
causes a power loss of approximately 1 kW.<br>
A further system which is also usually driven by a<br>
motor vehicle engine is the hydraulic power steering<br>
system. This reduces the steering forces which have to<br><br>
WO 2006/099920	PCT/EP2006/001353<br>
- 2 -<br>
be applied by the driver in the stationary state when<br>
maneuvering the vehicle or at low travel speeds of the<br>
vehicle. The power demand of such a steering system,<br>
also referred to as a power j steering system, is<br>
approximately 1 kW in the idling state and up to 8 k.W<br>
in the case of a high demand, for example during<br>
maneuver-ing. In most systems of this type, the<br>
hydraulic pump Of the steering assistance system is<br>
driven by means of a through-drive at the compressor.<br>
In order: to provide the driver with further<br>
functionalities in addition to the pure steering<br>
assistance, what is referred to as a superimposed<br>
steering system has been developed. In this system an<br>
additional torque is superimposed on the driver's<br>
manual torque, for example by means of an electric<br>
motor and a planetary gear mechanism at the steering<br>
column. With thi|s superimposed steering system it is<br>
possible to carry out steering corrections in order to<br>
stabilize the vehicle as a function of the<br>
instantaneous driving state of the vehicle, for example<br>
using signals of an electronic stability program (ESP).<br>
It is also possible to implement functions such jas a<br>
variable transmission ratio as a function of the speed<br>
of the vehicle or the steering speed as well as a<br>
variable power assistance which imposes the<br>
superimposed torque as a function of the torque to be<br>
applied by the driver.<br>
The invention is based on the object of developing a<br>
drive train of the generic type in such a way that the<br>
compressor and the hydraulic pump can operate in a way<br>
which is efficient in terms of energy.<br>
This object is achieved by means of the features<br>
specified in the independent claims.<br>
Further developments and embodiments result from the<br>
dependent claims.<br><br>
WO 2006/099920	PCT/EP2006/001353<br>
- 3 -<br>
The drive train according to the invention i s based on<br>
the generic prior art in that means are; provided which<br>
reduce the power which is output to the compressor and<br>
the hydraulic pump via the output shaft if the demands<br>
which are being made ' of the cpmpressor and of the<br>
steering assistance system permit it. This makes it<br>
possible for the power to be output to the compressor<br>
and hydraulic pump in a way which is largely suitable<br>
for the. demand, thus avoiding unnecessary consumption<br>
of energy, in this context it is possible, for example<br>
depending on the demand profile of the compressor and<br>
hydraulic pump, for the power which is to: be<br>
transmitted to be controllable in a plurality of<br>
stages, for example by means of a transmission or the<br>
like.. It is also possible, if appropriate, in this<br>
context for a power reduction on the part of the drive<br>
shaft to be compensated by an increased power output by<br>
the superimposed steering system.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment there is<br>
prov.i sion that the means reduce the power which is<br>
output to the compressor and to the hydraulic pump via<br>
the output shaft to zero if it is not necessary for the<br>
compressor to operate and the electric superimposed<br>
steering system can provide the necessary steering<br>
assistance alone. In particular at a sufficiently high<br>
traveling speed there is generally no need for steering<br>
assistance, or only a relatively low level of steering<br>
assistance is required. This can be applied solely by<br>
the superimposed steering system. If in addition the<br>
compressor does njot have to feed, the power flux to the<br>
compressor and hydraulic pump via the output shaft can<br>
be interrupted.<br>
In particular in the context explained above there is<br>
preferably also provision that the means comprise a<br>
clutch by means of which the power flux to the<br><br>
WO 2006/099920	PCT/EP2006/001353<br>
- 4 -<br>
compressor and i to the hydraulic pump can be<br>
interrupted. Such a deactivation clutch constitutes a<br>
cost effective and robust embodiment for disconnecting<br>
the compressor and hydraulic pump from the drive engine<br>
during suitable operating states. The deactivation<br>
clutch can be activated, for example, in idling feed<br>
phases in which the compressor would feed into the<br>
surrounding air according to the prior art.<br>
It can also be advantageous that the means comprise an<br>
electric control device which determines, on the basis<br>
of parameter values fed to it, how far the power which<br>
is output to the compressor and to the hydraulic pump<br>
via the output shaft can be reduced. In this context,<br>
the power flux can be controlled by means of specific<br>
measurement variables and/or actuation variables which<br>
characterize the instantaneous and/or anticipated power<br>
demand of the compressor and hydraulic pump. It is also<br>
possible to take into account further operating<br>
conditions of the vehicle such as, for example, the<br>
instantaneous driving behavior of the vehicle and<br>
parameters for thje hydraulics, pneumatics or electrics.<br>
In this context the term control, also includes control,<br>
processes.<br>
In particular it may be advantageous for a hydraulic<br>
accumulator to tie provided which is kept filled in<br>
order to be able to make available sufficient steering<br>
assistance when demands are suddenly made of the<br>
hydraulic power steering system. For example, if the<br>
hydraulic pump receives a reduced level of power, or no<br>
power, from the drive shaft, it may be necessary to<br>
interrupt the power steering assistance by the<br>
hydraulics in order to keep the power steering system<br>
operationally available for an emergency. In this<br>
context: it may be advantageous to provide a<br>
particularly large hydraulic accumulator in order to<br><br>

!	i ■<br>
cover the time period up to the resumption of operation<br>
by the hydraulic pump.<br>
The method according to the invention is based on the<br>
prior art of the generic type in that the power which<br>
is output to the compressor and the hydraulic pump via<br>
the output shaft is reduced if the demands which are<br>
being made of the compressor and the steering<br>
assistance system permit it.<br>
In this way, the advantages of the invention are also<br>
implemented within the scope of a method. This applies<br>
appropriately also to the developments of- the method<br>
according to subclaims 7 and 8.<br>
The invention is based on the idea that if a vehicle is<br>
traveling at a relatively high speed, for example on a<br>
freeway, only a small degree of power steering<br>
assistance is necessary. This can be provided, for<br>
example, solely by the superimposed steering system. It<br>
is thus possible to implement a deactivation clutch for<br>
the compressor, and thus also for the steering<br>
assistance pump. The deactivation clutch has to be<br>
controlled in an intelligent fashion. It is activated<br>
if the following conditions are met:<br>
The compressor does not have to feed.<br>
The demimd made of the power steering<br>
assistance system by the steering is low, which<br>
is determined for example by the pressure in<br>
the hydraulic system and by the speed of the<br>
vehicle.<br>
The power steering assistance is deactivated by<br>
the hydraulics by means of a suitable<br>
deactivation device in order to keep the<br>
hydraulic accumulator filled for an emergency.<br>
In addition it is proposed to enlarge the hydraulic<br>
accumulator in order to be, able to reliably cover the<br>
time period for switching on the clutch.<br><br>

The invention will now be explained by way of example<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings and by<br>
means of preferred embodiments.<br>
In said drawings:<br>
figure 1 is a block diagram of an embodiment of the<br>
drive train according to the invention, and<br>
figure 2 is a flowchart explaining an embodiment of<br>
the method according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of an embodiment of the<br>
drive train according to the invention. The block<br>
diagram represents here in a schematic fashion<br>
components of a steering assistance system which<br>
comprises a hydraulic power steering system 14 and an<br>
electric superimposed steering system 36. Furthermore,<br>
a compressed air compressor 12 is shown as part of a<br>
compressed air system (not shown) and an internal<br>
combustion engine 16 of a motor vehicle. The<br>
illustration is Restricted here to the components which<br>
are necessary to describe the invention. The internal<br>
combustion engine 16 is connected to the compressed air<br>
compressor 12 and the hydraulic pump 24 via an output<br>
shaft 30. The output shaft 30 is provided with a<br>
deactivation clutch 20 between the internal combustion<br>
engine 16 and compressor 12. The hydraulic pump 24 is<br>
coupled to a through-drive of the compressor 12 and is<br>
part of a hydraulic power steering system 14. The power<br>
steering system 14 also comprises hydraulic components<br>
32 which include/ inter alia, a hydraulic accumulator<br>
28 and a deactivation device 22 as well as a hydraulic<br>
actuator 34. Furthermore, the steering assistance<br>
system comprises a superimposed steering system 36. The<br>
latter comprises, inter alia, an electric motor 18<br>
which is connected to the steering column 38 via a<br>
planetary gear mechanism 26. The steering column 38 is<br><br>
WO 2006/099920	i PCT/EP2006/001353<br>
— 7 —<br>
connected to a steering wheel 40 and a steering gear 4 2<br>
which is in turn connected to the wheels 46 via a rod<br>
and lever arrangement. Furthermore, a control. 10 is<br>
provided. The latter is connected via control 1 incs 50,<br>
52 to the deactivation clutch 20 and the deactivation<br>
device 22. in addition, there ate signal lines 54-58<br>
between the control 10 and the compressor 12, the<br>
hydraulic pump 24 and the electric motor 18.<br>
First, the functionality of the power steering system<br>
14 will be briefly explained. The hydraulic pump 24<br>
generates the pressure which is required in the<br>
hydraulic systeml A power steering assistance for the<br>
steering system can be disabled by means of the<br>
deactivation device 22 and thus the pressure in the<br>
hydraulic system can be kept constant if the hydraulic<br>
pump 24 is stationary. The hydraulic components 32 make<br>
available the parts, such as valves, controllers etc.,<br>
which are necessary for the functionality of the<br>
hydraulic system. The hydraulic accumulator 28 is<br>
dimensioned in such a way that it covers the time<br>
period required for the hydraulic pump 24 to start up<br>
in order to make available sufficient pressure to the<br>
hydraulic system when a sudden high demand for power<br>
occurs.	:<br>
The overall operation of the arrangement is configured<br>
as follows:<br>
The internal comb|ustion engine 16 drives the compressor<br>
12 and the hydrlaulic pump 24 when the deactivation<br>
clutch 20 is closed. The control 10 determines the<br>
instantaneous state of the system via, inter alia, the<br>
signal lines 54-58 and, if appropriate, via other<br>
information lines (not illustrated here) and via: the<br>
control lines 50, 52. If the control 10 determines that<br>
the compressor 12 does not need to feed any compressed<br>
air at a particular time, it checks the instantaneous<br>
demand profile to the power steering system 14. if it<br><br>
WO 2006/099920	PCT/EP2006/001353<br>
- 8 -<br>
becomes apparent from this that it can be anticipated<br>
that the torque which is requested by the system is so<br>
low that it can be provided solely by the superimposed<br>
steering system 36, the control 10 closes the<br>
deactivation device 22 via the signal line 52 and thus<br>
disables the provision of power steering assistance by<br>
the hydraulic system. The contriol 10 then opens the<br>
deactivation clutch 20 by means of the control line 50<br>
and thus interrupts the power flux from the internal<br>
combustion engine 16 to the compressor 12 and to the<br>
hydraulic pump 24. In this operating state, the<br>
compressor 12 and the hydraulic pump 24 consume<br>
essentially no power of the internal combustion engine<br>
16. Any steering assistance is then made available by<br>
the electric superimposed steering system 36. If either<br>
a raised torque, which cannot be provided by the<br>
electric motor 18 is demanded or the compressor 12 has<br>
to feed, the control 10 closes the deactivation clutch<br>
20 via the control line 50 ahd thus supplies the<br>
compressor 12 and the hydraulic pump 2 4 with power<br>
again.. In addition, the control 10 activates the<br>
hydraulic power steering system via the control line 52<br>
and the deactivation device 22.<br>
Figure 2 shows a flowchart explaining an embodiment of<br>
the method according to the invention. The method<br>
starts with step S1. In step S2, the instantaneous<br>
demand profile which is required of the compressor is<br>
checked. If it is determined in this context that the<br>
compressor has to feed, it is checked with step S3<br>
whether the clutqh which connects the compressor to the<br>
drive is opened. If said clutch is opened, it i.s closed<br>
with step S4 and the system returns to the starting<br>
point of the method. If a clutch is already closed in<br>
step S3, the method is also started again. If, on the<br>
other hand, it is determined in step S2 that the<br>
compressor can be deactivated, the demand profile which<br>
is being required of the hydraulic power steering<br><br><br>
WO 2006/099920	PCT/EP2006/001353<br>
- 9 -<br>
system is checked in step S5. Tf said demand profile<br>
does not permit the system to be switched off, i t is<br>
checked with step S6 whether the hydraulic power<br>
steering assistance system is disab1ed at that<br>
particular time. If this is the case, the hydraulic<br>
assistance system is activated in step S7 and the<br>
method is continued with step S3. If the hydraulic<br>
assistance system is already active, the process is<br>
continued immediately with step S3. If there is a power<br>
steering profile which permits the system to be<br>
deactivated, the method is continued in step S8. In<br>
said step it is checked once more, as in step S6,<br>
whether the power steering assistance system is<br>
disabled. If this is not the case, this disabling<br>
process is carried out in step . S9. The method then<br>
continues with step S10. It is checked in said step<br>
whether the deactivation clutch 'is in the open state.<br>
In the event of a negative test result, the clutch is<br>
opened in step Sll. The method then continues with an<br>
opened clutch at the starting point S1.<br>
The features of the invention which are disclosed in<br>
the present description, In the| drawings and in the<br>
claims can be essential for the ' implementation of the<br>
invention either individually or in any desired<br>
combination.<br><br>

hydraulic pump (24) via the output shaft (30) can be<br>
reduced is determined on the basis of suitable<br>
parameter values.<br><br>
The invention relates to a drive train (30) for a compressor (12) and a hydraulic<br>
pump (24) of a motor vehicle that, for assisting steering, has a hydraulic power<br>
steering (14) and an electric superimposed steering system (36). The<br>
compressor (12)and the hydraulic pump (24) are driven by a common output<br>
shaft (30) of a motor vehicle driving motor (16). According to the invention,<br>
means (10,20) are provided that reduce the power delivered via the output shaft<br>
(30) to the compressor (12) and the hydraulic pump (24) when the demands<br>
upon the compressor (12) and upon the power steering system (36) allow this to<br>
occur. The invention also relates to a method for driving a compressor and a<br>
hydraulic pump of a motor vehicle that, for assisting steering, has a hydraulic<br>
power steering as well as an electric superimposed steering system.<br></td>
