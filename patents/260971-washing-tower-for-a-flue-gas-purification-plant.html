				<td>Washing Tower<br>
The present invention relates to a washing tower for a flue gas purification plant comprising a flue gas inlet, a flue gas outlet as well as a reaction zone for the reaction of a flue gas flowing through said reaction zone with a sea water-based agent. The invention also relates to a method for operating a washing tower.<br>
When using fossil fuels, especially in the field of energy production, exhaust gases, which frequently contain toxic materials, particularly flue gases, are pro¬duced. In addition to dusts, which are harmful and hence undesired, there are produced for instance sulfur oxides, nitric oxides and the like, of which the emission to the outer atmosphere is limited by law for reasons of health and environment protection. For this reason the flue gases, which are produced during the combustion of fossil fuels, are subject to purification before the gas is discharged as an exhaust gas to the atmosphere. For this purpose, prior art em¬ploys washing towers of the above-mentioned kind, by which a major part of the harmful substances like nitric oxides and sulfur oxides, toxic dusts and the like can be filtered out. Such flue gas purification plants are employed especially in power plants, chemical plants and the like.<br>
A substantial part of the flue gas purification plant is constituted by a washing tower having the flue gas introduced in a lower part thereof. The flue gas flows vertically upwardly through the washing tower against a force of gravity and leaves the washing tower through an outlet opening in an upper part thereof. Between said openings a reaction zone is provided in the washing tower, in which reaction zone a usually liquid agent is injected to it by means of corresponding nozzle arrangements which liquid agent reacts with the exhaust gas. During this reaction, toxic substances become dissolved or neutralized and<br><br>
in many cases are carried along with the agent. In washing towers of the kind as described, the agent falls in a sump against the vertical direction of flow of the flue gas which sump is provided below the flue gas inlet opening. From there the agent is partly reused and partly removed for disposal. Fresh agent is added corresponding to the part of the agent intended for disposal. In addition to a vertical flow of the flue gas through the washing tower, purification plants are known in the meantime in which the flue gas is guided through the purification system substantially in a horizontal direction. But the essential functions in these systems are provided in the same way as described above.<br>
In the above-described purification process the agent preferably contains sub¬stances like calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, calcium hy¬drogen carbonate, mixtures thereof or the like. These react especially with the acidic components which have entered from the exhaust gas in the dissolved agent for neutralizing them.<br>
Moreover, washing towers and methods are known in which primarily sea water or exclusively sea water is used as an agent. As it is known, sea water already contains significant parts of alkaline or alkaline earth substances like hydrogen carbonate and the like. Accordingly, sea water is suitable already per se as an agent for use in the flue gas purification. If sea water is used as an agent, it will be necessary to remove exhausted sea water from the sump of the tower and to replace it by fresh sea water. However, before the exhausted sea water can be discharged again, it must be treated in a separate neutralizing basin in such a way that it can be discharged without concern. In addition to the treatment by chemicals, additionally, mixing with fresh sea water is considered, so that optimum conditions for an optional subsequent treatment such as gassing for instance may be implemented.<br>
A drawback of the above-described prior art is that expensive installations for the treatment of the sea water, especially prior to its discharging, are required.<br><br>
This not only increases maintenance time and costs but it will also make the use of flue gas purification plants more difficult in places where the require-ments concerning safe operation and limit values to be observed are very high.<br>
Accordingly, it is an  object  of the present invention to enhance a flue gas purification plant of the above-described kind in such a way that an im¬provement can be obtained with respect to the aforementioned drawbacks.<br>
Concerning the device, there is proposed as a solution that the washing tower is arranged above a canal which is flown through by sea water.<br>
The invention leaves the prior art concept which includes a sump in the washing tower and proposes for the first time that this sump be replaced by a canal which is flown through by sea water. It is made possible thereby to remove all the units associated with the sump, for instance circulation pumps, strainers and the like from the flue gas purification plant, especially from the washing tower. The fact of removing these installations, preferably the recycling from the sump to the reaction zone, will already result in a clear improvement of the reliability, especially also because the system can be technically less complex. The agent leaving the reaction zone will directly fall in the washing tower canal that is flown through by sea water and mixes there directly with fresh sea water, thereby providing optimum conditions for the required further treatment of the sea water. A suitable determination of the volume flow rates or mass flow rates will provide for a corresponding treatment and for optimum conditions for a subsequent further treatment. Due to this configuration, technically complicated filter installations can be saved in addition, because the sea water is allowed to flow through the canal without hindrance. Preferably, the sea water having added to it the agent from the washing tower area can be removed substantially directly through the canal.<br><br>
Preferably, the canal is arranged below the reaction zone. It may be provided that the canal is arranged directly below the inlet opening for the flue gas to the washing tower. In this way, a washing tower can be obtained which requires only little space. The flue gas flows through the washing tower opposite to the gravity from the bottom up, as it has been described at the beginning. In the upper part of the washing tower, the sea water-based agent is for instance fed through nozzles on one or several levels and mutually reacts with the flue gas within the reaction zone. The conditions of the method are set so that the sea water-based agent has a certain dwell time in the reaction zone. Thereafter, it falls from the reaction zone downwardly, due to the force of gravity, and is fed to the sea water which flows through the canal. Accordingly, no propelling means are required for the agent in the reaction zone. With its entry in the sea water flowing through the canal, the agent is immediately removed from the washing tower region. For this reason it is possible for the washing tower to be optimally dimensioned regarding its actual purifying function.<br>
It is a particular advantage when the width of the canal in the region of the washing tower substantially corresponds to a diameter of the washing tower. In this way, the washing tower may be placed directly above the canal, whereby a device having a simple construction can be obtained. Of course, one may also provide that the canal passes successively through several washing towers which can be arranged on the canal for instance next to each other or one after the other. Depending on the requirements, it may be of course provided that the flue gas flows to a series of washing towers which are fluidically successively arranged in series, which washing towers are equally flown through by sea water from the canal from several canals. An easy adjustment for differently contaminated flue gases can be achieved for instance by merely adjusting the cascade arrangement corresponding to the needs. In addition, there are the already known controlling and regulating options for adjusting the purification power according to the needs.<br><br>
It is further proposed that the canal isenlarged to a basin shape fluidically downstream of the entry of the sea water-based agent leaving the reaction zone. Thereby it can be achieved that the flow in the canal is reduced of its velocity. This makes it possible that undesired suspended particles can deposit on the bottom of the conduit. These may be removed from time to time by means of pushers and the like, so that a further purification of the sea water to be recycled can be achieved. It may be provided for instance that the basin-shaped enlargement exceeds the width of the canal by the factor of approxi¬mately 2 to 15. If necessary, the basin-shaped expansion may include zones for depositing suspended particles, which zones are fluidically optimized, so that a corresponding deposit, for instance in the form of mud or the like, can be easily removed from the canal at preferred locations.<br>
In order to provide better conditions for observing limit values, a supply for fresh sea water may be arranged in the region of the basin-shaped enlargement of the canal. Moreover, deposits in the region of the basin-shaped enlargement can be avoided by the fact that a correspondingly strong flow is attainable at least temporarily. In this way, reliability and easy operation can be further improved.<br>
According to a further advantageous construction, it is proposed that the canal includes a catalyst unit which is arranged fluidically downstream of the entry of the sea water-based agent that leaves the reaction zone. The catalyst unit may be provided for neutralizing or transforming further undesired chemical com¬pounds so that the same may be removed as suspended particles from the sea water, especially in the region of the basin-shaped enlargement, or may be transformed into chemically harmless material.<br>
It is proposed in particular that the catalyst unit be arranged in the region of the basin-shaped enlargement. Preferably, the same is arranged in the wall or bot¬tom area of the basin-shaped enlargement. Of course, the catalyst unit may be<br><br>
also provided in the form of a scaffold, stand or the like arranged in the basin-shaped enlargement, in order to be able to form a surface which is as large as possible for contacting the sea water.<br>
According to a further construction, it is proposed that the canal includes an oxidant supplying unit which is arranged fluidically downstream of the entry of the sea water-based agent which leaves the reaction zone. With said oxidant supplying unit the sea water may be supplied with an oxidant for oxidizing un-desired substances in the sea water. Air, oxygen and the like may be supplied for instance as an oxidant. The oxidant supplying unit may for instance be in the form of a tube system which is arranged in the bottom area of the basin-shaped enlargement and which includes corresponding pores through which the oxidant can be supplied to the sea water. In a particularly advantageous manner the oxidant supplying unit is arranged in the region of the basin-shaped enlarge¬ment so that it is possible to achieve a dwell time of e.g. a gaseous oxidant within the sea water that is as long as possible if the process parameters are appropriately set.<br>
According to a further development of the invention, it is proposed that the canal includes sea water extraction means which are arranged fluidically upstream of the entry of the sea water-based agent which leaves the reaction zone. Said extraction means may be formed for example by pumps that suction input projects into the canal via a corresponding extraction filter. The sea water, that has been taken out, can be supplied as an agent to the flue gas purification plant. For instance, the sea water, that has been taken out, can be injected through nozzles in the reaction zone. Of course, the sea water, that has been taken out, may have added to it further substances through which the effectiveness in the reaction zone may be improved or extended. Preferably, this may happen in dependence of the contaminants contained in the flue gas.<br><br>
Furthermore, the canal includes control means for controlling the flow in the canal fluidically upstream of the entry of the sea water-based agent leaving the reaction zone. These control means may be formed for example by adjustable barriers, controllable pumps and the like. In this way, the volume flow rate in the canal can be controlled. Preferably, the volume flow rate is adapted to the purification power of the flue gas purification plant or the washing tower. This helps saving energy.<br>
In an advantageous further development, the washing tower includes a supply canal for fresh sea water which supply canal discharges into the canal. With this supply canal, it is possible to additionally supply fresh sea water to the canal, so that contaminant concentrations as well as the pH-value and the like can be reduced. The supply canal may additionally include control means for controlling the supplied volume flow rate of fresh sea water. The control means may be connected to a regulation means which appropriately sets the volume flow rate in dependence of a measured actual value in the canal. Here, a nominal value can be provided as a setting parameter for the regulation.<br>
Preferably, the discharge of the supply canal into the canal is arranged between the washing tower and the enlargement portion. This makes it possible to reduce in said enlargement portion the desired pH-value or the desired con¬taminant values prior to further treatment steps, in order to be able to more ef¬fectively perform said treatment steps. Moreover, it is possible to reduce the requirements concerning the design of the canal or the enlargement portion.<br>
According to an advantageous further development, means for generating a tur¬bulent flow are provided in the region of the discharge. It is possible thereby to achieve an intimate mixing of the agent-loaded sea water in the canal with fresh sea water that is supplied. The homogeneity in the sea water regarding the pH-value or contaminants can be further improved. The means may be formed for<br><br>
instance by barriers, obstacles, special junction connectors of the supply canal and the like.<br>
According to a further development the washing tower may include a by-pass canal, with which sea water can be branched off from the canal fluidically upstream of the washing tower and can be at least partly returned again fluidically downstream of the washing tower. Accordingly, it is possible to achieve in a simple way that the washing tower is not flown through by sea wa¬ter for a short time during maintenance, so that the canal can be accessed in the region of the washing tower. In this way, deposits can be easily removed and damage, leaks and the like repaired.<br>
The flow in the canal can be distributed to the by-pass canal and to the canal leading through the washing tower according to the needs. This may be advantageous for instance when additional agents are supplied together with the sea water flowing through the washing tower, in order to be able to keep the concentration of these agents within a predetermined favourable range.<br>
There is further proposed with the invention a method for operating a flue gas purification plant, especially a washing tower, wherein a sea water-based agent is supplied to a reaction zone of the flue gas purification plant and is introduced in the flue gas flowing through the flue gas purification plant, wherein said agent is introduced in a canal, which sea water is flown after leaving the reaction zone.<br>
Differently from prior, art the invention for the first time provides a method, in which the agent, which leaves the reaction zone, is directly supplied to the sea water flowing through the flue gas purification plant and is removed from the flue gas purification plant substantially directly with the sea water. Accordingly, no recycling is provided. For this reason, the flue gas purification plant or the washing tower can be clearly simplified concerning their construction, thereby<br><br>
saving costs and time. Moreover, the direct mixing of the agent leaving the reaction zone with the sea water flowing through the plant provides optimum conditions for any necessary further treatment. The invention further allows fresh agent being permanently added to the reaction zone, so that constantly uniform and equally effective reaction conditions can be achieved. Easy proc¬ess control can be achieved in addition.<br>
A particularly simple form of the method is obtained when the agent in the reac¬tion zone is propelled by means of gravitation, whereby certain driving means can be saved, which fact results in reduction of costs and maintenance.<br>
Preferably, the canal is supplied with fresh sea water. This embodiment makes it possible to further improve the creation of homogeneous process conditions, so that the process management can be further simplified. Expensive and complicated recycling systems and the like as well the corresponding ac¬cessories can be saved.<br>
According to a further advantageous proposal, sea water, which is bled out from the canal fluidically upstream of the entry of the sea water-based agent leaving the reaction zone, is used as an agent. Due to this fact the use of chemicals or the like which not only cause additional costs but also problems concerning their disposal can be avoided to a large extent or can be at least reduced. All in all a very simple method can be achieved which can be put into practice also in developing countries, due to the low cost and simple construction.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention provides that in the region of the entry of the sea water-based agent leaving the reaction zone a turbulent flow is generated in the sea water flowing through the canal. Due to this fact it is possible to obtain an intimate mixing of the agent with the sea water. The turbulent flow can be produced for instance by obstacles in the canal, preferably in the area of the washing tower and the like.<br><br>
It is further proposed that fresh sea water is supplied to the canal fluidically downstream of the entry of the sea water-based agent leaving the reaction zone. In this way it is possible to create further improved conditions, so that the prescribed limit values can be observed more easily.<br>
Preferably, the supply of fresh sea water is controlled. In this way there is added only the amount of fresh sea water which is required for observing the pre¬scribed limit values. Energy can be saved thereby.<br>
It is especially advantageous when a pH-value is regulated by the supply of the fresh sea water. The treated sea water is intended for being returned for instance to the sea where it has been removed from. According to one proposal the pH-value of the sea water after the mixing should not fall below pH 6. This provision can regulate for instance the delivery rate for the agent to be supplied to the reaction zone as well as the volume flow rate of fresh sea water flowing through the canal. The efficiency of the method can be further improved.<br>
A further improvement may be obtained by mixing the agent-loaded sea water with fresh sea water, whereby it is possible to achieve an increase in the pH-value on one side and optimized conditions for the further treatment on the other side. The mixing can be improved by producing a turbulent flow in the sea water. Said turbulent flow can be produced for instance by suitably supplying the fresh sea water to the canal.<br>
Preferably, the sea water-based agent is supplied to the reaction zone through nozzles. This allows introducing the agent in a finely dispersed form in the flue gas to be purified, while forming a surface with respect to the flue gas which is as large as possible, so that a purification can be obtained which is as effective as possible. The effectiveness of the method can be further improved.<br><br>
Advantageously, it is further proposed that an oxidant is added to the sea water fluidically downstream of the entry of the sea water-based agent leaving the reaction zone, whereby it can be achieved that undesired substances of content in the sea water are oxidized into harmless substances.<br>
In one embodiment it is proposed that the fresh sea water is supplied fluidically upstream of the adding oxidant, which fact makes it possible to increase the pH-value already prior to the addition of the oxidant, in order to be able to improve the effectiveness of the oxidant. This allows reducing the total oxidant addition.<br>
Moreover, it may be provided that a catalytic reaction is performed fluidically downstream of the entry of the sea water-based agent leaving the reaction zone in the sea water. In this way, too it is possible to transform undesired sub¬stances in the seawater into substances which are harmless or can precipitate. Of course, it may be also provided that through the catalytic reaction sub¬stances are transformed in such a manner that, in cooperation with an oxidizing reaction by an oxidant, the same can be transformed into harmless substances.<br>
Of course, it may be provided in particular that, prior to performing the catalytic reaction, fresh sea water is also supplied first, whereby process parameters may be optimized, resulting in lower costs for the process management.<br>
Furthermore, it turned out as advantageous if a portion of the sea water is branched off from the canal fluidically upstream of the washing tower and is returned to the canal fluidically downstream of the washing tower by means of a by-pass canal. This allows adjusting the volume flow rate of the sea water flowing through the washing tower according to the needs and for a short time, so that for instance contaminant fluctuations in the flue gas or also fluctuations in the amount of the flue gas can be compensated. The process management is further simplified.<br><br>
It is proposed in particular that at least one of the process steps is performed partly outside of the washing tower. Preferably, especially steps for a secondary treatment of the sea water are performed outside the washing tower, so that constructionally simple systems can be achieved.<br>
Further advantages and features will become apparent from the following de¬scription in conjunction with a schematic drawing showing one embodiment which merely serves for explaining the invention and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any respect.<br>
It is shown by<br>
Figure 1       a schematic representation of a flue gas purification plant for a combustion furnace for the combustion of anthracite, and<br>
Figure 2       a perspective view of an arrangement including a washing tower according to the invention.<br>
In figure 1 there is schematically represented a structure of the kind as de¬scribed for a flue gas purification, wherein a conduit 34 removes a flue gas from a combustion furnace not further illustrated. The conduit 34 leads into a flue gas inlet 14 of a washing tower 12. The flue gas inlet 14 is arranged in the lower part of the washing tower 12. In the upper part of the washing tower 12 a flue gas outlet is arranged which is in a fluidic connection with a chimney 22 through which the purified flue gas is discharged to the atmosphere.<br>
Between its flue gas inlet 14 and its flue gas outlet 16 said washing tower 12 includes a reaction zone 18 having arranged in the upper part thereof a nozzle feed system 36, by means of which sea water as an agent is fed through nozzles in the flue gas flowing through the washing tower 12 from the bottom to the top. After having left the reaction zone 18 due to a gravity effect, the sea<br><br>
water, that is fed through nozzles, is supplied to canal 20 arranged below the flue gas inlet 14 in the washing tower 12. By said canal 20 sea water is supplied to and removed from the washing tower 12. Accordingly, the sea water flows through the washing tower 12 in the lower part thereof. For this reason, the washing tower 12 is placed onto the canal 20.<br>
Through a pump 30 (figure 2) fresh sea water is supplied to the nozzle feed system 36. Further, fluidically downstream of the washing tower 12, the canal 20 is enlarged to form a neutralizing basin 38 which receives fresh sea water in addition to the exhausted sea water from the canal 20. The neutralizing basin 38 is connected to a sea water return passage (not further illustrated), through which neutralized sea water is returned to the waters.<br>
Figure 2 shows in a perspective view details of a flue gas purification plant in¬cluding the arrangement of a washing tower 12 and a sea water canal 20 ac¬cording to the invention. The canal 20 supplies in its section 24 fresh sea water to the flue gas purification plant 10 from waters not further described. The canal 20 is passed through the lower part of the washing tower 12 below the flue gas inlet 14. On the opposite side of the section 24 a discharge opening 26 for the sea water-loaded agent is arranged on the washing tower 12. The same is joined by a basin-shaped enlargement 40 of the canal 20 which comprises the neutralizing basin 38. The enlargement 40 includes an oxidant supply unit 32 which is arranged in the lower part of the enlargement 40. By means of an air supply system 42, air is supplied to the agent-loaded sea water in a finely dispersed form. Designated by reference number 44 is the flow of the sea water through the canal 20.<br>
Above the flue gas inlet 14, the washing tower 12 includes the reaction zone 18 which is upwardly joined by the flue gas outlet 16. Accordingly, the flue gas flows against gravitation from the bottom to the top through the washing tower 12. A nozzle feed system 36 is arranged in the reaction zone 18 and is fluidj-<br><br>
cally connected to pumps 30 via passages 46. The pumps 30 pump fresh sea water through the passages 46 to the nozzle feed system 38 from a portion 28 fluidically upstream of the portion 24. In the present embodiment of the inven¬tion, exclusively fresh sea water is used as an agent for the flue gas purification.<br>
The sea water, which is supplied through the nozzles to the reaction zone 18, mutually reacts with the flue gas flowing through the washing tower 12, and contaminants are removed from the flue gas during this action. The same ac¬cumulate in the sea water discharged through the nozzles, which sea water falls down into the canal 20. The agent arriving at the canal 20, in this case the sea water, which is discharged through the nozzles, mixes with the fresh sea water flowing through the canal 20 and enters the enlargement 40. There, air is supplied to the agent-loaded sea water in a finely dispersed form through the oxidant supply unit 32.<br>
By means of a control valve (not further shown), the volume flow rate of the sea water can be controlled. For this purpose an actual pH-value detection (not fur¬ther shown) is provided in the enlargement 40 for measuring the pH-value. This pH-value is compared to a nominal pH-value. Since the pH-value of the agent leaving the reaction zone 18 is approximately 3, the mixing with fresh sea water in the canal 20 will cause an increase in the pH-value. This increase depends on the fact how the volume flow rate of the fresh sea water supplied to the canal 20 is adjusted with respect to the agent.<br>
As it can be seen from figure 2, a supply conduit 48 is provided as a bypass-canal which leads into the canal 20 downstream of the washing tower 12, but still before the enlargement 40. By the supply conduit 48 fresh sea water is supplied which has previously been taken out from the canal 20 upstream of the washing tower 12. With this additionally supplied fresh sea water the pH-value within the enlargement 40 is further increased, namely before the oxidant is added, whereby the effectiveness of the oxidant can be improved. The<br><br>
discharge 50 leading into the canal 20 is designed in such a way that a turbulent flow is obtained, whereby an intimate mixing of the agent-loaded sea water with the fresh water can take place.<br>
The present embodiment further provides that the volume flow of the fresh sea water in the supply conduit 48 can be controlled, so that a fine regulation of the pH-value can be achieved.<br>
As it is known, the pH-value of sea water is within a range of approx 7.5 to 8.5. Now, with the regulation it is possible for the pH-value in the region of the dis¬charge opening 25 to reach the value of 6, by adjusting the flow rate. With a pH-value like this the mixture of agent and fresh sea water can be supplied to the enlargement 40.<br>
The embodiment shown in the drawing is merely intended for better under¬standing the invention, without limiting the invention.<br><br>
