The activating technique of bulk electrolysis involves the electrochemical oxidation of the metal complex under electrolysis conditions in the presence of a supporting electrolyte comprising a noncoordinating, inert anion. In the technique, solvents, supporting electrolytes and electrolytic potentials for the electrolysis are used such that electrolysis byproducts that would render the metal complex catalytically inactive are not substantially formed during the reaction. More particularly, suitable solvents are materials that are: liquids under the conditions of the electrolysis (generally temperatures from 0 to 100Â°C), capable of dissolving the supporting electrolyte, and inert. "Inert solvents" are those that are not reduced or oxidized under the reaction conditions employed for the electrolysis. It Is generally possible in view of the desired electrolysis reaction to choose a solvent and a supporting electrolyte that are unaffected by the electrical potential used for the desired electrolysis. Preferred solvents include difluorobenzene (all isomers), DME, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The electrolysis may be conducted in a standard electrolytic cell containing an anode and cathode (also referred to as the working electrode and counter electrode respectively). Suitably materials of construction for the ceil are glass, plastic, ceramic and glass coated metal. The electrodes are prepared from inert conductive materials, by which are meant conductive materials that are unaffected by the reaction mixture or reaction conditions. Platinum or palladium are preferred inert conductive materials. Normally, an ion permeable membrane such as a fine glass frit separates the cell into separate compartments, the wori<ing electrode compartment and counter compartment. the working is immersed in a reaction medium comprising metal complex to be activated solvent supporting electrolyte any other materials desired for moderating electrolysis or stabilizing resulting complex. mixture of electrolyte. voltage may determined by theoretical calculations experimentally sweeping cell using reference such as silver background current draw absence also determined. completed when drops from level level. this manner complete conversion initial can easily detected.></ing>
Suitable supporting electrolytes are salts comprising a cation and an inert, compatible, noncoordinating anion. A-. Preferred supporting electrolytes are salts corresponding to the formula:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
G+ is a cation which is nonreactive towards the starting and resulting complex, and A" is a noncoordinating, compatible anion.<br>
Examples of cations. G+. include tetrahydrocarbyl substituted ammonium or phosphonium cations having up to 40 nonhydrogen atoms. A preferred cation is the tetra-n-butylammonium cation.<br>
During activation of the complexes of the present invention by bulk electrolysis the cation of the supporting electrolyte passes to the counter electrode and A" migrates to the working electrode to become the anion of the resulting oxidized product. Either the solvent or the cation of the supporting electrolyte is reduced at the counter electrode in equal molar quantity with the amount of oxidized metal complex formed at the working electrode.<br>
Preferred supporting electrolytes are tetrahydrocarbyiammonium salts of tetrakis(pertluoroaryl) borates having from 1 to 10 carbons in each hydrocarbyl group, especially tetra-n-butylammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate.<br>
The molar ratio of catalyst/cocatalyst employed preferably ranges from 1:10,000 to 100:1, more preferably from 1:5000 to 10:1, most preferably from 1:10 to 1:2.<br>
in general, the catalysts can be prepared by combining the two components in a suitable solvent at a temperature within the range from 'lOO'C to 300Â°C. The catalyst may be separately prepared prior to use by combining the respective components or prepared in situ by combination in the presence of the monomers to be polymerized. It is preferred to form the catalyst in situ due to the exceptionally high catalytic effectiveness of catalysts prepared in this manner. The catalysts' components are sensitive to both moisture and oxygen and should be handled and transferred in an inert atmosphere.<br>
As previously mentioned the present metal complexes are highly desirable for use in preparing supported catalysts. The presence of the alkoxy functionality in the bridging group has been discovered to be particularly beneficial in allowing the complexes to chemically bind to aluminum or silicon atoms of the matrix or hydroxyl, silane or chlorosiiane functionality of the substrate materials. Especially suited substrates include alumina or silica. Suitable supported catalyst systems are readily prepared by contacting the present metal complexes with the substrate optionally while subjecting to heating and/or reduced pressures. A Lewis base, especially a trialkylamine can be present to assist in the reaction between the support and the siloxane functionality of the metal complexes.<br><br>
Preferred supports for use in the present invention include hignly porous silicas, aluminas, aluminosiiicates. and mixtures thereof. The most preferred support material is silica. The support material may be in granular, agglomerated, pelletized. or any other physical form. Suitable materials include, but are not limited to. silicas available from Grace Davison (division of W.R. Grace &amp; Co.) under the designations SD 3216.30. Davison Syloid 245. Davison 948 and Davison 952. and from Degussa AG under the designation Aerosil 812; and aluminas available from Akzo Chemicals Inc. under the designation Ketzen Grade B.<br>
Supports suitable for the present invention pro erably have a surface area as determined by nitrogen porosimetry using the B.E.T. method from 10 to 1000 m^/g, and preferably from 100 to 600 m^/g. The pore volume of the support, as determined by nitrogen adsorption, advantageously is between 0.1 and 3 cm^/g, preterably from 0.2 to 2 cm^/g. The average particle size is not critical, but typically is from 0.5 to 500 Mm, preferably from 1 to 100 Mm.<br>
Both silica and alumina are known to inherently possess small quantities of hydroxyl functionality attached to the crystal structure. When used as a support herein, these materials are preferably subjected to a heat treatment and/or chemical treatment to reduce the hydroxyl content thereof. Typical heat treatments are carried out at a temperature from 30 to 1000Â°C for a duration of 10 minutes to 50 hours in an inert atmosphere or under reduced pressure. Typical chemical treatments include contacting with Lewis acid alkylating agents such as trihydrocarbyl aluminum compounds, trihydrocarbylchloro-silane compounds, trihydrocarbylaikoxysilane compounds or similar agents. Preferred silica or alumina materials for use herein have a surface hydroxyl content that is less than 0.8 mmol hydroxyl groups per gram of solid support, more preferably less than 0.5 mmol per gram. The hydroxyl content may be determined by adding an excess of diaikyi magnesium to a slurry of the solid support and determining the amount of dialkyi magnesium remaining in solution via known techniques. This method is based on the reaction:<br>
S-OH + Mg{Alk)2 --&gt; S-OMg(Alk) + (Alk)H,<br>
wherein S is the solid support, and Alk is a C1.4 alkyl group.<br>
The support may be unfunctionalized (excepting for hydroxyl groups as previously disclosed) or functionalized by treating with a silane or chlorosilane functionalizing agent to attach thereto pendant silane -(Si-R)=, or chlorosilane -(Si-CI)= functionality, wherein R is a C1.10 hydrocarbyl group. Suitable functionalizing agents are compounds that react with surface hydroxyl groups of the support or react with the silicon or aluminum of the matrix. Examples of suitable functionalizing agents include phenylsilane, diphenylsilane, methylphenylsilane, dimethylsilane, diethylsilane, dichlorosilane and dichlorodimethylsilane.<br><br>
Techniques for forming such funciionaiizea silica or aiumina compounas were oreviousiv disclosed in USP's 3,687,920 and 3.879.368.<br>
The support may also be treated with an aluminum component selected from an alumoxane or an aluminum compouna of the formula AIR',R2y', wherein R^ independently each occurrence is hydride or R; R^ is hydride. R or OR; x' is 2 or 3: y' is 0 or 1 and the sum of x' and y' is 3. Examples of suitable R' and R^ groups include methyl, methoxy, ethyl, ethcxy, propyl (all isomers), prcpoxy (all isomers), butyl (all isomers), butoxy (all isomers), phenyl, phenoxy, benzyl, and benzyloxy. Preferably, the aluminum component is selected from the group consisting of aluminoxanes and tri(Ci.4 hydrocarbyl)aluminum compounds, ivlost preferred aluminum components are aluminoxanes, trimethyl aluminum, triethyl aluminum, tri-isobutyl aluminum, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Alumoxanes (also referred to as aluminoxanes) are oligomeric or polymeric aluminum oxy compounds containing chains of alternating aluminum and oxygen atoms, whereby the aluminum carries a substituent, preferably an alkyl group. The structure of alumoxane is believed to be represented by the following general formulae (-AI(R)-0)m', for a cyclic alumoxane, and R2AI-0(-AI(R)-0)rT,'-AIR2, for a linear compound, wherein R is as previously defined, and m' is an integer ranging from 1 to 50, preferably at least 4. Alumoxanes are typically the reaction products of water and an aluminum alkyl, which in addition to an alkyl group may contain haiide or alkoxide groups. Reacting several different aluminum alkyl compounds, such as for example trimethyl aluminum and tri-isobutyl aluminum, with water yields so-called modified or mixed alumoxanes. Preferred alumoxanes are methylalumoxane and methylalumoxane modified with minor amounts of C2^ alkyl groups, especially isobutyl. Alumoxanes generally contain minor to substantial amounts of starting aluminum alkyl compound.<br>
Particular techniques for the preparation of alumoxane type compounds by contacting an aluminum alkyl compound with an inorganic salt containing water of crystallization are disclosed in US-A-4,542,119. In a particular preferred embodiment an aluminum alkyl compound is contacted with a regeneratable water-containing substance such as hydrated alumina, silica or other substance. This is disclosed in EP-A-338,044. Thus the alumoxane may be incorporated into the support by reaction of a hydrated alumina or silica material, which has optionally been functionalized with silane, siloxane, hydrocarbyloxysilane, or chlorosilane groups, with a tri(Ci.io alkyl) aluminum compound according to known techniques.<br>
The treatment of the support material in order to also include optional alumoxane or trialkylaluminum loadings involves contacting the same before, after or simultaneously with addition of the complex or activated catalyst hereunder with the alumoxane or trialkylaluminum compound, especially triethylaluminum or triisobutylaluminum. Optionally<br><br>
the mixture can also be heated under an inert atmospnere for a period ana at a temperature sufficient to fix the aiumoxane. tnalkylaluminum compound, complex or catalyst system to the support. Optionally, the treated support component containing aiumoxane or the tnalkylaluminum compound may be subjected to one or more wash steps to remove aiumoxane or tnalkylaluminum not fixed to the support.<br>
Besides contacting the support with aiumoxane the aiumoxane may be generated in situ by contacting an unhydrolyzed silica or alumina or a moistened silica or alumina with a trialkyi aluminum compound optionally in the presence of an inert diluent. Such a process is well known in the art, having been disclosed in EF-A-250,600, US-A-4,912,075, and US-A-5,008,228. Suitable aliphatic hydrocartjon diluents include pentane, isopentane, hexane, heptane, octane, isooctane, nonane, isononane, decane, cyclohexane, methyl-cyclohexane and combinations of two or more of such diluents. Suitable aromatic hydrocarbon diluents are benzene, toluene, xylene, and other alkyl or halogen substituted aromatic compounds. Most preferably, the diluent is an aromatic hydrocarbon, especially toluene. After preparation in the foregoing manner the residual hydroxyl content thereof is desirably reduced to a level less than 1.0 meq of OH per gram of support, by any of the previously disclosed techniques.<br>
The catalysts, whether or not supported in any of the foregoing methods, may be used to polymerize ethylenically and/or acetylenically unsaturated mononners having from 2 to 100,000 carbon atoms either alone or in combination. Preferred monomers include the C2.20 a-olefins especially ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, 1 -butene, 1 -pentene, 1 -hexene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-decene, long chain macromolecular a-olefins, and mixtures thereof. Other preferred monomers include styrene, C1-4 alkyl substituted styrene, tetrafluoroethylene, vinylbenzocyclobutane, ethylidenenorbomene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, vinylcyclohexane, 4-vinylcyclohexene, divinylbenzene, and mixtures thereof with ethylene. Long chain macromolecular a-olefins are vinyl terminated polymeric remnants formed in situ during continuous solution polymerization reactions. Under suitable processing conditions such long chain macromolecular units are readily polymerized into the polymer product along with ethylene and other short chain olefin monomers to give small quantities of long chain branching in the resulting polymer.<br>
In general, the polymerization may be accomplished at conditions well known in the prior art for Ziegler-Natta or Kaminsky-Sinn type polymerization reactions, such as temperatures from 0-250Â°C and pressures from atmospheric to 1000 atmospheres (0.1 to 100 t^Pa). Suspension, solution, slurry, gas phase or other process conditions may be employed if desired. The support, if present, is preferably employed in an amount to provide a weight ratio of catalyst (based on metal):support from 1:100,000 to 1:10, more preferably from 1:50,000 to 1:20, and<br><br>
most preferably from 1:10.000 to 1:30. Suitable gas phase reactions may utilize condensation of the monomer or monomers employed in the reaction, or of an inert diluent to remove heat from the reactor.<br>
In most polymerization reactions the molar ratio of catalystrpolymerizable compounds employed is from 10'^: 1 to 10':1, more preferably from 10"'^: 1 to lO'^l.<br>
Suitable solvents for polymerization via a solution process are noncoordinating, inert liquids. Examples include straight and branched-chain hydrocarbons such as isobutane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, and mixtures thereof; cyclic and alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methylcyclohexane, methylcycloheptane, and mixtures thereof; perfluorinated hydrocarbons such as perfiuorinated C4.10 alkanes, and aromatic and alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. Suitable solvents also include liquid olefins which may act as monomers or comonomers including ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, butadiene, cyclopentene, 1-hexene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, 1-octene, 1-decene, styrene, divinylbenzene, ethylidenenorbornene, aliylbenzene, vinyltoluene (including all isomers alone or in admixture), 4-vinylcyclohexene, and vinylcyclohexane. Mixtures of the foregoing are also suitable.<br>
The catalysts may also be utilized in combination with at least one additional homogeneous or heterogeneous polymerization catalyst in the same or in separate reactors connected in series or in parallel to prepare polymer blends having desirable properties. An example of such a process is disclosed in WO 94/00500, as well as W094/17112.<br>
One such polymerization process comprises: contacting, optionally in a solvent, one or more a-oiefins with a catalyst according to the present invention, in one or more continuous stirred tank or tubular reactors, or in the absence of solvent, optionally in a fluidized bed gas phase reactor, connected in series or parallel, and recovering the resulting polymer. Condensed monomer or solvent may be added to the gas phase reactor as is well known in the art.<br>
The foregoing technique also allows for the preparation of ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer compositions having a broad range of molecular weight distributions and composition distributions. Particularly desirable a-olefins for use in the foregoing processes are C4.8 a-olefins, most desirably 1-octene.<br><br>
