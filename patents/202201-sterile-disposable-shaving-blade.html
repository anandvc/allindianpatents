INTRODUCTION:<br>
As the Modern technology grows up and with the need to have ecofriendly environment nowadays Non-biodegradable materials are being replaced by Biodegradable materials and due to the lack of availability of the rare sources of metals, the scraped synthetic plastics are replacing the metals In many applications with high aesthetic appeal, lower weight, flexibility and easy handling etc., As a part of Human facial beauty is concerned shaving blades and the razor play major role. The use of non-sterile shaving blades may lead to spread of skin diseases and in case ot common razors in saloons there is a chance of spread of epidemic diseases. Also the commercial meta! shaving blades may have a high risk in handling and the metals under usage is non-degradable which are non-sterilized too may provide a source for epidemic disease spread. Also the competent manufacturers now manufacture Shaving Blade, which has platinum coated edges to give smooth shaving, and also twin, three headed blades have been under market. These are ot high cost the normal public find it difficult to go for such a product even it seems to hygienic and sterilized it seems to be too costly and become a boon for the poor people of India. So there rises a need for the invention to overcome the above said drawbacks by manufacturing a Shaving Blade which can replace the existing metal shaving blades to be used in the same cartridge to provide sterile condition and of<br>
low cost.<br>
The present invention of sterilized Disposable Shaving Blade consist of metallic scalpel edges and 75% of the metallic portion is being replaced by Plastic or any Biodegradable material with a aid to support an ecofriendly environment free from pollution. The Blade being sterilized under UV radiations to get rid of the pathogenic microbes which spread the skin diseases and also the blade is designed such that it can replace the normal existing Metallic blades to be used under the same razor unit. It is cheap and made available for poor to render free from the spread of the skin diseases and other epidemic conditions.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The Invention of Sterile Disposable Shaving Blade comprising:<br>
the body made of synthetic material that replaces the metallic stainless sheet<br>
to the extent of 75% and scalpel edges on either side of the body;<br>
the scalpel blade edges made of Stainless Steel being provided with a pulse<br>
train shaped arrangement for perfect fit between the plastic sheets;<br>
the synthetic material sheets are provided with the slot that is accepted<br>
internationally to fit in the cartridge of the razor;<br>
the scalpel blade is being fixed between the plastic sheets by thermal<br>
compressing the edges of the plastic sheets;<br>
the entire blade unit being sterilized using the Ultra Violet radiation<br>
DESCRIPTION:<br>
The Disposable Shaving Blade available in the commercial market is essentially made of a single piece of metallic Stainless Steel. Since there exist difficulty in handling the metallic blade and also because of the corrosion problem near the slotted edges these blades have high risk of Injuries while handling. Also the Blade is costly because of the material of construction being used and also the special blade edges are being coated with platinum metal.<br>
Also the non-sterile disposable blade show high chance of spreading skin diseases and skin infections like Scall, Tanea barbae etc.,<br>
In order to overcome the above difficulty and to make it available in a cheaper rate the present invention provides a Sterile Disposable shaving blade consisting of a body made from any synthetic materials that may be biodegradable in nature or essentially any thermoset plastic material. The essential parts of the present Invention are<br>
Body: It consist of two thin sheets of the synthetic material that is Biodegradable in nature. Bio plastics are biodegradable plastics, whose components are derived from renewable raw materials. These plastics can be made from abundant agricultural/animal resources like cellulose, starch, collagen, casein, soy protein polyesters are triglycerides. Large-scale use of these would help in preserving non¬renewable resources like metals, minerals and contribute to the problems of waste<br><br>
management. Biodegradable plastics degrade over a period of time if exposed to sun and air.<br>
Though the demand for biodegradable plastics is increasing, acceptance of biodegradable polymers is likely to depend on factors like<br>
•	Customer response to costs;<br>
•	Possible legislation by governments; and<br>
•	The achievement of total biodegradability.<br>
Immediate application areas identified in India for biodegradable plastics are Surgical<br>
Implants,  Industrial  Packaging, Wrapping,  Milk Sachets,  Foodservice,  Personal<br>
Care, Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Recreational, etc.<br>
The body may be necessarily made of any thermoplastic material that can be<br>
laminated under the application of heat. The body holds the two scalpel blade edges<br>
one on either side of the body.<br>
Scalpel Blade edges: The scalpel blade edges are made up of Stainless Steel with<br>
pulse train shaped teeth arrangement to get fix to the body, The blade is sharpened<br>
using special abrasion material.<br>
The body of the Blade consists of two elongated straight scalpel edges on each side of the body. It consists of two thin sheets of synthetic material in the range 0.3 - 0.5 mm thick more specifically 0.45mm and the synthetic material that may be biodegradable in nature most preferably thermo plastic sheets because of the wide availability and cheaper rates. The plastic sheets are made from plastic granules in the form of thin sheets and the necessary size of 12 X 44 mm pieces of two sheets one for upper part and another for lower part is removed.<br>
The elongated straight scalpel edge sheets made of Stainless Steel sheet is cut In to the regular size of 37 X 7 mm with the edges being rounded off and the inner side being provided with the pulse train arrangement to get hold on the body of the blade. The two metallic scalpel blades on either side of the plastic sheet is placed in such a way that the pulse train shaped projection will be facing on the side towards the body of the blade. The size of the projection is typically 3X2 mm made using the desired machinery and the edge sheet are straightened and smoothened with the ends are rounded off with a small curve.<br><br>
The scalpel blade edges are placed in between the two thin sheets with the edge being placed at sufficient distance from each other and the pulse train edges are bridged on the plastic sheets. The plastic sheets are then hot pressed at suitable temperature depending on the material being used for the manufacture of body. The heat is applied such that the plastic materials form a melt and upon cooling form a laminated form of the single sheet. The application of the heat holds the stainless steel edges firmly in between the sheets and makes it rigid on movement in the direction of the scalpel blade edge.<br>
After being formed into a single sheet the plastic sheet is punched to house a longitudinal universally designed slotted portion, which is 37 mm in length. The Scalpel edges are sharpened using the abrasive material and with this the shaving blade of the present invention is ready for embossing the trade name or market name on the plastic portion of the blade.<br>
The entire blade unit is then passed through ultra violet radiation to make it sterilized and render free from pathogens and microbes. Then the blades are sent to packaging unit for the bulk packages.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the body of the blade is made from any synthetic materials, which are biodegradable in nature. The Plastic being non¬biodegradable but render available In cheap rates and easy of application they are being used. So there exists also a chance to make use of any material that Is biodegradable and can be recycled.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the scalpel blade edges are coated with Platinum after sharpening to give smooth shaving.<br>
The following drawings explain the features of the present invention: FIG. 1.  Detailed parts of the Lower part of the Shaving Blade FIG. 2.  Lower part of the Shaving Blade along with scalpel Blade edge FIG 3.    Final Laminated form of Shavina Blade<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Drawings:<br>
The body of blade consists of two elongated straight scalpel edges one on each side of the body. It consists of two plastic sheets one over the other with the slotted central portion designed universally to fit in to any razor.<br>
Elongated straight scalpel edge sheets (A of figure 1) are made of Stainless Steel with their edges sharpened. The scalpel metal sheet has pulse train like grooved arrangement (D of figure 1) to fit perfectly between the upper and lower part of the plastic body. The size of the elongated straight scalpel stainless sheet is 37x 7mm including the width of pulse train shaped projection (D of figure 1). The pulse train shaped projection products will be present on the side towards the body of the blade. The width of the each projection means about 2 mm and gap between the two adjacent projections is 3mm. In the process of manufacture of the scalpel edge sheets, stainless steel pieces of 37x7mm may be cut and thus the projection may be made as per the given dimensions to give prefect fit in to the plastic sheets. These cuts are made by using desired machinery to maintain uniformity in the scalpel edges. Further the scalpel edge sheet will be straightened, smoothened and the ends are rounded off with a curve (E of figure 1).<br>
The body of the blade consists of two synthetic material sheets, which is of 0.3-0.5mm thick preferably 0.45 mm thick so that the overall thickness after being sandwiched to get the normal blade thickness or little more. The Synthetic material sheets may be of biodegradable material or Synthetic Plastic material like Thermo plastic material or any lightweight materials with an aim to replace the metallic part more preferable in this invention It is manufactured of pure plastic granules. The body of the Blade essentially consists of 44 x 12 mm plastic sheets for upper and lower parts of the razor blade, which are cut from long sheets made up of pure plastic granules.<br>
In between the above mentioned two plastic sheets, one stainless steel scalpel edges one on each side will be introduced mechanically at equal distances with the inner edge of the pulse train arrangement to match with the outer border of the plastic sheet so that, only pulse train shaped edge will be kept in between the two plastic sheets and subsequently the two plastic sheets will be compressed by<br><br>
applying proper temperature, with the results the stainless steel edges will be held tightly in between the two plastic sheets of the razor body by this process it will have even, uriiform and standard look. The scalpel is rigidly fixed, as on application of the heat on the thermally setting plastic may clamp the teeth like arrangement and form a laminated sheet. There by rigidity is maintained in holding the scalpel edge blade.<br>
After the stainless steel scalpel sheets were introduced on the either side of the plastic body, the central region of the plastic body is punched to house a longitudinal universally designed slotted portion, which may be 37mm length (C of figure 1).<br>
Subsequently, the un-sharpened blade is sent to another machine for sharpening of the outer edges, with this the blade completes the manufacturing process and then they may be printed with the brand name and ready for the usage. Once after the machining part is over the blade may be moved into another chamber where they are sterilized by exposing them to any source of sterilization preferably Ultra Violet rays (UV) and sent to processor for packing the designed blades, as sets. Now the sterile disposable shaving blades are ready for marketing.<br>
The plastic sheets may be made from any scrap plastic material like PP, PVC and other styrene compounds. The plastic sheets may be of any attractive colour to make it much more attractive and market brand name can be embossed over it.<br>
Because of the sterile nature of the blade it prevents the spread of the infections and contagious diseases specifically skin diseases like seall, Tanea Barbac are being avoided. Thus the present invention aims at providing poor public about the usage of hygienic, attractive, cheap Sterile Disposable shaving blades with the reuse of the plastic scrap instead of costly metallic Stainless Steel. The given drawing help to define the invention in more detailed manner.<br><br><br>
