				<td>PENETRATION-RESISTANT MATERIAL COMPRISING FABRIC WITH HIGH LINEAR DENSITY RATIO OF TWO SETS OF THREADS<br>
The invention pertains to penetration-resistant material comprising a double layer of fabric with high linear density ratios of two sets of threads, and to articles made of the same.<br>
Penetration-resistant articles such as bulletproof vests, helmets, vehicle panels, and shields prepared from high strength fibers are known in the art. For many applications, in particular for ballistic vests, the fibers are used in a woven or knitted fabric. These fabrics may be coated or impregnated in a matrix to obtain hard ballistic materials, or may be used free from matrix to obtain soft ballistic materials.<br>
Bulletproof woven fabrics are known, inter alia, from EP 310,199. The fabrics disclosed therein are composed of filament yarns of ultrahigh molecular weight polymer having high strength and high modulus, with the warp threads being of a different polymeric material than the weft threads.<br>
In Russian patent RU 2,096,542 a ballistic fabric for bulletproof jackets was disclosed having warp and weft threads of poly para-phenyleneterephthalamide (PPTA) wherein the ratio of warp to weft linear density is smaller than 4.17. Typically, warp threads having a linear-density of 143 to 588 dtex and weft threads having a linear density of 588 to 930^ were disclosed, the weft threads having equal or higher linear density than the warp threads. It is particularly contended that ballistic fabrics having warp to weft linear density ratios between 1.59 and 4.17 have improved deflection properties.<br>
In WO 00/42246 a penetration-resistant material is disclosed comprising at least a double layer of fabric composed of two layers of woven fabric which are cross-plied at an angle wherein the fabric is composed of a first set of threads comprising 3.5 to 20 threads/cm and having a linear density of at least 420 dtex, and a second set of threads comprising 0.5 to 8 threads/cm and having a linear density of at least 50 dtex, with the second set of threads being transverse to<br><br>
the first set of threads, and wherein the ratio of the linear density of the first set of threads to the linear density of the second set of threads is &gt; 4.2. more preferably &gt; 7.5. In a preferred embodiment the first set of threads is warp threads made of p-aramid yarn and the second set of threads is weft threads-of polyester yarn, and the ratio of the number of threads/cm of the first set to that of the second set is &gt; 1. Although the ballistic performance of this-article is excellent, the necessity of cross-plying the layers is a disadvantage in terms of ease and simplicity of the manufacture and the danger of creating weak points, that inherently to the process of cross-plying can occur.<br>
It has now been found that penetration-resistant materials with the advantages of the prior art materials but without their disadvantages can be made. To this end a penetration-resistant material is claimed comprising at least a double layer of woven fabric, characterized in that the double layer conmprisfes a first layer of fabric composed of a first set of threads comprising 3.5 to 20 threads/cm, having a linear density of at least 210 dtex, and comprising at least 65% of the fabric weight, and a second set of threads comprising 0.5 to 16 threads/cm and having a linear density of at least 50 dtex. with the second set of threads being transverse to the first set of threads, and the ratio of the number of threads/cm of the first set to that of the second set is &gt; 1, and a second layer of fabric composed of a first set of threads comprising 0.5 to 16 threads/cm and having a linear density of at least 50 dtex, and a second set of threads comprising 3.5 to 20 threads/cm. havtng a linear density of at least 210 dtex, and comprising at least 65% of the fabric weight, with the second set of threads being transverse to the first set of threads, and the ratio of the number of threads/cm of the second set to that of the first set is &gt; 1, and wherein the first and second sets of threads of the first layer have a parallel orientation towards the first and second sets, respectively, of threads of the second layer.<br>
Preferably, the penetration-resistant material has at least a ratio of the linear density of the first set of threads to the linear density of the second set of threads of the first layer and of the linear density of the second set of threads to<br><br>
the linear density of the first set of threads of the second layer is &gt; 1, more preferably &gt; 4.2. and most preferably &gt; 5.9. A particularly effective ratio is 6-6.6, The number of threads in the first set of threads of the first layer and the second set of threads of the second layer is 3.5 to 20 threads/cm. More preferably, the number is 4 to 15 threads/cm. and most preferably 5 to 12 threads/cm. The number of threads in the second set of threads of the first layer and the first set of threads of the second layer is 0.5 to 16 threads/cm. Preferably, the number is 0.5 to 8, more preferably 1 to 6 threads/cm. and most preferably 2 to 4 threads/cm. In each layer the threads having a.Jinear density of at least 210 dtex comprise at least 65% of the fabric weight of that layer. Preferably, these treads comprise at least 70%. and more preferably 75% of the fabric weight of that layer. For reasons of efficient manufacturing it is preferred that the first set of threads of the first layer and the first set of threads of the second layer are of warp threads and the second set of threads of the first layer and the second set of threads of the second layer are weft threads. The second set of threads is transverse to the first set of threads in each of the two layers. Although usually these sets are about perpendicular to each other, but this is not necessary. The second set of threads may be provided under at angle other than 90° to the first set of threads. The two layers are secured together without cross-plying.<br>
The penetration-resistant material also consists of a second set of threads of the first layer (preferably weft threads) and a first set of threads of the second layer (preferably warp threads), the yarn composition of which is not decisive for the present invention. Preferably, however, these threads have high strength and high modulus. This is particularly the case when these threads are selected from polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide. and aramid yarn. Most preferably, the second set of threads of the first layer and the first set of threads of the second layer is made of polyester yarn.<br>
The first set of threads of the first layer (preferably warp threads) and the second set of threads of the second layer (preferably weft threads) are of high strength and high modulus, and most preferably high tenacity threads from aramid. polyethylene, and poly-p-phenylenebenzobisoxazole (PBO) yarn are<br><br>
selected, more particularly p-aramid. Most preferred is poly para-phenyleneterephthalamide (PPTA). In a preferred embodiment the warp and weft threads are selected to be made of different polymers, for instance, a fabric having warp threads of p-aramid yarn and weft threads of polyester yarn, or reversed, is preferred.<br>

The linear density of the second set of threads of the first layer and the first set of threads of the second layer is selected to be at least about 50 dtex. more preferably between 50 and 280 dtex, and most preferably between about 80 and 140 dtex.<br>
The term "thread" means any sort of thread such as staple yarn, twisted staple yarn, twisted filament yarn, non-twisted intermingled yarn, and preferably, untwisted filament yarn.<br>
In a prefen^ed embodiment the threads of each of the two fabric layers of the double layer are bonded together, for instance, by stitch bonding, or preferably, with an adhesive material. The adhesive material may be adhesive material provided onto the threads or onto the fabric, for instance, as a finish. The adhesive material can also be an adhesive layer provided between the two fabric layers of the double layer. Adhesive materials include thermoplastic, elastomeric, and thermoset materials. It is also possible to use for at least part of the second set of threads of the first layer and the first set of threads of the second layer a material that melts under pressure and/or heating, thereby accomplishing binding the threads of the first set. respectively second set of threads to those of the second set, respectively first set of threads, and optionally also binding the two fabric layers together.

In another preferred embodiment at least one of the outer sideji of the penetration-resistant material is provided with a protective layer. The protective layer can be a themioplastic, thermoset, or an elastomeric material, or a mixture of these materials. The protective layer is applied to protect the fabric from damage by excessive abrasion and to improve the ballistic performance.<br>
The penetration-resistant material comprises at least one double layer consisting of two layers of woven fabric, which are non-cross-plied and optionally bonded together. The term woven includes all types of weaves, such as plain weave, satin weave, basket weave, twill weave, and the like; Preferred fabrics are plain woven.<br>

Suitable numbers of double layers are 5 to 100. and most preferably 6 to 35 double layers are used. The first set of threads of the first fabric layer of a double layer may be parallel to. or at an angle to, the first set of threads of the first fabric layer of the adjacent double layer. If these sets are secured together under an angle, such an angle is preferably 90°.<br>
The double layers are secured together using an adhesive layer or by stitching. Such an adhesive layer may be made of the previously mentioned materials for the adhesive materials and has a thickness between 4 and 36 ^, preferably between 8 and 20 ^i.<br>
Methods of manufacture of the double layers are well known in the art. Usually the fabric is made by warping the warp yam on a beam, followed by "weaving on<br><br>
a ioom. The single layer may optionally by impregnated or laminated, and be subjected to a calandering or lamination process. At least two fabric layers can be bonded together by stitching, heating, or applying pressure.<br>
The invention pertains also to articles like bulletproof vests and armor plates made of the above-mentioned woven fabric according to methods known to the skilled man.<br>
The invention is further illustrated with the following example.<br>
A construction was made containing 22 double layers. The first layer of each double layer was produced from Twaron® 930 dtex in warp (9.5 threads/cm) and polyester 140 dtex (Trevira® 710, ex Hoechst) in weft direction (2 threads/cm). The second layer of each double layer was produced from polyester 140 dtex (Trevira® 710, ex Hoechst) in warp direction (4 threats/cm) and Twaron® 930 dtex in weft direction (9.5 threads/cm). The warp/weft ratio of the first layer and the weft/warp ratio of the second layer was 6.6, The layers were laminated together with 3 plies of a polyethylene film (LDPE, ex EKB) having a thickness of 10p, one sheet of polyethylene film being placed on both outer sides of the double layer and one sheet of polyethylene film being placed in-between each of the two fabric layers of the double layer. The constnjction just described was placed in a press and pressed at a temperature of 120 **C and a pressure of 25 bar during 25 minutes. Then, the heating of the press was switched of. The total weight of the construction was about 4600 g/m^.<br>
V50 values were determined with 9x19 Para Type DM 11 A1B2 bullets, wherein V 50 is the velocity at which 50% of the bullets are stopped and 50% of the bullets give full penetration. It was found, that V 50 of this construction was 507 m/s.<br><br><br><br>
