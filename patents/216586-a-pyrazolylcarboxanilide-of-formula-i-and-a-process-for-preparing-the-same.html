"A PYRAZOLYLCARBOXANILIDE OF FORMULA (I) AND A PROCESS<br>
FOR PREPARING THE SAME"<br>
BAYER CROPSCIENCE AG, a German company of Alfred-Nobel-Str. 50, 40789 Monheim, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
GRANTED<br>
16-1-2008<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
135/MUM/2003<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel pyrazolylcarboxanilides, to a plurality of processes for their preparation and to their use for controlling harmful microorganisms in crop protection and the protection of materials.<br>
It is already known that numerous carboxanilides have fungicidal properties (cf. for example, EP 0 545 099 and JP 9132567). The activity of the substances described in these publiscation is good; however, at low application rates it is sometimes unsatisfactory.<br>
This invention now provides novel pyrazolylcarboxanilides of the formula (I)<br><br>
in which<br>
R        represents difluoromethyl or trifluoromethyl,<br>
R und R independently of one another represent halogen, cyano, nitro, C1-C6-alkyl, C2-C6-alkenyl, C1-C4-alkoxy, C1-C4-alkylthio, C1-C4-alkylsulphonyl, C3-C6-cycloalkyl, or represent C1-C4-haloalkyl, C1-C4-haloalkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkylthio or C1-C4-haloalkylsulphonyl having in each case 1 to 5 halogen atoms,<br>
R        represents fluorine.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that pyrazolylcarboxanilides of the formula (I) are obtained when<br>
a)        pyrazolylcarbonyl halides of the formula (II)<br><br>
LeA 35 930-Foreign Countnes<br><br><br><br>
in which<br>
R	is as defined above,<br>
X1        represents halogen,<br>
are reacted with aniline derivatives of the formula (HI)<br><br><br><br>
in which<br>
R1,R2and R3 are as defined above,<br>
if appropriate in the presence of an acid binder and if appropriate in the presence of a diluent, or<br>
b)        halopyrazolecarboxanilides of the formula (JV)<br><br>
in which<br>
R and R3are as defined above,<br>
X2       represents bromine or iodine,<br><br><br>
LeA 35 930-Foreign Countries<br>
are reacted with boronic acid derivatives of the formula (V)<br>
in which<br>
R1 and R2 are as defined above,<br>
G1 and G2 each represent hydrogen or together represent tetramethylethylene,<br>
in the presence of a catalyst, if appropriate in the presence of an acid binder and if appropriate in the presence of a diluent, or<br>
c)        halopyrazolecarboxanilides of the formula (IV)<br><br>
in which<br>
R and R3 are as defined above,<br>
X        represents bromine or iodine,<br>
are, in a first step, reacted with a diborane derivative of the formula (VI)<br><br>
in which<br>
G and G4 each represent alkyl or together represent alkanediyl,<br><br>
LeA 35 930-Foreign Countries<br>
in the presence of a catalyst, if appropriate in the presence of an acid binder and if appropriate in the presence of a diluent and are, without work-up, reacted in a second step with halobenzene derivatives of the formula (VII)<br><br>

X3       represents bromine, iodine or trifluoromethylsulphonyloxy,<br>
in the presence of a catalyst, if appropriate in the presence of an acid binder and if appropriate in the presence of a diluent.<br>
Finally, it has been found that the novel pyrazolylcarboxanilides of the formula (I) have very good microbicidal properties and can be used for controlling unwanted microorganisms both in crop protection and in the protection of materials.<br>

The active compounds according to the invention also show a strong invigorating action in plants. Accordingly, they are suitable for mobilizing the internal defences of the plant against attack by unwanted microorganisms.<br>
In the present context, plant-invigorating (resistance-inducing) compounds are to be understood as meaning substances which are capable of stimulating the defence system of plants such that, when the treated plants are subsequently inoculated with unwanted microorganisms, they display substantial resistance to these microorganisms.<br>
In the present case, unwanted microorganisms are to be understood as meaning phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. The compounds according to the invention can thus be used to protect plants within a certain period of time after treatment against attack by the pathogens mentioned. The period of time for which this protection is achieved generally extends for 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7 days, from the treatment of the plants with the active compounds.<br>
The fact that the active compounds are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations required for controlling plant diseases permits the treatment of above-ground parts of plants, of propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are also suitable for increasing the yield of crops. In addition, they show reduced toxicity and are well tolerated by plants.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
LeA 35 930-Foreign Countries<br>
If appropriate, the active compounds according to the invention can, at certain concentrations and application rates, also be employed as herbicides, for regulating plant growth and for controlling animal pests. If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors in the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. Plants are to be understood here as meaning all plants and plant populations, such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including plant cultivars which can or cannot be protected by plant breeders' certificates. Parts of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested material and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on, injecting and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multi-layer coating.<br>
In the protection of materials, the compounds according to the invention can be employed for protecting industrial materials against infection with, and destruction by, undesired microorganisms.<br>
Industrial materials in the present context are understood as meaning non-living materials which have been prepared for use in industry. For example, industrial<br><br><br>

Depending on their particular physical and/or chemical properties, the active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, pastes, granules, aerosols and microencapsulations in polymeric substances and in coating compositions for seeds, and ULV cool and warm fogging formulations.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents, liquefied gases under pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers. If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water. Liquefied gaseous extenders or carriers are to be understood as meaning liquids which are gaseous at standard temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellants such as halogenated hydrocarbons, or else butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Suitable solid carriers are: for example ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates. Suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. Suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example   alkylaryl   polyglycol   ethers,   alkylsulphonates,   alkyl   sulphates,   aryl-<br><br><br>
LeA 35 930-Foreign Countries<br>
sulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates. Suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can, as such or in their formulations, also be used in a mixture with known fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides or insecticides, to broaden, for example, the activity spectrum or to prevent development of resistance. In many cases, synergistic effects are obtained, i.e. the activity of the mixture is greater than the activity of the individual components.<br>

and preparations which comprise insecticidally active plant extracts, nematodes, fungi or viruses.<br>
A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers and growth regulators, safeners and/or semiochemicals is also possible.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention also have very good antimycotic activity. They have a very broad antimycotic activity spectrum in particular against dermatophytes and yeasts, moulds and diphasic fungi (for example against Candida species such as Candida albicans, Candida glabrata) and Epidermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus species such as Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton species such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes,<br><br>
LeA 35 930-Foreign Countries<br>
Microsporon species such as Microsporon canis and audouinii. The list of these fungi does by no means limit the mycotic spectrum which can be covered, but is only for illustration.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, wettable powders, pastes, soluble powders, dusts and granules. Application is carried out in a customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, broadcasting, dusting, foaming, spreading, etc. It is furthermore possible to apply the active compounds by the ultra-low volume method, or to inject the active compound preparation or the active compound itself into the soil. It is also possible to treat the seeds of the plants.<br>
When using the active compounds according to the invention as fungicides, the application rates can be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the kind of application. For the treatment of parts of plants, the active compound application rates are generally between 0.1 and 10,000g/ha, preferably between 10 and 1000 g/ha. For seed dressing, the active compound application rates are generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per kilogram of seed. For the treatment of the soil, the active compound application rates are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5000 g/ha.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br><br><br>
LeA 35 930-Foreign Countries<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having new properties ("traits") and which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They can be cultivars, varieties, bio- or genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferably treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes,<br><br>
LeA 35 930-Foreign Countries<br>
cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects, arachnids, nematodes and slugs and snails by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryIIA, CrylIIIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucoton® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned also include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br><br><br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the general formula (I) or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>

0.333g (1.3 mmol) of 3,4'-dichloro-3-fluoro-l,l'-biphenyl-2-amine and 0.33 g (1.56 mmol) of l-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-lH-pyrazole-4-carbonyl chloride are dissoJved in 6 mi of tetrahydrofuran, and 0.36 ml (2.6 mmol) of triethylamine is added. The reaction solution is stirred at 60°C for 16 hours. For work-up, the mixture is concentrated and the residue is chromatographed on silica gel using cyclohexane/ethyl acetate.<br>
This gives 0.39 g (72% of theory) of N-(3',4'-dichloro-3-fluoro-l,l'-biphenyl-2-yl)-l-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide of logP (pH 2.3) = 3.10.<br>
