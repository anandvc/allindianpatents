				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION OIL-RESISTANT RUBBER MODIFIED POLYSTYRENE COMPOSITION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a rubber modified polystyrene composition having excellent environmental stress-crack resistance (ESCR) properties, and more specifically, it relates to an oil-resistant rubber modified polystyrene composition.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
In general, rubber modified polystyrenes have good moldability and excellent physical properties, and have been used in various applications. However, conventional rubber modified polystyrenes have poor oil resistance and flon resistance, and for this reason, they tend to form environmental stress cracks and exhibit various other problems after only a short period of use. The resistance of various rubber modified polystyrenes to environmental stress-cracks caused by exposure to long chain oils or a fats has been studied, for example in Japanese PCT Patent Application Laid-Open No. 504450/1996 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 12845/1996, which describe oil-resistant rubber modified polystyrenes which may be used as margarine containers, trays for refrigerators and the like.<br>
Recently, resins used in food packaging have been required, as much as possible, to have reduced level of residual unreacted monomers and volatile<br>
1<br><br>
components, such as polymerization solvents. By volatile components, we mean components of the rubber modified polystyrene composition, usually low molecular weight compounds, capable of vaporizing at a temperature of 230°C or less, and/or a pressure of 760 mm Hg or less. Volatile components may therefore include unreacted monomers, dimers and trimers thereof, solvents, water, etc. Because it is now apparent that dimers and trimers of the monomers from which the composition is polymerized may be endocrine disruptors, residual levels of these dimers and trimers must be reduced as much as possible in resins used in food containers, for example, edible oil containers, cups for juices, and the like.<br>
Conventionally, resins having lower amounts of residual volatile components are prepared by heating the polymerization solution up to higher temperatures, or by reducing the pressure during the devolatilization step, so that the unreacted monomer and solvent are devolatilized from the polymerization solution. However, heating the polymerization solution to a higher temperature, decreases the degree of swelling and impairs the oil resistance of the resins thus formed, and the amount of residual dimer and trimer in the resin increases as the treatment temperature increases. In addition, reducing the pressure during devolatilization of the resin, and monomer and solvent recovery have the disadvantage of requiring additional energy.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides oil-resistant rubber modified polystyrene composition having reduced levels of residual volatile substances, as well<br>
2<br><br>
as reduced levels of dimer and trimer. The present inventors have found that the oilresistance properties of the rubber modified polystyrene are affected by the average volume particle diameter of the rubber phase, and the gel content and degree of swelling of the composition. Moreover, the devolatilization method also affects the oil-resistance properties, the degree of swelling and the level of residual volatile substances, dimer, and trimer.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1 is a 1/4 ellipsoidal jig with a scale for visually observing the occurrence of crazing or cracks in a sample of a rubber modified polystyrene composition according to the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The first embodiment of the present invention provides a rubber modified polystyrene composition in which polybutadiene rubber particles having an average volume particle diameter of 6 to 13 µm are dispersed in polystyrene. The gel content of the composition is preferably in the range of 25 to 35% by weight, the degree of swelling is in the range of 13 to 22, the residual volatile content is 2000 ppm or less, and the total amount of dimer and a trimer is 8000 ppm or less.<br>
The rubber modified polystyrene composition of the present invention, comprises polybutadiene rubber particles dispersed in polystyrene. The polybutadiene rubber preferably has a Mooney viscosity measured at 100°C (i.e., ML1+4(100°C)) of<br>
3<br><br>
40 to 80, and a 5.43 % by weight toluene solution of the polybutadiene rubber preferably has a viscosity at 25°C of 50 to 300 centipoise. The polybutadiene rubber may be any conventional polybutadiene rubber, including butadiene homopolymers and copolymers with other suitable monomers such as styrene and acrylonitrile. In addition, the polybutadiene may be cis or trans 1,4-polybutdiene, or combinations thereof, or have any combination of 1,2- or 1,4-butdiene units. Examples of suitable polybutadiene rubbers include NF55A (trade name, made by Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), DIENE 55AC and 70AC (trademarks, made by Firestone Co., Ltd.), Taktene 550 and 710, Buna CB HX530 and Buna CB1414 (trade names, made by Beyer AG), and BR1220SU (trade names, made by Nippon Zeon Co., Ltd.).<br>
The polystyrene matrix preferably has a weight-average molecular weight of 140,000 to 280,000. The polystyrene phase of the rubber modified polystyrene of the present invention is a polymer of styrene or a copolymer of styrene and at least one monomer copolymerizable with styrene in an amount of preferably 10 % by weight or less. Preferable examples of the monomer copolymerizable with styrene include amethylstyrene, p-methylstyrene, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, methyl acrylate, nbutyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, maleic anhydride, maleimide, N-phenylmaleimide, methacrylic acid and mixtures thereof.<br>
The rubber modified polystyrene composition of the present invention may be prepared by any suitable process, and is not limited to any particular method. For example, the rubber modified polystyrene may be prepared by conventional suspension polymerization or bulk polymerization methods, in which polystyrene is<br>
4<br><br>
polymerized in the presence of polybutadiene rubber. Methods for preparing rubber modified polystyrene are described, for example, in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth Edition, Volume 19, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1996) pages 860-862, and references described therein, herein incorporated by reference. Because polystyrene is immiscible with the polybutadiene rubber, during the polymerization, the polybutadiene rubber phase separates from the polystyrene matrix in the form of small particles of polybutadiene rubber suspended in the polystyrene matrix.<br>
In order to regulate the molecular weight or a rate of the polymerization, a molecular weight modifier such as a sulfur compound, or a reaction initiator such as a peroxide (e.g., organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide, cumyl peroxide, etc.), and azo compounds (e.g , azobisisobutyronitrile, etc.) may be added to the reaction mixture.<br>
The rubber modified polystyrene of the present invention may be prepared in the presence of the solvent, for example, for the purpose of reducing the viscosity of the polymerization solution, promoting heat transfer for the removal of polymerization heat, and for allowing proper stirring in order to prevent localized heating. Examples of the suitable solvents include benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene and mixtures thereof.<br>
Conventional rubber modified polystyrenes have a rubber phase with an average volume particle diameter of about 2 to 5 µm. Such conventional rubber modified polystyrenes have little, if any, oil-resistance properties. Accordingly, the<br>
5<br><br>
present inventors have found that it is necessary that the rubber phase should have a particle diameter of 6 urn or more. If the particle diameter is larger than 6 µm, the oil-resistance properties of the rubber modified polystyrene may increase, but if the particle diameter is too large, the impact strength of the rubber modified polystyrene decreases. Accordingly, the average volume particle diameter is preferably 13 urn or less, more preferably in a range of 8 to 11 µn.<br>
The gel content of the rubber modified polystyrene composition of the present invention is preferably 25 to 35 % by weight.<br>
The degree of swelling of the rubber modified polystyrene composition of the present invention is preferably large, but if the degree of swelling is too large, the stiffness and impact resistance of the rubber modified polystyrene decreases. Accordingly, the degree of swelling is preferably 13 to 22, more preferably 14 to 18.<br>
The rubber modified polystyrene composition of the first embodiment may be prepared by polymerizing styrene, or a mixture of styrene and a suitable comonomer, in the presence a polybutadiene rubber dissolved in the styrene, a mixture of the styrene and a solvent or a mixture of the styrene and a suitable comonomer to form a polymerization solution comprising the rubber modified polystyrene of the present invention. The polymerization solution is then first foamed at a pressure reduced to, or below that of the vapor pressure of the polymerization solution at the polymerization temperature, then passed through a tubular heater while maintaining a uniform flow rate distribution. The heated polymerization solution is then flushed into a gas-liquid separator to devolatilize any unreacted monomer and solvent<br>
6<br><br>
therefrom. The pressure in the gas-liquid separator is maintained in the range of 3 to 40 mm Hg and the temperature of the flushed rubber modified polystyrene composition is maintained at a temperature of from 190 to 230°C.<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention is directed to a rubber modified polystyrene composition, as described above, in which polybutadiene rubber particles are dispersed in a polystyrene, and the average volume particle diameter of the polybutadiene rubber particles is in the range of 6 to 13 urn, the gel content is in the range of 25 to 35% by weight, the degree of swelling is in the range of 13 to 22, the residual volatile content is 400 ppm or less, and the total level of dimer and trimer is 4500 ppm or less. The rubber modified polystyrene composition of the second embodiment may be prepared by polymerizing styrene in the presence of polybutadiene rubber, as described above, to form a polymerization solution comprising the rubber modified polystyrene of the present invention, then treating the polymerization solution in an apparatus comprising a pressure adjusting valve, a vertically arranged multitubular heat exchanger type preheater having an ellipsoidal, dished, hemispherical or partially spherical head at an upper position thereof, and a devolatilizing tank directly connected to the multitubular heat exchanger type preheater. The treatment is carried out by introducing the polymerization solution into the head of the multitubular heat exchanger type preheater through the pressure adjusting valve, heating the solution with the multitubular heat exchanger type preheater, thereby foaming the solution, separating a portion of the unreacted monomer and solvent in the devolatilizing tank, discharging a solution containing the<br>
7<br><br>
rubber modified polystyrene of the present invention and 3 to 15 % by weight of the unreacted monomer and the solvent, referred to as the primary treated solution, through the bottom of the devolatilizing tank. The primary treated solution is then subjected to a second treatment in an apparatus comprising a conduit, a vertically arranged multitubular heat exchanger type preheater having an ellipsoidal, dished, hemispherical or partially spherical head at an upper position thereof, and a devolatilizing tank directly connected to the multitubular heat exchanger type preheater. The second treatment is carried out by introducing the primary treated solution into the head of the multitubular heat exchanger type preheater through the conduit, heating the solution by means of the multitubular heat exchanger type preheater, thereby foaming the solution, and then separating substantially the remaining portion of the unreacted monomer and the solvent in the devolatilizing tank. In the first treatment, the temperature of the primary treated solution is maintained at a temperature of 150 to 180°C and the pressure in the devolatilizing tank is maintained at a pressure of 200 to 600 mm Hg. In the second treatment, the temperature of the rubber modified polystyrene composition is maintained at a temperature of 190 to 230°C and the pressure in the devolatilizing tank is maintained at a pressure of 10 mm Hg or less.<br>
A third embodiment of the present invention is directed to a rubber modified polystyrene composition comprising polybutadiene rubber particles dispersed in a polystyrene, where the average volume particle diameter of the polybutadiene rubber particles is in the range of 6 to 13 µn, the gel content is in a range of 25 to 35% by<br>
8<br><br>
weight, the degree of swelling is in the range of 13 to 22, the residual volatile content is 100 ppm or less, and the total amount of dimer and trimer is 1500 ppm or less. The rubber modified polystyrene composition of the third embodiment may be prepared by polymerizing styrene in the presence of polybutadiene rubber dissolved in the styrene, a mixture of the styrene and a solvent or a mixture of the styrene and a suitable comonomer to form a polymerization solution comprising the rubber modified polystyrene of the present invention, then treating the polymerization solution in an apparatus comprising a pressure adjusting valve, a vertically arranged multitubular heat exchanger type preheater having an ellipsoidal, dished, hemispherical or partially spherical head at an upper position thereof, and a devolatilizing tank directly connected to the multitubular heat exchanger type preheater. The first treatment step is carried out by introducing the polymerization solution into the head through the pressure adjusting valve, heating the polymerization solution by means of the multitubular heat exchanger type preheater, thereby foaming the polymerization solution, separating most of the unreacted monomer and the solvent in the devolatilizing tank, then discharging from the devolatilizing tank a solution containing the rubber modified polystyrene of the present invention and 2 % by weight or less of unreacted monomer and the solvent, referred to as a primary treated solution, through the bottom of the devolatilizing tank. In a second treatment step, the primary treated solution is treated in an apparatus comprising a nozzle device for adding foaming agent, a static mixer, an extruding apparatus and a devolatilizing tank. The second treatment step is carried out by adding, through the nozzle device, a foaming agent<br>
9<br><br>
into the primary treated solution in a direction opposite to the flow direction of the primarily treated solution, introducing the solution into a static mixer at a temperature higher than the vaporization temperature of the foaming agent under atmospheric pressure and lower than the decomposition temperature of the primary treated solution and under a pressure sufficient to prevent the primary treated solution from foaming, mixing the primary treated solution containing the foaming agent in the static mixer while maintaining a pressure higher than the vapor pressure of the foaming agent, introducing the mixture resulting from the static mixer into the devolatilizing tank through an extruding apparatus having at least one opening section provided vertically and downward, forming the mixture into a foamed product at such a temperature and a pressure that a foaming coefficient B in the following equation (1) is 1.4 or more, whereby the unreacted monomer and the solvent are devolatilized together with the release of a foaming agent, and then separating the unreacted monomer, the solvent and the foaming agent in the devolatilizing tank. In the first treatment step, the temperature of the primary treated solution is in the range of 180 to 220X, the pressure in the devolving tank is in the range of 3 to 120 mm Hg, and the foaming agent composes 0.5 to 3 % by weight of water added to the primary treated solution. In the second treatment step, the pressure in the devolatilizing tank is in the range of 10 to 20 mm Hg, and the temperature of the rubber modified<br>
polystyrene composition is in the range of 190 to 230°C In the second treatment<br>
step, the coefficient B is defined by equation (1):<br>
B = A1/A        (1)<br>
10<br><br>
wherein A is the cross-sectional area of the opening of the extruding apparatus, and A' is the average cross-sectional area of the foamed polymer composition in a direction perpendicular to a vertical direction at a position 50 cm to 1 m, in a vertical direction, below the opening.<br>
The devolatilization techniques described in Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 29797/1973 and 827/1994, and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 166014/1999, each of which is herein incorporated by reference, may be used in the above described first, second and third aspects of the invention, respectively.<br>
In the above-described first, second and third embodiments of the present invention, the residual volatile content of the rubber modified polystyrene compositions are 2000 ppm or less, 400 ppm or less and 100 ppm or less, respectively, and the total amount of dimer and trimer are 8000 ppm or less, 4500 ppm or less and 1500 ppm or less, respectively.<br>
The invention will described more in detail referring to the following examples and comparative examples.<br>
The average volume particle diameter of the polybutadiene rubber phase of the rubber modified polystyrene composition according to the present invention was measured by a laser analysis type particle-size distribution measuring device.<br>
The gel content was measured as follows:  1 g of the rubber modified polystyrene composition was dissolved in 30 ml of a 20/3 methyl ethyl ketone/methanol solution, followed by centrifugal separation of the undissolved material from the dissolved material, The undissolved material was vacuum-dried,<br>
11<br><br>
and then weighed to measure the gel weight, G (units of grams). The gel content was calculated as follows: gel content - G/l x 100 (%).<br>
The degree of swelling was measured as follow. 0.4 g of the rubber modified polystyrene composition was mixed with 20 ml of toluene, followed by centrifugal separation of the undissolved material from the dissolved material. The resultant supernatant liquid containing the dissolved material was decanted, and the weight TG (units of grams) of the remaining gel was then measured. Next, this gel was vacuumdried, and a weight DG (units of grams) of the dried gel was then measured. The degree of swelling was calculated as the ratio TG/DG.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the oil-resistance properties were measured as<br>
follows: First, the rubber modified polystyrene composition was molded into a test<br>
piece having a width of 50 mm, a length of 150 mm and a thickness of 1.3 mm. This<br>
test piece was then attached to a 1/4 ellipsoidal jig with a scale (i.e., Fig. 1). Oil was<br>
applied on the test piece, and after 24 hours, the smallest graduation (n) at the<br>
position where crazing or cracking occurred on the test piece was recorded. The<br>
critical strain (e) was calculated in accordance with the following equation:<br><br>
wherein<br>
a is the length of the long axis (150 mm) of the 1/4 ellipsoidal jig, b is the" length of the short axis (45 mm) of the 1/4 ellipsoidal jig, and<br>
12<br><br>
t is the thickness (1.3 mm) of the test piece.<br>
The graduation (n), is determined by the equation n=(90-?)/5, where X = acos 6 and Y = bsin0 and angle 9 is an eccentric angle, and the X axis is the long axis of the ellipse, and the Y axis is the short axis of the ellipse.<br>
Thus, as the value of e increase, the oil resistance properties of the rubber modified polystyrene composition increase. The evaluation of the results was ranked as follows:<br>
A critical strain of 0.47 or more is indicated by the symbol: O A critical strain of 0 19 to 0.47 is indicated by the symbol; ? A critical strain of 0.19 or less is indicated by the symbol: x<br>
