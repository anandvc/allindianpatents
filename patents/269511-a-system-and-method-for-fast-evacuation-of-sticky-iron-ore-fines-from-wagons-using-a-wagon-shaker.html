FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method for fast evacuation of sticky iron ore fines from wagons on to track hoppers using a wagon shaker. In particular, it relates to evacuation of sticky iron ore fines from wagons on to track-hopper of a sintering plant.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Iron ore fines are loaded in BOBS type or BOBRN type (hopper-type) wagons. These wagons are designed such, that unloading can be done by free fall of material through the side-door openings. These wagons are loaded at the mines through weigh feeder in different combinations of 45 to 50 wagons in a rake and unloaded manually in track-hopper with the help of permanent manpower. Annually about 600 rakes are unloaded at track hopper. During the unloading of rake of blended fines most of the times sticky wagons arrive at the track-hopper. These take too much time for unloading depending upon the stickiness of the material and its retention time in the wagons.<br><br>
-3-<br>
There are two types of blended iron ore fines, blue dust and classifier fines. The stickiness of blended-fines increases if percentage of material composition differs or moisture content increases, particularly in rainy season.<br>
Iron ore fines are loaded in mines in BOBS type (hopper-type) wagons and unloaded in track-hopper with help of permanent manpower. Sticky wagons require more time to unload with extra manpower. The delay In unloading results in increased railway demurrage for delaying the return of wagons by more than 8 hours. If unloading can be completed during the free time available some credit can also be allowed.<br>
In order to effect faster unloading of iron ore fines from the wagons, one possible solution is manually poking the material from the top and / or sides of the wagon. Sometime for sticky material the method may not be effective. Hammering of the wagon sides using a monkey bar may be adopted. Release of material by a pneumatic vibrator may also be tried. However, none of these methods are really effective in evacuating very sticky material from the wagons.<br><br>
-4-<br>
A need therefore, exists for using a method of faster evacuation of sticky iron ore from the wagons.<br>
50 to 52 wagons are coming In a rake can be unloaded in the present invention in track-hopper with the help of less permanent man-power. Annually about 600 rakes are unloaded at track hopper. During the unloading of rake of blended fines most of the times sticky wagons arrived in track-hopper. These will take too much time depending on the stickiness of the material and retention time in the wagons.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a method for faster evacuation of sticky material from a wagon.<br>
Another object of the invention is to reduce the demurrage charges payable to the railways for longer retention of the wagons for unloading purpose.<br><br>
-5-<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to reduce the manpower requirement for unloading sticky material from wagons.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention are achieved by using a wagon shaker and a winch drive for faster unloading of sticky iron ore from wagons.<br>
Thus In a preferred embodiment the Invention provides a system for fast evacuation of sticky iron ore fines from wagons onto track hoppers, said system comprising: a wagon shaker assembly parked at a predetermined height and having an unbalanced mass movable In a vibratory mode; an electric winch drive for lowering said wagon shaker assembly and for placing onto the top of the wagon, or for lifting said wagon shaker assembly to its parking station; and a drive arrangement for moving said unbalanced mass in a vibratory mode when said wagon shaker assembly is placed on the wagon; thereby loosening and releasing the sticky material from the wagon for unloading through its doors.<br><br>
-6-<br>
The invention also provides a method for fast evacuation of sticky iron ore fines from wagons onto a track hopper, comprising the steps of: placing a wagon with sticky iron ore fines below a wagon shaker assembly parked at a predetermined height; unlocking safety chains and lowering the wagon shaker assembly slowly using an electric winch and placing it on said wagon; opening doors of said wagon; and starting a drive arrangement of the wagon shaker assembly for creating vibrations in said wagon; thereby evacuating sticky iron ore fines from the wagons through its open doors.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The existing methods used for trying to release the sticky iron ore from the wagons are illustrated in Figures 2a, 2b, 3 and 4. Figures 5a and 5b show the wagon shaker arrangement of the present invention. This is especially suitable for unloading wagons particularly of BOBS, BOBSN AND BOBRN types.<br><br>
-9-<br>
As shown in Figures 5 (b) through 9 a wagon shaker assembly 1 consists of a body comprising an unbalanced mass 2 movable with the help of a drive arrangement having a drive motor and a V-belt pulley arrangement 3. When the wagon shaker assembly sits properly on the wagon body 4 and the unbalanced mass 2 is moved by the drive arrangement 3 high vibration in the wagon is created as shown in Figure 5 with the help of arrows. This high vibration will loosen the sticky material which gels released easily from the wagon 4. The wagon shaker drive 3 is operated using push button switches and the movement is controlled with the help of limit switches (not shown).<br>
The wagon shaker assembly 1 is parked at a safe height from the wagon 4 so that It does not obstruct the movement of the loco or wagons underneath. The wagon shaker is anchored with the help of two ropes mining over pulleys P1 and P2 as shown in Figure 6. The ropes running over a twin sheave assembly 5 and are attached to a counter weight 6 for easy movement of the shaker assembly with the help of an electrically driven winch of an electrically driven winch drive 7. When not In operation, the wagon shaker assembly is parked at its station using a safety lock and safety chains 8.<br><br>
-10-<br>
The wagons containing sticky materials is placed under the wagon shaker assembly 1. The safety locks for the safety chains 8 are removed and the wagon shaker assembly 1 is placed over the wagon top with the help of the winch drive 7 and wire rope arrangement. When the wagon shaker assembly sits properly on the wagon body the wagon shaker can be started using electric push buttons and limit switches. Vibrations are created in the wagon by moving the unbalanced mass 2 with the help of the drive arrangement 3 for loosening and releasing the sticky materials from the wagons.<br>
The shaker equipment uses a 15 KW motor and has a running period of 5 min / wagon.<br>
The winch drive has a 5.5 KW motor with a running period of 3 min / wagon.<br>
Total cost of energy consumed for the equipment is about Rs. 3.80 per wagon.<br><br>
-11-<br>
The average unloading time for a wagon in the existing system and the system of the present invention can be shown as in Figures 6a and 6b respectively.<br>
The tangible  benefits derived  by  using  a wagon  shaker arrangement for unloading about 600 rakes a year can be as high as a saving of Rs. 60, 00, 000/-<br>
The Intangible benefits are:<br>
•	Reduced turn-around time of rake which increases train availability i.e. increased availability of National Recourses.<br>
•	Provide safe working condition.<br>
•	Utilization of manpower in other area.<br>
•	Moral boost-up.<br>
•	Team work and trust building.<br><br>
-12-<br>
For safe operation of the wagon shaker of the present invention, care should be taken to see that before placement of wagon the shaker is in a parked position. It should be ensured that safety chains are properly fastened. There should be proper communication between the driver and Foreman (T/H) during placement of wagon.<br>
The loco speed should be less than 15 KMPH. After opening the safety chains the wagon shaker is to be lowered down slowly (inching drive) and placed on the wagon.<br>
It should be ensured that all the signal lights should be red and visual and the hooter should be blowing when the wagon shaker is lowered down.<br>
It should also be ensured that the slings are not in tension so as to avoid jerk on the winch.<br><br>
-13-<br>
The doors of the wagons should be opened and then the shaker should be started.<br>
The shaker should then be stopped and lifted up slowly till the limits switch operates. Ensure that the slings are in its sheaves and all the signal lights are green and the hooter stops blowing.<br>
The shaker should then be tied by safety chain again. The power should be switched off using a local switch and the door of the panel locked with operating switch.<br><br>
