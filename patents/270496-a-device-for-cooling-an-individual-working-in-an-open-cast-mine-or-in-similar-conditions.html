				<td>This invention relates to a device for cooling an individual working in an open cast mine or in similar conditions. This invention particularly relates to a device for cooling an individual who is exposed to high temperature and dry hot summer during working in open cast mines or in similar conditions.<br>
During the hot summer months in the coal belt in India, the persons working, such as miners, supervisors, in open cast mines are exposed to very high temperature, sometimes exceeding 45 Â°C, and very dry weather having humidity even less than 10%. Working in such extreme environmental conditions often seriously affect the efficiency of the workers and also exposes them to the risk of heat stroke and dehydration due to constant exposure to the harsh sun. Under such circumstances there is a need for a portable personnel cooling system. The device of the present invention for cooling an individual working in an open cast mine or in similar conditions will help alleviate this problem and can be comfortably worn and carried by an individual working under such conditions.<br>
Devices, mainly air-conditioner and air cooler of various capacities, capable of cooling a building, a factory, a room, in short an enclosed space are available. Further, different designs of protective dresses like jackets, apron are available to keep an individual safe for a short period from external source of heat.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. patent no. 6,584,798, titled: Individual cooling system, which comprises: (a) a garment; (b) a container containing a block of material liberating an amount of cooling energy by phase change; (c) a pump P. The invention characterized in that it comprises means enabling the continuous operation of the assembly without solidification of the heating medium, even if the solidification temperature of the heating medium is higher than the temperature of the block of material releasing the cooling energy by phase change.<br><br>
In recent times some devices have been developed for cooling the neck, forehead, head and back of a person by using evaporation of water by gust of wind produced by an air mover.<br>
Reference may be made to the United States Patent No. 5,217,408, titled: A personal portable evaporative cooling device, comprising a cowling fitted to a person's back and spaced from said back to form a plenum into which ambient air is forced by an electric motor powered fan located in an opening in the cowling said opening located near the center of the cowling. The air exhausts through a gap between the periphery of the cowling and a person's back. The cowling is supported on said back by a harness. Electric power to the electric motor is provided by batteries carried on a waist band. Moisture is provided by perspiration.<br>
Reference may be drawn to the United States Patent No. 5,802,865, titled: Evaporative personal cooler. This consists of a self-contained evaporative personal cooling device which has an articulated C-shaped housing that fits conformally around a user's neck or forehead. The housing retains and urges at least one heat dissipating plate conformably against the user's neck or forehead. A sponge material within the housing contacts upper and/or lower portions of the metal plates but is spaced-apart from the plate to form a plenum. In use, the sponge material is saturated with water introduced through slots in the housing. A DC powered fan within the device draws air into the housing and circulates the air within the plenum and out through exit openings in the sponge material and housing. Moisture from the sponge material wets the plenum-facing surface of the metal plates, which surface preferably has been treated with a wicking material. Fan-circulated air promotes evaporation and heat is withdrawn by the plates from the user's neck or forehead, thus cooling the user.<br>
Another reference may be drawn to the United States patent no. 6,189,327, titled: Evaporative personal cooler. The self-contained evaporative personal<br><br>
cooling device fits conformally around a user's neck or other body portion. The device includes at least one heat dissipating member that is urged conformably against the body portion to absorb heat therefrom. The device-facing side of this member preferably has a large surface area with a liquid-wickable surface. A liquid-retainable material contacts at least a portion of the wickable surface area and also defines at least one air plenum. Ambient air is moved along the plenum, preferably by a battery-powered fan. The air transfers heat from the member, cooling the user, and is exhausted from the device. A thermostat can sense temperature at the heat dissipating member to control duty cycle of the fan to prevent overcooling the user.<br>
Yet another reference may be made to the United States patent no. 6,543,247, titled: Waist-mounted evaporative personal cooler, is described a waist-mounted evaporative personal cooling device designed to cool the back of a user. This comprises a blower, a liquid reservoir, a means to deliver liquid from the reservoir a mist of droplets into blower-forced air or directly onto the skin area to which the forced air will be directed, and a duct to guide forced air under the user's shirt or blouse and directly onto or across the skin of the user's back. The device improves on prior art coolers by delivering a powerful evaporative cooling effect directly to a user's back, while being compact, comfortably wearable, and requiring the user to do little or nothing to get its benefit.<br>
Still another reference may be drawn to patent no. US2002170309, titled: Waist-mounted evaporative personal cooler, wherein is described a waist-mounted evaporative personal cooling device designed to cool the back of a user, comprises a blower (25), a liquid reservoir (29), a means to deliver liquid from the reservoir a mist of droplets into blower-forced air (33) or directly onto the skin area to which the forced air will be directed (45), and a duct (27) to guide forced air under the user's shirt or blouse and directly onto or across the skin of the user's back. The device improves on prior art coolers by delivering a powerful<br><br>
evaporative cooling effect directly to a user's back, while being compact, comfortably wearable, and requiring the user to do little or nothing to get its benefit.<br>
The major disadvantages of the devices as disclosed in the hitherto known prior art as detailed above are that they either use water mist produced by forcing water through thin nozzles or a wet mat placed in direct contact with forehead, neck or back of the user. Wet mat will cause inconvenience and would be uncomfortable to the user. Further, thin nozzles in the devices using mist are likely to get clogged due to dirt present in water and other causes, and therefore would cause interruption in operation of the device.<br>
From the above details of the hitherto known prior art, it is seen that there is a definite need for providing a portable personnel cooling system such as a device for cooling an individual working in an open cast mine or in similar conditions.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a device for cooling an individual working in an open cast mine or in similar conditions, which obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art.<br>

The novelty of the device of the present invention resides in a portable personnel cooling system which can be effectively used for cooling an individual working in an open cast mine or in similar conditions, wherein the device is based on cooling of air partially by conduction and mainly through water evaporation and distribution of this cool air on different parts of the body including face and crown of head such that an individual can be, comfortable and work safely for long hours even in the hottest summer days in open cast mines.<br><br>
The novelty of the device of the present invention has been realized by the non-obvious inventive steps comprising constructional features of providing in combination a rechargeable battery-powered air pump to draw and supply cool air through a distributor to a network of thin flexible pipes to the areas of the user's body which need to be cooled. Wherein the cool air drawn is through a water trap connected by a pipe to the top opening of a container having an air-inlet and air-outlet at the bottom and top, respectively. The said container having a plurality of air-pervious and water absorbent mats of material such as khus strands, silica gel, charcoal placed at a regular spacing on horizontally mounted perforated trays. The container having a water reservoir connected to a rechargeable battery-powered water-pump which pumps water to a water spray above the air-pervious and water-absorbent mats for bringing about cooling of the air by conduction and evaporation.<br>
The principle of operation of the a device of the present invention for cooling an individual working in an open cast mine or in similar conditions, which can be used as a portable personal cooling system, is that of cooling of air partially through conduction and mainly due to evaporation of water as a result of the dry conditions due to very low humidity of the surrounding atmosphere. Dry and hot air from the atmosphere enters the system through the bottom of the container and flows up through the air-pervious and water-absorbent mats kept continuously wet by dripping water from the water spray which is supplied with water from the water reservoir by a rechargeable battery-powered water pump. The air in the process of passing through the wet mats gets cooled due to conduction and evaporation of water. This cooled air is sucked by a rechargeable battery-powered air pump and directed through an air distributor and by means of a network of thin flexible tubes to different portions of a user's body. Condensed moisture is removed from the air stream by a water trap. The heat generated by the body as well as that received from atmosphere is thus removed by fresh and cool air, which ultimately gets discharged to the atmosphere. The body is kept cool and well ventilated. Individual elements of the<br><br>
system may be fixed to a small light casing and either hung from the back of a person or attached to his waist.<br>
