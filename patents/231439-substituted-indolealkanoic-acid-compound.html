				<td>"SUBSTITUTED INDOLEALKANOIC ACIDS COMPOUND"<br>
Background of Invention:<br>
The use of aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) for the<br>
treatment of diabetic complications is well known. The<br>
complications arise from elevated levels of glucose in tissues<br>
such as the nerve, kidney, retina and lens that enters the<br>
polyol pathway and is converted to sorbitol via aldose<br>
reductase. Because sorbitol does not easily cross cell<br>
membranes, it accumulates inside certain cells resulting in<br>
changes in osmotic pressure, alterations in the redox state of<br>
pyridine nucleotides (i.e. increased NADH/NAD+ ratio) and<br>
depleted intracellular levels of myoinositol. These<br>
biochemical changes, which have been linked to diabetic<br>
complications, can be controlled by inhibitors of aldose<br>
reductase.<br>
The use of aldose reductase inhibitors for the treatment<br>
of diabetic complications has been extensively reviewed, see:<br>

Previously described aldose reductase inhibitors most<br>
closely related to the present invention include those sighted<br>
in: (a) U.S Pat. No. 5,700,819: 2-Substituted benzothiazole<br>
derivatives useful in the treatment of diabetic complications,<br>
(b) U.S Pat. No. 4,868,301: Processes and intermediates for the<br>
preparation of oxophthalazinyl acetic acids having<br><br><br>
benzothiazole or other heterocyclic side chains, (c) U.S Pat.<br>
No. 5,330,997; 1H-indazole-3-acetic acids as aldose reductase<br>
inhibitors, and (d) U.S Pat. No. 5,236,945; 1H-indazole-3-<br>
acetic acids as aldose reductase inhibitors. Although many<br>
aldose reductase inhibitors have been extensively developed,<br>
none have demonstrated sufficient efficacy in human clinical<br>
trials without significant undesirable side effects. Thus no<br>
aldose reductase inhibitors are currently available as approved<br>
therapeutic agents in the United States; and consequently,<br>
there is still a significant need for new, efficacious and safe -<br>
medications for the treatment of diabetic complications.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
This invention provides compounds that interact with and<br>
inhibit aldose reductase.	Thus, in a broad aspect, the<br>
invention provides compounds of Formula I:<br><br>
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein<br>

alkyl or mono- or disubstituted with halogen, preferably<br>
fluoro or chloro;<br>
Z is a bond, 0, S, C(O)NH, or C1-C3 alkylene optionally<br>
substituted with C1-C2 alkyl;<br>
R1 is hydrogen, alkyl having 1-6 carbon atoms, halogen, 2-, 3-,<br>
or 4-pyridyl, or phenyl, where the phenyl or pyridyl is<br>
optionally substituted with up to three groups selected<br>
from halogen, hydroxy, C1-C6 alkoxy, C1-C6 alkyl, nitro,<br>
amino, or mono- or di (C1-C6) alkylamino;<br>
R2, R3, R4 and R5 are each independently<br>
hydrogen, halogen, nitro, or an alkyl group of 1-6 carbon<br>
atoms (which may be substituted with one or more<br>
halogens);<br><br>
OR,, SR7, S(O)R7, S(O)2(R7)2, C(O)N(R7)2, or N(R7)2, wherein<br>
each R7 is independently hydrogen, an alkyl group of 1-<br>
6 carbon atoms (which may be substituted with one or<br>
more halogens) or benzyl, where the phenyl portion is<br>
optionally substituted with up to three groups<br>
independently selected from halogen, C1-C4 alkyl, C2-C6<br>
alkoxy, amino, and mono- or di (C1-C6) alkylamino; phenyl<br>
or heteroaryl such as 2-, 3- or 4-imidazolyl or 2-, 3-,<br>
or 4-pyridyl, each of which phenyl or heteroaryl is<br>
optionally substituted with up to three groups -<br>
independently selected from halogen, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6<br>
alkoxy, amino, and mono- or di (C1-C6) alkylamino;<br>
phenoxy where the phenyl portion is optionally substituted<br>
with up to three groups independently selected from<br>
halogen, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, amino, and mono- or<br>

substituted with up to five groups.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides methods for<br>
preparing such compounds.<br>
The compounds of the invention inhibit aldose reductase.<br>
Since aldose reductase is critical to the production of high<br>
levels of sorbitol in individuals with diabetes, inhibitors of<br>
aldose reductase are useful in preventing and/or treating<br>
various complications associated with diabetes. The compounds<br>
of the invention are therefore effective for the treatment of<br>
diabetic complications as a result of their ability to inhibit<br>
aldose reductase.<br>
Thus, in another aspect, the invention provides methods<br>
for treating and/or preventing chronic complications associated<br>
with diabetes mellitus, including, for example, diabetic<br>
cataracts, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.<br>

prodrug grops include 0+M++ where M++ is a divalent cation such<br>
as magnesium or calcium.<br>
In certain situations, compounds of Formula I may contain -<br>
one or more asymmetric carbon atoms, so that the compounds can<br>
exist in different stereoisomeric forms. These compounds can<br>
be, for example, racemates or optically active forms. In these<br>
situations, the single enantiomers, i.e., optically active<br>
forms, can be obtained by asymmetric synthesis or by resolution<br>
of the racemates. Resolution of the racemates can be<br>
accomplished, for example, by conventional methods such as<br>
crystallization in the presence of a resolving agent, or<br>
chromatography, using, for example a chiral HPLC column.<br>
Representative compounds of the present invention include<br>
the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of<br>
compounds where R6 includes basic nitrogen atom, i.e, an<br>
alkylamino or morpholino group. In addition, if the compound<br>
or prodrug of the invention is obtained as an acid addition<br>
salt, the free base can be obtained by basifying a solution of<br><br><br>
the acid salt. Conversely, if the product is a free base, an<br>
addition salt, particularly a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
addition salt, may be produced by dissolving the free base in a<br>
suitable organic solvent and treating the solution with an<br>
acid, in accordance with conventional procedures for preparing<br>
acid addition salts from base compounds.<br>

pharmaceutical base addition salts include salts of bases such<br>
as sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, and the like. Those<br>

the other 3 (homopiperazinyl), or J is CH2 and each r is 2<br>
(piperidinyl) or one r is 2 and the other 3 (homopiperidinyl).<br><br>

The above compounds, further described in the Examples and -<br>
other description of the invention below, are illustrative but<br>
are not meant to limit in any way the scope of the contemplated<br>
compounds according to the present invention.<br>
The compounds of general Formula I may be administered<br>
orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation or spray or<br>
rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional<br>
non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and<br>
vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes<br>
subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular,<br>
intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. In addition,<br>
there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a<br>
compound of general Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier. One or more compounds of general Formula I may be<br>
present in association with one or more non-toxic<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents and/or<br><br><br>
adjuvants and if desired other active ingredients. The<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of general<br>
Formula I may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example,<br>
as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions,<br>
dispersible powders or granules, emulsion, hard or soft<br>
capsules, or syrups or elixirs.<br>
Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared<br>
according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain<br>
one or more agents selected from the group consisting of<br>
sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and<br>
preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant<br>
and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active<br>
ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of<br>
tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents,<br>
such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium<br>
phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating<br>
agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding<br>
agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating<br>
agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.<br>
The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known<br>
techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action<br>
over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such<br><br>
as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be<br>
employed.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard<br>
gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an<br>
inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium<br>
phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the<br>
active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for<br>
example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in<br>
admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of<br>
aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents,<br>
for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose,<br>
hydropropylmethylcellulose,	sodium alginate,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing<br>
or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for<br>
example, lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene<br>
oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate,<br>
or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain<br>
aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or<br>
condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters<br>
derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide<br>
with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol<br>
anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The<br>
aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives,<br><br>
for example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more<br>
coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more<br>
sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the<br>
active ingredients in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil,<br>
olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such<br>
as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a<br>
thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl<br>
alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and<br>
flavoring agents may be added to provide palatable oral -<br>
preparations. These compositions may be preserved by the<br>
addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation<br>
of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the<br>
active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting<br>
agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives.<br>
Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are<br>
exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional<br>
excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring<br>
agents, may also be present.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be<br>
in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a<br>
vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a<br>
mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these.<br>
Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums,<br><br>
for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring<br>
phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or<br>
partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol,<br>
anhydrides, for example sorbitan monoleate, and condensation<br>
products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for<br>
example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoleate. The emulsions may<br>
also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening<br>
agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or<br>
sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a<br>
preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The,<br>
pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile<br>
injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension<br>
may be formulated according to the known art using those<br>
suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents<br>
which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable<br>
preparation may also be sterile injectable solution or<br>
suspension in a non-toxic parentally acceptable diluent or<br>
solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among<br>
the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are<br>
water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.<br>
In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as<br>
a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland<br>
fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono-or<br><br>
diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find<br>
use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The compounds of general Formula I may also be<br>
administered in the form of suppositories for rectal<br>
administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared<br>
by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient<br>
which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the<br>
rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to<br>
release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and<br>
polyethylene glycols.<br>
Compounds of general Formula I may be administered<br>
parenterally in a sterile medium. The drug, depending on the<br>
vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or<br>
dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as<br>
local anesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can be<br>
dissolved in the vehicle.<br>
Dosage levels on the order of from about 0.1 mg to about<br>
140 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the<br>
treatment of the above-indicated conditions (about 0.5 mg to<br>
about 7 g per patient per day). The amount of active<br>
ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to<br>
produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host<br>
treated and the particular mode of administration. Dosage unit<br>
forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about<br>
1000 mg of an active ingredient.<br><br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose<br>
level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of<br>
factors including the activity of the specific compound<br>
employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time<br>
of administration, route of administration, and rate of<br>
excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular<br>
disease undergoing therapy.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by<br>
use of known chemical reactions and procedures. General<br>
methods for synthesizing the compounds are presented below. It<br>
is understood that the nature of the substituents required for<br>
the desired target compound often determines the preferred<br>
method of synthesis. All variable groups of these methods are<br>
as described in the generic description if they are not<br>
specifically defined below. More detailed procedures for<br>
particular examples are presented below in the experimental<br>
section.<br>
Methods of Preparation<br>
The compounds of the invention where Ar is benzothiazolyl<br>
can be conveniently prepared from a substituted indole moiety<br>
using general Scheme A set forth below.<br><br><br>
Treatment of a nitrile indole IV with a strong base such<br>
as, for example, sodium hydride, butyl lithium or sodium tert-<br>
butoxide, in a polar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile,<br>
tetrahydrofuran or N,N-dimethylformamide followed by an<br>
treatment with an alkylating agent, e.g., ethyl or tert-butyl<br>
bromoacetate, provides the desired N-alkylated product V.<br>
Alternativly, phase transfer catalysis can be used in a<br>
biphasic solvent system. A general review of such alkylations<br>
can be found in Sundberg, R. J. Indoles; Chapter 11, Academic<br>
Press Inc., San Diego, CA, 1996. Condensation with a suitable<br>
2-amino thiophenol hydrochloride salt VI provides<br><br>
benzothiazole intermediate VII. These reactions are most often<br>
carried out in an alcohol solvents at elevated temperatures;<br>
however, other solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide and N-<br>
methylpyrrolidone can be used or the reactions can be carried<br>
out in the absence of solvents altogether. The scope of the<br>
reaction conditions useful for this transformation have been<br>
described previously (U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,819). General<br>
methods for the preparation of various substituted 2-amino<br>
thiophenols are also well known (J. Med. Chem. 1991, 34, 108<br>
and Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1994, 42, 1264). In general, the best<br>
method of synthesis is determined by such factors as<br>
availability of starting materials and ease of synthesis.<br>
Deprotection of the alkanoic acid moiety VII can be carried out<br>
by methods common to those skilled in the art to result in<br>
compounds of Formula III. The method used in the deprotection<br>
depends on the type of protecting group. A description of such<br>
protecting groups and methods for deprotecting them may be<br>
found in: Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second<br>
Edition, T. W. Green and P. G. M. Wuts, John Wiley and Sons,<br>
Ney York, 1991. When a methyl or ethyl ester is used, an<br>
aqueous sodium hydroxide solution in ethanol or dimethoxyethane<br>
is conveniently employed for its removal.<br>
If not commercially available, nitrile IV can be prepared<br>
substantially as described below in Scheme B depicting the<br>
formation of 3-acetonitrile substituted indoles of Formula IV<br><br>
where Z is a bond. Thus, an indole moiety in a weak acid<br>
solution, for example, acetic acid in ethanol, is treated with<br>
aqueous formaldehyde and dimethyl amine in an alcohol solvent.<br>
The 3- (dimethylamino) methyl indole product can then be treated<br>
with sodium or potassium cyanide in N,N-dimethylformamide at<br>
elevated temperatures to provide the 3-acetonitrile substituted<br>
indole intermediate. Alternatively, an iminium salt like N,N-<br>
dimethylmethyleneammonium chloride can be used to prepare the<br>
3-(dimethylamino)methyl indole intermediate.<br><br>
The 3-(dimethylamino) methyl indole intermediate can also<br>
be converted to the the 3-acetonitrile substituted indole<br>
intermediate via the trimethyl ammonium salt. The salt can be<br>
prepared by treating the gramine intermediate with an<br><br>
alkalating agent like methyl iodide. The trimethyl ammonium<br>
salt intermediate can then be converted to the nitrile by<br>
treatment with sodium or potassium cyanide in a solvent like<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide. In general, the conversion to the<br>
acetonitrile occurs under more mild conditions when the<br>
trimethyl ammonium salt is used.<br>
Alternatively, other compounds, such as those where Z-Ar<br>
represents a wide variety of substituted hetercycles, may be<br>
prepared using the general method outlined in Scheme C. Here,<br>
substituted indole intermediates where X is an activating group -<br>
like hydroxyl, halogen, dialkyl amino, trialkyl ammonium or<br>
benzotriazole are coupled with Q-Z-Ar groups using methods<br>
well-established in indole chemistry. Examples of these<br>
methods where Q is Na or H and Z is sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen<br>
carbon or a bond are described in (A) Tidwell, J.H.; Peat,<br>
A.J.; Buchwald, S.L. J. Org. Chem. 1994, 59, 7164; (B) Bruneau,<br>

It is understood that, depending on the specific chemistry<br>
used, a protecting group, P, may be required. In general, p<br>
represents groups such as acyloxy, alkyl, sulfonyl or A-COOR.<br>
The use of these general methods is illustrated in Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second Edition, T. W. Green and P.<br>
G. M. Wuts, John Wiley and Sons, Ney York, 1991.<br><br>
In general, the intermediate compounds wherein R2-6 is aryl<br>
or heteroaryl can be synthesized by the chemistry illustrated<br>
in reaction Scheme D below. For example, treatment of the<br>
potassium salt of an optionally substituted bromoindole with<br>
tert-butyllithium at low temperature in an ethereal solvent<br>
such as ether or tetrahydrofuran followed by the addition of an<br>
electrophile represents a general method for obtaining<br>
substituted indoles, as described by Rapoport, H. (J. Org.<br>
Chem. 1986, 51, 5106). For a discussion of a synthesis where R<br>
is acyl, see Biorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999, 9, 333; where R is,<br>
thiomethyl, see Heterocycles, 1992, 34, 1169; and where R is<br>
cycloalkyl, see J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 526.<br><br><br>
More specifically the addition of a trialkyl borate<br>
followed by an acidic work-up provides the desired indole<br>
boronic acids (Heterocycles, 1992, 34, 1169). Indole boronic<br>
acids can be used in well established transition metal<br>
catalyzed coupling reactions like the Suzuki reaction to<br>
provide aryl and heteroaryl indoles. These reactions are most<br>
often carried out in a mixture of ethereal or alcohol solvents<br>
with aqueous base in the presence of palladium catalyst, such<br>
as Pd(OAc)2, Pd(OAc)2 w/ PPh3 or Pd(PPh3)4 as described in<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 4467, J. Org. Chem. 1999, 64, 1372<br>
and Heterocycles 1992, 34, 1395.<br>
Alternatively, an optionally substituted bromoindole can<br>
be treated with an arylboronic acid and a palladium catalyst<br>
to provide arylindoles in large quantities (Synlett 1994, 93).<br>
A general review of Suzuki cross-couplings between boronic<br>
acids and aryl halides can be found in Miyaura, N; Suzuki, A.<br>
Chem. Rev. 1995, 95, 2457.<br><br><br>
For example, treatment of the advanced intermediate indole<br>
X with an aryl or heteroaryl boronic acid using Pd-mediated<br>
coupling conditions provides the desired aryl and heteroaryl<br>
indole product XI as shown in scheme (E). In general the<br>
utility of this method is determined by the ease of synthesis<br>
of advanced intermediates of type X and the commercial<br>
availability of aryl and heteroaryl boronic acids.<br><br>
In addition, certain organometallic reactions eliminate<br>
the need for de novo construction of the indole nucleus. For<br>
example, the Stille reaction serves as a general method for the<br>
synthesis of regiocontrolled substitution of indole<br>
intermediates as described by Farina, V.; Krishnamurthy, V;<br>
Scott, W., Organic Reactions, 1998, 50, 1-652. As indicated in<br>
the scheme below, the indole may serve as the organotin species<br>
or the aryl halide. The stannylindole (XII), where P is a<br>
suitable protecting group such as [2-(trimethyl)ethoxy]methyl<br>
(SEM) or an alkyl substituent, is treated with a variety of<br>
partners (i.e., vinyl/allylic halides, vinyl triflates,<br>
aryl/heteroaryl halides and acyl halides) in the presence of a<br><br><br>
Pd(O)Ln catalyst to provide the desired indoles (XII) (<br>
Synnlett 1993, 771, Helv. Chim. Acta 1993, 76, 2356 and J. Org.<br>
Chem. 1994, 59, 4250). Conversely, a haloindole (XIV) is<br>
treated with a variety of tin reagents under Stille conditions<br>
to provide the desired substituted indoles (XV) as described in<br>
Heterocycles 1988, 27, 1585 and Synth. Comm 1992, 22, 1627).<br><br>
A general procedure for the synthesis of intermediate<br>
compounds using amines of the formula NRxRx2 (NR1R2 in the scheme<br>
below) is given in scheme F below. In Scheme F, Rx and Rx2 are<br>
the same or different and represent hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl, or Rx<br>
and Rx2 together represent a group of the formula:<br><br>
where J and each r is as defined above for formula I.<br>
As shown in Scheme F, nucleophilic substitution of X (X is<br>
halogen, preferably fluorine) in an aromatic system is a method<br><br><br>
often used to substitute aromatic rings with amine and ether<br>
functionalities. Both 4- and 5- fluoro-2-nitrotoluene are<br>
sufficiently activated to undergo substitution with amines in<br>
the presence of K2CO3 in a polar aprotic solvent such as, for<br>
example, DMSO as described in J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 2716.<br>
The Leimgruber -Batcho two-step method is a general process for<br>
the construction of the indole ring system from the appropriate<br>
o-nitrotoluene. This reaction involves the condensation of an<br>
o-nitrotoluene with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal<br>
followed by a reductive cyclization under suitable conditions -<br>
such as hydrogen over a palladium catalyst or Zn/HOAc as<br>
described in Sundberg, R.J. Indoles; Chapter 2, Academic Press<br>
Inc., San Diego, CA, 1996. A representative description of the<br>
process can also be found in Organic Synthesis, 1984, 63, 214.<br><br><br>
A general procedure for the synthesis of intermediate<br>
compounds wherein R is an aromatic, heteroaromatic or alkyl<br>
group is indicated in Scheme G below. As previously described,<br>
nucleophilic substitution of halogen, preferably fluorine, in<br>
an aromatic system is a method often used to substitute<br>
aromatic rings with amine and ether functionalities. Both 4-<br>
and 5-fluoro-2-nitrotoluene are sufficiently activated enough<br>
to undergo substitution with alcohols- or phenols in the<br>
presence of K2CO3 in a polar aprotic solvent such as DMSO. A<br>
similar system using KOH and phenol is described in J. Med.<br>
Chem. 1994, 37, 1955. Alternatively, solid-liquid phase<br>
transfer catalysis (PTC) methods have been used to prepare<br>
intermediate ethers of this type as described in Synth. Comm.<br>
1990, 20, 2855. The appropriately substituted o-nitrotoluene<br>
can then be converted to the appropriate indole by the<br>
Leimgruber-Batcho method previously desribed.<br><br><br>
The preparation of intermediate alkoxy indole compounds<br>
wherein R is C1-C6 alkyl is outlined in Scheme H below.<br>
Commercially available nitrophenols can be alkylated under mild<br>
conditions with a base such as, for example, K2CO3 or Cs2CO3, in<br>
a polar aprotic solvent, e.g. CH3CN, with a variety of<br>
suitable alkyl halides. See Synth. Comm. 1995, 25, 1367. The<br>
alkoxy o-nitrotoluene can then be converted to the desired<br>
indole as described above.<br><br>
Alternatively, some examples of the invention where Z is a<br>
bond and Ar is a substituted heterocycle such as a thiazole; or<br>
2 is amide and Ar is a substituted phenyl can be conveniently<br>
prepared from an indole 3-acetic acid derivative as illustrated<br>
in Scheme I. Using this method, the carboxylic acid moiety is<br>
activated and coupled with an aryl amine. Some examples of<br>
activating methods well-known to those skilled in the art<br>
include formation of acid chloride, mixed anhydrides and<br>
coupling reagents such as 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiinide (DCC).<br><br><br>
A review of such method can be found in Bodanszky, M.<br>
Principles of Peptide Synthesis; Springer-Verlag: New York,<br>
1984. For the examples where Z is a bond and Ar is a<br>
substituted benzothiazole or benzoxazole, the intermediate<br>
amide or thioamide can be cyclized into the aromatic ring.<br>
Examples of these types of hetercycle forming reactions are<br>
described in Mylar, B. L. et al. J. Med. Chem. 1991, 34, 108.<br>
In addition, the carboxylic acid can be converted to a chloro-<br>
or bromomethyl ketone and condensed with nucleophiles like<br>
thioamides or 2-aminothiophenols to produce thiazole or<br>
benzothiazine derivatives. Examples of methods to prepare the<br>
chloro- and bromomethyl ketones are illustrated in Rotella,<br>
D.P.; Tetrahedron Lett. 1995, 36, 5453 and Albeck, A.; Persky,<br>
R.; Tetrahedron 1994, 50, 6333. Depending on the reaction<br>
conditions in a given synthetic sequence a protecting group may<br>
be required. It is also understood that the specific order of<br>
steps used in the synthesis depends on the particular example<br>
being prepared. P may represent H, A-COOH, A-COO-lower alkyl<br>
or a simple protecting group that can be removed at a late<br>
stage of the synthesis. When such a protecting group is used,<br>
the A-CO2R6 group can be introduced near the end of the<br>
synthesis after the Z-Ar group has been assembled. Method of<br>
introducing the Z-Ar group are similar to those already<br>
described.<br><br><br>
Another strategy involves the synthesis of substituted<br>
indoles via an intramolecular cyclization of an aniline<br><br><br>
nitrogen onto a substituted alkyne as shown in Scheme J.<br>
Typical approaches utilize commercially available o-iodoaniline<br>
derivatives. When these intermediates are unavailable, the<br>
regioselective ortho iodination of aromatic amines is used to<br>
generate the required intermediate (J. Org. Chem. 1996, 61,<br>
5804). For example, Iodophenyl intermediates are treated with<br>
trimethylsilylacetylene in the presence of a Pd catalyst and a<br>
Cu(I) source, such as cupric iodide, to produce o-<br>
alkynylanilines. See Heterocycles, 1996, 43, 2471 and J. Org.<br>
Chem. 1997, 62, 6507. Further elaboration of the o-.<br>
alkynylaniline to the desired indole can be done by a copper-<br>
mediated cyclization or a base-induced amine ring closure onto<br>
the alkyne functionality (J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 892).<br>
Alternative modifications have been made in the acetylenic<br>
derivatives to generate more elaborate indole structures as<br>
described in J. Am-. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 6689, Tetrahedron<br>
Lett. 1993, 24, 2823 and Tetrahedron Lett. 1993, 34, 6471.<br><br>
Those having skill in the art will recognize that the<br>
starting materials may be varied and additional steps employed<br>
to produce compounds encompassed by the present invention, as<br>
demonstrated by the following examples. In some cases.<br><br><br>
protection of certain reactive functionalities may be necessary<br>
to achieve some of the above transformations. In general, the<br>
need for such protecting groups will be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art of organic synthesis as well as the<br>
conditions necessary to attach and remove such groups.<br>

Representative compounds of the invention were tested for<br>
their potency, selectivity and efficacy as inhibitors of human<br>
aldose reductase. The potency or aldose reductase inhibiting<br><br><br>
effects of the compounds were tested using methods similar to<br>
those described by Butera et al. in J. Med. Chem. 1989, 32,<br>
757. Using this assay, the concentrations required to inhibit<br>
human aldose reductase (hALR2) activity by 50% (IC50) were<br>
determined.<br>
In a second assay, a number of the same compounds were<br>
tested for their ability to inhibit aldehyde reductase (hALRl),<br>
a structurally related enzyme. The test method employed were<br>
essentially those described by Ishii, et al., J. Med. Chem.<br>
1996 39: 1924. Using this assay, the concentrations required to<br>
inhibit human aldehyde reductase activity by 50% (IC50) were<br>
determined.<br>
From these data, the hALRl / hALR2 ratios were determined.<br>
Since high potency of test compounds as inhibitors of aldose<br>
reductase is desirable, low hALR2 IC50 values are sought. On<br>
the other hand, high potency of test compounds as inhibitors of<br>
aldehyde reductase is undesirable, and high hALRl IC50s values<br>
are sought. Accordingly, the hALRl / hALR2 ratio is used to<br>
determine the selectivity of the test compounds. The<br>
importance of this selectivity is described in Kotani, et al.,<br>
J. Med. Chem. 40: 684, 1997.<br>
The results of all these tests are combined and<br>
illustrated in Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br>
The results show the superior potency, selectivity and<br>
efficacy of representative compounds of the invention. Such<br>
compounds are useful in the treatment of chronic complications<br>
arising from diabetes mellitus, such as diabetic cataracts,<br>
retinopathy and neuropathy. Accordingly, an aspect of the<br>
invention is treatment of such complications with the inventive<br>
compounds; treatment includes both prevention and alleviation.<br>
The compounds are useful in the treatment of, for example,<br>
diabetic cataracts, retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy.<br>
In a third, optional, set of experiments, the compounds<br>
can be assayed for their ability to normalize or reduce<br>
sorbitol accumulation in the sciatic nerve of streptozotocin-<br>
induced diabetic rats. The test methods employed to determine<br>
the efficacy are essentially those of Mylari, et al., J. Med.<br>
Chem. 34: 108, 1991.<br>

using it, are now described in such full, clear, concise and<br>
