DESCRIPTION VARIABLE VALVE LIFT DEVICE OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a variable valve lift device of an internal combustion engine which continuously changes an amount of lift of an engine valve that is an intake valve or an exhaust valve. BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] A valve operating System in which one end of a push rod is f itted to one end of a rocker arm having a valve abutment part abutting to an engine valve at the other end side and a link mechanism is provided between the other end of the push rod and a valve operating cam in order to continuously change the amount of lift of the engine valve is already known by Patent Document 1.<br>
[0003] However, in the valve operating mechanism disclosed in the above-described Patent Document 1, it is necessary to ensure a comparatively large space to dispose a link mechanism and the push rod therein, between the valve operating cam and the rocker arm, and therefore, the valve operating System becomes large in size. In addition, a driving force from the valve operating cam is transmitted to the rocker arm via the link mechanism and the push rod, and theref ore, it is dif f icult to sayf ollow-upability of the rocker arm to the valve operating cam, namely, f ollow-upability of opening and closing Operation of the engine valve is excellent.<br><br>
[ 000 4 ] Thus , the applicant already proposes a valve operating System of the internal combustion engine in which one end portions of a f irst and second link arm are rotatably connected to a rocker arm, the other end portion of the first link arm is rotatably supported at an engine body, and the other end portion of the second link arm is displaced by drive means in Patent Document 2 - According to the valve operating System, it is possible to make the valve operating system compact and it is also possible to ensure excellent follow-up ability to the valve operating cam by directly transmitting the power from the valve operating cam to the rocker arm. Patent Document 1<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 8-74534 Patent Document 2<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2004-36560 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] Incidentally, in the valve operating system of the above-described Patent Document 2, a crank member includes a pair of crank webs which sandwich the second link arm from opposite sides, and both the crank webs are connected by a movable support shaft which supports the other end portion of the second link arm. Whereas assembly workability of the second link arm to the crank member is considered, it is necessary to form at least one of the crank webs and the movable support shaft to be separate members and couple the crank web, which is the separate member from the movable support shaft.<br><br>
to the other end of the movable support shaf t af ter mounting one end of the movable support shaf t to the other crank member. [0006] Whereas in the variable valve device, since a torsion f orce acts on the movable support shaf t by the driving torque applied to the crank web, sufficient torsional rigidity is required at a joining portion of the movable support shaft and the crank web. In order to enhance such torsional rigidity, it is considered to integrally form the movable support shaft and the crank web by forging or the like, but when the second link arm is to be assembled to the crank member with the movable support shaft and the crank web integrated, a connection hole provided in the second link arm to insert the movable support shaft therethrough has to be in the construction split in two halves as a large end portion of a connecting rod, and increase in the size of the second link arm cannot be avoided. Namely, it is extremely dif f icult to ensure torsional rigidity at the joining portion of the movable support shaft and the crank web while avoiding increase in size of the variable valve lif t device and ensuring assembly workability of the second link arm to the crank member.<br>

64 ..., movement of the other end portion of the first link arm 58 in the direction along the axis of the intake side rocker shaft 57 at the other end portion of the first link arm 58 is restrained.<br>
[0048] Incidentally, both the intake valves 20 ... are biased in the valve closing direction by the valve Springs 23 ..., and the roller 50 of the intake side rocker arm 31 is in contact with the intake side valve operating cam 29 by the work of<br>
the valve Springs 23 ... when both the intake valves 20 ... biased by spring in the valve closing direction is driven to the valve opening direction by the intake side rocker arm 31. In the valve closed State of the intake valves 20 ..., the spring f orce of the valve Springs 23 ... does not act on the intake side rocker arm 31, the roller 50 separates from the intake side valve operating cam 29, and there is the possibility that the control precision of the amount of valve lif t when the intake<br><br>
valves 20 ... are slightly opened is reduced. Therefore, the intake side rocker arm 31 is biased in the direction to make the roller 50 abut to the intake side valve operating cam 29<br>
by rocker arm biasing Springs 65 ... separate from the valve<br>
Springs 23 	<br>
[0049] The rocker arm biasing Springs 65 ... are coil-shaped torsion Springs which Surround the support bosses 64 ..., and are provided between the engine body 11 and the intake side rocker arm 31. Namely, one ends of the rocker arm biasing Springs 65 ... are engaged in the support bosses ..., and the other ends of the rocker arm biasing Springs 65 ... are inserted and engaged in the first connecting shaft 51 which is hollow and operated integrally with the intake side rocker arm 31. [ 0050 ] The other end portion of the first link arm 58 is formed into a cylindrical shape so that an outer circumference is disposed at an inner side in the side view from an outer periphery<br>
of the rocker arm biasing Springs 65 ... which are wound in a coil shape, and a plurality of, for example, pairs of protruding parts 6 6 and 67 which inhibit the rocker arm biasing<br>
Springs 65 ... from falling to the first link arm 58 side are respectively provided to protrude, spaced in the<br>
circumferential direction at opposite ends in the axial<br>
direction at the other end portion of the first link arm 58.<br>
Accordingly, the fall of the rocker arm biasing Springs 65<br>
... is prevented while avoiding increase in size of the other end portion of the first link arm 58, and support rigidity of the other end portion of the first link arm 58 can be enhanced.<br><br>
[0051] The protruded parts 66 and 67 are disposed to avoid the Operation ränge of the second link arm 59, and therefore, the Operation ränge of the second link arm 59 can be suf f iciently<br>
secured irrespective of the protruded parts 66 and 67 ... being provided at the other end portion of the first link arm 58.<br>
[0052] Oil jets 68 ..., which supply oil to the upper portion of the other end side of the intake side rocker arm 31, are<br>
attached to caps 39 ... in the intake cam holders 41 ... provided at the engine body 11.<br>
[0053] Incidentally, a passage 69 which guides oil from an oil pump not shown is provided at one of a plurality of upper<br>
holders 38	 Arc-shaped recessed parts 70 ... are provided<br>
at the upper portion of each of the upper holders 38 ... to oppose to the lower half part of the intake side camshaft 30, and the passage 69 communicates with one of the recessed parts<br>
70.... An oil passage 71 is coaxially provided in the intake<br>
side camshaft 30, and, at the portions corresponding to the<br>
respective intake side cam holders 41 ..., the intake side camshaft 30 is provided with communication holes 72 ... of which inner ends are allowed to coiranunicate with the oil passage<br>
71	are provided so that the outer ends of the communication<br>
holes 72 .., open to the outer surf ace of the intake side camshaft 30.  Lubricatingoil is suppliedbetween the respective intake<br>
side cam holders 41 ... and the intake side camshaft 30 via the communication holes 72 ....<br>
[0054] On the bottom surf aces of the caps 39 ..., which construct the intake side cam holders 41 ... with the upper holders 38<br><br>
..., recessed parts 73 ..., which form passages leading to the recessed parts 70 ... in a space from upper surfaces of the upper holders 38 ..., are provided, and the oil jets ... 68 are mounted to the caps 39 ... so as to communicate with the recessed parts 73 ... and link to passages 74 ... which are provided in<br>
the caps 39 	<br>
[0055] The oil jets 68 ... are mounted to the caps 39 ... of the intake cam holders 46 ... provided at the engine body 11 to rotatably support the intake side camshaft 30 as above, and a suf f icient amount of oil at suf f iciently high pressure<br>
can be supplied from the oil jets 68 ... by utilizing oil passage for lubricating Spaces between the intake side camshaft 30<br>
and the intake side cam holders 41 —<br>
[0056] Since oil is supplied from the oil jet 68 toward the upper first connecting shaft 51 of the first and second connecting shafts 51 and 63 which connect one end portions of the first and the second link arms 58 and 59 to the intake side rocker arm 31, the oil which lubricates a space between the first link arm 58 and the intake side rocker arm 31 flows down to the lower second link arm 59.<br>
[0057] Oil introductionholes 75 and 76 with parts of the movable support shaft 60 and the second connecting shaft 63 faced to intermediate portions are provided in the second link arm 59 in a perpendicular direction to a straight line which connects axes of the movable support shaft 60 and the second connecting shaft 63, and one end of each of the oil introduction holes 7 5 and 7 6 is opened to the first connecting shaft 51 side.<br><br>
Accordingly, the oil which flows downward from the first link arm 58 is effectively guided between the second link arm 59, and the movable support shaft 60 and the second connecting shaft 63, and connecting parts of the intake side rocker arm 31 and the first and second link arms 58 and 59, and a space between the second link arm 59 and the movable support shaft<br>
60	are lubricated, thus making it possible to ensure smooth<br>
valve operating action.<br>
[0058] The crankmember 61 is a Singlememberwhich is supported at the engine body 11 for common use in aplurality of cylinders arranged in line, and is constructed into a crank shape having crank webs 61a and 61a disposed at opposite sides of the intake side rocker arm 31, Journal parts 61b and 61b which perpendicularly link with outer surfaces of base end parts of both the crank webs 61a and 61a and are rotatably supported by the enginebody 11, andaconnectingpart 61c which integrally connects both the crank webs 61a and 61a at a position where interference with the second link arm 5 9 is avoided for each cylinder. The movable support shaft 60 is connected to the crank member 61 so as to connect the both crank webs 61a and 61a. [0059] The respective Journal parts 61b ... of the crank member<br>
61	are rotatably supported between the upper holders 38 ...<br>
connected to the cylinder head 14 of the engine body 11, and<br>
lower holders 77 ... connected to the upper holder 38 f rombelow. The lower holders 77 ... are formed to be separate from the cylinder head 14 to be fastened to the upper holders 38 ...,<br><br>
and recessed parts 78 ... in which the lower holders 7 7 ... are disposed are provided on the top face of the cylinder head 14.<br>
[0060] Roller bearings 79 ... are interposed between the upper and lower holders 38 ... and 77 ..., and the Journal parts 61b ..., and the roller bearings 7 9 ... are capable of being split in halves to be interposed between the Journal parts 61b ... of the crank member 61, which has a plurality of webs 61a,<br>
61a ... and connecting parts 61c ... and is for common use in a plurality of cylinders, and the upper and lower holders 38<br>
... and 77 ....<br>
[0061] Crank member support bosses 80 ... which protrude to crank webs 61a ... of the crank member 61 are formed in the upper and lower holders 38 ... and 77 ... to allow the Journal part 61b to penetrate therethrough. Camshaft support boss<br>
parts 81 ... through which the intake side camshaft 30 is penetrated through are formed in the upper holders 38 ... and the caps 39 ... joined to each other to collaborate to construct the intake side cam holders 41 ... to protrude toward the intake side rocker arms 31 ..., and ribs 82 ... which connect the crank member support boss parts 80 ... and the camshaft support boss<br>
parts 81 ... are integrally provided in the upper holders 38	<br>
[0062] Passages 83 ... which guide oil to the roller bearings 79 ... side are provided inside the ribs 82 ... to communicate with the recessed parts 70 ... of the top faces of the upper holders 38<br><br>
[0063] While the exhaust side valve operating System 33 is placed at the cylinder head 14 so that the swing support part of the exhaust side rocker arm 36 is disposed outside from the linking and connecting part of the exhaust side rocker<br>
arm 36 to the exhaust valves 21 ..., the intake side valve operating System 28 is placed at the cylinder head 14 so that the intake side rocker shaf t 57 and the movable support shaf ts 60 ... are placed inside from the linking and connecting parts<br>
of the intake side rocker arms 31 ... to the intake valves 20	<br>
[ 0064 ] Aplug cylinder 87 , intowhichan ignitionplug 86 mounted<br>
to the cylinder head 14 to face the combustion Chamber 17 is inserted, is mounted to the cylinder head 14 between the intake side and exhaust side valve operating Systems 28 and 33, and the plug cylinder 87 is disposed to tilt closer to the exhaust side valve operating System 3 3 toward the above. [0065] Thus, the crank member 61 in the intake side valve operating System 28 is disposed between the intake valves 20... and the plug cylinders 87 ... so that the outer faces of the connecting parts 61c ... are opposed to the plug cylinders 87..., and relief grooves 88 ... to avoid interference with the plug cylinders 87 ... are formed on the outer faces of the connecting<br>
parts 61c	<br>
[0066] When the intake valves 20 ... are in the valve closed State, the second connecting shaft 63, which connects the<br>
second link arm 59 to the intake side rocker arm 31, is on<br>
the same axis as the Journal parts 61b ... of the crank member 61, and when the crank member 61 Swings around the axes of<br><br>
the Journal parts 61b ..., the movable support shaft 60 moves on the arc with the axis of the Journal parts 61b ... as the<br>
center.<br>
[0067] In the crank member 61, a stopper pin 105, which is parallel with the axis of rotation of the crank member 61, namely, the axis of the Journal part 61b, is provided to protrude at the crank web 61a at one end side, which is along the cylinder arrangement direction, for example, and a restraint hole 106 into which a tip end of the stopper pin 105 is inserted is formed into an arc shape with the axis of the Journal part 61b as the center in the inner face of the side wall of the head cover 15 in the engine body 11, as shown in FIG. 7. Thus, the rotation ränge of the crank member 61 is restrained to the ränge in which the stopper pin 105 can move in the restraint hole 106. Namely, the stopper pin 105 parallel with the rotation axis of the crank member 61 is provided to protrude at the crank web 61a to restrain the rotation ränge of the crank member 61 by engagement with the engine body 11 side.<br>
[0068] In FIG. 9 and FIG. 10, one of the Journal parts 61b... which the crank member 61 includes protrudes from a support hole 89 provided at the head cover 15, a control arm 91 is fixed to a tip end of the Journal part 61b, and the control arm 91 is driven by the actuator motor 62 mounted to an outer wall of the cylinder head 14 . Namely, a nut member 93 is meshed with a screw shaft 92 which is rotated by the actuator motor 62, and one end of a connecting link 9 5 with the other end pivotally supported at the nut member 93 with a pin 94 is<br><br>
connected to the control arm 91 viapins 96 and 96 .  Accordingly, when the actuator motor 62 is operated, the nut member 93 moves along the rotating screw shaft 92, and the crank member 61<br>
swings around the Journal parts 61b ... by the control arm 91 connected to the nut member 93 via the connecting link 95, whereby the movable support shaft 60 is displaced. [0069] A rotational angle sensor 97 such as, for example, an encoder is provided at an outer wall face of the head cover 15, and one end of a sensor arm 98 is fixed to a tip end of a sensor shaft 97a. A guide groove 99 linearly extending along a longitudinal direction of the control arm 91 is formed in the control arm 91, and a connecting shaft 100 provided at the other end of the sensor arm 98 is slidably fitted in the guide groove 99.<br>
[0070] The screw shaft 92, the nut member 93, the pin 94, the connecting link 95, the pins 96 and 96, the control arm 91, the rotational angle sensor 97, the sensor arm 98 and the connecting shaft 100 are housed in a case 101 which is mounted to side faces of the cylinder head 14 and the head cover 15<br>
with bolts 102 ..., and a cover 103 which covers an open end face of the case 101 is mounted to the case 101 with the screw<br>
members 10<br>
[0071] In the variable valve lift device 32, when the control arm 91 rotates in the counterclockwise direction from the Position shown in FIG. 9 with the actuator motor 62, the crank member 61 connected to the control arm 91 also rotates in the counterclockwise direction, and the movable support shaft 60<br><br>
lowers. When the roller 50 is pressed with the intake side valve operating cam 29 of the intake side camshaf t 30 in this State, a quadric link connecting the intake side rocker shaft 57 , the first connecting shaft 51, the second connecting shaft 63 and the movable support shaft 60 is deformed and the intake side rocker arm 31 swings downward. The tappet screws 49 and 49 press the stems 20a ... of the intake valve 20, and the intake valves 20 ... are opened with low lif t.<br>
[0072] When thecontrol arm 91 rotates to the solidlineposition in FIG. 9 with the actuator motor 62, the crank member 61 connected to the control arm 91 is rotated in the clockwise direction, and the movable support shaft 60 rises . When the roller 50 is pressed with intake side valve operating cam 29 of the intake camshaft 30 in this State, the quadric link is deformed, the intake side rocker arm 31 Swings downward, the tappet screws 49 and 49 press the stem 20a of the intake valves<br>
20 ..., and the intake valves 20 ... open with high lift. [0073] Next, explaining the Operation of this embodiment, in the variable valve lif t device 32 which continuously changes<br>
the valve opening lift amount of the intake valves 20 ..., one end portions of the fist and second link arms 58 and 59 are connected in parallel to the intake side rocker arm 31 having the valve connecting part 31a linked and connected to a pair<br>
of intake valves 20 ... to be relatively rotatable, and the other end portion of the first link arm 5 8 is rotatably supported by the intake side rocker shaft 57 supported by the engine body 11, while the other end portion of the second link arm<br><br>
59 is rotatably supported by the displaceable movable support<br>
shaft 60.<br>
[0074] Accordingly, it is possible to change the amount of<br>
lift of the intake valves 20 ... by continuously displacing the movable support shaft 60, and it is possible to control the intake amount by making the throttle valve unnecessary. In addition, the one end portions of the first and second link arms 58 and 59 are directly connected to the intake side rocker arm 31 to be rotatable, thus making it possible to reduce the space where both the link arms 58 and 59 are disposed to make the valve operating System compact, and the power from the intake side valve operating cam 29 is directly transmitted to the roller 50 of the intake side rocker arm 31, thus making it possible to ensure excellent f ollow-up ability to the intake side valve operating cam 29 . The positions of the intake side rocker arm 31, the first and second link arms 58 and 59 in the direction along the axis of the intake side cam shaft 30 are disposed at substantially the sameposition, andtheref ore, the intake side valve operating system 28 in the direction along the axis of the intake sidecamshaf t 31 canbemade compact. [0075 ] The one endportion of the first link arm 58 is rotatablly connected to the intake side rocker arm 31 via the first connecting shaft 51, and the roller 50 is pivotally supported at the intake side rocker arm 31 via the first connecting shaft 51. Therefore, rotatable connection of the one end portion of the first link arm 58 to the intake side rocker arm 31, pivotal support of the roller 50 to the intake side rocker<br><br>
arm 31 are achieved by the common first connecting shaft 51, whereby the number of components is reduced and the intake side valve operating System 28 can be made more compact. [0076] In the intake side valve operating System 28 including the variable link mechanism 32 of the intake side and exhaust side valve operating Systems 28 and 33, the intake side rocker shaft 57 and the movable support shaft 60 are disposed inside f rom the linking and connecting part of the intake side rocker<br>
arm 31 to the intake valves 20 ..., and the Swing support part of the exhaust side rocker arm 36 included by the exhaust side valve operating System 33 is disposed outside f rom the linking and connecting part of the exhaust side rocker arm 36 and the<br>
exhaust valves 21 	  Therefore, even if an angle of nip a<br>
(see FIG. 1) of the intake valves 20 ... and the exhaust valves 21 ... is set to be small to obtain favorable combustion by making the combustion Chamber 17 compact, mutual interf erence of the intake side and exhaust side valve operating Systems 28 and 33 can be avoided while avoiding increase in size.of the cylinder head 14.<br>
[0077] The exhaust side valve operating System 33 includes the exhaust side cam shaft 35 having the exhaust side valve operating cam 34, and the exhaust side rocker arm 36 which is swingably supported at the engine body 11 via the exhaust side rocker shaft 43 to swing by following the exhaust side valve operating cam 34 and linked and connected to the exhaust<br>
valves 21 ..., and the plug cylinder 68 disposed between the intake side and exhaust side valve operating Systems 28 and<br><br>
33 is mounted to the cylinder head 14 by being tilted to be closer to the exhaust side valve operating System 33 toward the above. Therefore, the plug cylinder 68 is disposed to avoid interference of the intake side and exhaust side valve operating Systems 28 and 33, thus making it possible to contribute to making the entire head 14 more compact. [0078] Incidentally, the crank member 61 included by the variable link mechanism 32 of the intake side valve operating System 28 is constructed in the crank shape by having the crank webs 61a and 61 asandwiching the second link arm 59 fromopposite side, and the connecting part 61c which integrally joins both the crank webs 61a and 61a at thepositionwhere the interf erence with the second link arm 59 is avoided, and the movable support shaft 63 is connected to the crank member 61 to connect both the crank webs 6 la and 61a. Accordingly, rigidity of the crank member 61 which is driven to make angular displacement can be increased, and even if the torque required for rotation of the crank member 61 is large, the torsion strength bürden of the movable support shaft 63 can be made small. The movable support shaft 63 is made the separate body from the crank member 61, and the movable support shaft 63 is inserted by press-fitting or the like in the state in which the movable support shaft Insertion parts of a pair of crank webs 61a and 61a and the second link arm 59 are aligned, thus facilitating assembly. In addition, the connecting part 61c of the crank member 61 does not interf ere with the second link arm 59, and<br><br>
therefore, the crank member 61 and the second link arm 59 do not increase in size.<br>
[0079] The stopper pin 105 parallel with the axis of rotation of the crank member 61 is provided to protrude at the crank web 61a to restrain the rotation ränge of the crank member 61 by the engagement with the engine body 11 side, and therefore, the structure to restrain the rotation ränge of the crank member 61 can be constructed to be compact. The crank member 61 is connected to the movable support shaf t 60 allowing the movable support shaft 60 to perform angular displacement around the axis which is parallel with its axis and is supported at the engine body 11 at the opposite sides of the intake side rocker arm 31, and support rigidity of the crank member 61 is enhanced by supporting at the opposite sides, thus making it possible to precisely perform the variable lift amount control of the<br>
intake valves 20 <br>
[0080] Since the Single crank member 61 is supported at the<br>
engine body 11 to be common to a plurality of cylinders arranged in line, an increase in the number of components is avoided and the internal combustion engine E can be made compact. [0081] The Journal portions 61b ... of the crank member 61 are rotatably supported between the upper holders 38 ... joined to the cylinder head 14 of the engine body 11, and the lower<br>
holders 77 ... joined to the upper holders 38 ... from below. Assembly workability of the crank member 61 to the engine body<br>
11 can be enhanced, and the lower holders 77 ...which are separate bodies from the cylinder head 14 are fastened to the upper<br><br>
holders 38 ..., therefore, making it possible to increase degree of freedom of the design of the cylinder head 14 in supporting the crank member 61.<br>
[0082] Since the roller bearings 79 ..., which can be split in halves, are interposed between the upper and lower holders<br>
38 ... and 77 ..., and the Journal parts 61b..., assemblyworkability of the crank member 61 can be enhanced while reducing the friction loss at the support part of the crank member 61. [ 0083 ] The crank member support boss parts 80 ... which protrude to the crank webs 61a ... of the crank member 61 are formed at the upper and lower holders 38 ... and 77 ... joined to each other, and the Journal parts 61b ... penetrating through the crank member support boss parts 80 ... are rotatably supported between the upper and lower holders 38 ... and 77 ..., therefore making it possible to further enhance the support rigidity of the crank member 61.<br>
[0084] The cam shaft support boss parts 81 ... which protrude toward the intake side rocker arm 31 are formed in the upper<br>
holders 38 ... and the caps 39 ... joined to the upper holders 38 ... from above, and the intake side camshaft 30 penetrates through the camshaft support boss parts 81 ... and rotatably<br>
supported between the upper holders 38 ... and the caps 39 	<br>
Therefore, the support rigidity of the intake side camshaft 30 can be enhanced while restraining the number of components for supporting the intake side camshaft 30 to the minimum. [ 0085 ] Since the ribs 82 ... connecting the crank member support boss parts 80 ... and the camshaft support boss parts 81 ...<br><br>
are provided to protrude at the Upper holders 38 ..., the support rigidity of the crank member 61 and the intake side camshaft 30 can be further enhanced. [0086] Incidentally, the crank member 61 is disposed between<br>
the intake valves 20 ... and the plug cylinder 87 provided at the cylinder head 14 so that the outer face of the connecting part 61c is opposed to the plug cylinder 87, and the relief groove 88 f or avoiding the interf erence with the plug cylinder 87 is formed on the outer face of the connecting part 61c, therefore making it possible to dispose the plug cylinder 87 closer to the intake side valve operating system 28, and make the internal combustion engine E compact.<br>
[0087] In the intake side rocker arm 31 of the intake side valve operating system 28, the lightening parts 53, 54 and 54 which alternate each other are formed on the opposite faces f rom each other of the valve connecting part 6 la, and therefore, it is possible to reduce the weight of the intake side rocker arm 31.<br>
[0088] The lightening parts 53, 54 and 54 are also formed at the time of die forming of the intake side rocker arm 31, and since the draft angles of the lightening parts 53 and 54; and 53 and 54 adjacent to each other are in the opposite directions from each other, the inner faces of the lightening parts 53 and 54; and 53 and 54 adjacent to each other tilt in the same direction. Accordingly, the thickness of the wall parts 31d and 31d which are formed between the lightening parts 53 and 54; and 53 and 54 adjacent to each other at the intake side<br><br>
rocker arm 31 is substantially uniform, and rigidity of the intake side rocker arm 31 can be kept by the wall parts 31d and 31d of the substantially uniform thickness. [0089 ] Since the intake side valve operating System 28 includes the variable valve lift device 32 which makes the amount of<br>
lift of the intake valves 20 ... continuously variable, it is made possible to reduce the weight of the intake side valve operating System 28 by reducing the weight of the intake side rocker arm 31 and the limit rotational speed can be increased, even in the intake side valve operating System 28 having the variable valve lift device 32 which tends to cause the increase in weight of the intake side valve operating System 28 with a comparatively large number of components.
