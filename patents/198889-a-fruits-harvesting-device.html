Description of Prior Art<br>
Harvesting of the fruits for example coconut and like fruits is done mainly through the human labour, where a labourer climbs up the tree with the help of a rope and plucks the fruits from the tree.<br>
Another method is that a sickle is tied up at the top end of a long bamboo pole and the sickle is used to cut off the fruits from the trees.<br>
Yet another method is that a ladder is placed against the tree and the labour climb up the ladder in order to pluck the fruits from the tree.<br>
Still another method of harvesting the fruits for example coconut and the like fruits is done by the persons by using the mechanical device either to pick the fruits from the tree directly,<br>
A device disclosed in US patent no, 5301459 comprises an upper engagement member and a lower engagement member which can be opened or closed to engaged an upper and lower portion of the vertical member/ tree respectively. An extension/retraction member is connected to the upper and lower engagement member. The extension/retraction member extends or retracts to very the distance between the upper and lower engagement members. The upper and upper engagement members are provided with a vertical stands mounted on a box type platform. A circular ring having a platform provided therewith is provided with the central support such that to surround the stem of the tree for providing a round platform aroimd the tree so as to ease the operation of plucking the fruits.<br><br>
Another device disclosed in the US patent No. 6443196 comprises wwy boom members secured with each other. The lower end of the first boom memlx r is secured with the mounting firame mounted on a vehicle like a crane. A working U)t&gt;l head is provided at the top end of the second boom for providing a base platform to the user during the operation of the device.
