COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
	"LIGHTWEIGHT SCOOTER WHEEL"<br><br><br>
PIAGGIO &amp; C. S.p.A., a company organized under law of the Italian Republic of Viale Rinaldo Piaggio 25 - Pontedera (Pisa), Italy,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
90/MUMNP/2000<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
8-7-2005<br><br>
This  invention  refers  to  a  lightweight  scooter   wheel.<br>
As is well known to the experts in the branch, the scooter wheels in present use are of three structural types:<br>
hub and rim both.entirely made of steel,<br>
hub and rim both entirely made of aluminum,<br>
hub made of steel or aluminum, and rim made of steel<br>
bolted to the hub itself.<br>
It is also known that each of the wheel types mentioned above may be used both for disc brakes and for drum brakes.<br>
The transmission of the braking moment occurs in the first case from the disc (braked by a caliper) to the wheel, based on a friction-blockage by screws from the disc to the wheel hub and from there to the wheel itself. In the second case, on the other hand, the transmission occurs directly from the brake shoes to the brake disc of the wheel hub.<br>
In each of these cases the braking moment acts on   the wheel hub, where heat evolves as a result of the interaction between the blocked parts, a heat which must then be dissipated toward the outside.<br><br>
US 4,900,097 discloses a car wheel comprising a hub (5) and a rim (1) associable with said hub (5), said rim (1) being made of a plastic material, in which said hub (5) and said rim (1) are tied to each other in the presence of insulating plate (8) capable of reducing the transfer of heat evolved from a brake. The insulating plate does not cut off the transfer of heat evolved from a brake due to the presence of heat conductive elements such as steel pin (4), bolts (9) and fixing plate (7) placed between the hub portion (5) and the disc (3) connected with the rim (1).<br>
It neither discloses or suggests bushings made of a heat-resistant plastic element as heat-cut off elements. No heat-resistant plastic element are placed on a fastening element arranged between said hub and said rim.<br>
The scope of this invention is to produce a particularly lightweight and sturdy wheel.<br>
Another scope is to achieve such a wheel regardless of the nature of the metal constituting the base for the construction of the wheel.<br>
These scopes according to this invention are achieved by producing a lightweight scooter wheel.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a lightweight scooter wheel comprising a hub carrying a drum brake or a disc brake and a rim associable with said hub, said hub being made of a metallic material and that said rim being made of a plastic material, in which said hub and said rim are tied to each other in the presence of elements capable of cutting off the heat evolved from said drum brake or disc brake, characterized in that said heat-cut off elements are constituted by at least one bushing made of a heat-resistant plastic element placed on a fastening element arranged between said hub and said rim.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br><br>
The characteristics and advantages' of a lightweight<br>
scooter wheel according to this invention will be more<br>
fully and clearly evident from the following description,<br>
 offered  for  exemplifying  and  non-limiting  purposes,<br>
15  referred to the enclosed simplified drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a front view of a lightweight scooter wheel according to this invention in a first embodiment.<br>
Figure 2 is a simplified,  partially sectionalized and enlarged lateral view   of part of the lightweight 20  scooter wheel shown in Figure 1, showing that this type of design is particularly suitable for a drum brake,<br>
Figure 3 is a sectionalized,  enlarged view of a detail of Figure 2,     <br>
Figure. 4 is a partially sectionalized,  simplified 5  and enlarged side view of part of the lightweight scooter<br><br>
wheel according to the invention, in a second embodiment particularly suitable for a disc brake, and<br>
Figure 5 is a partially sectionalized, simplified and enlarged side view of part of the lightweight scooter wheel according to the invention, in a third embodiment showing it to be suitable for a drum brake, but quickly convertible to a disc brake.<br>
As can easily be seen, in order to provide a solution for the technical problems mentioned above, this invention proposes to produce a wheel essentially composed of two components: a metallic hub 12, made for example of aluminum, steel or cast iron, carrying either a drum brake 15 (in the case of a drum brake) or a disc brake 16 (in the case of a disc brake); and a rim 13 made of plastic material, equipped with spokes 14 (made of plastic) . In general, the rim 13 is attached to the hub 12 by screws or similar fastening devices. The hub 12 may eventually be finned to promote the dispersion to the environment of the heat generated during the braking action.<br>
According to the invention, moreover, between the hub 12 and the attached rim 13 with its relative spokes 14 some elements must provided to cut off the heat generated by the drum brake 15 or the disc brake 16. Alternatively, some heat cut-off elements may be provided<br><br>
directly between the drum brake 15 or the disc brake 16 and the hub 12.<br>
A first reference to the Figures 1, 2 and 3 shows a lightweight scooter wheel according to the invention, in   one of its first simplified embodiments, indicated in its overall form by the number 11.<br>
It should be kept in mind that the production of the wheel, while based on the general principles outlined above,  may be implemented in various specific forms.<br>
1) Returning for instance to the embodiment of Figures 1, 2 and 3, the spokes 14 are attached to the hub 12 by a number of screws 17. The example shows that the screws 17 are "pack-wise" tightening two bushings 18 and 19, which are in this case identical but may also differ, made of a<br>
15 heat-restistant plastic material. The bushings 18 and 19 are profiled in such a manner as to form at least one seat suitable for receiving an annular extension toward the inside 20, which departs from the spokes 14 and a central connecting body 14'.<br>
  The bushings 18 and 1.9 are fitted on the screws 17 by interposed spacers 21, plain washers 22 and elastic washers 23, which ensure their proper and stable positioning.<br>
The rim 13 may be molded in a single piece with the<br>
  spokes 14 and be fitted with an internal weight reljeving cavity 24 formed during the molding process, for example<br><br>
by a technique based on insufflating air into the plastic material.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a second embodiment, also derived from the general principle outlined in the  introductory part of the description of the figures, which shows  a  further possible  embodiment.<br>
This is in fact a lightweight wheel according to the invention, equipped with a disc brake 16 so as to firmly attach the latter to the hub 12. This again means a rim   13 fitted with spokes 14 and attached to a hub 12 connected with the mentioned disc brake 16 by further screws 25 and their relative elastic washers 26.<br>
Of course in this case the hub 12 will have an axially elongated shape so as to be appropriately capable 15 of carrying both the spokes 14 with the rim 13 and the disc brake 16. Appropriate cavities 27 provided in the body of the hub 12 will lighten it, but without thereby reducing its strength.<br>
If the further simplification of Figure 5 is now 20 examined, it can be seen that it offers a lightweight wheel according to the invention in the version applicable with a drum brake.<br>
The rim 13, equipped with spokes 14, is "jointly molded" on the hub 12, to which the drum brake 15 is   attached by screws 28 and elastic washers 29. It is immediately apparent that the versic<br><br>
can be easily derived from that with a drum brake, simply by substituting the drum brake 15 with a disc brake (not shown, but of the type shown above under the number 16 and connected to the hub 12 by screws 25 and elastic washers 26, as in Figure 4). It is alternatively possible to provide an appropriate interface carrying the disc brake itself.<br>
The rim 13, equipped with spokes 14 as described above, may for instance be produced by_a technique known as "Gas injection moulding" , which consists of the following essential phases:<br>
a)	the  injection  molding  of  plastic  material  in  an appropriate mold,<br>
b)	the  injection  of  compressed  air  into  the  plastic material, while still in a "pasty" state,<br>
c)	the  maintenance  of  the  compressed  air  while  the plastic material cools down,<br>
d)	the relieving of pressure at the end of the cooling phase.<br>
It should be noted that the main advantage of this technique is to make it possible to obtain pieces constituted by particular shapes, for instance of a closed and internally hollow type (tubulars), of variable thickness and characterized by high bending and torsion strength modules, combined with moderate weights.<br><br><br>
It can thus be seen that according to this invention the mentioned subdivision of the wheel was found to be<br>
necessary in order to impede the transfer of heat from<br>
the actually braking organ (drum or brake) to the plastic<br>
portion, so as to prevent the rapid structural collapse<br>
Of the latter.  This is done in view of the menhani ca1<br>
characteristics of the plastic material to be injection-molded, which are strongly and quicklv. reduced by the generated temperature rise.<br>
Mainly because of this reason, the union between rim, spokes and hub (conceived while taking the former problem into account) may be achieved, while not in an exhaustive form, by the two methods already outlined and described above:<br>
a)	by interposing between the two mentioned components<br>
some bushings made of a (plastic or non-plastc) material<br>
of a mechanically heat-resistant and thermally insulating<br>
type, endowed with good mechanical characteristics,<br>
b)	in a direct manner by moulding, where the heat<br>
dispersion generated while braking is for the largest<br>
part relying on a finned shape 30 of the drum, while the<br>
heat transfer by conduction from the drum itself to the<br>
hub and thereby to the plastic portion may be impeded by interposing a thermally insulating material between the<br>
drum and the hub, It should be noted that the hub may be<br><br><br>
produced in such a manner as to support both a drum brake or a disc brake.<br>
This clarifies the advantages of this invention, which can be summarized as follows:<br>
-	a good mechanical strength of the wheel, combined with reduced weights and overall inertial moments of the same, compared to those made of steel or aluminum, of the same dimensions and characteristics,<br>
-	a low overall cost,<br>
-	an (easy) achievement of even complex shapes of the<br>
spokes according to the possibilities afforded by the<br>
molding technology, for instance by "Gas injection<br>
molding",<br>
-	the possibility of fitting the same wheel with either a<br>
drum brake or a disc brake, by simply changing the<br>
element interfacing with the braking portion.<br>
It is obvious that even further examples of a lightweight scooter wheel according to this invention can be offered, without thereby abandoning the scope of protection afforded by this invention.<br><br>
