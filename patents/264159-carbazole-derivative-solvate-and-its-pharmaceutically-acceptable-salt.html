Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to carbazole derivatives, solvates thereof, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as well as medical compositions and medicines containing such compounds. To be more specific, the present invention relates to novel carbazole derivatives, solvates thereof, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and the like having an excellent adipose tissue weight reducing effect, hypoglycemic effect, and hypolipidemic effect, which are useful as a preventive and/or therapeutic agent for fatty liver, obesity, lipid metabolism abnormality, visceral adiposity, diabetes, hyperlipemia, impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and the like.<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
In recent years, lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity and diabetes are brought in question. Accordingly, transcription factors related to expression inductions of adipocyte differentiation marker genes are gaining attention. A peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (hereinafter, also referred to as "PPAR") is known to be related to a lot of physiological and/or pathological phenomena such as fat metabolism, regulation of inflammation, cell differentiation, and functional regulation, thereby gaining special attention. [0003]<br>
The PPAR is a nuclear receptor belonging to a steroid/retinoid receptor superfamily of ligand responsive transcription factors (Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., (1997), 1, 235-241; Cell, (1995), 83, 841-850). cDNAs of PPAR are cloned from various animal species and several isoform genes of PPAR are found. Among mammals, three subtypes, PPARa, PPARy, and PPAR8, are known (J. Steroid Biochem. Molec. Biol., (1994), 51, 157; Gene Expression, (1995), 4, 281; Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., (1996), 224, 431; Mol. Endocrinol., (1992), 6, 1634). [0004]<br>
The PPARy is known to be expressed mainly in the adipose tissue, immune organ, adrenal gland, spleen, small intestine, skeletal muscle, and liver. On the other hand, the PPARa is known to be expressed mainly in the liver, heart, kidney, adrenal gland, skeletal muscle, and retina. Also, the PPAR8 is known to be universally expressed without tissue specificity. Each of the PPARs forms a stable heterodimer with a retinoid X receptor (RXR), and bind with a specific DNA recognition sequence (PPRE) of the target gene for control. [0005]<br>
The PPARy is induced at a very early phase of an adipocyte differentiation and<br><br>
plays an important role in the adipocyte differentiation as a key regulating (controlling) factor. The first chemical identified as a direct ligand of PPAR was BRL49653, the thiazolidinediones (TZDs) having an antidiabetic effect on type II diabetes. Also, pioglitazone and ciglitazone that are antidiabetic drugs for type II diabetes and are TZD-type (Lehmann, J.M., J. (1995) Biol.Chem. 270, 12953-12956 (non-patent document 1), as well as 15-deoxy-A12,14-prostaglandin J2 that is a kind of prostaglandin metabolite (Cell, (1995), 83, 803-812; Cell, (1995), 83, 813-819 (non-patent document 2)) are known as candidates for intrinsic ligands of PPARy. Moreover, thiazolidinedione derivative that is an insulin sensitizer has been proved to increase the transcription activity of the PPARy, and known to have an insulin resistance improving effect, hypoglycemic effect, and antihyperlipidemic effect. [0006]<br>
Also, since adipocyte hypertrophy, fat accumulation and expression of insulin resistance are suppressed in a PPARy hetero deficient mouse, a model that the PPARy mediates adipocyte hypertrophy, fat accumulation and insulin resistance has been proposed (Mol. Cell, (1999), 4, 597 (non-patent document 3)), On the other hand, a thiazolidinedione (TZD) derivative that is a PPARy agonist is reported to have adipocyte differentiation inductive effect and to increase the number of adipose cells and the weight of adipose tissues (J. Clin. Invest., (1996), 98, 1004-1009 (non-patent document 4)). Therefore, while the TZD derivative is useful as a curative medicine for diabetes, possibility of promoting obesity is a concern. Also, while leptin is known as an antiobesity factor, the expression level of leptin is reported to decrease when the TZD derivative is administered (J. Biol. Chem., (1996), 271, 9455-9459 (non-patent document 5)). Based on these backgrounds, the PPARy antagonist is expected to control the differentiation of the adipose cell while simultaneously increasing the expression level of leptin, thereby acting as an antiobesity agent. [0007]<br>
Compounds that are PPARy receptor binder having the PPARy antagonist effect are disclosed by WO01/30343, WO02/060388, WO03/000685, WO2004/024705, and the like. These compounds are supposed to have an antiobesity effect, an adipose tissue weight reducing effect, a hypoglycemic effect, a hypolipidemic effect, and the like. [0008]<br>
On the other hand, WO01/26653, WO02/00255, WO02/00256, WO02/00257, and WO02/074342 (patent documents 1-5) disclose the following compound as a carbazole derivative. In these documents, the following compound is disclosed as a phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) inhibitor.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
