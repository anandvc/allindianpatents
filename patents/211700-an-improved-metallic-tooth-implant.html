				<td>The present invention relates to an improved metallic tooth implant. More particularly, this invention pertains to a metallic, two - stage tooth implant for single tooth replacement suitable for jawbones ( mandible and maxilla). The two- stage procedure consists of incorporation of firstly a root screw and secondly a crown screw to replace the lost tooth. The shape and surface of the crown screw facilitates final capping of the tooth on the crown of the same.<br>
Edentulousness has been a common problem especially with ageing human beings for as long their existence on this planet. Apart from difficulty in chewing food properly, it also adversely affects the appearance of a person, and therefore, this is one of the basic problems that mankind has been trying to overcome since the first days of development of medical and dental science. Apart from ageing, loss of tooth or teeth can be caused due to accidents, food habits and dental diseases leading to extraction, to name a few causes.<br>
Heretofore, a number of technologies and procedures had been introduced, tried, tested and perfected for replacement of human tooth / teeth. These range from incorporation of 'false' tooth / teeth to various implants. However, these techniques vary in their degree of effectiveness, as well as the cost involved. It has generally been observed that low priced techniques like false' tooth / teeth are less effective than some other techniques like conventional tooth implants, which, again, turns out to be complex, involving expensive methods,.with varying durability. In fact, the first screw type single dental implants were developed in the USA and European countries, which was more suited to the Caucasian lifestyle and bone structure. The procedure essentially consisted of more than two stages.<br>
2<br><br>
Needless to say, it is complex and cumbersome, costly, and more prone to infection as compared to the implant of the present invention. Moreover, the earlier dental implants are made of Titanium alloys, like Ti6 A14V, which are much harder, with little Osseo-integration properties, which leaves much to be desired in the end performance, reliability and durability of the implant.<br>
The major drawback of the earliest 'False tooth / teeth' replacements is that they always remain a foreign body inside a person's mouth. They have to be cared for every day, are not capable of proper function of a tooth / or teeth, like biting or chewing, and only partially fulfils the function of imparting a semblance of aesthesis to a person's mouth. In fact, most people find it difficult to talk, or chew food, among other activities, once their tooth / teeth are replaced by 'False tooth / teeth'.<br>
The earlier implants, too, have some major drawbacks, as listed herein below:<br>
a)	To begin with, these are rnulti stage ( essentially more than two stage) operations.<br>
This makes them more time-consuming and expensive.<br>
b)	Additionally,  this longer involvement makes the  implants prone to infection,<br>
especially in the Indian sub-continent, where the warm and humid weather and a<br>
relative lack of dental hygiene among people makes conditions more conducive for<br>
the same.<br>
c)	Moreover, the prior implants being made of Titanium alloys, have inferior Osseo -<br>
integration properties, and being harder, does not effectively cushion the transfer of<br>
shock loads due to chewing and biting to the jaw-bones.<br>
d)	Over and above all these, being a mufti-stage procedure, the prior method requires<br>
complex equipment and tooling, as well as specialised skill to be effectively<br>
administrable.<br>
3<br><br>
The principal object of this invention is to provide an improved metallic tooth implant, which is capable of overcoming the difficufties envisaged in the prior art.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a tooth implant that can be incorporated in the human jaw by a simple, two-stage procedure.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide an improved metallic tooth implant that requires less time to incorporate in the human jaw as compared to the prior art.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide an improved metallic tooth implant that is less costly and affordable iby the common citizen.<br>
One more object of this invention is to provide an improved metallic tooth implant that is resilient enough to considerably dampen the shock load of chewing and biting while being transferred from the tooth / teeth to the jaw bones.<br>
One other object of this invention is to provide an improved metallic tooth implant that is less prone to infection.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an improved tooth implant that can be incorporated in the human jaw by a simpler procedure, requiring less complex tooling and skill on the part of the dentist.<br>
One further object of the invention is to provide an improved tooth implant that is of a relatively robust design and construction, resulting in longer life of the said implant.<br>
Yet a further object of the invention is to provide an improved metallic tooth implant that is malleable enough for betteir Osseo - integration.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention that relates to an improved metallic tooth implant which comprises in combination:<br>
i) a' Root Screw', of the shape as depicted in Figure -1 of the accompanying drawings;<br>
ii) a ' Crown Screw", of the shape as depicted in Figure - 2 of the accompanying<br>
4<br><br>
drawings; iii) a' Healing Screw1, of the shape as depicted in Figure - 3 of the accompanying<br>
drawings;<br>
The subject invention also pertains to a novel,' two - stage' process of incorporating the improved tooth implant to the human jaw, which comprises:<br>
a)	drilling a pilot hole in the human jaw;<br>
b)	incorporating tapped threads in the above pilot hole;<br>
c)	measuring the depth of the drilled and tapped holes to the required depth;<br>
d)	fastening the 'Root Screw1 to the tapped hole in the jaw;<br>
e)	fixing the 'Healing Screw1 on the 'Root Screw', and allowing healing to take place<br>
over the requisite period;<br>
f)	removing the 'Healing Screw" from the 'Root Screw*, and replacing it with the<br>
'Crown Screw1, upon healing;<br>
g)	capping the 'Crown Screw" by known method, to round off the process.<br>
In accordance with this invention, incorporation of the tooth implant is achieved through the above, relatively simple stages, using lesser components and coarser threads, which allows it to be completed over a shorter period of time. This renders the process less prone to infections, besides making it more cost effective by reducing both components and labour contents. This is a marked improvement over the earlier known processes wherein extremely fine threads and larger number of components were used. The process, too constituted of more than two steps, made use of sophisticated equipment and tools requiring a high degree of training and skill. All these resulted in the known process to be costly beyond affordable limits for a common citizen, besides being more conducive to infections.<br>
The novelty of the invention essentially lies in a) the design of the implants, making the incorporation possible in just two stages, resulting in minimum invasion and healing time,<br>
5<br><br>
b) the material of the implant, which is better suited for the application, being malleable and better suited for absorbing shock load and Osseo-integration and c) the simpler process requiring simple tools and a level of skill far basic than that of the prior art.<br>
CP Titanium (Titan - 12 or equivalent) has been found to be available indigenously and has proved to be bio-compatible by implanting in bones of living animals. The relevant mechanical strength of this material, particularly its tensile strength, hardness and modulus of elasticity has been found to conform to the requirement of tooth implant material. The blood and tissue compatibility of the material has been proved by many researchers; both in India and outside of it, including findings of the inventors over last fifteen years of research.<br>
The improved metallic tooth implant of the present invention may be described with reference to Fig. A to C of the accompanying drawings, whereas the other figures, namely Figs. D to J shows the different tools and gauges used for the process as described hereinabove. The different items may be enumerated as hereinbelow: A - ROOT SCREW, incorporated inside the jawbone after drilling and tapping a suitable threaded hole for the same; B - CROWN SCREW, which is fitted on to the tapped internal hole of the root screw, after the healing. The final capping is built on this crown screw; C -HEALING SCREW, which is assembled on to the internal tapped hole of the root screw A, immediately on fitting the same into the tapped hole made on the jawbone. This is easy to remove and reassemble, and the wound can be treated and managed by doing so if, as and when required; D - SCREW DRIVING WRENCH, used for driving the root screw into the tapped hole in the jawbone; E - TAP DRIVING WRENCH, used for making the tapped thread in the pilot hole drilled in the jawbone; F-TAP, for forming the threads in the pilot drill made in the jawbone; G, H, I - adapter wrenches for manipulating the implant inside mouth cavity, particularly in areas   relatively difficult to access;   J - DEPTH GAUGE, for<br>
6<br><br>
measuring the depth of the drilled hole in the tooth, to ensure that the invasion is neither more or less than what is required.<br>
The sizes of the tooth implants may be customised depending on individual tooth profile on the one hand. On the other hand, a 'standardised' size or sizes of implants can also be mass-produced, based on data collected from sufficient number of measurement of sizes and mapping of profiles of human jawbone. Also, special types of thread profiles can be designed for compensating for abnormalities in the bone structure and compositions, like spongy bones or some other such abnormality.<br>
The material of the tooth implant can also be any metal or alloy or non - metal, other than Titanium (Titan - 12 or equivalent) with equivalent mechanical properties and bio-compatibility. Advantages of the present invention :<br>
As mentioned earlier, the present invention is capable of removing drawbacks of the prior art, making tooth impart and the process of incorporating the same in human jawbones simpler and more reliable.<br>
1.	The tooth implant can be incorporated in just two steps. This is less time-<br>
consuming, and therefore less prone to infections;<br>
2.	The material of the tooth implant is Titanium or its alloy with Vanadium and/or<br>
Aluminium  which  has  bone  inducing  property and  is  suitable  for Osseo-<br>
4<br>
integration.<br>
3.	The material for the implant is better suited to transfer shock load of chewing to<br>
jawbones, due to its inherent mechanical properties;<br>
4.	The process makes use of simple tools, and requires fundamental skills for<br>
incorporation of the implants to human jawbones making it more affordable;<br>
7<br><br>
5. Due to all advantages listed above, the tooth implant and the process of incorporating it in to human jawbone are more convenient, safe, aesthetic and economical.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to the specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without deviating or departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus the disclosure contained herein includes within its ambit the obvious equivalents and substitutes as well.<br>
