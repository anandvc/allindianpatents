IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE LIQUID PHASE ACYLATION OF AROMATIC<br>
COMPOUNDS Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the liquid phase acylation of aromatic compounds by an acylating agent using a solid catalyst comprising metal oxide(s). The present invention particularly relates to an improved process for the acylation of aromatic compounds using a reusable solid catalyst comprising metal oxide(s). Background of the invention<br>
Friedel Crafts type acylation of aromatic compounds by various acylating agents, using homogeneous Lewis acid catalysts, such as AlClo, BFi, ZnCl2 and other metal chlorides and protonic acid catalysts such as H2SO-4, HiPO HF, etc., are well known in the art [G. A. Olah, in Friedel Crafts and related reactions: vol III, Acylation and related reactions, Wiley-Interscience Publ., New York, 1964].<br>
US Patent 5,476,970 granted to Rains et al. Discloses a homogeneous liquid phase process for the acylation of R1R2R6H4 by R3R4H6COCl, wherein R\, R2, R3 and R4 are chemical groups using FeCl3 catalyst at high pressures. French Patents FR 2768728 (1999) and FR 2768729 (1999) of Baudry et al, disclose liquid phase homogeneous process for the benzoylation of anisole by benzoyl chloride using rare earth halides or uranyl halide.<br>
Japanese patent JP 08277241, A2 (1996) of Kunikata discloses a liquid phase process for the acylation of phenol by phenyl acetyl chloride using a homogeneous AlClo catalyst. A use of AlClo as a homogeneous catalyst is also disclosed by Oono for the acylation of toluene with acetyl chloride at high pressures in Japanese patent JP 09059205, A2 (1997). Japanese patent JP 20000086570, A2 (2000) of Shoji et al discloses a homogeneous liquid phase process for the acylation of toluene by acetyl fluoride using HF-BFi as a catalyst.<br>
The main disadvantages of the Friedel - Crafts type acylation processes based on the use of the above mentioned homogeneous acid catalysts are:<br>
1.	The separation and recovery of the dissolved acid catalysts from the liquid reaction<br>
mixture is difficult.<br>
2.	The disposal of the used acid catalysts creates environmental pollution.<br>
3.	The homogeneous acid catalysts also result in problems such as high toxicity, corrosion,<br>
spent acid disposal and also require use of more than the stoichiometric amounts.<br>
Liquid phase processes for the acylation of aromatic compounds by acyl halides using solid catalysts is also well known in the art.<br><br>
NF 47/01<br>
Japanese patent JP 01089894, A2 (1995) to Myata et al discloses a liquid phase<br>
process for the acylation of toluene with benzoyl chloride using ammonium chloride treated H-beta zeolite catalyst under reflux for 3 hours to get para acylated toluene with 28% yield. French patent FR 2745287, Al (1997) of Barbier et al discloses a liquid phase acylation of anisole by benzoyl chloride under reflux using neodymium chloride deposited on montmorillonite K - 10 clay.<br>
Vincent et al (ref Tetrahedron Lett., 35, 1994, 2601) disclose that H - ZSM-5 zeolite can catalyze the acylation of phenol and anisole by benzoyl chloride at 120Â°C for 5 hours but not the acylation with benzoyl chloride of benzene and naphthalene.<br>
Acylation of aromatic compounds involves the electrophilic substitution of H from the aromatic nucleus of the aromatic compound. It is well known in the prior art that the electrophilic substitution is favoured by the presence of electron donating groups such as OH, alkyl, alkoxy, phenoxy, amine, alkyl amine, SH, etc., in the aromatic compound. Whereas the electophilic substitution is inhibited by the presence of electron withdrawing groups such as halo, nitro. cyano. Carboxy, aldehyde, etc., in the aromatic compound [G. A. Olah, in Friedel Crafts and related reactions Wiley-Interscience Publ., New York, 1963].<br>
While some limitations of the homogeneous acid catalysed processes are overcome in the prior art heterogeneous solid catalysed processes described above, the acylating activity of the solid acid catalysts used in the prior art processes is low, particularly for acylating aromatic compounds not containing electron donating groups, such as benzene, naphthalene etc. Both the prior art homogeneous and heterogeneous acid catalysts are highly moisture sensitive, and hence demand moisture free or thoroughly dried reactants, solvents and catalyst for Friedel-Crafts type acylation processes. In the presence of moisture in the reaction mixture, both the above homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts show poor activity in the Friedel-Crafts type acylation processes. Hence there is a need for finding more efficient, reusable and also moisture insensitive solid catalyst for the acylation of aromatic compounds, which overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art discussed above. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a liquid phase process for the acylation of aromatic compounds including those which do not contain electron donating groups, using a solid catalyst, which has high activity when, the aromatic ring activating groups (electron donating groups like alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxy, phenoxy, etc.) are present in the aromatic ring to be acylated and also when the ring activating groups in the aromatic ring to be acylated are absent, such that reaction temperature is low and/or reaction time is short.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a liquid phase process for acylation of<br>
aromatic compounds using a solid catalyst that is easily separable and reusable in the<br>
process.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a liquid phase process for the<br>
acylation of aromatic compound that is insensitive the presence of moisture in the<br>
reaction mixture.<br>

In a further embodiment of the invention, the catalyst support comprises a zeolite material selected from the group consisting of microporous zeolites (pore size 
In another embodiment of the invention, the solvent when used is selected from the group consisting of dichloroethane, nitrobenzene, nitromethane, chlorobenzene, n-hexane, n-heptane and n-octane. Detailed description of the invention<br>
It is observed that the catalyst used in the invention has a high activity in the acylation of aromatic compounds not only when electron donating groups, which is the aromatic ring activating group, is present in the aromatic ring to be acylated, but also when it is absent. Without being bound by the proposition, it is believed that this leads to lowering of the reaction temperature and reaction time requirements.<br>
Another advantage observed is that the solid catalyst used can be separated and reused repeatedly in the process. It is also observed that the reaction rates are high even in the presence of moisture in the reaction mixture. Pretreatment of the solid catalyst with a hydrogen halide is essential in order to activate the catalyst.<br>
The catalyst is supported on a meso or macroporous catalyst carrier selected from alumina, silica, silica-alumina, inert metal oxides, zeolites, and zeolite like materials. The zeolite material is selected from the group consisting of microporous zeolites (pore size 
In general, micropores have diameter below Inm, mesopores have diameter between Inm and 20nm and macropores have diameter above 20nm. The catalyst supported on a<br>
NF 47/01<br>
microporous catalyst carrier is used generally when the both reactants have minimum<br>
molecular diameter or critical size of less than 0.7 nm. The mesoporous or macroporous catalyst carriers can be used irrespective of the size of the reactants. The reaction is carried out in a stirred batch reactor fitted with a reflex condenser and an arrangement for bubbling inert gas through the reaction mixture. Such arrangements are known in the art for liquid phase reactions.<br>
In the reaction, the main product formed is the acylated aromatic compound of the formula (R1R3R4) - M - Y - (R5R6R7) while HZ is formed as a byproduct wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, M, Y, R5, R6, and R7 and Z are as described above.<br>
The process of the invention can be carried out with or without a non-aqueous solvent selected from dichloroethane, nitrobenzene, nitromethane, chlorobenzene, n-hexane, n-heptane and n-octane. The role of the solvent is to dissolve the solid reactant or reactants and thereby facilitate the reaction there between. The solvent is not necessary when both the reactants are liquid at reaction conditions. It is observed that the solvent when used is not converted during the process.<br>
The inert gas is bubbled continuously through the reaction mixture in order to remove the byproduct form reaction mixture and thereby prevent or minimise reverse reaction. This helps to shorten the time of the reaction. The reaction takes place even in the absence of the inert gas but requires a longer time period and leads to incomplete conversion.<br>
The reflux condenser fitted with the reactor is to condense the reactants and/or the solvent and to return them to the reaction mixture and allow the inert gas that is continuously bubbling through the reaction mixture to escape along with the reaction byproduct. The reaction pressure is normally above atmospheric pressure thereby allowing the reaction to proceed at a temperature higher than the normal boiling point of the reactants and/or solvent with increase in reaction pressure.<br>
The catalyst used is heterogeneous with respect to the reaction mixture and can be removed from the reaction mixture by simple filtration and after washing with solvent or liquid aromatic compound which is to be acylated, recycled to the reaction mixture. The catalyst activates both the reactants and thereby increases the rate of the acylation reaction. During the pretreatment of the catalyst, the catalyst surface is changed by partial halidation causing modification of the active sites and/or creation of new active sites on the surface thereof. The pretreatment of the catalyst is critical to activate the catalyst. The pretreatment of the catalyst can be effected by:<br><br>
NF 47/01<br>
1.	contacting the solid catalyst with hydrogen halide gas in a closed vessel at room<br>
temperature for an effective period to activate the catalyst,<br>
2.	by passing a mixture of hydrogen halide and nitrogen or any other inert gas over the solid<br>
catalyst in a glass reactor at or above room temperature for a period of above O.OShours;<br>
3.	by passing a hydrogen halide gas with or without an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon,<br>
helium or the like through the reaction mixture containing the aromatic substrate, with or<br>
without the solvent, and the catalyst, in a stirred reactor at a temperature above about<br>
room temperature for a period above about 0.05 hours and then flashing the reaction<br>
mixture with an inert gas to remove physically adsorbed or absorbed hydrogen halide in<br>
the reaction mixture.<br>
The present invention is described with respect to the following examples which are illustrative and are not to be taken as limiting the scope of the invention. Definition of terms used in the examples:<br>
Conversion of reactant (%) = mole % of the reactant converted in the process. All the ratios of the aromatic compound to the acylating agent are in terms of mole ratios. All the solid catalyst to acylating agent and solvent to aromatic compound ratios are in terms of weight ratios.<br>

After the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature (30Â°C) and the products and the unconverted reactants present in the reaction mixture, after separating the solid catalyst from it by filtration, were analyzed by a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector, using a SE 30 column and hydrogen as a carrier gas.<br>

Advantages of the invention:<br>
The process of the invention has the following advantages over the prior art homogeneous acid catalysed processes for the acylation of aromatic compounds. 1    The catalyst used is a heterogeneous solid catalyst and hence can be separated from the reaction products simply by filtration.<br>
2.	The separated catalysts can be reused a number of times in the process of the invention.<br>
3.	The catalyst is non-corrosive.<br>
The process of the invention can be differentiated from prior art processes bsed on the use of solid acid catalyst for the acylation of aromatic reactions.<br>
1.	The activity of the catalyst used in the invention is high thereby increasing the speed of<br>
reaction and reducing the time required for completion of the reaction.<br>
2.	The catalyst of the invention can be reused a number of times in the process of the<br>
invention and shows high activity in the process even after repeated use.<br>
3.	The process of the invention can be used for the acylation of both small and large size<br>
aromatic compounds with both small and large sized acylating agents to obtain the<br>
corresponding acylated aromatic compounds.<br>
4.	When the inert gas is bubbled through the reaction mixture continuously, the byproduct<br>
formed is removed continuously thereby preventing or minimising the reverse acylation<br>
reaction This results in speeding up of the time required for the reaction.<br>
5.	By using pressures of greater than or equal to 1 atm., the reaction can be carried out at<br>
temperatures higher than the normal boiling point of either the reactants or the solvent,<br>
thereby shortening the reaction period. The inhibition of the reaction is avoided or<br>
minimised due to strong adsorption of the reactants, products or solvent on the catalyst.<br>
6 The process of the invention is effective even for the acieration of benzene which does not contain any aromatic ring activating electron donating group such as alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxy, etc. The rate of reaction is rapid at mild reaction conditions and hence the time for reaction is short.<br>
7. The process of the invention results in rapid acylation of aromatic compounds even when the reaction mixture contains moisture. The catalyst is not deactivated due to the presence of moisture in the reaction mixture. Thus, unlike prior art homogeneous and solid acid catalysts, the catalyst of the invention does not require moisture, free conditions tdTje active. This results in saving of costs towards removal of moisture from the reaction system or the reactants.<br><br>
NF 47/01<br>
8.   The catalyst of the invention is acidic and basic in nature, the process of the invention can<br>
be used  for acylating both acid sensitive aromatic compounds and basic aromatic compounds.<br><br><br><br>
