Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein.<br>
The chemical naming conventions used herein are illustrated for the compound of Example 1: <br>
which is designated l-{4-[2-((lR,3R,5S)-3-amino-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-8-yl)ethyl]piperazin-l-yl}ethanone using the commercially-available AutoNom software (MDL Information Systems, GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany). The designation (\S,3R,5R) describes the relative orientation of the bonds associated with the bicyclic ring system. The compound is alternatively denoted as l-{4-[2-(3-enrfo-arnino-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-8-yl)ethyl]piperazin-l-yl}ethanone. All of the compounds of the invention in which R2 is -NRaRb are in the endo configuration.<br>
Synthetic Procedures<br>
In one method of synthesis<br><br>
, (Formula Removed)<br><br>
 a tropanamine of formula (la)<br>
(la) is prepared by reductive amination of a tropanone of formula (lb):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
where the variables R1, A, W, and n are as defined above.<br>
Typically compound (lb) is reacted with a large excess, between about 15 and about 25 equivalents, of ammonium formate in an inert diluent, such as methanol or<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
ethanol. A small amount of water, about 0.1 to about 0.2 volume equivalents with respect to methanol or ethanol, is typically included in the inert diluent. The reaction, which is conducted in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, typically palladium or palladium hydroxide on carbon, provides intermediate (la) in the endo configuration with high stereospecificity. Typically the ratio of endo to exo configuration of the product (la) is greater than about 99:1. The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature between about 10 and about 30 °C for about 12 to about 72 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. The product can be purified by conventional extraction procedures.<br>
Alternatively, tropanamine (la) can be prepared from tropanone (lb) according to the two step process illustrated in Scheme A:<br>
Scheme A<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
whereQ represent hydrogen or an ammo-protecting group P".<br>
According to the process of Scheme A, tropanone (lb) is first contacted with between about 1 and about 1.5 equivalents of a protected amine NHP2Q (1) in the presence of between about 1 and about 1.5 equivalents of a reducing agent and about 0.5 equivalents of acetic acid to provide the protected tropanamine (Ic). The protecting group P2 is advantageously selected as benzyl or diphenylmethyl. Useful protected amines (1) include benzylamine, dibenzylamine, and diphenylmethylamine. Dichloromethane is typically used as the inert diluent for this reaction. Alternative diluents include ethers such as dimethoxyethane. The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature between about 10 and about 30 °C for about 12 to about 72 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. Typical reducing agents include sodium triacetoxyborohydride, '     sodium borohydride, and sodium cyanoborohydride.<br><br>
In a second step, the protected tropanamine (Ic) is deprotected by conventional procedures. For example, when P2 is benzyl or diphenylmethyl, the protecting group(s) can be removed by reduction using, for example, hydrogen or ammonium formate and a group VHI metal catalyst, such as palladium on carbon, to provide compound (la).<br>
The tropanone intermediate (lb) is advantageously prepared from readily available starting materials according to the process of Scheme B where the bicyclic ring formation and amine coupling are accomplished in the same reaction step.<br>
Scheme B<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
As shown in Scheme B, 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran (2), which has been hydrolyzed to succinaldehyde (3) in an aqueous acidic environment is contacted with between about 1 and about 1.5 equivalents of the amine (H) and a slight excess, for example, about 1.1 equivalents of 3-oxopentanedioic acid (4), commonly 1,3-acetonedicarboxylic acid. The reaction is conducted in the presence of an excess, for example between about 3 and about 6 equivalents, of a buffering agent such as sodium acetate or sodium hydrogen phosphate, to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture between about 4 and about 6. The reaction mixture is typically heated to between about 40 and about 50 °C for about 1 to about 4 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. The product (lb) is extracted by conventional procedures.<br>
Compounds of formula (lb) in which W is a moiety of formula (a)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein Z is NC(O)R4orNS(O)2Rs can alternatively be prepared from compounds of formula (lb) in which W is a moiety of formula (a) wherein Z is NH, i.e. compounds wherein W is piperazinyl, by reactions with conventional reagents under standard<br><br>
conditions. For example, when Z is NC(O)CH3, acetic anhydride may be used as the reagent for the acylating reaction. When Z is NS(O)2CH3, methanesulfonyl chloride may be used to prepare a compound of formula (lb) from a compound of formula (lb) in which W is piperazinyl.<br>
The amines of formula (U) are either commercially available or can be prepared from commonly available starting materials by procedures known to those skilled in the art. Further details regarding specific reaction conditions and other procedures for preparing a compound of formula (I) or intermediates thereto are described in the examples below.<br>
Accordingly, in a method aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (la) or a salt thereof, the process comprising:<br>
(a)	reacting a compound of formula (lb) with at least 15 equivalents of ammonium formate in the presence of a transition metal catalyst; or<br>
(b)	reacting a compound of formula (lb) with a protected amine of formula NHP2Q in the presence of a reducing agent, followed by removing the protecting group or groups;<br>
to provide a compound of formula (la) or a salt thereof. In a second method aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (lb) or a salt thereof, the process comprising:<br>
(a)	hydrolyzing 2,5-dimemoxytetrahydrofuran in an aqueous acidic medium; and<br>
(b)	reacting the product of step (a) with a compound of formula (II) and 3-oxopentanedioic acid in the presence of a buffering agent;<br>
to provide a compound of formula (lb) or a salt thereof.<br>
The compounds of the invention are useful intermediates for the preparation of 5-HT4 receptor agonists. For example, compounds of formula (la) can be reacted with l-isopropyl-lH-indazole-3-carboxylic acid to provide indazole-carboxamide 5-HT4 receptor agonist compounds, for example the compounds described in US 2005/0197335, US 2006/0183901 or intermediates thereto.<br>
Compounds which are 5-HT4 receptor agonists are expected to be useful for<br>
treating medical conditions mediated by 5-HT4 receptors or associated with 5-HT4<br>
receptor activity, i.e. medical conditions which are ameliorated by treatment with a 5-HT4<br>
receptor agonist. Such medical conditions include, but are not limited to, irritable bowel<br>
syndrome (TBS), chronic constipation, functional dyspepsia, delayed gastric emptying,<br>
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastroparesis, diabetic and idiopathic gastropathy, post-operative ileus, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and drug-induced delayed transit In addition, it has been suggested that some 5-HT4 receptor agonist compounds may be used in the treatment of central nervous system disorders including cognitive disorders, behavioral disorders, mood disorders, and disorders of control of autonomic function.<br>
In particular, such compounds are expected to increase motility of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and thus are expected to be useful for treating disorders of the GI tract caused by reduced motility in mammals, including humans. These GI motility disorders include, by way of illustration, chronic constipation, constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (C-TBS), diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis, and functional dyspepsia.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following synthetic examples are offered to illustrate the invention, and are not to be construed in any way as limiting the scope of the invention. Abbreviations not defined below have their generally accepted meanings.<br>
Reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers (Aldrich, Fluka, Sigma, etc.), and used without further purification. Reactions were run under nitrogen atmosphere, unless noted otherwise. Progress of reaction mixtures was monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC), analytical high performance liquid chromatography (anal. HPLC), liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LCMS), and gas liquid chromatography (GC), the details of which are given below and separately in specific examples of reactions. Reaction mixtures were worked up as described specifically in each reaction; commonly they were purified by extraction and other purification methods such as temperature-, and solvent-dependent crystallization, and precipitation. Characterization of reaction products was routinely carried out by mass and 'H-NMR spectrometry. For NMR measurement, samples were dissolved in deuterated solvent (D2O, CDCI3, or DMSO-o^), andlH-NMR spectra were acquired with a Varian Gemini 2000 instrument (300 MHz) under standard observation conditions.<br><br>

Detector wavelength: 214, 254, and 280 run.<br>
Example 1: Synthesis of (lR,5S)-8-[2-(4-acetyIpiperazin-l-yI)ethyl]-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one<br>
Concentrated hydrochloric acid (50 mL) was added to a solution of 2,5-dimethoxy tetrahydrofuran (490.2 mL, 3.78 mol) in water (1200 mL). The resulting yellow solution was stirred at about 70-72°C for about 2 h.<br>
1-(2-Arninoethyl)piperazine (546.4 mL, 4.16 mol, 1.1 equiv.) was added to a solution of sodium acetate (1225.5 g) dissolved in water (3700 mL) at 15°C. Concentrated hydrochloric acid (350 mL) was added slowly keeping the internal temperature below 25°C. After cooling the mixture to 15°C, 3-oxopentanedioic acid (607.8 g, 4.16 mol) was added, and the solution temperature again cooled to 15°C. The aqueous yellow solution prepared above was added slowly over about 10 min, and the resulting yellow mixture was stirred at about 20°C for about 30 min until carbon dioxide evolution slowed. The mixture was stirred at 40-45°C for 2 h and the color of the reaction mixture turned dark brown.<br>
The mixture was cooled to about 15°C. Aqueous sodium hydroxide (50%, ~470 mL) was added in portions, keeping the temperature below 25°, until pH 13 was reached. Sodium chloride (600 g) was added and the mixture was stirred to complete dissolution. The product was extracted with dichloromethane (DCM) (1 x 2000 mL, 2 x 1500 mL). The combined organic phases were dried, filtered and the solution concentrated to 2500 mL.<br>

The DCM and aqueous phases were separated. Gas chromatography analysis revealed that there was no remaining product in the DCM phase. The aqueous phase was<br>
basefied to pH 14 by the portionwise addition of aqueous phase sodium hydroxide (50% in water, about 500 mL), keeping the internal temperature below 25°C. The product was extracted with DCM (3x1500 mL), and the collected organic phases (dark brown) were combined, dried, filtered through celite, and distilled to produce the title compound as a viscous brown oil (650 g, 94% purity by gas chromatography). 1H NMR (CDCI3, 300 MHz) 5ppm: 3.65 (t, 2H), 3.56 (m, 2H), 3.48 (t, 2H), 2.78-2.47 (m, 10H), 2.23-2.02 (m, 4H), 2.10 (m, 3H), 1.6l(m, 2H); 13CNMR (CDCI3, 75MHz) 5 ppm: 209.81, 168.90, 59.10, 57.83, 53.83, 53.22, 48.01, 47.40, 46.19, 41.30, 27.80, 21.28.<br>
