				<td>PROCESS AND DEVICE FOR FORMATION OF MINERAL WOOL<br>
AND MINERAL WOOL PRODUCTS<br>
The invention relates to techniques for formation of mineral fibers or other<br>
thermoplastic materials through the process of internal centrifugation combined with<br>
drawing by a gaseous current at high temperature. It applies in particular to the<br>
industrial production of glass wool intended to be used, for example, in the<br>
composition of thermal and/or acoustic insulation products.<br>
Small diameter fibers of glass and other thermoplastic materials have been<br>
used in a variety of applications including acoustical or thermal insulation materials.<br>
When small diameter glass fibers are assembled into a web, (referred to<br>
interchangeably herein as a "blanket," "batt" or "wool pack"), glass fibers which<br>
individually lack strength or stiffness can be resin-bonded, and formed into a batt<br>
which is quite strong, lightweight, highly compressible and resilient. Insulation batts<br>
can be faced with paper or plastic, or unfaced.<br>
The fiber-formation process to which the invention relates consists of feeding<br>
a thin stream of molten glass to a centrifuge, also called a fiberization spinner, turning<br>
at high speed and perforated on its periphery by a very large number of orifices<br>
through which glass is sprayed in the form of filaments under the action of centrifugal<br>
force. These filaments are then subjected to the action of a high-temperature and<br>
high-speed annular drawing current along the wall of the centrifuge. This current thins<br>
them down and transforms them into fibers. The fibers formed are carried along by<br>
this gaseous drawing current towards a receiving mechanism generally consisting of<br>
a gas-permeable strip. A binder required to bond the fibers into a wool product is<br>
sprayed onto the fibers as they are drawn downward. The fibers are then collected<br>
and formed into a batt. This process is known as "internal centrifugation,"<br>
The centrifugal blast, attenuation glass fiberization technique, generally<br>
described above, has been used commercially for many years in the production of<br>
glass fiber building insulation batts and blankets, and a substantial percentage of<br>
glass fiber insulation manufactured at the present time is produced utilizing this<br>
technique. Details of various forms of this process are disclosed, for example, in U.S.<br>
Pat Nos. RE 24,708; 2,984,864; 2,991,507; 3,007,196; 3,017,663; 3,020,586;<br>
3,084,381; 3,084,525; 3,254,977; 3,304,164; 3,819,345; 4,203,774; 4,759,974; and<br>
5,743,932, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
This process has undergone several improvements, some of them relating in<br>
particular to the fiberization spinner, others to the means of generating the annular<br>
drawing current, using a specific type of burner, for example. See in particular EP-B-0<br>
189 354, EP-B-0 519,797; WO 97/15532 concerning this last point.<br>
Glass fiberization is extremely complex and requires the balancing of a large<br>
number of variable parameters. Many of the details of known techniques will not be<br>
repeated herein, reference, instead, being made to the above patents for such<br>
disclosures. However, certain limited aspects of the prior art will be considered,<br>
especially those concerning the present invention.<br>
In the centrifugal blast attenuation process, the burner pressure, as well as the<br>
attenuating gas speed proximate to the spinner wall are important to an optimization<br>
of the fiber attenuation. Spinner design and operation are also important factors,<br>
particularly in view of the relatively short life of current spinner designs and the<br>
extremely high cost of spinner replacement<br>
Concerning the fiberization spinner, patent FR 1,382,917 (application February<br>
27, 1963) describes a fiberization device whose principle is still widely used: the<br>
molten material is led to a basket whose vertical wall contains orifices through which<br>
the material is sprayed onto the wall of a turning body, attached to the basket, and<br>
contains a great many orifices. This wall is called the "band" of the fiberization<br>
spinner. In order to obtain good quality fiberization the orifices are distributed in<br>
annular rows and the diameters of the orifices vary according to the row to which they<br>
belong, with this diameter decreasing from the top of the band to the bottom.<br>
In the context of the invention, the "top" of the centrifuge is defined in reference<br>
to the centrifuge in cenirifugation position, i.e. according to a substantially vertical<br>
axis (of rotation).<br>
The spinners used in early centrifugal blast attenuation equipment were typically<br>
of a diameter of about 200 mm and had a peripheral wall which typically included<br>
4,000-6,000 holes through which the molten glass passed to form the primary glass<br>
streams subjected to attenuation by the annular blast. It was perceived that there<br>
were practical limits to the pull rate per spinner orifice for maintaining acceptable fiber<br>
quality, the maximum rate per orifice ranging between about 0.9 and 1.4 Kg/day.<br>
Nonetheless, the economic demands for increasing production of a given line usually<br>
resulted in an increase in pull rate despite the deterioration in product quality.<br>
In an effort to increase the output of a spinner of given diameter, the number of<br>
holes in the peripheral wall of the spinner has been increased to about 23,000, and<br>
the spinner diameter has been increased to about 400-600 mm. See U.S. 4,759,974.<br>
Although some increase in the pull rate has been achieved, there are long<br>
established beliefs in the industry that there are practical limits to orifice density<br>
increases controlled by factors such as the necessity of maintaining discrete glass<br>
streams emerging from the periphery of the spinner and other potential<br>
manufacturing problems.<br>
Improvements have been made to this basic principle, as shown in particular<br>
in patent FR 2,443,436 where mechanisms make it possible to obtain a laminar flow<br>
of the molten material from the top to the bottom of the spinner band.<br>
A further important factor is the fineness (average diameter) of the fibers. It<br>
is well established that for a given density of a blanket, the finer the fibers, the greater<br>
the thermal resistance of the layer. An insulating product comprising finer fibers can<br>
accordingly be thinner with the same insulating value as a thicker product of coarser<br>
fibers. Or, likewise, a product of finer fibers can be less dense than one of coarse<br>
fibers of the same thickness and have the same insulating value.<br>
In the shipping and packaging of insulation batt and blanket products, high<br>
compressibility is preferred. It is desirable to compress the batt for shipping and then<br>
have it recover rapidly and reliably to the desired size. Current batt insulation<br>
products are limited in the amount of compression possible while still attaining<br>
adequate recovery. When the product is compressed, the binder holds firm while the<br>
fibers themselves flex. As the stress upon the fibers increases due to excessive<br>
compression, the fibers break. When fibers break, cracks typically initiate at locations<br>
of "stress-rising defects", such as cracks, blemishes, or other weak points in the fiber<br>
material. The smaller the fiber diameter, the faster a crack can propagate from a<br>
stress-rising defect through the cross-section and lead to breakage.<br>
White finer fibers have been deemed desirable for their economic and<br>
insulating efficiencies, modem centrifugal Wast techniques have not been able to<br>
produce a blanket having an average fiber diameter of much less than 3.9 microns<br>
without unacceptably reducing the ability of such a blanket to recovery from<br>
compression. While not being committed to any one theory, it is believed that current<br>
spinner and burner designs limit artisans from making finer fibers without incurring<br>
a high number of stress-rising defects in the fibers. These small cracks and<br>
imperfections generally prevent the blanket or batt made with small fibers from<br>
recovering an acceptable amount of its original thickness. Accordingly, there remains<br>
a need in the industry for fiber insulation products, such as batts and blankets, which<br>
contain fibers of less than 4 micrometers in average diameter, but which also provide<br>
adequate recovery after being compressed, such as when packaged in a roll or a<br>
polymer film. There also remains a need in the insulation industry for a centrifugal<br>
blast attenuation process for producing higher strength, finer glass and polymer<br>
fibers.<br>
Thus the goal of the invention is to improve the device and the process of<br>
fiberization through internal centrifugation of mineral fibers. This improvement<br>
focuses in particular on the quality of the fibers obtained and on an increase in the<br>
yield of the process.<br>
In accordance with this object, fibers can be produced within a less aggressive<br>
fiber attenuating environment so as to enable small diameter fibers of less than 3.5<br>
microns to be used in insulation products, without sacrificing high quality or<br>
acceptable recovery after compression. In a further embodiment of the methods of<br>
this invention, a glass material is provided, which is melted and disposed in a spinner<br>
. The glass material is centrifuged through a plurality of its orifices to form a<br>
multiplicity of glass streams. The glass streams are attenuated with a gas current<br>
adjacent the exterior of the spinner to form glass fibers having an average diameter<br>
of no greater than 3.5 microns. The gas current is produced by a burner internal<br>
pressure of no greater than about 10-25 (niches water) (250-635 mm CE "colonne<br>
d'eau"), and preferably less than 23 (inches water) (580 mm CE). These small fibers<br>
are then combined with a resin to form an insulation product having an ASTM C 686<br>
parting strength of at least about 100g/g, which exhibits a substantial recovery of its<br>
nominal thickness following compression.<br>
Compared with current insulation products, such as insulation batt made with<br>
glass fibers having an average diameter of about 3.9 microns or greater, the present<br>
insulation products have a cotton-like touch feel which does not cause noticeable<br>
itching or irritation when in contact with human skin. As used herein, "insulation<br>
products" include unlaced ami faced batts, blankets and rolls. Insulation products<br>
desirably include a resinous binder, but this is not always required, so long as the<br>
product has some cohesiveness, and is not a loose fill insulation product. Insulation<br>
products can be used for composite reinforcement, sound insulation and may be<br>
compressed or rendered board-like by adding additional materials. Certain<br>
embodiments of this invention, when compared to conventional batt insulation<br>
products, can provide up to 10% higher thermal-insulating performance for the same<br>
density, or at least about a 20% reduction in density for the same insulating<br>
performance or R-value. These innovative products also produce an enormous<br>
amount of cost savings over similar R-value commercial batts, due to smaller glass<br>
material costs.<br>
In another example of this invention, a glass fiber insulation product is produced<br>
by melting a glass material and centrifuging ft through a plurality of spinner orifices<br>
to form a plurality of glass streams. The glass streams are then attenuated with a<br>
gas current into glass fibers having an average diameter of no greater than about 3.5<br>
microns, followed by combining the fibers together into an insulation product having<br>
the following characteristics: an ASTM C 686 parting strength of at least about 100<br>
g/g; an ASTM C 167 product gram weight of about 70-100 g/R2; and an ASTM C167<br>
thickness recovery of about equivalent to, or better than, that of an insulation product<br>
having substantially similar external dimensions made from glass fibers having an<br>
average diameter of about 3.9 microns, with less cutting and floor dust than a 3.9<br>
micron average diameter product.<br>
The preferred methods of using centrifugal, blast attenuation, glass fiberization<br>
techniques described in this disclosure employ such improvements as more spinner<br>
orifices for providing more and smaller initial glass streams and/or tower fiber<br>
attenuating hot gas speeds, preferably using conventional combustion air and glass<br>
flow rates. It is believed that these techniques make the fiber attenuation more gentle<br>
and greatly reduce shocks to the glass fibers so that they are less fragile, even when<br>
produced in very small fiber diameters formally not employed in the manufacture of<br>
glass fiber batt and roll insulation.<br>
A preferred method uses a device provided by the invention for internal<br>
centrifugation of mineral fibers including a centrifuge equipped with a peripheral band<br>
perforated with orifices distributed over a plurality of annular zones arranged on top<br>
of each other (assuming that the centrifuge is in centrtfugation position) which<br>
includes at least two annular zones where the number of orifices per unit of surface<br>
area (NS) differs by an amount greater than or equal to 5%, in particular greater than<br>
or equal to 10%, and even 20%.<br>
In a preferred method of realizing the invention, the annular zone containing the<br>
greatest number of orifices per unit of surface area is located below another annular<br>
zone containing a lower average number of orifices per unit of surface area,<br>
assuming that the centrifuge is in fiberization position.<br>
The term "annular zone" is used to define a zone of the band of the centrifuge<br>
contained between two perpendicular planes of the axis (of rotation) of the centrifuge.<br>
In the context of the invention, such an annular zone is defined as a region where the<br>
number of orifices per unit or surface area is substantially constant over the entire<br>
part of the periphery of the band contained in the said annular zone.<br>
The number of orifices per unit of surface area, NS, is defined as the number<br>
of orifices contained in an element of the surface of the annular zone, in particular on<br>
the order of a square centimeter, in relation to the surface area of this element of the<br>
surface. The number of orifices per unit of surface area is considered to be<br>
substantially constant if it varies by less than 0.5% over all of the elements of surface<br>
of a single annular zone. An annular zone may include a single orifice per vertical<br>
segment, but it usually contains several of them, in particular from 4 to 15. The term<br>
"vertical segment" refers to a part of the annular zone limited on the vertical axis by<br>
each of the planes defined above, as long as an average of only one orifice on a<br>
horizontal axis is observed there, assuming that the centrifuge is in fiberization<br>
position.<br>
Mineral fibers are conventionally manufactured with a centrifuge where the<br>
number of orifices per unit of surface area is constant over the entire height of the<br>
centrifuge band. In fact, a conventional centrifuge is perforated through electrical<br>
discharge machining, wife a comb composed of electrodes distributed in line where<br>
th3 pitch between electrodes is constant. After simultaneous perforation of orifices<br>
in a vertical column, the comb is moved to carry out the perforation of the next<br>
column, after moving the comb along the band by a distance corresponding to the<br>
horizontal gap between the center of consecutive holes.<br>
This technique permits very precise perforation and the variations in the number<br>
of orifices per unit of surface area are extremely low, specifically less than 1 per one<br>
thousand.<br>
A conventional centrifuge generally contains between 2000 and 40,000 orifices,<br>
specifically for average diameters of the centrifuge of 200 min to 800 mm,<br>
respectively.<br>
It has proven to be possible to Increase significantly the quality of the fiber mat,<br>
in particular its mechanical properties, while obtaining a very significant reduction in<br>
the consumption of energy, and thus the yield of the fiberization process, using a<br>
device prepared according to the invention.<br>
This effect is especially notable in that, at constant pull rate, it is known that<br>
energy consumption decreases when the number of orifices for the same band height<br>
increases, because the more the molten material is divided, the less energy is<br>
required to draw it When the number of orifices is increased for the same band<br>
height with a conventional centrifuge, however, the quality of the fiber mats produced<br>
does not increase, and even tends to decrease, while with the device prepared<br>
according to the invention it is possible to improve the properties of the products and<br>
the yield of the process at the same time.<br>
Recall that in the text, reference was made to a centrifuge observed in the<br>
position of centrifugation, i.e., with the band, including the orifices, arranged in a<br>
substantially vertical manner, around the axis along which the molten material is<br>
carried during fiberization. The molten material is carried through the "top" of the<br>
centrifuge in this position. The base of the centrifuge is substantially horizontal and<br>
the annular zones are parallel to this base and are superimposed on each other in<br>
this arrangement.<br>
A preferred centrifuge according to the invention contains at least two<br>
superimposed annular zones, the lower one having a greater number of orifices per<br>
unit of surface area than the one located above it. In a preferred method of realization<br>
the centrifuge includes at least three superimposed annular zones and each of these<br>
zones includes a greater number of orifices per unit of surface area than the one in<br>
the closest annular zone located above the annular zone considered.<br>
According to a preferred method of realization the orifices of each zone are<br>
grouped in rows, with a diameter of orifice (d) substantially constant in each annular<br>
zone and decreasing from one annular zone to another, from the top to the bottom<br>
of the peripheral band of the centrifuge in centrifugation position.<br>
In the invention, it is also advantageous that at least two adjacent rows have<br>
orifices of different diameters, and more specifically, that the rows have, from the top<br>
to the bottom of the peripheral band, decreasing diameters of orifices (generally all<br>
orifices of a single row have the same diameter). Thus one can anticipate, from the<br>
top to the bottom, n row(s) of orifices of a given diameter then p row(s) or orifices of<br>
a smaller diameter, then t row(s) of orifices of a still smaller diameter, etc. with n, p<br>
and t =1.<br>
For example, one could have a first annular zone, ZA1, consisting of n rows a<br>
second, ZA2, consisting of p rows, and a third, ZA3, consisting of t rows.<br>
By thus establishing a sort of decreasing "gradient" in the size of orifices from<br>
top to bottom, an improvement in the quality of fiberization has been observed. Thus<br>
it has been possible to reduce the differences in the way in which filaments coming<br>
from the highest rows were fiberized in relation to those from the lowest: this<br>
"gradient" permits a development of primary filaments exiting the orifices and a<br>
drawing process that limits crossing of trajectories, and thus impact, between the<br>
fibers being drawn from different rows of orifices, hence the improved quality<br>
observed.<br>
This configuration is especially adapted to the production of less dense mineral<br>
wools.<br>
In certain cases, on the other hand, one wants to encourage impact between<br>
fibers in order to reduce their length. These cases correspond to the production of<br>
dense mineral wools, particularly suitable for panels used in roofing. In these cases<br>
one could, for example, alternate the size of the orifices from one zone to another,<br>
and one can thus anticipate, from the top to the bottom, n row(s) of orifices of a given<br>
diameter, then p row(s) of orifices of a greater diameter, then t row(s) of orifices of a<br>
diameter smaller than those of the orifices of the row located above, etc.<br>
It would be advantageous to have the rows spaced apart from each other by a<br>
distance between 1 and 2 mm, in particular from 1.2 to 1.8 mm, with preferably a<br>
pitch from one row to another of 1 to 2 mm, for example 1.2 to 1.6.<br>
Preferably, the diameter (d) of at least a part of the orifices of the centrifuge is<br>
at the most 1.5 to 1.2 mm. in particular from 1.1 to 0.5 mm, for example between 0.9<br>
and 0.7 mm.<br>
According to another method of realization of the preferred device according to<br>
the invention, the distance, D, between the centers of the neighboring orifices closest<br>
to a single annular zone is substantially constant over all of a single annular zone and<br>
this distance, D, varies from one zone to another by at least 3%, or even at least 5%<br>
and even 10% or more, and decreases from top to bottom, assuming that the<br>
centrifuge is in fiberization position.<br>
Preferably the distance, D, is between 0.8 and 3 mm, for example between 1<br>
and 2 mm and even between 1.4 and 1.8 mm.<br>
It would be advantageous that the preferred centrifuge according to the<br>
invention be chosen with an average diameter, DM, less than or equal to 800 mm,<br>
in particular at least 200 mm.<br>
The preferred centrifuge is preferably devoided of a bottom in its lowest part.<br>
According to this method of realization, the centrifuge is joined with a basket in which<br>
the molten glass spreads, preferably joined by mechanical assembling.<br>
According to a preferred method of realization, the preferred device according<br>
to the invention includes at least one mechanism of generating a high-temperature<br>
gaseous drawing jet in the form of an annular burner, in particular as described in the<br>
patents EP 0189 354 and EP 0 519 797 by the applicant.<br>
It would be advantageous that the annular burner be a tangential burner which<br>
includes a mechanism of giving the gaseous drawing jet a tangential component in<br>
relation to the outer horizontal edge of the centrifuge, fa particular as described in<br>
patent EP 0 189 354 by the applicant.<br>
Thus it is possible to obtain an inclination angle of the gaseous drawing jet in<br>
relation to the axis of the burner.<br>
It is also possible to use a heating mechanism internal" to the centrifuge, of the<br>
internal burner type. This may play different roles, in particular terminating the<br>
thermal conditioning of the molten glass in the "basket" of the centrifuge (term<br>
explained below, using the figures), maintaining at an appropriate temperature the<br>
glass reserve in the centrifuge in order to continuously remeit-the fibers which are<br>
susceptible to adhering to the external walls of the centrifuge.<br>
It may be advantageous to combine the "external" heating method, of the<br>
annular inductor type, with this internal heating method; this also permits better<br>
control of the temperature of the glass reserve and the remetting of the adhered<br>
fibers. In fact, it has been observed that, generally, at low pull rates it was sufficient<br>
simply to have recourse to an internal burner, while at high pull rates, the annular<br>
inductor proved to be necessary, and the possible addition of the internal burner is<br>
beneficial.<br>
When using the here above mentioned preferred centrifuge, it is advantageous<br>
that the hot gaseous drawing be accomplished by an annular burner whose<br>
parameters of operation may be selected as follows.<br>
- preferably, it is possible to regulate the temperature of the gases leaving the<br>
burner to at least 1350°C, in particular at least 1400°C and, for example, between<br>
1400 and 1500°C, in particular between 1430 and 1470°C. The temperature is then<br>
adjusted according to the type of composition of the mineral fibers, in particular<br>
according to its viscosimetric behavior,<br>
- it is advantageous to regulate the speed of the gases exiting the burner to<br>
at least 200 m/s, measured just at the exit of the lips of the burner, in particular at<br>
values between 200 and 295 m/s,<br>
One can have recourse to an inductor to heat the lowest zone of the centrifuge<br>
and avoid or limit the creation of a temperature gradient over the height of the<br>
centrifuge.<br>
Fibers with fewer stress-rising defects in their surfaces and cross-sections are<br>
thought to be more resillient under compression, resulting in higher thickness recovery<br>
measurements than would be expected in resin-bonded batts having fibers of 3.5<br>
microns, or less in average diameter. Accordingly, products made with these<br>
processes are ideal for the high compression storage and transportation needs of<br>
modem insulation product packaging.<br>

For the purposes of this specification, use of the term "glass" is intended to<br>
include any of the glass mineral materials, such as rock, slag and basalt, as well as<br>
traditional glasses such as, for example, E-glaas, S-glass, C-glass, E-CR-glass, A-<br>
glass, A.R. glass (alkali- resistant, L-glass (lead), D-glass (dielectric), M-glass (high-<br>
modulus), with commercial C-glass being the most preferred. While glass material<br>
is preferred, this invention has useful application to "thermoplastic materials" which,<br>
in addition to glass and other mineral fibers, include polymeric materials, such as<br>
polyester, polyethylene and polypropylene fibers. It is expected that both polymer<br>
and glass fibers could be used simultaneously in the insulation products of this<br>
invention. And finally, although uniform straight fibers can be used herein, this<br>
invention also contemplates the use of "irregular fibers', such as, hollow, kinked, and<br>
curly fibers, and fibers having irregular or different cross-sectiona! sizes and/or<br>
geometries, such as, for example, small and large round, round and triangular,<br>
irregular and round, square and hoHow, kinked and round, etc. Such irregular shapes<br>
and geometries are known to produce a more uniform lattice structure and volume<br>
filling, which allows for higher recovery ratios after being compressed, independent<br>
of the number of defects in the fibers themselves. Irregular shaped fibers also<br>
reduce irritation, and may make the product less dusty. "Irregularity" can also be<br>
produced by using more than one molten glass composition having differing<br>
coefficients of thermal expansion, differing melting points, differing viscosities, or<br>
differing mechanical strengths, used in all the fibers simultaneously, or alternatively<br>
among different fiber groups.<br>
It is further understood that the insulation products of this invention can be<br>
encapsulated within an exterior plastic layer as disclosed by Schelhom et al., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,277,955. which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The<br>
insulation products of the invention can be, for example, seated, packed or rolled.<br>
Figure 1 thus represents a partial view of a system of internal centrifugation<br>
using hot gas drawing adapted based on those known from prior art and described,<br>
in particular, in patents EP 91 866, EP 189 354 and EP 519 797, which can be<br>
referred to for more details on the general aspects of mis method of fiberization.<br>
The system includes a spinner or centrifuge 1 attached to a shaft 2. The shaft<br>
and the centrifuge are animated by a movement of rapid rotation using an engine not<br>
pictured. The shaft 2 is hollow ana the glass: in the molten state flows from the<br>
feeding mechanism not represented in shaft 2 up to the "basket" 3 in which the<br>
molten glass spreads. The basket 3 is also carried along by rotation such that the<br>
molten glass is sprayed onto the peripheral wall 4 which is perforated with orifices<br>
and, from there, in the form of voluminous glass streams 6 on the peripheral wail 7,<br>
usually named "band" of the centrifuge 1, which will form on this wall a permanent<br>
reserve of motten glass to supply the circular orifices 14 perforated into said wall. This<br>
watt 7 is inclined by about 5 to 10° in relation to the vertical. Of very many circular<br>
orifices 14 arranged in rows, are coming out the flow cones 8 extending into pre-<br>
fibers 15, projected into the annular gaseous current emitted from the burner 9.<br>
Under the effect of this current, these pre-fibers stretch, their terminal portion<br>
generating discontinuous fibers 10 which are then collected under the centrifuge.<br>
The system also contains a blowing column 11 which creates a "cloud of gas"<br>
surrounding the annular gas current generated by the burner 9. There is also an<br>
option to use an induction current ring 12 under the centrifuge 1 and/or an internal<br>
burner not pictured.<br>
Under the standard conditions, the gap between the lines passing through the<br>
center of two parallel rows of orifices, termed the pitch, is constant over the entire<br>
height of the band. Under these conditions, the distance between the centers of<br>
neighboring orifices in the same row is also constant<br>
Thus, in a standard centrifuge, the number of orifices per unit of surface area<br>
is constant over the entire surface of the band.<br>
Under standard operating conditions, such a device permits obtaining fibers of<br>
an average diameter of at least 2 microns, particularly about 3 to 12 microns.<br>
As discussed hereinafter, the number, size and density of the spinner orifices<br>
14, as well as the attenuation gas parameters are important to the fiberizing of high<br>
strength, small fibers less than about 3.5 microns in average dimension, and<br>
preferably less titan about 3.0 rnicrons in average diameter. Such fibers are desirably<br>
distributed in insulation products, such that at least about 40%, and preferably about<br>
50-75% of the fibers have a cross-sectional dimension or diameter which is less than<br>
the average diameter or dimension targeted. A typical distribution for a 2.1 average<br>
diameter, glass fiber, batt insulation product made in accordance with the principles<br>
of this invention is described below in Table 1.<br>
Table 1: Fiber Spectrums (2.1 micron ave. diameter sample)<br>
A "burner" such as an electric resistance heater, waste gas recycled supply,<br>
coal, gas or fuel on furnace or burner, pressurized air, steam, or any gaseous result<br>
of combustion products, can be used io provide a gas current. It is expected,<br>
however, that a annular internal combustion burner 9 of substantially conventional<br>
construction be disposed above the wall of the spinner in this preferred embodiment.<br>
The burner 9 includes an annual blast nozzle 64 spaced above the spinner peripheral<br>
wall 7 so as to preferably direct an annual blast downwardly adjacent to the<br>
peripheral wall 7 to intercept and attenuate the multiplicity of glass pre-fibers 15<br>
issuing from the orifices 14. The burner 9 includes a preferred metal casing<br>
enveloping a refractory liner defining an annual combustion chamber into which an<br>
air-fuel mixture is introduced at inlet. The blast nozzle communicates with the<br>
combustion chamber and is formed by inner and outer nozzle lips 54 and 56. The<br>
blast nozzle lips 54 and 56 respectively include preferred internal cooling channels<br>
into which a cooling liquid such as water is introduced by inlet for circulation to an<br>
outlet.<br>
In accordance with the main important aspect of the invention, the outer nozzle<br>
lips 54 and 56 are spaced at a set distance from one another, as shown in FIG. 1, to<br>
provide a less aggressive fiber attenuating environment from conventional<br>
combustion air and gas flow rates of conventionally employed burners. Such can be<br>
achieved by slightly spreading the burner lips width from about 7.7 mm to greater<br>
than about 8.0 mm, and preferably about 8.1 -8.5 mm, which reduces the attenuating<br>
hot gas speed even though the air flow and gas flow into the burner are not<br>
significantly changed from conventional ranges. For example, if a conventional burner<br>
employs a burner lips width of about 7.7mm, an air flow rate of 64,958 ft3/hr. (1840<br>
m3/h) and a gas flow rate 4.038 ft3/hr. (114 m3/h), as shown in Table 2 below, the<br>
burner of this invention could reduce the gas current flow rate, even with the<br>
equivalent air and gas flow rates, (67,600 ft3/hr) (1915 m3/h) and 4,000 ft3/hr. (113<br>
m3/h), respectively) by increasing the burner lips width to about 8.2mm. This can be<br>
verified by the burner inside pressure, which is known, through experimentation, to<br>
be reduced from about 21.8 inches water (555 mm CE) to about 18.8 (inches water)<br>
(480 mm CE)for 2.9 micron fibers, and about 21.6 (inches water) (550mm CE) for 2.1<br>
micron fibers. This is unexpected, since it was earlier believed that increasing burner<br>
pressure and blast velocity to achieve greater attenuation was the only adequate<br>
means to produce finer fibers. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,759,974; Col. 7, lines 49-57. Of<br>
course, lowering the air flow rate, gas flow rate, increasing the size of the combustion<br>
chamber, and/or decreasing the amount or rate of combustion, will also have an<br>
impact on lowering the attenuating gas speed, and should be considered the practical<br>
equivalent of increasing the burner lips width. All of these gas current speed<br>
adjustment techniques can be used together or separately. Comparative examples<br>
are given in Table 2 and illustrate these unexpected results.<br>

square feet with the product density reduction.<br>

(6) Cutting, Floor and frying Dust: Internal Procedure (Dust measurements<br>
Using the Gullfiber Dust Shaking Machine, fibers are counted with a Phase Contrast<br>
Optieal Microscope or Scanning Electron Microscope. A vacuum cleaner with an air<br>
flow of 18m3/hr is used to collect knife and floor dust. The fibers are collected on a<br>
glass fiber WHATMAN QF/A 70 mm fitter. A 37mm fitter is used for flying dust. All<br>
filters are weighed before and alter collection. A 28cm knife is used, with a maximum<br>
sample thickness of 150mm.).<br>
(7) These results were obtained with the spinner IS-4 at glass pull rate of<br>
14 MT/day on same production line.<br>
In order to maintain the heat content of the spinner and fibers during<br>
attenuation, an optional high frequency induction current ring 12 can be provided just<br>
below the spinner in concentric relation thereto and having an internal diameter<br>
somewhat larger than the spinner to avoid interference with the downward flow of<br>
fibers entrained by the annular blast. An optional auxiliary blast can be generated by<br>
an annular blowing crown €4 disposed outboard of the blast nozzle lips 54 and 56<br>
and connected to a source of pressurized gas such as air, steam or combustion<br>
products. The hollow shaft 2 preferably includes several fixed concentric internal<br>
tubes. The innermost pair of these tubes defines an annular cooling passage through<br>
which cooling water is circulated while the outermost pair define an annular passage<br>
through which a combustible mixture can be passed and ignited to preheat the basket<br>
3 prior to startup of the spinner. The fibers 41 generated by the spinner and the<br>
gaseous blast pass downwardly into a receiving chamber or receiving hood 70 and<br>
are deposited in the form of a blanket 71 on a foraminous conveyor 72 as shown<br>
schematically in FIGS. 2 and 3. An optional suction box 74 beneath the conveyor 72<br>
withdraws the high volume of gases passing through the conveyor in a conventional<br>
manner. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, a plurality of fiberizing stations each having a<br>
spinner 20 are conventionally employed for the production of the blanket 71 and in<br>
the preferred form of the invention are arranged in a line along the longitudinal axis<br>
of the conveyor 72. The number of spinners 20 directing fibers onto a conveyor in<br>
an industrial installation might typically be six to ten spinners or more.<br>
For operation of the described apparatus, the centrifuge 1 including the basket<br>
3 thereof, is preheated in a well known manner utilizing the combustion of gases<br>
passing through shaft 2, the neat of the burner 9 and induction current ring 12 and<br>
Similar supplemental sources as may be necessary. With the spinner rotating at a<br>
predetermined speed and the burner 9 adjusted to provide a combustion chamber<br>
pressure resulting in a blast velocity sufficient to provide the desired attenuation and<br>
fineness of the fibers, the molten glass stream is introduced into the hollow spinner<br>
shaft 2 from a forehearth or other source of motten glass disposed above the spinner<br>
assembly. The stream of motten glass upon reaching the basket 3 flows along the<br>
bottom of the basket under the influence of centrifugal force and passes through the<br>
orifices of the basket 3 in the form of glass streams 6 which are directed onto the<br>
upper portion of the spinner peripheral waif 7.<br>
Under the influence of the stronger centrifugal force exerted at the wail 7, the<br>
glass passes through the multiplicity of small orifices 14 and issues at the exterior of<br>
the peripheral wall 7 in the form of a multiplicity of streams or pre-fibers 15 which are<br>
preferably immediately subject to the attenuating effect of the blast from the internal<br>
combustion burner 9 directed across the exterior of the wall. The pre-fibers 15 are<br>
maintained in an attenuabte condition by the elevated temperature of the blast for a<br>
time sufficient to effect attenuation thereof. The fineness of the attenuated fibers is<br>
regulated primarily by the control of the blast velocity which in turn is a function of<br>
burner pressure. This invention has shown that equal or lower burner pressure and<br>
blast velocity, results not only in finer fibers, but finer fibers which have fewer stress-<br>
rising defects. These techniques, unexpectedly, have been accomplished in the<br>
preferred embodiment without significantly altering the combustion air and gas flow<br>
rate to the burner 9, the glass composition, or overall nature of existing equipment.<br>
As a result, small fibers, substantially smaller on average than those currently<br>
employed in baits and blankets, can be used without sacrificing thickness recovery,<br>
even though the density or gram weight is at least abou 15% less.<br>
The spinner hole count, size and distribution are important factors in the<br>
preferred embodiment methods of this invention. While spinner speed (rpm) is<br>
desirably increased from about 1,975 to about 2,250 in Examples A1 and A2 of this<br>
invention, such has not been demonstrated to decrease spinner life, but to offer<br>
longer fiber. It has been found that the fiberization of small, less than about 3.5<br>
micron avenge diameter, glass fibers can be greatly improved by increasing the total<br>
holes from about 23,000 to at least about 25,000 holes, preferably to about 25,000-<br>
40,000, and most preferably to at least about 30,000 holes, white reducing the<br>
average diameter of the holes from about .86mm to less than about .8 mm,<br>
preferably to about .78mm. Additionally, it is desirable that all of the holes, have a<br>
maximum cross-sectional dimension of less than 1 mm. These spinner parameters<br>
create many more molten glass streams, which are smaller, for producing much<br>
smaller fibers. Examples of current production ("control") performance baft spinner<br>
specifications are described below in Table 3.<br>
Tabte 3: Additional Spinner Specifications<br>
* Example A1 employed the spinner, described in more detail in Table 4.<br>
The flow of attenuated fibers into the receiving chamber or receiving hood 70,<br>
as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, is accompanied by the induction of substantial amounts<br>
of air. Although the induced air tends initially to restrict the expansion of the veil of<br>
fibers flowing from the spinner, the rapid deceleration of the fibers within the receiving<br>
chamber produces a substantial expansion of the fiber veil and provides a relatively<br>
uniform distribution of the fibers amid the product and across the width of the<br>
conveyor. Although a binder spray, such as a phenolic resin, usually is applied to the<br>
attenuated fibers at the top of the receiving chamber in a conventional manner, the<br>
apparatus for applying the binder has been omitted in FIGS. 2 and 3.<br>

Comparative Examples A1 and A2 were carried out on insulation batts<br>
prepared in accordance with the fiberizing conditions of Table 2, and the spinner<br>
specifications of Table 3. White ASTM specifications were available for Gram<br>
Weight ami Thickness Recovery measurements, Thermal Conductivity and Parting<br>
Strength, similar specifications were not available for Cutting Oust, Floor Dust and<br>
Flying Dust, so these measurements were made by internal plant procedures using<br>
a Gulffiber dust shaking machine.<br>
It was further noted that the Gram Weight of identically shaped R-13 products<br>
made with conventional 3.9 micron diameter glass fibers and those made from 2.9<br>
micron average diameter (Example A1) and 2.1 micron average diameter (Example<br>
A2) fibers showed substantial reductions in density value, namely, the Gram Weight<br>
was reduced from about 104g/ft2 to 89g/ft2 for Example A1, and to 81g/ft2 for<br>
Example A2. This reduction in gram weight represents a significant potential material<br>
cost savings.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention the fiberization process uses a<br>
modified distribution of orifices on the band 7 of the centrifuge. A significant<br>
adaptation made in the context of this object of the invention appears on figure 4.<br>
Figure 4 represents a partial frontal view of the band 7 of the centrifuge 1,<br>
where the orifices 14 perforated in said band are shaded.<br>
In this figure are pictured the two superimposed annular zones ZA1 and ZA2,<br>
ZA2 being below ZA1 when the device is viewed in fiberization position. In the case<br>
pictured, each of these annular zones includes three circular rows of orifices 14. In<br>
the annular zone ZA1 the rows present a pitch P1, the orifices a diameter d1, the<br>
distance D1 separates the centers of the closest orifices 14, the distance between<br>
the closest edges of neighboring orifices is DB1, and the number of orifices per unit<br>
of surface area is NS1 in the zone ZA1. In the annular zone ZA2, these parameters<br>
are respectively P2, d2, D2, DB2, and NS2.<br>
The pitch between ZA1 and ZA2 is called Pt/2.<br>
Note on one hand that d2 is less than d1, and that P2 and D2 are, respectively,<br>
less than P1 and D1. As a result, NS2 is very much greater than NS1.<br>
This representation is in no way restrictive and a band 7 of a centrifuge 1 may<br>
contain more than two annular zones, each of said zones containing at least one<br>
series of orifices 14.<br>
In order to illustrate the value of the centrifuge according to the invention,<br>
comparative testing was performed, with, on one hand, a standard centrifuge, and on<br>
the other hand, a centrifuge according to the invention. The characteristics of the two<br>
centrifuges which were selected to have the same average diameter, DM, and the<br>
same band surface area, and an identical height of perforated band, are presented<br>
in table 4. Each of these centrifuges includes three annular zones each consisting<br>
of several rows of orifices of constant diameter and spacing in a row.<br>
Table 4: Centrifuge Design of Example B<br>
The number of orifices per row is noted as NO, and the number of orifices per unit<br>
of surface area, NS, is expressed herein as the number of orifices per mm2, where<br>
NS = NO/(tt.D.P)<br>
Note that the number of orifices per unit of surface area is constant for the<br>
standard centrifuge. In the case of the centrifuge according to the invention, it varies<br>
by annular zone and this number, NS, is lower than the one of the standard<br>
centrifuge for the highest annular zone, ZA1, and then higher than that of the<br>
standard centrifuge for the other annular zones, ZA2 and ZA3. Note that for the<br>
centrifuge according to the invention, the number of orifices per unit of surface area<br>
increases with the zone, from the top to the bottom of the centrifuge, by about 25 to<br>
30% from one zone to another.<br>
The two centrifuges were manufactured from the same alloy, known under the<br>
reference SG30, produced in particular by the company SEVA. The standard<br>
centrifuge was perforated using the electroerosion technique described above, while<br>
the orifices of the centrifuge according to the invention were perforated using electron<br>
bombardment. Laser perforation could also be considered.<br>
Products were manufactured with each of the centrifuges under equivalent puH<br>
conditions.<br>
The types of products manufactured, the conditions of fiberization and the<br>
mechanical properties measured on the products obtained by this Example are<br>
reported in table 5, below :<br>
Table 5: Product Properties of Example B<br>
The properties measured on products of the same type with each centrifiuge are<br>
also compared in Table 5.<br>
The thickness recovery is defined as the ratio (in %) between the thickness after<br>
compression test and the nominal thickness. It must be noted that the thickness of<br>
the product manufactured before compression testing is greater than the nominal<br>
thickness. In the case of the tests mentioned, the thickness of the product<br>
manufactured is 144 mm for a nominal thickness of 80 mm.<br>
From table 5 it can be deduced that the thickness of the fiber mat unloaded<br>
after 12 days of compression testing is about 90% of the original thickness<br>
(manufacturing thickness) of the fiber mat with the centrifuge according to the<br>
invention, and about 80% of the initial thickness with a standard centrifuge.<br>
To conduct the compression test above, panels of fiber mat are prepared after<br>
manufacture and loaded to obtain a compression rate of 8/1, i.e. in the case<br>
mentioned a compressed thickness of about 18 mm. After the compression time<br>
specified (12 days, 1 month), the panels are unloaded (4 panels are tested per<br>
compression time) and the average thickness after compression test is determined.<br>
The tensile strength is determined based on a test specimen in the form of ring<br>
cut with a punch in a mat of fibrous product. The "tensile strength" is expressed as<br>
the form of the tensite force (breaking force of the ring torn out by two circular and<br>
parallel mandrels 12.5 mm in radius, with a load speed of 300 mm/min) in relation to<br>
the mass of the test specimen and is expressed in gf/g.<br>
The test specimen, loaded at the start of the test, is a substantially elliptical toric<br>
ring of 122x76 mm long and short axes and 26 mm thickness of torr. 15specimens<br>
are tested by product. This test refers to norms BIFT 5012-76 and ASTM C 681-76.<br>
The tensite strength is measured on the product after manufacture and, in order<br>
to estimate the product's capacity for aging, after an autoclave test. The duration of<br>
the autoclave test is 15 minutes, at a temperature of 107°C, a pressure of 0.8 bar and<br>
humidity of 100%.<br>
From table 5 it may be observed that for a product of the same type, sharply<br>
improved mechanical properties are obtained with the device according to Example<br>
A compared to the standard device and at the same time, the energy needed to<br>
produce the fibers is significantly reduced.<br>
In fact, the pressure of the burner is lower, about 20% less with the centrifuge<br>
according to Example A compared to the results with the standard centrifuge. At the<br>
same time, the outputs of fluid, air and gas are relatively smaller, by about 10%. The<br>
energy yield of the process is thus very advantageously increased with the centrifuge<br>
according to this Example.<br>
The improvement in mechanical properties relates both to the thickness<br>
recovery, which is about 10% greater with the centrifuge according to the invention<br>
compared to products obtained with a standard centrifuge, and also the tensile<br>
strength, which is improved by about 20%.<br>
In addition from these remarkable results, it was noted that, unexpectedly, the<br>
increase in the number of orifices of the centrifuge does not have a negative effect<br>
on the life span of the centrifuge, when the latter is made according to the instructions<br>
of this Example.<br>
Under the fiberization conditions defined in table 5, the life span of the<br>
centrifuge according to the invention was about 370 hours and that of the standard<br>
centrifuge was about 300 hours.<br>
In the same way, it is noted that the quality of the products does not vary<br>
significantly with the time of use in fiberization of a spinner, although it might have<br>
been feared that the increase in the number of holes per unit of surface area may<br>
lead to accelerated aging of the centrifuge accompanied by a rapid deterioration in<br>
the properties of the product during fiberization with the same spinner.<br>
It is noted that the configuration described for the centrifuge according to this<br>
Example in table 4 is especially advantageous from a geometric point of view. In<br>
fact, while increasing the number of orifices in the centrifuge, the inventors were able<br>
to define a geometric configuration where the space between the edges of the<br>
orifices, DB1, is increased in relation to that of the standard centrifuge in the annular<br>
zone, ZA1, where the orifices have the largest diameter, D1, and where corrosion and<br>
erosion are the most active. In the median annular zone, ZA2, the space between<br>
edges of orifices, DB2, is identical in both configurations, and in the annular zone,<br>
ZA3, with the smallest diameter, D3, the configuration chosen permits decreasing tine<br>
distance between edges of orifices, DB3, which is not harmful because corrosion and<br>
erosion are not as great there.<br>
Thus, very advantageously, the mechanical properties of the centrifuge are<br>
preserved, and its life span can be maintained or increased compared to a standard<br>
centrifuge, while considerably increasing the number of orifices.<br>
The general advantages of the invention can also be illustrated by the<br>
estimations of the Thermal Performance (for fixed density) or density for fixed R-<br>
vaJue variation with average fiber diameter. The High Performance Batt product<br>
("HPB") and commercial Building Insulation product ("Current Bl" or "Control") gram<br>
weight comparison can be estimated, as follows, for some of the more popular R-<br>
rated products (thermal resistance or "R-rating" as measured by product thickness)<br>
(in)/thermal conductivity (BTU in/ft.hr . ºF)), for example, A1 and A2. Results for<br>
currently produced building batt insulation, ("Current Bl"), and high performance batt<br>
insulation ('HPB") products are provided FIGS. 6 and 7. For a fix product density, a<br>
decrease of the average glass fiber diameter can offer an increase in R-value. Figure<br>
6 shows the estimated variation of thermal insulation performance (variation of R<br>
values, in %) calculated for the same density, as the function of the glass fiber<br>
average diameter (in micrometer). The range "Current Bl" represents the actual<br>
situation for CertainTeed batt insulation production in the market. The range "HPB"<br>
depicts the estimated thermal resistance performance boost provided by this<br>
invention. Quite the same as FIG. 6, FIG. 7 shows the estimated variation of density<br>
(in %) for a fixed R-value, as the function of the glass fiber average diameter (in<br>
micrometer): for a fixed R-value, the product gram weight or density can be reduced<br>
when the average glass fiber diameter decreases. With batt products produced in<br>
accordance with this invention, smaller glass fibers result in reduced product gram<br>
weight for improved insulation performance. The curves of FIGS. 6 and 7 generally<br>
follow the pattern of estimated data points provided in Table 6.<br>
Table 6: Bett Gram Weight Comperison<br>
The process parameters for Examples A1 and A2 produced batts that were very<br>
soft to the touch and cotton-ball-like in texture, with virtually little itching upon skin<br>
contact. They both produced high thermal resistance values, similar to the current<br>
commercial production of 3.9 micron average diameter fibers, resulting in test results<br>
having the same R-value with a gram weight or density reduction of at least 12%, and<br>
preferably about 15-28%. The insulation products of Examples A1 and A2 were also<br>
comparable or better in ASTM C 167 thickness recovery to current production batt<br>
insulation. This is important since batt and roll products of densities less than<br>
2.5 lbs./ft3 are often highly compressed to a thickness much lower than their nominal<br>
thickness, at least about ½, and preferably about 1/7th to 1/12th, of their nominal<br>
thickness, for example when packed in order to reduce the storage and freight costs.<br>
The products are required to recover their nominal thickness at the job site after<br>
opening of the package. While it was formerly believed that reductions in the fiber's<br>
diameter in batt and roll products would improve the thermal and acoustic insulation<br>
properties of these products, it was rarely attempted in practice, since small average<br>
diameter fiber insulation typically failed to resume its nominal thickness after<br>
compression. As reflected in Examples A1 and A2 of this invention, full thickness<br>
recovery was achieved for both products, even though the product gram weight was<br>
dramatically reduced with the decrease in the average fiber diameter.<br>
From the foregoing, it can be realized that this invention provides improved<br>
insulation products composed of fine glass fibers having fewer defects. These<br>
products are less expensive to produce and recover their full thickness following<br>
compression, while also providing the same R-rating as higher density larger<br>
average diameter fiber insulation products. The processing techniques of this<br>
invention are capable of producing small fibers of less than about 3.5 micron average<br>
diameter with fewer stress-rising defects due to a combination of a spinner with more<br>
and smaller orifices and/or a gentler blast velocity. Although various embodvnents<br>
have been illustrated, this was for the purpose of describing and not limiting the<br>
invention. For example, the high strength fibers produced by the claimed processes<br>
of this invention could be useful in producing composite reinforcement, toose-fitl<br>
insulation, woven and non-woven fabrics, and can also be applied to plastic resin<br>
compositions to improve fiber performance. Various other modifications which will<br>
become apparent to one silled in the art, are within the scope of this invention<br>
described in the attached claims.<br>
