				<td>PLY-GBS MUTANT LYSINS<br>
[0001] This invention relates to the identification and use of phage associated<br>
lytic enzymes to rapidly and specifically detect or kill certain bacteria, such as Group<br>
B streptococci (GBS) bacteria.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Group B streptococci (GBS), or Streptococcus agalactiae, are a major<br>
cause of neonatal bacterial infection in the United States (Baker, C. J., and M.S.<br>
Edwards, "Group B streptococcal infections," p.1091-1156 in J. Remmington and J.<br>
O. Klein (ed.), Infectious diseases of the fetus and newborn infants, 5th ed. The W.<br>
B. Saunders Co. Philadelphia, PA (2001)). GBS are normally colonized in human<br>
genital and lower gastrointestinal tracts and can be vertically transmitted from mother<br>
to baby during a normal vaginal delivery. Common manifestations of GBS disease in<br>
neonates include sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia and joint infections. About 21% of<br>
pregnant women are vaginally colonized with GBS and a significant high percentage<br>
of babies develop symptoms associated with GBS infection. For example, sepsis<br>
occurs in 16 of 1,000 live births to women with GBS colonization, while only in 0.4 of<br>
1,000 live births to women without GBS colonization (Regan, J. A., M. A. Klebanoff,<br>
R. P. Nugent &amp; 7 other authors. 1996. Colonization with group B streptococci in<br>
pregnancy and adverse outcome. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 174:1354-1360).<br>
[0003] Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) is the primary prevention<br>
suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) because it can<br>
effectively reduce neonatal GBS colonization and early-onset infection (Centers for<br>
Disease Control and Prevention, "Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal<br>
disease: a public health perspective," Morbid. Mortal. Weekly Rep. 45: 1-24 (1996);<br>
and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "Prevention of perinatal group B<br>
streptococcal disease: revised guidelines from CDC," Morbid. Mortal. Weekly Rep.<br>
51: 1-22 (2002)). IAP is usually given to pregnant women colonized with GBS 4 hrs<br>
before delivery to prevent vertical transmission. However, there are many places in<br>
the world that GBS culture screening is not routine for pregnant women and<br>
universal administration of antibiotics may present a potential threat to neonates.<br>
-1-<br><br>
Antibiotic resistance is another major concern because some GBS clinical isolates<br>
are already found to be resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin (Fernandez, M.,<br>
M. Hickman, and C. J. Baker, "Antimicrobial susceptibilities of group B streptococci<br>
isolated between 1992 and 1996 from patients with bacteremia or meningitis,"<br>
Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42: 1517-1519 (1998); Centers for Disease Control<br>
and Prevention, "Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: revised<br>
guidelines from CDC", Morbid. Mortal. Weekly Rep. 51:1-22 (2002)). Thus, there is<br>
a need for a direct and effective alternative to IAP.<br>
[0004] One promising approach to the detection and treatment of pathogenic<br>
bacteria is the use of bacteriophage lytic enzymes as bacteriolytic agents.<br>
Bacteriophage lytic enzymes responsible for bacterial host lysis are also known as<br>
lysins. Many lysins can rapidly break down the bacterial cell wall in order to release<br>
progeny phage (Young, R. 1992. Bacteriophage lysis: mechanism and regulation.<br>
Microbiol. Rev. 56:430-481). Structurally, lysins are commonly found as modular<br>
proteins with an amino terminal domain that confers the enzymatic activity for a<br>
peptidoglycan bond and a carboxy terminal domain that confers binding specificity to<br>
a carbohydrate epitope in the bacterial cell wall (Loessner, M., K. Kramer, F. Ebel,<br>
and S. Scherer, "C-terminal domains of Listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage<br>
murein hydrolases determine specific recognition and high-affinity binding to<br>
bacterial cell wall carbohydrates," (Mol. Microbiol. 44:335-349 (2002); Lopez, R., E.<br>
Garcia, P. Garcia, and J. L. Garcia, "The pneumococcal cell wall degrading<br>
enzymes: a modular design to create new lysins?," MicroB. Drug Resist. 3:199-211<br>
(1997); Lopez, R., M. P. Gonzalez, E. Garcia, J. L. Garcia, and P. Garcia, "Biological<br>
roles of two new murein hydrolases of Streptococcus pneumoniae representing<br>
examples of module shuffling," Res. Microbiol. 151:437-443 (2002); Sheehan, M. M.,<br>
J. L. Garcia, R. Lopez, and P. Garcia, "The lytic enzyme of the pnemococcal phage<br>
Dp-1: a chimeric enzyme of intergeneric origin," Mol. Microbiol. 25:717-725 (1997)).<br>
Lysins are believed to provide at least one of the following enzymatic activities<br>
against a peptidoglycan substrate: muramidases, glucosaminidases, N-<br>
acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase and endopeptidases (Young, R., "Bacteriophage<br>
lysis: mechanism and regulation," Microbiol. Rev. 56:430-481 (1992)). Purified lysin<br>
from a bacteriophage can be applied exogenously to affect bacterial lysis (Loeffler, J.<br>
-2-<br><br>
M., D. Nelson, and V. A. Fischetti, "Rapid killing of Streptococcus pneumoniae with a<br>
bacteriophage cell wall hydrolase," Science. 294:2170-2172 (2001); Loessner, M., G.<br>
Wendlinger, and S. Scherer, "Heterogeneous endolysins in Listeria monocytogenes<br>
bacteriophages: a new class of enzymes and evidence for conserved holin genes<br>
within the siphoviral lysis cassettes," Mol. Microbiol. 16:1231-1241 (1995); Loessner,<br>
M., S. K. Maier, H. Daubek-Puza, G. Wendlinger, and S. Scherer, "Three Bacillus<br>
cereus bacteriophage endolysins are unrelated but reveal high homology to cell wall<br>
hydrolases from different bacilli," J. Bacterid. 179:2845-2851 (1997); Nelson, D., L.<br>
Loomis, and V. A. Fischetti, "Prevention and elimination of upper respiratory<br>
colonization of mice by group A streptococci by using a bacteriophage lytic enzyme,"<br>
Prot. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 98:4107-4112 (2001)).<br>
[0005] Lysins are normally very specific to the bacterial species from which the<br>
lysin derived phage was isolated (Fischetti, V. A. 2003. Novel method to control<br>
pathogenic bacteria on human mucous membranes. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 987:207-<br>
214; Fischetti, V. A. 2001. Phage antibacterials make a comeback. Nature<br>
Biotechnol. 19:734-735). Although the range of bacteria targeted by lysins is less<br>
restrictive than the corresponding bacteriophage, lysins still maintain a degree of<br>
specificity, having minimal effects on other bacteria including commensal organisms.<br>
While bacteriophage host ranges are largely restrictive, recognizing only one specific<br>
antigen on its bacterial host, phage lysins are less restrictive, recognizing a specific<br>
carbohydrate molecule common to the particular species of host bacteria.<br>
[0006] Bacterial resistance to phage lysins is believed to be less likely to arise as<br>
compared with bacteriophage adsorption for at least two reasons: first, bacterial lysis<br>
upon exposure to lysin is almost immediate, not giving bacteria much possibility for<br>
mutation and second, lysins bind to highly conserved molecules in the bacterial cell<br>
wall that are under selective pressure not to mutate. In contrast, bacterial resistance<br>
to many antibiotics is often easily identified. Furthermore, the problem with lysogenic<br>
conversion is reduced or eliminated with phage lysins, and animal testing and<br>
treatment can be performed effectively using lysins.<br>
[0007] There is an ongoing need for therapies and agents effective in the<br>
diagnosis and control of bacterial contamination, colonization and infection. In<br>
addition, compounds with bacteriocidal effects may be useful in the decontamination<br>
-3-<br><br>
of bacteria on inanimate surfaces and objects. The bactiophage lytic enzymes<br>
provided are useful in providing agents useful in the detection or killing of Group B<br>
streptococci (GBS) bacteria.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008] The present invention relates to bacterial lysins comprising a PlyGBS<br>
peptide variant having bacterial killing activity. For example, the PlyGBS peptide<br>
variant may be a PlyGBS mutant lysine having a lytic killing activity against a Group<br>
B streptococci bacteria that is greater than the killing activity of the PlyGBS peptide<br>
against the same bacteria.<br>
[0009] Lysins with improved lytic activity against GBS cells compared to the lytic<br>
activity of PlyGBS enzyme (SEQ ID NO:1) are disclosed. Hyperactive PlyGBS<br>
mutant lysins may provide greater killing activity against GBS cells compared with<br>
the PlyGBS protein alone, as evidenced by both in vitro and in vivo testing. The<br>
lysins may be mutant lytic enzymes derived from PlyGBS protein lytic mutant<br>
enzymes using DNA mutagenesis methods applied to the plyGBS gene.<br>
PolypeoPlyGBS mutant enzymes that display increased lytic activity against GBS<br>
protein are also identified and characterized.<br>
[0010] The killing activity of PlyGBS lysins, such as PlyGBS mutant lysins, can be<br>
quantified by performing an in vitro bacterial killing assay described in Example 3<br>
below, or by performing an in vivo bacterial killing assay described in Example 4<br>
below. A hyperactive PlyGBS mutant may provide at least 1.5-fold to about 40-fold<br>
greater lytic activity than PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) against GBS cells., at least about<br>
14-fold to about 40-fold greater lytic activity, or at least about 25-fold to about 40-fold<br>
greater lytic activity. Hyperactive PlyGBS mutant lysins include those selected from<br>
the group: PlyGBS 86-6 (SEQ ID NO:2), PlyGBS 80 (SEQ ID NO:3), PlyGBS 90-8<br>
(SEQ ID NO:4), PlyGBS 90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5), PlyGBS 94 (SEQ ID NO:8) and<br>
PlyGBS 95 (SEQ ID NO:9). PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) contains an N-terminal [amino<br>
acid (aa) 1-107] endopeptidase domain, a central (aa 150-394) muramidase domain<br>
and a C-terminal region (aa 395-443). Mutant PlyGBS86-6 (SEQ ID NO:2) (SEQ ID<br>
NO:2) has one amino acid change from aspartic acid to glutamic acid (D374E).<br>
-4-<br><br>
Mutant PlyGBS80 (SEQ ID N0:3) (aa 1-164) (SEQ ID N0:3) and PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ<br>
ID N0:4) (aa 1-138) (SEQ ID N0:4) are truncated mutants due to stop codons<br>
brought by nonsense mutations. PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) (SEQ ID NO:5) was<br>
derived from an out-of-frame deletion which deleted bp 424-1255 in plyGBS gene<br>
and as a result, it encodes first 141 amino acids of PlyGBS plus extra 13 amino<br>
acids (DGHALTIQSRRNG) due to the frame shift of the C-terminal region (bp 1256-<br>
1332) of plyGBS gene. Hyperactive PlyGBS mutant PlyGBS94 (SEQ ID NO:8)<br>
(SEQ ID NO:8) contains the N-terminal endopeptidase domain (first 146 amino<br>
acids) and is similar to mutant PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4) (first 138 amino acids)<br>
(SEQ ID NO:4). A similar level of lytic activity was observed in these two mutants.<br>
PlyGBS95 (SEQ ID NO:9) (SEQ ID NO:9) has an in-frame deletion of central<br>
muramidase domain (deletion between aa 147-348).<br>
[0011] The structures of certain PlyGBS mutant lysins are also disclosed.<br>
Several hyperactive PlyGBS mutants include truncation mutants that contain only the<br>
endopeptidase domain from the N-terminal region of PlyGBS and represent about<br>
one-third of the wild type PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) in length. These mutants may<br>
have 25-40 fold increase in specific activities compared to PlyGBS, and also may<br>
have a similar activity spectrum against several streptococcal species. PlyGBS has<br>
two putative catalytic domains and a C-terminal undesignated domain. Comparison<br>
of the PlyGBS mutants PlyGBS95 (SEQ ID NO:9) (SEQ ID NO:9) and PlyGBS94<br>
(SEQ ID NO:8) (SEQ ID NO:8) indicates that the deletion of the C-terminus has no<br>
significant effect on its specificity or on lytic activity. The hyperactive PlyGBS<br>
mutants PlyGBS94 (SEQ ID NO:8) (SEQ ID NO:8), PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5)<br>
(SEQ ID NO:5) and PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4) (SEQ ID NO:4) may have<br>
truncations in the central and C-terminal regions, and appear to be similar to<br>
lysozyme in that they only have a catalytic domain without a cell-wall binding<br>
domain. The endopeptidase domain present in these mutants is nearly identical to<br>
the CHAP domain recently identified in another lytic enzyme from GBS<br>
bacteriophage B30, PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) (Pritchard, D. G., S. Dong, J. R. Baker,<br>
and J. A. Engler, "The bifunctional peptidoglycan lysin of Streptococcus agalactiae<br>
bacteriophage B30," Microbiology 150: 2079-2087 (2004)). However, the CHAP<br>
domain by itself in these truncated mutants is not only active against GBS, but is<br>
-5-<br><br>
significantly increased in activity (from 25 to 40 fold) over the wild type PlyGBS (SEQ<br>
ID NO:1). Although CHAP domains are widely present in many phage lysins, none<br>
of these CHAP domains has been reported to have lytic activity without the<br>
association of a cell-wall binding domain.<br>
[0012] Biochemical characteristics of the hyperactive PlyGBS mutants, such as<br>
storage stability and optimum pH, have been compared with PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1).<br>
The mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) (SEQ ID NO:5) has its optimum activity<br>
when salt concentration is 50-100 mM, while the optimum NaCI concentration for<br>
wild-type PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) is around 200 mM. Notably, the mutant<br>
PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) (SEQ ID NO:5) maintains lytic activity against all the<br>
streptococcus species that are sensitive to PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1), even though the<br>
PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) (SEQ ID NO:5) mutant contains only one-third of the<br>
wild-type PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1).<br>
[0013] The hyperactive PlyGBS mutants are more lytically active than PlyGBS<br>
and can kill GBS at a faster rate than wild-type PlyGBS, providing an advantage for<br>
future intrapartum therapy that would require time-effectiveness. Hyperactive<br>
PlyGBS mutants may be administered in vivo, resulting in reduction of GBS<br>
colonization. For example, the hyperactive PlyGBS mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:5) (SEQ ID NO:5) was used in mouse vaginal model to test the efficacy of<br>
reducing GBS colonization in vivo. A single dose of PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5)<br>
(SEQ ID NO:5) reduced the GBS colonization from 5.54 logs (about 3.5x105 cfu per<br>
mouse on average) before treatment to 1.68 logs (less than 50 cfu per mouse) 4 hrs<br>
post-treatment. Administration of hyperactive PlyGBS mutants in vivo may be used,<br>
for instance, to reduce the neonatal GBS infection during delivery, providing an<br>
alternative approach to replace intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.<br>
[0014] Other systems, methods, features and advantages of the invention will be,<br>
or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following<br>
figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems,<br>
methods, features and advantages be included within this description.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0025] Definitions of certain terms used and their applicability to the disclosure<br>
are provided below.<br>
[0026] The term "hyperactive PlyGBS mutants" refers to PlyGBS mutant lysins<br>
with enhanced activity against GBS compared to PlyGBS enzyme under<br>
substantially identical testing conditions.<br>
[0027] The term "isolated" means at least partially purified from a starting<br>
material.<br>
[0028] The term "purified" means that the biological material has been<br>
measurably increased in concentration by any purification process, including by not<br>
limited to, column chromatography, HPLC, precipitation, electrophoresis, etc.,<br>
thereby partially, substantially or completely removing impurities such as precursors<br>
or other chemicals involved in preparing the material. Hence, material that is<br>
homogenous or substantially homogenous (e.g., yields a single protein signal in a<br>
separation procedure such as electrophoresis or chromatography) is included within<br>
the meanings of isolated and purified. Skilled artisans will appreciated that the<br>
amount of purification necessary will depend upon the use of the material. For<br>
example, compositions intended for administration to humans ordinarily must be<br>
highly purified in accordance with regulatory standards.<br>
[0029] The term "lytic enzyme genetically coded for by a bacteriophage" refers to<br>
a polypeptide having at least some lytic activity against the host bacteria.<br>
[0030] "Polypeptide" refers to a molecule comprised of amino acids which<br>
correspond to polypeptides encoded by a polynucleotide sequence which is naturally<br>
occurring. The polypeptide may include conservative substitutions where the<br>
naturally occurring amino acid is replaced by one having similar properties, where<br>
such conservative substitutions do not alter the function of the polypeptide (see, for<br>
example, Lewin "Genes V" Oxford University Press Chapter 1, pp. 9-13 1994).<br>
[0031] "A native sequence phage associated lytic enzyme" refers to a polypeptide<br>
having the same amino acid sequence as an enzyme derived from nature. Such<br>
native sequence enzyme can be isolated from nature or can be produced by<br>
recombinant or synthetic means. The term "native sequence enzyme" specifically<br>
encompasses naturally occurring forms (e.g., alternatively spliced or modified forms)<br>
-8-<br><br>
and naturally-occurring variants of the enzyme. In one example, the native<br>
sequence enzyme is a mature or full-length polypeptide that is genetically coded for<br>
by a gene from a bacteriophage specific for Group B streptococci (GBS).<br>
[0032] The term "about" used with reference to a quantity includes variations in<br>
the recited quantity that are equivalent to the quantity recited, for instance an amount<br>
that is insubstantially different from a recited quantity for an intended purpose or<br>
function.<br>
[0033] The term "effective amount" refers to an amount of an active ingredient<br>
sufficient to achieve a desired effect without causing an undesirable side effect. In<br>
some cases, it may be necessary to achieve a balance between obtaining a desired<br>
effect and limiting the severity of an undesired effect. The amount of active<br>
ingredient used will vary depending upon the type of active ingredient and the<br>
intended use of the composition of the present invention.<br>
[0034] A "variant polypeptide sequence phage associated lytic enzyme" means a<br>
functionally active lytic enzyme genetically coded for by a bacteriophage specific for<br>
Group B streptococci (GBS), or Streptococcus agalactiae, having at least 50%, 55%,<br>
60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or even at least<br>
99.5% amino acid sequence identity with a sequence described.<br>
[0035] "Percent (%) polypeptide sequence identity" with respect to the lytic<br>
enzyme polypeptide sequences identified here is defined as the percentage of amino<br>
acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues<br>
in the specific lytic enzyme polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and<br>
introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity,<br>
and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity.<br>
Methods for alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence<br>
identity are described below.<br>
PlyGBS Lysins<br>
[0036] Bacteriophage lysins with killing activity against Group B streptococci<br>
(GBS) bacteria are provided. Preferred bacteriophage lysins are hyperactive<br>
PlyGBS mutant enzymes of PlyGBS lysin with enhanced killing activity against GBS<br>
compared to PlyGBS activity and its variants. Several hyperactive PlyGBS mutant<br>
-9-<br><br>
enzymes with killing activity against GBS are identified and characterized in the<br>
examples described below. Other examples provide lysins with specific activity<br>
against other gram positive bacteria, which include variants and fragments of the<br>
lysins described.<br>
[0037] The phage muralytic enzyme, PlyGBS, maybe used to lyse GBS cells in<br>
vitro and in vivo, for example as described in Cheng, Q. et al., "Removal of group B<br>
streptococci colonizing the vagina and oropharynx of mice with a bacteriophage lytic<br>
enzyme," Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 49: 111-117 (2005). PlyGBS belongs to a<br>
group of bacteriophage lysins that can kill bacteria by digesting the bacteria cell wall,<br>
making cells susceptible to osmotic lysis. For example, in a mouse model, a single<br>
dose of PlyGBS can significantly reduce GBS colonization in both the vagina and<br>
oropharynx. Administration of a phage muralytic enzyme such as PlyGBS is a<br>
promising alternative to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis in order to reduce vaginal<br>
GBS colonization in pregnant women before delivery, or to decontaminate newborns<br>
at various body sites, thus reducing the incidence of GBS-associated neonatal<br>
infections.<br>
[0038] Lysins generally occur in a modular structure. The N-terminal module<br>
consists of a catalytic domain believed to possess the ability to break down the<br>
bacterial cell wall of certain bacteria. Ezymatic activities often associated with the<br>
catalytic domain are amidases, endopeptidases, glucosamidases and muramidases.<br>
The C-terminal module consists of a binding domain that is believed to have an<br>
affinity for a carbohydrate epitope on the target bacteria cell wall. The binding<br>
domain is believed to determine the specificity of the lysin.<br>
[0039] Bacteriophage lytic agents effective against GBS bacteria are provided,<br>
along with corresponding polypeptide and polynucleotide sequences relating to the<br>
same. Compositions comprising the lytic enzymes provided may be useful in the<br>
diagnosis, treatment, and decontamination applications relating to several types of<br>
gram positive bacteria, as described, including GBS bacteria. Methods of treatment<br>
and decontamination using compositions comprising the lytic enzymes, polypeptides<br>
or polynucleotide sequences also are disclosed.<br>
[0040] Hyperactive PlyGBS mutant enzymes exhibiting a lytic effect on BGS<br>
bacterial strains, and particularly, the lysins have killing activity against one or more<br>
-10-<br><br>
GBS bacterial species are described. The lysins include hyperactive PlyGBS mutant<br>
lysins comprise a polypeptide sequence having at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%,<br>
95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or greater homology to SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3,<br>
SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:8, or SEQ ID NO:9.<br>

enzymes as an antibacterial agent are incorporated herein by reference in their<br>

quantified by performing an in vitro bacterial killing assay described in Example 3<br>

Mutagenic PlyGBS Mutants<br>
[0043] Referring to the table in Fig. 1, hyperactive PlyGBS mutant lysins include<br>
lysins selected from the group consisting of PlyGBS 86-6 (SEQ ID NO:2), PlyGBS 80<br>
(SEQ ID NO:3), PlyGBS 90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4), PlyGBS 90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5), PlyGBS<br>
94 (SEQ ID NO:8) and PlyGBS 95 (SEQ ID NO:9). Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of<br>
PlyGBS and several mutants produced by random mutagenesis. PlyGBS (SEQ ID<br>
NO:1) contains an N-terminal [amino acid (aa) 1-107] endopeptidase domain, a<br>
central (aa 150-394) muramidase domain and a C-terminal region (aa 395-443).<br>
Mutant PlyGBS86-6 (SEQ ID NO:2) has one amino acid change from aspartic acid to<br>
glutamic acid (D374E). Mutant PlyGBS80 (SEQ ID NO:3) (aa 1-164) and<br>
PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ iD NO:4) (aa 1-138) are truncated mutants due to stop codons<br>
-11-<br><br>
brought by nonsense mutations. PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) came from an out-of-<br>
frame deletion which deleted bp 424-1255 in plyGBS gene and as a result, it<br>
encodes first 141 amino acids of PlyGBS plus extra 13 amino acids<br>
(DGHALTIQSRRNG) due to the frame shift of the C-terminal region (bp 1256-1332)<br>
of plyGBS gene.<br>
[0044] Two hyperactive PlyGBS mutant lysins were obtained from mutator strain<br>
E. coli XL-1 Red. The first, PlyGBS86-6 (SEQ ID NO:2), has a single point mutation<br>
resulting in the amino acid change from aspartic acid to glutamic acid (D374E). The<br>
PlyGBS86-6 (SEQ ID NO:2) mutant has a specific activity 14 fold higher than wild<br>
type PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1). The second mutant, PlyGBS80 (SEQ ID NO:3), has a<br>
stop codon in the center of plyGBS gene (Q164Stop) resulting in a truncated<br>
molecule. The PlyGBS80 (SEQ ID NO:3) mutant contains only the first 163 amino<br>
acids of wild type PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1), but has a specific activity 1.5-fold higher<br>
than PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1).<br>
[0045] Two hyperactive mutants were identified from PCR random mutagenesis.<br>
The mutant PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4) is similar to PlyGBS80 (SEQ ID NO:3) in<br>
that both are truncated mutants as a result of the incorporation of a stop codon. The<br>
PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4) mutant has the first 138 amino acids of PlyGBS (SEQ<br>
ID NO:1). Significantly, the PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4) mutant has a specific<br>
activity that is about 25-fold higher than the wild-type PlyGBS. Another mutant,<br>
PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5), does not include the region bp 424-1255 in the plyGBS<br>
gene. As a result, it encodes only the first 141 amino acids of PlyGBS (SEQ ID<br>
NO:1) plus an extra 13 amino acids due to the frame shift of the C-terminal region<br>
(bp 1256-1332) of plyGBS gene. This mutant has a specific activity that is about 40-<br>
fold higher than wild type.<br>
[0046] The two hyperactive mutants, PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) and PlyGBS90-<br>
8 (SEQ ID NO:4), were purified using Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography<br>
and the active fractions were pooled and analyzed on a gradient SDS-PAGE gel. As<br>
shown in Fig. 3, the PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) and PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4)<br>
mutants migrated close to regions for calculated molecular weight (17.0, 15.3 KDa)<br>
listed in Table 1. Fig. 3 shows a commassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel (4-20%<br>
gradient) for purified PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4) (lane 1), PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID<br>
-12-<br><br>
N0:5) (lane 2), and wild type PlyGBS (lane 3), with the molecular mass of the protein<br>
ladder presented in kilodaltons (KDa).<br>

PlyGBS Deletion Mutants<br>
[0047] PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) has two catalytic domains, an endopeptidase and<br>
a muramidase, and a C-terminal undesignated domain. (Cheng, Q., D. Nelson, S.<br>
W. Zhu, and V. A. Fischetti, "Removal of group B streptococci colonizing the vagina<br>
and oropharynx of mice with a bacteriophage lytic enzyme," Antimicrob. Agents<br>
Chemother. 49: 111-117 (2005)). Several of the PlyGBS mutants identified as<br>
hyperactive PlyGBS mutants are truncated mutants containing only one catalytic<br>
domain but still having higher activity than wild- type PlyGBS. Deletion mutants were<br>
designed based on the domain organization of PlyGBS. The deletion of C-terminus<br>
provides PlyGBS mutants that retain the specificity and lytic activity of the PlyGBS<br>
(SEQ ID NO:1) lytic enzyme. The deletion of C-terminus had no subtantial effect on<br>
its specificity or on lytic activity as illustrated by comparing the hyperactive deletion<br>
mutants PlyGBS95 (SEQ ID NO:9) and PlyGBS94 (SEQ ID NO:8). The hyperactive<br>
mutants (PlyGBS94 (SEQ ID NO:8), PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5), and PlyGBS90-8<br>
(SEQ ID NO:4)) have truncations in the central and C-terminal regions, and appear<br>
to be similar to lysozyme in that they only have a catalytic domain without a cell-wall<br>
binding domain. However, no significant lytic activity was observed for egg white<br>
lysozyme (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) against GBS as well as many other bacterial<br>
species targeted by these truncated PlyGBS mutants. The endopeptidase domain<br>
present in these mutants is similar to the CHAP domain recently identified in the<br>
-14-<br><br>
PlyGBS lytic enzyme (SEQ ID N0:1) from GBS bacteriophage B30. Pritchard et a/.,<br>
"The bifunctional peptidoglycan lysin of Streptococcus agalactiae bacteriophage<br>
B30," Microbiology. 150: 2079-2087 (2004). However, the CHAP domain by itself in<br>
the hyperactive PlyGBS truncated mutants is not only active against GBS, but is<br>
significantly increased in activity (from about 1.5 to about 40 fold) over the wild type<br>
PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1). Although CHAP domains are widely present in many phage<br>
lysins, CHAP domains do not typically have lytic activity without the association of a<br>
cell-wall binding domain.<br>
[0048] Fig. 4 is a schematic diagram of PlyGBS and several truncated mutants.<br>
Mutant PlyGBS92 (SEQ ID NO:6) only contains central muramidase domain (aa<br>
150-394), while PlyGBS93 (SEQ ID NO:7) has muramidase plus C-terminal domains<br>
(aa 150-443). Mutant PlyGBS94 (SEQ ID NO:8) contains the N-terminal<br>
endopeptidase domain (aa 1-146). For comparison, PlyGBS95 (SEQ ID NO:9) was<br>
constructed which has an in-frame deletion of central muramidase domain (deletion<br>
between aa 147-348). As shown in Fig. 4, hyperactive PlyGBS mutant PlyGBS94<br>
(SEQ ID NO:8) contains the N-terminal endopeptidase domain (first 146 amino<br>
acids) and is similar to mutant PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4) (first 138 amino acids)<br>
obtained above. A similar level of lytic activity was observed in these two mutants.<br>
Mutant PlyGBS92 (SEQ ID NO:6) contains the putative muramidase domain located<br>
in the center of PlyGBS, while the PlyGBS93 (SEQ ID NO:7) mutant contains the<br>
muramidase domain plus the C-terminal region. Compared with the active<br>
endopeptidase domain present in mutant PlyGBS94 (SEQ ID NO:8), neither of these<br>
deletion mutants had any lytic activity against GBS. The lytic activity of a mutant<br>
(PlyGBS95 (SEQ ID NO:9)) containing an in-frame deletion of the central<br>
muramidase domain (Fig. 4) also was analyzed. The mutant has a lytic activity<br>
similar to mutant PlyGBS94 (SEQ ID NO:8).<br>
Protein Stability of PlyGBS Hyperactive Mutants<br>
[0049] Fig. 5A is a graph showing the relative activity of PlyGBS, PlyGBS90-1<br>
(SEQ ID NO:5) and PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4) at 4°C. Fig. 5B is a graph showing<br>
the stability of PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1), PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) and PlyGBS90-8<br>
(SEQ ID NO:4) in 25% glycerol at 80°C. To obtain the data for the graphs in Fig. 5A<br>
-15-,<br><br>
and Fig. 5B, PlyGBS (SEQ ID N0:1) and hyperactive mutants PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID<br>
N0:5) and PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID N0:4) were stored in aliquots at 4°C (Fig. 5A) in<br>
buffer and -80°C (Fig. 5B) in 25% glycerol. At different time points, the lytic activity<br>
of these samples was measured by in vitro lytic activity against GBS and the Vmax<br>
values were determined to calculate relative activity. As shown in Fig. 5A, at 4°C,<br>
wild type PlyGBS is stable for more than 40 days, while only 25% and 31.2% activity<br>
was retained for the same period for mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) and<br>
PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4), respectively, and nearly lost at 60 days. However,<br>
when we stored these proteins in 25% glycerol at -80°C (Fig. 5B), all 3 proteins had<br>
a better stability profile up to 40 days with less of a loss at 60 days.<br>
Comparison of Lytic Activity of PlyGBS with Hyperactive PlyGBS Mutant<br>
Lysins<br>
[0050] Fig. 6A and Fig. 6B are graphs showing a comparison of killing effect for<br>
PlyGBS and PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) using different amounts of PlyGBS (SEQ<br>
ID NO:1) and mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) (2, 10, 50, and 100 ug) in an in<br>
vitro assay to measure the lytic activity by the determination of Vmax. To obtain the<br>
assay results illustrated in Fig. 6A, different amounts (2, 10, 50, and 100 ug) of<br>
PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) and PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) were used in the in vitro<br>
assay and the decrease of OD600 was monitored by a spectrophotometer. The lytic<br>
activity was expressed as the initial velocity of the decrease in absorbance over time<br>
(-mOD600/min). As shown in Fig. 6A, the Vmax is only -22.8 mOD6oo / rnin when<br>
100 ug of wild type PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) was used, while the Vmax values are -<br>
60.5 and -266.5 mOD6oo / min for 10 ug and 100 ug of mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:5), respectively. Vmax measures the initial velocity of ODeoo drop, the rate of cell<br>
lysis, and is likely to be underestimated when 100 ug of hyperactive mutant<br>
PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) is used because cell lysis occurred too rapidly to be<br>
measured accurately under this condition.<br>
[0051] The efficacy of mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) in an in vitro cell<br>
viability assay was tested. To obtain the assay results illustrated in Fig. 6B, the<br>
same amount of PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) and PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) (about<br>
3,000 ug) was used in the /// vitro viability assay. As shown in Fig. 6B, cell viability<br>
-16-<br><br>
decreased about 6 logs after 60 min incubation with mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:5), and only 2-logs for wild type PlyGBS over the same period. At 10 min<br>
incubation, the cell viability decreased 3 logs for the mutant and less than 1 log for<br>
the wild-type. These results indicate that the mutant enzyme has a significantly<br>
increased lytic activity against GBS.<br>
[0052] Lysin activity of the PlyGBS lysins can be affected by the salt<br>
concentration. To obtain the results illustrated in the graph of Fig. 7, the lytic activity<br>
of PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) and mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) were measured<br>
at various NaCI salt concentrations raging from 0 to 500 mM. Fig. 7 is a graph<br>
showing the effect of salt concentration on the lytic activity of PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1)<br>
and PLYGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) mutant. To obtain the data illustrated in Fig. 7,<br>
purified PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) and PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) were dialyzed<br>
against 2 mM Tris-HCI (pH7.4) overnight and various amounts of 5M NaCI were<br>
added to provide the desired salt concentration for the in vitro activity assay. The<br>
highest lytic activity under optimum salt concentration for PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) or<br>
PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) is considered as 100% for the standard to calculate<br>
relative activity. As shown in Fig. 7, the optimum NaCI concentration for wild type<br>
PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) is about 200 mM, while the optimum for mutant PlyGBS90-1<br>
(SEQ ID NO:5) shifted to about 50-100 mM. The results illustrated in Fig. 7 suggest<br>
that although the wild-type PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) enzyme retained activity over a<br>
wider range of salt than the PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) mutant, the mutant was<br>
more sensitive to these changes. When the pH activity profile of mutant PlyGBS90-1<br>
(SEQ ID NO:5) was compared with wild-type PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1), both had a<br>
peak at pH 5.0.<br>
[0053] The activity spectrum of mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) lysine was<br>
compared with wild-type PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) lysine using the same amount of<br>
lysin. PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) has a relatively broad spectrum against a number of<br>
streptococcal groups and species, such as S. pyogenes (GAS), S. equi (GCS) and<br>
S. salivarius (Cheng, Q., D. Nelson, S. W. Zhu, and V. A. Fischetti, "Removal of<br>
group B streptococci colonizing the vagina and oropharynx of mice with a<br>
bacteriophage lytic enzyme," Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 49: 111-117 (2005),<br>
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Fig. 8 is a graph comparing the lysin<br>
-17-<br><br>
specificity of PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) and PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5). To obtain the<br>
data illustrated in Fig. 8, the same dose of PlyGBS or PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5)<br>
(40 U) was used in the in vitro assay and lytic activity was expressed as -<br>
mOD600/min. Surprisingly, both enzymes had a similar level of lytic activity (Vmax)<br>
against GBS and S. salivarius (Fig. 8) as well as some other streptococcal species.<br>
Other bacterial species were tested in which the wild type PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1)<br>
enzyme had little to no activity (i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus),<br>
and the PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4) mutant enzyme demonstrated a similar pattern<br>
of specificity, except a small activity was found with B. cereus (Fig. 8). A similar<br>
result was observed with some of our other truncated mutants, such as PlyGBS80<br>
(SEQ ID NO:3) and PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4), which show some killing effect<br>
against B. cereus.<br>
[0054] The purified mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) preparation was tested<br>
for its lytic activity against GBS in a mouse vaginal model as described in the<br>
Examples below, and in Cheng, Q., D. Nelson, S. W. Zhu, and V. A. Fischetti,<br>
"Removal of group B streptococci colonizing the vagina and oropharynx of mice with<br>
a bacteriophage lytic enzyme," Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 49: 111-117 (2005).<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates in vivo test results demonstrating the control of GBS colonization in<br>
mice vagina with PlyGBS (SEQ ID NO:1) or PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5). To obtain<br>
the data illustrated in Fig. 9, mice were colonized with GBS vaginally after<br>
synchronization with ft-estradiol valerate. One day after GBS inoculation, three<br>
groups of mice were treated with either buffer (n=10), or 1,500 ug of PlyGBS (SEQ<br>
ID NO:1) (n=10), or 1,500 ug of PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) (n=10). Each mouse<br>
was swabbed vaginally before treatment (0-hour samples) and after treatment at 2-<br>
to 4-hour intervals (2- and 4-hour samples). The colony counts of vaginal swabs<br>
were averaged for each time interval in the same group and plotted. Error bar<br>
represent the standard error of the mean. As shown in Fig. 9, mice treated with<br>
mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) showed a statistically significant drop (from 5.54<br>
logs pre-treatment to an average of 1.68 logs after 4hrs post-treatment) compared to<br>
buffer control (p 
logs to an average of 2.28 logs after 4 hrs post-treatment. Statistical analysis<br>
indicated that the mutant PlyGBS90-1 exhibited a more efficient decrease in GBS<br>
-18-<br><br>
colonization thatn PlyGBS treatment 4 hours post-treatment (p= 0.0037). Thus, the<br>
mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) exhibited a more efficient decrease in GBS<br>
colonization.<br>
Variant Polypeptides<br>
[0055] In addition to the lysins encoded by polypeptide sequences of SEQ ID NO:<br>
1, the present disclosure also provides certain variant polypeptides, including<br>
fragments thereof and polypeptides with certain substitutions. The variant<br>
polypeptides may be hyperactive PlyGBS mutant lysins. For example, the variant<br>
polypeptide is a hyperactive PlyGBS mutant lysin selected from the group: PlyGBS<br>
86-6 (SEQ ID NO:2), PlyGBS 80 (SEQ ID NO:3), PlyGBS 90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4),<br>
PlyGBS 90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5), PlyGBS 94 (SEQ ID NO:8) and PlyGBS 95 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:9). The modified or altered form of the protein or peptides and peptide<br>
fragments, as disclosed, include protein or peptides and peptide fragments that are<br>
chemically synthesized or prepared by recombinant DNA techniques, or both. These<br>
techniques include, for example, chimerization and shuffling. When the protein or<br>
peptide is produced by chemical synthesis, it is preferably substantially free of<br>
chemical precursors or other chemicals, i.e., it is separated from chemical precursors<br>
or other chemicals that are involved in the synthesis of the protein. Accordingly such<br>
preparations of the protein have less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, 5% (by dry weight)<br>
of chemical precursors or compounds other than the polypeptide of interest.<br>
[0056] A "variant polypeptide sequence phage associated lytic enzyme" may be<br>
an active lytic enzyme polypeptide having at least about 80% amino acid sequence<br>
identity with a full-length native sequence lytic enzyme polypeptide sequence as<br>
disclosed. Such lytic enzyme polypeptide variants include, for example, lytic enzyme<br>
polypeptides where one or more amino acid residues are added, or deleted, at the<br>
N- or C-terminus of the full-length native amino acid sequence. A lytic enzyme<br>
polypeptide variant will have at least about 80% amino acid sequence identity, and<br>
may have at least about 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%,<br>
91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 99.5% amino acid sequence<br>
identity with a full-length native sequence lytic enzyme polypeptide sequence, a lytic<br>
enzyme polypeptide sequence iacking the signal peptide,an extracellular domain of a<br>
-19-<br><br>
lytic enzyme polypeptide, with or without the signal peptide, or any other specifically<br>
defined fragment of a full-length lytic enzyme polypeptide sequence as disclosed.<br>
Lytic enzyme variant polypeptides may be at least about 10 amino acids in length,<br>
often at least about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200 or 300 amino acids<br>
in length, or more.<br>
[0057J Such phage associated lytic enzyme variants include, for instance, lytic<br>
enzyme polypeptides where one or more amino acid residues are added, or deleted<br>
at the N or C terminus of the sequence of SEQ ID Nos. 1-9. In an example, one or<br>
more amino acids are substituted, deleted, and/or added to any position(s) in the<br>
sequence, or sequence portion.<br>
[0058] "Percent amino acid sequence identity" with respect to the phage<br>
associated lytic enzyme sequences identified is defined as the percentage of amino<br>
acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues<br>
in the phage associated lytic enzyme sequence, after aligning the sequences in the<br>
same reading frame and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum<br>
percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as<br>
part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino<br>
acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the<br>
art, for example, using publicly available computer software such as blast software.<br>
[0059] Polypeptide alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid<br>
sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art,<br>
for example using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2,<br>
ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine<br>
appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to<br>
achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared.<br>
[0060] The percent amino acid sequence identity values also may be obtained as<br>
described below by using the WU-BLAST-2 computer program (Altschul et ai,<br>
Methods in Enzymology 266:460-480 (1996)). Most of the WU-BLAST-2 search<br>
parameters are set to the default values. Those not set to default values are set with<br>
the following values: overlap span=1, overlap fraction=0.125, word threshold (T)=11,<br>
and scoring matrix=BLOSUM62. When WU-BLAST-2 is employed, a percent amino<br>
acid sequence identity value is determined by dividing (a) the number of matching<br>
-20-<br><br>
identical amino acid residues between the amino acid sequence of the lytic enzyme<br>
polypeptide of interest having a sequence derived from the native lytic enzyme<br>
polypeptide and the comparison amino acid sequence of interest (i.e., the sequence<br>
against which the lytic enzyme polypeptide of interest is being compared which may<br>
be a lytic enzyme variant polypeptide) as determined by WU-BLAST-2 by (b) the<br>
total number of amino acid residues of the lytic enzyme polypeptide of interest. For<br>
example, in the statement "a polypeptide comprising an the amino acid sequence A<br>
which has or having at least 80% amino acid sequence identity to the amino acid<br>
sequence B", the amino acid sequence A is the comparison amino acid sequence of<br>
interest and the amino acid sequence B is the amino acid sequence of the lytic<br>
enzyme polypeptide of interest.<br>
[0061] Percent amino acid sequence identity also may be determined using the<br>
sequence comparison program NCBI-BLAST2 (Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res.<br>
25:3389-3402 (1997)). The NCBI-BLAST2 sequence comparison program may be<br>
downloaded from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. NCBI-BLAST2 uses several search<br>
parameters, where all of those search parameters are set to default values including,<br>
for example, unmask=yes, strand=all, expected occurrences=10, minimum low<br>
complexity length=15/5, multi-pass e-value=0.01, constant for multi-pass=25, dropoff<br>
for final gapped alignment=25 and scoring matrix=BLOSUM62.<br>
[0062] In situations where NCBI-BLAST2 is employed for amino acid sequence<br>
comparisons, the percent amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid<br>
sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can<br>
alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a<br>
certain percent amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid<br>
sequence B) is calculated as follows:<br>
100 times the fraction X/Y<br>
where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the<br>
sequence alignment program NCBI-BLAST2 in that program's alignment of A and B,<br>
and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated-<br>
that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino<br>
acid sequence B, the percent amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal<br>
the percent amino acid sequence identity of B to A.<br>
-21-<br><br>
Lysin Fragments<br>
[0063] In some examples, biologically active fragments of the lysins, including the<br>
polypeptide sequences such as SEQ ID NO: 1 or variants therof described, are<br>
provided. The variant polypeptides include hyperactive PlyGBS mutant lysins. The<br>
variant polypeptide may a hyperactive PlyGBS mutant lysin selected from the group<br>
consisting of: PlyGBS 86-6 (SEQ ID NO:2), PlyGBS 80 (SEQ ID NO:3), PlyGBS 90-<br>
8 (SEQ ID NO:4), PlyGBS 90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5), PlyGBS 94 (SEQ ID NO:8) and<br>
PlyGBS 95 (SEQ ID NO:9). A "fragment" may include a variant polypeptide having<br>
an amino acid sequence that entirely is the same as part but not all of the amino acid<br>
sequence of the aforementioned polypeptides. A fragment may be "free-standing,"<br>
or comprised within a larger polypeptide of which they form a part or region, most<br>
preferably as a single continuous region, a single larger polypeptide.<br>
[0064] Biologically active portions of a protein or peptide fragment of the<br>
examples, as described, include polypeptides comprising amino acid sequences<br>
sufficiently identical to or derived from the amino acid sequence of the phage protein<br>
of the disclosure, which include fewer amino acids than the full length protein of the<br>
phage protein and exhibit at least one activity of the corresponding full length protein.<br>
Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one<br>
activity of the corresponding protein. A biologically active portion of a protein or<br>
protein fragment of the disclosure can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10,25,<br>
50, 100 less or more amino acids in length. Moreover, other biologically active<br>
portions, in which other regions of the protein are deleted, or added can be prepared<br>
by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of the functional activities<br>
of the native.form of a polypeptide.<br>
[0065] Fragments may include, for example, truncation polypeptides having a<br>
portion of an amino acid sequence corresponding to (e.g., 50% sequence identity, at<br>
least 60%, at least 70% sequence identity, at least 80% sequence identity, at least<br>
95% sequence identity, at least 97% sequence identity or at least or even 98%<br>
sequence identity of at least 50 amino acid long region of the Natural Binding<br>
Region, or of variants, such as a continuous series of residues that includes the<br>
amino terminus, or a continuous series of residues that includes the carboxyl<br>
-22-<br><br>
terminus. Degradation forms of the polypeptides in a host cell also also are<br>
provided. Further provided are fragments characterized by structural or functional<br>
attributes such as fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming<br>
regions, beta-sheet and beta-sheet-forming regions, turn and turn-forming regions,<br>
coil and coil-forming regions, hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha<br>
amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming<br>
regions, substrate binding region, and high antigenic index regions.<br>
[0066] Also provided are fragments that have binding activities of at least 106,<br>
107, 108 or 109 against GBS bacteria, including those with a similar activity or an<br>
improved activity, or with a decreased undesirable activity. Also advantageous are<br>
conjugates of binding site and a detectable tag or bacteriocidal tag that confers such<br>
desirable clinical function whereby the binding region specifically binds to a bacterial<br>
wall.<br>
[0067] Variants that are fragments of the polypeptides of the disclosure may be<br>
employed for producing the corresponding full-length polypeptide by peptide<br>
synthesis; therefore, these variants may be employed as intermediates for producing<br>
the full-length polypeptides of examples of the disclosure.<br>
[0068] Lytic enzyme peptide fragments may be prepared by any of a number of<br>
conventional techniques. Desired peptide fragments may be chemically synthesized<br>
An alternative approach involves generating lytic enzyme fragments by enzymatic<br>
digestion, e.g., by treating the protein with an enzyme known to cleave proteins at<br>
sites defined by particular amino acid residues, or by digesting the DNA with suitable<br>
restriction enzymes and isolating the desired fragment. Yet another suitable<br>
technique involves isolating and amplifying a DNA fragment encoding a desired<br>
polypeptide fragment, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Oligonucleotides that<br>
define the desired termini of the DNA fragment are employed at the 5' and 3' primers<br>
in the PCR. Preferably, lytic enzyme polypeptide fragments share at least one<br>
biological and/or immunological activity with the native lytic enzyme polypeptide<br>
disclosed.<br>
[0069] For example, libraries of fragments of the coding sequence of a<br>
polypeptide of the disclosure can be used to generate a variegated population of<br>
polypeptides for screening and subsequent selection of variants. For example, a<br>
-23-<br><br>
library of coding sequence fragments can be generated by treating a double<br>
stranded PCR fragment of the coding sequence of interest with a nuclease under<br>
conditions where nicking occurs only about once per molecule, denaturing the<br>
double stranded DNA, renaturing the DNA to form double stranded DNA which can<br>
include sense/antisense pairs from different nicked products, removing single<br>
stranded portions from reformed duplexes by treatment with S1 nuclease, and<br>
ligating the resulting fragment library into an expression vector. By this method, an<br>
expression library can be derived which encodes N terminal and internal fragments<br>
of various sizes of the protein of interest. Several techniques are known in the art for<br>
screening gene products of combinatorial libraries made by point mutations or<br>
truncation, and for screening cDNA libraries for gene products having a selected<br>
property. The most widely used techniques, which are amenable to high through put<br>
analysis, for screening large gene libraries typically include cloning the gene library<br>
into replicable expression vectors, transforming appropriate cells with the resulting<br>
library of vectors, and expressing the combinatorial genes under conditions in which<br>
detection of a desired activity facilitates isolation of the vector encoding the gene<br>
whose product was detected. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis (REM), a technique<br>
which enhances the frequency of functional mutants in the libraries, can be used in<br>
combination with the screening assays to identify variants of a protein of the<br>
disclosure (Arkin and Yourvan (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:7811 7815;<br>
Delgrave era/. (1993) Protein Engineering 6(3):327 331).<br>
[0070] Immunologically active portions of a protein or peptide fragment can<br>
include regions that bind to antibodies that recognize the phage enzyme. In this<br>
context, the smallest portion of a protein (or nucleic acid that encodes the protein)<br>
may be an epitope that is recognizable as specific for the phage that makes the lysin<br>
protein. Accordingly, the smallest polypeptide (and associated nucleic acid that<br>
encodes the polypeptide) that can be expected to bind antibody and is useful may be<br>
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 75, 85, or 100 amino<br>
acids long. Although small sequences as short as 8, 9, 10, 11,12 or 15 amino acids<br>
long reliably comprise enough structure to act as epitopes, shorter sequences of 5,<br>
6, or 7 amino acids long can exhibit epitopic structure in some conditions and have<br>
-24-<br><br>
value. Thus, the smallest portion of the protein described by SEQ ID No. 1 may<br>
include polypeptides as small as 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 amino acids long.<br>
[0071] Homologous proteins and nucleic acids can be prepared that share<br>
functionality with such small proteins and/or nucleic acids (or protein and/or nucleic<br>
acid regions of larger molecules) as will be appreciated by a skilled artisan. Such<br>
small molecules and short regions of larger molecules, that may be homologous<br>
specifically are intended as examples, and are not limiting. The homology of such<br>
valuable regions may be at least 50%, 65%, 75%, 85%, at least 90%, 95%, 97%,<br>
98%, or at least 99% compared to SEQ ID No. 1. These percent homology values<br>
do not include alterations due to conservative amino acid substitutions.<br>
[0072] An epitope as described may be used to generate an antibody and also<br>
can be used to detect binding to molecules that recognize the lysin protein. Another<br>
example is a molecule such as an antibody or other specific binder that may be<br>
created through use of an epitope such as by regular immunization or by a phase<br>
display approach where an epitope can be used to screen a library if potential<br>
binders. Such molecules recognize one or more epitopes of lysin protein or a<br>
nucleic acid that encodes lysin protein. An antibody that recognizes an epitope may<br>
be a monoclonal antibody, a humanized antibody, or a portion of an antibody protein.<br>
Desirably the molecule that recognizes an epitope has a specific binding for that<br>
epitope which is at least 10 times as strong as the molecule has for serum albumin.<br>
Specific binding can be measured as affinity (Km). The specific binding may be at<br>
least 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, or even higher than that for serum albumin<br>
under the same conditions.<br>
[0073] In one example, the antibody or antibody fragment is in a form useful for<br>
detecting the presence of the lysin protein. A variety of forms and methods for their<br>
synthesis are known as will be appreciated by a skilled artisan. The antibody may<br>
be conjugated (covalently complexed) with a reporter molecule or atom such as a<br>
fluor, an enzyme that creates an optical signal, a chemilumiphore, a microparticle, or<br>
a radioactive atom. The antibody or antibody fragment may be synthesized in vivo,<br>
after immunization of an animal, for example. The antibody or antibody fragment<br>
may be synthesized via cell culture after genetic recombination. The antibody or<br>
-25-<br><br>
antibody fragment may be prepared by a combination of cell synthesis and chemical<br>
modification.<br>
Variant polypeptides<br>
[0074] Substitutional variants are those in which at least one residue in the amino<br>
acid sequence has been removed and a different residue inserted in its place. Such<br>
substitutions may be made in accordance with the following Table 2 when it is<br>
desired to finely modulate the characteristics of the protein. Table 2 shows amino<br>
acids which may be substituted for an original amino acid in a protein and which are<br>
regarded as conservative substitutions.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
Original Residue<br>
	Conservative Substitutions<br>
Ala	ser<br>
Arg	lys<br>
Asn	gin, his<br>
Asp	glu<br>
Cys	ser<br>
Gin	asn<br>
Glu	asp<br>
Gly	pro<br>
His	asn; gin<br>
lie	leu, val<br>
Leu	ile; val<br>
Lys	arg; gin; glu<br>
Met	leu; ile<br>
Phe	met; leu; tyr<br>
Ser	thr<br>
Thr	ser<br>
Trp	tyr<br>
Tyr	trp; phe<br>
Val	ile; leu<br>
[0075] Substantial changes in function or immunological identity are made by<br>
selecting substitutions that are less conservative than in Table 2, i.e., selecting<br>
residues that differ more significantly in their effect on maintaining: (a) the structure<br>
of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet<br>
-26-<br><br>
or helical conformation; (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target<br>
site; or (c) the bulk of the side chain. The substitutions which in general are<br>
expected to produce the greatest changes in protein properties will be those in<br>
which: (a) a hydrophilic residue, e.g., seryl or threonyl, is substituted for (or by) a<br>
hydrophobic residue, e.g., leucyl, isoleucyl, phenylalanyl, valyl or alanyl; (b) a<br>
cysteine or proline is substituted for (or by) any other residue; (c) a residue having an<br>
electropositive side chain, e.g., lysyl, arginyl, or histadyl, is substituted for (or by) an<br>
electronegative residue, e.g., glutamyl or aspartyl; or (d) a residue having a bulky<br>
side chain, e.g., phenylalanine, is substituted for (or by) one not having a side chain,<br>
e.g., glycine.<br>
[0076] The effects of these amino acid substitutions or deletions or additions may<br>
be assessed for derivatives of the lytic protein by analyzing the ability of the<br>
derivative proteins to complement the sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents<br>
exhibited by phages in infected bacteria hosts. These assays may be performed by<br>
transfecting DNA molecules encoding the derivative proteins into the bacteria as<br>
described above.<br>
[0077] Substantial modifications in function or immunological identity of the lytic<br>
enzyme polypeptide are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ<br>
significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide<br>
backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical<br>
conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or<br>
(c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups<br>
based on common side-chain properties:<br>
(1)	hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile;<br>
(2)	neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr;<br>
(3)	acidic: asp, glu;<br>
(4)	basic: asn, gin, his, lys, arg;<br>
(5)	residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and<br>
(6)	aromatic: trp, tyr, phe.<br>
[0078] Non-conservative substitutions may entail exchanging a member of one of<br>
these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced<br>
into the conservative substitution sites or, into the remaining (non-conserved) sites.<br>
-27-<br><br>
[0079] Polypeptide variations can be made using methods known in the art such<br>
as oligonucleotide-mediated (site-directed) mutagenesis, alanine scanning, and PCR<br>
mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis [Carter et a/., Nucl. Acids Res., 13:4331<br>
(1986); Zoller et a/., Nucl. Acids Res., 10:6487 (1987)], cassette mutagenesis [Wells<br>
et al., Gene, 34:315 (1985)], restriction selection mutagenesis [Wells et a/., Philos.<br>
Trans. R. Soc. London SerA, 317:415 (1986)] or other known techniques can be<br>
performed on the cloned DNA to produce the lytic enzyme variant DNA.<br>
[0080] Scanning amino acid analysis may also be employed to identify one or<br>
more amino acids along a contiguous sequence. For example, scanning amino<br>
acids may be relatively small, neutral amino acids. Such amino acids include<br>
alanine, glycine, serine, and cysteine. Alanine is typically a preferred scanning<br>
amino acid among this group because it eliminates the side-chain beyond the beta-<br>
carbon and is less likely to alter the main-chain conformation of the variant<br>
[Cunningham and Wells, Science. 244: 1081-1085 (1989)]. Alanine is also typically<br>
preferred because it is the most common amino acid. Further, it is frequently found<br>
in both buried and exposed positions [Creighton, The Proteins, (W. H. Freeman &amp;<br>
Co., N.Y.); Chothia, J. Mol. Biol. 150:1 (1976)]. If alanine substitution does not yield<br>
adequate amounts of variant, an isoteric amino acid can be used.<br>
Chimeric Fusion Proteins<br>
[0081] In some examples, a lysin also may be modified to form a chimeric<br>
molecule comprising a lytic enzyme fused to another, heterologous polypeptide or<br>
amino acid sequence. A "chimeric protein" or "fusion protein" comprises all or (for<br>
example, a biologically active) part of a polypeptide of the disclosure operably linked<br>
to a heterologous polypeptide. Chimeric proteins or peptides are produced, for<br>
example, by combining two or more proteins having two or more active sites.<br>
Chimeric protein and peptides can act independently on the same or different<br>
molecules, and hence have a potential to treat two or more different bacterial<br>
infections at the same time. Chimeric proteins and peptides also are used to treat a<br>
bacterial infection by cleaving the cell wall in more than one location.<br>
[0082] In one example, such a chimeric molecule comprises a fusion of the lytic<br>
enzyme with a tag polypeptide which provides an epitope to which an anti-tag<br>
-28-<br><br>
antibody can selectively bind. The epitope tag is generally placed at the amino- or<br>
carboxyl-terminus of the lytic enzyme. The presence of such epitope-tagged forms<br>
of the lytic enzyme may be detected using an antibody against the tag polypeptide.<br>
Also, provision of the epitope tag enables the lytic enzyme to be readily purified by<br>
affinity purification using an anti-tag antibody or another type of affinity matrix that<br>
binds to the epitope tag. Various tag polypeptides and their respective antibodies<br>
are well known in the art. Examples include poly-histidine (poly-his) or poly-histidine-<br>
glycine (poly-his-gly) tags; the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 [Field<br>
et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 8:2159-2165 (1988)]; the c-myc tag and the 8F9, 3C7, 6E10,<br>
G4, B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto [Evan et al., Molecular and Cellular Biology,<br>
5:3610-3616 (1985)1; and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) tag and its<br>
antibody [Paborsky et al., Protein Engineering: (6):547-553 (1990)].Other tag<br>
polypeptides include the Flag-peptide [Hopp et al., BioTechnology, 6:1204-1210<br>
(1988)]; the KT3 epitope peptide [Martin et al., Science 255:192-194 (1992)]; an cc-<br>
tubulin epitope peptide (Skinner et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266:15163-15166 (1991)1;<br>
and the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag (Lutz-Freyermuth et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA, 87:6393-6397 (1990)].<br>
[0083] In an alternative example, the chimeric molecule may comprise a fusion of<br>
the lytic enzyme with an immunoglobulin or a particular region of an immunoglobulin.<br>
For a bivalent form of the chimeric molecule (also referred to as an<br>
"immunoadhesin"), such a fusion could be to the Fc region of an IgG molecule. The<br>
Ig fusions may include the substitution of a soluble (transmembrane domain deleted<br>
or inactivated) form of a lytic enzyme polypeptide in place of at least one variable<br>
region within an Ig molecule. The immunoglobulin fusion may include the hinge,<br>
CH2 and CH3, or the hinge, CH1, CH2 and CH3 regions of an lgG1 molecule. For<br>
the production of immunoglobulin fusions see also U.S. Pat. No. 5,428,130 issued<br>
Jun. 27, 1995.<br>
[0084] In another example, the chimeric protein or peptide contains a<br>
heterologous signal sequence at its N terminus. For example, the native signal<br>
sequence of a polypeptide of the disclosure can be removed and replaced with a<br>
signal sequence from another protein. For example, the gp67 secretory sequence of<br>
the baculovirus envelope protein can be used as a heterologous signal sequence<br>
-29-<br><br>
(Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
1992, incorporated herein by reference). Other examples of eukaryotic heterologous<br>
signal sequences include the secretory sequences of melittin and human placental<br>
alkaline phosphatase (Stratagene; La Jolla, California). In yet another example,<br>
useful prokaryotic heterologous signal sequences include the phoA secretory signal<br>
(Sambrook et al., supra) and the protein A secretory signal (Pharmacia Biotech;<br>
Piscataway, New Jersey).<br>
[0085] Another example of a useful fusion protein is a GST fusion protein in which<br>
the polypeptide of the disclosure is fused to the C terminus of a GST sequence.<br>
Such a chimeric protein can facilitate the purification of a recombinant polypeptide of<br>
the disclosure.<br>
[0086] Another example shows an immunoglobulin fusion protein in which all or<br>
part of a polypeptide of the disclosure is fused to sequences derived from a member<br>
of the immunoglobulin protein family. An immunoglobulin fusion protein can be<br>
incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition and administered to a subject to<br>
inhibit an interaction between a ligand (soluble or membrane bound) and a protein<br>
on the surface of a cell (receptor), to thereby suppress signal transduction in vivo.<br>
The immunoglobulin fusion protein can alter bioavailability of a cognate ligand of a<br>
polypeptide of the disclosure. Inhibition of ligand/receptor interaction may be useful<br>
therapeutically, both for treating bacterial associated diseases and disorders for<br>
modulating (i.e., promoting or inhibiting) cell survival. Moreover, an immunoglobulin<br>
fusion protein of the disclosure can be used as an immunogen to produce antibodies<br>
directed against a polypeptide of the disclosure in a subject, to purify ligands and in<br>
screening assays to identify molecules which inhibit the interaction of receptors with<br>
ligands. Chimeric and fusion proteins and peptides of the disclosure can be<br>
produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques.<br>
[0087] In another example, the fusion gene can be synthesized by conventional<br>
techniques, including automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively, PCR amplification<br>
of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers which give rise to<br>
complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments which<br>
subsequently can be annealed and reamplified to generate a chimeric gene<br>
sequence (see, i.e., Ausubel et al., supra). Moreover, many expression vectors are<br>
-30-<br><br>
commercially available that already encode a fusion moiety (i.e., a GST polypeptide).<br>
A nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the disclosure can be cloned into such an<br>
expression vector such that the fusion moiety is linked in frame to the polypeptide of<br>
the disclosure.<br>
Combination with Signal sequences<br>
[0088] A signal sequence of a polypeptide of can facilitate transmembrane<br>
movement of the protein and peptides and peptide fragments of the disclosure to<br>
and from mucous membranes, as well as by facilitating secretion and isolation of the<br>
secreted protein or other proteins of interest. Signal sequences are typically<br>
characterized by a core of hydrophobic amino acids which are generally cleaved<br>
from the mature protein during secretion in one or more cleavage events. Such<br>
signal peptides contain processing sites that allow cleavage of the signal sequence<br>
from the mature proteins as they pass through the secretory pathway. The<br>
described polypeptides can further comprise a signal sequence, as well as to the<br>
signal sequence itself and to the polypeptide in the absence of the signal sequence<br>
(i.e., the cleavage products). In one example, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a<br>
signal sequence of the disclosure can be operably linked in an expression vector to a<br>
protein of interest, such as a protein which is ordinarily not secreted or is otherwise<br>
difficult to isolate. The signal sequence directs secretion of the protein, such as from<br>
an eukaryotic host into which the expression vector is transformed, and the signal<br>
sequence is subsequently or concurrently cleaved. The protein can then be readily<br>
purified from the extracellular medium by art recognized methods. Alternatively, the<br>
signal sequence can be linked to a protein of interest using a sequence, which<br>
facilitates purification, such as with a GST domain.<br>
[0089] In another example, a signal sequence can be used to identify regulatory<br>
sequences, i.e., promoters, enhancers, repressors. Since signal sequences are the<br>
most amino terminal sequences of a peptide, it is expected that the nucleic acids<br>
which flank the signal sequence on its amino terminal side will be regulatory<br>
sequences that affect transcription. Thus, a nucleotide sequence which encodes all<br>
or a portion of a signal sequence can be used as a probe to identify and isolate the<br>
signal sequence and its flanking region, and this flanking region can be studied to<br>
-31-<br><br>
identify regulatory elements therein. Variants of the polypeptides of the disclosure<br>
can have an altered amino acid sequence and can function as either agonists<br>
(mimetics) or as antagonists. Variants can be generated by mutagenesis, i.e.,<br>
discrete point mutation or truncation. An agonist can retain substantially the same,<br>
or a subset, of the biological activities of the naturally occurring form of the protein.<br>
An antagonist of a protein can inhibit one or more of the activities of the naturally<br>
occurring form of the protein by, for example, competitively binding to a downstream<br>
or upstream member of a cellular signaling cascade which includes the protein of<br>
interest. Thus, specific biological effects can be elicited by treatment with a variant<br>
of limited function. Treatment of a subject with a variant having a subset of the<br>
biological activities of the naturally occurring form of the protein can have fewer side<br>
effects in a subject relative to treatment with the naturally occurring form of the<br>
protein. Variants of a protein of the disclosure which function as either agonists<br>
(mimetics) or as antagonists can be identified by screening combinatorial libraries of<br>
mutants, i.e., truncation mutants, of the protein of the disclosure for agonist or<br>
antagonist activity. In one example, a variegated library of variants is generated by<br>
combinatorial mutagenesis at the nucleic acid level and is encoded by a variegated<br>
gene library. A variegated library of variants can be produced by, for example,<br>
enzymatically ligating a mixture of synthetic oligonucleotides into gene sequences<br>
such that a degenerate set of potential protein sequences is expressible as individual<br>
polypeptides, or alternatively, as a set of larger fusion proteins (i.e., for phage<br>
display). There are a variety of methods which can be used to produce libraries of<br>
potential variants of the polypeptides of the disclosure from a degenerate<br>
oligonucleotide sequence. Methods for synthesizing degenerate oligonucleotides<br>
are known in the art (see, i.e., Narang (1983) Tetrahedron 39:3; Itakura et al. (1984)<br>
Annu. Rev. Biochem. 53:323; Itakura et al. (1984) Science 198:1056; Ike et al.<br>
(1983) Nucleic Acid Res. 11:477, all herein incorporated by reference).<br>
Shuffled enzymes<br>
[0090] Certain examples provide shuffled proteins or peptides comprising one or<br>
more lytic enzyme peptides or variants disclosed, gene products, or peptides for<br>
more than one related phage protein or protein peptide fragments that are randomly<br>
-32-<br><br>
cleaved and reassembled into a more active or specific protein. Shuffled<br>
oligonucleotides, peptides or peptide fragment molecules are selected or screened<br>
to identify a molecule having a desired functional property. This method is<br>
described, for example, in Stemmer, US Patent No. 6,132,970.(Method of shuffling<br>
polynucleotides); Kauffman, U.S. Patent No 5, 976,862 (Evolution via Condon based<br>
Synthesis) and Huse, U.S. Patent No. 5,808,022 (Direct Codon Synthesis). The<br>
contents of these patents are incorporated herein by reference. Shuffling is used to<br>
create a protein that is 10 to 100 fold more active than the template protein. The<br>
template protein is selected among different varieties of lysin or holin proteins. The<br>
shuffled protein or peptides constitute, for example, one or more binding domains<br>
and one or more catalytic domains. Each binding or catalytic domain is derived from<br>
the same or a different phage or phage protein. The shuffled domains are either<br>
oligonucleotide based molecules, as gene or gene products, that either alone or in<br>
combination with other genes or gene products are translatable into a peptide<br>
fragment, or they are peptide based molecules. Gene fragments include any<br>
molecules of DNA, RNA, DNA RNA hybrid, antisense RNA, Ribozymes, ESTs,<br>
SNIPs and other oligonucleotide based molecules that either alone or in combination<br>
with other molecules produce an oligonucleotide molecule capable or incapable of<br>
translation into a peptide, a<br>
Covalent Modification of Polypeptides<br>
[0091] Other examples provide for covalent modifications of a lytic enzyme, or<br>
fragment or variant thereof. One type of covalent modification includes reacting<br>
targeted amino acid residues of a lytic enzyme polypeptide with an organic<br>
derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-<br>
terminal residues of the lytic enzyme -Derivatization with bifunctional agents is<br>
useful, for instance, for crosslinking lytic enzyme to a water-insoluble support matrix<br>
or surface for use in the method for purifying anti-lytic enzyme antibodies, and vice-<br>
versa. Commonly used crosslinking agents include, e.g., 1,1-bis(diazoacetyl)-2-<br>
phenylethane, glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, for example, esters with<br>
4-azidosalicylic acid, homobifunctional imidoesters, including disuccinimidyl esters<br>
such as 3,3'-dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), bifunctional maleimides such as bis-<br>
-33-<br><br>
N-maleimido-1,8-octane and agents such as methyl-3-[(p-azidophenyl-<br>
)dithiolpropioimidate.<br>
[0092] Other modifications include deamidation of glutaminyl and asparaginyl<br>
residues to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues, respectively,<br>
hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or<br>
threonyl residues, methylation of the a -amino groups of lysine, arginine, and<br>
histidine side chains [T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties,<br>
W. H. Freeman &amp; Co., San Francisco, pp 79-86 (1983)], acetylation of the N-terminal<br>
amine, and amidation of any C-terminal carboxyl group.<br>
[0093] Another type of covalent modification of the lytic enzyme polypeptide<br>
provided comprises altering the native glycosylation pattern of the polypeptide.<br>
Altering the native glycosylation pattern is intended for purposes herein to mean<br>
deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in native sequence lytic enzyme<br>
(either by removing the underlying glycosylation site or by deleting the glycosylation<br>
by chemical and/or enzymatic means), and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites<br>
that are not present in the native sequence lytic enzyme. In addition, the phrase<br>
includes qualitative changes in the glycosylation of the native proteins, involving a<br>
change in the nature and proportions of the various carbohydrate moieties present.<br>
[0094] Addition of glycosylation sites to the lytic enzyme polypeptide may be<br>
accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence. The alteration may be made, for<br>
example, by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine<br>
residues to the native sequence lytic enzyme (for O-linked glycosylation sites). The<br>
lytic enzyme amino acid sequence may optionally be altered through changes at the<br>
DNA level, particularly by mutating the DNA encoding the lytic enzyme polypeptide<br>
at preselected bases such that codons are generated that will translate into the<br>
desired amino acids.<br>
[0095] Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the<br>
lytic enzyme polypeptide is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the<br>
polypeptide. Such methods are described in the art, e.g., in WO 87/05330 published<br>
Sep. 11, 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306<br>
(1981).<br>
-34-<br><br>
[0096] Removal of carbohydrate moieties present on the lytic enzyme polypeptide<br>
may be accomplished chemically or enzymatically or by mutational substitution of<br>
codons encoding for amino acid residues that serve as targets for glycosylation.<br>
Chemical deglycosylation techniques are known in the art and described, for<br>
instance, by Hakimuddin, et a/., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 259:52 (1987) and by<br>
Edge et a/., Anal. Biochem., 118:131 (1981). Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate<br>
moieties on polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo- and exo-<br>
glycosidases as described byThotakura etal., Meth. Enzymol., 138:350 (1987).<br>
[0097] Another type of covalent modification of lytic enzyme comprises linking the<br>
lytic enzyme polypeptide to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g.,<br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner<br>
set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192 or<br>
4,179,337.<br>
Holin proteins<br>
[0098] Bacterial lysins my optionally comprise or be administered in combination<br>
with holing proteins. Holin proteins may be administered, for example, in<br>
combination with one or more lytic enzyme peptides, or variants or fragments<br>
thereof. Holin proteins produce holes in the cell membrane, also may be used. Holin<br>
proteins, or "holins," can form lethal membrane lesions. Like the lytic proteins, holin<br>
proteins are coded for and carried by a phage. Most holin protein sequences are<br>
short, and overall, hydrophobic in nature, with a highly hydrophilic carboxy terminal<br>
domain. In many cases, the putative holin protein is encoded on a different reading<br>
frame within the enzymatically active domain of the phage. In other cases, holin<br>
protein is encoded on the DNA next or close to the DNA coding for the cell wall lytic<br>
protein. Holin proteins are frequently synthesized during the late stage of phage<br>
infection and found in the cytoplasmic membrane where they cause membrane<br>
lesions.<br>
[0099] Holins can be grouped into two general classes based on primary<br>
structure analysis. Class I holins are usually 95 residues or longer and may have<br>
three potential transmembrane domains. Class II holins are usually smaller, at<br>
approximately 65-95 residues, with the distribution of charged and hydrophobic<br>
-35-<br><br>
residues indicating two TM domains (Young, et at. Trends in Microbiology v. 8, No. 4,<br>
March 2000). At least for the phages of gram positive hosts, however, the dual<br>
component lysis system may not be universal. Although the presence of holins has<br>
been shown or suggested for several phages, no genes have yet been found<br>
encoding putative holins for all phages. Holins have been shown to be present in<br>
several bacteria, including, for example, lactococcal bacteriophage Tuc2009,<br>
lactococcal NLC3, pneumococcal bacteriophage EJ 1, LactoBacillus gasseri<br>
bacteriophage Nadh, Staphylococcus aureus bacteriophage Twort, Listeria<br>
monocytogenes bacteriophages, pneumococcal phage Cp 1, Bacillus subtillis phage<br>
M29, LactoBac///us delbrueckki bacteriophage LL H lysin, and bacteriophage N11 of<br>
Staphyloccous aureus. (Loessner, etal., Journal of Bacteriology, Aug. 1999, p. 4452<br>
4460).<br>
Polynucleotides<br>
[00100] A lysin may be produced by any number of different methods. The lytic<br>
enzyme is produced by infecting said GBS bacteriawilh the genetic code delivered<br>
by a bacteriophage specific for said GBS bacteria. In another example, the lytic<br>
enzyme is produced by recombinant production from a nucleic acid that comprises a<br>
DNA having the sequence of bases of a polynucleotide sequence coding for one or<br>
more polypeptides of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a sequence that hybridizes with the<br>
complement of bases of a polynucleotide sequence coding for the polypeptide<br>
sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1 under suitable hybridization conditions. The lytic<br>
enzyme may be produced by removing a gene for the lytic enzyme from the phage<br>
genome, introducing said gene into a transfer vector, and cloning said transfer vector<br>
into an expression system, where the transfer vector is a plasmid. The expression<br>
system may be a bacteria, selected from any of the above listed groups, or, from E.<br>
coli. In another expression system production of the enzyme is by cell free<br>
expression system.<br>
[00101] In addition to the full-length native polynucleotide sequences encoding lytic<br>
enzyme polypeptides described, it is contemplated that lytic enzyme variants can be<br>
prepared. The degeneracy of the genetic code further widens the scope of the<br>
examples as it enables major variations in the nucleotide sequence of a DNA<br>
-36-<br><br>
molecule while maintaining the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. For<br>
example, a representative amino acid residue is alanine. This may be encoded in<br>
the cDNA by the nucleotide codon triplet GCT. Because of the degeneracy of the<br>
genetic code, three other nucleotide codon triplets-GCT, GCC and GCA--also code<br>
for alanine. Thus, the nucleotide sequence of the gene could be changed at this<br>
position to any of these three codons without affecting the amino acid composition of<br>
the encoded protein or the characteristics of the protein. The genetic code and<br>
variations in nucleotide codons for particular amino acids are well known to the<br>
skilled artisan. Based upon the degeneracy of the genetic code, variant DNA<br>
molecules may be derived from the cDNA molecules disclosed using standard DNA<br>
mutagenesis techniques as described above, or by synthesis of DNA sequences.<br>
DNA sequences which do not hybridize under stringent conditions to the cDNA<br>
sequences disclosed by virtue of sequence variation based on the degeneracy of the<br>
genetic code are herein comprehended by this disclosure.<br>
[0100]	Lytic enzyme variants can be prepared, for example, by introducing<br>
appropriate nucleotide changes into the lytic enzyme DNA, and/or by synthesis of<br>
the desired lytic enzyme polypeptide. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
amino acid changes may alter post-translational processes of the lytic enzyme, such<br>
as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites or altering the membrane<br>
anchoring characteristics.<br>
[0101]	One skilled in the art will recognize that the DNA mutagenesis<br>
techniques described here can produce a wide variety of DNA molecules that code<br>
for a bacteriophage lysin specific for GBS bacteriayei that maintain the essential<br>
characteristics of the lytic protein. Newly derived proteins also may be selected in<br>
order to obtain variations on the characteristic of the lytic protein, as will be more<br>
fully described below. Such derivatives include those with variations in amino acid<br>
sequence including minor deletions, additions and substitutions. While the site for<br>
introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the mutation per se<br>
does not need to be predetermined. For example, in order to optimize the<br>
performance of a mutation at a given site, random mutagenesis may be conducted at<br>
the target codon or region and the expressed protein variants screened for the<br>
optimal combination of desired activity. Techniques for making substitution<br>
-37-<br><br>
mutations at predetermined sites in DNA having a known sequence as described<br>
above are well known. Amino acid substitutions are typically of single residues;<br>
insertions usually will be on the order of about from 1 to 10 amino acid residues; and<br>
deletions will range about from 1 to 30 residues. Deletions or insertions may be in<br>
single form, but preferably are made in adjacent pairs, i.e., a deletion of 2 residues or<br>
insertion of 2 residues. Substitutions, deletions, insertions or any combination<br>
thereof may be combined to arrive at a final construct.<br>
[0102]	"Percent nucleic acid sequence identity" with respect to the phage<br>
associated lytic enzyme sequences means as the percentage of nucleotides in a<br>
candidate sequence that are identical with the nucleotides in the phage associated<br>
lytic enzyme sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if<br>
necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. Alignment for<br>
purposes of determining percent nucleic acid sequence identity can be achieved in<br>
various ways that are within the scope of those skilled in the art, including but not<br>
limited to the use of publicly available computer software.<br>
[0103]	In addition to nucleotide sequences that code for lytic enzyme<br>
genetically coded for by a bacteriophage specific for GBS and fragments of those<br>
enzymes, correspondingly provided are the complementary DNA strands of the<br>
cDNA molecule and DNA molecules which hybridize under stringent conditions to<br>
the lytic enzyme cDNA molecule or its complementary strand. Such hybridizing<br>
molecules include DNA molecules differing only by minor sequence changes,<br>
including nucleotide substitutions, deletions and additions. Also contemplated by this<br>
disclosure are isolated oligonucleotides comprising at least a segment of the cDNA<br>
molecule or its complementary strand, such as oligonucleotides which may be<br>
employed as effective DNA hybridization probes or primers useful in the polymerase<br>
chain reaction. Hybridizing DNA molecules and variants on the lytic enzyme cDNA<br>
may readily be created by standard molecular biology techniques.<br>
[0104]	A large variety of isolated cDNA sequences that encode phage<br>
associated lysing enzymes and partial sequences that hybridize with such gene<br>
sequences are useful for recombinant production of the lysing enzyme.<br>
Representative nucleic acid sequences in this context are polynucleotide sequences<br>
coding for the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS:1-9, sequence and sequences that<br>
-38-<br><br>
hybridize, under stringent conditions, with complementary sequences of the DNA<br>
encoding the these polypeptide sequences. Still further variants of these sequences<br>
and sequences of nucleic acids that hybridize with those shown in the Figures also<br>
are contemplated for use in production of lysing enzymes according to the<br>
disclosure, including natural variants that may be obtained.<br>
[0105]	The detection of specific DNA mutations may be achieved by methods<br>
such as hybridization using specific oligonucleotides (Wallace et al. (1986). Cold<br>
Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 51:257-261), direct DNA sequencing (Church and<br>
Gilbert (1988). Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:1991-1995), the use of restriction<br>
enzymes (Flavell et al. (1978). Cell 15:25), discrimination on the basis of<br>
electrophoretic mobility in gels with denaturing reagent (Myers and Maniatis (1986).<br>
Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 51:275-284), RNase protection (Myers et al.<br>
(1985). Science 230:1242), chemical cleavage (Cotton et al. (1985). Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 85:4397-4401) (incorporated herein by reference), and the ligase-<br>
mediated detection procedure (Landegren etai, 1988).<br>
[0106]	Many of the contemplated variant DNA molecules include those<br>
created by standard DNA mutagenesis techniques, such as M13 primer<br>
mutagenesis. Details of these techniques are provided in Sambrook et al. (1989) In<br>
Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (incorporated<br>
herein by reference). By the use of such techniques, variants may be created which<br>
differ in minor ways from those disclosed. DNA molecules and nucleotide<br>
sequences which are derivatives of those specifically disclosed and which differ from<br>
those disclosed by the deletion, addition or substitution of nucleotides while still<br>
encoding a protein which possesses the functional characteristic of the BSMR<br>
protein are contemplated by the disclosure. Also included are small DNA molecules<br>
which are derived from DNA molecules encoding all or part of the disclosed peptide<br>
sequences, or variants thereof. Such small DNA molecules include oligonucleotides<br>
suitable for use as hybridization probes or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers.<br>
As such, these small DNA molecules will comprise at least a segment of a lytic<br>
enzyme genetically coded for by a bacteriophage specific for GBS bacteria and, for<br>
the purposes of PCR, will comprise at least a 10-15 nucleotide sequence and, more<br>
preferably, a 15-30 nucleotide sequence of the gene. DNA molecules and<br>
-39-<br><br>
nucleotide sequences which are derived from the disclosed DNA molecules as<br>
described above also may be defined as DNA sequences which hybridize under<br>
stringent conditions to the DNA sequences disclosed, or fragments thereof.<br>
[0107]	Oligonucleotides specific to normal or mutant sequences are<br>
chemically synthesized using commercially available machines, labeled radioactively<br>
with isotopes (such as 32P) or non-radioactively (with tags such as biotin (Ward and<br>
Langer etal. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:6633-6657 1981) (incorporated herein by<br>
reference), and hybridized to individual DNA samples immobilized on membranes or<br>
other solid supports by dot-blot or transfer from gels after electrophoresis. The<br>
presence or absence of these specific sequences are visualized by methods such as<br>
autoradiography or fluorometric or colorimetric reactions (Gebeyehu et al. Nucleic<br>
Acids Res. 15:4513-4534 1987) (incorporated herein by reference).<br>
[0108]	Sequence differences between normal and mutant forms of the gene<br>
also may be revealed by the direct DNA sequencing method of Church and Gilbert<br>
(1988) (incorporated herein by reference). Cloned DNA segments may be used as<br>
probes to detect specific DNA segments. The sensitivity of this method is greatly<br>
enhanced when combined with PCR (Stoflet et al. Science 239:491-494, 1988)<br>
(incorporated herein by reference). In this approach, a sequencing primer which lies<br>
within the amplified sequence is used with double-stranded PCR product or single-<br>
stranded template generated by a modified PCR. The sequence determination is<br>
performed by conventional procedures with radiolabeled nucleotides or by automatic<br>
sequencing procedures with fluorescent tags. Such sequences are useful for<br>
production of lytic enzymes according to examples described.<br>
[0109]	Hybridization conditions corresponding to particular degrees of<br>
stringency vary depending upon the nature of the hybridization method of choice and<br>
the composition and length of the hybridizing DNA used. Generally, the temperature<br>
of hybridization and the ionic strength (especially the sodium ion concentration) of<br>
the hybridization buffer will determine the stringency of hybridization. Calculations<br>
regarding hybridization conditions required for attaining particular degrees of<br>
stringency are discussed by Sambrook et al. (1989), In Molecular Cloning: A<br>
Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., chapters 9 and 11, (herein<br>
incorporated by reference).<br>
-40-<br><br>
[0110]	An example of such calculation is as follows: A hybridization<br>
experiment may be performed by hybridization of a DNA molecule (for example, a<br>
natural variation of the lytic enzyme genetically coded for by a bacteria specific for<br>
GBS bacteria) to a target DNA molecule. A target DNA may be, for example, the<br>
corresponding cDNA which has been electrophoresed in an agarose gel and<br>
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by Southern blotting (Southern (1975). J.<br>
Mol. Biol. 98:503), a technique well known in the art and described in Sambrook et<br>
a/. (1989) In Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.<br>
(incorporated herein by reference). Hybridization with a target probe labeled with<br>
isotopic P (32) labeled-dCTP is carried out in a solution of high ionic strength such<br>
as 6 times SSC at a temperature that is 20-25 degrees Celsius below the melting<br>
temperature, Tm, (described infra). For such Southern hybridization experiments<br>
where the target DNA molecule on the Southern blot contains 10 ng of DNA or more,<br>
hybridization is carried out for 6-8 hours using 1-2 ng/ml radiolabeled probe (of<br>
specific activity equal to 109 CPM/mug or greater). Following hybridization, the<br>
nitrocellulose filter is washed to remove background hybridization. The washing<br>
conditions are as stringent as possible to remove background hybridization while<br>
retaining a specific hybridization signal. The term "Tm" represents the temperature<br>
above which, under the prevailing ionic conditions, the radiolabeled probe molecule<br>
will not hybridize to its target DNA molecule.<br>
[0111]	The Tm of such a hybrid molecule may be estimated from the following<br>
equation: Tm =81.5 degrees C -16.6log10 of sodium ion concentration)<br>
+0.41(%G+C)-0.63(% formamide)-(600/l) where l=the length of the hybrid in base<br>
pairs. This equation is valid for concentrations of sodium ion in the range of 0.01 M<br>
to 0.4M, and it is less accurate for calculations of Tm in solutions of higher sodium<br>
ion concentration (Bolton and McCarthy (1962). Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48:1390)<br>
(incorporated herein by reference). The equation also is valid for DNA having G+C<br>
contents within 30% to 75%, and also applies to hybrids greater than 100<br>
nucleotides in length. The behavior of oligonucleotide probes is described in detail in<br>
Ch. 11 of Sambrook et a/. (1989), In Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold<br>
Spring Harbor, N.Y. (incorporated herein by reference).<br>
-41-<br><br>
[0112]	Thus, by way of example, of a 150 base pair DNA probe derived from<br>
the first 150 base pairs of the open reading frame of a cDNA having a % GC=45%, a<br>
calculation of hybridization conditions required to give particular stringencies may be<br>
made as follows:<br>
[0113]	Assuming that the filter will be washed in 0.3 X SSC solution following<br>
hybridization, sodium ion =0.045M; % GC=45%; Formamide concentration^ 1=150<br>
base pairs (see equation in Sambrook et al.) and so Tm =74.4 degrees C. The Tm<br>
of double-stranded DNA decreases by 1-1.5 degrees C with every 1% decrease in<br>
homology (Bonner et al. (1973). J. Mol. Biol. 81:123). Therefore, for this given<br>
example, washing the filter in 0.3 times SSC at 59.4-64.4 degrees C will produce a<br>
stringency of hybridization equivalent to 90%; DNA molecules with more than 10%<br>
sequence variation relative to the target BSMR cDNA will not hybridize.<br>
Alternatively, washing the hybridized filter in 0.3 times SSC at a temperature of 65.4-<br>
68.4 degrees C will yield a hybridization stringency of 94%; DNA molecules with<br>
more than 6% sequence variation relative to the target BSMR cDNA molecule will<br>
not hybridize. The above example is given entirely by way of theoretical illustration.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that other hybridization techniques may be<br>
utilized and that variations in experimental conditions will necessitate alternative<br>
calculations for stringency.<br>
[0114]	In some examples, stringent conditions may be defined as those under<br>
which DNA molecules with more than 25% sequence variation (also termed<br>
"mismatch") will not hybridize. In one example, stringent conditions are those under<br>
which DNA molecules with more than 15%, 10% or preferably 6% mismatch will not<br>
hybridize.<br>
[0115]	"Stringency" of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art, and generally is an empirical calculation dependent upon<br>
probe length, washing temperature, and salt concentration. In general, longer<br>
probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing, while shorter probes need<br>
lower temperatures. Hybridization generally depends on the ability of denatured<br>
DNA to reanneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below<br>
their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the<br>
probe and hybridizable sequence, the higher the relative temperature which can be<br>
-42-<br><br>
used. As a result, it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the<br>
reaction conditions more stringent, while lower temperatures less so. For additional<br>
details and explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions, see Ausubel et a/.,<br>
Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Interscience Publishers, (1995).<br>
[0116]	"Stringent conditions" or "high stringency conditions", as defined<br>
herein, may be identified by those that: (1) employ low ionic strength and high<br>
temperature for washing, for example 0.015 M sodium chloride/0.0015 M sodium<br>
citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50°C; (2) employ during hybridization a<br>
denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1%<br>
bovine serum albumin/0.1% Ficoli/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/50 mM sodium<br>
phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at<br>
42°C; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5XSSC (0.75 M NaCI, 0.075 M sodium citrate),<br>
50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0-1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5XDenhardfs<br>
solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 Dg/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran<br>
sulfate at 42°C, with washes at 42°C. in 0.2XSSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate)<br>
and 50% formamide at 55° C, followed by a high-stringency wash consisting of<br>
0.1XSSC containing EDTA at 55°C.<br>
[0117]	"Moderately stringent conditions" may be identified as described by<br>
Sambrook et a/., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, New York: Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Press, 1989, and include the use of washing solution and hybridization<br>
conditions (e.g., temperature, ionic strength and % SDS) less stringent that those<br>
described above. An example of moderately stringent conditions is overnight<br>
incubation at 37°C. in a solution comprising: 20% formamide, 5XSSC (150 mM NaCI,<br>
15 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5XDenhardt's solution,<br>
10% dextran sulfate, and 20 mg/ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed<br>
by washing the filters in Ltimes.SSC at about 37-50°C. The skilled artisan will<br>
recognize how to adjust the temperature, ionic strength, etc. as necessary to<br>
accommodate factors such as probe length and the like.<br>

Vectors/host cells expressing polynucleotides for lysins<br>
[0118]	Vectors that comprise a polynucleotide or polynucleotides encoding<br>
one of the lysin polypeptide sequences described, or variants or fragments thereof,<br>
are also provided, including vectors formed from just the binding region, or as much<br>
as the entire lysin protein or ligation/conjugate of binding region with other protein.<br>
Other examples concern host cells that are genetically engineered with vectors of<br>
the disclosure and the production of polypeptides of the disclosure by recombinant<br>
techniques. Cell-free translation systems may also be employed to produce such<br>
proteins using RNAs derived from the DNA constructs of the disclosure.<br>
[0119]	For recombinant production, host cells can be genetically engineered<br>
to incorporate expression systems or portions thereof or polynucleotides of the<br>
disclosure. Introduction of a polynucleotide into the host cell can be effected by<br>
methods described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Davis et al.,<br>
BASIC METHODS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, (1986) and Sambrook et al.,<br>
MOLECULAR CLONING: A LABORATORY MANUAL, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), such as, calcium phosphate<br>
transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, transvection, microinjection,<br>
cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, scrape loading,<br>
ballistic introduction and infection.<br>
[0120]	Representative examples of appropriate hosts include bacterial cells,<br>
such as Streptococci, Staphylococci, Enterococci E. coli, Streptomyces and Bacillus<br>
subtilis cells; fungal cells, such as yeast cells and Aspergillus cells; insect cells such<br>
as Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera Sf9 cells; animal cells such as CHO, COS, HeLa,<br>
C127, 3T3, BHK, 293 and Bowes melanoma cells; and plant cells.<br>
[0121]	A great variety of expression systems can be used to produce the<br>
polypeptides of the disclosure. Such vectors include, among others, chromosomal,<br>
episomal and virus-derived vectors, e.g., vectors derived from bacterial plasmids,<br>
from bacteriophage, from transposons, from yeast episomes, from insertion<br>
elements, from yeast chromosomal elements, from viruses such as baculoviruses,<br>
papova viruses, such as SV40, vaccinia viruses, adenoviruses, fowl pox viruses,<br>
pseudorabies viruses and retroviruses, and vectors derived from combinations<br>
thereof, such as those derived from plasmid and bacteriophage genetic elements,<br>
-44-<br><br>
such as cosmids and phagemids. The expression system constructs may contain<br>
control regions that regulate as well as engender expression. Generally, any system<br>
or vector suitable to maintain, propagate or express polynucleotides and/or to<br>
express a polypeptide in a host may be used for expression in this regard. The<br>
appropriate DNA sequence may be inserted into the expression system by any of a<br>
variety of well-known and routine techniques, such as, for example, those set forth in<br>
Sambrook et a/., MOLECULAR CLONING, A LABORATORY MANUAL, (supra).<br>
[0122]	For secretion of the translated protein into the lumen of the<br>
endoplasmic reticulum, into the periplasmic space or into the extracellular<br>
environment, appropriate secretion signals may be incorporated into the expressed<br>
polypeptide. These signals may be endogenous to the polypeptide or they may be<br>
heterologous signals.<br>
[0123]	Polypeptides of the disclosure can be recovered and purified from<br>
recombinant cell cultures by well-known methods including ammonium sulfate or<br>
ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography,<br>
phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity<br>
chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and lectin chromatography. High<br>
performance liquid chromatography is also employed for purification. Well known<br>
techniques for refolding protein may be employed to regenerate active conformation<br>
when the polypeptide is denatured during isolation and or purification.<br>
[0124]	Nucleic acid is "operably linked" when it is placed into a functional<br>
relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a<br>
presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is<br>
expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a<br>
promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the<br>
transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a<br>
coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, "operably<br>
linked" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case<br>
of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not<br>
have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction<br>
sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are<br>
used in accordance with conventional practice.<br>
-45-<br><br>
Diagnostic Assays<br>
[0125]	Detection assays advantageously utilize a heterogeneous format<br>
where a binding reaction between a conjugated binding agent and an analyte occurs<br>
followed by a wash step to remove unbound conjugated binding agent. For<br>
example, gold sol particles may be prepared with protein that comprises the binding<br>
region with the binding protein immobilized on the particle surfaces. As binding<br>
occurs between the protein and bacteria, the particles merge and form a colored<br>
product. Analogously, the binding protein may be complexed, for example covalently<br>
with an enzyme such as beta galactosidase, peroxidase, or horseradish peroxidase.<br>
After wash, the remaining bound enzyme can be detected by adding a substrate<br>
such as a fluorogenic or chemilumigenic substrate. The binding protein may be<br>
complexed with any other reagent that can make a signal such as a rare earth fluor<br>
and detected by time resolved fluorescence, a radioactive material and detected by<br>
radioactivity measurement, or a regular fluorescent tag, and detected by<br>
fluorescence.<br>
[0126]	The conjugation of the binding region with a detectable tag may be<br>
carried out by synthetic chemistry or a biological process. For example, a DNA<br>
sequence coding for the binding region or of the entire lysine protein can be linked to<br>
genetic information that encodes a detectable marker such as green fluorescent<br>
protein (GFP) or an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase. This could be<br>
accomplished by separating the DNA for the binding domain by removing the N-<br>
terminal catalytic domain and replacing it in frame with indicator molecules such as<br>
green flourescent protein (GFP) and purifying the expressed fusion molecule for the<br>
identification of GBS bacteria. Since the binding domain has a similar binding affinity<br>
of an immunoglobulin G molecule, the marked binding domain will effectively identify<br>
GBS bacferiawith little false positive activity. One also could fuse the GFP molecule<br>
or an enzyme at the 5' end of the whole lysin enzyme if necessary, by doing so the<br>
enzymatic domain will be at least partly inactivated, still allowing the binding domain<br>
to function to bind to its substrate in the cell wall.<br>
[0127]	The isolated binding domain separated from the catalytic domain may<br>
be expressed, purified and labeled using a number of fluorescent molecules such as<br>
-46-<br><br>
fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine isothiocyanate and others known by skilled<br>
artisans. The binding domain may be modified with biotin to allow formation of a<br>
biotin-avidin complex after the binding region adheres to the GBS bacfer/afor<br>
identification.<br>
[0128]	Other catalytic domains may be added to the binding region. As<br>
exemplified by Diaz ef a/. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 87:8125 (1990) for another<br>
system, the catalytic domain may be replaced with catalytic domains from other<br>
phage lytic enzymes to cleave other bonds in the peptidoglycan cell wall of GBS<br>
bacteria. For example, the portion of the 5' end of the gamma lysin gene that codes<br>
for the N-terminal catalytic domain (an amidase) may be removed and replaced with<br>
the catalytic domain from phage lytic enzymes of other GBS phage and even from<br>
phage of other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. These catalytic domains<br>
may be other amidases (which may have higher activity or special features),<br>
muramidases, glucaminidases, or endopeptidases, all of which, when genetically<br>
fused to the binding domain of the gamma lysin will cleave their respective bonds in<br>
the peptidoglycan of the GBS bacteria. In a related example two or three (or more)<br>
tandem catalytic domains of different specificities may be fused (i.e., muramidases-<br>
glucaminidases-amidase) to a single gamma lysin binding domain to cleave these<br>
bonds in the GBS bacter/acell wall peptidoglycan producing a highly active cleaving<br>
enzyme. Navarre (Identification of a D alanyl glycine endopeptidase activity. J Biol<br>
Chem. 1999 May 28;274:15847 56.) has shown that triple enzymatic domains may<br>
exist in bacteriophage lytic enzymes.<br>
[0129]	Various conventional linkers can be used, e.g., diisocyanates,<br>
diisothiocyanates, carbodiimides, bis-hydroxysuccinimide esters, maleimide-<br>
hydroxysuccinimide esters, glutaraldehyde and the like, such as a selective<br>
sequential linker such as the anhydride-isothiocyante linker disclosed in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 4,680,338.<br>
-47-<br><br>
Therapeutic Compositions<br>
[0130]	Lytic enzymes may also be used to provide a prophylactic treatment for<br>
conditions associated with exposure to GBS bacteria, or as a therapeutic treatment<br>
for those who have already become ill from infection. The phage associated lytic<br>
enzymes described are specific for GBS bacteriaand preferably effectively and<br>
efficiently break down the cell wall of the GBS bacteria.<br>
[0131]	The lytic enzyme polypeptides described also may be employed as a<br>
therapeutic agent. The lytic enzyme polypeptides of the present invention can be<br>
formulated according to known methods to prepare pharmaceutically useful<br>
compositions, whereby the lytic enzyme product hereof is combined in admixture<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier vehicle. Compositions which may be<br>
used for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of a GBS ibacferiainfection also<br>
includes the shuffled and/or chimeric enzyme and a means of application (such as a<br>
carrier system or an oral delivery mode) to the mucosal lining of the oral and nasal<br>
cavity, such that the enzyme is put in the carrier system or oral delivery mode to<br>
reach the mucosa lining.<br>
[0132]	"Carriers" as used herein include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers,<br>
excipients, or stabilizers which are nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed<br>
thereto at the dosages and concentrations employed. Often the physiologically<br>
acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH buffered solution. Examples of physiologically<br>
acceptable carriers include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic<br>
acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10<br>
residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins;<br>
hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine,<br>
glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and<br>
other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such<br>
as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such<br>
as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, polyethylene glycol<br>
(PEG), and PLURONICS™.<br>
[0133]	Prior to, or at the time the modified lytic enzyme is put in the carrier<br>
system or oral delivery mode, the enzyme may be in a stabilizing buffer environment<br>
-48-<br><br>
for maintaining a suitable pH range, such as between about 5.0 and about 8.0,<br>
including a pH of about 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 or any pH interval of 0.05 therebetween, or<br>
any interval that is a multiple of 0.05 therebetween, including pH values of 5.2, 6.5,<br>
7.4, 7.5 and 8.5. .<br>
[0134]	Therapeutic formulations are prepared for storage by mixing the active<br>
ingredient having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically<br>
acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences<br>
16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous<br>
solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at<br>
the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate,<br>
citrate and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular<br>
weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin,<br>
gelatin or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine;<br>
monosaccharides, disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose,<br>
mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as<br>
mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic<br>
surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or PEG.<br>
[0135]	Any of the carriers for the lytic enzyme may be manufactured by<br>
conventional means. However, if alcohol is used in the carrier, the enzyme should be<br>
in a micelle, liposome, or a "reverse" liposome, to prevent denaturing of the enzyme.<br>
Similarly, when the lytic enzyme is being placed in the carrier, and the carrier is, or<br>
has been heated, such placement should be made after the carrier has cooled<br>
somewhat, to avoid heat denaturation of the enzyme. The carrier preferably is<br>
sterile. One or more lytic enzymes may be added to these substances in a liquid<br>
form or in a lyophilized state, whereupon it will be solubilized when it meets a liquid<br>
body.<br>
Stabilizing buffers<br>
[0136]	A stabilizing buffer should allow for the optimum activity of the lysin<br>
enzyme. The buffer may contain a reducing reagent, such as dithiothreitol. The<br>
stabilizing buffer also may be or include a metal chelating reagent, such as<br>
-49-<br><br>
ethylenediaminetetracetic acid disodium salt, or it also may contain a phosphate or<br>
citrate phosphate buffer, or any other buffer. The DNA coding of these phages and<br>
other phages may be altered to allow a recombinant enzyme to attack one cell wall<br>
at more than two locations, to allow the recombinant enzyme to cleave the cell wall<br>
of more than one species of bacteria, to allow the recombinant enzyme to attack<br>
other bacteria, or any combinations thereof. The type and number of alterations to a<br>
recombinant bacteriophage produced enzyme are incalculable. Any number of<br>
chimeric and shuffled lytic enzymes, alone or along with holin proteins, may be<br>
assembled to treat the exposure to GBS bacteria.<br>
Mucoadhesives<br>
[0137]	In some examples, a therapeutic composition comprises a<br>
mucoadhesive and a lytic enzyme, or chimeric and/or shuffled lytic enzymes, or their<br>
peptide fragments when the composition is directed to the mucosal lining to kill<br>
colonizing disease bacteria. The mucosal lining, as disclosed and described,<br>
includes, for example, the upper and lower respiratory tract, eye, buccal cavity, nose,<br>
rectum, vagina, periodontal pocket, intestines and colon. Due to natural eliminating<br>
or cleansing mechanisms of mucosal tissues, conventional dosage forms are not<br>
retained at the application site for any significant length of time.<br>
[0138]	For these and other reasons it is advantageous to have materials<br>
which exhibit adhesion to mucosal tissues, to be administered with one or more<br>
phage enzymes and other complementary agents over a period of time. Materials<br>
having controlled release capability are particularly desirable, and the use of<br>
sustained release mucoadhesives has received a significant degree of attention.<br>
[0139]	J. R. Robinson (U.S. Pat. No. 4,615,697, incorporated herein by<br>
reference) provides a review of the various controlled release polymeric<br>
compositions used in mucosal drug delivery. The patent describes a controlled<br>
release treatment composition which includes a bioadhesive and an effective amount<br>
of a treating agent. The bioadhesive is a water swellable, but water insoluble<br>
fibrous, crosslinked, carboxy functional polymer containing (a) a plurality of repeating<br>
units of which at least about 80 percent contain at least one carboxyl functionality,<br>
and (b) about 0.05 to about 1.5 percent crosslinking agent substantially free from<br>
-50-<br><br>
polyalkenyl polyether. While the polymers of Robinson are water swellable but<br>
insoluble, they are crosslinked, not thermoplastic, and are not as easy to formulate<br>
with active agents, and into the various dosage forms, as the copolymer systems of<br>
the present application. Micelles and multi lamellar micelles also may be used to<br>
control the release of enzyme.<br>
[0140]	Other approaches involving mucoadhesives which are the combination<br>
of hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials, are known. Orahesive® from E.R. Squibb<br>
&amp; Co is an adhesive which is a combination of pectin, gelatin, and sodium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose in a tacky hydrocarbon polymer, for adhering to the oral<br>
mucosa. However, such physical mixtures of hydrophilic and hydrophobic<br>
components eventually fall apart. In contrast, the hydrophilic and hydrophobic<br>
domains in the present disclosure produce an insoluble copolymer.<br>
[0141]	U.S. Pat. No. 4,948,580, also incorporated by reference, describes a<br>
bioadhesive oral drug delivery system. The composition includes a freeze dried<br>
polymer mixture formed of the copolymer poly(methyl vinyl ether/maleic anhydride)<br>
and gelatin, dispersed in an ointment base, such as mineral oil containing dispersed<br>
polyethylene. U.S. Pat. No. 5,413,792 (incorporated herein by reference) discloses<br>
paste like preparations comprising (A) a paste like base comprising a<br>
polyorganosiloxane and a water soluble polymeric material which are may be<br>
present in a ratio by weight from 3:6 to 6:3, and (B) an active ingredient. U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,554,380 claims a solid or semisolid bioadherent orally ingestible drug delivery<br>
system containing a water in oil system having at least two phases. One phase<br>
comprises from about 25% to about 75% by volume of an internal hydrophilic phase<br>
and the other phase comprises from about 23% to about 75% by volume of an<br>
external hydrophobic phase, where the external hydrophobic phase is comprised of<br>
three components: (a) an emulsifier, (b) a glyceride ester, and (c) a wax material.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,243 describes some representative release materials useful for<br>
administering antibacterial agents, which disclosure is incorporated by reference.<br>
[0142]	A therapeutic composition may contain polymeric mucoadhesives<br>
consisting essentially of a graft copolymer comprising a hydrophilic main chain and<br>
hydrophobic graft chains for controlled release of biologically active agents. The<br>
graft copolymer is a reaction product of (1) a polystyrene macromonomer having an<br>
-51-<br><br>
ethylenically unsaturated functional group, and (2) at least one hydrophilic acidic<br>
monomer having an ethylenically unsaturated functional group. The graft chains<br>
consist essentially of polystyrene, and the main polymer chain of hydrophilic<br>
monomeric moieties, some of which have acidic functionality. The weight percent of<br>
the polystyrene macromonomer in the graft copolymer is between about 1 and about<br>
20% and the weight percent of the total hydrophilic monomer in the graft copolymer<br>
is between 80 and 99%, and where at least 10% of said total hydrophilic monomer is<br>
acidic, said graft copolymer when fully hydrated having an equilibrium water content<br>
of at least 90%.<br>
[0143]	Compositions containing the copolymers gradually hydrate by sorption<br>
of tissue fluids at the application site to yield a very soft jelly like mass exhibiting<br>
adhesion to the mucosal surface. During the period of time the composition is<br>
adhering to the mucosal surface, it provides sustained release of the<br>
pharmacologically active agent, which is absorbed by the mucosal tissue.<br>
[0144]	Mucoadhesivity of the compositions of these examples are, to a large<br>
extent, produced by the hydrophilic acidic monomers of the chain in the polystyrene<br>
graft copolymer. The acidic monomers include, but are not limited to, acrylic and<br>
methacrylic acids, 2 acrylamido 2 methyl propane sulfonic acid, 2 sulfoethyl<br>
methacrylate, and vinyl phosphonic acid. Other copolymerizable monomers include,<br>
but are not limited to N,N dimethylacrylamide, glyceryl methacrylate, polyethylene<br>
glycol monomethacrylate, etc.<br>
[0145]	The compositions of the disclosure may optionally contain other<br>
polymeric materials, such as poly(acrylic acid), poly, (vinyl pyrrolidone), and sodium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose plasticizers, and other pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipients in amounts that do not cause a deleterious effect upon mucoadhesivity of<br>
the composition. The dosage forms of the compositions of this disclosure can be<br>
prepared by conventional methods.<br>
Pharmaceuticals<br>
[0146]	The present disclosure also provides compositions comprising one or<br>
more pharmaceutical agents and one or more lysins. Further provided are methods<br>
-52-<br><br>
of treatment combining administration of one or more pharmaceutical agents and<br>
one or more lysins administered separately or in combination.<br>
[0147]' Pharmaceuticals that may be used include antimicrobial agents, anti-<br>
inflammatory agents, antiviral agents, local anesthetic agents, corticosteroids,<br>
destructive therapy agents, antifungals, and antiandrogens. Active pharmaceuticals<br>
that may be used in topical formulations include antimicrobial agents, especially<br>
those having anti-inflammatory properties such as dapsone, erythromycin,<br>
minocycline, tetracycline, clindamycin, and other antimicrobials. Weight percentages<br>
for the antimicrobials are from about 0.5% to to about 10%.<br>
[0148]	Local anesthetics include tetracaine, tetracaine hydrochloride,<br>
lidocaine, lidocaine hydrochloride, dyclonine, dyclonine hydrochloride, dimethisoquin<br>
hydrochloride, dibucaine, dibucaine hydrochloride, butambenpicrate, and pramoxine<br>
hydrochloride. An exemplary concentration for local anesthetics is about 0.025% to<br>
about 5% by weight of the total composition. Anesthetics such as benzocaine also<br>
may be used at a preferred concentration of about 2% to about 25% by weight.<br>
[0149]	Corticosteroids that may be used include betamethasone dipropionate,<br>
fluocinolone actinide, betamethasone valerate, triamcinolone actinide, clobetasol<br>
propionate, desoximetasone, diflorasone diacetate, amcinonide, flurandrenolide,<br>
hydrocortisone valerate, hydrocortisone butyrate, and desonide are recommended at<br>
concentrations of about 0.01% to 1.0% by weight. The concentrations for<br>
corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone acetate may be from<br>
about 0.2% to about 5.0% by weight.<br>
[0150]	Destructive therapy agents such as salicylic acid or lactic acid also may<br>
be used. A concentration of about 2% to about 40% by weight may be used.<br>
Cantharidin is may be utilized, for example, in a concentration of about 5% to about<br>
30% by weight. Typical antifungals that may be used in topical compositions and<br>
examples of suitable weight concentrations include: oxiconazole nitrate (0.1% to<br>
5.0%), ciclopirox olamine (0.1% to 5.0%), ketoconazole (0.1% to 5.0%), miconazole<br>
nitrate (0.1% to 5.0%), and butoconazole nitrate (0.1% to 5.0%). Other topical<br>
agents may be included to address a variety of topical co-infections that may occur<br>
as will be appreciated by skilled artisans.<br>
-53-<br><br>
[0151]	Typically, treatments using a combination of drugs include antibiotics in<br>
combination with local anesthetics such as polymycin B sulfate and neomycin sulfate<br>
in combination with tetracaine for topical antibiotic gels to provide prophylaxis<br>
against infection and relief of pain. Another example is the use of minoxidil in<br>
combination with a corticosteroid such as betamethasone diproprionate for the<br>
treatment of alopecia ereata. The combination of an anti-inflammatory such as<br>
cortisone with an antifungal such as ketoconazole for the treatment of tinea<br>
infections is also an example.<br>
[0152]	The composition may comprise dapsone and ethoxydiglycol, which<br>
allows for an optimized ratio of micro particulate drug to dissolved drug. This ratio<br>
determines the amount of drug delivered, compared to the amount of drug retained<br>
in or above the stratum corneum to function in the supracomeum domain. The<br>
system of dapsone and ethoxydiglycol may include purified water combined with<br>
"CARBOPOL®" gelling polymer, methylparaben, propylparaben, titanium dioxide,<br>
BHA, and a caustic material to neutralize the "CARBOPOL®"<br>
[0153]	In order to accelerate treatment of the infection, the therapeutic agent<br>
may further include at least one complementary agent that may also potentiate the<br>
bactericidal activity of the lytic enzyme. The complementary agent can be<br>
erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin, other members of the<br>
macrolide family, penicillins, cephalosporins, and any combinations thereof in<br>
amounts that are effective to synergistically enhance the therapeutic effect of the<br>
lytic enzyme. Virtually any other antibiotic may be used with the modified lytic<br>
enzyme. Similarly, other lytic enzymes may be included in the carrier to treat other<br>
bacterial infections. Holin proteins may be included in the therapeutic treatment.<br>
[0154]	In some examples, a mild surfactant in an amount effective to<br>
potentiate the therapeutic effect of the modified lytic enzyme may be used in or in<br>
combination with a therapeutic composition. Suitable mild surfactants include, inter<br>
alia, esters of polyoxyethylene sorbitan and fatty acids (Tween series), octylphenoxy<br>
polyethoxy ethanol (Triton X series), n Octyl beta.D glucopyranoside, n Octyl betaD<br>
thioglucopyranoside, n Decai beta D glucopyranoside, n Dodecyl betaD<br>
glucopyranoside, and biologically occurring surfactants, e.g., fatty acids, glycerides,<br>
monoglycerides, deoxycholate and esters of deoxycholate.<br>
-54-<br><br>
Administration of Compositions Comprising Lysins<br>
[0155]	Therapeutic compositions comprising one or more lytic enzymes, such<br>
as PlyGBS, or variants or fragments thereof, can be administered to a subject by any<br>
suitable means. Means of application of the lytic enzyme(s) (modified or unmodified)<br>
include, but are not limited to direct, indirect, carrier and special means or any<br>
combination of means. Direct application of the lytic enzyme may be by nasal<br>
sprays, nasal drops, nasal ointments, nasal washes, nasal injections, nasal<br>
packings, bronchial sprays and inhalers, or indirectly through use of throat lozenges,<br>
mouthwashes or gargles, or through the use of ointments applied to the nasal nares,<br>
or any combination of these and similar methods of application. The forms in which<br>
the lytic enzyme may be administered include but are not limited to lozenges,<br>
troches, candies, injectants, chewing gums, tablets, powders, sprays, liquids,<br>
ointments, and aerosols. It is most probable that exposure to the GBS bacteriawiU<br>
be through the nose. It is best to be treated for exposure to the bacteria as soon as<br>
possible.<br>
[0156]	When the lytic enzyme(s) is introduced directly by use of nasal sprays,<br>
nasal drops, nasal ointments, nasal washes, nasal injections, nasal packing,<br>
bronchial sprays, oral sprays, and inhalers, the enzyme may be in a liquid or gel<br>
environment, with the liquid acting as the carrier. A dry anhydrous version of the<br>
modified enzyme may be administered by the inhaler and bronchial spray, although<br>
a liquid form of delivery also may be used.<br>
[0157]	The lozenge, tablet, or gum into which the enzyme is added may<br>
contain sugar, corn syrup, a variety of dyes, non sugar sweeteners, flavorings, any<br>
binders, or combinations thereof. Similarly, any gum based products may contain<br>
acacia, carnauba wax, citric acid, corn starch, food colorings, flavorings, non sugar<br>
sweeteners, gelatin, glucose, glycerin, gum base, shellac, sodium saccharin, sugar,<br>
water, white wax, cellulose, other binders, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0158]	Lozenges may further contain sucrose, corn starch, acacia, gum<br>
tragacanth, anethole, linseed, oleoresin, mineral oil, and cellulose, other binders, and<br>
combinations thereof. In another example of the disclosure, sugar substitutes are<br>
used in place of dextrose, sucrose, or other sugars.<br>
-55-<br><br>
[0159]	As noted above, the enzyme also may be placed in a nasal spray,<br>
where the spray is the carrier. The nasal spray can be a long acting or timed release<br>
spray, and can be manufactured by means well known in the art. An inhalant also<br>
may be used, so that the enzyme may reach further down into the bronchial tract,<br>
including into the lungs.<br>
[0160]	Any of the carriers for the lytic enzyme may be manufactured by<br>
conventional means. However, it is preferred that any mouthwash or similar type<br>
products not contain alcohol to prevent denaturing of the enzyme, although enzymes<br>
in liposomes and in other protective modes and forms may be used in alcohol.<br>
Similarly, when the enzyme(s) is (are) being placed in a cough drop, gum, candy or<br>
lozenge during the manufacturing process, such placement should be made prior to<br>
the hardening of the lozenge or candy but after the cough drop or candy has cooled<br>
somewhat, to avoid heat denaturation of the enzyme. The enzyme may also be<br>
sprayed over the surface of the cough drop gum, candy, or lozenge, in high enough<br>
dosages to be effective.<br>
[0161]	The enzyme may be added to these substances in a liquid form or in a<br>
lyophilized state, whereupon it will be solubilized when it meets body fluids such as<br>
saliva. The enzyme also may be in a micelle or liposome.<br>
Dosage of Lysins<br>
[0162]	The effective dosage rates or amounts of the enzyme(s) to treat the<br>
infection will depend in part on whether the enzyme(s) will be used therapeutically or<br>
prophylactically, the duration of exposure of the recipient to the infectious bacteria,<br>
the size and weight of the individual, etc. The duration for use of the composition<br>
containing the enzyme also depends on whether the use is for prophylactic<br>
purposes, where the use may be hourly, daily or weekly, for a short time period, or<br>
whether the use will be for therapeutic purposes where a more intensive regimen of<br>
the use of the composition may be needed, such that usage may last for hours, days<br>
or weeks, and/or on a daily basis, or at timed intervals during the day. Any dosage<br>
form employed should provide for a minimum number of units for a minimum amount<br>
of time. The concentration of the active units of enzyme that may provide for an<br>
effective amount or dosage of enzyme may be in the range of about 10 units/ml to<br>
-56-<br><br>
about 500,000 units/ml of fluid in the wet or damp environment of the nasal and oral<br>
passages, and topically as well and possibly in the range of about 10, 20, 30,40, 50,<br>
60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 units/ml to about 50,000 units/ml. Representative values thus<br>
include about 200 units/ml, 300 units/ml, 500 units/ml, 1,000 units/ml, 2,500 units/ml,<br>
5,000 units/ml, 10,000 units/ml, 20,000 units/ml, 30,000 units/ml, and 40,000<br>
units/ml. More specifically, time exposure to the active enzyme units may influence<br>
the desired concentration of active enzyme units per ml. It should be noted that<br>
carriers that are classified as "long" or "slow" release carriers (such as, for example,<br>
certain nasal sprays or lozenges) could possess or provide a lower concentration of<br>
active (enzyme) units per ml, but over a longer period of time, whereas a "short" or<br>
"fast" release carrier (such as, for example, a gargle) could possess or provide a<br>
high concentration of active (enzyme) units per ml, but over a shorter period of time.<br>
The amount of active units per ml and the duration of time of exposure depend on<br>
the nature of infection, whether treatment is to be prophylactic or therapeutic, and<br>
other variables. Thus, the number of dosages will be dependent upon the<br>
circumstances and can range from 1-4 times per day or more, with durations from<br>
one day to multiple weeks. Infections can occur in the skin and thus such<br>
compositions may be formulated for topical application as well, using well known<br>
vehicles such as those described in U.S. Patents 6,056,954 and 6,056,955.<br>
Methods of treatment<br>
[0163]	There are a number of advantages to using lytic enzymes to treat<br>
bacterial infections, particularly GBS bacteria. The modular design of lysins, with<br>
their distinct catalytic and binding domains, makes them ideal for domain swapping<br>
experiments in which bacterial specificities and catalytic activities can be improved or<br>
adapted for use against alternate pathogens. Since the catalytic and binding targets<br>
of lysins (peptidoglycan and associated carbohydrates, respectively) are largely<br>
essential for viability, lysin resistance will be rare.<br>
[0164]	"Treatment" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or<br>
preventative measures, where the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) the<br>
targeted pathologic condition or disorder. Those in need of treatment include those<br>
-57-<br><br>
already with the disorder as well as those prone to have the disorder or those in<br>
whom the disorder is to be prevented.<br>
[0165]	"Mammal" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a<br>
mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet<br>
animals, such as dogs, cats, cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, goats, rabbits, etc.<br>
Preferably, the mammal is human.<br>
[0166]	The formulations to be used for in vivo administration are preferably<br>
sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes,<br>
prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. Therapeutic compositions<br>
herein generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for<br>
example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a<br>
hypodermic injection needle.<br>
[0167]	The route of administration is in accord with known methods, e.g.<br>
injection or infusion by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intramuscular,<br>
intraocular, intraarterial or intralesional routes, topical administration, or by sustained<br>
release systems. When treating an bacterial exposure or infection, the lytic enzyme<br>
may be administered in any suitable fashion, including parenterally or through the<br>
oral or nasal cavity.<br>
[0168]	Dosages and desired drug concentrations of pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the present invention may vary depending on the particular use<br>
envisioned. The determination of the appropriate dosage or route of administration<br>
is well within the skill of an ordinary physician. Animal-experiments provide reliable<br>
guidance for the determination of effective doses for human therapy. Interspecies<br>
scaling of effective doses can be performed following the principles laid down by<br>
Mordenti, J. and Chappell, W. "The use of interspecies scaling in toxicokinetics" In<br>
Toxicokinetics and New Drug Development, Yacobi et a/., Eds., Pergamon Press,<br>
New York 1989, pp. 42-96.<br>
[0169]	When in vivo administration of a lytic enzyme is employed, normal<br>
dosage amounts may vary from about 10 ng/kg to up to 100 mg/kg of mammal body<br>
weight or more per day, or about 1 p.g/kg/day to 10 mg/kg/day, depending upon the<br>
route of administration. Guidance as to particular dosages and methods of delivery<br>
is also provided below, as well as in the literature. It is anticipated that different<br>
-58-<br><br>
formulations will be effective for different treatment compounds and different<br>
disorders, that administration targeting one organ or tissue, for example, may<br>
necessitate delivery in a manner different from that to another organ or tissue.<br>
[0170]	Where sustained-release administration of a lytic enzyme is desired in<br>
a formulation with release characteristics suitable for the treatment of any disease or<br>
disorder requiring administration of the lytic enzyme, microencapsulation of the lytic<br>
enzyme is contemplated. Microencapsulation of recombinant proteins for sustained<br>
release has been successfully performed with human growth hormone (rhGH),<br>
interferon-(rhlFN-), interleukin-2, and MN rgp120. Johnson et a/., Nat. Med., 2:795-<br>

[0171]	The sustained-release formulations of these proteins can use poly-<br>
lactic-coglycolic acid (PLGA) polymer due to its biocompatibility and wide range of<br>
biodegradable properties. The degradation products of PLGA, lactic and glycolic<br>
acids, can be cleared quickly within the human body. Moreover, the degradability of<br>
this polymer can be adjusted from months to years depending on its molecular<br>
weight and composition. Lewis, "Controlled release of bioactive agents from<br>

Cutaneous Infection<br>
[0172]	Compositions for treating topical infections comprise an effective<br>
amount of at least one lysin produced according to this disclosure and a carrier for<br>
delivering at least one lytic enzyme to the infected skin. The mode of application for<br>
the lytic enzyme includes a number of different types and combinations of carriers<br>
which include, but are not limited to an aqueous liquid, an alcohol base liquid, a<br>
water soluble gel, a lotion, an ointment, a nonaqueous liquid base, a mineral oil<br>
base, a blend of mineral oil and petrolatum, lanolin, liposomes, protein carriers such<br>
-59-<br><br>
as serum albumin or gelatin, powdered cellulose carmel, and combinations thereof.<br>
A mode of delivery of the carrier containing the therapeutic agent includes, but is not<br>
limited to a smear, spray, a time-release patch, a liquid absorbed wipe, and<br>
combinations thereof. The lytic enzyme may be applied to a bandage either directly<br>
or in one of the other carriers. The bandages may be sold damp or dry, where the<br>
enzyme is in a lyophilized form on the bandage. This method of application is most<br>
effective for the treatment of infected skin.<br>
[0173]	The carriers of topical compositions may comprise semi-solid and gel-<br>
like vehicles that include a polymer thickener, water, preservatives, active<br>
surfactants or emulsifiers, antioxidants, sun screens, and a solvent or mixed solvent<br>
system. U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,560 (Osborne) discusses a number of different carrier<br>
combinations that can aid in the exposure of the skin to a medicament.<br>
[0174]	Polymer thickeners that may be used include those known to one<br>
skilled in the art, such as hydrophilic and hydroalcoholic gelling agents frequently<br>
used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. The hydrophilic or<br>
hydroalcoholic gelling agent can comprise, for example, "CARBOPOL®" (S.F.<br>
Goodrich, Cleveland, Ohio), "HYPAN®" (Kingston Technologies, Dayton, N.J.),<br>
"NATROSOL®" (Aqualon, Wilmington, Del.), "KLUCEL®" (Aqualon, Wilmington,<br>
Del.), or "STABILEZE®" (ISP Technologies, Wayne, N.J.). The gelling agent may<br>
comprise between about 0.2% to about 4% by weight of the composition. More<br>
particularly, examples of the compositional weight percent range for "CARBOPOL®"<br>
may be between about 0.5% to about 2%, while the weight percent range for<br>
"NATROSOL®" and "KLUCEL®" may be between about 0.5% to about 4%. A<br>
compositional weight percent range for both "HYPAN®" and "STABILEZE®" may be<br>
between about 0.5% to about 4%.<br>
[0175]	"CARBOPOL®" is one of numerous cross-linked acrylic acid polymers<br>
that are given the general adopted name carbomer. These polymers dissolve in<br>
water and form a clear or slightly hazy gel upon neutralization with a caustic material<br>
such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, triethanolamine, or other amine<br>
bases. "KLUCEL®" is a cellulose polymer that is dispersed in water and forms a<br>
uniform gel upon complete hydration. Other gelling polymers include<br>
-60-<br><br>
hydroxyethylcellulose, cellulose gum, MVE/MA decadiene crosspolymer, PVM/MA<br>
copolymer, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0176]	Preservatives also may be used in this invention and may comprise, for<br>
example, about 0.05% to 0.5% by weight of the total composition. The use of<br>
preservatives assures that if the product is microbially contaminated, the formulation<br>
will prevent or diminish microorganism growth. Some preservatives useful in this<br>
invention include methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, chloroxylenol,<br>
sodium benzoate, DMDM Hydantoin, 3-!odo-2-Propylbutyl carbamate, potassium<br>
sorbate, chlorhexidine digluconate, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0177]	Titanium dioxide may be used as a sunscreen to serve as prophylaxis<br>
against photosensitization. Alternative sun screens include methyl cinnamate.<br>
Moreover, BHA may be used as an antioxidant, as well as to protect ethoxydiglycol<br>
and/or dapsone from discoloration due to oxidation. An alternate antioxidant is BHT.<br>
[0178]	In one example, the invention comprises a dermatological composition<br>
having about 0.5% to 10% carbomer and about 0.5% to 10% of a pharmaceutical<br>
that exists in both a dissolved state and a micro particulate state. The dissolved<br>
pharmaceutical has the capacity to cross the stratum corneum, whereas the micro<br>
particulate pharmaceutical does not. Addition of an amine base, potassium,<br>
hydroxide solution, or sodium hydroxide solution completes the formation of the gel.<br>
More particularly, the pharmaceutical may include dapsone, an antimicrobial agent<br>
having anti-inflammatory properties. One exemplayr ratio of micro particulate to<br>
dissolved dapsone is five or less.<br>
[0179]	In another example, the invention comprises about 1% carbomer,<br>
about 80-90% water, about 10% ethoxydiglycol, about 0.2% methylparaben, about<br>
0.3% to 3.0% dapsone including both micro particulate dapsone and dissolved<br>
dapsone, and about 2% caustic material. More particularly, the carbomer may<br>
include "CARBOPOL® 980" and the caustic material may include sodium hydroxide<br>
solution.<br>
[0180]	In one example, if there is a bacterial infection of the upper respiratory<br>
tract, the infection can be prophylactically or therapeutically treated with a<br>
composition comprising an effective amount of at least one lytic enzyme produced by<br>
a bacteria being infected with a bacteriophage specific for that bacteria, and a carrier<br>
-61-<br><br>
for delivering the lytic enzyme to a mouth, throat, or nasal passage. The lytic<br>
enzyme may be a lytic enzyme, a chimeric lytic enzyme, and/or shuffled lytic enzyme<br>
which may be used in conjunction with a holin protein or a combination thereof. The<br>
lytic enzyme may be in an environment having a pH which allows for activity of the<br>
lytic enzyme. If an individual has been exposed to someone with the upper<br>
respiratory disorder, the lytic enzyme will reside in the mucosal lining and prevent<br>
any colonization of the infecting bacteria.<br>
Parenteral Administration<br>
[0181]	In some examples, an infection may be treated parenterally. The<br>
enzymes which can be used are, as above, lytic enzymes, chimeric lytic, enzymes,<br>
shuffled lytic enzymes, and combinations thereof. The enzymes can be<br>
administered intramuscularly, intravenously, subcutaneously, subdermally, or<br>
combinations thereof. In one example, infections may be treated by injecting into the<br>
patient a therapeutic agent comprising the appropriate shuffled and/or chimeric lytic<br>
enzyme(s) and a carrier for the enzyme. The carrier may be comprised of distilled<br>
water, a saline solution, albumin, a serum, or any combinations thereof. More<br>
specifically, solutions for infusion or injection may be prepared in a conventional<br>
manner, e.g. with the addition of preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoates or<br>
stabilizers such as alkali metal salts of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, which may<br>
then be transferred into fusion vessels, injection vials or ampules. Alternatively, the<br>
compound for injection may be lyophilized either with or without the other ingredients<br>
and be solubilized in a buffered solution or distilled water, as appropriate, at the time<br>
of use. Non aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils, liposomes, and ethyl oleate are<br>
also useful herein. Other phage associated lytic enzymes, along with a holin protein,<br>
may be included in the composition.<br>
[0182]	In cases where intramuscular injection is the chosen mode of<br>
administration, an isotonic formulation may be used. Generally, additives for<br>
isotonicity can include sodium chloride, dextrose, mannitol, sorbitol and lactose. In<br>
some cases, isotonic solutions such as phosphate buffered saline are used.<br>
Stabilizers include gelatin and albumin. In some examples, a vasoconstriction agent<br>
is added to the formulation. The pharmaceutical preparations are provided sterile<br>
-62-<br><br>
and pyrogen free. Generally, as noted above, intravenous injection may be most<br>
appropriate.<br>
[0183]	The carrier suitably contains minor amounts of additives such as<br>
substances that enhance isotonicity and chemical stability. Such materials are non<br>
toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers<br>
such as phosphate, citrate, succinate, acetic acid, and other organic acids or their<br>
salts; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about ten<br>
residues) polypeptides, e.g., polyarginine or tripeptides; proteins, such as serum<br>
albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone; glycine; amino acids such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid,<br>
histidine, or arginine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates<br>
including cellulose or its derivatives, glucose, mannose, trehalose, or dextrins;<br>
chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; counter<br>
ions such as sodium; non ionic surfactants such as polysorbates, poloxamers, or<br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG); and/or neutral salts, e.g., NaCI, KCI, MgCb, CaCb, etc.<br>
[0184]	Glycerin or glycerol (1,2,3 propanetriol) is commercially available for<br>
pharmaceutical use. Glycerin or glycerol may be diluted in sterile water for injection,<br>
or sodium chloride injection, or other pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous injection<br>
fluid, and used in concentrations of 0.1 to 100% (v/v), 1.0 to 50% or about 20%.<br>
[0185]	DMSO, is an aprotic solvent with a remarkable ability to enhance<br>
penetration of many locally applied drugs. DMSO may be diluted in sterile water for<br>
injection, or sodium chloride injection, or other pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous<br>
injection fluid, and used in concentrations of 0.1 to 100% (v/v). The vehicle also may<br>
include Ringer's solution, a buffered solution, and dextrose solution, particularly<br>
when an intravenous solution is prepared.<br>
[0186]	Prior to, or at the time the enzyme is put in the carrier system or oral<br>
delivery mode, it may be desirable for the enzymes be in a stabilizing buffer<br>
environment, maintaining a pH range between about 5.0 and about 7.5.<br>
[0187]	The stabilizing buffer should allow for the optimum activity of the<br>
enzyme. The buffer may be a reducing reagent, such as dithiothreitol. The<br>
stabilizing buffer also may be or include a metal chelating reagent, such as<br>
ethylenediaminetetracetic acid disodium salt, or it also may contain a phosphate or<br>
-63-<br><br>
citrate phosphate buffer. The buffers found in the carrier can serve to stabilize the<br>
environment for the lytic enzymes.<br>
[0188]	The effective dosage rates or amounts of the enzyme to be<br>
administered parenterally, and the duration of treatment will depend in part on the<br>
seriousness of the infection, the weight of the patient, the duration of exposure of the<br>
recipient to the infectious bacteria, the seriousness of the infection, and a variety of a<br>
number of other variables. The composition may be applied anywhere from once to<br>
several times a day, and may be applied for a short or long term period. The usage<br>
may last for days or weeks. Any dosage form employed should provide for a<br>
minimum number of units for a minimum amount of time. The concentration of the<br>
active units of enzyme believed to provide for an effective amount or dosage of<br>
enzyme may be in the range of about 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100<br>
units/ml to about 10,000,000 units/ml of composition, in a range of about 1000<br>
units/ml to about 10,000,000 units/ml, and from about 10,000 to 10,000,000 units/ml.<br>
The amount of active units per ml and the duration of time of exposure depend on<br>
the nature of infection, and the amount of contact the carrier allows the lytic enzyme<br>
to have. It is to be remembered that the enzyme works best when in a fluid<br>
environment. Hence, effectiveness of the enzyme is in part related to the amount of<br>
moisture trapped by the carrier. The concentration of the enzyme for the treatment<br>
is dependent upon the bacterial count in the blood and the blood volume.<br>
[0189]	In order to accelerate treatment of the infection, the therapeutic agent<br>
may further include at least one complementary agent which may also potentiate the<br>
bactericidal activity of the lytic enzyme. The complementary agent can be any<br>
antibiotic effective against GBS bacteria. Similarly, other lytic enzymes may be<br>
included to treat other bacterial infections.<br>
[0190]	Additionally, a number of methods can be used to assist in transporting<br>
the enzyme across the cell membrane. The enzyme can be transported in a<br>
liposome, with the enzyme be "inserted" in the liposomes by known techniques.<br>
Similarly, the enzyme may be in a reverse micelle. The enzyme may also be<br>
pegylated, attaching the polyethylene glycol to the non-active part of the enzyme.<br>
Alternatively, hydrophobic molecules can be used to transport the enzyme across<br>
-64-<br><br>
the cell membrane. Finally, the glycosylation of the enzyme can be used to target<br>
specific internalization receptors on the membrane of the cell.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Materials<br>
[0191]	Restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs<br>
(Beverly, MA). All reagents used were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless<br>
otherwise indicated. Bacteria strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in<br>
Table 3 at the end of the Examples.<br>
Example 1: Cloning and sequence alignment of PlyGBS<br>
[0192]	Clones of the GBS phage NCTC11261 genomic library were screened<br>
for a possible lysin gene on a GBS NCTC11237 bacterial overlay. The full sequence<br>
of the lysin gene (plyGBS) was obtained by sequencing of the phage NCTC11261<br>
genomic DNA. Similarity searches indicated that at both the nucleotide and amino<br>
acid level this gene was over 90% identical to several lysins from various<br>
streptococcal species, including GBS phage B30 lysin (SEQ ID NO:1)(GenBank<br>
accession number AAN28166), Streptococcus pyogenes M1 phage-associated lysin<br>
(AAK33905), and Streptococcus equi phage-associated protein (AF186180).<br>
[0193]	Alignment of the putative PlyGBS protein sequence with pneumococcal<br>
phage Cp-1 lysin (Cpl-1) and staphylococcal phage 187 lysin (Ply187) indicated that<br>
PlyGBS has three different domains. The N-terminal 107 amino acids are 27%<br>
identical to a domain in Ply187 that functions as an endopeptidase. For amino acids<br>
150-394 (central domain), PlyGBS displays 46% identity to the N-terminal<br>
muramidase domain of Cpl-1. Two acidic amino acids, Asp and Glu, are also present<br>
in PlyGBS at positions 158 (Asp) and 185 (Glu).<br>
Example 2: Characterization of PlyGBS<br>
[0194]	Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, PlyGBS has a theoretical<br>
pi value (isoelectric point) of 4.88. With 25 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.4) as elution buffer in<br>
ion-exchange chromatography, the protein was negatively charged and bound to a<br>
positively charged Q-Sepharose anion exchanger. The enzyme was eluted by an<br>
-65-<br><br>
NaCI gradient and the active fractions were pooled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.<br>
The major protein band at about 50 KDa correlated with the calculated molecular<br>
mass for PlyGBS (49.6 KDa). The final preparation, estimated to be &gt;95% pure by<br>
scanning densitometry on the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel, was used for all<br>
subsequent experiments.<br>
[0195]	The pH optimum of purified PlyGBS was determined to be around 5.0<br>
with an active pH range between 4.0.0. Gel filtration chromatography of PlyGBS<br>
indicates that the protein functions as a monomer.<br>
Example 3: PlyGBS activity in vitro (optical density In vitro lytic killing assay)<br>
[0196]	To test the in vitro PlyGBS activity on various bacterial strains, all<br>
strains were inoculated overnight, subcultured (1:100), and grown to OD6oo= 0.3.<br>
Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1/10 volume of phosphate buffer (40 mM,<br>
pH 5.0). 100 microliter aliquots of the bacteria solution (5x108-109 cfu / ml) were<br>
incubated with indicated amounts of PlyGBS at 37 degrees C for 60 min. A<br>
spectrophotometer was used to monitor the lytic activity, measured as the drop in<br>
milliOD6oo per minute (-mOD6oo / min). The initial velocity of this reaction is defined<br>
as the rate of lysis. To determine bacteria viability, cells of GBS strain NCTC11237<br>
from the above assay were centrifuged, diluted and plated on THY agar plates for<br>
cell counts. All experiments were performed in triplicates and control experiments<br>
with the addition of phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) were performed under the same<br>
conditions.<br>
[0197]	To determine the PlyGBS activity in vitro against GBS cells, GBS cells<br>
(NCTC 11237, serotype IIIR) were mixed with 40 units of PlyGBS at 37 degrees C<br>
for 60 min. The OD6oo dropped to baseline within 10 min indicating a rapid rate of<br>
cell lysis, which is corroborated by the 2 log decrease in viability observed at 60<br>
minutes. When multiple strains of GBS, representing serotypes la, lb, Ic/ll, MR, IIIR<br>
as well as the predominant serotypes III, and V, were tested for PlyGBS sensitivity<br>
based on lytic activity, a similar velocity of lysis (-mODeoo / min) was observed with<br>
certain strain-to-strain variation.<br>
[0198]	In addition to GBS, bacterial strains representing a variety of species<br>
were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to PlyGBS in vitro. Of the tested<br>
streptococcal strains belonging to different Lancefield groups, PlyGBS had<br>
-66-<br><br>
significant lytic activity against groups A, C, G and L streptococci, with little to no<br>
activity against groups D, E and N. The muralytic activity of the PlyGBS was also<br>
tested against non-Lancefield oral streptococcal species including S. gordonii, S.<br>
oralis, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, and S. mutans. PlyGBS had medium to low activity<br>
against S. salivarius, S. gordonii and S. mutans, but no activity against the other two<br>
commensal species tested. No lytic activity was observed with two non-<br>
streptococcal gram-positive species, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, or<br>
two vaginal commensal bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. crispatus.<br>
[0199]	Phase contrast and electron microscopy were used to visualize the lytic<br>
effect of lysin on GBS cells (an example of "lytic activity"). Normally, intact GBS form<br>
short chains in a buffer control. After treatment with PlyGBS lysin, the cells were<br>
lysed, releasing the cytoplasmic contents and becoming opaque by light microscopy.<br>
As seen with other lysins by electron microscopy, a weakness in the cell wall<br>
produced by PlyGBS results in extrusions and rupture of the cytoplasmic membrane,<br>
which appears to be more localized within the septum region of the dividing cells.<br>
Subsequent loss of cytoplasmic contents transforms the cells into empty "cell<br>

Example 4: PlyGBS activity in vivo (mouse model In vivo killing assay)<br>
[0200]	Six-week-old BALB/c female mice were purchased from Charles River<br>
Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Because bacterial colonization in the mouse vaginal<br>
cavity is believed to be more efficient at estrus, the estral cycle of all mice was<br>
synchronized on day 1 by subcutaneous inoculation of 0.1 mg of p-estradiol<br>
valerate. On day 3, thirty mice were anesthetized and inoculated vaginally with ~106<br>
streptomycin resistant GBS NCTC11237 cells using a micropipette (20 |JLI dose in 40<br>
mM phosphate buffer, pH 5.0). On day 4, mice were treated vaginally with 20 p.l<br>
phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) and swabbed with calcium alginate fiber tipped ultrafine<br>
swabs (Fischer, Pittsburgh, PA). The surfaces of THY agar plates containing 5%<br>
sheep blood and streptomycin (200 jig/ml) were streaked with the wet swabs to<br>
determine baseline colonization. Mice were then randomized to be treated vaginally<br>
with either 20 u.l phosphate buffer, pH 5.0 (n=15) or 10 units of PlyGBS lysin (n=15).<br>
At 2 and 4 hrs post-treatment, all mice were swabbed again for titer determination.<br>
-67-<br><br>
[0201]	To test if PlyGBS can be used for postpartum treatment of newborns,<br>
38 mice received an upper respiratory challenge of about 108 StrR GBS<br>
NCTC11237 cells (20 (jJ orally and 20 \i\ to each nostril). The next morning, mice<br>
were oropharyngeally swabbed and baseline colonization was enumerated as<br>
described above. Mice were randomized and administrated orally and nasally with<br>
either 20 \i\ phosphate buffer, pH 5.0 (n=18) or 10 Units PlyGBS lysin (n=20). At 2<br>
and 24 hrs post-treatment, all mice were oropharyngeally swabbed to determine the<br>
bacterial count.<br>
[0202]	For statistical analysis, MIXED Model (from SAS Mixed Procedure) was<br>
used to compare the colonization status between groups. A P value 
considered significant.<br>
[0203]	An in vivo killing assay was performed to assess the in vivo lytic activity<br>
of PlyGBS was tested by administering PlyGBS to colonized GBS in a mouse vagina<br>
model. To perform this test, two groups of mice were challenged vaginally with 106<br>
cfu StrR GBS cells. Subsequently, 24 hours later, the vaginal cavities were swabbed<br>
to determine the initial colonization rate (0 hr samples, pre-treatment). The mice<br>
were then treated vaginally with either buffer (n=15) or PlyGBS (n=15) and swabbed<br>
2 hrs and 4 hrs post-treatment. Negligible effect was observed in the buffer control<br>
animals. In contrast, animals treated with a single dose of PlyGBS showed a<br>
significant reduction (approximately 3 log drop) in the bacterial load at both the 2 hr<br>
and 4 hr intervals when compared to buffer control (p
[0204]	Similarly, two groups of mice were challenged with a total of 108 cfu<br>
StrR GBS delivered orally and nasally to determine if PlyGBS can be used to reduce<br>
colonized GBS in the mouse upper respiratory tract. Mice treated with a single dose<br>
of lysin by the same route exhibited a significant reduction in GBS colonization at<br>
both the 2 hr and 24 hr swabbing intervals when compared to the buffer control<br>
group (p
Example 5: PlyGBS Mutant Lysin Production by mutagenesis using an E. coli<br>
mutator strain<br>
[0205]	Escherichia coli XL-1 Red strain (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA, Table<br>
3) was used to generate random mutations in PlyGBS due to deficiency in three<br>
primary DNA repair pathways {muts, mutD, and mut~F) that result in a significantly<br>
-68-<br><br>
higher mutation rate than the wild-type strain. Plasmid pCQJ67-2 containing the wild<br>
type plyGBS gene was transformed into E. coli XL-1 Red and propagated on LB<br>
plates supplemented with kanamycin (50 ug / ml) 37 degrees C overnight. Colonies<br>
were scraped from the agar plates and subcultured (1:100) for another overnight<br>
growth, allowing mutations to accumulate in the plasmid DNA. The next morning,<br>
the culture was subcultured to grow for an extra 6 hr and plasmid DNA was<br>
prepared. The resultant plasmids containing random mutations were transformed<br>
into the protein expression strain E. coli BL21(DE3) and over 5,000 clones were<br>
screened for lysin activity better than wild type PlyGBS, using the clear zone method<br>
as previously described in Schuch, R., D. Nelson, and V. A. Fischetti, "A bacteriolytic<br>
agent that detects and kills Bacillus anthracis," Nature 418: 884-889 (2002). To<br>
avoid any potential mutations in promoter region, plasmid DNA from clones with<br>
better than wild type activity was prepared and digested with Ncol and Xhol. The<br>
released plyGBS gene fragment was cloned into pET28a and the resultant plasmid<br>
was transform into E. coli BL21(DE3) to confirm the increased lysin activity. DNA<br>
sequence analysis was used to locate the mutations.<br>
Example 6: Gene mutagenesis using error-prone PCR method.<br>
[0206]	Another mutagenesis method utilized was the "Diversify PCR Random<br>
Mutagenesis Kit" (BD Bioscience, Palo Alto, CA). The procedure involves<br>
performing a PCR reaction under conditions that reduce the fidelity of nucleotide<br>
incorporation, cloning the resulting PCR fragments, and then screening the library for<br>
novel mutations with improved lysin activity. The PCR mutation rate was chosen<br>
around 2.7 per 1,000 bp by keeping the manganese concentration at 320 uM in the<br>
reaction. Two PCR primers are listed in Cheng, Q.et al., "Removal of group B<br>
streptococci colonizing the vagina and oropharynx of mice with a bacteriophage lytic<br>
enzyme," Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 49: 111-117 (2005). The PCR product<br>
was digested with Ncol and Xhol, and cloned into pET28a for screening, using the<br>
method mentioned above. Multiple rounds of PCR mutagenesis were performed to<br>
improve the lysin activity.<br>

Example 7: Construction of plyGBS deletion mutants.<br>
[0207]	Several deletion mutants were constructed based on the domain<br>
organization of wild-type plyGBS and a schematic map is shown in Fig. 4. All the<br>
regions were PCR-amplified and cloned into pET28a for protein expression. Mutant<br>
PlyGBS92 (SEQ ID NO:6), expressed from the plasmid pCQJ92 (Table 3), encodes<br>
the putative muramidase domain [amino acid (aa) 150-394]. Mutant PlyGBS93<br>
(SEQ ID NO:7) contains the region of aa 150-443, which deletes the N-terminal<br>
endopeptidase domain. Mutant PlyGBS94 (SEQ ID NO:8), expressed from pCQJ94<br>
(Table 3), contains the first 146 aa that is the putative endopeptidase domain.<br>
Another mutant, PlyGBS95 (SEQ ID NO:9), containing a deletion of the central<br>
muramidase domain (deletion between aa 147-348), was expressed from pCQJ95<br>
constructed by inserting the Hindlll / Xhol digested PCR fragment (C-terminus of<br>
plyGBS gene, bp 1045- 1332) into pCQJ94. All the constructed plasmids for mutant<br>
expression were sequenced to confirm the expected deletion.<br>
Example 8: Comparison of lysin activity and stability.<br>
[0208]	To compare the lysin activity of various mutants, clones were grown<br>
and induced for protein over-expression in 10 ml volumes under the same condition<br>
described in Cheng, Q.ef a/., "Removal of group B streptococci colonizing the vagina<br>
and oropharynx of mice with a bacteriophage lytic enzyme,"Antimicrob. Agents<br>
Chemother. 49: 111-117 (2005). Protein crude extracts were used for the in vitro<br>
activity assay. In order to quantitate the protein activity, large batch (1 liter) cultures<br>
were made of each mutant. Because the mutants had a similar pi (Isoelectric point)<br>
to the wild-type enzyme (Table 1), purification was achieved by anion exchange<br>
chromatography as described Cheng, Q.ef a/., "Removal of group B streptococci<br>
colonizing the vagina and oropharynx of mice with a bacteriophage lytic<br>
enzyme,"Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 49: 111-117 (2005). Active fractions were<br>
pooled and electrophoresed on a 4-20% gradient Tris-HCI pre-cast SDS-PAGE gel<br>
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Lysin activity was quantitated as described in Cheng, Q.et<br>
a/., "Removal of group B streptococci colonizing the vagina and oropharynx of mice<br>
with a bacteriophage lytic enzyme,"Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 49: 111-117<br>
(2005). Protein concentration was determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce,<br>
Rockford, IL) to calculate the specific activity for each mutant.<br>
-70-<br><br>
[0209]	Because the PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) and PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:4) mutants obtained from random mutagenesis had a specific activity<br>
significantly higher than wild-type PlyGBS, the stability of the mutants was compared<br>
with wild-type under storage conditions. Fresh-purified wild-type PlyGBS, as well as<br>
two mutants PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) and PlyGBS90-8 (SEQ ID NO:4), were<br>
stored directly at 4 degrees C or in 25% glycerol at -80 degrees C. An in vitro<br>
activity assay was performed at different time points (0, 20, 40, and 60 days) using a<br>
spectrophotometer to monitor the lytic activity, measured as the drop in milliOD600<br>
per minute (-mOD600 / min). The in vitro activity assay was performed as described<br>
in Cheng, Q.et a/., "Removal of group B streptococci colonizing the vagina and<br>
oropharynx of mice with a bacteriophage lytic enzyme,"Antimicrob. Agents<br>
Chemother. 49:111-117 (2005). The initial velocity of this reaction (Vmax) is defined<br>
as the rate of lysis and was used to compare protein stability at various time<br>
intervals.<br>
Example 9: Characteristics of hyperactive mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5)<br>
[0210]	Characteristics of the hyperactive mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5)<br>
were compared to compared to wild-type PlyGBS. The in vitro lytic activity of<br>
PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) was measured by two different methods. First, we used<br>
various amount of purified PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) and wild type PlyGBS (2, 10,<br>
50, and 100 ug) in the in vitro assay to measure the Vmax value, as described in<br>
Cheng, Q.et a/., "Removal of group B streptococci colonizing the vagina and<br>
oropharynx of mice with a bacteriophage lytic enzyme,"Antimicrob. Agents<br>
Chemother. 49: 111-117 (2005). We also tested the killing efficacy of mutant<br>
PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) on GBS in an in vitro viability assay, as described in<br>
Cheng, Q.ef a/., "Removal of group B streptococci colonizing the vagina and<br>
oropharynx of mice with a bacteriophage lytic enzyme,"Antimicrob. Agents<br>
Chemother. 49: 111-117 (2005). The specificity and the optimum pH of the mutant<br>
were analyzed as described in Cheng, Q.et a/., "Removal of group B streptococci<br>
colonizing the vagina and oropharynx of mice with a bacteriophage lytic<br>
enzyme,"Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 49:111-117 (2005).<br>
[0211]	To test the effect of salt concentration on lytic activity, purified<br>
PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) and PlyGBS were dialyzed against 2 mM Tris-HCI (pH<br>
-71-<br><br>
7.4) overnight. Various amount of 5M NaCI was added into the dialyzed protein<br>
samples to determine the Vmax values under 0-500 mM salt concentration using a<br>
spectrophotometer, as described in Cheng, Q.ef a/., "Removal of group B<br>
streptococci colonizing the vagina and oropharynx of mice with a bacteriophage lytic<br>
enzyme,"Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 49:111-117 (2005).<br>
Example 10: In vivo activity of the mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5).<br>
[0212]	The mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5) was tested in vivo against<br>
GBS in a mouse vaginal model developed in a previous study (Cheng, Q., D.<br>
Nelson, S. W. Zhu, and V. A. Fischetti, "Removal of group B streptococci colonizing<br>
the vagina and oropharynx of mice with a bacteriophage lytic enzyme," Antimicrob.<br>
Agents Chemother. 49: 111-117 (2005), incorporated herein by reference). Briefly,<br>
on day 1, the estral cycle of 20 six-week-old BALB/c female mice (Charles River Lab,<br>
Wilmington, MA) were synchronized by li-estradiol valerate (McLean, N. W, and I. J.<br>
Rosenstein, "Characterization and selection of a Lactobacillus species to recolonize<br>
the vagina of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis," J. Med. Microbiol. 49: 543-<br>
552 (2000)). On day 3, the mice were challenged vaginally with 106 colony forming<br>
unit (cfu) StrR NCTC11237 GBS cells. On day 4, the vaginal cavities were swabbed<br>
to determine the colonization status pre-treatment (0 hr samples). The mice were<br>
then randomized into three groups and treated vaginally with either buffer (n=10),<br>
1,500 ug of PlyGBS (n=10), or 1,500 ug of mutant PlyGBS90-1 (SEQ ID NO:5)<br>
(n=10). Mice were then swabbed vaginally 2 hrs and 4 hrs post-treatment. THY<br>
agar plates (Nelson, D., L. Loomis, and V. A. Fischetti, "Prevention and elimination of<br>
upper respiratory colonization of mice by group A streptococci by using a<br>
bacteriophage lytic enzyme," Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98: 4107-4112 (2001),<br>
incorporated herein by reference), supplemented with 5% sheep blood and<br>
streptomycin (200 ug / ml), were used to determine the colony counts from wet<br>
swabs. MIXED Model (from SAS Mixed Procedure) was used to compare the<br>
colonization status between groups in statistical analysis and a P value 
considered significant.<br>
