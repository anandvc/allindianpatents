Field of the invention<br>
This application is patent of addition to our parent application 819/MAS/2002 dated November 08, 2002. The present invention more particularly relates to an improved process for the preparation of cefuroxime sodium of the formula (I).<br><br>
Description of the prior art<br>
Cefuroxime is a valuable broad spectrum antibiotic and having activity<br>
against wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.<br>
Cefuroxime sodium is physiologically acceptable non-toxic salt of cefuroxime and<br>
may be administered to human or used as a veterinary medicine. The preparation<br>
involves the condensation of 3-hydroxymethyl-7-amino cephalosporanic acid with<br>
(fur-2-yl)-2-methoxyimino acetic acid to produce (6R,7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(fur-2-yl)-2-<br>
methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-hydroxymethylceph-3-em-4-carboxylic	acid.<br>
Carbamoylation of resulting acid with isocyanate of formula RNCO wherein R is a labile substituent to get (6R,7R)-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-7-[Z-2-(fur-2-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid (cefuroxime), followed by con/erting the cefuroxime into its sodium salt using mixture of water soluble sodium salt.<br>
US patent 4,775,750 discloses the process for the preparation of the compound of formula (I), which involves carbamoylation of (6R,7R)-7-[Z-2-(fur-2-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-hydroxymethylceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, and in situ preparation of cefuroxime sodium using sodium-2-ethylhexanote. The product obtained from this patent suffers in non-acceptable color and low purity. Reprocessing is needed to get sterile cefuroxime sodium.<br><br>
V<br>
us patent 4,277,601 describes the process for the preparation of cefliroxime sodium as its THF solvate in situ manner. The process described in this patent involves the usage of multiple organic solvent systems and thereby making the process complicated. Moreover, recrystallisation is needed to get the sterile cefliroxime sodium.<br>
The synthesis of cefuroxime disclosed in US 3,966,717 and US 3,974,513 comprises 8 synthetic steps starting from 7-ACA. Such high number of steps, which causes low overall yield, is due to the introduction of two productive groups.<br>
A process for the preparation of cefuroxime starting from 7-ACA has been described in Chemistry and Industry 1984, 217, which do not involve any protective groups.<br>
WO 00/71547 describes a process for the preparation of cefuroxime, which involves enzymatic hydrolysis of 7-glutaryl ACA, which is not industrially viable.<br>
With our continued search and intense investigation, we finally achieved a process for the preparation cefuroxime sodium, which overcomes all difficulties and makes the process industrially viable and yield the title compound in required quantity and quality.<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of cefuroxime sodium of the formula (I), which has better quality such as color and solubility.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide direct manufacturing process for the preparation of sterile crystalline cefuroxime sodium of the formula (I) from cefuroxime acid.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of cefuroxime sodium of the formula (I) in good yield, high purity and with desirable particle size.<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a simple method for the preparation of cefuroxime of the formula (II) in pure form.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of cefuroxime sodium of the formula (I),<br><br>
which comprises the steps of: (i)       dissolving the cefuroxime of the formula (II)<br>
in a water miscible solvent /water at a temperature in the range of 10°C to<br>
50°C, (ii)      charcoalising the solution followed by micron filtration, (iii)     treating the solution resulted form step ii, with mixture of water soluble<br>
sodium salts  of two weak acids  in  suitable  alcoholic  solvent  at a<br>
temperature in the range of lOoC to SOoC and (iv)     isolating the precipitated cefuroxime sodium of the formula (I) in pure<br>
form.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of cefuroxime of the formula (II), which comprises the steps of: (i)       condensing  S-hydroxymethyl-T-amino cephalosporanic  acid of formula<br>
(IV) with activated (fur-2-yl)-2-methoxyimino acetic acid of formula (V) in<br>
the presence of an inorganic base in a solvent at a temperature in the range<br><br>
of-40°C to l0oC and isolating the product by adjusting the pH to 1.5 to 2.5<br>
using      an      acid	to      produce      (6R,7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(fur-2-yl)-2-<br>
methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-hydroxymethylceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid of formula (VI) and (ii) carbamoylating the compound of formula (VI) with isocyanate of formula (VII) wherein R is a labile group in the presence of a solvent at a temperature in the range of -60'C to 0°C to get cefuroxime of the formula (II).<br><br>

Activated carbon was added and stirred for 15 minutes at 25°C. The carbon was filtered and washed the bed with acetone<br><br>
/water. The solution was then passed through series of micron filters in a sterile area. The solution was warmed to 35°C. A mixture of sodium lactate solution (23 gm) (60% solution in water) and sodium acetate (16.5 gm) in ethanol (25 ml) was added to the reaction mixture slowly at 35°C and stirred for 30 minutes.

Activated carbon was added and stirred for 15 minutes at 25°C. The carbon was filtered and washed the bed with acetone /water. The solution was then passed through series of micron filters in a sterile area. The solution was warmed to 35°C. A mixture of sodium lactate solution (23 gm) (60% solution in water) and sodium acetate (16.5 gm) in methanol (450 ml) was added to the reaction mixture slowly at 35°C and stirred for 30 minutes.

Example (3):<br><br>
Preparation   of  (6R,7R)-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-7-[Z-2-(fur-2-yl)-2-methoxy iininoacetamido]-ceph-3-ein-4-carboxylic acid sodium (cefuroxime sodium):<br>
6R,7R)-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-7-[Z-2-(fur-2-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]" ceph-3-em-4"Carboxylic acid (100 gm ) was dissolved in a mixture of acetone (650 ml)/water (80ml) at 25°C. Activated carbon was added and stirred for 15 minutes at 25°C. The carbon was filtered and washed the bed with acetone /water. To the clear filtrate acetone (950 ml) was added and warmed the solution to 39 ± I'^C. A mixture of sodium lactate solution (24 gm) (60% solution in water) and sodium acetate trihydrate (16.8 gm) in methanol (450 ml) was added to the reaction mixture slowly at 39'^C and stirred for 10 minutes. Acetone was decanted from reaction mass, further aqueous acetone was added and decanted till pH of reaction mass becomes 6.5 to 7.0. The product was stirred with IPE (400 ml), filtered, washed with methanol followed by acetone, and dried to produce crystalline cefuroxime sodium.<br>
