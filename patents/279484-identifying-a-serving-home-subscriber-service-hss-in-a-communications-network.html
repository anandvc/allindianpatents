DESCRIPTION<br>
METHODS, SYSTEMS, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCTS FOR<br>
IDENTIFYING A SERVING HOME SUBSCRIBER SERVER (HSS) IN A<br>
COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/934,703, filed June 15, 2007 and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/888,907, filed August 2, 2007; the disclosures of each which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The subject matter described herein relates to optimizing a subscriber locator function (SLF) in an IP multimedia subsystem (IMS). More particularly, the subject matter described herein relates to methods, systems, and computer program products for identifying a serving home subscriber server (HSS) in a communications network.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Internet protocol (IP) multimedia subsystem (IMS) is defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as a mobile network infrastructure that enables the convergence of data, speech, and mobile network technology over an IP-based infrastructure. IMS bridges the gap between the existing traditional telecommunications technology and Internet technology, allowing network operators to offer a standardized, reusable platform with new, innovative services by enhancing real time, multimedia mobile services, such as voice services, video telephony, messaging, conferencing, and push services. IMS can be used to provide services for both mobile networks and fixed networks at the same time, providing unique mixtures of services with transparency to the end-user.<br>
IMS supports the establishment of any type of media session (e.g., voice, video, text, etc.) and provides the service creator the ability to combine services in the same session and dynamically modify sessions (e.g., adding a<br>
 <br>
video component to an existing voice session). As a result, new and innovative user-to-user and multi-user services have become available, such as enhanced voice services, video telephony, chat, push-to-taik, and multimedia conferencing, ail of which are based on the concept of a multimedia session. The underlying IMS infrastructure enables mobile IP communication services via its ability to find a user in the network and then to establish a session with the user. The key IMS components enabling mobility management are the call session control function (CSCF) and home subscriber server (HSS). The CSCF is essentially a proxy, which aids in the setup and management of sessions and forwards messages between IMS networks. The HSS holds aii of the key subscriber information and enables users (or servers) to locate and communicate with other end users.<br>
As the number of subscribers or processing load on an individual HSS increases, it may be desirable for a network operator to include multiple HSSs in a network. If each of the multiple HSSs is identically provisioned, i.e., includes copies of the same subscriber data, the HSSs may operate in a load sharing manner and it is not necessary to have a location function to determine which HSS holds a particular subscriber's data. However, if the multiple HSSs do not include identical data, it is necessary to identify the HSS that contains a particular subscriber's data when attempting to establish a call involving that subscriber. IMS documentation defines a subscriber locator function (SLF) for locating the HSS serving a particular subscriber when the subscriber's network includes multiple HSS functions. However, the implementation of the SLF is not believed to be specified.<br>
Accordingly, there exists a need for improved methods, systems, and computer program products for identifying a serving home subscriber server in a communications network.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
According to one aspect, the subject matter described herein comprises<br>
methods, systems, and computer program products for identifying a serving<br>
home subscriber server (HSS) in a communications network.  One method<br>
includes obtaining a subscriber identifier from a message.   An exceptions-<br>
 <br>
based data structure contained in a database is accessed to locate a database entry associated with the subscriber identifier. Similarly, a range-based data structure contained in the database is accessed to locate the database entry associated with the subscriber identifier if the exceptions-based data structure does not contain the database entry. The method also includes acquiring serving HSS data that corresponds to the located entry from either the exceptions-based data structure and the range-based data structure.<br>
The subject matter described herein for identifying a serving HSS may be implemented using a computer program product comprising computer executable instructions embodied in a computer readable medium. Exemplary computer readable media suitable for implementing the subject matter described herein includes disk memory devices, programmable logic devices, and application specific integrated circuits. In addition, a computer readable medium that implements the subject matter described herein may be distributed across multiple physical devices and/or computing platforms.<br>

 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present subject matter relates to systems and methods for identifying a serving home subscriber server (HSS) in a communications network. Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary communications network 100 in which the present subject matter may be implemented according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, network 100 may include an interrogating call session control function (l-CSCF) 102, a subscriber location function (SLF) 104, and a plurality of home subscriber servers (HSS) 106i„.n. i-CSCF 102 and SLF 104 may each be located and supported by separate application servers in network 100. In other embodiments of the present subject matter, SLF 104 may be co-located / integrated with a network element, such as a CSCF element. In one embodiment, network 100 includes an IMS network.<br>
In one embodiment, l-CSCF 102 may be adapted to receive a call signaling message (e.g., message 121), such as a SIP INVITE message, sent from a calling party (e.g., a calling subscriber) to a called party (e.g., a called subscriber). In an alternate embodiment, a proxy call session control function (P-CSCF) may be adapted to receive the call signaling message. In response to receiving message 121, l-CSCF 102 (or P-CSCF) is configured to subsequently obtain subscriber information (e.g., a subscriber identifier associated with the calling subscriber, such as the calling subscriber number) from the call signaling message. In order to locate a serving HSS of the calling subscriber (which is needed to further service the call), l-CSCF 102 transmits a query message 122 containing the subscriber information to SLF 104.<br>
In one embodiment, SLF 104 is a function that resides on a dedicated application server in network 100. SLF 104 may include database 108, which may be accessed in response to receiving query message 122, which is specifically addressed to SLF 104, Namely, SLF 104 serves the function of storing and providing HSS identification information that identifies a serving HSS node for a given calling subscriber and does not intercept any messages directed to an HSS node or other like registry node (e.g., an HLR). In one embodiment, database 108 may include a hierarchical data structure that contains a range-based section 110 that is made up of block sections or ranges<br>
 <br>
of subscriber identifiers (e.g., subscriber URI values) and corresponding HSS identifiers. Likewise, database 108 may also contain an exceptions-based section 112, which includes subscriber identifiers (i.e., subscriber URI values) that are exceptions to the subscriber identifier-to-HSS identifier associations in ranged-based section 110. The relationship between the two sections is described below in greater detail.<br>
in one embodiment, range-based section 110 contains subscriber identifier data that may include ranges of SIP:URI, TEL:URl,Mai!to:URI, or other URi values. Each entry in section 110 includes an alphabetic or numeric (e.g., E. 164 formatted subscriber identifiers, mobile subscriber ISDN identifiers, plain old telephone service (POTS) identifiers, international mobile station identifiers (IMSI), etc.) range of subscriber identifiers, as defined by the wild card or "*" character in each entry. For example, the entry indicated by E* at VZW.com may include ail subscriber URIs within the VZW.com domain that begin with "E". In another example, the entry indexed by 336241* may correspond to a range of subscriber directory numbers from 3362410000 -3362419999. It should also be noted that the wild card operator is shown in database 108 for illustrative purposes, in an actual implementation, ranges may be identified by values that indicate the start and end of a range. For example, a range of telephone numbers for 9193800000 to 9193809999 may be identified by the telephones at the endpoints of the range, i.e., 9193800000 and 9193809999. Any suitable method for identifying a range is intended to be within the scope of the subject matter described herein.<br>
By utilizing a data structure that employs a range (or block) of subscriber identifiers as opposed to numerous single entries of subscriber identifiers that represent the exact same information, database 108 is capable of storing more subscribers (and serving HSS identification data) in the same amount of space. This configuration also allows for more efficient lookups since fewer entries need to be accessed as SLF 104 attempts to locate an entry that matches the subscriber identifier received in message 122.<br>
Subscriber identifier section 112 of database 108 may include a database section that contains entries of individual subscriber identifier values, such as a SIP:URI value or a Maiito:URI value. Each subscriber identifier entry<br>
 <br>
in section 112 may be associated with a corresponding HSS identifier. Exceptions-based subscriber identifier section 112 may also include numeric or Tei:URi values, such as POTS or mobile telephone numbers. For example, the URI value <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="02476e6e6b67425458552c616d6f">[email&#160;protected]</a> or the telephone number 9193803232 may be included in the exceptions-based data. Each URI value in section 112 has a corresponding HSS identifier (e.g., <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="31745d5d585471676b661f525e5c">[email&#160;protected]</a> is associated with HSS B). In an alternate embodiment, an entry in exceptions-based section 112 may include a range or block of entries not unlike the format in section 110.<br>
As used herein, the term "range-based data" refers to a grouping of data by numeric, alphabetic, or alphanumeric ranges. For example, a range-based grouping of telephone numbers may include a group of telephone numbers that fall within a numeric range. In another example, a range-based grouping of UR!s may be all URls that fall within the same alphanumeric range. The term "exceptions-based-data" refers to data that is within one of the ranges or groupings of range based data or outside of all of the groupings or ranges of range based data. For example, the number 3362415656 in exceptions-based section 112 of database 108 is within the range of 3362410000-3462419999 specified in range based section 110. However, 3362415656 contains a different HSS identifier to the range defined for 336241*. Accordingly, the HSS identification rule for the entry corresponding to 3362415656 is an exception to the rule defined for the remaining entries in the range 336241*. It will be appreciated that according to one embodiment, range-based section 110 of SLF database 108 may be thought of as default SLF routing rules, which are only utilized in the event that an exception-based SLF routing rule could not be located.<br>
Upon receiving a query message (e.g., message 122), SLF 104 initially access and searches exceptions-based section 112 using the subscriber identifier. Namely, SLF 104 compares and attempts to match the subscriber URI with the URI entries in section 112 via a cross-referenced comparison. If a matching entry is found in exceptions-based section 112, then the associated HSS identification data is obtained and provided to the requesting entity (e.g., I-CSCF102). if a match is not located in the exceptions-based section 112, then range-based section 110 is subsequently searched using the subscriber<br>
 <br>
WentffieT. in one embodiment, SLF 104 searches section 110 to determine if the subscriber identifier fails within a designated range specified by an entry.<br>
If a "match" (i.e., if subscriber identifier falls within a range) is located in the ranged-based section 110, then the associated HSS identifier is obtained and provided to the requesting entity. If a match is not located, then a default HSS identifier may be returned or an error indicator may be returned to the requesting entity.<br>
For example, referring to database 108 in Figure 1, <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9adff6f6f3ffdaccc0cdb4f9f5f7">[email&#160;protected]</a> is listed as an exception in section 112. The first entry in section 110 indicates that <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2f6a4643464a6f797578014c4042">[email&#160;protected]</a> would normally be associated with HSS A. Notably, the first entry of section 210 includes a wildcard operator that indicates that all identifiers starting with the letter "E" in the VZW.com domain are supported by HSS A. However, since <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="89cce5e5e0ecc9dfd3dea7eae6e4">[email&#160;protected]</a> is listed as an exception in section 112, this particular subscriber URI is instead supported by HSS B (as indicated) as opposed to HSS A.<br>
Figure 2 is a flow chart illustrating the exemplary steps of a method 200 for determining a serving HSS in a communications network according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. In block 202, a call setup message is received. In one embodiment, l-CSCF 102 receives a SIP INVITE message (e.g., message 121 in Figure 1} intended for a designated called subscriber from a calling subscriber. The INVITE message may include this called and calling subscriber information in the "To" and "From" parameters, respectively, of the message header.<br>
In block 204, the subscriber identifier is obtained from the call signaling message. !n one embodiment, l-CSCF 102 extracts a subscriber URI from INVITE message 121.<br>
In block 206, a query message is sent to an SLF. For example, l-CSCF 102 transmits an SLF query message (e.g., query message 122 in Figure 1), which includes the subscriber identifier, to SLF 104. In one embodiment, query message 122 may be a Diameter query message that includes the subscriber URI value. In this scenario, the connection between l-CSCF 102 and SLF 104 may include a Diameter interface.<br>
 <br>
In block 208, an exceptions data structure is searched using the subscriber identifier, in one embodiment, SLF 104 utilizes the received subscriber identifier to initially query an exceptions-based section 112 of database 108. As mentioned above, exceptions-based section 112 of database 108 includes a list of individual subscriber identifier values (or "sub ranges" of subscriber identifier values) that are exceptions to the range-based entries in section 110,<br>
In block 210, a determination is made as to whether the subscriber identifier matches one of the entries in exceptions-based section 212. In one embodiment, SLF 104 compares the subscriber identifier contained in query message 122 with the entries in section 112. if a matching entry is not found in exceptions-based section 112 by SLF 104, then method 200 continues to block 212. If a matching entry is found, then method 200 proceeds to block 216.<br>
In block 212, a range-based data structure is searched using the subscriber identifier. In one embodiment, SLF 104 utilizes the received subscriber identifier to query a range-based section 112 of database 108 (since SLF 104 did not find an exception that matched the subscriber identifier). For example, SLF 104 compares the subscriber identifier with the ranges listed in section 110 to determine if the subscriber identifier falls within a particular range.<br>
In block 214, a determination as to whether the subscriber identifier is included within a particular range listed in section 110. If a "match" is found (i.e., subscriber identifier is within a listed range), then method 200 continues to block 216. If a "match" is not found, then method 200 proceeds to block 220, where a predefined default HSS identifier is returned to l-CSCF 102. Alternatively, an error message may be sent to l-CSCF 102 indicating that a serving HSS cannot be found in either section 110 or section 112.<br>
In block 216, the serving HSS identification data is obtained, in one embodiment, the SLF 104 acquires the serving HSS identification data associated with the subscriber identifier from database 108 (i.e., either from exceptions section 112 or range section 110). For example, SLF 104 obtains<br>
 <br>
the HSS identifier that corresponds to the matched exceptions-based section entry.<br>
In block 218, the serving HSS identification data (e.g., HSS identifier) is sent to the original querying entity. In one embodiment, after finding a match from either section 110 or section 112, SLF 104 transmits the HSS identification data associated with the subscriber identifier to l-CSCF 102.<br>
In block 222, the serving HSS is queried. In one embodiment, !-CSCF 102 uses the HSS identifier to query the appropriate HSS (e.g., one HSS of HSSs 106i„,n). In one embodiment, i-CSCF 102 attempts to obtain the identity of the S-CSCF that is designated to handle the subscriber's cail from the queried HSS.<br>
In one embodiment, the subject matter described herein may include querying an E.164 number mapping (ENUM) server in order to obtain an E.164 number, which may be used as a subscriber identifier to access an SLF routing data structure (e.g., database 108). Figure 3 illustrates an exemplary communications network 300 in which the present subject matter may be implemented according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. In one embodiment, network 300 is similar to network 100 except for the addition of ENUM server 302 (e.g., a computer supporting an E.164-to-URI mapping function) and ENUM database 304. One reason that it may be desirable to identify an E.164 number corresponding to a URI is that E.164 numbers can be used as access keys to entries corresponding to numeric ranges and exceptions to those ranges in database 108. A query that seeks, from an ENUM server, an E.164 number corresponding to a URi is referred to return as a reverse ENUM query because such a query requests the reverse of the normal! E.164 to URI mapping performed by ENUM servers.<br>
In one embodiment, ENUM server 302 is adapted to receive a reverse ENUM query 323 from SLF 104. Query 323 may include a subscriber identifier, such as a subscriber URI, that is initially received by SLF 104. After receiving query 323, ENUM server 302 uses the subscriber identifier to access database 304 in order to obtain an associated E.164 number via a URI-to-E. 164 number translation. In one embodiment, ENUM database 304 may include a data structure that contains a plurality of URIs and corresponding E.164 numbers<br>
 <br>
(see Figure 3). The associated E.164 number resulting from the reverse ENUM translation is then provided to SLF 104, SLF 104 then uses the E.164 number and is used to search an SLF data structure (e.g., database 108) and determine the serving HSS for the subscriber associated with the E.164 number in a similar manner mentioned above.<br>
Figure 4 is a flow chart illustrating the exemplary steps of a method 400 for determining a serving HSS using an E.164 number in a communications network according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein, in block 402, a call setup message is received. In one embodiment, l-CSCF 102 receives a SfP INVITE message 121 intended for a designated called party from a calling subscriber. The INVITE message may include a subscriber identifier, such as a calling subscriber number or subscriber URi.<br>
In block 404, the subscriber identifier is extracted from the call signaling message, in one embodiment, l-CSCF 102 extracts a subscriber UR! from INVITE message 121.<br>
In block 405, a query message is sent to a SLF. For example, l-CSCF 102 transmits an SLF query message (e.g., query message 122), which includes the subscriber identifier, to SLF 104.<br>
In block 406, a determination is made as to whether the subscriber identifier is an E.164 identifier. In one embodiment, SLF 104 analyzes the subscriber identifier to ascertain whether it is an E.164 based identifier. In one embodiment, SLF 104 recognizes the subscriber identifier to be a subscriber URI that may be associated to an E. 164 number. If the subscriber identifier is found to be an E.164 number, then method 400 proceeds to block 410 and continues normally.<br>
If the subscriber identifier is found not to be an E.164 identifier, then method 400 continues to block 407, where a reverse-ENUM query message containing the subscriber identifier is sent to ENUM server 302. \rt block 408, ENUM server 302 receives the query message and performs a reverse ENUM translation to obtain an E.164 number associated with the subscriber identifier from the ENUM database 304. In block 409, the E.164 number is sent to SLF 104 via a reverse response message 324.<br>
 <br>
In block 410, an exceptions data structure is searched using the subscriber identifier. In one embodiment, SLF 104 utilizes the E.164 number contained in message 324 to initially query an exceptions-based section 112 of database 108.<br>
In block 412, a determination is made as to whether the E.164 number matches one of the entries in exceptions-based section 112. In one embodiment, SLF 104 compares the E.164 number contained in message 122 with the entries in section 112. If a matching entry is not found in exceptions-based section 112 by SLF 104, then method 400 continues to block 414. If a matching entry is found, then method 400 proceeds to block 420.<br>
In block 414, a range-based data structure is searched using the subscriber identifier. In one embodiment, SLF 104 utilizes the received E.164 number to query a range-based section 112 of database 108. For example, SLF 104 compares the subscriber identifier with all of the ranges listed in section 110 to determine if the subscriber identifier falls within a particular range.<br>
in block 416, a determination as to whether the subscriber identifier matches or falls within a particular range listed in section 110. If a match is found, then method 400 continues to block 420. If a match is not found, then method 400 proceeds to block 418, where predefined default HSS identification data is sent to l-CSCF 102. Alternatively, an error message may be sent to I-CSCF 102 indicating that a serving HSS cannot be found in either section 110 or section 112.<br>
In bock 420, the serving HSS identification data is obtained. In one embodiment, the SLF 104 acquires the serving HSS identification data associated with the E.164 number from database 108.<br>
In block 422, the serving HSS identification data (e.g., HSS identifier) is sent to the querying entity. In one embodiment, after finding a match from either section 110 or section 112, SLF 104 transmits the HSS identification data associated with the E.164 number to l-CSCF 102 via a response message 325.<br>
 <br>
!n block 424, the serving HSS is queried. In one embodiment, 1-CSCF 102 uses the HSS identification data to query the appropriate HSS of HSS 106i..,n to obtain the identity of a serving S-CSCF. The method 400 then ends.<br>
In yet another embodiment, it may be desirable for an ENUM translation (i.e., E.164-to-URl translation) to be performed prior to performing SLF processing. In this case, an SLF function of the present subject matter is adapted to query an ENUM function prior to performing SLF processing. For example, an SLF function may receive a query message from a CSCF node that includes a numeric subscriber identifier (e.g., E.164 formatted telephone number). The SLF is adapted to generate an ENUM query that includes the numeric subscriber identifier, and transmit the query to an ENUM function. The SLF receives an ENUM response message, which includes a subscriber URI, from the ENUM function and is adapted to use perform SLF processing (such as that described previously in this disclosure) using the returned subscriber URI.<br>
As described above, the present subject matter relates to various methods, systems, and computer program products for identifying a serving HSS in a communications network. For example, by employing the range-based and exceptions-based data hierarchy, the present subject matter is able to facilitate the storage of data in a highly efficient manner. Thus, more data may be stored in a fewer number of entries in $ database structure. Similarly, by using the associated two-stage lookup procedure, high-speed data searches for identifying a subscriber's serving HSS in an IMS network may be realized.<br>
It will be understood that various details of the subject matter described herein may be changed without departing from the scope of the subject matter described herein. Furthermore, the foregoing conscription is for the purpose of illustration only, and not for the purpose of initiation, as the subject matter described herein is defined by the claims as set forth hereinafter.<br>
