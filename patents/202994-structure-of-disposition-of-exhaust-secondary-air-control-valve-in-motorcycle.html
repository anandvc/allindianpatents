In other words, the fuel cock 90 is mounted to the intake pipe 39. In a state in which the fuel cock 90 has been mounted to the intake pipe 3 9 in this manner, the fuel cock 90 is disposed sideways of the secondary air control valve 48 below the main frame 13 and on the side opposite from the carburetor 38 with respect to the main frame 13.<br>
A bleed air supply line 105 for conducting bleed air to the carburetor 38 is mounted between the air cleaner 37 and the carburetor 38, and a bleed air cleaner 106 is mounted in an<br><br>
intermediate portion of the bleed air supply line 105, so that it is disposed above the secondary air cleaner 79.<br>
The operation of the present embodiment will be described below. The secondary air control valve 48 for controlling the supplying of the exhaust secondary air to the exhaust port 44 in the engine E disposed below the main frame 13 with the cylinder axis CI inclined forwards is disposed the carburetor 38 of the intake device 40 disposed above the engine E and the cell motor 50 mounted to the upper portion of the engine E and between the engine E and the main frame 13.<br>
Therefore, the secondary air control valve 48 can be disposed effectively in a space created between the engine E having the cylinder axis CI inclined forwards and the main ftame 13 and between the carburetor 38 and the cell motor 50, respectively. Moreover, the secondary air control valve 48 is disposed in the vicinity of the engine E and hence, the secondary air supply line 86 connecting the secondary air control valve 48 and the exhaust port 44 in the engine E to each other can be shortened.<br>
The secondary air cleaner 79 connected to the seconaary air control valve 48 at a location upstream of the secon(iary air control valve 48 is disposed on the side opposite from the carburetor 38 with respect to the centerline C2 passing through the widthwise center of the main frame 13, and the carburetor 38 and the secondary air cleaner 79 can be disposed effectively in the narrow space between the engine E and the main frame 13,<br><br>
so that they are disposed at locations displaced In a wldthwise direction of the vehicle body frame assembly F.<br>
Further, since most of the secondary air supply line 86 is disposed on the side opposite from the carburetor 38 with respect to the centerline C2 passing through the wldthwise center of the main frame 13, the carburetor 38 and the secondary air supply line 86 can be disposed compactly at locations closer to the main frame 13.<br>
Yet further, the fuel cocJc 90 of the negative pressure operated type Incorporated in an intermediate portion of the fuel supply line 88 for supplying fuel to the carburetor 48 is disposed sideways of the secondary air control valve 48 below the main frame 13 and disposed sideways of the secondary air control valve 48 disposed between the carburetor 38 and the cell motor 50. Therefore, the fuel cock 90 can be disposed in proximity to the carburetor 38, and the negative pressure take-off line 100 for conducting the negative pressure from the intake device 40 to the fuel cock 90 can be shortened.<br>
Since the fuel cock 90 is disposed on the side opposite from the carburetor 38 with respect to the main frame 13, it is possible to facilitate the arrangement of the fuel supply line 88 and the negative pressure take-off line 100.<br>
Moreover, since the fuel cock 90 is incorporated in an intermediate portion of the fuel supply line 88 extending forwards and downwards from the fuel tank 25 and connected to the carburetor 38, even If the air enters the line section 88b<br><br>
of the fuel supply line 88 connecting the carburetor 38 and the fuel cock 90 to each other with the stoppage of the supplying of the fuel from the fuel tank 25, the fuel can be filled quickly into the line section 88b during subsequent supplying of the fuel, even if an operation for withdrawing the air from the line section 88b is omitted. Thus, it is possible to quickly supply the fuel to the carburetor 38, while eliminating the need for a part such as a relief valve for withdrawing the air to enable a reduction in number of parts.<br>
Further, since the fuel cock 90 is mounted to the intake pipe 39 of the intake device 40, the degree of freedom for the disposition of the fuel cock 90 can be increased, as compared with a system in which a fuel cock 90 is mounted to a fuel tank 25.<br>
Although the embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail, it will be understood that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and various modifications in design may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention defined in claims.<br><br><br>
