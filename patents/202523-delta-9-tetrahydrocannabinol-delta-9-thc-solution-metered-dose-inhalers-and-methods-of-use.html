				<td>?9 TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL (  ?9 THC) SOLUTION METERED DOSE INHALERS AND METHODS OF USE<br>
DESCRIPTION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention is generally related to the therapeutic use of A9<br>
Tetrahydrocannabinoi (?9 THC). In particular, the invention provides a metered dose inhaler (MDI) for the aerosol administration of ?9 THC to patients suffering from nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, muscle spasticity, pain, anorexia associated with AIDS wasting syndrome, epilepsy, glaucoma, bronchia] asthma, mood disorders, and the like.<br>
Background Description<br>
"Medical Marijuana" is a timely and controversial subject that is currently receiving widespread public attention. While marijuana is usually thought of as an illegal "recreational" drug, it also has a long history as a medicine. In 1997, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) released a review of the scientific data concerning potential therapeutic uses for marijuana. In that review, the NIH found that marijuana may indeed have beneficial medicinal effects and recommended that researchers develop alternative dosage forms for the drug, such as a "smoke free" inhaled delivery system (I). Table 1 summarizes the findings of several studies (references 2-18) that have documented therapeutically beneficial medicinal uses of the major active component of marijuana. A9 tetrahydrocannabinoi (?9 THC ).<br><br><br>
-2-<br><br><br>
-3-<br><br><br>
1_<br><br><br>
When marijuana is used illegally as a rccreauonai psychoactive drug, the active ingredient ?9 THC is usually delivered to the lungs as an impure non-pharmaceutical aerosol in the form of marijuana smoke. Aerosolized ?9  THC in the inhaled smoke is absorbed within seconds and delivered to the brain efficiently Table 2 and references 19-20 describe the pharmacokinetics of the administration of ?9 THC. As can be seen, inhalation is the preferred route of delivery for ?9 THC. When compared to oral delivery, inhalation provides a more rapid onset of pharmacological action and peak plasma levels The effects achieved via inhalation are comparable to those achieved when the drug is administered intravenously, but inhalation is a much less invasive technique<br>
-5-<br><br><br>
Currently, the sources of  ?9 THC for patients who could benefit from the drug are very limited An oral form of ?9 THC (MARINOL) is marketed as a treatment for nausea and vomiting related to cancer chemotherapy, and as an appetite stimulant in patients suffering from AIDS wasting syndrome. In MARINOL, pharmaceutical grade?9  THC is dissolved in sesame oil, encapsulated in gelatin capsules and delivered orally However, when the drug is taken orally, the absorption is slower and more variable than when inhaled, with an onset of action between 30 minutes and 2 hours (Table 2) Alternatively, some cancer patients do manage to<br>
-6-<br><br>
obtain and smoke marijuana in order to alleviate such conditions as nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy. This is, however, technically illegal and is thus obviously a less than ideal treatment protocol. There is no currently available pharmaceutically acceptable aerosol form of ?9 THC.<br>
It would be advantageous to have available a form of pharmaceutical grade A9 THC that could be administered as an aerosol. This would provide a means for rapid uptake of the drug without resorting to the illegal practice of smoking marijuana. Also, the potential adverse side effects encountered by smoking marijuana would be avoided. Further, an aerosol preparation of pharmaceuticaily pure  ?9THC could be administered in known, controlled dosages.<br>
In 1976. Oisen et al. described a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propelled MDI formulation of  ?9THC (21). However. A" THC is known to deteriorate during storage, and the stability of ?9 THC in this formulation is suspect. In addition, the ethanoi content in this formulation was so high (-23%) as to create an aerosol with droplets too large to be effectiveiy inhaled (22). The   ?9THC CFC formulations were tested for use in treating asthma but were shown to be only moderately effective (23. 24) Moreover. CFC propellants have since been banned so that such a formulation is now useless  It would clearly be advantageous to develop a new aerosol formulation in which the ?9THC is stable, the droplets are of a size that can be effectively inhaled, and which utiiizes a non-CFC propellant.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a stable aerosol-dispensable pharmaceutical composition comprising a non-CFC propellant and a pharmaceutically effective concentration of ?9 THC. More particularly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a stable aerosol-dispensable pharmaceutical composition comprising a hydrofluoroalkane propellant. (for example, HFA 227 or HFA 134a) and ?9 THC. The propellant is present in the range of approximately 78 to 100% by<br>
-7-<br><br>
weight, and more particularly the propellant is present in the range of approximately 85 to 100% by weight. An organic solvent such as ethanol can be used to assist in solubilizing the ?9 THC in the propeilant but is not required. If a solvent is used, preferably less than 20% by weight will be required, and most preferably less than 15% by weight will be required. The pharmaceutically effective concentration of  ?9 THC is preferably in the range of 0.05 to 10% by weight, and most preferably in the range of 0 1 to 6% by weight. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be used to treat a variety of medical conditions including nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, muscle spasticity  pain, anorexia associated with AIDS wasting syndrome, anorexia associated with cancer chemotherapy, epilepsy, glaucoma, bronchial asthma, mood disorders, migraine headaches.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
The instant invention provides a series of non-ozone depleting pressurized metered dose inhaler formulations of ?9THC In preferred embodiments of the invention, the formulations contain the pharmaceutically acceptable, non-ozone depleting hydrofluoroalkane propcllants HFA 134a (1,1,1,2-tetrahydrofluoroethane) and HFA 227 (1,1,1,2,3.3,3-heptafIuoropropane). or a mixture thereof.<br>
When the propeilant is a hydrofluoroalkane it has been discovered that the propeilant may be used with or without a solvent such as ethanol   Higher percentages of solvent generally allow higher levels of dissolution of ?9THC However, higher<br><br>
percentages of solvent also cause droplet size to increase In preferred embodiments of the invention, the range of propellam compositions, as shown in Table 3, may be from 100% propellant and 0% solvent to 85% propellant and 15 % solvent. Within this range of percentages, pharmaceutically useful concentrations of ?9 THC can be achieved and droplet size is still small enough (
Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the  respirable dose" (or mass of  ?9 THC in particles with aerodynamic diameters small enough to be delivered to and absorbed by the lungs) (Figure 1) may be increased by choosing MDI spray nozzles of different design and smaller orifice diameters Respirable doses may also be increased by extending the mouthpiece of the MDI in such a way as to create an integral or separate aerosol spacer or reservoir attached to the mouthpiece of the MDI. This promotes an increase in droplet evaporation and hence in the percentage of the dose in smaller "respirable" particles or droplets Generally, the optimal size of a respirable droplet is less than 10?m in size<br>

A distinct advantage of the present formuiations is that, surprisingly, the use of surface active agents or 'surfactants" as valve lubricants and solubilizers is not necessary. This is in contrast to the invention of Purewal and Greenleaf (European Patent 0,372.777. reference #25) which provides HFA 134a/ethanol mixtures to produce stable formulations of Pharmaceuticals in the presence of hpophilic surface active agents Lipophilic surface active agents are incorporated in that invention in order to suspend undissolved material and to ensure adequate valve lubrication of the MDI Without adequate valve lubrication, the useful life of the MDI and its ability to deliver an accurate dose of drug are severely attenuated However, probably due to the inherent lubricity of the formulations of the present invention, the use of such surface active agents is unnecessary This simplifies the composition and thus is an advantage with respect to cost and the elimination of potentially deleterious interactions between components of the formulations and the agents.<br>
A major consideration in the formulation of any drug is its stability. ?9  THC :s known to deteriorate upon storage so that the effective concentration decreases and the purity is vitiated. The stability of the formuiations of the present invention were tested according to accelerated storage testing protocols The results are given in Figure 1 and Tables 4A and 4B The formuiations of the present invention were shown to be stable with respect to the release of aerosolized  ?9 THC in reproducible doses following accelerated storage testing Apparently, the containment of ?9 THC in solution in the non-aqueous formulations of the present invention is excellent with respect to chemical degradation, making possible the construction of a multidose inhaler with a good shelf life prognosis.<br>
Further, hpophilic materials like ?9 THC are generally known to partition into the elastomers of the valves in MDI formulations. (?9THC is highly hpophilic as reflected in its octanolwater partition coefficient of 6000 1) Over time, this partitioning results in a decrease in the emitted or delivered dose of a hpophilic drug Thus, this phemonemon also decreases the useful shelf-life of such preparations. However, the data presented in Figure 1 and Table 4 show that this is not the case<br>
-11-<br><br>
-12-<br>
with the formulations of the present invention. The emitted or delivered doses were constant over the time period tested. This may be due to the somewhat surprising preference of   ?9THC for the formulation itself, rather than for the valve elastomers TABLE 4A.

The final concentration of ?9 THC in a given formulation may be varied by adjusting the ratio of propellant to solvent and thus the solubility of the ?9 THC Higher percentages of solvent (e g ethanol) generally allow a higher amount of THC to be dissolved. For example, in preferred embodiments of the invention, the apparent solubility of ?9 THC ranged from 0.147% w/w to 5.94% w/was the propellant composition varied from 100% HFA 227 to 85% HFA 227 and 15% ethanol Thus, the dose of ?9 THC in a given metered volume may be selected by changing the formulation<br>
Further, as stated above, the "fine particle dose" or "lespirable dose' of a drug dispensed with an MDI is a function of the spray nozzle diameter. In Figure I and Tables 4A and 4B, the spray nozzle diameter is 0 4mm. The "fine particle dose'1 or "respirable dose" of the formulations of the present invention was shown to be<br>
-14-<br><br>
unaffected by storage<br>
The ?9 THC of the present invention is pharmaceutically pure. That  is its form is the nonionized resinous drug substance (6aR.-trans)-6a.7,S,10a-tetrahydro-6.6.9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6H-dibenzo[b,d]-pyran-l-ol Although its preferred embodiment in this invention is not a salt or ester, it will be readily understood by those of skill in the art that other appropriate forms of  ?9 THC may be synthesized (e g. esters and salts) and thus used in the practice of this invention<br>
The desired final concentration of  ?9 THC in a patient's serum will vary from patient to patient depending on, for example, the nature and seventy of the condition being treated, and the patient's overall condition, weight, gender and response to the drug, etc But the desired range will generally be 10-100ng/ml at 15 minutes following inhalation. The level of   ?9THC in a patient's serum can be readily and reliably monitored by gas chromatography/mass spectrophotometry (GC/MS).<br>
The exact treatment protocol to be used may vary from patient to patient depending on the circumstances. For example  in a preferred embodiment of the invention, a patient receiving chemotherapy may have one dose of  ?9 THC prescribed via inhalation, to be administered 15 minutes before chemotherapy and 4-8 times daily following chemotherapy   In another preferred embodiment, a patient suffering from anorexia associated with AIDS wasting syndrome may have  ?9 THC by inhalation prescribed 3-5 times daily. 30 minutes before each meal or snack In other preferred embodiments, a patient suffering form cancer pain, or spasticity related to either multiple sclerosis or sptnal cord injury may have  ?9 THC by inhalation prescribed 3-6 times daily. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the treatment protocol may be crafted so as to address the particular needs of each individual patient on a case by case basis.<br>
?9 THC may be used alone or in combination with other medications. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that, for example, in the case of AIDS wasting syndrome, the patient will likely also be taking drugs that combat the AiDS virus Similarly, those skilled in the an will readily recognize that patients receiving<br>
-15-<br><br>
chemotherapy for cancer may also receive other antiemetics and cancer patients seeking to relieve pain are likely to receive optoids as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.<br>
The containers lor the formulations of the instant invention may be any that are suitable for the efficacious delivery of aerosol inhalants. Several containers and their method of usage are known to those of skill in the an. For example. MDIs can be used with various dose metering chambers, various plastic actuators and mouthpieces, and various aerosol holding chambers (e g spacer and reservoir devices), so that appropriate doses of  ?9THC reach and deposit in the lung and are thereafter absorbed into the bloodstream. In addition, a lock mechanism such as that shown in U.S. Patent 5.284.133  to Bums and Marshak. which is herein incorporated by reference, can be used to prevent overdose or unauthorized consumption of  ?9 THC  Figure 2 provides a generalized drawing of an MDI containing the composition of this invention and provides the advantage of delivering metered quantities of ?9THC on a repetitive basis The MDI includes a container 100 for holding the composition and a valve delivery mechanism 102 for delivery of aerosolized ?9 THC.<br>
While the invention has been described tn terms of its preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims<br>
