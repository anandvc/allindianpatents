The present invention relates to an improved phannaceutical composition. The present invention particularly relates to an improved pharmaceutical composition, in the form of a soft gel capsule resistant to digestive juice. The composition of the present invention is made up of gelatin and an enteric polymer in the form of free acid or its salt, containing a benzimidazole derivative used in the treatment of duodenal ulcers, solubilised and/or suspended in a liquid or semisolid medium, comprising of a hydrophobic carrier, an alkaline inert reacting material and a surface active agent and/or a solubilising agent. The present invention also relation to a method for preparing the above said pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Benzimidazole derivatives such as Omeprazole, Lansoprazole Timoprazole and Pantoprazole etc., are known potent proton pump inhibitors with powerful inhibitory action against the secretion of gastric juice (Lancet, Nov. 27, 1982 pages 1223-1224). They are used in the treatment of Zollinzer - Elision syndrome and stress related esophagitis ulceration. The derivatives are well [mown and are described, for example in EP-A 0005129.<br>
[t has been found that these benzimidazole derivatives, and in particular comeprazole, are susceptible to degradation in acid and neutral media. It is known o protect oral dosage forms of such benzimidazole derivatives by providing an enteric coating. In this way, the active material is protected from acidic gastric uices until it reaches the desired site of release, e.g. the small intestine. Because certain enteric coatings can themselves be, or contain, acidic material, it is also often required to protect the benzimidazole derivatives from the acidity of the enteric coating. For example, it is known to formulate the benzimidazole ierivatives with an alkaline material before applying the enteric coating. It is also mown to provide an intermediate coating between the benzimidazole derivative and the enteric coating. Generally the intermediate coating is selected so as to be substantially water-soluble or water-dispersible.<br>
EP-A-024 7983- US 4,786,505; US 4,853,230 and US 5,385,739 describe oral phannaceutical preparations containing benzimidazole derivatives that are potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion, which are composed of a core material in the form of small beads or tablets contaming one of the benzimidazole derivatives, particularly omeprazole, together with an alkaline reacting compound. The core material contains one or more inert reacting sub-coating layers thereon thereby providing a final outer enteric coating. Although the above-described compositions are reasonably stable over an extended period of storage, discoloration of the pellets and / or tablets with reduced gastric resistance and reduction of dissolution rate in alkaline buffers was observed.<br><br>
More over the processes disclosed above are time consuming and laborious, involving many stages in manufacturing of the composition, consequently increasing the cost of the final composition.<br>
In a Gennan patent DE 32 22 476 a pharmaceutical composition has been described in which a soft gelatin capsule that is resistant to digestive juice, whose wall consists of a usual gelatin mass which contain polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate or a vinyl acetate / crotonic acid copolymer and/or an alkah metal salt, ammonia salt or amino salt of the same in their wall, which released their contents readily in the intestines within the prescribed time. The capsules are further treated on the surface with an aldehyde-coating agent.<br>
The capsule shell composition described in DE 32 22 476 above, if used as such for manufacturing capsules containing one of the benzimidazole derivatives in a conventional manner, the free acidic groups of the polymer in the shell composition reacts with the benzimidazole derivatives and reduces the efficacy of the product during its storage / shelf hfe period.<br>
The present invention takes as basis, the production of soft gelatin capsules in the conventional manner using gelatin mass in the known composition and to additionally incorporate substances into the gelatin shell which are insoluble up to a pH value of 5.5 in aqueous media, but quickly dissolve above pH value of 6.0<br>
Considering the importance gained for the composition containing benzimidazole derivatives, particularly for the treatment of duodenal ulcers, there is a need for the development of pharmaceutical composition containing said derivatives having stability for an extended period during which period the composition does not get discoloured.<br>
Accordingly, the main objective of the present invention is to provide an   i improved pharmaceutical  composition  containing Benzimidazole  derivatives having enhanced stability during storage. _<br>
According to another objective of the present invention there is provided intestine dissoluble soft gel capsules composition consisting of gelatin and an enteric polymer in the form of a free acid or its salt characterised by the fact that the pharmaceutical composition consisting of benzimidazole derivatives, m particular omeprazole, mcorporated in an oily base which is stable during shelf storage..<br><br>
Still another objective of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition<br>
for carrying the benzimidazole derivatives, to be filled into the soft gel capsules,<br>
that reduces degradation of the benzimidazole derivatives during storage / shelf<br>
life.	<br>
According to another feature of the invention there is provided a process for preparation of soft gel capsules containing benzimidazole derivatives that are resistant to the digestive / gastric juice comprising of a usual gelatin mass and an enteric polymer in the form of a free acid or as its salt.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved pharmaceutical composition in the form of a soft gel capsule resistant to gastric juice and soluble in intestine useful for the treatment of duodenal ulcers and related ailments which comprises of a gelatin shell resistant to gastric juice and soluble in intestine having an enteric polymer in the form of free acid or its salt, the capsule incorporating a composition comprising of a benzunidazole derivative, a hydrophobic oily substance or a mixture of such substances, an alkaline inert reacting material, a surface active agent and / or a solublising agent. The capsules are insoluble in aqueous medium up to a pH of 5.5 but quickly dissolve above pHof6.0.<br>
According to another feature of the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition in the form of a soft gel capsule resistant to gastric juice and soluble in intestine usefiil for the treatment of duodenal ulcers and related ailments which comprises forming a gelatin shell resistant to gastric juice and soluble in intestine having an enteric polymer in the form of free acid or its salt by conventional methods, incorporating into the resultant capsule a composition comprising of a Benzimidazole derivative, a hydrophobic oily substance or a mixture of such substances, an alkaline inert reacting material, a surface active agent and / or a solublising agent. The capsules are insoluble in aqueous medium up to a pH of 5.5 but quickly dissolve above pHof6.0.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the enteric polymer used in the soft gel capsule composition may be selected from among the polymers but not limited to free acid forms of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate, alkyhnethacrylale and methacrylic acid ester copolymers, polyvinylacetate phftialate and the like or their ammonia or alkali metal salts. The amount of such enteric polymer employed may range from 5.0-40.0 percent, preferably 5.0 -25.0 percent by weight with reference to the dried shell.<br><br>
The gelatin mass into which the enteric polymer is incorporated is made up of a composition known in the art and contains gelatin, a plasticizer, preservatives, colourants, opacifiers, flavours etc., as required.<br>
In order to canyout fester dissolution of the enteric polymer for preparing the capsule shell composition, the polymer is first dispersed in water, then aqueous solution of ammonia or alkali metal salt is mixed while stirring. When alkali metal salt is used it may be selected from substances such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, carbonate of hydrogen sodium, carbonate of hydrogen potassium, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate etc. The quantity of the base materials used is such that it is sufficient to neutralise 60 to 100 percent of the free acid groups present in the selected enteric polymer.<br>
The excess ammonia or alkali has to be removed from the capsule shell composition to avoid decomposition of the ester couphngs in enteric polymers. When aqueous ammonia solution is used to prepare polymer solution, the excess ammonia has to be removed before preparing the capsule after mixing with the gelatin mass, by mixing the mass under reduced pressure in warm condition.<br>
When alkali metal salts are used, the excess alkah is to be neutralized by treating the capsules with an acid selected from any of the following ones, hydrochloric acid, sulphric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, mono carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, benzoic acid etc., dicarboxylic acids such as oxalic acid, maleic acid, fumiaric acid etc. The acids are used in the form of cold aqueous solutions in the concentration range of 3 to 30% depending on the type of acid used. The acid treatment may be carried out after manufecturing and partial drying of the capsules to avoid deformation and / or leakage of the capsule contents.<br>
According to another feature of the invention the soft gel capsules are optionally treated with a cross-linking agent that reacts with gelatin and makes it insoluble in gastric juice. The cross-linking agent may be selected from among the aldehydes such as formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, crotonaldehyde 1,2-phthalic acid aldehyde, 1,3-phthahc acid aldehyde, 1,4-phthahc acid aldehyde or carbodiimides like 1 -ethyI-3-[2-morphohnyl-(4)-ethyl]-carbodiiniide-metho-p-toluene-sulfonate. The freatment may be done by either coating 0.05 to 1.0% w/v of the substance in an alcohol containing aqueous solution on to the soft gel capsule surface or mixing these substances in the gelatin mass before capsule manufecturing.<br><br>
According to another feature of the invention the phannaceutical composition containing benzimidazole derivative, known for its potent proton pump inhibition with powerful inhibitory action against the secretion of gastric juice, is prepared by suspending and/or solubilising the benzimidazole derivative in a carrier mixture composed of a hydrophobic oily carrier material, an alkaline inert reacting material and a surface active agent. The amount of such benzimidazole derivative used is equivalent to one unit dose recommended depending on the benzimidazole derivative incorporated i.e. for omeprazole the amount incorporated into enteric soft gel capsule may range fi-om 10.0 to 60.0mg per capsule preferably 20.0 to 40.0 mg per capsule.<br>
The hydrophobic oily material may be selected fi-om among the following fats and oils: Fats and oils of vegetable origin such as sesame oil, com, maize oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, arachis oil, gingly oil etc.; animal oils such as fish oil, pig oil beef oil etc.; esters of straight chained aliphatic oils contained in glycerol such as SunSoft 700 P-2 (a monoester substance manufactured by Taiho Chemicals Company) Panasete 810 ( a triester substance, manufactured by Nippon Oils and Fats); hydrogenated vegetable oils or a mixture thereof The amount of such hydrophobic oily material may range from 50.0 to 80.0 percent by weigh with reference to the contents filled in capsule.<br>
The alkaline buffering material present in the phannaceutical composition may be selected from among but are not restricted to substances such as the sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminumi salts of phosphoric acid, carbonic acid, citric acid, other suitable organic or inorganic acids; substances used in antacid preparations; meglumine; triethanolamine etc. The amount of such alkaline buffering material present in the composition may range from 5.0 to 40.0 percent, preferably 10.0 to 25.0 percent by weight with reference to the contents filled in capsule.<br>
The surfece active agent used a&amp; solubiUsing and / or dispersing ^ents is selected from among but are not restricted to substances such as glyceryl monostearate, polyoxyethylene castor oil derivatives such as Cremophor RH 40, Cremophor EL (Make : BASF Corporation), lecithin, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, sodium lauryl sulphate, doccusate sodium etc. The amount of such surface active agent present in the composition may range from 2.0 to 20.0 percent preferably 5.0 to 15.0 percent by weight with reference to contents filled in capsule.<br>
