				<td>VALVE WITH METAL SEAL BETWEEN THE<br>
COUPLED PARTS OF ITS BODY<br>
This invention is directed to a valve with metal seal between the coupled<br>
parts of its body. This invention concerns valves with a body consisting<br>
of at least two metal parts, coupled together as in a ball valve that<br>
contains a rotating ball shutter and a valve gland screwed onto the body.<br>
In these valves, the hermetic seal between the coupled parts of the body<br>
is usually made by interposing gaskets in elastomeric material, which,<br>
anyway, represent additional elements that are added at the moment of<br>
assembling the valve, and which do not preclude problems of efficiency,<br>
maintenance, etc.<br>
The aim of this invention is to propose valves, in particular ball valves,<br>
with a metal seal between the two connected parts of their body and with<br>
the advantages of eliminating the usual added gaskets, of simplifying the<br>
assembly of the valves and ensuring an effective seal that<br><br>
lasts, under all conditions of use and with any fluid, whether<br>
liquid or gas. In other terms, the seal between the coupled<br>
metal parts is obtained by using portions of the same<br>
material with which those parts are made, and integral with<br>
them.<br>
Correspondingly, a valve according to the invention<br>
consists of a body composed of at least two metal parts that<br>
screw together and where, on the circular surfaces of said<br>
two parts designed to match when assembled, there are<br>
circular coupling sections that fit tightly together, fastening<br>
together and jointly giving a metal seal.<br>
The circular coupling parts may take various geometrical<br>
shapes and may, anyway, be made by working the<br>
corresponding interlocking surfaces.<br>
Several examples of models of a metal seal for the valve<br>
body are shown in the drawings enclosed, by way of<br>
example, and these will be described in greater detail below.<br>
In these drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows, in cross-section, the two separated parts of<br>
a valve body and in (A) and (B) the enlarged views of the<br>
parts designed to fit together to give a hermetic seal,<br>
according to a first version of the invention;<br>
Fig. 2 shows the assembled body valve and in (C) and (D)<br>
two enlarged areas seen before and after the two parts of the<br>
body valve have been fastened together;<br><br>
Figs 3, (A) and (B), show similar views to those of Figs<br>
1,	(A) and (B), but with a second version of the sealing<br>
parts;<br>
Figs 4, (C) and (D), show views similar to those of Figs<br>
2,	(C) and (D), with the presence of sealing parts like those<br>
of Figs 3, (A) and (B); and<br>
Figs 5 and 6, (A), (B), (C), (D); 7 and 8, (A), (B), (C),<br>
(D); 9 and 10, (A), (B), (C), (D); 11 and 12, (A), (B), (C),<br>
(D) show, respectively, similar views to those in Figs 1 and<br>
2, (A), (B), (C), (D) but with further versions of the sealing<br>
parts.<br>
A valve body 10 for a ball valve as illustrated in the<br>
drawings consists of a real and proper body 11, designed to<br>
contain a rotating ball shutter, not shown, with relative<br>
gaskets and an element called a valve gland 12 which is<br>
screwed co-axially onto the body 11. The body 11 and the<br>
valve gland 12 have circular surfaces 13 and 14 which are<br>
designed to fit when they are tightly screwed together. At<br>
the height of said surfaces, there are one or more circular<br>
coupling parts 15 and 16, respectively, which match to give<br>
a metal seal between the body and the valve gland, once<br>
they are assembled.<br>
In the version shown in Figs 1 and 2, the matching<br>
circular surfaces 13, 14 are defined by opposing shoulders<br>
which come to rest against each other in an axial direction<br><br>
once the elements 11, 12 have been screwed together. The<br>
circular coupling parts for the metal seal consist of a throat<br>
15 with converging sides made in one (13) of said circular<br>
surfaces and of a collar or prismatic circular projection 16<br>
made on the other surface (14) and designed to catch in the<br>
throat 15.<br>
Likewise, in the version shown in Figs 3 and 4, the<br>
matching circular surfaces 13, 14 are defined by opposing<br>
shoulders, while the circular coupling parts for the metal<br>
seal consist of an inclined circular plane 15, made on one<br>
(13) of said surfaces and of a circular edge 16 made on the<br>
opposite surface (14) and designed to fit with the said<br>
inclined plane.<br>
Similarly, in the version shown in Figs 5 and 6, the<br>
matching circular surfaces 13, 14 are defined by opposing<br>
shoulders on the elements 11, 12, respectively, while the<br>
circular coupling parts for the metal seal are represented by<br>
a circular chamfer 15 made on one (13) of said surfaces and<br>
by a circular step 16 made on the opposite surface (14) and<br>
interacting and fastening by means of an edge against said<br>
chamfer 15.<br>
In the version shown in Figs 7 and 8, the matching<br>
circular surfaces 13, 14 of elements 11, 12 are also defined<br>
by opposing shoulders, while the circular coupling parts for<br>
the metal seal consist of a circular cuneiform projection 15<br><br>
made on one (13) of said surfaces and of a circular throat 16<br>
made in the opposite surface (14) in such a way that the<br>
cuneiform projection 15 rests against and holds, with its<br>
point, the bottom of said throat 16.<br>
In the example shown in Figs 9 and 10, the matching<br>
circular surfaces 13, 14 are foreseen, respectively, inside the<br>
body 11 at the end of the coupling thread and at the end of<br>
the valve gland 12 that screws onto the body. In this case,<br>
the circular coupling parts for the metal seal consist of a<br>
circular step 15 made on one (13) of said surfaces and of a<br>
chamfer 16 on the opposite surface 14, in such a way as to<br>
interlock when the body and the valve gland are assembled.<br>
Likewise, in the example shown in Figs 11 and 12 the<br>
matching circular surfaces 13,14 are inside the body 11 and<br>
at the end of the valve gland, respectively. The circular<br>
coupling parts are constituted here by an internal collar 15<br>
made on the surface 13 and by a collar and circular<br>
boundary projection 16 on the surface 14, in such a way that<br>
said projection interacts with the collar 15 when the two<br>
components 11 and 12 are assembled.<br>
Clearly, other shapes can be chosen and adopted for the<br>
coupling parts in the metal seal between the components of<br>
the valve body while still adhering to the aim of the present<br>
invention, namely, getting two complementary metal parts<br>
to interlock tightly when said parts are assembled.<br><br>
