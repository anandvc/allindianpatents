DESCRIPTION<br>
ALL-ION ACCELERATOR AND CONTROL METHOD OF THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an accelerator for<br>
accelerating ions, and more particularly to an<br>
accelerator including an induction synchrotron capable of<br>
accelerating all ions and a control method thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
An ion refers to an element in the periodic table in<br>
a certain charge state. All ions refer to all elements<br>
in the periodic table in all charge states that the<br>
elements can take in principle. Further, the ions<br>
include particles consisting of a large number of<br>
molecules such as compounds or protein.<br>
An accelerator is a device for accelerating charged<br>
particles such as ele, protons and ions to a high-<br>
energy state on the order of several million electron<br>
volts (several MeV) to several trillion electron volts<br>
(several TeV), and is broadly classified into radio<br>
frequency accelerators and induction accelerators,<br>
according to acceleration principles. In addition, an<br>
accelerator is classified into linear accelerators and<br>
circular accelerators according to their geometrical<br>
shapes.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
The radio frequency circular accelerator is<br>
classified into a cyclotron and an rf synchrotron<br>
according to acceleration methods. There are radio<br>
frequency accelerators of various size according to use;<br>
large-sized accelerators for research in nuclear and<br>
particle physics that enable obtainment of extremely high<br>
energy, and recent small-sized rf synchrotrons for cancer<br>
therapy that provide ion beams of a relatively low energy<br>
level.<br>
In the radio frequency accelerator, an rf cavity has<br>
been used for accelerating charged particles. The rf<br>
cavity produces an rf electric field of several MHz to<br>
several tens of MHz in synchronization with traveling of<br>
the charged particles by resonant excitation of the rf<br>
cavity. Energy from the rf electric field is transferred<br>
to the charged particles. A resonance frequency is<br>
changed within the range described above, because a<br>
revolution frequency at which the charged particle<br>
circulates around a design orbit increasing with the<br>
energy change of the charged particle.<br>
Figure 10 shows a conventional rf synchrotron<br>
complex 34. An rf synchrotron 35 has been particularly<br>
an essential tool for experiments in nuclear and high<br>
energy physics. The rf synchrotron 35 is an accelerator<br>
for increasing the energy of charged particles to a<br>
predetermined level by the principles of resonance<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
acceleration, strong focusing, and phase stability, and<br>
has a configuration described below.<br>
The conventional rf synchrotron complex 34 includes<br>
an injection device 15 that accelerates ions generated by<br>
an ion source 16 to several percent or several ten<br>
percent of the speed of light with an rf linear<br>
accelerator 17b, and injects the ions from the rf linear<br>
accelerator 17b into the subsequent rf synchrotron 35<br>
using an injector 18 constituted by injection devices<br>
such as a septum magnet, a kicker magnet, a bump magnet,<br>
or the like, the rf synchrotron 35 that accelerates an<br>
ion beam 3 to a predetermined energy level, and an<br>
extraction device 19 including an extraction system 20<br>
constituted by various magnets that extracts the ion beam<br>
3 accelerated up to the predetermined energy level from<br>
the accelerator ring to an ion beam utility line 21 that<br>
is a facility 21a in which experimental devices 21b or<br>
the like are placed. The devices are connected by<br>
transporting vacuum pipes 16a, 17a and 20a.<br>
The rf synchrotron 35 includes an annular vacuum<br>
duct 4 maintained in a high vacuum state, a bending<br>
electromagnet 5 that keeps an ion beam 3 along a design<br>
orbit, a focusing electromagnet 6 such as a quadrupole<br>
electromagnet placed to ensure strong focusing of the ion<br>
beam 3 in the vacuum duct 4 both horizontally and<br>
vertically, a radio frequency accelerating device 36<br>
constituted by an rf cavity 36a that applies an rf<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
acceleration voltage to the ion beam 3 in the vacuum duct<br>
4 and accelerates the ion beam 3, and a control device<br>
36b that controls the amplitude and phase of applied<br>
radio frequency waves, position monitors 35a periodically<br>
placed along the entire circumference for measuring the<br>
position of the ion beam 3 in the vacuum duct 4, a<br>
steering electromagnet 35b for modifying the orbit of the<br>
ion beam 3 (referred to as Closed Orbit Distortion) using<br>
position information of the ion beam 3 obtained by the<br>
position monitors 35a, a bunch monitor 7 that detects<br>
passage of the ion beam 3, or the like.<br>
In the rf synchrotron complex 34 having the above<br>
described configuration, the ion beam 3 accelerated up to<br>
a certain energy level by the rf linear accelerator 17b<br>
and injected into the rf synchrotron circulates along the<br>
design orbit in the vacuum duct 4 in an advancing axis<br>
direction. If the rf voltage is applied to the rf cavity<br>
36a at this time, the ion beam 3 forms a group of charged<br>
particles (hereinafter referred to as a bunch) around a<br>
certain phase of the rf voltage (called as acceleration<br>
phase) by a focusing force in the propagating direction<br>
of ions.<br>
Then, the frequency of the rf voltage applied to the<br>
rf cavity 36a is increased in synchronization with an<br>
excitation pattern of the bending electromagnet 5 that<br>
holds the design orbit of the ion beam 3. Also, the<br>
phase of the rf voltage at the bunch center is shifted<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
toward an acceleration phase to increase the momentum of<br>
the circulating ion beam 3. The frequency of radio<br>
frequency waves must be an integral multiple of the<br>
revolution frequency of the ion.<br>
It is known that the relationship of p = eBp is<br>
satisfied, where e is a charge of each particle in the<br>
ion beam 3, p is its momentum, B is a magnetic flux<br>
density of the guiding magnet, and p is a radius of<br>
curvature by bending in a magnetic field. Also, magnetic<br>
field strength of the quadrupole electromagnet, for<br>
focusing the ion beam 3 horizontally and vertically is<br>
increased in synchronization with the increase in<br>
momentum of the ion beam 3. Thus, the ion beam 3<br>
circulating in the vacuum duct 4 is always positioned on<br>
a predetermined fixed orbit. This orbit is referred to<br>
as a design orbit.<br>
For synchronization between the rate of increase in<br>
momentum of the ion beam 3 and the rate of change in<br>
magnetic field strength, a method can be used for<br>
measuring the magnetic field strength of the bending<br>
electromagnet 5 with a magnetic field measuring search<br>
coil, generating a discrete control clock (B clock) every<br>
change in the magnetic field strength, and determining<br>
the frequency of the radio frequency waves based on the B<br>
clock.<br>
Without the complete synchronization between the<br>
change in magnetic field strength of the bending<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
electromagnet 5 and the change in radio frequency, a<br>
revolution orbit radius of the ion beam 3 would decrease<br>
or increase, displacing the ion beam 3 from the design<br>
orbit to eventually collide with the vacuum duct 4 or the<br>
like and be lost. Generally, the accelerator is not<br>
perfect. In most cases, there should be perturbations to<br>
deform the circulating orbit from the design orbit, such<br>
as errors rf voltage amplitude. Thus, the system is<br>
configured so that a displacement of the ion beam 3 from<br>
the design orbit is measured by the position monitor 8<br>
for detecting a momentum shift, the phase of the rf<br>
voltage required for the ion beam 3 to circulate along<br>
the design orbit is calculated, and a feedback is applied<br>
so that the rf acceleration voltage is applied to the<br>
bunch center at a proper phase.<br>
By the rf acceleration voltage, individual ions<br>
receive focusing forces in the propagating direction of<br>
ions and are formed into a bunch, and circulate in the rf<br>
synchrotron 35 while moving forward and backward in the<br>
propagating direction of the ion beam 3. This is<br>
referred to as the phase stability of the rf synchrotron<br>
35.<br>
Figure 11 shows confinement and acceleration<br>
principles (phase stability) of the bunch by the radio<br>
frequency waves in the conventional rf synchrotron 35.<br>
In the confinement method in the advancing axis<br>
direction and the acceleration method of the charged<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
particles in the rf synchrotron 35, it is known that a<br>
phase space area in which the bunch 3a can be confined is<br>
restricted in principle particularly in the advancing<br>
axis direction (time axis direction). Specifically, in a<br>
time area where the radio frequency waves 37 are at a<br>
negative voltage, the bunch 3a is reduced in energy, and<br>
in a time area with a different polarity of a voltage<br>
gradient, the charged particles diffuse in the advancing<br>
axis direction and not confined. In other words, only a<br>
time period of the acceleration voltage 37a shown between<br>
the dotted lines can be used for accelerating the ion<br>
beam 3.<br>
In the time period of the acceleration voltage 37a,<br>
the radio frequency waves 37 are controlled to apply an<br>
desired constant acceleration voltage 37b to a bunch<br>
center 3b. Thus, the particles positioned in a bunch<br>
head 3c have higher energy and arrive earlier at the rf<br>
cavity 36a than the bunch center 3b does, and thus<br>
receive a lower acceleration voltage 37c than the<br>
acceleration voltage 37b received in the bunch center 3b<br>
and relatively reduce their velocity. On the other hand,<br>
the particles positioned in the bunch tail 3d have lower<br>
energy and arrive later at the rf cavity 36 than the<br>
bunch center 3b does, and thus "receive larger<br>
acceleration voltage 37d than the bunch center 3b does<br>
and relatively increase their velocity. During the<br>
acceleration, the particles repeat this process, changing<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
their sitting positions in the bunch head, center, and<br>
tail.<br>
A maximum value of an ion beam current that can be<br>
accelerated is determined by the size of space-charge<br>
forces that is a diffusion force caused by an electric<br>
field in the direction perpendicular to the advancing<br>
axis of the beam, produced by the ion beam 3 itself. The<br>
charged particles in the accelerator receive a force by<br>
the focusing magnets and perform motions similar to a<br>
harmonic oscillator called betatron oscillation. When<br>
the ion beam current exceeds a certain level, the<br>
amplitude of the betatron oscillation of the charged<br>
particles reaches the size of the vacuum duct 4 and the<br>
ion beam is lost. This is referred to as the space-<br>
charge limitation.<br>
To be exact, the limitation is made by a maximum<br>
value of a local beam current value, that is, a line<br>
current density. In the rf synchrotron 35, the bunch<br>
center 3b usually has maximum line density, inevitably<br>
causing an imbalance in current density between the bunch<br>
center 3b and bunch outer edges such as the bunch head 3c<br>
and the bunch tail 3d without any particular improvement.<br>
Thus, the current density in the bunch center 3b has to<br>
be lower than the limitation. This means that the current<br>
density in an rf synchrotron is determined by the charge<br>
density in the bunch centre.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
Specifically, a resonance frequency frf of the rf<br>
cavity 36a is written by frf = 1/4 (L-C) using electric<br>
parameters (inductance L and capacity C) of the rf cavity<br>
36a. The inductance is descrived by L=l- (Uofi*/2rc) log<br>
(b/a) using the geometrical parameters (length 1, inner<br>
diameter a, outer diameter b} and material<br>
characteristics (relative permeability p.*) of a magnetic<br>
material loaded in the rf cavity 36a.<br>
A revolution frequency fo of the particle and the<br>
resonance frequency frf of the rf cavity 36a have to<br>
always maintain the relationship of frf = hfo (h: integer)<br>
so as to maintain the synchronization with revolution of<br>
particles. This is achieved by exciting the magnetic<br>
material with an additional current referred to as a bias<br>
current and changing an operation point on a B-H curve,<br>
and controlling the relative permeability u.*.<br>
Ferrite is generally used as a magnetic material of<br>
the rf cavity 36a. Its maximum inductance is obtained<br>
when the bias current is around 0 A, and a resonance<br>
frequency determined at the operation point is minimum.<br>
In the rf synchrotron 35 designed and constructed<br>
exclusively for protons or particular ions, species and<br>
charge state can be selected only within a range allowed<br>
by a finite variable width of frequency of the rf cavity<br>
36a itself and a radio frequency power amplifier, such as<br>
a triode or tetrode, drives the rf cavity.<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
Thus, in the conventional rf synchrotron 35, once<br>
the ion species to be accelerated, an acceleration energy<br>
level, and an accelerator peripheral length are<br>
determined, a frequency bandwidth of the radio frequency<br>
waves 37 is uniquely determined.<br>
Figure 12 shows the revolution frequency in the rf<br>
synchrotron 35 from injection and to end of acceleration<br>
for acceleration of various ions with the KEK 500 MeV<br>
booster proton synchrotron (hereinafter referred to as<br>
KEK 500MeVPS) by High energy accelerator research<br>
organization (hereinafter referred to as KEK). The axis<br>
of ordinate represents the revolution frequency (MHz),<br>
and the axis of abscissa represents the acceleration time<br>
(msec). The KEK 500MeVPS is an rf synchrotron 35 for<br>
protons having a peripheral length of about 35 m.<br>
H (1, 1), U (238, 39) and U (283, 5) represent a<br>
proton, a uranium ion (+39), and a uranium ion (+5),<br>
respectively, and changes in acceleration frequency<br>
thereof are shown in the figure.<br>
The results in Figure 12 show that, in the rf<br>
synchrotron 35 designed for accelerating protons or light<br>
ions, heavy ions such as uranium ions cannot be<br>
accelerated from a low energy level of an extremely low<br>
revolution frequency up to a high energy level. The<br>
revolution frequency of ions heavier than protons and<br>
lighter than uranium ions (+5) places within a range<br>
shown by the double-headed vertical broken arrow.<br><br>
-11-<br>
On the other hand, cyclotrons have been<br>
conventionally used as accelerators for accelerating<br>
various ions. Like the rf synchrotron 35, the cyclotron<br>
also uses an rf cavity 36a as an accelerating device of<br>
an ion beam 3. Thus, from the principle limitation xv.<br>
use of radio frequency waves 37, the cyclotron is used<br>
only for ions with the same Z/A, where A is the mass<br>
number and Z is the charge state of an ion that can be<br>
accelerated.<br>
Further, the revolution orbit of the ion beam 3 is<br>
held in a uniform magnetic field from a central portion<br>
with the ion source 16 to an outermost portion that an<br>
extraction orbit is located, and a necessary magnetic<br>
field is produced by a bipolar magnet with iron as a<br>
magnetic material. However, such a magnet is limited in<br>
physical size.<br>
Thus, the maximum value of acceleration energy in<br>
cyclotrons constructed heretofore is 520 MeV per nucleon.<br>
The weight of iron reaches 4000 tons.<br>
In recent years, an induction synchrotron as a<br>
circular accelerator for protons different from the radio<br>
frequency accelerator has been proposed. The induction<br>
synchrotron for protons is an accelerator that can<br>
eliminate the disadvantages of the rf synchrotron 35.<br>
Specifically, the induction synchrotron for protons is an<br>
accelerator that can contain a large number of protons in<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
an advancing axis direction while maintaining a constant<br>
line density at a limit currant value or less.<br>
A first feature of the induction synchrotron for<br>
protons is that a proton beam can be confined in the<br>
advancing axis direction by a pair of positive and<br>
negative induced voltages in pulse generated by an<br>
induction cell to form a long proton bunch (super-bunch)<br>
in the order of jisec.<br>
A second feature is that the confined super-bunch<br>
can be accelerated by an induced voltage of a long pulse<br>
length generated by a different induction cell.<br>
Specifically, the conventional rf synchrotron 35 is<br>
of a functionally combined type that performs confinement<br>
and acceleration of protons with common radio frequency<br>
waves 37 in an advancing axis direction, while the<br>
induction synchrotron is of a functionally separated type<br>
that independently performs confinement and acceleration.<br>
An induction accelerating device allows the<br>
separation of the confinement and acceleration of protons.<br>
The induction accelerating device includes an induction<br>
cell for confinement of protons and an induction cell for<br>
acceleration of protons as one-to-one transformers having<br>
magnetic material cores, and switching power supplies for<br>
driving the induction cells, or the like.<br>
A pulse voltage is generated in the induction cell<br>
in synchronization with a revolution frequency of a<br>
proton beam. For example, in an accelerator having a<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
circumference on the order of 300 m, a pulse voltage has<br>
to be generated at a repetition of 1 MHz CW.<br>
As a direct application of the induction synchrotron<br>
for protons, a proton driver for exploring next-<br>
generation neutrino oscillations and proton-proton<br>
colliders employing super-bunches have been proposed.<br>
With these accelerators, it is expected that a higher<br>
proton beam intensity four times the proton beam<br>
intensity of a proton accelerator realized by the<br>
conventional rf synchrotron 35 is achieved.<br>
A collider as an application of the induction<br>
synchrotron is referred to as a super-bunch hadron<br>
collider. The super-bunch hadron collider that makes the<br>
most use of the specific features of an induction<br>
synchrotron is expected to realize a luminosity an order<br>
of magnitude larger than a collider of the same size<br>
based on a synchrotron using the conventional radio<br>
frequency waves 37. This is equivalent to the luminosity<br>
simultaneously provided by 10 colliders based on the rf<br>
synchrotron. It is noted that the construction cost of<br>
each collider can reach 300 billion yen.<br>
Now, the acceleration principle in the induction<br>
synchrotron will be described. Induced voltages having<br>
different polarities are generated by the induction cells.<br>
A velocity of proton having momentum larger than momentum<br>
of an ideal particle positioned in the bunch center 3b is<br>
higher than that of the ideal particle, and thus the<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
proton advances and reaches the bunch head 3c. When the<br>
proton reaches the bunch head 3c, the proton is reduced<br>
in velocity by a negative induced voltage, reduced in<br>
momentum, and becomes lower in velocity than the ideal<br>
particle locating at the bunch center, and starts moving<br>
backward of the bunch 3a. When the proton reaches the<br>
bunch tail 3d, the proton starts receiving a positive<br>
induced voltage, and is accelerated. Thus, the momentum<br>
of the proton exceeds the momentum of the ideal particle.<br>
During acceleration, all protons belonging to the proton<br>
bunch repeat the above described process.<br>
This is essentially the same as the well-known phase<br>
stability (Figure 11) of the rf synchrotron 35. By this<br>
property, the protons are confined in the form of the<br>
bunch 3a in the advancing axis direction.<br>
However, the proton cannot be accelerated by induced<br>
voltages having different polarities. Thus, the proton<br>
has to be accelerated by other induction cells that can<br>
apply a uniform positive induced voltage. It is known<br>
and demonstrated that the functional separation of<br>
confinement and acceleration significantly increases<br>
flexibility in beam handling in the advancing axis<br>
direction.<br>
An induction accelerating device that generates an<br>
induced voltage of 2 kV at a repetition rate of 1 MHz CW<br>
has been completed and introduced in the KEK 12 GeV<br>
proton rf synchrotron (hereinafter referred to as<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
12GeVPS) . The 12GeVPS is an rf synchrotron 35 for proton<br>
having a circumference of about 340 m. In the recent<br>
experiment on induction acceleration where a proton bunch<br>
was confined by the existing rf voltage and accelerated<br>
with the induction voltage, the 12GeVPS has succeeded to<br>
demonstrate the induction acceleration of a proton beam<br>
from 500 MeV up to 8 GeV.<br>
However, it has been heretofore considered to be<br>
impossible to accelerate various species of ion in their<br>
allowed charge states in a single accelerator to obtain<br>
high energy.<br>
This is because in the conventional rf synchrotron<br>
35, the rf cavity 36a as a resonator used for<br>
acceleration has a high quality factor, and radio<br>
frequency waves 37 can be excited only in a finite band<br>
width. Thus, when the circumference<br>
of the rf synchrotron 35, the field strength of the<br>
bending electromagnet 5 used, and the bandwidth of the<br>
radio frequency waves 37 used are determined, the mass<br>
number A and the charge state Z of ions that can be<br>
accelerated are substantially and uniquely determined and<br>
only the limited ions can be accelerated in a low energy<br>
area where the velocity significantly changes.<br>
On the other hand, in a cyclotron, only ions having<br>
a constant ratio between the mass number and the charge<br>
sate can be accelerated correspondingly to the bandwidth<br>
of the radio frequency waves 37. Also, in an<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
electrostatic accelerator such as a Van de Graaff<br>
accelerator that can accelerate any ions, the limit of<br>
acceleration energy is 20 MeV from the capability of<br>
voltage-resistance of the device in vacuum or pressured,<br>
gas.<br>
The linear induction accelerator can provide an<br>
energy of several hundred MeV or more, but the cost for<br>
obtaining the energy and the physical size of the linear<br>
induction accelerator become enormous. Parameters of the;<br>
linear induction accelerator presently obtained are<br>
substantially a hundred million yen/1 MeV and 1 m/1 MeV.<br>
Thus, obtaining an ion beam of 1. GeV requires a cost of<br>
100 billion yen, and the entire length of the accelerator<br>
of 1 km.<br>
Further, in the induction synchrotron for protons,<br>
such as the KEK12GeVPS that has been demonstrated as an<br>
induction synchrotron, its injection energy is already<br>
sufficiently high, and acceleration of protons<br>
substantially having the speed of light only has been<br>
considered. Specifically, the proton beam is already<br>
accelerated substantially up to the speed of light in the<br>
upstream accelerator. Thus, when the protons are<br>
accelerated by the induction synchrotron, it is only<br>
necessary to generate an induced pulse voltage of the<br>
induction cell at almost constant intervals. Thus,<br>
trigger timing of the induced voltage applied to the<br>
proton beam needs not to be changed with acceleration.<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
However, when all ions are accelerated in a single<br>
induction synchrotron, the trigger timing of the induced<br>
voltage has to be changed depending on the revolution of<br>
individual ion species. This is because the revolution<br>
frequency significantly differs among ion species as<br>
shown in Figure 12.<br>
Thus, the present invention has an object to provide<br>
an accelerator that can accelerate by itself all ions up<br>
to ciny energy level allowed by the field strength of<br>
electromagnets used for beam guiding (hereinafter<br>
referred to as any energy level).<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
A configuration of a focusing electromagnet 6 of an<br>
induction synchrotron 2 that constitutes an all-ion<br>
accelerator 1 of the present invention is a strong<br>
focusing configuration as in a conventional rf<br>
synchrotron 35. A radio frequency accelerating device 36<br>
is replaced by an induction accelerating device for<br>
confinement 9 and an induction accelerating device for<br>
acceleration 12. An induction cell for confinement 10<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
and an induction cell for acceleration 13 that constitute<br>
the induction accelerating device for confinement 9 and<br>
the induction accelerating device for acceleration 12 are<br>
driven by switching power supplies capable of operating<br>
at a high repetition rate for confinement and<br>
acceleration 9b and 12b that generate pulse voltages lOf.<br>
On/off operations of the switching power supplies for<br>
confinement and acceleration 9b and 12b are performed by<br>
controlling gate signal patterns for confinement and<br>
acceleration 11a and 14a responsible for gate driving of<br>
switching elements such as MOSFETs used in the switching<br>
power supplies for confinement and acceleration 9b and<br>
12b.<br>
The gate signal patterns for confinement and<br>
acceleration 11a and 14a are generated by pattern<br>
generators for confinement and acceleration lib and 14b.<br>
The pattern generators for confinement and acceleration<br>
lib and 14b start their operation by gate master signals<br>
for confinement and acceleration lie and 14c.<br>
The gate master signal for confinement lie is<br>
generated in real time by a previously programmed<br>
processing method by a digital signal processor for<br>
confinement lid on the basis of a passage signal 7a of<br>
the ion beam 3 detected by a bunch monitor 7 and an<br>
induced voltage signal 9e for indicating the value of an<br>
induced voltage applied to the ion beam 3 by the<br>
induction cell for confinement 10.<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
The gate master signal for acceleration 14c is<br>
generated in a real time by a previously programmed<br>
processing method by a digital signal processor for<br>
acceleration 14d on the basis of a passage signal 7b of<br>
the ion beam 3 detected by the bunch monitor 7, a<br>
position signal 8a of the ion beam 3 detected by a<br>
position monitor 8, and an induced voltage signal 12e for<br>
indicating the value of an induced voltage applied to the<br>
ion beam 3 by the induction cell for acceleration 13.<br>
Ions generated by an ion source 16 are accelerated<br>
to a certain velocity by a preinjector 17, and the ion<br>
beam 3 of the ions is injected into the induction<br>
synchrotron 2 continuously for a certain time-period.<br>
Then, the induction cell for confinement 10 is turned on<br>
to generate negative and positive barrier voltages 26 and<br>
27 (hereinafter simply referred to as barrier voltages).<br>
Then, a time duration between barrier voltage pulses 30<br>
is gradually reduced, and the ion beam 3 distributed over<br>
the entire region of a design orbit 4a is formed into a<br>
bunch 3a on the order of the length of a charging time-<br>
period 28a of an acceleration voltage 28 generated by the<br>
induction cell for acceleration 13. Then, a bending<br>
electromagnet 5 and the focusing electromagnet 6 of the<br>
induction synchrotron 2 are excited from their injection<br>
field levels.<br>
The pulse voltages 10f of the negative and positive<br>
barrier voltages 26 and 27 of the induction cell for<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
confinement 10 are controlled on the basis of the passage<br>
signal 7a that is the passage information of the ion beam<br>
3 obtained from the bunch monitor 7 and the induced<br>
voltage signal 9e for indicating the value of the induced<br>
voltage applied to the ion beam 3 to generate the gate<br>
signal pattern for confinement 11a in synchronization<br>
with excitation of magnetic fields.<br>
On the basis of the passage signal 7b obtained by<br>
the bunch monitor 7, the position signal 8a obtained by<br>
the position monitor 8, and the induced voltage signal<br>
12e for indicating the value of the induced voltage<br>
applied to the ion beam 3, the pulse voltages lOf of the<br>
acceleration voltage 28 (hereinafter simply referred to<br>
as an induced voltage for acceleration) and a reset<br>
voltage 29 of the induction cell for acceleration 13 are<br>
controlled to generate a gate signal pattern for<br>
acceleration 14a in synchronization with excitation of<br>
magnetic fields.<br>
The generation of the barrier voltage of a certain<br>
constant level of amplitude and the induced voltage of a<br>
certain constant level of amplitude for acceleration is<br>
controlled in time for the ion beam 3 to follow the<br>
excitation of the magnetic fields. Thus, the ion beam 3<br>
is inevitably formed into the bunch 3a and accelerated.<br>
The series nf control devices for confinement and<br>
acceleration of the ion beam 3 are intelligent control<br>
devices for confinement and acceleration 11 and 14.<br><br>
- 24 -<br>
Thus, all ions can be accelerated to an alleged<br>
energy level simply by changing program settings of the<br>
digital signal processors for confinement and<br>
acceleration lid and 14d in the feedback control by the<br>
intelligent control devices for confinement and<br>
acceleration 11 and 14, depending on ion species and<br>
target energy.<br>
Finally, after the end of the acceleration (a<br>
maximum magnetic field excitation state), the ion beam 3<br>
accelerated up to the predetermined energy level is<br>
extracted to an ion beam utility line 21. An extraction<br>
method includes a method of extracting the ion beam 3 in<br>
one turn by a rapid extraction system 20 such as an<br>
kicker magnet while maintaining a structure of the bunch<br>
3a, and a method of gradually increasing the time<br>
duration between barrier voltage pulses 30 up to a time<br>
corresponding to a revolution time period, then once<br>
turning off the gate driving of the switching power<br>
supplies for confinement 9b and 12b for driving the<br>
induction cell for confinement 10 to break the structure<br>
of the bunch 3a into the ion beam 3 in the form of a DC<br>
beam, and then continuously extracting the ion beam 3<br>
little by little in a number of turns by the extraction<br>
system 20 using betatron resonance. The extraction<br>
method can be selected according to the purpose of use of<br>
the ion beam 3.<br><br>

Now, the all-ion accelerator 1 of the present<br>
invention will be described in detail with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a whole block<br>
diagram of the all-ion accelerator of the present<br>
invention. The all-ion accelerator 1 of the present<br>
invention may use devices used in a conventionalrf<br>
synchrotron complex 34 other than the induction<br>
accelerating device for confinement 9, the induction<br>
accelerating device for acceleration 12 for controlling<br>
acceleration of the ion beam 3 and an rf linear<br>
accelerator 17b.<br>
The all-ion accelerator 1 includes an injection<br>
device 15, the induction synchrotron 2, and an extraction<br>
device 19. The injection device 15 includes the ion<br>
source 16, the preinjector 17, an injector 18, and<br>
transport pipes 16a and 17a that connect the devices ,<br>
which are placed upstream of the induction synchrotron 2.<br>
As the ion source 16, an ECR ion source using an<br>
electronic cyclotron resonance heating mechanism, a laser<br>
driven ion source, or the like is used. The ion beam may<br>
be directly injected from the ion source 16 into the<br>
induction synchrotron.<br>
As the preinjector 17, a variable-voltage<br>
electrostatic accelerator or a linear induction<br>
accelerator is generally used. When the ion species to<br>
be used are determined, a small-sized cyclotron may be<br>
used.<br><br>
- 26 -<br>
As the injector 18, a device used in the complex of<br>
rf synchrotron 34 is used. No particular device and<br>
method is required for the all-ion accelerator 1 of the<br>
present invention.<br>
In the injection device 15 having the above<br>
described configuration, the ion beam 3 generated by the<br>
ion source 16 is accelerated by the preinjector 17 to a<br>
certain energy level and injected into the induction<br>
synchrotron 2 by the injector 18.<br>
The induction synchrotron 2 includes an annular<br>
vacuum duct 4 having the design orbit 4a of the ion beam<br>
3 therein, the bending electromagnet 5 that is provided<br>
on a curved portion of the design orbit 4a and holds a<br>
circular orbit of the ion beam 3, the focusing<br>
electromagnet 6 that is provided on a linear portion of<br>
the design orbit 4a and prevents diffusion of the ion<br>
beam 3, the bunch monitor 7 that is provided in the<br>
vacuum duct 4 and detects passage of the ion beam 3, the<br>
position monitor 8 that is provided in the vacuum duct 4<br>
and detects the center of gravity position of the ion<br>
beam 3, the induction accelerating device for confinement<br>
9 including the induction cell for confinement 10 that is<br>
connected to the vacuum duct 4 and generates an induced<br>
voltage for confinement of the ion beam 3 in an<br>
propagating direction of ions and the intelligent control<br>
device for confinement 11 that controls driving of the<br>
induction cell for confinement 10, and the induction<br><br>
- 27 -<br>
accelerating device for acceleration 12 including the<br>
induction cell for acceleration 13 that is connected to<br>
the vacuum duct 4 and generates an induced voltage for<br>
acceleration of the ion beam 3 and the intelligent<br>
control device for acceleration 14 that controls driving<br>
of the induction cell for acceleration 13.<br>
The devices for confinement have the function of<br>
reducing the length of the ion beam 3 injected from the<br>
injection device 15 into the induction synchrotron 2 to<br>
be formed into the bunch 3a having a certain length so<br>
that the ion beam can be accelerated by another induction<br>
cell with a predetermined induced voltage or changing the<br>
length of the ion beam 3 in various ways, and the<br>
function of providing phase stability to the bunch 3a of<br>
the ion beam 3 during acceleration.<br>
The devices for acceleration have the function of<br>
providing an induced voltage for acceleration to the<br>
entire bunch 3a after the formation of the bunch 3a of<br>
the ion beam 3.<br>
The induction accelerating device for confinement 9<br>
and the induction accelerating device for acceleration 12<br>
are the same in physics and electronics sense, but<br>
different in function to the ion beam 3. Hereinafter,<br>
the induction accelerating device means both the<br>
induction accelerating device for confinement 9 and the<br>
induction accelerating device for acceleration 12.<br>
Similarly, the induction cell means both the induction<br><br>
- 28 -<br>
cell for confinement 10 and the induction cell for<br>
acceleration 13. Further, the electromagnet means both<br>
the bending electromagnet 5 and the focusing<br>
electromagnet 6.<br>
The extraction device 19 includes a beam tram;port<br>
pipe 20a that connects to a facility 21a in which<br>
experimental devices 21b or the like using the ion beam 3<br>
accelerated up to the predetermined energy level by the<br>
induction synchrotron 2 are placed, and the extraction<br>
system 20 that extracts the ion beam 3 to the ion beam<br>
utility line 21. The experimental devices 21b include<br>
medical facilities used for therapy.<br>
As the extraction system 20, a kicker magnet for<br>
rapid extraction, or a device for slow extraction using<br>
betatron resonance or the like may be used, and the<br>
extraction system can be selected depending on the ways<br>
of use of the ion beam 3.<br>
With the above described configuration, the all-ion<br>
accelerator 1 of the present invention by itself can<br>
accelerate all ions up to any energy level.<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional schematic diagram of the<br>
induction cell for confinement that constitutes the all-<br>
ion accelerator.<br>
The induction cells for confinement and acceleration<br>
10 and 13 used in the present invention have the same<br>
structure in principle as an induction cell for a linear<br>
induction accelerator constructed heretofore. The<br><br>
- 29 -<br>
induction cell for confinement 10 will be described<br>
herein. The induction cell for confinement 10 has a<br>
double structure of an inner cylinder 10a and an outer<br>
cylinder 10b, and a magnetic material 10c is inserted<br>
into the outer cylinder 10b to produce an inductance.<br>
Part of the inner cylinder 10a connected to the vacuum<br>
duct 4 through which the ion beam 3 passes is made of an<br>
insulator lOd such as ceramic. Since the induction cell<br>
generates heat in use, any coolant, such as cooling oil<br>
or the like is circulated in the outer cylinder 10b,<br>
which requires an insulator seal lOj.<br>
When the pulse voltage lOf is applied from the<br>
switching power supply 9c to a primary coil surrounding<br>
the magnetic material 10c, a primary current lOg (core<br>
current) flows through the circuit to excite the magnetic<br>
material 10c, thereby increasing the density of a<br>
magnetic flux passing through the magnetic material 10c<br>
of toroidal shape in time. During this time-period, the<br>
electric field 10e is induced according to Faraday's<br>
induction law on a secondary side including opposite ends<br>
10h of the inner cylinder 10a of a conductor with the<br>
insulator 10d therebetween. The electric field lOe<br>
becomes an acceleration electric field. A portion where<br>
the acceleration electric field is produced is an<br>
acceleration gap 10i. Thus, the induction cell for<br>
confinement 10 is equivalent to a one-to-one transformer.<br><br>
- 30 -<br>
The switching power supply for confinement 9b that<br>
generates the pulse voltage 10f is connected to the<br>
primary coil of the induction cell for confinement 10,<br>
and the switching power supply for confinement 9b is<br>
externally turned on/off to freely control the production<br>
of the acceleration electric field. This means that the<br>
acceleration of the ion beam 3 can be controlled in a<br>
digital manner.<br>
When the bunch head 3c (where ions exist having<br>
somewhat higher energy than the ions in the bunch center<br>
3b) of the ion beam 3 enters the acceleration gap 10i, an<br>
induced voltage (hereinafter referred to as a negative<br>
barrier voltage) that has a length corresponding to a<br>
time width of the head and provides the electric field<br>
10e in an opposite direction from the propagating<br>
direction of ions is generated in the induction cell for<br>
confinement 10. The energy of the ions is reduced by the<br>
negative barrier voltage. In a time period when the<br>
bunch center 3b of the ion beam 3 passes, no induced<br>
voltage is generated.<br>
In a time period when the bunch tail 3d (where ions<br>
exist having somewhat lower energy than the ions in the<br>
bunch center 3b) passes, an induced voltage (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a positive barrier voltage) that provides<br>
the electric field lOe in the same direction as the<br>
propagating direction of ions is generated. The energy<br><br>
- 31 -<br>
of ions is increased by the induced voltages of different<br>
sign.<br>
When the ion beam 3 repeatedly receives the induced<br>
voltages of different sign, the energy of the ions first<br>
having higher energy than the ions in the bunch center 3b<br>
becomes lower than the energy of the ions in the bunch<br>
center 3b; the arrival timing at the induction cell for<br>
acceleration is gradually and relatively delayed. On the<br>
other hand, the bunch tail 3d receives the induced<br>
voltage that provides the electric field 10e in the same<br>
direction as the propagating direction of the ion beam 3<br>
as described above, and after a while, the particles once<br>
located in the bunch tail overtake the bunch center 3b<br>
and become to arrive at the induction cell for<br>
confinement 10 relatively earlier to locate in the bunch<br>
head. The ion beam 3 is accelerated while repeating the<br>
above series of processes. This is referred to as<br>
confinement of the ion beam 3 in the propagating<br>
direction of ions.<br>
This provides the same advantage as the phase<br>
stability (Figure 11) in the conventional rf synchrotron<br>
35. The function of the induction cell for confinement<br>
10 is equivalent to the function of confinement of the<br>
conventional rf cavity 36a. In the induction synchrotron,<br>
however, the induced voltage is discontinuously applied<br>
to the ion beam 3 as the pulse voltage 10f, and thus the<br>
induction cell has a digital operation property, in the<br><br>
- 32 -<br>
contrast to a fact that the rf cavity 36a in the<br>
conventional rf synchrotron is always excited with the<br>
radio frequency waves 37, whatever there exists the ion<br>
beam 3 in it or not.<br>
On the other hand, in the induction cell for<br>
acceleration 13, an induced voltage (hereinafter referred<br>
to as an acceleration voltage) is generated so as to<br>
produce an acceleration field in the same direction as<br>
the propagating direction of ions during the passage of<br>
the ion beam 3 through the acceleration gap lOi. In<br>
order to prevent magnetic: saturation of the magnetic<br>
material 10c, an induced voltage (hereinafter referred to<br>
as a reset voltage) in an opposite sign from the induced<br>
voltage has to be generated in any time between the<br>
passage of the ion beam 3 and the next passing of the ion<br>
beam 3. It is noted that for the induction cell for<br>
confinement 10, the induced voltage generated by the<br>
reset is also effectively used for confinement in the<br>
propagating direction of ions.<br>
Though one induction cell has been herein described,<br>
a number of induction cells is selected from a<br>
requirement on pulse-length of the induced voltage for<br>
the accelerated ion beam 3 and a required acceleration<br>
voltage per revolution or the like. A design of an<br>
induction cell having a low voltage droop is desired.<br><br>
- 33 -<br>
Figure 3 shows a configuration of the induction<br>
accelerating device and an acceleration control method of<br>
the ion beam.<br>
The induction accelerating device for confinement 9<br>
includes the induction cell for confinement 10 that<br>
generates the barrier voltage that is a pair of induced<br>
voltages with different polarity for confinement of the<br>
ion beam 3 in the propagating direction of ions, the<br>
switching power supply capable of operating at high rep-<br>
rate for confinement 9b that supplies the pulse voltage<br>
lOf to the induction cell for confinement 10 via a<br>
transmission line 9a, the DC power supply 9c that<br>
supplies electric power to the switching power supply for<br>
confinement 9b, the intelligent control device for<br>
confinement 11 that performs feedback control of on/off<br>
operations of the switching power supply for confinement<br>
9b, and a voltage monitor 9d for indicating the value of<br>
the induced voltage applied from the induction cell for<br>
confinement 10.<br>
The transmission line 9a is used when a switching<br>
used in the switching power supply for confinement 9b is<br>
a semiconductor or the like and cannot survive a high<br>
radiation environment. The transmission line 9a is<br>
unnecessary for a switching element without the risk of<br>
radiation damage or the case where a low radiation<br>
environment can be maintained, and the switching power<br><br>
- 34 -<br>
supply for confinement 9b and the induction cell for<br>
confinement 10 can be directly connected.<br>
The intelligent control device for confinement 11<br>
includes the pattern generator for confinement lib that<br>
generates the gate signal pattern for confinement 11a for<br>
controlling on/off operations of the switching power<br>
supply for confinement 9b, and the digital signal<br>
processor for confinement lid that calculates the gate<br>
master signal for confinement lie that is essential<br>
information of the generation of the gate signal pattern<br>
for confinement 11a by the pattern generator for<br>
confinement lib.<br>
The gate master signal for confinement lie is<br>
calculated by the digital signal processor for<br>
confinement lid according to a previously programmed<br>
processing method on the basis of the passage signal 7a<br>
of the ion beam 3 measured by the bunch monitor 7 that<br>
detects the passage of the ion beam 3 placed on the<br>
design orbit 4a, and the induced voltage signal 9e<br>
measured by the voltage monitor 9d for indicating the<br>
value of the induced voltage applied to the ion beam 3,<br>
and generated in real time.<br>
Specifically, in the digital signal processor for<br>
confinement 11d, the trigger timing of the applied<br>
barrier voltage is calculated from the passage signal 7a,<br>
and the length of the time-period of the barrier voltage<br>
is calculated from the passage signal 7a and the induced<br><br>
- 35 -<br>
voltage signal 9e, which are converted into digital<br>
signals and sent to the pattern generator for confinement<br>
11b.<br>
The gate signal pattern for confinement 11a includes<br>
three patters of the negative barrier voltage 26 applied<br>
to the ion beam 3, the positive barrier voltage 27, and<br>
the voltage off. The value of the negative barrier<br>
voltage and the value of the positive barrier voltage are<br>
different depending on the properties and kinds of the<br>
ion beam 3, but may be constant during acceleration and<br>
thus may be previously programmed in the digital signal<br>
processor for confinement lid. The value of the induced<br>
voltage is uniquely determined by an output voltage of<br>
the DC power supply 9c and a bank capacitor 23 used.<br>
The induction accelerating device for acceleration<br>
12 includes the induction cell for acceleration 13 that<br>
generates the induced voltage for acceleration<br>
constituted by the acceleration voltage for accelerating<br>
the ion beam 3 in the propagating direction of ions and<br>
the reset voltage for preventing magnetic saturation of<br>
the magnetic material 10c, the switching power supply for<br>
acceleration 12b capable of operating at a high<br>
repetition rate that supplies the pulse voltage 10f to<br>
the induction cell for acceleration 13 via a transmission<br>
line 12a, a DC power supply 12c that supplies electric<br>
power to the switching power supply for acceleration 12b,<br>
the intelligent control device for acceleration 14 that<br><br>
- 36 -<br>
performs feedback control of on/off operations of the<br>
switching power supply for acceleration 12b, and the<br>
voltage monitor 12d for indicating the value of the<br>
induced voltage applied from the induction cell for<br>
acceleration 13.<br>
The induction accelerating system for acceleration<br>
12 is electrically the same as the induction accelerating<br>
system for confinement 9 though the role of the induced<br>
voltage supplied to the ion beam 3 is different. The<br>
differences from the accelerating device for confinement<br>
9 are that the reset voltage generated for preventing<br>
magnetic saturation of the magnetic material 10c performs<br>
no action on the ion beam 3, and the trigger timing of<br>
the reset voltage is chosen in a time period when the ion<br>
beam 3 does not pass.<br>
The intelligent control device for acceleration 14<br>
includes the pattern generator for acceleration 14b that<br>
generates the gate signal pattern for acceleration 14a<br>
for controlling on/off operations of the switching power<br>
supply for acceleration 12b, and the digital signal<br>
processor for acceleration 14d that calculates the gate<br>
master signal for acceleration 14c that controls an<br>
operation that is essential information of the generation<br>
of the gate signal pattern for acceleration 14a by the<br>
pattern generator for acceleration 14b.<br>
The gate master signal for acceleration 14c is<br>
calculated by the digital signal processor for<br><br>
- 37 -<br>
acceleration 14d according to a previously programmed<br>
processing method on the basis of the passage signal 7b<br>
of the ion beam 3 measured by the bunch monitor 7 that<br>
detects the passage of the ion beam 3 placed on the<br>
design orbit 4a, the position signal 8a measured by the<br>
position monitor 8 that detects the center of gravity<br>
position of the ion beam 3, and the induced voltage<br>
signal 12e measured by the voltage monitor 12d for<br>
indicating the value of the induced voltage applied to<br>
the ion beam 3, and generated in real time.<br>
Specifically, in the digital signal processor for<br>
acceleration 14d, trigger timing of the applied induced<br>
voltage for acceleration is calculated from the passage<br>
signal 7b and the position signal 8a, and the length of<br>
the charging time of the induced voltage for acceleration<br>
is calculated from the passage signal 7a and the induced<br>
voltage signal 12e, which are converted into digital<br>
signals and sent to the pattern generator for<br>
acceleration 14b.<br>
The gate signal pattern for acceleration 3.4a<br>
includes three patterns of the acceleration voltage 28<br>
applied to the ion beam 3, the reset voltage 29, and the<br>
voltage off. The value of the acceleration voltage and<br>
the value of the reset voltage are uniquely determined by<br>
output voltages of the DC power supply 12c and the bank<br>
capacitor 23. As a result, the acceleration voltage 28<br><br>
- 38 -<br>
integrated in time follows an excitation pattern of the<br>
electromagnet of the all-ion accelerator 1.<br>
It is demonstrated that the gate signal patterns for<br>
confinement and acceleration 11a and 14a generated in<br>
real time can be generated at an arbitrary frequency from<br>
substantially 0 Hz to 1 MHz close to an operation limit<br>
of semiconductor switching elements of the switching<br>
power supplies for confinement and acceleration 9b and<br>
12b that drive the induction cells for confinement and<br>
acceleration 10 and 13. This results from a property of<br>
the induction synchrotron that the passage signals 7a and<br>
7b of the ion beam 3 are obtained from the bunch monitor<br>
7 to generate the gate signal patterns for acceleration<br>
11a and 14a. Here, the rf cavity 36a cannot be used,<br>
because the rf frequency may be far from the revolution<br>
frequency depending on the ion species, as described<br>
earlier, though a radio frequency signal in<br>
synchronization with revolution of protons obtained from<br>
the rf cavity 36a has been used in the previous<br>
experiment of induction acceleration of protons that is<br>
described in the literature [xx].<br>
Detailed processing of the gate master signals for<br>
confinement and acceleration 11e and 14c in the digital<br>
signal processor for confinement and acceleration 11d and<br>
14d having the feedback function is performed as<br>
described below. When an induced voltage higher than an<br>
induced voltage that ensures ideal acceleration is<br><br>
- 39 -<br>
actually supplied to the ion beam 3, the ion beam 3 is<br>
displaced outward from the design orbit 4a. This occurs<br>
in a case that there is an error in voltage setting<br>
accuracy of the DC power supply 9c and 12c. In this case,<br>
charging voltages of the bank capacitors 23 of the<br>
switching power supplies for acceleration 9b and 12b are<br>
shifted from ideal values. Thus, the induced voltages<br>
generated in the induction cells for acceleration 10 and<br>
13 are shifted from the value required for acceleration.<br>
Thus, the displacement of the orbit of the ion beam<br>
3 is detected by the position signal 8a detected by the<br>
position monitor 8 to obtain a momentum shift. The<br>
digital signal processor for acceleration 14d performs an<br>
intelligent calculation so as to stop generation of the<br>
acceleration voltage 28 by turn numbers required for<br>
correction of the error, and actually stops generation of<br>
the gate master signal for acceleration 14c. A plural<br>
number of position monitors 8 may be used. Using the<br>
plural number of position monitors 8 causes the<br>
acceleration of the ion beam 3 to be controlled with<br>
higher accuracy, and help to avoid loss of the ion beam 3.<br>
The acceleration of the ion beam 3 by the feedback<br>
control allows the design orbit 4a of the ion beam 3 to<br>
be held, and allows all ions to be stably accelerated to<br>
any energy level allowed by the bending electromagnet 5<br>
and the focusing electromagnet 6.<br><br>

Figure 4 is an equivalent circuit diagram of the<br>
induction accelerating system for confinement. As shown,<br>
in the equivalent circuit 22 of the induction<br>
accelerating system for confinement, the switching power<br>
supply for confinement 9b always charged by the DC power<br>
supply 9c connects to the induction cell for confinement<br>
10 via the transmission line 9a. The induction cell for<br>
confinement 10 is shown by a parallel circuit consisting<br>
of L, C and R. Voltages across the parallel circuit are<br>
the induced voltages received by the ion beam 3.<br>
In the circuit in Figure 4 9b, first and fourth<br>
switches 23a and 23d are turned on by the gate signal<br>
pattern for confinement 11a, the voltage charged in the<br>
bank capacitor 23 is applied to the induction cell for<br>
confinement 10, and the induced voltage for confinement<br>
of the ion beam 3 is generated in the acceleration gap<br>
lOi. The first and fourth switches 23a and 23d having<br>
been on are then turned off by the gate signal pattern<br>
for confinement 11a, second and third switches 23b and<br>
23c are turned on by the gate signal pattern for<br>
confinement 11a, an induced voltage in an opposite<br>
direction is generated in the acceleration gap lOi, and<br>
excitation of the magnetic material 10c is reset. Then,<br>
the second and third switches 23b and 23c are turned off<br>
by the gate signal pattern for confinement 11a, and the<br>
first and fourth switches 23a and 23d are turned on.<br>
Repeating the series of switching operation by the gate<br><br>
- 41 -<br>
signal pattern for confinement 11a allows the confinement<br>
of the ion beam 3.<br>
The gate signal pattern for confinement 11a is a<br>
signal for controlling performance of the switching power<br>
supply for confinement 9b, generated as a digital signal<br>
by the intelligent control device for confinement 11<br>
constituted by the digital signal processor for<br>
confinement lid and the pattern generator for confinement<br>
lib on the basis of the passage signal 7b of the ion beam<br>
3, and the induced voltage signal 9e for indicating the<br>
value of the induced voltage applied to the ion beam 3.<br>
The induced voltage applied to the ion beam 3 is<br>
equivalent to the value calculated from the product of a<br>
current flowing in the matching resistance 24 and the<br>
known magnitude of the matching resistance 24. Thus, the<br>
value of the applied induced voltage can be obtained by<br>
measuring the current value. Thus, the induced voltage<br>
signal 9e obtained by the voltage monitor 9d that is an<br>
ammeter is sent to the digital signal processor for<br>
confinement lid, and used for generation of the next gate<br>
master signal for confinement 11e.<br>
Figure 5 shows a confinement process of the ion beam<br>
by the induction cell for confinement. Figure 5(A) shows<br>
the state of the ion beam 3 just after the start of the<br>
confinement. The axis of abscissa represents the time<br>
and the axis of ordinate represents the value of the<br>
induced voltage. The double-headed arrow shows a<br><br>
- 42 -<br>
revolution time period 25 for one turn of the ion beam 3<br>
along the design orbit 4a. The same applies to Figure<br>
5(B).<br>
In order to trap a left tip of the ion beam 3<br>
extending along the entire design orbit 4a, each switch<br>
of the switching power supply for confinement 9b is<br>
turned on so that the negative barrier voltage 26, that<br>
is the induced voltage in the direction opposite the<br>
propagating direction of ions, is generated in the<br>
induction cell for confinement 10. The charging time 26a<br>
of the negative barrier voltage 2 6 to the ion beam 3 may<br>
be short. Then, each switch of the switching power<br>
supply for confinement 9b is turned on to trap the other<br>
end of the ion beam 3 so that the positive barrier<br>
voltage 27 in the same direction as the propagating<br>
direction of the ion beam 3 is generated in the induction<br>
cell for confinement 10 near the end of the revolution<br>
time period 25 of the ion beam 3 that corresponds the end<br>
of the ion beam 3. The positive barrier voltage 27 is<br>
simultaneously used for avoiding the magnetic saturation<br>
of the magnetic material 10c; therefore, the amplitude<br>
and pulse width of the negative and positive barrier<br>
voltages 26 needs to be same. These barrier voltages<br>
causes the confinement of the entire ion beam 3 injected<br>
into the induction synchrotron 2 and distributed along<br>
the entire design orbit 4a.<br><br>
- 43 -<br>
The length of the bunch 3a largely shrinks in time<br>
if a non-relativistic region, associated with<br>
acceleration, because of the rapid change in velocity of<br>
the bunch. Figure 5(B) shows a process how the barrier<br>
voltages follows this shrinking.<br>
A time duration between generations of the negative<br>
barrier voltage 26, that traps the tip of the ion beam 3,<br>
and the positive barrier voltage 27, that traps the end<br>
of the ion beam 3 (hereinafter referred to as a time<br>
duration between barrier voltage pulses 30), is reduced,<br>
and the ion beam 3 is formed into the bunch 3a having the<br>
length within the charging time 28a of the acceleration<br>
voltage 28 so that the ion beam 3 can be accelerated in<br>
the charging time 28a of the acceleration voltage 28<br>
generated in the different induction cell for<br>
acceleration 13.<br>
Specifically, the trigger timing of the negative<br>
barrier voltage 26 is fixed, and the control to advance<br>
the trigger timing of the positive barrier voltage 27 is<br>
performed by the intelligent control device for<br>
confinement 11. The outline left arrows show a moving<br>
direction of the trigger timing of the positive barrier<br>
voltage 27.<br>
Figure 6 shows the state of acceleration of the ion<br>
beam by the induction synchrotron of the prssent<br>
invention. V(t) denotes the induced voltage value.<br><br>

Figure 6(A) shows positions of the bunch 3a or the<br>
super-bunch 3e of the ion beam 3 (both bunches may not<br>
exist in the same acceleration period) on the design<br>
orbit 4a at a certain time during acceleration. With<br>
reference to Figure 6, for the simplicity, a case where<br>
confinement and acceleration of the ion beam 3 is<br>
performed in one induction cell for confinement.10 and<br>
one induction cell for acceleration 13 facing the design<br>
orbit 4a will be described, although multiple induction<br>
sells are employed in a real situation. The passage of<br>
the ion beam 3 is confirmed by the passage signals 7a and<br>
7b of the bunch monitor 7.<br>
Figure 6(B) shows the state of confinement of the<br>
ion beam 3 by the induction cell for confinement 10.<br>
t(a) denotes the trigger timing of the barrier voltage<br>
and the charging times 26a and 27a with reference to time<br>
when the bunch 3a or the super-bunch 3e reaches the<br>
induction cell for confinement 10. The dotted vertical<br>
line shows the revolution time period 25 of the bunch 3a<br>
or the super-bunch 3e. The same applies to Figure 6 (c)<br>
(D) .<br>
The time, when the bunch 3a or the super-bunch 3e<br>
reaches the induction cell for confinement 10 in the<br>
succeeding turn, is calculated by the digital signal<br>
processor for confinement lid on the basis of the passage<br>
signal 7a obtained from the bunch monitor 7, and then the<br>
gate signal pattern for confinement 11a is generated so<br><br>
-45-<br>
as to generate the negative barrier voltage 26, and the<br>
negative barrier voltage 26 is applied to the bunch head<br>
3 or the head of the super-bunch 3e.<br>
The time, when the tail of the bunch 3a or the super<br>
bunch 3e reaches the induction cell for confinement 10 in<br>
the succeeding turn, is calculated by the digital signal<br>
processor for confinement 11d on the basis of the passage<br>
signal 7a obtained from the bunch monitor 7, the gate<br>
signal pattern for confinement 11a is generated so as to<br>
generate the positive barrier voltage 27, and the<br>
positive barrier voltage 27 is applied to the bunch tail<br>
3d or the tail of the super-bunch 3e.<br>
In this manner, the bunch 3a or the super-bunch 3e<br>
can be confined. The trigger timing of the applied<br>
negative and positive barrier voltages 26 and 27 are<br>
calculated by the digital signal processor for<br>
confinement 11d on the basis of the induced voltage<br>
signal 9e from the voltage monitor 9d, and used by the<br>
next gate master signal for confinement 11e. A short<br>
bunch 3a of the ion beam 3 can be accommodated simply by<br>
reducing the time duration between barrier voltage pulses<br>
30.<br>
Figure.6(C) shows the state of acceleration of the<br>
ion beam 3 by the induction cell for acceleration 13.<br>
t(b) denotes the trigger timing of the induced voltage<br>
for acceleration and the charging times 28a and 29a with<br><br>
- 46 -<br>
reference to time when the bunch 3a or the super-bunch 3e<br>
reach the induction cell for acceleration 13.<br>
The time, when the bunch 3a or the super-bunch 3e<br>
reaches the induction cell for acceleration 13, is<br>
calculated by the digital signal processor for<br>
acceleration 14d on the basis of the passage signal la<br>
obtained from the bunch monitor 7, and then the gate<br>
signal pattern for acceleration 14a is generated and the<br>
acceleration voltage 28 is applied to the entire bunch 3a<br>
or super bunch 3e.<br>
The induced voltage having an opposite polarity<br>
from the acceleration voltage 28 as a reset voltage is<br>
applied on the induction cell for acceleration for<br>
avoiding magnetic saturation of the magnetic material 10c<br>
in a time period calculated by the digital signal<br>
processor for acceleration 14d, in which the ion beam 3<br>
does not exist. In this manner, the bunch 3a or the<br>
super-bunch 3e can be accelerated. (1/2)T0, means that<br>
the time references of t(a) in Figure 6(B) and t(b) in<br>
Figure 6 (C) are shifted by half of the revolution time<br>
period 25.<br>
Figure 6(D) shows the state of acceleration of the<br>
bunch 3a or the super-bunch 3e at a certain time, which<br>
is a composition of Figure 6(B) and Figure 6(C). Thus, t<br>
on the axis of abscissa represents the time reference<br>
shifted from the time references of the induction cell<br>
for confinement 10 and the induction cell for<br><br>
- 47 -<br>
acceleration 13 by half of the revolution time period 25.<br>
The same applies to t in Figure 7.<br>
Figure 7 shows a method for accelerating the ion<br>
beam 3 after being formed into multiple bunches 3a. This<br>
method has an advantage of reducing the induced voltage<br>
value of the barrier voltage.<br>
The method for accelerating the ion beam 3 after<br>
being formed into the multiple bunches 3a can be<br>
performed by first dividing the injected ion beam 3 in<br>
the form of the DC beam into the multiple bunches 3a,<br>
finally forming the multiple bunches 3a into a single<br>
bunch 3a (super-bunch 3e), and following the order from<br>
Figures 7(A) to (E).<br>
The axis of ordinate represents the induced voltage<br>
value and the axis of abscissa represents time. The<br>
double-headed lateral broken arrow shows the revolution<br>
time period 25 of ions just after the injection.<br>
Figure 7(A) shows the state just after the ion beam<br>
3 accelerated up to a certain energy level by the<br>
preinjector 17 is injected into the vacuum duct 4 in a<br>
way of multi-turn. The injected ion beam 3 is placed in<br>
the form of the DC beam along the entire design orbit 4a.<br>
The description will be made on a uranium ion (+39) as an<br>
example with the revolution time period 25 at this time<br>
of 10 us and the revolution frequency in injection on the<br>
order of 100 kHz.<br><br>
- 48 -<br>
Figure 7(B) shows a method for confinement of the<br>
ion beam 3 placed on the entire design orbit 4a in the<br>
form of multiple ion bunches 3 by the barrier voltage<br>
applied by the induction cell for confinement 10. The<br>
double-headed lateral solid arrow denotes a time duration<br>
between barrier voltage pulses 30. The double-headed<br>
lateral solid arrow denotes a time period between the<br>
trigger timings of adjacent barrier voltages having the<br>
same polarity {hereinafter referred to as a time duration<br>
between the same polarity barrier voltage pulses 31).<br>
In this manner, the ion beam 3 placed along the<br>
entire design orbit 4a is separated into the multiple ion<br>
segments 3. When the charging times 26a and 27a of the<br>
barrier voltage by the induction cell for confinement 10<br>
are each 0.5 us or less, the ion beam 3 can be separated<br>
into ten sections of ion beam 3.<br>
Figure 7(C) shows a method for forming the segmented<br>
ion beams 3 into the multiple bunches 3a. The pulse<br>
duration between barrier voltage pulses 30 is gradually<br>
reduced, and the time duration between the same polarity<br>
barrier voltage pulses 31 is also reduced. Then, the<br>
multiple bunches are ready to receive the acceleration<br>
voltage 28, as seen in Fig 7(D). Associated with<br>
acceleration, the time duration between the positive<br>
barrier voltage 27 and the negative barrier voltage 26<br>
generated next is reduced so as to reduce an interval<br>
between adjacent bunches 3a (hereinafter referred to as a<br><br>
- 49 -<br>
bunch interval 32) to bring the confined bunches 3a close<br>
to each other.<br>
Figure 7 (D) shows a process to combine the multiple<br>
bunches 3a into a single bunch 3a. A combined single<br>
bunch 3a is created by applying only the first negative<br>
barrier voltage 26 and the last positive barrier voltage<br>
27 among the negative and positive barrier voltages 26b<br>
and 27b capturing the multiple bunches 3a. The negative<br>
and positive barrier voltages 26b and 27b that are not<br>
applied can be selected by generating the gate signal<br>
pattern for confinement 11a in real time according to a<br>
processing method previously programmed in the digital<br>
signal processor for confinement lid of the intelligent<br>
control device for confinement 11 depending on ion<br>
species and predetermined energy level. The selection of<br>
an acceleration voltage 28b and a reset voltage 29b that<br>
are unnecessary, and the stop of their generation is<br>
controlled by the intelligent control device for<br>
acceleration 14.<br>
Further, if the bunches 3a can be confined or<br>
connected within the range of the charging time 28a of<br>
the acceleration voltage 28 by the induction cell for<br>
acceleration 13 before the ion beam 3 is formed into the<br>
single bunch 3a, the generation of the acceleration<br>
voltage 28 and the reset voltage 29 is controlled by the<br>
intelligent control device for acceleration 14 to allow<br><br>
- 50 -<br>
the ion beam 3 to be more efficiently accelerated up to a<br>
set energy level.<br>
Figure 7 (E) shows the state where the ion beam 3 is<br>
completely formed into the single bunch 3a (super-bunch)<br>
and confined and accelerated. With the processes shown<br>
in Figures 7(A) to (E) , the ion beam 3 can be accelerated<br>
up to the set energy level more efficiently than the<br>
confinement and acceleration methods shown in Figures 5<br>
and 6. The method described here can be adopted because<br>
the driving frequency of the switching power supplies for<br>
confinement' and acceleration 9b and 12b is variable from<br>
0 Hz to 1 MHz, and the gate signal patterns for<br>
confinement and acceleration 11a and 14a can be generated<br>
in real time by the digital signal processors for<br>
confinement and acceleration lid and 14d and the pattern<br>
generators for confinement and acceleration lib and 14b.<br>
Figure 8 shows an acceleration method of the ion<br>
beam by multiple induction cells. Generally, it is<br>
required that the barrier voltage is relatively high in<br>
the short charging times 26a and 27a, the acceleration<br>
voltage 28 is relatively low in the long charging time<br>
28a, and the reset voltage 29 has to have the same value<br>
of the product of charging time 29a and voltage as that<br>
of the acceleration voltage pulse. The requirement can<br>
be satisfied by using the multiple induction cells for<br>
confinement and acceleration 10 and 13. As an example,<br>
an operation pattern in use of triple induction cells for<br><br>
- 51 -<br>
confinement and acceleration 10 and 13 will be described.<br>
This method can increase the flexibility of the selection<br>
of ions and energy levels.<br>
Figure 8 (A) shows the size of the barrier voltage<br>
supplied by the triple induction cells for confinement 10<br>
and the charging time. The axis of ordinate represents<br>
voltage and the axis of abscissa represents time. (1),<br>
(2) and (3) denote the first induction cell for<br>
confinement 10, the second induction cell for confinement<br>
10, and the third induction cell for confinement 10. (4)<br>
denotes the substantially superimposed negative and<br>
positive barrier voltages 26f and 27f that are applied to<br>
the ion beam 3 by the triple induction cells for<br>
confinement 10.<br>
Negative barrier voltages 26c, 26d and 26e are<br>
applied to the bunch 3a of the ion beam 3 that has<br>
reached the triple induction cells for confinement 10 in<br>
the order from (1) to (3). Since the bunch 3a circulates<br>
along the design orbit with a large velocity, change in<br>
the relative position of an individual ion within the<br>
time-difference of arrival is quite small and neglected.<br>
It is understood that the negative barrier voltages 26c,<br>
26d and 26e are applied to the bunch 3a substantially at<br>
the same time. Similarly, positive barrier voltages 27c,<br>
27d and 27e are applied to the bunch tail 3d. Thus, the<br>
barrier voltage equal to the total negative and positive<br>
barrier voltages 26f and 27f in (4) are applied to the<br><br>
- 52 -<br>
bunch 3a at the bunch head 3c and the bunch tail 3d. In<br>
this manner, the induction cells for confinement 10 are<br>
combined to effectively obtain required barrier voltages.<br>
Specifically, even if the values of barrier voltage 26g<br>
and 27g applied by a single induction cell for<br>
confinement 10 is low, a high barrier voltage values 26h<br>
and 27h can be obtained.<br>
Figure 8 (B) shows how an effectively long<br>
acceleration voltage is obtained by combining the triple<br>
induction cells for acceleration 13 and the charging time.<br>
The axis of ordinate represents induced voltage for<br>
acceleration, and the axis of abscissa representstime.<br>
In addition, three pairs of acceleration voltage pulse<br>
28a and its reset pulse 29c are shown. (1), (2) and (3)<br>
denote a first induction cell for acceleration 13, a<br>
second induction cell for acceleration 13, and a third<br>
induction cell for acceleration 13. Three acceleration<br>
voltage pulses are generated with a systematic delay in<br>
time, as seen in Figure 8(B). (4) denotes the total<br>
acceleration voltage 28f and the total reset voltage 29f<br>
applied to the bunch 3a by the triple induction cells for<br>
acceleration 13. It is noted that the reset voltage<br>
pulses are simultaneously generated.<br>
Acceleration voltages 28c, 28d and 28e at a certain<br>
acceleration voltage value 28h are first applied to the<br>
ion beam 3 having reached the triple induction cells for<br>
acceleration 13 in the order from (1) to (3). At this<br><br>
- 53 -<br>
time, the charging time is shifted from (1) to (3), and<br>
thus the acceleration voltages 28c, 28d and 28e can be<br>
applied to the entire ion beam 3. This ensures the<br>
charging time 28g of the total acceleration voltage 28f<br>
in (4) for the entire ion beam 3. Even if one induction<br>
cell for acceleration 13 can apply the acceleration<br>
voltage 28 only in a short charging time 28a, the<br>
induction cells for acceleration 13 are combined to<br>
ensure a long charging time 28a. Specifically, the two<br>
objects of confinement and acceleration can be<br>
accommodated only by the combination of the unit<br>
induction cells that can generate a low induced voltage.<br>
This can reduce production costs of the induction<br>
accelerating system.<br>
Reset voltages 29c, 29d are 29e are applied for<br>
avoiding magnetic saturation of the triple induction<br>
cells for acceleration 13 in a time period without the<br>
ion beam 3. In theory, the time period other than the<br>
time period for the application of the reset voltages 29c,<br>
29d and 29e can be used as the time period for<br>
application of the acceleration voltage 28, thereby<br>
allowing all ions to be accelerated as the super-bunch 3e.<br>
Since the gate signal pattern for confinement 11a of<br>
the switching element in the switching power supply for<br>
confinement 9b is freely controlled, the arbitrary time<br>
duration of the barriers voltage pulses can be achieved.<br>
As a result, the bunch 3a can be held in a long shape in<br><br>
- 54 -<br>
the propagating direction of ions with a uniform<br>
distribution of ions, which cannot be achieved in<br>
principle by the conventional rf synchrotron 35, thereby<br>
significantly increasing the number of ions that can be<br>
simultaneously accelerated.<br>
Figure 9 shows the results of calculation of<br>
attainable energy per nucleon for various ions having<br>
their maximum charge state that can be attained when the<br>
existing KEK 500MeVPS and 12GeVPS are switched to the<br>
all-ion accelerator of the present invention.<br>
As the ion beam 3, the following species are chosen:<br>
H (hydrogen), C (carbon), N (nitrogen), Ne (neon), Al<br>
(aluminum), Ca (calcium), 0 (oxygen), Mg (magnesium), Ar<br>
(argon), Ni (nickel), Zn (zinc), Kr (krypton), Xe (xenon),<br>
Er (erbium), Ta (tantalum), Bi (bismuth) , U (uranium) , Te<br>
(tellurium), Cu (copper), and Ti (titanium).<br>
The axis of abscissa in the graph represents the<br>
atomic number, and atoms are plotted in increasing order<br>
of the atomic number from the left. The axis of ordinate<br>
in the graph represents the amount of energy per nucleon<br>
of ions accelerated by each accelerator. The unit of the<br>
left axis is megavolt (MeV), and the unit of the right<br>
axis is gigavolt (GeV). The right axis is used only for<br>
reference to the results of the changed 12GeVPS.<br>
shows a prediction of attainable energy of various<br>
ion beams 3 when the existing KEK SOOMeVPS (an<br>
electromagnet power supply that is an existing resonant<br><br>
- 55 -<br>
power supply is used as it is) is switched to the all-ion<br>
accelerator 1 of the present invention, • shows a<br>
prediction thereof when the switched KEK SOOMeVPS (the<br>
electromagnet power supply that is the existing resonant<br>
power supply is replaced by a pattern power supply), and<br>
shows a prediction result thereof when the KEK 12GeVPS<br>
is switched to the all-ion accelerator 1 of the present<br>
invention.<br>
For a comparison with the conventional accelerator,<br>
there is also shown the actual performance of<br>
acceleration (within the broken line) of the ion beam 3<br>
in a ring cyclotron being operated in The Institute of<br>
Physical and Chemical Research that so far had been the<br>
largest-sized cyclotron in Japan and has a similar<br>
physical size to the KEK 500MeV PS, 0 surrounded by one<br>
broken line shows the obtained energy for various ion<br>
species in a case of the linear rf accelerator injection<br>
33 into the cyclotron. D surrounded by the other broken<br>
line shows the obtained energy for various ion species in<br>
a case using the AVF cyclotron as an injector.<br>
In a slow cycle synchrotron using an electromagnet<br>
driven by a pattern control power supply, its extraction<br>
energy is easily changed. In a rapid cycle synchrotron<br>
using an electromagnet driven by a resonant circuit power<br>
supply, the acceleration energy per nucleon is determined<br>
by the mass number and charge state of the ion of concern,<br>
because of a constant field strength.<br><br>
- 56 -<br>
The result shown in Figure 9 suggests that all-ion<br>
accelerator 1 of the present invention achieves the<br>
followings.<br>
First, the 500MeVPS (• and •) covers an energy area<br>
that is unattainable by the conventional cyclotron.<br>
Specifically, even in the rf linear accelerator injection<br>
33 (O) that can accelerate particular heavy ions, ion<br>
species that can be accelerated are limited by an limited<br>
acceleration distance of the rf linear accelerator 17b<br>
anda physical limit of the rf employed in the cyclotron,<br>
and the attainable energy level is also limited by the<br>
physical limit of electromagnet. The ions that can be<br>
accelerated include a proton to Ta, and the attainable<br>
energy thereof is 7 to 50 MeV per nucleon.<br>
On the other hand, in the AVF cyclotron injection<br>
33a (D) , the ion can be accelerated up to a certain high<br>
energy level (about 200 MeV) if the ion is light such as<br>
a proton , compared with the case of the rf linear<br>
accelerator injection 33 (O) , though the ions that can<br>
be accelerated are up to Cu, Zn by a limit of the<br>
injector.<br>
Second, in the modified 12GeVPS, even heavy ions can<br>
be accelerated to energy of about 4 GeV or more per-<br>
nucleon.<br>
Thus, the all-ion accelerator 1 of the present<br>
invention is used to accelerate all ions including heavy<br>
ions up to any energy level allowed by the magnetic field<br><br>
- 57 -<br>
strength, some of which cannot be achieved by the<br>
conventional cyclotron and rf synchrotron 35.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The present invention has the above described<br>
configuration and can obtain the following advantages.<br>
First, the conventional rf synchrotron 35 can be switched<br>
to the all-ion accelerator 1 of the present invention as<br>
every devices of the conventional rf synchrotron 35 other<br>
than the radio frequency accelerating device 36 are<br>
available in the all-ion accelerator.<br>
Second, the all-ion accelerator 1 of the present<br>
invention can accelerate all ions by itself up to any<br>
energy level allowed by the magnetic fields for beam<br>
guiding.<br>
Specifically, the 12GeVPS has been demonstrated as<br>
an all-ion accelerator and the KEK 500MeVPS is going to<br>
be modified to the all-ion accelerator 1 of the present<br>
invention, thus for the 500MeVPS, various ions can be<br>
accelerated to the energy level unattainable even by the<br>
cyclotron of The Institute of Physical and Chemical<br>
Research normally operated for material and life science,<br>
and for the 12GeVPS, all ions can be accelerated up to<br>
about 4 GeV per nucleon to the maximum.<br>
Further, the all-ion accelerator of the present<br>
invention takes the above described advantages, and thus<br>
can supply heavier ions in any charge state besides<br><br>
- 58 -<br>
carbon beams that have been recently supplied for cancer<br>
therapy, which may significantly increase type of cancers<br>
that can be treated by particle beams and remarkably<br>
increase the flexibility of therapy. Also, the<br>
flexibility in production of medical radio isotopes,<br>
radioactivation analysis by short-lived nucleus, and<br>
semiconductor damage tests is significantly increased.<br>
Further, the ground check for predicting damages by heavy<br>
ion cosmic rays can be performed of various kinds of<br>
electronic equipment mounted in satellites used in<br>
aerospace.<br><br>
