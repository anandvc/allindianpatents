				<td>The present invention relates to a sensor package and a method for mounting a vertical<br>
sensor circuit component<br>
[0001]     The present invention relates generally to methods<br>
of manufacturing sensors and sensors produced by such methods.<br>
More specifically;   the present invention relates to the design<br>
and manufacture of low	-profile multi   -axis sen   sors,   for<br>
example,  magnetic and tilt sensors.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]  The Earth's magnetic field intensity is about 0.5 to 0.6 gauss and has a component parallel to the Earth's surface that always points toward magnetic north.  This field can be approximated with a dip ole model - the field always points north, but the angle of the field relative to the surface of the Earth changes from horizontal at the equator to sub horizontal (i.e., "down" toward the ground) in the northern hemisphere and supra-horizontal (i.e., "up" toward the air) in the southern hemisphere.  In all cases, the horizontal direction of the Earth's field points toward magnetic north and is used to determine compass direction.<br>
[0003]  Magnetic sensors have been in use for well over 2,000 years, primarily used  to sense the Earth's magnetic field for direction finding or navigation.  Today, magnetic sensors are still a primary means of navigation and many other uses have evolved. As a result, magnetic sensors may be found in medical, laboratory, and electronic   instruments; weather buoys; virtual reality systems; and a variety of other systems.<br>
[0004]  Modern consumer and commercial electronic equipment design has generally involved the consolidation of numerous disparate functions into a single device and the evolutio n of devices of increasingly diminutive scale.  Small devices and devices that incorporate numerous functions require their internal components to be as small as possible.  The desire to incorporate wayfinding and navigation technology into such compact de vices requires the requisite 2  - and 3 -dimensional sensors, for example magnetic sensors and/or tilt sensors, to be of minimum height in the Z -axis (i.e., out of the plane of the printed circuit board (PCB)),   Mounting a vertical sensor along the Z-axis is a challenge for the semiconductor assembly industry, especially for applications that have space limitations.  Current methods fail to mount vertical (2 -axis) sensors for applications with limited space and cost sensitive, high volume, standard PCS processes.<br>
[0005]  Therefore, a need exists for mounting sensors orthogonally to other sensors mounted in the plane of a printed circuit board, said orthogonally mounted sensors measuring forces or magnetic fields on the Z       -axis.  In particular, a need exists for mounting  of orthogonal sensors in a low profile manner in, for example, cell phone and other consumer and commercial applications.  Such needs should be filled by applications that are cost sensitive, high volume, and easily adaptable to common PCB assembly processes.<br>

As such, the vertical sensor circuit component can be conductively connected to the horizontal sensor circuit component in certain embodiments.<br>

In still other embodiments, one or more vertical sensor components can be one kind of sensor, for example, magnetic or tilt sensors, and the one or more horizontal sensor circuit component can be a sensor of a different kind, for example, a solid state chip that can provide a vertical support edge.  In still other embodiments, the one or more vertical sensor components can be any kind of sensor, for example, magnet ic or tilt sensors, and the one or more horizontal sensor circuit component can be any solid state chip, whether or not it is an actual sensor, provided it<br>
comprises a vertical sensor circuit component interface edge that can provide support for the vertic    al sensor circuit component -<br>
[0010]  In a second aspect of the invention, a method for mounting a vertical sensor circuit component is provided.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0025]  Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings, which are merely exemplary embodiments.  With respect to Figure 1, there is illustrated the construction of a three -axis sensor of the invention designated generally by the reference number  100.  The three -axis sensor includes a printed circuit board (PCB)    101 to which sensor circuit components (i.e., sensors) are attache d.  A horizontal sensor circuit component 102, for example a magnetoresistive or Hall effect material assembled into an integrated circuit package or utilized as a bare die, is mounted to the PCB     101 using standard chip -on-board techniques such as wire bon  ding/ flip chip, and flexible interconnect bonding.  See, for example, Van Zant,   Microchip Fabrication , 4 th Edition,- McGraw  -Kill (2000); Chapter 18, pp.557   -593; the disclosure of this reference is incorporated by reference. Generally, sensors, as shown in 102, 103, and 204, are referred to s"sensor circuit components/" with more specific descriptors added as necessary; for example, a magnetic field sensor circuit component is a sensor circuit component sensitive to magnetic fields.  Other sensor components d   escribed herein can also mount to a PCB  101 utilizing the same standard chip -on-board techniques. Preferably the horizontal sensor circuit componenc 102 is diced such that it possesses generally vertical edges along its thickness.  An edge along the thickn     ess of the horizontal sensor circuit component   102 serves as a support<br>
for a vertical sensor circuit component         103 mounted orthogonally to the horizontal sensor circuit component   102. With this in mind, as used herein the terms '"sensors" and "horizontal sensor circuit components " also comprise, for example, solid state chips that possess no "sensing" ability per se but comprise a  vertical edge along its thickness (a "vertical sensor circuit component interface edge")   thai; can provide physical support to a    sensor, such as a magnetic sensor, that is mounted vertically on a PCB.  An exemplary embodiment is a two-axis magnetic sensor that comprises a two -axis magnetic sensor mounted vertically on the PCB, wherein the vertically mounted magnetic sensor is mount ed against any generic (sensing or non -sensing) solid state chip on the PCB. The solid state chip or chips need only comprise a    vertical sensor circuit component interface edge that can serve as a support for the vertical sensor in the vertical axis.<br>
[0026]  In the exemplary embodiment of      Figure 1 , the horizontal sensor circuit component     102 are sensitive to forces, for example, magnetic forces, along the X and Y  -axes, i.e., the axes that define the plane of the PCB  101.  In this example, the vertical sensor cir     cuit component   103 is sensitive to forces along the remaining orthogonal axis, the Z-axis.  Thus, in this exemplary figure, the horizontal sensor circuit component   102 is a 2   -dimensional sensor. It is contemplated that additional circuitry would be mounted on the PCB 101, which is independent from any attached sensor circuit components or which acts in concert with any attached sensor circuit components. A first and second sensor circuit components, be they vertical or horizontal, can be<br>
conductively or non -conductively connected to each other, as illustrated in Figure 3 through Figure 7 .  in addition, while Figures 1  -4 illustrate the horizontal sensor circuit components as equal in height, no such limitation is implied. Generally, the vertical sensor circu   it component is taller along the Z axis than the horizontal sensor circuit component, but both components may be of the same height or the horizontal sensor circuit component can be taller.  However, the height of the sensor package is preferably about 1.1 mm or less.<br>
[0027]  According to the exemplary embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 1, the angular orientations of the individual horizontal sensor circuit component     102 and vertical sensor circuit component  103 are positioned to sense and measure ac curately the three orthogonal components of an external magnetic field along three dimensions or axes,   i.e., the X, Y and Z axes.  In this exemplary embodiment, such positioning can involve ensuring the vertical sensor circuit component 103 is mounted at an angle normal, or perpendicular, to the horiaontal sensor circuit component  102.  In preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention, the vertical sensor circuit component  103, and hence the combined sensor package of vertical and horizontal sensor  circuit components, is low-profile, or about 1.1 mm in height or less.  Further, the horizontal and vertical sensor circuit components generally comprise electrical connections, for example, input/output (I/O) pads for, among any suitable connection technologies, solder bumping or stud bumping, on the surface that mounts to the PCE    101 and, in certain embodiments, tc<br>
other sensor circuit components.  Other chip        -on-board techniques can be used to establish electrical connections between the PCB and sensor circuit components.<br>
[0023]  Figure 2 illustrates two alternate constructions of a three-axis sensor package made according to the methods of the invention, designated generally by the reference number 200.  In the exemplary embodiments of    Figure 2 , the sensor package comprises at least three main components, a first and second horizontal, 1  -dimensional, sensor circuit component 204, and a vertical sensor circuit component    103.  As used herein, a "horizontal, 1      -dimensional, sensor circuit component" refers to a sensor   that is sensitive to forces along a single axis.  Jn Figure 2, the first and second horizontal, 1 -dimensional, sensor circuit components  204 are mounted so that each is sensitive to forces on the plane of the PCB orthogonal to the other.      Figure 2A illustrates a sensor package wherein two horizontal, 1  -dimensional, sensor circuit components are mounted separately in space on the PCB, with only one of the two sensor circuit components serving as a support for the vertical sensor circuit component       103. Figure 2B illustrates a sensor package wherein the two horizontal, 1 -dimensional, sensor circuit components  204 are in contact, conductively or non  -conductively attached, with both serving as a support for the vertical sensor circuit component 103.  The hori2 ontal, 1-dimensional, sensor circuit components can also be mounted in a sensor package wherein the horizontal sensor circuit components 204 are in conductive or non-conductive contact, but only one of the horizontal 1 dimensional sensor circuit components  serves as a support for<br>
the vertical sensor circuit component    103.  In alternate embodiments of the invention, the vertical sensor circuit component can be mounted vertically but be sensitive to forces along one or more axes other than the 2 axis.  That i s, any of the vertical and horizontal sensor circuit components utilized to form sensor packages of the invention can be sensitive co forces along one or more axes.<br>
[0029]  Horizontal, 1-dimensional, sensor circuit components 204 (as well as "first sensor circui     t components,"  102) generally have electrical connections, for example, input/output (I/O) pads, for example, for solder bumping or stud bumping, on at least the surface that mounts to the PCB 101.  Horizontal, 1-dimensional, sensor circuit components 204 (as well as vertical sensor circuit components   103) can also have electrical connections, such as I/O pads, on surfaces other than those interfacing with the PCB to facilitate extra -PCB electrical connection, such as, for example, between sensor circuit components.  Other chip -on-board techniques can be used to establish electrical connections.<br>
[0030]  As with the three -axis sensor 100 of Figure 1 , an edge along the thickness of one or more horizontal, 1 dimensional, sensor circuit components (   204) serves aa a support for the vertical sensor circuit component  103 mounted orthogonally to one or more of the horizontal, 1  -dimensional, sensor circuit components 204.  Preferably the horizontal, 1 dimensional, sensor circuit components 204 are diced such that they possess generally vertical edges along their thicknesses<br>
to support the vertically-mounted sensor circuit component 103 to which they are conductively or non-conductively connected.<br>
[0031]  Horizontal, 1-dimensional, sensor circuit components 204 can be substantially si tnilar to a vertical sensor circuit component 103, except that the vertical component generally mounts to the PCB 101 along the thickness, or an edge, of the sensor rather than on its face,   i.e., it mounts vertically. Such vertical sensor circuit component  s generally have any electrical connections (for example, I/O pads for solder humping or stud bumping or bonding pads for wire bonding) on at least a face of the sensor, generally near the edge that mounts to the PCB  101,  Preferably, I/O pads are arranged  as an array, and the array can be perpendicular to a sensitive direction of the sensor.  See also  Figure 7 for an exemplary embodiment.  Vertical sensor circuit components can comprise sensors sensitive to forces along a single axis and can thus be referr ed to as "vertical, 1   -dimensional, sensor circuit components" in such embodiments.  In other embodiments, vertical sensor circuit components are sensitive to forces in more than one direction, along any of the X, Y or Z axes.<br>
[0032]  According to exemplary embodi ments A and B of the invention illustrated in Figure 2, the angular orientations of the individual first and second horizontal, 1    -dimensional, sensor circuit components   204 and vertical sensor circuit components 103 are adjusted to sense and measure accura   tely the three orthogonal components of an external magnetic field along three dimensions or axes, i.e., the X, Y and 2 axes.  in preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention, the<br>
vertical sensor circuit component  103 is low profile, or less than about 1.1 mm in height-  In alternate embodiments, vertical die chip -on-board sensor packages can be made that are sensitive to forces along less than, three axes.  Utilizing Figure 2 as an example, one horizontal, I -dimensional, sensor circuit component 204 can be omitted, leaving the remaining horizontal sensor circuit component   204 and vertical sensor circuit component 103 to be mounted according to the methods of the invention.<br>
[0033]  Figure 3 represents front and side views schematic diagrams of a vertical die  chip -on-board sensor packages and demonstrates exemplary methods of attachment between the vertical sensor circuit component     103, horizontal sensor circuit component  102, 204 and the PCB   101.   Figure 3 can comprise, for example, a three -axis sensor 100 of Figure 1 or one or more horizontal, 1      -dimensional, sensor circuit component 204 and a vertical sensor circuit component   103 of Figure 2.  The sensor package, for example a magnetic sensor, includes a PCB  101 to which sensor circuit components are attached. A horizontal sensor circuit component     102 or a horizontal, 1 -dimensional, sensor circuit component   204 is mounted to the PCB     101 utilising standard chip   -on-board techniques such as wire bonding, flip chip, and flexible interconnect bonding, electrical c   onnections  105.  Such exemplary electrical connections are represented by wire bonds or TAB bonds    105 between the horizontal sensor circuit component 102, 204 and the PCB  101 in Figure 3 (A), solder joints 105 between the vertical sensor circuit component   103<br>
and the PCB  101 in Figure 3 (A) and (C), and stud bumps encased in conductive epoxy  105 between the vertical sensor circuit component  103 and the PCB    101 in Figure 3 (B). Figures 4-7 also exeraplarily demonstrate flip chip electrical connections.  Elec trical connections  105 are not limited to those illustrated in the figures.  In this exemplary embodiment, a sensor 102, 204 that is mounted on the X-Y plane of the PCB  101, or sensitive to magnetic fields on the plane of the PCB 101, and the vertical sens or circuit component 103 do not feature electrical connections 105 between them and are connected by a sensor component bonds    104, which can form layers between any of the sensor 102, 204, the vertical sensor circuit component; 103 and the PCB  101.  The sen sor component bond 104 can be either non  -conductive or conductive.  For example, a sensor component bond 104 can be formed from a non -conductive epoxy, a conductive epoxy, or solder.

[0035J  Figure 5 is a side view of another alternative exemplary embodiment of a vertical die chip   -on-board sensor package according to the invention.   Figure 5 is analogous to Che embodi ment illustrated in   Figure 3 , with one primary exception.    Figure 5 illustrates an embodiment wherein a sensor 102, 204 that is mounted on the X  -Y plane of the PCE<br>
101 and the vertical sensor circuit component     103 are in direct electrical communication, i .e., they feature electrical connections 106 between them.  In such embodiments, both an edge of the sensor    102,  204 as well as any electrical connections 106 between them can. serve as a support for the vertical sensor circuit component     103.  The electrica   1 connections between a sensor  102, 204 that ia mounted on the X-Y plane of the PCB    101 and the vertical sensor circuit component 103 can be formed using standard techniques in the art, for example wire bonding, flip chip, and flexible interconnect bonding, e.g., cape automated bonding (TAB) and the like.

While horizontal and vertical sensor circuit components can be in electrical communication with each other, the vertical sensor circuit component is preferably in electrical contact with the PCB through, for example, connections facilitated by I/O pads  702 as illustrated in Figure 7.  As with Figure 4,, exemplary electrical connections  105 are represented by both flexible interconnect bonding, such as   wire bonds or TAB bonds   105 between the top face of the horizontal sensor circuit component 102, 204 and th e PCB, as well as by flip chip techniques between the PCB mounting face of the horizontal sensor circuit component 102, 204 and the PC3 101.

[0036]  Figure 6 is a side view of another alternative exemplary embodiment of a vertical die chip   -on-board sensor package according to the invention.   Figure 6 is analogous to Figure 5 with the add ition of a sensor component fixture  107. Applications requiring robust sensors, for example, where sensors can be subject to large forces than could act to misalign or otherwise damage the sensors, may require greater strucfural integrity than is availabl   e from one or more electrical connections 106 or a sensor component bond 104.  In such instances, a sensor component fixture 107 can be utilized to more adequately brace or support the vertical sensor circuit component 103 against or directly to an edge of   the sensor 102,  204.  The sensor component fixture    107 can be located anywhere at the interface between sensor circuit components.  For example, the sensor component fixture 107 can be located along the sides of the dies as shown in Figure 6. Alternatively, the sensor component fixture 107 can be located along an interface between a face of a horizontal sensor circuit component and an edge of a vertical sensor circuit component as illustrated in Figure 4.  In such embodiments, the sensor component fixture   107  (conductive or preferablv non-conductive), comprises, for example, conductive epoxy, non-conductive epoxy, or other adhesive.  The sensor component fixture 107 can form a bead along the interface   108 between the sensor 102, 204 and the vertical sensor circuit component 103,  Similarly, a sensor component fixture       107 can be utilized with embodiments such as that illustrated in Figure 2 (B) , wherein all sensor components   103, 204) are in direct electrical or non-electrical communication.  As with Figures  4<br>
and 5, the methods of forming electrical interconnections  iC outlined above are preferably utilized separately but can be utilized simultaneously.<br>
"0037]  Figure 7 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary vertical die chip -on-board sensor package where an array o I/O pads  702 is arranged on the second face of a vertical sensor circuit component (analogous to Figure 3 (C)), in this exemplary case orthogonal to the sensitive direction of the vertical sensor circuit component.  As stated above, the vertical sensor c ircuit component can be sensitive to forces along one or more axes and need not be sensitive to forces only along the Z axis.  In this exemplary embodiment, the vertical and horizontal sensor circuit components can be connected as illustrated in, for examp le, any' of Figures 1 -6. An array of electrical contacts are positioned along the first face of the vertical sensor circuit component; in this exemplary case orthogonal to the sensing direction of the vertical sensor circuit component.  In addition, though     a horizontal sensor circuit component is shown that is sensitive to forces along two axes, here the X and Y axes, a horizontal sensor circuit component can also be sensitive to forces along a single axis, including the Z axis.  Electrical contacts, for example, solder or stud bumps, are preferably arranged in an array and facilitate electrical connection between the vertical sensor circuit component 103 and the PCB 101.<br>
[0038]  Figure 8 is a flow chart diagram of a method of mounting a vertical sensor circuit component 103 on a PCB 101. The vertical sensor circuit component comprises a first and<br>
second face, a bottom, a top and two side edges, and I/O pads arranged on the second face proximal to the bottom edge.  The bottom edge of the vertical sensor circuit co  mponent 103 is conductively or non -conductively connected to the PCB    101, which is represented by  Box 1.  Said vertical sensor circuit component 103 is mounted adjacent or abutted to a horizontal sensor circuit component 102, 204.  Box 2 shows connecting the first face of the vertical sensor circuit component   103 to 3 vertical sensor circuit component interface edge of one or more horizontal sensor circuit components      102,  204, the horizontal sensor circuit components comprising a top face, a PCB mounting fa  ce, a vertical sensor circuit component interface edge, and at least two other edges. Standard chip on-board techniques such as wire bonding, flip chip, solder bumping, stud bumping, conductive epoxy,         and flexible interconnect bonding, e.g., tape automated    bonding (TAB), techniques are used.  The sensor  102, 204 can be mounted to the PCB  101 before or after connecting the vertical sensor circuit component  103 to the PCB  101.  The result of this method of mounting a vertical sensor circuit component on a PCB 101 is that a vertical sensor circuit component interface edge of one or more horizontal sensor circuit components  102, 204 to which the sensor circuit component  103 is electrically or non -electrically connected supports the vertical sensor circuit component 103 along the Z axis.  The resulting sensor package is durable and resistant to distortion of the alignment between orthogonally aligned sensing axes.  The vertical sensor circuit component 103, can comprise (I/O) pads<br><br>
on one or more faces.  The one or components  103 mounted vertically on the PCB        101 and preferably one or more horizontal sensor circuit components 102,  204 are preferably diced so that the edges are substantially perpendicular to the faces.<br>
[0039]  In some embodiments, the one or more magnetic field sensing circuit components are horizontal sensor circuit components, while in other embodiments are one or more horizontal, 1 -dimensional sensor circuit components.  The vertical magnetic sensing circuit component can be non conductively connected to the magnetic field sensing circuit component, and the non  -conductive connection can be formed with an adhesive, such as non-conductive epoxy.<br>
[0040]  Figure 9 is a flow chart diagram of a method of making a multi -axis magnetometer for measurin g the magnetic field intensity along three orthogonal axes.  One or more magnetic field sensing circuit components  102, 204 comprisinq a top face, a PCB mounting face, a vertical magnetic sensor circuit component interface edge, and two or more other edges , are mounted by their PCB mounting faces to a PCB       101, as represented by Box 1 .  Box 2 represents mounting a magnetic sensor circuit component 103 comprising a first face, a second face, a bottom edge, a top edge, two side edges, input/output (I/O) pads a nd a sensitive direction to the PCB   101 wherein the I/O pads are arranged on the second face of the sensor circuit component  103, and, in this exemplary case, the sensitive direction is perpendicular to the I/O pads arranged proximal to the bottom edge.  Also see Figure 7.  As described<br>
above, the sensitive direction of the vertical sensor circuit component need not be along the Z axis.  Further, a vertical sensor circuit component can be sensitive to forces along more than one axis.  In this method, the ma   gnetic sensor circuit component mounted vertically 103 is attached to and supported by the magnetic field sensing circuit component mounted horizontally  102,  204.  The vertically   -mounted magnetic sensing circuit component     103 can be non    -concluctivcly connected to the one or more magnetic field sensing circuit components  102,  204 with an adhesive, preferably non conductive epoxy.,<br>
[0041]  In some embodiments, the one or more magnetic field sensing circuit components are horizontal sensor circuit components (i.e., 2 -dimensional sensors sensitive to forces along any two of the X, Y and/or Z axes), while in other embodiments are one or more horizontal, 1  -dimensional sensoi-circuit components, sensitive to forces along one axis.  The vertical magnetic sensing circuit com    ponent can be non conductively connected to the magnetic field sensing circuit component, and the non  -conductive connection can be formed with an adhesive, such as non-conductive epoxy,<br>
[0042]  In addition, the"vertically-mounted magnetic sensing circuit component 103 can comprise I/O pads on its first face and the one or more magnetic field sensing circuit components 102, 204 comprise I/O pads on," for example, their top face, and the vertical magnetic sensing circuit component and the one or more magnetic field se nsing circuit components can be conductively connected by the I/O pads.  See also Figure 6.<br>
The conductive connection between the vertical magnetic sensing circuit component and the one or more magnetic field sensing circuit components can be formed by, f or example, wire bonding, flip chip, solder  bumping, stud bumping, conductive epoxy, and flexible interconnect bonding, e.g., tape automated bonding (TAB), techniques.<br>
[0043]  In preferred embodiments of the above aspects of the invention, the vertical sensor ci rcuit component 103 is low -profile, i.e., equal to or less than about 1.1 mm in height. Further, the figures represent exemplary embodiments and do not limit the vertical die chip     -on-board sensor package methods and sensor packages of the invention to mag      netic sensors.  Another sensor type that can be substituted for the magnetic sensors in the figures can be, for example, tilt sensors or any other sensor that can be utilized with PCB processes and are of a small size, preferably about or less than 1.1 mm  in height. The vertical die chip -on-board sensor packages of the invention and the methods of making said vertical die chips-on-board sensor packages can be included in electronic devices, including portable and hand held devices, such as cell phones..<br>
[0044]  More generally speaking, a magnetic field can be characterised as a vector quantity that has both magnitude and direction. Magnetic sensors measure this quantity in various ways.  Some magnetometers measure total magnitude but not direction of the field (sea lar sensors).  Others measure the magnitude of the component of magnetization, which is along their sensitive axis (omni i-<br>
sensors).  Vector magnetic sensors can have 2 or 3 b directional sensors.  Some magnetic sensors have a built in threshold and produce an output only when that threshold is passed-  While the types of magnetic sensors that can be utilized in the present invention include older techniques including reed swi tches, variable reluctance sensors, flux gate magnetometers, magneto   -inductive sensors, and Hall devices, the relatively new solid    -state sensors such as Anisotropic Magnetoresistive (AMR) Sensors are preferred due to their adaptability to PCB processes and   small size.  The present invention relates vertical die chip   -on-board sensor packages made with any combination of the sensors mentioned above, and preferably AMR sensors.  Said sensor packages utilize the vertical die chip    -on-board methods described herein in their manufacture.<br>
[0045]  The Earth's magnetic field can be exploited to determine, for example, compass headings for navigation and yaw rate (by measuring the derivative of the change in field). AMR sensors provide an excellent means of measuring both linear and angular position and displacement in the Earth's magnetic field as they can sense DC static fields as well as the strength and direction of the field. AMR sensors are generally made of a nickel     -iron (Permalloy) thin film deposited on a silicon w  afer and patterned as a resistive strip.  The properties of the AMR thin film cause it to change resistance by about 2 -3% in the presence of a magnetic field. Typically, four of these resistors are connected in a Wheatstone bridge configuration so that bo   th magnitude and direction of a field along a single axis can be measured.  For<br>
typical AMR sensors, the bandwidth is in the 1   -5 MHz range. The reaction of the magnetoresistive effect is fast and not limited by coils or oscillating frequencies.  Other ben  efits of AMR sensors are that they are of low cost, high sensitivity, small size, high reliability, possess significant noise immunity, and they can be bulk manufactured on silicon wafers and mounted in commercial integrated circuit packages. This allows magnetic sensors to be auto -assembled with other circuit and systems components.  AMR sensors are available from, for example, Honeywell.<br>
[0046]  The present invention also relates to the utilisation of additional types of sensor (other than magnetic sensors) with the vertical die chip  -on board sensor package methods of the invention to produce vertical die chip -on-board sensor packages of various functions.  As an example, tilt sensors can be used in conjunction with magnetic sensors to provide navigation and vehicle attitude information.  Aircraft convention defines the attitude parameters in terms of three angles: heading, pitch and roll.  These angles are referenced to the local horizontal plane.  That is, the plane perpendicular to the earth's gravitational vector.  Heading is defined as the angle in the local horizontal plane measured clockwise from true North (earth's polar axis).  Pitch is defined as the angle between the aircraft's longitudinal axis and the local horizontal plane (positive for nose up).  Rol  1 ia defined as the angle about the longitudinal axis between the local horizontal plane and the actual flight orientation (positive for right wing down).  Methods of determining<br>
"""heading, pitch and. roll from tilt sensor output are well known in the art -<br>
[0047]  Common tilt measuring devices include accelerorneters, electrolytic (fluid) based tilt sensors, and gimbaled mechanical structures.  Another method to determine the local horizontal plane is to use a gyroscope to maintain a known inertial reference orienta  tion at all times.  Tilt sensors that can be adapted for use with PCB processes and can be of small size, for example accelerometers and electrolytic sensors, are preferred tilt sensors.  Said tilt sensors can be mounted to a PCB according to the invention.<br>
[0043]  Low cost tilt sensors like the two-axis electrolytic and dual axis accelerometer measure the roll and pitch angle directly.  Liquid filled electrolytic tilt sensors, resembling a glass "thimble", use electrodes to monitor the fluid movement as the sen    sor changes angles.  Solid      -state accelerometer tilt sensors measure the Earth's gravitational field by means of an electromechanical circuit.  These sensors are similar in that they have two single axis components that measure the angle deviations from the  local horizontal plane. Signal conditioning circuits are used to create an output signal proportional to the angle of tilt.  These sensor types are considered strapdown devices since they have no moving or pendulous parts.  If a strapdown compass is requ ired to output heading for any orientation then, as a minimum, a compass system must have a three -axis magnetic sensor and a two -axis tilt.  The heading calculation relies on all three magnetic components (X,Y,Z) so the compass orientation can be mathematically rotated to the horizontal plane.  Then, the Xh<br>
and Yh (the horizontal components of the Earth's magnetic field) components can be calculated to determine the heading value.<br>
[0049]Therefore, the present invention fills a need for mounting sensors orthogonal ly to other sensors mounted in the plane of a printed circuit board, said orthogonally mounted sensors measuring forces or magnetic fields on the Z -axis.  In particular, the instant invention provides methods for mounting orthogonal sensors in a low profil  e manner in, for example, cell phone and other consumer and commercial applications, which methods are cost sensitive, high volume, and easily adaptable to common PCB assembly processes.<br>
