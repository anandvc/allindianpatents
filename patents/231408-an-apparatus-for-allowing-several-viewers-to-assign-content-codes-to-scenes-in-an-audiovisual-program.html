				<td>AN APPARATUS FOR ALLOWING SEVERAL<br>
VIEWERS TO ASSIGN CONTENT CODES TO<br>
SCENES IN AN AUDIOVISUAL PROGRAM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A.	Field of Invention<br>
This invention elates to an apparatus for allowing several viewers to<br>
assign content codes to scenes in an audiovisual program, such as analog or<br>
digital motion pictures that are transmitted over cable, or video transmitted<br>
over the internet. More particularly, it pertains to an apparatus for tagging<br>
induvidual scenes of the audiovisual program by several people so that it can<br>
be replayed with selected scenes being omitted or replaced by others.<br>
B.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Presently, many video programs have ratings that can be used by<br>
viewers to determine whether they would like to play the programs, or whether<br>
they would allow others (such as children or adolescents) to play them.<br>
These types of ratings are also becoming available for TV shows, games, and<br>
other audiovisual programs. Programs broadcast over the Internet may be<br><br>
filtered or otherwise restricted using on-line filtering services, and set-top<br>
boxes and TVs with V-CHIP content filtering technology also exist for this<br>
purpose.<br>
As an improvement to current technology, it has been suggested that<br>
rating codes be provided for individual segments, or scenes, of programs.<br>
Automated playing devices would then be able to seamlessly eliminate<br>
segments with objectionable content, and/or substitute other segments with<br>
acceptable content if such segments are available. Commonly assigned co-<br>
pending application S.N. 09/479,819 filed January 7, 2000, entitled "Content<br>
Control of Broadcast Programs" and incorporated herein by reference,<br>
discloses a personalvideo recorder that receives and stores a broadcast<br>
program with each scene being tagged with a content rating. A viewer<br>
designates parameters for acceptability of content, and the appropriate<br>
scenes are played as a seamless continuous program. U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,987,211 and 6,208,805 to Abecassis discloses an apparatus that records a<br>
program on a disk and filters content according to viewer preferences. A<br>
viewer is shown only the segments having acceptable content. A parent has<br>
the ability to review a program and tag unacceptable scenes. The apparatus<br>
then omits the unacceptable scenes when the program is played.<br>
A major disadvantage of all of these systems is that, whether a<br>
universal rating is assigned to a whole program, or ratings are assigned to<br>
each of a program's individual scenes, the ratings still reflect a limited number<br>
of categories accepted by the public at large, industry-wide guidelines or the<br>
opinions of an editor. Thus, they fail to reflect inherent differences in the<br><br>
filtering categories of individual customers due to many factors such as<br>
geographic location, level of education, income, religious and moral beliefs,<br>
etc., factors that meaningfully affect a person's views and preferences for<br>
what kind of programs and content they, or their children, should view.<br>
A further disadvantage of prior art systems is that typically a single<br>
person provides the content codes. Therefore, the content codes selected by<br>
that one person reflects his/her scene characterizations that may or may not<br>
match the characterizations of others. What may be a "violent" scene to one<br>
person may not be such a scene to another.<br>
OBJECTIVES AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is believed to be beneficial to allow a group of viewers to tag<br>
programs based on composite characterizations of scenes.<br>
Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide an<br>
apparatus that permits viewing of scenes of a program, and the tagging of<br>
scenes by a group of viewers with content codes that can be used later for<br>
discriminating purposes.<br>
A further objective is to provide an apparatus that is user-friendly and<br>
easy to operate.<br>
A further objective is to provide an apparatus in which a program's<br>
scenes can be designated by the program provider, automatically detected, or<br>
designated by a viewer.<br>
Briefly, viewers display a program on an audiovisual monitoring station<br>
system. The apparatus for assigning content codes to the program's scenes<br><br>
constructed in accordance with this invention includes a scene detector<br>
identifying the individual scenes of a program. The scene detector, in one<br>
embodiment, detects scene changes by analyzing the characteristics of<br>
sequential frames using known techniques. In another embodiment, the<br>
program itself includes codes that identify its scenes. In a third embodiment,<br>
the scene detector responds to a scene selector that is viewer activated.<br>
Also included in this invention is a scene indicator, which may be in the<br>
form of a visual or audible signal, and which indicates the beginning of a new<br>
scene. Viewers in a group are prompted by the scene indicator to enter<br>
respective individual content codes for the new scene. This content code is<br>
determined by the viewers based on the visual as well as the audio content of<br>
the respective scene. Once the individual content codes are entered by all the<br>
viewers, the scene indicator is deactivated until the detection of the next<br>
scene. Alternately, the scene indicator may be activated only for a brief<br>
period of time. A timer may also be provided to indicate the time left until the<br>
end of the scene (if known), if a viewer enters no content code by the end of<br>
the scene, a default value is automatically assigned for that scene for that<br>
viewer. The default value may be the individual content code for the<br>
immediately preceding scene.<br>
A code selector is also included in the apparatus for each viewer. This<br>
code selector is adapted to receive the individual content codes for a scene.<br>
An algorithm is used to determine a final content code based on the individual<br>
content codes. For example, the content code representing the most<br>
objectionable content may be selected as the final content code.<br><br>
Alternatively, a straight arithmetic or weighted averaging method may be used<br>
to determine the final content code (where the codes are ranked in a<br>
predetermined order). This voting approach allows a committee of parents,<br>
for example, to code a program for a class of students in the least<br>
objectionable way, based on both the visual and audio contents of each<br>
scene. Of course content codes may be designated based on a variety of<br>
criteria independently of whether a scene may be objectionable or not.<br>
For each scene, a two-component code (two record fields) is<br>
generated which includes the final content code and an identification of the<br>
scene. The scene identification may be generated by a timer that times the<br>
duration of each scene as well as previous scenes and then generates a<br>
starting and ending time for the scene.<br>
The apparatus also includes a memory for storing the codes for all the<br>
scenes including the assigned content codes and scene identifications.<br>
The apparatus further includes a controller adapted to selectively<br>
activate the scene indicator and generally manage the generation and storage<br>
of the scene codes.<br>
In this manner several viewers can view a program simultaneously and<br>
select the content codes for each scene, as described. Alternatively, the<br>
viewers can view the program separately and independently of each other.<br>
The individual content codes are logged and the final content codes are<br>
determined any time after the last viewer has made his selections.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An apparatus for generating a content code by a single viewer is<br>
described in the above-identified co-pending patent application S.N.<br>
 In order to provide a better understanding of the present invention,<br>
this apparatus is first described herein in conjunction with Figs. 1-3. The<br>
apparatus 10, as shown in Fig. 1 includes a device such as a program player<br>
12 that is adapted to play an audiovisual program on an audiovisual<br>
monitoring system 14. The program could be recorded on a DVD disk, a VCR<br>
tape or other similar media, or in a personal video recorder receiving the<br>
program from a program source 16, e.g. through a cable, XDSL, or satellite<br>
connector.<br>
Associated with the player 12 are a scene detector 18 and a program<br><br>
timer 20. The scene detector 18 is used to detect scenes in the program<br>
signal generated by player 12. The program timer 20 generates a count that<br>
can be used to provide unique identifications for the scenes of the program.<br>
Instead of the timer, other scene identification means may be used, such as a<br>
frame counter.<br>
A controller 22 directs the operation of the apparatus 10. The controller<br>
22 is coupled to the scene detector 18 and timer 20, and it is also associated<br>
with a code selector 24, a scene indicator 26, scene timer 27 and a memory<br>
28. It should be understood that all the elements in Fig. 1 can be<br>
implemented as a microprocessor-based device such as a PC, or can be<br>
incorporated into thrprogram player 12 (especially if the player is a personal<br>
video recorder). However the apparatus 10 is shown in Fig. 1 as having<br>
discrete components for the sake of clarity.<br>
In the present invention, the apparatus of Fig. 1 is modified to allow<br>
several viewers to provide content codes for each scene of a program. The<br>
modified apparatus 10A is shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen in this Figure, the<br>
apparatus 10A differs from the apparatus 10 in Fig. 1 in that it is provided with<br>
several code selectors, such 24A-24D." (Fig. 2 shows four selectors; however,<br>
any number of selectors may be used.). Therefore, with this apparatus<br>
several viewers decide the code that is to be assigned to each scene based<br>
on its audio and visual contents. Each viewer operates one of the selectors.<br>
Details of one of the code selectors 24A are shown in Fig. 3. The<br>
code selector 24A consists of a housing 30 that supports a plurality of<br>
switches 32. 34, 36 and 38. Each of the switches may be labeled with a<br><br>
content code, for example G, PG, R or X. (More precise content codes may<br>
be used, giving rise to more than just four switches. For example, content<br>
codes may be provided which describe more accurately the contents of the<br>
scenes, in terms of the amount or degree of sex, violence, nudity, profanity,<br>
etc.) Each of the switches 32-38 may be a momentary pushbutton switch.<br>
The scene indicator 26 may be positioned on the housing 30 as well.<br>
The apparatus of Figs. 2 and 3 operates as indicated by the flow chart<br>
of Fig. 4. In step 100 the program player is activated to start playing a<br>
program on audiovisual monitoring system 14. The program timer 20 is<br>
activated as well. The monitoring system 14 is arranged to allow all the<br>
viewers to see and hear the program.<br>
As the program is shown to the viewers, the frames forming the<br>
program are monitored by scene detector 18 to detect the start of scenes that<br>
comprise the program. Scene detectors of this kind are we'll known in the art.<br>
When the first scene is detected (step 102), the controller 22 logs its starting<br>
time as indicated by program timer 20 (step 104).<br>
Next, the scene indicators 26 are activated on each code selector 24A-<br>
24D (step 106). Each scene indicator 26 may be a simple light that is turned<br>
on or a beeper that is activated. The scene indicators 26 are activated to<br>
prompt each viewer for a content code, using the respective code selector<br>
24A-24D.<br>
In some instances, the scene detector 18 may be too sensitive for the<br>
purposes of the present invention. More particularly, the scene detector may<br>
designate every camera angle change as a new scene. Therefore, it may be<br><br>
advisable to have one of the viewers determine the start and end time of each<br>
scene. For this purpose, one of the code selectors, for example, the code<br>
selector 24A of Fig. 3, may include a manual scene selector 40. The manual<br>
scene selector 40 may be a momentary pushbutton like switches 32-38.<br>
When this manual scene selector 40 is provided, the scene detector 18 can<br>
be turned off or omitted.<br>
In such an embodiment, after the program starts, the viewer associated<br>
with code selector 24A selects the start time of a scene by activating the<br>
manual scene selector 40. When the manual scene selector 40 is activated,<br>
the scene indicators 26 for each code selector 24A-24D are also activated,<br>
thereby indicating that the current scene has not yet been assigned a content<br>
code by the respective viewers. The start time is also logged.<br>
As discussed above, as each scene is displayed on audiovisual<br>
monitoring system 14 with audio heard through associated speakers (not<br>
shown), the scene indicators 26 are activated. As the viewers view and listen<br>
to the current scene they each make a determination of what its content code<br>
shouid be. They then designate for the scene their selected content code by<br>
activating the appropriate switch 32-38. (It is possible to activate multiple<br>
switches if the system accommodates multiple content codes for a scene.) As<br>
each viewer selects his or her individual content code, the scene indicator on<br>
the respective code selector 24A-24D is turned off. (Alternatively, If the scene<br>
indicator 26 is a beeper, it may emit a different sound than when it was<br>
activated in step 106). In an alternative embodiment, the scene indictor26<br>
may be turned on or activated only for a brief period (e.g., three - ten<br><br>
seconds). In this embodiment, the scene indictor 26 is deactivated<br>
independently of the selection of a content code by the viewer. The individual<br>
content codes are stored in memory 28.<br>
Returning to Fig. 4, in step 108 the controller 22 checks if all the<br>
viewers have selected individual content codes. If content codes have been<br>
selected by all viewers, then in step 110 the final content code is determined<br>
from the individual content codes using a predetermined algorithm as<br>
described above. This final content code is then logged together with a<br>
corresponding scene identification, e.g., its starting time code.<br>
In step 112 the controller 22 checks the scene detector 18 for a new<br>
scene. When a new scene is detected, the controller 22 logs the end (e.g.,<br>
another time code) of the last scene (step 114).<br>
Next, in step 116 scene indicia, including the appropriate final content<br>
code(s) and the corresponding scene identification data, are stored in scene<br>
content code memory 28.<br>
In step 118 a test is performed to determine if the end of the program<br>
has been reached. If the program end has not been reached, then the start<br>
time of the new scene is logged in step 104 and the new scene is processed<br>
as discussed above.<br>
In step 118 if the program end is detected, then in step 120 all the<br>
scene indicia are recorded in a specific file that may be left in memory 28,<br>
stored on the medium which itself contains the program, or somewhere else.<br>
Back at step 108, if a content code has not been selected yet for the<br>
current scene by at least one of the viewers, then in step 122 the controller 22<br><br>
checks the scene detector 18 for a new scene. If a new scene is not<br>
detected, then the system 22 goes back to step 108. If a new scene is<br>
detected in step 122, then in step 124 a default value is assigned for the<br>
individual content code of the respective viewer(s). For example, the default<br>
code may be the code assigned by the respective viewer to the previous<br>
scene.<br>
In step 126 the end of the scene being processed is logged and the<br>
process continues with step 116.<br>
The apparatus 10 can be modified for other types of operation as well.<br>
In one embodiment the scenes may be already defined by a specific code<br>
embedded within the program itself. In this case, instead of a scene detector,<br>
a decoder detects the beginning and end of each scene. This alternative is<br>
indicated in Fig. 1 for element 18.<br>
If the beginning and end points of a scene (and therefore its duration)<br>
are known, then, at the beginning of each scene, a scene timer 27 may also<br>
be activated. This scene timer 27 can be configured to count down and<br>
indicate to a viewer how much time is left to the end of the scene (i.e., the<br>
time left before the viewer has to select a code).<br>
Instead of using an automatic or even manually operated scene<br>
detector, it is possible simply to allow the viewers to enter content codes at<br>
any time. Any change in content codes would in effect signal a new scene.<br>
The advantage of identifying the start of a real scene, however, is that the<br>
entered content codes are retroactive to the start of the scene. On replay, an<br>
appropriate player could curtail viewing of an objectionable scene from its<br><br>
start, not just from when the content codes were entered.<br>
This voting approach allows a committee of parents, for example, to-<br>
code a program for a class of students in the least objectionable way.<br>
Instead of designating whether scenes contain objectionable materials,<br>
content codes can be selected based on various other criteria. For example,<br>
all the scenes of a documentary program may be selected if they show<br>
animals.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, even the apparatus of Fig. 1<br>
with only one call selector can be used to obtain a group consensus. The<br>
viewers use the same apparatus individually, at different times. As shown in<br>
Fig. 5 for this mode of operation, each viewer selects an individual content<br>
code which is logged in the same manner as described above. Thus steps<br>
200-226 are similar to corresponding steps 100-126 of Fig. 4. However, in<br>
this embodiment after the program is completely played for one viewer and<br>
the scene indicia are recorded (step 220), a check is performed in step 228 to<br>
determine if the viewer who has just coded the program is the last viewer.<br>
This check may be accomplished in a number of different ways. For example,<br>
when the program is played the first time, the controller 22 can be provided<br>
with the number of viewers that will review the program. Alternatively, a<br>
special control signal may be provided to the controller 22 when the last<br>
viewer has coded the program.<br>
Next, in step 230 the final content code for each scene is determined<br>
based on the individual content codes. In step 232, the final content codes<br>
are then stored.<br><br>
By generating a content code for each scene of a program, a table is<br>
created which associates each scene with its content code and the address of<br>
the next scene. This table may be stored separately or may be attached to<br>
the program itself. The table can be used to control the manner in which the<br>
program is played. For example, co-pending commonly assigned U.S.<br>
application S.N. 09/479,819 filed January 7, 2000, entitled CONTENT<br>
CONTROL OF BROADCAST PROGRAMS and incorporated herein by<br>
reference discloses a method and apparatus wherein a program is broadcast<br>
together with its table to a customer with an appropriately configured personal<br>
video recorder. The customer selects an acceptable content code. The<br>
personal video recorder then can record and play only the scenes that have a<br>
predetermined content code, while skipping the scenes with other codes.<br>
Since the table with the content codes is received in advance, the personal<br>
recorder can determine the scenes that are to be skipped, and the duration of<br>
these skipped scenes. The recorder therefore can delay playing the program<br>
by the duration of the skipped scenes so that the program can be played<br>
without interruption.<br>
Another advantage of providing a program with a table of scene-<br>
associated content codes is that it allows a content provider to create a<br>
program with several interchangeable scenes, each scene having a unique<br>
content code. A customer may then elect to get a program with all the<br>
scenes. Alternatively, a customer may elect to a version of the program with<br>
all the scenes having a predetermined content code or codes.<br><br>
Obviously, numerous other modifications can be made to this invention<br>
without departing from its scope, as defined in the appended claims.<br><br>
