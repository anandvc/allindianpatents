				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved rubber-<br>
covered conveyor belt consuming reduced energy for driving the<br>
same.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to a conveyor<br>
belt, termed 'Energy Optimised Belt (BOB), in which the<br>
composition of the rubber compound used in the cover thereof has<br>
been optimised to reduce the viscous component of the strain<br>
produced the rein, when stressed dynamically by the driving force<br>
applied thereto for conveying loads over carrier or idler rollers<br>
as well as when the materials to be conveyed are loaded thereon.<br>
A rubber-covered conveyor belt is made of three main<br>
components, namely, (i) reinforcing material, (ii) rubber compound<br>
to cover the reinforcing material both on the top and bottom<br>
surfaces thereof and (iii) interfacing compound applied on the<br>
reinforcing material before covering the same with the rubber<br>
compound.<br>
The reinforcing material comprises usually plies of<br>
woven fabrics or steel cords laid parallelly along the length<br>
and sometimes also along the width of the belt.<br>
The rubber compound used to cover the reinforcing<br>
material both on the top and bottom sides thereof is selected to be<br>
of visco-elastic properties required for preventing deformation and<br>
abrasion of the cover of the belt in conveying heavy loads over<br>
idler rollers continuously over a long period.<br>
The interfacing compound is selected to form an adequate<br>
bond between the reinforcing material and the rubber compound<br>
applied thereon to form the top and bottom covers of the belt.<br><br>
The conveyor bait produced according to the present<br>
Invention comprises known reinforcing material and the interfacing<br>
compound as used in tbe existing conveyor belts, and a rubber<br>
compound for covering the reinforcing material, of visoo-elastlc<br>
properties optimised for reducing the energy consumption in<br>
driving the loaded conveyor belt over idler rollers and reducing<br>
also the abrasion of the belt bottom cover caused thereby.<br>
The optimisation of the visco-elastlc properties of the<br>
rubber compound used to form the bottom cover of the conveyor<br>
belt according to the Invention comprises modification of the<br>
composition of ingredients of compound and also the method of<br>
mixing the ingredients.<br>
The object of the invention is to reduce the oonsumptioi<br>
of electrical energy required for driving a loaded conveyor belt<br>
over idler rollers.<br>
The other object Is to lover the frictlonal resistance<br>
between the surfaces of the belt bottom cover and the idler rolle<br>
over which the belt is drawn, and to reduce thereby the wear and<br>
tear of the belt bottom cover surface during use of the belt.<br>
Thus the invention provides an improved rubber-covered<br>
conveyor belt consuming reduced energy for driving the same,<br>
comprising: (a) known reinforcing materials, such as woven fabric<br>
or parallelly disposed steel cords along the belt length and<br>
optionally also along the belt width, (b) known interfacing<br>
compound applied on the reinforcing material and (c) rubber<br>
compound for covering the reinforcing material to form bottom<br>
cover of the belt, characterised in that the rubber compound Is<br>
composed of ingredients (in parts by weight): ISNR-100.0,<br><br>
ZnO - 4.0, SA - 2.0, N375 - 20.0, H220 - 20.0, 6PPD - 1.5,<br>
HS - 1.5, Silica - 10.0, process oil - 2.0, Si69 - 3.0, BSM - 1.5<br>
and S - 1.8.<br>
The invention provides also a method of producing an<br>
improved rubber-covered conveyor belt consuming reduced energy<br>
for driving the same, comprising the steps; (a) laying known<br>
woven fabrics or steel cords parallelly along the belt length,<br>
and optionally laying the known steel cards parallelly also along<br>
the belt width, as reinforcing material, (b) applying a known intc<br>
facing compound on the reinforcing material, (c) mixing the<br>
ingredients of a rubber compound such as herein described, (d)<br>
covering the reinforcing material with rubber compound to form<br>
bottom cover of the belt, characterised in that the ingredients<br>
of the rubber compound are mixed at a temperature of 160 - 165°C<br>
for a cycling time of 6.5 min in the first stage, and at a<br>
temperature of 80 - 95°C for a cycling stime of 4.0 min in the<br>
second stage.<br>
The invention is described in further detail, without<br>
restricting the scope of the invention in any manner, with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which -<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a conveyor belt in the normal flat<br>
profile during use;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a conveyor belt in •pipe1 profile<br>
during use;<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a conveyor belt in 'trough1 profi]<br>
during use; and<br><br>
Figure 4 is a sketch of an apparatus used for testing<br>
frictional resistance between belt bottom cover and an idler<br>
roller.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a conveyor belt (3) in its normal<br>
flat profile, supported on truss (1), is in top-run position<br>
(1A) and in bottom-run position (1B), conveying materials (2)<br>
over idler rollers (4).<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the conveyor belt (3) is turned<br>
to be in pipe profile both in top-run and bottom-run at positions<br>
(3A); material to be conveyed in the upward top-run is loaded at<br>
position (10) and discharged at position (5); and in the downward<br>
bottom-run the material to be conveyed is loaded at position (6)<br>
and discharged at position (8). The conveyor belt may be<br>
rotated at positions (7, 9) in the downward bottom-run, if it<br>
is necessary to maintain the overlap on top in case material is<br>
also conveyed on the return run. If not, the overlap can be at<br>
the bottom and in such case no belt turnover at positions (7, 9)<br>
is required.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, the conveyor belt (3) in trough<br>
profile is drawn over sets of three idler rollers corresponding<br>
to stations (11, 12, 13).<br>
The conveyor belt is subjected to a varying stress<br>
when loaded with the materials to be carried and also when<br>
drawn over idler rollers against the frictional resistance<br>
between the belt bottom surface and the roller surface. The<br>
strain produced in the rubber cover of a conveyor belt by a<br>
sinusoldally varying stress has an elastic component occurring<br>
in phase with the stress and a viscous component occurring in<br>
90° lagging phase. So the rigidity modulus (E) of the rubber<br>
cover of a conveyor belt has also an elastic component (E)<br>
in phase with the stress and a viscous component (E") in 90°<br>
lagging phase, (E) being given by B <br>
angle ( S) between (E) and (E) being<br><br>
given by tan £ - E"/E which is a measure of the energy<br>
consumed in driving the loaded conveyor belt over idler rollers.<br>
In the present invention the value of tan has been<br>
reduced by optimising the composition of the ingredients of<br>
rubber compound used to cover the reinforcing material of the<br>
conveyor belt and by optimising the method followed for mixing<br>
the ingredients in producing the rubber compound*<br>
Detailed Investigations have been conducted for optlmisin<br>
the composition of the ingredients of the rubber compound used fox<br>
covering the reinforcing material of the invented conveyor belt,<br>
and also for optimising the method of mixing the Ingredients in<br>
producing the rubber compound to reduce the tan © value i.e.<br>
the ratio of viscous modulus (E") to elastic modulus (E') of the<br>
rubber compound used to form the bottom cover of the invented<br>
conveyor belt.<br>
The optimised composition of the Ingredients of the<br>
rubber compound of the invented conveyor belt and that of the<br>
existing conveyor belt are presented in Table I.<br>
The optimised method of mixing Ingredients of the rubbe<br>
compound of the invented conveyor belt and that of the rubber<br>
compound used In the existing conveyor belt are sett out in<br>
Table II.<br>
The consumption of electrical energy in conveying over<br>
150,000 tonne of material in an industry has been studied using<br>
bo th the existing and Invented conveyor belts. The data obtainec<br>
are presented in Table III. It is noted that 5.0% saving in<br>
consumption of electrical energy has been achieved by using the<br>
invented conveyor belt, which is appreciable for the economy of<br><br>
the industry consuming thousands of units of electrical energy<br>
annually for conveying materials over belts. This saving has<br>
been observed in a short length conveyor where the energy<br>
consumption at the two terminal points of a conveyor is very<br>
high compared to the total. For longer, conveyors, therefore<br>
the energy savings would be higher.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, in the apparatus used for testing<br>
frictional resistance between an idler roller (R) and bottom<br>
rubber cover (C) of a sample of conveyor belt (B) spread on foam<br>
sheet (S) which is laid on a table top (T), the idler roller (R)<br>
is rotatably held on the bottom cover (C) of belt (B) and loaded<br>
downwardly with a total load of (N) (including the weight of the<br>
roller) to produce a sag of angle (B) with the horizontal surface<br>
of table top (T) caused by depression produced in the foam sheet<br>
(S) under the weight of the loaded idler roller (R). A force (F)<br>
is applied in the horizontal direction to drag the rot a table idle,1<br>
roller (R) over the surface of the bottom cover (C).<br>
The coefficient of frictional resistance between the<br>
surfaces of idler roller (R) and bottom rubber cover (C) of the<br>
belt sample (B), expressed by F/N, is determined with a sag<br>
produced in the belt. The test is repeated without the foam<br>
sheet (S) interposed between the belt sample (B) and table top<br>
(T) to determine the coefficient of frictional resistance between<br>
the surface of idler roller (R) and bottom rubber cover (C) of<br>
the belt sample (B) without a sag produced in the belt.<br><br>
The results of test obtained on the existing and<br>
invented conveyor belts are presented in Table IV. It is<br>
noted that the frictional resistance of the bottom cover of<br>
invented conveyor belt is reduced by 250% when drawn over<br>
an idler roller without producing any sag in the belt and by<br>
13.7% when drawn over an idler roller with a sag in the belt,<br>
in comparision with an existing conveyor bel t. A corresponding<br>
reduction in the wear and tear of the bottom cover surface of<br>
the invented conveyor belt compared with that of the existing<br>
conveyor belt is expected to be attained in application of the<br>
belt in an industry.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
