				<td>Support-coloring means<br>
A subject-matter of the present invention is means, products and a process for the coloring of supports which are inorganic or organic materials, in particular living materials, such as the skin.<br>
It is known to print supports, such as paper and fabrics, using inks. This type of technique is currently used by the Applicant Company for carrying out the coloring of supports starting from the three primary colors (yellow, cyan and magenta) supplied by inks, black being obtained using a black ink and white being given by the support itself. The support to be colored is wound off, for example as a sheet, through a printer which distributes, point by point, drops of ink of a few nanoliters according to a prefigured design, advantageously by computer. However, the arm which distributes the inks has to pass the same spot several times in order to obtain the desired intensity, which takes up time.<br>
Furthermore, some chemical inks are regarded as polluting to the environment.<br>
Techniques based on the use of enzymes have also been reported. Thus, patent EP 1 342 831 discloses a process for the coloring of fabrics by the enzymatic route which comprises the dipping of the fabric in an aqueous solution comprising one or more aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds, followed by the dipping of the dipped material in an aqueous solution with a source of hydrogen peroxide and an enzyme exhibiting a peroxidase activity or with an enzyme exhibiting an oxidase activity with regard to said aromatic or heteroaromatic compound(s).<br>
In this process, no control exists of the components<br><br>
fixed during the various dippings of the samples and very particularly of the oxidation catalyst. The latter is bound only by absorption and can thus be removed during washing operations. Furthermore, the colors obtained are not the primary colors.<br>
The inventors have found that these problems could be overcome by replacing these inks and these enzymes by photoactivatable catalytic systems capable of generating the three primary colors, the combination of which can result in colored compounds.<br>
An aim of the invention is thus to provide such systems and a process for the generation of color on a support based on their use, in which the colors are displayed on said support only at the desired moment and at the desired spot.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is based on a process for coloring a support in which said support can be reused several times in order to generate other colors than those initially generated.<br>
The term "support" as used in the description and the claims denotes inorganic or organic materials, in particular living materials, such as the skin.<br>
The catalytic systems used according to the invention for the generation of colors on a support are characterized in that they comprise one or more inactivated oxidation catalysts.<br>
Mention will be made in particular of oxidases, such as peroxidases, laccases and hydrolases, such as alkaline phosphatases or acid phosphatases.<br>
Peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) presents itself as a particularly advantageous enzyme in view of its very<br><br>
low specificity with regard to substrates.<br>
Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) can also be used. Like peroxidase, it catalyzes oxidative coupling reactions using the same substrates.<br>
Alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) and acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2) are completely characterized but their substrates are more limited and more expensive than those of peroxidase, hemoglobin or laccase.<br>
Hemoglobin, in particular bovine hemoglobin, is capable of oxidizing peroxidase substrates: the crosslinking of hemoglobin, targeted at bringing about an amplification phenomenon, makes it possible to approach the performances of peroxidase.<br>
Advantageously, the substrates for these catalysts are numerous  and  are  available  at  low  costs.  Their oxidation produces  numerous  water-insoluble  colored compounds (Conyers and Kidwell (1991), Arial. Biochem. , 192, 207-211).<br>
Other oxidation catalysts comprise hemoglobins.<br>
Inactivation  of  these  catalysts  is  satisfactorily brought  about  by  attaching  photolabile  groups, preferably in their active site.<br>
Appropriate groups correspond to "nitrophenyl" substituents and comprise, for example, an o-nitro-benzyl or nitrophenyl group.<br>
Mention will be made, for example, of 4,5-dimethoxy-o-nitrobenzyl, o-nitrobenzyl-ethyl or o-nitrobenzyl.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the oxidation catalysts are associated with chromogenic substrates<br><br>
used in combination with aromatic compounds.<br>
The term "chromogenic substrate" is understood to mean compounds which operate reversibly with the catalysts and which are capable of resulting in a colored compound after oxidation by the catalyst and condensation with the aromatic compounds.<br>
Generally, the catalytic systems of the invention are systems capable of being photoreactivated and of regaining a sufficient oxidative activity to generate colors.<br>
The substrates described, for example, by Conyers and Kidwell (1991, cited above) are particularly appropriate for obtaining the three primary colors (cyan, magenta and yellow) as they rapidly give insoluble blue and red products precipitating in situ.<br>
Mention will in particular be made of 3-methyl-2-benzo-thiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH) and of phenylenediamine derivatives, such as dimethylphenylenediamine and diethylphenylenediamine.<br>
Mention will be made, as aromatic compounds which can be used to react with the oxidized chromogenic substrates and to result in a colored precipitate, of chloronaphthols, naphthalenediols, aminophenols, catechols, chlorophenols, phenol, guaiacol or any other molecule belonging either to the family of the mono-, di- or polycyclic aromatic compounds or to the family of the heteroaromatic derivatives.<br>
The invention is also targeted at a process for the generation of colors on a support, characterized in that it comprises the reactivation, under the effect of a light stimulus, of one or more inactivated oxidation catalysts as defined above impregnating said support.<br><br>
The oxidation catalysts are thus temporarily inactivated in order to make possible the implementation of the invention. Their reactivation will make it possible to generate colors at the desired spot at the desired moment.<br>
Preferably, this process comprises:<br>
a)	a stage of photoreversible inhibition of one or<br>
more oxidation catalysts impregnating a support,<br>
b)	a stage of immobilization on a support to be<br>
colored of the temporarily inactivated oxidation<br>
catalyst or catalysts as obtained on conclusion of<br>
stage  a),  said stage  of  immobilization being<br>
carried out in particular by dipping the support<br>
to  be  colored  in  a  solution  comprising  the<br>
inactivated oxidation catalyst or catalysts,<br>
c)	a stage of light stimulation of the impregnated<br>
support as obtained on conclusion of stage b)<br>
which  makes  it  possible  to  reactivate  the<br>
temporarily  inactivated  oxidation  catalyst  or<br>
catalysts,<br>
d)	a stage of impregnation of the support on which<br>
the oxidation catalyst or catalysts have been<br>
immobilized on conclusion of stage c)  with a<br>
solution  comprising  one  or  more  chromogenic<br>
substrates and one or more oxidizing agents, thus<br>
making it possible to develop the colors on the<br>
support  at  the  spot  activated  by  the  light<br>
stimulation.<br>
Stage a) is advantageously carried out by reacting the oxidation catalysts employed with compounds including photolabile groups as defined above. Compounds including o-nitrobenzyl groups are particularly advantageous in this regard. This is because these compounds can spontaneously attach by covalent bonding to amino acids, in particular active site, for example<br><br>
lysine, asparagine, glutamine or cysteine units. Use will thus advantageously be made, for attachment to lysines, of a compound such as 3,4-dimethoxy-o-nitro-benzyl chloroformate. The reaction can be carried out in an aqueous medium. For the reaction with units comprising a carboxyl functional group, for example aspartic or glutamic units, a diazoethane derivative is prepared from a hydrazonoethane derivative.<br>
Stage b) comprises the impregnation of a support with the catalyst in solution under conditions which make it possible to obtain the desired intensity for a color.<br>
The support is, for example, a fabric formed of natural fibers, in particular made of cotton, and/or of synthetic fibers, made of a polymeric material, such as a polyester. It can also be paper.<br>
The catalyst solution is advantageously an aqueous solution and includes amounts of catalyst of the order of 5 to 50 (jg/ml for HRP and of 50 to 200 jag/ml for Hb with a pH range of 4 to 6 approximately.<br>
Before stage b) of immobilization, a preliminary stage of impregnation of the support to be colored with a solution comprising one or more additives capable of bonding the oxidation catalyst or catalysts to the support to be colored is advantageously carried out.<br>
According to one embodiment of the process of the invention, when the support to be colored is a synthetic fabric, a preliminary stage of impregnation by alginate, in particular calcium alginate, is carried out: the presence of this acidic polysaccharide makes possible the immobilization of a large amount of oxidation catalyst on the fabric by covalent bonding after activation of the carboxyl functional groups to give NHS ester functional groups by the water-soluble<br><br>
carbodiimide [EDCI: N-ethyl-N' -(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide, N-cyclohexyl-N'-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate]/hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) pair.<br>
In the preliminary stage of impregnation, the alginate present at the surface of the fabric (1 cm2) is activated in water for 5 to 30 min by the EDC/NHS pair (200 |j,g/200) in a volume varying from 2 to 4 ml approximately.<br>
The activated fabric is immersed in a solution of oxidation catalyst at the concentrations specified previously, the solution being maintained at a pH of 6 to 7. The coupling time varies from 30 to 90 min approximately.<br>
According to another preferred arrangement of the invention, on conclusion of the preliminary stage of activation and of impregnation of the support to be colored with a solution comprising one or more additives, a drying stage is carried out. The drying is advantageously carried out under cold conditions in order not to damage the catalysts.<br>
The light stimulation necessary for the reactivation takes place at 366 nm for 5 to 30 min.<br>
For stage d), the support is impregnated with a solution including one or more chromogenic substrates, which are substrates for the catalyst, one or more aromatic compounds and one or more oxidizing agents.<br>
The concentrations of substrates vary from 1 to 4 mM and the concentrations of oxidizing agents are fixed at 1 mM; the concentrations of each of the members of the pair of substrates vary from 1 to 4 mM approximately. This mixture is produced in a buffered medium of 4.5 to<br><br>
6 approximately, at a temperature of 20 to 25°C approximately, until the coloring or colorings develop.<br>
The condensation of the oxidized substrates with the aromatic compounds results in the formation of colored compounds which precipitate in situ at the actual site of the conversion of the precursors (chromogenic substrates).<br>
In order for the support to be colored to remain colorless in the presence of the chromogenic substrates, it is necessary to obtain complete inhibition of the activity of the oxidation catalyst.<br>
The term "complete inhibition" is understood to mean an inhibition varying from approximately 80% to approximately 100% and preferably from approximately 90% to approximately 98%.<br>
The reactivation, even partial, of the oxidation catalyst by photolysis is sufficient to trigger the process for the generation of colors.<br>
The term "partial reactivation" is understood to mean a reactivation varying from approximately 10% to approximately 30% and preferably from approximately 20% to approximately 25%. Thus, a recovery after irradiation of the activity of the catalyst of the order of approximately 25% is sufficient to trigger the process for the generation of colors.<br>
Under the effect of a light stimulus, the photolabile groups are removed by photolysis while leaving the initial target (oxidation catalyst) chemically intact and biologically active. The oxidation catalyst obtained is partially reactivated.<br>
A  chemical  reaction  that  involves  the  aromatic<br><br>
substrate, the completely or partially reactivated oxidation catalyst, an oxidizing agent and the aromatic compound subsequently occurs and results in a colored product being obtained.<br>
There are several advantages to the process of the invention, in particular in comparison with a conventional coloring process using inks. This is because, according to the process of the invention, it is possible to obtain faster coloring of the supports than with point by point printing, a better resolution, the size of the pixel corresponding to the dimension of the immobilized oxidation catalyst, and the problems related to the blocking of ink dispensing heads.<br>
The invention is also targeted at a process in which said system is a flexible and transparent photoenzyma-tic film for locating in vivo emission "hot spots" of gamma photons in nuclear medicine. The development of a color stain on the film applied to the skin makes it possible, for example, to locate a point of pathological cell growth (for example, sentinel nodes for breast cancer) before a surgical treatment. This process advantageously makes it possible to be freed from the constraints imposed by the use of gamma scintigraphy cameras and to considerably reduce the involvement in routine operations of specialists in nuclear medicine.<br>
The invention is also targeted at a process as defined above in which the support is composed of macro-molecules, for example of cellophane, and carries a photoenzymatic system as described above. The face of the film in contact with the skin is grooved in order to act as collimator with regard to the gamma photons.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the invention which is of great interest, the invention is targeted at the<br><br>
application of the process for the generation of colors on the skin in cosmetics.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the examples which follow, which illustrate the generation of colors on a support made of cotton or of polyester.<br>
EXAMPLE 1; Use of hemoglobin<br>
1)   Photoreversible inhibition of hemoglobin<br>
Bovine hemoglobin in aqueous solution (32 (JM) is treated with different concentrations of l-(2-nitro-phenyl)ethyldiazoethane (NPE-diazo) in solution in DMSO at 20°C for 1 h in darkness. The final concentration of DMSO should not exceed 5%. The NPE-diazo concentrations vary from 50 to 100 equivalents with respect to the hemoglobin. The coupling reaction is halted by addition of a 100 mM acetate buffer solution at pH 4.4 (1 equivalent with respect to NPE-diazo). The contact times vary from 10 to 30 min. The reaction mixture is subsequently dialyzed against water, between 4 and 20°C, between 1 and 16 hours, against 1000 volumes of water. The conjugate is stored at 20°C.<br>
The percentage of inhibition of the oxidation of ABTS [diammonium salt of 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoli-none-6-sulfonic acid), 1 mM] is determined before dialysis on 96-well microtitration plates (Costar, Corning Incorporated) in sodium acetate buffer, 50 mM, pH 5, in the presence of 1 mM of hydrogen peroxide. The number of molecules attached per hemoglobin molecule is determined by mass spectrometry (electrospray). The results are collated in table 1.<br><br>
TABLE 1 (Table Remove)<br><br>
50, 75 and 100 corresponding to the number of NPE equivalents introduced into the reaction medium.<br>
The treatment of hemoglobin with NPE-diazo results in strong inhibition of the oxidative activity (greater than 90%).<br><br>
2)<br><br>
Photoreactivation of the oxidation catalyst<br><br>
The oxidation catalyst is reactivated by irradiation of the solutions of the various conjugates (1 mg/ml) in sodium acetate buffer (25 mM, pH 4.4). Photolysis takes place at 366 nm (100 W UV lamp, 7 mW/cm2 at a distance of 30 cm); the irradiation times vary from 5 to 30 min. This stage is advantageously carried out in the presence of 5 mM of 2-ethanolamine in order to trap possible cross reactions between photolysis products and hemoglobin.<br>
After irradiating for 30 minutes, deprotection of the hemoglobin is complete.<br>
The restoration of the enzymatic activity is determined in microtitration plates as described above in the presence of ABTS (1 mM) and H202 (1 mM) .<br>
After irradiating for 30 min, 57% of the activity is recovered for Hb-50, 28% for Hb-75 and 16% for Hb-100. These percentages of activity are sufficient to subse-<br><br>
quently trigger the process for the generation of the coloring.<br>
3)	Attachment of the enzymes to the support to be<br>
colored<br>
The oxidation catalyst, bovine hemoglobin, covalently attaches to the polyester fabrics preimpregnated with calcium alginate.<br>
The carboxyl functional groups of the polysaccharide are activated in water, in the presence of the EDC/NHS pair, for a period of time varying from 10 to 30 min. The amounts of carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide activators are, per 1 cm2 of fabric, 200 fag each in volumes varying from 2 to 4 ml. The fabric, thus activated, is immersed in a solution of oxidation catalyst at a concentration of 50 to 200 ^ig/ml at pH 6. The incubation time varies from 45 to 90 min.<br>
Under these conditions, the fabric is thus ready to be irradiated in order to reactivate the oxidation catalyst and is then impregnated with the solution comprising the pair(s) of homogeneous substrates.<br>
4)	Impregnation  by  the  pairs   of   chromogenic<br>
substrates and the oxidizing agent<br>
a)   Use of the DMPDA/4-chloronaphthol pair The fabric reactivated above is immersed in a solution, buffered between pH 4.5 and 6,  comprising dimethyl-phenylenediamine (mother solution prepared in water, 110 mM) and 4-chloronaphthol (mother solution prepared in ethanol,  110 mM) . Their final concentrations vary from 1 to 4 mM. The oxidizing agent, hydrogen peroxide, is added; its concentration is advantageously fixed at 1 mM. The reaction is carried out between 20 and 25°C until development of the blue color.<br><br>
b)	Use of the MBTH/4-chloronaphthol pair<br>
As described above in a), the reactivated fabric is immersed in a solution, buffered between pH 4.5 and 6, comprising 3-methylbenzothiazoline (MBTH, mother solution prepared in water, 110 mM) , 4-chloronaphthol and the oxidizing agent. The concentrations of the various entities and the operating conditions are the same as for a). In this case, the red color is generated.<br>
c)	Use of the MBTH/1,3-naphthalenediol pair<br>
As described above in a), the reactivated fabric is immersed in a solution, buffered between pH 4.5 and 6, comprising 3-methylbenzothiazoline (MBTH), 1,3-naphthalenediol (mother solution prepared in ethanol, 110 mM) and the oxidizing agent. The concentrations of the various entities and the operating conditions are the same as for a) . In this case, the yellow color is developed.<br><br>
