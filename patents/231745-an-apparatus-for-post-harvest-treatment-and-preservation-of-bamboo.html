				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an apparatus for post harvest treatment and preservation of<br>
bamboo.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The cheap cost of bamboo and its strength has made it efficient substitute for wood. It is<br>
widely used as a basic timber for low cost housing. In rural housing it is used as poles,<br>
purlins, trusses, rafters, mats for walls and ceilings, doors, windows and fence posts.<br>
Besides it is widely used in making of baskets, decorative items, bamboo mats, ladders,<br>
instruments, implements etc. It also finds large-scale use in pulp and paper industry and<br>
manufacture of bamboo mat-boards; ply boards, and corrugated sheets.<br>
Durability of bamboo is very short (1-36 months) due to its inherent characteristics. The<br>
presence of large amount of hemicellulose, starch and abundance of moisture makes is<br>
highly susceptible to biodegrading agents like white-rot, soft-rot, brown rot group of<br>
decay fungi and stain fungi and insects like borers and termites. A substantial amount of<br>
bamboo is destroyed due to these biological agents during use and storage in untreated<br>
condition.<br><br>
Post harvest preservative treatments have been found significantly effective in<br>
minimizing the loss caused by these biotic agents, in enhancing the durability of bamboo<br>
and its products and making bamboo available during lean period through safer storage.<br>
Durability of bamboo can be enhanced from 3 years to 30 years depending upon chemical<br>
preservative, bamboo species and end uses.<br>
Amongst the various known methods of bamboo treatment, Boucherie process is most<br>
preferred and widely used method for bamboo treatment.<br>
In this process the preservative is forced from one end of the sample to be treated under<br>
the hydrostatic pressure, generated by the gravitational force. The preservative solution<br>
takes over the space occupied by the plant sap after displacing it, which drips out of the<br>
butt end. When the preservative solution replaces the sap present in the timber completely<br>
the process is said to be complete.<br>
The apparatus for this process consisted a reservoir containing the water borne<br>
preservative, placed at a considerable height and connected by pipe to a system of outlets,<br>
placed at a low level. The sample under treatment is connected by rubber tubing/hosepipe<br>
to the outlets for preservative solution.<br><br>
A cavity at top/bottom of the bamboo culm was made as reservoir for preservative<br>
solution. The cavity thus made was given a deep incision at the base to expose the<br>
longitudinal vessels to conduct the solution. The bamboo was then kept erect with the<br>
reservoir on the top. The use of rubber tube was suggested to convey the preservative<br>
solution in this modified Boucherie process.<br>
The original Boucherie apparatus was modified by adding a pressure generating simple<br>
device like hand/foot pump pressure and a pressure gauge to monitor the pressure in<br>
reservoir.<br>
In the modified Boucherie apparatus, the pressure is generated by using an ordinary<br>
hand/foot pump to generate the pressure to push the preservative solution through<br>
bamboo. Thus, the use of gravitational force is eliminated and the apparatus became a<br>
portable set.<br>
The modified Boucherie aparatus was attended with several disadvantages. The shape of<br>
tank is rectangular which requires additional energy and time to generate the desired<br>
pressure. The coupling unit for connecting the bamboo with the preservative solution is<br>
made of hosepipe/rubber tube. Fitting/connecting the bamboo to this unit is a tedious job.<br><br>
It requires 15-20 minutes of time. Due to its elastic nature, many a times it swells and<br>
burst due to applied pressure and spillage of preservative solution occurs or some time<br>
bamboo is thrown away from the coupling unit resulting in excessive spillage. Moreover,<br>
there is recurring expenditure on coupling unit due to damage and change. Due to lack of<br>
drainage valve in the apparatus, complete cleaning of reservoir tank is not possible and<br>
therefore additive sediments accumulate in the tank in repeated refilling of treatment<br>
solution. These sediments move with the solution and plug the vessels of bamboo /<br>
hindering/delaying the treatment process. The handle provided with the apparatus did not<br>
afford a balanced handling. Further, there was no protection for pressure gauge and air<br>
inlet.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to propose an improved apparatus for post harvest treatment<br>
and preservation of bamboos.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose an improved apparatus for post harvest<br>
treatment and preservation of bamboos, which avoids the disadvantages of the prior art<br>
and as described hereinabove.<br><br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose an improved apparatus for post<br>
harvest treatment and preservation of bamboos, which is efficient.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose an improved apparatus for post<br>
harvest treatment and preservation of bamboos, which is low cost and portable.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to propose an improved apparatus for post<br>
harvest treatment and preservation of bamboos, which substantially reduces the<br>
processing period.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an apparatus for post harvest<br>
treatment and preservation of bamboo comprising : i) a reservoir tank, ii) an outlet<br>
with a drainage valve at the lower end of said reservoir tank for the drainage of the<br>
treatment solution, iii) a pressure gauge at the upper cover of said reservoir tank<br>
characterized in that iv) said storage tank is cylindrical, v) a first inlet for an air<br>
pump, vi) a second inlet for introduction of the treatment solution, vii) a pipe at<br>
the lower end extending into coupling unit for holding end of a bamboo.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION WITH REFERENCE TO DRAWINGS<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing<br>
description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing and wherein:<br>
Fig.l shows the apparatus of the present invention for post harvest treatment and<br>
preservation of bamboo.<br>
Referring to fig.l, the apparatus comprises a reservoir tank 1 made of any suitable metal<br>
or plastic material which does degrade with the treatment. Specifically, in accordance<br>
with this invention reservoir tank 1 is of a cylindrical shape and avoids the disadvantages<br>
with a reservoir tank 1 of a rectangular section as known with the prior art. Thus, the<br>
energy required to pump air of a cylindrical shape is much less than that of a tank of a<br>
rectangular shape.<br>
Reservoir tank 1 has a cover 2 with a first inlet 3 for an air pump and a second inlet 4 for<br>
the treatment solution. Thus, a difference between the apparatus of the prior art which<br>
had only a single; inlet for both the solution and air pump the apparatus of the present<br>
invention has two inlets, which avoids the disadvantages of a single inlet.<br>
Cover 2 has a pressure gauge 5, and as already known in the art for measuring the<br>
pressure within tank 1. A ring handle 6 is provided on cover 2.<br><br>
Tank 1 is supported on a plurality of legs 7. Further, the base 8 of the tank 1 has a tank<br>
cleaning valve 9. A level indicator 10 is provided with tank 1 to indicate the level of the<br>
solution within tank 1.<br>
Specifically, in accordance with one of the aspects of this invention, a flow pipe 11 is<br>
provided in the proximity of the base 8 of tank 1. Flow pipe is made of the same material<br>
as of tank 1 and extends into a plurality of a single coupling unit integrally formed with<br>
pipe 11. Coupling unit comprises a proximal member 12 held to a distal member 13, an<br>
oil seal 14 provided therebetween. The solution from tank 1 flows into the coupling unit<br>
16 having one end of a bamboo held thereto. Screens 15 are provided with distal member<br>
13 for holding the bamboo.<br><br>
