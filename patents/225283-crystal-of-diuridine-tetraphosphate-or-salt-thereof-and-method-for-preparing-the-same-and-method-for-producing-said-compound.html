COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"CRYSTAL OF DIURIDINE TETRAPHOSPHATE OR SALT THEREOF AND METHOD FOR PREPARING THE SAME, AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING SAID COMPOUND"<br>
YAMASA CORPORATION, a Japanese corporation, of 10-1, Araoicho 2-chome, Choshi-shi, Chiba, 288-0056, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing crystals of P1, P4-difuridine 5'-) tetraphosphate or a salt thereof and more particularly to stable crystals of<br>
P1,P4-di(uridine 5' -) tetraphosphate (U2P4) or a salt thereof which are useful as an active ingredient of an expectorant or a therapeutic agent for pneumonia; a process for producing the crystals; arid a process for efficiently producing U2P4 or a salt thereof.<br><br>
a T&gt;
Background Art<br>
A tetrasodium salt of P1,P4-di(uridine 5'1-)tetraphosphate (U2P4'4Na) represented by the following formula (I):<br><br><br>
has an expectoration-inducing action and is a compound which is expected to be developed as an expectorant or a therapeutic agent for pneumonia (e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,789,391, 5,763,447, and 5,635,160).<br><br><br>
Until now, U2P4 has not been obtained in crystal form, and has been prepared only in the form of a lyophilized product (see Example 1 of WO 99/05155).  Typical U2P4 produced by conventional method has a purity as low as 90%, and contains by-products.  Examples of by-products include nucleoside 5'-(poly)phosphates such as uridine 5'-tetraphosphate (UP4). uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP), uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP), and uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP); and dinucleoside polyphosphates such as P1,P4-di(uridine 5'-)triphosphate (U2P3) and P1,P4-di(uridine 5'-)diphosphate (U2P2)   Particularly, it is difficult to separate nucleoside 5'-(poly)phosphates such as,UTP from U2P4, arid highly purified U2P4 has been produced only with great difficulty through a conventional purification method; i.e., ion-exchange chromatography (WO '99/05155, Blochimlca et Biophysics Acta,   438, (1976)' 304-309) .<br>
The above purified and lyophilized product has disadvantages such as high hygroscopicity.  Therefore, preparation of a pharmaceutical from U2P4 must be carried out in a special apparatus in which (moisture is well controlled. Even after preparation of a pharmaceutical, the product must be wrapped tightly.  In addition, since the pharmaceutical has a very short available period due to poor stability of the lyophilized preparation, obtaining highly purified and stable U2P4 crystals has been desired.<br>
U2P4 is synthesized from uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) by use of an activating agent such as diphenyl<br><br>
phosphorochloridate (DPC) and a phosphorylating agent such as a pyrophosphate (PPi). However, a conventional process provides a low synthesis yield; i.e., as low as approximately 10 wt.% (Example 4B of WO 99/05155), and can never serve as a practical process. Accordingly, development of a process for producing U2P4 at high yield and on a large scale has also been desired.<br>
In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to provide stable crystals of U2P4 or a salt thereof.  Another object of the invention is to provide a process for producing the crystals.  Still another object of the invention is to provide a process for efficiently producing U2P4 on a large scale.<br>
Disclosure of .the Invention<br>
The present inventors have conducted earnest studies on a method for purifying U2P4 and a process for synthesizing U2P4 from UMP.  The inventors have found that U2P4 purified through anion exchange chromatography and chromatography using activated charcoal (activated-charcoal chromatography) can be easily crystallized and that use of specific reaction conditions has the effect of drastically increasing the yield of U2P4 in the synthesis of U2P4 or a salt thereof from UMP serving as a starting material and by use of DPC and PPi. The present invention has been achieved on the basis of these findings.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides crystals of<br>
P1P4-difuridine 5'-) tetraphosphate or a salt thereof.<br>
The present invention also provides crystals of P1,P4~ di(uridine 5'-)tetraphosphate tetrasodium salt having a crystal structure showing characteristic peaks in X-ray diffraction employing Cu-Kα rays in the vicinity of the-diffraction angles (2θ) of 5.9, 11.5, 12.4, 15.4, 17.2, 18.0, 19.8, and 20.5(°).<br>
The present invention also provides crystals of P1,P4-di(uridine 5'-)tetraphosphate tetrasodium salt having a crystal structure showing characteristic peaks in an IR absorption spectrum at wavelengths in the vicinity of 1690, 1277, 1233, 1146, 1116, and 890 (cm"1).<br>
The present invention also provides a process for producing crystals of P1, P4-di(uridine 5'-)tetraphosphate or a salt thereof, which process comprises purifying crude Pl,P4-di(uridine 5'-)tetraphosphate or a salt thereof through anion exchange chromatography and activated-charcoal chromatography and adding a hydrophilic organic solvent to a solution of purified P1, P4-di(uridine 5'-)tetraphosphate or a salt thereof, to thereby precipitate crystals.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for producing P1,P4-difuridine 5'-) tetraphosphate or a salt thereof from uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) serving as a starting material and by use of diphenyl phosphorochloridate (DPC) and a pyrophosphate (PPi), which process comprises at least one of the following treatment steps:<br>
(a) adding UMP diphenylphosphate (UMP-DPP) in divided<br><br>
portions during a step of reaction of UMP-DPP with a PPi-organic alkali salt;<br>
(b) carrying out a step of reaction of UMP-DPP with a PPi-organic alkali salt in the presence of a base; and<br>
(c) further treating the synthesized U2P4 with an alkaliy<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The crystals of U2P4 or a salt thereof according to the present invention are obtained through purification of crude U2P4 or a salt thereof by use of specific means, and addition of a hydrophilic organic solvent to a solution of purified U2P4 or a salt thereof, to thereby precipitate the solute as crystals.  The present invention will next be described in terms of (1) purification of U2P4 or a salt thereof and (2) crystallization of U2P4 or a salt thereof. (1)  Purification of U2P4 or a salt thereof<br>
U2P4 or a salt thereof can be purified through anion exchange chromatography and activated-charcoal chromatography performed in combination.  Although the two chromatography techniques may be performed in arbitrary sequence, anion exchange chromatography preferably precedes activated-charcoal chromatography, in view of improvement of the purity of U2P4.<br>
A styrenic or acrylic resin may be used as an anion-exchanging resin in the above-described chromatography techniques.  Examples of resins which may be used include strongly basic anion-exchanging resins such as AMBERLITE IRA 402 (Rohm &amp; Haas Co.), DIAION PA-312, and DIAION SA-11A (Mitsubishi Chemical Co. Ltd.), and weakly basic anion-exchanging resins such as AMBERLITE IRA 67 (Rohm &amp; Haas Co.) and DIAION WA-30 (Mitsubishi Chemical Co. Ltd.).<br>
The activated charcoal may be in the form of chromatography-grade activated charcoal which is crushed or<br><br>
shaped into particles, and may include commercially available products (e.g., those of Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. and Futamura Kagaku Kogyo).<br>
Chromatography may be carried out in a batch manner, or by use of a column.  When the column chromatography is carried out, an aqueous acid solution or a mixture thereof with a salt having enhanced ionic strength, such as sodium chloride, may be used as an eluent for anion exchange chromatography; and water or an aqueous solution of alkali such as sodium hydroxide may be used as an eluent for activated-charcoal column chromatography.  A small-scale preliminary test may be conducted in order to appropriately determine the concentration of each eluent from the range of 0.001 M to 10 M. (2)  Crystallization of U2P4 or a salt thereof<br>
U2P4 or a .salt thereof is crystallized through addition of an hydrophilic Organic solvent to a solution containing the thus-purified U2P4 or a salt thereof.<br>
Examples of the hydrophilic organic solvents which may be used include alcohols having six or fewer carbon atoms, such as methanol and ethanol; ketones such as acetone; ethers such as dioxane; nltriles such as acetonitrile; and amides such as dimethylforamide.  of these, alcohols, especially ethanol, are particularly preferred.<br>
More specifically, a solution of the thus-purified U2P4 or a salt thereof, or a slurry obtained through concentration of the solution, is; optionally treated to thereby adjust the<br><br>
pH to 6-9, and a hydrophilic organic solvent is added to the solution or slurry at 60°C or less to thereby precipitate the solute as stable U1P4 crystals.<br>
The thus-obtained U2P4 crystals of the present invention contain (1) U2P4 in an amount of 95% or more and (2) other homologous compounds in an amount- of 5% or less.<br>
In the present invention, other homologous compounds include nucleoside 5'-(poly)phosphates such as UP4, UTP, UDP, and UMP; and dinucXeoside polyphosphates such as U2P3 and U2P2.<br>
More preferably/ U2P4 crystals contain (1) U2P4 in an amount of 97% or more,   (2) UDP in an amount of 1% or less, and (3) UTP in an amount of 1% or less.  Particularly preferably, U2P4 crystals contain (1) U2P4 in an amount of 98% or more, (2) UDP in an amount of 0.5% or less, and (3) UTP in an amount of 0..5% or less.<br>
Such highly purified U2P4 crystals may be in the form of a salt, hydrate, of hydrate salt.  Examples of the salts include pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts such as alkali metal salts such as  sodium salts and potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium salts and magnesium salts; and ammonium salts.  The U2P4 may be substituted with 1-4 metal atoms to form a salt.<br>
The above hydrate may comprise 3-8 molecules of water which are bound to or adhere to one molecule of U2P4, and the above hydrate salt may comprise 3-8 molecules of water which are bound to or adhere to one molecule of an alkali metal salt of U2P4.<br><br>
Examples of preferred U2P4 crystals include U2P4.4Na crystals and hydrates thereof.  The U2P4.4Na crystals show characteristic peaks in X-ray diffraction employing Cu-Kα  rays in the vicinity of the diffraction angles (28) of 5.9, 11.5, 12.4, 15.4, 17.2, 18.0, 19.8, and 20.5(°) (error range ±0.1°), and show, characteristic peaks in an IR absorption spectrum at wavelengths in the vicinity of 1690, 1277, 1233, 1146, 1116, and 890 (cm-1) (error range ±2 cm"1).  Furthermore, the U2P4'4Na crystals are easy to handle and remarkably useful as compared with conventional lyophilized products, since the crystals are stable under high temperature, high humidity conditions and the water content of  the crystals is stabilized at 5-15 wt.%, to thereby suppress-further hygroscopicity.<br>
As described above, the thus-obtained U2P4'4Na crystals of the present.invention contain (1) U2P4 in an amount of 95% or more and (2) other homologous compounds in an amount of 5% or less.  In addition, as described above, examples of the preferred U2P4 crystals include such crystals containing (1) U2P4 in an amount of 9 7% or more, (2) UDP in an amount of 1% or less, and (3) UTP in an amount of 1% or less, particularly crystals containing (1) U2P4 in an amount of 98% or more, (2) UDP in an amount of 0.5% or less, and (3) UTP in an amount of 0.5% or less.<br>
Furthermore, the crystals of U2P4 or a salt thereof according to the present invention also include tautomers thereof.<br><br>
The crystals of U2P4 or a salt thereof according to the present invention are optionally dried through a conventional method such as drying under reduced pressure, drying under air-flow, or drying by heating, and are subsequently placed in a container (e.g., bottle, pouch, can, ampoule).  Packing' in the container may be carried out such that the container is open, closed, airtight., or sealed.  The open condition is not preferred, in view of maintenance of storage stability of •the crystals.<br>
Next, an efficient process for synthesizing U2P4 will be described.<br>
Conventionally, U2P4 or a salt thereof has predominantly been synthesized from uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) serving as a starting material and by use of an activating agent such as diphenyl phosphorochloridate (DPC) and a phosphorylating agent such as a pyrophosphate (PPi).  Specifically, DPC and tributylamine ara added, to a tributylamine salt of UMP, to thereby produce UMP diphenylphosphate (UMP-DPP) serving as a reactive intermediate, which is reacted with tributylamine pyrophosphate (TBA-PPi), to thereby obtain U2P4 or a salt thereof at a yield of approximately 9.6% (Example 4B of WO 99/05155).<br>
The process according to the present invention is characterized in that at least one of the following treatment steps is carried out: (a) adding UMP-DPP in divided portions during a conventional step of rea.ctioa of UMP-DPP with, a PPi- . organic alkali salt; (b) carrying out reaction of UMP-DPP<br><br>
with a PPi-organic alkali salt in the presence of a base; and (c) further treating the synthesized U2P4 with an alkali. Two or more of the above treatment steps may be combined.<br>
The step "(a) adding UMP-DPP in divided portions" refers to addition of UMP-DPP, which must be provided in an amount by mol of at least twice that of a PPi-organic alkali salt, in several portions rather than in a single portion. For example, a PPi-organic alkali salt is reacted with an equimol amount of UMP-DPP and the step is repeated.  Although no particular limitation is imposed on the number of portions of UMP-DPP, 2-3 portions are preferred in view of increase of the yield.<br>
Examples of the PPi-organic alkali salts include a hexylamine salt, a dibutylamine salt, a triethylamine salt, and a tributylamine salt.  In reaction with UMP-DPP, the PPi-organic alkali salt may be dissolved in a solvent. Examples of the solvents include amides such as DMF, DMAC, and formamide; cyclic ethers such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran; ketones such as acetone; and dimethylimidazolidinone, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, or a mixture of two or more of these.  Subsequently, UMP-DPP is added to the solution, and the mixture is allowed to react at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes to five hours.<br>
The step "(b) carrying out reaction of UMP-DPP with a PPi-organic alkali salt in the presence of a base" refers to a reaction carried out in the nresence of a base.  Examples<br><br>
of the bases include pyridine bases such as pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, 2,4-lutidine, α,β,γ-picoline, 2,4-dimethylaminopyridine, and α,β,γ -collidine, with pyridine being particularly preferred.  A basic solvent for the reaction is also included in the bases used in the present • invention.  The concentration of the base is not particularly limited.  The base is preferably added in an amount of 6 equivalents or more based on UMP, more preferably 18 equivalents.or more.<br>
Furthermore, the step "(c) further treating the synthesized U2P4 with an alkali" refers to quenching of a liquid containing synthesized U2P4 with water* and treating the mixture with a solution of an organic or inorganic alkali such as sodium hydroxide,•ammonia, potassium hydroxide, pyridine, trie thyalmine, or sodium carbonate.  Conventionally, the quenched liquid as such is purified directly.  However, the treatment with an alkali enables improvement of the isolation yield of U2P4 as compared with the conventional method.<br>
In the treatment with an alkali, a liquid containing synthesized U2P4 is quenched with water, and an alkali is added to the mixture such that the pH of the mixture becomes approximately 8-13, preferably 10-12.  The mixture is allowed to react at room "temperature for approximately 10 minutes to five hours.<br>
UMP-DPP can be synthesized from UMP through a conventional method.  For example, a UMP trialkylamine salt<br><br><br><br>
such as a UMP tributylamine salt prepared through a conventional method is dissolved in a solvent.  Examples of the solvents include amides such as DMF and dimethylacetamide (DMAC); cyclic ethers such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran; ketones such as acetone; and dimethylimidazolidinone, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, or a mixture thereof. Subsequently, DPC and, if needed, a trialkylamine are added to the solution, and the mixture is allowed to react at room temperature.for approximately 30 minutes to five hours, to thereby synthesize UMP-DPP serving as a reactive intermediate.<br>
Examples<br>
The present invention will next be described in more detail by way of examples.<br>
Example 1  Syathesis of U2P4 or a salt thereof (1)  Effect of a base<br>
DMAC (8 mL) was added to a dehydrated uridine 5'-monophosphate tributylamine salt (UMP-TBA) (6.2 mmol), and DPC (1.7 mL) was added dropwise to the mixture with stirring. The thus-obtained mixture was reacted at room temperature for one hour to thereby form UMP-DPP, after which TBA (7.6 mL) was added to the reaction mixture, which was stirred for another 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, dehydrated TEA-PPi (3.0 mmol) was dissolved in pyridine (1.7 mL), and the thus-prepared solution was added to the UMP-DPP reaction mixture. Subsequently, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for three hours, and water was added to the mixture to thereby<br><br>
stop the reaction.  The obtained reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC (at 262 nm), which showed that the target U2P4 was obtained at a yield of 18.3%.<br>
As is apparent from the result, when UMP-DPP is reacted with TEA-PPi in the presence of a base (pyridine), U2P4 may be synthesized at about twice the yield obtained through a conventional method. (2)  Effect of combination use of base and alkali treatment<br>
DMAC (.8 mL) was added to a dehydrated uridine 5'-monophosphate tributylamine salt (UMP-TBA) (6.2 mmol), and DPC (1.7 mL) was added dropwise to the mixture with stirring. The thus-obtained mixture was reacted at room temperature for one hour to thereby form UMP-DPP, after which, TBA (7.6 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and the mixture was stirred for another 10. minutes.  Meanwhile, dehydrated TEA-PPi (3.0 mmol) was dissolved in pyridine (1.7 mL), and the thus-prepared solution was added to the UMP-DPP reaction mixture. Subsequently, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for three hours, and water was added to the mixture, to thereby stop the reaction.  A 30% sodium hydroxide solution was added to the above-obtained reaction mixture so as to adjust pH to 11.0, and the mixture was allowed to stand overnight.  The obtained reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC (at 262 nm), which showed that the target U2P4 was obtained at a yield of 29.7%.<br>
As is.apparent from the result, when UMP-DPP is reacted with TEA-PPi in the presence of a base (pyridine) and further<br><br>
alkali treatment is performed, U2P4 may be synthesized at<br>
about three times the yield obtained through a conventional<br>
method.<br>
(3)  Effect of base and addition of UMP-DPP in several<br>
portions<br>
Formamide (1.5 mL) and pyridine (1.5 mL) were added to a triethylamine salt of dehydrated pyrophosphoric acid (TEA-PPi) (6 mmol), and the mixture was stirred in a vessel. Meanwhile, in another vessel, DMAC (4.3 mL), dioxane (4.8 mL), and tributylamine (TBA) (5.8 mL) were added to a dehydrated uridine 5'-monophosphate tributylamine salt (UMP-TBA) (12 mmol), and the mixture was stirred.  Subsequently, DPC (2.5 mL) was added dropwise to the mixture, and the thus-obtained mixture was further stirred at room temperature for one hour, to thereby form UMP-DPP.  Half of the UMP-DPP reaction mixture was added dropwise to the vessel containing TEA-PPi, and reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for one hour.  Subsequently, pyridine (1.5 mL) was added to the mixture, and the remaining UMP-DPP reaction mixture was added dropwise to the vessel.  The thus-obtained reaction mixture was further reacted at room temperature for one hour, and water was added to the mixture to thereby stop the reaction. The obtained reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC (at 262 nm) , which showed that the target U2P4 was obtained at a yield of 29.5%.<br>
As is apparent from the result, when UMP-DPP is added in two portions and UMP-DPP is reacted with TEA-PPi in the<br><br>
presence of a base (pyridine), U2P4 may be produced at about three times the yield obtained through a conventional method. As is also apparent from the result, addition of UMP-DPP in two portions provides a yield of 2 9.5%, which is about 1.6 times the yield obtained in (1) above (18.3%). (4)  Effect of alkali treatment<br>
Formamide (1.5 mL) and pyridine (1.5 mL) were added to a triethylamine salt of dehydrated pyrophosphoric acid (TEA-PPi) (6 mmol), and the mixture was stirred in a vessel. Meanwhile, in another vessel, DMAC (4.3 mL), dioxane (4.8 mL), and tributylamine (TBA) (5.8 mL) were added to a dehydrated uridine 5'-monophosphate tributylamine salt (UMP-TBA) (12 mmol), and the mixture was stirred.  Subsequently, DPC (2.5 mL) was added dropwise to the mixture, and the thus-obtained mixture was further stirred at room temperature for one hour, to thereby form UMP-DPP.  Half of the UMP-DPP reaction mixture was added dropwise to the vessel containing TEA-PPi, and reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for one hour.  Subsequently, pyridine (1.5 mL) was added to the mixture, and the remaining UMP-DPP reaction mixture was added dropwise to the vessel.  The thus-obtained reaction mixture was further reacted at room temperature for one hour, and water was added to the mixture to thereby stop the reaction. A 3 0% Sodium hydroxide solution was added to the above-obtained reaction mixture so as to adjust pH to 11.0, and the mixture was allowed to stand overnight.  The obtained reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC (at 262 nm), which<br><br>
showed that the target U2P4 was obtained at a yield of 32.2%.<br>
As is apparent from the result, when alkali treatment is added to the above-described (3), the yield is increased by about 10%; i.e., from 29.5% to 32.2%. Example 2  Production of U2P4.4Na crystals<br>
Formamide (10 mL) and pyridine (15 mL) were added to a triethylamine salt of dehydrated pyrophosphoric acid (TEA-PPi) (40.5 mmol), and the mixture was stirred in a vessel. Meanwhile, in another vessel, DMAC (50 mL), dioxane (34 mL), and tributylamine (TBA) (30 mL) were added to a dehydrated uridine 5'-monophosphate tributylamine salt (UMP-TBA) (80 mmol), and the mixture was stirred.  Subsequently, DPC (17.8 mL) was added dropwise to the mixture, and the thus-obtained mixture was further stirred at room temperature for one hour, to thereby form UMP-DPP.  Half of the UMP-DPP reaction mixture was added dropwise to the vessel containing TEA-PPi, and reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for one hour.  Subsequently, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (50 mg) and pyridine (15 mL) were added to the mixture, and the remaining UMP-DPP reaction mixture was added dropwise to the vessel.  The thus-obtained reaction mixture was further reacted at room temperature for two hours, and water was added to the mixture to thereby stop the reaction.  The reaction mixture was diluted with water to a total volume of 700 mL, and a sodium hydroxide solution was added to the solution to thereby adjust pH to 10.  The solution was concentrated to 200 mL, and ethanol (250 mL) was added to the<br><br>
concentrated solution with stirring.  The solution was<br>
allowed to stand, at 4°C overnight, and. the supernatant was removed by decantation.  The thus-obtained solution was diluted with water to a total volume of 250 mL, and was analyzed by HPLC (at 262 nm), which showed that the target U2P4 was obtained at a yield of 30.0%.<br>
The above-obtained solution (110 mL) was diluted with water to a total volume of 2000 mL and the diluted solution was applied, to a weak anion exchange column (AMBERLITE IRA-67) (CI type) (200 mL).  Subsequently, the column was washed with water, and by-products were eluted with 0.18 M hydrochloric acid, after which the target U2P4 was eluted with a 0.005 M hydrochloric acid solution containing 0.35 M NaCl (recovery percentage: 82.7%).<br>
A sodium .hydroxide solution was added to the thus-obtained eluate to thereby adjust pH to 2.5. . Subsequently, the eluate was applied to an activated charcoal column (Taiko SGP), and the column was washed with water and eluted with a 0.05 M sodium hydroxide solution (recovery percentage: 84.9%).<br>
The pH of the thus-obtained eluate was adjusted to 7.6, and the eluate was concentrated to 38 mL.  Subsequently, ethanol (57 mL) was added to the concentrated solution to thereby obtain 3.1 g of U2P4.4Na crystals (water content: 7.8%) (isolation yield: 18.4%). (Physical properties of U2P4.4Na crystals)<br>
The U2P4.4Na crystals prepared in Example 2 were dried at 60°C for four hours by use of a forced-air drier, and<br><br>
subjected to instrumental analysis.  In addition, a lyophilized product of U2P4*4Na was prepared in the same way as in the method described in Example 1 of WO 99/05155, and the thus-prepared product was compared with the crystals in terms of physical properties. (1)  instrumental analysis 1)  Analysis of purity<br>
The U2P4.4Na crystals obtained in Example 2, and fractions containing U2P4 after purification through each chromatography were subjected to analysis of purity by means of high performance liquid chromatography.  The results are shown in Table 1.  Conditions for the high performance liquid chromatography are described below.<br>
Column: HITACHIGEL #3013-N (product of Hitachi Keisokuki Service)<br>
Eluent: 10% CH3CN, 0.18 M NH4C1, 0.03 M KH2PO4, and 0.03 M K2HP04<br><br>
( -):  Below detectable limit<br>
Detection method: UV detection at 262 nm Table 1<br><br><br>
2)	Water content<br>
The U2P4'4Na crystals were subjected to measurement of water content by means of the Karl Fischer method, to thereby show a water content of 5-15 wt.%, which varied in accordance" with the degree of drying.  The results apparently show that three to eight water molecules bind or adhere to one U2P4 molecule.<br>
3)	Melting point<br>
The U2P4*4Na crystals were subjected to measurement of melting point by means of a conventional method, to thereby provide a decomposition point of about 223°cr The decomposition point of  the lyophllized product was about<br>
220°C.<br>
4)	X-ray diffraction<br>
The U2P4*4Na crystals were subjected to measurement of X-ray diffraction by use of an X-ray diffraction apparatus (Model: RINT2500V, product of Rigaku Denki) under the following conditions.  The thus-obtained x-ray diffraction spectra are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, and the peak data are shown in Tables 2 and 3. (Conditions for measurement)<br>
X-ray tube: Cu-Kα X-ray output: 50 kV-300 mA Scanning rate: 4.0°/minute Scanning interval: 0.02° Angle measuring range: 2-40°<br><br><br>
Slit: DS-0.50, RS-0.15 nun, SS-O.50<br>
Pre-treatment: Grinding by use of an agate mortar<br>
Table 3<br><br>
Table 2<br><br>
Fig. 1 and Table 2 show the data for the crystals of U2P4 .4Na tetrahydrate, and Fig. 2 and Table 3 show the data<br><br>
for the crystals of U2P4*4Na octahydrate.  In addition, the X-ray diffraction spectrum of the lyophilized product is shown in Fig. 3 as a reference. 5)  Hygroscopicity<br>
U2P4'4Na crystals (octahydrate) having a water content of approximately 14% were allowed to stand for nine days under the following conditions: a) 25°C and a relative humidity of 57%; b) 25°C and a relative humidity of 75%; and c) 40°C and a relative humidity of 75%.  No decomposition or change in weight was observed in the above three cases.  The crystals have proven to be stable and to have no hygroscopicity.  U2P4 *4Na crystals (tetrahydrate) having a water content of approximately 8% were allowed to stand for nine days under conditions of 40°C and a relative humidity of 75%.  In this .case, the water content increased to 14-15%. However, the water content did not increase further, and the crystals were stabilized.<br>
In contrast, when a lyophilized product (initial water content: approximately 1 %) was allowed to stand for nine days under conditions of 40°C and a relative humidity of 75%, the water content  increased gradually, and on the seventh day of storage the product assumed a mud-like state due to deliquescence. 6)  Stability<br>
U2P4 .4Na crystals (octahydrate) and a lyophilized product were placed in respective bottles, which were then sealed and allowed to stand for 13 days at 60°C (acceleration<br><br><br>
test).  No decomposition of the crystals was observed, while partial decomposition of the lyophilized product was confirmed through observation of purity lonering of  U2P4' 4Na of approximately 1.4%.<br>
7)	Crystal form<br>
Fig. 4 shows a photograph of a typical crystal form of U2P4'4Na (octahydrate) crystals.<br>
8)	IR absorption spectra<br>
IR spectra of U2P.4Na crystals (octahydrate) and a lyophilized product were measured in a customary manner by use of a JASCO 5000 Spectrophotometer.  The results are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.  The lyophilized product of U2P4-4Na exhibits peaks at 3416, 1702, 1266, 1116, 1079, and 906 (cm" 1)   (Fig. 6), whereas U2P4-4Na crystals exhibit peaks at 33 86, 1690, 1277, 12.33. X146, 1116, and 890 (cm"1) (Fig. 5). Example 3  Production of U2P4 • 4Na octahydrate crystals<br>
The fraction containing U2P4 obtained through treatment with a column in Example 2 was concentrated to thereby prepare a slurry, and pH thereof was adjusted to 7.0. Methanol was gradually added to the slurry with stirring, and the slurry was further stirred with cooling to 10°C, to thereby precipitate U2P4*4Na crystals.<br>
The water content of the thus-obtained and dried U2P4 •4Na crystals was measured through the Karl Fischer method, to thereby determine that the crystals are octahydrate.  The X-ray  diffraction spectrum of the crystals is shown in Fig. 7, and peak data thereof are shown in Table<br><br><br>
