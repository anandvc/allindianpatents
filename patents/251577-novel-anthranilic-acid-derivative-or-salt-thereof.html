DESCRIPTION<br>
NOVEL ANTHRANILIC ACID DERIVATIVE OR SALT THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel<br>
anthranilic acid derivative or a salt thereof having<br>
the inhibitory activity of matrix metalloprotease 13<br>
(MMP-13) production.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Matrix metalloproteases are a family<br>
consisting of zinc-dependent proteases whose substrates<br>
are components of extracellular matrix, and they are<br>
activated by removal of a propeptide after secretion.<br>
More than 20 members of matrix metalloproteases have<br>
been identified in human, and they are classified into<br>
collagenase (MMP-1, 8, 13), gelatinase (MMP-2, 9),<br>
stromelysin (MMP-3, 10), matrilysin (MMP-7, 26),<br>
membrane-type MMP (MMP-14, 15, 16, 17, 24, 25)<br>
according to the domain structure and substrate<br>
specificity. Overexpression of these matrix<br>
metalloproteases are observed in various cancer cells,<br>
and it is considered to be involved in the<br>
proliferation and metastasis thereof. Anticancer agents<br>
that inhibit matrix metalloprotease have been developed<br>
up to now (Non-Patent Document 1).<br><br>
2<br>
[0003]<br>
Matrix metalloprotease inhibitors have been<br>
developed as a therapeutic agent for rheumatoid<br>
arthritis and osteoarthritis. The articular cartilage<br>
is composed of a cartilage type II collagen network in<br>
which cartilage proteoglycans such as aggrecan and<br>
hyaluronic acid are retained. Matrix metalloprotease<br>
participates in the maintenance of the extracellular<br>
matrix. When matrix metalloprotease and TIMP (tissue<br>
inhibitor of metalloproteinases), an endogenous<br>
inhibitor thereof, are not in balance and matrix<br>
metalloprotease becomes excessively present,<br>
destruction of the cartilages and bones may progress.<br>
Particularly when collagen fibers are damaged, the<br>
joints suffer from progressive destruction as observed<br>
in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Accordingly,<br>
long-term suppression of the progress of joint<br>
destruction in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis<br>
can be expected by inhibiting excessive matrix<br>
metalloprotease (Non-Patent Document 2).<br>
[0004]<br>
In osteoarthritis, the production of<br>
interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a<br>
also increases and extracellular matrix is degraded.<br>
The production of matrix metalloprotease is further<br>
increased by degradation products of type II collagen<br>
and fibronectin, leading to progress in degradation of<br>
matrix in the joints. When this damage of matrix<br>
exceeds a certain threshold, character of cartilage<br><br>
3<br>
cells pathological change, and joint destruction keeps<br>
progressing. It is MMP-13 that plays a dominant role in<br>
this cleavage of type II collagen (Non-Patent Document<br>
3).<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]<br>
Drugs inhibiting the production of matrix<br>
metalloproteases, particularly MMP-13, are strongly<br>
demanded.<br>
[0007]<br>
Under the circumstances, the present<br>
inventors have conducted extensive studies, and<br>
consequently have found that an anthranilic acid<br>
derivative represented by general formula [1]<br>
[Formula 1]<br>
wherein, R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a carboxyl<br>
protecting group; R2 represents a phenyl, cycloalkyl or<br><br><br>
4<br>
heterocyclic group which may be optionally substituted;<br>
R3 represents a phenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl,<br>
monocyclic heterocyclic or bicyclic heterocyclic group<br>
which may be optionally substituted; X1 represents a<br>
carbonyl group or sulfonyl group; X2 represents an<br>
alkylene, alkenylene or alkynylene group which may be<br>
optionally substituted or a bond; provided that when X1<br>
is a sulfonyl group and X4 is a bond, X2 represents an<br>
alkylene, alkenylene or alkynylene group which may be<br>
optionally substituted; X3 represents an oxygen atom, a<br>
sulfur atom or a bond; X4 represents a group represented<br>
by the general formula, -X5-X6- or -X6-X5-, wherein the<br>
bond on the left side of each general formula is linked<br>
to R3; and X5 represents an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom,<br>
an imino group which may be optionally protected, a<br>
sulfinyl group or a sulfonyl group or a bond; X6<br>
represents an alkylene, alkenylene or alkynylene group<br>
which may be optionally substituted or a bond, or a<br>
salt thereof has the inhibitory activity of MMP-13<br>
production and thus completed the present invention.<br>
[0008]<br>
The novel anthranilic acid derivative or a<br>
salt thereof of the present invention has the<br>
inhibitory activity of MMP-13 production and is<br>
therefore useful as, for example, a therapeutic agent<br>
for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, cancer and<br>
the other diseases in which MMP-13 is involved.<br><br>

Test Example 2: type II collagen-induced arthritis in<br>
Mice<br>
Eight-week old male DBA/1J mice were used<br>
(Charles River Laboratories Japan Inc.). 4 mg/mL bovine<br>
type II collagen (Collagen Gijutsu Kenshukai) dissolved<br>
in 0.01 mol/L of acetic acid aqueous solution and an<br>
equal amount of Freund's complete adjuvant (Chondorex)<br>
containing 1 mg/mL of killed tuberculosis bacillus were<br>
added to prepare an emulsion, and 0.1 mL thereof was<br>
intradermally injected at the base of tail. Similar<br>
treatment was conducted on the 21st day to cause<br>
arthritis. The test compound was suspended in 0.5%<br>
methylcellulose aqueous solution, and 30 mg/kg was<br>
orally administered once a day from the 21st day to the<br>
35th day. In the control group, 0.5% methylcellulose<br>
aqueous solution was administered in the same manner.<br>
The severity of arthritis was estimated by scoring at<br>
zero point for an animal without change; one point for<br>
an animal with swelling at the one or two finger joint<br>
or light swelling only at the carpal or tarsal joint;<br>
two points for an animal with severe swelling at the<br>
carpal or tarsal joint or with swelling at three or<br>
more finger joints; three points for an animal with<br>
severe swelling along the whole foreleg or hindleg and<br>
thus counting 12 points at the maximum for the four<br>
limbs as arthritis score. Degree of bone destruction<br>
was estimated by X-ray photographs of the four limbs on<br>
the 36th day observing the interphalangeal joints of<br><br>
86<br>
the second to fifth fingers, the metacarpophalangeal<br>
and metatarsophalangeal joints of the first to fifth<br>
fingers, carpal or tarsal parts, calcaneal bone and<br>
scoring at 0 or 0.5 point according to the absence or<br>
presence of osteoporotic image in the joint and their<br>
vicinity, 0 point for the bone image without change,<br>
one point for the partially destroyed bone image and, 2<br>
points for the completely destroyed bone image and thus<br>
counting 105 points at the maximum for the four limbs<br>
as bone destruction score. The inhibitory rate was<br>
determined by the following expression.<br>
Inhibitory ratio (%) = 100 - (score of a test compound<br>
treated group/score of the control group)xlOO<br>
The compound shown in Example 25 exhibited<br>
inhibitory action on arthritis and bone destruction.<br>

salt thereof according to claims 1 to 6.<br><br>
An anthranilic acid derivative represented by<br>
the general formula (X) [wherein R1 represents hydrogen<br>
or a carboxy-protecting group; R2 represents optionally<br>
substituted phenyl, a heterocyclic group, etc.; R3<br>
represents optionally substituted phenyl, a monocyclic<br>
heterocyclic group, etc.; X1 represents carbonyl, etc.;<br>
X2 represents optionally substituted alkylene group, a<br>
bond, etc.; X3 represents oxygen, a bond, etc.; and X4<br>
represents a group represented by the general formula<br>
-X5-X6- or -X6-X5- (wherein X5 means oxygen, a bond,<br>
etc.; and X6 means optionally substituted alkylene, a<br>
bond, etc.)] or a salt of the derivative. The<br>
derivative or salt has the inhibitory activity of MMP-<br>
13 production and is hence useful as a therapeutic<br>
