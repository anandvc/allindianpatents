DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERABLE EMBODIMENT<br>
A method for transmitting digital message is realized as the following.<br>
An generating matrix of operations with k rows and n columns is formed, said matrix is produced using a kxk matrix with operations g° at its diagonal and operations g1 at other positions and with a kxm additional matrix, which is added from the right to a kxk matrix and non-repeated rows of which are formed as sequences of operations g and g° or operations g1 and g2, chosen from any possible sequences, including not more than (m-2) operations g1. It's possible, also, to use an generating matrix of operations, produced with a help of said generating matrix of operations by rearranging its rows and/or columns. The resulting generating matrix of operations is a matrix, formed not of numbers, as usual matrixes, but of records, recommending to produce a corresponding operation in situations, when a corresponding element of an generating matrix of operations is initiated.<br>
An operation of adding additional operation matrix is produced with a purpose to introduce, into a transmitted message, check elements which are used for finding out errors in a received message, if they appear during a message transmission through a communication channel, and for their correcting if there is any opportunity to do this.<br>
A digital message Xk is encoded by producing matrix multiplication of a vector-row Xk into an above-mentioned generating matrix of operations G,<br>
A procedure of a generalized matrix multiplication operation is quite the same with a procedure of a usual matrix multiplication because it's produced in the same way. as the following: paired interaction operations are produced for a i-th element of a vector-row Xk and every ij-th element (which is situated at a crossing of a i-th row and a j-th column) of an operation matrix G and than results of i-th operations are summed with forming a j-th element of a vector-row Yn. As a result, every above-mentioned operation, which is required for producing a generalized matrix multiplication operation, can be interpreted as a summing operation in accordance with rules, formulated for elements of an Abelian group [2, p. 140], to which contains elements of a digital message Xk (with k information elements), formed with a corresponding source. Operations gv (g°, g1 and g2) corresponds to summing operations with a unity element of a group [2, p. 139], to summing operations with an inverse element of a group [2, p. 140] and to two-fold summing operations with an inverse element of a group, correspondingly.<br>
An encoded message is modulated and transmitted to a communication channel<br>
A received message is demodulated and decoded by producing operations of a generalized matrix multiplication of a check matrix H into a transposed vector-row Y nT.<br>
A mxn check matrix of operations H is formed by transposing additional matrix, by adding, to it from the right, a mxm matrix with operations g° at its diagonal and operations g1 at its other positions, if additional matrix rows correspond to sequences of operations g1 and g°, or in the same way with changing operations g2 for g°, if additional matrix rows correspond to sequences of operations g1 and g2, and by rearranging columns (if an generating matrix of operations formation was done by rearranging columns) in the same way with rearranging columns for an generating matrix of operations.<br>
After analyzing vector-column STm, formed as a result of producing operations of decoding, a decision is made on an error absence and, if there is not more then one element, not equal a unity element of a group, in a vector-column S m, elements, corresponding, by their numbers, to check matrix columns, containing one operation g , are excluded from a vector-row Yn; so, check elements, inserted into a message during a coding procedure, can be discarded.<br>
If vector-column STm demonstrates a presence of different elements, no one of which equal a unity element of a group, it means that there is an error in a received message and it's necessary to correct this error. For this purpose unity elements in a vector-column STm are changed for operations g1 and other elements are changed for operations g°. Than a changed vector-column STm is compared with matrix H columns, a number of its column, corresponding to a vector-column STm, is determined and a conclusion about an error presence in a symbol of a vector-row Yn with a number, coinciding with a number of a matrix H column, corresponding to a vector-column STm, is made. An error correction is done by adding an error symbol of a vector-row Yn to an element, inverse to any of elements, not equal a unity element of a group, of a vector-column STm (because in this case all elements of a vector-row STm, not equal a unity element of a group, are identical).<br>
If message elements belong to a ring with a unity, which corresponds to one of the variants for an additive Abelian group, operations g° degenerate into operations with a multiplication into a unity, operations g1 degenerate into operations with a multiplication<br>
into a zero and operations g2 degenerate into operations with a multiplication into a minus unity.<br>
If message elements belong to a residue class ring on the modulo q, which corresponds to one of the variants for a ring with a unity, an operation  is transformed into an operation of summing on the modulo q.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates an example of transmitting message Xk, consisting of four digits. An generating matrix of operations G is formed in accordance with the above-mentioned rule. In this case check columns are situated in first, second and fourth positions. After producing generalized matrix multiplication of a vector-row Xk into a matrix G an encoded message vector-row Y„, consisting of check symbols, situated in first, second and fourth positions, is formed.<br>
A demodulated message Yn is received with an error in the fifth position. So, producing generalized matrix multiplication of a check matrix H into a transposed vector-row Yn results in getting vector-column STm, corresponding to the fifth column of a check matrix H. Than decoding is done by discarding check elements, in particular by extracting elements of an initial message and changing the fifth element as a result of its adding to an element, inverse to one of non-unity elements in a vector-column Srm. A system for transmitting digital message is operated in the following way.<br>
Every element of a digital message Xk, formed with a corresponding source and consisting of consequently transmitted code words with a size of k elements each, gets at an input of an encoder 1 and at information inputs of the first operative memory unit 16 and of the first group of calculation units, 12. This element starts the first pulse shape forming unit 7 and synchronizes the pulse generator 9. A pulse from an output of the first pulse shape forming unit 7 starts the first ring counter 11. The first counter 11 provides counting for pulses, coming at its input, and elements of a code word are stored in corresponding cells of the first operative memory unit 16. Every pulse, counted with the counter 11, transfers an operation code set, corresponding to a row of an additional matrix, from an output of the memory unit 8 to calculation algorithm control inputs of the first group of calculation units, 12. These codes get, for every calculation unit 12, to inputs of the decipher 42. In dependence on a type of an operation code, received in the decipher 42, this code opens the fourth switch and helps to transfer an element of a code word to an output of the accumulating adder 46, where this element is conversed in accordance with a rule g2 and transferred to a first input of the second gate OR, or the sixth switch with transferring code word element to a second input of the second gate OR and further to an input of the accumulating adder 46. In the accumulating adder 46 every next element is summarized with a sum of previous elements, in accordance with a rule for summing Abelian group elements, and forms a check element. After transferring a k-th element of a code word to an input of the first ring counter 11 a pulse is formed at its overflow output and this pulse resets the first operative memory unit 16 and transfers an information from outputs of the first operative memory unit 16 to first k memory cells of the second operative memory unit 19. At the same time this pulse, after getting at reset inputs of the first group, consisting of m calculation units, 12, opens, for each of these units, the fifth switch 47 and helps to transfer previously formed sums to calculation units, 17, where these values of check elements are conversed in accordance with a rule g1 and written into memory cells, from (k+l)-th to n-th, of the second operative memory unit 19. Pulses from an output of the generator 9 with a repetition frequency value,<br>
exceeding (k+l)/k times a repetition frequency value for elements in a code word, get at an information input of the second switch 13, which, being kept initially in a closed state, doesn't transfer them to an input of the first ring counter 20. The same pulses are transferred to an input of the first frequency doubling unit 10 which doubles a repetition frequency for coming pulses. Then pulses are transferred from an output of the unit 10 to an input of the ring counter 14. When a (2k+l)-th pulse is transferred (approximately in a middle of a time interval between a moment, when the last element of a current code word comes to an input of an encoder 1, and a moment, when the first element of a next code word comes to this input) to an input of the ring counter 14, a pulse is formed at an overflow output of the counter 14 and transferred to a counting input of the first flip-flop 18, changing a state of this flip-flop. A voltage signal of a "logical unity", formed at an output of the first flip-flop 18, is transferred to a direct input of the first gate AND 15. The first ring counter 20 hasn't begun to count, yet, and a voltage signal of a "logical zero" is kept at its overflow output: so, a voltage signal of a "logical unity" appears at an output of the first gate AND 15 and this signal helps to open the second switch 13. Pulses from an output of the generator 9 begins to come to an input of the first ring counter 20; as a result, a code appears at an information output of the counter 20 and this code is changed with every next counted pulse. This code, after getting at an address input of the second operative memory unit 19, initializes an information reset in its corresponding memory cell, using the same sequential number with a pulse, counted with the first ring counter 20, and k information and m check elements of a code word are transferred sequentially to an input of a modulator 2. After transferring a n-th pulse to an input of the first ring counter 20 a voltage signal of a "logical unity" is formed at its overflow output and this voltage signal changes a state of the first flip 18; so, a voltage signal of a "logical zero" appears at an output of the first gate AND 15 and this voltage signal closes the first switch 13 and stops getting pulses from an output of the generator 9 to an input of the second ring counter 20, which gets prepared for a next operation cycle.<br>
A modulated message is transferred from an output of a modulator 2 to an input of a transmitter 3 and further to a communication channel.<br>
A received message, after being transferred through a receiver 4, gets demodulated in a demodulator 5 and is transferred to an input of a decoder 6.<br>
Every element in a received code word gets, after being transferred to an input of a decoder 6, at information inputs of the third operative memory unit 29 and of the second group of calculation units, 26, starts the second pulse shape forming unit 21 and synchronizes the generator 23. A pulse from an output of the second pulse shape forming unit 21 starts the second ring counter 25. When the second ring counter 25 counts pulses coming to its input, elements of a code word are stored in corresponding cells of the third operative memory unit 29. Every pulse, counted with the counter 25, transfers an operation code set for a corresponding column of a check operation matrix from the memory unit 22 to calculation algorithm control inputs of the second group of calculation units, 26. These codes are conversed in each calculation unit 26 in the same manner as in a case of using calculation units 12. After transferring a n-th element of a code word to an input of the second ring counter 25 a pulse is formed at its overflow output and this pulse resets the third operative memory unit 29, transfers an information from its outputs to memory cells of the fourth operative memory unit 37 and from outputs of the second group of calculation units, 26, to inputs of the unit 30 for making decisions, of unit 31 for<br>
making decisions and of the calculation unit 32. If there is an error in a received message, a command is transferred from an output of the unit 30 for making decisions to a control input of the third switch 38 and this switch gets opened. Pulses from an output of the generator 23 with a repetition frequency, value of which is exceeded k/n times with a value of a repetition frequency for elements in a code word, get to an information input of the second switch 27, which, being kept initially in a closed state, doesn't transfer these pulses to an input of the second ring counter 39. The same pulses are transferred to an input of the second frequency doubling unit 24, which doubles a repetition frequency for coming pulses; pulses from an output of the unit 24 are transferred to an input of the second ring counter 28. When a [2(k+l)+l]-th pulse gets (approximately in a middle of a time interval between a moment, when the last element of a current code word comes to an input of a decoder 6, and a moment, when the first element of a next code word comes to this input) at an input of the ring counter 28, a pulse from an overflow output of the counter 28 is transferred to a counting input of the second flip-flop 36 and changes a state of this flip-flop. A voltage signal of a "logical unity" appears at an output of the second flip-flop 36 and this voltage signal is transferred to a direct input of the second gate AND 33. The second ring counter 39 hasn't begun to count, yet, and a voltage signal of a 'logical zero" is kept at its overflow output; so, a voltage signal of a "logical unity" appears at an output of the second gate AND 33 and opens the second switch 27. Pulses from an output of the generator 23 begins to come to an input of the second ring counter 39; as a result, a code appears at an information input of this counter and this code will be changed with every next counted pulse. This code is transferred through the just opened third switch 38 and, after getting at address input of the fourth operative memory unit 37, initializes an information reset it its cell with a sequential number, corresponding to a number of a pulse, counted with the second ring counter 39, and k information elements of a code word are transferred sequentially to a decoder output for a non-correctable error. Check elements are kept, as discarded, in memory cells of the fourth operative memory unit 37 and are changed in these cells for check elements of a next code word. After transferring a k-th pulse to an input of the second ring counter 39 a voltage signal of a "logical unity" appears at its overflow output and this voltage signal changes a state of the first flip-flop 36; then a voltage signal of a "logical zero" is formed at an output of the second gate AND 33 and this voltage signal closes the second switch 27 and stops getting pulses from an output of the generator 23 to an input of the second ring counter 39, which gets prepared for a next operation cycle.<br>
If there is an error in a received message, a command is transferred from an output of the unit 32 for making decisions to a control input of the third switch 38 and this command helps to open the switch 38 and to start the calculation unit 32. The calculation unit 32 determines an error value and its sequential number in a received message and, after transferring pulse to its synchronization input from an information output of the ring counter 39, transfers an error signal to an input of the calculation unit 35. In the calculation unit 35 an error signal is conversed in accordance with a rule g" and is summarized, in the adder 40, with a corresponding element of a received message, being transferred from an output of the fourth memory unit 37, in accordance with a rule for summing elements of an Abelian group; this operations permit to correct an error and to transfer a corrected message to a decoder output for correctable messages.<br>
The unit 30 for making decisions, the unit 31 for making decisions and the calculation unit 32 can be realized in a form of corresponding programs, written in an algorithmic language, for example QBASIC, and run with a help of a typical microprocessor.<br>
