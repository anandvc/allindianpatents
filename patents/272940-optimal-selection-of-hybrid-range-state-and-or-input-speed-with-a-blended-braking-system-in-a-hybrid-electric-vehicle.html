[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/985,228 filed on 11/3/2007, which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure relates generally to control systems for electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Known powertrain architectures include torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output member. One exemplary<br>
powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member. The output member can be operatively connected to a<br>
driveline for a motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Electric<br>
machines, operative as motors or generators, generate a torque input to the<br><br><br>
transmission, independently of a torque input from the internal combustion<br>
engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in<br>
an electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs<br>
from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the<br>
powertrain, including controlling transmission operating state and gear<br>
shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical<br>
power interchange among the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including torque and<br>
rotational speed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0095] A motorized vehicle has a powertrain system that includes an engine<br>
coupled to an electro-mechanical transmission selectively operative in one of a<br>
plurality of transmission operating range states and one of a plurality of engine<br>
states, an accelerator control, and an electrical energy storage device. A<br>
method for operating the vehicle includes determining a transmission input<br>
speed, operating the transmission using the transmission input speed, and<br>
providing a braking torque request to cause braking of the vehicle according to<br>
a scheme selected from the group consisting of a first braking mode and a<br>
second braking mode. The transmission input speed and the transmission<br>
operating range state are dependent on said braking torque request in the first<br>
braking mode, and wherein the transmission operating state, but not the<br>
transmission input speed, is dependent on the braking torque request in the<br>
second braking mode.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0028] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, FIG. 1 shows an exemplary electro-mechanical<br>
hybrid powertrain. The exemplary electro-mechanical hybrid powertrain<br>
shown in FIG. 1 comprises a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
hybrid transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine 14, and first and<br>
second electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The engine 14 and<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate power which can<br>
be transmitted to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14<br>
and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transmitted to the<br>
transmission 10 is described in terms of input torques, referred to herein as TI,<br>
TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as NI, NA, and NB,<br>
respectively.<br><br>
[0029] In one embodiment, the exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-<br>
cylinder internal combustion engine which is selectively operative in several<br>
states to transmit torque to the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can<br>
be either a spark-ignition or a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14<br>
includes a crankshaft (not shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of<br>
the transmission 10. A rotational speed sensor 11 is preferably present to<br>
monitor rotational speed of the input shaft 12. Power output from the engine<br>
14, comprising rotational speed and output torque, can differ from the input<br>
speed, NI, and the input torque, TI, to the transmission 10 due to torque-<br>
consuming components being present on or in operative mechanical contact<br>
with the input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a<br>
hydraulic pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0030] In one embodiment the exemplary transmission 10 comprises three<br>
planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28, and four selectively-engageable torque-<br>
transmitting devices, i.e., clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used<br>
herein, clutches refer to any type of friction torque transfer device including<br>
single or compound plate clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for<br>
example. A hydraulic control circuit 42, preferably controlled by a<br>
transmission control module (hereafter 'TCM') 17, is operative to control<br>
clutch states. In one embodiment, clutches C2 62 and C4 75 preferably<br>
comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches. In one embodiment,<br>
clutches C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled<br>
stationary devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br><br>
75 is preferably hydraulically applied, selectively receiving pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid via the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0031] In one embodiment, the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
preferably comprise three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not<br>
shown) and a rotor (not shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The<br>
motor stator for each machine is grounded to an outer portion of the<br>
transmission case 68, and includes a stator core with electrical windings<br>
extending therefrom. The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported<br>
on a hub plate gear that is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second<br>
planetary gear set 26. The rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly<br>
attached to a sleeve shaft hub 66.<br>
[0032] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br><br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NAand NB, respectively.<br>
[0033] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power, e.g., to vehicle wheels 93, one of which is shown in<br>
FIG. 1. The output power is characterized in terms of an output rotational<br>
speed, NO and an output torque, TO. A transmission output speed sensor 84<br>
monitors rotational speed and rotational direction of the output member 64.<br>
Each of the vehicle wheels 93, is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted<br>
to monitor wheel speed, VSS_WHL, the output of which is monitored by a<br>
control module of a distributed control module system described with respect<br>
to FIG. 2, to determine vehicle speed, and absolute and relative wheel speeds<br>
for braking control, traction control, and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0034] The input torques from the engine 14 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 (TI, TA, and TB respectively) are generated as a result of<br>
energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical<br>
energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The transfer<br>
conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor switch 38 is<br>
closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between the ESD 74<br>
and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric current<br>
flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM 19<br>
transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by transfer<br>
conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power to and<br>
from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31, in response to<br><br><br>
torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 to<br>
achieve the input torques TA and TB. Electrical current is transmitted to and<br>
from the ESD 74 in accordance with commands provided to the TPIM which<br>
derive from such factors as including operator torque requests, current<br>
operating conditions and states, and such commands determine whether the<br>
ESD 74 is being charged, discharged or is in stasis at any given instant.<br>
[0035] The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the torque<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality to achieve the input torques TA and TB. The power<br>
inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power electronics<br>
devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar transistors (not<br>
shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC power for powering<br>
respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, by<br>
switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar transistors form a<br>
switch mode power supply configured to receive control commands. There is<br>
typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar transistors for each phase of each of<br>
the three-phase electric machines. States of the insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors are controlled to provide motor drive mechanical power generation<br>
or electric power regeneration functionality. The three-phase inverters receive<br>
or supply DC electric power via DC transfer conductors 27 and transform it to<br>
or from three-phase AC power, which is conducted to or from the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 for operation as motors or generators via<br>
transfer conductors 29 and 31, depending on commands received which are<br><br>
typically based on factors which include current operating state and operator<br>
torque demand.<br>
[0036] FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control module<br>
system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall<br>
vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of the<br>
exemplary hybrid powertrain described in FIG. 1. The distributed control<br>
module system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes<br>
algorithms to control various actuators to achieve control objectives, including<br>
objectives related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and<br>
protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes<br>
an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br>
('UP) 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator may selectively control or direct operation of the electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid powertrain. The devices present in UI 13 typically include<br>
an accelerator pedal 113 CAP') from which an operator torque request is<br>
determined, an operator brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a transmission gear selector<br>
114 ('PRNDL'), and a vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The<br>
transmission gear selector 114 may have a discrete number of operator-<br>
selectable positions, including the rotational direction of the output member 64<br>
to enable one of a forward and a reverse direction.<br><br>
[0037] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other control<br>
modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter 'LAN') bus<br>
6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states of operating<br>
parameters and actuator command signals between the various control<br>
modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-specific.<br>
The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and<br>
multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned control<br>
modules, and other control modules providing functionality such as antilock<br>
braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple communications<br>
buses may be used to improve communications speed and provide some level<br>
of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication between individual<br>
control modules can also be effected using a direct link, e.g., a serial<br>
peripheral interface ('SPF) bus (not shown).<br>
[0038] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the powertrain, serving to<br>
coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and BPCM 21.<br>
Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 generates various commands,<br>
including: the operator torque request ('TO_REQ'), a commanded output torque<br>
('TCMD') to the driveline 90, an engine input torque command, clutch torques<br>
for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the<br>
transmission 10; and the torque commands for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, respectively. The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42 and provides various functions including<br>
monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and<br>
communicating control signals to various solenoids (not shown) thereby<br><br><br>
controlling pressure switches and control valves contained within the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0039] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and functions<br>
to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14 over a<br>
plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-directional<br>
interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque command<br>
from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input torque, TI,<br>
provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon monitored<br>
engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The ECM 23<br>
monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the engine<br>
input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission input<br>
speed, NI. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters which may include<br>
without limitation: a manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, throttle<br>
position, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. The engine load can<br>
be determined, for example, from the manifold pressure, or alternatively, from<br>
monitoring operator input to the accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23<br>
generates and communicates command signals to control engine actuators,<br>
which may include without limitation actuators such as: fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0040] The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated clutch<br><br><br>
torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and<br>
rotational output speed, NO, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic circuit 42 to<br>
selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0041] The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX.<br>
[0042] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19 and BPCM<br>
21 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising a<br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br><br><br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and serial peripheral interface buses. The<br>
control algorithms are executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the actuators, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are preferably executed at regular intervals, for<br>
example at each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing<br>
operation of the powertrain. However, any interval between about 2<br>
milliseconds and about 300 milliseconds may be selected. Alternatively,<br>
algorithms may be executed in response to the occurrence of any selected<br>
event.<br>
[0043] The exemplary powertrain shown in reference to FIG. 1 is capable of<br>
selectively operating in any of several operating range states that can be<br>
described in terms of an engine state comprising one of an engine on state<br>
('ON') and an engine off state ('OFF'), and a transmission state comprising a<br>
plurality of fixed gears and continuously variable operating modes, described<br>
with reference to Table I, below.<br><br><br>
[0044] Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. As an example, a first<br>
continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or M1, is selected by applying<br>
clutch C1 70 only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON ('Ml_Eng_On') or<br>
OFF ('MI_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode<br>
2, or M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to<br>
the carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of<br>
ON ('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off). For purposes of this<br>
description, when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to<br>
zero revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating.<br>
A fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output<br>
speed of the transmission 10, i.e., NI/NO, is achieved. For example, a first<br>
fixed gear operation ('Gl') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75.<br><br>
A second fixed gear operation ('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70<br>
and C2 62. A third fixed gear operation ('G3') is selected by applying<br>
clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by<br>
applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73. The fixed ratio operation of input-to-<br>
output speed increases with increased fixed gear operation due to decreased<br>
gear ratios in the planetary gears 24,26, and 28. The rotational speeds of the<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72, NA and NB respectively, are<br>
dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism as defined by the clutching<br>
and are proportional to the input speed measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
[0045] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and brake<br>
pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or more of<br>
the other control modules determine the commanded output torque, TCMD,<br>
intended to meet the operator torque request, TO_REQ, to be executed at the<br>
output member 64 and transmitted to the driveline 90. Resultant vehicle<br>
acceleration is affected by other factors including, e.g., road load, road grade,<br>
and vehicle mass. The operating range state is determined for the transmission<br>
10 based upon inputs which include a variety of operating characteristics of<br>
the powertrain. These include the operator torque request communicated<br>
through the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112 to the user interface 13.<br>
[0046] In some embodiments, the operating range state may be predicated on<br>
a powertrain torque demand caused by a command to operate the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 in an electrical energy generating mode or<br>
in a torque generating mode. In some embodiments, the operating range state<br>
can be determined by an optimization algorithm or routine which determines a<br>
preferential selection of the operating range state based upon inputs which<br><br><br>
may include: operator demand for power; battery state-of-charge; and<br>
operating efficiencies of the engine 14 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56, 72. The control system manages torque inputs from the engine<br>
14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 based upon pre-<br>
selected outcome criteria embedded in the executed selection routine, and<br>
system operation is controlled thereby to effectively manage resources<br>
commensurate with desired levels of ESD state-of-charge and fuel delivery.<br>
Moreover, operation can be determined, including over-riding of any desired<br>
feature(s), based upon detection of a fault in one or more components or sub-<br>
systems. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-generative devices, and determines<br>
the power output from the transmission 10 required to achieve the output<br>
torque necessary to meet the operator torque request. The ESD 74 and the<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are electrically-operatively<br>
coupled for power flow therebetween. Furthermore, the engine 14, the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, and the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively coupled to transmit power<br>
therebetween to generate a power flow to the output member 64.<br>
[0047] Given various operating conditions possible for a motorized vehicle<br>
equipped with an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission, which include<br>
varied environmental and road conditions such as road grade and operator<br>
torque demands, it is generally possible for an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission to be usefully operatively engaged potentially in more than one<br>
operating range state, including such range states specified in Table I, at a<br>
given time during its operation. Moreover, it may be true that for every<br>
change in road grade, throttle opening, and brake pedal depression that a<br><br><br>
motorized vehicle comprising an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission<br>
experiences during the course of its typical travel, differing operating range<br>
states of the transmission and engine states of the engine may at any time be<br>
viewed as being advantageous in consideration of an overall balance between<br>
such factors including fuel economy, required torque output of the<br>
transmission, and state of charge of the ESD 74. At any one instant in time, a<br>
particular transmission operating range state and engine state may be<br>
desirable, advantageous or preferred, while at subsequent instants in time other<br>
transmission operating range states and engine states may be desirable,<br>
advantageous or preferred, with the result being that over even a relatively<br>
short time span of operation such as, for example, five minutes, conditions<br>
making dozens or more desirable, advantageous, or preferred transmission<br>
operating range states and engine states exist during such time span.<br>
However, this disclosure provides that altering the transmission operating<br>
range state and engine states in response to each and every single change in<br>
operating conditions encountered is not necessarily desirable in a motorized<br>
vehicle having an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission.<br>
[0048] FIG. 3 shows a control system architecture for controlling and<br>
managing signal flow in a hybrid powertrain system having multiple torque<br>
generative devices, described hereinbelow with reference to the hybrid<br>
powertrain system of FIGS. 1 and 2, and residing in the aforementioned<br>
control modules in the form of executable algorithms and calibrations. The<br>
control system architecture is applicable to alternative hybrid powertrain<br>
systems having multiple torque generative devices, including, e.g., a hybrid<br>
powertrain system having an engine and a single electric machine, a hybrid<br><br><br>
powertrain system having an engine and multiple electric machines.<br>
Alternatively, the hybrid powertrain system can utilize non-electric torque-<br>
generative machines and energy storage systems, e.g., hydraulic-mechanical<br>
hybrid transmissions (not shown).<br>
[0049] In operation, the operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and the<br>
brake pedal 112 are monitored to determine the operator torque request. The<br>
operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal 112 comprise<br>
individually determinable operator torque request inputs including an<br>
immediate accelerator output torque request ('Output Torque Request Accel<br>
Immed'), a predicted accelerator output torque request ('Output Torque<br>
Request Accel Prdtd'), an immediate brake output torque request ('Output<br>
Torque Request Brake Immed'), a predicted brake output torque request<br>
('Output Torque Request Brake Prdtd') and an axle torque response type<br>
('Axle Torque Response Type'). As used herein, the term 'accelerator' refers<br>
to an operator request for forward propulsion preferably resulting in increasing<br>
vehicle speed over the present vehicle speed, when the operator selected<br>
position of the transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the<br>
vehicle in the forward direction. The terms 'deceleration' and 'brake' refer to<br>
an operator request preferably resulting in decreasing vehicle speed from the<br>
present vehicle speed. The immediate accelerator output torque request, the<br>
predicted accelerator output torque request, the immediate brake output torque<br>
request, the predicted brake output torque request, and the axle torque<br>
response type are individual inputs to the control system. Additionally,<br>
operation of the engine 14 and the transmission 10 are monitored to determine<br>
the input speed ('Ni') and the output speed ('No'). The immediate accelerator<br><br><br>
output torque request is determined based upon a presently occurring operator<br>
input to the accelerator pedal 113, and comprises a request to generate an<br>
immediate output torque at the output member 64 preferably to accelerate the<br>
vehicle. The predicted accelerator output torque request is determined based<br>
upon the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 and comprises an<br>
optimum or preferred output torque at the output member 64. The predicted<br>
accelerator output torque request is preferably equal to the immediate<br>
accelerator output torque request during normal operating conditions, e.g.,<br>
when any one of antilock braking, traction control, or vehicle stability is not<br>
being commanded. When any one of antilock braking, traction control or<br>
vehicle stability is being commanded the predicted accelerator output torque<br>
request remains the preferred output torque with the immediate accelerator<br>
output torque request being decreased in response to output torque commands<br>
related to the antilock braking, traction control, or vehicle stability control.<br>
[0050] The immediate brake output torque request is determined based upon<br>
a presently occurring operator input to the brake pedal 112, and comprises a<br>
request to generate an immediate output torque at the output member 64 to<br>
effect a reactive torque with the driveline 90 which preferably decelerates the<br>
vehicle. The predicted brake output torque request comprises an optimum or<br>
preferred brake output torque at the output member 64 in response to an<br>
operator input to the brake pedal 112 subject to a maximum brake output<br>
torque generated at the output member 64 allowable regardless of the operator<br>
input to the brake pedal 112. In one embodiment the maximum brake output<br>
torque generated at the output member 64 is limited to -0.2g. The predicted<br>
brake output torque request can be phased out to zero when vehicle speed<br><br><br>
approaches zero regardless of the operator input to the brake pedal 112. When<br>
commanded by the operator, there can be operating conditions under which<br>
the predicted brake output torque request is set to zero, e.g., when the operator<br>
setting to the transmission gear selector 114 is set to a reverse gear, and when<br>
a transfer case (not shown) is set to a four-wheel drive low range.<br>
[0051] A strategic control scheme ('Strategic Control') 310 determines a<br>
preferred input speed ('NiDes') and a preferred engine state and transmission<br>
operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des') based upon the output speed<br>
and the operator torque request and based upon other operating parameters of<br>
the hybrid powertrain, including battery power limits and response limits of<br>
the engine 14, the transmission 10, and the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72. The predicted accelerator output torque request and the predicted<br>
brake output torque request are input to the strategic control scheme 310. The<br>
strategic control scheme 310 is preferably executed by the HCP 5 during each<br>
100 ms loop cycle and each 25 ms loop cycle. The desired operating range<br>
state for the transmission 10 and the desired input speed from the engine 14 to<br>
the transmission 10 are inputs to the shift execution and engine start/stop<br>
control scheme 320.<br>
[0052] The shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320<br>
commands changes in the transmission operation ('Transmission Commands')<br>
including changing the operating range state based upon the inputs and<br>
operation of the powertrain system. This includes commanding execution of a<br>
change in the transmission operating range state if the preferred operating<br>
range state is different from the present operating range state by commanding<br>
changes in application of one or more of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73,<br><br><br>
and C4 75 and other transmission commands. The present operating range<br>
state ('Hybrid Range State Actual') and an input speed profile ('Ni_Prof) can<br>
be determined. The input speed profile is an estimate of an upcoming input<br>
speed and preferably comprises a scalar parametric value that is a targeted<br>
input speed for the forthcoming loop cycle. The engine operating commands<br>
and the operator torque request are based upon the input speed profile during a<br>
transition in the operating range state of the transmission.<br>
[0053] A tactical control scheme ('Tactical Control and Operation') 330 is<br>
executed during one of the control loop cycles to determine engine commands<br>
('Engine Commands') for operating the engine 14, including a preferred input<br>
torque from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 based upon the output speed,<br>
the input speed, and the operator torque request comprising the immediate<br>
accelerator output torque request, the predicted accelerator output torque<br>
request, the immediate brake output torque request, the predicted brake output<br>
torque request, the axle torque response type, and the present operating range<br>
state for the transmission. The engine commands also include engine states<br>
including one of an all-cylinder operating state and a cylinder deactivation<br>
operating state wherein a portion of the engine cylinders are deactivated and<br>
unfueled, and engine states including one of a fueled state and a fuel cutoff<br>
state. An engine command comprising the preferred input torque of the<br>
engine 14 and the present input torque ('Ti') reacting between the engine 14<br>
and the input member 12 are preferably determined in the ECM 23. Clutch<br>
torques ('Tel') for each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75,<br>
including the presently applied clutches and the non-applied clutches are<br>
estimated, preferably in the TCM 17.<br><br><br>
[0054] An output and motor torque determination scheme ('Output and<br>
Motor Torque Determination') 340 is executed to determine the preferred<br>
output torque from the powertrain ('To_cmd')- This includes determining<br>
motor torque commands ('TA', 'TB') to transfer a net commanded output<br>
torque to the output member 64 of the transmission 10 that meets the operator<br>
torque request, by controlling the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
in this embodiment. The immediate accelerator output torque request, the<br>
immediate brake output torque request, the present input torque from the<br>
engine 14 and the estimated applied clutch torque(s), the present operating<br>
range state of the transmission 10, the input speed, the input speed profile, and<br>
the axle torque response type are inputs. The output and motor torque<br>
determination scheme 340 executes to determine the motor torque commands<br>
during each iteration of one of the loop cycles. The output and motor torque<br>
determination scheme 340 includes algorithmic code which is regularly<br>
executed during the 6.25 ms and 12.5 ms loop cycles to determine the<br>
preferred motor torque commands.<br>
[0055] The hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer the output torque to<br>
the output member 64 to react with the driveline 90 to generate tractive torque<br>
at wheel(s) 93 to forwardly propel the vehicle in response to the operator input<br>
to the accelerator pedal 113 when the operator selected position of the<br>
transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the vehicle in the<br>
forward direction. Similarly, the hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer<br>
the output torque to the output member 64 to react with the driveline 90 to<br>
generate tractive torque at wheel(s) 93 to propel the vehicle in a reverse<br>
direction in response to the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 when<br><br><br>
the operator selected position of the transmission gear selector 114 commands<br>
operation of the vehicle in the reverse direction. Preferably, propelling the<br>
vehicle results in vehicle acceleration so long as the output torque is sufficient<br>
to overcome external loads on the vehicle, e.g., due to road grade,<br>
aerodynamic loads, and other loads.<br>
[0056] FIG. 4 details signal flow in the strategic optimization control scheme<br>
310, which includes a strategic manager 220, an operating range state analyzer<br>
260, and a state stabilization and arbitration block 280 to determine the<br>
preferred input speed ('NiDes') and the preferred transmission operating<br>
range state ('Hybrid Range State Des'). The strategic manager ('Strategic<br>
Manager') 220 monitors the output speed No, the predicted accelerator output<br>
torque request ('Output Torque Request Accel Prdtd'), the predicted brake<br>
output torque request ('Output Torque Request Brake Prdtd'), and available<br>
battery power PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX. The strategic manager 220 determines<br>
which of the transmission operating range states are allowable, and determines<br>
output torque requests comprising a strategic accelerator output torque request<br>
('Output Torque Request Accel Strategic') and a strategic net output torque<br>
request ('Output Torque Request Net Strategic'), all of which are input the<br>
operating range state analyzer 260 along with system inputs ('System Inputs')<br>
and power cost inputs ('Power Cost Inputs'), and any associated penalty costs<br>
('Penalty Costs') for operating outside of predetermined limits. The operating<br>
range state analyzer 260 generates a preferred power cost ('P*cost') and<br>
associated input speed ('N*i') for each of the allowable operating range states<br>
based upon the operator torque requests, the system inputs, the available<br>
battery power and the power cost inputs. The preferred power costs and<br><br><br>
associated input speeds for the allowable operating range states are input to the<br>
state stabilization and arbitration block 280 which selects the preferred<br>
operating range state and preferred input speed based thereon. The operating<br>
range state analyzer 260 executes searches in each candidate operating range<br>
state comprising the allowable ones of the operating range states, including<br>
Ml (262), M2 (264), Gl (270), G2 (272), G3 (274), and G4 (276) to<br>
determine preferred operation of the torque actuators, i.e., the engine 14 and<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in this embodiment. The<br>
preferred operation preferably comprises a minimum power cost for operating<br>
the hybrid powertrain system and an associated engine input for operating in<br>
the candidate operating range state in response to the operator torque request.<br>
The associated engine input comprises at least one of a preferred engine input<br>
speed ('Ni*'), a preferred engine input power ('Pi*'), and a preferred engine<br>
input torque ('Ti*') that is responsive to and preferably meets the operator<br>
torque request. The operating range state analyzer 260 evaluates Ml-Engine-<br>
off (264) and M2-Engine-off (266) to determine a preferred cost ('P*cost') for<br>
operating the powertrain system responsive to and preferably meeting the<br>
operator torque request when the engine 14 is in the engine-off state.<br>
[0057] Fig. 6 schematically shows signal flow for the 1 -dimension search<br>
scheme 610. A range of one controllable input, in this embodiment<br>
comprising minimum and maximum input torques ('TiMin/Max'), is input to a<br>
1-D search engine 415. The 1-D search engine 415 iteratively generates<br>
candidate input torques ('Ti(j)') which range between the minimum and<br>
maximum input torques, each which is input to an optimization function ('Opt<br>
To/Ta/Tb') 440, for n search iterations. Other inputs to the optimization<br><br><br>
function 440 include system inputs preferably comprise parametric states for<br>
battery power, clutch torques, electric motor operation, transmission and<br>
engine operation, the specific operating range state and the operator torque<br>
request. The optimization function 440 determines transmission operation<br>
comprising an output torque, motor torques, and associated battery powers<br>
('To(j), Ta(j), Tb(j), Pbat(j), Pa(j), Pb(j)') associated with the candidate input<br>
torque based upon the system inputs in response to the operator torque request<br>
for the candidate operating range state. The output torque, motor torques, and<br>
associated battery powers and power cost inputs are input to a cost function<br>
450, which executes to determine a power cost ('Pcost(j)') for operating the<br>
powertrain in the candidate operating range state at the candidate input torque<br>
in response to the operator torque request. The 1-D search engine 415<br>
iteratively generates candidate input torques over the range of input torques<br>
and determines the power costs associated therewith to identify a preferred<br>
input torque ('Ti*') and associated preferred cost ('P*cost'). The preferred<br>
input torque ('Ti*') comprises the candidate input torque within the range of<br>
input torques that results in a minimum power cost of the candidate operating<br>
range state, i.e., the preferred cost.<br>
[0058] Fig. 7 shows the preferred operation in each of continuously variable<br>
modes Ml and M2 executed in blocks 262 and 264 of the operating range state<br>
analyzer 260. This includes executing a 2-dimensional search scheme 620,<br>
shown with reference to Figs. 6 and 8, in conjunction with executing a 1-<br>
dimensional search using the 1-dimensional search scheme 610 based upon a<br>
previously determined input speed which can be arbitrated ('Input Speed<br>
Stabilization and Arbitration') 615 to determine preferred costs ('P*cost') and<br><br><br>
associated preferred input speeds ('N*i') for the operating range states. As<br>
described with reference to Fig. 8, the 2-dimensional search scheme 620<br>
determines a first preferred cost ('2D P*cost') and an associated first preferred<br>
input speed ('2D NT). The first preferred input speed is input to the 2-<br>
dimensional search scheme 620 and to an adder. The adder sums the first<br>
preferred input speed and a time-rate change in the input speed ('NI_DOT')<br>
multiplied by a predetermined time period ('dt'). The resultant is input to a<br>
switch 605 along with the first preferred input speed determined by the 2-<br>
dimensional search scheme 620. The switch 605 is controlled to input either<br>
the resultant from the adder or the preferred input speed determined by the 2-<br>
dimensional search scheme 620 into the 1-dimensional search scheme 610.<br>
The switch 605 is controlled to input the preferred input speed determined by<br>
the 2-dimensional search scheme 620 into the 1 -dimensional search scheme<br>
610 (as shown) when the powertrain system is operating in a regenerative<br>
braking mode, e.g., when the operator torque request includes a request to<br>
generate an immediate output torque at the output member 64 to effect a<br>
reactive torque with the driveline 90 which preferably decelerates the vehicle.<br>
The switch 605 is controlled to a second position (not shown) to input the<br>
resultant from the adder when the operator torque request does not include<br>
regenerative braking. The 1-dimensional search scheme 610 is executed to<br>
determine a second preferred cost ('ID P*cost') using the 1-dimensional<br>
search scheme 610, which is input to the input speed stabilization and<br>
arbitration block 615 to select a final preferred cost and associated preferred<br>
input speed.<br><br>
[0059] Fig. 8 schematically shows signal flow for the 2-dimension search<br>
scheme 620. Ranges of two controllable inputs, in this embodiment<br>
comprising minimum and maximum input speeds ('NiMin/Max') and<br>
minimum and maximum input powers ('PiMin/Max'), are input to a 2-D<br>
search engine 410. In another embodiment, the two controllable inputs can<br>
comprise minimum and maximum input speeds and minimum and maximum<br>
input torques. The 2-D search engine 410 iteratively generates candidate<br>
input speeds ('Ni(j)') and candidate input powers ('Pi(j)') which range<br>
between the minimum and maximum input speeds and powers. The candidate<br>
input power is preferably converted to a candidate input torque ('Ti(j)') (412).<br>
Each candidate input speed ('Ni(j)') and candidate input torque ('Ti(j)') are<br>
input to an optimization function ('Opt To/Ta/Tb') 440, for n search iterations.<br>
Other inputs to the optimization function 440 include system inputs preferably<br>
comprising parametric states for battery power, clutch torques, electric motor<br>
operation, transmission and engine operation, the specific operating range<br>
state and the operator torque request. The optimization function 440<br>
determines transmission operation comprising an output torque, motor torques,<br>
and associated battery powers ('To(j), Ta(j), Tb(j), Pbat(j), Pa(j), Pb(j)')<br>
associated with the candidate input power and candidate input speed based<br>
upon the system inputs and the operating torque request for the candidate<br>
operating range state. The output torque, motor torques, and associated<br>
battery powers and power cost inputs are input to a cost function 450, which<br>
executes to determine a power cost ('Pcost(j)') for operating the powertrain at<br>
the candidate input power and candidate input speed in response to the<br>
operator torque request in the candidate operating range state. The 2-D search<br><br><br>
engine 410 iteratively generates the candidate input powers and candidate<br>
input speeds over the range of input speeds and range of input powers and<br>
determines the power costs associated therewith to identify a preferred input<br>
power ('P*') and preferred input speed('Ni*') and associated preferred cost<br>
('P*cost'). The preferred input power ('P*') and preferred input speed ('N*')<br>
comprises the candidate input power and candidate input speed that result in a<br>
minimum power cost for the candidate operating range state.<br>
[0060] Fig. 9 schematically shows power flow and power losses through<br>
hybrid powertrain system, in context of the exemplary powertrain system<br>
described above. There is a first power flow path from a fuel storage system 9<br>
which transfers fuel power ('PFUEL') to the engine 14 which transfers input<br>
power ('PI') to the transmission 10. The power loss in the first flow path<br>
comprises engine power losses ('PLOSS ENG')- There is a second power flow<br>
path which transfers electric power ('PBATT') from the ESD 74 to the TPIM 19<br>
which transfers electric power ('PIN ELEC') to the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 which transfer motor power ('PMOTOR MECH ') to the<br>
transmission 10. The power losses in the second power flow path include<br>
battery power losses ('PLoss BATT') and electric motor power losses ('PLoss<br>
MOTOR')- The TPIM 19 has an electric power load ('PHV LOAD') that services<br>
electric loads in the system ('HV Loads'), which can include a low voltage<br>
battery storage system (not shown). The transmission 10 has a mechanical<br>
inertia power load input ('PINERTIA') in the system ('Inertia Storage') that<br>
preferably include inertias from the engine 14 and the transmission 10. The<br>
transmission 10 has a mechanical power losses ('PLOSS MECH') and power<br><br>
output ('POUT') which can be affected by brake power losses ('PLOSS BRAKE')<br>
when being transferred to the driveline in the form of axle power ('PAXLE')-<br>
[0061] The power cost inputs to the cost function 450 are determined based<br>
upon factors related to vehicle driveability, fuel economy, emissions, and<br>
battery usage. Power costs are assigned and associated with fuel and<br>
electrical power consumption and are associated with specific operating points<br>
of the hybrid powertrain. Lower operating costs can be associated with lower<br>
fuel consumption at high conversion efficiencies, lower battery power usage,<br>
and lower emissions for each engine speed/load operating point, and take into<br>
account the candidate operating state of the engine 14. As described<br>
hereinabove, the power costs may include the engine power losses ('PLOSS<br>
ENG'), electric motor power losses ('PLOSS MOTOR'), battery power losses ('PLOSS<br>
BATT'), brake power losses ('PLOSS BRAKE'), and mechanical power losses<br>
('PLOSS MECH') associated with operating the hybrid powertrain at a specific<br>
operating point which includes input speed, motor speeds, input torque, motor<br>
torques, a transmission operating range state and an engine state.<br>
[0062] A preferred operating cost (PCOST) can be determined by calculating a<br>
total powertrain system power loss PLOSS TOTAL and a corresponding cost<br>
penalty. The total system power loss PLOSS TOTAL comprises all powertrain<br>
system power losses and includes the engine power losses PLOSS ENG, electric<br>
motor power losses PLOSS MOTOR, battery power losses PLOSS BATT, brake power<br>
losses PLOSS BRAKE, and mechanical power losses PLOSS MECH.<br>
[0063] The engine power loss in the engine 14 includes power losses due to<br>
fuel economy, exhaust emissions, losses in the mechanical system (e.g., gears,<br>
pumps, belts, pulleys, valves, chains), losses in the electrical system (e.g., wire<br><br><br>
impedances and switching and solenoid losses), and heat losses. The engine<br>
power loss can be determined for each operating range state based upon input<br>
speed and input torque and/or input speed and input power.<br>
[0064] Thus, in fixed gear operation, i.e., in one of the fixed gear operating<br>
ranges states of G1, G2, G3 and G4 for the embodiment described herein, the<br>
power cost input comprising the mechanical power loss to the cost function<br>
450 can be predetermined outside of the 1-dimension search scheme 610. In<br>
mode operation, i.e., in one of the mode operating ranges states of Ml and M2<br>
for the embodiment described herein, the power cost input comprising the<br>
mechanical power loss to the cost function 450 can be determined during each<br>
iteration of the search scheme 620.<br>
[0065] The state stabilization and arbitration block 280 selects a preferred<br>
transmission operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des') which<br>
preferably is the transmission operating range state associated with the<br>
minimum preferred cost for the allowed operating range states output from the<br>
operating range state analyzer 260, taking into account factors related to<br>
arbitrating effects of changing the operating range state on the operation of the<br>
transmission to effect stable powertrain operation. The preferred input speed<br>
('Ni_Des') is the engine input speed associated with the preferred engine input<br>
comprising the preferred engine input speed ('Ni*'), the preferred engine input<br>
power ('Pi*'), and the preferred engine input torque ('Ti*,) that is responsive<br>
to and preferably meets the operator torque request for the selected preferred<br>
transmission operating range state.<br>
[00661 The cost information used in the cost function of each iteration loop<br>
in some embodiments comprises operating costs, in terms of energy usage,<br><br><br>
which are generally determined based upon factors related to vehicle<br>
drivability, fuel economy, emissions, and battery life for the operating range<br>
state. Furthermore, costs may be assigned and associated with fuel and<br>
electrical power consumption associated with a specific operating point of the<br>
powertrain system for the vehicle. Lower operating costs are generally<br>
associated with lower fuel consumption at high conversion efficiencies, lower<br>
battery power usage, and lower emissions for an operating point, and take into<br>
account a current operating range state of the powertrain system. The<br>
optimum operating cost (PCOST*) can be determined by calculating a total<br>
powertrain system loss, comprising an overall system power loss and a cost<br>
penalty, such as can be associated with controlling battery state of charge.<br>
The overall system power loss comprises a term based upon engine power loss<br>
driven by fuel economy and exhaust emissions, plus losses in the mechanical<br>
system (e.g., gears, pumps, belts, pulleys, valves, chains), losses in the<br>
electrical system (e.g., wire impedances and switching and solenoid losses),<br>
and heat losses. Other losses to be considered may include electrical machine<br>
power losses, and factors related to battery life due to depth of discharge of the<br>
ESD 74, current ambient temperatures and their effect on state of charge of the<br>
battery. Due to subjective constraints imposed on a system such as that herein<br>
described, the transmission operating range state selected may not in all cases<br>
be that which is truly optimal from the standpoint of energy usage and power<br>
losses. At any one instant in time, a particular transmission operating range<br>
state and engine state may be desirable, advantageous or preferred, while at<br>
subsequent instants in time other transmission operating range states and<br>
engine states may be desirable, advantageous or preferred, with the result<br><br><br>
being that over even a relatively short time span of operation such as, for<br>
example, five minutes, conditions making dozens or more desirable,<br>
advantageous, or preferred transmission operating range states and engine<br>
states exist during such time span. However, this disclosure provides that<br>
altering the transmission operating range state and engine states in response to<br>
each and every single change in operating conditions encountered is not<br>
necessarily desirable in a motorized vehicle having an electro-mechanical<br>
hybrid transmission.<br>
[0067] Given various operating conditions possible for a motorized vehicle<br>
equipped with an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission, which include<br>
varied environmental and road conditions such as road grade and operator<br>
torque demands, it is generally possible for an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission to be usefully operatively engaged potentially in more than one<br>
transmission operating range state, including such range states specified in<br>
Table I, at a given time during its operation. Moreover, it may be true that for<br>
every change in road grade, accelerator pedal position, and brake pedal<br>
depression that a motorized vehicle including an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission experiences during the course of its typical travel, differing<br>
transmission operating range state and engine states of the engine may at any<br>
time be viewed as being advantageous in consideration of an overall balance<br>
between such factors including fuel economy, required torque output of the<br>
transmission, and state-of-charge of the ESD 74.<br>
[0068] According to one embodiment of this disclosure, FIG. 10 shows a<br>
first plurality of numerical values, each of which represents a preferability<br>
factor for each of the potential operating range states of an electro-mechanical<br><br><br>
hybrid transmission, and potential engine states for the engine, including the<br>
operating range states and engine states specified in Table I. In FIG. 10, the<br>
designations M1 and M2 refer to mode 1 and mode 2 of the electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid transmission. For purposes of the disclosure, the term<br>
'candidate operating range state' can be used interchangeably with 'potential<br>
operating range state' and the term 'candidate engine state' can be used<br>
interchangeably with 'potential engine state'. The designations G1, G2, G3,<br>
and G4 refer to gear 1, gear 2, gear 3, and gear 4, respectively, and HEOff<br>
refers to the engine state, which engine state is either engine-on or engine-off.<br>
In one embodiment of this disclosure, any one or more such preferability<br>
factors may be arbitrarily assigned. In another embodiment, any one or more<br>
of such preferability factors may comprise an output generated as a result of<br>
any algorithmic or other data processing method which has as an input or basis<br>
any information provided by any one or more sensors disposed at any location<br>
on a motorized vehicle equipped with such an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission, or disposed on, at, or near any portion of its drive train where<br>
data may be acquired. Such sensors may include without limitation: a wheel<br>
speed sensor 94, an output speed sensor 84, and a rotational speed sensor 11.<br>
[0069] It is desired that the preferability factors provided for each of the<br>
transmission operating range states and engine state shown in FIG. 10 are<br>
maintained in association with their respective transmission operating range<br>
state and engine state, and according to one embodiment of this disclosure<br>
such preferability factors are set forth in an array, as shown in FIG. 10. This<br>
arrangement is not a strict requirement, but is of convenience when<br><br>
performing a method according to this disclosure, as shown and described in<br>
relation to FIG. 11.<br>
[0070] This disclosure also provides a plurality of numerical values, each of<br>
which is associated with one of the possible operating range states and engine<br>
states of an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission at any selected point in<br>
time while in service in a motorized vehicle, such as during operation while a<br>
vehicle is traveling on a road surface, which plurality may be referred to as<br>
current operating range state values. Preferred embodiments include a<br>
numerical value associated with the engine state. This second plurality of<br>
numerical values are shown arranged in an array in FIG. 11 labeled as "current<br>
operating range factors" which includes numerical values for both the<br>
transmission operating range state and the engine state.<br>
[0671] FIG. 11 illustrates how the numerical values of the first plurality of<br>
preferability factors from FIG. 10 may be combined with the second plurality<br>
of preferability factors from the current operating range state and engine state.<br>
In one embodiment, the combination is made by summing the numerical<br>
values from each corresponding operating range state and engine state in each<br>
array, to arrive at a third array that comprises preferability factors for each<br>
possible transmission operating range state and engine state, which is labeled<br>
"new desired operating range factors". As used herein, a desired operating<br>
range state refers to a transmission operating range state or engine state that is,<br>
for one reason or another, generally relating to drivability, but may relate to<br>
engine economy, emissions or battery life, more desirable than the current<br>
transmission operating range state and/or engine state. The numerical values<br>
present in the third array may be compared to one another, and in one<br><br>
embodiment the lowest numerical value present in the third array represents<br>
the transmission operating range state or engine state which is to be selected or<br>
evaluated for selection as a basis upon which to make a change in operating<br>
state of the electro-mechanical hybrid transmission while a motorized vehicle<br>
containing same is in operation. For example, in the third array in FIG. 11, the<br>
lowest numerical value is 7, corresponding to M1 operation of the electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid transmission, whereas the current operating range state for<br>
the transmission is M2, evidenced by the zero in the current operating range<br>
array being the lowest numerical value. In one illustrative, non-limiting<br>
exemplary embodiment, a signal would be sent to a shift execution module<br>
embedded in the TCM 17, suggesting a change of transmission operating<br>
range state from M2 to M1, which may be effected by the TCM. In alternate<br>
embodiments, the TCM may be provided with additional decision-making data<br>
and algorithms to either accept and execute a suggested command change<br>
resulting from a process according to this disclosure, or it may deny such<br>
execution, based on other factors programmed into the TCM 17 which can be<br>
arbitrary in one embodiment, and in other embodiments are based on the<br>
output of one or more algorithms having inputs provided by on-board vehicle<br>
sensors. In one embodiment of the disclosure, the TCM 17 provides current<br>
operating range factors, which may be in the same format that the numerical<br>
values for the second plurality of preferability factors are in. In other<br>
embodiments, the TCM 17 provides current operating range factors in any<br>
format different than that which the numerical values relating to the second<br>
plurality of preferability factors are in.<br><br>
[0072] In another embodiment, the first plurality of preferability factors<br>
described in reference to FIG. 10 may be combined with an alternative<br>
plurality of preferability factors, which are depicted in the array labeled as the<br>
"desired operating range factors" (which include numerical values for both the<br>
transmission operating range state and the engine state) in FIG. 11, to arrive at<br>
a third array comprising a set of preferability factors which are considered the<br>
"new desired operating range factors". The preferability factors comprising<br>
the desired operating range factors may be an output generated as a result of<br>
any algorithm or other data processing method of information provided by any<br>
one or more sensors disposed at any location on a motorized vehicle equipped<br>
with such an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission, or disposed on, at, or<br>
near any portion of its drive train where data may be acquired. Such sensors<br>
include without limitation: a wheel speed sensor 94, an output speed sensor<br>
84, and a rotational speed sensor 11. In another embodiment, the first plurality<br>
of preferability factors described in reference to FIG. 10 may be combined<br>
with both the preferability factors from the current operating range factors and<br>
the desired operating range factors to arrive at a third array comprising new<br>
desired operating range factors.<br>
[0073] In general, one or more of the preferability factors among the desired<br>
operating range factors will change over time, in response to changing<br>
operating conditions encountered by a motorized vehicle equipped with an<br>
electro-mechanical hybrid transmission, and the value of these factors may<br>
either increase or decrease during vehicle operation. For example, when a<br>
operator torque request upon encountering an uphill grade while traveling at a<br>
low speed, the preferability factor associated with G1 operation may be caused<br><br><br>
to decrease in value in response thereto. Similarly, when the vehicle operator<br>
makes a braking torque request upon encountering an downhill grade while<br>
traveling at a constant speed, the preferability factor associated with G1<br>
operation may be caused to increase substantially in value so that selection of<br>
the G1 operating range is essentially precluded.<br>
[0074] In FIG. 11, the numerical values in the arrays comprising the current<br>
operating range factors and the desired operating range factors are identical<br>
only for illustrative purposes, and in practice the numerical values present in<br>
these sets of preferability factors may differ from one another. For<br>
embodiments in which the first plurality of preferability factors from FIG. 10<br>
are combined with those of the desired operating range factors, a third array<br>
comprising preferability factors for a new desired operating range factors are<br>
provided, at least one of which factors are subsequently provided to a shift<br>
control module which may be embedded in the TCM 17. For instances in<br>
which the shift control module orders the execution of a change in<br>
transmission operating range state, engine state, or both, the preferability<br>
factors comprising the new desired operating range factors are communicated<br>
as an input to a process of this disclosure as the desired operating range factors<br>
in a subsequent iteration of a process as herein described, as it is desirable in<br>
such embodiments to repeatedly perform a method as described herein at any<br>
time interval desired or selected, which may be any interval between about 2<br>
milliseconds and about 300 milliseconds, including all intervals and ranges of<br>
intervals therebetween.<br>
[0075] In preferred combinations of preferability factors according to the<br>
disclosure, it is desirable to only combine preferability factors of like kind<br><br><br>
with one another, i.e., preferability factors relating to M1 may only be<br>
combined with other preferability factors which relate to M1, G2 with G2, and<br>
so forth. Although combination of arrays, each of which comprise a plurality<br>
of preferability factors according to one embodiment of this disclosure has<br>
been shown and described as involving the summation of such arrays, and<br>
selecting the least value present in an array as a value for consideration in<br>
making a change in the operating range of an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission, the present disclosure also includes embodiments in which the<br>
selection criteria is to choose the largest numerical value. In other<br>
embodiments, the combination of two or more arrays may include subtraction,<br>
division, or multiplication of the numerical values corresponding to each<br>
operating range present in the arrays so combined, to provide that one of the<br>
values emerges as unique or differentiable from the remaining values present<br>
as a result of such combination, each value representing a relative preferability<br>
of the engine state or transmission range state. Selection is then made basis<br>
the highest or lowest numerical value present, or any other differentiable<br>
numerical attribute, in each of such embodiments. For cases where two or<br>
more preferability factors present in a set or array which results from a<br>
combination of preferability factors as provided herein are identical or non-<br>
differentiable from one another, the selection of a transmission operating<br>
range from such non-differentiable values may be arbitrary, or may be set to<br>
any default selection desired.<br>
[0076] In one embodiment of the disclosure, the numerical values of the first<br>
plurality of preferability factors in the array shown in FIG. 10 may be selected<br>
to be of a size sufficient to provide a biasing effect when combined with<br><br><br>
numerical values present in either the desired operating range factors or<br>
current operating range factors as described in reference to FIG. 11. For<br>
convenience according to one embodiment, sets of such preferability factors<br>
from FIG. 10 may be provided and arranged in a matrix, as shown in Table II<br>
and Table HI below:<br><br>
Thus, a plurality of preferability factors for the current operating range factors<br>
may be provided from such matrix. Under such an arrangement, if the current<br>
operating range of the electro-mechanical hybrid transmission is M1, then<br>
numerical values from the first row are chosen as the numerical values for the<br>
array to be used in a combination of arrays as described herein. Arrays for the<br>
desired operating range factors may be selected from a matrix such as that<br>
shown in Table III, as representative of preferability factor values associated<br>
with the desired operating range state of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission and engine state.<br><br><br>
[0077] When combining arrays comprising current operating range factors<br>
and desirable operating range factors described in reference to FIG. 11 with a<br>
plurality of preferability factors as provided in reference to FIG. 10 according<br>
to this disclosure, the net effect is to stabilize the shifting of the transmission<br>
to both the desired operating range and the current operating range by<br>
inclusion of the preferability factors provided according to FIG. 10. Through<br>
judicious selection of the values in Tables II and III above, an unexpected<br>
benefit arises in that it is possible to select values which prohibit specific<br>
changes in operating range states of an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission. For example, a change in operating range from M2 to G4 may<br>
be permitted, whereas a change in operating range from M2 to G3 may be<br>
forbidden, the choices of which changes to permit or forbid being in control of<br>
the user of a method herein by their judicious selection of numerical values for<br>
the preferability factors. In general, it is desirable to avoid selecting non-<br>
allowed range states, whether based on output speed of the transmission or any<br>
other criteria selected by a user. In one embodiment, different potential input<br><br><br>
speeds for M1 and M2 operation of the transmission are considered over time<br>
in providing corresponding numerical values for these states in the first<br>
plurality of numerical values, independent of the desired transmission<br>
operating range state. According to one embodiment, a selection process<br>
involves consideration only of the input speed associated with the desired<br>
transmission operating state selected. In one preferred embodiment, the<br>
numerical value representative of the current transmission operating range<br>
state has a bias of zero. In other embodiments, the numerical value<br>
representative of the current transmission operating range state has a relatively<br>
small bias, and may be either positive or negative. Although shown as<br>
positive numerical values, a preferability factor according to the disclosure<br>
may be negative, since the net result of a process herein which combines the<br>
different preferability factors for the result specified depends generally on<br>
their relative magnitudes with respect to one another.<br>
[0078] The net effect of the stabilization of shifting events or changes of<br>
operating range of an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission according to this<br>
disclosure is illustrated in FIG. 12, which uses power loss as its ordinate;<br>
however, other units of ordinate may be employed as desired. In FIG. 12 the<br>
power loss associated with vehicle operation in G1 over time of varying<br>
operating conditions is shown by the dotted wavy line. As this power loss<br>
varies along the abscissa of time labeled as M1, it may be possible for other<br>
operating range states of the electro-mechanical hybrid transmission to be<br>
employed to advantage with respect to fuel economy, battery state-of-charge,<br>
total torque output, etc. However, given typical wide variance in torque<br>
demands over time by an operator, a plurality of shifting or transmission mode<br><br><br>
changes would adversely impact drivability of a vehicle so equipped. Hence,<br>
by the present incorporation of bias, by consideration of the preferability<br>
factors described, the power loss associated with vehicle operation in G1 over<br>
time of varying operating conditions may be moved upwards on the ordinate<br>
scale, to the corresponding solid wavy line, the amount of which bias is<br>
represented by the sum of factors A and B from the first row in Table II and<br>
Table HI respectively. The result of this with reference to FIG. 12 is that the<br>
transmission operating range remains in M1 until the power loss associated<br>
with operating in that mode, plus the bias amount, exceeds the power loss of<br>
operating in another operating range state, in this case G1, at which point a<br>
change in operating range state is effected, with the power loss throughout the<br>
depicted time interval following the path marked by solid circles.<br>
Accordingly, situations where excessive operating range state changes of an<br>
electro-mechanical hybrid transmission occur, are maintained at any desirable<br>
level, dictated by the preferability factors chosen, which can mean their<br>
minimization, as well as substantial or complete elimination. This result is<br>
also depicted in FIG. 13, which shows the transmission desired operating<br>
range state as ordinate, depicting the removal of what would have been<br>
deemed as an undesirable operating range state change tor some end-use<br>
applications of a vehicle equipped with an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission according to the disclosure.<br>
[0079] In one embodiment, the matrices, arrays, or other arrangements of<br>
preferability factors as described herein are caused to be present in or<br>
accessible to a microprocessor, in hard or soft memory, and the combinations<br>
described herein are preferably carried out using such a processing device,<br><br><br>
which then issues an output to a TCM 17 that itself employs such output as an<br>
input in its own decision-making process. However, any arrangement of the<br>
preferability factors in memory which is convenient for computing purposes<br>
may be employed, in addition to such matrices or arrays as herein described.<br>
Individual preferability factors may relate to, or be based upon any number of<br>
potential variables relating to vehicle operation, and include without limitation<br>
variables relating to energy usage, drivability, fuel economy, tailpipe<br>
emissions, and battery state-of-eharge, with information concerning such<br>
variables being provided in one embodiment, by sensors. In other<br>
embodiments, the preferability factors may be derived from or based on losses<br>
in a mechanical drive system, including losses due to belts, pulleys, valves,<br>
chains, losses in the electrical system, heat losses, electrical machine power<br>
losses, internal battery power loses, or any other parasitic loss in a vehicle<br>
system, taken either alone, or in combination with any one or more other loss<br>
or losses.<br>
[0080] FIG. 14 depicts an architecture including a microprocessor, which is<br>
capable of carrying out execution of a change of operating range state of an<br>
electro-mechanical hybrid transmission according to one embodiment of the<br>
disclosure. FIG. 14 shows microprocessor MP, having inputs of the current<br>
desired range preferability factors, and the preferability factors described in<br>
reference to FIG. 10. The microprocessor has an output, which is inputted to a<br>
transmission control module, TCM 17, which itself provides feedback to the<br>
microprocessor in the form of a plurality of current operating range state<br>
preferability factors. The TCM 17 is capable of providing a suggested shift<br>
execution command to the transmission 10.<br><br><br>
[0081] Operation of a vehicle equipped with an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission as herein described (including functionally-equivalent devices)<br>
also includes the transmission input speed, NI, which itself is subject to change<br>
as vehicle operating conditions encountered during travel of a motorized<br>
vehicle vary. After undergoing a change in operating conditions, it is true that<br>
in many cases a different transmission operating range state may become more<br>
desirably employed than the present or current transmission operating range<br>
state. In general, the transmission input speed NI are different for different<br>
transmission operating range states possible when the motorized vehicle is<br>
traveling at the same given speed, when different operating modes or<br>
transmission operating states are contemplated as being employed as alternate<br>
operative modalities for operating at a same given speed. Accordingly, a<br>
change in transmission operating state and/or engine state is desirably<br>
accompanied by a change in transmission input speed NI.<br>
[0082] FIG. 15 illustrates graphically one example of how the transmission<br>
input speed NI may vary over time when a vehicle equipped with an electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid transmission as herein described undergoes an exemplary<br>
change in operating range state from M1 to M2. The NI for M1 represents the<br>
current NI when the current transmission operating range state is M1. G2 NI<br>
and M2 NI represent the selected (desired) NI for the corresponding<br>
transmission operating range states. Since a direct change of operating range<br>
state from M1 to M2 is forbidden, the transmission must first pass through G2.<br>
During such a transition, the necessary transmission input speed NI is seen to<br>
first decrease when going from M1 to G2, then to increase slightly over time<br>
during brief operation in G2, after which a steep increase in NI is experienced<br><br><br>
in achieving M2 operation. Therefore, the path or "trip" that the transmission<br>
input speed NI is seen to go through is given by:<br>
(M1 N, - G2 NI) + (M2 NI - G2 NI)	[1]<br>
in which M1 NI is the transmission input speed for transmission M1 operation;<br>
G2 NI is the transmission input speed for transmission G2 operation, M2 NI is<br>
the transmission input speed for transmission M2 operation, and G2 NI is the<br>
transmission input speed for transmission G2 operation. By weighting the<br>
direction of change of N|, the total "cost" of the trip that the transmission input<br>
speed is seen to go through can be provided by a calculation of the type:<br>
TC = [ (M1 NI - G2 NI) * a + (M2 NI - G2 NI) * b ] * x	[2]<br>
in which the "*" character indicates a multiplication operation, and a and b are<br>
constants in which a is used for negative changes in NI and in which b is used<br>
for positive changes in NI. In alternate embodiments, a and b are varying<br>
parameters which are a function of the corresponding distance of the NI trip or<br>
the corresponding desired transmission operating range state. The variable x,<br>
a trip-direction weighting constant, is a subjective value which may be set or<br>
determined by the vehicle engineers. The determination of x takes into<br>
account whether a potential change in transmission operating range state first<br>
requires a shift up followed by a shift down, or whether it first requires a shift<br>
down, followed by a shift up, as shown in FIG. 15. If the required sequence is<br>
shift down, then shift up, then x is set to a subjectively-determined value c. If<br><br><br>
the required sequence is shift up then shift down, the x is set to a subjectively-<br>
determined value d. For the case illustrated in FIG. 15, the formula for<br>
determining TC is:<br>
TC = [ (M1 NI - G2 NI) * a + (M2 NI - G2 NI) * b ] * c	[3]<br>
By analogous arithmetic a trip costing factor (TC) may be readily provided for<br>
every potential change in transmission operating range state and engine state<br>
by consideration of the trip that the NI must pass for a given potential change<br>
in transmission operating range state and engine state at any point in time of<br>
the vehicle travel. Although the changes in NI shown in FIG. 15 follow a<br>
straight-line path for purposes of illustration, in actual operation the changes in<br>
NI may also follow curved paths during all or a portion of the transition,<br>
wherein the paths may be either concave-up or concave-down. As shown as<br>
occurring at different points in time in FIG. 15, the calculation of the NI values<br>
for M1, which in this example is the origin of the trip is that of the monitored<br>
current NI value, and the calculation of NI values for G2 and M2 operation,<br>
which represent the intermediate and final destinations of the trip, may be<br>
conducted simultaneously.<br>
[0083] FIG. 16 graphically illustrates how selected values of NI may vary<br>
over time for each transmission operating range state shown during the<br>
operation of a motorized vehicle equipped with an electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission as herein described. The current NI profile represents the<br>
monitored current NI values, which in this example is when the current<br>
transmission operating range state is M1. In one embodiment, the selected NI<br><br><br>
values (which may in alternate embodiments be desired NI values or required<br>
NI values) at various points in time are arbitrarily selected to yield the curves<br>
shown. In other embodiments the selected NI values at various points in time<br>
are based on the output of one or more algorithms having inputs provided by<br>
on-board vehicle sensors, which after manipulation such as by a<br>
microprocessor may provide curves similar or different to those shown in FIG.<br>
16. Importantly, as shown in FIG. 9, for each point in time Tx under<br>
consideration, there is associated with each of such curves a single point,<br>
which may be used as a basis for calculating the differences in rpm, labeled "A<br>
rpm" which differences in rpm are useful in determining a trip costing factor<br>
associated with every potential change in transmission operating range state<br>
for any desired point in time. While rpm is used herein to exemplify one<br>
implementation, other rotational speed metrics are equally applicable. In one<br>
embodiment, the A rpm values may be conveniently set forth in an array as in<br>
Table IV below:<br><br>
wherein the rpm differences associated with M2 involves the rpm difference<br>
M1 to G2 and G2 to M2 as earlier described. The M1 NI value used for the A<br>
rpm calculation is that of the current M1 NI value and not that of the selected<br>
M1 NI value. The values for the A rpm in Table IV are exemplary of those<br>
encountered when the transmission is presently in M1 operation, as the value<br><br><br>
of the A rpm for M1 is zero, which has a biasing effect that tends to maintain<br>
the transmission operating range state in M1, thus stabilizing the transmission<br>
operating range state with respect to M1 operation. In one embodiment, the<br>
values for the A rpm associated with each potential change in transmission<br>
operating range state, such as those provided in Table IV, are each next<br>
multiplied by the trip direction weighting constants a, b, c, d (which in<br>
alternate embodiments may be varying parameters which are a function of the<br>
corresponding distance of the trip, A rpm, or corresponding desired range)<br>
from the equation defining TC above for each associated potential change in<br>
transmission operating range state, to arrive at a new array comprising a<br>
plurality of Trips Costing factors (TC) representing preferability factors for<br>
each of the transmission operating range states that are effectively based on<br>
the input speed trip or profile associated with each potential change in<br>
operating range state of the transmission, of which the values in Table V are<br>
provided for exemplary purposes and are non-limiting of this disclosure:<br><br>
[0084] The preferability factors based on the input speed trip or profile<br>
("transmission input speed trip preferability factors") associated with each<br>
potential operating range state of the transmission as set forth in Table V may<br>
be combined as herein specified with other sets of preferability factors,<br>
including one or more sets of preferability factors shown in and described with<br>
reference to FIG. 11 towards generation of new desired operating range<br><br><br>
factors. The selected NI values at various points in time as shown in FIG. 16<br>
may be based on the output of one or more algorithms carried out in a<br>
microprocessor having one or more inputs provided by on-board vehicle<br>
sensors, including without limitation sensors mentioned herein. In some<br>
embodiments, transmission input speeds NI for M1 operation and M2<br>
operation are provided at selected intervals with regard to the desired<br>
operating range state of the transmission. In one embodiment, the NI value for<br>
M1 is selected by a microprocessor which searches and selects an NI value<br>
that is associated with the least power loss, which in this embodiment may<br>
serve as, or as a basis for determining the preferability factor for M1 operation<br>
from FIG. 10. At or at about the same time, the NI value for M2 operation is<br>
selected by a microprocessor which searches and selects an NI value that is<br>
associated with the least power loss, which in this embodiment may serve as,<br>
or as a basis for determining the preferability factor for M2 operation from<br>
FIG. 10. Slight changes in operating conditions can substantially alter the<br>
preferability factors, and could result in transmission operation that would<br>
attempt to change gears or modes too frequently, and the biasing or weighting<br>
of the preferability factors as herein described alleviates undesirably frequent<br>
shifting. For embodiments in which NI values for M1 and M2 are<br>
continuously provided at short time intervals on the order of milliseconds in<br>
response to changes in vehicle operating conditions, given that slight changes<br>
in operating conditions can substantially alter the preferability factors, it<br>
occurs that there may be wide fluctuations in the NI values for M1 and M2<br>
from one time interval to the next. Changing operating range state for every<br>
instance that a driving condition changed slightly would result essentially in a<br><br><br>
transmission which was nearly constantly attempting to change gears or<br>
modes, and the biasing or weighting of the preferability factors as herein<br>
described alleviates undesirably frequent shifting. Following generation of<br>
new desired operating range factors and selection of the desired operating<br>
range, the NI values for the desired operating range are evaluated for selection<br>
and it is frequently the case that the NI values may vary substantially from one<br>
interval to the next. It is accordingly desirable to "filter" the NI values, to<br>
remove noise, which noise comprises values that are very high above or below<br>
an average NI value owing to instantaneous fluctuation in the NI values during<br>
one or more short time intervals. In one embodiment, NI values for both M1<br>
operation, M2 operation and neutral are filtered, even though the values of<br>
only one of M1 or M2 are actually to be used at a given point in time, i.e., the<br>
system continuously provides NI values for both M1 and M2 operation. In<br>
such embodiment, while input speeds NI for M1 or M2 operation are provided<br>
continuously or at selected intervals, only the input speed NI associated with<br>
the desired mode (either M1 or M2) is used for creating a desired transmission<br>
input speed profile based on current vehicle operating conditions. After<br>
selection of a desired range state is made, the selected NI values for M1 and<br>
M2 are filtered to reduce noise, while filtering, when the desired range<br>
changes reset the filter of the mode of the desired range that it is transitioning<br>
to, in order that the initial output value is equivalent to the input value, as<br>
shown in FIG. 18. The suggested NI values depicted therein will eventually be<br>
used to create a profile of desired input speeds based on what range is desired.<br>
For example, when M1 is selected as the desired range, NI M1 is used as the<br>
desired NI profile, as soon as M2 becomes desired the profile will switch to<br><br><br>
suggested NI M2. This selective resetting is done so that when the system<br>
switches from one profile to another, the non-filtered suggested NI is used as<br>
the initial value. When filtering the suggested input speeds for noise<br>
reduction, only the suggested input speed of the desired mode is filtered. This<br>
allows the suggested input speed to reset when its mode is chosen.<br>
[0085] One consideration of operating a motorized vehicle that is equipped<br>
with an electro-mechanical hybrid transmission as described herein, is that the<br>
operator of such a motorized vehicle will at different times make different<br>
torque requests from the drivetrain (such as by depressing the vehicle<br>
accelerator or brake pedal). However, in many instances of operator torque<br>
requests, the vehicle drivetrain and/or braking system may be incapable of<br>
delivering the amount of torque requested by the operator, i.e., the brake or<br>
accelerator pedal may be depressed beyond the point at which the system<br>
capabilities to deliver the requested torque can be fulfilled. An accelerator<br>
pedal is one non-limiting form of an accelerator control.<br>
[0086] For different potential engine operating points in operating range<br>
states of the transmission, given the same operator torque request, the<br>
differences between the operator-requested torque and the vehicle drivetrain<br>
capabilities typically differ from one another. In one embodiment of this<br>
disclosure, the difference between the amount of torque requested by the<br>
operator at a given point in time and the torque that is deliverable by the<br>
system when operating at a potential engine operating point is considered for<br>
each of the engine operating points, to generate a plurality of torque difference<br>
values for each of the engine operating points at substantially the time that the<br>
operator makes a torque request. In one embodiment a biasing "cost" value is<br><br><br>
assigned to each of the torque difference values in proportion to the magnitude<br>
by which the deliverable torque for a given engine operating point in a<br>
potential transmission operating range state falls short with respect to that of<br>
the operator torque request. Such biasing cost values generally reflect a lower<br>
degree of desirability for engine operating points having higher biasing costs<br>
associated with them for a given operator torque request, when such biasing<br>
costs are compared with one another and used as a basis in evaluating which<br>
engine operating point is most suitable or desirable for a given operator torque<br>
request at a particular point in time of the vehicle operation. In one<br>
embodiment, the sum of all components representing power losses for various<br>
drivetrain components and this bias cost (comprising the total power loss) for<br>
each potential engine operating point at the torque deliverable that is nearest to<br>
that requested by the operator are compared with one another, with that<br>
potential engine operating point having the least total power loss when<br>
operated at the torque nearest that of the operator torque request being selected<br>
as the desired engine operating point.<br>
[0087] FIG. 19 shows a cost function useful in providing biasing costs<br>
indicating a component of preferability of a potential engine operating point<br>
and transmission operating range state, which is dependent on the magnitude<br>
of an operator torque request. The exemplary definition of a biasing cost<br>
graph in FIG. 19 is a generally-parabolic cost profile, having as its abscissa the<br>
operator torque request. Such a biasing cost profile may be determined by any<br>
function desired, selected, or created by the vehicle engineers, and accordingly<br>
affords an opportunity to include a subjective aspect in the determination of<br>
preferability of different engine operating points and potential transmission<br><br><br>
operating range states. Function types useful in this regard include without<br>
limitation: hyperbolic functions, linear functions, continuous functions, non-<br>
continuous functions, constant functions, smooth-curved functions, circular<br>
functions, ovoid functions, and any combinations comprising any of the<br>
foregoing, either alone or mathematically combined with one another, over<br>
any range of operator torque request values desired or selected. Thus, in one<br>
embodiment, criteria used in the determination of which engine operating<br>
point and transmission operating range state is most desirable for a given<br>
operator torque request at any selected point in time of the travel of a vehicle<br>
having a drivetrain as herein described is not necessarily bound to the most<br>
efficient operation of the motorized vehicle in terms of fuel economy, power<br>
output, drivability, etc.<br>
[0088] For each engine operating point in a potential transmission operating<br>
range state, there exists a minimum output torque (To Min) and a maximum<br>
output torque (To Max) that the drivetrain system is capable of delivering.<br>
The maximum output torque is generally applicable towards vehicle<br>
acceleration and includes such components as the engine input torque and<br>
motor torques from the first and second electric machines. The minimum<br>
output torque is generally applicable towards vehicle deceleration, and<br>
includes such components as braking torque provided during regenerative<br>
braking, including cases when the charging of a battery on-board the vehicle is<br>
accomplished, more or less, by one or more of the electric machines<br>
functioning in their capacity as electrical generators.<br>
[0089] With respect to FIG. 19, which represents a single engine operating<br>
point in a potential transmission operating range state, it is clear that for a<br><br><br>
substantial range of possible operator torque request values residing between<br>
TO Min and TO Max, there is no biasing cost associated therewith, i.e., the<br>
value of the function represented by the dotted line is zero. As the operator<br>
torque request approaches or exceeds the TO Max value, however, the cost<br>
associated with the operator torque request is given by the ordinate value<br>
along the dotted line curve corresponding to the operator torque request.<br>
Other potential transmission operating range states may have the same,<br>
similarly-shaped, or differently-shaped functions associated with them, as<br>
desired.<br>
[0090] In one embodiment, if the operator torque request is within a range<br>
between TO Min and TO Max where the biasing cost function represented by<br>
the dashed line curve in FIG. 19 is constant, in this case at zero, there is no<br>
biasing cost assigned for the particular engine operating point in the operating<br>
range state under consideration at levels of operator torque request residing<br>
within this range. When the operator torque request is for a torque that is<br>
greater than TO Max, the function determining the biasing costs associated<br>
with the torque request is represented by the dashed line in FIG. 11. This<br>
biasing cost may thus comprise a subjective component in addition to the<br>
objective costs associated with power losses in the determination of the engine<br>
operating point selection and the first plurality of numerical values shown in<br>
FIG. 10. Thus, in one embodiment, an operator torque request which only<br>
slightly exceeds that of TO Max, by, for example, 10 Newton-meters, will be<br>
assigned a biasing cost which is less than the biasing cost which would be<br>
assigned to an operator torque request which exceeds that of TO Max by more<br>
than 10 Newton-meters.<br><br><br>
[0091] Table VI below is exemplary of one way to express costs associated<br>
with the difference between a vehicle operator torque request and the<br>
maximum torque deliverable by the drivetrain system for an exemplary<br>
potential transmission operating range state, wherein ∆ N*m is the difference<br>
value in Newton-meters and kW is the cost, expressed in kilowatts in this<br>
example; however any other convenient units, or no units, may be used. Such<br>
an array may be stored in computer memory and accessed by a<br>
microprocessor, on an as-needed basis.<br><br>
[0092] An alternative representation of the biasing cost associated with a<br>
potential transmission operating range state is shown in FIG. 20. In FIG. 20,<br>
the value x represents the difference between the amount of operator torque<br>
request and that torque output which is desirable ("Desirable To") for a<br>
potential transmission operating range state, as but one example. The<br>
Desirable T0 is that amount of torque that is closest to the operator torque<br>
request that is available based on the output torque limits ( TO Max and TO<br>
Min) of the selected engine operating points and the Torque Reserve for the<br>
particular potential transmission operating range state under consideration.<br>
The quantity x, which is a torque difference value (∆ N*m), varies, depending<br>
on which potential transmission operating state is under consideration, for the<br>
same operator torque request at a same given point in time of vehicle<br><br><br>
operation. Comparison of x values for different potential transmission<br>
operating range states given the same operator torque request enables selection<br>
of that potential transmission operating range state having the least x value, in<br>
one embodiment. In another embodiment, a biasing cost (weighting factor)<br>
may be assigned to the potential transmission operating range state having the<br>
least x value, which is combined with the sum of all components representing<br>
power losses for various drivetrain components, to arrive at a sum total power<br>
loss which may then be used as a criteria for selecting a particular potential<br>
transmission operating range state over others.<br>
[0093] By providing a function having any desired features, including<br>
without limitation those features illustrated by the biasing costs curve in FIG.<br>
19, it is possible to assign a biasing cost to a given operator torque request for<br>
particular instances even when the torque requested in an operator torque<br>
request is below the maximum system torque output. This is illustrated by an<br>
operator torque request having the magnitude at point Q in FIG. 19, which is<br>
below the TO Max, yet there is nevertheless a cost assigned for this potential<br>
transmission operating range state and operator torque request. Such a<br>
provision of costing (or biasing) operator torque requests allows establishment<br>
of a Torque Reserve over the range of operator torque requests which reside<br>
between TO Max and the operator torque request having the highest magnitude<br>
of torque for which no biasing cost is assigned over a range between TO Min<br>
and TO Max. The provision of a range of operator torque requests comprising<br>
such a Torque Reserve effectively biases the preferability of the transmission<br>
control system against selecting system actuator operating points and<br>
transmission operating range states having a TO Max which is greater than, yet<br><br><br>
near to, an operator torque request in an amount that is proportional to the<br>
difference between the operator torque request and the TO Max for the<br>
particular engine operating point in a transmission operating range state under<br>
consideration. Instead of biasing to select system actuator operating points<br>
which can produce the highest TO Max and lowest TO Min, including the<br>
Torque Reserve has the effect of decreasing the bias criteria point TO Max to<br>
TO Max subtracted by the Torque Reserve. This will not only effect the<br>
operator torque requests which exceed the maximum deliverable output<br>
torque, but also the operator torque requests that are less than and near the<br>
maximum deliverable output torque. This results in improved drivability of<br>
the motorized vehicle by reducing the tendency of the transmission system to<br>
cause multiple shifting events or mode changes when an operator torque<br>
request has a magnitude that is near the maximum deliverable for the<br>
transmission operating range state that is currently selected, i.e., currently<br>
under utilization. In embodiments which follow, no Torque Reserve is<br>
present.<br>
[0094] Moreover, when an operator torque request exceeds TO Max (or is<br>
less than TO Min) for cases where a method according to this disclosure which<br>
so uses biasing costs is not employed, information relating to the amount by<br>
which an operator torque request exceeds TO Max (or is less than TO Min) is<br>
lost due to the fact that the total power loss evaluation is based on the<br>
deliverable output torque which is limited by TO Max and TO Min.<br>
Proceeding in accordance with a method of this disclosure and obtaining a<br>
biasing cost value for an operator torque request which exceeds TO Max (or is<br>
less than TO Min) provides information relative to the amount by which such a<br><br><br>
torque request is in excess of TO Max, and this information is incorporated<br>
into the overall selection process concerning which engine operating point and<br>
potential transmission operating state will be selected. In one embodiment,<br>
this information effectively biases a search engine embedded within software<br>
and/or hardware useful for providing the plurality of numerical values shown<br>
in FIG. 10 to locate an engine operating point within each potential<br>
transmission operating range state that biases towards providing the greatest<br>
value of TO Max (least value of TO Min). In one embodiment, the biasing<br>
costs associated with the operator torque request for each of the potential<br>
operating range states of the transmission substantially at the time an operator<br>
makes a torque request during vehicle operation are but one component used<br>
in determining a first plurality of numerical values as shown in FIG. 10.<br>
[0095] In one embodiment, the calculation of each of the numerical values<br>
present in the first plurality of numerical values shown in FIG. 10 include<br>
components relating to objective power losses such as: engine power loss,<br>
battery power loss, electrical machine power loss, and transmission power<br>
loss. Another embodiment provides additional penalty costs, including costs<br>
for exceeding the battery power limits, engine torque limits, electric machine<br>
torque limits, and other subjective costs desired which may include biasing<br>
costs associated with the output torque request as herein described. Also<br>
included are the components generated as the result of an iterative data<br>
processing method that in one embodiment employs a microprocessor-based<br>
search engine.<br>
[0096] A search engine suitable for such a method employs, for each<br>
continuously variable operating range state, a space that is defined as shown in<br><br><br>
FIG. 21 by the region on the coordinate axes bounded by PI Min, PI Max, NI<br>
Min, and NI Max, wherein PI represents power inputted to the electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid transmission and NI is the same transmission input speed.<br>
The search engine selects, either randomly or according to any desired<br>
algorithm, an NI and PI pair present in the space S and calculates a TO Min, TO<br>
Max and total power loss associated with the NI and PI pair chosen, based on<br>
drivetrain system component power losses and operating constraints, which<br>
constraints are either inherent in the system, or imposed by vehicle engineers.<br>
Repetition of this method for a large number of different NI and PI pairs<br>
provides a plurality of different TO Min, TO Max and total power loss values<br>
for a given potential continuously variable transmission operating range state<br>
from which NI and PI pairs from each potential continuously variable<br>
transmission operating state. The method is repeated for each potential<br>
transmission operating range state and a plurality of TO Min, TO Max, and<br>
total power loss values are generated in the space S of and for each potential<br>
transmission operating range state and NI and PI pairs provided.<br>
[0097] From such plurality of different TO Min and TO Max values so<br>
generated by a search engine for a given potential transmission operating<br>
range state, the NI and PI pair having the highest TO Max value associated with<br>
each potential transmission operating range state is biased to be selected as the<br>
preferred NI and PI, to reduce biasing costs associated with the output torque<br>
request in FIG. 19, which is one of the multiple components in the total power<br>
loss, when an operator torque request is greater than the plurality of different<br>
TO Max values generated. For cases in which an operator torque request is<br>
less than the plurality of different TO Min generated, the NI and PI pair<br><br><br>
associated with the lowest TO Min value is biased to be selected as the<br>
preferred NI and PI to reduce biasing costs associated with the output torque<br>
request in FIG. 19, which is one of the multiple components in the total power<br>
loss for the particular potential transmission operating range state under<br>
consideration. The hybrid Engine-Off state can be considered as continuously<br>
variable modes with the NI and PI as being zero; thus. TO Min, TO Max, and<br>
the total power loss are determined without the need for a search procedure.<br>
[0098] In the case of Fixed Gear range states, a search engine suitable for<br>
such a method employs, for each potential transmission operating range state,<br>
a space that is defined by the region on the coordinate axes bounded by TI<br>
Min, and TI Max, wherein TI represents torque inputted to the electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid transmission where the transmission input speed is pre<br>
determined by the hardware parameter of potential transmission operating<br>
range state. The search engine selects, either randomly or according to any<br>
desired algorithm, an TI present in the search range and calculates a TO Min<br>
and TO Max and Total Power Loss associated with the TI chosen, based on<br>
drivetrain system component power losses and operating constraints, which<br>
constraints are either inherent in the system, or imposed by vehicle engineers.<br>
Repetition of this method for a large number of different T, provides a<br>
plurality of different TO Min and TO Max and Total Power Loss values for a<br>
given potential transmission operating range state. The method is repeated for<br>
each potential transmission operating range state and a plurality of TO Min and<br>
TO Max and Total Power Loss are generated in the search range of and for<br>
each potential transmission operating range state and TI is provided.<br><br>
[0099] From such plurality of different TO Min and TO Max values so<br>
generated by a search engine for a given potential transmission operating<br>
range state, the TI having the highest TO Max value associated with each<br>
potential transmission operating range state is biased to be selected as the<br>
preferred TI, when an operator torque request is greater than the plurality of<br>
different TO Max generated. This reduces biasing costs associated with the<br>
output torque request in FIG. 19, which is one of the components in the total<br>
power loss for the particular potential transmission operating range state under<br>
consideration. For cases in which an operator torque request is less than the<br>
plurality of different TO Min generated, the TI associated with the lowest TO<br>
Min value is biased to be selected as the preferred TI to reduce biasing costs<br>
associated with the output torque request in FIG. 19, which is one of the<br>
components in the total power loss for the particular potential transmission<br>
operating range state under consideration.<br>
[00100] In one embodiment, including when a vehicle operator makes a<br>
request for an acceleration torque that is greater than the maximum deliverable<br>
output torque, following generation of a plurality of engine operating points<br>
(NI and PI pairs for continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears) for<br>
each potential transmission operating range state, which engine operating<br>
points (NI and PI pairs for continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears)<br>
each have associated with them a TO Min, TO Max, and total power loss<br>
values, the desired transmission operating range state is determined by<br>
comparing the points associated with the selected engine operating points (NI<br>
and PI pairs for continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears) from each<br>
potential transmission operating state with one another, and selecting that<br><br><br>
operating range state having the least total power loss associated with its point<br>
biased to the highest TO Max value, which corresponds to the least value of x<br>
in FIG. 20.<br>
[00101] In another embodiment, including when a vehicle operator makes a<br>
request for a deceleration torque that is less than the minimum deliverable<br>
output torque, following generation of a plurality of engine operating points<br>
(NI, PI pairs for continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears) for each<br>
potential transmission operating range state, which engine operating points<br>
(NI, PI pairs for continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears) each have<br>
associated with them a TO Min, TO Max, and total power loss values, the<br>
desired transmission operating range state is determined by comparing the<br>
points associated with the selected engine operating points (NI and PI pairs for<br>
continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears) from each potential<br>
transmission operating state which have the least total power loss with one<br>
another and selecting that operating range state having the least total power<br>
loss associated with its point biased to having the lowest TO Min value<br>
(corresponding to the least value of y in FIG. 20).<br>
[00102] In one embodiment, determination of the total power loss associated<br>
with vehicle operation at a point associated with or identified by an engine<br>
operating point (NI and PI pair for continuously variable modes and TI for<br>
fixed gears) in a potential operating range state of the transmission comprises<br>
combining operating costs, in terms of energy usage (kW), which operating<br>
costs are provided based upon factors related to vehicle drivability, fuel<br>
economy, emissions, electrical power consumption and battery life for the<br>
operating range state. Lower operating costs are generally associated with<br><br><br>
lower fuel consumption at high conversion efficiencies, lower battery power<br>
usage, and lower emissions for an operating point, and take into account a<br>
current operating range state of the powertrain system.<br>
[00103] Summation of all power losses (total power loss) associated with<br>
operating at a particular point that is associated with an engine operating point<br>
(NI, PI pair for continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears) of a<br>
potential transmission operating range state provides a preferability factor<br>
(including without limitation, those shown in FIG. 10) for operating at that<br>
particular point in the particular potential transmission operating range state<br>
under consideration. In the case when the operator torque request is greater<br>
than the torque deliverable by the driveline system, the point associated with<br>
an engine operating point (NI, PI pairs for continuously variable modes and TI<br>
for fixed gears) in the respective search space S or range associated with a<br>
potential transmission operating range state may be selected to be biased to a<br>
point at which the maximum output torque ( TO Max) of the transmission<br>
occurs for that potential transmission operating range state. Depending on the<br>
severity of the bias cost associated with the operator torque request, the<br>
selected point may or may not be that at which the maximum output torque<br>
occurs. Since the point selection is based on minimizing the total power loss<br>
where the bias cost associated with the output torque request is a component<br>
of, the larger the bias costs associated with the output torque request the<br>
greater is the advantage of selecting the point at which the maximum output<br>
torque of the transmission occurs. The search space S or range for each<br>
potential transmission operating range state may be examined, such as by<br>
algorithm, and the point associated with an engine operating point (NI, PI pair<br><br><br>
for continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears) at which the maximum<br>
output torque (TO Max) of the transmission is biased to occur identified for<br>
each potential transmission operating range state. The points associated with<br>
the engine operating point (NI, PI pair for continuously variable modes and TI<br>
for fixed gears) at which the maximum output torque ( TO Max) of the<br>
transmission is biased to occur for each potential transmission operating range<br>
state are compared with one another to identify the potential transmission<br>
operating range state having the lowest power loss that is likely to have the<br>
highest TO Max, which potential transmission operating range state is selected<br>
as being the best transmission operating range state when a vehicle operator<br>
makes a request for an acceleration torque, which is a torque request that tends<br>
to deliver more torque to the vehicle drive wheel(s) that are in contact with the<br>
road surface.<br>
[00104] Similarly, in the case when the operator torque request is less than the<br>
torque deliverable by the driveline system, the point associated with an engine<br>
operating point (NI, PI pair for continuously variable modes and TI for fixed<br>
gears) associated with a potential transmission operating range state may be<br>
selected to be biased to a point at which the minimum output torque (TO Min)<br>
of the transmission occurs for that potential transmission operating range state.<br>
Depending on the severity of the bias cost associated with the operator torque<br>
request, the point selected may or may not be that at which the minimum<br>
output torque occurs. Since the point selection is based on minimizing the<br>
total power loss where the bias cost associated with the output torque request<br>
is a component of, the larger the bias costs associated with the output torque<br>
request the more advantage there is to selecting the point at which the<br><br><br>
minimum output torque of the transmission occurs. The search space S, or<br>
range for each potential transmission operating range state may be examined,<br>
such as algorithmically using a microprocessor, and the point associated with<br>
an NI and PI pair at which the minimum output torque (TO Min) of the<br>
transmission is biased to occur identified for each potential transmission<br>
operating range state. The points associated with the engine operating point<br>
(NI, PI pair for continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears) at which<br>
the minimum output torque (TO Min) of the transmission is biased to occur for<br>
each potential transmission operating range state are compared with one<br>
another to identify the potential transmission operating range state having the<br>
lowest total power loss which is likely to have the lowest TO Min, which<br>
potential transmission operating range state is selected as being the best<br>
transmission operating range state when a vehicle operator makes a request for<br>
an deceleration torque, which is a torque request that tends to deliver less<br>
torque to the vehicle drive wheel(s) that are in contact with the road surface.<br>
[00105] According to one embodiment of this disclosure, for cases of operator<br>
torque requests which command heavy vehicle acceleration (levels of<br>
acceleration for which the operator torque request is greater than that<br>
deliverable by the driveline system and the pre-determined bias cost associated<br>
with the output torque request is severe enough to overrule all other<br>
components of the total power loss), determining the engine operating point<br>
(NI, PI pair for continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears) having the<br>
least power loss associated with them automatically results in determination of<br>
the NI and P( pair having the T0 Max, because the engine operating point (NI,<br>
PI pair for continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears) having the<br><br><br>
highest TO Max values associated with it, also has the smallest power losses<br>
associated with it. The converse is true for cases of operator torque requests<br>
which command vehicle deceleration.<br>
[00106] Hence, in a method according to an embodiment of the disclosure, an<br>
operator torque request is made during operation of a vehicle equipped with a<br>
system as herein described. A search engine embedded in an on-board<br>
microprocessor chooses a first engine operating point (NI, PI pair for<br>
continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears) from the search space S or<br>
range associated with a potential transmission operating range state. TO Max<br>
and TO Min values associated with that engine operating point (NI, PI pair for<br>
continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears) in the search space S or<br>
range are calculated. Then, the power losses associated with that engine<br>
operating point (NI, PI pair for continuously variable modes and TI for fixed<br>
gears) in the respective search space S or range are calculated. As part of the<br>
total power loss calculation, the difference between the operator torque request<br>
and the TO Max (or TO Min, as may be applicable for cases where deceleration<br>
torque is requested) is assigned a biasing cost. This process is repeated for<br>
each engine operating point (NI and PI pair for continuously variable modes<br>
and TI for fixed gears) in the space S or range chosen by the search algorithm<br>
associated with that potential transmission operating range state, which results<br>
in a cost being associated with each chosen engine operating point (NI, PI pair<br>
for continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears) in the respective<br>
search space S or range associated with that potential transmission operating<br>
range state. The points having the lowest biasing costs are inherently inclined<br>
to have the highest TO Max and lowest TO Min values.<br><br><br>
[00107] Thus, a method according to the disclosure is concerned with<br>
balancing selection of a transmission operating range state from a set of<br>
potential transmission operating range states between choosing engine<br>
operating point (NI, PI pair for continuously variable modes and TI for fixed<br>
gears, with emphasis on the NI value, which is used for creating a desired<br>
transmission input profile as earlier described herein) in the respective search<br>
space S or range which have the least power losses of the system associated<br>
with each potential transmission operating range state, which includes a bias<br>
cost that biases the point selection to a point which has the highest TO Max,<br>
(or lowest TO Min). Preference in some embodiments may be given to those<br>
engine operating point (NI, PI pair for continuously variable modes and TI for<br>
fixed gears) within the respective search space S or range for the various<br>
potential transmission operating range states which have the absolute least<br>
total power losses, which includes large bias costs associated with the output<br>
torque request, which in such instance is more concerned with meeting an<br>
extreme torque request from the vehicle operator. In other embodiments,<br>
preference may be given to those engine operating points (NI, PI pairs for<br>
continuously variable modes and TI for fixed gears) within the respective<br>
search space S or range for the various potential transmission operating range<br>
states which have the absolute least total power losses, which include none or<br>
small bias costs associated with the output torque request, as this is an instance<br>
wherein it is desired to focus less on attempting to meet the extreme torque<br>
demand of the driver, and more on overall system efficiency. The choice<br>
between whether preference is given to system performance to meet the<br>
extreme torque demand as closely as possible, or to maximize the overall<br><br><br>
system efficiency is controllable by altering the function which determines the<br>
shape of the biasing cost curve shown in FIG. 19. When the slope of the curve<br>
defined by the function therein is selected to be steeper, more weight is given<br>
to meeting the operator torque request that is higher or lower than the torque<br>
output deliverable by the driveline.<br>
[00108] Once a method of the disclosure has been used to identify which<br>
potential transmission operating range state is to be selected, the transmission<br>
input speed NI that was the basis for the selection of that particular<br>
transmission operating range state is used as the transmission input speed for<br>
continuously variable modes.<br>
[00109] It has been demonstrated that an operating point described by a<br>
particular NI, PI pair is caused to be selected from a search range space in view<br>
of power losses associated with one or more cost functions, for the case of<br>
operation in modes such as M1 and M2. However, it may in certain instances,<br>
depending on the structure of the cost function(s) employed and operating<br>
conditions encountered, be possible that the search method fails to converge to<br>
the NI, PI pair associated with the lowest total power loss. For example, in<br>
some instances this may be due to the nature of the costing functions and<br>
operating conditions, eddies or areas on the cost function curve(s) having local<br>
minima may cause an iterative search method using a search engine as herein<br>
described to zero-in on one NI, PI pair associated with a local minimum<br>
associated with a power loss that is greater than that of the global minimum,<br>
such as that shown in exemplary FIG. 22, instead of the global minimum that<br>
is defined by a different NI, PI pair. In such instances it may be considered<br>
that the search for an appropriate NI, PI pair has then failed, which failure may<br><br><br>
become problematic with regards to stable operation of an electro-mechanical<br>
transmission as provided herein. However, even for some cases where the<br>
search does not so "fail" it may be desirable to ensure that the NI value that is<br>
chosen has good subjective appeal to the operator. For instance, it might be<br>
that in some instances when a person who is operating a vehicle equipped with<br>
a driveline as herein described depresses the accelerator pedal, that an NI value<br>
is chosen which is lower than that which was in use prior to the depression of<br>
the accelerator pedal. In general, vehicle operators are accustomed to hearing<br>
a vehicle engine increase in rpm when they depress an accelerator pedal and<br>
hearing or sensing a decrease in NI in particular instances may provide an<br>
undesirable, un-natural feeling to a vehicle operator, which situation is<br>
desirably avoided.<br>
[00110] In one embodiment a method as provided herein examines NI values<br>
from a previous iteration of the search engine and makes a determination of<br>
whether a prior NI value is more desirable, in terms of power loss, than a<br>
newly-generated NI value from the search engine. For those cases where it is<br>
found that the search "failed", the prior NI value may be chosen by Arbitration<br>
over the newly-generated NI value, causing the general shape of the graph of<br>
the NI value over time to appear as shown in FIG. 23, being constant over the<br>
region(s) where the search fails and the 1-dimensional (ID) search engine<br>
predominates the 2-dimensional (2D) search engine results. In general, the<br>
Arbitration will examine the output of the 1D and 2D search engines and<br>
choose that output having the least power loss associated with it.<br><br>
[00111] In other embodiments, input speed (NO stabilization is enhanced by<br>
adding a cost to the existing cost function(s) or providing a separate cost<br>
function which stabilizes NI to the position of the vehicle accelerator pedal.<br>
[00112] The disclosure provides an improved value for NI in those cases<br>
where the search fails, by considering the rate of change of the input speed<br>
(NI) expressed as d(NI)/dt. In one embodiment, an improved NI value is<br>
provided the equation:<br>
new NI = old NI + [d(NI)/dt] (dt)	[4]<br>
(wherein "old NI" refers to the NI selected from the previous search, and<br>
d(NI)/dt refers to the optimal input speed change rate which are predetermined<br>
parameters which are dependent on the operator torque request and driving<br>
conditions. These parameters represent a desired optimal input speed change<br>
rate and may be based on simulated results of the 2D search process for<br>
various operator torque requests and driving conditions) and the NI / time<br>
profile is also manipulated, based on accelerator pedal position by adding<br>
costs for those situations in which the NI profile over time is moving in a<br>
direction which is deemed undesirable, based on subjective features<br>
determined by the vehicle engineers. This has the net effect of costing, and<br>
hence making less favorable from the standpoint of selection, undesirable<br>
movements in the NI profile over time. Thus, according to a general case as<br>
provided herein, the trajectory of the input speed that is chosen to be most<br>
desirable, which may be called Opt NI, is stabilized by replacing the 2-<br>
dimensional search optimal input speed (2D Opt NI) with the sum of the<br><br><br>
optimal input speed from the previous loop (Opt NI old) and the optimal input<br>
speed change rate, multiplied by the time interval between search loops<br>
[d(NI)/dt](dt), as shown pictorially in FIG. 24, in which the following<br>
equalities apply:<br>
2D OptN, - 2D NI *	[5]<br>
ID OptNI = 1DNI	[6]<br>
2D OptPwrLoss = 2D PCost*	[7]<br>
1D OptPwrLoss = 1D PCost*	[8]<br>
in which OptNI is the Arbitrated NI, and OptPwrLoss is the Arbitrated<br>
PCost*). With reference to FIG. 25, one exemplary algorithm useful for<br>
determining NI is:<br>
If 2D OptCost &gt; ID OptCost (*)<br>
OptNi = OptNi_old + [d(NI)/dt] (dt)<br>
OptPwrLoss = 1D OptPwrLoss<br>
Else<br>
OptNi = 2D OptNi<br>
OptPwrLoss = 2D OptPwrLoss -<br>
(Driver pedal filter derivative gain scheduling costing)(**)<br>
End<br>
in which the 2D Optimal Cost could have a higher cost than the ID Optimal<br>
Cost due to a relatively high driver pedal filter derivative gain scheduling cost,<br>
or when the 2D Search fails to converge to the minimum optimal cost. Driver<br>
pedal filter derivative gain scheduling costing provides a cost the input speed<br>
change with respect to the driver pedal aggressiveness, i.e cost heavy decrease<br>
(increase) in input speed when the driver pedal is requesting aggressive<br><br><br>
acceleration (deceleration). This is included in the Cost Function in the 2D<br>
and 1D Optimization for Input Speed stabilization purposes, but subtracted<br>
from the total cost arbitration so that it would not affect the optimal range<br>
selection. This cost is always 0 in the 1D Optimization since Ni(j) = Niold.<br>
[00113] In one embodiment, whether a movement in the NI profile over time<br>
is desirable or not is based on the position of the accelerator pedal. In another<br>
embodiment, whether a movement in the NI profile over time is desirable or<br>
not is based on the rate of change of position of the accelerator pedal.<br>
However, in general, it is undesirable that the NI value should decrease when<br>
the accelerator pedal is depressed substantially.<br>
[00114] Referring now to FIG. 25 which illustrates a costing algorithm for<br>
negative NI changes (i.e., costing transmission input speed (NI) points that<br>
have a lower value than the selected NI value from the prior search) the<br>
derivative of pedal position is along the x-axis in the gain and offset functions.<br>
When the derivative of the pedal position is negative, the cost gain and offset,<br>
which are the y-axis values of the cost gain and offset functions, are zero.<br>
This includes the case when the operator removes their foot from the<br>
accelerator pedal.<br>
[00115] On the other hand, if the derivative of pedal position is positive, such<br>
as when the vehicle operator depresses the accelerator pedal, then the cost gain<br>
and offset functions will not be zero, but will be given by:<br>
Accel. Pedal Stabilizing Cost = [(negative gain) * (A NI)] +	[9]<br>
neg. offset value<br><br>
These provisions ensure, in general, that if the NI value is decreasing with time<br>
at a given instant, costing will only occur when the operator depresses the<br>
accelerator pedal.<br>
[00116] Referring now to FIG. 26, illustrating the costing algorithm for<br>
positive NI changes, i.e., costing transmission input speed (NI) points that<br>
have a higher value than the selected NI value from the prior search, the<br>
derivative of pedal position is along the x-axis in the gain and offset functions.<br>
When the derivative of the pedal position is positive, the cost gain and offset,<br>
which are the y-axis values of the cost gain and offset functions, are zero.<br>
This includes the case when the operator depresses the accelerator pedal. On<br>
the other hand, if the derivative of pedal position is negative, such as when the<br>
operator removes their foot from the accelerator pedal, then the cost gain and<br>
offset functions will not be zero, but will be given by the equation:<br>
Accel. Pedal Stabilizing Cost = [(positive gain) * (A NI)] +	[10]<br>
pos. offset value<br>
These provisions ensure, in general, that if the NI value is increasing with time<br>
at a given instant, this type of costing will only occur when the operator<br>
removes their foot from the accelerator pedal. The negative, positive gain and<br>
offset values are subjective to the vehicle engineer, to enable latitude in<br>
providing enhanced drivability versus vehicle performance or economy.<br>
[00117] In one embodiment, the processes described by FIGS. 25 and 26 are<br>
embedded in the cost functions (450) of the ID and 2D process 610,620, as<br>
shown and described in reference to FIGS. 6 and 8, and are but one of a<br><br>
plurality of costs provided by cost functions and algorithms resident in those<br>
processes, and are conducted only with regards to that operating range state<br>
which is currently selected. Thus, the process involving stabilization of the NI<br>
values as a function of pedal position is not considered as a factor in selection<br>
of which transmission operating range state is to be selected at a given time<br>
given particular operator torque requests or operating parameters, including<br>
road conditions. In one embodiment, when preferability factors are<br>
determined for purposes of determining transmission operating range state<br>
selection, the costs associated with stabilization of NI are subtracted out from<br>
the total costs used in determining the preferability factors, as earlier described<br>
herein.<br>
[00118] Important aspects of operation of a motorized vehicle comprising a<br>
drivetrain as herein described include situations in which the operator of the<br>
vehicle provides a negative torque request, e.g., desires to apply braking. It is<br>
desirable in general to provide stable vehicle operation during times when<br>
braking torques are requested, and provision for such stability must take into<br>
consideration how the selection of transmission operating range state and<br>
transmission input speed are to be carried out during braking conditions.<br>
[00119] During one non-limiting example of a braking situation, when<br>
predicted accelerator output torque request ('Accel Prdtd') is zero and the<br>
predicted braking output torque request ('Output Torque Request Brake Prdtd')<br>
is, for example, -1000 Newton*meters (Nm), the torque output (TO) from the<br>
('Opt To/Ta/Tb') function 440 could potentially be any value between zero<br>
and -1000 Nm, if these values reside within the TO Min and TO Max. This is<br>
in contrast to a conventional braking system, in the presence of a braking<br><br><br>
output torque request of- 1000 Nm, when the accelerator output torque<br>
request is zero, the sum of zero and -1000 Nm needs to be provided by the<br>
friction brakes. Stated another way, in a vehicle equipped with a drivetrain as<br>
herein described, there are two types of braking: 1) conventional friction<br>
braking; and 2) regenerative braking, which means that in the above example,<br>
friction braking and regenerative braking may each be individual components,<br>
in any desired or selected amount or proportion, to provide a sum total<br>
combination of -1000 Nm of braking torque.<br>
[00120] According to embodiments of the present disclosure, two general<br>
braking strategies may be employed for a vehicle equipped with an electro-<br>
mechanical transmission described herein. In one embodiment, braking<br>
operation may be switched between a first general strategy and a second<br>
general strategy by means of a switch 605, which is activated in accordance<br>
with the vehicle calibrations.<br>
[00121] In the first general strategy, both the transmission input speed (Nj)<br>
and the transmission operating range state selection are dependent on the<br>
braking torque request. A general schematic diagram of information<br>
processing in accordance with the first general strategy is shown in FIG. 7, for<br>
the case when the switch 605 is set so that the input to 610 is Ni* +<br>
[d(NI)/dt](dt) which includes full optimization of transmission input speed and<br>
transmission operating range state selection in strategic optimization, while<br>
accounting for blended braking, involving both friction-pad braking and the<br>
use of resistive torque from electric machines 56 and 72 which generate<br>
electrical energy during the course of their being in operative connection with<br>
one or more of the vehicle wheels during such braking, the electrical energy so<br><br><br>
produced being stored in the ESD 74. In this strategy, the ID optimization<br>
610 is executed in parallel with the 2D optimization 620 during blended<br>
braking operations. The Optimal Output Torque (OptTo) function (which is a<br>
part of the Opt To/Ta/Tb function 440) and the Brake Power Loss Cost<br>
function are enabled in both ID and 2D optimizations. Optimal Output<br>
Torque (OptTo) function selects an optimal output torque which is constrained<br>
by the achievable output torque limits, TO min and TO max, that minimizes the<br>
battery power ('PBat') within the range from the minimum Output Torque<br>
Request Net Strategic (Output Torque Request Accel Prdtd + Output Torque<br>
Request Brake Prdtd) to the maximum of TO Req Prdtd (Output Torque<br>
Request Accel Strategic). Brake Power Loss Costing is added to the Cost<br>
function 450 to compensate for power lost through friction braking. This is<br>
caused to occur by the OptTO function selecting an Optimal Output Torque<br>
(OptTo) that is greater than the Output Torque Request Net Strategic. Thus, a<br>
braking torque request by the operator affects both the optimal input speed and<br>
the optimal range selection.<br>
[00122] As previously mentioned, it is possible in some instances for the 2D<br>
search to fail to converge to an NI, PI pair associated with the lowest total<br>
power loss, or for there to exist relatively high power losses (change costs)<br>
associated with an undesirable change in NI, in which case it is desirable to<br>
stabilize the 2D Ni* values which are the outputs of the 2D optimization 620.<br>
Accordingly, in parallel with the 2D optimization, a ID optimization 610 is<br>
conducted using a previous value for the optimal NI value Ni* and adding to it<br>
the change rate of the NI value, [d(NI)/dt](dt) as previously described, for<br>
which the system provides a new d(NI)/dt every time the search is made. The<br><br><br>
new summed value is used as an input in a ID optimization to arrive at a value<br>
for TI which gives the most desirable total power loss. Then, a new quantity<br>
becomes a part of the cost function sum (total power loss) of the ID search,<br>
which sum cost is compared to the cost output from the 2D search. Thus,<br>
according to a first strategy the 1D search exists for the purpose of stabilizing<br>
what would otherwise be an undesirable output, if the 2D search output was<br>
the only output present.<br>
[00123] In such a first general strategy, information sent to an Arbitration<br>
decision step is the lowest total power loss (P*cost) and optimal NI from the<br>
2D search results, and the lowest total power loss (P*cost) from the ID search<br>
results and previous value for the optimal NI value added to [d(N[)/dt](dt).<br>
The Arbitration selects the optimal NI and P*Cost as values upon which to<br>
base selection of an optimal transmission operating range state ('Hybrid Range<br>
State Des') (P*cost selected from 2D or ID) and select input speeds associated<br>
with the selected P*cost, to be used as a basis for determining an optimal or<br>
desired transmission input speed ('Ni_Des') profile.<br>
[00124] In a second general strategy, only the transmission operating range<br>
state selection is dependent on the braking torque request ('Output Torque<br>
Request Brake Prdtd), with the transmission input speed NI being unaffected<br>
by the braking torque request of the operator. Thus, in a second general<br>
strategy, selection of NI ignores the operator brake torque request and bases<br>
the NI chosen on the position of the accelerator pedal ('Output Torque Request<br>
Accel Prdtd'). A general schematic diagram of information processing in<br>
accordance with the second general strategy is shown in Fig. 7, when the<br>
switch 605 is set so the input to 610 is 2D Ni* and does not involve<br><br><br>
transmission input speed stabilization. In this strategy, the 1D optimization is<br>
executed in series with the 2D optimization during a blended braking<br>
operation, which effectively disables transmission input speed stabilization.<br>
The ID Opt TO function and brake power loss Cost is enabled and the 2D Opt<br>
TO function is partially disabled so that Opt TO will always be equal to the<br>
Output torque Request Accel Prdtd, that is limited by the achievable output<br>
torque (TO min, TO max), with brake power loss costing disabled, and<br>
therefore the 2D optimal input speed will not account for the braking effect.<br>
The braking will effect the optimal range selection through the 1D P*cost<br>
resulting from incorporating braking input data in the 1D optimization, but not<br>
the input speed selection. This has one effect of avoiding driver discomfort by<br>
preventing sudden changes in engine speed at braking events.<br>
[00125] In the case of the second general strategy, when the operator of the<br>
vehicle makes a braking torque request, such as by applying the brake pedal, it<br>
is not desired to have any effects from braking to impact the engine speed, and<br>
by ignoring the brake torque request in the 2D search a transmission input<br>
speed NI is obtained that is unaffected by the operator brake torque request<br>
(Output Torque Request Brake Prdtd). In this strategy, the ID optimization<br>
needs an Opt NI value, and for this, the output of the 2D optimization is used.<br>
Accordingly, the selection of NI is done without braking input data.<br>
[00126] In the second general strategy, the information sent to Arbitration is<br>
the lowest total power loss (P*cost) from the ID search engine and the optimal<br>
NI from the 2D search engine, and Arbitration selects the P*cost from the ID<br>
search engine results and the optimal NI from the 2D search engine results as<br>
values upon which to base range selection ('Hybrid Range State Des') on<br><br><br>
(P*cost from ID) and to select an input speed to be used as a basis for<br>
determining an optimal or desired transmission input speed (NiDes) profile.<br>
[00127] The difference of (Opt TO - Output Torque Request Net Strategic)<br>
represents unused torque or brake power loss, which may be multiplied by NO<br>
to convert to power units and used as a cost to be combined with other power<br>
losses (costs) in determining total power loss.<br>
[00128] Although the foregoing strategies are descriptive of selection of<br>
operating parameters in continuously variable modes of the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission, these same Optimal Output Torque (Opt TO) function and<br>
braking power losses are included also in the cost functions for fixed gear<br>
operation and engine-off modes. Since the transmission input speed is<br>
predetermined for fixed gear operations and engine-off modes, the Opt TO<br>
function and the brake power loss functions are enabled only to determine the<br>
P*Cost values for each potential operating range upon which to base selection<br>
of transmission operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des')-<br>
