				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CALCULATING SOFT DECISION VALUE INPUT TO CHANNEL DECODER IN A DATA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF  THE INVENTION Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates generally to a demodulation apparatus and method for a data communication system employing multi-level modulation, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for calculating an input value to a channel decoder in a demodulator for a data communication system employing 64-ary QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation).<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
In general, a data communication system employs multi-level modulation in order to increase spectral efficiency. The multi-level modulation includes various modulation techniques. Herein, reference will be made to 64-ary QAM, one of the multilevel modulation techniques. As known by those skilled in the art, a 64-ary QAM channel encoder modulates a signal coded by binary encoding and transmits the coded signal to a receiver. The receiver then receives the transmitted modulated signal and decodes the modulated signal through soft decision values decoding in a channel decoder. To perform the decoding, a demodulator of the receiver includes a mapping algorithm for generating soft decision values (or soft values), because the received modulated signal is comprised of an in-phase signal component and a quadrature-phase signal component. Therefore, the demodulator of the receiver includes a mapping algorithm for generating soft decision values each corresponding to output bits of the channel encoder from a 2-dimensional received signal.<br>
The mapping algorithm is classified into a simple metric procedure proposed by Nokia, and a dual minimum metric procedure proposed by Motorola, Both algorithms calculate LLR (Log Likelihood Ratio) values for the output bits and use the calculated LLR values as input soft decision values to the channel decoder. The simple metric procedure, which employs a mapping algorithm given by modifying a complex LLR calculation formula into a simple approximate formula, has a simple LLR calculation formula. However, LLR distortion caused by the use of the approximate formula leads to performance degradation. The dual minimum metric procedure, which employs a mapping algorithm of calculating LLR with a more accurate approximate formula and uses the calculated LLR as an input soft decision value of the channel decoder, can make up for performance degradation of the simple metric procedure to some extent. However, compared with the simple metric procedure, this procedure needs increased calculations, thus causing a considerable increase in hardware complexity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for obtaining a soft decision value without performing complex calculations in a demodulator for a data communication system employing 64-ary QAM.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides an apparatus and method for obtaining a soft decision value input to a channel decoder, calculated by the dual minimum metric procedure, without a mapping table or complex calculations in a demodulator for a data communication system employing 64-ary QAM.<br>
An algorithm for generating multi-dimensional soft decision values from a 2-dimentional received signal will be described below. An output sequence of a binary channel encoder is divided into m bits, and mapped to corresponding signal points among M (=2m) signal points according to a Gray coding rule. This can be represented by<br>
Equation (1)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In Equation (1), s (i=0,l,...,m-l) indicates an ith bit in the output sequence of the binary channel encoder, mapped to a kth symbol, and Ik and Qk indicate an in-phase signal component and a quadrature-phase signal component of the kth symbol, respectively. For 64-ary QAM, m=6 and a corresponding signal constellation is illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
A complex output of a symbol demodulator in the receiver, comprised of Ik and Qk, is defined as<br>
Equation (2)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In Equation (2), Xk and Yk indicate an in-phase signal component and a quadrature-phase signal component of the output of the symbol demodulator, respectively. Further, gk is a complex coefficient indicating gains of the transmitter, the<br>
transmission media and the receiver. In addition, η 1k and Η Q K are Gaussian noises with an average 0 and a divergence  σ2", and they are statistically independent of each other.<br>
LLR related to the sequence Sk,1 (i=0,l,  . . .,m-l) can be calculated by Equation (3), and the calculated LLR can be used as a soft decision value input to the channel decoder.<br>
Equation (3)<br>
 (Equation Removed)<br><br>
In Equation (3), k is a constant, and Pr{A|B}   indicates a conditional<br>
probability defined as a probability that an event A will occur when an event B occurs. However, since Equation (3) is non-linear and accompanies relatively many calculations, an algorithm capable of approximating Equation (3) is required for actual realization. In the case of a Gaussian noise channel with gk=l in Equation (2), Equation (3) can be approximated by the dual minimum metric procedure as follows.<br>
Equation (4)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In Equation (4). K'=(1/σ2)K. and Zk(Sk,1=O) and Zk(Sk,1=l) indicate acraal values of Lk-jQk for Sk,1-0 and  Sk,1=1 respectively. In order to calculate Equation (4), it is<br>
necessary  to  determine  Zk(Sk,1=0)   and  Zk(Sk,2=1)  minimizing   Rk-Zk(Sk,1=0)2   and<br><br>
R. - -Zk (Sk,1 = 1)2  for a 2-dimensional received signal Rk. Equation (4) approximated by the dual minimum metric procedure can be rewritten as<br>
Equation (5")<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In Equation (5), nk,1 indicates an 1th bit value of a reverse mapping sequence<br>
for a signal point nearest to Rk, and nk,1 indicates a negation for nk,1. The nearest signal<br>
point is determined by ranges of an in-phase signal component and a quadrature-phase signal component of Rk. A first term in the brackets of Equation (5) can be rewritten as<br>
Equation (6) <br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In Equation (6), Uk and Vk denote an in-phase signal component and a quadrature-phase signal component of a nearest signal point mapped by {nk,m-1•••, nk,1, . . ., nk,1, nk,0}, respectively. Further, a second term in the brackets of Equation (5) can be written as<br>
Equation (7)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In Equation (7), Uk,1 and Vk,1 denote an in-phase signal component and a quadrature-phase signal component of a signal point mapped by a reverse mapping<br><br>
sequence {mk,m-1 , mk,i (=nk,1),  mk,1, mk,0} of Zk minimizing  Rk-zk(Sk-1=n k,1)2 respectively. Equation (5) is rewritten as Equation (8) by Equation (6) and Equation (7).<br>
Equation (8)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
A process of calculating input soft decision values to the channel decoder by a demodulator in accordance with Equation (8) in a data communication system employing 64-ary QAM will be described below. First, Table 1 and Table 2 are used to calculate { nk,5, nk,4 nk,3, nk,2, nk,1, nk,0}, Uk and Vk from two signal components Xk and Yk of a 64-ary QAM-modulated received signal Rk.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Table 1 illustrates (nk,5 ,nk,4, nk,3) and Vk for the case where a quadrature-phase signal component Yk of the received signal Rk appears in each of 8 regions parallel to a horizontal axis in FIG. 1. For the sake of convenience, 7 boundary values, that is. result values at Yk = -6a, Yk = -4a, Yk = -2a, Yk = 0, Yk - 2a. Yk = 4a and Y, = 6a. are omitted from Table 1. Where "a" means a distance value on the same axis and the "a" indicating a distance value, can have a different value according to a modulating/demodulating method. Table 2 illustrates (nk,2 nk,1, nk,o) and Uk for the case where an in-phase signal component Xk of the received signal Rk. appears in each of 8 regions parallel to a vertical axis in FIG. 1. For the sake of convenience, 7 boundary values, mat is, result values at Xk = -6a, Xk = -4a, Xk = -2a, Xk = 0, Xk = 2a, Xk = 4a and Xk = 6a, are omitted from Table 2.<br>
Table 3 illustrates a sequence {mk,5, mk,4, mk,2, mk2, mk,1, mk,0} minimizing<br><br>

Table 6 and Table 7 illustrate results given by down-scaling, in a ratio of<br>
K'x4a, input soft decision values of the channel decoder obtained by substituting Vk,1 and Uk,1 of Table 4 and Table 5 into Equation (8).<br>
Table 6<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 7<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
That is, when a received signal Rk is applied, LLR satisfying a corresponding condition can be output as an input soft decision value by Table 6 and Table 7. If the channel decoder used in the system is not a max-logMAP (logarithmic maximum a posteriori) decoder, a process of up-scaling the LLR of Table 6 and Table 7 in a reverse ratio of the down-scale ratio must be added.<br>
However, when outputting an input soft decision value of the channel decoder using the mapping table of Table 6 or Table 7, the demodulator should perform an operation of deciding a condition of the received signal and require a memory for storing the output contents according to the corresponding condition. This can be avoided by calculating the input soft decision values to the channel decoder using a formula having a simple condition decision operation instead of the mapping table.<br>
To this end, the condition decision formulas shown in Table 6 and Table 7<br>
can be expressed as shown in Table 8 and Table 9.<br>

In Table 8, Zlk= │ Yk │ -4a and Z2k= │ Zlk │ -2a, and in Table 9, Z'lk= │ Xk │ -4a and Z'2k=│Z'1k│ -2a. In Table 8 and Table 9, even the soft decision values at the 7 boundary values, which were omitted from Table 6 and Table 1 for convenience, are taken into consideration.<br>
In hardware realization, Table 8 and Table 9 can be simplified into Table 10 and Table 11 on condition that a sign of Xk, Yk, Zlk, Z2k, Z'lk and Z'2k, can be expressed by sign bits. Table 10 and Table 11 illustrate LLR values in terms of Yk, ZIk, Z2k, and Xk, Z'1k, Z2k, respectively.<br>

In Table 10 and Table 11, MSB(x) denotes a most significant bit (MSB) of a given value x.<br>
From Table 10, soft decision values ٨(Sk,5), ٨(Sk,4) and ٨(Sk,4)c at i=5, 4 and 3 are respectively expressed as<br>
Equation (9) (Equation Removed)<br>
Equation(10) (Equation Removed)<br><br>
From Table 11, soft decision values A(sk,2), ٨(Sk,1) and ٨(Sk,0) at i=2, 1 and 0 are respectively expressed as<br>

(Equation Removed)<br>
Equation (13)<br>

Equation (14) (Equation Removed)<br>
That is, in the data communication system employing 64-ary QAM, it is possible to actually calculate 6 soft decision values, which are outputs of the demodulator for one received signal and inputs of the channel decoder, using the dual minimum metric procedure of Equation (4), through the simple conditional formulas of Equation (9) to Equation (14). This process is illustrated hi FIGs. 2 and 3. FIGs. 2 and 3 illustrate an example of processes performed for calculating soft decision values according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
First, a process of calculating soft decision values ٨(Sk,5), ٨(Sk,4) and ٨(Sk,3)<br>
will be described with reference to FIG. 2. In step 200, a demodulator determines whether an MSB value of a quadrature-phase signal component Y, is 0. As a result of the determination, if an MSB value of the quadrature-phase signal component Yk is 0, the demodulator proceeds to step 204 and sets a value of a parameter c to 1. Otherwise, the demodulator proceeds to step 202 and sets a value of the parameter c to -1. After determining a value of the parameter c, the demodulator sets a value of Z1k to │Yk│-4a in step 206. Thereafter, the demodulator determines in step 208 whether MSB of the Z!k determined in step 206 is 0. As a result of the determination, if MSB of the Z1k is 0. the demodulator proceeds to step 212 and sets a value of a parameter a to 3. Otherwise, the demodulator proceeds to step 210 and sets a value of the parameter a. to 0. After setting a value of the parameter a. the demodulator sets a value of Z:k to │Z1k│-2a in step 214. Thereafter, the demodulator determines in step 216 whether MSB of the Z:k is 0. As a result of the determination, if MSB of the Z2k is 0, the demodulator proceeds to step 220 and sets a value of a parameter (3 to 0. Otherwise, the demodulator proceeds to step 218 and sets a value of the parameter (3 to -1 and a value of a parameter y to 0. After step 220. the demodulator determines in step 222 whether MSB of the Z1k is 0. As a result of the determination, if MSB of the Z1k is 0, the demodulator proceeds to step 224 and sets a value of the parameter γ to 1. Otherwise, the demodulator proceeds to step 226 and sets a value of the parameter γ to 1. Based on the determined values of the parameters a, ß, y and c, the demodulator calculates the soft decision values ٨(Sk,5), ٨(Sk,4) and ٨(Sk,3) in step 228.<br>
Next, a process for calculating soft decision values ٨(Sk,2), ٨(Sk,1) and ٨(Sk,0) will be described with reference to FIG. 3. In step 300, the demodulator determines whether an MSB value of an in-phase signal component Xk is 0. As a result of the determination, if an MSB value of the in-phase signal component Xk is 0, the demodulator proceeds to step 304 and sets a value of a parameter c to 1. Otherwise, the demodulator proceeds to step 302 and sets a value of the parameter c' to -1. After determining a value of the parameter c', the demodulator sets a value of Z'lk to Xk|-4a in step 306. Thereafter, the demodulator determines in step 308 whether MSB of the Zlk determined in step 306 is 0. As a result of the determination, if MSB of the Zlk is 0, the demodulator proceeds to step 312 and sets a value of a parameter α to 3. Otherwise, the demodulator proceeds to step 310 and sets a value of the parameter a' to 0. After setting a value of the parameter α', the demodulator sets a value of Z%k to |Z'lk|-2a in step 314. Thereafter, the demodulator determines in step 316 whether MSB of the Z'2k is 0. As a result of the determination, if MSB of the Z'2k is 0, the demodulator proceeds to step 320 and sets a value of a parameter P' to 0. Otherwise, the demodulator proceeds to step 318 and sets a value of the parameter P' to -1 and a value of a parameter γ' to 0. After step<br>
320, the demodulator determines in step 322 whether MSB of the Z'lk is 0. As a result of the determination, if MSB of the Z'llc is 0, the demodulator proceeds to step 324 and sets a value of the parameter γ' to 1. Otherwise, the demodulator proceeds to step 326 and sets a value of the parameter γ' to -1. Based on the determined values of the parameters α', ß', γ' and c', the demodulator calculates the soft decision values ٨(Sk,0), ٨(Sk,0) and ٨(Sk,0) in step 328.<br>

This process can be realized by a block diagram illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>

In this manner, the circuit of FIG. 6 can calculate the soft decision values ٨(Sk,2), ٨(Sk,1) and ٨(Sk,0) from the in-phase signal component Xk and the value "a". According to the foregoing description, a conventional soft decision value calculator using the dual minimum metric procedure realized by Equation (4) needs one hundred or more squaring operations and comparison operations. However, the calculators according to an embodiment of the present invention as exemplified in FIGs. 5 and 6 and realized using Equation (9) to Equation (14) are comprised of 10 adders (first to fourth operators are also realized by adders), 8 multipliers and 10 multiplexers, contributing to a remarkable reduction in operation time and complexity of the calculator. Table 12 below illustrates a comparison made between the conventional calculator realized by Equation (4) and the novel calculator realized by Equations (9) to (14) in terms of the type and number of operations, for ie {0, 1,2, 3,4, 5}.<br>

In summary, the embodiment of, the present invention described above derives Table 6 to Table 11 from Equation (6) to Equation (8) and the process of Table 1 to Table 5, in order to reduce a time delay and complexity, which may occur when Equation (4), the known dual minimum metric procedure, or Equation (5) obtained by simplifying the dual minimum metric procedure is actually realized using the 64-ary QAM. Further, the embodiment of the present invention provides Equation (9) to Equation (14), new formulas used to realize the dual minimum metric procedure in the 64-ary QAM. In addition, the present invention provides a hardware device realized based on Equation (9) and Equation (14).<br>
