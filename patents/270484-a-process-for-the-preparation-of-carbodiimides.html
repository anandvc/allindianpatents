				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the synthesis of alkyl and aryl carbodiimide and more<br>
particularly an eco-friendly and energy efficient process to produce the same<br>
involving very simple and cost-effective process steps. More specifically the alkyl and<br>
aryl carbodiimide with high purity, stability and yield are obtained involving direct<br>
treatment of the 1, 3-disubstituted alkyl and aryl thiourea with thiophilic halogen in<br>
the presence of base and in organic solvent. The reagents are easily available, safe,<br>
non-corrosive, environmentally benign and inexpensive. The process is further<br>
directed to a simple and faster production of the alkyl and aryl carbodiimide without<br>
the requirement of any extraneous heating making it further energy efficient.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Carbodiimides rank as one of the most important class of reagents in organic<br>
synthesis due to their easy accessibility, interesting chemical reactivity and utility in<br>
coupling reactions. Carbodiimides are widely used reagent for the synthesis of<br>
heterocycles, polysubstituted guanidines and various other compounds.<br>
Carbodiimides are an important class of molecules in synthetic organic chemistry<br>
which are widely used as synthetic intermediates and in several industrial<br>
applications such as synthesis of nucleotides and peptides, heterocycles, oxidation<br>
with dimethyl sulfoxide, permease inhibitors, polymer stabilizer, cycloaddition etc.<br>
Thus for its known wide use and application in various branches of chemistry, it is<br>
therefore not very surprising that there are several reports for the synthesis of<br>
carbodiimides exist in literature.<br>
Reference is drawn to arts, Chemical Review. 1953, 53, 145; Chem. Rev. 1967, 67,<br>
107; Chem. Rev. 1981, 81, 689 and Tetrahedron 1981, 37, 233 where various<br>
methods of preparation of carbodiimides have been extensively discussed. The<br>
general methods involve the removal of hydrogen sulfide from thiourea by metal<br>
oxides (HgO, PbO, Ag2O), complexes of mercury, alkylcholoroformates, (CICOOEt),<br>
arylsulfonyl chlorides. The disadvantage of such a process resides in the use of<br>
polluting heavy metal ions.<br><br>
Carbodiimides can also be prepared by the oxidation of thioureas using various<br>
oxidizing agents and catalysts.<br>
Apart from the prior arts existing in literature there are numerous prior arts in the<br>
form of patents that are discussed below.<br>
Japanese patent JP06234725 relates to a process wherein carbodiimides are<br>
prepared by the treatment of 1,3-disubstituted thiourea with cyclic haloiminium salts<br>
such as l-choloro-l,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride and Et3N in CH2CI2 at room<br>
temperature for 4 hrs. The drawbacks of the method lie in the use of expensive<br>
reagents and halogenated solvent.<br>
Reference is drawn to EP307361 wherein the carbodiimide intermediate for the<br>
preparation of cyanoguanidine an epoxide hardener is prepared by photochemical<br>
oxidation of thiourea, NaOH, Rose Bengal in CH3CN/H2O under photochemical<br>
conditions. Specialized reaction conditions and the use of expensive Rose Bengal are<br>
the associated shortcomings of the method.<br>
Spanish patent ES481581, Britain patent GB1252707, US patent 3635947 and<br>
German patent DE1927529 are all directed to the synthesis of carbodiimides from<br>
RIMHC(Z)NHRj (Z= 0, S) with phosphorous based reagents such as Ph3PX2.Et3N<br>
(X=CI, Br), PhPO(NH2)2 in CH2CI2, under alkaline conditions at 0-5 °C. Use of<br>
expensive phosphorous reagents and halogenated solvents are the main<br>
disadvantages of the method.<br>
Yet again reference is drawn to US patents US4068065, US4068055, US3157662,<br>
US3056835, US3442947, US2853518, US2853473 and US3301895, German patent<br>
DE 2556760 and French patent FR1469946 that discloses the synthesis of<br>
carbodiimides from isocyanates using polymer supported catalyst such as 1-<br>
diethanolaminomethyl-3-methyl-3-phospholene-l-oxide-methyl-methacrylate<br>
copolymer and 2-methyl-l, 2-oxaphospholan-5-one 2-oxide, organometallic catalysts<br>
selected from the group consisting of (iso-Pro)4Ti (I), (BuCHEtCH2O)4Ti, (C8Hi7O)4Zr<br>
(II), (iso-PrO)4Zr and (EtO)5Nb, phosphorous based catalyst such as 1,2,3-trimethyl-<br>
2-oxo-l,3,2-diazaphospholidine (I), or analogs, Ba[Bu2B(OBu)2]2 and (Bu3Sn)2O.<br><br>
Involvement of high reaction temperatures expensive catalysts are the main<br>
disadvantages associated with the above mentioned catalysts.<br>
US3301895 again discloses the synthesis of carbodiimides by mixing equi-molar<br>
amounts of 1, 3-disubstitutes thiourea with COCI2 in an inert atmosphere in<br>
anhydrous condition in the absence of acid acceptor at 0-6 °C. On completion the<br>
reaction is heated to yield the carbodiimides. Highly toxic reagents, requirement of<br>
inert atmosphere techniques damages the wide applicability of the process.<br>
Reference is drawn to Japanese patent JP 41011865 wherein carbodiimide is<br>
manufactured by treating 1, 3-disubstituted thioureas with NaOCI under alkaline<br>
NaOH conditions. The drawbacks of the method rest in the use of strong oxidizing<br>
agent, alkaline reaction conditions and elevated temperature.<br>
German patent DEI 149712 teaches the preparation of carbodiimides by heating<br>
isocyanide dichlorides with the HCI salt of primary amines. The reaction is carried out<br>
in an inert atmosphere at 180 °C for 18 hrs. Longer reaction time, expensive<br>
reagents and requirement of high temperature are the drawbacks of the method.<br>
Details of the various methods of preparation of carbodiimides are recited in Chem.<br>
Rev. 1953, 53, 145; Chem. Rev 1967, 67, 107; Chem. Rev. 1981, 81, 689 and<br>
Tetrahedron 1981, 37, 233. Some of the other exiting literature methodologies are<br>
described below.<br>
Tetrahedron Letters 2007, 48, 6002 illustrates a process wherein isocyanates are<br>
catalytically converted to the corresponding carbodiimides in the presence of low<br>
valent transition metal complexes. The best conversions and yields were<br>
accomplished using [(C5R5)Fe(CO)2]2 (R=H or Me) or MeCpMn(CO)3 as catalysts.<br>
Again use of expensive catalysts restricts the applicability of the stated process.<br>
Reference is again drawn to Organometallics 1993, 12, 1023 that is directed to the<br>
use of vanadium oxo and imido complexes as catalysts for the condensation of aryl<br>
isocyanates to N, N'-diarylcarbodiimides. Complexes such as V(O)(OtBu)3 (I),<br>
V(O)(OiPr)3 (II); V(NPhMe)(OtBu)3 (III); and V(O)(acac)2 (IV) were found to be more<br><br>
effective in this regard. Use of expensive vanadium based reagents is the main<br>
drawback of the method.<br>
Eur. 3. Org. Chem. 2006, 4170 and J. Org. Chem. 1994, 59, 4931 is directed to a<br>
method wherein iminophosphorane or P(MeNCH2CH2)3N when reacted with<br>
phenylisocyante yields a mixture of carbodiimides through both normal and abnormal<br>
aza-Wittig reactions. The reagent 3-aminoimidazolone was obtained from the<br>
reaction of hydrazine hydrate with carbodiimide. Further reaction of 3-<br>
aminoimidazolone with triphenylphosphane, hexacholoroethane and triethylamine<br>
produced iminophosphorane in good yield. Low yield and expensive phosphorous<br>
based reagents are the associated drawback of the method.<br>
Reference is made to J. Org. Chem. 2005, 70, 6362 wherein a thiophilic promoted<br>
synthesis of disubstituted 4H-[1, 2, 4] triazol-3-ylamines as urea mimetic from the<br>
corresponding 1,3-disubstituted thioureas were studied and found that the reaction<br>
proceeded through the formation of a carbodiimide. Use of expensive above<br>
mentioned thiophilic reagent is the major disadvantage of the method.<br>
J. Org. Chem. 1999, 64, 6984 and Bulletin of Korean Chemical Society, substantiates<br>
a process wherein 2-chloro-l,3-dimethylimidazolinium chloride (DMC) and N-methyl-<br>
2-pyridinecarbamoyl chloride have been used as dehydrating agents, for the<br>
synthesis of carbodiimide in near neutral conditions from 1,3-disubstituted thiourea<br>
Use of expensive dehydrating agents are the limitations of this prior art.<br>
Reference is made to Synth Commun. 1995, 43 where in carbodiimides were<br>
prepared by treating thiourea with methanesulfonylchloride in the presence of<br>
triethylamine in DMAP. Moisture sensitive and lachrymatic methanesulfonyl chloride<br>
and the use of toxic DMAP are the stated disadvantages of the above prior art.<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 1986, 27, 6099; Tetrahedron Lett. 1986, 27, 1925; Tetrahedron<br>
Lett. 1985, 26, 1661 and 3. Org. Chem. 1986, 51, 2613; Synth Commun. 1985, 171;<br>
Makromolecular Chemie, 1981, 182, 3411; teaches the use of desulfurylating agent<br>
utilized for the synthesis of carbodiimide starting from thiourea; such as p-<br>
methoxybenzenetellurinic acid anhydride, di-2-pyridyl sulfite and l,l'-thiocarbonyldi-<br><br>
2,2'-pyridine and 2,4-dichloro-5-nitropyrimidine. All these methods use expensive<br>
reagents for carbodiimide synthesis.<br>
Reference is drawn to Tetrahedron Letters 1968, 29, 2473 and Tetrahedron 1970,<br>
26, 5731 wherein carbodiimides were prepared from 1, 3-disubstituted thioureas,<br>
diethyl azodicarboxylate and triphenylphosphine refluxed in benzene or toluene. Uses<br>
of carcinogenic solvent and expensive reagents are the major detraction of the<br>
processes.<br>
Chem. Commun. 1997, 347 is directed to a method wherein the synthesis of N, N'-<br>
dialkyl carbodiimide was achieved by catalytic condensation of amines and isonitrile<br>
at 100 °C using a palladium complex catalyst, oxygen and molecular iodine. The use<br>
of expensive palladium catalyst and requirement of elevated temperature is the<br>
drawback of the method.<br>
Inspite of the huge number of teachings flowing from the background art, such<br>
above said processes for the synthesis of alkyl and aryl carbodiimides suffer from<br>
either one or many of the drawbacks which include: use of expensive/ toxic/<br>
lachrymatic reagents, expensive dehydrating agents and catalysts; need of strongly<br>
basic and harsh reaction conditions; use of hazardous halo solvent and carcinogenic<br>
solvents such as benzene; low yield alongwith long reaction times and thus less<br>
efficient; moisture sensitive reagent needing inert atmosphere techniques thus<br>
difficult in handling.<br>
In light of the above said there is a continuous need in the art to develop a process<br>
for the manufacture of alkyl and aryl carbodiimides in an industrial scale which would<br>
circumvent all the aforementioned difficulties associated with the process.<br>
More particularly, it would be clearly apparent from the discussion above that there<br>
is a strong need in the art to provide for a process for the manufacture of alkyl and<br>
aryl carbodiimides in an industrial scale that would be: energy efficient; yield high<br>
purity product in good yields; economic with regard to the kind of reagents used and<br>
eco-friendly. More importantly, the method employed for product isolation in pure<br>
from is also an important tool to assess the feasibility of the said process.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for a process for the<br>
manufacture of alkyl and aryl carbodiimides in an industrial scale that would be<br>
efficient, economic, environment friendly and importantly would yield highly pure<br>

and aryl carbodiimides of general formula RN=C=NR' that would be economically<br>

aryl carbodiimides involving inexpensive, non-toxic and easily available starting<br>
materials and non-corrosive reagents.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As already disclosed herein before the present invention comprises of a simple and<br>
cost-effective and environment friendly process for manufacture of alkyl and aryl<br>
carbodiimides of the general formula RN=C=NR', wherein R is an alkyl and aryl<br><br>
group selected from the group of aliphatic and aromatic amines comprising of<br>
cyclohexyl, phenyl, 4-methyl phenyl, 4-bromophenyl, 4-chloro phenyl, 2-methoxy<br>
phenyl, 4-methoxy phenyl, 2,4-dimethyl phenyl, 2-chloro phenyl, 3-nitrophenyl, 2,6-<br>
dimethylphenyl, 2-(3,4-dimethyl-phenyl)-ethylamine group and wherein -N=C=N- is<br>
the carbodiimide group.<br>
The above mentioned alkyl and aryl carbodiimides are obtained in almost<br>
quantitative yields from the reaction involving a thiophilic halogen preferably iodine<br>
mediated decomposition of 1, 3-disubstituted thiourea in aprotic or polar protic<br>
solvent preferably ethylacetate (aprotic) at room temperature.<br>
The 1, 3-disubstituted thiourea are easily prepared by an established procedure by<br>
reacting aryl or alkyl isothiocyanate with aryl or alkyl amine.<br>
Once the synthesis of 1, 3-disubstituted thiourea is accomplished, a thiophilic<br>
reagent preferably iodine proved to be an effective reagent for the decomposition it<br>
to the desired carbodiimide in good yield within 15-20 minutes in the presence of<br>
triethylamine or NaHCO3.<br>
Some of the previously reported methods although giving better yields are quite<br>
expensive and environmentally unsafe and hence not economically viable and<br>
environmentally acceptable for large scale production. The reagent iodine for the<br>
decomposition of thiourea is non-corrosive, inexpensive and environmentally safe.<br>
Thus the method of the present invention provides for an economically viable<br>
process for the preparation of carbodiimide. The reaction is rapid and facile and<br>
accomplished under mild conditions whereby the product obtained is in high yields<br>
and purity.<br>
The reagent iodine for the decomposition of 1, 3-disubstituted thioureas is non<br>
corrosive, inexpensive and environmentally safe. Thus the method provides an<br>
economically viable process for the preparation of carbodiimides. The reaction is<br>
rapid and facile and accomplished under mild conditions. The product obtained is in<br>
high yields and high purity after chromatographic purification.<br><br>
Example I: Preparation of 1,3-disubstituted thiourea<br>
Phenyl isothiocyanate (675 mg, 5 mmol) in ethanol 5 mL was added aniline (505 mg,<br>
5 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. After completion of the<br>
reaction solvent ethanol was evaporated and the crude product as obtained was used<br>
as such for the subsequent reaction.<br>
Synthesis for the preparation of the 1, 3-disubstituted thiourea was carried out as<br>
depicted below in Scheme 1<br><br>
Scheme 1<br>
Example II: Manufacture of alkyl and aryl carbodiimide from 1. 3-<br>
disubstituted thiourea in organic solvent<br>
The 1, 3-diphenyl thiourea (456 mg, 2 mmol) obtained as above following Example I,<br>
a base preferably triethylamine (558 µL, 4 mmol) was suspended in a solvent,<br>
ethylacetate (10 mL), which is cooled prior to reaction in an ice bath for 5 minutes.<br>
The reaction or decomposition of 1, 3-disubstituted thiourea was effected by the<br>
addition of a thiophilic halogen, iodine (558 mg, 2.2 mmol) by adding it in a<br>
controlled manner pinch wise. The reaction being exothermic addition of iodine in<br>
pinches was necessary while cooling for the reaction to proceed and to minimize the<br>
side products. Iodine was added in pinches over a period of 15-20 minutes. When<br>
the iodine addition was complete and after 10 minutes a TLC experiment on the<br>
reaction mixture revealed that the reaction was complete and overall time taken for<br>
the completion of the reaction was ~30 minutes. The precipitated sulphur was<br>
filtered and ethylacetate was evaporated in rotary evaporator under reduced<br>
pressure. The residue was redissolved in a water immiscible solvent, hexane (b. p.<br>
60-70 °C). The hexane layer was washed with water and dried over anhydrous<br>
Na2SO4 and subsequently evaporated on a rotary evaporator. The crude product so<br>
obtained was further purified over a short silica gel column (eluted with 100 %<br>
hexane) to give 1, 3-diphenylcarbodiimide in 86 % isolated yield. The above<br><br>
synthetic procedure followed is further briefly outlined below in Scheme 2<br>
hereunder.<br><br>

The above examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and<br>
therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. All<br>
percentages are by weight.<br>
The above exemplary illustration of the process of the invention clearly reveals the<br>
efficient, economic and environment friendly method for the preparation of alkyl and<br>
carbodiimides directed to overcome the difficulties associated with what is already<br>
known in the art in its preparative process. Importantly, it is found by way of the<br>
invention that Iodine being highly thiophilic (electrophilic) in nature can interact with<br>
sulphur (nucleophile) thus assisting the desulphurization process of 1, 3-<br>
disubstituted thiourea. This is facilitated by the abstraction of NH protons by<br>
triethylamine / NaHCO3 present as a base in the reaction medium. Formation of<br>
elemental sulfur as the sole byproduct of the reaction supports the mechanism as<br>
proposed in Scheme 3. Performing the reaction under ice-cold conditions minimizes<br>
the side products. Thus the preferred use of iodine as a thiophilic reagent favours<br>
decomposition of pre-synthesized 1, 3-disubstituted thioureas to carbodiimides.<br>
Controlled addition of iodine in pinches over a time span of 15-20 minutes in the<br>
reaction flask is a prerequisite to prevent side reactions. The mechanism for the<br>
formation of alkyl and aryl carbodiimides is further illustrated in the following<br>
Scheme 3.<br><br><br>
Scheme 3<br>
Thus the examples clearly illustrate an overall simple, fast and efficient process for<br>
the manufacture of alkyl and aryl carbodiimides.<br>
The above process is quick in yielding the said carbodiimides in a short time span of<br>
~30 minutes, more preferably within 15 minutes and in &gt; 98% pure form in good<br>
yields of 58-93 %. It is also noteworthy that the process is very economical for the<br>
inexpensive nature and easy commercial availability of the reagents employed.<br>
Advantageously the process provided in this invention is environmentally safe for the<br>
non corrosive, non toxic nature of the reagents and mild basic conditions needed for<br>
the process. Accordingly the process provided in this invention is favourable with<br>
respect to easy handling of the reagents which are moisture insensitive and non<br>
lachrymators.<br>
The advantage associated with the above said process also resides in the easily<br>
isolable and harmless byproduct such as sulphur which can be separated by simple<br>
filtration. The above process is advantageously also energy efficient since no external<br>
heating is required.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide for a process for the<br>
manufacture of alkyl and aryl carbodiimides which is efficient in terms of energy<br>
needed for activation for the formation of products from reactants, time required and<br>
high purity associated with the isolated yields of the product. The process is<br>
environment friendly especially in terms of non toxic nature of the reagents needed,<br>
mild reaction conditions employed and the harmless by product obtained. It is easy<br>
to operate in terms of the moisture insensitive and non lachrymator reagents needed<br>
for the purpose.<br><br>
