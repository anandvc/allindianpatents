				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>ABSTRACT The invention in general relates to a portable hot air sealing system which can be moved from container to container to seal the containers effectively. It consists of a Hot Air Chamber containing a heater element within, inlet means, regulator means and outlet means to direct the hot air onto the sealing area of a container. A pnoximatic aii- supply means supplies the compressed air at the air inlet. The Inlet means is a check valve to prevent the backward flow of hot air-, regulator means to prevent the excess pressure entering the hot air chamber and the outlet means is a actuated ball valve to prevent the entry of hazardous gas into the system. The hot air from chamber is transferred to sealing gun through a Teflon hose and the sealing gnu is also provided with a hot air receiver and a hot air releaser to seal the container cap. The sealing gun trigger is kept depressed for a predeteriamed time of 2 seconds and then it is released after the sealing. The sensing means is provided to sense the trigger - depress position of the sealing gun to actuate the supply of hot air. Tlie Interlocking sensing m.ean8 is to sense the air pressure in the chamber for controlling the power supply to the heater element, AU the components of this system except the sealing gun and supply means are housed insude a MS Panel and mounted on a trolley.</td>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:•<br><br><br>
According to the present inventiot\ the system for portable hot air sealing of containers consists of a Hot Air Chamber within which is mounted the iieatar element of 1.4 kw. The sakt Hot fiir Chamber Is provided witli Inlet means and OLrtiet means and through the said Ho; Air Chamber compnsssed air flows. The said Hot Air Ciiamber being provided with pneumatic air sup|&gt;iy means at tiie inlet end to supply the compressed air at the air irriet of said Hot fiir Chamber. The said Hot filr Chamber is being provided wfth pressuna nagutator means at the inlet end to prevent excess procure from entering the said Hot Air Chamber. The said Hot Air Chamber is being pravkied with check-valve at the said intet end of said Hot Air Chamber to prevent the hot air to flow backwards. The said Hot Air Chamber is being provided with Actuatjed Bali Vaive means at the outiet of the saki Hot Air Chancier to prevent hazardous gas in the atmosphere going into the system.<br>
Tefton hose is fixed at the outlet end of the said i-k&gt;t Air Chamber to enable the transfer of hot air from said Hot Air Chamber to the sealing gun when required. The sealing gun is fixed at the other end of the said hose. The said sealing gun has hot air receiving means and hot air releasing means.<br>
Intieriocking means is provided to sense the pr\eumatlc si4&gt;piy to Hot Air Chan^3er and thereby to achieve controlled "POWBl - ON' tx&gt; heater ^enrtent thereto.<br><br>
Indication means is provided to sense the 'POWER - ON' and 'SEALING -ON' position of the said system.<br>
The device has means for indicating 'POWER - ON' thus signaling tiie user to first press the said sealing gun for syst»m warm li^, for a pre-debemr^ned and controlled time of depression and later to place the said sealing gun onto tiie PNC seals placed In tiie said cylinder and depress the trigger again. The system has means for indicating 'SEALING - ON', which enables the user bo release the trigger after a pre-determined duration of depression. The s««ling process is now compleba.<br>
The system is such that all said components are mounted on a trolley such that except the said sealing gun and said electrical chamber all other said components are fi»ther herewith housed in a MS Panel nrKiunted on the said trolley. The system is portable and is controlled as here above described. The system is controlled by known electrical and pneumatic control.<br>
Now the operation of the portable hot air sealing system of containers as described herein.<br>
Rrst the electrical power sourre of 15A, 23CV v^ll be kept In switch ' OFF positioa The pneumatic air supply system is switched 'ON* by a pneumatic switch<br><br>
- manually operable and the comprassed air nol* less than 5 ijar is allowed into the<br><br><br>
completed. The system is moved onto next cylinder and the sealing gun placed over the PNC seal placed on the second cylinder and the sealing process is repeated.<br>
The pneumatic supply is switched off when the system is not wortdng.    The sequence of operation of the system nrtay be sunrwTHiri2»d as : -<br>
a)	Supplying compressed air fh3m Pneumatic Air Supply to Hot Air Chamber when the pneunnatic air supply system is switched ^ON'.<br>
b)	Heating the heater element in the hot air chamber by switcMng "Off - red indication of Che Power supply means.<br>
c)	Warming up the system by triggering the Sealing gun when pressed fbr about 1 minute.<br>
d)	Selling process talo^ place by placing sealing gun with PVC seals on the container to be sealed when the sealing gun trigger is kept depressed fbr predetermined duratbn say 2 seconds. 'Sealing OH' - Green indication.<br>
e)	Switch OFF the sealing gun trigger by releasing the trigger when the sealing process is completed.<br>
0 The above process (a-e) is nepeated (breach cylinder to be seated by moving<br>
the system to next cylinder, g) When the process is oampitelo&amp;A, the Pneumatic supply and power supply is<br>
switched off.<br><br>
According tx) the invention, a system which is portable and for hot air sailing of<br><br><br>
wherefn hot compressed air is ejected by triggering the sealing gun onto the sealing area.<br>
It will be tjhat the preferred embodiment of the invention disclosed are well designed to fulfill the objects stated, It will be appreciated that Invention Is weii understood to those skilled in the art and tliat ail ctianges and modifications that come without departing the spirit thereof.<br><br><br>
