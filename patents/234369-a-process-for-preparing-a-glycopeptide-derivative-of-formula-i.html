BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to novel processes for preparing derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics. More specifically, this invention is directed to multi-step processes for preparing derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics having an amino-containing side chain, the steps being conducted in a single reaction vessel without isolation of the intermediate reaction products.<br>
Background<br>
Glycopeptides (e.g. dalbaheptides) are a well-known class of antibiotics produced by various microorganisms {see Glycopeptide Antibiotics, edited by R. Nagarajan, Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York (1994)). Many synthetic derivatives of such glycopeptides are also known in the art and these derivatives are typically reported to have improved properties relative to the naturally-occurring glycopeptides, including enhanced antibacterial activity. For example, WO 00/39156, published July 6,2000, describes various glycopeptide derivatives having a heteroatom-containing side chain, including derivatives having an amino-containing side chain. These amino-containing side chain derivatives are particularly useful as antibiotics and as intermediates for producing additional glycopeptide derivatives.<br>

Process Conditions<br>
The process of the present invention is conducted in a single reaction vessel in multiple steps. The first of these steps involves combining one equivalent of<br><br>
vancomycin or a salt thereof, with one or more equivalents of an aldehyde of formula II::<br><br>
wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined herein, and an excess of a suitable base in an inert diluent to form a reaction mixture. Preferably, from about 1 to about 2 equivalents of the aldehyde are used in this step of the process; more preferably, about 1.1 to about 1.2 equivalents. In this reaction mixture, a mixture of imines and/or hemiaminals is believed to be formed between the aldehyde and the basic nitrogen atoms of vancomycin, i.e., the vancosamine nitrogen atom and the N-terminal (leucinyl) nitrogen atom.<br>
This first step of the present process is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 75°C, preferably at ambient temperature (i.e., about 20-25°C) for about 1 to about 24 hours, preferably for about 6 to 12 hours, or until formation of the imine and/or hemiaminal is substantially complete.<br>
This step of the process and the remaining steps are typically conducted in an inert diluent. Preferably, the inert diluent is N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone, acetonitrile/water, and the like or mixtures thereof.<br>
Any suitable base may be employed in this step to neutralize the vancomycin salt and to facilitate formation of the imine and/or hemiaminal, including organic bases, such as amines, alkali metal carboxylate salt (i.e., sodium acetate and the like) and inorganic bases, such as alkali metal carbonates (i.e., lithium carbonate, potassium carbonate and the like) . Preferably, the base used in this step is a tertiary amine including, by way of illustration, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, 7V-methylmorpholine, and the like. A preferred base is diisopropylethylamine. The base is typically employed in a molar excess relative to vancomycin. Preferably, the<br><br>
base is used in an amount ranging from about 1.5 to about 3 equivalents based on vancomycin; more preferably, about 1.8 to 2.2 equivalents.<br>
When formation of the inrine and/or hemiaminal mixture is substantially complete, the reaction mixture is acidified with an excess of acid. Any suitable acid may be employed in this step of the process including, by way of illustration, carboxylic acids (e.g. acetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, citric acid, formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid and the like), mineral acids (e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid), and the like. Preferably, the acid employed in this step is trifluoroacetic acid or acetic acid. The acid is typically added in a molar excess relative to vancomycin (and the base). Preferably, the acid is used in an amount ranging from about 3 to about 6 equivalents based on vancomycin; more preferably, about 3.5 to 5.5 equivalents.<br>
While not wishing to be limited by theory, it is believed that the acid selectively hydrolyzes the imine and/or hemiaminal formed at the N-terminal amine of vancomycin in preference to the imine and/or hemiaminal formed at the vancosamine nitrogen atom. This acidification step is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 30°C, preferably at about 25°C, for about 0.25 to about 2.0 hours, preferably for about 0.25 to about 1.5 hours. Preferably, a polar, protic solvent is added during this step including, by way of example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropianol, butanol, ethylene glycol, and the like. Alternatively, a mixed polar protic/non-protic solvent may be used, such as methanol/tetrahydrofiiran, methanol/l,2-dimethoxyethane and the like<br>
After the acidification step, the reaction mixture is then contacted with a reducing agent to reduce the imine and/or hemiaminal. Any suitable reducing agent can be employed in this step of the process which is compatible with the functionality present in the glycopeptide. For example, suitable reducing agents include sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, zinc borohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, pyridine/borane, ferf-butylamine/borane, N-methylmorpholine/borane, ammonia/borane, dimethylamine/borane,<br><br>
triethylamine/borane, tximethylamine/borane, and the like. Preferred reducing agents are amine/borane complexes such as pyridine/borane and /er/-butylamine/borane.<br>
This reduction step of the process is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 30°C, preferably at about 25°C, for about 0.5 to about 24 hours, preferably for about 1 to about 6 hours, or until the reduction is substantially complete. Preferably, a polar, protic solvent is present during this reduction step. The polar, protic solvent is preferably added during the acidification step described above.<br>
In contrast to prior procedures, the product of the reductive alkylation process is not isolated but the reaction mixture is contacted with an amine to remove the protecting group (i.e., R3) from the intermediate product. Any suitable amine may be used in this step of the process. Representative amines suitable for use include, by way of example, methylamine, ethylamine, ter/-butylamine, triethylamine, piperidine, morpholine, ammonium hydroxide, and the like. Preferred amines are methylamine, ferr-butylamine and ammonium hydroxide.<br>
This deprotection step of the process is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 60°C, preferably at about 40°C to about 45°C, for about 2 to about 60 hours, preferably for about 3 to about 10 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. The resulting compound of formula I is readily isolated and purified by conventional procedures, such as precipitation and/or reverse-phase HPLC.<br>
The aldehydes of formula II employed in the process of the present invention are well-known in the art and are either commercially available or can be prepared by conventional procedures using commercially available starting materials and conventional reagents. For example, see WO 00/39156, published on July 6,2000, which describes various methods for preparing such aldehydes.<br>
Among other advantages, the process of the present invention provides for improved selectivity, i.e., reductive alkylation at the vancosamine amino group is favored over reductive alkylation at the 7^-terminus (e.g., the leucinyl group) by at least 10:1, more preferably 20:1. Additionally, because the multi-step process is<br><br>
conducted in a single reaction vessel without isolation of the reaction intermediates, the process of the present invention is more efficient, provides a higher yield and generates less waste then previous processes.<br>
The glycopeptide derivatives produced by the process of this invention are useful as antibiotics and as intermediates for the production of antibiotics. See, for example, U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/470,209, filed December 22,1999; and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/847,042, filed May 1,2001; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>

temperature at 20-25°C. Methanol (95 mL) was added in one portion and then 5.2 mL (0.0672) of trifluoroacetic acid were added within 1 minute. The mixture was stirred for 0.25 hours and then 1.39 g (0.016 mol) of borane-/er?-butyl amine complex were added to the reaction mixture in one portion. The addition funnel was rinsed with 5 mL of methanol, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. tert-Butylamine (10.6 mL, 0.101 mol) was added in one portion and the resulting mixture was stirred at 40-42°C for about 7 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and 140 mL of 0.5 N HC1 were added, followed by 600 mL o f a 10% brine solution at room temperature. The resulting mixture was stirred for 2 hours at 20-25°C, and then cooled to 10°C and stirred for 1 hour. The resulting precipitate is collected using a 12.5 cm Buchner funnel by filtering the reaction mixture over a period of about 90 min. The wet cake was washed with cold water (2 x 50 mL) and sucked dry for 5 hours. The resulting material was added to 200 mL of acetonitrile while stirring to 2 hours at 20-25°C. The resulting slurry was filtered through an 8 cm Buchner funnel and the collected wet cake was washed with acetonitrile (2 x 25 mL) and dried under house vacuum (about 25 mm Hg) for 13 hours to afford 31.1 g of crude iVvan-2-(n-decylamino)ethyl vancomycin hydrochloride.<br>
