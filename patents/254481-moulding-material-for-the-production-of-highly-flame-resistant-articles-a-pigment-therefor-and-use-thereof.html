MOULDING MATERIAL FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HIGHLY FLAME<br>
RESISTANT ARTICLES, A PIGMENT THEREFOR AND USE THEREOF<br>
Adding flame retardant material in the form of fine particles to plastics and dispersing<br>
those fine particles through the whole plastic article or in its surface regions is known. As an<br>
example, German patent specification DE-A-101 45 093 describes polyphosphates of organic<br>
nitrogen bases such as guanidine and melamine or melamine derivatives as a flame protection<br>
agent (retardant) in plastics and as a flame proofing agent in textiles. International patent<br>
WO-A-00/02869 describes polyphosphate salts, in particular in glass fibre-reinforced<br>
polyamides and polyesters, as flame protection agents. Other organic nitrogen bases are<br>
proposed in many other publications as flame protection agents, the tendency in this branch of<br>
the industry being to use halogen-free flame protection agents such as aluminium hydroxide,<br>
magnesium hydroxide or melamine cyanurate for that purpose.<br>
When such flame protection agents are distributed in halogen-free thermoplastic plastics,<br>
a disadvantageous effect may occur which changes the properties of the plastic in an undesirable<br>
manner.<br>
In many fields of application, it is desirable to make plastic articles, which have been<br>
made flame-proof, capable of being written or marked using laser light; there is a practical<br>
problem, however, as halogen-free flame-proof flame protection agents do not exhibit sufficient<br>
contrast, and so they turn out to be of no practical use.<br>
The aim of the invention is to provide plastic moulding materials which can ensure that<br>
plastic articles can be made laser-writable without deleteriously affecting the properties of the<br>
plastic. The moulding material of the invention for the production of highly flame resistant<br>
articles with a matrix formed from a thermoplastic and with a particulate pigment dispersed<br>
therein is characterized in that the pigment is light-sensitive and changes colour under the<br>
influence of laser light, and in that the pigment is a reaction product of at least one halogen-free<br>
flame retardant organic nitrogen base with (i) at least one mixed salt with at least two different<br><br>
cations and/or with (ii) a mixture of salt type compounds which on heating can be transformed<br>
into at least one salt type compound with at least two different cations, as in (i), wherein in<br>
variations (i) and (ii), at least one of the cations is selected from a group (A) of elements Ti, Cr,<br>
Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ag, Sn, Sb, La, Pr, Ta, W and Ce and at least one further<br>
cation is selected from a group (B) of elements from periods 3 to 6 of main groups II and III,<br>
periods 5 and 6 of main group IV and periods 4 and 5 of subgroups III to VIII and the<br>
lanthanides of the periodic table of the elements.<br>
Any known plastic may be used as the matrix material, which is described, for example,<br>
in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Chemistry (volume 15, page 457) and which has already been<br>
used for laser marking. Examples of suitable plastics are polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
polyamide, polyester, polyphenylene oxide, polyacetal, polybutylene terephthalate,<br>
polymethacrylate, polyoxymethylene, polyvinylacetal, polystyrene, acrylic-butadiene-styrene<br>
(ABS), acrylonitrile-styrene-acrylic ester (ASA), polycarbonate, polyether sulphone,<br>
polyethylether ketone, polyvinylchloride and thermoplastic polyurethane.<br>
In the context of the present description, polyacetals are polymers which essentially<br>
contain oxymethylene groups (CH2O-). They thus encompass polyoxymethylene<br>
homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers and block copolymers.<br>
In the context of the present description, polyesters are thermoplastic polymers with<br>
repeating ester groups in the main chain. Examples are polycondensation products of<br>
naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid,<br>
sebacinic acid, dodecane dioic acid, cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, mixtures of these carboxylic<br>
acids and ester-forming derivatives with diols such as ethylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-<br>
butanediol, 1,4-butenediol or 1,6-hexanediol, 1,4-hexanediol, 1,4-cyclohexanediol, 1,4-di-<br>
(hydroxymethyl)-cyclohexane, bisphenol A, neopentylglycol, oligo- or poly-ethylene glycols,<br>
oligo- or poly-propylene glycols, oligo- or poly-(tetramethylene) glycols, mixtures of said diols<br>
and ester-forming derivatives thereof as well as with other possible co-monomers.<br><br>
Particularly preferred matrix components are polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene<br>
terephthalate and polyether-ester block copolymers.<br>
In the context of the present description, polyamides are thermoplastic polymers with<br>
repeated acid amide groups in the main chain. They encompass both homopolymers of the<br>
amine carboxylic acid type and diamine-dicarboxylic acid type as well as copolymers with other<br>
possible AA-, BB- and AB-co-monomers. The polyamides which may be used are known and,<br>
for example, are described in the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, 11th<br>
Edition, pages 315 to 489, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, 1988.<br>
Examples of polyamides are polyhexamethyleneadipinic acid amide, polyhexamethylene<br>
azelaic acid amide, polyhexamethylene sebacinic acid amide, polyhexamethylene dodecane dioic<br>
acid amide, poly-l 1-aminoundecane acid amide and bis-(p-amino-cyclohexyI)-methanedodecane<br>
acid amide or products obtained by ring opening of lactams, for example polycaprolactam or<br>
polylaurinlactam. Further, polyamides based on terephthalic or isophthalic acid as the acid<br>
components and/or trimethylhexamethylene diamine or bis-(p-aminocyclohexyl)-propane as the<br>
diamine component, as well as polyamide base resins produced by copolymerization of two or<br>
more of the above polymers or their components, are suitable. An example is a<br>
copolycondensate of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, hexamethylenediamine and caprolactam.<br>
In the context of this description, polyarylenesulphides are thermoplastic polymers with<br>
repeating sulphur groups in the substantially aromatic main chain. They include homopolymers<br>
and copolymers.<br>
In the context of this description, the thermoplastic polymers used as blending partners<br>
can be any other partially crystalline, liquid crystalline and amorphous polymers.<br>
In the context of this description, light-sensitive compounds are organic or inorganic salt<br>
type compounds with the combinations as defined above of different cations or mixtures of salt<br>
type compounds with the combinations as defined above of different cations, which change<br>
colour under the influence of a laser light source at the illuminated areas.<br><br>
Plastic polyurethane (TPU) is particularly suitable because its mechanical properties are<br>
good and it can be processed cheaply. Thermoplastic polyurethanes are well known from many<br>
publications in the literature and from patents.<br>
In variations described in (i) and (ii), the pigment, which is finely dispersed in the<br>
thermoplastic matrix material, consists of a mixed salt with at least two different cations or as yet<br>
non-transformed precursors which, on heating, for example by melting the pigments, produce the<br>
mixed salt of category (i) with at least two different cations.<br>
Highly surprisingly, the metal components, whether as a mixed salt or as a precursor,<br>
produce an improvement in contrast as regards laser-writability or markability and<br>
simultaneously produce an improvement in flame protection.<br>
The inventive effects described above are obtained by dint of the pigment which on the<br>
one hand has flame retardant properties and on the other hand produces laser-writability by<br>
absorption of laser light. This pigment is a reaction product of at least one halogen-free flame<br>
retardant organic nitrogen base with one of the components in accordance with (i) and (ii). The<br>
organic nitrogen base is advantageously melamine or a melamine derivative such as melamine<br>
cyanurate, melamine orthophosphate, di-melamine orthophosphate, melamine pyrophosphate,<br>
melamine polyphosphate, melamine borate, a melamine salt of a phosphorus acid partial ester,<br>
salts of phosphoroxy compounds, ammonium polyphosphate, boron phosphate and combinations<br>
thereof. The flame protection agents used can also be used in triazine polymers, melem, melam,<br>
urea, guanidine etc.<br>
The term "salt type compound or salt" as used in the present invention means compounds<br>
which at least partially dissociate in water into cations and anions or consist of an acid residue<br>
and a base residue.<br>
The term "colour change" can mean a transfer from one tone to another, such as from<br>
yellow to red or from transparent to black. In the context of the invention, this term also means a<br><br>
change in brightness, for example from light brown to dark brown or to a discoloration of the<br>
plastic.<br>
The term "particulate" means that the pigment is in the form of fine solid particles with<br>
quantitative parameters being given as the mean particle size (d50) and the particle size of the<br>
primary particles. The size of the primary particles is in the nanometer to micrometer range.<br>
Suitable primary particles have a mean particle size (d50) of less than 10 urn, preferably less than<br>
5 µm.<br>
Within the scope of the invention, the pigments can also contain further cations, in<br>
particular those from elements from periods 2 to 5 in main group I. It is also possible to add to<br>
the pigments additional inorganic oxides and/or further colour-producing additives and/or usual<br>
additives which modify certain properties, such as UV stabilizers, stabilizers against<br>
efflorescence, thermal and thermo-oxidative attacks, to improve hydrolytic and azidolytic<br>
resistance, lubricants, unmoulding aids, crystallization controlling substances and nucleation<br>
agents, fillers, softeners and other additives.<br>
The colour difference obtained with the pigments of the invention can be observed as a<br>
locally different light intensity under different light sources, as a locally different colour value,<br>
for example in the CIE Lab system or as a locally different colour value in the RGB system.<br>
Normally, the elements are selected so that they have as strong an absorption as possible<br>
in the wavelength range of the laser light which is available.<br>
The wavelength ranges of the laser light employed are principally not subject to any<br>
limitation. Suitable lasers generally have a wavelength in the range 157 nm to 10.6 mm,<br>
preferably in the range 532 nm to 10.6 mm. Examples are CO2 lasers (10.6 mm) and Nd:YAG<br>
lasers (1064 nm) or pulsed UV lasers.<br>
Typical excimer lasers have the following wavelengths: F2 excimer laser (157 nm), ArF<br>
excimer laser (193 nm), XeCl excimer laser (308 nm), XeF excimer laser (351 nm), frequency<br>
multiplied Nd.YAG laser with wavelengths of 532 nm (frequency doubled), 355 nm (frequency<br><br>
trebled) or 265 nm (frequency quadrupled). Particularly preferably, Nd:YAG lasers (1064 or<br>
532 nm) and CO2 lasers are used. The energy densities of the lasers employed in the present<br>
invention are generally in the range from 0.3 mJ/cm2 to 50 J/cm2, preferably 0.3 mJ/cm2 to 10<br>
J/cm2. When using pulsed lasers, the pulse frequency is generally in the range 1 to 30 kHz.<br>
In the context of this description, the term "light-sensitive compounds" means organic or<br>
inorganic salt type compounds with the hereinbefore described combinations of different cations<br>
or mixtures of salt type compounds with the hereinbefore described combinations of different<br>
cations which change colour under the influence of a laser light source at the illuminated areas.<br>
These compounds can be conventional salts with a definite stoichiometry of one or more<br>
anions with a plurality, preferably two cations derived from different elements, but they can also<br>
be non stoichiometric compounds which exhibit at least two cations derived from different<br>
elements.<br>
Any anion can be used, as long as it is possible to produce compounds with cations from<br>
at least two different elements. Preferably, the anions contain at least two different elements.<br>
Particularly preferred components have, as the anions, oxoanions from the periodic<br>
system with the exception of phosphinates and diphosphinates and/or their polymers, also anions<br>
of organic carboxylic acids as well as carbonic acids, provided that mixed compounds with a<br>
plurality of cations can be formed therewith.<br>
Preferred combinations are those in which the non-illuminated compound absorbs in the<br>
region of the light wavelength employed.<br>
More preferred combinations are those in which the base colour of the non-illuminated<br>
compound can be adjusted by varying the mole ratios of the cations.<br>
In one implementation of the invention, the non-illuminated components have any base<br>
colour and the illuminated components have a clearly different colour. In the CIE Lab system,<br>
this means there is a high value for dE*, where:<br><br><br>
index 1 represents the non-illuminated moulding material and index 2 represents the illuminated<br>
moulding material.<br>
The CIE L*a*b* (Lab) system is a colour space established by the International<br>
Illumination Commission (Commission Internationale d'Eclairage) 1976, in which L* =<br>
lightness, a* - red-green colour information and b* = yellow-blue information.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the non-illuminated compound has the<br>
highest possible lightness (thus as high a lightness value L* as possible in the CIE Lab colour<br>
space) and as little as possible a self colour (i.e. as small as possible a deviation from the black-<br>
white axis: smallest possible a*, smallest possible b*). In this case, the illuminated compound<br>
should have as low a lightness as possible (lightness value L* as low as possible) and as little<br>
self colour as possible (smallest possible a*, smallest possible b*).<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the non-illuminated component has as<br>
high a lightness as possible (lightness value L* as high as possible in the CIE Lab colour space)<br>
and as little self colour as possible (as small as possible a deviation from the black-white axis;<br>
smallest possible a*, smallest possible b*). In this case, the illuminated component should have<br>
as clear a self colour as possible (highest possible a* and/or b*).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the composition of the invention, the anions of the above<br>
components have general formula AaOo(OH)y2-, where<br>
A = tri- or penta-valent phosphorus, tetra-valent molybdenum or hexa-valent tungsten;<br>
a, o and z independently represent whole numbers with values from 1 -20; and<br>
y is a whole number with values from 0-10.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the composition of the invention, the pigment has at<br>
least one combination of two different elements of the group consisting of copper, tin, antimony<br>
and iron.<br><br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the composition of the invention, the pigment<br>
contains anions of phosphorus (V) and/or phosphorus (III) acid, their condensation products or if<br>
appropriate with further hydroxide ions, and Cu and Fe or Cu and Sn or Cu and Sb or Sn and Fe<br>
as the cations.<br>
Preferably, metallic salts are used which have a particularly high thermal stability so that<br>
no degradation occurs when the combination product produced by doping is intermingled into<br>
the polymer. Salts or ligands with a thermal stability of over 200°C (2% weight loss), preferably<br>
with a stability of over 250°C (2% weight loss) and more particularly with a stability of over<br>
300°C (2% weight loss) are used.<br>
Light-sensitive flame protection combinations are obtained by doping, reacting and<br>
mixing the organic nitrogen bases with the metallic compounds of components (i) or (ii). The<br>
term "doping" means both the production of mixtures of one or more of said solid ingredients in<br>
the powdered state as well as mixing one or more of said solid ingredients in a dissolved or<br>
suspended state with subsequent drying of the powdered product.<br>
The products of the invention have flame retardant and laser-writable properties.<br>
The invention also concerns pigments for the manufacture of simultaneously flame<br>
retardant and laser-writable plastic articles with the features defined above for the moulding<br>
material. The invention also concerns the use of pigments with the features given above for the<br>
manufacture of similarly flame retardant and laser-writable plastic articles, in particular from<br>
thennoplastic.<br>
Example 1<br>
Pigment for a moulding material of the invention was produced as follows:<br>
Copper hydroxide (0.1 mole) and isocyanuric acid (0.1 mole) were placed in a mixer with<br>
water and mixed by agitation. Thus, a neutralization reaction took place to form a salt. Next, tri-<br>
tin phosphate Sn3(PO4)2 (1 mole) was added. After 30 min, melamine (10 mole) and cyanuric<br><br>
acid (10 mole) were added in an exact ratio of 1:1. The whole mixture was stirred for 1 h and<br>
then vacuum dried at 110°C.<br>
A moulding material of the invention was obtained with the pigment obtained by using<br>
the following ingredients. Its flame resistance and laser-writability were determined.<br>
The laser was a commercially available Nd-YAG laser (wavelength 1064 nra). The<br>
contrast values were determined using a digital camera mounted on a microscope and image<br>
evaluation software. The flame resistance was determined using a UL Box in accordance with<br>
UL94. The CTI values were determined in accordance with standard DIN IEC 60112/VDE 0303<br>
Part 1,RAL 7035.<br><br>
The thermoplastic moulding materials obtained were distinguished by both their superb<br>
flame resistance (self extinguishing) and by their high contrast values (K. value) on laser-writing.<br>
Example 2<br>
Pigment for a moulding material (i) of the invention was produced as follows:<br>
A 50 1 reactor with a stirrer was filled with 29.25 1 of pure water. Orthophosphoric acid<br>
(74.75 mole) was added at ambient temperature with stirring. Because the reaction was<br>
exothermic, the temperature of the reactor contents rose and was maintained at 50°C for 10<br>
minutes. Next, melamine (74.75 mole) was added slowly with stirring, avoiding clumping.<br>
After a homogeneous suspension had been obtained, a mixture of copper hydroxide (0.74 mole)<br>
and iron-II-phosphite (0.29 mole Fe3PO3) was added to the suspension. The whole mixture was<br>
stirred for 1 h at 100°C then the temperature was raised and it was vacuum dried.<br><br>
The doped melamine orthophosphate obtained was transformed into melamine<br>
polyphosphate in a furnace at 340°C. The product was then ground to a fineness of 5 microns.<br>
Polybutyl terephthalate	76 wt %<br>
Melamine cyanurate	9 wt %<br>
Melamine polyphosphate (produced as above)	15 wt %<br>
UL94	VO<br>
Contrast (K value)	4.3<br>
CTI	530 V<br>
This moulding material also had superb flame resistance and laser-writability (K value)<br><br><br>
