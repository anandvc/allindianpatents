				<td>Technical field<br>
This invention involves a compound and hollow insulator and its manufacturing method thereof. The insulator includes a connector, an insulating tube and petticoat. It is applied in HV power station of electric industry.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Presently, power transmission and transformer equipment usually adopt porcelain hollow insulator. However, porcelain insulator is explosive with heavy weight and large volume. It is easy to be broken and requires regular cleaning up. This caused much inconvenience for installation and maintenance.<br>
In order to overcome above insufficiencies of porcelain insulator, a compound and hollow insulator made of organic synthesis material appeared.<br>
The current manufacturing technology mainly includes two: One is to use single petticoat mould for silicon sulfide rubber(RTV) at room temperature to cast petticoat body piece by piece on the special equipment; The other is to use liquid silicon rubber(LSR) and double-component injection pump to inject and form petticoat body at medium temperature (120◘). The shortcoming of these two technologies is that the resistance property for electric corrosion and aging of the product's external insulation are poor. Meanwhile, their technical and economical efficiency are also low.<br>
The weather &amp; aging resistance property and electric corrosion resistance property of high temperature silicon sulfide rubber are extremely good. However, since it is in<br><br>
solid state, high temperature and high pressure are needed for manufacturing. And the<br>
insulating tube of hollow insulator is hollow, which is extremely easy to be broken once<br>
bearing the pressure, especially under high temperature. Therefore, it has not been applied<br>
in manufacturing hollow insulator in HV power station.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
This invention aims at providing a compound and hollow insulator, which is not easy to appear aging and/or chap in petticoat body even under the worst natural environment. Hence, its service life can be lengthened and maintenance workload can be reduced so as to guarantee the safety operation of electrical power system.<br>
At the same time, this invention aims at providing a compound and hollow insulator manufacturing method to simplify and properly control the manufacturing process as well as improve the ratio of qualified products.<br>
In order to solve above technical problems, this invention adopts following technical solution:<br>
A compound and hollow insulator includes a connector, an insulating tube and petticoat. The insulating tube is a hollow one made by winding epoxy glass fiber. The connector is fixed at the two ends of the insulating tube. Outside the insulating tube is an integrated petticoat body. The petticoat material is high-temperature silicon sulfide rubber(HTV).<br>
The compound and hollow insulator with above structure is manufactured by<br>
following methods: Make hollow insulating tube by winding epoxy glass fiber; Place the<br>
insulating tube processed into a mould cavity of petticoat body rubber injection machine;<br>
After the mould of injection machine is locked, the high-temperature silicon sulfide<br>
rubber is injected into the mould cavity through rubber injection machine; Then, petticoat<br>
body integrated with insulating tube is formed after sulfuration(Temperature is controlled<br>
within 150◘ -190◘); Use adhesive to stick the connector onto the two ends of the<br>
insulating tube.<br>
The rubber injection machine in this manufacturing method has heating and pressurization device as well as corresponding monitoring and control system.<br>
Compared with prior art, the compound and hollow insulator manufactured with the method in this invention has obviously following advantages:<br>
1.	Compared with compound and hollow insulator integrated by adhesive between the petticoat currently: This compound insulator petticoat is an integrated body without any bonding surface. There is not any possibility of cracks and thus the structural strength and insulation property are improved;<br>
2.	The petticoat body and insulating tube are bonded into an integrity in this way: the high-temperature silicon sulfide rubber, which will become petticoat body, is heated to a fluid state, injected into the petticoat body mould cavity and evenly surrounds the insulating tube. After cooling and solidification, an integrity is formed. Compared with<br>
current bonding technology, the structural strength of this compound and hollow<br>
insulator is more reliable.<br>
3.	Since the heating temperature of high-temperature silicon sulfide rubber is controlled within 150◘ -190◘ during the rubber injection process, the petticoat internal structure after sulfuration becomes more even and petticoat cracks due to uneven stress can be avoided.<br>
4.	Compared with compound and hollow insulator made of silicon sulfide rubber(RTV) at room temperature: the weather &amp; aging resistance property and electric corrosion resistance property are improved. Its service life is lengthened, material cost is low and manufacturing efficiency is high.<br>
5.	The manufacturing process of this product is simple and can be easily controlled. The ratio of qualified products is extremely high.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawing<br>
See following drawing for detailed embodiment process of this invention: Figure 1 is Half-section Structural Sketch of Compound and Hollow Insulator of This Invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Refer to attached drawing. The compound and hollow insulator of this invention consists of connector 1, insulating tube 2 and petticoat 3. The insulating tube is a hollow<br>
one made by winding epoxy glass fiber. The petticoat 3 is arranged outside the<br>
insulating tube 2 and becomes an integrated body through injecting silicon sulfide rubber<br>
at the high-temperature(HTV). The connector 1 is fixed at the two ends of the insulating<br>
tube.<br>
Petticoat material can be the high-temperature silicon sulfide rubber containing methyl ethenyl silicon rubber(20%~50%), white carbon black(20%~60%), aluminum hydroxide (25%~50%), silicone oil (2%~5%) and vulcanizing agent (1%).<br>
The sulfuration process may be conducted based on product material and sizes in respective 150◘ -190◘ temperature and 20-60min duration. The appropriate sulfuration process has greatly improved the product's electrical and mechanical property as well as aging resistance property.<br>
On the basis of conventional rubber injection machine, the rubber injection machine in this invention is equipped with heating and temperature control device as well as pressurization and pressure control device in order to better control the product quality and improve the qualified product ratio. After Mould Lock, the mould is maintained in a certain temperature range. Meanwhile, following parameters obtained from large numbers of tests can be accurately detected and controlled: mould temperature: 150◘~190◘, Mould Lock pressure: 500t~3000t, rubber injection pressure: 1200-1800bar (MPa). This invention adopts the following manufacturing process: Step one, Make hollow insulating tube 2 by winding epoxy glass fiber, Step two, Put the insulating tube 2 in petticoat mould which is placed in rubber injection machine; Then, close the mould;<br>
Step three, Apply a certain pressure onto rubber injection machine and lock the<br>
mould, so called "Mould Lock";<br>

Step six, Open the mould to take down the insulator; Perform correction and edge trimming. Then, stick the connector onto the two ends of the hollow insulating tube 2.<br>
Meanwhile, the rubber injection machine in this invention is also equipped with a cold flow passage device to ensure no rubber burning occurs in the rubber injection process. Moreover, a mould vacuumizing device is also available to vacuumize the mould after Mould lock so as to avoid air bubbles in the injection process.<br>
The rubber injection machine stated in this invention also has an inner core positioning device which is used to fix the inner core closely related to insulating tube 2. This inner core is made with steel pipe. It can evenly transmit heat and pressure and improve the bearing capacity of hollow insulating tube 2.<br>
In order to properly control the bearing condition of insulating tube 2, the injection machine may be arranged in a way to perform multi-spot injection. The injection spots are uniformly distributed as per multiples of two or three around the mould.<br>
