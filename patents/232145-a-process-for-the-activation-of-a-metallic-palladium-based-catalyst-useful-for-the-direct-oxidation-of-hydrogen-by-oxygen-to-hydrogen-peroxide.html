				<td>This invention relates to a process for the activation of a metallic palladium based catalyst, useful for the direct oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. This invention particularly relates to a process for the activation by bulk oxidation of metallic palladium of a catalyst comprising metallic palladium for drastically increasing its selectivity and yield in the direct oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to hydrogen peroxide and also for drastically decreasing its hydrogen peroxide decomposition activity, and thereby making the catalyst much more useful for the direct oxidation of hydrogen to hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The activated catalyst of the process of this invention can be used in chemical industries for the direct oxidation of hydrogen to hydrogen peroxide. At present, hydrogen peroxide is produced mostly by the anthraquinone process. However, this process is not environmentally clean and also it has a number of limitations (Ref. Goor et.el." Hydrogen peroxide" In Ullaman's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Eds. Elver et.al, p. 443 - 466 , Vol. A13 year 1989, Publisher, VCH Verlangsgeselschft mBH, Weinheim.) . Demand for hydrogen peroxide has been increasing day-by-day for oxidizing organic compounds to value added products, waste-water treatment and water disinfection. Hence, there is a great practical need for replacing the anthraquinone process by an environmentally clean and more economic process such as a direct partial oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to hydrogen peroxide with high conversion and selectivity.<br>
Since the disclosure in U.S. patent 1,108,752 by Henkel et al. that palladium is a catalyst promoting the formation of hydrogen peroxide and water from a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, a number of palladium containing catalysts, useful for the<br><br>
direct oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, have been disclosed by many inventors.<br>
A U.S. patent 4,832,938 by Gosser et al. disclosed a Pt-Pd.bimetallic catalyst supponed on a carbon, silica or alumina support for making hydrogen peroxide from direct combination of hydrogen and oxygen in an aqueous reaction medium. Later, a German patent Ger. Offen. DE 4.127,918 Al by Lueckoff et al. disclosed a supported palladium gold catalyst for the manufacture of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen in aqueous medium; the catalyst contains 5 - 95 wt % Au and is supported on carbon. A number of platinum Group metal containing catalysts: (1) Pt-Group metal on high surface area support, such as carbon, silica or alumina (Ref. U.S. patent 5,169,618); (2) Pt-Group catalyst on solid acid carrier (Ref. Eur. Pat. Appl, EP 504.741. Al); (3) Pt-Group element supported on Mb- or Ta oxide (Ref. PCT Int. Appl. WO 9,412,428 Al), (4) Sn- modified Pt-Group metals supported on catalysts carriers (Ref. Eur. Pat. Appl. EP 621,235 Al); (5) Pt-Group metal catalyst supported on hydrophilic support (Ref. U.S. patent 5.399,334), for the oxidation of hydrogen to hydrogen peroxide are known in the prior art.<br>
A Japanese patent Jpn, Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 01133909 A2 by Kyora disclosed a Pt-Group metal catalyst carried on a hydrophobic support such as porous and hydrophobic Teflon support. Chuang in an European patent EP 3660419 Al disclosed a Group VIII metal catalyst deposited on a hydrophobic support for the manufacture of hydrogen peroxide by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in an aqueous medium. Later , Chuang has disclosed a Group V1I1 metal on a partially hydrophobic and partially hydrophilic support, such as Pd on fluorinated carbon, as a catalyst for the oxidation of hydrogen to hydrogen peroxide, in PCT Int. Appl. WO 93 14025 Al.<br><br>
Inspite of the extensive earlier work disclosed in the prior art. the direct oxidation of hydrogen to hydrogen peroxide has not yet been practiced for the production of hydrogen peroxide. One of the reasons for this is the poor selectivity observed in this process. Fu et.al reported the maximum selectivity of 8.7% for hydrogen peroxide in the oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen over palladium metal supported on fluorided carbon They have also reported that the catalyst having higher hydrogen peroxide decomposition activity shows lower selectivity in the direct oxidation of hydrogen to hydrogen peroxide (Ref. Fu et.al. Stud.Surf. Sci .Catal. Vol. 72, p. 33 - 41, Year 1992). Hence, it is of great practical importance to develop a better catalyst comprising palladium, which has higher selectivity for hydrogen peroxide in the oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to hydrogen peroxide but has lower activity for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide under the similar conditions.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the activation of a catalyst comprising palladium so that the hydrogen peroxide selectivity in the oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen over the catalyst is increased drastically.<br>
An other object of this invention is to provide a process for the activation of a catalyst comprising palladium so that the yield for hydrogen peroxide in the oxidation of hydrogen by-oxygen over the catalyst is increased drastically.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a process for the activation of a catalyst comprising palladium so that the hydrogen peroxide decomposition activity of the catalyst is reduced drastically.<br>
These and other objects are accomplished in this invention by providing a process for the activation of a catalyst comprising palladium metal useful for the direct oxidation of hydrogen to hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the activation of a catalyst comprising metallic palladium . useful for the direct oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, which comprises oxidising the metallic palladium present in a catalyst with<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the activation of a metallic palladium<br>
based catalyst, useful for the direct oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, which<br>
comprises treating the palladium metal containing catalyst with an oxidizing agent such as herein<br>
described to oxidize the metallic palladium to palladium (II) oxide (PdO) and optionally calcining<br>
the treated catalyst at a temperature in the range from 50°C to 500°C to obtain the desired<br>
activated palladium containing catalyst.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the oxidizing agent used is selected from the group<br>
consisting of perchloric acid (HC1O4) , hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitrous oxide (N2O), oxygen<br>
and air.<br>
In yet another embodiment the calcination temperature of the treated catalyst is in the range from<br>
100°Cto 300°C.<br>
In still another embodiment a process is carries out not only a surface oxidation but also at least a<br>
partial bulk oxidation of the metallic palladium, present in the catalyst.<br>
In the process of this invention, the activation of a catalyst comprising metallic palladium by its<br>
treatment with an oxidizing agent involves at least a partial bulk oxidation of the metallic<br>
palladium to palladium oxide. Examples of the oxidizing agents are perchloric acid, perbromic<br>
acid, periodic acid, hydrogen peroxide, nitrous oxide, oxygen or air, potassium permagnate,<br>
potassium dichromate and the like. The oxidizing agent for the process of this invention is<br>
preferably selected from perchloric acid (HC104), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitrous oxide (N2O),<br>
oxygen and air.<br>
The catalyst comprising palladium metal may contain a palladium metal, with or without one or<br>
more of other noble metals, such as platinum, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium and osmium and also<br>
with or without one or more promoter metals, such as tin, gold and other metal promoters,<br>
supported on catalyst carriers such as, carbon, alumina, silica-alumina, silica, zeolites, zirconia,<br>
thoria, ceria and other metal oxides or mixed metal oxides in form of powder, particles, pellets,<br>
extrudes or  monolith and structured metallic catalyst supports.<br>
In the process of this invention, the activation of said catalyst by its treatment with an oxidizing<br>
agent  may  be   carried   out  in   a  liquid phase or in a vapour phase, depending up on the state<br>
of     the    oxidizing   agent.     The   catalyst    activation   by    a    liquid<br><br>
oxidizing agent, such as perchloric acid and hydrogen peroxide may be earned out in a liquid phase at a temperature below about 100°C. and after the activation, the treated catalyst may be dried and calcined under vacuum or under air or innert gas   such as nitrogen, helium or argon, at a temperature below 500°C. preferably at a temperature in the range from 100°C to 500°C. Whereas the catalyst activation by a gaseous oxidizing agent, such as nitrous oxide and oxygen or air, may be carried out in a gas phase at temperature at or below about 500°C, and in this case, after the activation there is no need to dry or to calcine the treated catalyst.<br>
In the process of this invention, the role of the oxidizing agent is to oxidize the bulk palladium metal from said catalyst to palladium oxide, at least partially and the role of the calcination of the treated catalyst is to dry and/or to remove by decomposing the oxidizing agent remained in the treated catalyst.<br>
The product of the process of invention is an activated catalyst comprising palladium oxide, useful for the direct oxidation of hydrogen to hydrogen peroxide<br>
By the process of this invention a catalyst comprising metallic palladium is activated by the bulk oxidation of its metallic palladium at least partially to palladium(II) oxide, and thereby the hydrogen peroxide decomposition activity of the catalyst is decreased drastically, and consequently the selectivity and yield for hydrogen peroxide in the direct oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to hydrogen peroxide over the catalyst are increased by several folds.<br>
The present invention is described with respect to the following examples illustrating the process of this invention for the activation of a catalyst comprising palladium metal, useful for direct oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. These examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention<br><br>

The concentration of hydrogen in the reactor effluent gases was measured by an on-line hydrogen gas analyzer. The H^O? formed in the oxidation reaction was determined quantitatively by measuring the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the reaction medium, after the reaction, by the idometric titration method<br>

according to the reaction :   H2O2    →  H20     +      0.5   O2   ,   was measured<br>
quantitatively as a function of time, by collecting it over water using a constant pressure    gas    collector    described    earlier    (Choudhary    et.al.    Ind.Eng.Chem Fundamental. Vol. 21. p. 472, year 1982).<br>

Table 11 :    Results on the Pd - Pt / Ga2O3 with and without the activation by the air treatment<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
From   the   results   in   all   the   above    1 1   examples,   following   important observations or conclusions can be made:<br>
1    After the activation by the process of this invention,  the metallic palladium present in the different catalysts is partially oxidized to PdO<br>
2.	Because of the catalyst activation by the process of this invention, the selectivity<br>
and yield for H2O2 in the direct oxidation of H2 to H2O: are increased bv several<br>
folds and also in most cases the H2 conversion is also increased<br>
3.	Because of the catalvst activation bv the process of this invention, the hydrogen<br>
peroxide decomposition activity of the catalvst is reduced drastically<br><br>
Important Novel Features and Advantages of the process of this invention are as follows:<br>
1. By the process of this invention, the catalysts comprising palladium metal are activated by treating them with an oxidizing agent and thereby the hydrogen peroxide selectivity and yield of the catalysts in the direct oxidation of H: to H202are increased by several folds.<br>
2.	In the activation of catalysts by the process of this invention . there is a bulk<br>
oxidation of at least a part of palladium, present in the catalyst, to palladium<br>
oxide.<br>
3.	Because of the activation of the catalysts comprising palladium by the process<br>
of this   invention,   the  hydrogen  peroxide  decomposition  activity  of the<br>
catalysts is reduced drastically, and thereby the selectivity for the formation of<br>
hydrogen peroxide in the direct oxidation of H; to H^O: is increased.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A process for the activation of a metallic palladium based catalyst, useful for the<br>
direct oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, which comprises<br>
treating the palladium metal containing catalyst with an oxidizing agent such as<br>
herein described to oxidize the metallic palladium to palladium (II) oxide (PdO) and<br>
optionally calcining the treated catalyst at a temperature in the range from 50°C to<br>
500°C to obtain the desired activated palladium containing catalyst.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the oxidizing agent is selected from the<br>
group  consisting of perchloric  acid,  perbronic  acid,  periodic  acid,  hydrogen<br>
peroxide nitrous oxide, potassium permanganate potassium dichromatic &amp; mixtures<br>
thereof<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claims 1-2, wherein the calcination temperature of the<br>
treated catalyst is in the range from 100°C to 300°C preferably.<br>
4.	A process for the activation of a catalyst comprising metallic palladium , useful for<br>
the direct oxidation of hydrogen   to hydrogen peroxide, substantially as herein<br>
described with reference to the examples.<br></td>
