LUBRICATING  OIL   ADDITIVE,    LUBRICATING  OIL AND  WORKING  FLUID  FOR  REFRIGERATORS<br>
BACKGROUND  OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
1.     Field  of  the  Invention<br>
The  present  invention  relates   to  a  lubricating oil   imparting  excellent  wear  resistance,   an  additive used   for   the   lubricating  oil,   and   a  working   fluid   for refrigerators  using  the  lubricating  oil.     In particular,   the  present   invention  relates  to  a lubricating  oil   suitable   for   refrigerant  compressors using  hydrofluorocarbon  refrigerants,   and  a  working fluid   for   refrigerators  which   comprises   the lubricanting oil   and  a  hydrofluorocarbon  refrigerant.<br>
Refrigerant  compressors   are  used  in domestic refrigerators,   automotive  air  conditioners, refrigerators   for  industrial  use  and  room  air conditioners,   while  refrigerants   which  have  been  used for  such  refrigerant  compressors  include chlorofluorocarbons   (hydrocarbons  wherein  all  of  the hydrogen  atoms  have  been  replaced  by  chlorine  and fluorine  atoms)   and  hydrochlorofluorocarbons (hydrocarbons  wherein  some  of   the  hydrogen  atoms  have been  replaced  by  chlorine  and   fluorine  atoms).     From the  standpoint  of  environmeulal  protection,   however, it  has  been  decided  to  restrict  the  use  of  these refrigerants,   and  therefore  attention  is  now  paid  to hydrofluorocarbons   (hydrocarbons  which  are  non-chlorinated,   i.e.,   do  not  contain  any  chlorine  atom, and  in  which  at  least  some  of  the  hydrogen  atoms  are replaced  by  fluorine  atoms;   hereinafter  referred  to  as "HFC  refrigerants")   as  substitutes  for  the  above<br><br>
refrigerants.     HFC  refrigerators  which  have  already been  proposed  include  Rl34a,   R125,   R32,   R143a  and Rl52a   (which  are  each  composed  of  a  single hydrofluorocarbon)   and  R407C,   R410A  and  R410B   (a mixture  of  hydrofluorocarbons) .<br>
2.     Description  of  the  Prior  Art<br>
When  an  HFC  refrigerant  is  used,   it   is  difficult to  use  a  conventional  mineral   lube  base  oil. Therefore,   it  has  been  proposed  to  use  a polyoxyalkylene  glycol,   polyhydric  alcohol   ester, polyether  or  polycarbonate  as  a  lube  base  oil.<br>
The  use  of   an  HFC  refrigerant  results   in  a relatively  poor  lubrication.     Further,   copper  and aluminum  materials  as  well   as   iron  materials   are  used as   a  material  constituting   the  frictional  surfaces  of a  refrigerant  compressor,   so  that  the  lubricating  oil used  in  the  compressor  is  required  to  improve  the  wear resistance  of   frictional  surfaces  made  of  such  a ferrous  or  non-ferrous  material  satisfactorily.     Known additives  used   for  satisfying  such  requirement   include alkanediols  having  8   to   14   carbon  atoms   (Japanese Patent  Laid-Open  No.   199296/1991),   phosphoric  esters, phosphorous  esters  and  partial  esters  of  polyhydric alcohols  with   fatty  acids   (WO  91/09097),   alcohol derivatives  having  two  hydroxyl  groups  and  having   a  C1 to  C18  alkyl,   aryl,   alkylaryl  or  aralkyl  group  which has  other  polar  group   (Japanese  Patent  Laid-Open  No. 337391/1992)   and  so  forth.     These  additives  have problems  that  the  wear  resistance  of  frictional surfaces  cannot  be  improved  sufficiently,   that  the corrosion  of  metal  occurs  in  the  compressor,   that  they tend  to  harden  rubbers  and  resins  to  cause  leaks  in<br><br>
the  seal  or   joint  of   the  compressor,   and  that   sludge is   formed  owing  to  thermal  degradation  or  oxidation  to lower  the  heat  exchange  efficiency,   though  they exhibit  some  effect.     Thus,   the  above  additives  have not  been  evaluated  as  being  sufficiently  fit  for practical  use.<br>
SUMMARY  OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
The   present   invention  aims   at   solving   the   above problems  and  an  object  thereof  is  to  provide  a lubricating  oil  which  can   impart  excellent  wear resistance,   which  does  not  corrode  metallic substances,   which  does  not  harden  sealants  made  of, for  example,   rubbers  or  resins,   and  which  little   form<br>
additive   used   for   the  lubricating  oil;   and   a  working fluid   for  refrigerators  using   the  lubricating  oil.<br>
The   inventors  of   the  present   invention  have intensively  studied  for  the  purpose  of  solving  the above  problems   to  find  that   the  lubricating  properties (such  as   antiwearing  effect)   of  a  lubricating  oil   can be  remarkably   improved  by  adding  a  specific  partially etherified  polyhydric  alcohol   thereto.     The  present invention  has  been  accomplished  on  the  basis  of  this finding.<br>
Namely,   the  present   invention  relates   to   (1)   a lubricating  oil  additive  comprising  a  partially etherified  polyhydric  alcohol  which  has  at  least  two hydroxyl  groups  and  bears  at  least  one  aliphatic hydrocarbon  group  having  at  least  one  double  bond  in  a state  bonded  through  an  ether  linkage,   as  an  active component;   (2)   a  lubricating  oil  comprising  an<br>
effective  amount  of  a  partially  etherified  polyhydric<br>
I<br><br>
alcohol  which  has  at  least  two  hydroxyl  groups  and bears   at   least  one  aliphatic  hydrocarbon  group  having at  least  one  double  bond  in  a  state  bonded  through  an ether  linkage  and  a  lube  base  oil;   and   (3)   a  working fluid  for  refrigerators,   which  comprises  a  refrigerant and  a  lubricating  oil  as  set  forth  in  the  item   (2).<br>
DETAILED   DESCRIPTION  OF  THE   PREFERRED  EMBODIMENTS<br>
The   lubricating  oil  additive  of   the  present invention  is   composed  of  a  partially  etherified polyhydric  alcohol  which  has  at  least   two  hydroxyl groups  and  bears  at  least  one  aliphatic  hydrocarbon group  having  at   least  one  double  bond  in  a  state bonded  through  an  ether  linkage.     The  additive according  to  the  present   invention  must   satisfy  the requirements   that   it   should  have   at   least   two  hydroxyl groups  and  that   the  hydrocarbon  group  forming   the ether  linkage  should  have  at  least  one  double  bond. In  such  a  case,   the  additive   is  excellent   in   the solubility  in  a  lube  base  oil  and  can  impart  such excellent  lubricating  properties  as  to  improve  the wear  resistance  of  frictional  surfaces  remarkably. Further,   such  an  additive  has   the  characteristic  of little   swelling  the  rubber  or  resin  constituting   the seal   in  contact  with  a  lubricating  oil.<br>
These  characteristics  of   the  partially etherified  polyhydric  alcohol  bearing  an  aliphatic hydrocarbon  group  having  at  least  one  double  bond are  surprising  ones  beyond  expectation,   in  other words,   peculiar  ones.<br>
This is because a partially etherified polyhydric alcohol bearing riot an aliphatrc hydrocarbon  group  having  at  least  one  double  bond<br><br>
but  an  alkyl   group  having  a  corresponding  number  of carbon  atoms  or  an  aryl  group  bonded  through  an  ether linkage   is  so  poor  in  the  solubility   in  a  lube  base oil  as   to  fail   in  imparting  excellent  lubricating properties.     Further,   a  partially  etherified polyhydric  alcohol  bearing  a  relatively  short  alkyl group  cannot  also  impart  excellent  lubricating properties,   though  it   is  excellent   in  the  solubility in  a  lube  base  oil.<br>
It   is  preferable   from   the   standpoints   of   the solubility   in  a  lube  base  oil   and  the  prevention  of rubbers  or  resins   from  swelling  that   the  aliphatic hydrocarbon   group  having  at   least   one  double  bond which  constitutes   the  lubricating  oil  additive according   to  the  present   invention   is  one  having   12   to 24   carbon  atorr.c,   ctill   preferably   15   to   20   carborx atoms.      Further,   it   is   preferable   in   chemical stability   that   the  aliphatic  hydrocarbon  group  have one  carbon-carbon  double  bond,   though  it  may  have   two or  more  double  bonds.     Furthermore,   a  partial  ether  as described  above  wherein  the  double  bond  is  present  in the  inside  of  the  hydrocarbon  chain  is  easily available  favorably.     Additionally,   the  aliphatic hydrocarbon  group  having  at  least  one  double  bond   is preferably  linear  because  the   lubricating  properties are  more  excellent  than   those  of  one  wherein   the  group is  branched.     The  partially  etherified  polyhydric alcohol  according  to  the  present  invention  may  bear two  or  more  aliphatic  hydrocarbon  groups  having  at least  one  double  bond  in  a  state  bonded  through  ether linkages  respectively.     The  aliphatic  hydrocarbon group  having  at  least  one  double  bond  may  contain oxygen  atom(s)  o'r  hydroxyl  group   (s).     Examples  of  the aliphatic  hydrocarbon  group  having  at  least  one  double<br><br>
bond   include<br>
CH3(CH2)5CH=CH(CH2)2CH2-   (4-dodecenyl), CH3(CH2)8CH=CH(CH2)2CH2-   (4-tetradecenyl), CH3(CH2)8CH=CH(CH2)3CH2-   [physeteryl   (5-pentadecenyl)],   CH3(CH2)5CH=CH(CH2)7CH2-   [palmitoleyl (9-hexadecenyl)],   CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7CH2-   [oleyl   (9-octadecenyl)],   CH3(CH2)5CH=CH(CH2)9CH2-   [vaccenyl (11-octadecenyl)],   CH3(CH2)9CH=CH{CH2)7CH2-   [gadoleyl (9-icosenyl)],   CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)9CH2-   (11-icosenyl), CH3{CH2)gCH=CH(CH2)9CH2-   (11-docosenyl), CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)11CH2-   (13-docosenyl), CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)-13CH2-   (1 5-tetracosenyl) , CH3(CH2)3(CH2CH=CH)2(CH2)7CH2-   [linoleyl   (9,12-octadecadienyl)],   CH3(CH2CH=CH)3(CH2)7CH2-   [linolenyl (9,12,15-octadecatrieny1)J,<br>
CH3(CH2)3(CH2CH=CH)3(CH2)4CH2-   [6,9,12-linolenyl (6,9,12-octadecatrienyI)],   CH3(CH2)3(CH=CH)3(CH2)7CH2-. [eleostearyl   (9,11,13-octadecatrienyl)], CH3(CH2)5(CH2CH=CH)2(CH2)5CH2-   (8,11-icosadienyl)   and CH3(CH2)5(CH2CH=CH)3(CH2)3CH2-   (5,8,11-icosatrienyl).<br>
The  polyhydric  alcohol  constituting  the partially  etherified  polyhydric  alcohol  according  to the  present   invention  is  one  having  3  to  10   carbon atoms,   preferably  3   to  6  carbon  atoms,   and  preferable examples   thereof   include  glycerol,   pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol,   1,4-sorbitan  and  1,5-sorbitan.<br>
The  lubricating  oil  additive  according  to  the present  invention  is  composed  of  a  partially etherified  polyhydiic  alcohol  wherein  an  aliphatic hydrocarbon  group  having  at  least  one  double  bond  is bonded  to  a  hydroxyl  group  through  an  ether  linkage, and  preferable  example  of  such  an  additive  will  now  be<br>
descr-ibed.<br>
Such  examples  include  glycerol  derivatives<br><br>
represented  by   the   formula   (1),   trimethylolpropane derivatives  represented  by   the  formula   (2),    1,4-sorbitan  derivatives  represented  by  the  formulae   (3) and   (4),   and  1,5-sorbitan  derivatives  represented  by the  formulae   (5)   and   (6).     The  partially  etherified polyhydric  alcohol  according  to  the  present  invention may  have   three  or  more  hydroxyl  groups  as   represented by   the   formula   (3).<br><br><br><br>
[in  the   formulae   (1)   to   (6),   R  represents  an  alkenyl group  having   12   to   24   carbon  atoms]<br>
Among   these   rompounds,   glycerol   derivatives   and 1,4-sorbitan  derivatives  are  preferable,   the  glycerol derivatives  being  still   preferable.      It   is  preferable for   the  polyhydric  alcohol  derivative  of   the  present invention  to  satisfy  one  or  both  of   the  requirements that  the  ether  linkage  be  bonded  to  the  carbon  atom adjacent  to  the  carbon  atom  to  which  a  hydroxyl  group is  bonded  and   that  at  least   two  hydroxy!   qrr&gt;up-z  ho bonded   to   two  of   three  successive  carbon  atoms respectively.<br>
Specific  examples  of  such  a  partially  etherified polyhydric  alcohol  include  glycerol  monooleyl  ether, 1,4-sorbitan  monooleyl  ether,   1,4-sorbitan monolinolenyl   ether  and   1,5-sorbitan  monooleyl  ether. These  ethers  may  have  other  functional  group.<br>
The  above  partially  etherified  polyhydric alcohol  can  be  prepared  by   (i)   a  process  of -reacting  a corresponding  partial  chloride  of  a  polyhydric  alcohol<br><br>
(such  as  glycerol  a-monochlorohydrin  or  glycerol     6-monochlorohydrin)   with  R-OH  or  R-ONa,    (ii)   a  process of  reacting  a  trihydric  or  higher  alcohol  with  R-Cl, (iii)   a  process  of  reacting  epichlorohydrin  with  R-OH to  form  a  glycerol  monoether  or  the  like.<br>
The  partially  etherified  polyhydric  alcohol  must be  used  in  an  amount  enough  to  prevent  the  wear  of  the surfaces   to  be  lubricated.     Specifically,   the  amount is   0.01   to   10%  by  weight,   preferably   0.1   to   5%  by weight,   still  preferably   0.2   to  2%  by  weight  based  on the  lubricating  oil.     Generally,   the  partially etherified  polyhydric  alcohol   is  used  in  an  amount soluble  in  a  lube  base  oil   and  one  which   is   easily soluble  in  a  lube  base  oil   is  selected.<br>
The  lube  base  oil  used  in  the  present   invention includes  mineral  oils  prepared  in  petroleum  refining, alkylbenzenes,   carbonate  esters  and  so  forth.     When the  lube  base  oil  is  used  for  a  refrigerant compressor,   however,   it  is  preferable  ftom  the standpoint  of   solubility   in  HFC  that  the   lube  base  oil be  mainly  composed  of  a  polyether  or  a  polyhydric alcohol  ester.     Polyethers  are  compounds  having  plural ether  linkages   in  one  molecule  and  include  compounds (e.g.,   polyoxyalkylene  glycols)   having  plural  ether linkages   in  their  principal  chains,   compounds   (e.g., polyvinyl  ethers)   having  plural  ether linkages  in  their  side-chains,   cyclic  ethers   (e.g., crown  ethers)   having  ether  linkages   for  ring formation.   '  The  ratio  of  carbon  atoms/oxygen  atoms   in the  polyethers  used  in  the  present  invention  are preferably  in  the  range  of  2  to  8  and  more  preferably in  the  range  of  2  to  4.<br>
In  order  to  improve  the  wear^resistance  of frictional  surfaces  effectively,   it  is  preferable  that<br><br>
the  polyoxyalkylene  glycol   compound  be  selected  from among  mono-  and  di-alkyl  ethers  of  polyoxypropylene glycol  as  represented  by  the  following  formula   (7)   and mono-  and  di-alkyl  ethers  of  polyoxypropylene-oxyethylene  glycol  as  represented  by   the   following formula   (8)   (which  are  generically  called  "PAG derivatives"  hereinafter):<br>
(7)<br>
  (8) wherein  R     represents  an  alkyl  group  having   1   to  4<br>
carbon  atoms;   R     represents  an  alkyl  group  having   1   to<br>
1	2<br>
4   carbon   atoms   or  a  hydrogen   atom,   with  R     and  R<br>
being  the  same  as  or  different  from  each  other;   m  and n  each  represent  an  average  degree  of   polymerization; and   (PO)j^(EO)^  represents  a  random  or  block  copolymer group.     When  a  PAG  derivative   is  used   in  a  state  mixed with   an   HFC  refrigerant,    the  derivative   is   preferably one  having  such  an  average  degree  of  polymerization  as to  exhibit  a  viscosity  of  5   to   20  cSt   at   100°C  and   the m/n  ratio  preferably  ranges   from  9   :   1   to  7   :   3.     The terminal  hydroxyl  group  of  the  PAG  derivative  may  be esterified.     A  mixture  of  two  or  more  of  the  above  PAG derivatives  may  be  used.<br>
On   the  other  hand,   a  polyhydric   alcohol   ester prepared   from  a  polyhydric  alcohol  having   2   to  6 hydroxyl  groups  and  a   fatty  acid  can  be  also   favorably used  as  the  lube  base  oil  according  to  the  present invention.      In  particular,   it  is  preferable  that   the polyhydric  alcohol  ester  be  a  neutral  one  prepared  by reacting  a  polyhydric  alcohol  of  a  neo-type  skeleton having  five  carbon  atoms  with  a  monobasic  saturated fatty  acid  and/or  a  dibasic  saturated  fatty  acid.     The polyhydric  alcohol-includes  neopentyl  glycol, trimethylol  propane,   pentaerythritol  and<br><br>
dipentaerythritol.     The  monobasic  saturated   fatty  acid may  be  a  branched  one  of  non-neo  type  having  5   to  9 carbon  atoms  or  a  mixture  thereof  with  a  linear monobasic  saturated  fatty  acid  having  5   to  8  carbon atoms.     It  is  preferable  that  the  above  branched monobasic  saturated  fatty  acid  have  a  methyl  or  ethyl group  at   the  a-  or  fl-position  carbon  atom.      It   is   to be  noted  that  a  pplyhydric  alcohol  ester  prepared  with a  fatty  acid  having  1   to  4  carbon  atoms  is  problematic in  lubricating  properties,   resistance   to  hydrolysis and  anticorrosiveness  for  metals.<br>
Specific  examples  of   the  branched  monobasic saturated   fatty  acid   include   2-methylpentanoic  acid, 2-ethylpentanoic  acid,   2-methylhexanoic  acid,   2-ethylhexanoic  acid,   2-methylheptanoic  acid,   2-ethylheptanoic  acid  and   3,5,5-trimothylhexanoic   acid, while  those  of   the  linear  monobasic  saturated   fatty acids   include  n-pentanoic  acid,   n-hexanoic  acid,   n-heptanoic  acid  and  n-octanoic  acid.     A  dibasic   fatty acid,   such  as   succinic  acid,   glutaric  acid,   adipic acid,   pimelic  acid  or  the  like,     may  be  used  together with  the  above  monobasic  saturated  fatty  acid  to prepare  a  lube  base  oil  made  of  a  complex  ester  having a  relatively  high  viscosity.     Among  the  polyhydric alcohol   esters  described  above,   a  mixture  comprising  a neopentyl  glycol   ester  and  a  pentaerythritol  ester   is particularly  preferable   in  virtue  of  its  high solubility  in  an  HFC  refrigerant,   though  a  composition excellent  in  heat  stability,   resistance  to  hydrolysis and  anticorrosiveness  for  metals  may  be  suitably selected  from  among  the  above  polyhydric  alcohol esters.     It  is  preferable  that  the  acid  value  of  the<br>
ester  bg , 0.1   mgKOH/g  or  below,   still  preferably  0.02	-i<br>
mgKOH/g  or  below.<br><br>
The  lubricating  oil   according  to  the  present invention  may   further  contain  various  additives   and examples   thereof  include  other  abrasion  prevention agent,   antioxidant,   stabilizer,   antifoaming  agent  and metal  deactivator.     In  particular,   the  addition  of  a phosphate  is  preferable,   because  it  can  further improve  the  wear  resistance  of   iron-iron  materials. As  such  phosphates,   there  may  be  mentioned  aryl phosphates  and  alkyl  phosphates,   including  preferably phosphates  having   18   to  70   carbon  atoms,   more preferably  phosphates  having  18  to  50  carbon  atoms. Among  them,   aryl  phosphates,   especially   triaryl phosphates  may  be  preferably  added.     It   is  still preferable   to  add,   as  the  triaryl  phosphate,   both triphenyl  phosphate  and   tri(alkylphenyl)   phosphate. These   triaryl   phosphaLes   are  added   in  a  total  amount of   0.1   to   5.0%   by  weight,   preferably   0.3   to  4.0%  by weight.     When  the  total  amount  is  less  than  0.1%  by weight,   the  anti-wear  effect  of  oil  on  frictional surfaces  will  not  be   improved  satisfactorily,   while when  it   exceeds   5.0%  by  weight,   not  only  the  wear resistance  will  not  be  additionally  improved  but  also sludge  will  be   formed  in  an  increased  amount unfavorably  by   the  degradation  of  phosphate.<br>
Specific  examples  of  the  tri(alkylphenyl) phosphate  include   tricresyl  phosphate,   tris(3,5-dimethylphenyl)   phosphate,   tris(2,4-dimethylphenyl) phosphate,   tris(mono-n-butylphenyl)   phosphate,-tris(mono-t-butylphenyl)   phosphate  and tris(isopropylphenyl)   phosphate.     Among  these phosphates,   tricresyl  phosphate  is  fitted  for practical  use  and  tris(p-t-butylphenyl)   phosphate  is most  excellent  in  resistance  to  hydrolysis.     The  above phosphates  may  be  used  each  alone  or  as  a  mixture  of<br><br>
two  or  more  of   them.<br>
The  lubricating  oil  according  to  the  present invention  may  further  contain  other  conventional additives  at  need,   and  examples  of  such  additives include  metal  deactivators  such  as  benzotriazole derivatives  and  alkenyl  succinate  esters;   antioxidants such  as  DBPC   (2,6-di-t-butyl-p-cresol)   and  p,p'-dioctyldiphenylamine;   and  epoxy  stabilizers   for  HFC refrigerants   such  as   2-ethylhexyl  glycidyl  ether, sec-butyl  phenyl  glycidyl  ether  and  monoglycidyl ethers  having  an  acyl  group  having  5   to   10  carbon atoms.<br>
The  lubricating  oil  according  to  the  present invention   is  mixed  with  a  refrigerant   to  give  a working   fluid  suitably  usable   for  refrigerant compressors  of  domectic  refrigerators,   automotive  air conditioners,   refrigerators   for  industrial  use  and room  air  conditioners.     The  weight  ratio  of   the lubricating  oil   to  the  refrigerant  may  generally  range from  10   :   90   to  90   :   10,   particularly  preferably  from 20   :   80   to  80   :   20.      It   is  preferable  that  the refrigerant  to  be  used  be  a  hydrofluorocarbon  one prepared  by  replacing  some  of   the  hydrogen  atoms  of  a hydrocarbon  having   1   or  2  carbon  atoms  by   fluorine atoms,   for  example,   1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane   (Rl34a), pentafluoroethane   (R125),   difluoromethane   (R32), 1,1,1-trifluoroethane   (Rl43a)   or   1,1-difluoroethane (Rl52a).     Alternatively,   a  mixture   (e.g.,   R407C, R410A,   R410B,   etc.)   of  two  or  more  of   these hydrofluorocarbon  refrigerants  can  be  used.     The viscosity  of  the  lubricating  oil  may  be  suitably controlled  and  is  generally  5   to  500  cSt  as  determined<br>
at  40°C.      Specifically,,^	a  lubricating  oil  exhibiting  a<br>
viscosity  of  8  to  32  cSt  at  40°C  is  suitable  for<br><br>
domestic refrigerators; one exhibiting a viscosity of 25 to 100 cSt at 40 "^C is suitable for room air consitioners and refrigerators for industrial use; and one exhibiting a viscosity of 8 to 30 cSt at lOO^C is suitable for automotive air conditioners.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a lubricating oil for use in refrigerators using a refrigerant mainly composed of one or more hydrotluorocarbons, said lubricating oil comprising: (a) an effective amount of lubricating oil additive comprising a partially etherified polyhydric alcohol which has at least two hydroxyl groups and bears one or two alkenyl groups having one to three double bonds and 12 to 24 carbon atoms as an active component in an amount of 0.1 to 5% by weight based on the total weight of the lubricating oil, said alkenyl groups each being attached to said polyhydric alcohol through an ether linkage (b) an effective amount of a phosphate in an amount of 0.1 to 5% by weight based on the total weight of the lubricating oil and (c) a lube base oil which is mainly composed of a polyhydric alcohol ester or a polyether.<br><br>
For  the  Examples   and  Comparative  Examples,   test oils  were  prepared  and  evaluated.<br>
Base  oil   1   is  a  mixed  fatty  acid  ester  of polyhydric   alcohol,   specifically,   a  neutral  ester prepared  by  the  reaction  of  a  branched  saturated  fatty acid  mixture  comprising  2-ethylhexanoic  acid  and 3,5,5-trimethylhexanoic  acid  with  pentaerythritol  and exhibiting  a  viscosity  of   64   cSt  at   40°C.<br>
Base  oil  2  is  a  mixture  of  two  polyhydric alcohol   esters,   specifically,   a  mixture  comprising  80% by  weight  of  a  neutral  ester  prepared  by  the  reaction of  neopentyl  glycol  with   2-ethylhexanoic  acid  and  20% by  weight  of  a  neutral   ester  prepared  by   the  reaction of  pentaerythritol  with  2-ethylhexanoic  acid  and exhibiting  a  viscosity  of   10   cSt  at   40°C.<br>
Base  oil   3   is  a  polyoxyalkylene  glycol  dimethyl ether  having  a  structure  represented  by   the   following formula   (9)   and  exhibiting  a  viscosity  of   19  cSt  at 100°C:<br>
CH3-0-[(PO)j„(EO)n]-{EO)Q-CH3      (9) wherein   [ (PO)j^(EO) j^]   represents   a  random  copolymer group;    (n   +   o)/m   is   0.2;   and   n/m   is   0.1.<br>
Glycerol  monooleyl  ether   (hereinafter<br><br>
abbreviated  to  "GMOE")   and   1,4-sorbitan  monooleyl ether   (hereinafter  abbreviated  to   "SMOE")   were  used  as the  partially  etherified  polyhydric  alcohol  additives. The  glycerol  monooleyl  ether  used  was  identified  by<br>
elemental  analysis  and  based  on  the  absorption  at  3425<br>
-1	—1	-1	—1<br>
cm     ,   2926  cm   ',   1465  cm       and   1124  cm   '   as   found  in<br>
the   infrared  spectroscopic  analysis.     The   1,4-sorbitan<br>
monooleyl  ether  used  was   also  identified   in  a  similar<br>
manner   to  that  described  above.<br>
Further,   tricresyl  phosphate   (hereinafter abbreviated  to  "TCP")   and  triphenyl  phosphate (hereinafter  abbreviated  at  "TPP")   were  used  as phosphate  additives,   while  glycerol  monooleate (hereinafter  abbreviated  to   "GMO")   and  sorbitan monooleate   (hereinafter  abbreviated   to   "SMO")   were used  as   comparative  additives.<br>
The  compositions  of   test  oils  prepared  by   the use  of  the  base  oils   1,   2  and  3   are  given   in  Tables   1 to  3   as  Examples   1   to   12   and  Comparative  Examples   1   to 9.     Each  test  oil   contains   0.1%   by  weight  of  DBPC  as an  antioxidant.<br>
The  test  oils  were  each  mixed  with  an  HFC refrigerant   to   form  working   fluids.     These  working fluids  were  subjected  to   (1)   wear  test,   (2)   stability test  and   (3)   actual-machine  wear  test.     The  wear   test (1)   was   conducted  by  the  use  of  a  Falex  friction machine  under  the  following  conditions  and  the wear  thus  determined  are  given  in  Tables   1   to  3.<br>
block  material:     AISI-1137<br>
pin  material:     SAE-3135<br>
load:     300  lb<br>
number  of  revolutions:      290  rpm<br>
^i4_4emp.:      60°C<br>
refrigerant:     injection  of  Rl34a   (70  ml/min)<br><br><br><br><br>
The  stability  test   (2)   was  conducted  by  the sealed  tube  method.     A  mixture  comprising  each  test oil  and  an  HFC "refrigerant   (Rl34a)   at  a  volume  ratio of   7   :   3  was  put   in  a  glass   tube   together  with  iron, copper  or  aluminum  catalyst  based  upon  JIS  K2211,     The resulting  glass  tube  was  sealed  and  kept  at  175°C  for 336  hours   to  determine  whether  the  appearance  changed or  not.      In  all  of  the  Examples  and  Comparative Examples,   there  was   found  neither  change   in  the appearance  nor  formation  of  sludge.<br>
The  actual-machine  wear  test   (3)   was  conducted by  charging  a  working  fluid  comprising   400  ml   of  each test  oil  and  590  g  of  an  HFC  refrigerant   (R407)   into  a compressor   (rotary  type  refrigerant  compressor)   of  a domestic  refrigerator.     The  compressor  was  run  for endurance  test  under  the  following  conditions  and<br>
thereafter  disassembled  to  determine  the  wears  of  the<br>
roller  and  the  vane.     Further,   the  resulting<br><br>
lubricating  oil  was   analyzed  for  metal  content.     The results  are  given  in  Table   4.   The  HFC  refrigerant R407C   is  a  mixture  comprising  R32,   R125   and  Rl34a  at  a weight  ratio  of  23   :   25   :   52.<br>
discharge  side  pressure:      27  kg/cm^G<br>
intake  side  pressure:      5   kg/cm  G<br>
discharged  gas  temp:     110°C<br>
running  time:      600  hours   (continuous  running)<br>
frequency:     60  Hz<br><br>
As  described  above,   the  partially  etherified polyhydric  alcohol  of  the   lubricating  oil  additive -according  to  the  present  invention 'bears  an  aliphatic hydrocarbon  group  in  a  state  bonded  through  an  ether<br><br>
linkage  and  it   is  essential   that   the  aliphatic hydrocarbon  group  have  at  least  one  double  bond.     When the  aliphatic  hydrocarbon  group  is  saturated,   the solubility   in  a  lube  base  oil  will  be  poor.      In  order to  demonstrate   this,   the   following  test  was  conducted.<br>
0.2  or  0.4%  by  weight  of  each  of   the   following glycerol  ethers  was  added  to  the  above  base  oil   1   to prepare   a   lubricating  oil.      Each  lubricating  oil  was mixed  with  a  refrigerant   (R134a)   at  a  volume  ratio  of 1    :   9.      The   floe   points   of   the  working   fluids   thus prepared  were  determined  according  to  JIS   K2211.     The results   are  as   follows   (unit:   °C):<br>
Additive	0.2  wt%	0.4   wt%<br>
glycerol  monooleyl  ether   {C18  alkenyl)	-15	-10<br>
glycerol   rr.onostearyl   ether   (C18   alkyl)	23	31<br>
glycerol   monocetyl   ether   (C16   alkyl)	18	25<br>
Floc  point  refers   to  a  temperature  at  which  an additive  is  precipitated.     It  can  be  understood   from the  above  results   that  the  addition  of  a  glycerol alkyl  ether  in  such  an  amount  as  to  lower  the  wear sufficiently   is  difficult  owing  to  the  poor  solubility thereof.<br>
The   lubricating   oil   and  working   fluid   for refrigerators   according   to  the  present   invention contain  a  partially  etherified  polyhydric  alcohol which  has   at   least   two  hydroxyl  groups   and  bears  at least  one  hydrocarbon  group  having  at  least  one  double bond  in  a  state  bonded  through  an  ether  linkage,   so that  they  can  impart  excellent  wear  resistance  and little  causes  the  corrosion  of  metal  or  the  formation of  sludge.     The  lubricating  oil  is  suitable, particularly  for  refrigerant  compressors  using .<br><br>
hydrofluorocarbon  refrigerants.<br><br><br>
