				<td>Method and Device for Treating Bottles or Similar Containers<br>
The invention pertains to a method according to the introductory part of patent claim I as<br>
well as a device according to the introductory part of patent claim 21.<br>
In case of bottle cleaning machines it is known (DF 30 06 490 A1) that an accumulation-<br>
and /or speed-up area of the conveying system feeding the bottles at the bottles inlet of<br>
the cleaning machine is designed as a fluid bath, in which the bottles are taken up over a<br>
portion of their height in order to achieve a reduction in sound emission caused by the<br>
bottles knocking against one another in the accumulation- and /or speed-up area. At the<br>
same time, in this fluid bath spraying of the bottles with water takes place through at least<br>
one spraying head or nozzle head arranged above the movement path of these bottles.<br>
The problem in cleaning of bottles or similar containers in bottle- or container-cleaning<br>
machines arises particularly in case of such bottles that are provided with self-adhesive<br>
labels made of e.g. paper, synthetic substance or a compound substance. Such labels can<br>
be removed from the respective container only with great difficulty and moreover have<br>
the great disadvantage that they generally coil up or roll up while being peeled off. This<br>
not only hinders detaching of these labels from the bottles taken up in the bottle cells of<br>
the bottle baskets of a cleaning machine, particularly when the cross-section of these<br>
bottle cells are relatively closely matched to the outer cross-section of the bottles, but also<br>
removing the peeled-off but totally or partially rolled up labels from the bottle cells<br>
becomes difficult due to the tight space conditions in the bottle cells and also because the<br>
self-adhesive properties are still retained wholly or partly in the peeled-off labels. At least<br>
a portion of the labels thus get dragged by the bottle cells within the cleaning machine.<br>
In order to ensure removal of the labels from the bottle cells, it is perhaps also necessary<br>
to increase the measurements of the bottle cells, which then in case of same<br>
measurements of a cleaning machine would drastically reduce its cleaning capacity<br>
(cleaned bottles per unit of time).<br><br>
Besides, in order to at all achieve detaching of'the self-adhesive labels, it is necessary to<br>
increase the capacity of the label removal system generally present in a cleaning machine<br>
and working with a volume flow, which at least requires an increased motor capacity and<br>
causes additional energy consumption.<br>
It is the task of this invention to present a method with which such disadvantages can be<br>
avoided. This task is fulfilled by means of a method according to patent claim 1. A device<br>
for conducting the method is part of the object of the patent claim 19.<br>
The invention foresees that the containers, before being introduced into the actual bottle<br>
cleaning machine - a bottle cleaning machine of known type -, is treated in such a way<br>
that at least a large portion of the self-adhesive labels is removed from the containers. For<br>
this, the containers and particularly the self-adhesive adhesive layer between the<br>
containers and the labels are heated in a pre-treatment phase in such a way that the self-<br>
adhesive adhesive layer of the respective label is transformed through heating into a soft<br>
or at least viscous condition, and the labels can be completely removed from the<br>
containers in a subsequent main treatment phase with a treatment medium used in this<br>
treatment phase.<br>
In the main treatment phase, the containers arc for example treated with a heated fluid<br>
treatment medium or splashed-off and/or sprayed-off with a heated treatment medium<br>
exiting from nozzles under high pressure, preferably in such a way that the jets of the<br>
treatment medium meet the container outer surface tangentially or almost tangentially at<br>
an acute angle, so that the labels are peeled off with these high pressure jets.<br>
The special advantages of the method as per the invention or the device as per the<br>
invention are among others as follows:<br>
-	A safe and reliable detachment of the labels takes place.<br>
-	The major portion of the labels thus no longer lands in the cleaning machine. This<br>
significantly increases the service life of the cleaning mediums used in the cleaning<br><br>
machine, especially leaching solutions, and thus significantly reduces the consumption<br>
of cleaning medium and chemicals.<br>
-	Moreover, the drainage load is significantly reduced, and that too with simultaneous<br>
reduction in costs for the cleaning process.<br>
-	Besides, with the method as per the invention also the capacity and space requirement<br>
of the mediums to be provided in the cleaning machine for label removal as well as<br>
disposal of removed labels can be significantly reduced.<br>
Extensions of the invention form object of the sub-claims. The invention is described in<br>
more details below on the basis of figures of design examples. The following are shown:<br>

along with a bottled arranged in this cell with partially detached self-adhesive<br>
label;<br>

of the invention;<br>
Fig.7 the treatment zone shown in figure 6, in side partial view<br>
In the figures 1 denotes bottles or similar containers that are provided with a self-<br>
adhesive label 2 made of paper, synthetic material or a compound substance.<br>
Figure I shows in a very simplified depiction a bottle crate 4 of a bottle- or container-<br>
cleaning machine 5 having several bottle cells 3, with which the bottles 1 fed through a<br>
conveying stretch 6 are transported for cleaning from a container inlet 5.1 through<br><br>
different cleaning zones to a container outlet 5.2, from which the cleaned bottles 1 are<br>
then guided away for further application through a conveyor stretch 7 (Fig. 2).<br>
As indicated in figure I, especially the self-adhesive labels 2 tend to get detached from<br>
the bottles I in the cleaning machine 5 or in the treatment zones there by rolling-in of the<br>
label edges. Due to this rolling-in, removal of the labels from the bottles 1 and out of the<br>
bottle cells 3 gets hindered, as already mentioned above.<br>
In order to avoid these already mentioned disadvantages, a device 8 is pre-connected to<br>
the cleaning machine 5, which exclusively serves the purpose of detaching the labels 2<br>
from the bottles 1. The device 8 consists of mainly two sections, namely a section 8.1 for<br>
separating the vertically standing bottles 1 over a conveying mechanism 9, i.e. bottles 1<br>
oriented with their bottle axis in vertical direction, and a section 8.2 in which detaching<br>
of the labels 2 takes place by heating and e.g. by splashing-off and/or sideways spraying-<br>
off (even with high pressure water- and /or steam jets), so that the bottles 1 whose labels<br>
2 have been removed then land through the conveying stretch 6 on to the bottle inlet 5.1<br>
of the cleaning machine 5.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show the device 8 more in detail, and particularly its section 8.2. A<br>
device-internal conveyor mechanism is denoted by 10, with which the bottles I are<br>
moved standing upright through the section 8.1 and subsequently in the bottles stream<br>
through the section 8.2, distanced from one another. The section 8.2 is composed of<br>
several part-sections, in the depicted design form altogether four part-sections or<br>
treatment zones 11-14.<br>
In the treatment zones 11 and 12 respectively pre-heating or heating up of the bottles 1<br>
(pre-treatment phase) takes place, especially in such a way that due to this heating up the<br>
adhesive layer of the labels 2 is transformed to a soft condition for easy detachment<br>
through heating. For heating, the bottles in the treatment zones 11 and 12 are treated from<br>
above or even from the side with hot water. For this, in the treatment zones 11 and 12<br>
above the movement path of the bottles I and also sideways from this movement path,<br><br>
nozzle heads 15 or 16 each with several nozzle orifices are foreseen, from which the hot<br>
water is brought out on to the bottles 1 passing by.<br>
Below the conveying mechanism 10 in each treatment zone 11 or 12 a water collecting<br>
tub 17 with a suitable drainage 18 is foreseen. Within the collecting tub 17 there is a<br>
screen, for example a screen 19 formed by a circulating screen belt, with which alien<br>
substances or solid components, e.g. labels 2 already detached in the treatment zones 11<br>
and 12, are removed and taken away. The water collected in the collection chamber 20<br>
through the drainage 18 is recycled through a screen 21, a pump 22 and a heating unit 23<br>
to the nozzle heads 15 and 16. For supplementing the water dragged through the screen<br>
19 while removing the alien substances, a valve-controlled water supply 17.1 is foreseen.<br>
The bottles 1 heated in the treatment zones 11 and 12 in the pre-treatment phase are then<br>
splashed over with hot water in the subsequent treatment zones 13 and 14 (main<br>
treatment phase). For this, the treatment zones 13 and 14 in principle have the same<br>
design structure as described for the treatment zones 11 and 12, however with the<br>
difference that the quantity of water brought out during splashing over on the bottles 1 is<br>
greater than the water quantity used during heating of the bottles I in the treatment zones<br>
11 and 12, and the nozzle heads 15 and 16 have enlarged nozzle orifices. The water used<br>
during splashing-over has a temperature just below boiling point, e.g. a temperature of<br>
approximately 95°C. It has been seen that at this water temperature the labels 2 generally<br>
get detached from a bottle in only a few seconds, e.g. in maximum 10 seconds, and then<br>
can be removed by the screen 19 formed by circulating screen belts or similar removal<br>
unit foreseen in the treatment zones 12 and 13.<br>
The device 8 and particularly also its section 8.2 is designed as modular type, i.e. the<br>
individual treatment zones 11 - 14 are designed identical or almost identical in the<br>
already described manner and can be combined into the device 8 according to<br>
requirement. In doing so, especially also the number modules or treatment zones used for<br>
pre-treatment or pre-heating the bottles 1 and/or for removing the labels 2 (main<br>
treatment can be selected according to the respective case of application.<br><br>
Above, one started on the premise that heating of the bottles 1 in the treatment zones 11<br>
and 12 takes place with hot water. Even other methods are possible. Thus the bottles 1 or<br>
the self-adhesive layer of the labels 2 can also be heated by other gaseous, vaporous<br>
and/or fluid mediums, particularly also with steam or hot air, in order to ultimately<br>
achieve detachment of the labels in the treatment zones 13 and 14. One can also think of<br>
other possibilities of pre-heating the bottles 1, e.g. with infrared-radiation and/or through<br>
treatment with electromagnetic waves (microwaves), the last mentioned especially if the<br>
adhesive layer of the self-adhesive labels 2 contains an electrically conductive additive or<br>
filling substance, so that during pre-heating with microwave radiation mostly only this<br>
adhesive layer is heated for fluidisation or softening of the adhesive.<br>
It was also assumed above that removal of the labels in the treatment zones 13 and 14<br>
takes place by splashing off with hot water. Here too there are other possibilities, e.g.<br>
sideways spraying-off or peeling-off of the labels 2 by means of high pressure water jets,<br>
e.g. with the help of hot high pressure water jets etc.<br>
Figure 5 shows a'device 8a that is different from the device 8 mainly in that the pre-<br>
treatment or pre-heating of bottles 1 moved distanced from another by the conveying<br>
mechanism 10 through the treatment zones 24 - 27 takes place in a controlled manner in<br>
the treatment zones 24 and 25 and similarly also removal of the labels 2 by splashing-<br>
over and/or sideways spraying-off in the treatment zones 26 and 27, i.e. through<br>
controlled release of the respective treatment medium. Tor this, a sensor unit 28 is<br>
foreseen at the outlet of the treatment zone 25, i.e. at the transition from this treatment<br>
zone to the treatment zone 26, e.g. a sensor unit that determines the temperature of the<br>
passing bottles 1, so that through a control unit 29 allocated to the sensor unit 28 and by<br>
controlling the valves 30 and 31 the quantity of hot water brought out through the nozzle<br>
heads 15 can be regulated to achieve the most optimum pre-heating of the bottles 1 with<br>
optimum energy consumption.<br><br>
If pre-heating of the bottles 1 in the treatment zones 24 and 25 does not take place with<br>
hot water, but as described above, with another medium, e.g. steam, hot air, infrared- or<br>
microwave energy etc., then the quantum of energy fed to the bottles 1 through this<br>
medium is accordingly controlled by the sensor unit 28 and the control unit 29. The<br>
sensor unit 28 has, for example, additionally a camera system that is a component of an<br>
image processing and/or evaluation unit, with which the ratio of bottles 1 with and<br>
without labels 2 is determined and then accordingly through the control 29 and valves 33<br>
the quantity of hot water brought out of the nozzles 34 for splashing-off the bottles is<br>
controlled.<br>
Another sensor unit 35 is foreseen at the transition between the treatment zones 26 and<br>
27. This sensor unit is also a camera system of an image processing or image evaluation<br>
unit 36, with which again the portion of bottles 1 with and without label 2 is determined.<br>
Then through the control 29 and by corresponding controlled activation of valves 37<br>
splashing-off of the bottles 1 takes place through the nozzles 38, and by controlled<br>
activation of the valves 39 sideways spraying-off of the bottles 1 and/or peel ing-off of the<br>
labels 2 takes place through nozzles 40, and that too always controlled according to the<br>
ration of number of bottles I with and without labels 2.<br>
The functions of the central control unit 29 and the image processing and/or image<br>
evaluation unit 32 and 36 are preferably combined in a common control, e.g. in a<br>
common control formed at least partially by a computer.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show as another design form a treatment zone 41, which like the<br>
treatment zones 11 - 14 or 24 - 27 can be combined together with additional treatment<br>
zones into a device for detaching the labels 2 from the bottles I. The treatment zone 41<br>
again includes the device-internal conveying mechanism 10, on which the bottles 1<br>
standing upright are moved through the treatment zone 41 on the conveying stretch 42<br>
formed by this conveying mechanism. On both sides of the conveying stretch 42 two<br>
clamping jaws conveyors 33 and 34 are foreseen that are respectively formed by two<br>
endless circulating driven belts 45 that border the conveying stretch 42 sideways with<br><br>
their inner-lying lengths 45.1 and lie sideways against the bottles I, and that too against<br>
their circumference surface outside the labels 2 to be detached. In the depicted design<br>
example, the lower belt 45 of each clamp-jaw conveyor 43 or 44 lies with its length 45.1<br>
against the bottles 1 in the region of the bottle base or a little above this bottle base, and<br>
the upper belt 45 lies with its length 45.1 against the bottles 1 at the bottle body,<br>
somewhat at the transition to the tapering bottle neck.<br>
Each belt forms a closed loop that is arranged with its loop plane in a horizontal or almost<br>
horizontal plane. Furthermore, each belt 45 is guided over at least two rollers 46 and 47<br>
and slide rollers or guides (not shown). Out of the rollers, at least the rollers 47 of each<br>
clamp-jaw conveyor 43 or 44 are arranged on a common shaft driven by a drive 48. The<br>
distance between both the clamp-jaw conveyors 43 and 44 or the inner lying lengths 45.1<br>
is selected in such a way that the bottles I distanced from one another and passing the<br>
treatment zone 41 are held clamped between the clamp-jaw conveyors 42 and 44.<br>
The belts 45 of the clamp-jaw conveyor 43 and the belts 45 of the clamp-jaw conveyor 44<br>
are driven with different speeds, as indicated in figure 6 by arrows B and C, so that while<br>
passing the conveying stretch 42 the bottles 1 get rotated around their vertical bottle axis.<br>
Above the conveying stretch 42 again nozzle heads are foreseen, e.g. spray pipes 49 with<br>
nozzles 49.1 for bringing out the respective treatment medium, i.e. while using the<br>
treatment zone 41 for the pre-treatment phase for bringing out the pre-treatment medium<br>
heating the bottles I, or while using the treatment zone 41 for the main treatment phase<br>
for bringing out the fluid treatment medium (e.g. hot water) for final removal of the<br>
labels 2. Against the conveying stretch 42, additionally spraying pipes 50 with nozzles<br>
50.1 are arranged on the side, with which the bottles I moving past are treated sideways.<br>
Especially while using the transport zone 41 for the main treatment phase, the spray<br>
nozzles are oriented in such a way that the jets (e.g. fan-like jets) of the fluid treatment<br>
medium coming out of these are oriented tangentially or almost tangentially on to the<br>
circumference of the passing by bottles 1. An additional spray pipe 51 with several<br><br>
nozzles 51.1 is foreseen below the conveying stretch 42 or the movement path of the<br>
bottles.<br>
By using the clamp-jaw conveyors 43 and 44 there is especially also the possibility of<br>
designing the conveying stretch 42 at least for a part of it length without the conveying<br>
mechanism 10 forming the stand surface for the bottles 1, so that the nozzles 51.1<br>
foreseen below the conveying stretch 42 can have its full impact.<br>
The invention was described above on the basis design examples. It is obvious that<br>
alterations or deviations are possible without deviating from the basic concept of the<br>
invention.<br>
Thus, for example, it is also possible that in relation to the signals delivered by the sensor<br>
units 28 and 35 not only the individual treatment zones 24 - 27 is controlled but the<br>
entire plant, in which case then instead of two sensor units 28 and 35 only one sensor unit<br>
is foreseen at the container outlet of the device 8a.<br>
There is also the possibility of providing suitable sensors or sensor units before each<br>
treatment zone in such a way that for each bottle 1 it is individually checked, whether on<br>
the bottle 1 still one or more labels 2 are stuck. In relation to this checking, the capacity<br>
of the subsequent treatment zone is then controlled or regulated in total and/or even the<br>
capacity of only individual function elements, e.g. nozzles. This regulation can also take<br>
place in such a way that the respective treatment medium is given off by only such<br>
nozzles, in whose influence range the concerned container finds itself.<br>
The invention was described above for devices for treating bottles. It is obvious that these<br>
devices can also be similarly suited for other containers for removal of self-adhesive<br>
labels. Furthermore, the device according to the invention is not only suitable for<br>
detaching self-adhesive labels but also for detaching labels that have been applied with<br>
another adhesive or glue application on the respective bottle or on the respective<br>
container.<br><br>
In the above described design forms, the containers or bottles I were moved as single-<br>
track contain flow through the various treatment zones 11- 14 or 24 - 27 or 41. It is<br>
obviously also possible to design the device in such a way that the containers or bottles 1<br>
are moved in a multi-track container flow or bottle flow through the device, whereby then<br>
through corresponding guide landings several parallel lanes are formed for respectively<br>
one container flow and the individual nozzles are foreseen in corresponding distribution<br>
above and/or sideways and/or below these lanes.<br>
