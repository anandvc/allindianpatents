				<td>Method and apparatus for coating a carrier<br>
This invention relates to a method for coating a carrier<br>
with a coating suspension. More particularly, this invention<br>
relates to a method and an apparatus for coating carriers for<br>
catalysts, for example automotive exhaust-gas catalysts.<br>
As a rule, the carriers for automotive exhaust-gas cata-<br>
lysts are of a cylindrical shape with two faces and a shell<br>
surface, and a large number of flow ducts for the exhaust<br>
gases of the internal combustion engines extend from the<br>
first face to the second face essentially in parallel to the<br>
cylinder axis. These carriers are also referred to as honey-<br>
comb carriers.<br>
The cross-sectional shape of the carriers depends on the<br>
installation requirements in the motor vehicle. Carriers hav-<br>
ing a round cross-section, an elliptical or triangular cross-<br>
section are widely used. The flow ducts mostly include a<br>
square cross-section and are arranged in a closely packed<br>
grid pattern over the entire cross-section of the carriers.<br>
Depending on the application, the duct or cell density of the<br>
flow ducts varies between 10 and 140 cm-2. Honeycomb carriers<br>
having cell densities of up to 250 cm-2 are being developed.<br>
For purifying automotive exhaust gases, catalyst carri-<br>
ers obtained by extruding ceramic bodies are mainly used. Al-<br>
ternatively, catalyst carriers made of corrugated and wound<br>
metal foils are available. For purifying passenger car ex-<br>
haust gases, ceramic carriers having cell densities of 62 cm'2<br>
are still being used predominantly. The cross-sectional di-<br>
mensions of the flow ducts are 1.27 x 1.27 mm2 in this case.<br>
Wall thicknesses of such carriers range between 0.1 and<br>
0.2 mm.<br>
In order to convert the pollutants contained in automo-<br>
tive exhaust gases, such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and<br>
nitrogen oxides, into harmless compounds, very finely divided<br>
metals of the platinum group are typically used, the cata-<br>
lytic effect of which may be altered by compounds of non-<br>
noble metals. These catalytically active components must be<br>
deposited onto the carriers. However, it is impossible to<br>
guarantee the required very fine dispersion of the catalyti-<br>
cally active components by depositing these components onto<br>
the geometrical surfaces of the carriers. This applies<br>
equally to the non-porous metallic and porous ceramic carri-<br>
ers. A sufficiently large surface for the catalytically ac-<br>
tive components may be provided only by applying a support<br>
layer of finely divided (i.e. in powder form), high-surface<br>
area materials onto the internal surfaces of the flow ducts.<br>
In the following, this operation is referred to as coating of<br>
the carrier. Coating the shell surface of the carriers is not<br>
desired and should be avoided in order to prevent loss of<br>
valuable catalytically active materials.<br>
A suspension of the finely divided, high-surface area<br>
materials in a liquid phase, normally water, is used for<br>
coating the carriers. As high-surface area support materials<br>
for the catalytically active components, typical coating sus-<br>
pensions for catalytic applications include, for example,<br>
aluminum oxides, aluminum silicates, zeolites, silicon diox-<br>
ide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide and oxygen-storing com-<br>
ponents on the basis of cerium oxide. These materials consti-<br>
tute the solids content of the coating suspension. In addi-<br>
tion, soluble precursors of promoters or catalytically active<br>
noble metals of the platinum group in the periodic table may<br>
also be added to the coating suspension. The solids concen-<br>
tration of typical coating suspensions ranges between 20 and<br>
65 wt.-% based on the total weight of the suspension. They<br>
exhibit densities between 1.1 and 1.8 kg/1.<br>
According to the prior art, various methods for deposit-<br>
ing the support layer onto the carriers using the coating<br>
suspension or slurry are known. In order to coat the carri-<br>
ers, they may be dipped into the coating suspension or coated<br>
by pouring the coating suspension over them. It is also pos-<br>
sible to pump or suck the coating suspension into the ducts<br>
of the carriers.<br>
In any case, surplus coating material must be removed<br>
from the ducts of the carriers by suction or by blowing-off<br>
with compressed air. This will also open ducts which may have<br>
become blocked by coating suspension.<br>
After coating, the carrier and the support layer are<br>
dried and then calcined in order to solidify the support<br>
layer and fix it to the carrier. Subsequently, the catalyti-<br>
cally active components are introduced into the coating by<br>
, impregnation, using mostly aqueous solutions of precursor<br>
compounds of the catalytically active components. As an al-<br>
ternative, the catalytically active components may already be<br>
added to the coating suspension itself. In this case, subse-<br>
quent impregnation of the completed support layer with the<br>
catalytically active components may be omitted.<br>
An essential criterion of the coating methods is the<br>
coating or loading concentration which can be achieved in a<br>
single run using these methods. This signifies the solids<br>
content left on the carrier following drying and calcination.<br>
The coating concentration is indicated in grams per liter of<br>
volume of the carriers (g/1). In practice, coating concentra-<br>
tions of up to 300 g/1 are needed for automotive exhaust-gas<br>
catalysts. If the method used is incapable of applying this<br>
quantity in a single run, the coating operation, following<br>
drying and, if necessary, calcination of the carrier, must be<br>
repeated until the desired loading is achieved. Frequently,<br>
two or more coating operations using coating suspensions of<br>
different compositions are performed. As a result, catalysts<br>
are obtained which include several layers stacked on top of<br>
each other and having different catalytic functions.<br>
DE 40 40 150 C2 describes a method in which catalyst<br>
carriers having a honeycomb shape may be coated uniformly<br>
with a support layer and a catalytically active layer, re-<br>
spectively, over their entire lengths. Below, catalyst carri-<br>
ers will also be referred to as honeycomb carriers. According<br>
to the method described in DE 40 40 150 C2, the cylinder axis<br>
of the honeycomb carrier is aligned vertically for coating.<br>
Then, the coating suspension is pumped into the ducts through<br>
the lower face of the honeycomb carrier until it emerges at<br>
the upper face. After that, the coating suspension is pumped<br>
down again, and surplus coating suspension is blown or sucked<br>
out of the ducts in order to prevent the ducts from becoming<br>
blocked. This method produces support layers which exhibit<br>
good uniformity over the entire length of the honeycomb car-<br>
riers.<br>
The coating method described above includes a certain<br>
variation in coating quantities from one carrier to the<br>
other. This variation depends on the nature of the coating<br>
suspension and on the characteristics of the honeycomb carri-<br>
ers to be coated, such as their porosity, for example.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an im-<br>
proved method and an improved apparatus for coating carriers,<br>
especially carriers for catalysts, with a coating suspension,<br>
which enable the variation in coating quantities to be re-<br>
duced.<br>
This object is solved with the features according to the<br>
claims.<br>
Before describing the invention in detail, a number of<br>
terms will be explained below.<br>
In the following, the term "bodies" means inert carriers<br>
for catalytically active coatings.<br>
As used below, wet uptake or wet coating quantity de-<br>
scribes the quantity of coating suspension remaining on the<br>
carriers after coating and before a possible drying opera-<br>
tion. It may be determined by weighing the carrier before and<br>
after coating.<br>
By contrast, dry uptake is the quantity of coating mate-<br>
rial present on the carriers following drying and calcina-<br>
tion.<br>
In the following, target quantity means the wet uptake<br>
which is absolutely necessary in order to achieve the re-<br>
quired catalytic activity and which no coated carrier must<br>
fall short of.<br>
This invention relates to a method and a corresponding<br>
apparatus for coating open-pored bodies with at least one<br>
coating suspension. The coating suspension includes solids<br>
and solutes in a liquid medium. Coating is performed using a<br>
quantity in wet state which is to correspond to at least a<br>
required target quantity. The coating operation has a varia-<br>
tion in the applied wet coating quantity from one body to the<br>
other. The method according to the invention is characterized<br>
by the steps of:<br>
a) coating a body with an actual quantity of the coating<br>
suspension which is always greater than the required target<br>
quantity taking the variation of the coating operation into<br>
account,<br>
b) determining the difference between the actual quan-<br>
tity and the required target quantity, and<br>
c) reducing the difference between the actual quantity<br>
and the target quantity by removing still wet coating suspen-<br>
sion.<br>
The method is suitable for coating carriers made of<br>
metal or ceramics. The carriers may be present in the shape<br>
of so-called honeycomb carriers having parallel flow ducts<br>
open on both sides or may comprise an open-pored foam or fi-<br>
ber structure. However, the method can also be used to coat<br>
so-called wall flow filters.<br>
The following explanation of the invention is based on<br>
carriers having parallel flow ducts which are employed in<br>
large numbers as carriers for catalysts in order to purify<br>
the exhaust gases of internal combustion engines.<br>
Coating of the carriers is carried out in a so-called<br>
coating station. According to the prior art, a wide variety<br>
of examples are known. The description is based on an exem-<br>
plary coating station, such as that described in the publica-<br>
tions DE 40 40 150 A1, EP 0941763 A1, EP 1136462 A1 and EP<br>
1273344 A1, for example.<br>
For coating, the carriers are placed on the coating sta-<br>
tion and filled with the coating suspension from below by<br>
means of a pump or from a pressurized reservoir. After that,<br>
surplus coating suspension is either pumped out of the car-<br>
rier or sucked out by applying a vacuum. Flow ducts which may<br>
have become blocked by coating suspension may then be blown<br>
free using compressed air, for example.<br>
The resulting coating of the carrier will be referred to<br>
as raw coating below. The coating quantity of the raw coating<br>
depends on the solids concentration of the coating suspen-<br>
sion, its viscosity and the coating conditions, especially<br>
the conditions when removing the surplus coating suspension<br>
from the flow ducts of the carriers. Persons skilled in the<br>
art are familiar with these relationships and can define the<br>
mean value of the actual coating quantity taking the varia-<br>
tion of this coating process into account so that no carrier<br>
will fall short of the target quantity.<br>
The variation of this conventional coating process de-<br>
pends on the type of coating suspension and other parameters<br>
of the coating process. Usually, the variation is ±5 % to<br>
±10 %. Favorably, it may be reduced down to ±2 %.<br>
In order to decrease the variation of this conventional<br>
coating process, the invention provides for a re-suction op-<br>
eration of the still wet coating suspension from one end of<br>
the carrier so as to match the actual coating quantity with<br>
the desired target quantity. Here, intensity and/or duration<br>
of re-suction are adjusted in accordance with the determined<br>
differential quantity or surplus. Instead of re-suction also<br>
blowing with compressed air can be used to adjust the remain-<br>
ing coating quantity on the carrier.<br>
Adjustment of intensity and/or duration of re-suction<br>
may, for example, be" done by" selecting the corresponding val-<br>
ues from tables of values for the measured actual quantity<br>
which were established in preliminary tests. Alternatively,<br>
intensity and/or duration of re-suction may be controlled in<br>
accordance with the values for the actual quantity determined<br>
on the bodies coated immediately before, intensity and/or du-<br>
ration of re-suction and the thus achieved reduction in the<br>
difference between actual and target quantities, that is, de-<br>
pending on incoming weight or deviation from the required<br>
target quantity, re-suction is adjusted in a predictive man-<br>
ner such that the actual quantity approximates the target<br>
weight or target coating quantity in the carrier as far as<br>
possible.<br>
Following re-suction, the coating quantity is preferably<br>
determined again by weighing, and re-suction is repeated un-<br>
til the actual coating quantity is within specifications.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, a conventional coating<br>
method is used to apply a raw coating onto the carrier. This<br>
is followed by re-suction during which any surplus coating<br>
suspension (based on a target value or the target quantity)<br>
is sucked off.<br>
Depending on the variation in the raw coating, the tar-<br>
get value for the coating concentration (mean value of the<br>
actual coating quantities) is increased to such an extent<br>
that all carriers, including those having a minimal loading,<br>
will still be within specifications. If, for example, the<br>
variation in the raw coating is ±5 %, all carriers will be<br>
coated using a mean value of the actual coating quantities of<br>
105 %. This ensures that all parts are coated at 105 ± 5 % so<br>
that all carriers comprise at least the target coating quan-<br>
tity. Hence, the carriers are deliberately overloaded during<br>
raw coating. In this exemplary case, the mean value of the<br>
actual coating quantities is around 105 % of the required<br>
target loading.<br>
Then, the re-suction operation follows. During resuc-<br>
tion, the deliberate overload of coating suspension on the<br>
carriers is sucked off to the target quantity or close to it.<br>
Any surplus between actual quantity and target quantity<br>
resulting from raw coating is preferably determined by weigh-<br>
ing. It is particularly preferred to determine the actual<br>
quantity on coating suspension by weighing the or each car-<br>
rier before and after coating and comparing the results.<br>
Preferably, the differential quantity which was actually re-<br>
moved is also determined by weighing. If the weight of the<br>
carriers designed for coating is sufficiently constant,<br>
weighing before coating may be omitted.<br>
If the actual quantity is very close above the target<br>
quantity, there will be a risk that re-suction removes so<br>
much that the target quantity is not obtained. For that rea-<br>
son, it is advantageous to perform re-suction only if the<br>
difference between actual quantity and target quantity ex-<br>
ceeds a previously specified threshold value.<br>
The difference between incoming weight of the raw coat-<br>
ing and target coating quantity is a criterion for adjusting<br>
the intensity of re-suction. The intensity of re-suction may<br>
be adjusted directly through the applied vacuum, or indi-<br>
rectly through an "air damper" or a throttle valve, an air<br>
infiltration valve or a calibrated leak in the exhaust line.<br>
As another control criterion, the duration of re-suction may<br>
be altered. Naturally, both parameters may be changed in a<br>
suitable combination in order to adjust the intensity of re-<br>
suction.<br>
Preferably, however, a constant time period for re-suc-<br>
tion within the range between 0.1 and 5 seconds, in particu-<br>
lar between 0.5 and 2 seconds, is used and the intensity of<br>
re-suction is adjusted by changing the vacuum using a throt-<br>
tle valve, an air infiltration valve or a calibrated leak. In<br>
the simplest case, the intensity of re-suction is adjusted by<br>
a controller from previously determined characteristics in-<br>
cluding a list of the necessary adjustment parameters for the<br>
throttle valve etc. depending on the overload, i.e., the dif-<br>
ference between incoming weight of the raw coating and target<br>
coating quantity.<br>
As a rule, these characteristics depend on the composi-<br>
tion of the coating suspension used and, accordingly, must be<br>
determined separately for each coating type (for example<br>
three-way catalyst for gasoline engines, diesel oxidation<br>
catalyst or nitrogen-oxide storage catalyst). Therefore, it<br>
may, for example, be useful to provide several air infiltra-<br>
tion valves which are adapted in an optimum manner to the<br>
control range for various types of coating suspension and/or<br>
varying degrees of overload.<br>
Particularly advantageous is the construction of a<br>
closed-loop control circuit comprising the carriers to be<br>
coated as a controlled system, the measured load as an actual<br>
value and the desired load as a target value. Using the de-<br>
viation between actual values and target values, a controller<br>
determines manipulated variables for adjusting the throttle<br>
valve (or air infiltration valve etc.) serving as final con-<br>
trol element. An increasing campaign duration results in a<br>
control function which is refined and improved in a self-<br>
learning fashion. Consequently, the adjustment of re-suction<br>
can. be carried out for each successive carrier, if process<br>
parameters are otherwise constant. Depending on excess coat-<br>
ing, the performance of re-suction is individually adjusted<br>
in advance for the specific part. The closed-loop control<br>
system independently evaluates the success of this action in<br>
order to adjust and improve the control parameters.<br>
Thus, the coating of all carriers will be constrained<br>
within a specified tolerance window (e.g. ± 1 %) above the<br>
target quantity, which would be impossible using a single<br>
suction operation.<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments, removal of the<br>
surplus or the differential quantity is carried out by itera-<br>
tively removing a certain, relatively small quantity, weigh-<br>
ing and, if necessary, repeating these steps. Thus, steps b)<br>
and c) of the method are performed at least twice until the<br>
actual quantity is within a previously specified tolerance<br>
interval above the target quantity. The specified threshold<br>
value may be reduced after each run in order to increase the<br>
precision for a renewed run.<br>
During repetition of the above-mentioned steps, the<br>
relatively small quantities are preferably sucked from mutu-<br>
ally opposite ends of the carrier. This is advantageous in<br>
that the uniformity of the coating is improved over the<br>
length of the ducts in the carrier. In order to suck the<br>
relatively small quantities from mutually opposite ends of<br>
the carrier, the carrier is turned 180 degrees each during<br>
re-suction, thereby applying its opposite ends to a suction<br>
station.<br>
However, iterative re-suction poses the risk that the<br>
coating suspension solidifies with increasing iteration<br>
stages and that the coating is only increasingly dried by re-<br>
suction. This behavior may be compensated for by a corre-<br>
sponding control or closed-loop control program. It is, how-<br>
ever, preferred to limit the number of re-suction operations<br>
to a maximum of 2 to 3.<br>
After completion of re-suction, the coated carriers are<br>
dried at an elevated temperature between 80 and 200 °C for a<br>
time period of 5 minutes to 2 hours, and then are usually<br>
calcined at temperatures between 300 and 600 °C for a time<br>
period of 10 minutes to 5 hours. Calcination causes the coat-<br>
ing to be strongly fixed to the carrier and converts any pre-<br>
cursor compounds in the coating suspension into their final<br>
form.<br>
The method presented provides excellent accuracy of,<br>
i.e. low variation in, the coating concentration when carri-<br>
ers are coated with catalytically active coatings. This in-<br>
creased accuracy is obtained by the re-suction operation ac-<br>
cording to the invention. Initially, this was surprising as<br>
there was a concern that re-suction would only remove the<br>
liquid phase of the coating suspension, but not a correspond-<br>
ing solids content, too. However, examinations carried out by<br>
the inventors proved that this was not true. The ratio of dry<br>
uptake to wet uptake changes only slightly as a result of re-<br>
suction.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to shift the mean value of the<br>
actual coating quantities achieved with the method so as to<br>
be closer to the technically required target coating quan-<br>
tity. As a result, considerable savings of noble metal and<br>
valuable raw materials for the coating may be obtained. By<br>
contrast, in the conventional coating methods,the mean value<br>
of the actual coating quantities must be selected clearly<br>
higher than the technically required target coating quantity<br>
in order to safely prevent the coating quantity in some car-<br>
riers from falling below the target value.<br>
Use of this method for the fabrication of multiple lay-<br>
ers on the carriers is of particular advantage. Here, the<br>
variations in the individual coatings add up, so that with<br>
the conventional methods, considerable variations in the fi-<br>
nal multilayer coating must be taken into account By apply<br>
ing the method according to the invention to this coating<br>
problem, multilayer coatings having clearly reduced varia-<br>
tions in the coating concentration may be fabricated.<br>
In the following, preferred exemplary embodiments of the<br>
apparatus and the method will be explained in detail with<br>
reference to Figures 1 and 2, wherein:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic representation showing a preferred coating<br>
system for performing the method; and<br>
Figure 2 is a diagram showing the coating quantities for a series of<br>
carriers when coated conventionally and when coated with the<br>
method according to the invention.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows the possible construction of a coating system<br>
comprises a coating station 20 for producing the raw coating. For this<br>
purpose, the carrier 1 to be coated is placed on the retaining<br>
elements provided for this purpose, cf. Figure 1. By inflating an<br>
inflatable rubber gasket 21, the carrier 1 is fixed and sealed to the<br>
station. Further, a second sealing gasket 22 may be provided which<br>
is placed on the upper end of the carrier 1 in order to tightly fix an<br>
overflow 23. A level sensor 25 is preferably arranged above, which<br>
detects a sufficient filling level of the carrier 1 and sends a<br>
corresponding signal to the apparatus controller or closed-loop<br>
controller of the coating system.<br>
In order to produce the raw coating, the coating suspension is<br>
pumped via the feed line 24 into the carrier from below until the level<br>
sensor indicates that a specified filling level has been reached.<br>
Afterwards, a suction or throttle valve 26 is opened to remove<br>
surplus coating suspension from the ducts of the carrier 1 by suction<br>
(pre-suctionO. To do so, a pipe is connected to a vacuum tank (not<br>
shown) and a demister. The vacuum tank is connected to a blower<br>
which maintains a vacuum, preferably between 50 and 500 and a<br>
particularly preferably of 300 millibars below ambient pressure.<br>
Intensity and duration of pre-suction may be adjusted using the<br>
throttle valve 26. They determine the raw coating quantity left on the<br>
carrier. In addition, this operation serves to open ducts which may<br>
have become blocked by coating suspension.<br>
Figure 1 also shows a weighing station 30 at which the coated carrier<br>
1 is weighed on a balance 31. The quantity of coating suspension in<br>
the carrier 1 may be determined in this manner. In addition, a<br>
weighing station 10 having a balance<br>
11 may be provided upstream of the coating station 20 so as<br>
to determine the weight of the carrier 1 prior to coating.<br>
If it is found in the weighing station 30 that the load-<br>
ing of the carrier 1 with coating suspension is excessively<br>
high, the carrier is conveyed onto a re-suction station 40<br>
which removes the excessively applied coating suspension.<br>
Similar to the coating station 20, the re-suction station 40<br>
includes a sealing gasket 41 tightly fixing the carrier 1 to<br>
the re-suction station 40. A suction valve 46 is used to con-<br>
trol the quantity of coating suspension sucked off. If, how-<br>
ever, it is found in the weighing station that the applied<br>
coating quantity is already below the threshold value, then<br>
the carrier is transferred out of the coating system without<br>
any re-suction and supplied to a drying and calcining station<br>
(not shown).<br>
Following re-suction, it is particularly preferred to<br>
weigh the carrier 1 again in the weighing station 30 or an-<br>
other weighing station 50 using a balance 51 as shown in Fig-<br>
ure 1. If, during this further check of the quantity of coat-<br>
ing suspension in the carrier 1, it is found that there is<br>
still too much coating suspension in the carrier 1, the car-<br>
rier may again be conveyed into the re-suction station 40.<br>
Otherwise, the carrier is transferred out of the coating sta-<br>
tion and supplied to the drying and calcining station.<br>
As indicated before, the weighing stations 30 and 50 may<br>
be combined, depending on the desired flexibility and/or<br>
speed of the overall system. Moreover, the weighing station<br>
30 and/or 50 may be combined with the re-suction station 40<br>
or the coating station 20.<br>
Example<br>
The coating system as shown in Figure 1 was used to per-<br>
form a coating campaign to coat 500 carriers.<br>
The diagram of Figure 2 shows the coating results for 37<br>
carriers. The coating number is indicated on the abscissa.<br>
The ordinate indicates the determined percentage coating<br>
quantity based on the desired target quantity (100 %).<br>
Curve a) represents the coating quantities of the raw<br>
coating as determined at the weighing station 30. The coating<br>
suspension used had a raw coating variation of ± 3 %. Accord-<br>
ingly, the mean value of the raw coating was set to 103 % of<br>
the target coating quantity.<br>
Curve b) shows the results after a single re-suction op-<br>
eration. The variation in the coating quantity could be re-<br>
duced to ± 0.5 % by re-suction. The mean value of the coating<br>
quantities produced by re-suction was about 101 % of the tar-<br>
get quantity.<br>
The coating suspension removed from the carriers by re-<br>
suction is collected and re-supplied to the coating process<br>
following a corresponding conditioning procedure. As a re-<br>
sult, in this example the proposed method can save about 2 %<br>
of noble metal cost and corresponding cost for the other<br>
coating materials.<br>
