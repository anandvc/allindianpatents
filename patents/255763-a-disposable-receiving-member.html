THE PATENT ACT 1970<br>
(39 of 1970)<br>
&amp;<br>
The Patents Rules, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See section 10 and rule 13)<br>
        3.  A DISPOSABLE FILTER MEANS FOR SMOKING.<br>
2.<br>
(A)	Piparette Pty Ltd.<br>
(B)	Australia<br>
(C)	8 Ocean Court, Shelly Beach, Sunshine Coast, 4551,Queensland, Australia.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
The present invention relates to smoking and smoking devices. The present invention has particular but not exclusive application to disposable accessories and parts for pipe and cigarette holders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
When smoking tobacco from either a pipe, cigarette holder or cigarette, the smoke includes nicotine, moisture, tar and other burnt tobacco byproducts. The pipe and holder usually includes a filter in the stem to limit the amount of burnt byproducts being inhaled by the smoker. With the pipe and holder, the elongate stem also assists in limiting the amount of burnt byproducts reaching the smoker, because the smoke loses heat and the suspended waste changes from a gaseous phase to a solid or liquid phase and consequently is trapped by the filter.<br>
With time, the waste byproducts clog the pipe preventing smoke from passing through the internal passage. Consequently, the pipe and cigarette holder require regular cleaning. The cleaning of pipes and cigarette holders is a laborious task repeated on a regular basis. Furthermore, the cleaning of pipes and cigarette holders usually leaves some waste thereby contaminating subsequent smoke passing through the stem and lessening the enjoyment derived from smoking.<br>
In addition, the area immediately in communication with the exit portal of the burning chamber is often burnt as a consequence of the high temperature of the smoke reducing the ability of the area to filter the smoke. Eventually the pipe or holder must be replaced because of the damaged area adjacent the burning chamber.<br>
2<br><br>
These problems are an ongoing source of frustration to smokers as effective filtering of the smoke is reduced. Where filtering is reduced over a period of time, the smoker's health can be adversely affected. As well, the regular ongoing requirement to clean the pipes and holders before a person can enjoy having a smoke often turns the person away from using such smoking devices.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION <br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an alternative smoking filter means that overcomes at least in part one or more of the abovementioned problems.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS <br>
With reference to figure 1, there is shown an unassembled' smoking device including a receiving member in the form of a shank trap 11, a filter housing 12 with a mouth piece 13, stem 14 and bowl 15. The shank trap 11 is attachable to the filter housing 12 at the opposing end to the mouth piece 13. The filter housing 12 has an acetate paper filter 16 (shown in phantom) locatable within the housing 12. The filter housing 12 with the shank trap 11, when assembled forms a filter assembly locatable within stem 14. The bowl 15 is locatable on the stem 14. When assembled, the<br>
...M|<br>
burning chamber of the bowl 15 is in communication with the shank trap 11 and the filter housing 12. Smoke from the burning chamber passes into the shank trap 11 as<br>
11<br><br>
the smoker draws on the mouthpiece 13, the smoke then passes through the paper acetate filter 16 within the filter housing 12 and is inhaled by the smoker. The shank trap 11 is shaped to collect moisture, tar and other end products while allowing smoke to pass through pores 18 in the distal end 19 of the shank trap 11. The acetate paper filter 16 serves to further filter particulates from the smoke before it is inhaled by the smoker. As the smoke passes from the burning chamber, it cools and some waste changes to particulate or liquid form. Some of the particulate and liquid waste is trapped within the shank trap 11. The shank trap 11 and the acetate paper filter 16 are disposable and can be easily replaced with a new shank trap and filter respectively. The shank trap 11 is preferably made of metal such as brass or aluminium with an inner ceramic lining.<br>
With reference to figures 2 and 3, there is shown a second embodiment of a smoking device 20. The smoking device 20 has a bowl 21, stem 22, mouth piece 23 and shank trap 24. The stem 22 includes two paper filters 25 (shown in phantom). The device 20 shown in figures 2 and 3 is very similar to the device shown in figure 1 except with the device 20 the filter housing is part of the stem 22.<br>
In figure 4 there is shown a smoking device 40 wherein the bowl 41 can be removed and replaced by engaging and sliding into position on the stem 42. The bowl 41 has engagement members 43 with inclined sides for sliding along a channel 44 within the stem 42.<br>
In figure 5, there is shown an exploded view of a further embodiment of a smoking device 50 where the bowl 51 is removable by means of a screw thread 52. The bowl 51 can be fixed to the stem 53 within a complementary thread in the stem 53. The smoking device 50 has a filter means including a shank trap 54 and paper filter 55.<br>
12<br><br>
In figure 6 there is shown a preferred embodiment of the shank trap 60. The shank trap 60 is composed of ceramic material able to absorb moisture and other smoke end products. The shank trap 60 has a bowl end 61 adapted to be fitted to a bowl (not shown). The bowl end 61 has an opening 62 which is in communication with the bowl and burning chamber exit portal (not shown) when fitted. To seal the fitting of the shank trap 60 to the bowl, a rubber gasket 63 (Figure 7) is fitted around the periphery of the opening 62 within the surrounding recessed portion 64.<br>
The opening 62 is an entry into internal passage 65. Passage 65 has an outlet 66 at the opposing end to opening 62. The outlet 66 has a wide mouth portion 67 to accommodate positioning of a paper filter within the pipe or holder.<br>
The shank trap 60 has an outer metal casing 68 for providing heat resistance and a molded ceramic core 69 for withstanding high temperatures and absorbing moisture and other liquid and gaseous end products.<br>
...Ml<br>
The stem 80 shown in figures 8 and 9 have a filter housing 81 and mouthpiece 82. The embodiment shown in figure 8 shows the mouthpiece 82 having a recessed end 84 that fits within housing end 83. Alternately, the mouthpiece 82 can friction fit over one end 85 of the housing 81 (shown in figure 9).<br>
Within filter housing 81 there is positioned an acetate paper filter 82 which has a substantially cylindrical form with a fluted outer surface 88 to provide an increased surface area for the filtering of smoke.<br>
The shank trap 60 can fit substantially within the end 89 of the filter housing 81 that is opposed to the mouthpiece 82. The shank trap 60 is then fitted to the bowl (not shown). The filter housing 81 is then friction-fitted to the bowl, thereby encasing the shank trap 60 in an operational position.<br>
13<br><br>
After use or when the pipe requires cleaning, the shank trap 60 and filter 82 is replaced and the used parts disposed. In this way efficient filtering is maintained and the frustration of cleaning is avoided by using replacement parts.<br>
In figure 11, a further embodiment of the smoking device is shown with bowl 110, shank trap 111, filter housing 112 with mouth piece 113, stem 114 and stem cover 115.<br>
In a further embodiment shown in Figure 12, a shank trap 90 can be fitted (and retrofitted) into a cigarette holder 91. The shank trap 90 has a U-shaped bowl 92 for holding the cigarette in position so that smoke can be drawn through the cigarette and the shank trap 90 as the smoker inhales. While at least the initial burning does not occur in the bowl 92, the bowl 92 is required to hold the cigarette and enable smoke to be drawn through to the mouthpiece. When fitted to the cigarette holder, the shank trap 90 has a filter portion 93 in the form of a ceramic net 94 through which smoke passes and out through a covering cap 95 which is locatable over the net 94. The covering cap 95 has a centrally located opening 97. Smoke passes over the ceramic surfaces of the net 94 which filters the moisture and gaseous end products and then collects in chamber 96 formed by the cap 95 and net 94. The collected smoke has cooled by the time it reaches the chamber 96 and some smoke end products change phase to liquid and particulate matter and are trapped in the chamber 96. Only smoke passes out of opening 97 in the cap 95. Smoke then passes through the mouth piece 98 of the cigarette holder 91.<br>
The fitting of the shank trap to a cigarette holder provides a means of filtering the smoke from a cigarette without using a conventional cigarette butt. The shank trap is furthermore disposable and can be replaced with a new shank trap when cleaning is required.<br>
14<br><br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
The present embodiment of the shank trap provides the advantage that it is substantially heat resistant, can absorb moisture and other smoke end products and in some embodiments trap liquid waste and particulate end products and is disposable avoiding the need to clean pipes and holders. In this way efficient filtering of smoke can be maintained without ongoing cleaning problems. Furthermore efficient use of tobacco can be achieved. With the shank trap for the cigarette holder, the entire cigarette can be smoked thus saving on costs and wasting less tobacco. Furthermore there is no need for cigarette butts.<br>
