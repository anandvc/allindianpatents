[0001]<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a light unit for a vehicle such as a motorcycle. [0002] [Related Art]<br>
With a vehicle such as a motorcycle, in order to improve ease of maintenance a light unit is sometimes made into a unitary structure having a plurality of lights.<br>
For example, in patent document 1, a tail light unit provided with a tail light and a license light is attached to the vehicle body using connecting means such as screws. [0003] [Patent document l]<br>
Japanese Patent No. 2980279 [0004] [Problems to be solved by the Invention]<br>
However, with the above described unit of the related art, although<br>
the tail light unit can be detached by removing the connection means, such as screws, at the time of detachment it is necessary to hold and support the outer surface of the end of the tail light unit.<br>
In particular, in the case of a structure where the light unit is pulled out from the vehicle body, it is necessary to apply force in the direction of pulling out the light unit, but if the area where the light unit is gripped is rounded it is difficult to apply this force due to slipping, and removal of the light unit consumes man-hours.<br>
This invention therefore provides a light unit that improves ease of maintenance by providing an indent for holding a light cover. [0005] [Means of Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the above described objective, an invention relating to claim 1 is light unit (for example, the tail light unit 30 in the embodiments described later), comprising a bulb (for example, a tail light bulb 34, rear winker bulb 35 or license light bulb 36 in the embodiments), being a light emitting body, a base (for example a base 40 in the embodiments) for supporting the bulb, and a light cover (or example light cover 80, 90 in the embodiments) for covering the bulb, wherein a gripping indent (for example, the gripping indent 93 in the embodiments) is provided in the light cover.<br>
^<br>
With this type of structure, it is possible to grip the light unit ;.^      using the gripping indent and to apply force to the light unit. [0006]<br>
The invention of claim 2 is the invention of claim 1 with the gripping indent opening downwards and is provided at an end part of the light cover (or example, the light cover 90) in the embodiments. With this type of structure it is possible to not impair the external appearance of the gripping indent, and it is possible to easily grip the light unit [0007]<br>
The invention of claim 3 is the invention of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein at least a surround of the gripping indent in the light cover has a deep color. With this type of structure, it is possible to prevent the surround of the gripping indent appearing transparent. [0008]<br>
The invention of claim 4 is the invention of any one of claim 1 to<br>
claim 3, wherein a locking part (for example, the locking projection 56 in the embodiments), enabling attachment and removal to the base by insertion into and removal from a vehicle body (for example the bracket 28 in the embodiments),- is-provided in the base. With this type of structure, it is possible to push in and pull out the light unit while gripping the light unit using the gripping indent, and to insert and remove the locking section of the base into and from the vehicle body.

In the tail light unit 30 configured in this way, when it becomes necessary to remove the tail light unit 30 from the vehicle body, first of all the fixing screws that are fitted into the penetrating holes of the base 40 are removed, and a hand is inserted into the gripping indent 93 of the light cover 90 so as to hold the outer wall section 91 of the light cover 90 and then the latching projection 56 of the base 40 can be simply removed from the grommet of the vehicle body side bracket 28 by pulling towards the rear. Therefore, it is possible to simply remove the tail light unit 30 from the vehicle body with one hand, and it is possible to subsequently carry the removed tail light unit 30 in that manner without any other action being necessary. Also, when attaching the tail light unit 30 to the vehicle body, it is possible to similarly grip the outer wall section 91 and attach, and simply carry out attachment by pushing the latching projection 56 into the grommet of the bracket 28, and after that it is possible to reliably fix the tail light unit 30 to the vehicle body<br>
by inserting the fixing screws into the though holes 58a and screwing them into the screw holes of the bracket 28. As a result, ease of maintenance of the tail light unit 30 is improved significantly. [0031]<br>
Also, with this embodiment, since the gripping indent 93 opens to the bottom, the gripping indent 93 can not be seen from the outside, and also, since the light cover 90 is tinted black it is possible to prevent the gripping indent 93 appearing transparent. It is therefore, possible to prevent the gripping indent 93 being conspicuous which improves the design. [0032]<br>
With this embodiment, the gripping indent 93 is provided so as to open to the bottom, but it is also possible to provide the gripping indent 93 so as to open to an upper side of the outer wall section 91 of the light cover 90, as shown in Fig. 11, for example. The position where the gripping indent is provided can also be anywhere at the lateral end of the light cover 90. With the previously described embodiment, the latch member (latch protrusion 56) for enabling attachment and removal of the light unit to and from the vehicle body is constructed as a male member, but it is also possible for the latch member of the light unit to be a female member, with a male member at the vehicle body side being fitted into this female member. Also, the above embodiment has been described by way of an example adopted in a tail light unit, but the present invention can also be adopted in a headlight unit. The present invention is also not limited to a motorcycle and can also be adopted in a three or four wheeled vehicle. [0033] [Effects of the invention]<br>
As has been described above, according to the invention of claim 1, since it is possible to apply force by gripping a light unit using a gripping indent, it is easy to handle the light unit, and it is easy to attach or remove the light unit, which significantly improves ease of maintenance. According to the invention of claim 2, it is possible to prevent the gripping indent impairing the external appearance, and it is possible to easily grip the light unit. [0034]<br>
According to the invention of claim 3, since it is possible to<br>
prevent the gripping indent appearing transparent, it is possible to prevent the external appearance being impaired. According to the invention of claim 4, the light unit is pushed in or pulled out while gripping the light unit using the gripping indent, and the latching section of the base is fitted into or removed from the vehicle body, which means tat it is easy to attach and remove-the light unit to and from the vehicle body.
