THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE INVENTION.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to pin-tumbler cylinder locks.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Pin cylinder locks are operated by flat key which has either notches on the side or drilled dimples on the flat faces.<br>
It is possible to make duplicate keys by an expert key maker. Such duplicate key can open the lock.<br>
This invention envisages a flat key having at least one floating ball on the key blade. The disadvantage of using duplicate keys is overcome by the key having floating ball as only correct key having floating ball will open the lock. Any other duplicate key without floating ball will not open the lock.<br>
Hence the invention of floating ball on key helps in preventing opening of lock, even after using conventional duplicate key.<br>
Also the location of the floating ball is kept secret as it is not seen from outside the lock. The position of the floating ball is randomly chosen so as to further increase the number of key combinations and increase security. Making of duplicate key with floating ball is virtually impossible for ordinary key maker.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION:<br>
An object of this invention is to overcome the disadvantage of opening of<br>
2<br><br>
pin cylinder lock by using conventionally made duplicate key.<br>
According to this invention, this problem is solved by a key of the type specified their in which is characterized in that a floating ball is fitted on the blade of the key. Holes of varying diameter are drilled on the lock cylinder and lock housing. Locking pins, pressure pins, springs and sealing pins are fitted.<br>
When the key, with floating balls, is inserted in the lock, the ball presses the locking pins so as to make them in alignment with outer diameter of cylinder. The cylinder is now free to rotate and the lock is opened.<br>
When the key, without floating balls, is inserted in the lock the locking pins are displaced further and they protrude beyond the outer diameter of the cylinder. This prevents the cylinder from rotating and the lock remains in locked position.<br>
Hence even if a duplicate key is made by an expert key maker, but without fitting the floating ball, the lock will not be opened using such duplicate key.<br>
However, the key with floating ball, will definitely open the lock. Floating ball on key guarantees total security to the lock.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION: -<br>
FIG (l)<br>
Shows the steel Ball 4 which is very important part of this invention. The steel ball is made of non-magnetic material and is very precision in diameter (2.5 mm diam). It is embedded in the key by mechanical clinching operation.<br>
FIG (2)<br>
Shows the key with 2 steel balls embedded in it. The balls are loosely held in the key and they float (pushed upwards and downwards) when pressed with 2 fingers. Only one ball operates at a time, when key is inserted in the lock. This other ball operates when key is rotated by 180Â° and then inserted in the lock. This two balls arrangement is incorporated in the key with reversible use. For embedding the ball inside the key, it is placed inside the key hole and peripheral area is clinched (pressed in) with suitable tool.<br>
FIG (2)<br>
Shows flat key with 2 holes for balls. Enlarged section A-A gives details of the holes and countersunk holes. 2 holes are positioned in apposite direction for reversible use key. The positions of 2 holes have to exactly match with the<br>
5<br><br>
positions of corresponding holes in lock housing and lock cylinder.<br>
FIG (3)<br>
Shows Lock and Key Assembly.<br>
The key has 2 steel balls embedded in it as shown in Fig 3 Locking Pins 6 and 9 are inserted one after another in the holes of lock cylinder Fig 5. Then pressure pins 3 and 7 are inserted in the holes of the lock housing 1. Springs No 11 and 12 are inserted one after another on either side of the lock housing . Finally Sealing Pin No.8 and 10 are pressed in one after another on either side of Lock Housing. Finally the Notch Strip No. 13 Spacer Bush No. 14 and the Circlip No. 15 are fitted on the Lock Cylinder No.5 When the key is removed from the lock the 2 compression springs press the locking pins and pressure pins inwards. Thereby these pins protrude across the outer surface of the lock cylinder preventing it from rotating in this position. The lock remains locked.<br>
FIG (4) and (5)<br>
When key, with steel balls, is inserted in the lock, the floating ball has freedom to slide sideward as the heavier &amp; stronger Compression Spring No. II overcomes the pressure of the weaker Compression Spring No. 12 and this heavier Spring No. 13 presses the steel ball inwards, which in turn presses the locking Pin No.6 outwards. In this position the outer rounded ends of these 2 locking pins remain in alignment with the outer diameter of Lock cylinder thereby allowing it to rotate when key is rotated. This results in bringing the lock in unlocked position.<br>
FIG (6)<br>
When the key, without floating steel ball, is inserted in the lock, both the side<br>
locking pins No.6 &amp; 9 are pressed out wards by the surface of the key blade.<br>
6<br><br>
These locking pins remain across the outside diameter of the lock cylinder Fig No.5, thereby causing as obstruction to key rotation. This prevents free rotation of key resulting in the lock remaining in locked condition. Hence, when duplicate key is made by an expert key maker but without providing the floating ball in relevant correct position, such duplicate key will not open the lock.<br>
FIG (7)<br>
Shows the Lock Housing which holds the lock cylinder and other lock parts in proper position. SecAA shows two holes with counter bore on either side of the lock housing. These two holes are of unequal diameter. These two holes come in exact alignment of the 2 holes in lock cylinder and the floating steel ball. Locking Pins No 6 &amp; 9, Pressure Pins No.3 and 7 and Springs No. 11 and 12 are inserted though these two holes. Finally these 2 holes are closed by pressing in the 2 Sealing Pins N0.8&amp;IO.<br>
FIG (8)<br>
Shows the Lock Cylinder which is fitted inside the Lock Housing No.7. This is the main operating and rotating part of the lock assembly. It has a key slot through which the key is inserted and withdrawn. Two holes having unequal diameter, with counter bore at the outer surface are provided in which Locking Pins N0.6 &amp; 9 are inserted. The counter bore holes prevents the locking pins from slipping inside the Cylinder as the bigger diameter heads of the locking pins rest on the bottom surface of these counter bore holes.<br>
After completing the assembly of locking pins, pressure pins, springs and sealing pins the cylinder is fitted with notch strip, Spacer Bush and finally the Circlip. The Circlip holds the cylinder and prevents it from coming out of the lock housing when the key is pulled out.<br>
7<br><br>
An improved key of cylinder lock having pin -tumbler type locking mechanism. This key has floating ball embedded in the key blade and the key hole is clinched on one side so that the ball remains floating inside, but is restrained from coming out of the key. The ball is able to roll and slide in either direction at right angle to the key blade.<br>
On the key, which is reversible in use, two balls are fitted on the key. After the key is inserted in the lock one ball always remains in line with the central axis of the lock and also the central axis of the horizontal locking pins of lock housing and lock cylinder. The other ball of the key remains idle and inoperative. It come in operation when the key is inserted in reverse direction (180Â°)<br>
The position of the ball on key is variable and randomly selected. Because of this the exact location of ball and locking pins remain undetected when seen from outside the lock. This makes the lock further fool-proof and almost impossible to open with ordinary duplicate key. It also increases the number of key combinations.<br>
Holes of varying diameters are drilled on the lock housing and lock cylinder in line with the axis of the ball. Locking pins, pressure pins, springs and sealing pins are inserted in the lock housing and lock cylinder.<br>
When the key with the floating ball, is inserted in the lock, the ball presses the locking pins so as to make them in alignment with the outer diameter of lock cylinder. The cylinder with key is now free to rotate and the lock is now opened.<br>
When the flat key, without the floating ball is inserted in the lock, the locking pins are displaced further and they protrude beyond the outer diameter of the cylinder.<br>
8<br><br>
This prevents the cylinder &amp; key from rotating and the lock remains in unlocked position.<br>
Even if duplicate key is made by any expert key maker, but without fitting the floating ball in its exact position, it will not be possible to open the lock while using such duplicate key.<br>
The provision of floating ball on key and provision of locking pins on the lock housing and lock cylinder are the main features of this invention as it ensures total security to the user of the cylinder lock having such unique key fitted with the floating ball mechanism.<br>
While considerable emphasis has been placed herein on the specific structure of the preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated that many alterations can be made and that many modifications can be made in the preferred embodiment without departing from the principles of the invention. These and other changes in the preferred embodiment as well as other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the disclosure herein, whereby it is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing descriptive matter is to be interpreted merely as illustrative of the invention and not as a limitation.<br>
