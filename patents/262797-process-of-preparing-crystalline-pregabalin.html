TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"PROCESS OF PREPARING CRYSTALLINE PREGABALIN AND ITS HIGHLY PURE INTERMEDIATE THEREOF"<br>
We, CADILA HEALTHCARE LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Road, Ahmedabad-380015, Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification describes the invention:<br><br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to crystalline forms of Pregabalin and their process of preparation. The invention also relates to a process for preparing pure Pregabalin via 2-carbethoxy-5-methylhex-2-enoic acid ethyl ester, an important intermediate for synthesis of crystalline Pregabalin, having less than about, 1-2% of 2-carbethoxy-5-methylhex-3-enoic<br>
acid ethyl ester. The present invention also relates to prepare enantiomerically pure (S)-(+)-3-<br>
I   ■	:|<br>
(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid (Pregabalin) of Formula (I) free from (R)-enantiomer,<br>
obtained by optionally resolving the racemate (±)-Pregabalin by a standard method of<br>
resolution. Thus, process for the recovery of standard resolving agent used for resolution of<br>
the (±)-Pregabalin, thereby to provide cost effective and economical process for preparation<br>
of (S)-(+)-Pregabalin is also the field of present invention.	ij<br>
NH2 COOH<br>
Formula (I)<br><br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid, which is also called /Msobutyl-y-aminobutyric acid or isobutyl-GABA, is a potent anticonvulsant. Isobutyl-GABA is related to the endogenous inhibitory neurotransmitter, y-aminobutyric acid or GABA, which is involved<br>
in the regulation of brain neuronal activity.	<br><br>
Jregabalin may be prepared using known methods. In some of these methods, a<br>
racemic mixture of 3-aminomethyl-5-methyl-hexanoic acid is synthesized and subsequently<br>
resolved into its R- and S-enantiomers. Such methods are described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,563,175 to R. B. Silverman et. al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,046,353 to T. M. Grote et al, U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,840,956 to T. M. Grote et. al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,637,767 to T. M. Grote et. al, U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,629,447 to B. K. Huckabee &amp; D. M. Sobieray, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,616,793 to B. K.<br>
Huckabee &amp; D. M. Sobieray. In each of these methods, the racemate is reacted with a chiral<br>
acid (a<br>
resolving agent) to form a pair of diastereoisomeric salts, which are separated by<br>
known techniques, such as fractional crystallization and chromatography. In other methods, Pregabalin is synthesized directly using a chiral auxiliary, (4R,5S)-4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone.   See,  e.g.,  U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  6,359,169,  6,028,214,   5,847,151,   5,710,304,<br>
1<br><br>
5,684,189, 5,608,090, and 5,599,973, all to Silverman et. al. In still other methods, Pregabalin<br>
is prepared via asymmetric hydrogenation of a cyano-substituted olefin to produce a chiral<br>
cyano precursor of (S)-3-aminomethyl-5-methyl hexanoic acid, which is subsequently<br>
reduced to yield Pregabalin. See U.S. Patent Application 2003/0212290 A1 to Burk et al.    j<br>
Furthermore, like Gabapentin, Pregabalin is a gamma-amino acid, which under<br>
normal  storage  conditions and  in the  presence of water may undergo  intramolecular<br>
cyclization to form the lactam, 4-isobutyl-pyrrolidin-2-one. See, e.g., WO 99/10186 and WO<br>
99/5957i3, both to A. Aomatsu. Although it is known that the non-active components of the<br>
composition may affect lactam formation, it is difficult to predict which excipients or<br>
adjuvant may lead to undesirable lactam formation,	j<br>
The most frequent approach is to design a compound that crosses the blood brain<br>
j barrier and then inactivates GABA aminotransferase. The effect is to block the degradation of<br>
GABA and thereby increase its concentration. Another approach is to increase GAElA<br>
concentrations in the brain by making GABA lipophilic by conversion to hydrophobic GABA<br>
amides {Kaplan J. P., et al, G.J. Med. Chem. 1980;23:702-704; Carvajal G., et al, Biochem.<br>
Pharmacol 1964;13:1059-1069; Imines: Kaplan J. P., Ibid.; or GABA esters: ShashouaV.<br>
K, et al, J., Med. Chem. 1984;27:659-664; and PCT Patent Application WO85/00520,<br>
published Feb. 14, 1985). So, that GABA can cross the blood brain barrier. Once inside the<br>
brain, these compounds require amidase and esterases to hydrolyze off the carrier group and<br>
release GABA.	.!<br>
I	i<br>
It  has  been  discovered  that  the  anticonvulsant  effect  of isobutyl-GABA ^ is<br>
stereoselective. That is, the S-stereoisomer of isobutyl-GABA shows better anticonvulsant<br><br>
activity<br><br>
than the R-stereoisomer. See, for example, Yuen, et al, in Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal<br><br>
Chemistry Letters, 1994;4(6):823-826. Thus, it would be beneficial to have an efficient process for the synthesis of the S-stereoisomer of isobutyl-GABA.<br>
in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Vol. 18 A (1991) page 182/183<br>
and in Rompp-Chemie Lexikon Vol. 4 (1991) page 2623 the resolution of certain optically<br>
pure enantiomers has been described. These documents, however, do not mention the<br>
resolution of y-amino acids. Furthermore the processes disclosed require the protection of the<br>
amino acids by additional process steps.	&gt;[U.S. Patent No. 5,637,767 discloses the process for preparation of (S)-(+)-Pregabalin via 2-carboyethyl-5-methylhex-2-enoic acid, ethyl ester by reaction of isovaleraldehyde and<br><br>
diethyl<br><br>
malonate in presence of di-n-pfopylamine in hexane and glacial acetic acid. The<br><br>
reaction also generates the unwanted olefin isomer (typically  10-13% by GC) i.e.j-2-<br>
2<br><br>
carboyethyl-5-methylhex-3-enoic acid, ethyl ester. Thus, GC assay shows 74-76% 2-carboyethyl-5-methylhex-2-enoic acid, ethyl ester; 10-13% 2-carboyethyl-5-methylhex-3-enoic acid, ethyl ester; 87-88% total of both isomers. [See Example-1, Column-11, Line-15-<br>
25].	1<br>
.i<br>
The patent also discloses the process for resolution of racemic Pregabalin with S-(+)-mandelic acid, thereby to obtain enantiomerically pure (S)-(+)-Pregabalin. Thus, there is always a need for the process to obtain (S)-(+)-Pregabalin from 2-carboyethyl-5-methylhex-<br><br>
2-enoic<br><br>
acid as one of the intermediate having less olefin isomer and high purity by GC.<br><br>
Also, there is a need for the recyclability of the resoluting agent by its recovery.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,046,353 also discloses the same process for preparation of (S)-(+)-<br>
Pregabalin enantiomerically pure  free from  (R)-(-)-Pregabalin or having LDT (lower<br>
i<br>
detection limit) less than 0.5%. Thus, it is evident that 2-carboethyl-5-methylhex-2-enoic acid, ethyl ester is the important intermediate for preparation of (S)-(+)-Pregabalin. Also the resolution is achieved in the similar manner as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,637,767. Thus, there is always need to provide simple and cost effective process for the preparation of (S)-(+)-Pregabalin via olefin isomer having less than 1-2% of other olefin isomer and the<br><br>
40-55].<br>
reusabiliity of chiral agent for resolution by its recovery. [See Example-1, Column-11, Line-<br>
Organic Process Research &amp; Development, 1997', 1, 27-38 also showed the same process for the preparation of (S)-(+)-Pregabalin from 2-carboethyl-5-methylhex-2-enoic acid, ethyl ester (40) as the important intermediate formed by reaction, between isovaleraldehyde and diethyl molonate in presence of di-n-propylamine in hexane and glacial acetic acid. The process also results in 10-13% by GC assay in another olefin isomer. The<br><br>
process<br><br>
also follows the classical technique for the resolution with S-(+)-mandelic acid.<br><br>
Thus, in a broad aspect, the present invention provides the process for preparing 2-<br>
i carboethyl-5-methylhex-2-enoic acid  having  less than  about  1-2% of 2-carboethyl-5-<br>
methylhex-3-enoic acid and recovery of chiral reagent (S)-(+)-mandelic acid form (S)-(+)-<br>
mandelate salt of Pregabalin, thereby to provide the industrially applicable, simple and cost<br>
effective and economical process for preparing (S)-(+)-Pregabalin enantiomerically pure,<br>
having NMT 0.5% of its (R)-enantiomer.<br>
In general, crystalline forms of drugs are preferred over amorphous forms of drugs, in<br>
part, because of their superior stability. For example, in many situations, an amorphous drug<br>
converts to a crystalline drug form upon storage. Because amorphous and crystalline forms of<br>
a    drug    typically    have    differing    physical/chemical    properties,    potencies    and/or<br>
3<br><br>
bioavailabilities, such interconversion is undesirable for safety reasons in pharmaceutical administration. A key characteristic of any crystalline drug substance is the polymorphic behavior of such a material.<br>
i<br>
Polymorphs are crystals of the same molecule, which have different physical properties because the crystal lattice contains a different arrangement of molecules.<br>
The different physical properties exhibited by polymorphs affect important pharmaceutical parameters such as storage, stability, compressibility, density (important in formulation and product manufacturing) and dissolution rates (important in determining bioavailability). Stability differences: may result from changes in chemical reactivity (e.g., differential hydrolysis or oxidation, such that a dosage form discolors more rapidly when comprised of one polymorph than when comprised of another polymorph), mechanical changes (e. g,, tablets crumble on storage as a kinetically favored crystalline form converts to thermodynamically more stable crystalline form) or both (e. g., tablets of one polymorph are more susceptible to breakdown at high humidity). Solubility differences between polymorphs may, in extreme situations, result in transitions to crystalline forms that lack potency or are toxic. In addition, the physical properties of the crystalline form may be important in pharmaceutical processing. For example, a. particular crystalline form may form solvates more readily or may be more difficult to filter and wash free of impurities than other forms (i.e., particle shape and size distribution might be different between one crystalline form relative to other forms).<br>
WO2005/037784 discloses the crystalline forms of l-{[(a-Isobutanoyloxy ethoxy)carbonyl]aminomethyl}-l-cyclohexane acetic acid, (1), a prodrug of the GABA analog Gabapentin.<br>
WO2002/100347 discloses the method of preparation of prodrug and further discloses the glassy solid material obtained after lyophilization from aqueous acetonitrile. The material obtained by this process is partially or wholly amorphous and certain alkali metal salt forms are hygroscopic.<br>

Thus, the invention relates to crystalline form of Pregabalin having brick shape crystal habit and their process of preparation. The invention also relates to a process for preparing pure Pregabalin via 2-carbethoxy-5-methylhex-2-enoic acid ethyl ester, an important intermediate for synthesis of crystalline Pregabalin, having less than about, 1-2% of 2-carbethoxy-5-methylhex-3-enoic acid ethyl ester.

Also provided by the present invention is a method for obtaining (S)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid from (±)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-rhethylhexanoic acid PG-04, the method comprising combining (+)-3-(amino methyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid and (S)-mandelic acid in water, an alcohol or a mixture of water and an alcohol; heating the reaction mixture and stirring to get clear solution; gradual cooling, filtration and washing with alcohol to get wet cake. Again combining the wet cake, S-mandelic acid in water, an alcohol, or a mixture of water and an alcohol at higher temperature and stirring to get clear solution; and gradual cooling, filtration, washing with alcohol below 5°C and drying at higher temperature.<br>
In one step of the present method for making (±)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic<br>
acid,	isovaleraldehyde	is	condensed	with<br>
diethylmalonate, wherein Ri and R2 are the same or different and are hydrogen C1-C6 alkyl, aryl, benzyl, or C3-C6 cycloalkyl. This type of reaction is known to those skilled in the art as a Knoevenagel Condensation, and the conditions under which a Knoevenagel Condensation can be carried out are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, the condensation can be achieved using a catalytic amount of a base such as di-n-propylamine. Other suitable catalysts are known in the literature. See for example, Tietzea L.F., and Beifuss U. in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, 1991;2:341-394 (Trost B.M., ed.), Pergamon Press. Representative examples of suitable catalysts include pyrrolidine, (3-alanine, ammonium acetate, di-isoproplylamine, and di-propylamine. These basic catalysts can also be used in combination with an acid such as p-toluene sulfonic acid or acetic acid. A preferred catalyst system in the present method is di-n-propylamine and acetic acid.<br>
n general, the reaction is run in a refluxing hydrocarbon solvent including, but not limited to, toluene, hexane,  heptane, methyl tert-butyl  ether or cyclohexane, with the azeotropic removal of water. A preferred  solvent is hexane.  It is noted that olefin regioisomers can also be formed in the reaction, but are converted to the desired product in a. subsequent step in the reaction sequence.<br>
Representative examples of C1-C6 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl and hexyl. Representative examples of C3-C6 cycloalkyl include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. Representative examples of aryl groups. include phenyl and substituted phenyl, naphthyl, pridinyl, and the like. The aryl moiety may be substituted with one or more substituents, which can be the same or different.<br>
11<br><br>
Examples of such groups include C1-C6 alkyl, Ci-Ce alkoxy and halogen. Preferably, Ri and R2 are ethyl. In general, the isovaleraldehyde and<br><br><br>
C02Ri CO2R2<br><br>
are added to the solvent along with the catalyst, and refluxed with azeotropic removal of water. It is also contemplated that additional catalyst may be added when the rate of azeotropic water collection slows. The progress of the condensation reaction may be monitored by methods well known in the art.<br>
In another step of the present method,<br><br><br><br>
is reacted with a cyanide source to form<br>
CN<br><br><br>
R2 O2 C      C02R2<br>
In general,<br><br>
is reacted with a cyanide source in a polar protic solvent such as ethanol, methanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, a mixture of water and alcohols, or polar aprotic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or DMSO/water, and then treated with any of C3-C6 cycloalkyl include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl followed by addition of an acid and then water. Examples of suitable cyanide sources include, but are not limited to, hydrogen cyanide, acetone cyanohydrin or an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal cyanide, such as sodium cyanide, potassium cyanide, or magnesium cyanide.<br>

The<br><br>
CN<br><br>

in this step may be used in the next step without purification, i.e. in crude form, or it may be purified. Examples of suitable acids are acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, benzoic acid, mandelic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and the like.<br><br>
The<br><br><br>
-CN RiOzC   "C02R2<br><br>
can be decarboxylated to form<br><br>
by heating<br>
Ri02C      C02R2<br>
in a solvent with a salt. Examples of suitable solvents include mixtures of water and a polar<br>
solvent such as ethanol or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Examples of suitable salts include<br>
alkali metal and alkaline earth metal halides such as sodium chloride and alkali metal and<br>
j alkaline earth metal cyanides such as sodium cyanide, magnesium cyanide, and the like.<br>
The<br>
~C02R<br><br>
be hydrolyzed with an alkali metal hydroxide or an alkaline earth metal hydroxide to form an<br>
alkali or  alkaline earth metal carboxylate salt. The alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide<br>
can be any alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Examples of suitable alkali metal hydroxides include sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide,<br>
and potassium hydroxide. Examples of suitable alkaline earth metal hydroxides include<br>
i calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide. The reaction is usually run in a suitable protic<br>
solvent such as water or a mixture of water and a polar protic solvent such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, or isopropanol.<br>
The carboxylate salt can be reduced to give the alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of<br>
(±)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid. The carboxylate salt can be protonated with<br>
mineral acids or carboxylic acids to give the carboxylic acid and then the nitrile group of the<br>
i carboxylic acid can be reduced.<br>
Conversely, the nitrile group of the carboxylate salt can be reduced, and subsequently<br>
protonated to form the carboxylic acid. The salt can be treated with mineral acids or<br>
carboxylic acids to give (±)-3-(aminomethyl)5-methylhexanoic acid. Those skilled in the art<br>
I-<br>
are familiar with the reduction of nitrile functional groups. One common method of reducing<br>
i a nitrilel uses a hydrogenation catalyst, such as sponge nickel, in the presence of hydrogen.<br>
Other catalysts include palladium, platinum, rhodium, cobalt, and nickel. In general, the<br>
reaction^ is run in a solvent system such as a mixture of water and a polar protic solvent..<br>
The amino carboxylate formed after nitrile reduction can be obtained in the acid form by treating the amino carboxylate with an acid. The mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid can    be    used.    Carboxylic    acids,    such    as    acetic    acid,    can    also    be    used.<br>
Preferably, the acid is acetic acid, as a byproduct formed by the reaction is MOAc where M is an alkali metal ion (Na, K, and the like), and OAc is an acetate ion. The salt MOAc is more soluble in aqueous alcoholic solvents than inorganic salts such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and the like. Thus, isolation of the product is simplified, and the need for ion exchange treatment to remove excess salts is avoided.<br>
The cyano acid may also be reduced using a suitable hydrogenation catalyst, such as sponge nickel and hydrogen, in a polar solvent such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol in combination with ammonia or a mixture of ammonia and water. Examples of other suitable hydrogenation catalysts include palladium, platinum, rhodium, cobalt, and nickel.<br>
Ri02C      C02R2<br>
14<br><br>
can be hydrolyzed using an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide such as potassium<br>
hydroxide or sodium hydroxide in an alcohol solvent, which promotes decarboxylating.<br>
Further hydrolysis using an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide in water, an alcohol, or a<br>
mixture of water and an alcohol, gives carboxylate PG-03, which can be reduced with a<br>
hydrogenation catalyst followed by treatment with a mineral acid to give racemic 3-<br>
(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoicacid.<br>
Racemic   3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic . acid   can   be   resolved,   i.e.,   the<br>
enantiomers separated, by selective crystallization with (S)-mandelic acid. -i Racemic  3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic  acid and  (S)-mandelic  acid  can  be<br>
combined in a solvent such as water or an alcohol or a mixture of water and an alcohol to<br>
form  a  salt.  Examples  of suitable  alcohols  include  methanol,  ethanol,  n-propanol,<br>
isopropanol,      n-butanol,      tert-butanol,      and      the      like.      In      general,      the<br>
S,S salt precipitates from the solution, and the diastereomer, the R,S salt, stays in solution.<br>
Diasteriomeric purity of the S,S salt can be enhanced by further crystallization. Additional (S)-mandelic acid can. be included in the recrystallization to enhance diastereomeric enrichment. In general, an excess of mandelic acid is used. It is also noted that mandelic acid can be used in combination with another acid in accordance with the "Pope-Peachy? method known in the art.<br>
Removal of (S)-mandelic acid from the salt to give enriched (S)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid can be done using a polar aprotic solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide or mixtures of dimethylsulfoxide and water or tetrahydrofuran and water, at temperatures typically in the range of about 0°C to about 100°C.<br>
(Trituration to obtain the S-enantiomer has the advantage that it is operationally simple and more economical than traditional acid/base or ion exchange methods. Also provided by the present invention are the novel compounds<br>
