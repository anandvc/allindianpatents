The present invention relates to a spinning frame according to the preamble of the independent claim.<br>
With such a type of machine yarn of a high quality can be produced, that, with regard to hairiness, tear strength etc., distinctly differs from conventional yarns. Certain materials, for instance such with strong fibres or such with a high friction value, require an especially effective compacting operation prior to the twisting operation, so that the desired quality parameter can be actually reached.<br>
From the German patent application P 4426278.7 a spinning frame of this type is known, whereat within a suction insert of a sieve cylinder suction slots of up to 10 mm width are being provided, so that the compacting zone of the sieve drum has to extend over at least that width which corresponds with the width of the suction zone, that is the suction slot respectively. The compacting zone is chosen by that width because a transfer device is being applied to shift the fibre band back and forth. Furthermore, from the German patent PE 39 27 936 a spinning frame of the same type is known, where the suction slots below a sieve drum are being arranged in an inclined manner, therefore, the compacting zone of the sieve drum has to extend over at least that width that corresponds with the lateral off-set of the suction zone, that is the suction slot respectively. The fibre band on its way over the sieve drum carries out a lateral sliding movement whereby the compacting effect is to be improved.<br>
It has been experienced that in spinning frames of the described type with wide suction slots satisfactory results are not obtained under all conditions, which leads to the task, to optimize the compacting zone of a spinning frame.<br><br>
Said task is being solved with a spinning frame according to the object of the independent claim. In comparison to conventional spinning frames with a corresponding compacting device the yarn quality can be increased.<br>
The object of the invention comprises a spinning frame with a material presenter, a drafting unit, a compacting device and a spinning unit, whereat the fibre band is being led over a compacting element of the compacting device, said element being provided with a compacting zone with holes and suction openings whose inner space is being connected to a sucfion device. At a width of the compacting zone of 1 to 3 mm the traversing stroke of the traversing device, In other words the shifting of the fibre band on the compacting elements, amounts to two to four times the width of the compacting zone. The traversing device is to be designed in such a way that the fibre band offset, that is the shifting of a fibre band in relation to the centre of a compacting zone amounts to up to 6 mm. The traversing can occur symmetrically or asymmetrically with respect to the centre of the compacfing zone. The compacfing zone is to extend, along the circumference of the compacting element, parallel to the material flow, that is in the running direction of the fibre band respectively.<br>
To summaries it can be stated that when arranging a compacting device behind a drafting unit with a narrow, straight lined suction zone which is extending vertically in relation to the clamping gap between the two rollers of the drafting unit, with a traversing movement of the fibre band over a width being wider than the sucfion zone, than an improved condensing effect and thus an improved yarn quality can be achieved. The condensing effect can be further increased by a cover being placed above the suction zone.<br>
In the following the invention is being described in detail by way of the accompanying drawing, wherein show,<br>
fig. 1	a schematic illustration of a spinning unit of a spinning frame with a<br>
compacting device<br><br>
fig. 2  a side view of a compacting element<br>
fig. 3  the compacting zone of a compacting element<br>
In a conventional spinning frame the material presenter 7 either consists of a can or roving bobbin 7. A fibre band W shown in dotted line is being led from the can to the drafting unit. In case of a roving bobbin the roving is being drawn from the circumference of the bobbin. By way of a redirecting device the fibre web, that is the roving or the fibre band, is being led to the area of the drafting unit 1. The drafting unit comprises several pairs of delivery rollers, some of which are preferably being furnished with tapes. Between the first and the second delivery roller pair 11 the fibre band is only slightly drawn and between the second and the following roller pairs 31 and 33 it is being drawn more strongly, whereat the total drawing ratio can reach the value beyond 100. Between a nip roller 33 and a compacting element 31 the drawn fibre band is being clamped and subsequently being compacted in the compacting device 3. Along the compacting zone an umbrella-shaped guide 39 can accompany the fibre band on the surface of the compacting element. Finally a blocking roller 35 is being provided in the compacting zone, said roller being pressed against the compacting element and thus limits the twisting effect from the spinning unit against the direction of the material flow. Inside the compacting element 31' there is a suction element 37, which is being connected to the suction device 4.<br>
Between the drafting unit 1 and the spinning station 5 there is a yarn guide 55, which in case of a ring spinning station according to figure 1 limits the yarn balloon of the yarn 73 in upward direction. In the lower range of the spinning station the yarn 73 is being wound onto the yarn package 75, by means of a traveler on a ring being mounted on ring rail 51, and by rotation of a spindle 59 with a drive. The height of the yarn package is being determined by the moving distance of a ring rail drive 57, which moves the ring rail 51 up and down in vertical direction according to figure 1.<br>
Figure 2 shows a compacting element 31 in side view. Preferably the compacting element is being designed as a drum or belt, which like the other delivery rollers of<br><br>
the drafting unit, are being rotated around their rotary axes. On the circumference of the compacting element two compacting zones 311 are arranged according to figure 2 in such a way, so that with one compacting element 31 two fibre bands from two material presenter units 7 can be compacted. It is being assumed that from the area of the drafting unit 1, one or two fibre bands, 71 or 71' respectively, are being led over the circumference of the compacting element from the drafting unit 1 to the spinning unit 5. According to figure 2 one compacting zone 311,311' each is being arranged to a fibre band 71,71'. At the inlet side of the drafting unit 1 said fibre bands are being moved to and fro by the traversing device 9 in the direction of the roller axes of the delivery roller 11 and the compacting device 3, in order to reduce the wear of the rollers, that is the rubber coated rollers respectively. Thereby the fibre band width FB of the fibre band 71 can exceed the width SB of the compacting zone 311. The traversing movement of the fibre band, the fibre bands respectively, in longitudinal direction of the delivery rollers, the rollers of the compacting device 3 respectively, continues up to the area of the compacting device 3, so that the fibre band 71 or 71' respectively receives also on the surface of the compacting element 31 an offset at a right angle to the material flow direction, alternating to the left and to the right. For the compacting result, however, it does not matter if a fibre band 71 at the intake side of the compacting element 31 moves outside of the compacting zone 311 or 311' respectively. On the contrary, the compacting result is even better if the width of the compacting zone 311 is less than the width of a fibre band 71 at the outlet side of the drafting unit 1. The size of the stroke in the traversing device 9 can be of such a value that the fibre band offset V according to figure 2, that is the shifting of a fibre band 71 away from the centre of the compacting zone 311, can measure up to 5 mm. The traversing movement can take place symmetrical by up to ± 5 mm to the centre of the compacting zone or also asymmetrical by up to 5 mm away from the centre of compacting zone.<br>
Preferably the compacting zone 311 or 311' respectively, is being furnished as perforated zone of the compacting element 31 with holes or suction openings 313 respectively. The average diameter D of a suction opening measures preferably 1<br><br>
mm. Preferably circular openings are drilled into the casing of the compacting element 31, which as rows of holes in material flow direction along the compacting zone 311, are being spaced at a distance DV of up to 1.5 mm and at right angle to it at a lateral distance DH within the range of 1 mm. The average diameter D as well as the longitudinal distance DV in material flow direction and the lateral distance DH are preferably determined in relation to the fibre band width FB or the yarn type of the yarn 73 respectively.<br>
According to figure 3 the compacting zone 311 is being defined by two rows of holes next to each other, whereat the suction opening 313 cover a zone of the width SB. Instead of two rows, for instance three or four rows could be advantageous. The width of the suction opening 371 is to be chosen larger than the measurement SB.<br>
The beginning of the compacting zone 311,311' at the delivery side of the fibre band 71 in the compacting device 3 is defined by an edge 371A of a suction element 37 within the compacting device 3, whereat the suction element 37 and thus the edge 371A in relation to the clamping line Z, which is situated between nip roller 33 on the outlet side of the drafting unit and a compacting element 31 can be shifted in such a way, that the edge 371A in the running direction of the fibre band 71 is being positioned either before the clamping line, at the height of the clamping line Z or but only behind the clamping line Z. A suction element 37 is pivotally attached and fixedly locked at a suction device 4 within the zone of the compacting device 3.<br>
The shape of the hole of the suction opening 313 is preferably circular or oval, and the ratio of the hole diameter to the hole height is to be chosen between 0.25 and 0.5. The lateral distance DH in relation to the hole diameter D is to be determined in such a way that no continues webs result in the material flow direction.<br>
The following table lists the preferred value ranges to be applied (measurements in<br>
