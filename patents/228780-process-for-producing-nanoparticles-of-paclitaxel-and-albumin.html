				<td>PROCESS FOR PRODUCING NANOPARTICLES OF PACLITAXEL AND<br>
ALBUMIN<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing nanoparti-<br>
cles of paclitaxel and albumin, usable for obtaining antitumor compositions.<br>
Paclitaxel is a natural substance well known in literature, with im-<br>
portant antitumor activity: its poor water solubility makes it difficult to ad-<br>
minister to man, for which reason various systems have been developed to<br>
render it injectable.<br>
According to one of these systems, paclitaxel is combined with hu-<br>
man serum albumin (HSA) which is biocompatible and has considerable<br>
capacity to bind to the paclitaxel and form injectable emulsions therewith<br>
by known ultrasonication, high pressure homogenization and microfluidi-<br>
zation techniques (Allemann et a1., Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 39 (5), 173-<br>
191 (1993)).<br>
On the basis of these elements and by using the aforestated ultra-<br>
sonication and high pressure homogenization techniques, the American<br>
company VivoRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. has developed the formulation<br>
CAPXOL(R) containing paclitaxel and HSA.<br>
In US 5439686, US 5498421, US 5560933 and the corresponding<br>
WO 94/18954, VivoRx claims microparticles of paclitaxel and HSA prepared<br>
using ultrasonication techniques, to give particles of mean size (MPS) 
microns. The preparation methods described in these patents cannot be<br>
used on an industrial scale, and moreover the microparticles thus obtained<br>
have too high an MPS, which makes them unsuitable and unusable for<br>
administration to patients.<br>
This was well known to the said VivoRx, which then in US 5916596<br>
and US 6096331 and in WO 98/14174 and WO 99/00113 described and<br>
claimed sterile nanoemulsions of paclitaxel and HSA obtained by reconsti-<br>
tuting with sterile aqueous 0.9% NaCl solution lyophilized powders with<br>
MPS 
pressure homogenization, as described in the cited patents, are stated to<br>
have high stability, where the term "stability" means both that the MPS is<br>
constant with time and that nanoparticle precipitation is absent (US<br>
6096331, Ex. 11).<br>
According to the teachings of the aforecited VivoRx patents (see Ex-<br>
amples 1, 5 and 6 of US 5916596), a solution of paclitaxel and an aqueous<br><br>
solution containing HSA are firstly prepared separately, then these phases<br>
are mixed together and the mixture so obtained is subjected to homogeni-<br>
zation treatment at high pressure between 9000 and 40000 psi at room<br>
temperature (between 0°C and +40°C).<br>
After evaporating the solvents and filtering through a sterile filter<br>
(0.22 microns), this mixture is frozen between -20° C and -80°C and is fi-<br>
nally lyophilized by heating at a temperature between +20°C and +35°C to<br>
give a powder usable for preparing injectable formulations having antitumor<br>
properties.<br>
Two separate phases (one containing paclitaxel and the other con-<br>
taining HSA) must therefore be prepared, to be then mixed together before<br>
their high pressure homogenization. This requires the use of at least two<br>
separate reactors and the preparation of two separate solutions with relative<br>
mixing, all to be effected under sterile conditions, involving high plant costs,<br>
lengthy times for completing the mixing operations and the need for ro-<br>
tavapor evaporation of the solvents (at the end of homogenization treatment)<br>
followed by filtration through a sterile filter, with consequent low overall<br>
yields.<br>
The main object of the present invention is therefore to provide a<br>
process for producing sterile lyophilized powder of nanoparticles of pacli-<br>
taxel and HSA, which requires the use of a single reactor for forming the<br>
liquid mixture containing paclitaxel and HSA to be subjected to homogeni-<br>
zation treatment, and which can be completed in a very short time at lower<br>
cost than that of the known art.<br>
These and further objects are attained by a process by which an<br>
aqueous mixture containing paclitaxel and albumin at a temperature be-<br>
tween 0°C and 40°C is subjected to homogenization treatment at high pres-<br>
sure between 9000 and 40000 psi, to give a nanoemulsion which is frozen<br>
between -20°C and -80°C and is finally lyophilized by heating at a tempera-<br>
ture between +20°C and +35°C, wherein said aqueous mixture is obtained<br>
under sterile conditions by dissolving said albumin in sterile water to a con-<br>
centration between 2% and 3% (w/v), then adding to said albumin solution<br>
between 2% and 4% (v/v) of chloroform and then paclitaxel in sterile powder<br>
form in a quantity between 5.4% and 20.0% by weight on the weight of the<br>
albumin present in the solution. The quantity of paclitaxel in sterile powder<br>
form added to the liquid mixture is preferably between 5.6% and 19.4% by<br>
weight on the albumin.<br><br>
It is important to note that the use of paclitaxel in sterile powder form<br>
in the process not only greatly simplifies the plant itself and the process<br>
compared with the known art and enables the time required to complete the<br>
mixing of the various components before the homogenization treatment to<br>
be considerably shortened, but also enables better final yields to be ob-<br>
tained and simplifies the conditions to be observed in order to obtain the<br>
desired sterile lyophilized powders.<br>
By operating in the aforestated manner powders formed by mixtures<br>
of nanoparticles of paclitaxel and HSA are obtained which are totally similar<br>
or equal to those obtainable by the more complex, laborious and costly<br>
methods described in the aforestated prior patents.<br>
From these mixtures, when processed with an Avestin homogenizer<br>
within the pressure range recommended in US 5916596, nanoemulsions at<br>
pH=6.7 are obtained which, when evaporated in a rotavapor as reported in<br>
the said patent, provide nanoemulsions with MPS of about 0.2 microns<br>
(increase of MPS &gt; 0.02 microns after evaporation) which are poorly stable<br>
in their formulations in injectable physiological solutions (increase in MPS<br>
of about 0.05 microns and tendency to sediment in about 12 hours) and<br>
difficult to filter through 0.22 microns filters for their sterilization, these<br>
filters being easily clogged and reducing the paclitaxel yield to a very low<br>
value (down to or less than 30%).<br>
The stability (evaluated in accordance with the teachings of Example<br>
11 of US 6096331) of the products prepared both by the method of the pre-<br>
sent invention as hereinbefore defined and in accordance with the prior<br>
patents, when lyophilized and reconstituted as reported in US 5916596 and<br>
US 6096331, is acceptable but never exceeds 24 hours.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that if at least one biocompatible acid<br>
is added to the liquid mixture containing the HSA (before the paclitaxel in<br>
powder form is added to it) in a quantity sufficient to bring to between 5.4<br>
and 5.8 (preferably between 5.5 and 5.7) the pH of a reconstituted aqueous<br>
injectable mixture of the nanoparticles in powder form, the stability of the<br>
lyophilized and reconstituted mixture in injectable form considerably in-<br>
creases, beyond 24 hours.<br>
The addition of the aforesaid acid or also forms part of the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
Preferably, said acid is chosen from the group consisting of HC1, citric<br>
acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, biocompatible organic and inorganic ac-<br>
ids, but citric acid is the most preferred one.<br>
To clarify the characteristics of the present invention, some non-<br>
limiting examples of its implementation will now be described, some with<br>
liquid mixtures at physiological pH and some acidified to highlight the dif-<br>
ferences consequent on the use of the acids.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of formulation at pH 6.7<br>
An injectable aqueous 20% (w/v) HSA solution in accordance with<br>
FDA specifications (pH=6.9±0.5) is diluted to 3% (w/v) with sterile demin-<br>
eralized water.<br>
41.4 ml of said solution are mixed under energetic agitation with 1.25<br>
ml of sterile chloroform and with 73.6 mg (5.9% by weight on the weight of<br>
the albumin in the solution) of sterile paclitaxel (titre &gt; 99%) in powder<br>
form, then the mixture is processed in a high pressure homogenizer<br>
(suitably sterilized) until a nanoemulsion (MPS about 0,2 microns) is ob-<br>
tained, this being evaporated under vacuum to remove the solvent, frozen<br>
and lyophilized under sterile conditions for 48 hours.<br>
The powder obtained, containing 4.60 % (w/w) of paclitaxel, is re-<br>
constituted with an aqueous 0.9% NaCl solution to a paclitaxel concentra-<br>
tion of 2 mg/ml. The formulation obtained has an MPS of 0.486 microns,<br>
pH=6.7, and a stability 
The product obtained has the same characteristics as that prepared<br>
by the method used in Example 1 of US 5916596.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Preparation of formulation at pH 6.7<br>
An injectable aqueous 25% (w/v) HSA solution in accordance with<br>
FDA specifications (pH=6.9±0.5) is diluted to 2% (w/v) with sterile demin-<br>
eralized water.<br>
49.0 ml of said solution are mixed with 1.0 ml of sterile chloroform<br>
and with 72.5 mg (7.4% to albumin) of sterile paclitaxel (titre &gt; 99%) in<br>
powder form, then the mixture is processed in a high pressure homogenizer<br>
(suitably sterilized) until a nanoemulsion (MPS about 0,2 microns) is ob-<br>
tained, this being evaporated under vacuum to remove the solvents, filtered<br>
through a sterile filter (0.2 microns), frozen and lyophilized under sterile<br>
conditions for 48 hours.<br><br>
The powder obtained, containing 0.60% (w/w) of paclitaxel, is re-<br>
constituted with an aqueous 0.9% NaCl solution to a paclitaxel concentra-<br>
tion of 2 mg/ml. The formulation obtained has an MPS of 0,25 microns,<br>
pH=6.7, and a stability 
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Preparation of formulation at pH 6.7<br>
An injectable aqueous 20% (w/v) HSA solution in accordance with<br>
FDA specifications (pH=6.9±0.5) is diluted to 3% (w/v) with sterile demin-<br>
eralized water.<br>
46.7 ml of said solution are mixed with 1.40 ml of sterile CHCI3 and<br>
with 108.5 mg (7.7% to albumin) of sterile paclitaxel (titre &gt; 99%) in powder<br>
form, then the mixture is processed in a high pressure homogenizer<br>
(suitably sterilized) until a nanoemulsion (MPS about 0.2 microns) is ob-<br>
tained, this being evaporated under vacuum to remove the solvents, filtered<br>
through a sterile filter (0.2 microns), frozen and lyophilized under sterile<br>
conditions for 48 hours.<br>
The powder obtained, containing 0.77 % (w/w) of paclitaxel, is re-<br>
constituted with an aqueous 0.9% NaCl solution to a paclitaxel concentra-<br>
tion of 2 mg/ml. The formulation obtained has an MPS of 0,12 microns,<br>
pH=6.7, and a stability 
As already stated in the initial descriptive part, the filtration resulted<br>
in a considerable loss of paclitaxel (the lyophilized powder contains 0.55%<br>
of paclitaxel instead of the 5.2% of Example 2). This enabled a formulation<br>
to be obtained with MPS 
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Preparation of formulation at pH 6.7<br>
An injectable aqueous 25% (w/v) HSA solution in accordance with<br>
FDA specifications (pH=6.9±0.5) is diluted to 3% (w/v) with sterile demin-<br>
eralized water.<br>
29.1 ml of said solution are mixed with 0.90 ml of sterile CHCl3 and<br>
67.0 mg (7.7% to albumin) of sterile paclitaxel (titre &gt; 99%) in powder form,<br>
then the mixture is processed in a high pressure homogenizer (suitably<br>
sterilized) until a nanoemulsion (MPS about 0.2 microns) is obtained, this<br>
being evaporated under vacuum to remove the solvents, filtered through a<br>
sterile filter (0.2 microns), frozen and lyophilized under sterile conditions for<br>
48 hours.<br><br>
The powder obtained, containing 0.70% (w/w) of paclitaxel, is re-<br>
constituted with an aqueous 0.9% NaCl solution to a paclitaxel concentra-<br>
tion of 1.5 mg/ml. The formulation obtained has an MPS of 0.25 microns,<br>
pH=6.7, and a stability 
The product obtained has the same characteristics as that prepared<br>
by the method used in Example 5 of US 5916596.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Preparation of formulation at pH 6.7<br>
An injectable aqueous 20% (w/v) HSA solution in accordance with<br>
FDA specifications (pH=6.9±0.5) is diluted to 2.5% (w/v) with sterile demin-<br>
eralized water and presaturated with chloroform (1% v/v).<br>
48.5 ml of said solution are mixed with 1.0 ml of sterile CHC13 and<br>
with 75 mg (6.2% to albumin) of sterile paclitaxel (titre &gt; 99%) in powder<br>
form, then the mixture is processed in a high pressure homogenizer<br>
(suitably sterilized) until a nanoemulsion (MPS about 0.2 microns) is ob-<br>
tained, this being evaporated under vacuum to remove the solvent, filtered<br>
through a sterile filter (0.2 microns), frozen and lyophilized under sterile<br>
conditions for 48 hours.<br>
The powder obtained, containing 0.70 % (w/w) of paclitaxel, is re-<br>
constituted with an aqueous 0.9% NaCl solution to a paclitaxel concentra-<br>
tion of 2.2 mg/ml. The formulation obtained has an MPS of 0.18 microns,<br>
pH=6.7, and a stability

FDA specifications (pH=6.9±0.5) is diluted to 3% (w/v) with sterile demin-<br>
eralized water, the pH being corrected to a value of 5.6 with 1M HC1 which<br>
salifies some basic groups present in albumin.<br>
57 ml of said solution, previously sterilized, are mixed under vigorous<br>
stirring for at least 30 minutes, with 1.40 ml of sterile chloroform and with<br>
108 mg (6.3% to albumin) of sterile paclitaxel (titre &gt; 99%) in powder form.<br>
The mixture is processed in a homogenizer (suitably sterilized) at<br>
high pressure (9000-40000 psi) until a nanoemulsion (MPS 
is obtained, this being rapidly frozen to -80°C and lyophilized for 55 hours<br>
under sterile conditions, while raising the temperature to +30°C.<br><br>
The powder obtained, containing 4.83 % (w/w) of paclitaxel and 4%<br>
(w/w) of water, is reconstituted with an aqueous 0.9% NaCl solution to a<br>
paclitaxel concentration of 2 mg/ml. The formulation obtained has an MPS<br>
of 0.175 microns, pH=5.6, and a stability &gt; 24 hours.<br>

The mixture is processed in a homogenizer (suitably sterilized) at<br>
high pressure (9000-40000 psi) until a nanoemulsion (MPS 
is obtained, this being rapidly frozen to -30°C and lyophilized for 57 hours<br>
under sterile conditions, while raising the temperature to +35°C.<br>

A process for producing a sterile lyophilized powder consisting of<br>
nanoparticles of paclitaxel and human serum albumin, by which an aqueous<br>
mixture containing paclitaxel and albumin at a temperature between 0°C and<br>
40°C is subjected to homogenization treatment at high pressure between 9000<br>
and 40000 psi, to give a nanoemulsion which is frozen between -20°C and -80°C<br>
and is finally lyophilized by heating to between +20°C and +35°C, characterized<br>
in that said aqueous mixture is obtained under sterile conditions by dissolving<br>
between 2% and 3% (w/v) of said albumin in sterile water, then adding to said<br>
albumin solution between 2% and 4% (v/v) of sterile chloroform and then<br>
paclitaxel in sterile powder form in a quantity between 5.4% and 20.0% by<br>
weight on the weight of the albumin present in the solution.</td>
