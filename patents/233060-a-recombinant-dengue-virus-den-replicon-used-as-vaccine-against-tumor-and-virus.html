				<td>Virus-like particle containing a dengue virus recombinant replicon<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to dengue virus (DEN) and in particular to a recombinant virus that is<br>
prepared by replacing DEN structural protein genes with non-dengue transgenes, such as,<br>
therapeutic antigens, and its production and application.<br>
Background<br>
Cancer threatens human health seriously. Some cancers have been linked to a variety of<br>
viruses, most notably human papillomavirus (HPV), which is responsible for cervical cancer.<br>
The prevalence of HPV infection of the female genital tract has a positive correlation with the<br>
pathological progression of the diseased cervix presenting in the normal progression of the<br>
disease beginning with chronic cervicitis -» pseudocondyloma -* verruca lesions -* condyloma<br>
acuminate -* cervical intraepithelial neoplasia -* cervical cancers. HPV infection has been<br>
shown to be extremely common affecting 10-40 percent of women in China and 40-60 percent<br>
of women in Europe and the Western Countries.<br>
Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer after breast cancer among women<br>
worldwide. According to WHO, there are 1.7 million cervical cancer patients diagnosed<br>
worldwide, and approximately 500,000 new cases are diagnosed per year. There are as many<br>
as 200,000 deaths per year. There are nearly 140,000 cervical cancer patients in China, and<br>
40,000 new cases are diagnosed every year. Moreover, more than 75 percent of cervical<br>
cancers were found to be associated with HPV 16 and/or HPV 18 infection.<br>
The current treatments for cervical cancer are surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and<br>
occasionally such treatments are combined with therapies known as Chinese medicine, herb<br>
medicine, and so on. Unfortunately, the effect is not satisfactory, and the five-year survival rate<br>
is 65 percent. The prognosis following the recurrence of disease is extremely poor, with only<br>
five percent survival over two years. The expense for cervical cancer screening and therapy in<br>
the USA is approximately 570 million dollars per year.<br>
The three traditional methods for cervical cancer therapy, surgery, chemotherapy and<br>
radiotherapy, have many limitations, such as high disease recurrence rate, serious side effects<br>
and tolerance. Because of its theoretically high specificity and low side effects, biotherapy,<br>
especially immuriotherapy and gene therapy, is being viewed as a new strategy for tumor<br>
therapy. The sciences of immunotherapy and gene therapy are now being applied in the<br>
treatment and cure of many different diseases and the promise of biotherapy is being realized.<br>
In the area of cancer treatment vaccines, a number of different strategies are being pursued.<br>
Inactivated vaccines:<br>
The earliest tumor vaccines with good safety, cannot induce effective cellular immune<br>
responses because the antigen generally cannot be expressed by a host cell.<br>
DNA virus vector vaccines:<br>
A kind of live vaccine with a DNA genome as the vector, can effectively replicate and express<br>
an oncogene in vivo and can continually stimulate the cellular immune system to produce<br>
cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) against tumors. But to avoid oncogenicity, only parts of the oncogene<br>
are commonly employed as the antigen. Thus the immunogenicity of the antigen is reduced.<br>
Another problem of this type of vaccine is safety.<br>
Borysiewicz LK et al (Lancet. 1996 Jun 1:347(9014): 1523-7.) reported an HPV vaccine with<br>
vaccinia virus as vector. But, most people have antibody to vaccinia so its application is limited.<br>
Moreover, boosters of the vaccine are useless because of the existing or developed immune<br>
response to the vector.<br>
WO0153467 provides recombinant yellow fever virus (YFV), which comprise exogenous<br>
nucleotide sequences. Infection of a host cell with a recombinant YFV provides for expression<br>
of the exogenous nucleic acid in a host cell and production of an antigenic polypeptide encoded<br>
by the exogenous nucleic acid. Such recombinant YFV are useful in eliciting an immune<br>
response to the exogenous polypeptide. But the recombinant YFV, retaining the whole YFV<br>
genome without deletion of some relevant cis genes, is replicable and thus, infectious. So the<br>
recombinant YFV as a vaccine is not safe, although its preparation does not need a packaging<br>
system.<br>
WO9928487 provides an expression and delivery method of exogenous sequences by the<br>
flavivirus, kunjin virus (KUN). KUN replicons are constructed by the deletion of part of the KUN<br>
structural genes and the insertion of an exogenous sequence (i.e., non-KUN) into the genome,<br>
Hillowed by packaging as KUN virus-like particles (VLP) in host cells, along with infection by<br>
other virus carrying the complementing coding region of the deleted KUN structural protein<br>
gene(s). However, the titer of VLP was unsatisfactory. Also, the booster immunization will be<br>
less effective. The KUN genome is stable in plasmids, which can be cloned and recombined<br>
with traditional methods. However, that strategy does not apply to other flaviviruses. For<br>
example, DEN sequences have lower stability in plasmids than KUN, probably because KUN<br>
belongs to the Japanese encephalitis virus group whereas DEN belongs to the different Dengue<br>
virus group. The two groups have only 45% homology at the level of the genome. So it is hard<br>
to construct DEN replicons and to obtain DEN VLPs directly following the teachings of<br>
WO9928487.<br>
WO02072803 teaches a method for construction of DEN subgenomic replicons and use thereof<br>
for a DEN vaccine. Nevertheless, it is difficult to apply the invention because there is some<br>
insufficient information in the application.<br>
Antigen presenting cells (APC) vaccines:<br>
The preparation and use of APC vaccines is, for example, based on the approach whereby<br>
dendritic cells (DC) from a patient are cultured and amplified, transformed to express a tumorassociated<br>
antigen (TAA) or tumor-specific antigen (TSA), and the treated DC cells then<br>
become an APC vaccine for the patient. The APCs will activate T cells of the patient to kill<br>
tumor cell when the vaccine is injected into patient. However, such an APC vaccine is patientspecific<br>
so these vaccines can't be administered en masse to a wide population. Moreover, this<br>
therapy is time-consuming, labor-consuming, is associated with a high-cost because it is difficult<br>
to culture DCs, it is costly to amplify the transformed cells, it can be difficult to activate and<br>
obtain maturation of DCs for proper and effective antigen presentation and there are quality<br>
control issues because of the difficult vaccine preparation process and the individual nature of<br>
the product.<br>
In summary, there is an urgent requirement for novel vaccines with high capacity, host cells are<br>
long-lived, can carry large inserts and are easy to propagate. Such vaccines also are not<br>
oncogenic and can be administered repeatedly.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention aims to provide novel products applicable to industrial production, which have<br>
good safety, high tiler, good booster effects, especially the vaccines against tumor and virus.<br>
In a first aspect the invention provides recombinant DEN with a deletion of preM and comprising<br>
of follow nucleotide sequences at least:<br>
a) DEN 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR);<br>
b) The coding region of the first 20 amino acids of the DEN capsid protein;<br>
c) The coding region of the signal peptide of the DEN NS1 protein;<br>
d) The coding region of all the DEN non-structure proteins<br>
e) DEN 3'-end untranslation region (3'-UTR)<br>
f) Exogenous nucleotide sequences (i.e., non-DEN) between b) and c)<br>
In preferred embodiments, the 3' end of any exogenous nucleotide sequence contains 3'<br>
release elements upstream of the coding region of the NS1 signal peptide, which can be the 5'<br>
release elements. These release elements can be a nucleotide sequence obtained from the<br>
autoprotease of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (SEQ ID NO: 3), or nucleotide sequence<br>
encoding the substrate of signal peptide protease (SEQ ID NO: 44) or both.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, DEN is obtained from any one of the following: DEN type I,<br>
DEN type II, DEN type III, or DEN type IV.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the coding region of the NS1 signal peptide is composed of<br>
the about last 72 nucleotides of the 3' terminus of the E gene. Alternatively, a suitable signal<br>
peptide encoding sequence can be subcloned upstream in an operable situs of the NS1 coding<br>
sequence.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the exogenous sequence encodes an HPV antigen,<br>
immunoregulators or both.<br>

replicon or a DEN-VLP for prophylactic and therapeutic use as a drug for tumor and viral<br>
infection.<br>
In a fifth aspect, the present invention also provides cells for a packaging system encapsulating<br>
DEN recombinant replicons into VLP. These packaging cells are selected from:<br>
a) Cells transfected by a plasmid with deleted structural genes of a Dengue recombinant<br>
replicon,<br>
b) Cells transfected by a vector derived from a helper virus containing sequences of the<br>
structural proteins which are deleted from the DEN recombinant replicon (a), and<br>
c) Cells integrated with structural genes which are deleted from the DEN recombinant<br>
replicon (a) in the genome thereof, and above cells express DEN structural proteins for<br>
complementing replicon packaging and the structural gene expression doesn't affect the<br>
growth of the host cells.<br>
In a sixth aspect, the present invention provides a method for production of a virus-like particle<br>
(VLP) as herein described comprising the steps of:<br>
a) Introducing into a DEN packaging cell line, a DEN recombinant replicon or a VLP<br>
containing said replicon of claim 1;<br>
b) Culturing that cell line either so it can express the DEN structural proteins; or introducing<br>
into that cell line replicons of a helper virus containing a DEN structural gene if the cell<br>
line cannot express that DEN structural gene, then culturing the cell line; and<br>
c) Collecting DEN-VLP containing DEN recombinant replicons.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, said packaging cells contain a DEN structural protein<br>
expression vector, selected from a vector with an NS3 deletion and a Tet-regulated vector.<br>
Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
Fig 1 shows preparation of a Dengue vector carrying HPV sequences (in method 1 of example<br>
4)<br>
Fig 2 shows an alternative preparation of a Dengue vector carrying HPV sequences by another<br>
method (in method 4 of example 4)<br>
Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention relates to materials and methods for making a DEN-VLP preparation, as<br>
exemplified in the construction of a VLP carrying expressed HPV sequences with good safety,<br>
high liter and good booster effects.<br>
"Nt," as used herein, means a nucleotide.<br>
"Release element" refers to nucleotide sequences at the 3' end of a structural polypeptide<br>
coding sequence or at the 5' end of the NS1 signal peptide-coding region, used to enhance<br>
release of the polypeptide by a signal peptide protease without unrelated sequences after<br>
protein translation. The preferred release element selects from nucleotide sequence encoding<br>
Foot-And-Mouth virus hydrolytic enzyme as SEQ ID NO: 3 showed and nucleotide sequence<br>
encoding signal peptide hydrolytic enzyme substrate as SEQ ID NO:44 showed or their<br>
combination. Usually there is only one "release element", but there are many "release element"<br>
occasionally.<br>
The terms "immunological activity" or "immunogenicity" refers to the ability to induce a specific<br>
humoral and/or cellular immunity of a mammal by natural, recombinant or synthetic<br>
immunogens, such as peptides.<br>
The terms "antigen polypeptide" or "antigen peptide" refers to the amino acid sequence eliciting<br>
an immune response of a mammal whether single or combined with other helper molecules (for<br>
example, Human histocompatibility antigen (HLA) I or II).<br>
The term "immune response" refers to a cellular and/or humoral immune response, for example,<br>
sufficient to inhibit or prevent, for example, infection or disease caused by microbes.<br>
The terms "object," "individual" or "patient" refers to any object which needs diagnosis or<br>
therapy, especially mammals, such as human. Other objects include other mammals, such as,<br>
cow, dog, cat, cavy, rabbit, rat, mouse, horse etc.<br>
Based on the experiments, the DEN recombinant replicon will have the following characteristics.<br>
1. All of the full non-structural gene sequences must be present in the replicon. Any deletion of<br>
a structural gene or loss of expression of a structural gene must be one that does not have a<br>
negative impact on non-structural protein expression and doesn't result in a frame shift mutation<br>
of a non-structural protein and a signal peptide thereof.<br>
2. The first 60 or so nt of the C protein gene (the coding sequence of the first 20 amino acids of<br>
the C protein, that is, the amino terminus of the capsid protein) must be present in the vector<br>
because those sequences are complementary to the 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR sequences which form<br>
a circle for DEN gene replication and virus packaging. If that region is shorter than 60 nt, the<br>
efficiency of VLP formation will decrease. Sequences longer than 60 nt (for example, 81, 99,<br>
120, 150 and 180 nt) can form VLP, however, the possible length of any exogenous gene will<br>
decrease accordingly because of packaging limitations. So the optimal dimension is retention of<br>
about the first 60-150 nt of the 5' terminus of the C protein gene, optimally 60-120 nt.<br>
3. The non-structural protein NS1 signal peptide, namely the last 24 or so amino acids of the E<br>
protein, must be present in the replicon. The corresponding coding sequence is the last about<br>
72 nts of the E protein gene. If shorter than 72 nts, the efficiency of VLP formation will<br>
decrease. If longer than 72 nt (for example, 81, 99, 120 or 150 nt), the vector can still form a<br>
VLP, however, the length of the exogenous gene insert will decrease accordingly because of<br>
packaging limitations. So the optimal dimension is retention of 72-150 nt, optimally 60-120 nt.<br>
4. The deletion of a structural gene and insertion of an exogenous gene in the deleted site can't<br>
affect NS1 signal peptide function, as well as function of the downstream non-structural genes.<br>
The DEN structural protein-coding region includes C-preM-E. Usually, portions of the C-preM-E<br>
coding sequence can be deleted (about 100-2000 bp, optimally 500-2000 bp). Another optimal<br>
method is complete preM deletion to enhance safety.<br>
The DEN virus that can be used to make a vector in the present invention has no special<br>
limitation and can be any subtype of DEN Virus. Four subtypes of DEN genome that can be<br>
used, for example, have the following ATCC accession numbers:<br>
DEN virus type I M87512;<br>
N virus type ii M29095;<br>
DEN virus type ill M93130;and<br>
DEN virus type IV AF289029.<br>
DEN virus has a property of being bound by dendritic ceils, which can enhance vaccine effects.<br>
Furthermore, DEN has an ADE property (antibody dependent enhancement of infection), which<br>
refers to the observation that after a first immunization of DEN, antibody dependent infection is<br>
enhanced when the host is immunized with a different DEN subtype. So DEN is effective for<br>
repetitive, booster immunization. The ADE phenomena can be used for exogenous protein<br>
expression systems, which not only avoid neutralization of vector caused by repetitive<br>
immunization, but also increases the efficiency of infection of vectors into cells and exogenous<br>
protein delivery efficiency. Because DEN has four subtypes, any one can be used for an<br>
exogenous expression vector, through further inoculation with different DEN recombinant<br>
replicons, that is, of a different subtype, tends to intensify immunization efficiency.<br>
Exogenous genes used in the present invention have no special limitation. It can be any<br>
exogenous coding sequence, such as an aptamer, siRNA, ribozyme and the like, any<br>
therapeutic gene, such as a gene encoding an antibody to VEGF, an interferon, a cytokine and<br>
so on, a tumor antigen gene, a virus antigen gene, an immunoregulator gene and so on. The<br>
representative antigens include (but not limited to): human HPV antigen (such as the E6 or E7<br>
protein of the 16 and 18 subtype), HIV antigen, HBV antigen, HCV antigen, EBV antigen, HTLV-<br>
1 antigen, MAGE, BAGE, CAGE etc. The length of an exogenous gene has no special<br>
limitation, usually the foreign coding sequence is from about 100 bp to about 2000 bp, optimally<br>
from about 150 bp to about 1200 bp. Furthermore, a release element, such as 2A, can be<br>
added at the 3' end of an exogenous gene to ensure a high level of expression of the expressed<br>
sequence. If the intercalated exogenous gene is a tumor antigen gene or a virus antigen gene,<br>
said VLP can be used for prevention and therapy of tumor and virus diseases.<br>
Taking human papilloma virus (HPV) as an example, the present invention provides<br>
preventative and therapeutic compositions against diseases caused by HPV infection. Therein<br>
said composition contains a VLP packaged using a DEN recombinant replicon using necessary<br>
complementing DEN structural proteins. Therein said exogenous nucleic acid sequence of the<br>
DEN recombinant replicon encodes an antigen of one or many HPV subtypes. The vector can<br>
contain also a sequence encoding an immunoregulator, or the immunoregulator sequence may<br>
be carried by a second vector. Therein said HPV antigen protein can be E6, E7 or an E6/E7<br>
fusion or composite molecule oncoprotein of HPV 16 or HPV 18, or can be an HPV major<br>
capsid protein L1 or minor capsid protein L2. Therein said immunoregulator can be a gene<br>
sequence encoding a polypeptide with an immunoregulating activity obtained from, for example,<br>
IL2, IL12, IL18, GM-CSF etc. or a functional portion thereof.<br>
The composition provided by said invention has the advantage of being relatively nonimmunogenic<br>
to the host, and thus can be administered repeatedly with effect. Such an antihuman<br>
papilloma virus composition provides prevention and therapy for diseases caused by<br>
papilloma virus, such as chronic cervicitis, pseudocondyloma, verrucous lesions, condyloma<br>
acurninata, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical cancer etc.<br>
Construction of said replicon can be processed as follows:<br>
1. Construction of a full-length DEN genome sequence.<br>
This can be fulfilled by normal PCR and ligation techniques as known in the art.<br>
2. Deletion of parts of one or more DEN structural genes.<br>
This can be fulfilled by homologous recombination or synthesis of a deleted sequence that is<br>
cloned into and replaces the portion to be deleted from the DEN genome. A known method is<br>
homologous recombination in yeast.<br>
1. Insertion of an exogenous gene coding sequence.<br>
Though the exogenous gene can be inserted into regions with partial structural gene deletion by<br>
a known method, a preferred method is homologous recombination in yeast where sequences<br>
homologous to two sites flanking the insertion site are ligated to the two ends of the exogenous<br>
gene, introducing said construct into yeast along with a DEN genome DNA with a structural<br>
gene deletion, then obtaining the replicon carrying the exogenous gene inserted therein through<br>
homologous recombination. This recombination incidence approaches 100%, making<br>
construction relatively easy, controllable and stable.<br>
After obtaining the replicon, it can be introduced into packaging cells to produce VLP. A normal<br>
method is after the DEN replicon is introduced into cells, and then the helper virus expressing a<br>
necessary structural protein is introduced into those cells. Another method is construction of<br>
expression packaging cells with an inducible or constitutive plasmid carrying the DEN structural<br>
oene as a vector and then introduction of the replicon (or VLP) into these cells to produce VLP.<br>
For example, constitutive packaging cells can be made that do not express a functional NS3<br>
gene. The NS3 gene possesses a special packaging signal sequence and thus, a DEN<br>
genome with an NS3 deletion can't be packaged into a VLP. So if the packaging cell doesn't<br>
have a functional DEN NS3 gene, it can't be packaged into VLP themselves. VLP produced by<br>
this packaging cell only contains a DEN recombinant replicon, and thus, there is no need to<br>
screen amongst the replicons for those that are recombinant.<br>
Specifically, methods include:<br>
a) The packaging cells can contain tetracycline-regulated gene expression boxes for<br>
expressing a DEN structural protein. Recombinant DEN RNA replicon is introduced<br>
into packaging cell to produce VLP containing DEN replicon.<br>
b) After a recombinant DEN replicon is introduced into cells and cultured (for example,<br>
about 24 hrs), a helper virus, for example, an alpha virus replicon, expressing a<br>
complementing DEN structural protein (or other expression vector) is introduced into<br>
said cells to produce VLP containing DEN replicon.<br>
c) If the packaging cell expresses a DEN genome with partial deletion of NS3 gene<br>
expression, a recombinant DEN replicon is introduced into said packaging cell to<br>
produce a VLP containing DEN replicon.<br>
d) After infected with a VLP and cultured, cells are infected by a helper virus, such as an<br>
alpha virus replicon, expressing a complementing DEN structural protein (or other<br>
nonreplicable virus vector) to produce a VLP containing a DEN replicon.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The present invention also provides various compositions comprising such a recombinant DEN<br>
replicon and/or a VLP, including a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Various compositions comprising such a recombinant DEN can include different buffers<br>
according to practical purposes and substances suitable to other purposes required of a<br>
pharmaceutical delivery form, as known in the art. These compositions generally contain<br>
pharmaceutically available carriers, diluents and excipients as known in the pharmaceutic arts,<br>
"Remington: Pharmacology and Pharmacological Practice" 19th ed. (1995) Mack Publishing Co.<br>
Parmaceutical compositions can be made into a variety of forms, such as injection, solid forms,<br>
such as grains, tablets, pills, suppositories and capsules, other liquid forms, such as a<br>
suspension, a spray etc. The pharmaceutical grade organic or inorganic vectors and/or<br>
attenuants suitable to oral or local use can be used for dispensing of various compositions<br>
including therapeutically active compounds. For example, some of the known carriers include<br>
water for injection, plant and animal oil and fats, and so on, as known in the art. The stabilizer,<br>
wetting agent, emulsifier, salt suitable for controlling osmolarity, various buffers suitable for<br>
maintenance of appropriate pH, surfactants, permeants to enhance transdermal movement and<br>
so on can be used for auxiliary materials as known in the art.<br>
The said recombinant DEN can be put into dispensing means as known in the art. Thus, for<br>
example, the VLP can be put into dispensing through familiar methods of this field and suitable<br>
pharmaceutical or transforming vehicles. The suitable vehicles are sterile saline. Other aqueous<br>
or inaqueous iso-osmotic sterile injections and sterile suspensions also can be used<br>
(pharmaceutically available vehicles, also familiar to technicians of this field).<br>
Moreover, the said compositions can also contain other components such as an adjuvant, a<br>
stabilizer, a pH regulator, a preservative etc. These components are familiar to technicians of<br>
this field. Adjuvants include but are not limited to an aluminum adjuvant, a saponin adjuvant, a<br>
Ribi adjuvant (Ribi ImmunoChem Research Inc., Hamilton, MT), a Montanide ISA adjuvant<br>
(Seppic, Paris, France), a Hunter's TiterMax adjuvant (CytRx Corp., Norcross, GA), a Gerbu<br>
adjuvant (Gerbu Biotechnik GmbH, Gaiberg, Germany) and so on. In addition, other<br>
components for regulating and modifying the immunological response can be used.<br>
Administration pathway and dose<br>
The said recombinant DEN replicon and/ or VLP can be administered to an individual through<br>
known methods. The said composition is often administered through a normal vaccine<br>
administering pathway or modeling pathogen infection pathway. The pharmaceutically available<br>
vehicles can be used when administrating vaccine compositions.<br>
Normal and pharmaceutically available administration pathways include intranasal,<br>
intramuscular, intratracheal, subcutaneous, intracutaneous, endovaginal, intrapulmonary,<br>
intravenous, nasal, oral or other extraintestinal pathways. Combined administration can be<br>
made if needed or it can be regulated according to the transgene, the disease, the disease<br>
'condition and so on. The vaccine composition can be administered as a single dose or in<br>
multiple doses, and also contain a booster dose to elicit and/or to maintain immunity.<br>
"Effective dose" is given in an amount such that the availability of DEN recombinant replicon<br>
and/or VLP is of an amount so as to elicit an immune response and effectively prevent a host<br>
against a virus infection, tumor or other source of pathology etc. Usually, after infecting host<br>
cells, every dose of vaccine is enough to produce from about 1 to about 1000 ug, or about 1 to<br>
about 200 ug, or about 10 to about 100 ug of transgene. The vaccine effective dose calculated<br>
with recombinant DEN nucleic acids as a basis usually includes administrating about 1 to about<br>
1000 ug nucleic acids. Furthermore, the average range of vaccine effective dose is about 102 to<br>
about 109, about 103 to about 107, or about 104 to about 105 plaque forming units (PFU). The<br>
optimal dose of vaccine can be determined, for example, by antibody titer of experimental<br>
objects and standard investigation methods of other reactions, as known in the art. Whether a<br>
booster dose is needed can be detected by supervising immunity levels using immune assays<br>
as known in the art. After evaluating serum antibody titer, one or more booster doses can be<br>
administered. Administering adjuvant and/or immunological stimulant can enhance an immune<br>
response to the target transgene.<br>
Compared with known technology, the present invention has the following advantages:<br>
1. Enhancement of immunological effectiveness.<br>
a) The dendritic cell is the most effective antigen presenting cell. In the present invention,<br>
antigen is effectively expressed and presented in said infected cells eliciting an effective<br>
immune response against antigen with a DEN replicon as vector, capitalizing on the<br>
affinity of DEN for dendritic cells..<br>
b) Utilizing the characteristic of different DEN, repetitive infection and the ADE<br>
phenomenon, the user can inoculate repetitively to enhance immunological effects.<br>
c) As tumor antigen and virus antigen, an E6 and/or E7 recombinant DEN replicon can<br>
express E6 and/or E7 antigen in cells for an extended time and effectively can stimulate<br>
immunologic reaction to antigen for an extended period.<br>
2 Enhancement of vaccine safety.<br>
a) Recombinant DEN replicon RNAs replicate and are expressed exclusive in the<br>
cytoplasm, and thus, it is difficult for recombination to occur in the somatic cell genome.<br>
b) The recombinant DEN replicon is a recombinant DEN RNA with a structural gene<br>
deletion. That replicon only replicates and expresses in somatic cells and doesn't form<br>
infectious virus particles.<br>
c) The immune system has the ability to recognize and clear recombinant replicon. As a<br>
result, it isn't permanently present in vivo.<br>
3, Little treatment distress.<br>
a) Administration just a few times, reducing patient distress in the therapy process.<br>
b) The composition operates quickly in the host, thereby shortening the course of therapy.<br>
4. Low cost:<br>
a) The packaging cells expressing a DEN structural protein are transfected by a DEN<br>
recombinant replicon to produce VLP and then are transfected by VLP again to produce<br>
substantial quantities of VLP, increasing VLP construction efficiency. That avoids<br>
massive replicon construction, shortens vaccine production, increases vaccine<br>
production efficiency and decreases cost.<br>
b) The constitutive expressing packaging cells without NS3 expression are transfected by<br>
a DEN recombinant replicon to produce VLP. NS3 has a special packaging signal<br>
sequence and a DEN genome with an NS3 deletion can't be packaged into a VLP. So,<br>
packaging cells can't package and form VLP themselves. VLP produced by this<br>
packaging cell contains recombinant DEN replicon only, and there is no need to screen<br>
virus particles for recombinants, thereby enhancing construction efficiency.<br>
The invention now is exemplified in the following representative examples. Clearly, these<br>
examples only clarify and don't limit this invention. The experimental methods taught herein,<br>
many of which are known in the art, can be performed practicing such known methods, such as<br>
those taught in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (New York, Cold<br>
Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989) or recommended by manufacturers.<br>
Example 1<br>
Construction of Full-length DEN Virus cDNA Clones<br>
Full-length DEN cDNA clones were constructed by incorporation of full-length DEN cDNA into<br>
plasmid pRS424, wherein said dengue sero-type II (DEN II, NGC) (ATCC#VR-1255) virus and<br>
plasmid pRS424 (ATCC#77105) were obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA.<br>
a) Three DEN cDNA fragments (31-, 5'- and middle cDNA) were produced by PCR with<br>
DEN RNA as template. 5'-cDNA contains an Xbal restriction site and an Sp6 enhancer<br>
sequence at the 5' end. The 3'-cDNA contains a Sacl restriction site at the 3' end. The<br>
middle cDNA contains sequences identical to the 3' end of the 5'-cDNA and the 5' end of<br>
the 3'-cDNA<br>

The resulting three DEN cDNA fragments are 5484 bp, 2530 bp and 2922 bp, respectively, in<br>
length.<br>
b) The 3' cDNA and the 5' cDNA fragments were ligated into plasmid pRS424 practicing<br>
standard methods.<br>
c) Using known methods of homologous recombination in yeast, the middle cDNA fragment was<br>
inserted into the said clone to produce a full-length DEN cDNA clone, pRS/FLD2.<br>
2. Construction of DEN replicon cDNA clones with structural protein gene sequences deleted<br>

(GenBank Accession No. AF038403) (There is a BamHI restriction site in DEN genome).<br>
b) A 96 nt DMA fragment was synthesized by fusion PCR containing 45 bases deriving<br>
from codon 6 to codon 20 of the structural protein at the 5' end, 45 bases deriving from<br>
codon 751 to codon 766 of the structural protein at the 3' end and the BamHI restriction<br>
site in the middle The sequence of the DNA is provided as in SEQ ID NO:5.<br>
c) The linearized pRS/FLD2, 96 nt cDNA fragment and activated yeast were put into yeast<br>
transforming buffer(PEG buffer) and incubated at 30°C for one hour, then the linearized<br>
pRS/FLD2 and 96 nt cDNA fragment can be transformed into yeast automatically. After<br>
culture for two days, the transformed yeast colonies can be seen. Based on<br>
homologous recombination in yeast, the 96 nt cDNA fragment can replace structural<br>
protein sequences (SEQ ID NO:4) to produce DEN replicon cDNA clones with structural<br>
protein sequences deleted. Like recombinant HPV-DEN RNA replicons produced in<br>
Example 3 below, a DEN RNA replicon without structural protein sequences can be<br>
used to produce DEN RNA replicon virus-like particles (VLP) by at least four different<br>
packaging schemes as provided hereinabove, and will be described in Example 4 animal<br>

by electroporation and recombinant HPV-DEN RNA replicons replicate and express E7-E6<br>
protein of HPV.<br>

Example 5<br>
Animal experiments of HPV Vaccine<br>
To examine the immunity of a HPV expressing VLP, the HPV VLP was used to determine any<br>
effect on tumor cells using C57BL/6 mice.<br>
C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with JHU-1 HPV cells as the tumor model, JHU-1 HPV cells<br>
contained E6 and E7 oncogenes of HPV. Eight-week-old mice were inoculated in the flank with<br>
500 ul PBS buffer containing 105 JHU-1 HPV cells. JHU-1 HPV cells can completely induce<br>
solid tumors. Seven days after inoculation of JHU-1 HPV cells, tumors could be felt. After<br>
fourteen days, the tumors could reach over 6 mm in diameter.<br>
Rx of HPV VLP: Four groups of eight C57BL/6 mice<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
PFU = Infectious Particle of HPV replicon-containing VLP<br>
Groups 2 and 3 of eight mice each were inoculated in the flank with 105 JHU-1 HPV cells. After<br>
fourteen days, groups 3 and 4 of eight mice each were inoculated ip with 107 PFU HPV-VLP<br>
and after seven days they were inoculated with 107 PFU HPV-VLP again.<br>
1. To examine immunity of HPV VLP:<br>
a) After inoculation of mice with JHU-1 HPV cells, tumor growth and sizes were examined<br>
every two days.<br>
b) An HPV E6/E7-specific CD8+ T cell assay was used to examine the cells by cytoplasm<br>
staining and flow cytometry. After the second inoculation of group 4 mice with HPVVPL,<br>
spleen cells were separated and used for staining with fluorescence-IFN-K and<br>
TNF-a antibodies. Stained cell surface IFN and TNF can be detected with flow<br>
cytometry.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In group 3, after inoculation of C57BL/6 mice with 105 JHU-HPV for fourteen days, tumors were<br>
induced, as expected. The tumor bumps sometimes were larger than 6 mm in diameter. Then<br>
those mice were inoculated ip with 107 HPV-VPL. After two days it can be seen that most<br>
tumors began to shrink. After first inoculation, after seven days, the mice were inoculated with<br>
107 HPV-VPL again. After two inoculations for one week, tumors in almost half the mice<br>
disappeared. In other mice, the trend was for diminution of tumor size. In group 2, after<br>
inoculation of C57BL/6 mice with 105 JHU-HPV for thirty-five days, tumors of 75% of the mice<br>
were larger than 25mm.<br>
b) The effects of HPV VLP on E6-E7-specific CD8+ T cells<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The effects of the HPV VPL on E6-E7-specific CDa+ T cells were examined by cytoplasm<br>
staining. The HPV VPL induced CD8" T cells to secrete IFN-y and TNF-a.<br>
