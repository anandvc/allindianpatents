				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention discloses a system for cellular mobile telephony. The system<br>
comprises a base station antenna and a plurality of cells, where each cell has a specific<br>
area coverage which is defined by an azimuth coverage and a range coverage.<br>
A first and a second cell in the system cover first and second areas respectively, the areas<br>
being defined by a first and second azimuth and a first and second range respectively.<br>
The first and the second cell are essentially adjacent to each other in azimuth, and the<br>
system also comprises a third cell with a third area coverage which is defined by a third<br>
azimuth coverage and a third range coverage.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In cellular telephony systems, the area covered by the system is, as the name implies,<br>
divided into cells. Usually, the cells are divided along a more or less radial direction,<br>
extending from a centre point where a base station and an antenna associated with the base<br>
station is located.<br>
A user in the system will adaptively be assigned to one or a few of the cells of the system,<br>
usually the cell or cells for which the user's telephone experiences the best signal quality,<br>
typically defined by the signal strength or signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, S/(I+N),<br>
of a broadcast reference signal, for example a pilot signal in a CDMA system. The<br>
adaptivity means that the user is "handed over" from one cell to another depending on the<br>
signal quality of the broadcast reference signals corresponding to the respective cells.<br>
The cells are thus defined by the coverage of the base station antenna or antennas in terms<br>
of a quality measure such a signal strength or S/(I+N). Near the site of the base station,<br>
where the borders of the cells converge, there will be a plurality of borders close to each<br>
other, which may lead to very frequent and rapid handovers, which is not desirable, as this<br>
may lead to reductions in communication quality, and in some cases even to dropped<br>
telephone calls.<br>
2<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is thus a need for a cellular telephony system in which the amount of "handovers"<br>
close to the base station could be reduced.<br>
This need is addressed by the present invention in that it discloses a system for cellular<br>
mobile telephony which comprises a base station antenna and a plurality of cells, where<br>
each cell has a specific area coverage defined by an azimuth interval coverage and a range<br>
coverage.<br>
A first and a second cell cover first and second areas respectively, the areas being defined<br>
by a first and second azimuth interval and a first and second range respectively.<br>
The first and second cells are essentially adjacent to each other in azimuth, and the system<br>
also comprises a third cell with a third area coverage defined by a third azimuth interval<br>
coverage and a third range coverage.<br>
According to the invention, the third azimuth coverage interval is essentially the same as,<br>
and coincides with, the total azimuth coverage intervals of the first and the second cell.<br>
However, the third cell has a range coverage which is significantly smaller than the first or<br>
second range coverages, as a result of which, within the third area, essentially all traffic<br>
will be assigned to the third cell.<br>
In practice, this means that in a system of the invention, all users in an area close to the<br>
base station are assigned to the third cell, irrespective of which azimuth direction they are<br>
in. This will naturally reduce the amount of handovers close to the base station, and farther<br>
out from the base station, the problem of frequent and rapid changes in signal quality due<br>
to many cell borders being located close together will be solved by the inherent geometry<br>
of the system, thus providing sufficient time for handover.<br>
Suitably but not necessarily, the range coverage of the first and second cells are essentially<br>
identical.<br>
3<br><br>
The total azimuth coverage of the system, i.e., in this case defined above with the first and<br>
second cells in the system, can be 360 degrees. In such a system however, a larger number<br>
of cells could also be used.<br>
The invention also covers an antenna to be used with the system.<br>

EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig 1 shows a conventional system 100 for cellular telephony. The system 100 will<br>
throughout be described as a CDMA or a WCDMA-system, but it will be appreciated that<br>
the principle of the invention can also be applied to cellular telephony systems which<br>
employ other principles, such as for example the TDMA-principle.<br>
The system 100 is seen in fig 1 in a top view, and is shown in an idealized manner. Thus,<br>
the system comprises a bases station 110, at centre of the system, and the system is shown<br>
as comprising a number of cells, in this case eight cells 101-108.<br>
4<br><br>
In fig 1, the system is shown as a wheel divided by spokes, where the spokes are the<br>
borders between the cells. This is an idealized case, but will serve well to illustrate a basic<br>
principle of the invention.<br>
A user of the system will be assigned to the cell for which the user's telephone terminal<br>
has the best communication with the base station 110. The communications quality is<br>
constantly measured, and if certain criteria are met, the user is "handed over" to another<br>
cell with which the user's telephone terminal has better communication quality.<br>
Looking at user A in fig 1, for example, the cell which user A is assigned to will be cell<br>
101, since user A is located in the centre of that cell and is quite far from the adjoining<br>
cells.<br>
However, it will be realized that for user B the situation is quite different: user B is<br>
relatively close to the base station 110, and can thus be subjected to rather frequent<br>
handovers, since the cell for which user B has the best communications quality will<br>
change quite often, especially if user B moves in a direction which is perpendicular to the<br>
cell borders.<br>
Thus, users who are close to the base station 110 will cause requirements for quite rapid<br>
and frequent handovers. In a less idealized situation than the one shown in fig 1, the<br>
situation can be even worse, since the borders of more than two cells can more or less<br>
converge in one and the same point.<br>
These requirements for rapid and frequent handovers may lead to poor communications<br>
quality, and, in some cases, even to dropped telephone calls.<br>
Fig 2 shows a system 200 according to the invention, seen from the same point of view as<br>
the conventional system 100 shown in fig 1. Again, it should be stressed that fig 2 shows<br>
an idealized system, but the drawing will serve to facilitate the understanding of the<br>
invention.<br>
5<br><br>
As shown in fig 2, the system 200 of the invention comprises all of the cells of the system<br>
100 of fig 1, but it also comprises an additional cell 203 with characteristics that are<br>
slightly different from the other cells 101-108.<br>
The system of the invention will work well with the configuration shown in fig 2, but<br>
other system configurations will also work well. Accordingly, the invention will be<br>
explained in more detail with reference to fig 3, which shows a system 300 in which one<br>
of the principles of the invention is employed.<br>
The system 300 shown in fig 3 comprises a base station antenna 340 and a plurality of<br>
cells, in this case two cells 310, 320. Each of the two cells have a specific area coverage<br>
which is defined by an azimuth interval coverage a1, a2, and a range coverage R0 which<br>
may be the same or different for the two cells.<br>
The two cells 310, 320, are essentially adjacent to each other in azimuth, i.e. their borders<br>
only overlap by a predetermined amount, if at all. The system 300 also comprises a third<br>
cell 330 with a third area coverage which is defined by a third azimuth interval coverage<br>
and a third range coverage.<br>
According to the invention, the third azimuth interval coverage is essentially the same as,<br>
and coincides with, the total azimuth interval coverage a1 + a2 of the first and the second<br>
cell. In other words, the azimuth angle interval covered by the third cell 330 is essentially<br>
the same as the sum of the azimuth interval angles of the two other cells 310, 320.<br>
However, the third cell 330 has a maximum range coverage R' which is significantly<br>
smaller than the first or second range coverage. Within the area covered by the third cell,<br>
all traffic is handled by the third cell, so that the user B, shown again in fig 3, may move<br>
within an area close to the base station antenna 340 and still remain within one and the<br>
same cell 330 which will reduce the amount of handovers required at distances close to the<br>
base station antenna 340.<br>
6<br><br>
As will be shown in more detail later in this description, within the area covered by the<br>
third cell 330, the third cell 330 will dominate with respect to communications quality, e.g.<br>
the received signal strength or S/(I+N) at a user's terminal.<br>
In other words, by means of the invention, a "near cell" is added to the system in order to<br>
handle the traffic within a certain distance from the base station antenna 340. Outside of<br>
the range R' covered by the "near cell" 330, calls will be handled in the way known from<br>
the conventional system 100 shown in fig 1.<br>
Suitably, but not necessarily, the range coverage of the first 310 and second cell 320 are<br>
essentially identical, as shown in fig 3. Also, in order to make it easy to plan for the<br>
system 300, each of the areas covered by the first, second and third cells may be of<br>
essentially the same size.<br>
In the system 300 shown in fig 3, the first and second cells have equal azimuth coverages,<br>
and together cover only a part of the area around the base station antenna. However, the<br>
amount of cells and the coverage can of course be varied, and it would also be conceivable<br>
to let the first and second cells together have an azimuth coverage of 360 degrees.<br>
As for the range coverage R' of the third cell 330, this may of course be designed so as to<br>
be any suitable percentage of Ro, but the third range coverage R0 would in many<br>
applications be at the most half of the smaller of the first and second range coverages.<br>
As mentioned, one of the desired effects of adding the third cell, the "near cell" 330, is for<br>
that cell to dominate with respect to communications quality at distances out to the range<br>
R'. This means that the quality of signals corresponding to the third cell 330 must be<br>
higher than that of cells with which it co-habits, i.e., in the case shown in fig 3 either the<br>
first 310 or the second cell 320, in the conventional manner of a cellular communications<br>
system. Similarly, at distances beyond R', the opposite must be true, in other words the<br>
first or the second cell must dominate at those distances.<br>
7<br><br>
Fig 4 shows a side view (as opposed to fig 3, which is a top view) of the main beam<br>
pattern representing the effective power density of an example of a radiation pattern which<br>
could be suitable in order to achieve the desired result.<br>
In this case, the view is one of an imagined cross section through cells 330 and 310, but a<br>
similar pattern would be seen in a cross section through Cells 320 and 330: A first beam<br>
B(310) is intended to cover the first cell 310, and a second beam, B(330), is intended to<br>
cover the third cell 330. The radiation pattern B(310) of the first cell 310 is shown with<br>
dashed lines, and the radiation pattern B(330) of the "near cell" 330 is shown with solid<br>
lines.<br>
Also indicated in the drawing is a Radio Base Station (RBS) with the antenna(s) in<br>
question, as well as ground level, indicated by a symbolic person.<br>
As can be seen, the first beam B(310) will provide a higher effective power density for a<br>
specific elevation angle range corresponding to a particular range, which in this case will<br>
be the distance R' that is defined as the range coverage of the "near cell" 330. Within that<br>
distance, the beam B(330) of the near cell 330 will be the stronger, which will lead to the<br>
desired effect: telephone terminals at a distance closer than R' to the base station antenna<br>
will have their traffic handled by the "near cell" 330, and telephone terminals beyond that<br>
distance will have their traffic handled by the first cell 310.<br>
The beams are illustrated in such a way as to represent the absolute or relative effective<br>
power density of radiated signals, e.g. the product between radiated power and antenna<br>
gain. Thus, a greater beam pattern radius represents higher power density.<br>
The radiation pattern B(330) shown in fig 4 is one which has a main beam with an upper<br>
and a lower elevational angle which delimit the main beam. It should be pointed out that in<br>
fig 4, not only the main beams are shown, both beams are shown as having a number of<br>
side lobes associated with them.<br>
8<br><br>
In general, regardless of the kind of antenna used, this is one of the principles of the<br>
invention: the "near cell" is equipped with an antenna which out to a predefined distance<br>
R' from the base station antenna will be perceived by the terminals as dominant, at least at<br>
ground level and close to ground level. Beyond this distance, the beams of the "traditional<br>
cells" will be perceived as dominant, and will thus handle the traffic within their<br>
respective borders.<br>
Fig 5 shows a first embodiment of an antenna 500 which may be used to generate the<br>
desired radiation patterns: the antenna 500 is an array antenna, in this case a cylindrical<br>
array antenna. In this context, the term cylindrical is used as a generic term for antennas<br>
with an essentially fixed cross-sectional shape, intended to also include antennas with a<br>
mechanical shape which is not perfectly circular, such as hexagonal, or as shown in fig 6,<br>
octagonal.<br>
The array antenna 500 is equipped with a number of columns 521 - 528, preferably but<br>
not necessarily arranged equidistantly around the circumference of the octagon 500. Each<br>
column comprises a number of radiation elements, 5211-521N - 528I-528N, arranged<br>
longitudinally in the direction of the cylinder axis.<br>
The radiation elements 5211-521N - 5281-528N, can be used to generate radiation patterns<br>
or beams which will cover the first and second areas in the mobile telephony system<br>
described above. With the antenna shown in fig 5, an azimuth angle of 360 degrees can be<br>
covered, within which up to eight cells can be covered.<br>
According to the invention, the antenna 500, apart from the radiation elements of the<br>
columns 521-528 also comprises a separate set of columns 521'-528' arranged around the<br>
circumference of the cylinder, each of which column comprises at least one radiation<br>
element.<br>
This separate set of columns 521'-528' can generate a radiation pattern which will cover<br>
the third area in the mobile telephony system. The word "separate" as used here does not<br>
necessarily mean that the separate set of columns needs to be mechanically separated from<br>
9<br><br>
the other columns as shown in fig 5, it is also possible to use one or more of the radiation<br>
elements in the existing columns for this purpose .<br>
However, the antenna 500 shown in fig 5 comprises an extra set of columns 521'-528',<br>
each column having at least one radiation element, with the extra set of columns for<br>
example arranged below or above the other set of columns, "below" and "above" here<br>
being used in as referring to the direction that the antenna is intended to be used in the<br>
cellular telephony system.<br>
The use of the columns 521-528 or radiation elements which is to be used to generate the<br>
traditional cells will not be elaborated upon here, since that is a technique which is well<br>
known to those skilled in the field.<br>
However, the separate set of columns 521'-528' which is used to generate the omni-<br>
coverage of the near cell described above can be achieved in the following manner: all of<br>
the elements in the columns 521'-528' could be connected in phase with a corporate feed<br>
network. This would generate an omni-directional beam in azimuth, with close to uniform<br>
amplitude, and a broad vertical beam. As an alternative or option, in order to improve the<br>
"near-zone" coverage, the elements of the extra or separate columns could be<br>
mechanically tilted downward.<br>
Fig 6 shows a second embodiment 600 of an antenna which can be used in the telephony<br>
system of the invention. Since the antenna 600 is a version of the antenna 500 of fig 5,<br>
reference numerals are only shown for those parts which have not been given reference<br>
numerals in fig 5.<br>
In the antenna 600, at least one of the columns 621'-628' comprises two radiation<br>
elements, although more elements in each column can be envisioned.<br>
Another way of describing the antennas of figs 5 or 6 is that the conventional antenna has<br>
been equipped with an additional ring 521'-528', 62T-628', of radiation elements.<br>
10<br><br>
One advantage of the antenna 600 as compared to the antenna 500 is that the use of two<br>
radiation elements in one or more of the "extra" columns makes it possible to tilt the beam<br>
of the near cell generated by such columns downwards electrically:<br>
By feeding each set of antenna elements in a particular column 621'-628' with a separate<br>
vertical phase-matched feed network, the vertical elements can be made to generate a<br>
phase-steered down-tilted beam. By again connecting all of the extra columns in phase<br>
with a corporate feed network, an omni-directional beam is obtained with close to uniform<br>
amplitude in the azimuth direction and a vertical beam with its beam width given by the<br>
amplitude and phase-relations of the vertical feed network and element patterns of the<br>
antennas in the extra rings.<br>
In addition to the configurations which have been shown in fig 5 and fig 6, more general<br>
antenna configurations can be envisioned in which each of the columns 621'-628' have<br>
one or more elements, the number of which is individually defined for each separate<br>
column.<br>
Fig 7 shows a third embodiment 700 of an antenna which may be used in a cellular<br>
telephony system according to the invention:<br>
The antenna 700, in similarity to the antennas shown previously, has a first and a second<br>
plurality of radiation elements, both of which in this case however are connected to a two-<br>
dimensional beam forming network, by means of which a plurality of beams or radiation<br>
diagrams can be generated in both azimuth and elevation. By means of the antenna 700,<br>
separate beams may thus be formed for each of the relevant areas or cells, such as, for<br>
example, the first, second and third areas in the cellular telephony system shown in the<br>
drawings and described above.<br>
Thus, in the antenna 700, as opposed to the antennas 500 and 600, there is no need for<br>
"dedicated" radiation elements which are used only for the "near cell" or for the<br>
"conventional" cells.<br>
11<br><br>
As indicated in fig 7, in the antenna 700 is a cylindrical array antenna, in this case an<br>
octagon, which, as mentioned, is equipped with beam-forming networks in two<br>
dimensions, both elevation and azimuth, so that a plurality of beams may be formed in<br>
elevation.<br>
As an example, the antenna 700 may feed each individual column with a separate feeder<br>
network, and the signals from the output ports of the vertical feed networks 720 can be<br>
combined using two or more beam-forming networks 730 in azimuth.<br>
By including a calibration network to each antenna element, beam forming could be done<br>
digitally in both vertical and azimuth direction. Calibration could also be implemented on<br>
column-basis only (i.e., between columns, with fixed beam forming networks within the<br>
columns), which would allow azimuth beam forming to be done digitally.<br>
Beam-forming networks (for example Butler matrices) can be applied to one or both of<br>
two orthogonal polarizations (in the case of dual-polarized antenna elements) and can<br>
connect to different numbers of antenna elements in elevation.<br>
Finally, Fig. 8 shows the configuration for a single column in one possible implementation<br>
of the embodiment of Fig 7.<br>
A column of radiating elements 801 is fed using one corporate beam forming feed network<br>
(BF) 802 for the upper half of column 801 and one Butler matrix feed network (BM) 903<br>
for the lower half of column 801.<br>
The input port of the corporate beam forming feed network 802 and the input port<br>
corresponding to a desired linear phase front over the output ports of Butler matrix feed<br>
network 803 are connected with a power divider 806 to generate a narrow main beam for<br>
far coverage when fed from a common beam port 804.<br>
One input port 805 of the Butler matrix feed network 803 corresponding to a linear phase<br>
front over the Butler matrix output ports 811-814 is used to produce the near coverage<br>
12<br><br>
beam. Since the Butler matrix feeds only half of the column of radiating elements 801, the<br>
near coverage beam fed from input port 805 of the Butler matrix is wider than the far<br>
coverage beam fed using beam port 804.<br>
The invention is not limited to the examples of embodiments shown, but may be freely<br>
varied within the scope of the appended claims. Variations which may be envisioned are,<br>
for example, a system in which more than one "near cell" are employed to cover a certain<br>
azimuth interval. Such multiple "near cells" would thus be basically adjacent in azimuth,<br>
and have more or less similar range coverages.<br>
Also, the number of far cells which are complemented by "near cells" need naturally not<br>
be limited to the numbers described above and shown in the drawings, but may be varied<br>
freely within the limits of the system..<br>

WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A system (200) for cellular mobile telephony, the system comprising a base station<br>
antenna (500, 600, 700) and a plurality of cells (203, 310, 320, 330), each cell having a<br>
specific area coverage defined by an azimuth   interval coverage (a1, a2) and a range<br>
coverage (R0, R'), in which system a first (310) and a second (320) cell cover first and<br>
second areas respectively, said areas being defined by a first (a1) and second (a2) azimuth<br>
interval and a first and second range (R0) respectively, the first and second cells being<br>
essentially adjacent to each other in azimuth, the system also comprising a third cell (203,<br>
330) with a third area coverage defined by a third azimuth interval coverage and a third<br>
range coverage (R'), the system being characterized in that said third azimuth interval<br>
coverage is essentially the same as, and coinciding with, the total azimuth interval<br>
coverage of the first and the second cell, but with the third cell having a range coverage<br>
which is significantly smaller than the first or second range coverages, the system further<br>
being characterized in that within the third area essentially all traffic is handled by the<br>
third cell.<br>
2.	The system of claim 1, in which the range coverage (Ro) of the first and second cells are<br>
essentially identical.<br>
3.	The system of any of claims 1-2, in which each of the first (310), second (320) and third<br>
(330) cells areas are of essentially the same size.<br>
4.	The system of any of claims 1-3, in which system the first and second cells together<br>
have an azimuth interval coverage of 360 degrees.<br>
5.	The system of any of claims 1-4, in which the third range coverage (R') is half of the<br>
smaller of the first and second range coverages (R0).<br>
6.	An array antenna (500, 600, 700) comprising a plurality of radiation elements, the<br>
antenna being intended for use in the mobile telephony system of any of claims 1-5, the<br>
array antenna comprising a first plurality of radiation elements (5211-528N) which can<br>
14<br><br>
generate a radiation pattern which cover the first (310) and second (320) areas in the<br>
mobile telephony system, the antenna further comprising a second plurality (521-528') of<br>
radiation elements which can generate a radiation pattern to cover the third area (330) in<br>
the mobile telephony system, the array antenna being characterized in that it is a<br>
cylindrical array antenna in which said first plurality of radiation elements comprises a<br>
number of antenna elements arranged in columns (521-528) around the circumference of<br>
the cylinder, and in that the second plurality of radiation elements is arranged in a separate<br>
set of columns (521'- 528') arranged around the circumference of the cylinder, each of<br>
which column comprises at least one radiation element.<br>
7.	The antenna of claim 6, in which at least one of the columns (621-628') in the second<br>
plurality of radiation elements comprises at least two radiation elements.<br>
8.	The antenna of claim 6 or 7, in which the second plurality of radiation elements<br>
comprises antenna elements which are mechanically tilted so as to achieve a radiation<br>
diagram which decreases their coverage in the first and second areas.<br>
9.	The antenna of claim 6 or 7, in which the second plurality of radiation elements is fed<br>
via a common feed network.<br><br>
10.	The antenna of claim 7, in which each set of antenna elements in each column is<br>
arranged to be fed with separate vertical phase-matched feed networks.<br>
11.	The antenna of claim 6, in which both the first and the second pluralities of radiation<br>
elements are connected to a two-dimensional beam forming network, by means of which a<br>
plurality of beams or radiation diagrams can be created in both azimuth and elevation, so<br>
that separate beams may be formed for each of said first, second and third areas in the<br>
cellular telephony system.<br><br>
15<br><br>
The invention discloses a system (200) for cellular mobile telephony, comprising a base<br>
station antenna (500, 600, 700) and a plurality of cells (203, 310, 320, 330). Each cell has<br>
an area defined by an azimuth (α1, α2) and a range (R0, R'), and the first (310) and second<br>
(320) cell cover respective areas, said areas being defined by first (α1) and second (α2)<br>
azimuths and first and second ranges (R0) respectively. The first and second cells are<br>
essentially adjacent to each other in azimuth, and the system also comprises a third cell<br>
(203, 330) with an area coverage defined by a third azimuth and a third range (R'). The<br>
third azimuth is essentially the same as, and coinciding with, the total azimuths of the first<br>
and the second cell, but the third cell has a range coverage which is much smaller than the<br>
first or second range coverages.<br></td>
