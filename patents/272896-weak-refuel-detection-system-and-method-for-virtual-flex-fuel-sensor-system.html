				<td>WEAK REFUEL DETECTION SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR VIRTUAL<br>
FLEX FUEL SENSOR SYSTEM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/969,297, filed on August 31, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates generally to vehicle fuel control,<br>
and more particularly to a system and method for estimating fuel composition in a<br>
vehicle fuel tank.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Closed loop fuel control systems are commonly used in<br>
gasoline-powered vehicles to maintain an operating air-fuel (A/F) ratio at<br>
stoichiometry. Stoichiometric values, however, can vary with fuel composition.<br>
For example, when fuel is added to a vehicle fuel tank, it mixes with fuel already<br>
in the tank. For example, ethanol or gasohol in varying mixtures can be added to<br>
gasoline already in the tank. If the added fuel has a different composition from<br>
that of the fuel already in the tank, the engine of the vehicle may need to operate<br>
at a different stoichiometric value after the refueling. Currently manufactured<br>
vehicles may include a hardware sensor that senses and communicates ethanol<br>
content in fuel to other systems in the vehicle.<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0004] The present disclosure, in one implementation, is directed to a<br>
method of estimating composition of fuel in the fuel tank of a vehicle. A refuel<br>
event is detected. A determination is made whether a volume of fuel added to<br>
the fuel tank satisfies a first threshold. A fuel composition estimation is<br>
suspended if the refuel event satisfies the first threshold. A total volume of fuel is<br>
accumulated based on a plurality of refuel events satisfying the first threshold. A<br>
new fuel composition is estimated based on the accumulated total volume of fuel<br>
satisfying a second threshold.<br>
[0005] According to other implementations, a fuel volume change is<br>
calculated. A percent change in fuel volume is calculated. The refuel event is<br>
determined based on the calculated fuel volume change, the percent change in<br>
fuel volume and the accumulated total weak volume of fuel.<br>
[0006] Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
exemplary embodiments of the disclosure, are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0013] The following description of various embodiments of the present<br>
disclosure is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the<br>
disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference<br>
numbers will be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used<br>
herein, the term module and/or device refers to an application specific integrated<br>
circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and<br>
memory that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a<br>
combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the<br>
described functionality.<br>
 <br>
[0014] The present disclosure, in one implementation, is directed to a<br>
method of estimating fuel composition, e.g., relative amounts of ethanol and<br>
gasoline, in a vehicle fuel tank. Generally, when a vehicle is refueled, a transition<br>
between existing and new fuel compositions happens at a nominally fixed rate<br>
when measured as a function of fuel consumed. Changes in fuel composition<br>
thus can be distinguished from fuel system faults, which generally happen either<br>
suddenly or very slowly. A slow fuel system fault may arise, for example,<br>
because of component aging. It is unlikely that a fuel system fault, when<br>
measured relative to fuel consumed, would occur at exactly the same rate as a<br>
fuel transition. The present disclosure is further directed to a method of<br>
determining when a weak refuel event has occurred. A weak refuel event<br>
generally can be a refuel event resulting in a volume of fuel being added to the<br>
vehicle fuel tank that has a volume less than a threshold. The threshold can<br>
correspond to any suitable volume of fuel such as two gallons for example. The<br>
method can suspend a fuel composition estimation when a weak refuel event has<br>
been detected. The method also can sum a series of weak refuel events. When<br>
the summed volume satisfies a threshold, a fuel composition can be determined.<br>
[0015] Referring now to FIG. 1, a vehicle including a fuel composition<br>
estimation system that detects weak refuel events in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present disclosure is indicated generally by reference number<br>
20. The vehicle 20 may be fueled with gasoline and/or ethanol in various<br>
percentages. Fuels appropriate for the vehicle 20 include but are not limited to<br>
gasoline, E85 (an alcohol fuel mixture that typically contains a mixture of up to<br>
 <br>
85% denatured fuel ethanol and gasoline or other hydrocarbon by volume), and<br>
"gasohol", which may include 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol as<br>
known in the art. Fuel is delivered to an engine 22 from a fuel tank 26 through a<br>
fuel line 28 and through a plurality of fuel injectors 32. A fuel sensor 30 senses a<br>
level of fuel in the tank 26 and communicates the fuel level to a control module<br>
42. Air is delivered to the engine 22 through an intake manifold 34.<br>
[0016] An electronic throttle controller (ETC) 36 adjusts a throttle plate<br>
38 that is located adjacent to an inlet of the intake manifold 34 based upon a<br>
position of an accelerator pedal 40 and a throttle control algorithm that is<br>
executed by the control module 42. In controlling operation of the vehicle 20, the<br>
control module 42 may use a sensor signal 44 indicating pressure in the intake<br>
manifold 34. The control module 42 also may use a sensor signal 46 indicating<br>
mass air flow entering the intake manifold 34 past the throttle plate 38, a signal<br>
48 indicating air temperature in the intake manifold 34, and a throttle position<br>
sensor signal 50 indicating an amount of opening of the throttle plate 38.<br>
[0017] The engine 22 includes a plurality of cylinders 52 arranged in<br>
one or more cylinder banks 56. The cylinders 52 receive fuel from the fuel<br>
injectors 32 where it undergoes combustion in order to drive a crankshaft 58.<br>
Vapor from the fuel tank 26 can be collected in a charcoal storage canister 60.<br>
The canister 60 may be vented to air through a vent valve 62. The canister 60<br>
may be purged through a purge valve 64. When vapor is purged from the<br>
canister 60, it is delivered to the intake manifold 34 and burned in the engine<br>
cylinders 52. The control module 42 controls operation of the vent valve 62,<br>
 <br>
purge valve 64, fuel injectors 32 and ignition system 54. The control module 42<br>
also is connected with an accelerator pedal sensor 66 that senses a position of<br>
the accelerator pedal 40 and sends a signal representative of the pedal position<br>
to the control module 42.<br>
[0018] A catalytic converter 68 receives exhaust from the engine 22<br>
through an exhaust manifold 70. Each of a pair of exhaust sensors 72, e.g.,<br>
oxygen sensors, is associated with a corresponding cylinder bank 56. The<br>
oxygen sensors 72 sense exhaust in the manifold 70 and deliver signals to the<br>
control module 42 indicative of whether the exhaust is lean or rich. The signal<br>
output of the oxygen sensors 72 is used by the control module 42 as feedback in<br>
a closed-loop manner to regulate fuel delivery to each cylinder bank 56, e.g., via<br>
fuel injectors 32. It should be noted that configurations of the present disclosure<br>
are also contemplated for use in relation to vehicles having a single bank of<br>
cylinders and/or a single exhaust manifold oxygen sensor.<br>
[0019] In some implementations, the sensors 72 are switch-type<br>
oxygen sensors as known in the art. The control module 42 may use the sensor<br>
72 feedback to drive an actual air-fuel ratio to a desired value, usually around a<br>
stoichiometric value. A plurality of predefined engine operating regions are<br>
referred to by the control module 42 in controlling fuel delivery to the engine 22.<br>
Operating regions may be defined, for example, based on speed and/or load of<br>
the engine 22. The control module 42 may perform control functions that vary<br>
dependent on which operating region of the vehicle is currently active.<br>
 <br>
[0020] Fuel, air and/or re-circulated exhaust to the engine 22 may be<br>
adjusted, i.e., trimmed, to correct for deviations from a desired air-fuel ratio. Trim<br>
values used to make such corrections may be stored in control module 42<br>
memory locations corresponding to a plurality of predefined closed loop air-fuel<br>
ratio control cells (also referred to as sub-regions) associated with the operating<br>
regions of the vehicle 20. Cell values are used to provide closed-loop fuel, air<br>
and/or re-circulated exhaust control. For example, long-term multipliers (LTMs)<br>
may be used to provide long-term corrections to fuel commands to the engine 22<br>
in response to changing engine conditions. LTMs typically are stored in a<br>
memory lookup table in non-volatile memory. The control module 42 adjusts<br>
LTMs periodically in accordance with a long-term time period, e.g., using a period<br>
that is longer than 1 second such as ten seconds. Such adjustment may be<br>
referred to as "long-term learning".<br>
[0021] Additionally or alternatively, short-term integrators (STIs) may<br>
be used to provide short-term corrections to fuel commands to the engine 22 in<br>
response to engine conditions. The control module 42 adjusts STIs periodically<br>
in accordance with a short-term time period, e.g., using a period that is less than<br>
one second such as every 6.25 milliseconds. Such adjustment may be referred<br>
to as "short-term learning". An STI may be stored in volatile memory and may be<br>
adjusted based on an active cell LTM and a signal of the oxygen sensor 72.<br>
[0022] In accordance with one implementation of the present<br>
disclosure, the control module 42 maintains a fuel trim memory structure (such<br>
as a lookup table for example) for use in estimating fuel composition. A plurality<br>
 <br>
of closed loop correction ("CLC") cells can be associated with each cylinder bank<br>
56. For example, eight cells may be provided for each bank 56. CLC cells are<br>
defined based on mass air flow to the engine 22 and may be used to record a<br>
total closed-loop fuel trim of the engine 22 at various operating conditions. The<br>
control module 42 stores baseline closed loop correction values for the engine<br>
operating regions in the CLC cells. Baseline CLC values may be updated when<br>
purge is commanded off as further described below. The baseline CLC values<br>
provide a basis for determining new fuel/air estimates.<br>
[0023] CLC cell values are stored in non-volatile memory. A CLC<br>
value is obtained by multiplying LTM and STI corrections for an active closed-<br>
loop fuel control cell. In other configurations, CLC values may be combined in<br>
other ways. For example, a CLC value may be obtained in another configuration<br>
by adding LTM and STI corrections for an active closed-loop fuel control cell. In<br>
the present configuration, the control module 42 uses separate structures for<br>
closed loop fuel control and for fuel composition estimation. The structures are<br>
separate so that the fuel composition estimation structure may remain current<br>
over ignition cycles, even though the closed loop fuel control structure might be<br>
reset upon vehicle system power-up. It should be noted generally that<br>
configurations also are contemplated in which a vehicle control module may use<br>
a single memory structure for both closed loop fuel control and fuel composition<br>
estimation. Further details of a control module that estimates fuel composition<br>
according to the present teachings may be found in commonly owned U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 7,159,623, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
 <br>
[0024] In one implementation as depicted in FIG. 2, the control module<br>
42 can include a weak refuel detection module 80, an accumulated weak refuel<br>
module 82 and a refuel detection module 84.<br>
[0025] A flow diagram of one implantation of the refuel detection<br>
module 80 is indicated generally by reference number 100 in FIG. 3. Control<br>
begins in step 102. In step 104, control determines if a refuel event has been<br>
detected. In one example, a refuel event can be determined based on a fuel<br>
level communicated to the control module 42 from the fuel sensor 30. If a refuel<br>
event has been detected, control determines whether a change in fuel volume is<br>
greater than a threshold T1 in step 108. If a refuel event is not detected, control<br>
ends in step 106. If the change in fuel volume is greater than T1, control<br>
determines if a percent change in fuel volume is less than or equal to a threshold<br>
T2 in step 112. If the fuel volume is not greater than T1, control loops to step<br>
108.<br>
[0026] If the percent change in fuel volume is less than or equal to T2<br>
in step 112, control determines if a weak refuel volume change is less than or<br>
equal to T3 in step 116. If the percent change in fuel volume not less than or<br>
equal to T2 in step 112, control assumes a normal refuel event has occurred and<br>
performs a fuel composition (ethanol concentration) estimation in step 114. If the<br>
weak refuel volume change is less than or equal to T3 in step 116, control<br>
accumulates a weak refuel volume in step 120. If the weak refuel volume<br>
change is not less than or equal to T3 in step 116, control assumes a normal<br>
refuel event has occurred and performs a fuel composition estimate in step 114.<br>
 <br>
[0027] The weak refuel detection module 80 will now be described. In<br>
general, the weak refuel detection module 80 determines if a small volume of fuel<br>
has been added to the fuel tank 26. A flow diagram of one implementation of the<br>
weak refuel detection module 80 is indicated generally by reference number 130<br>
in FIG. 4. Control starts in step 132. The change in fuel volume is compared to<br>
the threshold T1 in step 134. If the change in fuel volume is greater than or<br>
equal to the threshold T1, control determines whether a percent change of fuel<br>
volume is less than or equal to the threshold T2 in step 136. If not, control loops<br>
to step 134. If the percent change of fuel volume is less than or equal to the<br>
threshold T2, control determines whether a weak accumulated volume change<br>
(described later in FIG. 5) is less than or equal to the threshold T3 in step 138. If<br>
the percent change of fuel volume is not less than or equal to the threshold T2,<br>
control assumes a normal refuel event has occurred and performs a fuel<br>
composition estimate in step 139 and loops to step 144. If the weak<br>
accumulated volume change is less than or equal to the threshold T3, control<br>
assumes a weak refuel event has occurred in step 140. If not, control proceeds<br>
to step 139. Control suspends new ethanol concentration estimation in step 142.<br>
Control ends in step 144.<br>
[0028] The accumulated weak fuel calculation module 82 will now be<br>
described. In general, the accumulated weak fuel calculation module 82 sums<br>
sequential volumes of fuel satisfying a weak refuel criteria. A flow diagram of<br>
one implementation of the accumulated weak fuel calculation module 82 is<br>
indicated generally by reference number 150 in Figure 5. Control starts in step<br>
 <br>
152. In step 154, control determines if a weak refuel has been detected. If a<br>
weak refuel has been detected, control sets an accumulated weak fuel volume<br>
equal to an old weak volume plus the new weak fuel volume in step 156. If a<br>
weak refuel event is not detected in step 154, control loops to step 154. Control<br>
ends in step 158.<br>
[0029] Implementations of the foregoing system and method make it<br>
possible to account for very small refuel events (such as less than two gallons) to<br>
estimate not only fuel composition with accuracy, but also to perform closed-loop<br>
fuel control, spark control, system diagnostics and other vehicle functions with<br>
increased accuracy.<br>
[0030] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
