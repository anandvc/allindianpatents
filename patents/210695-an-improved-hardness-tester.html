COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10; Rule 13)<br>
                                                "AN IMPROVED HARDNESS TESTER"<br>
Mandani Pradeep Hira, of 79/B, Government Industrial Estate, Near Ganesh Nagar, Kandivali (West), Mumbai-400 067, State of Maharashtra, India INDIAN,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
This invention relates to "An Improved Hardness Tester. The hardness tester measures the hardness of material such as rubber, plastic and the like material. Various types of the hardness testers are available in the market.<br>
The conventional apparatus consists of a pressure foot which is precision machined and having a flat surface which is provided with a hole through which an indentor point juts out. The indentor point which is generally made of hard alloy steel, is precision machined and projects out from the pressure foot. The indentor point is connected by means of a system of levers and springs to an indicating dial, the indicating dial being marked to read various graduations / divisions (degrees of hardness) of the material being tested. The upward movement of the Indentor point is controlled by a calibrated spring which offers resistance to the movement and thereby indicate the hardness.<br>
Another conventional tester consists of a system having a pin moving in a slot of a disc having an indicator needle. There is a play in the slot therefore the reading is not accurate as it should be.<br>
The hardness of rubber, plastics, etc. is frequently tested as one of the important properties thereof. Conventionally, such hardness was usually tested by the dial gauge system wherein a feeler of the hardness tester was pressed against the test material, the displacement of the feeler being converted into an amount of rotation, for example, with the aid of a spring unit and rack-and-pinion unit, thereby enabling the operator to measure the hardness by reading graduations on the dial plate.<br>
These conventional hardness testers are having either very small span of dial or complete round i.e. 360°. the smaller span of dial does not show each degree separately because there is no space for markings, while the one which is having 360° complete circle, 100 on the dial overlaps with 0 after full penetration of the indentor which again is not desirable.<br><br><br>
The conventional testers available in the market has one set of assembly and they are capable of giving only one set of readings i.e. 2.5 mm penetration and different type of assemblies are required for 5 /10 / 25 mm penetration. Therefore two or more type of<br>
testers are required to give different penetrations, (the difference between the assemblies are the same pinion &amp; gears but of different number of teeth).<br>
In view of the above described deficiencies, the invention has for an object to provide only one type of assembly which is capable of giving two different penetrations and it is possible by only adjusting the same assembly by changing the angle of the assembly and spring and not changing any other parts thereof and/or any new tester.<br>
The invention will now be described with respect to the accompanying drawings, wherein:-<br>
Figure - 1 : complete assembly with body<br>
Figure - 2 : complete assembly<br>
Figure - 3 : side view of assembly<br>
Figure - 4 : assembly working - 2.5 mm working showing angle.<br>
Figure - 5 : assembly working - 5.0 mm working showing angle.<br>
Referring to figure 1 &amp; 2, the indentor point (16) is placed exactly at the centre of the pressure foot / base plate (3). the indentor rod (16) passes through a hole in the housing/body (1) which again is tightened with the help of a screw on the length stopper (5) and further passing through the setting screw (17) which is mounted on the locator (18). also spring (15) is mounted which rests on the setting screw (17) from which the indentor (16) passes and is further tightened with the help of a screw on the spring stopper (6) . In figure 2 and 3 the assembly consists of a bracket bottom (20) and a bracket top (9) which are fitted on top of each other with the help of two pillars (25 &amp; 26) which are further tightened with two screws (7 &amp; 8). In between bracket bottom (20) and a bracket top (9) are fitted pinion (2) on which a disc (24) and a hairspring (23) are press fitted also sector (12) riveted to a pivot (22) is fitted on which sector setter<br><br><br>
(21) is tightened with two screws (13 &amp; 14). the whole assembly is tightened with screws (19&amp;27)  to the housing (1).<br>
As shown in figure 4, if the bracket top is fixed in such a way that the corresponding pinion (2) and the sector (12) are fitted an angle of 21 ° + 5° to the indentor (16) is formed and the sector setter (21) is fixed in such a way that an angle of 90 ° + 5 to the indentor is formed, one can measure the hardness of material where the penetration is of 2.5 mm. Now when the indentor (16) is pressed 2.5 mm upwards / inwards the pinion (2) moves from 0 to 100 graduations / divisions on the dial (4) which covers 250° angle.<br>
As shown in figure 5, if the bracket top is fixed in such a way that the corresponding pinion (2) and the sector (12) are fitted an angle of 55° + 5° to the indentor (16) is formed and the sector setter (21) is fixed in such a way that an angle of 105° + 5° to the indentor is formed, one can measure the hardness of material where the penetration is of 5.0 mm. Now when the indentor (16) is pressed 5.0 mm upwards / inwards the pinion (2) moves from 0 to 100 graduations / divisions on the dial (4) which covers 250° angle.<br>
Hence, when the angle of the assembly is shifted at 21° + 5° angle to the indentor the manufacturer of the tester achieves 2.5 mm penetration and when the same assembly is shifted at 55° + 5° angle to the indentor the manufacturer of the tester achieves 5.0 mm penetration keeping 0 to 100 graduations / divisions on the dial at 250° constant.<br>
1.	The dial span can change and can range from 180° to 359°.<br>
2.	Presently the dial span is 0 to 250° geometrical angle covering 0 to 100 graduations / divisions on the dial.<br>
3.	It is possible to decrease and or increase the dial span from 180° to 359° by increasing and or decreasing the angle of the assembly with reference to the indentor greater / lesser than 21°+ 5° or 55°+ 5°.<br><br><br>
