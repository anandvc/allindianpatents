Fungicidal mixtures<br>
The present invention relates to fungicidal mixtures, comprising<br>
A)	the triazolopyrimidine derivative of the formula 1<br><br>
and<br>
B)	carbamates of the formula II<br><br>
in which n is 1 or 2 and X is halogen, Ci-C4-alkyI or Ci-C2-haloalkyl, where the radicals X may be different if n is 2,<br>
in a synergistically effective amount.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to methods for controlling harmful fungi using mixtures of the compounds I and II, to compositions comprising these compounds and to the use of the compounds I and the compounds II for preparing such mixtures.<br>
The compound of the formula I, 5-chloro-7-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)- 6-(2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)-[l,2,4]triazolofl,5-a]-pyrimidine, its preparation and its action against.harmful fungi are known from the literature (WO 98/46607).<br>
Carbamates of the formula II belong to the class of the active ■ strobilurin compounds. Their preparation and their action against harmful fungi are likewise known (WO 93/15046 and WC ?6/01256).<br><br>
Mixtures of triazolopyrimidines with 'strobilurin derivatives are known in a general manner from E?-A 988 790. The compounds I and II are embraced by the general disclosure of this publication; however, neither the triazolopyrimidine of the formula I nor carbamates of the formula II are mentioned in EP-A 988 790.<br>
Mixtures of the carbamates II with other active compounds are likewise known (WO 97/40673, WO 97/'40675, WO 97/40684).<br>
The fungicidal activity of the known mixtures is not always entirely satisfactory. The active triazolopyrimidine compounds known from EP-A 988 790, for example, are of limited suitability for controlling harmful fungi from the classes of the Oo.Tiycetes. The activity of- the carbamates II against Oomycetes  does likewise not meet today's requirements.<br>
It v/as an object of the present invention, with a view to reducing the application rates and broadening the activity spectrum, to provide mixtures which, at a reduced total amount of active compounds applied, have improved activity against harmful fungi, in particular against those from the class of the Oomyrcetes   (synergistic mixtures) .<br>
We have found that this object is achieved By the mixtures defined at the outset. Moreover, we have found that simultaneous, that is joint or separate, application of the compounds I and the compounds II or successive application of the compounds I and the compounds II allows better control of harmful fungi than is possible with the individual compounds.<br>
The mixtures of compounds I and II, or the compounds I and II applied simultaneously, that is jointly or separately, act synergistically and are distinguished by excellent activity against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, in particular from the classes of the Ascomycetes,   Basidiomycetes,   Phycomycetes and Deuteromycetes.   Some of them are systemically effective and can therefore also be used as foliar- and soil-acting fungicides.<br>
They are particularly important for contolling a multitude of fungi on various crop plants, such as cotton, vegetables (for example cucumber, beans, tomatoes,"potatoes and cucurbits), barley, grass, oats, bananas, coffee, corn, fruit plants, rice, rye, soybeans, grapevines, wheat, ornamentals, sugarcane and a large number of seeds.<br><br>
They are particularly suitable for controlling the following phytopathogenic fungi: Blumeria graminis (powdery mildew) on cereals, Erysiphe  cichoracearuxn  and Sphaerotheca   fuliginea  on<br>
cucurbits, Podosphaera   leucotricha  on apples, Uncinula necazor  on grapevines, Puccinia  species on cereals, Rhizoctonia  species on cotton, rice and grass, Ustilago  species on cereals and sugarcane, Venturia  inaequalis  on apples, Bipolaris-  and Drechslera  species on cereals, rice and grass, Septoria nodorum on wheat, Botrytis  cinerea  on strawberries, vegetables, ornamentals and grapevines, Mycosphaerella  species on bananas, peanuts and cereals, Pseudocercosporella  herpotrichoidas  on wheat and barley, Pyricularia  oryzae  on rice, Phytophthora  infestans  on potatoes and tomatoes, Pseudoperonospora  species on cucurbits and hops, Plasmopara  viticola  on grapevines, Altarnarza  species on vegetables and fruit, and also Fusarium-   and Varticillium species.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention are particularly suitable for controlling harmful fungi from the classes of the Oomycatas and expecially Phytophthora   infestans  on various vegetable plants and Plasmopara  viticola  on grapevines.<br>
In addition, they are particularly advantageously suitable for controlling powdery and downy mildew fungi in cereals, vegetables, fruit, ornamentals and grapevines.<br>
Moreover, they can be used in the protection of materials (for example the protection of wood) , for example against Paecilomycas variotii.<br>
The formula II represents in partciular carbamates in which the combination of the substituents corresponds to one row of the table below:<br><br><br><br>
Preference is given to compounds of the formula II in which X is fluorine, chlorine or methyl and is located in the para-position; these compounds are described by the formula Ila:<br><br>
Preference is given to compounds of the formula Ila in which X is fluorine, chlorine, methyl or trifluoromethyl. Particular preference is given to the compounds II-3, II-o, 11-12 and 11-17, in particular II-6 (common name: pyraclostrobin).<br>
Owing to the basic character of their nitrogen atoms, the compounds I and II are capable of forming salts or adducts with inorganic or organic acids or with metal ions.<br>
V<br>
Examples of inorganic acids are hydrohalic acids, such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid.<br><br>
Suitable organic acids are, f cr example, formic acid, carbonic acid and alkanoic acids, such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and propionic acid, and also glycolic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid; oxalic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, 1-chenoxybenzoic acid or 2-acetcxybenzoic acid.<br>
Suitable metal ions are in particular the ions c f the elements of the first to eighth transition group, especially chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, and additionally those of the second main group, especially calcium and magnesium, and of one third and fourth main group, in particular aluminum, tin and lead. If appropriate, the metals can be present in the different valencies that they can assume.<br>
When preparing the mixtures, it is preferred to employ the pure active compounds I and II, tc which further active compounds against harmful fungi or against other pests, such as insects, arachnids or nematodes, or else herbicidal of grv.vth-regulating active compounds or fertilizers can be added.<br>
The compounds I and II can be applied simultaneously, that is jointly or separately, or in succession, the sequence, in the case of separate application, generally not having any effect on the result of the control measures.<br>
The compounds I and II are usually applied in a weight ratio of from 100:1 to 1:100, in particular from 20:1 to 1:20, preferably from 10:1 to 1:10.<br>

Here, the application rates of the compound I are from 1 g to<br>
1 kg/ha, preferably from 10 to 900 g/ha, in particular from 20 to<br>
750 g/ha.<br>
Correspondingly, the application rates of the compounds II are from 1 g to 1 kg/ha, preferably from 10 to 750 g/ha, in particular from 20 to 500 g/ha.<br><br>
In the treatment of seed, the application ra:es of the mixture are generally from 0.1 to 1 000 g-'lOO kg of seed, preferably, from 0.1 to 200 g/100 kg, in particular from 1 to 100 g/100 kg.<br>
In the control of phytopathogenic harmful fungi, the separate or joint application of the compounds I and II cr of the mixtures of the compounds I and II is carried out by spraying or dusting the seeds, the plants or the soils before or after sewing of the plants or before or after emergence of the plants.<br>
The fungicidal synergistic mixtures according :c the invention, or the compounds I and II, can be prepared, f:r example, in the form of directly sprayable solutions, powders and suspensions or in the form of highly concentrated aqueous, cily cr other suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, compositions for spreading or granules, and be applied by spraying, atomizing, dusting, broadcasting or watering.

I)  Granules (GR, FG, GG,   MG)<br>
0.5 part by weight of the active compounds is ground finely and associated with 95.5% carriers. Current methods are extrusion, spray-drying or the fluidized bed. This gives granules to be applied undiluted.<br>
J)  ULV solutions (UL)<br>
10 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in an organic solvent, for example xylene. This gives a product to be applied undiluted.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom, for example in the form of directly sprayable solutions, powders, suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dustable products, materials for spreading, or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, spreading or pouring. The use forms depend entirely on the intended purposes; it is intended to ensure in each case the finest possible distribution of the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, pastes or wettable powders (sprayable powders, oil dispersions) by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of a wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. Alternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance, wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and<br><br>
such concentrates are suitable tor dilution with water.<br>
The active compound concentrations in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied within relatively wiie ranges. In general, they are- from 0.0001 tc 10%, preferably from 0.01 to 1%.<br>
The active compounds may also be used successfully in the ultra-low-volume process (ULV), it being possible to apply formulations comprising over 95% by weight of active compound, or even to apply the active compound without additives.<br>
Various types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, herbicides, fungicides, other pesticides, or bactericides may be added to the active compounds, if appropriate just immediately prior to use (tank mix) . These agents can be admixed with the agents according to the invention in a weight ratio of 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
The compounds I or II, the mixtures or the corresponding formulations are applied by treating the harmful fungi, their habitat or the plants, seeds, soils, areas, materials or spaces to be kept free from them with a fungicidally effective amount of the mixture or, in the case of separate application, of the compounds I and II.<br>
Application can be carried out before or after infection by harmful fungi,<br>
Use example<br>
The synergistic action of the mixtures according to the invention was demonstrated by the following experiments:<br>
The active compounds, separately or jointly, were prepared as a 10% emulsion in a mixture of 63% by weight of cyclohexanone and 27% by weight of emulsifier and diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Evaluation was carried out by determining the infected leaf areas in percent. These percentages were converted into efficacies. The efficacy (E) is calculated as follows using Abbot's formula:<br>
E = (1 - a/P)-100<br>
corresponds to the fungicidal infection of the treated plants in % and<br><br>
P   corresponds to the fungicidal infection cf the untreated (control) plants in %<br>
An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that of one untreated control pianos; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants were not■infected.<br>
The expected efficacies of the mixtures of active compounds are determined using Colby's formula [R.S. Colby, '\eeds 15. 20-22 (1967)] and compared with the observed*efficacies .<br>
Colby's formula:<br>
E = x + y - x-y/100<br>
E   expected efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control,<br>
when using the mixture of the active compounds A and B at the concentrations a and b<br>
x   efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using active compound A* at the concentration a<br>
y   efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using active compound B at the concentration b<br>
Use example - Activity against peronospora- of grapevines caused by Plasmopara  viticola<br>
Leaves of potted vines of the cultivar "Muller-Thurgau" were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous suspension having the concentration of active compound stated below. The suspension or emulsion was prepared from a stock solution comprising 10% of active compound in a mixture consisting of 7C% of cyclchexanone, 20% of wetting agent and 10% of emulsifier. The next day, the undersides of the leaves were inoculated with an aqueous zoospore suspension of Plasmopara  viticola.   The grapevines were then initially placed in a water-vapor-saturated chamber at 24°C for 48 hours and then in a greenhouse at 20-30°C for 5 days. After this period of time, the plants were again placed in a humid chamber for 16 hours to promote sporangiophore eruption. The extent of the development of the disease on the undersides of the" leaves was then determined visually.<br><br><br>
