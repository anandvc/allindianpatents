FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to a device for lifting ground water, in particular to an improved device for lifting ground water, in particular at remote locations to meet the irrigation requirements.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventionally, single-acting reciprocating pumps are used to extract ground water. A disadvantage of these pumps is that these pumps draw water during alternate strokes but the force is required to be applied to move the piston during upward as well as in downward direction alongwith the weight of rods.<br>
Another disadvantage of the conventional pumps is that the pump is required to be submerged in the ground water to a depth varying from 150 feets to 700 feets.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the above pumps is that discontinuous flow of water is received as the piston draws water only during downward stroke of the piston while the upward stroke is idle.<br>
Further disadvantage of the above pump is that in the case of such pumps the piston assembly is more than 150 feets deep in the cylinder and the piston rod is connected with the drive through iron rod which weighs more than 50 kg depending upon the depth of cylinder, in addition of the weight of piston assembly. Such heavy weight of piston assembly and connecting iron rod  necessitates operation of the pump by a motor, which consumes electricity and inflates the cost of irrigation of the farmers.<br>
2<br><br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an improved device which allows flow of water during upward as well as during downward stroke of the lift-water pump piston.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved device wherein a dead-weight is provided to the device disposed on the opposite side of the piston assembly of the lift-water pump which nullifies the weight of piston assembly a long with rods and thus reduces power requirements vis-a-versa electricity bill of the farmers for lifting ground water for their irrigational needs.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved device which uses a lever means which provides a mechanical advantage and causes the pump to work more efficiently than conventional pumps.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide an improved device which is easy to maintain for the farmers for drawing ground water for their irrigation fields.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an improved device for lifting ground water which can be run by using engine oil in the absence of electricity, in particular at remote locations.<br>
Yet further objection of the present invention is to provide an improved device which can supply more amount of water with lesser power consumption.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuring description.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Fig. - 1 - shows a schematic view of the device according to the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The improved device having the innovated lift-water pump (12) double acting arrangement of the cylinder which provides water during both upward and downward stroke of the piston (11). A balancing means (15) in the form of a<br>
4<br><br>
dead weight is provided on the opposite side of cylinder-piston assembly (10,11) nullifies weight of the piston assembly (10,11) and rod. The pump (12) can be run either by electric motor or oil engine. The Engine or the motor (1) is coupled with a gear box (2) with a gear ratio of 30:1 1 to obtain necessary speed for the unit with higher torque. The motor (1) and gear box (2) are mounted on a skid .- (3) and a lever means (5,8) is attached with the output shaft of the gear box (2). Dead weight (15) is hung on the one end of the lever (5) on the opposite side of the cylinder (120 to neutralize the weight of the piston assembly (10,11) and the rods (9) in the cylinder (12), with the result that force required to operate the pump is minimized. Output shaft of the gear box (2) is coupled with a crank (4) which converts rotary motion of the gear box (2) oscillatory motion of lever (5). The lever (5) is mounted on a pedestal (6). There are two slots (p1,p2) provided in the lever (5) for pins pi and p2. Pin pi is joined with the crank (4) and converts rotary motion of gear box shaft into oscillatory motion of the lever means (5,8). On the opposition side of pin p1 the pin p moves into another slot to convert oscillatory motion of the lever means (5,8) to reciprocating motion of piston (10). Gear box (2) is coupled with the engine (1) and reduces RPM of the engine to suit the requirement of the pump (12) of lesser speed at higher torque.<br>
WORKING QF THE KMPRQYEP PEYKE<br>
This innovative lift-water pump (12) is designed to lift ground water. Conventionally, single acting reciprocating pumps are used in rural areas to extract ground water. The single acting pump draws water during alternate strokes. Also, during both the strokes, force has to be applied to move the piston in upward - downward direction alongwith weight of rods. The new innovative pump overcomes both this lacunas.<br>
5<br><br>
The pump (12) Is submerger in the ground water. The depth of the ground water may range from 150feet to 700 feet.<br>
The motor or engine (1) is kept on the ground. Rotary motion of the motor shaft is converted in reciprocating motion of the rod (9) by using the lever means (5,8). The cylinder (12) is submerged in the ground water. The piston (10) of the cylinder (12) is connected with the rod (9), which provides reciprocating motion to the piston (10,11) of the unit. When the piston (10) moves upward, it creates vacuum in the lower half of the cylinder (12). The inlet (one way) valve (13) of the cylinder opens and water enters into the cylinder (12). Now, as the piston (10) moves download, outlet (one way) valve (14) is opened and the piston (10) forces the water through outlet valve (14) to move out in the outlet pipe. The piston (10) reciprocates at speed of 25 strokes per minute. Continuous strokes raise the water in the outlet pipe and water is received at the outlet. The improved device, continuous flow of water is provided by double acting arrangement of the cylinder of the lift-water pump (12). in the double acting cylinder, when the piston (10) moves downward to pressurize the water in the lower portion, inlet valve on the upper side of the sidewall of the cylinder opens and it allows the water to flow in. So, it can be seen that during the downward stroke of the piston, water under the piston is forced out in the outlet pipe, while above the piston, water is allowed to enter due to vacuum created in the space. Now, during the upward the stroke of the piston, inlet valve in the lower portion of the cylinder opens due to vacuum created as explained earlier, while water above the piston will be forced out into the outlet pipe by the piston, which is moving upward.<br>
Therefore, it can be seen that water is obtained during both-upward and downward stroke of the piston and thus the pump provides continuous flow of water.<br>
6<br><br>
On the other hand, dead (counter) weight (15) on the opposite side of cylinder-piston assembly (10,11) nullifies weight of the piston and rod. Due to this arrangement, motor doesnt have to lift weight of piston and rod. The unit is run either by electric motor or Oil engine.<br>
The motor (1) is coupled with a gearbox (2) with gear ratio of 30:1 (or pulley mechanism) to obtain necessary speed for the unit with higher torque. The motor (1) and Gearbox (2) are mounted on a skid (3) and a lever is attached with the output shaft of the Gearbox (2).<br>
One slot (p1 ,p2) each is provided on both end of the lever (5) as shown in the figure. One slot (P2) hosts pin (16) connected to the rod (9) coming out of cylinder while other slot (p1) hosts pin (7) to convert rotating motion of the motor to oscillatory motion of lever (5).<br>
Dead weight (15) is hung on the one end of the lever (5) on the opposite side of the cylinder (12) to neutralize weight of the piston assembly (10,11) and the rod (9) in the cylinder.<br>
When the motor (1) is started, the pin (4) in the slot (pi) on dead weight side starts moving downward forcing the cylinder side lever (5) to go up due to lever means (5,8).<br>
With movement of lever (5) the piston rod (11) in the cylinder starts upward movement.<br>
$fter completing half a revolution, the crank pin (4) reaches end point of the slot (pi) and starts moving back. The dead weight (15) side lever (5) starts moving downward and in process forces the piston side to move in exactly opposite direction that is upward direction.<br>
Thus, the piston (10) is provided reciprocating motion in the cylinder (12). Due to its double acting arrangement, the pump draws water during both the strokes.<br>
Now, dead weight (15) weight of eth piston assembly balances each other. So, when both the weight are moving in opposite direction, they nullify each other and force required to continue the momentum is much lesser compared to<br>
7<br><br>
conventional pumps. Here, the force required to overcome inertia at the end points is the only force required in addition to force to be exerted on water. Thus, force required to operate the pump is minimized.<br>
