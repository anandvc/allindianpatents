				<td>RANDOM PASSWORD AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY BIOS FOR SECURING<br>
A DATA STORAGE DEVICE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to the field of information processing<br>
systems, and more particularly relates to securing a data storage device within an<br>
information processing system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Computer systems have become widely available to the general public in recent<br>
years. This increase in availability is mainly attributed to lower costs associated with<br>
manufacturing the components of the computer systems. However, in many instances,<br>
a consumer or a business may not have enough capital to purchase a computer or only<br>
needs the computer for a short period of time. In these situations, renting a computer is<br><br>
an attractive option. Instead of paying a large amount of money for a computer and<br>
software, a user pays by the month or by usage.<br>
[0005] However, in some instances, the rental model is abused by the user. For<br>
instance, a user can easily dismantle the rental computer and sell the components of<br>
the system. One component of the rental computer that is in high demand is the hard-<br>
drive. The hard-drive includes valuable, information, software, and the like. The hard-<br>
drive can be taken out the rental computer system giving the user a free operating<br>
system, software, and the like.<br>
[0004] Currently, hard-drives have the ability to be password protected. This ability is<br>
utilized by security systems, which try and protect hard-drives from unauthorized use.<br>
However, the user of the computer system is the one who chooses the password and/or<br>
at least has access to the password. For a rental computer, the hard-drive is still<br>
useable after it is detached from the rental computer.<br>
[0005] Therefore a need exists to overcome the problems with the prior art as<br>
discussed above.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
[0006] In one embodiment of the present invention a method is disclosed. The method<br>
includes automatically generating a set of security data. The security data is stored in<br>
non-volatile memory. The set of security data is also programmed into the data storage<br>
device as a security code.<br><br>
[0007] In another embodiment of the present invention an information processing<br>
system is disclosed. The information processing system comprises a motherboard and<br>
a security data generator. The security data generator is communicatively coupled to<br>
the motherboard and automatically generates at least one set of security data. The<br>
information processing system also includes at least one data storage device that is<br>
communicatively coupled to the motherboard. The data storage device requires a<br>
programmed security code to access data stored therein. The security data generator<br>
programs a security code associated with the set of security data into the at least one<br>
data storage device as a programmed security code.<br>
[00081 In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a computer readable<br>
medium is disclosed. The computer readable medium includes instructions for<br>
automatically generating a set of security data. The security data is stored in non-<br>
volatile memory. The set of security data is also programmed into the data storage<br>
device as a security code.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0013] The present invention as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art could<br>
be produced in hardware or software, or in a combination of hardware and software.<br>
However in one embodiment the invention is implemented in software. The system, or<br>
method, according to the inventive principles as disclosed in connection with the<br>
preferred embodiment, may be produced in a single computer system having separate<br>
elements or means for performing the individual functions or steps described or claimed<br>
or one or more elements or means combining the performance of any of the functions or<br>
steps disclosed or claimed, or may be arranged in a distributed computer system,<br>
interconnected by any suitable means as would be known by one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art.<br><br>
[0014] According to the inventive principles as disclosed in connection with the preferred<br>
embodiment, the invention and the inventive principles are not limited to any particular<br>
kind of computer system but may be used with any genera! purpose computer, as would<br>
be known to one of ordinary skill in the art, arranged to perform the functions described<br>
and the method steps described. The operations of such a computer, as described<br>
above, may be according to a computer program contained on a medium for use in the<br>
operation or control of the computer, as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art. The computer medium, which may be used to hold or contain the computer<br>
program product, may be a fixture of the computer such as an embedded memory or<br>
may be on a transportable medium such as a disk, as would be known to one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0015] The invention is not limited to any particular computer program or logic or<br>
language, or instruction but may be practiced with any such suitable program, logic or<br>
language, or instructions as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Without<br>
limiting the principles of the disclosed invention any such computing system can<br>
include, inter alla, at least a computer readable medium allowing a computer to read<br>
data, instructions, messages or message packets, and other computer readable<br>
information from the computer readable medium. The computer readable medium may<br>
include non-volatile memory, such as ROM, Flash memory, floppy disk, Disk drive<br>
memory, CD-ROM, and other permanent storage. Additionally, a computer readable<br>
medium may include, for example, volatile storage such as RAM, buffers, cache<br>
memory, and network circuits.<br><br>
[0016} Furthermore, the computer readable medium may include computer readable<br>
information in a transitory state medium such as a network link and/or a network<br>
interface, including a wired network or a wireless network that allows a computer to read<br>
such computer readable information. The present invention, according to an<br>
embodiment, overcomes problems with the prior art by providing a more efficient<br>
mechanism for memory copy operations. The present invention allows the processor to<br>
continue executing subsequent instructions during a memory copy operation thereby<br>
avoiding unnecessary processor downtime.<br>
[0017]  Exemplary Information Processing System<br>
[0018} FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a detailed view of an information processing<br>
system 100 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The information<br>
processing system 100 is based upon a suitably configured processing system adapted<br>
to implement the exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Any suitably<br>
configured processing system is similarly able to be used as the information processing<br>
system 100 by embodiments of the present invention, for example, a personal<br>
computer, workstation, notebook computers, handheld computer, personal digital<br>
assistants ("PDAs"), wireless smartphone, or the like. In one embodiment, the<br>
information processing system 100 is a rental system. A rental system is herein defined<br>
as any information processing system that is provided to a user for a specific period of<br>
time in exchange for a fee, wherein the rental system is returned back to the provider<br>
after such time period has expired.<br><br>
[0019] The information processing system 100 includes a motherboard 102. The<br>
mother board 102 has a processor 104 that is connected to a main memory 106 such<br>
as Random Access Memory ("RAM"), mass storage interface 108, terminal interface<br>
110, and network adapter hardware 112. A system bus 114 interconnects these system<br>
components. Although only one processor 104 is illustrated for the motherboard 102,<br>
computer systems with multiple processors can be used equally effectively.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention further incorporate interfaces that each includes<br>
separate, fully programmed microprocessors that are used to off-load processing from<br>
the processor 104.<br>
[0020] Terminal interface 110 is used to directly connect one or more terminals 140 to<br>
the motherboard 102 to provide a user interface to the motherboard 102. These<br>
terminals 140, which are able to be non-intelligent or fully programmable workstations,<br>
are used to allow system administrators and users to communicate with the information<br>
processing system 100. The terminal 140 is also able to consist of user interface and<br>
peripheral devices that are connected to motherboard 102 and controlled by terminal<br>
interface hardware included in the terminal l/F 110 that includes video adapters and<br>
interfaces for keyboards, pointing devices, and the like.<br>
[0021] The network adapter hardware 112 is used to provide an interface to a network<br>
142. Embodiments of the present invention are able to be adapted to work with any<br>
data communications connections including present day analog and/or digital<br>
techniques or via a future networking mechanism. The mass storage interface 108 is<br>
used to connect mass storage devices, such as a removable storage device 116 and a<br><br>
hard disk drive 118 to the information processing system 100 information. The mass<br>
storage interface 1CS, in one embodiment, is an Advanced Technology Attachment<br>
("ATA") controller. One specific type of removable storage device is a computer<br>
readable medium such as a floppy disk driye, which may be used to store data to and<br>
read data from a floppy diskette 120 or CD {not shown). Another type of data storage<br>
device is a data storage device configured to support, for example, NTFS type file<br>
system operations such as the hard disk drive 118. In one embodiment, the hard disk<br>
drive 118 is communicatively coupled to the motherboard 102 by integrated device<br>
electronics/advanced technology attachment packet interface ("IDE/ATAPl') bus 122. It<br>
should be understood that other types of drives such as floppy drives, magnetic tape<br>
drives, optical drives, flash drives, and the like may also be used within the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0022] The main memory 106 comprises an operating system 124 and applications 126.<br>
The operating system 124, in one embodiment, is a suitable multitasking operating<br>
system such as the Linux, UNIX, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 operating<br>
system. Embodiments of the present invention are able to use any other suitable<br>
operating system. Some embodiments of the present invention utilize architectures,<br>
such as an object oriented framework mechanism, that allows instructions of the<br>
components of operating system (not shown) to be executed on any processor 104<br>
located within the information processing system 100. The application(s) 126, for<br>
example, is executing or waiting to be executed within the main memory 106,<br><br>
[0023] Although illustrated as concurrently resident in the main memory 106, it is clear<br>
that respective components of the main memory 106 are not required to be completely<br>
resident in the main memory 106 at all times or even at the same time. In one<br>
embodiment, the information processing system 100 utilizes conventional virtual<br>
addressing mechanisms to allow programs to behave as if they have access to a large,<br>
single storage entity, referred to herein as a computer system memory, instead of<br>
access to multiple, smaller storage entities such as the main memory 106, removable<br>
storage device 116, and hard disk drive 118. Note that the term "computer system<br>
memory" is used herein to generically refer to the entire virtual memory of the<br>
information processing system 100.<br>
[0024] The motherboard 102 also includes a trusted platform module (TPM") 128. The<br>
TPM 128, in one embodiment, automatically generates security data such as a<br>
password 132 for securing a data storage device such as the hard disk drive 118. The<br>
password 132 is automatically generated without any interaction from a user of the<br>
information processing system 100. In one embodiment, the TPM 128 comprises a<br>
password generator 130 such as a random key generator for generating the password<br>
132. For illustrative purposes only, the remaining discussion refers to the security data<br>
generated by the TPM 128 as a password. It should be noted that using a TPM 128 is<br>
only one example of generating security data. Alternative embodiments of the present<br>
invention generate the hard drive password 132 in, for example, the CPU 104, or in an<br>
external test fixture (not show) that is connected to the bus 114 during manufacturing<br>
and/or test. A TPM 128 allows for a more secure environment when generating security<br><br>
data. In another embodiment, a random number generator is used without the TPM 128<br>
to generate security data. It should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
that any mechanism for generating security data can be used within the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0025] The password 132, in one embodiment, is automatically generated during the<br>
manufacturing process of the information processing system 100. For example, during<br>
the configuration stage of manufacturing, the information processing system 100 is<br>
booted for the first time. A basic input/output system ("BIOS") 136, which includes a<br>
password checker 138 in one embodiment, determines if a hard drive password 132<br>
has been stored. An exemplary embodiment of the present invention stores the hard<br>
drive password 132 with a checksum value that is checked to determine if a valid hard<br>
drive password 132 has been stored. Further embodiments may include a flag as an<br>
indication of the presence of a valid hard drive password. Because this is the first time<br>
the system 100 has been initialized, a hard drive password 132 does not exist. In<br>
response to the determination that a valid hard drive password does not exist, the BIOS<br>
136 randomly defines a hard drive password 132 via the TPM 128 and stores the hard<br>
drive password 132, in one embodiment, in non-volatile memory 134 on the<br>
motherboard 102. The non-volatile memory 134 can reside within the TPM 128 or<br>
outside of the TPM 128. Hard drive passwords are able to be stored as an encrypted<br>
representation using either within the TPM 128 or outside the TOM 128, for example,<br>
open key encryption techniques as are known to ordinary practitioners in light of the<br>
present discussion. In one embodiment, the TPM 128 uses a private key to encrypt the<br><br>
hard drive password. Therefore, if the system 100 is compromised and an unauthorized<br>
source locates the hard drive password., the contents of the passv/ord are indiscernible<br>
because of the encryption.<br>
[0026] Once the hard drive password 132 is generated, the hard drive password 132 is<br>
programmed into the hard drive 118. For example, the hard drive password 132 is<br>
stored in the firmware of the hard drive 118 by using an ATA interface command. The<br>
hard drive password can be programmed into the hard drive 118 either in an encrypted<br>
state or in a decrypted state. For example, the hard drive password can be received by<br>
the hard drive 118 either in an encrypted state or decrypted state. If the hard drive<br>
password is received in an encrypted state, further encryption can be performed or the<br>
password can be decrypted and stored in a decrypted state. Alternatively, if the hard<br>
drive password is received in an decrypted state, the password can be encrypted. The<br>
hard drive password 132 is encrypted using any encryption technique as would be well<br>
known to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the present discussion.<br>
[0027] Various embodiments of the present invention store, program and then<br>
subsequently transmit the password, or security data, in different encrypted states. For<br>
example, some embodiments store the password in an encrypted state and then<br>
retrieves and decrypts the stored, password in order to send the decrypted password to<br>
the hard drive to after initialization to authorize access to the drive. Other embodiments<br>
store the randomly defined password in an unencrypted state and then encrypt the<br>
password to produce the security data that is programmed into the hard drive. These<br>
embodiments then encrypt the stored password again after each hard drive initialization<br><br>
to authorize access to the hard drive. Further embodiments of the present invention<br>
utilize yet further storage protection, encryption, and security techniques to obscure and<br>
protect the security data that is required to authorize access to the hard drive.<br>
[0028] The hard drive password generating process in this exemplary embodiment is<br>
transparent to the user and the hard drive password 132 is never made available to the<br>
user and remains inaccessible to the user. In other words, the password generation<br>
process is completely independent of a user. In one embodiment, only the BIOS 136<br>
and the hard drive 118 retain representations of the hard drive password 132.<br>
[0029] In another embodiment, the BIOS 136 receives an explicit instruction via a<br>
network 142, computer readable medium, or any other mechanism capable of passing<br>
an instruction to the BIOS 136 to generate a hard drive password 132. Also, the hard<br>
drive password generation process does not need to be performed during the<br>
manufacturing of the information processing system 100. For example, the BIOS 136<br>
can be programmed to generate the hard drive password 132 at any point in time such<br>
as after a predefined number of hard drive initializations. In another embodiment the<br>
BIOS 136 receives an instruction to generate the hard drive password 132 but does not<br>
program the hard drive password 132 into the hard-drive until some later point in time.<br>
One example of when the hard drive password 132 is generated and/or programmed at<br>
a later time is a when used system Is purchased for rental purposes. For example, a<br>
business that rents out computer systems acquires a used personal computer which<br>
has never been setup for hard drive password generation. In further embodiments, the<br>
BIOS  136 is incapable of generating the hard drive password  136.     In  such<br><br>
embodiments, another device, such as an external test fixture, generates the hard drive<br>
password 132.<br>
[0030] Once the hard-drive 118 of the exemplary embodiment is programmed with the<br>
hard drive password 132 it is bound to the motherboard 102. In other words, the hard<br>
drive 118 only operates when coupled to the specific motherboard 102 that also<br>
contains the same the hard drive password 132. If the hard drive 118 is taken out of the<br>
information processing system 100 and inserted into another system (not shown), the<br>
hard drive 118 is inaccessible, e.g. does not allow read/write access to the drive,<br>
thereby deterring theft of components from a rental computer system.<br>
[0031] Although the exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described in<br>
the context of a fully functional computer system, those skilled in the art will appreciate<br>
that embodiments are capable of being distributed as a program product via floppy disk,<br>
e.g. floppy disk 218, CD ROM, or other form of recordable media, or via any type of<br>
electronic transmission mechanism.<br>
{0032] One advantage of the present invention is the automatic generation of a hard<br>
drive password. The hard drive password 132 is generated without any interaction by a<br>
user. The hard drive password 132 is never displayed to a user and is inaccessible to<br>
the user, thereby preventing the user from obtaining the hard drive password 132 and<br>
entering it into another information system. This prevents a user from overriding the<br>
security protection of the hard drive. Another advantage of the present invention is that<br>
the hard drive 118 is bound to the motherboard 102 that stores a representation of the<br><br>
hard drive password 132 in its firmware. Therefore, the data stored on the hard drive<br>
118 is inaccessible if the hard drive 118 is coupled to another motherboard, thereby<br>
deterring theft of the hard drive 118.<br>
[0033] Exemplary Process for Automatically Generating A Hard Drive Password<br>
[0034] FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary process of automatically generating a hard drive<br>
password 132 for binding a hard drive 118 to a motherboard 102. The operational flow<br>
diagram of FIG. 2 begins at step 202 and flows directly to step 204. The information<br>
processing system 100, at step 204, is booted for the first time at the manufacturer.<br>
The information processing system 100, at step 206, determines if an instruction has<br>
been received to set a password for the hard drive 118. For example, the BIOS 136<br>
can be programmed to detect an instruction for setting a password 132. The instruction<br>
for setting a password 132 can be received via a network 142, a computer readable<br>
medium 120, user interface facilities such as a keyboard, and the like. In one<br>
embodiment, the BIOS 136 is programmed to detect a first boot and automatically set<br>
the password 132. If the result of this determination is negative, the information<br>
processing system 100 continues to monitor for an instruction to set a password 132.<br>
For example, the password does not necessarily have to be set at first boot. The<br>
password can be set at any point in time.<br>
[0035] If the result of this determination is positive, a password, at step 208, is<br>
automatically generated by the information processing system 100. For example, the<br>
BIOS 136, in one embodiment, automatically generates the hard drive password 132 via<br><br>
the TPM 128. The hard drive password 132 generating process is transparent to a user<br>
and is performed independent of any user interaction without being accessible to the<br>
user. Aiso, the hard drive password 132, in one embodiment, is generated at a<br>
predefined point in time. For example, the generating process can be performed after a<br>
predefined number of system initializations, when a password binding instruction is<br>
received, and the like. It is advantageous to be able to selectively trigger password<br>
generation and information system to hard drive binding because not all information<br>
processing system are purchased directly from a manufacturer. For example, a used<br>
system can be purchased by a rental company that desires to bind the hard drive 118 to<br>
the system motherboard 102. This allows for the present invention to be implemented<br>
in currently existing systems.<br>
[0036] The hard drive password 132, at step 210, is encrypted. For example, the TPM<br>
128 includes one or more encrypting mechanisms that are used to encrypt the hard<br>
drive password 132. The encrypted hard drive password 132, at step 212, is stored in a<br>
non-volatile memory 134. The hard drive password, at step 214, is programmed into<br>
the hard drive 118. For example, the hard drive password 118 is programmed into the<br>
firmware of the hard drive 118. At this point, the hard drive 118 is bound to the<br>
motherboard 102 and is non-operational is with any other computer system since<br>
another computer system would not have the hard drive password to allow access to<br>
this hard drive 118. It should be noted that in other embodiments of the present<br>
invention, other system components are also bound to the motherboard 102 in a similar<br>
fashion. The control flow then exits at step 216.<br><br>
[0037] Exemplary Process Of Authenticating A Hard Drive<br>
[0038] FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary process of authenticating a hard drive 118 using a<br>
programmed hard drive password 132. The operational flow diagram of FIG. 3 begins<br>
at step 302 and flows directly to step 304. The information processing system 100, at<br>
step 304, boots. For example, the information processing system 100 powers-on,<br>
resets, or the like. The hard drive password 132, at step 306, is retrieved from the non-<br>
volatile memory 134. The hard drive password 132, in one embodiment, is retrieved<br>
after the hard drive 118 is initialized, which does not necessarily have to occur after a<br>
power-on or reset.<br>
[0039] The retrieved hard drive password 132, at step 308, is decrypted. The retrieved<br>
hard drive password 132 is decrypted fn the exemplary embodiment through the use of<br>
TPM 128. The decrypted hard drive password 132 is then sent, at step 310, to the hard<br>
drive 118. The information processing system 100 then determines, at step 312, if the<br>
hard drive accepted the password. For example, the hard drive 118 also has a copy of<br>
the hard drive password 132 and compares the hard drive password 132 received from<br>
the BIOS 136 to its own copy. If the result of this determination is negative, the user, at<br>
step 314, is informed of an error and the hard drive 118 is inaccessible. A negative<br>
result may also indicate that the hard drive 118 is lacking the password. For example,<br>
the original hard drive 118, which was bound to the motherboard 102, may have been<br>
taken out of the information processing system 100 and a new hard drive has been<br>
inserted. The new hard drive does not have the hard drive password 132 so the<br>
received password 132 from the BIOS 136 is rejected. As another example, the hard<br><br>
drive 118 has a different hard drive password than what the BIOS 136 had generated.<br>
Therefore, twc hard drives password do not match and access to the hard drive is<br>
restricted. If the result of this determination at step 312 is positive, access, at step 318,<br>
is granted to the hard drive 118 so that it may be used. The control flow then exits at<br>
step 320.<br>
