DESCRIPTION<br>
AGENT FOR APPLYING TO MUCOSA AND METHOD FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
[0001] Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an agent for applying to mucosa containing a hydrophobic group binding type glycosaminoglycan as an active ingredient, and a method for production thereof, [0002] Background Art<br>
Conventionally, as substances having healing effects on mucosal disorders such as inflammation and lesions, hyaluronic acid which is a representative glycosaminoglycan (hereinafter described as "GAG") has been known (e.g., Patent Document 1).  However, in mucosa in the cornea, oral cavity and nasal cavity, and conjunctiva which contacts with the external world, and mucosa in the urinary bladder, the mucosal surfaces are washed with secretions and excretions such as tear fluid, salivary fluid and urine, and foreign substances are removed.  Thus derivatives of GAG which keep medicinal effects inherent in GAG and exert a high staying property in these mucosal tissues have been demanded. [0003]<br>
Meanwhile, photoreactive hyaluronic acid whose water-solubility has been increased by binding a photocrosslinking group such as cinnamic acid to hyaluronic acid and further giving an alkali treatment thereto has been known (e.g., Patent Document 2).  This photoreactive hyaluronic acid has been provided by binding a photocrosslinking group such as cinnamic acid to hyaluronic acid in order to provide medical materials such as anti-adhesion materials by giving the photocrosslinking,<br><br>
and does not aim at enhancing the staying property in the<br>
mucosal tissue.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
The present invention aims at providing an agent for applying to mucosa, which exerts an excellent staying property and pharmacological effects in mucosa. [0006] Means for Solving the Problem<br>
As a result of an extensive study for solving the above problem, the present inventors have found that "hydrophobic group binding type GAG" obtained by binding a hydrophobic group to GAG via a binding chain can be used as an extremely excellent active ingredient in an agent for applying to mucosa because this GAG keeps healing effects inherent in GAG on mucosal disorders such as inflammation and lesions and exhibits a high staying property when applied thereto, and have completed the present invention, [0007]<br>
The present invention relates to an agent for applying to mucosa which contains glycosaminoglycan (GAG) into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain. [0008] Effects of the Invention<br>
The agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention can exert the persistent healing effect on the mucosal disorder such as inflammation and lesions even by low frequent administration because this can stay at a<br><br>
diseased site for a long period of time by exhibiting high<br>
staying property in the mucosa.<br>

Herein, the term "treatment" includes prevention, control of progression (prevention of deterioration), improvement (reduction) and cure of the mucosal disorder. The "mucosal disorder" means a condition where morphology, properties and functions to be inherent in the mucosa are disordered in some form.  For example, the mucosal disorder can include the conditions such as lesions,<br><br>
defects, erosion, inflammation, ulcers and dryness. [0015]<br>
GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain, which is contained as the active ingredient in the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention can be any GAG as long as the GAG binds the group having hydrophobicity derived from a hydrophobic compound having a water insoluble and oil soluble nature. This hydrophobic group is bound to GAG via the binding chain. As described later, it is not necessary that all constitutive units of GAG bind the hydrophobic groups. [0016] 1) GAG<br>
GAG -in—GAO into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain contained in the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is an acidic polysaccharide having a repeated long chain structure of disaccharide composed of amino sugar and uronic acid (or galactose).  Examples of such GAG include hyaluronic acid, chondroitin, chondroitin sulfate, heparin, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate and keratan sulfate, and among them, hyaluronic acid is preferable.  These GAG may be pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.  Examples of such salts include sodium salts, potassium salts, magnesium salts and calcium salts, and among them, the sodium salt is preferable.  Therefore, it is the most preferable that GAG in the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is sodium hyaluronate. An origin of GAG is not particularly limited, and GAG may be derived from an animal or a microorganism or chemically synthesized.  For example, when using sodium hyaluronate, those derived from cock's comb can be exemplified-  The molecular weight of GAG is not particularly limited, but its weight average molecular weight is preferably 200,000 to 3,000,000, more preferably 500,000 to 2,000,000 and most preferably 600,000 to 1,200,000. When hyaluronic<br><br>
acid or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is<br>
used, its weight average molecular weight is preferably<br>
200,000 to 3,000,000, more preferably 500,000 to 2,000,000<br>
and most preferably 600,000 to 1,200,000.<br>
[0017]<br>
2) Hydrophobic group<br>
The hydrophobic group in GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain contained in the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is any group as long as the hydrophobic group is derived from the compound having the water insoluble and oil soluble nature-  Examples of such a group can include alkyl groups having 2 to 18 carbon atoms, alkenyl groups having 2 to 18 carbon atoms, alkynyl groups having 2 to 18 carbon atoms, aryl groups, heteroaryl groups, arylalkyl groups, arylalkenyl groups, arylalkynyl groups and amino acid groups. [0018]<br>
The alkyl groups having 2 to 18 carbon atoms can include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, t-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, n-heptyl, 5-methylhexyl, 4,4-dimethyl-pentyl, 1,1-dimethyl-pentyl and n-octyl• Among them, the alkyl groups auoh a-o rvbutyl' having 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as n-butyl can be preferably included. [0019]<br>
The alkenyl groups having 2 to 18 carbon atoms can include vinyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, 1-butenyl, 2-methyl-1-propenyl, 1-methyl-1-propenyl, 1-pentenyl, 3-methyl-2-butenyl, 1-heptene-l-yl and 2-heptene-l-yl. Among them, the alkenyl groups &amp;a@h aa 1 butony3*. having 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as 1-butenyl can be preferably included. [0020]<br>
The alkynyl groups having 2 to 18 carbon atoms can include ethynyl, 1-propinyl, 2-propinyl, 1-butynyl, 2-<br><br>
butynyl, 3-butynyl, 1-heptynyl, 2-heptynyl and 3-heptynyl. Among them, the alkynyl groups -t›UGh ao 1 butynyir having 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as 1-butynyl can be preferably included. [0021]<br>
The aryl groups can include groups such as phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl and phenanthryl.<br>
The heteroaryl groups can include groups such as furyl, thionyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, pyrrolyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl and indolyl.<br>
The arylalkyl groups can include groups such as benzyl, phenethyl, naphthylmethyl and naphthylethyl.<br>
The arylalkenyl groups can include groups such as 2-phenyl- ethenyl and p- aminophenylethenyl.<br>
The arylalkynyl groups can include groups such as 2-phenyl- ethynyl and p- aminophenylethynyl. [0022]<br>
The amino acid groups can include groups derived from<br>
aliphatic amino acids such as glycine, alanine and ß-alanine; branched aliphatic amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine and valine; aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine and tyrosine; and heterocyclic amino acids such as tryptophan and histidine• [0023]<br>
These hydrophobic groups may be monosubstituted or polysubstituted with groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, cyano, amino (which may be monosubstituted or disubstituted with the above alkyl), nitro, oxo and alkylcarbonyloxy. [0024]<br>
Among the above hydrophobic groups, aryl groups, arylalkyl groups, arylalkenyl groups and arylalkynyl groups which are the hydrophobic groups containing the aryl group can be preferably included, and the arylalkenyl group and the aryl group substituted with the alkylcarbonyloxy group can be particularly preferably<br><br>
included. As such an arylalkenyl group, it is possible to specifically use phenylethenyl and p-aminophenylethenyl. As the aryl group, it is possible to preferably use the groups such as CH3- (CH2) i-COO-phenyl (wherein 1 represents 0 or an integer of 1 to 18). [0025]<br>
These hydrophobic groups may also have a function such as ultraviolet ray absorption ability due to having a double bond in the hydrophobic group as shown by a functional group such as phenyl-ethenyl exemplified above contained in the hydrophobic group.  For example, when the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is used as eye drops described later, it is possible to make the eye drops having the function effectively absorbing the harmful ultraviolet rays by the use of the group having the ultraviolet ray absorption ability as the hydrophobic group.  Furthermore, for example, when the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is used for the treatment of corneal epithelial layer disorders such as corneal xerosis (dry eye), keratoconjunctivitis, superficial punctate keratitis (SPK), corneal epithelial erosion, corneal epithelial loss and corneal tumor, it is possible to make the agent for applying to mucosa which has pharmacological effects on the above disorders in combination with the function effectively absorbing the harmful ultraviolet rays by the use of the group having the ultraviolet ray absorption ability as the hydrophobic group- As the group having the ultraviolet ray absorption ability, for example, arylalkenyl group having the conjugation double bond which is exemplified by 2-phenyl~ethenyl and p™ aminophenylethenyl described above is preferable. When the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is used for the corneal disorder, it is preferable that "GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced" which is the active ingredient of the agent for applying<br><br>
to mucosa of the present invention is made into an aqueous solution of 0.1% by weight, which blocks 70 to 100% transmission of the ultraviolet rays at a wavelength of 200 to 300 nm when an ultraviolet ray transmittance is measured by the method described in the Example described later.  Such a hydrophobic group having the ultraviolet ray absorption ability can preferably include the arylalkenyl groups such as 2-phenyl-ethenyl and p-aminophenylethenyl-[0026]<br>
3)	Binding chain<br>
In GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain contained in the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention, the above GAG is bound to the above hydrophobic group via the binding chain. GAG has the functional group which is a carboxyl, hydroxyl or sulfonate (-S03H) group as the side chain.  Thus, the hydrophobic group can be bound to GAG via the binding chain obtained by forming an ether bond, carboxylate ester bond, sulfate ester bond, carboxylic acid amide bond or sulfonate amide bond together with these functional groups.  Such a binding chain can specifically include -CONH-, -COO-, -O, -S03- and -S02NH-. Among them, the carboxylic acid amide bond of -CONH- and the carboxylate ester bond of -COO- can be preferably used, and the carboxylic acid amide bond of -CONH- can be particularly preferably used. [0027]<br>
4)	Spacer chain<br>
In GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain contained in the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention, the hydrophobic group is bound to GAG via the above binding chain, and a spacer chain may further exist between the binding chain and the hydrophobic group. As such a spacer chain, any chain group can be used as long as the spacer<br><br>
group does not completely lose the pharmacological effects which GAG has.  Specifically, -(CH2)m- and - (CH2) - (OCH2) n-(wherein m and n are integers of 1 to 18, respectively) can be included.<br>
These spacer chains can further have the binding chains such as -CONH-, -COO-,   -0-, -SO3- and -S02NH- which are the same as above at the hydrophobic group side.  Such a spacer chain having the binding chain at the hydrophobic group side can specifically include -COO-(CH2)m-r ~C00-(CH2)-(OCH2)n-f -CONH- (CH2)m- and -CONH- (CH2) - (OCH2) n-• [0028]<br>
5)	Ratio having hydrophobic group<br>
In GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain contained in the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention, it is not necessary that all of GAG constitutive units respectively have the hydrophobic groups, A ratio of the bound hydrophobic group in molar equivalent relative to a disaccharide repeat unit in molar equivalent of GAG (hereinafter, referred to as an "introduction ratio") can be optionally determined depending on the type of the hydrophobic group, the degree of required hydrophobicity, the type of the mucosal disorder administered with the agent for applying to mucosa and the administration site, etc.  For example, when using a phenylethenyl group which may be substituted as the hydrophobic group, preferably 5 to 30% and more preferably 10 to 20% of a hydrophobic group in molar equivalent is introduced relative to the disaccharide repeat unit in molar equivalent of GAG (in the case where the crosslinking bond described later is not formed). [0029]<br>
6)	Crosslink forming group<br>
In GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain contained in the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention, the<br><br>
hydrophobic group may form a crosslinking bond between GAG molecules by the functional group contained in the group. As the hydrophobic group capable of forming the crosslinking bond, any group can be used as long as the hydrophobic group produces a photodimerization reaction or a photopolymerization reaction by irradiation of ultraviolet rays and is the same as defined above.  The hydrophobic group capable of forming the crosslinking bond includes, for example, phenylethenyl, p-aminophenylethenyl, ethenyl, 2-carboxyethenyl and pentane-1,3-dienyl.  It is desirable that these groups are bound to GAG via the binding chain which contains the carbonyl group. Among these hydrophobic groups, phenylethenyl or p-aminophenylethenyl which is bound to GAG via the binding chain which contains the carbonyl group can be particularly preferably used.<br>
In such GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced capable of forming the crosslinking bond, GAG molecules can be crosslinked with one another by being subjected to the photodimerization reaction or the photopolymerization reaction by standard methods.  For example, according to the methods described in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-249501, the photodimerization reaction or the photopolymerization reaction can be given. [0030] 7) Preferable GAG constitutive unit<br>
Representatives of GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain contained in the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention can specifically include the agents for applying to mucosa containing GAG into which Ph-CH=CH-COO (CH2)m-NHCO-; Ph-CH=CH-COO-CH2- (OCH2) n-NHCO-; Ph-CH-CH-CONH- (CH2) m-NHCO- ; Ph-CH=CH-CONH-CH2-(OCH2)n-NHCO-; Ph-CH=CH-COO- (CH2) m-0-CO-; Ph-CH=CH~COO-CH2- (OCH2) n-0-CO-; Ph~CH=CH-CONH- (CH2) m-0-CO- ; Ph-CH==CH-CONH-CH2-(OCH2)n-O-CO-; CH3-(CH2)i-COO-Ph-CONH-<br><br>
(CH2)irrNHCO- or CH3-(CH2) i-COO«Ph-CONH-CH2-(OCH2) n-NHCO-(wherein Ph represents phenyl group, m and n represent<br>
integers of 1 to 18, respectively, and 1 represents 0 or<br>
an integer of 1 to 18) is introduced, as the active<br>
ingredient.<br>
The following GAG can be included as the<br>
representative -<br>
GAG having the repeat unit of the structural unit<br>
represented by the Chemical formula 1, as a basic<br>
skeleton:<br>
[Chemical formula 1]<br><br>
wherein, R represents Ri or R2;<br>
Ac represents an acetyl group;<br>
Ri represents ONa or OH;<br>
R2 represents (1) Ph-CH=CH-COO- (CH2)m™NH-;<br>
(2)	Ph-CH=CH-COO-CH2- (OCH2)n-NH-;<br>
(3)	Ph~CH=CH-CONH-(CH2)m~NH;<br>
(4)	Ph-CH=CH-CONH-CH2-(OCH2)n-NH-;<br>
(5)	Ph-CH=CH-COO- (CH2) m-0- ;<br>
(6)	Ph-CH=CH-COO-CH2-(OCH2)n-0-; (7 ) Ph-CH=CH-CONH- (CH2) m-0- ;<br>
(8 ) Ph-CH=CH-CONH-CH2- (OCH2) n-0- ;<br>
(9)	CH3-(CH2)i-COO-Ph-CONH-(CH2)m-NH; or<br>
(10)	CH3-(CH2)i-COO-Ph-CONH-CH2»-(OCH2)n-NH-;<br>
wherein, Ph represents phenyl group, m and n represent integers of 1 to 18, respectively, and 1 represents 0 or an integer of 1 to 18, as a basic skeleton, wherein the ratio of the above structural unit wherein R represents R2 is 5 to 30% in molar equivalent relative to the<br><br>
disaccharide repeat unit in molar equivalent of the GAG.<br>
[0031]<br>
8) Method for producing GAG into which hydrophobic group is<br>
introduced via binding chain<br>
To obtain GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain, GAG is reacted with a hydrophobic compound in which the above hydrophobic group has been bound to the functional group such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino or sulfonate group which can form an ether bond, carboxylate ester bond, sulfate ester bond, carboxylic acid amide bond or sulfonate amide bond together with the carboxyl, hydroxyl or sulfonate (-SO3H) group in GAG.  Specifically, when the bond is the carboxylic acid amide bond, GAG having the carboxyl group is reacted with the hydrophobic compound having an amino group to bind the carboxyl group in GAG to the amino group in the hydrophobic compound.  In the case of the carboxylate ester bond, GAG is reacted with the hydrophobic compound having hydroxyl or carboxyl group to bind the carboxyl group in GAG to the hydroxyl group in the hydrophobic compound or bind the hydroxyl group in GAG to the carboxyl group in the hydrophobic compound.  In the case of the ether bond, GAG having the hydroxyl group is reacted with the hydrophobic compound having the hydroxyl group to react the hydroxyl group in GAG with the hydroxyl group in the hydrophobic compound*  In the case of the sulfonate ester bond, GAG is reacted with the hydrophobic compound having the hydroxyl group or sulfonate group to bind the hydroxyl group in GAG to the sulfonate group in the hydrophobic compound or bind the sulfonate group in GAG to the hydroxyl group in the hydrophobic compound. These reactions can be performed by common standard methods, and reaction conditions can be optionally selected by those skilled in the art. [0032]<br>
When the spacer chain is present between the binding<br><br>
chain and the hydrophobic group, the order in introducingthe spacer chain and the hydrophobic group to GAG is not particularly limited.  For example, either the method in which a spacer compound having the functional group such as the hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino or sulfonate group which can form the ether bond, carboxylate ester bond, sulfate ester bond, carboxylic acid amide bond or sulfonate amide bond together with the functional group in GAG at one end of the above spacer chain is reacted with GAG, and subsequently, the other end of the spacer compound is reacted with the hydrophobic compound which is bound to the functional group such as the hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino or sulfonate group, or the method in which the spacer compound having the functional group such as the hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino or sulfonate group which can form an ether bond, carboxylate ester bond, sulfate ester bond, carboxylic acid amide bond or sulfonate amide bond together with the functional group in the hydrophobic compound at one end is reacted with the hydrophobic compound in which the hydrophobic group has been bound to the functional group such as the hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino or sulfonate group, and subsequently the other end of the spacer compound is reacted with GAG may be used.  In particular, the method in which the spacer compound is reacted with the hydrophobic compound followed by being reacted with GAG can be preferably used. [0033]<br>
The above-described method can be appropriately carried out by publicly known methods, and preferably performed in the presence of a condensing agent.  Such a condensing agent can preferably include water soluble carbodiimide such as 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI.HC1), condensing agents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and N-hydroxysuccinate imide (HOSu).  For example, when hyaluronic acid is used as GAG and the cinnamate<br><br>
derivative such as Ph-CH=CH-COO-(CH2)m-NH2 or Ph-CH=CH-COO-CH2-(OCH2) n-NH2 (wherein m and n are integers of 1 to 18, respectively) is used as the hydrophobic compound which is bound to the spacer compound, the condensation method using water soluble carbodiimide such as 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI.HC1) and N-hydroxysuccinate imide can be preferably used.  The reaction can be accomplished using a mixed solvent of water and a water soluble organic solvent such as dioxane, dimethylformamide or ethanol.  The hyaluronate derivative which is highly soluble in an aqueous vehicle can be obtained by treating with a base such as sodium hydrogen carbonate after the completion of the reaction. [0034]<br>
When the thus produced GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain is subjected to the photodimerization reaction or the photopolymerization reaction to cross link the GAG molecules with one another, for example, the method described in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-249501 can be used. Specifically, in the case of the compound in which the phenylethenyl group as the hydrophobic group is bound to GAG via -COO- (CH2)m-NHCO-, the crosslink can be formed by irradiating light to the solution containing them using an ultraviolet lamp. [0035] 9) Agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention<br>
The agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention contains one or more GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain as the active ingredient, and may also further include other medically, pharmaceutically or biologically acceptable substances other than the GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain.  Such substances include but are not limited to, salts such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, disodium hydrogen<br><br>
phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate and monopotassium hydrogen phosphate, and preservatives such as paraoxybenzoate esters, benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol and chlorhexidine gluconate, and other pharmacologically active ingredients -<br>
The agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention can be made into any publicly known formulation forms (e.g., solid preparations such as granules and powder, liquid preparations such as aqueous solutions, suspension and emulsion, and gel preparations) as the pharmaceutical for applying to the mucosa.  In the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention, the form thereof upon formulating and distributing and the form thereof upon applying to the mucosa may be the same or different.  For example, the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention may be formulated in the form of solution and may be applied directly to the mucosa as it is. Also, the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention may be formulated and distributed in the solid form, and may be made into solution or gel when being applied to the mucosa-  Thus, the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention can be made into the formulation form for being prepared when used.<br>
When being made into the liquid agent by dissolving in water, the amount of GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain is preferably 0.02 to 5% by weight, more preferably 0.1 to 3% by weight, extremely preferably 0.1 to 1% by weight and most preferably 0.1 to 0,6% by weight. [0036] ‹Applied subjects›<br>
The agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention aims at applying to the mucosa. Animals to which the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is applied are not particularly limited as long as they have the mucosa, and mammalian animals are<br><br>
preferable-  The mammalian animals include, but are not limited to, humans, horses, cattle, dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs and mice.  The agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention may be of course made into the pharmaceuticals for humans, and can also be made into the pharmaceuticals for the animals. Among them, it is preferable to be made into the pharmaceuticals for humans.<br>
The mucosa to which the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention can be applied is not particularly limited as long as the mucosa is the mucosa present in the animal.  Such mucosa include mucosal tissues present in organs and tissues exemplified by the gastrointestinal system such as the stomach and intestines, the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, the excretion system such as the urinary bladder, rectum and anus, the genital system such as the vagina, and organs such as eyes, nose and oral cavity which contact with the external world. Among them, the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention can be preferably applied to the cornea, conjunctiva, oral cavity mucosa and urinary bladder mucosa. [0037] ‹Applied diseases›<br>
The agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention can be widely applied to such mucosa.  The purpose of the application is not particularly limited, and for example, the purposes such as protection of the mucosal tissue (e.g., prevention of snow blindness by ultraviolet rays, pterygium and cataract), prevention of mucosal dryness and the treatment of mucosal disorder can be exemplified.  Thus, the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention can be applied to not only the mucosa in the abnormal state (e.g., mucosa where the disorder has occurred) but also the mucosa in the normal state. However, since the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention exerts excellent pharmacological<br><br>
effects in the mucosa where the disorder has occurred, it is possible to preferably use for the treatment of the mucosal disorders, e.g., disorders in the cornea, conjunctiva, oral cavity mucosa and urinary bladder mucosa, [0038]<br>
Since the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention exerts excellent pharmacological effects particularly on disorders in the mucosal epithelia among the mucosal disorders, it is possible to be preferably used for the treatment of the disorders in the mucosal epithelia. [0039]<br>
Examples of such disorders in the mucosal epithelia include corneal epithelial layer disorders such as corneal xerosis (dry eye); keratoconjunctivitis, superficial punctate keratitis (SPK), corneal epithelial erosion, corneal epithelial loss and corneal tumor; oral cavity mucosal disorders such as xerostomia (dry mouth), aphthous ulcer, stomatitis and glossitis; dryness and pruritus of nasal mucosa; urinary bladder mucosal disorders such as interstitial cystitis; ulcerative proctitis, and dryness of the rectum or vagina. Also dryness and lesions of organ mucosa upon surgical operation can be exemplified. Among them, it is possible to be preferably used for the treatment of the corneal epithelial layer disorders, the oral cavity mucosal epithelial disorders and the urinary bladder mucosa epithelial layer disorders. Application method and amount [0040]<br>
The agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention can be applied to the mucosal tissues exemplified above, and its application method and application formulation can be appropriately determined by those skilled in the art depending on the position, morphology, property and function of the mucosa to be applied, and the purpose of the application.  However, it<br><br>
is preferable that the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is applied to the mucosa in the liquid form such as solution in use.  In that case, upon producing (formulating) or applying the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention, the liquid can be obtained by dissolving GAG into which the hydrophobia group is introduced via the binding chain in the solvent. The solvent is not particularly limited as long as the solvent can dissolve the GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain and is the pharmaceutically acceptable solvent.  For example, a buffer such as a phosphate buffer or saline can be used, but the solvent is not limited thereto.  In this case, the concentration of the GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain in the liquid agent is not particularly limited, and can be appropriately determined depending on the type of the mucosa to be applied and the degree of the mucosal disorder. When the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is the eye drops, when the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is applied to the oral cavity mucosa or the urinary bladder mucosa, for example, the concentration is preferably 0.02 to 5% by weight, more preferably 0.1 to 3% by weight, still more preferably 0.1 to 1% by weight, still more preferably 0.1 to 0.6% by weight, extremely preferably 0.1 to 0.5% by weight and most preferably 0.1 to 0.3% by weight. [0041]<br>
When the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is applied to the mucosa in the stomach as the liquid as above, an oral administration or the administration using a catheter can be selected. When applied to the mucosa in the eye, the nose or the oral cavity, for example, the administration method such as instillation of drop, nasal instillation or oral inclusion can be selected.  For example, when the agent for applying<br><br>
to mucosa of the present invention is applied to the mucosa in the urinary bladder, rectum or vagina, or the mucosa of organs where the dryness is concerned upon surgical operation, the method of administering by injecting, spraying or applying the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention to a lumen or a surface of these organs or tissues can be selected, but the methods are not limited thereto, [0042]<br>
The amount, the number of times and the frequency of the application (administration of) of the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is not particularly limited, and should be determined depending on the mucosa subjected to the application, the purpose of the application, the type, age, body weight, gender, and degree of mucosal disorder in the animal to be applied. [0043]<br>
Specifically, when the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is used for the purpose of treating the human corneal epithelial layer disorder, the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention at the above-described concentration as the liquid formulation for the instillation of drops (eye drops) containing GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain can be administered by instilling 1 to 3 drops per administration 1 to 5 times per day, and may be administered by instilling 1 to 3 drops per administration 1 to 3 times per day. [0044]<br>
When the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is used for the purpose of treating the human oral cavity mucosal disorder, the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention at the above-described concentration as the liquid containing GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain can be administered by putting the agent for applying to<br><br>
mucosa of the present invention in the oral cavity 1 to 5 times per day and rinsing for approximately several tens of seconds (preferably approximately 20 to 30 seconds) followed by spitting it out. [0045]<br>
When the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is applied to the urinary bladder mucosal disorder, this is preferably used for the treatment of the urinary bladder mucosal disorders exemplified by non-bacterial refractory cystitis exemplified by interstitial cystitis, eosinophilic cystitis and hemorrhagic cystitis which do not respond to anti-bacterial agents although symptoms similar to those of acute bacterial cystitis are exhibited.  In this case, the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention at the above-described concentration as the liquid containing GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain can be administered by administering the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention directly to the urinary bladder at the amount of 50 mL per administration 1 to 7 times per week or administering with a catheter in the urinary bladder. [0046]<br>
The agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention can stay at the diseased site for a longer period of time because the active ingredient contained in the agent exhibits the high staying property in the mucosa, compared with the conventional drugs containing hyaluronic acid as the active ingredient in which no hydrophobic group has been bound.  Therefore, the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention can also exert the treating effect persistently even at the low administration frequency on the disorders such as inflammation and lesions in the mucosa.  However, the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention is not limited by its administration frequency.<br><br>

3)	Removal of corneal epithelia and production of frozen<br>
blocks<br>
Two rabbits were given general anesthesia by intravenously injecting 5 mg/kg of ketamine and 2 mg/kg of xylazine per rabbit, and eyeballs were removed 30 minutes, one hour, one and a half hours and 2 hours and 30 minutes after the administration of the subject substance and the control substance. A pore was opened between the cornea and sclera in the removed eyeball using a surgical knife, and only the cornea was taken out using the microscissors. The removed cornea was placed on a biological sample slicing plate (supplied from Nisshin EM Corporation, Cat No. 428), and the portion to be observed was cut .out using a single-edged g.aaor blado• stainless steel* (GEM(R) STAINLESS STEEL UNCOATED, Nisshin EM Corporation, Cat No. 429) . The cut out portion was immersed in O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek (R) 4583, Lot. 1178), then embedded in a cryostat tray (supplied by Murazumi Co., Ltd., Cat. No. 31) filled with the O.C.T. compound so that the portion to be observed was at a bottom, and rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen in foam polystyrene to make an unfixed frozen block.<br>
4)	Production of frozen sections<br>
Subsequently, the frozen block was removed from the cryostat tray, and attached on a sample table using the O.C.T. compound. The sample table and a disposable microtome blade (supplied by Leica Microsystems Japan, Model 818, Lot. No. 913212) were set in a high performance frozen microtome for research, and the block was sliced under the condition of a frozen chamber temperature (CT) at -2O°C and sample side temperature (OT) at -16°C to make sections with a thickness of 5 µm using silane coating<br><br>
slide glasses (supplied by Muto Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd.,<br>
Star Frost Slide Glass, Cat. No. 5116).<br>
5) Methods of observation and photographing<br>
The frozen section was set in an incident-light fluorescence microscope (Olympus Corporation, BH2-RFC), FA images and autofluorescent images were observed at IB cube (BH2-DMIB, excitation wavelength: 4 95 run, absorption wavelength: 460 nm) and U cube (BH2-DMU, broad band U excitation, absorption wavelength: 435 nm), respectively. The FA image and the autofluorescent image were photographed using a cooled high sensitivity CCD camera (Keyence Corporation, VB-6010) under the condition of exposure time for one second and ISO sensitivity of 200. [0065] (10-2) Study results<br>
Photographs of the sampled cornea were shown in FIGS. 11 and 12.  From FIGS. 11 and 12, it was identified by color development of the fluorescence label that the aqueous solution of 0.3% by weight fluorescence labeled HA which was the control substance stayed until 30 minutes after the administration but did not stay after one hour. Meanwhile, although the fluorescent color development of the aqueous solution of 0.3% by weight fluorescence labeled cinnamate derivative-introduced HA which was the subject substance was weakened with the elapse of time, the color development was observed at all time points from 30 minutes to 2 hours and 30 minutes after the administration, thereby the high staying performance was confirmed.

2)	Administration of subject substance and control<br>
substance<br>
In the condition where the eye was opened, 150 µl of an aqueous solution of 0.3% by weight HA with a weight average molecular weight 600,000 to 1,200,000 as the control substance was administered in the right eye, and<br>
150 µl of 0.3% by weight cinnamate derivative-introduced HA prepared in the above Example (1-2) as the subject substance was administered in the left eye.  In the administration, the 1 ml injection syringes were used. One rabbit described in the above 1) was used as the administration subject.<br>

Ultraviolet rays were irradiated to both eyes from a distance of approximately 10 cm apart from the rabbit eyeball using a 15 kW germicidal lamp.  The irradiation was performed for 3 hours.<br>
4)	Photographing of ultraviolet rays irradiated site<br>
The eyeball was stained with 0.2% sodium fluorescein under the continuous anesthesia of the rabbit, and photographed under violet light. When photographed, the focal length was made constant to make the magnification of photographs constant. [0067] (11-2) Study results<br>
Photographs after the irradiation of the ultraviolet rays were shown in FIG. 13.  From FIG. 13, in the eyeball irradiated with the ultraviolet rays after the administration of the control substance, the disordered<br><br>
site stained with 0.2% sodium fluorescein was apparent. Meanwhile, in the eyeball irradiated with the ultraviolet rays after the administration of the subject substance, the disordered site stained with 0.2% sodium fluorescein was clearly smaller than that of the control substance, and the corneal disorder caused by the ultraviolet ray was prevented.<br>

Using the removed cornea of the rabbit, the moisturizing performance of the cinnamate derivative-introduced HA prepared in Example 1 was validated.<br>
(12-1) methods<br>
1)	Removal of cornea<br>
The rabbit was given general anesthesia by intravenously injecting 5 mg/kg of ketamine and 2 mg/kg of xylazine, and the eyeball was removed. A pore was opened between the cornea and the sclera in the removed eyeball using a surgical knife, and only the cornea was taken out using the microscissors.<br>
2)	Drying treatment of cornea<br>
The drying treatment was performed by placing the removed cornea on a paraffin block with a False-tooth stability material and providing cold air from the distance of approximately 1 m from the cornea using a dryer for 5 minutes.<br>
3)	Administration of test substances (subject substance,<br>
control substance and negative control substance)<br>
After the completion of the drying treatment, 100 µl of saline as the negative control substance, the aqueous solution of 0.3% by weight HA with a weight average molecular weight of 600,000 to 1,200,000 as the control substance or the aqueous solution of 0.5% by weight cinnamate derivative-introduced HA prepared in the above Example (1-2) as the subject substance was administered to<br><br>
two corneas.  In the administration, the 1 ml injection syringes were used.  Three rabbits (6 corneas) described in the above 1) were used as the administration subjects. 4) Measurement of water evaporation amount<br>
The water evaporation amount was measured using a water evaporation amount measurement apparatus (AS-TW2, ASAHIBIOMED) before the administration of the test substance, after the drying treatment, after the administration of the test substance and until 40 minutes with 10 minute intervals after the administration of the test substance.<br>
[0069]<br>
(12-2) Study results<br>
The results of measuring the water evaporation amount were shown in FIG. 14.  From FIG. 14, the water evaporation amount was slightly higher in the HA aqueous solution which was the control substance than in the saline which was the negative control whereas the saline became the value close to 0 after 40 minutes.  On the other hand, the water evaporation amount after the administration of the subject substance kept the high value even when 40 minutes passed over, thereby the clear moisturizing performance of the subject substance was confirmed.<br>

(13-1) methods<br>
1)	Removal of corneal epithelia<br>

saline, and the corneal epithelia was fixed by placing it<br>
u)Ybh,<br>
on the paraffin block «HM• the False-tooth stability<br>
material just before the measurement (hereinafter described as "the cornea to be measured").<br>
2)	Water evaporation in corneal epithelia<br><br>
The cornea to be measured was given cold air by the dryer from the distance of 30 cm for 5 minutes, and left standing at a room temperature for one hour.<br>
3)	Administration of subject substance<br>
After the water is evaporated, two drops<br>
(approximately 100 µl) of saline as the negative control substance, the aqueous solution of 0.3% by weight HA with a weight average molecular weight of 600,000 to 1,200,000 as the control substance or the aqueous solution of 0.5% by weight cinnamate derivative-introduced HA prepared in the above Example (1-2) as the subject substance was administered by the 1 ml syringe*<br>
4)	Measurement of water evaporation amounts<br>
The amount perceived as an unperceived evaporation amount (released water amount per m2 per hour) was directly measured as the water evaporation amount from the cornea to be measured using the water evaporation amount measurement apparatus (AS-TW2). [0071] (13-2) Study results<br>
The results of measuring the water evaporation amount were shown in FIG. 15.  From FIG, 15, the water evaporation amount was slightly higher in the HA aqueous solution which was the control substance than in the saline which was the negative control whereas the saline exhibited the value close to 0 after 40 minutes.  On the other hand, the water evaporation amount of the administered subject substance kept the high value even when 40 minutes had passed over, thereby it was confirmed that the subject substance has a more persistent water retention property on the cornea compared with saline and the HA aqueous solution.

‹Example l4›<br>
Validation of healing effect of crosslinked cinnamate derivative-introduced HA<br><br>
Using a model hamster for xerostomia, the healing effect of the crosslinked cinnamate derivative-introduced HA prepared in Example 2 on the xerostomia was validated. (14-1) Test method<br>
1)	Production of model hamster for xerostomia<br>
An inside of the oral cavity of a male Syrian hamster was exposed by inserting a test tube with a diameter of approximately 10 mm in the oral cavity close to a buccal side and reversing it under the anesthesia with Nembutal. By giving hot air for approximately 20 seconds, and subsequently giving cold air for 2 minutes and 40 seconds to the exposed inside of the oral cavity using a dryer, the model hamster for the xerostomia was obtained. The inside of the oral cavity was continuously exposed until the measurement was completed.<br>
2)	Administration of subject substance and control<br>
substance<br>
Immediately after making the xerostomia model, 100 µl of (A) PBS, (B) 0.2% by weight HA solution (supplied by Seikagaku Corporation, weight average molecular weight: 1,500,000) or (C) 0.2% by weight crosslinked cinnamate derivative-introduced HA solution was administered by applying to the inside of the oral cavity using a microsyringe.<br>
Hereinafter, the group administered with (A), the group administered with (B) and the group administered with (C) are referred to as PBS group, HA group and crosslinked cinnamate derivative-introduced HA group, respectively.  For the administration classification (administration group composition), seven hamsters were used for each of the PBS group, the HA group and the crosslinked cinnamate derivative-introduced HA group,<br>
3)	Calculation of water evaporation amount ratio<br>
The water evaporation amount in the inside of the oral cavity in the xerostomia model hamster was measured using the water evaporation system (Asahibiomed), and the<br><br>
water evaporation amount ratio was calculated when the measurement value immediately after making the xerostomia model hamster was 1-  The higher this water evaporation amount ratio is, the more moisturized condition is maintained (degree of oral cavity dryness is low).  The measurement was performed immediately after making the xerostomia model hamster, immediately after the administration, 10 minutes and 20 minutes after the administration. [0073] (14-2) Study results<br>
The results of measuring the water evaporation amount are shown in FIG. 16•  In the figure, circled numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the horizontal axis represent data immediately after making the xerostomia model hamster, immediately after the administration, 10 minutes and 20 minutes after the administration, respectively.  P represents a significance level-  Immediately after the administration, all of administration groups exhibited the water evaporation amount ratio of 3.3 to 4.5.  The water evaporation amount ratio 10 minutes after the administration was 0.9 on average in the PBS group and 2.3 on average in the HA group.  On the other hand, it was 3.2 on average in the crosslinked cinnamate derivative-introduced HA group, thus the higher water evaporation amount ratio than the PBS group and the HA group was shown. Further, the water evaporation amount ratio 20 minutes after the administration was 0.9 on average in the PBS group and 1.3 on average in the HA group.  On the other hand, it was 3.2 on average in the crosslinked cinnamate derivative-introduced HA group, thus the extremely higher water evaporation amount ratio compared with the PBS group and the HA group was indicated.  Furthermore, as is apparent from FIG. 16, the water evaporation amount ratio in the crosslinked cinnamate derivative-introduced HA group was very stable regardless of the elapse of time.<br><br>
This indicated that the crosslinked cinnamate derivative-introduced HA stayed at the administered site for a long period of time and exerted a highly persistent effect.<br>
From the above results, GAG into which the hydrophobic group is introduced via the binding chain including the cinnamate derivative-introduced HA and the crosslinked cinnamate derivative-introduced HA has been shown to be suitable for the application to the mucosa and capable of effectively treating the disorder in the mucosal epithelial layer by being applied to the mucosa. It has been also shown that the effect of the treatment is highly persistent.<br>
Since no adverse effect due to the administration of the cinnamate derivative-introduced HA and the crosslinked cinnamate derivative-introduced HA was observed in any of the above animal studies, the safety of the agent for applying to mucosa of the present invention can be sufficiently estimated.
