				<td>A PROCESS  FOR  THE  PREPARATION   '1,4,5!-OXADIAZEPINE  DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of [1 ,4,5]-oxadiazepines and to their use as intermediates in the preparation of herbicides of the tetrahydropyrazolodione type.<br>
According to WO 03/051853, [1 ,4,5]-oxadiazepines can be prepared by reacting various N.N'-diacylated hydrazines with, for example, 2,2'-dichlorodiethyl ether in a polar solvent to form 4,5-diacyl-[1 ,4,5]-oxadiazepines and then removing the two acyl groups using a hydrohalic acid.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the preparation of (1 ,4,5]-oxadiazepine derivatives can be further improved by carrying out the conversion of 4,5-cftacyl-[1 ,4,5]-oxadiazepines into the corresponding [1 ,4,5]-oxadiazepines using a base.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a novel process for the preparation of [1,4,5]-oxadiazepine derivatives by reaction of a 4,5-diacyl-(1 ,4,5]-oxadiazepine with a base in a polar solvent and at elevated temperature.<br>
Preferred 4,5-diacyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepines correspond to formula I<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R, and R2 are each independently of the other hydrogen, CrCsalkyl, Cr Cshaloalkyl, C2-Csalkenyl, Ca-Csalkynyl, phenyl, alkylphenyl, halophenyl, alkoxyphenyl, benzyl, alkylbenzyl, halobenzyl, alkoxybenzyl, d-Csalkoxy-C-CsalkyI or QrCecydoalkyl, or Rt and R2 together are Ci-C4alkylene, 1 ,2-phenylene or 1 ,8-naphthylene, and R3 and R4 are each independently of the other hydrogen, C,-C5alkyl, C-C5alkoxy-C,-C5alkyl, phenyl, alkylphenyl, halophenyl, alkoxyphenyl or benzyl.<br>
Preferably, Rf and R2 are each independently of the other hydrogen or CrCsalkyi, especially methyl. R3 and R* are preferably hydrogen.<br><br>
The 4,5-diacyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepines of formula I used according the invention as starting materials are known and can be prepared in a manner known perse, for example in the manner described in WO 03/051853. The yield of such starting materials can be improved in the case of the reaction of N,N'-diacylated hydrazines with, for example, 2,2'-dichlorodiethyl ether, by using hydroxides of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals as the base and by carrying out the reaction with the addition of a phase transfer catalyst, such as, for example, TBACI (tetrabutylammonium chloride), TBABr (tetrabutylammonium bromide), TMACI (tetramethylammonium chloride) or TMABr (tetrabutylammonium bromide) or benzyl-triethylammonium chloride, benzyl-triethylammonium bromide or Aliquat, and/or by   . continuously distilling off the water formed during the reaction from the reaction mixture.<br>
An N.N'-diacylated hydrazine can be prepared by first reactingThydrazine hydrate with an acyl ester to form the monoacylated hydrazine and then, without intermediate isolation of the monoacylated hydrazine, adding an acyl anhydride to the highly concentrated aqueous-alcoholic reaction mixture. The solvents can be removed completely from the reaction mixture, for example by concentration by evaporation, and the residue can be used further without being further purified.<br>
The alkyl radicals in the substituent definitions of the compounds of formula I contain from 1 to 5 carbon atoms and are, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl or pentyl or branched isomers thereof. Alkoxy radicals are derived from the mentioned alkyl radicals. Alkenyl and alkynyl radicals each have from 2 to 5 carbon atoms and are, for example, ethenyl, propenyl, ethynyl and propynyl and branched isomers thereof, and also butenyl, butynyi, pentenyl, pentynyl and also branched and di-unsaturated isomers thereof. The phenyl radicals may furthermore be mono- or poly-substituted by halogen, alkyl or alkoxy, for example each of which has from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, which preferably occupy the ortho or meta position or ortho and para positions. Halogen is preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine.<br>
The reaction according to the invention is carried out in polar solvents, preferably in water or alcohols that preferably have a boiling point above 100°C, such as, for example, n-butancl, n-pentanol, cyclohexanol, phenol, benzyl alcohol and especially glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol and C^alkoxy-C^ateohols, such as methoxyisopropanol and ethoxyethanol,<br><br>
and also DMSO [(CH3)2SO}, sulfolane [(CH2)4SO2}, NMP [(CH2)3CONCH3), DMA ICH3CON(CH3)2] or DMF [HCON(CH3)2J or mixtures thereof, with preference being given to NMP, DMSO and, especially, water. It is also possible to use two-phase systems that contain, for example, water and an aromatic solvent, such as toluene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, xylene or anisole.<br>
The expression "elevated temperature" preferably denotes a temperature range of from 50 to 150°C. Especially advantageously, a range of from 80 to 100°C is used.<br>
The reaction can also be carried out under pressure, pressures of up to 10 bar preferably being used.<br>
By adding a phase transfer catalyst, such as, for example, TBACI (tetrabutylammonium chloride), TBABr (tetrabutylammonium bromide), TMACI (tetramethylammonium chloride) or TMABr (tetrabutylammonium bromide), or benzyl-triethylammonium chloride or benzyl-triethylammonium bromide or Aliquat, the reaction can be further improved in terms of yields.<br>
Bases suitable for the reaction according to the invention are preferably hydroxides, carbonates and alcoholates of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, with alkali metal hydroxides being preferred. Potassium hydroxide is especially suitable. Preferably, from 1 to 2 equivalents, especially from 1 to 1.3 equivalents, of base are used per acyl group to be removed. The base can be used in solid form or can be used in solution in one of the mentioned polar solvents, for example in water in a concentration of from 10 to 70%, preferably from 40 to 65%.<br>
The yields of isolated [1,4,5]-oxadiazepine are generally from 60 to 95%. The purity of the [1,4,5]-oxadiazepine is usually about 90%.<br>
In the synthesis of [1,4,5J-oxadiazepine derivatives, the usual procedure is to introduce 4,5-diacyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepine into the polar solvent and heat the mixture. A stoichiometric amount or a suitable excess of base is then added and the reaction mixture is maintained at the selected temperature for approximately from 1 to 10 hours, preferably from 2 to 6 hours. The reaction mixture is extracted using an aromatic solvent that has poor miscibility with the<br><br>
reaction medium, such as chlorobenzene, at a temperature of from 20 to 100°C, preferably in the range from 60 to 80°C, thus yielding a solution comprising the [1,4,5J-oxadiazepine from which the latter can be isolated in customary manner, for example by distilling off the aromatic solvent. The extraction can be carried out batchwise or continuously.<br>
In principle, however, it is also possible to meter in the 4,5-diacyl-[1,4,5J-oxadiazepine instead of the base, or to meter in both components, base and 4,5-diacyl-[1,4,5]-oxadiazepine.<br>
In order to facilitate isolation of the product, a salt that is inert towards the reaction mixture and soluble therein can be added thereto. The salt used for that purpose is preferably the same salt as that obtained when the acyl group is removed, that is to say an acetate, for example potassium acetate. At a suitable salt concentration, direct separation of the [1,4,5]-oxadiazepine can in that way be achieved.<br>
The process according to the invention can be carried out continuously or in batches (discontinuously, batchwise), with the batch procedure being preferred. The reaction times are generally from 1 to 10 hours. The batchwise reaction procedure is preferably carried out in a stirred vessel, and the continuous reaction procedure, for example, in a stirred vessel cascade.<br>
Compared with the known removal of the acyl groups using hydrohalic acid, the process according to the invention has the following advantages:<br>
higher volumetric yields can be achieved since, in the case of the reaction using<br>
hydrohalic acid, a viscous crystal suspension comprising the hydrohalide of the<br>
[l,4,5]-oxadiazepine in question is formed which, at a certain concentration and<br>
above, seriously impairs the stirrability of the reaction mass<br>
by metering in the base and/or the 4,5-diacetyl-[1,4,5J-oxadiazepine, the -reaction can<br>
be controlled in a simple manner<br>
the addition of the readily soluble salts enables extensive extraction of the [1,4,5]-<br>
oxadiazepine to be carried out<br>
reliability of the process is improved, because the thermal stability of the [1,4,5]-<br>
oxadiazepine derivatives is far better than that of the corresponding hydrohalides<br><br>
the isolation of [1,4,5]-oxadiazepines by extraction is considerably simpler than the isolation of the corresponding hydrohalides the cycle time is appreciably shorter<br>
The [1,4,5]-oxadiazepine derivatives prepared according to the invention are used especially as intermediates in the preparation of herbicides of the tetrahydropyrazolodione type, which are described, for example, in WO 99/47525.<br>
