FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to remote funtionalised Diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes (DADQs) having enhanced fluorescence in the solid state and reduced fluorescence in presence of organic solvent, having general formula A:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Wherein:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for preparing the remote functionalized DADQs as defined above. The present invention further relates to novel polymeric substrate incorporated with the DADQs and a process for preparing such doped polymer.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART REFERENCES<br>
The general class of Diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes, called DADQ's hereafter, were first synthesized by researchers at Du Pont, USA [L.R.Hertler, H.D.Hartzler, D.S.Acker, R.E.Benson, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1962, 84, 3387]. Their work primarily describes synthesis<br><br>
aspects. The potential applications of some of the derivatives as dyes were covered by a US patent [D. S. Acker, D.C. Blomstrom, U S Patent 3,115,506]. The distinction between their work and the present invention lies in the actual molecules studied, detailed procedures for the synthesis of these molecules as well as the application potential. The systems studied now are all new molecules, though belonging to the general family of DADQ's. Their unique and distinguishing characteristic is the remote functional groups. The enhanced fluorescence is a novel property realized with the present systems, which were not with the ones reported by the Du Pont group. Several DADQ's have been developed earlier which have interesting nonlinear optical applications such as second harmonic generation. Only two compounds in this series have been reported to show enhanced fluorescence [D. Bloor, Y. Kagawa, M. Szablewski, M. Ravi, S. J. Clark, G. H. Cross, L. Palsson, A. Beeby, C. Farmer, G. Rumbles, J. Mater. Chem. 2001,11, 3053] (in viscous solvents, solid state and polymer films). However, these are not remote functionlized systems like the ones we describe and the previous work does not demonstrate quantitative aspects of fluorescence enhancement in the solid state or demonstrate reversible fluorescence switching of doped polymer films.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION:<br>
The  main   object   of the  present  invention  is   to   provide   remote   functionalized<br>
Diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes (DADQs) having enhanced fluorescence in the solid<br>
state and reduced fluorescence in presence of organic solvent ie. in solution or for the<br>
doped polymer film, in presence of solvent vapours.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing the remote<br>
functionalised Diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes (DADQs).<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a polymeric substrate incorporated<br>
with remote functionlised DADQ's (doped polymer) for use in manufacturing vapor<br>
responsive switches and sensors.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing polymeric<br>
substrate incorporated with remote functionalized DADQs (doped polymer).<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The current interest in the photoluminescence and electroluminescence of molecular materials is a major impetus to explore novel chromophores which not only do not suffer fluorescence quenching in the aggregated state, but display enhanced light emission in the solid state and in polymer films. A new family of remote functionalised zwitterionic diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes (Figure 1) are synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic techniques. Crystal structures of two of the compounds are also determined (Figure 2). Electronic absorption and emission studies demonstrate a dramatic enhancement of light emission in the solid state of these compounds and their doped polymer films, as compared to the solution state (Table 1). A viable model to explain the interesting phenomenon of fluorescence enhancement has been worked out through semiempirical quantum chemical computations and the crystal structure information. Finally, reversible and reproducible switching of the enhanced fluorescence of a doped polymer film, triggered by chloroform vapors was demonstrated (Figure 3). This has considerable potential in the development of organic vapor-responsive switches and sensors.<br>

Remote functionalised DADQ's are new molecules having remote groups attached to the DADQ, which facilitate novel molecular assemblies without perturbing the chromophore properties and impart a number of interesting characteristics to DADQs. The remote functionalized DADQs can be used in several applications such as (i) steering centrosymmetric crystal lattice into SHG active noncentric ones, (ii) instance o f charge transfer phenomenon exclusively in the solid state and (iii) fabrication of desired molecular environment of interest in modeling studies.<br>
A very important advantage derived from the presence of remote functionality on the DADQ's is the solubility of the compounds in water in addition to regular organic solvents. DADQ's which are not remote functionalized are generally either insoluble in water or undergo hydrolytic decomposition in water. Since the synthesized remote functionalized DADQ's are soluble in water and form stable aqueous solution, they can be incorporated in water soluble polymers. This allows the fabrication of doped polymer films which can be used for organic vapour sensing. Finally the remote functionality on the DADQs allows intermolecular interactions which appear to be important for the molecular aggregation and fluorescence enhancement.<br>
The spectroscopic data on the new remote functionalized DADQ's allow to quantify the fluorescence enhancement in solid state and doped polymer films. None of the earlier studies on DADQs have demonstrated the type of reversibility and stability of fluorescence switching of the fluorescence on exposure to solvent or solvent vapors that the Applicants have demonstrated with doped polymer films containing the remote functionalized DADQ's.<br>
None o f the e arlier D ADQs are known t o b e w ater-soluble a nd forming s table a queous solutions and the Applicants have been able to prepare remote functionalized DADQs that are water-soluble and stable in aqueous solution for the first time. Finally, the detailed modeling the Applicants have carried out for the mechanism of fluorescence enhancement is not available in the case of any of the systems reported earlier. The mechanism for the fluorescence enhancement in the remote functionalised DADQ's has been worked out with<br><br>
the aid of semiempirical quantum chemical computations. The concept of 'molecule-in-a-crystal' developed earlier by the Applicants was utilized. Semiempirical AMI computations incorporating the solvation modeling routine, COSMO showed that the fluorescence observed arise from the vertical excited state. The computations showed that the geometry relaxed excited state would not show fluorescence in the visible range. Geometry relaxation is possible in solution, but unlikely in the solid state and in doped polymer films. Therefore, it is concluded that the fluorescence enhancement observed in the latter cases arises due to effective inhibition of the geometry relaxation. This mechanism is quite different from that proposed in the earlier systems.<br>
When an optical property such as fluorescence (light emission) is affected reversibly by the presence or absence of a vapour; it can be an effective way to sense the vapour. Alternately the vapour can be used to switch on or off the optical signal and in this sense, the material can be used as a transducer where the vapour is the stimulus and optical signal is the response. Both these applications require that the process happens reversibly and reproducibly, Finally, polymer films have an important advantage that they can be produced cheaply and can be fabricated for large area coverage. This allows the sensing or switching element to be prepared economically. Doped polymer films allow fine control of dopant concentration and therefore, the optical response can be fine tuned based on the application needs.<br>

Figure 2 shows the molecular structure of the remote functionalized DADQ in the crystalline state for the DADQs with the substitutions as shown in options 1 and 2 for A.<br><br>
Crystal structure analysis is possible only when large enough single crystals can be grown. The general structure is indicated for these and all other compounds in Fig. 1.<br>
Figure 3 describes the phenomenon of the variation of the fluorescence emission maximum of doped polymers in presence/absence of chloroform vapor. In the dry state, the fluorescence is high (the filled square marks in the graph). On exposure to chloroform vapors, the fluorescence decreases (the filled circle marks in the graph). Both fluorescence are visible to naked eye under ambient lighting which has a UV (ultra-violet) component. However, the fluorescence in the dry state is, of course, more visible. The fluorescence is best observed using 350-360 nm light from a UV lamp for excitation.<br>
Table 1 provides the wavelength (denoted by Greek letter lambda, expressed in nanometers, nm) of light at which each of the compound absorbs most, when in solution, in the solid state and when doped in polymer films (the superscript for lambda, abs, indicates this). The table also provides the wavelength where the fluorescence (same as emission) in each of these states is maximum for each of the compound (the superscript for lambda, em, indicates this). R is the ratio of the fluorescence intensity in the solid state or polymer film, compared to the fluorescence intensity of the same compound in acetonitrile solution. This number indicates the enhancement of fluorescence in the solid state and polymer film, compared to the solution state.<br>
