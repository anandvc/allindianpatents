				<td>METHOD FOR FORMING LEAD-ACID BATTERIES AND PLANT FOR<br>
IMPLEMENTING SAID METHOD.<br>
This invention concerns a rapid method for forming lead-acid batteries, of the<br>
type used mainly, but not only, to start thermal engines.<br>
An important stage in the process for manufacturing lead-acid batteries is the<br>
so-called "forming" of the plates, where the battery's discharging and<br>
recharging reactions take place due to the electrochemical conversion of the<br>
active matter they contain, which transforms the chemical energy into electrical<br>
energy and vice versa.<br>
When they are manufactured, the plates are inert, or inactive; to make them<br>
active, the plates are submitted to a forming procedure that transforms the<br>
inactive lead oxide and lead sulfate into metallic lead and lead dioxide, which<br>
are the active constituents of the negative and positive polarity plates,<br>
respectively.<br>
Forming consists essentially in submitting plates of opposite polarity to a<br>
charging procedure with a direct electric current in a solution of sulfuric acid<br>
diluted with water (the electrolyte) and this can be done before or after<br>
assembling the plates in the battery.<br>
In the former case, we speak of forming in the tank, in the latter of forming in<br>
the case.<br>
In practice, forming in the case is used to form the engine starter batteries<br>
- and generally for all small batteries, regardless of their application - mainly<br>
to contain costs.<br>
A preferred method involves filling the batteries with a diluted electrolyte,<br>
completing the forming process, then removing and replacing the forming<br>
electrolyte, which will have become more concentrated, filling the battery once<br>
again with an electrolyte at a concentration very similar to the one used in the<br>
battery's operation.<br>
This method is also called "forming in the case with two acids" to distinguish it<br>
from the method using one acid, where the forming electrolyte used is more<br>
concentrated so that, by the end of the forming process, it reaches the right<br>
concentration for the battery's operation, thereby simplifying the process.<br>
Technology has always made efforts to accelerate the forming process and the<br>
only effective way to do so is to increase the charging current in order to<br>
reduce the forming time for the same amount of electric energy delivered to<br><br>
transform the inactive into active masses.<br>
There is a limit, however, to how much the current can be increased, imposed<br>
by the ability of the plates (especially the positive plate) to withstand the<br>
forming charge, and particularly the increase in temperature induced by the<br>
heat generated by the exothermal reactions in the forming process and the<br>
Joule effect caused by the flow of current.<br>
A particularly large amount of heat is generated during the forming of starter<br>
batteries "in the case" because of the high ratio of the mass of lead oxides that<br>
have to be transformed from inactive into active with respect to the amount of<br>
forming electrolyte in the battery.<br>
The state of the art has attempted to overcome the problem by using special<br>
oxide formulations for the positive plate and using very diluted forming acids,<br>
opting for forming with two acids to improve plate formability and resorting to<br>
even sophisticated cooling systems to control the increase in temperature<br>
during the forming process.<br>
Even so, forming times have been unable to drop below 12-15 hours.<br>
Another problem relating to battery forming concerns the hydrogen generated<br>
together with the oxygen due to electrolysis of the water in the forming acid<br>
electrolyte, especially towards the end of the process.<br>
The hydrogen that develops not only entrains acid mists that are hazardous to<br>
health, in combination with the oxygen in the air above a certain concentration<br>
ft can generate detonating mixtures.<br>
This poses safety problems that make it necessary to adopt fume extraction<br>
and abatement systems, the size of which would have to be adapted, in the<br>
case of accelerated forming processes, to dispose of the larger quantities of<br>
hydrogen and acid mist due to the higher forming current involved.<br>
A known method for effectively dissipating the heat generated during the<br>
forming process involves circulating the diluted forming electrolyte through a<br>
pipe from an outside tank to the battery and vice versa, so that the electrolyte<br>
can be cooled and its increase in concentration corrected by further diluting it<br>
with water to the required concentration.<br>
Using this sort of method, an acid at the concentration needed for the battery's<br>
operation is added at the end of the forming process, thereby achieving a<br>
continuous "two-acids" process that ultimately produces finished batteries<br>
charged and ready for use.<br><br>
Such a forming process with two acids in circulation is described in the<br>
Swedish Patent application SE-7701184-9 - Publication no. 441403, submitted<br>
by the YUASA company.<br>
This document fails to mention the safety problem posed by the hydrogen<br>
generated during the forming process.<br>
The first aim of the present invention is to design a forming process with two<br>
acids in circulation in which the hydrogen and the related acid mists are<br>
disposed of in conditions of total safety.<br>
Since ideal forming conditions, especially for the positive plate, demand a<br>
temperature between 40 and 60°C, it is important to ensure that the electrolyte<br>
is kept constantly at the right temperature throughout the forming process, and<br>
not just cooled.<br>
The second aim of the present invention is consequently to develop a system<br>
for circulating the forming electrolyte in which not only its concentration, but<br>
also its temperature are kept stable at a given setting.<br>
Moreover, it is desirable for the forming electrolyte to always be freshly<br>
prepared, so as to avoid any build-up of impurities that may derive from its<br>
repeated use in successive formations.<br>
So, another aim of the present invention is to provide a system that enables<br>
the diluted electrolyte used in the first forming process to be used to prepare<br>
the more concentrated working electrolyte used for the second charge, which<br>
remains inside the battery, so that each finished battery, charged and ready for<br>
use, contains its "own" forming electrolyte.<br>
When the battery is in use, i.e. when ft is being discharged, the sulfuric acid in<br>
the electrolyte is "fixed" by the positive and negative plates in the form of lead<br>
sulfate, with a consequent progressive reduction in the concentration of the<br>
electrolyte.<br>
If the active masses of the plates are oversized with respect to the amount of<br>
sulfuric acid in the battery, discharging can continue until the concentration of<br>
the electrolyte becomes similar to that of water.<br>
In these conditions, the solubility of the lead sulfate in the plates increases, so<br>
it dissolves in the electrolyte, albeit in small quantities.<br>
During subsequent recharging, the lead sulfate precipitates again because its<br>
solubility diminishes due to the increasing concentration of the electrolyte.<br>
The lead sulfate that consequently builds up on the microporous separator,<br><br>
placed between the positive and negative plates to ensure their electrical<br>
insulation. Is converted into metallic lead during charging.<br>
This makes the separator electronically conductive, so it short-circuits the<br>
plates of opposite polarity and the battery becomes useless.<br>
This risk exists particularly in modern starter batteries, where the amount of<br>
electrolyte, and consequently of sulfuric acid, is stoichiometrically inadequate<br>
for the quantities of the plates' active masses.<br>
To overcome this problem, it is common practice to include certain additives in<br>
the battery's electrolyte.<br>
These additives are mainly soluble alkaline sulfates, that reduce the solubility<br>
of the lead sulfate when the electrolyte is very diluted.<br>
The additive naturally represents an additional cost, as does the procedure<br>
required for its dosage.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is therefore to provide a method for the<br>
automatic in situ production and dosage of additives for the electrolyte used in<br>
the forming process, starting from inexpensive raw materials.<br>
Another important aim of the invention is to speed up the process of starter<br>
battery forming using two acids in circulation, optimizing the batteries<br>
performance, reducing the cost of the process and complying with<br>
environmental and safety requirements.<br>
The above-specified aims, and others that will be better illustrated in the<br>
following pages, are achieved by a method for forming lead-acid batteries that,<br>
as stated in the first claim, comprises the following<br>
steps<br>
collective first electrolyte, comprising a water solution of sulfuric acid at a given<br>
concentration and at an essentially constant preset temperature <br>
from a first tank through at least one first pipe;<br>
said first electrolyte one or more batteries by means of one<br>
ore more distributors complete with distribution channels, each of them<br>
connected to each of said batteries;<br>
said first electrolyte continuously inside said batteries at a<br>
predetermined and substantially constant concentration and temperature<br>
for a given time, said first electrolyte entering and exiting through openings<br>
provided In said batteries, or battery cells, and returning to safd first tank,<br>
level-detector devices having been provided to ensure a constant level<br><br>
inside each battery during said circulation;<br>
- said batteries with a direct current while said first electrolyte is<br>
circulating for a given forming time;<br>
The circulation of said first electrolyte from said first tank to said batteries <br>
and<br>
-a second electrolyte for a further presest time, said second ellectocyte <br>
kept at a predetermined and substantially constant<br>
concentration and temperature and being collected from a second tank and<br>
comprislng a solution of sulfuric acid and water, the concentration of which<br>
being different from that of the first electrolyte.<br>
-Powering said batteries with a direct current while said second<br>
electrolyte is circulating for a preset mixing charge time.<br>
One of the advantages of the method described in this invention is that, while<br>
the first electrolyte, comprising a water solution of sulfuric acid at a lower<br>
concentration than that of the second electrolyte, is circulating, it is kept at a<br>
constant concentration and temperature throughout the battery forming time.<br>
Since it is common knowledge that the electrochemical reaction occurring<br>
inside the battery during forming involves the production of heat, the<br>
temperature of the circulating electrolyte tends to rise and its concentration<br>
obviously changes.<br>
The fact that the method in this invention includes keeping the first electrolyte<br>
at a constant concentration and temperature while it is in circulation offers an<br>
obvious advantage in that the intensity of the current can be kept higher,<br>
throughout the forming process with the first electrolyte, than when the known<br>
technique is used, the known technique having to keep the current lower to<br>
avoid harmful overheating phenomena In the battery and the deterioration of<br>
the plates being formed.<br>
The same applies to the second circulation with the second electrolyte, which<br>
is a water solution of sulfuric acid in a greater concentration than in the first<br>
electrolyte.<br>
Here again, the temperature and concentration of the circulating electrolyte are<br>
kept constant, at a preset value, throughout the time it takes to perform the<br>
second mixing charge.<br>
In essence, the constant temperature of the electrolyte on the one hand<br>
enables a faster forming process because higher charging currents can be<br><br>
used, since the heat generated is dissipated by cooling the electrolyte; on the<br>
other hand, a substantially identical forming of each battery, and a<br>
consequently similar performance of the batteries, is assured by the constant<br>
concentration of the electrolyte in both the first forming stage and the second<br>
mixing charge stage, thanks to a continuous re-titerfng of the electrolyte.<br>
Moreover, the more diluted electrolyte used in the first forming charge is<br>
prepared by diluting with water the more concentrated electrolyte needed for<br>
the second mixing charge, which is drawn from the second storage tank, so<br>
that the mixing electrolyte is continuously being used up to prepare the first,<br>
more diluted electrolyte used for the initial forming charge, thereby avoiding the<br>
accumulation of the second electrolyte in its storage tank and ensuring its<br>
continual renewal.<br>
The more concentrated electrolyte is also prepared by diluting with water an<br>
even more concentrated electrolyte, typically but not necessarily coinciding<br>
with the one used in the active mass production processes.<br>
This particular, more concentrated electrolyte is treated with alkaline hydroxide<br>
additives in quantities sufficient to partially neutralize its sulfuric acid content in<br>
order to produce alkaline sulfates that will consequently be contained in the<br>
battery, at the end of the forming process, in the concentration needed to<br>
suppress the lead sulfate's solubility, so as to protect the battery against the<br>
risk of short circuits in the event it undergoes deep discharges.<br>
The invention also concerns the plant for implementing the above-illustrated<br>
battery forming method.<br>
Further characteristics and features of the invention behind the described<br>
forming method will become apparent in the description of a preferred form of<br>
implementation of the method object of the invention, given only as an<br>
illustrative and not restrictive example, and illustrated in the attached drawings,<br>
wherein:<br>
-	Fig. 1 shows a layout of the plant for circulating the first electrolyte<br>
according to the method of this invention;<br>
-	Fig. 2 shows the layout of the plant in Fig. 1 when the second electrolyte,<br>
which is more concentrated than the first, is circulated;<br>
-	Fig. 3 shows a schematic view of the connections between the batteries<br>
and the battery forming plant<br>
Table 1 gives an example of the forming process carried out according to the<br><br>
method of the present invention, showing the process parameters and the<br>
performance of the batteries formed using said parameters.<br>
With reference to Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, a bench, indicated as a whole by 1, is used<br>
to support a number of batteries 2 that need to undergo the forming process.<br>
Each of said batteries 2 has at least one positive pole terminal 210 and at least<br>
one negative pole terminal 220 that are connected to the forming plant's<br>
busbars for the delivery of a direct current<br>
There is also a hole 230 where a plug 240 of known type is inserted, complete<br>
with a self-leveling device with two conduits, one for the delivery and one for<br>
the return of the circulating electrolyte.<br>
All the batteries are connected in series, the positive and negative terminals in<br>
series being attached by means of connectors to two busbars, one positive<br>
and one negative, for carrying the direct electrical current.<br>
The electrolyte is delivered to each battery through a delivery pipe 310<br>
connected to the distributor pipe 3, while the electrolyte returns through a<br>
return pipe 410 connected to the collector pipe 4.<br>
The distributor pipe 3 and the collector pipe 4 are connected to the tanks 5 and<br>
6 containing the electrolytes 7 and 8, respectively.<br>
To be more precise, the distributor pipe 3 is connected to the feed piping 9 and<br>
13 when the circulating electrolyte is the electrolyte 7 contained in the tank 5,<br>
or to the feed piping 10 and 101 when the circulating electrolyte is the<br>
electrolyte 8 contained in the tank 6.<br>
As for the collector pipe 4, this is connected to the piping 12 or 11, depending<br>
on whether the circulating electrolyte is the first electrolyte 7 or the second<br>
electrolyte 8.<br>
During the first stage of the process for forming the battery 2, the first<br>
electrolyte 7, consisting of a water solution of sulfuric acid at a certain<br>
concentration lower than that of the second electrolyte 8, is collected from the<br>
first tank 5 and, through the valve 15 and the piping 13, and with the aid of the<br>
pump 14, it reaches the distributor pipe 3, from where it is distributed through<br>
the delivery tubes 310 to each battery.<br>
The electrolyte 7 is kept circulating by means of the fan 17, which creates a<br>
negative pressure in the tank 5 and 6 because its intake is connected to the<br>
piping 171 which is in communication with the two tanks.<br>
Since the tanks 5 and 6 are in communication with the collector pipe 4, the<br><br>
negative pressure created by the electric fan 17 ensures a constant and<br>
continual intake of the electrolyte by the batteries being formed.<br>
Each of the batteries 2 is fitted with a leveling device of known type that<br>
enables the electrolyte being fed to the batteries to reach a certain level L and<br>
not to exceed said level for all the time during which the electrolyte is in<br>
circulation.<br>
In each battery 2, the first electrolyte 7 reaches the level L, then exits through<br>
the pipe 4 and enters the liquid-gas separator 19 through the valve 18 and the<br>
piping 12.<br>
The liquid phase collects on the bottom of the separator and, through the<br>
piping 191, reaches the bottom of the first tank 5.<br>
The gaseous phase, which contains hydrogen, is drawn off through the piping<br>
192 at the top of the separator and arrives to the top of the first tank 5, from<br>
where the it is extracted by the electric fan 17 through the piping 171<br>
This first circulation continues for a preset time, during which the batteries are<br>
charged with a given current.<br>
As mentioned earlier, the electrochemical phenomena occurring inside the<br>
batteries 2 during the charge produce an increase in the temperature of the<br>
electrolyte 7.<br>
A temperature sensor 20, situated in the piping 9 that delivers the electrolyte 7,<br>
picks up the signal relating to the temperature of the electrolyte 7.<br>
This sensor is connected to the heat exchanger 21, which is enabled when the<br>
sensor 20 records a temperature variation with respect to a preset value, thus<br>
providing the cooling or heating capacity needed to restore the electrolyte 7 to<br>
the required temperature.<br>
The electrolyte 7is also kept at a constant preset concentration, controlled by<br>
means of a deusimeter 22 placed in the tank 5.<br>
The sulfuric acid generated during the plate forming process increases the<br>
concentration and consequently also the density of the electrolyte 7, which<br>
thus departs from the established setting.<br>
Demineralized water is consequently delivered to the first tank S through the<br>
pipe 23 from the tank 24 by means of the pump 26 and the valve 26, which<br>
opens for the time necessary to restore the correct concentration of the<br>
electrolyte 7.<br>
After completing the forming charge according to the established time settings<br><br>
and current conditions, during which time the first electrolyte 7 has circulated at<br>
the established temperature and concentration, the second electrolyte a, which<br>
is more concentrated than the first electrolyte 7, begins to circulate.<br>
For this purpose, as shown in Fig. 2, the valves 15 and 28 close to cut off the<br>
circulation of the first electrolyte 7, and the valves 29 and 30 open on the tank<br>
6 containing the second electrolyte 8.<br>
This electrolyte a is delivered to the batteries 2 by the pump 31, and returns to<br>
the second tank 6 through the pipe 4 and the valve 32, after liquid-gas<br>
separation in tha separator 33.<br>
In this separator 33, in the same way as in the separator 19, the liquid is<br>
collected and returned to the tank 6 through the piping 331, while the gas<br>
passes through the piping 332 and reaches the top of the tank 6, from where it<br>
can be extracted by the fan 17 through the piping 171.<br>
Here again, the temperature and concentration of the second electrolyte 8 are<br>
measured respectivelyby the temperature sensor 34 situated on the delivery<br>
piping 10 and by the densimeter 35.<br>
The temperature is corrected in the heat exchanger 36, which is controlled by<br>
the signal sent out by the temperature sensor 34.<br>
In the case of our example, the exchanger 36 is distinct from the exchanger<br>
21.<br>
In other plant design solutions, a single heat exchanger may be used for both<br>
the first and the second electrolyte.<br>
The concentration is corrected by adding preferably demineralized water from<br>
the tank 24 to the tank 6, through the valve 27 and the pump 25 controlled by<br>
the signal coming from the deusimeter 35.<br>
During this phase, called the mixing phase, the first electrolyte 7 contained in<br>
the batteries 2 is replaced by the second, more concentrated electrolyte 8, that<br>
becomes mixed with the first electrolyte 7 to produce an electrolyte at the<br>
working concentration established for the battery.<br>
To facilitate the achievement of the working concentration throughout the<br>
battery, the batteries continue to be charged during mixing, but at a lower<br>
current rating.<br>
All the above operations are managed by a programming and control device<br>
that is not illustrated in the figure, such as a computer controlling a CPU.<br>
It is dear from the above description that the batteries being formed are<br><br>
submitted to a forced circulation of the two electrolytes 7 and 8, each at<br>
controlled and constant temperature and concentration, throughout the forming<br>
charge and the mixing charge.<br>
The process as described guarantees a homogeneous charging of all the<br>
 batteries and consequently their constant performance levels.<br>
Moreover, temperature control of the circulating electrolyte throughout the<br>
forming cycle enables higher forming currents to be used, with a consequent<br>
reduction in the forming times which can be reduced by as much as 75%.<br>
The methods for preparing the electrolytes 7 and 8 at the required<br>
concentrations differ significantly.<br>
The first, more diluted electrolyte 7 is obtained starting from the second<br>
electrolyte 8 and diluting it with demoralized water.<br>
For this purpose, as we can see in Fig. 1, the pump 38 transfers the second<br>
electrolyte 8 from the tank 6 to the tank 5, while the water for its dilution is<br>
collected from the tank 24 through the pump 25 and the valve 26.<br>
The process for preparing the first electrolyte 7 is governed by the density.<br>
densi meter 22.<br>
The second electrolyte 8 in the tank 6, which is more concentrated than the<br>
first electrolyte 7, is prepared in the second tank 6 starting from a third<br>
electrolyte 39, more concentrated than either 8 or 7, contained in a third tank<br>
37. from where it is sent to the tank 6 by the pump 43.<br>
The water for diluting the electrolyte is drawn from the tank 24.<br>
This demineralized water reaches the tank 6 via the pump 25 and the valve 27<br>
and the process for preparing the second electrolyte 8 is governed by the<br>
densimeter 35.<br>
As already mentioned, it is useful for the battery's electrolyte to contain salts,<br>
mainfy soluble sulfates, to prevent the onset of short circuits in the battery<br>
when it is recharged after being deeply discharged.<br>
The method of this invention consequently includes adding these soluble<br>
sulfates to the electrolyte 8.<br>
For this purpose, the alkaline hydroxide contained in a fourth tank 40 is drawn<br>
off by the pump 41 and added to the tank 37 before the third electrolyte 39<br>
flows into the second tank 6 through the piping 16. where it is diluted to<br>
produce the second electrolyte 8.<br>
The amount of alkaline hydroxide added to the sulfuric acid is controlled by<br><br>
measuring the density of the electrolyte in the tank 37 using the density-<br>
densimeter 42.<br>
The gaseous phase extracted by the fan 17 contains hydrogen below its<br>
explosion threshold in air because it is diluted in each of the pipes 410<br>
connected to the collector pipe 4, each of which has an opening 44 that allows<br>
for the intake of sufficient volumes of air.<br>
The concentration of the hydrogen is recorded at the inlet to the piping 171<br>
using a known device 170.<br>
If the maximum allowable value for the concentration of hydrogen in the<br>
gaseous phase extracted by the fan 17 is exceeded, the charging process is<br>
automatically stopped, and the same applies in the event of any failure of the<br>
fan 17.<br><br>
Table 1 compares the initial capacities of two identical starter batteries formed<br>
respectively by circulating the electrolyte according to the method described<br>
is above and using a conventional system.<br>
For the same amount of energy delivered during the forming cycle, the<br>
batteries demonstrate equivalent initial performance levels, based on their<br>
20-hour capacity after being discharged three times, but the forming time using<br>
the circulating electrolyte method amount to 5 hours, i.e. a quarter of the time<br>
needed for conventional forming.<br>
Clearly, therefore, all the specified aims have been achieved by the forming<br>
method object of the invention.<br>
In particular, it is worth emphasizing that forming the batteries while the two<br>
acids are kept at constant concentration and temperature all the time the acids<br>
are circulating not only reduces the forming time, but also achieves a<br>
substantially constant quality of the batteries, which all feature the same<br>
charge and the same chemical transformation of the cells comprising each<br><br>
