				<td>Us Patent nor- 2986336 The device is fitted on the traly on the  wheel traly a engine isfitted on the tanks a lifting  pumps are connected with V belts  the  engine, blower  regulater is fitted on the back of blower and in front a nozzle  is fitted  to spray the gasoline and keep the hoper  heated to helps in making the fog.<br>
Summary of the invention;- according to present invention in its broadest aspect the povided fogging machine comprising The Puls fogging wheel type cum portable is a Auto start and can also manual start. To stop the workim of machine a manual device is provided for the time of emergence a manual cut - off device and remote control  off device is provided. A folded  wheel traly  is fitted at the bottom of the machine. When the the tanks are empty or with a less filled chemical it can be used as a portable and by unfolding the wheel traly it can be used by pullying the machine. To minimise the loud voice a eylencer  is provided on the hoper. The power supply by 6 volt cell or by solar cell or can be feed by electricity to the electronic circut to provide current to the plug for the ignition  to burn the gasoline to heat up  the ventury to make the fog. Air is pumped from the primer  rubber pump which is routed through the three way valve, the major air goes to the petrol tank to form pressure, another small air goes to taper pipe where the petrol and air is mixed  and pushed toward ventury to get the ignitied and heated the ventury. the third way of air is to go to the ventury through the ben jo nut from the petrol is passed toword the taper pipe and to the ventury for burn. The n a Puls like rethem is started and heat up the ventury. On the outer end of the ventury a formulation nozzle is fitted when  the chemical passes through the hot ventury it started making the fog.<br>
Brief Description of Drawing ;- Preferred embodiments will<br>
now be more particularly described by way of example only,<br>
with reference  to the accompanying drawing wherein;-<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a fogging m-chine embodying<br>
the present invention<br>
Figure 2 Is a cross section view of chemical circuit.<br>
Figure 3 is a vw of Electricity circuit.<br>
Figure  4 is a view of the  body.inner<br>
Description of the preferred embodiment<br>
refering to the figure no 1 fogging machine of the present invention comprises a folded wheel traly 2 Cheast plate 3 mirrer for the operater to have back view. 4eylencer on the hopper 5 lifting device 6 solar pannel and cell pannel 7  body of the machine. 3 machine fitted on folded ladder Refering to figure  2  fogging machine  17 connenting tube which  isapassage for the air to the formulation tank to form pressure in it. on the other side it is connected with taper pipe  which transfer the some hot air towords tank. 18 formulation tank with two way passage  A air goes from this side to form pressure P from where the chemical comes out after filterization. A air control  device is fitted to release the pressure.  19  Tank of chemical  20 Tap for controling chemical  21 Plug on the ventury for ignition 22. ventury 23 hopper cover of the ventury. 24 nozzle for the chemical to spray on the hot ventury<br>
Reference to the figure no 3 view of the electricity circuit 28 micro switch connected to battery cell solar pannel and elect, pannel when 'the pump is pressed  lever of the micro switch pressed and current passes it  work  on make and break. current 6 volt goes to  31 electronic circuit to coil to spark plug  32 &amp;33 to burn the gasoline.30 this is a electcity coverter toreduce to 6 volt  DC . Reference to the figure no  4 view of the innerbody<br>
of the fogging machine 01 valve  which is fitted in side of premer pump Which allow the air to come in side but when we press it  the valve close  with a disc . 02 the pump is a used to press the air into the machine through the three way valve. 03 auto starting device is fitted with  a nipple to the pump it has a baloon in side with a valve  which does not allow the air  to go back in the pump the release of the air is done by a regulater  which not only release the air but also current is also sent to the plug directle  tostart the machine automatically. 04 it is a joining tube 05 three way valve which send the air of pump  to  the petrol  tank to make pressure init   and air to the banjo nut  for mixing the air with the petrol and to brost the oressure.one way of goes to  taper pine to help in ignition the gasoline 06 a regulater which can control the nressure of the petrol tank 07 the petrol tank 08 filter 0.6 cutt of device  at the time of emergence if the machine is to stop working  it should turn off the cutt off device  which will stop supply of petrol to the  machine and the machine will stop  working.with in no time. 9 it is a valve to feed the machine  10 the nozzle with a remote control device at the time of emergence the working of the machine can be stop by remote control the nozzle jet send the fuel to the tapper  pine.11 jet is fitted within a ring slot nozzle on which a banjo nut  is also fitted 12 banjo nut  is fitted with the ring slot nozzle and the air comes  foom the three way valve Whelps in mixing with petrol to feed the or start the  machine.13  tapper pipe HÂ£ narrow side is fitted with the ventury disc and the broad side of the tapper pipe is cloned by a cap  which have a holes in it a nozzle is fitted in the centre through the air of three way valve is  providing the air for the ignition of the air m ixed fuel in the ventary the cap has a small holes which helps in sucking the air of inside tapper pipe a diaphram is provided so that inside combustion should not leak  and fuel mixed air burn easyle as showen in the fig. the ring slot nozzle is fitted on the narrow side of the  tapper pipe on the very upper side  of the ring slot nozzle  a spindle is fitted which  helps in open and close the mouth of nozzle jet and let the fuelcome continuely for working<br>
when Priming the pump the micro switch leaver is pressed and it relegate the current to the plug in the same time the air goes to the tapper pipe to petrol tank and to the banjo nut all the functions work  samitaneasly and by opening the spendel  the machine starts with the sound of gar....gar.. like beat of the Puls its voice is very loud by adjusting<br>
the spindle .  it produce a fine voice  when the fixed ventury is became hot than the formulation which have also pressure by sending the air from the tapper pipe the flow of the chemical come to the ventury by opening the valves it started  making fog.<br>
Fog can be used for plant protection, whare house and public health, godowns where there is piller type godowns for that a  follded ladder dan fitted which can increase its leangth from the ground to cover the area,the machine can be fitted on the provided plateform.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
CLAIM<br>
