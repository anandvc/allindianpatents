The invention relates to an apparatus for forming lap and to provide constant contact force on the lap spool by increasing the contact force with increase in build of the lap. This is achieved by employing contact less regulating means during the preparation of lap in a lap package production machine so that the density of the lap is adequately uniform.<br>
The method of forming lap in known lap package production machines generally comprises rolling of lap spool or lap bobbin on two winding rollers, known as lap rollers. The lap spool is driven and pressed with predetermined force against the winding rollers. The lap spool is generally driven by friction means by the rotation of the two lap rollers. The apparatus for forming lap further comprises moveable carrier arms located on both sides of the lap rollers for receiving or supporting the lap spool, on which the lap is formed. Drive means move the carrier arms with predetermined force directed against the increasing size of the lap and in accordance with the increase in size of the lap. The laps from lap package production machine serve as a feed material for the combers. In order to obtain good result in combing process it is essential that the lap should have an even or uniform web and the density of the lap should be adequately uniform. To achieve this, the lap must be pressed against the lap rollers under uniform pressure irrespective of the diameter of the lap. Basically, the lap spools are supported by shafts inserted into opposite ends of the lap spools. It is known from prior art, that a force exerted by respective pneumatic cylinders on each of the two shafts provide the required lap density. Normally the pneumatic cylinders are subjected<br><br>
to constant pressure, during the entire formation of the lap. It is also known from the prior art that as the lap build up takes place, the contact pressure on the lap rollers become larger and there by the loading pressure which is applied to achieve lap density reduces proportional to the increase in the contact surface due to the lap build up. In order to hold the loading pressure constant with Increase in contact surface, the load applied to the lap must be increased proportionally in accordance with the increase in lap size. Pressure reducing valves are used conventionally to modify the pressure exerted on the pneumatic cylinders of the carrier arm in conjunction with wedge shaped controller for operating the pressure reducing valves and maintaining substantially constant contact force on the lap by increasing the contact force with increasing build up of the lap. The method of using wedge shaped controller in contact with pressure reducing valves may necessitate frequent adjustment due to wear and tear.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide constant contact force on the lap by increasing the contact force with increase in the build of the lap by employing contact less regulating means. By the use of contact less regulating means, the lap produced on lap package production machine will be adequately uniform.<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings :<br>
Fig 1 shows the side view of the apparatus according to the invention.<br><br>
Fig 2 shows the front view of the apparatus according to the invention.<br>
The invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
The apparatus for forming lap comprises plurality of guide head assembly consisting of guide heads (1), top traverse (2) and bottom traverse (3). The top traverse (2) and bottom traverse (3) are rigidly fastened to the guide head (1) .One end of the lap disc shaft (4) Is mounted to the guide head (1). On the other end of the lap disc shaft (4) the lap discs (5) are rotate ably mounted on antifriction bearings. The lap disc shafts (4) are located in the guide head such that the axes of the lap discs are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the guide heads to accommodate the spool for lap build up between them. The lap disc shafts (4) are disposed for operating with the lap discs holding the empty lap spools resting on lap rollers (13, 14) driven during the lap build up process and to leave the lap freely on the lap rollers for doffing after the built up is completed.<br>
Housings (6) with linear bearings mounted on it are rigidly fitted to the guide heads (1) such that the axes of the housings are parallel to each other to facilitate guiding of the guide head assembly on the guide shafts (8). Supports (7) is rigidly fitted to the frame of the lap package production machine and disposed such that the guide shaft (8) can be fitted to the same to provide guide means for the guide<br><br>
head assembly in conjunction with linear bearings fitted in the housings (6). Cylinder holders (11) are rigidly connected to the guide heads and the piston (12) of the loading cylinder (10) is rigidly fitted to it. The loading cylinder (10) is hinged to supports (9), which are rigidly fitted on to the frame of the lap package production machine. The above configuration is disposed such that the guide head assembly can freely move on the guide shafts and exert load on to the lap spool or lap resting on the lap rollers, when the loading cylinders are actuated by electro pneumatic means.<br>
In order to maintain uniform load on the lap, during the lap build up process, the invention uses an electronic controller means. The electronic controller monitor constant load on the lap in cooperation with the loading cylinders. Measuring means are provided for continuously measuring the length of the lap wound on the lap spool. For this purpose the invention measure the rotational speed of the lap roller input drive shaft using suitable sensor (S). From the signal received, from the sensor (S) Vi'hich is proportional to the length of the lap wound, the electronic controller determine the diameter of the lap package from time to time. The information is provided to a micro processor which regulates an automatic electronic pressure regulator. The pressure regulator is preferably a proportional valve, which increase the supply air pressure of the loading cylinders. By this means the load applied to the lap is increased proportional to the increase in lap size and the holding pressure is held at constant level through out the lap build up process.<br><br>
