3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to a microwave oven, more particularly to a<br>
microwave oven which has the first heating means installed at an upper portion of a cooking<br>
chamber and the second heating means installed at a lower portion of the cooking chamber,<br>
such that a structure of the microwave oven is simplified.<br>
Generally, as shown in FIG. 1, a microwave oven includes a main body 1, a cooking<br>
chamber 2, and a turntable 3. The main body 1 substantially has a rectangular shape. The<br>
cooking chamber 2 is formed in the main body 1 to prevent a propagation of microwave.<br>
And, the turntable 3 on which food is put is rotated by a motor 4 installed in the cooking<br>
chamber 2.<br>
Further, the microwave oven includes a magnetron 5, a high voltage transformer 7, a<br>
cooling fan 6, a heater 8, and a hot blown air heater 8a. The magnetron 5 generates a high<br>
frequency wave and provides the high frequency wave into the cooking chamber 2. The high<br>
voltage transformer 7, which is installed in the main body 1, applies a high voltage to the<br>
magnetron 5. The cooling fan 6 is installed in the main body 1 for cooling the magnetron 5<br>
and the high voltage transformer 7. The heater 8 and the hot blown air heater 8a are<br>
respectively installed at an upper portion and a rear portion of the cooking chamber 2 to cook<br>
food with hot air.<br>
The above prior microwave oven allows a user to cook food by various cooking<br><br>
methods that, for example, include an oven cooking in which only the magnetron 5 is used, a<br>
grill cooking in which food is heated by both the heater 8 and the hot blown air heater 8a,<br>
and convection cooking in which the oven and a grill are operated simultaneously. That is, in<br>
the oven cooking, when the magnetron 5 is operated such that food is put on the turntable 3,<br>
the high frequency wave oscillates in the cooking chamber 2.<br>
At this time, the food is heated as the high frequency wave is directly propagated into<br>
the food. In the grill cooking, the food is grilled by the heater 8. Also, when the hot blown<br>
air heater 8a is driven, air is provided to the hot blown air heater 8a by a fan. As the air<br>
passes through the hot blown air heater 8a, the air is converted into a hot blown air. Then,<br>
the hot blown air is introduced into the cooking chamber 2 through a hot blown air<br>
circulating hole 8d, such that the food in the cooking chamber 2 is indirectly grilled.<br>
However, since lower portions of the food are not heated, the grill cooking has the<br>
defect that the food is not uniformly grilled. That is, since the heater 8 is placed over the<br>
food when the food is on the turntable 3, the lower portions of the food are not exposed to<br>
the heater 8. Therefore, it is a problem that the food is grilled partially. Also, in the<br>
convection cooking, a width between the turntable 3 and a bottom plate 9 of the cooking<br>
chamber is so narrow that a sufficient quantity of the hot blown air generated by the hot<br>
blown air heater 8a is not introduced into the cooking chamber 2. So, in case of foods, such<br>
as bread, cookie, etc., cooked particularly by the hot blown air, the bottoms of the foods are<br>
not heated. For overcoming the above problem, while cooking food, the food must be made<br>
turned over. Recently, there has been proposed a technique for grilling food uniformly in<br>
which a grill at which the food is fixed is rotated. However, the prior technique has resulted<br>
in structural complexity. Also, it is very dangerous to turn the food over during cooking<br>
because the temperature in the cooking chamber during cooking is very high.<br><br>
On the other hand, the hot blown air heater 8a is operated in the convection cooking.<br>
While the hot blown air is introduced into the cooking chamber 2, if external air enters the<br>
cooking chamber 2, the temperature in the cooking chamber 2 may decrease. Thus, a suction<br>
hole 8b is formed at a side wall of the cooking chamber 2. The suction hole 8b is either<br>
opened or closed by a damper 8c so that external air can not enter. This causes the structure<br>
to be complicated and curtails the production efficiency for reasons of assembling the<br>
damper 8c and the suction hole 8b.<br>
Further, since the heater 8 is fixed on the upper portion of the cooking chamber 2, it<br>
is difficult to clean up the ceiling of the cooking chamber 2. That is, when cooking foods and<br>
the cooking chamber 2 is splattered with oil causing contamination or it becomes sooty by<br>
smoke, though it is possible to clean up the bottom and the side walls of the cooking chamber<br>
2, it is difficult to clean up the ceiling because of obstruction by the heater 8 fixed at the<br>
ceiling.<br>
Also, when a height of food is low, this structure is very inefficient since it takes<br>
much more heat to cook the food distant from the heater 8.<br>
Further, since it takes up a larger space to install the hot blown air heater 8a at the<br>
back of the rear plate of the cooking chamber 2, this structure is restricted in space and is not<br>
economical.<br>
Taking the above problems into consideration has resulted in this invention, and one<br>
object of this invention is to provide a microwave oven of which structure is simplified. The<br>
microwave oven includes a first heating means installed at an upper portion of a cooking<br>
chamber for heating an upper portion of food and a second heating means installed at a lower<br>
portion of the cooking chamber for heating a lower portion of the food which is placed on a<br>
turntable.<br><br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a microwave oven which can<br>
separate the first heating means from the ceiling of the cooking chamber by allowing the first<br>
heating means to pivot, such that it is possible to clean the cooking chamber and to transfer<br>
the first heating means closer to a low level of food for cooking the food with a small amount<br>
of heat.<br>
In order to achieve the above objects, the present invention includes a main body<br>
having a cooking chamber which is opened or closed by a door, a magnetron for generating a<br>
high frequency microwave and outputting the high frequency microwave to the inside of the<br>
cooking chamber, a first heating means installed at an upper portion of the cooking chamber<br>
for heating an upper portion of food, and a second heating means installed at an lower<br>
portion of the cooking chamber for heating a lower portion of the food.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be illustrated below with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of a microwave oven according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
In FIG. 2, the microwave oven includes a main body 10, a cooking chamber 11, a<br>
door 12, and a turntable 13. The main body 10 is substantially rectangular shaped. The<br>
cooking chamber 11 is formed in the main body 10. The cooking chamber 11 has an<br>
openning on the front side through which food is inputted to or outputted from the cooking<br>
chamber 11. The door 12 is installed at the opened front side to open or close the cooking<br>
chamber 11. When the door 12 is closed and microwaves are generated, the door 12 prevents<br>
the microwaves from escaping the cooking chamber 11 to the outside. The turntable 13 on<br>
which food is put is mounted on a floor plate of the cooking chamber 11 and able to rotate.<br>
On the other hand, the turntable 13 is driven by a motor 15 which is installed at a<br><br>
motor fixing bracket 15b. A rotary shaft 15a of the motor 15 is connected with a bearing 16<br>
installed at the central portion of the turntable 13, such that a turning effect of the motor 15 is<br>
transferred to a guide 14. Further, the plurality of wheels are radially installed at a lower<br>
surface of the guide 14. The turntable 13 is mounted on the guide 14. The first heating means<br>
20 is installed at an upper portion of the cooking chamber 11. The second heating means 30<br>
is installed under the inside of the main body 10 to heat a lower portion of food.<br>
The second heating means 30 heats the lower surface of the turntable 13 which is in<br>
contact with the guide 14, such that the food on the turntable 13 is indirectly heated. Upper<br>
and lower surfaces of the turntable 13 and the guide 14 are coated with a bio-ceramic<br>
material 50, respectively. The bio-ceramic coatings are heated to radiate far-infrared rays as<br>
the second heating means 30 heats the lower surface of the turntable 13. When the far-<br>
infrared rays are radiated to the food on the turntable, the food is activated to cause the lower<br>
surface of food to be heated uniformly, such that the cooking efficiency is improved.<br>
Thermal insulation layers 40 and 41 are formed by charging a ceiling plate 11a and a rear<br>
plate lid of the cooking chamber with air, such that a thermal loss is reduced while the first<br>
and second heating means 20 and 30 operate.<br>
FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of the first heating means, and FIG. 4 is a sectional<br>
view taken along lines A-A of FIG. 3. The first heating means 20 includes a heater 21, a<br>
bushing 22, a bracket 23, a guiding plate 25, and a protrusion 23a. The heater 21 heats up<br>
when electric power is applied to the heater 21. The bushing 22 is formed at one side end of<br>
the heater 21 and allows the heater 21 to be able to pivot thereon. The bracket 23 fixes the<br>
bushing 22 on a side plate 11c of the cooking chamber to pivot thereon. The bracket 23 is<br>
fixed on the side plate 11c by means of a fixing screw 24a. The protrusion 23a is formed at<br>
one side of the bracket 23 to be locked into a pair of grooves 25a which are formed at one<br><br>
side of the guiding plate 25 at an angle. That is, when the protrusion 23a is inserted into an<br>
upper groove 25a, the heater 21 is level with the ceiling plate 11a of the cooking chamber.<br>
And, when the protrusion 23a is inserted into a lower groove 25a, the heater 21 becomes<br>
more distant from the ceiling plate 11a of the cooking chamber, such that it is easy to clean<br>
the ceiling plate 11a. Furthermore, when the heater 21 is lowered in position, efficiency to<br>
heat a lower level of food improves. Also, the bracket 23 is upwardly inclined toward the<br>
guide plate 25, such that the protrusion 23a adheres closely to the grooves 23.<br>
FIG. 5 is a perspective and exploded view of the second heating means according to<br>
the present invention. The second heating means includes a plurality of thermal-radiating<br>
holes 31, a case 32 and a heater 33. The plurality of thermal-radiating holes 31 are formed at<br>
the floor plate 11b of the cooking chamber. The plurality of thermal-radiating holes 31 are<br>
formed to prevent small fragments from inputting to the second heating means when cleaning<br>
the floor plate 11b of the cooking chamber toward the lower surface of the guide 14. The<br>
case 32 is fixed on the lower surface of the floor plate 11b of the cooking chamber to<br>
surround the plurality of thermal-radiating holes 31. The heater 33 is installed in the case 32<br>
to be heated by applying electric power thereto. On the other hand, a pair of hooking<br>
projections 32b are formed at a rear portion of an upper end of the case 32. The pair of<br>
hooking projections 32b are coupled with a pair of hooking jaws 34 formed on the floor plate<br>
11b of the cooking chamber. A forward portion of the upper end is fixed on the floor plate<br>
11b of the cooking chamber by a screw 35. The heater 33 is substantially U-shaped. The<br>
heater 33 is inserted into a hole 32a which is formed at one side of the case 32, and is fixed<br>
on the case 32.<br>
FIG. 6 is a top-sectional view of the microwave according to the present invention. In<br>
FIG. 6, a magnetron is installed at one side plate 11c of the cooking chamber for generating<br><br>
a high frequency microwave and providing the microwave into the cooking chamber 11. A<br>
fan 18 and a motor 19 are installed at the rear plate 11d of the cooking chamber 11 for<br>
blowing air into the cooking chamber 11. And, the side plate 11c of the cooking chamber 11c<br>
has a plurality of holes 11e through which the blowing air is introduced to the cooking<br>
chamber 11.<br>
In the above construction according to the present invention, when the door 12 is<br>
closed after food is placed on the turntable 13, the cooking chamber 11 is sealed from the<br>
outside. At this time, the plurality of thermal-radiating holes 31 formed at the floor plate 11b<br>
of the cooking chamber are covered by the case 32, such that leakage of microwave is<br>
prevented. When the magnetron 17 is operated, the microwave is emitted into the cooking<br>
chamber 11 to propagate into the food. The microwave causes the food to be activated, such<br>
that the food is cooked. On the other hand, as the bearing 16 is rotated by the motor 15, the<br>
guide 14 is rotated with the turntable 13. Since the turntable 13 rotates, the microwave is<br>
uniformly applied to the food, such that cooking efficiency improves.<br>
Upon putting food on the turntable 13 closely adhering to the guide 14 in a grill<br>
cooking, when the first heating means 20 is operated, upper portions of the food are heated<br>
by the heater 21 heating. At this time, when the second heating means 30 is operated, the<br>
lower portion of turntable 13 is heated through the guide 14 by the heater 33 heating. That is,<br>
when the heater 33 is heated, thermal air spreads through the plurality of thermal-heating<br>
holes 31 into the cooking chamber 11, such that the turntable 13 which is placed over the<br>
plurality of thermal-heating holes 31 is heated. When the turntable 13 is heated, the lower<br>
portion of the food put on the turntable 13 is heated to cook the food uniformly. Since, the<br>
turntable 13 is rotated, and at the same time the thermal air passes through the plurality of<br>
thermal-heating holes 31, the lower portion of the food is not heated partially.<br><br>
As the lower surface of the turntable 13 is heated by the heater 33, the bio-ceramic 50<br>
coated on the lower surface is heated to generate a far-infrared. The far-infrared is radiated<br>
into the food, such that the cooking efficiency improves. Further, according to the present<br>
invention, it is possible to cook various menus. That is, in convection cooking, it is possible<br>
to operate either the heater 21 at the upper portion and the magnetron 17 or the heater 33 at<br>
the lower portion and the magnetron 17. And, the convection cooking may be performed by<br>
operating the magnetron 17 and the two heaters 21 and 33 at the same time.<br>
On the other hand, in grill cooking, it is possible to control the cooking state of food<br>
by selectively operating the heater 33 at the lower portion. Further, only by operating the<br>
heater 33 at the lower portion, fermentation of food is possible. That is, since the heater 33<br>
at the lower portion heats the lower surface of the turntable 13, the food on the turntable 33<br>
is indirectly heated to make it possible to ferment the food. After completing the grill<br>
cooking and when cleaning the cooking chamber 11, since the heater 21 can be moved away<br>
from the ceiling plate 11a by rotating the heater 21 step by step, the cooking chamber 11 can<br>
be conveniently cleaned. It is possible to cook the food with efficiency by controlling the<br>
position of heater 21 according to the height of food, such that thermal efficiency is<br>
improved.<br>
As above mentioned, according to the present invention, during grill cooking, the<br>
upper and lower portions of food are uniformly grilled by selectively operating the lower<br>
heater while the upper heater is operated. Since there is no need of a barbecue function to<br>
rotate food whole, the structure of the microwave oven is simplified. And, the microwave<br>
oven according to the present invention has the effect of providing various cooking methods,<br>
such as food fermentation using only the lower heater. Further, while prior microwave oven<br>
needs a space for installing a thermal-blown air heater at a rear portion of a cooking chamber,<br><br>
a microwave oven according to the present invention does not need any space for installation,<br>
such that a reduction infthe volume of the microwave oven occurs.<br><br>
