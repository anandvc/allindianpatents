				<td>The present invention relates to process and apparatus for the continuous production of a thin metal strip.<br>
The invention relates to a process and an apparatus for the continuous production of a thin metal strip, in particular a steel hot strip, directly from a metal melt and with a strip cast thickness of 
In particular,  the invention relates to a process	and an<br>
apparatus for producing a hot-rolled steel strip with	a strip<br>
cast thickness of 
strip is stored following the rolling deformation is	between<br>
0.3 and 4 mm.<br>
The proposed roll-casting processes on which the invention is based encompass all types of casting processes in which metal melt is solidified on the. lateral surface of a casting roll so as to continuously form a metal strip. Both the single-roll casting process using a single-roll casting device and the vertical or horizontal two-roll casting process using a two-roll casting device are suitable for implementing the invention. It is also appropriate for the axes of the two interacting casting rolls to be arranged in a plane that is inclined obliquely with respect to the horizontal in order to implement the process according to the invention.<br>
In a vertical two-roll casting process, metal melt is introduced into a melt space which is laterally delimited by two rotating casting rolls and associated side plates, with the axes of rotation of the casting rolls lying substantially in one horizontal plane. The two casting rolls with the associated side plates, including the necessary actuating and control devices, in this case form the core component of the two-roll casting device. The metal melt solidifies continuously at the<br>
lateral surfaces of the rotating, internally cooled casting<br>
rolls and forms strand shells which are moved with the lateral<br>
surfaces. In the narrowest cross section between the two<br>
casting rolls, the two strand shells are joined to form an at<br>
least substantially fully solidified metal strip. The cast<br>
metal strip is<br>
discharged at casting speed between the casting rolls and then<br>
fed for in-line thickness reduction in a rolling installation.<br>
Then, the rolled hot strip is fed to a storage device, in which<br>
it is stored. This process is preferably suitable for the<br>
production of steel strip, but it is also possible for metal<br>
strips made from aluminium or an aluminium alloy to be produced<br>
in this way. The basic principles of processes and<br>
installations of this type are already known, for example from<br>
WO 01/94049 or WO 03/035291.<br>
To ensure further processing without any problems, flatness<br>
tolerances, which are in some cases defined in standards and in<br>
other cases are requested by customers according to the<br>
intended further processing, have to be maintained by the<br>
rolled hot strip. Experience gained in the production of hotrolled<br>
steel strip has shown that it is very difficult to<br>
satisfy these requirements when using the two-roll casting<br>
process on a corresponding casting installation.<br>
Standard values for the flatness of thin hot strip are defined<br>
in standards (e.g. DIN 10051) and for rolled hot strip have<br>
values of from 20 to 30 I units for the thickness range<br>
described in the introduction.<br>
One major cause of difficulties in achieving standard flatness<br>
values results from the high production speed with the<br>
production process selected for the cast intermediate product.<br>
The metal strip is produced in a process with extremely high<br>
solidification rates directly in a format with extreme<br>
width/thickness ratios, which although eliminating a large<br>
number of roll passes with a view to achieving the desired hot<br>
strip final thickness, means that width-independent, uniform<br>
convective heat transfer or liquid metal temperature at the<br>
solidification front (when forming the strand shells) are only<br>
possible to a limited extent, on account of the highly<br>
turbulent flow conditions in the metal bath. This results in a<br>
temperature/width profile on the cast metal strip when it<br>
emerges from the casting nip between the casting rolls which is<br>
subject to fluctuations of up to 100% and above, based on the<br>
supercooling with respect to the equilibrium solidus<br>
temperature, so that internal stress conditions and creep<br>
properties which cause unevenness in the cast strip are<br>
present. Unevenness which lies outside the hot strip standard<br>
is produced even if the fluctuation is only in a range from<br>
30-40%.<br>
The in-line rolling of a cast metal strip can also contribute<br>
to the formation of further unevenness if the strip inlet<br>
temperature (temperature at which the metal strip enters the<br>
rolling stand) is relatively uneven over the width of the metal<br>
strip or the inlet strip profile is unknown or fluctuates. This<br>
results in variable deformation properties in the roll nip as a<br>
result, of different spring properties or roll nip profiles<br>
transversely with respect to the rolling direction.<br>
When it first enters a rolling stand, the cast metal strip has<br>
an entry microstructure with a cast structure which with a low<br>
reduction per pass is converted into a more fine-grained rolled<br>
microstructure, in order to achieve the materials properties<br>
which are favourable for the respective further processing<br>
steps. At the same time, the starting thickness upstream of the<br>
rolling stand is less than 10 mm, preferably less than 6 mm. At<br>
the low starting thicknesses preferred, it is not possible to<br>
influence the relative strip profile without any flatness<br>
defects. Furthermore, the high roughness of the metal strip,<br>
caused by the casting operation and by any scaling, leads to a<br>
high level of wear to the working rolls. These wear phenomena<br>
on the working rolls occur to an increased extent in the region<br>
of the strip edges and lead to defects in the strip profile. In<br>
this context, apart from the strip thickness and the<br>
temperature level, the wear phenomena are also influenced to a<br>
considerable extent by the strip material, the strip profile<br>
and the thermal profile.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to avoid<br>
these drawbacks which have been described and to propose a<br>
process and an apparatus with which it is possible to produce a<br>
high-quality, hot-rolled metal strip having a comparable<br>
profile of properties, in particular with regard to the desired<br>
flatness tolerances, to those which can currently be achieved<br>
in the production of hot-rolled metal strip, in particular<br>
steel strip, from continuous-cast thin slabs or slabs, at cast<br>
thicknesses of between 40 and 300 mm, using rolling devices<br>
corresponding to the prior art, according to the invention in a<br>
continuous production process starting directly from metal melt<br>
aind a strip cast thickness of less than 10 mm.<br>
The comparable profile of properties of a high-quality hotrolled<br>
metal strip encompasses in particular:<br>
• the homogeneity of the metal strip produced, in<br>
particular the mechanical properties of the metal strip<br>
in the transverse and longitudinal directions and<br>
throughout the entire production,<br>
• the achievement of flatness values similar to the<br>
values which are currently prescribed and can be<br>
achieved in practice for hot strip, if appropriate<br>
after passing through a cold strip manufacturing line,<br>
• a surface appearance and roughness values close to<br>
those which can be achieved in conventional production<br>
processes,<br>
• compliance with geometric demands relating to further<br>
surface-treating or shaping processing steps.<br>
In a process of the type described in the introduction, this<br>
object is achieved by virtue of the fact that a flatness<br>
measurement is performed on the moving metal strip, and the<br>
flatness measured values from this flatness measurement are<br>
used to influence the flatness of the metal strip in a targeted<br>
way. The influencing of the flatness of the metal strip may in<br>
this case take place either during the formation of the metal<br>
strip between the lateral surfaces of the two casting rolls or<br>
during the in-line thickness reduction by way of a control<br>
circuit or alternatively by manual intervention. The flatness<br>
measurement is carried out over the distance between the rollcasting<br>
device, formed by at least one casting roll, and the<br>
storage device, in a plane which is transverse with respect to<br>
the strip-running direction.<br>
The in-line thickness reduction of the metal strip is carried<br>
out in at least one deformation stage in an at least singlestand<br>
rolling installation, and the flatness measurement is<br>
carried out before or after at least one of these deformation<br>
stages, preferably immediately after the first deformation<br>
stage.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the flatness measurement<br>
is carried out by determining the stress distribution in the<br>
metal strip in a plane lying transversely with respect to the<br>
conveying direction.<br>
It is expedient for the measured values from the flatness<br>
measurement to be used to influence the roll nip in at least<br>
one rolling stand of the rolling installation. The measured<br>
flatness values, which may have been processed in a central<br>
processing unit, are used for closed loop flatness control, in<br>
which components of the rolling stand, or devices mounted<br>
substantially directly upstream of the rolling stand, are used<br>
to influence the roll nip and/or to influence state variables<br>
of the metal strip.<br>
The roll nip in the rolling stands is influenced by at least<br>
one of the following measures:<br>
working roll bending,<br>
working roll displacement,<br>
at least zonal thermal influencing of the roll barrel or<br>
of the working rolls.<br>
Equally, the measured values from the flatness measurement can<br>
be used for at least zonal thermal influencing of the metal<br>
strip.<br>
Another way of generating control signals for the flatness<br>
control circuit from the flatness measured values is to use the<br>
measured values from the flatness measurement to influence the<br>
surface profile of the at least one casting roll.<br>
In addition to the flatness measurement, a further improvement<br>
of the flatness tolerances on the hot strip produced is<br>
achieved by virtue of the fact that a temperature profile of<br>
the metal strip is determined in a plane lying transversely<br>
with respect to the conveying direction of the metal strip at<br>
least before or after the rolling installation, and the<br>
measured temperature profile is used to influence the flatness<br>
of the hot strip in a targeted way.<br>
Local temperature deviations in the hot strip which occur in<br>
longitudinally oriented zones can be specifically influenced if<br>
the temperature distribution in the metal strip is influenced<br>
in sections in a plane lying transversely with respect to the<br>
conveying direction of the metal strip as a function of the<br>
measured temperature profile. The more independently<br>
controllable cooling or heating zones are arranged transversely<br>
with respect to the strip running direction, the better the<br>
temperature profile can be controlled at the cast metal strip.<br>
Another way of making the flatness of the metal strip more<br>
uniform consists in additionally measuring the strip thickness<br>
profile in a plane lying transversely with respect to the<br>
conveying direction of the metal strip, and using the measured<br>
strip thickness profile to influence the flatness of the hot<br>
strip in a targeted way.<br>
The invention is preferably employed in the production of a<br>
metal strip using the two-roll casting process, in particular<br>
the vertical two-roll casting process, in which case a<br>
flatness-measuring device for recording flatness measured<br>
values of the metal strip is arranged between the roll-casting<br>
device and the storage device,<br>
- 6 -<br>
and the flatness-measuring device is assigned an evaluation<br>
device for recording and converting the flatness measured<br>
values determined.<br>
The object according to the invention is also achieved by an<br>
apparatus for the continuous production of a thin metal strip,<br>
in particular a steel hot strip, directly from a metal melt and<br>
having a strip thickness of 
device, having an at least single-stand rolling installation<br>
arranged downstream and having a storage device for storing the<br>
rolled metal strip, if a flatness-measuring device for<br>
recording flatness measured values of the metal strip is<br>
arranged between the roll-casting device and the storage<br>
device, and if the flatness-measuring device is assigned an<br>
evaluation device for recording and converting the flatness<br>
measured values.<br>
Expediently, the flatness-measuring device for recording<br>
flatness measured values is arranged in a plane which is<br>
transverse with respect to the conveying direction of the metal<br>
strip.<br>
Preferably, the? flatness-measuring device is arranged upstream<br>
or downstream of a rolling stand of an at least single-stand<br>
rolling installation. In the case of a multi-stand rolling mill<br>
train, the flatness-measuring device is arranged upstream or<br>
preferably downstream of the first rolling stand.<br>
The flatness measurement can be carried out using various<br>
flatness-measuring devices which are commercially available.<br>
Measuring devices of this type are mostly known for determining<br>
flatness values from cold strip production, and consequently<br>
suitable adaptations with regard to thermal stability and<br>
measurement accuracy at high temperatures are required for the<br>
specific application of hot strip at rolling temperature. For<br>
flatness measurement, in the hot region, the flatness-measuring<br>
device is preferably formed by a flatness-measuring roller, a<br>
device for optically recording shape or a device for recording<br>
other inhomogeneities in strip surface properties. In the case<br>
of flatness measurement using a flatness-measuring roller, the<br>
metal strip is generally under strip tension, which is taken<br>
into account during evaluation of the measurement results in<br>
the evaluation device. In the case of optical recording of the<br>
shape of the metal strip, the metal strip must not be under<br>
strip tension if good measurement results are to be achieved.<br>
Flatness-measuring devices which are employed in conventional<br>
cold-rolling and hot-rolling devices are already known from<br>
DE 37<br>
21 746 Al, US 6,606,919 B2, US 2002/0178840 Al and<br>
US 2002/0080851 Al, where their structure is described in<br>
detail .<br>
The evaluation device, preferably a central processing unit, is<br>
connected, via signal lines for transmitting control variables,<br>
to at least one of the following actuating devices for<br>
influencing the roll nip in the rolling stands:<br>
a bending block for working roll bending,<br>
a working roll displacement device,<br>
a heating/cooling device for zoned direct or indirect<br>
thermal influencing of the roll barrel,<br>
a heating/cooling device for at least zoned thermal<br>
influencing of the metal strip.<br>
As an alternative or in addition, the evaluation device is<br>
connected via signal lines to at least one of the following<br>
actuating devices for influencing the surface profile of the at<br>
least one casting roll:<br>
a heating/cooling device for zoned direct or indirect<br>
thermal influencing of the casting roll barrel,<br>
preferably hydraulically actuable deformation device at<br>
the casting roll for applying radially acting deformation<br>
forces,<br>
a gas purge device for zoned influencing of the strand<br>
shell solidification conditions at the casting roll barrel,<br>
a coating device for zoned coating of the casting roll<br>
barrel with a coating agent which influences the heat transfer<br>
or the nucleation density in order to influence the strand<br>
shell solidification conditions,<br>
a cleaning device for zoned cleaning of the casting roll<br>
barrel for zoned influencing of the strand shell solidification<br>
conditions at the casting roll barrel.<br>
To achieve flatness values in a very narrow tolerance range, a<br>
temperature-measuring device for recording the temperature<br>
profile of the metal strip is additionally arranged just in<br>
front of or just behind at least one rolling stand of the<br>
rolling installation, in a plane which lies transversely with<br>
respect to the conveying direction of the metal strip, and this<br>
temperature-meiisuring device is assigned an evaluation device<br>
for recording and converting the measured values. This<br>
temperature measurement should be carried out at a short<br>
distance, preferably<br>
immediately, upstream of the first rolling stand, in order for<br>
the conditions in the rolling nip to be reproduced as<br>
accurately as possible.<br>
Expediently, the temperature-measuring device is arranged<br>
upstream of the rolling installation, and the evaluation device<br>
is connected, via signal lines for transmitting control<br>
variables, to a strip-heating device or strip-cooling device,<br>
in order to make the temperature profile more uniform.<br>
Another possible way of minimizing flatness deviations on the<br>
hot strip consists in the fact that a strip thickness profile<br>
measuring device for determining the strip thickness profile is<br>
arranged in a plane lying transversely with respect to the<br>
conveying direction of the metal strip, and this strip<br>
thickness measuring device is assigned an evaluation device for<br>
recording and converting the measured values.<br>
The evaluation device is connected, via signal lines for<br>
transmitting control variables, to at least one of the<br>
following actuating devices for influencing the strip thickness<br>
profile in the rolling stands:<br>
a working roll adjustment device,<br>
a bending block for working roll bending,<br>
a working roll displacement device,<br>
a heating/cooling device for zoned direct or indirect<br>
thermal influencing of the roll barrel.<br>
Furthermore, the evaluation device may be individually<br>
connected, via signal lines, to at least one of the following<br>
actuating devices for influencing the strip thickness profile<br>
by means of the at least one casting roll:<br>
a casting roll adjustment device,<br>
a heating/cooling device for zoned thermal influencing of<br>
the casting roll barrel,<br>
preferably hydraulically actuable deformation device at<br>
the casting roll for applying radially acting deformation<br>
forces,<br>
a gas purge device for zoned influencing of the strand<br>
shell solidification conditions at the casting roll barrel,<br>
a coating device for zoned coating of the casting roll<br>
barrel with a coating agent which influences the heat transfer<br>
or the nucleation density in order to influence the strand<br>
shell solidification conditions,<br>
a cleaning device for zoned cleaning of the casting roll<br>
barrel for zoned influencing of the strand shell solidification<br>
conditions at the casting roll barrel.<br>
The measurement results of the flatness measurement, or<br>
alternatively of a number of flatness measurements along the<br>
production line, can be used for influencing the flatness of<br>
the metal strip in a targeted way exclusively in at least one<br>
rolling stand or exclusively in the roll-casting device, or<br>
alternatively in combination on both these devices. In<br>
addition, it is also possible to influence the flatness of the<br>
metal strip by means of associated devices, such as for example<br>
a strip-heating device.<br>
The roll-casting device is preferably designed to implement the<br>
two-roll casting process in accordance with the invention and<br>
comprises two casting rolls driven in rotation and two side<br>
plates, which together form a melt space for holding metal melt<br>
and a casting gap for forming the cross-sectional format of a<br>
cast metal strip.<br>
The implementation of the process according to the invention as<br>
described above in a semi-industrial test installation has<br>
managed to reduce the flatness deviations by up to 50% even<br>
after just a few tests.<br>
F'urther advantages and features of the present invention will<br>
emerge from the following description of figures illustrating<br>
non-limiting exemplary embodiments, in which reference is made<br>
to the appended figures in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a production installation according to the<br>
invention for producing thin hot strip, having a tworoll<br>
casting device and a single-stand rolling<br>
installation, including a flatness-measuring device,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a production installation according to the<br>
invention for thin hot strip having a two-roll casting<br>
device and a multi-stand rolling installation,<br>
including a flatness-measuring device.<br>
Epigures 1 and 2 illustrate two embodiments of an installation<br>
for producing a steel hot strip in the form of a diagrammatic<br>
longitudinal section comprising the main components of the<br>
installation, as well as measurement and control devices for<br>
the<br>
- 10 -<br>
production of a thin hot strip within the flatness tolerances<br>
which are customary for thin hot strip. The basic structure of<br>
the installation is the same when producing a nonferrous metal<br>
strip.<br>
In a two-roll casting device 1, steel melt is introduced into a<br>
melt space 4, which is formed by two internally cooled,<br>
oppositely rotating casting rolls 2 and two side plates 3<br>
positioned at the end sides of the casting rolls, and a cast<br>
steel strip 5 with a predetermined cross-sectional format is<br>
discharged vertically downwards from a casting gap formed by<br>
the casting rolls 2 and the side plates 3. After the steel<br>
strip has been diverted into a horizontal conveying direction,<br>
the cast steel strip is subjected to a reduction in thickness<br>
and change in microstructure in a rolling installation 6 and<br>
then fed to a storage device 7. Depending on the steel grade,<br>
casting thickness and final thickness of the hot strip, the<br>
rolling installation 6 is designed as a single-stand rolling<br>
installation 8 (Fig. 1), for example for strip steel with low<br>
quality requirements, or as a multi-stand rolling mill train 9<br>
(Fig. 2), for example for the production of high-quality steel<br>
grades with a greater degree of reduction and with particular<br>
demands imposed on surface quality and deformation properties.<br>
The storage device 1 comprises a coiler for winding the hot<br>
strip into coils and may also be integrated in a coiling<br>
furnace. A strip driver 10 for setting a strip tension during<br>
coiling and strip shears are mounted upstream of the storage<br>
device.<br>
To set a constant rolling temperature upstream of the first<br>
rolling stand, the steel strip passes through a strip-heating<br>
device 12 which is mounted upstream of the first rolling stand<br>
11 and may also comprise a cooling device. The strip-heating<br>
device 12 allows zoned influencing of the temperature of the<br>
steel strip transversely with respect to the strip-running<br>
direction, for example increased heating of the strip edges if<br>
excessive cooling has already occurred in this region. A<br>
temperature-measuring device 13, which is used to continuously<br>
record the strip temperature in a plurality of zones in a plane<br>
located transversely with respect to the strip-running<br>
direction and to control the strip-heating device 12, is<br>
mounted directly upstream of the first rolling stand 11. The<br>
strip driver 14 keeps the steel strip under strip tension, and<br>
if appropriate also centres it, in the strip-heating device 12<br>
and as far as the first rolling stand 11. A strip thickness<br>
profile measuring device 15 measures the strip thickness of the<br>
cast steel strip leaving the two-roll casting installation,<br>
this strip thickness being preset using a casting-roll control<br>
device 16 or corrected according to the measurement results.<br>
A flatness-measuring device 18, which is used to record the<br>
flatness profile on the steel strip in a plane transverse with<br>
respect to the strip-running direction is arranged a short<br>
distance downstream of the first and only rolling stand 11 in<br>
the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 and the first rolling stand 11<br>
in the embodiment shown in Fig. 2. Flatness deviations result<br>
either from thickness deviations over the strip width or from<br>
waviness in the strip. The flatness-measuring device 18<br>
comprises a flatness-measuring roller 19 adapted for use at hot<br>
temperatures. A flatness-measuring roller as can be used<br>
according to the invention is described in detail in American<br>
Patent US 6,606,919 B2. The corresponding measuring method for<br>
determining flatness deviations is described in Application<br>
US 2002/0178840 Al and can also be employed here. The measured<br>
values determined are fed to an evaluation device 20, which is<br>
formed by a central processing unit (CPU), where the<br>
measurement signals are evaluated and control signals which<br>
counteract the flatness deviations are transmitted to actuating<br>
devices 21 of the first rolling stand 11 and/or to actuating<br>
devices 22 of the two-roll casting device 1.<br>
The possible actuating devices 21 of the first rolling stand<br>
are devices which are available as standard with conventional<br>
rolling stands. The actuating device 21 may comprise a bending<br>
block for working roll bending of, for example, cylindrical<br>
working or supporting rolls, or a working roll displacement<br>
device for the axial displacement of contoured working or<br>
supporting rolls. Furthermore, heating and cooling devices for<br>
zoned thermal influencing of the roll barrel of the working<br>
rollers also constitute possible actuating devices.<br>
In subregions, flatness deviations or thickness profile<br>
deviations occur on the steel strip as early as during the<br>
formation of the steel strip in the two-roll casting device. At<br>
the low strip cast thickness, these deviations can no longer be<br>
eliminated, or only a small proportion of them can be<br>
eliminated by the subsequent roll passes. In particular, the<br>
thickness profile deviations which are produced during the<br>
formation of the steel strip can lead to flatness deviations<br>
during the roll passes. It is therefore expedient to intervene<br>
in the strip profile formation by means of an actuating device<br>
22 directly at the two-roll casting device 1 by means of<br>
closed-loop control based on the measured flatness values.<br>
Possible actuating devices 22 for influencing the surface<br>
profile of the; casting rolls at the two-roll casting device<br>
include a heating and/or cooling device for zoned direct or<br>
indirect thermal influencing of the external shape of the<br>
casting roll Darrel, preferably hydraulically actuable<br>
deformation devices at the casting rolls for applying radially<br>
acting deformation forces to the casting roll lateral surface,<br>
a gas purge device for zoned influencing of the strand shell<br>
solidification conditions at the casting roll barrels, a<br>
coating device for zoned coating of the casting roll barrels<br>
with a coating agent which influences heat transfer in order to<br>
influence the strand shell solidification conditions, or<br>
alternatively a cleaning device for zoned cleaning of the<br>
casting roll barrels for zoned influencing of the strand shell<br>
solidification conditions at the casting roll barrels.<br>
An expedient control for minimizing the flatness deviations may<br>
consist in monitoring and influencing both the profile<br>
formation during the casting process in the two-roll casting<br>
device and the profile formation or change in the first roll<br>
pass in the first rolling stand. This can be done solely by<br>
means of suitable evaluations in the evaluation device or by<br>
including a further flatness-measuring device upstream of the<br>
first rolling stand.<br>
Temperature profiles over the strip width, recorded by the<br>
temperature-measuring devices 13, 13a, 13b, and strip thickness<br>
profiles recorded using the strip thickness profile measuring<br>
devices 15, 15a can be input into a mathematical model in the<br>
evaluation device in addition to the flatness values, so that<br>
the mathematical model develops an optimum control strategy and<br>
generates corresponding control signals.<br>
The temperature profile of the cast metal strip can be recorded<br>
immediately after the strip has been formed using the<br>
temperature-measuring device 13b, which is arranged at a<br>
distance below the two casting rolls 2. This temperature<br>
profile allows conclusions to be drawn as to the strand shell<br>
formation at the roll barrel of the casting rolls and the<br>
solidification or temperature conditions prevailing at the<br>
time. Taking this temperature profile into account makes it<br>
possible, when evaluating the flatness measured values in the<br>
evaluation device, to generate control variables which are more<br>
accurately matched to the strip formation conditions, in<br>
particular for controlling the actuating devices 22 at the tworoll<br>
casting device.<br>
The measures which have been described in connection with a<br>
vertical two-roll casting device can equally be transferred to<br>
a single-roll casting device. It is preferable for a smoothing<br>
roll for conditioning the free strip surface to be assigned to<br>
the casting ro]l<br>
of the single-roll casting device, and the actuating devices<br>
for influencing the flatness can be assigned both to the<br>
casting roll and to the smoothing roll.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
