				<td>Typically, the installation includes a movable! walkway which provides an endless movable support member<br>
which is movable along an endless course, the movable walkway including an endless band operatively<br>
connected to the support member for synchrc nous movement therewith along a separate endless course such<br>
that, along a part of its course, the band provides the handrail for gripping by persons supported on the support<br>
member, the handrail being spaced above the support member and being movable in a direction parallel to the<br>
direction of movement of the support member, the disinfecting device being installed at a fixed position adjacent<br>
the course of the band and operable to provide: at least intermittent disinfection of the band as it moves past the<br>
disinfecting device.<br>
The band may be guided on its endless course by a handrail guide, the band extending peripheral along and<br>
around the handrail guide, the handrail guide fceing positioned to extend alongside and parallel to the movable<br>
support member, the disinfecting device being Dositioned and oriented to disinfect an outer surface of the band<br>
on the side thereof which is opposite from the handrail guide, its being appreciated that it is this outer surface of<br>
the band which will, in use, come into contact with the hands of users holding the handrail, and which will thus be<br>
most in need of disinfecting.<br>
The endless course of the band typically has a forward leg in which the band is spaced above the support<br>
member and is movable in the same direction as a forward supporting leg of the support member where the<br>
support member faces upwardly, and a return lag in which the band is movable in the opposite direction, the<br>
disinfecting device being positioned for disinfecting the endless band on its return leg. In most cases, the<br>
disinfecting device will thus not be visible to users; of the walkway or escalator.<br>
The disinfecting device may comprise an irradiating arrangement or an irradiating means for disinfecting the<br>
endless band by irradiating it with electromagnetic waves selected to have a disinfecting or germicidal effect.<br>
Typically, the irradiating arrangement is configjred to produce ultra-violet waves, the ultra-violet radiation<br>
preferably being middle or extreme ultra-violet radiation, having a wavelength of between 180 and 290 nm and<br>
being produced by a lamp having a wattage of 10-30 watt.<br>
The irradiating arrangement may include a housing in which a suitable source of electromagnetic radiation,<br>
typically a lamp, is housed, the housing being configured to permit passage of the endless band in a longitudinal<br>
direction through the housing.<br>
The housing may be shaped at least partially to s urround the band, when the band is viewed in cross-section,<br>
the housing having a reflective interior which is shaped such that, in use, substantially the entire exposed cross-<br>
sectional periphery of the band is subjected to disinfecting or germicidal radiation. To this end, the housing may<br>
be installed such that a slack portion of the band passes through the housing.<br><br>
Instead, the disinfecting device may be arranged to deposit a disinfectant or germicidal<br>
substance on the endless band, the disinfecting device optionally including a pad which is<br>
impregnated with the disinfectant or germicidal substance, the disinfectant device also<br>
including an urging means for urging the pad into contact with the band as the band is<br>
moved past the disinfecting device, so that the pad is configured to clean the band by<br>
abrasion and simultaneously to deposit a film of the disinfectant or germicidal substance on<br>
the band.<br>
The invention extends to a disinfecting device suitable for forming part of a moving<br>
walkway or escalator installation as defined above.<br>
The invention extends to a method of operating a movable walkway, which method includes<br>
at least intermittently disinfecting a movable handrail of the walkway by means of a<br>
disinfecting device installed at a position at or adjacent an endless course along which the<br>
handrail moves, so that the handrail is disinfected as it moves past the disinfecting device on<br>
its endless course.<br>
The method typically includes continuously disinfecting the handrail as it moves past the<br>
installed disinfecting device.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, disinfecting the handrail comprises irradiating the<br>
handrail with electromagnetic waves of which the wavelength is selected to have a<br>
germicidal or disinfectant effect.<br>
The invention extends to a method of operating a movable walkway, which method includes<br>
installing a disinfecting device adjacent the movable walkway, to form a movable walkway<br>
installation as defined above. It will be appreciated that an existing walkway or escalator<br>
can, by performance of this method, be converted to a movable walkway installation as<br>
defined above.<br><br>
The invention will now be further described, byway of example, with reference to the<br>
accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic side elevation of an escalator installation in accordance with the<br>
invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic end view of the escalator installation of Figure 1 ;<br>
Figure 3 is a detailed part-sectional schematic end elevation of a disinfecting device forming<br>
part of the escalator installation of Figure 2, on an enlarged scale ;<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic partial three-dimensional view from above of a further embodiment<br>
of an escalator installation in accordance with the invention; and<br>
Figure 5 is a schematic sectional elevation of the installation of Figure 4, taken along line<br>
V-V in Figure 4.<br>
In the drawings, reference numeral 10 generally indicates a movable walkway installation,<br>
in this example being an escalator installation, in accordance with the invention. The<br>
installation 10 comprises an escalator 12 and a pair/of disinfecting devices 14 for<br>
disinfecting a movable handrail 16 of he escalator 12.<br>
The escalator 12 provides an endless movable support member 18 for transporting persons<br>
(not shown) supported thereon along a path extending from one end of the escalator 12 to<br>
the other end thereof. The support member 18 is inclined, in this example moving forwardly<br>
from a lower landing 20 to a higher landing 22 in the direction of arrow 23.<br>
A pair of balustrades 24 comprising handrail guides is positioned alongside the support<br>
member 18, the balustrades 24 being on opposite sides of member 18, each balustrade 24<br>
extending parallel to the support member 18. Each balustrade 24 has a series of uprights or<br><br>
posts 25 which are transversely spaced apart in series, an endless rail 27 (Figure 3)<br>
extending along the upper and lower E3nds of the series of posts 25.<br>
Each balustrade 24 has mounted thereon an endless band 26 which is movable along an<br>
endless path or course. The band 26 is supported on and longitudinally slidably engaged<br>
with the rail 27 of the balustrade 24, so that the band 26 extends along and around the<br>
periphery of the balustrade 24, the periphery of the balustrade 24 defining the endless<br>
course of the band 26. In conventional fashion, the band 26 is of a flexible polymeric or<br>
elastomeric plastics material, in this case being of rubber. The endless course comprises an<br>
upper, forward leg 28 along which the band 26 moves in a direction parallel to the forward<br>
direction of movement of the support member 18 (indicated by arrow 23), and a lower<br>
return leg 30, in which the band 26 moves in the opposite direction, indicated by arrow 32.<br>
Along the upper leg 28, the band 26 thus provides a moving handrail for persons supported<br>
on the support member 18.<br>
A disinfecting device 14 is installed adjacent the endless course of each band 26 at a<br>
position under the endless course on its return leg 30. As can best be seen in Figure 1, each<br>
disinfecting device 14 is thus installed underground, beneath the surface 34 of the lower<br>
landing 20, and is thus not visible to users of the escalator 12.<br>
Each disinfecting device 14 comprises an irradiating means or irradiating device for<br>
irradiating the endless band 26 with disinfecting radiation in the form of electromagnetic<br>
waves, in this case ultra-violet waves 36, of which the wavelength and intensity are selected<br>
such that the ultra- violet waves 36 have a germicidal or disinfecting effect on the band 26.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 3 of the drawings, an outer surface 38 of the band 26 which, at the<br>
position of the device 14, faces outwardly and downwardly away from the rail 27, can be<br>
exposed to the ultra-violet radiation and can thus be disinfected.<br>
In use, the outer surface 38 of the band 26 is intermittently or continuously exposed to<br>
contact with the hands of users of the escalator 12, who use the band 26 as a handrail. It is<br>
well known that such contact can infect the handrail 16 with germs and viruses which are<br><br>
transmissible from one user to another. However, as each band 26 moves past its associated<br>
disinfecting device 14, these germs and viruses are killed or disabled by exposure to the<br>
ultra-violet radiation, thus disinfecting the outer surface 38 of the band 26. The transmission<br>
of infections or diseases from one use to another via the handrail 12 is thus inhibited.<br>
It should be appreciated that although, in this example, the disinfecting device 14 comprises<br>
an irradiating means, in other embodiments of the invention the disinfecting device 14 can<br>
instead be arranged operably to deposit a disinfecting substance on the endless band 26.<br>
In Figures 4 and 5 of the drawings, reference numeral 50 generally indicates a part of a<br>
further embodiment of an escalator installation in accordance with the invention. The<br>
installation 50 of Figure 4 is functionally similar to the installation 10 of Figure 1, like<br>
reference numerals indicating like pans in Figures 1 to 3 and in Figures 4 to 5.<br>
The main distinction between the installation 50 and the installation 10 of Figure 1 is that<br>
die irradiating means includes a pair of ultra- violet lamps 60 housed in an enclosed housing<br>
52 through which the band 26 passes longitudinally. The housing 52 thus extends around<br>
the band 26, when the band is viewed in cross-section (Figure 5), so that substantially no<br>
ultra-violet radiation escapes the housing 52, thus shielding users from ultra- violet<br>
radiation. In this example, the housing 52 is installed at a part of the endless course of the<br>
band 26 where it is not guided by the rail 27, in other words in a slack portion of the band<br>
26, so that the housing 52 completely envelops and surrounds the band 26 where it passes<br>
through the housing 52. It should be appreciated, however, that the housing 52 can, in other<br>
examples, be configured for installation such that a part of the rail 27 is located inside the<br>
housing 52.<br>
In this example the lamps 60 are in the form of elongated tubes which extend parallel to the<br>
lengthwise direction of the band 26 where it passes through the housing 52. The lamps 60<br>
respectively have a wattage of 30 watt and produce ultra-violet radiation in the extreme<br>
range of ultra- violet radiation. The housing 52 is longitudinally split, having a removable<br><br>
lid or cover 54 for permitting ready installation of the housing 52 and FOR ALLOWING<br>
maintenance personnel to access the lamps 60.<br>
The inner walls of the housing 52, which form the interior 62 of the housing, have a mirror-<br>
finish, thus being reflective to ultra-violet radiation. In use, ultra-violet waves emanating<br>
from the lamps 60 are thus reflected by the interior of the housing 52 such that not only the<br>
outwardly facing surface 38 of the hind 26, but also the opposing side and surfaces of the<br>
band 26, are exposed to disinfecting ultra-violet radiation.<br>
It is an advantage of the escalator installation 10 as described with reference to the drawings<br>
that the provision of the disinfecting devices 14 inhibits the transmission of germs or viruses<br>
between users who hold the same portion of the band 26 on successive passes of the band<br>
26 on the upper leg 28 of its endless path or course.<br>
It is also an advantage of the illustrated example that no substances are deposited on the<br>
band 26, so that the outer surface 38 of the band is not wet or sticky to the touch, and no<br>
replacement of any disinfectant substances is required.<br>
The irradiating device 14 is compatible with any existing walkway or escalator, so that the<br>
device 14 can be retro-fitted to existing walkways or escalators, to form an installation 10 as<br>
described with reference to the drawings. It is also envisaged that the band 26 can be at least<br>
partially transparent, in which case the disinfecting device can be used to disinfect areas<br>
located between the band 26 and therail 27.<br><br>
