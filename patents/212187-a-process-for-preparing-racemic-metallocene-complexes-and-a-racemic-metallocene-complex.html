and the use of racemic metallocene complexes of the formula III as catalysts or as constituents of catalysts for the polymerization of olefinically unsaturated compounds or as reagents or catalysts in stereoselective synthesis•<br>
In addition to the stereoselective polymerization of olefins, the enantioselective synthesis of organic compounds increasingly offers interesting possible applications of chiral metallocene complexes of metals of transition groups III - VI of the Periodic Table of the Elements. Examples which may be mentioned are enantioselective hydrogenations of prochiral substrates, for example prochiral olefins, as described in R. Waymouth, P. Pino, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 112 (1990), pp. 4911-4914, or prochiral ketones, imines and oximes as described in WO 92/9545.<br>
Further examples are the preparation of optically active alkenes by enantioselective oligomerization as described in W. Kaminsky et al., Angew. Chem. 101 (1989), pp. 1304-1306, and the enantioselective cyclopolymerization of 1,5-hexadienes as described in R. Waymouth, G. Coates, J. Am, Chem. Soc. 113 (1991), pp. 6270 - 6271.<br>
The applications mentioned generally require the use of a metallocene complex in its racemic form, i.e, without meso compounds. In the case of the mixture of diastereomers (rac. and meso forms) obtained in the metallocene synthesis of the prior art, the meso form firstly has to be separated off. Since the meso form has to be discarded, the yield of racemic metallocene complex is low.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to find a process for selectively preparing racemic metallocene complexes which are virtually free (to within NMR measurement accuracy) of meso isomer. A further object is to find racemic metallocene complexes which can either be used directly as catalysts or in catalysts, primarily for the polymerization of olefins, or can be used as catalysts or in catalysts, primarily for the polymerization of olefins, after modification, for example after replacement of an "auxilary ligand", or can be used as reagents or catalysts in stereoselective synthesis.<br>
We have found that these objects are achieved by the process defined in the claims, by the racemic metallocene complexes III and by their use as catalysts or in catalysts for the polymerization of olefinically unsaturated compounds or as reagents or catalysts in stereoselective synthesis.<br><br>
The terms "meso form", "racemate" and thus also "enantiomers" in the context of metallocene complexes are known and defined, for example, in Rheingold et al., Organometallics 11 (1992), pp. 1869 - 1876.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the expression "virtually meso free" means that at least 90% of a compound are present in the form of the racemate.<br>

The substituents R1 and R8 may also be C6-C15-aryl such as phenyl, naphthyl; alkylaryl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, e.g-P-tolyl; arylalkyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, e.g. benzyl, neophyl, or they may be triorganosilyl such as Si(R9)3 where R9 are identical or different and are each C1-C20-alkyl, C3-C10-cycloalkyl, C6-C15-aryl, for example trimethylsilyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, triphenylsilyl. The radicals mentioned can, of course, also be partially or fully substituted by heteroatoms, for example by S-, N-, 0- or halogen-containing structural elements* Examples of such substituted radicals R1 and<br><br>
R8 are the trifluoromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, heptafluoropropyl, heptafluoroisopropyl and pentafluorophenyl groups.<br>
Preferred substituents R1 and R8 are those which take up a large amount of space. Such substituents are usually referred to as bulky substituents and they can cause steric hindrance.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, these groups are generally organic or organosilicon radicals which take up a large amount of space (bulky radicals), but also fluorine and preferably chlorine, bromine and iodine. The number of carbon atoms in such organic or organosilicon radicals is usually not less than three•<br>
Preferred nonaromatic, bulky radicals are organic or organosilicon radicals which are branched in the a position or a higher position. Examples of such radicals are branched C3-C20-aliphatic, C9-C20-araliphatic and C3-C10-cycloaliphatic radicals, e.g. isopropyl, tert-butyl, isobutyl, neopentyl, 2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl (neophyl), cyclohexyl, 1-methylcyclohexyl, bicyclo[2.2.l]hept-2-yl (2-norbornyl), bicycle[2.2.1]hept-l-yl (1-norbornyl), adamantyl. Further suitable radicals of this type are organosilicon radicals having from three to thirty carbon atoms, for example trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, triphenylsilyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, tritolylsilyl or bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl.<br>
Preferred aromatic, bulky groups are generally C6-C20-aryl radicals, such as phenyl, 1- or 2-naphththyl or preferably C1-C10-alkyl- or C3-C10-cycloalkyl-substituted aromatic radicals such as 2,6-dimethylphenyl, 2,6-di-tert-butylphenyl, mesityl.<br>
Very particularly preferred substituents R1 and R8 are i-propyl, tert-butyl, trimethylsilyl, cyclohexyl, i-butyl, trifluoromethyl, 3,5-dimethylphenyl.<br>
In the preferred substitution pattern, R1 and R8 in formula I are identical.<br>
The substituents R2 to R7 are identical or different and are each hydrogen, C1-C20-alkyl, -OR27, -SR27, _N(R27)2, -P(R27)2, where R27 are identical or different and are each C1-C10-alkyl, C6-C15-aryl, C3-C10-cycloalkyl, alkylaryl or Si(R28)3 where R^s are identical or different and are each C1-C10-alkyl, C6-C15-aryl, C3-C10-cycloalkyl, alkylaryl, 3- to 8-membered cycloalkyl which may in turn bear a C1-C10-alkyl radical such as methyl, ethyl or propyl as substituent. Examples of such cycloalkyl radicals are<br><br>
cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, preterably  cyclonexyl, norbornyl. The substituents R2 to R7 may also be C6-C15-aryl such as phenyl, naphthyl, alkylaryl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, e.g. p-tolyl, arylalkyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, e.g. benzyl, neophyl, or they may be triorganosilyl such as Si(R9)3 where R9 are identical or different and are each C1-C20-alkyl, C3-C10-cycloalkyl, C6-C15-aryl, for example trimethylsilyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, triphenylsilyl. The radicals R2 to R7 may also be connected to one another so that adjacent radicals form saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated cyclic groups having from 4 to 15 carbon atoms. Preferably, the radicals R3 and R4 and/or the radicals R5 and R6 are joined by a C2 bridge so as to form a benzo-fused ring system (naphthyl derivative). The abovementioned radicals R2 to R7 can, of course, also be partially or fully substituted by heteroatoms, for example by S-, N-, 0- or halogen-7containing structural elements- Examples of such substituted radicals R2 to R7 are the trifluoromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, heptafluoropropyl, heptafluoroisopropyl and pentafluorophenyl groups-<br>
Particular preference is given to the radicals R2 and R7 being identical and each being hydrogen and R3, R4 ,   R5, R6 each being as, defined above.<br><br>
&gt; where<br><br>
R12	are identical or different and are each a hydrogen<br>
atom, a halogen atom, a C1-C10-alkyl group, a C1-C10-fluoroalkyl group, a C6-C10-fluoroaryl group, a C6-C10-aryl group, a C1-C10-alkoxy group, a C2-C10-alkenyl group, a C7-C4o-arylalkyl group, a C8-C4o-arylalkenyl group or a C7-C40-alkylaryl group or R12 and R13 or R12 and R14, in each case together with the atoms connecting them, form a ring,<br>
M1	is silicon, germanium or tin.<br>
A ring structure in (I) (m = 0) is of advantage for the process of the invention, and ring sizes where m = 1 to 3 are preferred-Preferred bridging elements Y, Y1 are methylene -CH2-, S, 0, -C(CH2)2-,  where m in formula I is preferably 1 or 2; Y1 are very particularly preferably identical and are each oxygen -O-. Preference is also given to phenoxide-type structures in which m in formula I is 0, i.e. the aromatic ring systems are linked directly to one another, preferably to form a biphenol derivative.<br>
Among the unbridged transition metal-aromatic complexes of the formula I which can be used according to the present invention, preference is given to those in which Y represents radicals R' and R" which are identical or different and are each fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, -OR27, -SR27,-N(R27)2, -P(R27)2,  where R27 are identical or different and are each C1-C10-alkyl, C6-C15-aryl, C3-C10-cycloalkyl, alkylaryl or Si(R28)3 where R28 are identical or different and are each C1-C10-alkyl, C6-C15-aryl, C3-C10-cycloalkyl, alkylaryl, C1-C20-alkyl or 3- to 8-membered cycloalkyl which may in turn bear a C1-C10-alkyl radical such as methyl, ethyl or propyl as substituent. Examples of such cycloalkyl radicals are cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, preferably cyclohexyl, norbornyl- The substituents R' and R" may also be C6-C15-aryl such as phenyl, naphthyl; alkylaryl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, e.g. p-tolyl; arylalkyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, e.g. benzyl, neophyl, or they may be triorganosilyl such as Si(R9)3 where R9 are identical or different and are each C1-C20-alkyl, C3-C10-cycloalkyl, C6-C15-aryl, for example trimethylsilyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, triphenylsilyl. The radicals mentioned can, of course, also be partially or fully substituted by heteroatoms, for example by S-, N-, 0- or halogen-containing structural elements. Examples of such substituted radicals R' and R" are the trifluoromethyl.<br><br>
pentafluoroethyl,   heptafluoropropyl, heptafluoroisopropyl and pentafluorophenyl groups,<br>
R' and R" are preferably identical. Particularly preferred unbridged transition metal-aromatic complexes are ones in which R1, R8, R' and R" are identical; a very particularly preferred substitution pattern is one in which R1, R3, R' and R6, R8, R' are H and R2, R4 and R5, R7 are as defined above, preferably tert-butyl, but are not H. The phenolic group in (I) is preferably a biphenoxide group having the above-described substitution pattern.<br>
The bridged or unbridged transition metal-aromatic complexes I are generally prepared by methods known to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
The synthesis of bridged transition metal phenoxide complexes is described, for example, in C. J. Schaverien, J. Am. Chem- Soc. (1995), pages 3008 to 3012, Another procedure which has been found to be useful is the following, where the reaction is generally carried out at from -78 to 110°C, preferably initially at about 20°C and then under reflux to complete the reaction. The biphenol is firstly deprotonated in a solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran (THF), for example using sodium hydride or n-butyllithium, and the transition metal compound, for example the halide, e.g. titanium, zirconium or hafnium tetrachloride, advantageously in the form of the bis-THF adduct, is then added. After the reaction is complete, the product is generally obtained by separating off salts and then crystallizing it. The preparation of unbridged transition metal phenoxide complexes can be carried out, for example, as described by H. Yasuda et al., J. Organomet. Chem, 473 (1994), pages 105 to 116-<br>
The bridged or unbridged transition metal-aromatic complexes I generally additionally contain from 1 to 4 equivalents of a Lewis base which is generally introduced via the synthetic route. Examples of such Lewis bases are ethers such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF) or amines such as TMEDA. However, it is also possible to obtain the transition metal-aromatic complexes in a form free of Lewis bases, for example by drying under reduced pressure or by choice of other solvents in the synthesis. Such measures are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The racemic metallocene complexes of the present invention are prepared by reacting the bridged or unbridged transition metal-aromatic complexes I with cyclopentadienyl derivatives of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals and subsequently heating<br><br>
the resulting reaction mixture in the presence or absence of free radicals or free radical formers, as described below.<br>
Preference is given to using transition metal-aromatic complexes r in which M is zirconium and the radicals R1 and R8 have the preferred meanings described above. Very well-suited complexes are dichlorobis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenolato)zirconium • (THF)2f dichlorobis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenolato)zirconium • (DME), dichlorobis(2,6-dimethylphenolato)zirconium • (THF)2, dichlorobis(2,6-dimethylphenolato)zirconium . (DME), dichlorobis(2,4, 6-trimethylphenolato)zirconium • (THF)2, dichlorobis(2,4,6-trimethylphenolato)zirconium - (DME) and the zirconium phenoxide compounds mentioned in the example.<br>
Suitable cyclopentadienyl derivatives of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals are in principle those which, after reaction with the bridged transition metal-aromatic complexes I used according to the present invention, selectively give racemic metallocene complexes which are virtually free of meso isomer.<br>
The racemic metallocene complexes of the present invention can be bridged, but do not have to be. In general, a high barrier to rotation, especially in the temperature range from 20 to 80°C, (able to be determined by 1H- and/or 13C-NMR spectroscopy) of the unbridged cyclopentadienyl-type ligands in the metallocene is sufficient for the metallocene complexes to be able to be isolated in their racemic form without them being able to transform into the meso form. The barrier to rotation which ensures this is usually above 20 kJ/mol.<br>
Well-suited cyclopentadienyl derivatives of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals are those of the formula II<br><br>
where the substituents and indices have the following meanings:<br>
M2	is Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba,<br>

in which M2 is magnesium, R17 and R23 are substituents other than hydrogen, e.g, C1-C10-alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propy] , i-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, i-butyl, hexyl, also C6-C10-aryl such as phenyl or trialkylsilyl such as trimethylsilyl, T(R25R26) is bis-C1-C10-alkylsilyl or bis-C6-C10-arylsilyl such as dimethylsilyl, diphenylsilyl, also 1,2-ethanediyl, methylene, and the radicals R13 to R15 and R19 to R25 are as defined above and in particular form an indenyl-type ring system or a benzoindenyl-type ring system.<br>

Such alkali or alkaline earth metal compounds II can be obtained by methods known from the literature, for example by the, preferably, stoichiometric, reaction of an organometallic compound or a hydride of the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal with the appropriate cyclopentadiene-type hydrocarbon. Suitable organometallic compounds are, for example, n-butyllithium, di-n-butylmagnesium or (n,s)-dibutylmagnesium (Bomag).<br>
The reaction of the bridged or unbridged transition metal-aromatic complexes I with the cyclopentadienyl derivatives of alkali or alkaline earth metals, preferably of the formulae II or II a) usually takes place in an organic solvent or suspension medium, preferably in a solvent mixture comprising a Lewis-basic solvent, at from -78°C to 250°C, preferably from 0 to 110°C.  Well-suited solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, ortho-, meta- or para-xylene or isopropylbenzene (cumene), ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether or dimethoxyethane (DME), amines such as diisopropylamine, tetrconethylethanediamine (TMEDA) or pyridine- Well-suited solvent mixtures are mixtures of toluene and THF, toluene and DME or toluene and TMEDA, where the Lewis base is generally present in an amount of from 0.1 to 50 mol%, preferably from 1 to 20 mol%, based on the solvent mixture. The molar ratio of the transition metal-aromatic complex I to the cyclopentadienyl derivative of an alkali or alkaline earth metal is usually in the range from 0,8 : 1 to 1 : 1.2 and is preferably 1:1-<br>
It has been found that subsequent warming or heating of the  reaction mixture to temperatures in the range from -78 to 250°C, preferably from 20 to 150°C and in particular from 80 to 110°C, in the presence or absence of free radicals or free radical formers<br><br>
quickly leads to a higher yield, generally from 80 to 100%, preferably from 95 to 100%, of racemic complexes (I). Possible free radicals are oxygen and 2,2'-6,6'-tetramethylpyrimidine N-oxide (TEMPO). As free radical formers, it is possible to use all organic and inorganic compounds which decompose to generate free radicals in the abovementioned temperature range and/or on irradiation, for example peroxides, diacyl peroxides {e.g, benzoyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide), peroxydicarbonates, peresters, azoalkanes, nitrites, hypochlorites, polyhalomethanes, N-Chloroamines. Particular preference is given to using TEMPO. Preference is given to using free radical formers when the metallocene (I) contains a benzo-fused indenyl system such as dimethylsilylbis(2-methylbenzoindenyl) as cyclopentadienyl-type ligand.<br>

The racemic metallocene complexes, preferably those of the formula III, can generally be modified further-<br><br>
In particular, a bridged biphenoxide ligand X1 in the complex III can be completely or half split or one or both unbridged phenoxide ligands can be split off by monosubstitution or disubstitution and, if desired, used further. Suitable splitting-off (replacement) methods are reaction of the racemic metallocene compounds, preferably those of the formula III, with SOCl2, silicon tetrachloride, methylaluminum dichloride, dimethylaluminum chloride, aluminum trichloride or a Bronsted acid such as a hydrogen halide, i.e. HF, HBr, HI, preferably HCl, which is generally used as such or as a solution in water or organic solvents such as diethyl ether or THF. Well-suited solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, ortho-, meta- or para-xylene or isopropylbenzene (cumene), ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether or dimethoxyethane (DME), amines such as diisopropylamine, tetramethylethanediamine (TMEDA) or pyridine- Very well-suited solvents are Lewis-base-containing mixtures of hydrocarbons and ethers or amines or both, for example mixtures of toluene and THF, toluene and DME or toluene and TMEDA, where the Lewis base is generally present in an amount of 0,01-50 mol%, preferably 0.1-10 mol%, based on the solvent mixture. Particularly useful "replacement reagents are carboxylic halides such as acetyl chloride, phenylacetyl chloride, 2-thiophenacetyl chloride, trichloroacetyl chloride, trimethylacetyl chloride, 0-acetylmandeloyl chloride, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic chloride, 2,6-pyridinecarboxylic chloride, tert-butylacetyl chloride, chloroacetyl chloride, 4-chlorophenylacetyl chloride, dichloroacetyl chloride, 3-methoxyphenylacetyl chloride, acetyl bromide, bromoacetyl bromide, acetyl fluoride, benzoyl fluoride, which are generally used in the abovementioned solvents or as such. This usually gives the dihalide analogous to the formula III (X =    F, C1, Br, I) or, in the case of partial (half) replacement of the phenolic ligand, a monohalide, A further well-suited replacement method is reaction of the racemic metallocene complexes, preferably those of the formula III, with organoaluminum compounds such as tri-C1-C10-alkylaluminum, e.g. trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, tri-n-butylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum. This generally gives, on the basis of present knowledge, the organo compound analogous to III (X = organic radical, e.g. C1-C10-alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, i-butyl) and, for example, the organoaluminum binaphthoxide. An analogous method can also be used when the ligand X1 in the complex III is two unbridged phenoxide ligands.<br><br>
In the cleavage reactions, the components are usually used in the stoichiometric ratio regardless of whether a monosubstituted or disubstituted product is to be obtained.<br>
The cleavage reactions generally take place with retention of the stereochemistry of the metallocene complexes, i.e. there is generally no conversion of the racemic form into the meso form of the metallocene complexes. Rather, particularly when using the above-described chlorination methods, the rac-selectivity can be increased while generally retaining the stereochemistry of the starting (bi)phenoxide or starting bisphenoxide complexes.<br>
The process of the present invention makes it possible to obtain the racemic form of metallocene complexes very selectively-Bridged indenyl-type or benzoindenyl-type metallocenes which have a ligand other than hydrogen next to the bridge (namely the 2 position) can be obtained particularly advantageously.<br>
The racemic metal complexes prepared according to the present invention, particularly those of the formula III or their above-described derivatives obtainable, for example, by replacement of the phenoxide ligands, can be used as catalysts or in catalyst systems for the polymerization of olefinically unsaturated compounds such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene or styrene. Their use is particularly advantageous in the stereoselective polymerization of prochiral, olefinically unsaturated compounds such as propylene or styrene. Suitable catalysts or catalyst systems in which the racemic metallocene complexes of the present invention can function as "metallocene component" are usually obtained by means of compounds capable of forming metallocenium ions, as described, for example, in EP-A-0 700 935, page 7, line 34 to page 8, line 21 and formulae (IV) and (V). Further compounds capable of forming metallocenium ions are aluminoxanes (RAlO)n such as methylaluminoxane.<br>
The racemic metallocene complexes prepared according to the present invention, in particular those of the formula III or their above-described derivatives obtainable, for example, by splitting off the phenoxide ligands, can also be used as reagents or as catalysts or in catalyst systems in stereoselective, in particular organic, synthesis. Examples which may be mentioned are stereoselective reductions or stereoselective alkylations of C-C double bonds or C=0 or C=N double bonds*<br>
