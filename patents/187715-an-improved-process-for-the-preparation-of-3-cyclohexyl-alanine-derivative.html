Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 3-cyclohexyl alanine and its derivatives. The present invention particularly relates to an improved process for the preparation of 3-cyclohexyl alanine of the formula (I),<br><br>
wherein R',R2,R3,R4,R5 may be same or different and independently represent hydrogen, (Cp C5) alkyl group or OX, where X is a hydrogen atom or a removable hydroxy protecting group such as (C1-C5) alkyl, aryl, tetrahydropyran ; P represents hydrogen atom or a removable amino protecting group such as benzyloxy carbonyl, tert-butyloxy carbonyl and M represents a hydrogen atom or metal cation or (Ci-Cs)alkyl group or an aryl group or an organic base like dicyclohexyl amine, piperidine, triethylamine, their derivatives, their analogs, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their salts and their solvates.<br>
3-cyclohexyl alanine of the formula (I) forms part of several peptides of pharmaceutical importance. For example, its use as renin inhibitor for the treatment of hypertension is disclosed in European patent application Nos. 0 371 179; 0 468 641 and US patent application No. 5 229 518 etc. Its use as metallo proteinase inhibitor for cancer treatment is disclosed in International application No. WO 93/24475 and as analgesic is disclosed in US patent No.4,273,704. Its activity against immuno deficiency syndrome by activating effectively the phagocytic action of macrophages and polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes is disclosed in European patent application No. 0 454 302 and International applications No. WO 92/04370. The use of   3-cyclohexyl<br><br>
alanine as sweetening agent for pharmaceutical products and food stuffs is disclosed in German patent application Nos. 1,936,159 &amp; 1,948,788.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Several reports describes the process for the preparation of 3-cyclohexyl alanine by hydrogenation of L-phenylalanine in acidic medium. The hydrogenated product was isolated by evaporation of the solvent and then derivatized to produce amino group protected 3-cyclohexyl alanine, since protected amino acids are most commonly used in peptide synthesis. Use of acetic acid for the reduction of amino acids may lead to racemisation of the product [Sakieki et al, J. Chem. Soc. Jpn., (1959), 80, 1035; Matsuo et al, Chem. Pharm. Bull. (1970), 18, 1788] and may corrode the reaction vessel.<br>
US patent No. 4,273,704 describes a process for the preparation of 3-cyclohexyl alanine reacting L-phenylalanine in 90% aq. acetic acid in the presence of RJ1-AI2O3 as catalyst for 24 hours at 37 °C. The catalyst is separated by filtration and filtrate is concentrated to dryness. The N-carbenoxy protection is then carried out in presence of NaOH solution.<br>
US patent Nos. 5,229,518 &amp; 5,182,266 disclose a process for the preparation of the 2(S)-cyclohexyl alanine by hydrogenating L-Phenyl alanine over Pd/C in acetic acid. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst is filtered and solvent is concentrated to yield the desired compound.<br>
European patent application No. 0 454 302, describes a process for the preparation of D-cyclohexyl alanine by hydrogenating D-phenylalanine in aq. acetic acid (1:1) over Pt02 under 70 kg/cm2 pressure at room temperature. After 7 hrs, the catalyst is filtered off and the filtrate is concentrated. The recrystallised compound is suspended in a mixture of dioxane and 3N sodium<br><br>
hydi oxide solution under ice cooling and then di-tert-butyl-pyrocarbonate added to get N-tert-butoxy carbonyl-D-cyclohexyl alanine.<br>
International patent application No. WO 92/04370 describes a method for the preparation of L-cyclohexyl alanine which comprises hydrogenation of L-phenyl alanine over Pt02 under 47 psi of pressure for 2 days in 70 % of acetic acid. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was filtered and the solvent concentrated under reduced pressure.<br>
The present invention is based upon our finding that alkaline solutions are conveniently used as solvents for the hydrogenation of phenyl alanine of formula (II) under mild pressure and ambient temperature conditions.<br>
Objective of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of 3-cyclohexyl alanine of the formula (I), as defined above, their derivatives, their analogs, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their salts &amp; their solvates.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a simple, commercially viable, cost effective process for the preparation of 3-cyclohexyl alanine of the formula (I), (a), by minimizing the number of plant operations, (b) using non-hazardous starting materials.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of 3-cyclohexyl alanine derivative of the formula (I),<br><br><br>
wherein R , R , R , R , R may be same or different and independently represent hydrogen, (Q-C5) alkyl group or OX, where X is a hydrogen atom or a removable hydroxy protecting group such as (Ci-C5) alkyl, aryl, tetrahydropyran ; P represents hydrogen atom and M represents a hydrogen atom or metal cation or (C1-C5) alkyl group or an aryl group or an organic base like dicyclohexyl amine, piperidine, triethylamine, their derivatives, their analogs, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their salts and their solvates, which comprises : i).        reducing L-phenyl alanine of the formula (II)<br><br>
where all the symbols have the meanings defined above in a solution of alkaline or alkaline earth metal of the Group IA and IIA elements and in the presence of a catalyst at a temperature in the range of 10-70 °C, at a pressure ranging from atmospheric pressure to 300 psi,<br>
ii). separating the catalyst from the reaction mixture by conventional methods,<br>
iii). isolating the compound of formula (I) by conventional methods and if desired,<br>
iv). converting the compound of formula (I) obtained in step (iii) into its derivatives, analogues,<br>
stereoisomers, salts &amp; solvates by reacting with a carbonate such as benzyloxy carbonyl chloride<br>
or di-t-butyl dicarbonate followed by treatment with bases such as NaOH, KOH or dicyclohexyl<br>
alanine.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The catalyst used in the above said process may be selected from platinum, palladium or rhodium and the like mounted on alumina or carbon. The alkaline solution used is selected from the hydroxides of Group IA and IIA elements preferably hydroxides of lithium, sodium, potassium and the like. The temperature for the reduction may range from 10 °C to 70 °C, preferably at room temperature. The reduction may be carried out at a pressure ranging from atmospheric pressure to 300 psi. The reaction time may range from 6-15 h, preferably from 8-12 h.<br>
The separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture may be affected by centrifuging the reaction mixture or by filtration.<br>
The isolation of the compound of the formula (I) where P represents hydrogen atom and M represents metal cation such as Li, Na, K etc may be carried out by conventional methods such as evaporating the solvent at elevated temperature or freeze drying or spray drying the reaction mass. Compound of formula (I) where both P &amp; M represents hydrogen may be isolated from reaction mass after separating the catalyst and adjusting the pH of reaction mass to isoelectric point. The said compound so precipitated out may be separated by fitration or centrifugation.<br><br>
The protection of compound of the formula (I) where P represents hydrogen atom may be carried after separating the catalyst from reaction mass, directly without isolating the compound of formula (I) where P represents hydrogen by reacting with a carbonate such as benzyloxycarbonyl chloride or di-t-butyl dicarbonate.<br>
Cyclohexyl alanine of the formula (I) where P represents a protective group may be recovered by acidification of the reaction mixture and the compound of formula (I) where P represents a protective group taken from carbonate family may be extracted into suitable organic solvent and then solvent evaporated.<br>
Conversion of compound of the formula (I) where P represents hydrogen atom or a protecting group and M represent hydrogen atom to its salt may be carried out by reacting the compound with an equimolar quantity of inorganic bases like NaOH, KOH or organic bases like dicyclohexyl alanine and the isolating required compound in salt form by conventional methods like evaporation of the solvent or filtration of the salt.<br>
