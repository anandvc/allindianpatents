rhe invention relates to a method of manufacturing vound thread bobbins with automatic regulations of a thread tension in a bobbin-winding machine.<br>
The invention relates to a method for the automatic regulation of the thread tension in a bobbin-winding machine and this regulation acts on the pre-established winding-speed values, at each moment, in the various thread-collection phases.<br>
As is known, winding devices are used in the textile industry to wind the thread onto suitable bobbins, consisting of cylindrical or flat-tapered cross-wound bobbins. These winding devices, known as bobbin-winding machines have the capacity of winding thread at a high speed unwinding it from a lower pirn and collecting it on an upper bobbin in formation.<br>
Some textile processes consist, firstly, in transfer¬ring the thread, at the highest possible speed, from one unit to another. For example a thread produced in a spinning machine, particularly a ring spinning machine, is normally wound onto a bobbin. In bobbin-<br><br>
winding there is, in fact, the transfer of the thread (rewinding) from the lower pirn to the upper bobbin, with an unwinding  through  axial extraction of the thread from the fixed pirn. In this case the thread undergoes elongation and in relation to this elongation a thread tension is established. With the continuous increase in the transfer speed of the thread (thread length transferred-per unit time.) to reduce production costs, higher and higher tensions are created in the thread, thus producing frequent breakages, which cause a considerable reduction in the operating performance of the bobbin-winding machine and its productivity. Thread breakage occurs in fact under a tension which is greater than the tensile strength of the thread. It is also well-known to experts in the field, that the thread tension must remain substantially constant to ensure that difficulties do not arise during further textile operations of the bobbin, i.e. the objective is always to obtain units of wound thread which are more suitable for subsequent operations such as dyeing, warping, picking, etc...<br>
An increase in the bobbin circumferential speed of the wound thread creates a greater thread tension whereas on the other hand a reduction in the circumferential speed produces a lesser thread tension.<br><br>
For this reason the multiplication ratio is preferably made variable in both directions. It is therefore advantageous that the preregulated and prefixed win¬ding-speed values are made to depend on the quantity of thread to be wound onto the single lower pirn, on the degree of fullness of the bobbin in formation and also on the type of thread being wound, and other factors. In traditional bobbin-winding machines, however, there is no possibility of continually regulating the tension of the thread which is being wound onto the bobbin. As a result, the thread itself may undergo excessive pull which can lead to its breakage. For the same reasons also the winding of the thread onto the bobbin will not be regular.<br>
The above practical drawbacks are, instead, eliminated by the method to which the present invention relates. This method, in fact, provides an automatic regulation of the tension and this regulation is obtained by the fact that the thread tension is automatically and continuously checked and regulated by the pressing action of thread tension devices; these devices operate on the thread in relation to the pre-established winding-speed values at each moment during the various thread-collection phases onto the bobbin in formation. For the practical embodiment of the method of the<br><br>
invention the pressure of the thread tension devices has opposite values to the variation of winding speed values of the thread onto the bobbin in formation.<br>
According to another practical embodiment of the method of the present invention it Is established that the stretches of increasing winding-speed correspond to stretches of decreasing pressure values of the thread-tension devices and the stretches of decreasing winding-speed correspond to stretches of increasing pressure values of the thread-tension devices. In the same way, the stretches of constant winding-speed correspond to basically constant pressure values of the thread-tension devices.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method of manufacturing wound thread bobbins with automatic regulation of a thread tension in a bobbin-winding machine having a lower pirn, an upper bobbin, a thread winding speed detector, and thread-tension device, said method comprising the steps of: collecting thread unwound from said lower pirn on .said upper bobbin in tbrmation ; detecting a winding speed value of the thread by the thread winding speed detector, controlling said winding speed value of the thread on the basis of said detected winding speed value by the thread winding speed detector; pressing on the thread by said thread-tension devices between said lower pirn and said upper bobbins; and controlling a pressure action on said thread by said thread-tension devices on the basis of said detected winding speed value of the thread during an entire period of thread collection so as to regulate the thread tension.<br><br>
These and other operating characteristics of the method, to which the<br>
»<br>
present patent invention relates, can be better understood with the help of the figures in the accompanying drawings, in which :<br>
in Fig. 1 the bobbin-winding machine is shown in a schematical front view with the thread tension devices acting on the thread with pressure values depending on the winding-speed value;<br>
fig. 2 shows the graph of the winding-speed along a stretch ranging fi-om zero to standard speed a stretch of constant standard speed and a sJow-<br>
down stretch frnm standard to zero sneed<br><br>
:ig. 3 shows the graph of the pressure values on the :hread of the thread-tension devices and these pressure 'alues are in relation to the speed values of fig. 2. in the figures, equal elements, or with equal or squivalent functions show equal references. LISO in the figures, to clarify the group of parts rhich are not necessary for understanding the inven¬tion, such as operating and functional groups along the :hread run, the various support structures of the jobbin-winding machine, the motorization centres and feeding, support and pirn expulsion devices, have been )mitted.<br>
:n the enclosed figures:<br>
. is the thread which is unwound from the lower pirn i and which runs upwards to be wound in crossed coils iround the bobbin in formation 5; 15 is a three-phase .lotor, or similar motor source, which activates, by iieans of the toothed belt 24, the thread-guide cylinder K The latter is the known driving roller which pro-rides both the alternating coming and going movement of :he thread 1, and the rotating movement of bobbin 5 in iormation until the latter has reached the required liameter of thread; 10 is the control block based on a liniprocessor, or electronic card suitable for memori-!ing the operating instructions. More specifically<br><br>
hese instructions are inserted by key-board 14 through :able 19. The control block 10 is programmed to trans¬form these instructions coming from cable 19 into a iuitable program to be followed in its processing :entre to provide, at each moment, the necessary iignals for a correct winding.<br>
.'ontrol block 10 is in fact basically a microprocessor, /hich uses as input information obtained both from lisk-probe 16 by means of cable 18, and the cable of jrobe 8, which transmits signals programmed for the :ontrol of thread 1, which is subjected to exploration 3y means of block 4, which represents the electronic ram  cleaner, and also from cable 25 which, with its Dhotocell, transmits the presence of the minimum termi-lal quantity of thread wound onto pirn 2. In relation :o said minimum quantity, the photocell of cable 25 »fhen this residue of wound thread is noted, sends an »lectric signal to control block 10 to establish the driving signals on motor 15, by means of cable 20, to adjust the winding speed to a value which does not iamage thread 1 being rapidly wound onto the surface of oobbin 5; there are three thread-tension devices in the tnown art, in particular clutch components which press, Ifith  varying pressure force, thread 1 being wound. More specifically, the pressure variation of the 3 clutch<br><br>
components is activated with electric signals coming from control block 10 through cable 6, and these electric signals preferably activate an electromagnetic activator which pilots and regulates with precise pressure values the action of the 3 clutch components on thread 1, being rapidly wound. The following opera¬tional description, with reference to the figures mentioned above, refers to the whole group of devices and components which embody the method of the present invention and the functioning can be easily understood from observing the figures of the enclosed tables. In a textile winding machine, for example in an auto¬matic bobbin-winding machine, thread 1 removed from pirn 2 which is being unwound is collected onto a crossed coil bobbin 5 and in this form it is suitable for use in subsequent operations.<br>
As the thread is being transferred from pirn 2 to bobbin 5, the thread itself is subjected to exploration by block 4, which represents the electronic yarn cleaner.<br>
When the driving thread-guide cylinder 7 is at a stop, in a resting position, the three-phase motor source 15 is mechanically at a stop and does not receive electri¬cal energy. When the functioning of the driving thread-guide<br><br>
cylinder 7 is required to begin winding the following phases take place: the starting signal is sent, by connecting cable 20 from control block 10, which has the whole operating cycle programmed in its memory. Motor source 15 starts rotating making probe-disk 16 rotate and also the ridge, thread guide roller 7 by means of toothed-belt 24.<br>
The speed probe 16 supplies central block 10 through connecting cable 18, at each moment, with the instanta¬neous speed values which may be in acceleration phase 22, standard phase 21, or slow-down phase 23. The central control block 10 provides, through appropriate elaborations, by means of connecting cable 6, the driving signals to pilot, at each moment, the thread-tension device activator 3, in order to obtain a perfect harmony between the instantaneous speed values of figure 2 and the pressure values of the thread-tension devices 3 of figure 3. In this way it is possible to follow with precision the correspondence of points 9, 11 and 12 and stretches 22, 21 and 23 in both graphs of figure 2 and figure 3. More specifically, the interruption of lines of figure 3 is programmed and memorized, through key-board 14, in the control block 10, and the pressure values on the thread by means of the thread-tension devices 3 are in relation to the<br><br>
corresponding instantaneous speed values shown by probe 16 and transmitted by cable 18 of block 10. The latter, as a central unit having the whole pro¬grammed operating winding cycle in its memory, sends preselection signals of accelerations and speeds to be obtained, at each moment, during the whole formation cycle of bobbin 5. The central block 10 compares the preselection signal sent to motor source 15 with the instantaneous speed value sent from probe 16 and, with appropriate elaborations, supplies, through cable 6, signals of the correct functioning of the activator of the thread-tension devices 3 which are pressing on the thread in a value which depends on the winding speed of the thread itself 1.<br>
A description has been given of a preferred embodiment with some variations. It is evident however that other forms of embodiment are possible which enter into the spirit and scope of the present invention. In this way, as the activating devices may vary so is it also possible to combine or remove operating units on the single or group of winding stations to advanta¬geously co-ordinate the all the units in the various operating and control phases of the relation between the pressure values of the thread-tension devices 3 and the winding speed values.<br><br>
These and other variations are consequently possible without leaving the range of the invention.<br><br><br>
